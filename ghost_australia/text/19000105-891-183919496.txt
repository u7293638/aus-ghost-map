[coPYBionr.] & A E Bad come, one© more, to the big meadow which from the Crockran ■ foot runs away along Thrasna Hirer; and already had we more than J half of it. safely von and gathered. Never before, not even in that famous summer, years ago, that saw Hal and one self masters in Emo, had hay | making brought | fewer cares or plcasanter toll. The weather ! was glorious—bright, firm August days help was plentiful; yon had hat to mow, , turn over the swathes and carry in, only to | work and pray God for more of His good ! sunshine. And how we did work in that time of | golden weather I Hardly had the mists begun to rise o* mornings, when yon heard the jingle of the traces as the horses went over the hills from Emo ; like ghosts yon saw them plodding home of evenings through the dusk. All the day long the whirr of the mowing machine, the hum of the tedder, the shonts of young Hal urging the horses, came untiringly over the hills. It was up with the lark, wash the sleep from your eyes, thank God for your breakfast, then strip like a mar, shoulder rake and fork, and boldly face the big sun. From dew-rise to dew-fall, that was our day. It was do or die with us; for who but a fool ever dallies when the sun ' chases rain from Irish hills? And had not the pigs flown joyfully ? So said the wise heads, when last Emo big meadow was made in August. At it, then, my lads, said we, and one and all buckled to. Ah! but we were happy hard as nails, brown, as turf, strong as yuung bulls. Howweshoated and sang, laughed and yelled; how the hHTa rang with our babel! It was a very feast of work, a mad riot of sweet toil. For months and months had the weather been playing with us; now we were flouting ir, fooling it; early and late were stealing marches upon it; making ready for that great time when radiantly we should point to work well done, and jeeringly ask the weatherto do its worst. Yet who could tell ? Poor Ireland's weather goddess was a fickle jade, never conld ono tell what torrents of tears lay deep behind the flnsh of her smile. To-morrow it might bo pouring; a week heucc might see the river level with its banks; ten days might go and leave the water soaking to the roots of tho i hills. At it, then, lads; at it with migh* and main. Never heed the morrow; this dr • - at all events is glorious. Look at the glor^ of it; not a speck on the bine, the horizon as firm as brass, the sun marching royally for his kingdom beyonu the mountains. Now, now is the time; four great days already have we had, four days more, please God, ore in store; with a shout, then, ana a heart, my lads—with a heart and a shout. So one and all wc buckled to. 5uw happy we were! How good it is even now to recall that time and to picture the scene there beforo one's eye. There is Annie Trotter stooping over her baby as it lies, well hidden from the fierce eye of the sun. behind a haycock. Not far off Judy Brady is "lettihg out" ropes ; from a pile of hay, and young Ted is twisting than from the end of a rake. Look at Anne | Daly—Fat Anne her friends call her—arms I hare, cheeks flaming like June roses, stagger I ing along over there beneath a mighty load * j there's a fine figure of a woman for ! yon. That man in shirt and trousers i and big straw hat, the roan with a ! pipe in his month just now calling on Wee | James to " Hurry up wid him," he is James Daly—wag and philosopher, and the husband of Fat Anne. "Hurry up wid ye," shouts he. " Right, me son," answers Wee James: then runs, leaps right over Hike Brady as he stoops to tie his boots, and with a skirl goes sprawling over the great ring of hay which . presently he should fashion into a trim built "ruck." "Woh-woh!" shouts the master, as the long teeth of the horserake take the ground. "Back!" ho shonts, and tugs at the handles. "Right"; he calls, and off steps the horse, with little Johnny Brady at its head, off with its great crackling golden load. Away over there, close to the hill edge, among" the lush newly-mown swaths, and outside a great plot of grass in which the corncrakes sit cowering, Hal (has the rascal spied Biddy and her tea basket, one wonders) is unyoking the horses from the mowing machine, and with a shout for every blow, killing the flies that lie gorging their blood. A fine coufus*ion of sounds, of shouting and laughter, of singing and swearing, of jingling , and whirring and clanking fills the meadow; there is not enough air stirring to flap a shirt sleeve. like the breath of a furnace the heat comes pouring from the great brazen ball of the sun, sweeps over the Emo hills, and smites us there in the v.illey by the cool, winding river. "Tea time!" calls the master; and at tho word, down went rakes and forks (for what Irishman of worth ever dallies at sight of •-*tay" F) and from all rideswe came flocking in, this one running and wiping his lips, . that one hastening with a child in his arras and a dog at his heels, the master stepping . • along in-hU pordy dignity,,Hal swaggering up with his hat on his crown and a whip in ,hi8 hand, Ted juropingthe-swathes in his 'yonngTigour, the women chattering as they come, and holding' foolish dwcourso .with' Annie Trotter's baby. . One and all came flocking in,' and gathered in a ring round Biddy, the servant, and • her huge basket of tirown bread and butter, oaten r cake and .bntter.{what_epicurM we were in: \- v those days, to be 'sure!), and her big can of steaming tea, Down-sat we; off came pur tats, up went the voices in ■ chorus," " Now' Biddy,0 said they, "ye girl ye." "Ah, slap it' out," went tliey.-: V Fire it round, Biddy, agra." "Och, hearts alive," said Wee James, whose soul We knew was a thirst 'for Congo, "the' whiff*that-comes-from it." "Ay, ay," answered Mike Brady,, rubbing Jus lean jaw; "it's as" fresh a'most as the inside of a haystack, so it is.; -Aw, hurry up, Biddy, ye girl; hurry up.*' ; So Biddy harried up; into porringers and mum emptied the can, piled bread and butter on the month of each, - from one to another passed them round. "I'm obliged to ye, Biddy; more power to yet elbow, me ^irl," said we, and fell to. The tongues by silent, smack went the lips all round the ring, find within fire minutes of our corainrr you could not have found near Biddy's basket wherewith to feed a sparrow." • ' . ; " Well, thank God for that," said we, then wiped onr lips and lay back for half anhourV Test. The. men set their pipes 'going, the . "women fell a clacking, but the master, "who never smoked in working hours, and whose 'eye was always quick for the right of print, .leant forward, pulled the paper lining from the tea-basket, ard lying back against a pile ^ of hay, began to read. His mind was at ease; good humour, bind of good tea and good weather, possessed his soul. Presently he snorted disdainfully, then chuckled sardonic ally, then broke Into a smothered laugh, at last rolled the paper into a hall, fluatr it out ?nto the stubble, muttered something about tomfoolery, then palled bis bat orer his eyes, folded his arms, and, within "fivo minutes was fast asleep.

" Ah 1 'deed would it." answered Mike, and turning his bit o* print, pulled his hat over his. eyes, gathered up his knees, and begun spelling among the letterpress, 44 'deed it would so." ; Anne Daly turned to Judy Brady and 'Annie Trotter. " ''.It's God's mercy, girls,'.' said she with a .hard.little laugh, 44that we can keep out skins whole on us. I wonder what the men In these porta'd bo doin'. supposin' we were fine in the bone an4 couldn't thrive on the praties an* salt P"- • • " Sure the craturs M just gasp an* die,** returned Jndy, " sure they would.** James Daly -winked solemnly across-at Hal and myself, us we sat, with an: eye.on the master, taking half-minute turns at Hal's elegant briar pipe, then bent forward and clasped-Ji is knees with both hands.

An' there was no whisky, au' no sign* of any; an* half the pipes among us weren't* goin'; an'-we said little, au** 'twas only to snuff the candies -that stood here an* thero about the flufo in bottles thatone of us'd stir a limb. • '*After a-while we hears the tramp tramp o'-Jop-up the barn ladder; theu his big head shows above the flure, then his shoulders, an' before you'd wink, 'One b*" the boys had the trapdoor closed behind' bira au1 was sittiu' on 4?4 Ho, ho, -mo sons,' says Jop, turnin to us, an' rubbin' his hands; -* ho, ho, me sons. Good eVeniu' to ye all. • Bully boys, bullv bovs.* - |4 An* next thing, two of the boy? had Jop by" the arms an*- were twistm' them behiud his back. He was took by surprise, on' for a secoud or two hie stands dumbfoundered; then tries to turn round, ah shout*: 4 What! what! " What's this? Let me go, yo fools.* But the boys held him as if he was a child, an' Billy .Brody shouts from his chuir, 4 Silence iti court, Joseph Haoly.* 4 Silence yourself, Billy Brody,* answers Jop, an' struggles like blazes. 'Let mo go,' ho shouts, an* froths at -tho -mouth, 'aw, sweep ye, let rao go!' But he might jist as well ha' fought against a steam engine: an' Are minutes after, he was stondiV, pantin,' like a mad dog, an' us white as chalk, before Billy an' the big chair. 44-There was a scuffle o' feet -as we all gathered round, an' 4Silence,' roars Billy, then buttons his coat, clears his throat, an' lookin' for all the world as if he was the judge at the assizes, begins his speech. 44 You'd be waitin' for your flippers,1' said James, 44 if I tried to come to the end of all Billy Brody gave out in that speech of his. 'Twos as good u pieco o' work as ever came to my oars; an* twas as good u piece o* banter as ever Jop heurd, that I'll swear to. Not a word did Billy siy about what was comin*. Och, not one. Not a word did Billy say about Jop'6 story, an' the way people took it in Clogheeu. Och, not one. Not a threat did Billy make, not au oath cams from Lim, not au angry word crossed bis lips. What he said, dang my eyes if I remember u syllable; an' yet, somehow, we all felt we'd rather bs trainpin* a treadmill nor standin* in Jop's shoes. Och, Billy had powerful gifts—power ful gifts. It's wonderful to thiuk o' the way he Raid nothin' that night, an' cut Jop to the quick wi* it. 14 At last out from his pocket Billy takej one o' the books Jop had nia name in, wen hi* flnger, turns over for a while, then hold the book open before Jop's" face,' an* say Billy:4 Joseph Hanly,' says lie, 'd'ye deny or don't ye, that your hand wrote what ye se afore ytmr two eyes?* 1 "Why,1 o* course wrote it,' answers Jop, i smart an' quick lik that; dang ye, can't ye see I did?
