ADA. From a M.S. Poem. This afternoon I walkt a path, which led me by the soothing streams, That ever mingle with your voice, and murmur through my way- ward dreams. The waters gurgled at my feet, the sunshine rippled round the shore, But I was burdened with a sense of calmer days that are no more, And wearied with a wildering thought of thoughts which may not kindle now, As in the time when first you flung your wild delights from brow to brow! And lo the Past grew sad and strange, by gloomy lights and shadows crost, And much it vext my soul to think of all that had been lov'd and lost! Oh! must I always live alone; and wilt thou never come again, To kiss this silence from my lips--to take the darkness from my brain? Two hours ago I heard a tale, within a langhing banquet room, That drove my soul ten thousand miles, and left it in a foreign tomb! O! weary, wasted, wretched, years! O! heart, without a resting- place: O! grief, too hard and hot for tears--O! hopes, as dead as Ada's face! Look down, dear Saint, for lo! my thoughts, like ghosts, are flitting round the turf, That hides thee in--that shuts me out--the stony, grasping, envious, earth! My life, my idol, lost! O lost! beyond my arms, beyond my reach; And I am like the wave that swoons, all beat and broken, down the beach! A sweet wind through the casement steals, with drifts of balm--I thank thee, God, That woodland eyes are guarding her, and hands, unseen, still dress the sod.
