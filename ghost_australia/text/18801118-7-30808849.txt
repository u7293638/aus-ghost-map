The Advertiser. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1880. IT is definitely intimated that at the con-<*> ference on the border duties shortly to be held in Melbourne the Treasurer and Mr. G. S. Fowler, M.P., will represent this -colony. The selection of Mr. Fowler is ture to be generally approved. His special acquaintance with the questions proposed to be discussed and his high reputation in the mercantile world peculiarly fit him for the position. South Australians may consequently leave their interests with con fidence in the hands of the delegates ni.med, with thej consciousness indeed that they will not consent to anything that would tend to retard our gradual progress towards a policy of uu 'qualitiod free interchange. In holding t:itir own, while prudently endeavoruu i,> t-ffect a mutually acceptable coui romise, our representatives will have :.t least the support of the New South Wales delegates, both of whom are pro i ouuced freetraders. The main dillLulty wiil arise with Victoria, the present <_i j \\.rument of which colony is most unlikely "••> jield term* liberal euough to constitute i .'.'■ basis of a permanent arrangement. U •a ill be an agreeable surprise to l"ttrn that in anticipating this draw- Iwck to successful negotiation we have erred, for then the lirst effective blow will hive been delivered at protection in the J.eighboring province, which has too long submitted to a mischievous, harassing, aud injurious n'«cal system. It is to be lepretted that (Queensland is not included in tbe invitation to confer, but if her pre- Knee would have the effect of com- I'iicaling negotiations at the initial .-!age her absence must prove &□ ad jutage. While, however, this view uuiy be taken of her non-participation in the deliberations on fiscal matters it does, i.ot hold good of the exclusion of <}ueeus land when projecte for the federation of tbe colonies are mooted, for no real union of tbe provinces can be brought abjut unless t,iueenbUnd is a party 10 it. Her isolition could not be justilied on grounds either of iutereet or policy. But, after all, this is a t-übject which should not be mixed up with tbe tariff question, although it is patent tbut fiscal union must accompany if it doe 6 cot precede Australian federation. Previous attempts to adjust Lti t > tiioal relations of the three colonies now con cerned have been at tbe most only partially t-ucc4jfcsful, while on the whole they have Wen alike disappointing and discouraging. Tbe maintenance of hostile tariffs between them is a standing proof of this. Between this colony aud New South Wales a con vention, as all are aware, existed until it wae terminated some months ago in a atber brusque fashion by the mother >ol.'iiy. At the time we deilt with ihe disagreement which led to the lecaatiou of the couveution, and it would eerve i-o useful purpw to retail the vexatious incidents of the dis pute. While the tariff regulations endure New South Wales has a perfect right to ?tk for better terms as a commutation iv lieu of the collection of taxes on the South Australian border. One-half of the sister colony's imports overland from this colony are dutiable articles, whereas bet exports are almost wholly raw material. Jieaide* tbe growing traffic and the increased dutie 6 on wines aad spirits now levied by New South Wales manifestly necessitate a fresh cbtrventioa. On the other hand, the trade between this colony and Victoria orerland 'is comparatively slight, and has not led to' any serious or acrimonious differences. ISevertheless, it would be a decided adran t«Lre to have business relations (irmly placed •Hi a freer footing. The attitude ,of Vic toria towards New South Wales is, how tvor, most unsatisfactory. The New South Walts Statistical Register for ltiTO shows tliui in spite of the border Customs duties there was a large trade done last year between them—the exports being about fuur-iifths as much as those to Eng land. From this it may ,bo as sumed that the removal of alt reetrictious would give a strong impetus to tbe development of their commerce. But instead of events moving iv that direction tbey have been operating contrariwise. Victoria continues steadfast to an obstruc tive cour6e although it is uotorious that she is a heavy loser. The receipts for the last quarter record a large increase of revenue iv all the colonies except Victoria, where a falling back is shown. In the face of this significant warning she unfortu nately adheres to a policy which not only checks her natural progress but endangers the prospect of a reciprocally advantageous understanding with ber neighbors. Tbe policy pursued when protection ooce tales root goes far beyond die professed in te?tiona of its advocates. The fostering of native industries becomes in the end the maintenance of these in their decrepitude Instead of withdrawing aid which has been altogether unavailing die plan Is to extend the protectionist area bo v to embrace within it other industries originally left to shift for themselves. Thus the farmer who , complains of the oppressive taxation which bears him down is blandly assured that he will be made all right by measures adapted in his exclusive interest. The products of the soil of neighboring colonies will be laid under a heavy embargo in order that he may be able to grow what is required in Victoria and obtain enhanced prices for his articles* C .ttle from New South Wales, oats from New Zealand, maize from Queensland will all be met at the Customs-Houses by duties sufficient to prevent their undue interference with the local farmers 1 industry. This is actually the line followed just now by the Victorian protectionists; yet as a class the farmers are not grateful for the presumed concessions. They would infinitely prefer the removal of the obnoxious duties laid upon every article they wear and on all the implements they require to use. They are able in support of their preference to appeal to the unprofitable character of the existing imports, which are burdensome to the consumer without being remune rative to the Government. Further, it is easy though perhaps vain to remind the protectionists that the restrictive tariff was not intended to limit intercolonial trade, the avowed object being to protect struggling manufacturers against the cheap labor and abundance of countries oversea. In regard, again, to the arguments urged in the hope of convincing them of the de sirability of a policy meant to benefit them, the farmers may point to the inconsistency of Mr. Berry's statement that a stock tax while ensuring better prices to graziers would also cheapen the price of meat. The absurdity of this dual contention is pal pable. It is said, too, that " the farmer's products which have been taxed already are now cheaper than they are in the neigh boring colonies." If this be the case then the farmers who demand higher rates for their produce cannot expect to secure them in a market cheapened by the operation of protectionist taxes. But while there is no certainty that the Victorian fanners and graziers can be benefited by these vexatious exactions there is incontestable proof of the mischief they must perforce do 10 adjoining provinces willing to trade with Victoria. Moreover, between these artificial buffers the hapless consumer is ruthlessly crushed. Take for instance the (iit'y on maize, which cannot be grown at a l«j inp price in Victoria. It is virtually a Ucx on carters, cabmen, draymen, and tiLert whose livelihood depends on horse wo;k. Its imposition must raisa the price <>f the feed, and perhaps keep out the '.'teeniland article j but in the latter case 11 does not help the revenue, while at any rule it must prove a burden on a class il xble to afford the impost. Iv his Budge: t-pecchMr. Berry admitted that protective duties were oot a eource of income to the Treasury. He accounted for this by stating that as production in the colony increased there was less need to import com modities; jet be did not venture to say that under this fiscal system the con sumers ware heavily taxed without bene iiting the Government. On this it has been well observed— '* The prices are taxation prices, but there is no revenue. The im ]>ot>t is operative against the consumer, but it ie not operative for the Treasurer. The head of the household pays as much, or nearly as much, as if the goods were taxed on coming into the colony, and yet he has not contributed to the cost of government- If, as the protectionist allegee, prices have come down and the consumer is charged no more than he would be under freetrade au.-pievs, then the duties can be removed; bat if that course were proposed every pro tectionist voice would be raised in opposi tion."' In entering into a conference with a colony pledged to such a policy the South Australian representatives must be pre dated to encounter a hardened prejudice ngaiust free trade. Should that haply hi overcome then there will be no insur mountable obstacle in the way of the desired end. It may be presumed, however, that they are not san^uinu of the attain ment of ao beneficial a u-sult. The v cannot but be aware that a uniform tariff must prectde the adoption of absolutely free interchange. The Cuttoms-Houses on the Murray cannot be swept away until an ?j;ieemeut iclative to thb imposts levied en jroods lauded at the seaport \& established. Either Victoria mua lnv<r her fiscal barriers or the ..ilur 1 colonies must raise theirs before .-.vi *i A eoDsammation caa be reached. Th r"oiu.er i.-> po£srble*but extremely improba tie; the latter ie neither probable nor poieible. All that apparently remains, then, is to arrange conventions on equitable terms, so that every trader will not be challenged to pay toll when he crosses the frontiers. This step in itself would be a (.■ain in &o; far as it would be mi advance towards a better un derstanding in the future that mi^ht eventually lead to the complete abroga tiuu of intercolonial duties. Foil some years past^ difficult Alpine tuscente have been among the sensational in cidents of the English autumn. This year tLe most striking thing we have heard of has been an ascent, not difficult in itself, but so difficult under the circumstances that most people would have pronounced it impossible. Mr. F. J. Campbell, a man totally blind, has got. to the top of Mout Blanc. We can remember when this would hare been thought a great feat for any one with all his senses to perform, common as it has since become. When Coleridge and Shelley wrote their ode on Chamouni, no Kngtiehman had attempted the ascent. Mont Blanc was only known as the symbol of an awful and unapproach able majesty and sublimity. But a Frenchman at length got to the top, and that was quite enough. Englishmen were not poing to be beaten. Not only English men but even women have since performed what was once considered a difficult and daring feat. Then came Albert Smith and his exhibition. To Mr. Whymper and his fraternity of Alpine climbers Mont Blanc belongs to the remote past It is an ascent in which the yourig beginner may try his prowess, but if lie "would graduate in the art with the higher honors he must turn to those heights on which the climber will not only require greater endurance but be exposed to more formidable dangers. Yet the fact tbat for so many years no one had attempted Moot Blanc is a sufficient proof that, though by way of com parison it may be called easy, it presents actual difficulties requiring in the climber not only all his censes but considerable education in the use of them. In the his tory of Alpine adventure it is a notable if an eccentric incident that in the year 1880 this feat has been performed by a man deficient in that sense which, next to touch, is the most essential of all. It is reasonable to ask the question, What could possess & blind man to attempt the ascent ? If he wanted merely to do a difficult thing as a test of his own skill and powers of endurance were there not other things lying more clearly in his own way more congruous with his physical con dition ? If a man has got eyes in his head and a soul capable of being affected by the beautiful or the sublime, the splendor of an Alpine sunrise may well tempt him to undergo the toil and encounter the j risks of a mountain, ascent. Or if he j has scientific objects in view, such as those ! contemplated by Professor Forbes or Pro fessor Tyndall, in that case alsa we see an intelligible motive. Bat« blind man while he climbs is in the dark, and when he has reached the summit he is still in the dark. The wondrous roseate light—"the crimson and fire, the amber and rose" that" tonch with life and with, glory the Alpine snows"—what can he know of them? Still less could he perform any function of scientific observation. Was Mr. Camp bell, then, merely intent on creating a sensation —on catching for himself the ephemeral distinction which waits on a man who does a thing hitherto condderei impracticable ? We cannot read his narra tive of the ascent without seeing that he may have had a far higher motive. The enthusiasm on behalf of the blind, as a class, which he had shown on other occa sions was the ?ni?nnting principle in tfria instance also. He wished the blind to understand that the • loss of one sense does not seclude them so much as might be supposed from the common occupations or enterprises of men. In his preparation for his exploit he .sensibly paid due regard to all the practical conditions of success. He did not intend merely to be helpless in the i bands of others, he meant to nse his own muscles, his own lungs, and hid own senses as far as they would go. Therefore during the previous season he eet himself to prac tise Alpine climbing on various mountain heights and among glaciers; and during this last season he went into careful training. I\\\ hen he made the ascent he took every precaution for aafety. Besides the skilled -uidea be took with him his son, whom he immedi&teiy; followed, and whose raore ments his quickened sense of bearing would readily identify. He literally felt for himself on the ice every step he took, and a* truly: nude tae assert for hoxKlf as any Edfelahman does who has i the apfiirtance of guides. He not only made his way to the top, but in tha descent shared with the rett in the pleasure of the (fliitade. He.describes himself as doing-, this with the guide's arm in one hand, and* Lis alpi&ettock; in hk other. Such a use of the alpineatock implies « great deal. Trained by practice, touch in fact became a tind of second sight. On returning to his ordinary pursuits at the RoyalCollegeforthe Blind, *t Norwo3d, we can imagine with what confidence after 1 such an exploit Mr. Campbell would en courage his fellow-sufferers to rely on the fesses left to them. If a blind man can ascend Mont Blanc, a blind man can do almost anything. That seems the intended, moral of the story. When a chance fron i shot deprived Mr. Fawcett of his sight, he did not lose heart, but took his degree, was called to the bar, performed his duties of Professor of Political Economy at Can bridge, and in his parliamentary and political career has held his own Against men who could see. In Mr. Campbell we have an other example of that force and energy of character which triumph over difficulties; and of this the Alpine adventure is merely one illustration. His narrative is sugges tive of something as to tho relative value | of the several senses as factors in the great result of human happiness. The lot of the ' I blix.d is much leas hapless than that of the deaf. Even nature is not wholly a blank to them. They can hear its murmur if they cannot ccc its light. They can touch and fee), and the thrill of sympathy brings them into true report with the world without Tbe mirth and the melody and the patho* of speech are theirs, in common with the i rest of men. But all this is lost to tbe deaf. The sight of the play of feature in others but whets a curiosity to know the/ meaning of it all, and their eagerness ta kcow can never be satisfied. The Mind man's life may he one of social happiness tbat uf the deaf is utter loneliness.
