; NEHUSHTAN. in the history of the brazen serpent there is a lesson of solemn and instructive import (2 King xviii. 4). The tendency of our minds is €V61!\ to substitute tile mfiariR fni« the And tn rest in the visible and material, losing sight of the invisible and spiritual. This was the origin of idolatry, and is the origin of all modern"ritualism. The brazen serpent that had been an instrument of salvation in the days of Moses (Num. xxi. 4-9), became an object of idolatry in the dayB of Hezekiab. In Moses' days it was a means, in Hezekiah's it became an end. Thus it is, by the perver sion of the fleshly mind, that which God ordained as a channel, we come to regard a3a fountain of blessing virtually superseding Himself. It is probable that the worship of the brazen serpent began in the idolatrous reign of Ahaz, the father of Hezekiab. Ophiolatry, or serpent worship, prevailed in the surrounding nations, and this would naturally dispose Israel, ever ready to depart from the God of their fathers, to worship the brazen serpent still preserved in their dim notion. Hezekiab, in righteous indignation, broke the object of their idolatry, ana calle 1 it Nchushtan, a piece of brass. It had answered its end, and ceased to have any moral significance. We do not possess the literal oross upon which our Redeemer was nailed, and if we did it would be no better than Hezekiah's Nchushtan', yet by what multitudes amongst us is the mere siyn of the cross substituted for the doctrines of salva tion i The magical power of the siyn super sedes with them the truth nreaehed in the power of the Holy Ghost. — C.
