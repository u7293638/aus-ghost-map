TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-In your issue of tim 2 (iii instant it is stated that the president of the Church of England Association strongly condemned the Kilburn Sisters for inculcating (better alia) the necessity of confession and the priest's pov. er of absolution But what must an impartial public think of the President's severity of censure, if it can be proved that the blisters are right, and that the president and his association are wrong? And there is really no difficulty whatever in furnishing such proof-a land of proof that cannot be safely challenged either by the president and his association 01 by the much discussed sisters As professed members of the Church of England, the president and IIIB association, equally with the Kilburn Sisters accept, as an unimpeachable authority the Book of Common Prij 01 It, therefore, follows that, if we would do justice as between the respective disputants, we must see what the Book of Common Prayer has to say no to 0 matter in the Communion service we find that it distinctly incul- cates confession, and promises absolution In the ordination service the Bishop is required to say to him who " received the order of priesthood, " receive the Holy Ghost, whose sins thou dost forgive they are forgiven, and whose sins thou dost retain they are retained " And, in order that there may be no possibility of mistake as to the exact meaning of those words, we find in the service for the " Visitation of the Sick " the following words - After which confession the most shall absolve him," using the words (which she), '* I absolve thee from all thy sins " I Do the Kilburn Sisters go beyond this of I think I not And if they do not, by what right do the pre- I sident and his association denounce them as guilty of grave ecclesiastical wrong teaching ? It is manifest, that the sisters are right according to the Book of Common Player, and it is equally manifest that the president and his association are wrong according to the Book of Common Prayer I If, however, the president and his association are of opinion that the line of teaching adopted by the Kilburn Sisters leads direct to some if they are of opinion that such teaching is digging the grave of the Church of England, and that it is driving out from the Church the thinking portion of the various congregations, the men who would gladly spend and be spent in the service of the church and if they are of opinion that such teaching is aggressively opposed to true Protestantism, then, in that case, let the president and his association cease from mischievously stirring up strife and butt raCEs for no possible advantage, and let them devote all their (at present misapplied) energies in striving to bring about the one only possible remedying a revision of the Book of Common Prayer The word 6 revision" to be distinctly understood as moa. um g (1), a reverential revision of the Book of Common Prayer on a thoroughly Protestant and anti Ritualistic bassis, (2), a removal from the Prayer Book of the word "priest," and of everything that the word " priest" implies or is assumed to imply and (d) the removal from the prayer book of everything that implies, or that can be assumed to imply, that the minister obtains, by the rite of ordination, the power to forgive sins, or in fact any spiritual power whatever differing in kind or degree from what may be possessed by the humblest member of his congregation If the president and his association have the courage to adopt this programme, then they will be in stifled in calling attention to the teachings of the Lilburn Slaters, but, if they will not adopt that programme, in all its entirety, then let them cease, once and for ever from blaming those who are teaching women and children on the lines expressly laid down in the Book of Common Prayer I am, c, October 25.
