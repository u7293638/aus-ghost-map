LONDON WEEK BY WEEK (By Emily Soldene.) London, February 2. Well, last Friday morning we were in the seventh heaven — last Friday evening we were in the seventh other place. What a debacle! We came down with a run, didn’t we? Such a nice name too — “Spion Kop.” * * * * A modern rendering of the old nursery tale of the great king, who “marched his men right up the hill; then marched them down again.” * * * * But there’s plenty of fight left in the old man. Buller is a real British bulldog, as Lord Rosebery (at this moment the most respected man in the country) said in his great patriotic speech, “They’ve not done with old England yet.” * * * * Tuesday brought everybody up with a round turn. Opening of Parliament. “Ah!” said the busy-body-know-everything. “Now you’ll see. Pretty goings on. They’ll be shown up. Look at the lies about Sir William Butler. He’ll be vindicated. Look at the Intelligence Department. Look at the War Office” (as a matter of fact we “have” been looking at that day by day for weeks). “Hear what’s said about the guns. Didn’t Chamberlain back up the Raid? Of course he did. Don’t everybody know it? Of course they do. They’ll have them out, I tell you. The whole bloomin’ lot. Serve ’em right, too.” * * * * “Not out” up to date. * * * * A dreadful day Tuesday — grey and cold. The sort of day to nip in the bud the most ardent patriot — bitter wind — the few leaves left on the trees came skirling off — the river thick and misty — the Terrace made one’s teeth chatter only to look upon it. Everybody glancing up at the heavy low-down sky, thought “snow;” no, only mist. * * * * The house full of shadows — moving shadows — hurrying figures — some anxious people — not many — most people going about their business with un conscious British calm. * * * * Funny thing. Mr. Chamberlain, who, perhaps, didn’t fancy a possible reception, was very early. He wore a frigid, rigid expression — a pair of frow- ning brows — his eyeglass— and a lovely orchid. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach looked awfully cross and rather spiteful. Sir William Harcourt sat heavy, ponderous, melancholy. Why wasn’t “Lulu” near to cheer him? * * * * Mr. Balfour came late, and had a big, rousing. rolling cheer. He lit the scene. Everybody felt happier. * * * * Captain Pretyman (such a name!), wearing the uniform of the Artillery Volunteers, moved the Address. Mr. Pike Pease (another name), M.P. for Darlington, seconded it. P. P. is a Quaker, and appeared in the scarlet uniform of a Deputy Lieutenant (enough to make Charles James Fox turn in his grave), and, the spirit moving him, spoke well and bravely about the war (another turn for C. J. F.), and didn’t say “thee” and “thou,” but just “you” and “I” — like you and I. (I wonder is that lucid — likewise Lindley Mur- ray?) * * * * Also I wonder is Charles James Fox right for the first Quaker man? If not, please correct. * * * * Poor Mr. P. P.! “C. B.” got at him, and pre- sented us with an elegant epigram — congratulating P. P. on belonging to a family not “tied to any lazy uniformity of political ideas.” * * * * Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman scored, and in spite of the serious situation the Radical benches rolled over one another with delight and shouts of laughter. * * * * Naturally the Ministerial side considered this exhibition, “bad form.” * * * * The Prince of Wales, Duke of Connaught, and Duke of Cambridge were present at the sitting of the Lords, taking their usual seats on the cross benches. * * * * In the Peeresses’ Gallery were the Duchess of Connaught, Duchess of Bedford, Duchess of De- vonshire, Duchess of Somerset, Countesses of Shaftesbury, Romney, Jersey, Halsbury, De la Warr, Carrington, Arran, Hopetoun, etc. * * * * In the Ladies’ Gallery of the House of Commons the Duchess of Beaufort, Lady Harcourt, Lady Lucy Hicks-Beach, Mrs. and Miss Chamberlain, Lady Charles Beresford, Lady Frances Balfour, Lady Betty Balfour, Lady Beatrice Pretyman, Mrs. Gully, Mrs. Pike Pease, etc. * * * * A fine front row of silks and satins, I can tell you; also waves of perfume like unto Arabia’s spicy breezes. * * * * Tuesday morning the “Daily Mail” came out with an announcement that in view of the great importance of the coming parliamentary session, they had engaged Mr. T. P. O’Connor as their par- liamentary journalist. * * * * “All his many admirers will be aware that his parliamentary report for this journal ‘will be free from political bias.’ ” * * * * That’s very satisfactory for the “admirers,” but — “There are others.” * * * * Tuesday afternoon a largely attended meeting of all sections of the Irish Nationalists took place at the House of Commons. The meeting was held in committee-room 16— not “15”— (15 being prob- ably full of ghosts). * * * * Mr. T. Harrington presided, and among those present were: Mr. John Dillon, Mr. T. M. Healy, Mr. John Redmond, Mr. John Parnell, Mr. Field, Mr. Donal Sullivan, Mr. MacAlese, Mr. T. D. Sul- livan, Mr. Daly, Captain Donelan, Mr. Flynn, Mr. M. Healy, Mr. Pat O’Brien, Mr. Clancy, Mr. J. F. O’Brien, Mr. T. Curran, Mr. W. Redmond, Mr. Arthur O’Connor, and Mr. T. P. O’Connor. * * * * Mr. Redmond, who was received with great ap- plause, said: “For the first time since the Union the power of England had been seriously menac- ed. Her prestige, which had protected her so- long, was almost shattered, and no man living could tell what might arise out of the present si- tuation. Therefore the power of eighty Nation- alist members acting together might in the future be enormous in furthering the interests of Ire- land.” * * * * He moved that — “In the name of Ireland, we declare at an end the divisions which have hitherto separated the Irish Nationalist repre- sentatives, and we hereby form ourselves into one united party in accordance with the princi- ples and under the constitution, of the Irish Par- liamentary party from 1885 to 1895.” * * * * Mr. Dillon considered that some indication should be given before the party was reunited of the attitude which it intended to adopt towards the United League organisation in Ireland. * * * * The chairman appealed to Mr. Dillon not to pro- ceed with his line of argument. * * * * Mr. T. Curran no doubt thought a lot — but didn’t say “nuffin.” * * * * Mr. T. P. O’Connor (“Tay Pay”) failed to see in what way the united party would come into antagonism with the United Irish League. * * * * The resolution, seconded by Dr. Commins, was, carried unanimously. * * * * This is all very nice and Nationalistic and bro- therly—not exactly loyal. Still, what I want to know —Is this the sort of association for a gen- tleman commissioned by a great daily journal to write parliamentary reports and impressions warranted “free from all political bias” — political bias whatever? * * * * Probable state of the House: — Conservatives 333, Liberal Unionists 66—399; Radicals 188. Irish. Nationalists 71, Parnellites 11— 270; the Speaker, 1; Ministerial majority, 129. It most not be forgotten there are twenty Minis- terial, men “at the front.” But I hear the Irish Party will not vote on the motion of censure * * * * “The young duke,” his youthful Grace of West- minster, came home last Saturday; went straight down to see his mother, Countess Grosvenor, at Saighton Grange, Chester; came up to town last night; is doing the rounds; and will sail away for South Africa to-morrow (Saturday), having been appointed on Lord Roberts’s Staff. - * * * * It’s quite an open secret that the late gran’pa sent his heir to the Cape to cure him of a love affair. Everybody is anxious to know how it will end. Will he be true? The old story, “He loves me, he loves me not.” People who know the young duke have no hesitation in saying, now he has come to his own, he will certainly marry “the girl of his heart;” but not till after the war. * * * * Born in. Bend Or’s year, the boy got the nick- name of Bend Or; and it sticks to him still. He’s nice- looking. Not what you call handsome; not one of Ouida’s own; hot a “beauty;” but a well set up, well-groomed young Englishman; with fair hair, brushed well off his forehead, clear bright eyes; great cheeriness and kindness of manner; gay, and of good companie. * * * * His Grace has rather a weakness for sartorial perfection— is always faultlessly dressed. * * * * Gran’pa used to keep him rather short of the ready ; and, in spite of the great stable at Eaton Hall, when the young Lord Belgrave wanted to go a-hunting, he had to hire his horses at the livery stables, Chester; and when he dined with the duke, at the Hall, a cab was sent to take him back to Saighton Grange. * * * * Funny old things some of these gran’pa’s are— ain’t they? I’ve known several men in my time who didn’t overlove their heirs. * * * * The Queen— who is quite a matchmaker, and de- lights in a love story— had Mr. George Wyndham, Under-Secretary for War, “commanded” to Os- borne the other day. To talk about the war? Not at all. To talk about “Bend Or,” and was he going to engage himself to the lovely young lady aforesaid? Mr. Wyndham — one of the hand- somest of men — married the Countess Grosvenor, and is consequently the young duke’s stepfather. * * * * I hear Lord Ampthill — some time private secre- tary to Mr. Chamberlain— has been offered the Governorship of Victoria. Why, he’s brother-in- law to your own Lord Beauchamp. That will be nice. Still, if your own L. B. is thinking of “chucking his job,” it won’t be so nice as it pos- sibly might have been. * * * * Lord Ampthill is very good business — an up-to- date modern young man, six feet four in his stockings; a prize moustache, and such a com- plexion! * * * * Thirty-one years old — rides, drives (four in hand), boxes, rows, shoots, and makes a splendid speech. * * * * Of course the speech-making will be uphill work after Lord Brassey. * * * * Lord Ampthill is the grandson of the ninth Duke of Bedford. His father, Lord Odo Russell, a distinguished diplomat, Ambassador at Berlin many years, was created Lord Ampthill. His mo- ther, the Dowager Lady Ampthill, is the close and dear friend of the Queen. * * * * Lady Ampthill is a beautiful lady, with wonder- ful black hair, and a classic profile. She rules in an ultra exclusive aristocratic set, and is not at all “smart.” * * * * “The ‘Daily Telegraph’ Shilling Fund” to date — 2,282,408. “Absent-minded Beggar,” up to Monday, re- ceived £71,000; paid away, £50,000. * * * * Everybody has heard of buttons being found in the church “collection” boxes. At Twickenham the other evening, at a patriotic concert, a sol- dier’s button found its way to the “little tam- bourine.” It was put up to auction, and knock ed down to the “Twickenham Rugby Football Club,” £5 10s. * * * * Fancy! “Five Absent-mindful Beggars” at Coo- gea sending 5 guineas for the “Absent-minded Beggar’s Fund.” I wonder are these five camp- ing out, or fishing, or staying at the hotel? In any mind’s eye I can see the rippling bay — a full moon, the steamer coming round the point from Melbourne or somewhere; I feel the warm, soft air. A woman is singing; not a bad voice, and sings very well, and across the hotel lawn come bounding and barking some lovely collies, prize ones, you know. And really? Why, so it is — Mr. Dobbie, with them. * * * * If everybody else seems out of sorts, the Ord- nance Department preserves its sense of humor, its hilarity, its airy persiflage. * * * * Replying to the complaint that the “back sights of the Lee-Enfield rifles are so inaccurate that it is necessary to aim six feet clear of the target if you want to hit it,” the department says: * * * * “So much depends upon the personal qualities of the soldier using it, and upon the temperature, force, and direction of the wind, that it becomes the duty of every man to study these conditions, and to learn what corrections to make in aiming.” * * * * A good sort of preparation for going into action. * * * * A rifle maker writes to the “St. James’s Ga- zette:” “The few rifles that do happen to shoot straight, are generally found to have faulty wood foreparts, the warping of which has counteracted the faulty sighting of the barrel. * * * * That’s where the doctrine of compensation comes in! “Ha! Ha!” * * * * The Yeomanry found it out. The test shooting was bad, and the misses were all to the right. Some scientific individual connected with the War Office determined that as the bullet drifts slightly to the left of the point of aim at 1000yards, it was desirable to place the barleycorn of the foresight considerably to the left of the centre of the barrel. * * * * Here’s the chance for the man who never hits anything he aims at. * * * * They had a high old time in Ladysmith cater- ing for Christmas. Turkeys, geese, and suck- ing pigs, £2 10s each; whisky, £5 to £7 a bottle; eggs, 10s 7d per dozen; jam, 3s 6d per lb; cucum- bers, 1s 9d each; apples, 2s 6d for fifty; potatoes, 24s per 25lb; tomatoes, 4½d each; vegetable mar- rows, 2s 9d each; carrots, 3s 1d per small bunch; beetroot, 2s 6d per bunch; grapes, 1s a plate; pears, 2s a plate; chillies, 6d a plate; and ra- dishes, 6d a bunch. * * * * Well, I’ve paid 25 cents. a bunch for radishes in Leadville, U.S.A., a mining city you may have heard of, and a few of you no doubt have seen. * * * * Walking down the Strand Wednesday I came on a stack of folding (steamer) chairs built up out- side a shop which supplies such comforts to the poor traveller. Like everything and everybody else, they were “going to the front” — chairs for officers to take five bars’ rest “after the battle, mother.” If the Boers get a sight of them they will think the British are not only going to “sit tight,” but “have come to stay.” * * * * There’s a new deal with the South African. S.S. Companies — the two companies, the Union and Castle, amalgamate, the title to be the “Union- Castle Mail Steamship Company, Limited.” The Castle takes over the liabilities of the Union. The nominal capital to be £2,000,000. The object is to provide, for the more efficient working of the South African trade, and the mail contract which the companies have made with the Cape Govern- ment for ten years from next October. The direc- torates also combine; Sir Francis Evans, man- aging director of the Union, joining the firm of Donald Currie and Company. * * * * Miss Nellie Stewart’s continued illness necessi- tates her retirement as principal boy at Drury Lane. It is announced that Miss Violet Cameron will fill her place. * * * * Mr. Robert Loraine, actor, has brought an ac tion against Mrs. Florence Waller, actress and manager, for breach of contract. Mr. Loraine was the jeune premier, and got £30 per week. Mrs. Waller says he “mumbled,” didn’t attend rehear- sals, assaulted other members of the company, etc. Plaintiff denies all this. Action adjourned sine die, plaintiff having joined the Montgomery Corps of Yeomanry, which sails to-morrow for Africa. * * * * Albany-street, Regent’s Park, was up in arms last Friday. Albany-street is full of nursemaids, ladies’ maids, lodging-houses, dressmakers, and the thousand and one functionaries that out of the fads of the fair recluses of St. John’s Wood make a profitable living. * * * * In Albany-street are the Albany Barracks. Al- bany-street is proud of its barracks, and the in- mates thereof — things of beauty and joys for ever, or as nearly as can be for ever. Close to the barracks is the park— the nursemaid’s paradise; and though the “absent-minded” one may be of a roving disposition he is always in evidence; never out of the picture; and if a bit off with one pram, he simply changes the venue— devotes him- self to another. * * * * Smart-looking chap he is, too. Well got up; scarlet-striped pants, fitting to perfection; a strap beneath the boot, a bright rowel on the heel, the short jacket, the row of bright buttons, the natty cap at an angle of 45, the well-pomaded curl upon his “forrid,” to say nothing of his little malacca cane, his thrown out chest, and the extra fall in the back. * * * * Well, last Friday the Imperial Yeomanry were at the Albany Barracks, inspected by the Hon. Colonel H.R.H. the Prince of Wales. The men, who had come up from Windsor, though not fully equipped, looked fit and well and full of enthu- siasm. The guard was kept by a contingent of Life Guards, and as the khaki clad ones filed in the band began to play. * * * * Bucks Yeomanry, Berks Yeomanry, Middlesex Company, Oxfordshire — 800 men in all. * * * * A fearful crush. 4000 people wanted to get in. Only 250 admissions possible. Lots of ladies; and, towering above everybody, Captain Ames, of the 2nd Life Guards — tallest man in the British Army. * * * * People who were here for the Jubilee will re- member Captain Ames in the procession. How- ever tall the list, he’s the fellow that can’t be missed. * * * * The Prince drove into the barracks at 11 a.m. precisely, wearing the undress uniform of a General of the Staff and a huge military overcoat (beastly morning, you know), was delighted with the men; walked up and down with Lord Chesham, followed by the staff; congratulated everybody; made a speech; “wished he was going himself.” “Cheers!” “Cheers for the Queen;” “Cheers for the Prince;” for everything and everybody. The officers were presented. The Prince shook hands with them, then requested the presence of Trooper Patrick Campbell, and Mrs. “Pat’s.” bet- ter half stepped up at the salute. * * * * The Prince shook hands with Mr. Campbell; told him he had heard of his good service in the Matabele War, and felt convinced that with his perfect knowledge of the difficult country he would be invaluable to his company, to his Queen, and country. * * * * Trooper Campbell is now sergeant. * * * * Going down to Windsor races Monday to restock my glove box, and see, as it turned out, a “dead cert.” romp in seventh. The first thing on view outside the station was Sergeant “Pat” and a party of the boys on duty waiting for some horses coming up or down the line. Such a jolly crowd. * * * * After the horses were corralled, Sergeant Pat and a few choice spirits came along to the course, spotted a winner or two, landed a fiver, and we all celebrated at the White Hart— before for home and a nice little dinner at the “Trocadero.” * * * * Must dine and wine these boys before they start, you know. * * * * The Troc’ is a wonderful place — run by Lyons, Limited — stands where the old Argyle Rooms stood; has a band and no end of 6ft 4in attendants; gilding and decorations galore; soundless carpets, a splendid salle a manger, with little tables a quatre; fruit, flowers, elec- tric lights. Lovely ladies — some monde, some not quite — the latest toilettes, the smartest hats, a grill room always crammed, a never-ending procession of diners and dined up and down- stairs like ants. To get a table at the Troc’, one must “wine” or “ring up” in the morning. Good menu; magnificent chef, and a wine list for the gods. * * * * How things, and places, and people change ! In my time, at the Philharmonic, Islington, “Old Lyons” used to put down the carpets and hang up the curtains (by contract, new ones every six months). Now “Lyons Limited” sends the Tommies plum puddings by the ton; breakfasts 15,000 troops without turning a hair; turns out a fromage souffle or a Lord Mayor’s banquet in ten minutes. “Alle same ” Lyons. * * * * Talk about “The Advanced Woman,” “Pet- ticoat Government,” “Woman’s Fran- chise” (my love to Miss Rose Scott, softest- voiced and most determined of women), “Equal- ity of the Sexes,” etc., etc., why the Anglo-Saxon is not in it, and the lady Mayor down in New Zealand who ruled the aldermen out of court and the common council with a rod of iron, is not a circumstance with that daughter of the sun, the Dowager Empress of China. (Shouldn’t be at all surprised if she took off Quong Tart’s button). Still, I’m half afraid tbe Dowager, like other folk I know, will find her Spion Kop “untenable.” * * * * At Guy’s Hospital the other day an inquest was held on the body of Catherine Kelly, the daughter of a laborer. The father was called to give evi- dence. The Coroner: Was she married? Witness: I beg your pardon, sir. The Coroner: I mean she was a single girl? Witness: Oh, yes; she was single; of course she was. The Coroner: What was her age last birthday? Witness: She was two years and nine months old when she died. The Coroner: Oh, ah! Yes, yes. I see now. Next witness, please. * * * * What the lady at the “lending library” near Brantwood knew of Ruskin: “Th’ people about there didn’t trouble much about him. As for her- self she only knew him as ‘the old gentleman who only had a clean collar once a week.’ ” * * * * Such a life. Such an obituary. * * * * £5000 already subscribed for the Bushmen’s Corps Fund. Subscriptions can be sent to the Bank of New South Wales, Old Broad-street, London. * * * * “I started at the bottom and climbed up,” said the old gentleman. “But it’s much pleasanter tobogganing,” said the spendthrift son. * * * * Lady at the door: “I believe, in my heart, you are the same tramp I gave a large piece of Christ- mas pudding to a few days ago.” Tramp: “No, ma’am. He’s dead.” * * * * “My daughter has a great ear for music.” “Well, that wouldn’t be so bad if she didn’t think she had a voice for it, too.”
