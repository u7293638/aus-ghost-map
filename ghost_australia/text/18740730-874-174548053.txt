A PYROCRIPTICAL EFFUSION. This world is getting more and more utilitarian every day. Sir Henry Thompson of scientific notoriety proposed to do away with cemeteries, and resume the old system of cremation, restoring the ashes to the soil. Dr. Neild and Mr. Sydney Gibbons have read papers on cremation here, the subject has evoked a good deal of attention in Europe, and Vienna is reported to have adopted it. But we claim for Victoria that it is not behind the age, as we are aware that some months before Sir Henry Thompson's paper saw daylight in the colony, a company was in process of formation for the purpose of carrying out similar views, namely dispensing with crypt and cemetery, but carrying them much further. The company bears the title of the Pyrocryptal Company (Limited), and proposes to utilise all the different products of tbe body, under the superintendence of an experienced chemist. The objects of this Company may be perhaps better exemplified by the following effusion of a youthful member of it:— THE UTILITARIAN LOVER'S ADDRESS TO HIS DYING MISTRESS. Ah! dearest maid, though now we part, I'll find for thy remains a mart, And thy blest soul with joy shall see Us utilise each part of thee. Thy osseous structure rightly burned To finest charcoal shall be turned; The stearine we will then prepare From thy sweet fat, with greatest care, And run in moulds that I may see "Short sixes" as a part of thee. The oils, of which you're not aware, You have two kinds, I'll then prepare— The heavy one for cartwheel use, And from the other "light" produce; Thy teeth, those lovely "pearl reminders," We'll sell to those who're short of grinders; Those beauteous locks, so bright and fair, To those who've got but little hair. So fear not, sweetest, dearest ghost, That one small speck of thee'll be lost, For what is left of thy dear frame Shall used be, my dying flame, No particle be cast away, But reproduced in grass or hay.
