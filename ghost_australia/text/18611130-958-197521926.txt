By the owls and bats unholy That around thy cavern flit, By thy curse on (Garibaldi, Dug from thine own native pit ; By thy rich desert, .-the gibbet, ' By the hangman and his rope, By scarlet hats and ditto stockings, .

'Thou, who squirteBt toad-like venom On the man. all nations prize, Naming thee with Garibaldi Appears indeed a deadly sin; ' A man, O sage, whose little finger More potent is than all thy kin. VIII.

Aye, go hang, or else for ever Hide thyself from light of day, And in cloisters grim and lonely j Do for once sincerely pray That the world may soon forget thee, . As forget thee soon it must, 1 And that thou may aoon be mingled : With the meanest, basest, duat. XI. But for thee, great Garibaldi ! Nature's noble king of men ! From thy island home sequestered, Wilt thou e'er come forth again ? Must the sword of garibaldi Rusting, hang against the wall I ! Lo ! the foes of freedom rally — Lift thy finger, and they fall I XII. Garibaldi, good and holy ! Gwibaldi, wise and bold ! We are praying God to bless thee, In this distant land of gold. Heed thou not the sneers of Judos, Blessed art thou by honest men, Who will do their best to aid thee, With their money, voice, and pen. W. Stitt JwatiNa. Geeleng, 28th November, 1861,
