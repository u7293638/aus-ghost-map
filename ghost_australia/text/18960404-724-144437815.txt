He had lived at the Towers all his life and if (hers was a ghost he would know of it'. ?

I passed the remainder of the day In a very unenviable state of mind ; and for the first time In my life I delayed replying to Uncle James. It would be folly to let him come, and find the plaoe without a ghost, for that would show bow very little 1 re spected hit wishes. Yet, what else oould I dof Tb*re seemed absolutely no way oat of tbe difficulty bnt to make a olfmn breast of it However, after dinner, I determined to pat a bold fane on things, so I eat down and wrote to Uncle Jamoa. ltold him I should be delighted to eee him on the date named, bat I regretted I bad no ghost to offer Him. I Mid I Dad not forgotten his wishes on the Kibjeot, bat that the former owner could not be fad need to part with the ancestral upoctre, except oc terms to exorbitant tbat I fult id; mesas did not justify my areping to them ; and, remembering his oaotion about on* neoessary extravagance, I felt eare ho would append my scruples. Having perpetrated that pious fraud, I turned maud to read the newppaper. lb at was probably the most unlucky act of my Ufe. Had I sent the letter to hiin be wouM *oon have got over his disappoint ment, an»l all would have beet) well; bat u it is— we)'. it's no good repining. I to-n-xl over the paper negligently, and as I did po, some demon of Ul luck directed myatt-utioD to a particular paragraph : ?We bars inspected Messrs. Psyche ft Co's Mock of Ohristmas novelties,' it ran, 'and must again congratulate this old en* tablfrhM firm on their enterprise. lhey have In id in a remarkably fin* stock of ghost* for tbe winter season, and we believe thai intending purchasers will be able to gr.itify their vaned fas tea at exceedingly low figures. They are particularly strong in eighteenth century remnants, while their eastern importations leave nothing to be de sired.' I rubbed my eyes in amazement. I did not know that there were firms that dealt in pboste. But here it was in black and white ia a respectable paper, and the name given in fall. I rM-'O^nioeJ the lwnd of Providence iu drawing my attention to the natter, and I tore op my letter to Unole James. If he wanted a ghost he should have one ; and I would make imm&Ii;&te; ar rangements for the importation of eighteenth oentury, eastern, or other produce. I nonsuited Bradshaw, and found 1 oould still catcb the night mail at Skipton ; and the next morviojf I awoke in London. At breakfast I looked up Psvobe & Co. in the' directory and should not have been very muoh astonished to fiz-d no mention made of mob a firm- But there it was, at 76, Archipelago Street, Soho.

' Hare is our mw catalogue or would you prefer to inspect think that would be the beet,1 I 4 a* this is my first transaction. He led the war down a narrow passage, and opened the door at the end.

' If there b anything I doteet, it u a Viotorian Bhftde. It takes a hundred years at least to give a ghont his full flavour.' 4 No. indeed, Uncle Jamai/ I replied, de lighted with my forethought. *My ghoet is pure Kliiabothaa. He is Franufo Norton, the last of the male stouk, who came to grief in tho rebellion of 15G9. Von can read all about him in Wordsworth's poem, 4 The White Doe of Bylstone.' Uncle James rubbed his hands with gloe. ' Bravo, Bob! You're in luck. What does he do?* ' Oh, he— er — he walks about, you know clan king his chain.' 4 His chain V said Uncle Jatow dubiously. 1 What doe* he want a forf 4 I'm sure I don't know. I thought all ghuets bad chains.* 4 You are mistaken, Nephew Bob,* he said | stonily. 1 I never came across one with a chain. It's only the ghosts of silly fiction who have them. 4 Well, this one has a a chain, at any rate,' I stupidly remarked. * I'm sorry to bear it,' said Uncle James ; and he did not again refer to (he ghost for some time. Things brightened up, however, after dinner, and Uncle James grew quite enthusl* as tic over the Towers. He was delighted with the bouse, aud its situation among tbe hoatber*clad hills of Craven was quite is so cordsnce with his rouwntio tart/*. * Yon have a charming place, Bob,' said he, over the port, 'and you've got a high-olass gho*t into the bargain, though I must admit I wished he hadn t a chain. However/ he added cheerfully, ' if he has one, it will be for some good reason, and I shall have to find out what that is. What time does he appear P 4 Psyche promised him for nine, prompt,* I answered inadvertently. 4 Eh P* said Unole Jaines. 4 What did you say P*| 'Precisely at nine, prompt,1 I had tbe presence of mind to reply. Uncle James glanced at me doubtfully. * I thought you said something else, Bob. Well, this gho-c of yours romarkalily methodical in his habits. He's all bat due now,' he added, looking at his watoh. I bitterly regretted my unfortunate dip. It was absolutely necessary I should see the irbost direotiy he arrired and post bim up in hia duties, and yet if I left Unole James at tMa particular moment I might arouse sus picious. I was deliberating what to do, when the door was opened abruptly, and old Dempster rushed fb. His face was white as chalk, and he was trembling all over. I * Well, what's the matter Dempster P1 1 1 enquired with some foreboding. Dempster tried to speak, but only in- | ooherent ejaculations bant from him. At j last he raised a trembling hand and pointed I to the door. 4 Excuse mc hall a minute. Uncle James, I said, rising ; ' I must just see what is the matter.' I walked into the hall, and there I saw a sight that obilled my very bones. At the bottom of the stain was a ghost, bat cot the one I expected in hose and doublet. This one was tbe ghost of a modern postman in bis uniform. In one hand he grasped a heavy ohain, and in the other he held his cap and letter. Ho glided up to me when I appeared, and held out the letter. Just as I took it I heard a noise behind mo. so I hastily put It in my pocket. 'Well, I'm blest 1' exclaimed an aston ished voice. The postman slowly vanished. I turned round and faced Unole James. 4 You seem to run two ghosts, Nephew Bob,' said he drily. ' Er— yes— I do,* I stammered ; 1 this Is a ClivUtmas extra/ 4 Oh, is it P Well, you ought let me hare a look at the Christmas card he brought, 4 1 oan't, Unole. Indeed I oan't ; it's private, or I would,* I paid in desperation. Uncle James turned on bis heels, and walked upstairs to his bndroom with greet deliberation. Considerably upset. I returned to the dining room. I opened tbe letter with many forebodings, and I found they #ere more than realised, for thisis what I read:— , « Dear Sir, — It is with the greatest regret we have to inform you we oannot execute your esteemed order.

Oome on, old toasting-fork.* How- the quarrel would have ffMfd, good* nees anly knows. I was simply too psteiflsd to move; but at tfii^ moment us door nearest them opened, and Unole James appeared. The ghosts stopped short suddenly, and commenced to fade away ; but before they were completely gone Unole James made a mysterious sign, and, as 1 live, those wretched phantoms came baok, and then fol lowed him into his room. There was no more sleep for me. Unole James knew the w*ys of ghosts thoroughly, and he guessed he would worm out of those, fatuous spirits the whole particulars of my arrangement with Psyche. I did think of interrupting the interview aud ordering them to leave the house, but I felt the attempt would bo uhelejn and I should only be made to appear utterlj foolish. Uncle James came down tbe next morning very cold and irresponsive. He had a time table in his hand, and he ostentatiously con sulted it under my nose. ' Are you going anywhere, Uoole James P* I faintly asked. 'Yes, sir, I am going home by the next train.' * But you said you would stay till Christ mas.' I protested. 'That is so, Nephew Bob,* he replied; 1 but I did not then Know you would tire a commercial article to a -chain outride oy bedroom door.
