PETJSSIA. THE' PRUSSIAN ECCLESIASTICAL LAWS. The Lower House of the/ Prussian Parlia ment has given its final approval to the four Ecclesiastical Bills as sent down from the Upper House ; arid in reply to the declaration of some Conservative member that the Ca | tholic Church could never submit to these ' laws, Dr. Falk taunted them with the fact : that the Centre had always claimed to be the ; most law-abiding section of the House, and added that the laws would be energetically carried out, and, if necessary, strengthened by others. Dr. Falk does not, or will noi . see that a man is not the less law- abiding for refusing submission to an earthly law which is in direct violation of the law o' God. To this desire of creating a belief that the Catholics are rebels is, we suppose,' to be ? attributed the invention of an absurd canard, reproduced by English papers, to the effect that the Emperor William had been shot by a priest. The Telegraph correspondent , placed the scene at Insterburg, in East Prussia — where the Emperor, has not been— and the telegram in the Daily News at a re. view at St. Petersburg ; adding— too circum- .- stantiallv-^that the Emperor of Russia^ ' wept with indignation.' The whole was a pure fiction. More Suppressions.— A Berlin telegram . to the Hour says that the German Govern ment has resolved on the suppression of the Religious Orders of Redemptorists, Lazarists, ? Sisters of the Holy Ghost, and the Associa- ? . tion of the Heart of Jesus.
