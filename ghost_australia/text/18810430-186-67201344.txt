Although be was wholly irnwiTW in wooing. Hand Heseage had had sufficient experience in brine wooed to fed that Una man loved her. And the thought was not impTfmnt to her. She felt that he was strong and tender and true; and when a girl feds tins of a man, miles her aSeetkw are pre-engaged, there is but little doubt what her answer wffl be when the question is asked. When, therefore, Gerald suddenly gave op walking with her and left her to the care of Etad Gaaett, she was alilre surprised aad pained.
