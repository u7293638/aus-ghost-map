A M.SSING DOCUMENT. A rather ourioas incident haB occurred at Rookwood, which ia puzzling tho minds of tho aldermen and ratepayers, and which promises to develop into n mystery, the solution of which will be eagerly looked for. At one present time tnere is not tne eiigu.cab olue, and unless the trail is aoou picked up tho unbelievers in the midnight rambles of tho dear departed will bo converted, as no other conclusion aould be come to than that the ghost of somo kleptomaniac has been pro miscuously hovering in tho vicinity of the thing good. If such be the ease tho spectre must have been ia hie time a litigant. At a recent meeting of the council an opinion was roceivod from tho Crown Soli citor on the Bpooial audit business. Tho letter was put carefully away, aud, being like all legal opinions anything but light reading, thero was nothing to givo one the idea that it would float off on the eloquence of tho alder men. But it went all the same, und now tho question is whore is it and who has got it? The council clerk has searched high and low without success, and tho ouly thing, that may account for it ia the fact that tho council chamber is near the cemetery and that the street is badly lighted, giving great advantages to the burglariously inclined spectre.
