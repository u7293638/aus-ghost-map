AMUSEMENTS. The first concert in connection with the second series of "Continental" evenings will be given at the Exhibition Garden to-night, when the Adelaide Orpheus Society will present an attractive programme ot gteea, pan songs, and choruses. Instrumental muaio will be pro vided by the Eastern Suburban Band, and a crowded attendance is confidently anticipated. Age cannot wither, nor custom stale, die infinite variety of the entertainment preeented to tho patrons of the Cycloraoia. The fine picture of the battlefield of Waterloo, bo graphically described by Mr. Lockley, has lost nono of its charm, tbe musical illustrations arranged by Mr. Dennis Keenan adding preatly to die enjoyment of die onlookers. Napoleon's ghost etill walks his customary round, and the refreshing babble of the waters of the fairy fountain bring a thoroughly en joyable entertainment to a pleasant conclusion. The Bijou Theatre will be reopened on Thursday evening, when theGarrick Dramatic Club will appear for three niehte, giving a change of programme each evening. The initial bill will comprise "Ruth's Romance," "A Regular Kir," and "A Bed of Roses,''and as there will be a number of visitors in town in oonneotion with the agricultural show, it is safe to predict well- filled houses during the short season. A packed house greeted Mr. Walter Bentley, Miss Isabel Webster, and their company at Glenelg last night, when tbe same programme which was submitted at the Ade laide Town Hall on Monday evening was gone through with great satisfaction to die audience. "The dream of Eugene Aram" secured loud applause, and Mist Webster's numbers were all encored. Mr. Nitscbke, Mr. Duncan, and Miss Bancroft also met with flattering recep tions. The company will appear at the Sema phore Town Hall to-night, and on Thursday evening will submit an entirely nuw pro gramme at the Town Hall, Adelaide, when the last opportunity of hearing Miss Webster and Mr. Beatley will be afforded.
