LADY PEARL. It pained him to play the hypocrite, but he did not feel sufficiently'to abandon his project. It was all very well for her to want to bear his name, but what was he to do with her if they were married ? He was too fond of society{,to ever think of having its portals shut against him, and with a sophistry:peculiar to men who are doing wrong he argued that'.she had brought it on herself.. ' All I ask is,' he said, ihat ,you .will consent to 'a:'secret' marriage, down rat some quiet church, and let it be bidden for a time.' : r - ' I ;sh'all "be satisfied,' "she replied, simply. ' It is: not.so much.of the world's thoughts that I cared for, but vhat I have thought myself. To him the change :in: her: was. phe nomenal, but h was nriot a 'deep thinker and could' not.:detect the :action of , the spirit within. .Hoiw was he to know 'how much this handsome womanhad. suffered in times past, or how fictitious and hollow was.the mirth'she indulged in;.. Granted that she was lowly. born and had been lifted: up 'to 'a 'life of- luxury.: What' of' that ? "She:, had found, as many find, that what looked ;'so fair and palatable in the far distance was all .glare and glitter, the; fruit. all liusk, tie limpid waters bitter, and over all the oppressive pall that hangs above the for-. bidden thing. :: ,She might not, be.a .woman of, refined. thought, but slhe had hopes and. aspira tions like the best of women, The de velopment of. refinrement is a matter of association and culture. and the germ of it lies in- us all; .

For good or ill the heavy foot oftadvancing civilization is trampling them out; and six- legged calf, talkifig pig, and other pet exhibitions of our forefathers will be relegated to the shades of the des pised an'd lost, and the places, once so proud of them shill know them no"'more. But there are some institutions that die hard, and country fairs are one of them. ,The rustics are loth to let them go, and nurse and nourish them in their dying hours. Warblington is particularly rustic and especially loth to let go its hold of its fair, which is held in the autumn when harvest is over, and its people compara tively flush of money. . The principal promoters of these fairs now-a-days are the gipsies, whole-cast, half-caste, and doubtful caste, who, jackal-like, feast upon the remnants left by the lion Richardsons and Daylasses ofthe past, and at Warblington the gipsies in the, ear'iia which our story lies .were, paiticlt!l larly strong. FHarac and Lanah were there;with,, a sack of cocoa- nuts and wooden bowls for the public to' roll,'bowl or'pitch,' as they, pleased, and in.the outskirts of a' line' of dingy booths and shows they. shouted hoarsely. to the rustics to try their luck. Some fifty yards beyond the groundi.tihey had fitted up was the van belonging to. Countycella, and within it she sat with' two men,'Hugh Egerton, and his ,broiher Nesbitt. . . . .The door was a divided one,: and .the upper. halt was open.' Countycella sat by it looking out with a grave, contemptuous face, uttering no word:. Hugh, and 'Ne: bitt seated at,the far end;"well out of the sight of anyone b"issing by, were whisper ing; together. :: 'So "she .bids you hope at.last,'s'aid Hugh, wiith i sigh. Yes,'"replied Nesbitt, ' we are gradually getting near the coast, where we may._get a fislierman to run us over to France. If I sere stronger IFzwoid ld niake .the effort noiv. We could acover the =intervening: ground in a day and night.' S!The effort might be fatal to youi, and is not to be thought' of for a'monieit.' ' What if it is fatal?,you would be ridl of your burden ?n'the i .' :' 'Why will you always speak in that way, Nesbitt ? Have. I ever madteyou a iarden.'

IWhy did you not leave me?' asked Nesbitt, bitterly; : 'Every. day: I reproach; m)yself with being the cause of your ruin.': iNo mor'e 'ofit, I beg.

' 'And if they were biroken? asked Nesbitt- iiiquiringly. .' : .. -' 'Our"Vpeople would fall iaway likd a broken butidle of' straw and would be scattered far.and wide.' SThere was a silence. The words of Countycella were of deep import to the listeners, and Nesbitt and Hugh with a ariation in their line of thought were' ihinking;': Nesbitt's thoughts ran titus: . i'If these iwo men are the bibdisi, pser-aind get broken-otherwise kIilled; and this tribe be scattered, would not Hugh and I be free?' b.And Hugh's mind put this problem before him : S'Could I by any stratagem get those two men into the clutches of the law? The.tribe without them would not act, and we should have ample leisure to arrange our plans and get away. Neither oe them had a disloyal thought towards .ountycella, for dark and passion* ate as her soul was, her love for Nesbitt was a thing past the love of women. For him she was prepared to sacrifice every thing--all family ties, her people, and her life, if need be. Nesbitt had always loved her, and Hugh's old repugnance had died away and given place to admiration and respect. Apart from the reverence her sterling devotios inspired, her beauty was not with out its power on Hugh. The well-formed, regular features, the rich dark hue of her. skin, the full red mouth, the glistening' white teeth, and above all, the lustrous. eyes, changing with every thought and.re flecting every varying light, were things that no man could be entirely insensible to. If.he could not love be must at least admire. S'I guess 'your- thoughts,' she- said, suddenly, '.'but it connot. be done-as, well tiy to bid:the sleeping panther as,to fall upon thetnin secret.' : 'Mine was a cruel thought,' replied Nesbitt,- ' theyare your'brothers ?' Countycella made; a gesture of indif ference, mingled witlh contempt; I ;.I'have no brothers-no tribe,' slie'said L-'inothing but--you:. I .have no room in myl heart' for m.niore;'. ' I)ear.Countycella, 'said Nesbitt, draw ing near-to her so that he could -take her hand 'truest atid most loving of w'omen.' ' If you were false to me- ' she said with a, fierce light in her eyes:, - SWhat wvould yodu do.?' said Nesbitt seeing'that she pa;used: If would kill youibotih she said, with an, indiscribable' mi.vemeit 6f the lie ad' thatiidicatdiced'botl to 'ean.',him - and 'some possible rival, and then tear 'myself to- pieces as a punishment for having killed you ' . Nesbitt smiled, and stooping" dbwn touched' her--hand with his lips -with-' a courtly grace that would have been pleas ing to any woman, and truly grateful'to her. who had seen the women of: her:. people used as beasts of bnrden. ' If there are many house dwellers like you,' she said, 'your women are fortunate.' :The day passed on, and except to par:' take of a frugal meal Countycelly never stirred, and the brothers remained prison ers, watching as only imprisoned souls can watch for liberty in the night to come. Then they could go forth and, breathe theb fre'slikar:: By day, when halting in public, places, HFarac and Lii-?' forbade them to leave the van, and. would, give no. reason for their restriction: . . - I -'-It is enough,' said Harac, ' that-I--am at ..the head, of the tribe and you areof my people. r.'Obey'r ',Better do it,' advised Countycella;, b'ear fodi.awhile with" him.' , The night came at last with awstarlit, peaceful sky above: and naptha lamps and coarse' revelry below. The jingling of bells,.beating of gongs and hoarse shout ingsriade the place intolerable to Hiugi: who turned from-the. scene and strolled towards-the country. .. . As Hugh hastened away a man came. oit of the shadow of a house opposiie aind took the same-road, unnoticed by Nesbitt or his gipsy wife. . ... It was the Duke of Blacklern, who had with tle 'aid .of: agents found out Hugh's biding-place, and had been swaiting hours to get him alone.-- With joy .he saiw him descend :frim t!ie 'van, :and after.a :few vords 'ina low tone vith his' companions .n';ke fortheis:' ntry . i ',I.cotild desire-niomore,? ? ih?' ht the duke, as he followed swiftly and silently' with a hea'vy~ hunting-crop?- ini his; liand.

Shall we move on ?. It is better.to talk as we go.' ' Not towards your vagabond friends,' said the duke. 'I warn you not to trifie with me;' 'Choose a path,' said Huglh, coldly, and I will take it; or -if you desire to shoot me -= SN, 'Egertonh, I mean to beat'thie life out of you-to thrash you like-a dog.' ` Oh, s"aid Hugh, drily; ' I might have objected to that; but',ve will talk of that anon Now .choose your path.' ,iThe .duke turned his back.to the- red lights of the fair-and walked slowly on, with his head down, while Hugh related his sory. First le spoke of his younger: brother, of the -promise he had made to help him through-all trouble, to be his firm friend, and' howa that promise had involved him in the Romany nest from which he could see no escape'except by flight abroad. '' Andyou think they would really kill you ?' the duke said, incredulously.

The'iimeeting -in the 1irk he spoke of ivith aglow in his heart, for it recalld ito him the first great 'glad sensation that swept through his veins when he tnew that Pearl loved him, and he confessed that he was led'to. press his suit. 'I should have called,' le said, 'but Nesbitt, my brother, met with a accident and was believed to be dying. So I came to him and was glad I came, for reflection bade ,me recognise,the injustice of linking Pearl's'life to mine.' ' 'You appear to have. had some lucid intervals,' said the duke, grimly. 'Rare:to those who love as I do,' re turned Hugh. 'I would have kept out of her, road, but the invisible power that guides all things brought us together-.on the Essex marches. We met again and again,~ilauching our boat on the torrent and going whithersoever it chose to carry us. I know that I for a time.cared little whither I was going.'

What is thie titie now? I have no watch.' The duke struck a light and looked at his watch. It was nearly half-past ten. SI-ow far is Barnby from here ?' the duke asked. 'Nearly four miles.' ' We must hurry then. Do you know the way ?' ' It is a.straight road.' ' Lead the way then. I have left two private inquiry men behind me at the inns but I daresay they will make themselves coinfortable for the night. I can telegraph in: the morning for them by return.. Go on, Egerton; don't forget that I am a good walker as well as yourself.' â¢ Hught made no reply, but fell into, the, quick, swinging. stride of the piactised' athlete and, haunted by the:vision:of a. loved form lying in a dank; narrow dyke; with the sweet, still face turned up to tie blue arch of heaven, he:strode in silenice in the direction of Barnby station: CHAPTER'XVIi.": .:Only a man blessed with very strong nerves'could have lived in comfort and in a state bordering on loneliness, as D-. Sabotson did, at Gaunt House. If, the exterior was gloomy and. for bidding the interior was doubly and trebly. so-dark stair-cases, ill-lighted rooms, mysterious corners, and a pervading aroma of the supernatural being its chief. features. A misanthrope with the power and will to build a house in consonance with his morbid mind would have con structed such a place..... But Dr. Sabotson was not in'that way an impressionable man. ' He was 'mortal, and had his cravings, passions .and desires, but he had no fear of tbdhsuper-' natural, simply' because he did not:believe in it; Â°. He belonged to the school which have attempted to make the world believe that man is little more than a pinch of. phosphorus and a bucket of water,' capable irn its organic arrangements of certain' sen sations' agreeable and otherwise, set in motion like:a wound-up watch, to go a certain time and then stop for ever. S-The fool hathssaid in his heart there is no God,' and Sabotson was one of those fools.L 'Whatever ordinary fear or dread of death lie may have felt he attributed to an :involunitarily neivous contractioh' of the diaphragnm,"and occasionallj-' thoiight: it a' mistake in the construction of min for him to:have a diaphragm at all, "Notwithstanding this he was capable of loving as animals love, and had passions that give him a' great deal of troublg, inainly because he had not the means to gratify them. 'he' great object of his life was to amass money as speedily as possible, and then spend it in the 'gratification of his' desires, and it troubled him not b little to find the best years of his life slipping away' and he still nuimbered 'among" the cum-' parative poor. ' This thought was in his mind as he sat in a room he had chosen for "his special. use-an apartment in' the southern wing wherein the sun shone when" the day was fine, a snug, retired retreat; ivith a strong door on each side that' bolted and barred would have kept a dozen men an hour at bay. Oneof'these doors communicated with the' house, the: other with the neglected'gardei.' : It was getting dark without;: but bc had: no lamp, preferring the -glo"om"io: irssist him in the due enjoyiment of a good.cigar: and a bottle of wine, things he did not often indulge in utnless his'day's work'was: done or when'ihe was sure of being, iudis turbed.

So saying he removed the gag, formed of a piece of wood, wrapped round with a handkerchief, and tossed it into the grate. Emilie de Ltunay did not speak nor did she look at him. For one man alone had shte eyes. 'And you musut not think that we are going to do you any harm,' contitued the doctor, in an uncrtuous, oily manner, 'You will have a very comfortable home here if you will conform to our rules,' Still not a word, and the doctor, satis flied with hlving done his duty, turned to Lord Raidenstore, who had removed the stain from his face but looked very little the better for it. If he had been pitched head first into a fence of thick brambles he could scarcely have had so .many scratches. ' You will have to put me up for a day or two, Sabotson,' he said, turning his back upon his victim, '.I can't show: in society with such a face as this.' ! ' Crewel shall drive you to a quiet inn,' returned the doctor, ' where. you can tell what cock-and-bull story you please. I' cannot allow anybody to remain here, ex cept my assistants and patients. I will, howerver, give you some ointment'that will- make a wonderful difference to-you in a few hours.' " â¢ ; He brought some out from a jar, gave Lord Raidenstore a little to put upon his face, and filled a box for him 'to take away. All this time his lordship did .not look.at the hapless Sunflower and she did not remove her eyes from him. ' Have a glass of wine,' said the doeS tor. ' You must want it.' Lord Raidenstore drank a couple of glasses 'and then 'the doctor' tried the patient, but she refused to open her clenched' lips at his bidding. She did nothing but stare at the man who had so cruelly shattered her hopes, the man who had hung upon her. words and kissed her a thousand times. . ' -: i Creel soon came back to see if there were any'orders for him before he turned in, and the doctor asked him if he could carry tlhe ptient away with'ot assistance. ' 'A dozen like lier,' was the ansswer;' S.' Put her in the room we have tempo rarily padded,' said the doctor, 'and see there is nothing for her to use;' : ' Dcii't be afeard, doctor,' said Crewel,' ivith a laugh., 'She won't do herself any harm. The mischief she means is for others.' ' ' ' " " : He tokblher up as if she haid been a child 'and carried her out with those fixed eyes anid silent tongue, "far more terrible than' the wildest shrieks and the most awfulithreats coudild have been. . ' On,: my 'word,: doctor,', said Lord Raidenstore, ..'I am 'awfully sorry ' I' entered into this business. : ' . 'You: can have tiher released if you like,' was the cool reply. : ' Release her now,' said Lord Raiden' store, with a shudder. ,' What would mny. life be worth, do you think ?'. ' i; ' ''That is not my; business, my tlord, Have you brought the certificate ?': " ' It is here.'.

' ; 'You .can spend the night here,' said the doctor. ' Have a little sleep on the couch. :'I shall be 'reading and shall not disturb you.' , " / On that couch? No,' replied Lord Raidenstore.

Your friend is too, murderous to make much'noise.'.. ' Lord Raidenstore shivered, and, hastily filling a glass .with wine,, drank it 'off. The horror known to the haunted man was .taking possession of him. ' .' If you really want to sleep,' said the doctor, presently, ' I can give you some thing that will keep you quiet until the morning.' ' ' Give me something that will keep me quiet for ever if you like,' was the reply, I 'No, I won't do that,' said the doctor, takinig down' a bottle fronim a shelf, 'as I never do gratuitous acts. There's your dose-seven dropsi and you will not think of much bef.re daylight. . Lord Raidenstore took the small' glass tendered him and eyed it curiously before. he drank the colourless contents. ;' Who'would think it?' he said.'
