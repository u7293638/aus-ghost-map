CYCLORA.MA. Last night there was another large attendance of spectators at the Cyclorama, and in addition to the beaotiful representation of Waterloo and the illusion of IS apoleon'e ghost there was produced for the second time in Adelaide the wonderful "Fountain of laughing waters." This found very ereat favour with the patrons. Who as the different effects were produced heartily applauded. The glorified shower-bath undergoes many changes of _ form and colour while the rest of the building is in darkness. Jets rise sometimes to a height of 60 ft., with smaller ones playing round th9m. The effect is most beautiful where the light plays on the spray at the top of the fountain. Such a Rag production as this, despite its formidable name— "Hydatapilrilumina"—is well worth seeing, and people anxiouB to conserve their powers of speech will be quite justified in calling it simply the "Fountain of laughing waters." All this beanty is got out of ordinary cold water, and a sight of the spectacle would make even a hydrophobist forget his natural antipathy.
