or that wisdom that always chooses the right end and attainB it ! y the only right means But, oh how precious, how moment- ously important in the estimate or God is that spiritual lire whose

the powers of the soul point to immortality, but im- mortality under the frownor God is undying death Spiritual life, however, mikes immortality the crown and glory or our being Ocd who ennnot lie,

brighter and brighter to the perfect day, where God is the sun and night cannot be Tho new-born IOTC and joy of those that drink into the spirit of Jesus Christ is not a tumult of transient feeling-n storm-swollen torrent to be drunk np by the sands The water that I shall give him shall be in him a weil of living water springing up into evci lasting life And here there sholl be not only perpetuity

¿.lass, the glorj of the Lord, wc aro changed into the sime ímigc from glory unto glory, even as by the spirit of tho Lord , what sholl be the rapidity of the assimilation when wc shill sec not in a gl«ss darkly, but face to face Let faith take the wings or imagination and follow the progress of eternal lire to i distance, at which cTcn faith itseir groWB dizzied with the glory and weaned with

hero bas its allotted term, for materials and spoccforgrowth are limited, and the endless growth of one would exclude nil other growths Not so with spiritual life The grcitcr its TiUiht) and

life look up to the towering pine or palm It is doomed OB sureb to decay as is the moss or lichen at its root But this divine life in the human soul makes if a tree .f riphteousnos destined to bloom, and fmitfulness that knows no decay Look up to the strength of the cloud cleaving cogie , I its life is doomed to extinction as surely as that of the ephemeron I fly But this spiritual life, whether in a Magdalene or a Latirus, shall rise on a wing that can ney cr tire, and burn with a Hame that can never become extinct The diamond u but dust, tho eaith a chunging garment, the sun a transient spark, compared to that eternal life that animates the humblest child of God And this my brethren, is not the rhaptodv o' enthusiasm or the dream of a fairy land It is sober but glorious realit) , and far, far beneath the truth Wo ire mido partaker« of a Divine nature-a nature as immortal as its bource bpiritunl life is the climax and glory of all life-a gift worthy the infinite love and resources of »bccvcr-blcseed and all-sufficient God It is the germ of which the body is hut the hu<-k, a germ, of which all things and dispensations arc but auls to development Spiritual life anywhere is precious, but spiritual life educed from death and trained amid earth's sorrows and discipline will be, lierhaps, the highest form of life destined to revell the glory or 08(1 and His Christ for ever, how, brethren, if such be the transendant excellence and glory of spiritual life, how does it stand related to our principles and churches ' Or, perhaps a more suitable statement of the question would be, How do our principles and churches stand m relation to spiritual life ' Here let mc guard mi self and my subject by reminding yon of the fact that, such is the quickening and beneficent power or Chnslianitv that no sect or Christians can nuke a monopoly of tjintu«! life, no more thrn any country on our planet ein make a monopoly of the hc,ht ind heat of the sun In all sects and parties under every conceivable form of church organisation, spiritual life may find embodiment, as the records of church history and as our own intercourse with Christians of all parties prove Indeed, the Tigour and fulness of divine life in the soul depend JO much on personal faithfulness to the light and obliga- tions of each individual believer, that it is not always safe to test the truth and excellence of doctrines or church principles by the character of their professors By this test many who do not judge or principles by their intrinsic worth or worth Iessness, think more highly of the Mahommedanism of devout Turks than of the Christianity of unfaithful Christians, and place truth and error on equal footings in their regard Now, while we enter our protest against tho narrowness that would confine all good to one sect or system of principles, against the blind bigotry that will see no true worth in, or salvation for those who do not wear its facings and speak its shibboleth-against the unwisdom that would compare ourselves with other Churches , or attempt to gauge the amount of spiritual life in any- against the Phari seeism that would hide our defects or assume what we do not possess, while we protest against all assumption and hypocrisy, we protest with equal emphasis against the moral laxity and dis loyalty to truth that would make all sincere doctrinal beliefs of equal importance or unimportance regardless of the truth, and reduce all principles of discipline and forms of Church order to a matter of equal indifference It might do very well for the poet of a semi-infidel age, for one whose grasp of truth was never strong, and whose Magnus Apollo was Lord Bolingbroke, for Pope, whose faith and morals were both of a very low type, to say " For forms and creeds let senseless bigots fight, His can't be wrong whose life is in the right " "Contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints, buy the truth, and sell it not " Let this be our motto, but let it equally be ours to speak the truth in love, and to remember that should we speak with the tongues of men and angels, and not have charity, we are but as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal The right feeling of the heart is surely is important as tbo right thinking of the head , and to bear kindly with what we deem the errors of others, where God suffers long and is kind to all, is surely becoming to such fallible creatures as we But again, I assert the importance of truth, especially levelled truth Its every ray is Eternal light Its every particle is more precious than diamord Jesus Christ came into our world tho Witness and King of truth He saw its value and lived to teach it, and witncfsed it in good confession before His foes and on the Cross It is the element of our sanctification in its highest verities , anti the guardian of freedom and order even in its lower forms We ministers of Christ are set for its defence and propagation Whatever is not based on it must fall All that is not of it is wood hay, and stubble that the fire must consume We have said that no meridian or region makes a monopoly or the sun , but that does not imply that all share his beams alike or that all arc equally salubrious for habitation All substances ne pro buhl) conductors more t r less of the eleerie fluid , but 'onie ire more rapid conductors thi n others

We do not perpetrate a mockery of free thought by telling a man to search the Bible and adhere to what he finds there, and yet set before him a mass of foregone conclusions at which he must arrive on pain of expulsion from the ministry or suppression of truth Surcly, surely it is not conducive either to spiritual life or national morality for men to sign formulas the opposite of which they preach (for different parties preach the opposite of each other's doctrines), and under which they so writhe that they beg a secular Legislature to alter their formularies or do away with their subscription M c thank God that though our hbcrlieb buTO been puichascd with a gieat price, cv erv) car show s us the) wire wonh ill they cost Oui theolog) wc draw from the living foun taiisel irispiiation, and wc are free to receive any additional bpht tvat »ni breik ii) n us from those exhiustlc«s sources Our thioloj.) is such i« the Howes and Baxter» used to feed tho ardent flames of their li ' j dev otion The cr« ss is its centre, and its circumference takes in al' the maiiit««titioiis of God mulo to oirraee Veprcackje us Christ crucifltd as the wisdom of Cud and the power of God Hi» bh seul life, so divuuly human und to lu-iaiily divine, His death and resurrection His mediation and return ii gio»), are becoming mon and mole the theme and hfo of oui ministers and churchc« " I am come," Ho « ml, 1 that they ii lght haTC life, md thut thev might have it more iluodaml) " Anil tho abundant 1 fe ti iws into the Church u ore frcelT in \ roportion as hei mind and he irt arc o] cn to His truth md love I bunk dod, wo mo bound to no inert mass of traditional theology or ritual that chokes up the channels of that more abundant life Some may wander from the noon of redeeming love around the cross into Hu twilight of a negative theology , but the tliicp do not hear '. thnr i*i«oand tortakothc faithless skejilu ni. bonn mi) hold tho nulli in ni righteousness , but ti eir «t inn a de ith is witnessed | seuntt'hj the truth they bold Our principle «filmet adheieuco to the Word of Cod for faith and practice is ene of our most effectual aids to spiritual hfe Our doctrinal principles aro identical with the teaching of apostles and prophets , they are as old as the first promise of Eden and the sacrifiée of Abel-the theology of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world They inspired the soul« of martyrs , they nerved tbo champions e f spiritual liberty m 10C2 Thoy sailed with the Pilgrim I'athcre, and were planted in the churches of a new England destined to still greater liberties than the old They kindled the mighty learning of an Owen and the ardour of a Howe They glowed m the n ufini.6 of the angelic Doddridge and n the saintly song« of 1 aocWattp Iliey broke forth in tho fiery appeals of llichnrd Baxter, and occur m the sentences of ti e silvei-tongued William lintis These mighty truths wc have learnt from Jesus Christ und his ni eslíes, let us hold them with firmness lot i s preach them willi rower, let us live on thom as the bread of life I et us hold I them in sympathy with the Holy Citholio and Apo olio Church throughout all the earth, till we hear them in the strains of tho | new Eong from the lips of tbo Chu h triumphant in heaven And let us adhere-though men shuald untiuly cill us creedtess and latitudinumn-let UB adhere to the principle that w bow to the authority of God alone tua. wc go direct to the primal springs of inspiration for our theology and discipline Wc con- demn lot others for a dilfercnt course, but we rejoice in our liberty, and believe it eminently conducive to spirituil life v\ c belitv c the relation of our ministers to our Churches, and to tach other, removes serious hindrance, and ifford« valuable help to spiritual life As to entranec to the sacred ministry, wc act on the belief that no man should enter St till judged by bis brethren to haye gifts und grace for the work.
