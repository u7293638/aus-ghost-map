Could she only have foreseen the events in the darkness of that night, would she have t counted on the morrow thus? The banging of a distant door, then the sound of someone approacoing. An instant her heart stood still with a I vague, indefinablo hope, a wild, yearning fear. Could it he Paul?

When the door had olosed upon himl Paul turned to his slim, white-faced cousin. ' Let me look at you,' he exelaimed, devouring her with his dark ayes ' Here where we have been so happy together, let us part; and after to-night it will be best for both if God never lets me'see ooriempt ing fase agaiu.'

His face was salm, but somehow suggestive of fierce restraint. He was a strong man with strong passions, and possessing an iron will to sontrol them. SWill you sling for me that song you sang when first youoamse to visit aus?' he asked. ' I have a presentimert that it will he the last time I shall ever hear your voloe, and I want to remember it.

A few minute Itter, wrap'o4 in furs to the eyes, and nearly dietracted, Trick was lifted into the waiting cutter. Errio was about to accompany her, when his brother called him asede. and both returned to the house, only one returning a moment later. Even through her anxiety she felt grieved. Why had Paul so coolly parted with her ? Bushing to her eyes the tears froze there. She had no desire to speak, and Errio apparently was in the same mood.
