Yesterday is dead And lies at rest* No breathintr stirs The white-robed breast; The groans and sobbing Axe hushed at last, Thanks be to Heaven! Bach pains are past. Geekflot to rouse Its unquiet ghost; Conjure 110 pliantom Of what is fast; Come awaysoftly And makc no moan, Leaving thy perished hope Dead and alone. ~-Zoe Dana UhderhiUt in Scrwnere.
