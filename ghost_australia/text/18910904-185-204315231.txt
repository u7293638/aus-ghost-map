A CORRECTION. TO THE EDITOR. —Yours, &c; , WM M'CARTY, Secretary H.G C.F.C. 3rd September. SIR, —Kindly permit me to correct the report which appeared in to-day’s issue of your paper regarding the football match played yesterday between the Holy Ghost College and the School of Mines, The report states, the school “completely ran over their op ponents,” scoring 2 goals 21 bchinds to 1 goal 3 behinds. This is entirely incorrect. The final result, as furnished by the goal umpires and others, was 2 goals 2 behinds to 1 goal 4 behinds obtained by the college. I shall leave jour readers to judge from these tacts whether we were “completely run over” or not. Your contributor was also good enough to supply from his fertile brain such fictitious names as M'Girty, Murphy, 0 Shanassy, and O Ralloran: but whv did he omit O’Farrell •
