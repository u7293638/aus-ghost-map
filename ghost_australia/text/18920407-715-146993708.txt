John Taggert found him . .. self in pretty mnah the Bame condition ae the exoommanioated man in the Dark He cotild get so work; if kahadnothad j money-saved, he must. have starred or left j Castletown, - -About Christmas time, he met on thesea-shore the reotor of the church he; had once so regularly attended. He would j ■ have passed him with a dark, erected, face, j fan! the good man wonld not let him; hepnt oat his hand and looked John steadily and kindly In the face. "John," he stud, "do you think I am going to eat my Christmas dinner- with your dark, stubborn lace 'haunting me? Why have yon 'not oome to see me in your " Tour servants, sir, would have said I eft a bloody step at the door-stone. Woald fou have allowed me to stand upon your learth?" ~" Vi& yon ever try me, John! Torn now with me and oome to my study, for I have something to sayto yon.,1 Then the good man led him on to tell all the petty insults whose tremendous cumula tive power was fast turning him into a fierce, bitter hater ol his kind; and the poor fellow fonnd comfort even in this unburden ing of his grief, as well as in the unspoken sympathy that glistened in his listener's ayes. At last, when the heavy heart had on hardened all its agony, the rector said: , " John, why don't yon go away from Castletown?" " No, sir," fie answered, passionately; " I have done.nothing to ran away for. If there is any j ustioe in Heaven, it will clear me in the eight ofmy neighboreand kinfolk. loan wait; bnt I want to be hereon thB spot when God iB ready to hearmycauee." "Are yon suffering for money or neces saries?" • "Not mndh, sir; for since your reverence has been so kind to me, I will trust yon with my one Secret, Mary Boyd brings me many a boil Of bread and milk to the old Drnid ptwwi Oar people Yeptw tfrew after night, bot Mary loves me, and Jove ie not i isteaxe&of; ghosts. ■ ■ "1 am glad to hear this, John. Then Miry.ns well as I, believes yon to be inno cent! ' J?or a moment John could notspeab ; then with loll eyes, he answered : " For them words, sir, God bless yon ! If yon laud Mir; believe me innocent, I am not quite hopeleie. Mary iiaa cover doubted me ; Bhe sought me ont at onee in<my trouble and loneliness, I should have gone mad or died the last few weeks bat for her"' ; "!£ I should give yod work and a little cottage, would Miry marry you, and thus enable yotfto lire down, in your own horns, thoEe suspicions?" : *' Yes, sir, she would leave all her people and ooihe to me; bat that is a thing I would notdei her do. I would not stain my Mary's name,land, perhaps, the unborn innooent, i^h iny - misfortune. When i am proved rjgoiltlsss is time enough for me to marry." ... After this, John was sullen and eilent ifinbughj bnt h e did thework the reotor gave him,and tbssupport of a man eo respected tegin.in some slight degree, to change pnblio sentiment. •, But if tbere wae any change in his neigh bors, John took so notice of it. fie spoke tonoone, be did what work the rector gave bimi nr spent whole dayson ihewinter sea, comforted at rare, happy moments by & etolenwieitfromMary. And so the vests crepi on, hntil the middle of February. There had been/a heavy wind all day, and the sea and the wind rose together as the day ad vanced." Oping np U&lew; street, he met an 'old man who had once been hie hearty ad mirer and friend. The man had not spoken tohimsince hie trouble, but this time he ■said.timidly; ,'.'troing to be a very bad, dirty night, '.John " • • . ... res." replied John, curtly.. . "SmaU nreft pretty near Q liggin Point, flbpe'shemay hot get too near them Scarlet Books.'.' ■" If she 'Waa worth her sails she would hdre putiiito her harbor early to-day." It was the longest conversation John' had held with any of hie oomrade3 for months. sHesuddenly remembered the fact.and walked hutricdlj; away. . 'rpoor fellow 1" muttered the old man. V Htybe, nowi bo is none to blame." . ." Tnat night the storm grew wilder and mldeir aQtil midnight. and long before dawn, in. the pauses of the wind, oould be faintly heard-tho gnn ol a ship in distress. As soon as it was light. a crowd oi men gathered on the: shore, watching eagerly the craft In danger, ' It was hard to tell what she was— all her masts were gone, and she seemed to be rapidly breaking np. Yet the sea ran eo high, and the danger of launching a boat was so imminent, that the oldest, sailor feared to riekit. ft'JXhen John Taggert Bteppad eagerly for• ward. ' . " Will any man go with me,'' he said, " to save yonder poor fellows?" ; . No one spoke. Of all races the Manx are the most superstitious; and if John was 'really a murderer, they did not wish to share hiS'fate; soho one answered his appeal by word or movement. John set his lips and frowned darkly " ;U.f'Is; there any man here, then, who will fcelp " me launch a boat, and I will go alone f" . ' i'. I will," said the old man, who had spoken to him the day before. Now, if ever a human being was in a mood to command .winds and waters, John Taggert was that morning. He' leaped off the quay into the dropped boat, and all thought lor a mbmept that he had. found bis death, bat hresshtly ihey saw. him grasping both oars, hmfet'andhrm. ' Jnst then the rector reached the anxious crowd. 'f ttod bless yon, John I" he cried. But John heard not the blessing; hie face wasset seaward, every muscle, every sense wasBtraioed to the uttermost, and.yet he afterward said he was seosibleof no exertion, iilerbwed Bs a man in a dream might row. through marvellous dengers and difficulties iia ieaohed ihewxeok; then as he seated it, he gave'a great shout, for, clinging to a .remnant;of the mainmast, was a figure he ?teeKhnttooweiI.;lle;C y^^i^se,itbertainlywasPhdipBaviUel .^^l^l^^lhxowi^ihe^id^niot forget letmplhtihg J~cl hie .'heart in nnntterable ;®iid l^nght -bhe arowdfed boat "hack^leto ~ ' letowii :<jaBjr. trae aiways . a mystery to ^He^aHalwayainclinfiltoregatdthe "airus somewhat supernatural. In Ids o wn eonl he imparted to thefaalf-drowned men be came meavei' They obeyed him as if he had been S god, shd John had part oi his. reward in the shouts that greeted the boat as she slowly and dangerously neared the laod. But when John himselilifted Philip Seville bntol It, and in his strong, loving arms harried him as a mother would carry a child, men ware afraid to speak; for there was an exaltation in his manner that awed them; so, also, when the rector drew bim into the square, and a great crowd gathered round the justified man; there' were morehand-shakings than words, for the Manx are a eilent people, pdore given to actions than professions. Philip's explanation was a natural one. Early one moxniDg, he bad met out at sea the yacht of an, old companion, and learned from him that his elder brother bad been killed by a railway accident, and that the lamily lawyer was looking lor bim. As there was only two steamers a week between the Island and Liverpool, and as it would be im possible to catch the one sailing that day. his friend had cfiered to ran him across to Liverpool in his yacht. Without much thought, he bad accepted the ofiar, leaving a note in the boat to inform his landlady what to do with "his eSects if anyone found the boat, which was almost certain to be the ease. He had also instructed bis lawyer to write to Castletown; bnt both directions had tailed. Probdbly tbe note had been blown away; and thelawyer, amid the more important business otEetUingflp and iTansierring-the estate, had hot thought the few sovereigns lying in Castletown of urgent interest, and of graver consequences be was totally igoorant. Then Philip had been compelled to leave England immediately with a sister, whose delicate health the shock of her brother's death had greatly injured. Amid the deligbtB of Bsme, he forgot his Castletown life, until one morning, about a month previous, in a package of delayed English letters, he found one from the rector of Castletown, detailing the wretched consequences of Mr. Seville's disappearance. This letter had been sent to the family seat after Pbilip'a departure for Italy, had been forwarded to his lawyer in London, and, after many delays, finally reached the right person. Without a moment's delay, Philip had started ior England, and finding that in winter steamers only ran once a week be tween the Island and Liverpool, he hired a small. craft to faring him over at once to Castletown, and he had thus met the storm that had bo nearly proved fatal. There are some calamities that never meet adequate compensation, for Job does not always re cover his eons and daughters, but everything that a friendship consecrated and sealed in the very presence of death could devise, and everything^that abundant wealth conld per form, Philip did to recompense the weary, shameful months that were irreclaimable. Henceforward, John sailed his own ship, and Mary received as her wedding gift the prettiest cottage in her native- village, and together they have seen many good days, and had their full share of prosperity. "Ndw yon never smell the odor of liquor on my breath," said the young clergyman, expostulating with Staggers for his bibulous propensities. "No; what do you do for it?" asked Staggers, with deep interest. The German of it.—" That Blythe is a good deal of a hypocrite." " In what way ?" " Why, he's the kind o! a man that would Strain at a beer and swallow a kummel." Hojv do you like that youug Yale man you employed ae messenger, Mr Barkins?" "Tie's a very good fellow," returned the banker; " be lets me do pretty much as I please,"
