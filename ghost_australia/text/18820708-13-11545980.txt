TUE GREAT FETES IN CON STANTJNOPLM. (inOM OUI! OM.S* OOlUtEbPONDENl.) CONSTANTINOPLE, April 14. Since the day on which the reigning Sultan girded on tho sabre at the Mosque of Eyoub Constantinople has had little acquaintance with fetes and festivals Under the pressure first of the war and then of a daily increasing poverty, all the glory and brilliancy of her former life have died out in a manner which only those who have resided continuously in or about Constantinople for the last seven years can thoroughly appreciate. It is true that in the course of last year the conductors of the state trials endea voured to give to the procedure a certain amount of spectacular importance, but the gloomy simulacrum of an Imperial show which they endeavoured to present inspired no glowing anticipations, and has left behind it only bitter regrets For all purposes of public enjoyment Constantinople ha3 been, since the close of 1876, a mere City of the Dead, haunted by the ghost of a defunct Parliament, by the spectral souvenirs of patriotic aspirations, and by the melancholy shades of frozen or starved fugitives from all parts of the empire Now, however, she is to have an annus mirabilis " " Already, labouring with a mighty fete, She shakes the rubbish from her mounting brow And hopes to have renewed her charters date Which Heaven will to the death of time allow !" On descending to plain prose we discover this to mean that in the early days of May the people of Constantinople are to be treated once more to the fete-, which they most love, and with which the older Sultans have, in part from political and in part from in terested motives, been most willing to indulge them At the beginning of May the Imperial Princes are solemnly to be inducted into the army of true believers by the observance of a customary though not obligatory rite At the same time 5,000 other neophytes will be inducted in the same manner at the Sultan a expense, and 5000 new robes have already been commanded for these little candidates for the joys of para dise Vast preparations are being made for the public fetes, which are to take place im the vicinity of the Yildiz Kiosk, where the Sultan resides, and which will extend over several days It is not probable that these fetes can rival in brilliancy those of former reigns, to an account of which the greater part of the following lines will be devoted Before doing this however, a few words upon the rite itself may not be without interest In the first place the rite is of the very remotest antiquity It assuredly was not instituted by Abraham, for it can be proved to have existed in Egypt many centuries before Abraham went to Egypt, and, a fortiori, many centuries before either Isaac or Ishmael was born, Nor is it exclusively confined to any one section of the human family It existed in the West Indies, in Central and South America, in Mexico, and even in the Society Islands, before Europeans became acquainted with those countries. Probably it originated as "periodical fasts" and the ' Lay of Rest " originated, on sanitary grounds, but we need go no further into that part of the subject. Neither is it re stricted by religious creed The pagan Arabs observed it before the time of Mahomet, and the Christian Copts of Abyssinia observe it to this day Nor is it absolutely obligatory except upon the Jews Mahomet found it in force amongst the pagan Arabs, and left it in ex istence without commanding or even sanction ing its existence. Again, its observance at any peculiar age is not obligatory. With the Jews the eighth day, with the Arabs the thirteenth year, with the Turks the seventh year, are the canonical periods, but these have been outstepped again and again The rite has been observed, and may again be observed by adults of all ages It is not supposed even by the strictest Mahometans that children who die before the observance of this rite are lost On the contrary, when a child so circumstanced is dead, the mother breaks its little finger to indicate that par force majeure tho rite has not been observed. On the other hand, Moslem mothers, who think that their sons may enter the army, are careful to have the rite performed, as they fear that if the child were to be slaun in battle his body, for want of the distmctive mark, might be regarded as that of an unbe liever. It is probable that this feeling helped to give birth to the rite For ages many races, trubes, and nations have desired to set thcmselves up as a "Peculiar People." Hence, probably, comes the strange spread 0f this rite in parts of the earth in which we never should have expected to find it. In Europe, Asia, and Africa it is a " profession of faith , ' in South America and Australasia it is a "totem" or " tattoo " With regard to Asia and Africa, both Tournefort and Ludolphus, who travelled the one in Asia Minor and the other in Abyssinia—200 years ago, were taught to regard the rite as a mere outward symbol of adhesion to a particular creed (and the creed cited to Tournefort was quite dif ferent from the creed cited to Ludolphus), which might be dispensed with just as " vestments" may be dispensed with in our day. Tournefort, indeed, was led to believe that the rite ought not to be observed until the candidates were from 10 to 12 years of age, and could understaud its meaning, but this seems to have been by no mans a general opínion, and the observance of the rite seems to have been purely perfunctory. Be this as it may, the Ottoman Turks have always dis played a marked adhesion to the rite, and some of their foremost leaders have distin- guished themselves by the splendour of the fetes with which they have surrounded the ceremonies. When Mahomet the Conqueror returned discomfited from his unsuccessful campaign in Hungary, he sought to regain his popularity by giving in Adrianople fetes, which lasted for four days, in honour of the observance of the rite by two of his sons, Bayezid and Moustapha, The fetes were marked by displays of horsemanship, and tight-rope dancing, and jugglery, which alto- gether astonished the venal Greek author who had placed his pen at the disposal of tho conqueror of his race. It was nothing to Chalcondylas that Mahmoud had captured Constantinople. He could merely see the " horse play" and the "ground and lofty tumbling " It may be noted here that the Turks have always been skilful rope dancers, in fact, tight and slack rope dancing, and even "merry go rounds " and lofty swings, were introduced into England from Constantinople. One interesting fact is recorded by the Greek historian. It is that Mehmet Pacha, the Beylerbey of Rou melia, brought his Imperial master a present of 50,000 ducats. Under these cir- cumstances it is not wonderful that the ceremony was graced by the presence of an assembly of wise men, who discussed points of doctrine under the presidency of the Sultan, and by a concourse of dervishes and fakeers, who expounded their own peculiar views to the assembled multitudes. In 1530, when Soleyman tho Magnificent (otherwise called the Legislator, perhaps because he broke every law, human and divine) caused the rite to be observed by the three sons of his first wife, and again in 1530, when he caused it to be observed by the two sons of the famous and also infamous, Russian Roxalana, the fetes were on a scale of far greater magnifi cence, and much longer duration. On these occasions the fetes were held in Constan tinople, in the atmeidan or hippodrome, or as Sigurd, the crusader, would have called it " Hte Padreimer." Here, Sigurd had seen the Emperor Alexina sitting in state, presiding over the public games, and receiving and disperising gifts. Here, too, came Soleyman in 1530 and 1539 to take his seit on a lofty throne, to hear the disputes of the ulemas, to witness the charlatanerie of the fakeers, to smile at the buffooneries of the show men, and to receive rich presents from the great and small dignitaries of his empire, and even from the repre sentatives of some foreign powers But the glory of these fetes touched its highest point in the reign of Murad the Third, who was anxious to apply the rite with peculiar splendour to his eldest son, Mohammed The decadence of the Turkish Empire had commenced, but the Sultan was unconscious of this, and he issued the following circular to his vassals and to many foreign powers :— " 'To the Most Illustnous, &c.; " By this Imperial letter, decorated with our monogram, Toughra we inform you most noble and august sir, that it being a sacred and indispensable duty for the elect and blessed for the Mohometan people, but especially for the sultans, monarch, sove reigns, as also for the princes of the blood of their august family, to follow entirely the laws nad precepts of our holy prophet, the corypheus of the patriarchs, and of the celes tial envoys, and to observe religiously what- ever is prescribed in our sacred volume, where it is said ' Follow the example of Abraham thy father, from whom thou derivest the illustrious name of Mussulman "We have consequently resolved to fulfil this precept respecting the act of circumcision im the person of our well beloved son Prince Mohammed, of that prince who, covered with the wings of the celestial grace and of the divine assistance, advances in happiness and reputation in the glorious path to the im- perial throne, of that prince who, honoured with the same name as our holy prophet, is most justly the object of admiration to our high and sublime court, of that prince who is the most beautiful flower in the parterre of equity and sovereign dominion, the most precious shoot in the garden of grandeur and majesty , the finest pearl in the monarchy , the most luminous star in the firmament of serenity, peace, and public hap- piness. It is now necessary that the vine dresser of circumcision should apply his keen bill to this new plant, to this charm ing rose tree, which is the stem of those precious fruits and fortunate branches in the great orchard of the Khaliphate, and of the Supreme Power. This august ceremony will therefore be ob served, under the auspices of Providence, in the approaching spring, at the re turn of the season when nature recovers her youth and beauty—presents to the eyes of mortals the charms of Paradise, and obliges us to admire the wonders of the Most High. After the example of our glorious ancestors, who used always those solemnities throughout the whole empire to invite all the nobles and generally all the officers in places of trust and dig nity, we send you the present supreme order, to give you the same notice, amd to invite jou to participate the honour and joy of tihs festival, wihch will be celebrated in the most exhilarating manner. May the Supirm e Being deign to bless its commence ment amd its end !" &c; A stern necessity has compelled me to omit the most curious portion of this circular from pages intended for general readers, but students of history may find it in the first volume of the Chevalier D'Ohssons great work on the Ottoman Empire, and will be much amused by the perusal. Sultan Murad's fetes, which are now about to be described, required a year for their pre piirntion, and it is on this account, sa well sa on account of their supreme extravngance and brilliancy, that they have been selected as a typeal illustration They were beyond doubt very magnificent, und to describe them properly we ought to borrow the pen and the style of an Oriental chronicler, and of such chromclers many were hard at work on this occasion There we may be sure were Russell Pacba, Forbes Ley, Wallace Effendi, and Gay Tchelebi, all eager to note the évents of the period and to narrate them in flowing Turkish verse The files were held in the hippodrome, where might be seen the Sultan, who, of course, was "The Light of the World, "'Jhe Shadow of Allah upon Earth," and " The Dispenser of Crowns to the Potentates who sat on 'Thrones ' There, too, was the hero of the fête, who, of course, was the reflection of the "shadow of Allah upon earth " There, too, were the sultanas, who are said to have brought with them au entire arsenal of sweetmeats and confitures There, also, were nine elephants-not one of whom was named Jumbo-17 lions, 19 leopards, 21 camels, and 14 giraffes It must have been a spectacle that would havo driven Barnum wild with jealousy. There was a fountain of ¡sugar candy, which was so large that it required 20 men to carry it to a stationary castle of the same material Then there was a day on which the greater and lesser grandees brought presents to the Sultan, and another day, on which mai y Greek, Albanian, and Armenian rene grides pressed forward to embrace the faith of the Moslems , and another day on which the pagea of the palace were brought in seventy coaches to kiss the hand of their Royal master But what was this to the day on which the " men of the law " were feasted sumptuously at seventy tables, or to the sham fight, or to the destruction of an enormous boar by three lions, who ate the poor pig up before the spectators This also is noteworthy, that the procession of the artisaus and craftsmen of Stamboul be fore their sovereign, with specimens of their work, required 21 days for its completion, and all the while, round the stately obelisk of Thothmes and that glorious relic of Grecian freedom, the serpent column from Delphi, the barbaric games went on, to the delight of the Hanouma and their children whose dresses made the Hippodrome look like a bed of tulips. There was, how ever, one drop of bitterness in the cup of pleasure The janissaries, as usual, were dissatisfied with the largesse given to them, and were with difficulty prevented from breaking out into mutiny, But at length the fete came to us costly end, and the hero of it was at liberty to betake himself to his bride, and then to proceed to the great province of which he had been made the governor in anticipation of the fete. And now let me write a few words on the ultimate sequel of these magnificent parades of imperial power and imperial extravagance Of the two sons in honour of whom Sultan Mamoud gave his fetes one was put to death by his father. Of the five sons in honour of whom Soleyman gave his fetes, two died early, two were put to death by their father, while the fifth, who succeeded Soleyman on the throne, became known as Selim the Drunkard, and died from the effects of a fall on the marble floor of a bath when he was intoxicated As for the hero of Murad's fetes (the "charm- ing rose tree ' ), he signalised his accession to the throne by putting to death his 19 brothers, and he was, after an unprosperous reign, found dead in his bed 55 days after a dervish had predicted to him that in 55 days a very great calamity would befall him. As I record these facts I recall these words of the great apostle of the Gentiles—" For circum cision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the command- ments of God !"
