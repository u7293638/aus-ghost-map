THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY. A deputation from tbe council of tbe Zoological So- ciety was introduced to tho Colonial Secretary yes- terday by the Hon. R.H. White, M.L.C., the object of the deputation being to ask for monetary assistance for the society. Amongst the gentlemen present were Messrs. Chas'. Moore, William Beaumont, J.P., W. H. Catlett, Neild, and Captain Ghost. It was pointed out to tho Premier that the society was in a very embar- rassed financial condition, and it was asked that a sum of £4000 should be placed in the Estimates, as this amount was required to re- lieve it from debt. Tho society, it was also stated, had received no assistance from the Government last year, as the money voted, £3000, had never been appropri- ated. Sir HENRY PARKES briefly replied, promising that he would do his best to obtain the money for them.
