PUBLIC EDUCATION—A CONTRAST. TO THE EDITOR. —Yours, &c.;, UNSECTARIAN. SIR,— For over 20 years the London school board, with its 500,000 children of every creed, has included in its daily curriculum the study of the Bible. For the same period the Victorian Elucation Department, with about half ns many children, has forbidden any part of the acriptureß to be lead daring school Imure. The London boßrd expends £2.000,000 annually of public money in education, including primary religion. The Victorian one spends £650.000 on education excluding religion. The Victorian teacher is forbidden to preach, teach religion, Bay prnyere, or Bing hymns in a State school building outside school hourn, and even on Sundays. The London one is directed to in clude bucli exercises in his daily work. Such a contrast is surely Bharp enough, but a recent circular issued by the Lon don board to its thousands of teachers ought to arrest the attention of even the pro fessional obstructionist of Bible reading in State schools. Here follow a few extracts from the circnlar, which may be read in the columns of the Southern Cross of the 23rd March:—“ The Bible is your text-book,'from which you should give such explanations in the Chrietian religion as are suited to the oipacities and ages of the various children. In the course of the lessons, as opportunity occurs, you will impress upon the children the relation in which they stand to God the Father ub their Creator; to God the Son as their Redeemer; and .to God the Holy Ghost as- their Sanctifier. The Board cannot nppro'vo of any teaching which denies either the divine or the human nature of the Lord Jesus Christ. No restriction is placed upon your liberty of choice of hymns, concluding with the Doxology, or prayers other than the Lord’s Piayer.” And, it must be noted, this extension of Christian teaching is deliberately adopted after 20 years’ experience oLßible reading in London public schools.
