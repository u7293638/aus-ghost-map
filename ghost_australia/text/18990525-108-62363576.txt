PORTFOLIO. On Trinity Sunday, we put together and sunm up, as it were, what we know about God, and Ilis heavenly nation, and speak of Iis three-fold Oneness, three Persons, yet one God. We will not ask how this can be 1-How can there be thcee Persons and yet but one God : It is enough to know that so it is. And it is not strange that God's nature should be at mystery to ns, when we know so little of our own; for who can tell how two such distinct things as soul and body are joined together to maike up one man Who can tell how we lire, or think, or see, or more I We know ahlost nothing about ourselves: must we expect, then, to know every thing about God I Let us come to what is practical; for be sure what God is pleased to tell us in His Word is told to an.ske ns better, not to make us wiser. Well, then, what does this doctrine of the IHoly Trinity teach us about onr stlres I It tells us that God the Father made us, that God the Son redeemed us, and thllat God the Holy Ghost sancti lies uli and makes ?s holy. We see, then, how mighty this doctrine of the IHoly Trinity bears on our hearts and lives. .. . It is the very foundation of our faith, the very ground work of religion. Religion is that which hinds ns to God. This doctrine of the Holy Trinity tells us about God, explains ton us, so .ar as we may know it, the nature sf God. Oh ! then, let us, " hold fast the form of sound words whlich we have heard," It is a precious legacy whlich has been handed down to io from the first; for, "Tihi is the Catholic faith"; that is, this is the faith of the Church of Christ in all ages, and in all lands. Let us very earnestly play, and strive, to keep this faith " whole and nndefiled."--?Biolsop Imals ohae Ioc.
