It never -jccurred to him, or his friends, thatie would return to the school. At that institution there was ? little change. The Tiger never inquired for - the boy, he may possibly hav« known— th* means of knowing such things at the com mand of this -wealthy Spaniard were far greater than that possessed by the city «ecr«t service; and it was an' exceedinerlr curious tact — as stated by the chief of police — that Spanero had gone on to the Chamber of Commerce once, as a total stranger, and made a small fortune. He sold ''futures' in consols. Three days after, a Wiling packet came with the news that consols had drop ped to such an extent that 8panero reaped a ' great harvest. It was secretly understood that in some way Spanero was interested in certain foreign governmental affairs, but not the slightest clue could be obtained as to the nature of this interest. These weeks were not without events. The man who kept the restaurant from whence the Tiger's meals were brought, had a little private office in the rear corner. This 'small room was noticeable on account of its bareness, the furniture consisting of two fragmentary chairs. And that was all. The walls were not plastered, but ceiled. It had but one window, and that was un usually high and small. If there were any place to store things in this little -den it must have been in the wall by secret panel, for not even a box rested upon the floor. There was a door leading into the restaur ant, and another opening to the idley at the reai\ These doors are trimmed with spring ' locks, both opening from within. The restaurant was peculiar in that it did not seem to have, nor seek, a regular custom. Very few who dropped in accidentally re peated the accident. There was.A waiter and he was deaf. The cook rooin was a rear room in the nextbuilding, connected by a. swing door. TJ4s side of the square ex tended into the disreputable /district, assort of thieves' quarters. Every, city has such sections, and usually in close' proximity to the respectable city. In this building a part of the history we are narrating transpires. At 1 o'clock in the morning, two of the .most . interesting characters it will ever be onr mi&forjrane; to ; meet occupy the grimy and insecure chairs mentioned as the furniture of tte^ private room. One of these was the proprietor of ttie restaurant. His round, lumpy head and high bare forehead were--^sannount«d.. with, a closely cropped covering of -iiair^a-stvle ' not at all in vogue at that time. ' 'This man was probably forty-five years -of ego. The face was broad and brown, ;Jeathtery; and lines rather than wrinkles crossed it, out-, lines of passion and sensuality. I But his ' mouth was not thick and -animal,1- on' the\\_ contrary it was thin, somewhat broad, and intensely determined. If the reader has in mind a picture of Spanero, let this individ ual be the contrary in feature. He was un der bight, but stoutly built. His clothing was of dark gray etnff, old and greasy, and bjg hands clumsy and repulsive. He was a powei-f ul man and a character. A candle was flaring in £he .room on, a chimney cornice, and cast an unhealthy .and- . — * ? m« »«bv-j upon xtus person «ud his companion. The latter was gaunt; jail jlSd 1 angular. Chest sunken, bald head, always covered by a consumptive-looking old wreck of a cap; he was of ashen-grav countenance large, red-streaked eyes. When he moved, his limbs mored only. His nose was slight ly Romanized, and his teeth were waiting for the dentist of the future. He was a spare, repMsive-looking creature, whom vou would rqfther , not meet in the night without your club and a reliable dog.; And yet, when he spoke, you listened to a soft, kindly voice— a voice which you would say you had. heard befqre; and you would ransack memory to find the owner of the original — among all the gentlemen you had met in the past. On his feet were sheep skin shoes, with wool left on the bottomk ?''' ? The gaunt, thin-faced man had a bad, : graveyard cough. -\ 'Idunna see, Stub, what ye do wi' that cough whin ye're;ooty mon?' said the short man, whose name, ' so *ar as Boston culture could inform u$,~wss 'Spetecs.'-' .... ~v~ _ 'What wo|iai.iHf doing wM ainytbihsT' - that I didn't want?'

'Hev a care'about the Span yard. ..Our mon be a Spunyard.' 'And I knew that, too — or I wouldn't have been here.' And so the interesting twain sat and talk ed for a quarter of an hour longer. It is not hard to see that Stub has been a man of parts. His language has but a slight mix ture of dialect, and even at this time accent and pronunciation pointed to no inconsider able culture. The thieves vocabulary had not yet been invented. But the language of Speters was stall more of a puzzle — simply because, his dialect was strained, and evi dently a poor attempt to reach the North England type. With all the depravity evi dent in the make up of Stub, there was no question but that Speters was the most' des perate villain of the two. A peculiar knock was -heard on the outer door, a key was thrust into the lock, and the Tiger entered. . ? ;- ? - He glanced at Stub a moment, and turn ing to Speters, said: 'Is this the man?' 'The man' had bis cold, sfeel-gray eyes on the Tiger. It was not the glance that he bad before cast upon a supposed ghost. It had something of strength in it. He took another pill. 'This is the mun,' replied Speters. ; 'And has he done his work to-night?' 'Befoor we ahnswer thut, cap,' said the short, stout villain, bringing his small, ser-] pent eyes upon the Tiger, 'we will talk uv soomthing ulse.' ?;?. 'Well, talk of what you want to, but get off from that brogue and do your practicing on the devil.' 'That is all right, sir; but that is not ?what I have to #&y;,' returned the villain, changing his method of speech. 'If you have anything you wieh to say be fore this man; go ahead.' ? 'It is before this very man,' said Speters, sullenly. - ? Spanero watiraiaicross the floor, a heavy frd wn resting upon his face. ' 'Drive on,11 he muttered. 'All £ have to say is a derQ of a little. It is that we -want to know the bilk in the glitter for us,' \- 'Have you not been well paid for your services?' 'jSoo, we ha' noot.'

'Yes, and can get into it withoutbreakiug a wall or a lock.' 'Give it to us easy, Stub.' *T faithl Bpeak the truth. I saw the keys taken from a panel when X was in the room.' 'The devil' l' : - 'Yes,' said Stub, 'I stood in the fireplace, and, curse my miserable soul, if I didn't have to hustle to get there, when a fine old lady entered with a candle— and all that crowd in the other rooms,1 too.' 'Scraps!' ejaculated the other man. 'Yes, Speters, and, by the ragged St Francis, the old lady looked right at me, squarely— and she didn't know it— I didn't have my party clothes on, you see.' 'She would have sworn she looked at the devil!' . 'She unlocked a little panel in the old fashioned wainscotted wall, and took outrthe. keys. The jim end of my knife will foroeit, and there are but two doors to the vault. It is off from an old dining-room — used in the old Dutch days. But the most singular thing was what I saw in the crowd, through the windows — the young ?woman who was with my spook — the one that fainted away.' 'Spook?' asked Speter. 'Yes. The slimins with the big eyes. The other one of myself. 'Wonder if that spook isn't Pinnie?' 'The chap what the boss wanted us to put under cover?' 'That's the chick, Stub.' 'Well this fellow will not go under sod again — not until I go!' 'Well, let us go hence,' said Speters, suddenly changing the subject. Without a word the two men passed out into the restaurant room. They silently wended their way behind a liquor counter, lifted a trap door, and, in the darkness, si leutly dropped to the cellar ? Without stumbling over any of the nu merous kegs and casks, the villainous twair made their way to the corner of the cellar, directly under the private room they had re cently left. Speters scratched one of the then recently invented lucifer matches, and lighted two bull's-eye oil lanterns. . . In another moment the two men were dig ging in a passageway, the direction of which was toward the foundations of the 'school building.' The corner of the brick work of that inte rior building was, perhaps, 150 feet away from the rear of the restaurant, and in that interior structure, on the first floor, was the vault or the treasure room of Spanero. Upon the outside was but a blank wall up to the fourth fioor, and then a single window mark ed the place where the Spanish artist's private room was, adjoining his office. And here we leave the precious twain to their dark work— dn which ,the Tiger was probably not a partner. CHAPTER XIII. HOPB IIGHTLY, AND MAX GOD 6TAT ET YOU. One day Cpnpad North stepped quietly into his mother's 'work-room,' at an unusual hoqr for one so full of business. 'Who gave you permission to come in here, sirrah?' said the parent. 'I come, demanding a surrender of this castle.' ?'.--... ... ... . _ 'To whom?' ^qiL'To the invader. ' fe^Do you come peaceably?' she asked; pointing a cambric needle at the intruder. ; 'W-ell, mother,'' he replied in- a. low tone, 'send your garjpson away. .1 wish to talk ? to. jrou alone.' So 'Milly,' the maid, capit ulated and withdrew, and then the young man began his conversation by kicking over the work-basket full of buttons and things. 'I have been thinking a great deal about Miss Lamont,' he said. 'I suppose I think : : too much about her. Have you any remedy for such a complaint?' ' ;? - 'I know of none, except to get better ac quainted with her and find out that she is .. mortal, like the rest of us, my son.' eBftt how can I properly pursue an object wife which I never came in contact?
