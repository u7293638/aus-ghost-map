THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CLERGY. a ?'?-' (Speaker.) The clergy are not what they were they have undergone a tolerably thorough transformation The typical rector of the old High Church school TOO an easy natured, good-humoured person to social and kindly to busy himself about other men's matters, skilled in the best vintages, and riding well to hounds- bntheisnownsoftotoasSqutro Western IIo belongs to the lights and shadows ofotherdnys and we think of him tenderly as the fit clerical counterpart of the, good old English gentleman In his place person of quite another sort had come zealous, ubiquitous, busybodymh, with a hand in as. everything that goes on in his parish or town, hearing of. anything, here and 61 anywhere jealous of what he calls the Scots, A stone is of the schools, with the keenest scent for all that promises benefit or threatens injury to the Church. The old clergy were a humorous class told good stones as they loved good Mine, and they knew how to brighten the dulness of a heavy dinner or a timid tea party but humour is not the strong point of the new clergy Mo is too full of seriousness to allow the dainty art of putting witty thought into light same speech to be cultivated in a word, they are so grimly in earnest that, though they often seem ridiculous, they seldom appear to feel it These changes he on the surface, but they are the effects of currents that run deep underneath They mean that the clerical role has been changed because the clerical mind has been transformed in a perfectly novel Houses the clergy has o become the Church, and in a degree unknown since the Reformation the Church his its policy shaped and its being controlled by the clergy They have as a result become potent factors in public affairs forces that operate in politics, and that politicians must reckon with, though they are so now that their impact has only been felt There has been no time to calculate the amount of energy stored, or what its expenditure may portend , but one thing is certain it involves the conflict of Liberal principles with what the French call Clericalism And clericalism is a creature of an altogether different order from the Church The Church is a large and varied society made up of many minds and many ideas, wherein the priesthood of the Christian house plays no inconsider- able part, but clericalism is the fanaticism of a caste whose passion is power-it is the jealousy of an organised order for its interests and of their enemies, real or imaginary The conflict of a nation with a case may be deadly, but must be sordid, for it is the struggle of a people to escape suffocation at the hands of a power which is all the more earthly that it claims to be the sole adequate ministry of Heaven One of the main causes of this transformation is the idea which has been the main factor of the ecclesiastical revival, that of the place and function of the clergy What has been so incorrectly termed the High Church movement has in reality been less concerned with the Church than with the ministry It has exalted the ministry at the expense of the Church It was the exact contrary with the Evangelical revival it was religious, not clerical It emphasised the spiritual and ethical, change of heart and of mind, the authority of truth the need of divine action, the impotence of men, the potency of God The preacher was nothing, the penance and energy of the Holy Ghost w are all in all Butnowtho supreme question is the covenanted rights of the clergy , they are the channels and distributors of grace, necessary to the efficacy of the Sacraments, the pillars and ground of the Church. The translation of this belief into fact is the clericalism which aspires to control this life as well as to fix and to anticipate the awards of the life to come The end of this sort of thing is indeed certain There is nothing more characteristic of the English mind than dislike of a hierarchy, and a hierarchy is exactly what the English clergy have become or are becoming This is the feature that makes the situation so full at once of promise and of danger Of promise, for were the trains formation once complete sturdy English common sense and resolute English self- respect could awaken and assert themselves in a way Radical enough to leave nothing to be desired , of danger, for in the process of change we may have some of the liberties filched from us which were won with difficulty, and they will be lost with bitterness and regains I not without labour and we, eat and sorrow For questions that involve divine rights whether of kings who govern wrongly and yet live to govern, 01 of clergy who claim to stand in an Apostolic succession and his Apostles and yet are without Apostolic inspiration or spirit-have in them an ignoble clement, for they place eminence in office rather than in character, in status rather than an ethical quality or moral manhood They have, therefore, a depressing or lowering effect on the whole idea of life-obeeurrag the noble sub ordinating intrinsic excellence to accidental position or adventitious pmUego And they necessitate a discussion which is near of kin to a personal wrangle, the question whether this man has or that, man has not the right and title to be held a minister of God A meaner controversy, or one more morally mischievous for the man who wages it on behalf of himself or his order, it is hardly possible to conceive And its practical expression is a clergy violent in public and arbitrary in religious affairs, ready to drive a nation whose higher intelligence and finer genius they have not learned to under stand or appreciate Besides this general causes many subsidiary causes have been at work in the same direction For example what was once the main has become a secondary source of clerical supply The clergy are not drawn as of old from the gentry of the wealthier classes The new vicar is not 60 common as he once was where a living is poor and expensive it is not so easy as it used to be to find a man whose means enable him to take it And the need of the Church has been the opportunity Of her humbler sons Her extraordinary expansion at home and abroad has created a demand for men which they have been forward to satisfy, making their way into orders as literate or as non collegiate As a consequence the clerical ranks have not only been enormously enlarged, but enlarged by classes v whose claims to consideration are altogether clerical and in no respect social And their natural tendency is to make the most of their orders, to stand on their dignity as priests rather than on their prestige as men of family This has, no doubt, helped to w weaken the older Social feeling of the clergy, and to intensify their feeling as a case that is, as a separate order M Those distinction lies in their being an order consecrated and apart, and not in their connection with society or the landed interest But what is most significant in this process of transformation is its effect on the public character and civil action of the clerical body It is making it, in the very degree that it becomes more intensely sacerdotal, more acutely secular The more the clergy feel them- so!, as to be the Church, the less spiritual will they become and mix the more in public affairs The more they consciously become identical with the great institution they administer the more will they challenge what seems to offend any one of its interests, even though the very least, and set themselves to defend all its privileges and enlarge the already wide sphere of its power This tendency is seen in many things and directions, and has, for the moment, its most conspicuous expression in education The clerical claim best signifies that the clergy are urging the State to open its purse and allow them to dip their hands more deeply into it And this will make them politicians in spite of theuujohes The party that will deal most liberally with them is the party they will support the party that sincerely believes that the schools which the people maintain the people ought to control is the party which the clergy will feel bound to oppose The old condition of things is being completely reversed From the Act of Uniformity onwards statesmen have tended to use Church and clergy as counters in the game of politics, but now we are beginning to see the clergy use politicians and parties as means to their sectional ends The flag is full of danger to the State, for it means the introduction into owed polities of the fiercest, the most consuming and unreasoning of passions But it is pregnant with certain disaster to the Church, for the Church that is inextricably bound up with a party may on occasion rise with it into power, but will assuredly fall with it from power, and while the party may rise from its fall, to the Church that goes down with it there can be neccesary And so the issue of the process which we have formed the trans- formation of the clergy is this The attempt of clericalism to use the state for its own ends will be the recoil of the State from the Church which clericalism Dad captured The victory of the Clericals may endure for a moment, but if the history of the past is only a prophecy of the future, the end must be early disaster and final defeat for the cause they SO zealously oajouBO, by a contrite so unwisely to pv-o_Â«_->
