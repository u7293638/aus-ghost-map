' THE A US1 KALIAN CHAMPION SWEEPSTAKES. * THE announcement in our town edition last week, The Barber liad swum ashore from the wreck of the Adwella, appears to bo qnite true; but we are not in possession, at pre-, scut, of any particulars of this unexpected turn up for the hackers'of the Adelaide horse. Jlr Hurtle Fisher, who has arrived in Melbourne, and who is next door to being as well as ever he was, lias no idea how The Barber escaped; wc miist, therefore, con tent ourselves with the fact that'he is in the laud of the living, and wait his arrival amongst us, which is expected to-day, per Lady Bird, from Portland, before our curiosity can be satisfied as to how and when he reached the shore. On Thursday we had a peep at Zoe and Ziugara, at their residence at South Yarra; they both liad coats on them like a looking glass, :uid appeared to be as lively as kitteus. Not a ghost of Zoe's shy leg was to be seen in iier box, and lier owner (whose interest it would be rather to encourage the report of .her lameness) and trainer denied that she had ever gone amiss since her arrival in Victoria. As a proof of Mr Tait's confidence in her, he has backed her for seven hundred, since his return from Syduey, 100 to 7 and 100 to 8. There continues to exist a strong desire to lay against Miss Bowe, and we have not heard of a single investment on hand for the hist week. Strop is very firm at 100 to 25, and the longest price offered against Io," on Thursday evening, was 100 to 8\. Sailor, Quickstep, The Moor, Phoebe, and Alice Hawthorn remain good lavorites at last week's quotations, and Xutwith has been backed during the week at all prices between 100 to 0 aud 100 to 3. On Satur day, when the report of The Ruber's escape had been firmly established, he found several friends to entrust Mm with a few fivers at 20 to 1, but later in the week the same odds have been laid against him and Black Bess coupled From last Saturday's Era we learn that "No business has been transacted at Tattersall's this week; but a full muster of the members will be convened immediately after the issue of the Windsor entries. It is proposed, moreover to institute a L5 or Â£10 sweep on the Cham pion nice as soon as the acceptances are de clared and a sufficient number of the mem bers can be got together for the purpose."
