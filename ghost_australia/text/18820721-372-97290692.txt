poetry BERTIE. BY EMMA ALICE BROWNE. Drop the blind, and draw the curtain Close about the lattice Bill; How the Norther wails and clamors, And the night is black and shrill ! There are ghosts abroad — the spectres Of the happy long ago : Wraiths that rise to haunt me ever When the dreary north winds blow, As in winters long ago. ^f-_ Hark! was that the wild rain falling In the dark, deserted- street ? t ' Of the fitful pit-a-patter , Of a baby's restless feet ? Was that cry a gusty murmur Of the wind without the door ? . . 1 Or a childish voice that calls me From the -distance evermore ? When the rain is at the door ? ' . From the hoUow* darkness inching,- . -Tender arms my neck entwine, i - Baby ringlets brush «iy worn check, Baby lips are pressed to mine ! Nay, 'tis but a haunting memory Cheats my hungry heart's despair ! Yonder stands his shrouded cradle, And his little empty chair Mocks my hungry heart's despair! Yet he cometh to me ever When the night and darkness fall ; When the wild winds shrill and clamor, And the rain is over all ! While i count my hoarded treasures — Precious trifles dear to me ! — : -. ? Sonny curl, or half-worn garment Bich with cunning broidery — ;? a All of him that's left to me ! -; W Battered toys and baby's picture, ? With ' Our darling' scrawled beneath. And his rosy coral, dotted With the prints of little teeth. Oh, the dainty, scarlet stocking ! Oh, the tiny silken shoe1 — Worn threadbare, where I so often Kissed the pink toes peeping thro' — Baby's first, enchanting shoe! So with loving hands I take them From their secret hiding-place : Torn them o'er with lingering touches — Kiss the chubby pictured face; While the salt tears, slow and bitter, Wrung from motherhood's despair, Fall upon bis shrouded cradle : And his little empty chair Mocks my ?hungry heart's despair!
