A most entertaining show, a ' Phantasma goria,' was given at Mossman's Bay last night, consisting of lantern views, astronomical scenes, and different parts of the world, the witnessing of which was delightful to those who knew the places, and very interesting for the school chil dren. Among the slides were some very comical ones, chief among which were ghosts that waltzed round the walls of the hall in Tarn o' Shanter style, and among the audience in a way calcula ted to inspire nightmare. The music organ at the door was unfortunate in its selections, and like Mark Twain's religious panorama artist played jigs at the most inopportune moments. The Punch and Judy show was inimitably funny in every detail, the black'- and red exterior was quaint and pretty, and the actors on the mimic stage did their parts very well. The ghost of Judy was terrible in its reality. Mr. Dewnes re peats his entertainment at the Watersleigh Hall, Neutral Bay, to-day. It is an entirely original one. W.
