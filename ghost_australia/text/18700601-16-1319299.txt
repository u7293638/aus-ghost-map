RAILWAY EXTENSION AND WOODEN TRAMWAYS. THE following communication on the above subject appeared in the Gympie Times, of May 25 :— The metropolitan press has been considerably occupied by this subject lately and the correspondents thereof appear to have been going in pretty strong for wooden tramways , permit me therefore to introduce them in the columns of the Gympie Times. I do not intend to advocate the system which has been called by its opponents "costly and extravagant," neither do I propose to raise my lance in favor of the one objected to by some as "cheap and nasty." I propose merely to offer a few remarks which may, I hope, tend- however little-towards confirming that old saying, "the middle courso is best," an axiom, by the way generally lost sight of by thosw who possess a favoeite hobby, and canter him out before the people.

For still greater distances we lay our light trams very often wooden ones, put trucks upon the road, and the effcctive power of the horse is increased upon easy gradients. Still greater is the distance, then the iron rail is laid and the noblo iron horse (which a beneficient Piovidence put into the mind of man to invent to conquer distunce) snorts off with his load. lho fullucy of hoiso traction railroads foi anything but exceptional cases haying long ago been cleaily pioved, it is not likely that a civil engineer of any standing will advoiuto thom ns a general system of internal communication to supcisedo stcim power Verily ' would tho shades of Locko and Ste- phenson, and n host of othei ghosts of talontcd and gifted men, who havo giaocd the piofession so despised in Queensland, uso un from their gi aves at tho invocation of tile unset ub'o qutidiupods doomed in tho latter end of the nineteenth contuiy to toil and sti ugglo aloug u tiamroud six bundi od miles in extent If wo mo to glow coin lot it b«, to fied mon Tho steam hoiso cats httlo, and when ho is ldlo ho cats nothing His longovity is extiomo lo conclude, lot mo add that all I confond for is that nunn linos should bo looomofive inilwuys, constitilted as chciply us 13 consistent with safoty and economy lhon oxpenso dopiuds on the fiatuies ot tho lountry they tiavorso, and cannot bo guided by a lough estnnato un assisted by actual examination and survoy lo est tilinto tho slccpoi«, rails mid i oiling stock, ivithout any ditu to fix tho probable cost of tho necessary biid0cs mid oxcaiitions 19 hko calculating the cost of tho saddle and bndlo without taking account of the hoiso Olio of tho main items 111 tho expense of AUB Iralmn lailway mai ing is to kocp youl road abovo flood lovel Heio, whole time is up puieutlyno object, tho cngmeoi would bo ablo to keep his lmo on the nutuial suifuco at n gteat saving of oxponso, but of eourso at the nsk ot tho tialho being stopped sovcial months 111 a yeal Your 1 ranch systems of communication may lo woodon trains, tuinpiko roads, Aiucricun plank tunks, WHO suspended buskets 01 oven pack horses, according to tho capabilities of tho couutry and the tasto and fanoy of its lnhabi touts, but without n decent trunk tho now brunches will sein eily bein fruit Lot us oven toko nntuie for oin gindi, lomombei thut tho stun of tho treo is moio powciful thnu its biunche3 lho Muiy Eivci is of ti hugel cm ry tug capacity than Gympio Oicok lho veins and ai tel les of the human body 111010 strongly constiui ted than its insignificant blood vessels , and all this for tho simple reason tint nut ino never solids a boy on a m UI'B orrnnd .
