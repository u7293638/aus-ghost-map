UP IN A BALLOON. (See Cartoon). I've a word to say about a balloon Which went up quick but fell very soon ; 'Twas a clumsy bag, and it was known As the " Martin-Parkes Bubble " air-blown ! It was made of newspapers and filled Witn gas trom Jen Hagar s jaw aistiuea ; The car was with orange-peel built up almost, The escape valve worked by the Kiama Ghost ! What a rum balloon, boys, what a queer balloon ; Freighted with a lot of stars guided by a coon, What a rum balloon, boys, what a queer balloon ! It went up very quickly, but it came down precious soon. Up they went at a deuce of a rate, Jack Lucas was there as a sort of make weight ! And J. Bowie Wilson, who really can't tell Why the boys call alter him " Oh, Water Sw< i! 1 Still up they went Parkes, Martin, and a!!, And David Buchanan trying to bawl, Defiances fierce of papist and priest, Which nobody noticed up there in the least ! What a rum balloon, boys, &c.; Alas ! they went up a little too fast, The " pace was really too rapid to last ; Still slower they rose, still more and more slow, They had to chuck out Jeff Eagar ; but though This gave them a rise, they didn't rise far, So Parkes threw Jack Lucas out of the car ; Buchanan, too, fell, but King Death failed to pot him, For he grabbed at the car, and hung on to the bottom. What a rum balloon, boys, &<. The balloon goes up with a sudden whirl, And obscurity's clouds around it do curl : And the last that is seen of the queer aeronauts â€” Martin and Parkes, those funny " old sports,'.' In the car they are having a wrestling bout, Each trying to pitch the other one out ; And whichever succeeds in that treacherous game, Both will come down at last with a crash all the same ! What a rum balloon, boys, &c.; "Oh, what a swell !" Haw, haw, haw !
