The suiitll increase in tbe amount of land under cultivation inlST-3, as com pared with 1872, notwithstanding the large amount of selection which had taken place during both those years, has been frequently commented upon. In a letter which appeared in this journal, from the pen of Mr. J. B. Patterson, M.P., 'it was shown that, although 7S1,G00 acres were selected during 1S73, the increase in cultiva tion only amounted to 1903 acres : and from these facts the writer deduced a theory that the present I.and Act is working badly, and tliut the statement made in the Governor's speech when Parliament was prorogued, " that settle- " ment upon our public lands progresses " satisfactorily," was not borne out by facts. That the increase of cultivation in lS73_bore a verysmall proportion to the area of lanii selected was undoubtedly true, but a more thorough examination of the agricultural 'statistics, of 1874 tlmn the other avoca'.ions of Mr. Pat terson permitted him to make would have shown him that it was neither the provisions nor tbe administration of the existing Land Act which was to bl.ime. The truth is that during the greater portion of 1872 and 1873 a large and continuous emigration was taking place from the older settled dis tricts near the sea const and in the neighborhood of the goldfields to the northern portion of the colony ; tenant fanners were abandoning their liobl- ings, selectors under the Land Acts of 1SG2 and 18G5 wore surrender ing the small farms they had acquired under thore laws to the large landholders in' their neighborhood, and were flocking to localities where they could combine agriculture with pastoral pursuits, and in which they could acquire land in sufficient quantities to enable them to run a few sheep and cattle and horses, as well as grow cereals and roots. It is impossible to take up any of tbe newspapers published in the Western district without being struck with the extent to which this move ment, which still continues, has been going on, but its full importance can scarcely be realised until a comparison is --made between the area under cultivation in the old and new districts as shown by the agricultural statistics for 1874, as compared with those for 1S71. ' Indeed, 11 perusal of the facts therein brought out would show that if it had not been for the present Land Act the area under culti vation in the colony in 1874, instead of showing a slight increase, would for the first time since the discovery of the goldfields have shown a very consi derable decrease. The following table shows the in creased cultivation in the new or northern shires, in which the greater portion of the now selections have been made 1S71. 1874. Acres. Acres.

The gradual emigration from the older to the newer districts is also shown by the large in crease of population in many townships, some of whose names are scarcely known to the majority of the inhabi tants of Melbourne. St. Arnand has increased since 1871 from 1101 persons to 3000 ; ITushworth, from 399 to 1100'; Benallap. from S30 to 2000; Echuca, from 1G49 to 2500; Horsham, from 294 'to 1000; Murcliison, from 150 to 400 ; the important townships of Donald and Charters were not in existence three years ago, and there are now many flourishing villages in portions of the "Wiminera in places which three years ago were mere pas toral solitudes. The agricultural statistics collected in March of last year had reference to the cultivation of the year 1873, most of which was upon land selected in 1S72. That year was, however, one during which the popu lation was extremely unsettled, and wc shall expect to find from the statistics which will be pub lished in a few days a very large in crease in the area of land under crop. The reports which reach us as to the extent to which the class of persons who are uow selecting carry out the improvement clauses of the Land Act is most gratifying. An inspection of 'the holdings of 2700 persons, who have within the last ten months taken up 41G,G30 acres, shows that they have already effected improve ments to the extent of £200,718, and i that the residence clause is substantially complied with by 2057 out of the 2700 I selectors. | it may be said that the same process of selling the land to squatters and migrating to other parts of Victoria or Biverina, which lias already taken place in the case of land selected under previous land acts to so large an ex tent, will be repeated. But there are many reasons which militate against the probability of such a course being adopted. The selectors in the Western district, and in tbe neighborhood of the goldfields and the coast towns, were hemmed in ou every side by tbe properties of large und wealthy land- j -holders. The soil was of good quality; I the selections wore small, and the large capitalist was prepared to pay a tempt ing price in order to round olf his pro perty, and to be able to enclose it in a ring fence. There is not likely to be any such temptations in the new dis tricts, for there are no largo land owners there, and the grazing rights of the squatters have in nearly every in stance been entirely extinguished. Few persons will go into a now neighbor hood, in which they have 110 interest, in order to acquire a landed property, although it is well known that a land owner will pay a large sum to get rid of a " cockatoo " who stands between the wind and his nobility. Not the least satisfactory portion of the working of tho Land Act is that the number of stock in the colony is steadily increasing. In 1871 there were connected with stations 183, 48S large and G,193,4 4G small cattle ; con- mctail with farms, 797, GG4 large and 3,98(1,382 small cnttlp. In 1874 there were connected witli stations, 1G1.230 large and 9,930,260 small cattle ; connected with farms, 722,533 large and 5,553, 15G small cattle. Bring ing these figures into their equi valent in sheep, there were, in 1871, 7,3SG,G4G on stations, and 9,41G,GGG on farms ; and in 1S74, 7,099,270on stations, and 11,488,144 on farms. While the Crown lands, notwithstand ing their diminished extent, have kept as nearly ns possible the same number 'of stock, those on the farms have in creased by over two millions of sheep, an enormous accession to the wealth of Victoria. The results brought out by these figures show that the present Land Act — it would perhaps be wise to say nothing about its predecessors — is working well and satisfactorily. We shall look with much interest to the agricultural statistics for the present year. The Rev. Anketell Henderson must have heard in his younger days the once famous ditty, Jeannette and Jeanot. In that song the young lady, lamenting the harsh conscrip- tiou which was about to tear her lover from her arms, expresses a wish that she were either Queen of France, or, what was much better still in the eyes of a French Catholic girl of the period, the Pope of Rome, for then she could have her own sweet will. There would be neither fighting men abroad, nor weeping maids at home. But as poor Jeannette was neither the one potentate nor the other, the world went along as it has pretty well done since the era of Joshua. As with the weeping French peasant girl, so with the reverend gentleman in Collins-street, whose indignation at some of the young men composing his congregation having the audacity, not only to think, but also to speak for themselves, would be ludi crous if it were not lamentable. In stead of keeping what it may be fairly presumed was the flower of his flock together, he has scattered them abroad with a vengeance. Freethought being tabooed by the pastor, the rebellious sheep, who had the audacity to cast aside musty catechisms and threadbare dogmas, and try to keep pace with the great tide of progress now sweeping round the civilised world, have broken up an association which promised the fairest fruit, Remonstrance was tried more than once, but in vain ; so in sheer self-defence the gallant corps dis banded, and handed over their library nud some £30 in money to the Young Men's Christian Association, a society which is neither presided over by a would-be hierarch nor trammelled as to discussion by superstition, whether ancient or modern. We briefly referred in Tuesday's Age to the rupture between tbe Collins- street' Independent Church Mutual Improvement Association and its pre sident, the Kev. A. M. Henderson. But to show the gross misuse of an as sumed power to bind and loose ou the part of the perpetual chairman, it may beaswell to give a resmm of the circum stances which have led to what will he variously estimated as a scandal to the Independent congregation, and a happy emancipation from spiritual tyranuy. The association came into being in 186S, with Mr. Henderson as presi dent, and with a simple code of ruleB, much the same as those of otherdebating societies. In other words, the mutual improvers discussed theological and so cial questions in a spirit of enndor, and with tolerable unreserve. Such a vital stab to bigotry and dogmatism was unendurable to the great " I am" of the association, who accordingly re quired two coercive regulations, the one that no programme be printed, the other that no book be purchased with out the approbation of the president. This first instalment of chains and slavery was submitted to at tbe time, as ,Mr. Henderson could not con veniently be bearded. The association was still young, and had scarcely felt its feet. Grown older and wiser, it kicked in September last at the arbi trary dictum of the president, that an essay on "Pulpit or Fress" was false in statement and vicious in spirit, and that its author should immediately withdraw from a society which his presence contaminated. The writer, not unnaturally, declined to be dealt with in such a summary fashion, whereupon the persecuting president, on a motion of his own, requesting the offending member to resign his librariauship, being lost, ceased to announce in church the meetings of the association, ns liad been the custom heretofore. His stated reason was that, however sin cerely the writer of the essay, " filled " with gross and unfounded slanders " against Christian ministers and " churches," might believe in what he wrote, lie (the president) would never announce another meeting until he was assured of a permanent law that would enable him to at ouce stop such scanda lous discussions. This Torquemada step was very properly and plitckily resented by the association, and although a majo rity of the members disagreed entirely withthevieivsput forward by the essay ist, they refused to pass the law. 'I lie president in a liuft' declared he would have no more to do with the associa tion, and would attend no more meetings; but, with a singular desire to keep tbe semblance, if not tbe reality of power, he would not give up tbe presidency. Now comes the crowning piece of what, in any other but a clergyman, would be characterised domineering insolence. He deliberately put his pen through the name of the author of . another essay, entitled Liberty," which was on the list of subjects for the en.- uing quarter. This programme was printed, as altered by the president, who then betook himself to New Zealand. The association, instead of going into open revolt, waited for Mr. Henderson's return, when they respectfully asked him to reconsider his decision on the "Liberty" question. 'Ihe president had not even the cour tesy to reply ; but, having sulked in his tent like a Pagan Achil les, lie. only broke silence when tbo obnoxious essay was again placed in tbo programme, and then declared his determination to consent to no programme of the association, and to listen to none of its requests, until the permanent law above referred to was pnsscd. This last straw broke the long-suffering camol's back, and but little time elapsed ere it gave up the ghost, as related in the early part of this article. 1 1 is only necessary to add that we highly approve of the bold and judi cious step taken by the association, and hope that should this wrong-headed and obstinate opponent of freethought and freethinking, this monarch with out a people, this schoolmaster without a scholar, succeed in getting together a second lot of young mutual improvers, he will find that they are no more willing than their predecessors to submit to the tyranny and insolence of a gentleman who, though he styles himself an Independent minister, appears to have all the instincts of an Inquisitor-General. it is fortunatei for the people who do not attend his place of worship, and do not obey his behests, that tbe power of Mr. Hen- DERSojt is in an inverse ratio to his will to persecute and domineer.
