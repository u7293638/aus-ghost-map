The answer came faintly,"" 'Tis mine to perform To-day at Kapunda a right pleasant task." Soon he rode up the street of the half-asleep town, Fetching folks from their stores with hiK clatter and din, Then checked his. fleet charger, and lightly leaped down On the flags in the front of the principal i -m. Out hastened the barman, out hurried mine host,' " What tidings! what tidings, good Sir, dost thou bring'{ Hath-an enemy's cruiser arrived off- the coast, Prepared shot and shell 'mongst the shipping to fling ?' " No tidings of war do I bring," said the Knight, Whom the throng standing round . as " Sir Varley" addressed; - "On a mission of peace have I come with delight, Its nature methinks should be easily guessed. " Tis mine a high honour to-day to confer On one of your townsmen unnoted by fanie : From obscurity lifted, he'll soon make a stir When the letters J.P. are tacked oh to hii. name.

Ou. the oiincr • and what a puzzle is the " Dickey Fan," which is said to be useful in chaffing. According to old Addison's Spectator_a i;<ciy's fan-was often used actively in what we nioderiicts call chaffing. Is it possible i hat a Dickey Fan is the same instrument adapted to the use of a ball-room beau instead of a ball-room, belle? I have beard'too of an artificial ghost, constructed of a pumpkin, a candle, and ti si;pet, being used for the purpose of cl.ailing, but tliis is called a Fan-Tom. -A<.ain, what can a " Post-hole Digger" be l A post-coal digger I could understand-to mean a patent digger warranted to get- an least gold enough to post the coal, i.e., to pay expenses; but surely a post-hole dieter can only bj a contrivance for .nefariously exiru-cting letters through the usual Post-Ciijce slit. Mr. Cotton's typesetting niacliine is no doubt allied with the improved " Col toil Press," bxit whether«ucii an or^ni would have much of a circulation > in South Australia is perhaps open tod oubt. The same doubt applies to the Mitring- ' jMachine, which would no doubt be useful ilt a country more addicted to bishops. As for the new " Tiie-and-Axle Upsetter" ; I would" back half a dozen stumps on the ii'Oad past, my place to beat it' in efficacy any dark night you like to try; and unless ;the "Patent Baker" is warranted to ! deliver hot rolls every morning and never • send in his bill I would just as soon put up ; with the local article. Then how could Mi-. Davenport suppose we wanted any more " Felloe-borers V' Let him look at our Parliament. Are there not members there whose power of boring a fellor must equal anything America can supply ? The same consideration should have led him to reject the " Oscillating Pumps." Surely we have feeble-minded waverei-s enough, ready to shout for a leader one week and to hound him down tlie next, going from side to side in short as caprice or cajolery may work them; Of all his importations probably the new " Stump-extractor" will be the most appreciated. Few people can wholly eschew toothache, and the fame of the Americans for painless dentistry is so great that their latest contrivances must be welcome. This instrument, approriately called "the Little Giant," will it seems pull a stump up by the roots without the least pain or difficulty, and will overcome the resistance even of the strongest gums. If in addition to .this boon for the public Mr, Davenport could also have imported for Parliamentary purposes" a Patent Debater, warranted to speak nothing but sense and never to go for more than ten minutes at a time, he would have filled the measure of our gratitude to overrunning, and might have been measured for his statue any day he pleaied.
