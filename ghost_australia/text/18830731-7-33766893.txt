REV. J. NICHOLSON ON THE SALVATION ARMY. Pursuant to announcement the Rev. J. "Nicholson delivered a sermon in the Gawler Wesleyan Church on Sunday evening, July 20, on "The Salvation Army, its place and power," batir^ hi: remarks on 1 Corinthians, xiL, 4 to (i. "Wow, there are diversi ties of gifts, but the same Spirit And there arc diifcrtuccs of administrations but the stn.c Lord. And there arc diversities of operations, but it is the eaine God which Horkctli all in all/ In his opecin? remarks Le thGwcd that God had ever in the time of tetd raiztd upqualili<>d agents co do his work, as in the luue of Judge*—^ehtniiah; and Paul chosen as the apostle to the Gentile?. I-aUr in the history fcf the wcrld Luther, the Puritan Fathers, and Wesley and Wiiittield were all tired with apostolic seaU At the present day each section of the church was doicg the work for which it was specially fitted. He ? ?it on to speak of the various gifts so din~er:nt even among the apostles, and yet it wan the tame spirit workinc through all, axd isid they were now bUct with the advent of a simple-minded unlettered people who v.ere tillca with the spirit of God, and scores ho btlicvcd had been and hundreds he trusted would be saved by their means. The apostle pointed out that no one member was independent of the body, and each bad its special work, and he wished to impress this upon them as underlying the chapter and text for. the purpose of illustrating that the Salvation Army had a place. The Elace that army occupied was among the ipttd mauta, those who were openly im moral and irreligious. In every large town there were a great number of such people, and mapy asked " Why docs such a lapsed mass exist?*' and blamed the churches. He did not think the churches were to blame primarily, but chittly the fallen people themselves. They knew of the light, and would not come to it. There were other matters which helped to produce these social and political change*—short hours of labor, the multiplied temptations to evil, ie, that were characteristic of the present day. He did cot altogether exonerate the churches; there were not sufficient workers among them. The reason of the success of the army he attributed to their concentration on one object, the salvation of sinners of the lapsed class. Then their lively methods of working, which he did not altogether endorse; their hymns, and their sensa tional postern, their plain speaking, and sometimes broad humor tended to arrest the class they were seeking. He thought, too, that the class- feeling—the clanniahness if he might to call it—between the teachers and the masses had something to do with the succcsc. They came from the masses and had tasted of the bitterness of sin, and so as living examples could speak so as to be understood by sinners. The secret of the power of the c fticcrs of the army was that they were full of the Holy Ghost. It was not by the power of in tellect, or earthly power, or agency that peni tents were made, but by the Spirit of that God who was making the weak things of the earth to confound the mighty. He thought the churches might learn a leeson. It was work wrought by the Spirit of God, and as they recognised that truth let them do their work depending upon that spirit. He then ex plained the various ways through which that Spirit worked, and prayed that God would give to all the churches the same power. He believed it was the duty of the churches to recognise this new agency, and co-operate with it as far as opportunity served. Each had need of the other, and each had its special work. Members of Christian churches should attend first to the work in connection with their own churches, other wise the body of Christ would languish; then when opportunity offered what remaining strength they had they might devote to those God-honoring servants. He hoped he should not be misunderstood, and that God would forbid* the slightest spark of jealousy creep ing in so long as souk were being saved. It was the duty of the church to copy the excellencies of the Salvation Army workers: their earnestness and simple faith Bbould win admiration, while their extra vagantsensationalisinii should beguarded against, as well also as that ceneorious criticism which was indulged in by some of the members of the army against the churches, which arose, he thought, from a want of knowledge. He concluded by an earnest, appeal to the members of the church to be' true to their work and true to their master.
