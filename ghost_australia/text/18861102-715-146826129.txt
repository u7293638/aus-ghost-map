Into the straight Sheet Anchor deemed t<> be leading, but only for a brief, period, as Isonomy aoon disposed of him; when he got alongside, and the son of Winterlake was enjoying a dear lead and apparently easy victory till Botvlka came with a rush on the inside and challenged, him, when a grand set-to took place, re sulting in what most people thought was a narrow win for Isonomy, but the judge declared it to be a dead beat.

Esperance and Mistletoe were troublesome before the flag felL Hortense was the quickest to show in front, with Bedouin, Huntingtower and Perhaps having a slight lead of the rest of the line. Loyalist and Esperance were also going well, but Mistletoe andJebu site were the last to get off. Esperance distinguished herself by getting into a commanding position passing the. aahd track, and then destroying Lord Carring ton's hopes by running away to the left towards the abattoirs. BedpUin showed a bold front, and Hortense and Perhaps were' well placed, till the latter filly was shaken up, when she refused to respond, and a second or two were lost while she was got going again. At the distance Hortense and Bedouin were at the head of affairs, with Huntingtower, Oceania, Law and Aberdeen in near attendance. Hor tense struggled gamely oh, and notwith standing her extra weight and the strength of the wind she managed to beat her field, and Win by a length from Huntingtower, who came up strongly in the last few strides and beat Bedouin by half a length for second place.

Ches ham rushed clear past him and gained a strong load, but Trident was interfered with by Volcano, who swerved outwards from the fence. -. Fortunately the favor its got clear, and went in pursuit of Chesham, who had turned into the straight a clear Bixlengthsaheadofthe favorite. Kingfish then passed Maddelina, and was in turn passed by Aglaosi.but all the * interest in the other animus -'was lost by every eye being centred on Chesbain and' the favorite.

" Time, lm. 57js ./ '...■ I A meeting of pjrsons desirous.pf ereql j ing a mill at.Goroke.,. was", held at . the ' Mechanics'^ Hall on. Saturfay iiight". "A Urge number of farmers! ty>m: tbe imtue diate district attended, - j^W^,o.Wing to ..the-. ' shortness of the notice and^fche inclement state of the.weather, representafires from ; Karnak, Gymljowen and Booroopki were . couspicaous by their absence. Mr. Thome .' ■ was elected to the chair, and on the iuo^T jtionof Mr,. Fox, secbudedby Mr,Cbmson 1 Mr. E. dclbert was appointed secretary pro. tam. The matter was then discuBsed ~ in a conversational manner, and .by all . who took part in the dischssioh it. was freely' admitted that a thill was urgently required in the district, and that, a. Com pany could easily be formed to carry out the undertaking. . Mr. Oliver suggested th&t; a conxpahy should he formed of'2000" shares at £1 each, arid stated that behad offers of seyeral plants verv cheap, fie said that-there was no reason why a mill should not pay, as Goroke is the centre of a very iaige wheat, growing district, and the nearest mill on one .side is at Natimuk, a distance of some 30 miles, and on the other side'there is none nearer than Narracoorte—sonte SO milea distant, and he eatimated that in this district alone, some two or three hundred tons of flour are annually consumed. "Mr. Oliver farther stated that he was quite willing to undertake the management of the mill, should one be erected there, and so con* fident was he^of socceia, that he was pre pared to guarantee, to shareholders a dividend of Id per cent, at the end of the first year.and if it proved a failure be would pay the dividend oat of his salary. He remarked that . when he first started a mill at Nhill that place was not then nearly as large as Goroke; but ' when the mill was erected they sooq had a post and telegraph office - then a bankydn'da mechanical, etc., and there wjariao* tieasdn to doubt but that& • mill, if erected, would do ths same for • Goroke;; as it is " the centra of% much 1 larger farming district than Nhill- was in those days." In conclusion, he hoped that - the faVmers in iall parts of the eiirround ing'district would fake the matter op ib a proper spirit. Mr. Fox said that if a mill was -erected it would have the effect of increasing the value of land there, 10a.; or 15s. per rere, and then moved. " That ~ a company, 'to be called'1 the WeBt Wim roera Milling Company''be formed, of 2,000 shares at Ll each." - This was secon ded by Mr. M. Sheean, and carried. Applications for shares were then re ceived, and 750 shares were subscribed for in the room. • Mr. A. J.Fox next, moved, " That Messrs. J. J. Callaghan T. Thorne, ;T. Jelbart, M. Sheean, and the mover be appointed a committee to interview the farmers round Kamnlr, Gymbowen, and Booroopki, and to make the preliminary arrangements." Mr. J. Compson seconded the motion, which was carried. It was then decided that the next meeting be held in the Mechanics' Hall on Monday at 7 o'clock p.m., after v^hich a vote of thanks was passed to the chairman and to Mr. Oliver.—" Horsham Times." * ' ' A Lovslt Chapmt.—A late fashion report ■ays -" Nothing canbe prettier thanachaplet of hopvinea in blossom.-' A recent medical review says" Nothing csn be a better re novator of the health than AmericanHop Bitten.
