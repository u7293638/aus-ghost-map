PICTURESQUE VICTORIA. By TELEMACHUS. MANSFIELD. I don't like that monument even in the daylight. We sit on the shady side of the balcony, and look away over the grassy flats to the dull red bastion of the Battery, and try to conjure up peaceful visions of a prosper- ous future—of a time when dozens of folks shall, like our friend Captain Cotter there, discover that such a village as this, with quiet possession of a great garden and a little farm, affords about as much happiness as a man who proposes to roll quietly with the world can hope to know. The captain sailed the Spanish main, and the Chinese main, and every other main vor more than a quarter of a century, and when he thought the time to cast anchor had come let go and made fast down there on the hill-side. He has a big shrubbery all about his house, and orchard and flower-garden, with two green paddocks behind. He comes into town to smoke his pipe on Saturnday, and to sit like a decent man in church on Sunday. And what is better in the way of rest and quietness? The climate is delightful here. It is out-door weather all the year round . Health goes a begging, and when that is the case it is not often that reasonable happiness is lacking. The captain's example is well worth quoting, and following too, by those whose circumstances permit such a course. Many an Anglo-Indian and Anglo-Chinaman who takes his little pile home, and lives a few miserable years eating colocynth and calomel, and bandaged up in flannels like a broken leg in splints, could find a healthy, cheery, sunny evening to his life in some of our high inland villages, and what an adjunct to a big, hot, dreary back block station would a farm and cottage be in just such a locality as this. The cottages and the farms will surely come. We can imagine them now as they must some day be, dotting all these low hills, clothing all these fair hollows, scores, hundreds of them, why not? Just as one begins to think of all the beauty of the coming time that monument gets into the corner of the picture, and then everything chances, all the black part returns. One sees the pack horses, with their ghastly burdens, led down the mountain spur, then the white faced crowd, savage but scared, about the morgue of the little hospital, and the old fighting bishop, who walked across the mountains, and would have led a party to have hunted the outlaws out at need, bare headed and eloquent by the open graves. One does not want such fancies on a sunny morning, but they will always come it folk are compelled to live face to face with a churchyard trophy. Mr. MacMillan, our charioteer, chases them away this morning, coming round with intent to drive us to the happily named locality of Merryjig, but my compagnon de voyage, Mr. Davidson, will stay at home and improve his holiday by inspecting the various plans which have been sent in tor supplying the township with water. They want water here badly, and if 10 million gallons a day could be drawn from the Delatite, and thrown into the old deep creek which winds a dreary channel about the town, a marvellous treat work would certainly be done for the district. Something in that direction is contemplated, and some proportion of one million gallons per day will shortly be brought in for the townships use. And more will follow. But as we drive along, the country does not seem to me to be as a whole particularly well suited to irrigation At least it does not, as some of the lands we know, cry aloud for irrigation The gross is green in the lanes and tall in the paddocks. Great Queensland bred bullocks, rolling fat, camp under every green trees shade, but the green trees are not frequent. The redgum has died out here, and without any assault of the ringer's axe. Something came over them years ago, but as to the nature of that something it is difficult to get any exact information. Mr. Macmillan remembers them when they were all green and fresh, and broaches the novel theory that the possums killed them. When the blacks cleared out, an exodus which followed a murder somewhere out at the back of the Battery, the possums increased wonderfully, and keeping always to the redgums, cropped them so closely that they died. It seems incredible, but still it may have been. Have we not seen millions of acres of saltbush eaten right out of existence by sheep, and do not the rabbits threaten to make the whole of the interior the desert we once imagined it. But the possums seem now to have perished like the gums, and only the good, useful growth of the earth a carpet to remain, a splendid sole of grass. We find that on every side now, and do not require to be told that this hue always been a noted fattening country. A few miles out from town we encounter Mr Macartney, a son of the venerable old dean of our city. Mr Macartney is white almost as his father, but otherwise does not present many points of external resemblance. The management of a couple of cattle stations, and the experience of 35 years' work of that sort, but the Australian stamp very plainly on any man Mr Macartney usually does the honours of the district and pilots visitors about, but to his reuret and ours matters of finance and transfer are oc- cupying all his time now, he can but say welcome and good bye, and rattle away fast as horse's legs will carry him. And we also journey on, mixing up the impressions of the present with memories of the past and prospects of the tuture. Pushing along a moderate road we get ten miles from the town and ten miles nearer to Mount Buller. Mount Buller, it will be noted, occurs often 111 all talk about Mansfield. Mount Buller is, indeed, in the way of scenery the greater glory, as Mount Battery is the less. But we are not going to make the ascent to day, that requrea a nights camp at the base and then a long climb, with a good deal ot tomahan k work ill the way ot clearing and some breakneck climb ing over huge musses of toppled rock. 1 rotn the summit a marvellous great view may be gained, and about the summit und the farther slopes it is said some rare mountain Howers mid beautiful lichens and rnoasta may be guthered, but if we require au excuse for not making the nsceut, this ia not tho season for wild dowers and we ure not aure but it will ram to morrow Moreover, no man goes to the top ol a mountain to pit 1 nt its picture It is necessary to stand a lair distance away and look up Looking itlso is easier than climbing We look now anti Bee a. ridge and peak there which suggest the ak) hues of New Zealand hills, nr on a larger scale the Cathedral Rungo bijomi Maoaville It is one ot the hq,b mountains ot Australia, ViOOtt. as measured I mm the sea les el, und showing out with remarkable boldness un unbroken face of .1000ft- at the least.

No companion ship, no comfort, only hope of something better by and by And when in five or ten years things have improved a bit, and rents are paid up and a house built« and a family fairly settled perhaps, how frequently does the drought come and sweep ever) thing away with its horrid besom of destruction The Victorian freeholder, did he but realise all the facts, would have nothing but pity for his brethren up north. The present condition of the land revenues of New South Wales should instruct him that there are no fortunes making there. Round about by grassy knolls and rich green flats we drive the whole afternoon, returning by Maindample park as pleasant and well ordered a little estate as one could find in Victoria. The young proprietor has finished a beautiful little house on his fairest hill and Nature has made for him a park of a thousand acres immediately around. He took across a happy bride the daughter of our good friend, Mr Kitchen, of Mansfield, a couple of weeks ago, and settled down to as good, prosperous, useful a life as could fall to the lot of any young couple in any country of the world. On the morrow we were to be led out to a wilder country M e bad seen the old settle- ment about the town, and desired to get a look at the new land on the mountains Also it was a natural, though somewhtt morbid, desire to 1.0 right out to that noto nous Kelly camp, which in the old days radiated horror and terror ov er all the n_n.h bouring country It would be a long, rougb ride, we were told, but for that ne wera now well seasoned, and set out, therefore, light hearted enough, for the Wombat Hanges, which we could see hazy and blue in the distance 1 oat, good travelling for the first hour along well made roads, and through the Ratler) piddock., then across the Broken River, mid up along long spur of the hills.

'1 hen by lunch time we got it down to six, and by _ m the etternoon it was three, but at - o clock again it was five, and wo had been riding hard, and, as we imagined, right tor it all the time. But a little before 4 one of our party had tucked up tv sm&li; boy bebind him to act as pilot, and we were riding through tolerably thick scrub to the creek and "the camp." -Not exactly to the camp, however, but that spot which had more interest tor us, the scene of the police murders It waa soon reached Hie scrub opened, a little grassy valley appeared, with one dead tree still standing, mid four white trunks lung at right angles to each other on the (.round A very little stream ot water comes out of a dark belt ot Bcrub, and creeps down silently through the centre ot the green The settlers' house on the hill is Bhut out by the trees, anti there is no sign of humun habitation around Here, ten years ago, those four policemen pitched their camp 'Ihey were bunting the outlaws They knew that in the creek there had been men working for gold , they imagined the felons sought were near b) They were not aware ot any humun habitation within many miles, mid certain 1) did not dream ot that hut, with the loopholed iron door, only a couple of miles away, where the desperate men kept watch and plotted their murders und raids Here, amongst these logs, they lay down at night and heard the dingoes howling and the wild cattle bellowing in their camp, and around them here on the next morning that net was spread from which only one escaped, and truly by "the skin of his teeth ' We can see the notches in the tree whence the bullets were hacked We can imagine, easily enough, the cook busy with bis bill) at the Ure, the ewart torm oi the master rufhati emerging trom the se ubbut a pistol shot awa), the brutal chal- lenge, the armed and valiant stand of the sergeant and bia men, the desperate flight of the one who escapad, and then the horror which thrilled Victoria, and the terror which possessed the sparse and scattered popu lut ion of the hills.
