Yes, and spirits. Hypl Good spirits, over-proof spirits, i without any adulteration and full J measure. We don't dislike I ghosts ; far from it ; in fact, there are some ghosts we long to behold, and shall not rest contented until we can do;so. We -would like to see the ghost of o:# mother-in-law, but, worse luck, she or.y lets us see her spirit; we Avould like tosee the ghost of a chance for us to tip the Avinner of the Champion race. We want to vieAV the ghost of a summer poet, and thus be certain that they can and do die. We would like to see the ghost of the gas-bill collector, and we really fancy this is probable, for lie is so good that the angels must loug for his company. Good at figures, Ave mean. All householders will understand what Ave mean. We would like to see the ghost of a joke in certain of our comic contemporaries, but we are afraid Ave will never see much beyond shadows and myths. But we have no luck ; we have haunted cemeteries and ruins of houses, dark avenues, and gloomy walks, but in vain ; no ghost appears. Con stables have nearly run us in for suspected burglary, and cooks have effusively kissed and hugged us in mistake for 'Arry. But the genuine ghost, the being (?) Avho frightens children and Avomen, and mys tifies men, has not yet seen reason to in troduce himself to us. We shall not de spair, however, until, at least, the ghost season is over, but if by that time he has not shown himself, we will give up the ghost. But if Ave do see him, so vindic tive have we become through enforced waiting, that on his appearance we shall ghostraight and inform the nearest con stable and leave the rest to justice.
