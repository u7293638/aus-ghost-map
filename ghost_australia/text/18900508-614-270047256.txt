The woman who acted as his housekeeper, and whom X bave referred to as of singular appearance,' is dark and swarthy, with masses of white hair and keen black eyes, one morning came to him. “Sir,” she said, “X am aware that you were interested in that strange death the other day of a Mr. Trill.” “Only so far, Martha,” interrupted Mr. Bingham, “that I thought it rather curious— the boy should have been so affected by smoking the butt of a cigar the man threw “ That is so,” said the woman with a ghost of a smile upoH her face. “And X was also curions on that point. I happen to have scon some strange things in my life, sir, and I am convinced that the cigar was poisoned.

Seeing my dark skin and foreign looks, she spoke to me. She was glad when she learned I spoke Spanish, 'and that I was indeed a native of Spain. She asked me to visit her—she lives at Carlton. Often, when I have leisnre, I go to see her. We have become intimate. Sir, when I heard ef that 'strange affair, I felt convinced this woman—this Parquita—bad a hand in it. I resolved to ascertain, if possible, if my suspicions were correct.” ^ “And,.the--result^’’“cried Bingham ex citedly. “ Is here,” and she placed the cigar on the table. “ I went to Parquita and told her 11 had an enemy whom I wished removed. She asked if this enemy were man or woman. I told her it was a man—my master. 1 Does 1 he smoke ?’ said she. 1 He is always smoking,’ I answered. She went to a enpboard and brought forth a small box. From this she took this cigar.” “ Iiet him smoke this, my friend,” she said, “ and he will smoke .no more^ eh I asked if she was sure, and if, therewas no dinger of discovery. “ None,” .■'he^said. -; “Best bidet. Why, I have olmfifid many. Not long ago I enabled a ricji^g|ntleman here to remove an enemy. It was funny, in the newspapers to read— Diablo! I cannot read myself—the carious things that were said. Then she laughed, and said that a boy had picked up A piece Of the cigar and that it nearly remove^ hitii also. Sir, is this not wonderful newis ?” ; . “ You will not breathe a whisper of this matter, woman,” said Bingham, “ to any “ Not a word, sir.,, It was because I know you wished to know that I have sought to ascertain for you. Master, yon huve been good to the poor convict woman, ami she would lay down her life to save you.” “ X believe you, Martha,” answered Bing ham gently, “ and thank you. What did you pay for this, woman ?” “ She would not take pay. She said she was rich—that the gentleman she spoke of had long allowed her a liberal pension. Master, it is very strange—but my part is done. I am content if. I have pleased whetf* having! “I thank yon,” was the answer. “And now please leave me alone.
