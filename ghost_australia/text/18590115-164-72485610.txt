THY WILL BE DONE. SEARCHER of Hearts !-from mine erase AU thoughts that should not be, And in its deep recesses trace My gratitude to Thee ! Hearer of Prayer !-oh guide aright Each word and deed of mine ; Life's battle teach me how to fight, And be the victory Thine. Giver of AU!-for every good In the Redeemer came : For raiment, shelter, and for food. I thank Thee in His name. Father and Son and Holy Ghost ! Thou glorious Three in One ! Thou knowest best what I need most, And let Thy will be done.
