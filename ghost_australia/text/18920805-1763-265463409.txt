MARY'S GHOST. A Pathetic Ballad. Twas in the middle of the night, »'o sleep young William tried; When Mary's ghost came stealing in, And stood at his bedside. 0 William dear ! O William dear I My rest eternal ceases; Alas ! my everlasting peace Is broken into pieces. 1 thought the last of all my cares Would end with my last minute; But though I went to my long home, I didn't stay long iu it. The body-snatchers they have come And made a snatch at me; It's very hard them kind of men Won't let a body be! You thought that I was buried deep, Quite decent like and chary. But from her grave in Mary-bone, They've come and boned your -Mary. The arm that used to take your ami Is took to Dr. Vyse; And both my legs are gone to walk The hospital at Guy's. I vowed that you should have my hand, But fate gives us denial; You'll find it there, at Dr. Bell's, In spirits and a phial. As for my feet, the little feet You used to call so pretty, There's one I know, in IScJfoid Row, The t'other's in the City. I can't tell where my head has gone, But Doctor Cai-pue cau ; As for my trunk, it's all packed up To go by Pickford's van. I wish you'd go to Mr. P. And save me such a ride; I don't half like the outside place They've took for my inside. The cock it crows—I must be gone I My William, we must part! Bnt I'll be yours in death, altho' Sir Astley has my heart. Don't go to weej) upon my grave, And think that there I be; They haven't left an atom there Of my anatomie. —THOMAS HOO'
