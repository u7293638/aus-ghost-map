THE LITEHAHY " CNOST." Some years since in England the literary' "ghost" of a well-known public man sued him for services ren- :dered in the way of preparing election : addrease.s and after-dinner orations, I and obtained a- substantial verdict. 'That sort. of thing is not entirely con- flned to the Old World, for at a public meeting held not a hundred miles from the Sydney G.P.O., three speakers de livered addrosBBS in opposition to the proposals of the present Government, or rather, to speak more accurately, three gentlemen read speeches on the obove questiin from neatly got up piles'of manuscript. All these docu ments and the prinuipal resolution pro posed were (as a curious pressman subsequently discovered) in the same handwriting, and all the paper used bore : the embossed stamp of a well- known metropolitan place of resort for country visitors. The "ghost" in this instance must iiave had a very profitable time, but the incident will serve to arouse suspicion in the minds of any future audience when a speaker appears lipon tho platform armed with voluminous notes.
