I .. VANITY FAIR. J D J. M. D. LONDON, FEB. 2. In deference to the preiaduiR demand for up to (lateness in everything, we have had the opening of Parliament, a new Parlia- mentary drama in four acts at the Criterion, a new political evening paper, and a new political hostess, all in one week Nothing could make Devonshire house, in Piccadilly, a cheerful place of entertainment It wears a settled look, as though it were expecting to be pulled down, and no amount of lights, flowers, and decorations on Tuesday night succeeded in reconciling the house the guests, and the servants the Duke s omnium gatherum represented a blend of all British ideas principles and professions No Irish Home Rulers were there, but front bench Gladstonians und L11101113ts fraternised as though they were anxious to make believe for one night that no hideous chasm divided them If possible the Duke of Devonshire, whom everybody) still calls Hartington, looked more tired than usual His duchess has joined the new and crinoline league The motto of this boil) is defence, not defiance There is nevertheless actual danger in the matter, for Parisian dressmakers are seriously) trying to introduce the crinoline in order to collect thought from the Panam v Scandal The Duchess of Montrose is another duchess enlisted in the cause and 1-' UOOmeuibersarealresd) sworn in, tlieironth binding them "not to wear crinolines even if it should become the fashion

his Sayings and doings, and the two performances come off at about the same hour every night The most interesting character in the drama is the author 'the latest successful dramatists ideas of what Parliamentary) life and procedure are really like are interesting 'The author doesn't sjinpathispivitliMr W T Stead the villain Stoacli, MP, a vulgar and cruel Radical fanatic, with a craze for social purity and the realisation of public life, is obviously intended for and Indeed, Stoach's warfare against Lord Uivehrooke, on which the plot turns, could in real life only he carried out in the press The epigrams and points delivered by the male and female politicians give alternate "days to each political party with great impartiality Hut Mr R A Jones's food second rate epigrams are only appreciated by the gallery), pit, and family) circle 'The people in the stalls and boxes don't applaud, for the play is ridiculously) improbable and the details impossible Lord Sherbrooke has p ntl 11

anything of the sort But Lord Sherbrooke doesn t know that adopts a policy of despair, resigns the leadership of the House say good bye to his party and his career, and marries Mary Moore as soon as he finds that bleach has clear proofs of his harmless Three tion with the young person, and means to use them, in defiance of the forms of the House The main incident is too obviously insignificant to found catastrophe on Mar) Moore is far too well dressed for a shopgirl at 10s a week and her board There is a very actual deputation of Radicals from the Hall s Pond to id introduced to the leader of the Government by Stouch tHis) really do look like Radicals But there are no reporters And the deputation stand, instead of sitting down And Stomach and Lord Ch\ erect a quarrel openly) before the deputation As Mr T P O'Connor observed to Wyndham One never quarrels savage!) with one's political opponents before other people, only with one s political friends Lord Clive brooks private secretary tonstartl) brings him official papers, which are not official papers at all-rather lawyers briefs and there are no despatch boxes and no blue books about the room An absurd!) feeble ' division bell rings for about half a minute and the climax of improbability is reached when the Conservative part) consisting of some twenty supers rush into the Premiers private room at the House to ii ten new him about an impossible crisis The aspect of the gentlemen of England is most laughable Genuine realised was of course unattainable in tins play the absence of it makes the whole affair ludicrous Dragging contemporary) questions and a living journalist on to the state is not in the best of taste As abroad farce of burlesque the Bauble Shop would go better Horace Sedger admires the play very much and our literary) men praise it. The part of Stomach is w ell done by (youngsters b) dne) Valentine Wyndham has rather a knack of picking up the right sort of men Miss Fanny I nson, who has not been seen in London since she played in a weakened adaptation our frightfully) white French piece called " La Doctorease, makes a good political woman of fashion A rather uncomfortable feeling that there is going to be a row which nobody wants, but everybody) will have to suffer from, damp the spirits of politicians and their belongings, and extends to Society generally A day or two ago, Earl Spencer exceedingly nervous and uncomfortable about various things, was riding in Rotten Row with Sir U K Shuttleworth neither in good spirits Suddenly Lord Spencer who is very shortsighted, said to his companion, " Just look there at those two dirt) little busy bee the sort of persecution we Home Rulers are subject to those boys are actually) shal ing their fists at us "Why said Shuttleworth, those are two of your own colleagues, Lord Rosebery and Mr. Asquith, and they are merely waving their hands to join On the night Parliament opened Mr Gladstone as UBUUI gave an official dinner in Downing street. There was a very small reception for intimate friends afterwards Mrs G hillstone borrowed Mr Armitstends Trench cook, his knives and forks and his decanters early in the morning, and Mr Armitstead, who had in tended to give a dinner himself on that night at his bachelor quarters in Cleveland row, had not choice but to move his guests to the Reform Club 'where he entertained Sir Algernon West, Sir Reginald Melb),Mrl Y Hamilton, C 15- son of the Bishop of Salisbury and an immense favounttolMr Gladstones-Horacebejmour, lad) Spencers brother, and Iltur) Gladstone the Premiers Indian son, who is carried to Stuart Kendall s daughter The Faithful Armitstead is a handsome old man, with -our features and while beard and moustache He was once in the House of Commons Ever since the small and select reception at the Prime Ministers, the Parnellite paper in Dublin has come out with large head lines, " insult to the Irish Whigs!
