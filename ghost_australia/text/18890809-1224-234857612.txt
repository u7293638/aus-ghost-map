lPOCtr?. Conscience and FiUnro Judgment. ''' '/ ' D7 OninTjEB W. BTUDBSi, ' I sat alono witU mj oonEClenoo, In aplaoo where timo had ceased, ' And wo talked ot my former living In tho land where tho ycare increased. ' . And I (olt I ehanld liavo to answer The nitenfinn St. nn( (n ma And to lace the answer and question Throughout an eternity, - Tbo ghosts of forgotten aotions Gamo floating before my. sight, And thinga that I thought wcro dead things Wen alivo with a terrible might. And tho vision of all my post lifo Woe an awful thing to face, .Alone with my oonEoienco eitting. In tbat oolomnly silent place And I thought of a far away warnings . . Of a sorrow that was to bo mine, - In a laud that then was tho future, But now la tho present time. And I thought of my former thinking Of the judgment day to be, > But eitting alone with my coaeeionoo Seemed judgment enough for mo. And I wondered if there was a future To this land boyond tho gt&vo; ; But no ono gave me an answer, - Arid no ono camo to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And tho present would never go by, For it fffiB but the thought of my paetlifo Grown into oternlty. Then I woko from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I know the far-away warning Hod a warning of yeatozdayâ€” And I pray I may not forget it In this land before the grave, Tbat I may not ery in the future . And no one oomo to eavc. And so I havo learned a lesson Whioh I ought to havo known before, And whiob, though I learned in dreaming, I bopo to forget oo more. So I ait alone with my coneeicnco, In tho plaos where the yoars increase, And I try to remember the future In the land where timo will pease. And I know of tho futuro judgment, How drcadfnl soo'cr it bo, That to sit alono with my oonsoicnoe Will be judgment enough tor me.
