Blackall's Ghost. TO THE EDITOB. SIB,-In this week's Independent I notice a great description of the ghost on tiie Blackall Barcaldine rood. My Blaekall ghost ex perience is as follows: - Four years ago, during a long drought, I noticed frequently the shadow of a man olothed in glistening whito aoross the paddock and near the house. At full moon it appeared to sway backwards and forwards, BometimeB moving a hand as if to beckon me, and then it would disappear suddenly. I acquainted all in the house of the matter, the ghost making us all feel a bit shaky, especially towards dusk, and none of us were game to interview it. One flight, however, I picked up courage enough to go over and faoo it. On approaching it it sud denly vanished (the moon went under a cloud) and when I reached the spot I was vis a vis with a tree of beautiful white cobwebs-not a ghost. Hy Blackall friends instead of' 'quick march" should " stand at ease," and perhaps like me they would " alight upon cobwebs." Yours truly, GEETA TOWNEE. Glencoe, Blackall, May 7th, 1807.
