The artioles which hare appeared in our columns on the Hawkes- bury Labour Settlements present Now South Wales's contribution towards the solution of the question of settling labour communities on tho lands. That it is an interesting question ia evidenced in the fact that in almost all these colonies at this hour simultaneous attention is turnod to it in a practical way, and thoories on tho subject of the most varied kind are now being put to the test of experience. With the objects contemplated there must be universal sympathy. There can hardly be a moro pathetic picture than that of stalwart men who are anxious for work yet unable to find it, and of homeless fami- lies which, in a land with millions of fertile acres unfilled and unoccupied, are precluded by their limited means or want of means, and by the difficulties of the oircumstances sur- rounding them, from obtaining homes for themselves in Australia. Though thero has been keen controversy on tho subject, thero is probably no one who does not sincerely wish that some safe way could be devised by which the homeless and the idle could be weddod to the land, and the only comtroversy that can exist is as to the practicability of one or another of the methods that are from time to time proposed. The picture given of the two co-opera- tive settlements on the Hawkesbury is an interesting one. It is not idyllic ; but it shows a stern determina- tion to endure hardship and to com- bat the difficulties in the way of the pioneers, and a heroic resolution on the part of hardworking mon to make homes for themselves and for those that are dear to them, The prido te rear an independent shed, And giv» the Ups they Ure unborrowed bread. These two settlements are based on rather differont lines. In the one the settlers come to the work entirely penniless, the whole of the means of sup- port-while the people are striving to make the settlement self-sustaining being supplied iu tho very limited allow a»ce provided by the Government. In the second case the settlers come with a little money in their hands, which, when expended in tho devolspmont of the settlement, will bo subsidised by an additional amount from the State. Ob- viously the scheme of the Wilberforce settlement has the botter prospect of suc- cess, the resources of the Pitt Town settlement being prnctiaally exhausted. But ans'one can see at a glance that in tho one case as in the other, and indoed in respect of all the schemes proposed for settling labour on the land, the crux of the whole thing is the question of money. In the personnel and iu the progress of both the settlements there is much to attract, and much to encourage the cause of co- operative labour settle- ments. The difficulties so often spokon of as to converting mon of difforent trades and habits of life to the pursuit of husbandly are hore mot. The carpenter between tho handles of the plough, and leaving a furrow behind him as unexcep- tionable as that of a trained ploughman, is a typo of tho rost, who have shown that, whore there is a will inspired by an earnestly-desired object in viovr, the mere difficulty of a defectivo edu- cation will not deter industrious men from wresting produce from the soil. Under the spirit of co-opora tion, too, the hints and instructions of tho experienced gardeners and farm labourers among them aro as freely availed of as they are cheerfully given, aud iu this respect these two settlements furnish a valuable object los6on on tho capacity for adaptation to circumstances whicli is so characteristically colonial. There is another promising feature in these two settlements, more particularly in that at Wilberforce, in the preservation of the principle of individual property, ovon though the settlements aro co-operativo. The possession of au allotmont-in tho Wilberforce settlement of two acros-at- tached to each cottago rotains the whole- some stimulus of individual ownership, the absonco of which must bo the most depressing nnd disintegrating element in a purely communistic systom. In such case as this each family having its own littlo piece of ground can cultivate all the home sentiments, im- proving and embellishing, supplementing its means of livelihood and its home com- forts in the spare hours of the labourers, and in the leisure of the wivos and ohildren ; and we venture to say that this feature will bo found to have exorcised a salutary influence if the&o; settlements or oithor of thom attain pormanont success. Thero seems indoed a lack of completeness in the arrangement when suoh a largo proportion of the people, being women and childron, are standing about idle while tho men aro hard at work, and something might be devised by the friends of the settlements to provide light oinploymoat for those. But if those privato allotmonts are properly utilised it is possiblo that tho women and children may become practical contributors to no small extent to tho woalth and the happi- ness of tho settlement. Thero is, indoed, much that is both pleasant and encouraging in the picture of theso hard-working and determined people who have turnod away from the bitter weary strugglo of competition with their fellow-men, and from the idleness and desti- tution that are the lot of so many in the towns, and have directed their energies to struggling with nature in the determina- tion to wrest subsistence from the soil. But in tho midst of it all wo are forced back to cansidor tho principal difficulty in connection with it-tho monetary part. If it is* admitted that-it is the duty of the State to tako from tho general taxation of the people sufficient means for settling the poor on the land, then the whole difficulty disappears. The State oould, no doubt, raise the money, and it could be exacted from the poople by the tax-gatherer. But thoro is such an obvious injustice in this that such a course cannot possibly be taken as a genoral principle. On what grounds could anyone defend the compelling of farmers who have had to work their own way up from no beginnings to give up their substance to start other farmers to engage in com- petition with themselves? Or on what o-rounds could anyone defend such State assistance to penniless agriculturists which would not be as applicable to those adventuring in mining, manu- facturing, or shopkeeping ? Can this be worked side by side with the ordinary selector, or will the enter- prise of independent farming not wither by the side of State-supported industry ? Without more assistance from tho State ono of these settlements, at least, must inevitably como to on end, unless private benevolence steps in to <. con- tinuo what the State has started. And what will be the finality to such a new departure ? Is the State- that is, the general taxpayer not only to stand sponsor for these settle- ments at their inception, but to continue to stand guarantee against flood and drought and misfortune in general, suoh as soroly try the independent farmer ? In the sphere of philanthropy tho onterpriso is deserving of every sympathy and practical help; and in a sister colony that help has been given on tho most liberal scale But the principle of dependence on tho general revenue is attended with so far-reaching dangers, that grave fears must attach to any general extension of labour settlements aa State institutions. The expressed intention of the Ministor for Works to put a ban on working men coming from the sister colonies and apply- ing for employment on our public works may be regarded as a new phase in the development of the spirit of Australian federation. If the exigencies of politics require such concessions to be made to local interests or prejudices, then those subject to such demands are to be coin iniseratod. Somo time ago a similar prin- ciple was advocated by the leader of tho Opposition, and it was generally ridi ciuud, but now the Government appears to have taken up the principle as its own, and intends to engraft it on the polioy of the country. It is pitiable that the Government of New South Wales should be now so commonly identifying itsolf with an extremely looal polioy. As ia tho pipe contract and similar things, this is a restriction for whick, if carried out, the whole colony will have to pay ; and it resembles the pipe contraot further in this, that it presents the works under- taken as relief works rather than as public works which the country requires. It is needless to say that actions such as this will very soon lead to retaliation. This seems to be the invariable outcome of uny unfriendly attitude or any restric- tive legislation on the relations of one colony toward another. Indeed, it would appear that sections of people in all the colonios are only too ready to make the most of any little lapse from brotherly feeling, and under the name of patriotism to stir thorn solves up to emulation in their selfish in- terests. Just now there is a call to arms in Victoria over the action of tho New- castle mine-owners in lowering the price of coal, whioh is stated to be dono with the object of smothering the coal industry in Victoria, and all good Victorians aro called on in the name of the country to use only the local coal, and so thwart the evil intent of Now South Wales. It is always easy enough to fan feelings of this sort ; but it must bo obvious to any ono that, as between the colonios, this spirit of retaliation can bo productive of no good results. But the shortsightedness of the course proposed in relation to the publio works of the colony appears if wo consider the case ol the working men themselves. It is presumed that it is the benefit of the working classes of the colony that is con- templated in this intended restriction. We know that mon are in the habit of moving about from one colony to another according to the fluctuations of employment, and if any restriction woro placed on such movements no one would be more injured than tho working men tliomselvos. Are thoy, then, to be penalised if they go abroad in search of employ- ment? If it is right for our own people to go abroad and look for work during a dearth of employment at home, it is as right that the workers of the sister oolo nios should havo access to Now South Wales; and we may feel pretty assured that if we lead the way in putting this disability on the »ovements of labour it will bo reciprocated at the instance of agitators in tho other colonies, on tho principle o£ keoping their own fish offal lor thoir own sea mews. Fortunately, however, the minute as drawn oa the subject by the Minister for Works is vague,- and it may be hoped that it only exists for political purposes, and may not have much forco in practice. It is only in tho event of an "undue" number of mon who had not been six months domioilod in tho country being em- ployed on any givon contract that action will bo taken. The non- residence of theso men for the specific time will require to bo provod before the invidious course can bo takon of ordering their dis- missal. Apart from tho difficulty of tracing the^ antecedents or previous residences oi~ a crowd of workmen, such a drastic proceeding as dismissal is not very likely to bo put in force, so that probably the niiuute will bo practically inoporativo. At the same time it is ono of those unfriendly things that tond to sot up barriers between the colonies, and to pro- duce tho fooling that the colonies havo separate interests as against one another. It is truo that there are inconveniences somotimos from this tendency to drift in the population of the colonies. It is not the first time that it has embarrassed looal efforts to ameliorate social conditions, and any ex- ceptional treatment of the unemployed or tho destitute has invariably a tendency to induce an influx of the same class from the other colonies, hoping to share in the benefits. But it is moro than' doubtful whether any artificial barriers erected for the purpose of stopping tho ebb and flow of population would have any effect. In the case of the works now con- templated tho drafting oil of a large number of our looal workmen will produce a vacuum that is likely to be filled by an influx from elsewhere, evon if the severe course wero maintained of refusing to outsiders a share of the public works in operation. Such is the closeness of connection between the colo- nies and the oneness of their interests that any alteration in the conditions of the labour market in ono colony is felt throughout the rest, as water always finds its lovel. The fact that large contracts for public works have practically ceased in the other colonies, and that ours is the last colony to carry such works out may be expected to lead to a considerable accession of labour in the natural order of things. Insistence on the regulation intended by the Ministor will not prevent this. But it will present tho administra- tion of government in an invidious light that will not be creditable to the colony.

DBITNKABDSP-This question is asked by tho London Hospital, and rophed to in the affirmative "Wo aro (says this organ) a nation of tea drinkers, we consume about 6$lb of tho loaf per hoad annually, whioh, when mado into a beverage, produces about 37 gallons of tea Not only are we yielding with all the weakness of the inebriate to the diseases of nerve and stomaoh whioh excessive tea-drinking brings in its train, but we ara developing that in- difference to quality which is the crowning mark of indulgence, the point of severance between the gourmand and the oonnoisseur. Tea has always boen popular in England, oven when its price was enormously high, and when a moralist condemned its consumption as a 'filthy custom,' to bo explained only by tho growing wickedness of the nations. This gentleman, Mr. Henry Savile, writing to a friend, speaks with indignation of those who " call for tea, instead of pipes and bottles after dinner, a base unworthy Indian practice, and which I must ever admire your most Christian family for not admitting." What would this old-fashioned Christian of 1678 say to our modern temperance societies and their endless tea drinking f But, indeed, it almost seems as if a new tempéranos would have to arise to lead a crusade against our favourite beverage, and re- formers should petition Parliament to increase the duty on tea. By far the largor part of tho tea we drink now is the produot of India and Ceylon. From a pound of Indian tea you can make seven and a half gallons of infusion ; from a pound of Chinese toa only five gallons. This consideration is likely to weigh with the average housokeopor, who appreciates an immediate effect ou her purse more than a remote effect ou the digestions of her household. Tho result is that nearly 75 per cent, of our tea is of Indian and Cingalese growth. These teas are, moreover, cheaper than the China leaf,. aud as they are thus doubly tempting they have attained a dangerous popularity. We drink moro toa than our parents ; we take it oftensr, stronger, and of ooarser quality. The results are loss obvious than those of alcoholic intoxication, but not less serious ; and, in truth, the time may be not far distant when the earnest disoiples of the new temporáneo will plead with us with tears in their eyes, " Give up this acoursed tea, and take to oocoa, or eves to boor." CHEATING Tras GODS -A correspondent of the North China Herald, writing from the interior of Kiangsu province, mentions that one of tho indus- tries there is the manufootare of mook money for offering to the dood Formerly the Chmese burnt sham paper money, but in these days of enlighten- ment and foreign intercourse tho natives of Soongkong, Hangohow, and other plaoes have come to the conclusion that dollars are more handy to the ghosts than clumsy paper money, hence they now, to a gieat extent, supply their ancestors and departed friends with mock dollars Thoso are only half the size of real dollars, bat thora appears to be no more harm in cheating the dead than there is in cheating the living Besides, the deoeaned are not supposed to know the difference, for many of them departed this Ufo before silver dollars wore imported into China A hundred mock Carolas dollars, done up in boxes, are sold for d4 cash Tho operation of making this money is interesting First of all there are blocks of tin which aro melted down and then poured between bsards lined with Guusse paper, and nhen the uppor board is prosied down on the lower a thick- ness of tin remains This is next cut up into strips 4in long, lin wide, aud Jin thick Somo 10 of these strips are placed evonly together, one on top of the other, and «ne end is held between the fingers, whon the workman proceeds to hammer thom out till he has beaten thom so fine that thoy aie now 3ft loug and 1ft broad, ind so thin that they are not thicker than the thinnest paper This is next pasted on common cardboard, wluch is then cut with a punching maohme to the sizo of half-dollars, and this having been dono, a boy tnkos the out-out piones in hand, and with two dies, one representing the ono side and tho other the reverso, hammers íasprossious of dollars on them, and tlio money is ready for use Another vory curious instance of the practice of cheating the gods is recorded in the samo journal, but from quite a different part of tho country It appears that dis- tricts of the Anhui province have lately boon ravaged by an epidemic, so that ia many places tho people were unabla to attond to the hm resting of tho crops An attempt was then made to deceive the gods by " playing- at" Now Year's Day and pretending that 1st September was the first day of tho now year Evory preparation for oelebrating the bogus new yoar was mado, such as burning fire-crackers und pasting happy sentences in red paper on tho doors The object was to make the god of sickness think that ho had made a mistuko in the seasons and had erred in bringing sa epidemic on the people at a tim« -«hen no epi- demics in tho course of nature should appear As any action contrary to nature done by tho gods is hablo to punishment by tho King of Heaven the actors in this fnrco thought that tho god of sickness would gather his ovil spirits back to him for four of tho disploisuro of his superior divinity This child's play received tho permission and co-opera- tion of tho local authorities, but so far no rinislo effects for the better are apparent A oDiuoua sight (savs the Wtstnwiiter Gazette) may be witnessed m St Paul's Cathedral just now, namely, the preparations for hoisting »uto position tho colossal statnes of Saints and Father« of the Church, which are being placed lu tho eight mob.es round the drum of the domo in tho interior of tho church To raiso a blook of stone weighing over a ton to the height of 135ft above the pave- ment is no easy matter 'Perilous-looking plat- forms restiug on strong jeiats and supported hy scaffolding polos at daring angles, which are marvels of skilful construction, aro erected across a narrow segment of tho domo along-sido the niche to I be filled lue saint, divided into three pieces, each weighing over a ton, and carefully padded round to guard against any injury to tho malls or railing of the Whispering Gallery as ho ascends, is attached to a pulley compo'od of several thick- nesses of rope, which, passing through a window high up in tho dome, is raised or lowered by a TV indlass workod by four men in tho stone gallery outside St Chryaestoui was safely lauded in his aerial niche about a year ago St Basil is alroady m position but awaiti the finishing touches of tho sculptor, Mr Woodington St Augustine of Hippo is now going up iu sections, and a fourth Father or Doctor of the Churoh is expeoted aloft before Christmas The saints ara riveted into tho wall behind by iron dumps or stanchions, so that, as Canon Scott Holland told tho workers and voluntary assistants of St Paul's at thoir annual dinner on St Paul's Day, nothing short? of an earthquake could dislodge them The statues are sculptured in the ateim of Messrs Farmer and Briudloy THE AOTOK AND THE Doa -Mr Henry Irving was m Scotland two oi three summers ago, and on one of his walks ho frequently met a shepherd with a iino collie Die JN eweattle Journal Htatos that he took a fancy to tho dog, nnd % few days before loa\ in,;, ho said to tko Highlander, " I will givo you ¿bO foi your csolie " Tho shepherd seemed surprised at tho amount offered and waa struck with sadness, for ho was poor and wanted the monoy, yet ho had formed so strong an attach- ment to tho dog that he could not bear the thought of parting with it After deliberating for a while, ho said, ' Na, sir, I wcsl no tak' the feefty pund " " Well, thon," said Mr Irving, " I will givo you £60 if you Uko to bring the dog to my hotel within thico days " Tho man stood looking down at his dog and waa .lient, and Mr Irving walked away At tho end of threo days ono of the hotel servants said that a shophord had oallod to see Mr Irving The Highlander and his dog carno in and the roan Bind that, although he did not want to part with tho collie, as ho WUB poor and hud a family to support, ho could not alford to keep a dog worth £00, and he had decided to aocept tho offoi Tho poor fellow took the money, and thanked Mr Irving He looked once very hard at the collie, which whined and tried to lick his hand , then he throw his arm over his oyes and ran out of the room Mr Irving biought the dsg to London, but tho rumble of the city and tho orowdB in the streets seemed to confuse him Ho grow more and more unhappy, and after a few days tho great actor began to regret his bargain, for ho had only succeeded in making himself, the shephord, and tho dog thoroughly miserable A few days after his return Mr Irving took his dog into Kensington Bardens, and for a moment the pool crcaturo brightened at the first sight of a fow »keep that were grazing uudor the trees, but soon distovormg that thoy were not his own nock nnd that his muster was not noar, ho relapsed into his usual dejection After this it was very difficult to got him to take any food, and, as he soon lost his fine uppearance and grew Joan, Mr Irving decided to g» o him his liberty So ho returned him us n prosont to the Highlander, who afterwards wrote that tho dog was so ovorjoyd to got baale homo that ho loapt upon his old master's shoulders, and then ran about the hills so wildly that ho (tho shepherd) feared fora time that ho would go mad THE INBTOREOTION JN BHAZII -Tho Sew York Het aid's Monto Video correspondent states that the Brarilmn Minister denies tho sinking of the transport Rio de Janoiro by the insurgent warship República, and says that the former vessel has been anchored off Rio Grande for tho last two mouths An important newspaper at Buonos Ayres, on the other hand, says it has information I from a trustworthy source thatth» atoryi, true, and that 1100 men were drowned. Tbla journal adds that the Bio de Janeiro wa* going fron Santos carrying 1100 armed me» from Bio Grand do Sul to aid Marshal Pelxoto. She was met by the República and waa called upon to ?urrender. Both ships at once prepared foi a fight. The República followed the trían port until nightfall, when, iaereuing her speed, she rammed the Bio de Janie», «put- ting her in two athwartships and ainking hw. Although the Repablica tried to «ave oom, ef thoso on board the other venal, ill wen drowned. Tho naval men, who, since the civil war im flblli havo had to be content with the make-believe of naval manouvres and an occasional disaster Iii, tho ramming of the Victoria, will read with na small interest tho statement that the vessel, re- cently purchased by President Pelxoto at Ne» York and Baltimore would sail on the 15ta November flying tho Brazilian flag. It vi, not intended (proceods tho telegram ingenuoual») that they should engage in any fighting until tam reached a certain Brazilian port, which the afinl, ter did not name, whore their present crews would be replaced by officers and men of tue Bnrili>tt Navy. This is just (remarks the Wettmintttr Galette) what Admiral do Mollo wanta, and ii h, has the grit with which he is oredited he will uil out of Bio, swoop down on these' vessel, whioh it ¡B not intended shall fight, and, if any New fork reporters haVo been enterprising enough to gol engaged as A.Bs. in the President', ship,, w, shall have before long full and particular aoootut, of an interesting naval engagement. If Admiral . de Mell* stays quiotly at Kio it looks as if ha woola simply be hemmed in between the forts and th, new fleet. The original report from New York was that the ships bought by the Brasilia*. Government would continue to be owned, nominally at least, by Messrs. Flint and Co. until ton reached a Brazilian part. Were this doo«, Admiral de Mello might be chary of bringing about the complications which would follow bia destruc- tion of a No w York firm's fleet. President ftUot» (possibly because for the moment he is the orten* ible representative of Brazil) seems to get a gool deal of sympathy from Washington, and Admiral de Mollo has to be careful. Perhaps thia «tato« ment that the new fleet does not expeotto be mWoJ upsn to fight in the West indies ia merely a not, and De Mollo may find it better prepared t» reçoit, him than ho expected. By the way, is it so oar tain that the robel Admiral is really able to pat to sea to tackle the ships from the North ?
