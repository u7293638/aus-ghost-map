? Now, which isthcworaoâ€”to have no appetite for your dinner, or to have no dinner for your appetite ' There arc lota of people on the one side or the other oE this question. When " good digestion waits on appetite and health on both." that is the ideal attitude of a person towards his meals. Hut most of us are not blessed in that way ; we either have too much food without an appetite, or a vigorous appetite without enough to satisfy it. Different folk will answer this question differently, yet the common sense of it is that, within reasonable limits, it is better to have an appetite without a dinner, because, short of the starvation line, a hungry man is a healthy man ; whereas a man who ought to eat and doesn't feel like eating, stands in need of "alterations and repairs." To illustrate. We recently received a communication in which the writer says, 1 was afraid to cat." Did he fancy his food was poisoued, or did his nature rebel against thei,nourishment he lived on I It' the latter, why ? Let him clear the mystery himself. He says, " In the year 1SHU 1 changed my work fram railway -porter to sigualman. I had been signalman twelve months,and then all at once, so to speak, 1 did not feel myself. My mouth tasted bad, so that ordinary articles of diet seemed to lose their flavour; the palate to put it in that way, appeared to have nothing to say to them. One thing was like another, and none was good. My tongue was coated and furred, with a dark line down the middle and yellow fur round it. My breath was offensive and my appetite poor, with pains through the chest and shoulders, which were always right before I had eaten anything. Then 1 was greatly troubled with wind, it would gather so it felt like a ball in my throat, and aet as if it would choke me." We cannot wonder that under these circumstances our friend failed to do justice to his meals. He adds that there was what he calls ai" pricking sensation" at his heart, as though it were touched with some sharp instrument. Then, again, at times he was attacked with spasms, the agony of which was so severe that the isweat i rolled,oil' him. " I dreaded,' he says, the thought oE eating, and many a scanty meal have I made, for I was afraid to eat."" "After a time I got into a low, weak, nervous condition, anil felt miserable, as if something was going to happen, and this caused me to lose a good deal of sleep." What he means by the fear of "something going to happen " is, of course, the fear of Bome calamity, such as the loss of his position, his own death, or the death of somebody dear to him. This was due, as he intimates, to the impoverished state of his blood (the life bearer), his unstrung nerves, and to the brain.enfeebled by lack of nourishment. The night of this form of illness is always full ot ghosts and goblins, the creatures of a restless and ungoverned imagination. " With great difficulty," he says, " I stuck to my work' for I had a wife and family depending on me. So I struggled on, but what 1 Suffered for over two years is past my powers of description. I am sure no one has suffered so much as I have doue." In the latter statement he is undoubtedly wrong. One's own pain is one's own, and is always harder to bear than is one's notion of ' his neighbor s pain. There is a countless multitude who are all the while going through the same wretched experience,! only we dont happen to come in touch with them. Well, the writer finally mentions that after all medical treatment had left him where it found him he chanced to :rcad in a book of a ease exactly like his own having "been cured by Mother Seigel's Syrup. " My wife," he says, "got me a bottle at Mr. Langstaff's, in Woodlesford, and after using its contents the ailment left me and has uever returned since that fortunate day. 1 should like the whole world to know what it did for mc. I have been .employed by the Midland Railway Company for eloven years. (Signed) GEOR<;E HUNT, "Calr Bottom Road, "Appcrley Bridge, near Leeds."
