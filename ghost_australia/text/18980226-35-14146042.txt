"A New English Dictionary on Historical Prin- ciples." Edited by Dr. J. A. H. Murray. The Clarendon Press : Oxford. The production of this great dictionary proceeds apace. The present number carries on its flying a dedication of the work to the Queen, dated 1897 and of all the jubilee offerings made last year, it is safe to say that this will prove the most monumental and enduring. This double section takes us to the end of the letter F and the beginning of G. The treatment of the former letter forms a half volume, respecting which it is pointed out as a curious fact that It is marked by a total absence of words directly taken from the Greek. With . this exception the half-volume is representative of all the various sources which have contributed to the formation of the language. The old English derivatives are very numerous, while no word of immediate Greek derivation begins in modern English orthography with F. If, however, a phonetic system of spelling had been adopted in English, says the prefatory note here, the proportion of seven title terms under the letter would have been very large, as it would have included the many Greek derivatives now spelt with the initial Ph. The same letter F is remarkable as covering no words beginning with Latin prefixes. As instancing the sustained effort with which the labour of this compilation is carried on it need only be mentioned here that the portion now published gives no less than 16, G la illustrative quotations appended to 3467 words, as against 2473 quotations in the Century Dictionary, and 2008 words, while the other standard works fall far below these figures. Running down, the columns of words be treated here we see the process exemplified by which words are gradually adopted into now meanings and applications, until they- become conventionalised. Thus we meet with the word "function," in its modern application to a social or festive e meeting or public ceremony. This application of the term appears to have been first adopted from the Catholic ritual, but if we may be allowed to judge from the dates of the quotations given here, this use of the word is by no means so essentially and modernly " journalese as is often supposed. We have phrases in which the term is so Used going back 40 years. But the part now before its is so 'rich in interesting instances of the derivation and application of words, that it would require an essay in itself to do justice, to its claims in this one particular We receive from the compiler, Mr James A Miller, the fifth volume of the "Australian Racing Chronicle "(JJ Miller Trait Com play) This is veritably the Australian " Ruff " It cov era the first six months of the present racing year, from August, 15", to January, 1 SIS and no properly conducted meeting in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania is ignored, the result being a complete record of rating in the whole of the colonies for the period named In addition, Mr Miller pros, idea an index of 5000 horses It must be apparent to anyone who is ill think of the task involved in this history of sport for six months that the labour is very great, and no doubt the now established portion of the " Chronicle " is an assurance that accuracy is not neglected To all people interested in Australian racing the volume is indispensable The sumptuous " Encyclopdia of Sport," which Messrs Lawrence and Fuller are producing with a taste and completeness worthy of a nation of sportsmen, begins in the new Part XI its second volume Two notable, indeed remarkable, contributions to this part are Mr T C SlIous' article on the Lion and Sir Martin Conway's piper on Mountaineering Mr R Park tells the story of Lord's Ground Mr W S Gilbert, moved Uioitto by money and misadventures, has now issued a note and complete edition of his famous "Bab Ballads," to which he has added " The Songs of a Savoyard " This most agreeable volume, admirably published by Routledge, the text supplemented by some hundreds of little drawings full of a Thnckornym humour and irony, seems to as likely to be the edition of these pleasant verses, not only for the library, but for Charles Lamb's approved book corner, the seat in the window, and the shelf where children can reach to A number of characteristic letters, passing between Tonrgnenet√Ø, the Russian novelist, and a number of the most brilliant French, men of letters of the 'sixties and so cities, have been published under the judicious editing of M Hnlpcnnc Kaminsirv m " Cosmopohs " These letters, translated by Miss Ethel M Arnold, are now published in his usual good form by Mr Fisher Unwin They are of course chiefly interesting as documents for reconstituting the Paris group- Zola, Oaudot, Sand, 1 Joubert, the Gonoourts, and others Incidcufalfv they illustrate a peculiarly pleasant side of the great Russians character, and M li improves lCnnunskv dons the further service of unravelling the tangle of falsehoods around the alleged letters in which, had such existed, Tourgucnctt would have been guilty of baseness 1 here is a blunder in Greek at page to which ought to be corrected Dr Buchheini and Messrs Macmillan and Co have done lunch service to the Englishmen interested in German poetry, a fascinating field The editor and his publishers in the Golden Treasury series have already given us two much prized volumes, "Dearie Ljrik," and Bal- laden and Romanza A third has just appeared in the same elegant series, and this is the selection which most men would rather have if they had to choose It is a copious but not a free selection from the entrancing lyrical poetry of Heinrich Iloiue, " Lieder und Gellert " Here will be found with ballads as the Two Grenadiers, ' tie it noble poem for which the French Government bestowed on the German poet the Legion of Honour , scores of the popular songs and little poems in which all the sentiment of the German race seems to breathe by the lips of a Jew It is a delightful collection, and the English publishers have given in this beautiful volume an example to German printers In the week's fiction no find two historical romances in Macmillan's Colonial Library Miss Coleridge's story of Swedish treason in " The King with Two races" is, as previously observed in this column, a readable and effective piece of work , while in a more personal and less ambitious style 4' Por Prince and People, a Tale of Old Genoa," by E K Sanders, is (good Ye also have three additions to Bell's Library Mr W T Stead's reprint of his Spook literature, " Real Ghost Stories," and another of Mrs Edward Konnard's out-of-doors pleasant novels, " At the Tau of the Hounds " During last year Mr George Gissing wrote for serial publication a number of short stories and sketches, mainly of that Net later veered of London he knows so well and describes so pitilessly These were collected in a volume, called 'A Human Odds and Ends, in which, if the reader can bear the some what suffocation;
