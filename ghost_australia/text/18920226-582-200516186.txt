Murray Sftiith, in seconding tho roso- liitipn', said that orodit was pocessary for. tho progress of a now country, and the supply: of onpital judioipuB, constant . and liberal., ; Sir Graham Borry seemed to indicate tho other day that the English capitalist had been to somo extent responsible for their present situation, inasmuoh as he had forced more money upon the colonists than thoy wanted. But the colonists took up obligations .to uso tho money wisely and well, and if they did not do so the British capi talist was not to blamo, They had nothing to complain . of the liberality and continuanoo of tho supply up to tho prosent timo. On tho 1st 1883, the debt of the colony was L22.000.000, , arid on tho 1st January, 1892, it was L43, 600,000, so that in nine yoars tho Go- Vt Tnrt«74h this oolony had roooived a supply f ("$$00. . adaitlftrt to That, apbQrding ybritiub /'puVlip, ,«ticl -munieipar bodies had" Dotrojv'bd " persons about the same amount, making a total fornino yoars of about L34, 000,000. Un doubtedly these extensive borrowings had been responsible for two evils that had bofallon tfiia; country the extensive land speculation and the) Au1C/?n rocess expenditure entered upon by the Government in consequence of the ap- parent prosperity of the oquij'try) (Hearishear.) The expenditure 'df <I877:78'W«4 largd'-'etibtiW but that of the year succeeding was £600,000 in excess of it, and thiB again was topped -/1>V LI, 760,000 more , in 1889-90. A late Treasurer had forced upon him an expenditure which had landed tho oolony last year into a deficit of somewhore over L200.000, which, if,, (ticroasqd. hy unrecouped advances, would fam'ptir.t? tb L700,000. Under the ciroumstanfes'it was' tis't' surprising perhaps that our credit hnd some what waned.
