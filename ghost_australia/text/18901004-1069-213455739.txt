POETRY. WHEN THE WIND BLOWETH IN FBOM THE SEA. In the long gray ovos of Ma!roh, whoa tho darkneis closes in, And the fire burns low and redly in tho . quiet of the room, Whou our soul's strong door is shut on tho loud world's strife and din. And the shadows gather swiftly, oh, so swifty, in tho gloom. Come the ghosts from out our Past, Ghosts of things wero ,wont to bo Flitting by as tbiok and' fast, While our hands lio on our knee. And our thoughts keep timo and tuno to" tho moaning of tho blast, As tho wind bloweth in from the Bea. All the griefs that wo have folt, all tho losses wo have known, All tho hard fights wo havo fought, with onr wounds for sole reward — How wo live thera through again to tho wild wind's wail and moan, And tho old hurts throb and burn, though so long since over-scarred ! Voices from tho far- off days, Murmur round us eerily, While the red coals hold our gaze. And the shadows giow and flee, And wo tread iu thought the tangles of our past's bowild'ring maze, When the wind .bloweth in from the sea. In the dark nights of October other - thoughts are with us yet, When the blossoms all are withered and the loaves fall from the boughr"T'5|fe When the sullen rain-drop plashes and. tbe''i:; window panes aro wet, And no hope may dwoll ; anigli;;!uSH?<!| hope of gladness now — Wliilo wo Bib and muse apart -"i--. On the hopes that used to be, Aud we hardly hsed our smart— 'Tis so old, so old, ah mo !— f And the ashes .fall and crumble like thoBe I dreams within our heart, And tho wind roareth in from the sea.
