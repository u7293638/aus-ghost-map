THE LAND ACT AND PRESELECTION. To the Editor of the Herald. I breathe Lower House of Parliament lately passed a resolution dictating to the Minister for Lands the policy to be pursued in the matter of allow ing forfeited selections to be re-elected before going to auction No one doubts the Land Act gives the Minister discretion to allow selection before auction, or auction before Teselcction, but the Assembly, in passing the resolution I refer to, should have considered, and jealously provided for due regard being paid to the obligations by which the Government were already bound, x is , the clear and unequivocal declarations and promises of former official circulars The first circular was dated 5th October, 1863, and in definite and precise terms declared, " in order that desiring purchasers may be advised, " that no such selections can be entertained, as the lands will be brought to sale by auction, without even their being again open to conditional purchasers The natural consequence of this was to induce persons to select lands with the view of sacrificing the 5s per acre deposit for the privilege and opportunity to be afforded them of bidding at auction The effect of the first circular, issued by Mr Robertson, was no doubt as clearly foreseen by him as by everyone else, and, therefore, this selecting with a view to auction must be understood as plainly intended and sane tioned by him until the 22nd October, 1865, when he issued a second circular recalling the first, and permitting forfeited selections to be re-selected before auction The policy of different modes of carrying out the statute, however numerous such changes may be, is not now the question, but simply the wrongs inflicted by such changes, being unredressed The complain against the second circular was, that it was made retrospective in operation, and thereby confiscated, or gave no value for all the deposits of 5s per acre which had been paid into the revenue on the invitation of the first circular, from the belief in its assurances that all forfeited selections should be brought to sale by auction After some time, No 3 Circular was issued by the present Ministry, and upset No 2 in favour of No 4 Circular, deciding for auction before reselection, but without doing justice, as it ought to have done, to those whose forfeited selections had in the meantime been re selected under the reign of No 2 Circular Under >o 3 many more detailed individuals were led to drop their money, when lo' yet another circular appears No 1, like one of the ghosts in Macbeth comes on the scene extinguishes No 3 and upholds the modus operandi of NO 2 ' Another confiscation of deposits follows, another despoiling of the Queen's subjects, by a paternal Government, of their money, on what appears to them ' false pretences I am aware there are a few who pretend that selecting with a view to auction is an evasion of the Land Act and deserves no quarter I beg to remind them there can be no question whatever that when >o 3 Circular wins issued its effect, in encouraging selections for the express purpose of their being brought to auction, had been openly discussed in the public papers, thoroughly understood, and clearly foreseen by all parties, and therefore such mode of action was by implication, at all events, but I will cer "dd, directly and pointedly sanctioned as a regular course under the Act I I have no desire to indulge in those terms of indig- l nant comment so current among the dupes of these juggling circulars, on the broken faith and shattered pledges of one Government after another-a conduct quite beyond the reach of Any possible amount of vituperation yet, it would almost seem, endorsed by the hasty and inconsiderate though tacit approval of the peoples representatives The Assembly, in passing the resolution interfering with the Executive as to the mode of working the Act, was bound to take care that the rights of all who would be affected by such resolution should be protected, and in neglecting -perhaps unwittingly to take that precaution has become a participator in the infliction of a grievous injustice I now wish to point out that the only honest course for the Ministry to pursue in this matter is to declare, with as little delay as possible that all forfeited selections shall be open, or otherwise, to reselection before auction, according to the terms of the particular circular under the regime of which they were taken up the exact date of every selection ison record and if there be the will, there can be no difficulty whatever in at once adopting this simple and upright course I remain, Sir, yours c, H.
