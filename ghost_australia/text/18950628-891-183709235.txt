Horseracing. Oar old friend Kremlin, by Glorious,"a fast torse and a fair performer, if winning many races on the flat- and a few over the sticks ratifies him to he so reckoned, died the other day, over the border. Banquet 1L, the American bred Selling Plater, whose mountebank performances prior to his first victory in England I noticed a week or two hack, won a second race of the kind of the value of 100 sov&, the other day, and his owner had to pay £1,510 for the privilege of retaining, him. The selling price was £100, axid £1,410 had' to he divided equally between the dob fund , and the owner of the second horse, die latter securing a far bigger stake, apart from bets, than die winner.' Sir Blunddl Maple, owner of Kirkconnd, only hacked the colt at 2 to 1 for a place—£400 ' ty £200—in the Two Thousand Guineas. Hie Sydney Iktily Telegraph says that some ago the then owner of Sunny qJlcfl in two "vot6r' to 6ee the horse, who was of? his . feed. The doctors said he was suffering from an incurable kidney affection, and recommended immediate sole. ' Sunray was, therefore, sent to \- Knbs' bazaar and sold for 22 guineas. Since he changed hands he has won 11 races out of •"14 starts. Dalby races, under the management of iho time honoured B J.C., arc advertised for August I and 2. The principal events arc the "Winter Handicap, 14 sovs., and N.DJ.C. Handicap, 22 sovs., nominations far which are due on July 15. At the Charter* Towers sab's The Abbot and 93ver*praj changed hands, the former fetchiug 115 guineas, and the latter 105 guineas. The following programme has been issued by the Q.T.C. for Friday and Saturday in Exhibi tion week (August 16 and 17): First day: Trial Handicap, 30 sovs., 7 furlongs; First \- Hurdles, 50 sovs., 2£ miles; Exhibition Handicap, 100 sovs., 14 mile; Plying Handi cap, 40 sovs., f mile; and Winter Stakes, 40 sovs. (handicap), 1 mile.

Nominations for all events on Tuesday, July 30. Weights for - first day's handicaps and Queens land Tnrf Ciob Handicap, at such . time as the stewards may appoint: acceptances August 13. Heretofore the big race over the longer distance has been styled the Q.T.C. Handicap, and it seems almost a pity to make the"41 club" event play second fiddle to any thing else in the programme; to alter the style and title of a race which has had its place in tho calendar of principal races won for many years; but as the consultations had been already advertised on the Exhibition Handi cap, it was better, perhaps, to make it the principal item of the programme, and ran it on the first of the second day; for with the sweep money hanjf* ing, as it has hitherto done, to the second leg of the double, it was putting temptation to work the "double ready" in the way of owner*, backers, and layers to run the big race first, unless there was a consultation on it, too. One cf tho published conditions likely to alluro bookmakers to Nonango races demands a deposit of £50 from each pendller in the " secretary's hands, as a guarantee of good faith during the meeting, And the payment of 10 guineas a-day for the privilege of betting at . that racing emporium. . The Prince of Wales's Persimmon, winner of the Coventry Stakes (two-year-olds) at Ascot, is a bay colt, fall bro thereto Florizel XL, by St Simon—Perdita IL', by Hampton out of Her mione, by Young Melbourne out. of JLa Belle Helen o, by St. Albans (son of Stockwell). The youngster was bred by his owner. It is unlikely that', anything of very good _ class opposed-Bavensbury in the," three-mile Alexandra Plate, for- the second to .Captain H&chdTs; colt was the hitherto, moderate lorikeet, a four-year-old by New Holland— Songleas; and the third was the handicap horse, Houndsditch, by Peter—Qnrissima. The Prince of- Wales Stakes, a three-year old event, special weights, with penalties and allowances, nm over 1 mile and 5 furlongs, was won by Lord Arlington's b. or br.c- Match maker, a half brother, by Donovan—Match Girl, to the St. Simon colt; Matchbox, who followed Dad as home in the Two Thousand Guineas and Derby, and again in the St. Leger, when Lord. Bosebeiy's colt was " downed " by the Petrarch filly, Throstle. Lord EHesmere's M'Xeil, who ran second to Matchmaker, is a ch.c. by' GaUiard out of Zariba, and the third horse; Bride of the Sea, a ch J.t by Crafton or Trayles out of the famous Isonomy mare, Seabreeze. . Weights for the two principal handicaps at Townsvillfi were declared last week. The first day's racing was brought to an issue yesterday (Thursday). It is not necessary to publish the weights,* therefore, for anything but the l£ mile Town Plate, which will be run for this afternoon:— * si lb at lb Babd 10 6 Contest 7 12 Orangeakin ,, 9 11 Monarch 7 10 Newbold .. ■ S~8 Rainbow 7 10 Young Buck Shnnt .. 7 9 thorpe . .. 9 4 Clontarf.

To raise Newbold from 8 st- to G et- 8 lbs. is a big- lift, bat the colt seems to have won his double at the Towers with eo much in hand that he may not be left without a chance at the wdghty high as it is. Still, Orangeskin and' others should hold htm safe; Donizetti may run better than he did at the Towers, where he did not run up to his form by a long* way. Hamster, Ormley, S outright, Bainbow, and Kalamia are all on the improve and in. receipt of a lot of weight from the three-year-old and the rest of the heavy brigade, while Shout aud War Queen are fairly lu. Ou- Ivtiu-MouiinJi is chucked in, and has only to be well and wanted to win as he likes. Thero was never anything "Jko a stone between him and The Abbot, but the latter, who concedes Monarch 15 lbs. here, has been apparently handicapped on the perfectly gratuitous assumption that bad the- going been-good he would have won the Brisbane Cup, for which, however, in my opinion,, he never had the ghost of a show, whatever the going was, so lung as Avenue and two or three others stood up. T6 bracket Monarch and.Rambuw together is simply to ignore public. form, which makes Monarch at least 14 lbs. a better horse than the chesaut. Results of Thursday's racing, which, at time o writing, are not to hand, should point out the winner to-day, but that source of inspiration is not available, and under the circumstances I think the winner should come from one of the following: Orangeskin, Sonbrigbt, Bainbow, Shout, Monarch, and Donizetti. For Monarch X should go " bald headed," as the poet onge, hut for doubts as tohis fitness; bat as it is the places maybe filled by Orungeelrin, Donizetti, and Rainbow. •*Veno" publishes the weights for the Blackall Winter Handicap, 1 mile; and Flying Handicap, 5 furlongs. In the fprmer the top weight is 13 st., the mmimnm 9 st. In the latter, 13 st. 2 lbs. and 9 at. 7 lbs. respectively. The post of honour is held by Ironsides in each race, and then comes Acrobat with 11 st. 12 lbs. and 12 st. .Impulse has 11 sL 6 lbs. and 11 st. 13 lbs. respectively.. The R.J.C. made a profit net over the late annual meeting of £150 Gs. 9d., the surplus, says " Veno," when all accounts are in, being £337 -is. 9d., but this includes subscriptions for the year from members- The following cheques were paid over to winners: Messrs.

The sum of £-5,775 passed through the machine on tho first, and £5,024 on the second day of the Towers Jockey Club meeting, a total of £10,799.
