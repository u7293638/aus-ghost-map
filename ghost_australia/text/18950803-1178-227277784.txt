j THE GHOST OF SHER- 1 . LOCK HOLMES. When 'Sherlock Holmes, ingenious man, pnraued his' strange career, We .studied his adventures with a sympathy > sincere, Although in time his victories monotonous bo'came, Became his baso opponents novor won a single game.

They swarm in every magazine, each journal with them teems, Dotecting obvious criminala by vory obvious schemes, Adapting to their purposes devices long ago Invented by tho master-hand of great Ga- boriau. Choir wisdom, too, is marvollous ; the mnd upon your boots Informs them to a penny what yonr balance is at Coutta' ; they know yonr mother's maiden namo, what train yon traveiied by, And if yon'vo bad lumbago— from the color of your tio ! Yes ! Sherlock Holmes is dead and gone ; but Btill in other shapes Wo meet the old detective, whom no criminal escapes ; U.11U ijaaeiui strange uccurrenco or " Mysterious Affair " . Still, still infests the magazines and drives ns to despair. Oh, ghost of Mr. Sherlook Holmos, please . mercifully kill These shameless imitators of your trans cendent skill, Or haunt the homes of editors, and pointedly suggest (That fictionary criminals might bo allowed a rest 1 , —St. James's Budget.
