WHEELMARKS. fBv Handleiur.1 The track of an evening now presents quite a lively appearance in view of the November meeting. That popular little Melbourne rider, Vf. J. C. illiot. is over for a. week on business, and has been musing goou use oi ins time uy naviug a iew spins. Though not yet in the pink of condition he is im proving, and could he but stay here up to the time of the Austral I would like his chance for the classic event. In the early morning Stapleton, May field, Davey, and others do serviceable work; whilst in the evening a long string, including Davis, Sampson, Gordon, Pearson, Snell, Hains, Baker, Toms, Gazard, Hunter, Dale, Downes, Pasquill, Bertram, Ridley, and Fowler have commenced operations. None as yet are very forward, though Davis, Baker, and Toms on safeties average C3 sec. laps. I hear that Alf. Gowling is again likely to come out. In spite of the fact that Melbourne papew are continually averring that Tom Busst will don the silk at the November carnival, I have it on credit able authority that such is not the case, and it is doubtful if he will race again. Though every one wishes that the Victorian crack will again compete, and all very much regret his indisposition, it is not fair to the public that they should be led to believe that tho noted flier will compete when there is not the slightest chance of his so doing. TheNorth Adelaides and Norwoods had a pleasant time at Gawler on Saturday last, when they were entertained by the local team. The former club wero wise in reaching their destination by train, but with the exception of two the Norwoods pro ceeded by road. The result was that they were not only too late for the reception by Mayor Cox, but the ride proved anything but pleasant. The social in the evening was very largely attended, and was most successful. On Sunday the cyclists cho3e the home route via Gumeracha, which was reached in time for dinner. The roads were in a wretched condition, and with so many waterholes to wade through dismounts were numerous. Town was reached at dusk. The cyclists speak highly of the Gawlerites' hospitality, and report that cycling is on the boom in Modern Athens. In the old days this outing was amongat the most enjoyable in the programme, and tho clubs are to be commended for their endeavours to revive old associations. Intercolonial papers were eagerly scanned on Wednesday to get a glance at the handicaps for the Austral meeting. The only South Australians entered are Geddes, Stapleton, Snell, and Bertram. It is too early yet to speak of their chances, for with the exception of the two former the nominators have not donned silk. With 100 yards in the Arstral Stapleton lias not a ghost of a chance, and it would be interesting to know how the haudi capper arrived at his conclusions. Geddes is not likely to start. Of those entered I must confess to a liking of the chances of Harry Lampton.'who was such a hot favourite last year, but was taken ill two days before; W. J. C. Elliot, Muirhead, Gonard, anil yoane Rolfe. With such a field to get through I can hardly see Mullins having a chance, thongh he is in splendid fettle; whilst J. W. H. Bu«st, Kellow, or Howard Lewis will have a hard task ta win. But now tbat the handicaps are out there may be many changes before the day, of which more anon.

The match to take place cither at Herne Hill, London, or on tho Buffalo Track, Paris, the distances to be 1, 5, and 10 kilo metres. Cassignard will ride a Clements new racer, weighing 17 lb. R. H.
