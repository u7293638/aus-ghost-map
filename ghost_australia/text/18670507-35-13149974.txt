i SENSATIONAL WRITING. -» IN a recent number we gave some specimens of the sensational writing which prevails in English literature A large proportion of these works are based on 1 reach plans and incidents The custom in France of attaching to newspapers a staff of novel writers, and making these stones a part of the daily publication, encourages this kind of writing the fashionable novels of an English circulating library) have never been much distinguished for their moral reserve But a change took place when Sir Walter Scott had pointed to history as furnish ing marvels sufficient to employ all the embellishments of fiction Since then another species of composition has come into vogue, evidently intended to meet the immense increase of the reading population, and to promote the circula- tion of serials so large a part of the literature of the day In human nature there exists a strong propensity towards the marvellous Mystery and intrigue, the bombings and twistings of social life, the difference between what seems to be and what really is such are the entertainments of writers and readers People whose minds are more solid, and who have attained a higher culture, of course soon give up reading this sort of works But as they must always be the smaller number, the talent of writers of fiction had ' gone over to the majority) " In House des Deux Mondes for the month of January, we have a specimen of this kind of writings the Revue is considered one of the most scientific and philosophical publications of France It combines the talent of writers of all classes, believers and unbelievers, monarch ists and republicans historians and novelists, all, indeed, who have anything to say and say it well, find a channel to the mind of I hope through this distinguished work We need hardly remark that to a convinced and earnest Christian there are many, things that cannot be read without pain But there is more absolute mischief, perhaps, produced to society by setting up a standard of sentiment in writing fiction than by any abstract opinion upon points of faith Such is The II til of M lußci The story opens with an account of a fiddler name Adolphe There then follows a description of a rustic entertainment, resembling all others of the kind, at which Madame Turner, a widow, was present She was thirty three years old, with sharp, brown eyes, a remarkably fresh complexion, pretty features, well set neck, singular purity of four, fine hand, and a rich and light figure She had a step slow and a little timid, like a woman for whom liberty and possession of her self were novelties, and composed of such con- Hiding conditions that she did not know whether she should dare to enjoy them She had been a widow for three years, but she was a widow without hope of escape Her late husband was a German, a respectable old man who, having carried on for a long time the business of a weaver, thought proper to fall in love Until then he had no idea of any other mission on earth but to weave After his marriage he retired with his wife Theresa to a large estate in the country, where he lived to the age of ninety years After his death Theresa, delivered from her gloom) lover, resembled a brilliant bird which clears its wings on going forth from a marsh where horrible necessity has forced her to bathe in default of pure water. The fat weaver had, however, done one ugly thing He had left half a million sterling to his well beloved Gleichen on condition that she remained a widow If she married again the money was to go to his natural heirs and the blood of the suffers He) were five brethren, having between them (twenty eight children She) came to the conclusion that a widow of that) three would prefer £20,000 rents to a second marriage, especially after the experience of the first He) therefore thought one good dollar was worth more in hand than two that were not and determined to come to an under st making with their sister in law, so that then she might marry) if she pleased They asked only a quarter of the heritage, and she was willing to give it, but a man of law interfered, and after a long consultation it was arranged that the heirs were to receive only 100,000 francs He came to the village one autumn morning with the deed in his portfolio The lawyer widow, and friends dined together and drank to the memory of the dead A neighbour of the late Mr 1 afTer, the rich Mr Isidore Goullet was invited and while the deed was being read over he beat his foot as if marking the time of music Mr Coffin the lawyer, first of the province, was a bachelor of about fifty He contemplated tendered) the widow who after this sacrifice would be perfect mistress of £100 000 The heirs, however, did not come and Theresa was impatient These people do not come, said she "But the) will be here,' said he, " and you will dictate the law to them ' At this M Isidore, the neighbour moved his head as a sort of cadence, and his flat and yellow face laughed, but he did not say a word Mr Coffin continued to chant the victor), vaunted to have foreseen all in the deed he had prepared He had in fact foreseen all save that the rever sionists had not signed, and did not come the week following he learned that they had sold their rights to M Isidore Garden, who had given to them that which the advocate of Madame Infier had obstinately) refused, oOOOOO francs The first impulse of Madame Theresa on learning this news was to laugh Mr Coffin did not laugh, but cried out that Mr Isidore was a bad man Madame Theresa send Air Isidore was a fool, because his wickedness would do him no good It will put 100,000 francs into his pocket, said Mr Cohn, since you will be his wife, because he can stop you from espousing all others ' I have no desire to marry " said Theresa " But the desire may come, ' said Mr Coffin So the counsel and his client continue to talk "Is it not absolutely necessary that you should marry in order thallium) be happy) with those you love? has thought had never come clearly into the head of Mrs Tuffer Mr Cohen said they could not make Mr Isidore throw his body into the river But," said Theresa, with a faint smile, "he would find the means of fishing it out " " The condition inserted in the testament of the late Mr suffer," said Mr Coffin, is " contrary to public orders and morals " The story, however, proceeds to tell that Madame Tuner's affections were already bestowed on one Dionis She expresses the strength of this passion in a way not to be transferred to our columns After having to this extent followed the suggestion of her legal adviser, she exclaims 'A Dionis ' Dionis ' You are my hus I hand, before God " " Poor child," murmured her paramour The contract would have been very much better if men had signed it He quits her house, his steps faltered, he stumbled like a man intoxicated His brain was on fire, his reason was drowned He turned and called to Theresa, but her sweet ' voice did not answer him Still the bright vision was before him He extended his arms to seize her, but she faded away in the white- ness of (he horizon He called her anew and she appeared again While in this state he heard the "Angelus,' and after abusing the bells in the usual style of people who violate all social laws, he heard a vehicle coming along at a smart trot He recognised Isidore, who, contrary to his custom, was alone "I perish in agony and shame, said Dionis, "but you shall not enrich yourself I will not espouse Theresa 1 will leave her, but you shall not have the money Without knowing what he did he came from his hiding place, and with clenched teeth and burning hands, sat down before a clump of trees in the midst of a field of stones near the place where Isidore must pass He took at hazard a large stone and sent it weaving through the air The villain fell forward in his carriage and was carried by his own weight on to the back of the horse The animal plunged and threw his burden into a ditch Dionis was immovable Isidore did not rise At that time the old fiddler passed along Seeing the horse and the carriage and finally the deceased, he descended into the ditch and robbed him of his treasure Among which was the deed, by which he acquired the rights of the heirs of the weaver the death was reported in the village Theresa says, An ' Dionib, ought we ever to rejoice over the death of a sinner who has not had time to repent ? If that is permitted it is we who may do so " After a short time Dionis marries Theresa, in spite of the will The lawyer Coffin, who has heard of the death of Isidore, makes his appearance to try his chance, and is disgusted to see himself in the midst of the nuptial festivities He beats a retreat with a bitter politeness, and predictions of rain In the last scene, Dionis explains his position He exclaims " Dr) mc these tears because they are no more in season You love me you love also these fields and these woods, which you have purchased so dear) They would say I love them much more than you, if they knew that which I have done that I might not lose them" "Never," said Dionis, "do I wish to see again that field of stones Never will I for low that road for the rest of my life But he w horn I await has armed ' Then follows an account of an interview between Dionis and Adolphe - "How much do you want for that which I ask ?" said Dionis The price is named, and the money paid Dionis delivers up the deed with a coarse laugh And the portfolio," said Dionis, "have you burnt it But the fiddler held to his boot) and walked out simplicity) and innocence ' Probity) in the fields Theresa drew herself towards her husband Do I understand then said she, that it was not the horse that killed M Isidore, but that it was this man ? ' Dionis took her two hands in his, looked steadfastly) at her, and said " No, it was I I have made you afraid,' he added She threw herself on his neck She drew back her free from his, and looked at him at her ease 'It was you that killed him' Said she, "How much you must have loved me' Theresa rose up quickly) Come, let us listen to the nightingale, she said, but immediately) after quitting the saloon there numbered that they had forgotten the deed, and exclaimed, Has not Isidore done you enough mischief that you leave it for his ghost to steal ? ' She put a candle to the paper, and the deed was burned Poor Isidore ' whether by sea or by somebody else was it not necessary that he should be punished This was the last word of his funeral oration he had not merited less Such is the story of one of the recent novels of the first literary publications of France the writer must have proposed to himself some object in such a description, but a more diabolical representation of a woman could c reel) be imagined. The stone thrown by the murderer expressed a passion known to fallen 1 timanily , but it awakens in the breast of Theresa serene and almost celestial com plaisance The moral of the tale is how much a woman must love a man who commits a murder for her sake
