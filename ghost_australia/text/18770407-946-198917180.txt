OLD RABY'S WILL r ?' , . . -.and, ?' ;. . ? '?? . . ; WHAT CAME OF IT. . By the Abtiior of ' Decoyed prom /. ,; . HER HomkI' , . ,, ' Chapter XVIII. ; When Hngh Leigh awakes on the Wednesday .morning, it is raining heavily, and the rain keeps on all day. He tries to recall the events of the past evening. He remembers' that Edith took Angola into the (1 house, when .the door was hurriedly shut without either of;;thein saying 'Good night.' Hugh Leigh found , his way out of the garden alone. ; : walked, or rathor staggered back to Hill Peak ; and,: over a pipe arid; n glass of grog, tries to convince himself that ho had done nothing but what was natural and right, when all the time it seemed as if he had been doing wrong. ? Had ho done wrong ? As long as gixls are fair, and men have eyee',' the one will love the other. Angela is n girl; and Hugh loves her with a love ns pore as the girl herself. Such being the case, ho has simply done what man was sent on earth to do. ?And yet Hugh : feels far from com-, fortable. Ho is happy in one respect. Angela is a girl, and she loves him. Bnt something tells Hugh that there are many unknown difficulties to be overcome before he can claim Angela ; and a melancholy idea haunts him that perhaps he will not win his love after all. ? T?et it should be easy enough- ] Angela is young at present ; but il she ' 5s really the sister of Edith Wood, why shonld Barbara object to her poor granddaughter beooming the bride of a rich young gentleman like Hugh Leigh? And even if Angela' is the daughter of 'Sir- Frederick 'Garstone, 'as/Hugh often thinks, surely Sir Frederick should not object to the marriage when he ikdows that Hugh Leigh , is not only a gentleman of fortune and good ?character, but a gentleman of good birth as well. Perhaps the most proper thing for Hugh to do would be to go to Mrs Grey, .arid tell her everything ; but the .way Edith said ' I dane not !' makes Hugh think that,' for the present, old Barbara must be kept in ignorance. 'Hiigh was half afraid to go to Gar stonq 'Grange.; he is: afraid1 that some thing .will . happen ;to drive away the lappiness that came to him the 'night ibefore. For-one day at least ho. wall remain happy in the . thought that Angela is a girl and Angela^ loves him! IForone day bo will keep ' away from 'Garstbne Grange. '. , ?,It is a; wet,, miserable Wednesday out Tof doors ;, it is a dark, chilly Wednesday indoors ; but it is' a happy' Wednesday to Hugh Leigh. He is happy : because he is living in the present, and has. put 'off all troublesome thoughts of the fnture until to morrow- All day long he thinks -of Angela, whilst: ? the rain, ;beats against the Hill1 Peak windows, and half drowns the autumn flowersin Hill Peak garden. _ Towards evening an open carriage drives op the hill, driven by the sad faued driver! who .drove : Hugh, to Hill Peak when he first -*me to Bleakshire. Two people are in ; the carriage, hidden ?''»»«' 'lupiMiigH ana umoreiias. Withia the carriage and on the coach man's seat are also some dozen small parcels, bundles, and bandboxes.; , ?.??;.' Hugh opens the gate himsef, and' welcomes Mr . Puddicomb, looking more, halo and hearty than ever, and Mrs Paddicomb, whose charms ire at present concealed by a thick veil and a long waterproof cloak. ' ' . 'Hope you haven't got wet ?' says Hngh, as they stand in the hall, sur rounded with the numerous parcels and packages.. Ladies of Mrs Puddicoinb's class will, never iunderstand that one large, box will hold; as much as twenty /small parcels, and is much 'more1 con ^«nient for travqlling^ ' '', ;««Dry;asV bone,': answers, Mr Pud-' dreomb, ' or rather as. iwaboneV' look- ; ing affectionately at his! bride. 'We canMh't get a i.closed carriage, but,1 thankgito the 'brellas, we.bav'e scarcely .wkiadiropofrai^^'Bat.r.liaveri't'in troduced yon ? ; , Bessie, ' my1 .dear, this as Mr Leigh.' \ ?.::':,.:_.;!./;'??. . ;,v ; :Mrsv;'P»ddicpmb'. bobs,' and Hugh 'If you like to .change your damp things, Mrs Mackay will show you. to your room.' Old Margery, with some difficulty, conducts Mrs .Puddicbmb upstairs. Mr Puddicomb simply takes off his hat and overcoat, hangs them up in the hall, and follows Hugh into the dining, room., ' This is like a dream,', says the old gentleman, ' coming back to Hill Peak after these years. I never thought- I should see the dear old place again; and I 'shall never forget your kindness in giving me the opportunity.' . . ; , 'Don't mention it,'' says Hugh. 'But I'm afraid you will find Hill Peak rathor dull after Bow/ ' 'This will be: a treat for Mrs P. I dare say she has i ' never been in such a grand old house : before. It seems a strange thing to bring Bessie down to the samo house- where, I courted my poor Rachel, when, I was a young man like you, Mr Leigh.' : ' The living should never be jealous of the dead.' ' Bessie isn't jealous, sir. She dotes upon me, though I am an old man. Why, she likes to hear me talk about my firet wife, and says, 'Go on Mr P., tell me os much about her as you can, so that I can try and follow in your poor Rachel's footsteps.' Bessie's a good girl, sir — I may say a fine girl ; but I wonder what poor Rachel would i think if she could know I had married again ? For Bessie, with all her virtues, isn't exactly a lady, She drops her h's, says ' drownded' and 'sperrots,' and thinks nil foreign places are in France. Now Rachel was ? a real lady, poor Arthur Raby's mother's only sister, and I was a real gentleman in those days. I bad a nice little property, and lived at Marlowe. ? It was nine miles from here, bnt I thought nothing of walking to Hill Peak and back to see my Rachel. Wo had a long courtship — nearly ten years— arid soon after our marriage, I sold my; Bleakshire property and went to London,.' where we lived happily for many years. I foolishly placed my money in railways, and nearly lost it all. I could never have married again had it not been for poor Arthur's thousand pounds.' So old Raby's money has already done some good. It has given Mr Puddicomb many comforts in his old age,, including a wife; not that wives are comforts as a matter of course; some, of them, alas ! are just the opposite. It has made Captain De Clancy turn respectable, and has been the . means of his meeting with Lucy - Harrington ; and it has saved Hngh Leigh from a life of poverty and ? unremunerative work, has given him: a country house, good clothes, good dinners, and good wines ; and had it not been for old Raby's money, , Hugh Leigh and' Angela' might'never have met. Perhaps it would have been better for both' had they never heard of each , other's ex-1 istonce. v . , . ... , . : ; ? Mrs Puddicomb enters the room, dressed in an unbecoming red merino, which1 scarcely1 suits her 'red face and still redder hair. Hugh thinks her charms have been somewhat overpraised. Her face looks good-tempered enough, but only jnst escapes being plain; her figure is far from graceful ;?: and her teeth are not so very beautiful after all. Mrs Pnddicomb must bo at least thirty; but, then, a woman of thirty is a 'mere child' in the eves of a man Dast seventy. After dinner, as theysip their wine, Mr Puddicomb is full of recollections of the old days. ' You must excuse me bringing up the past,' he says to his wife. 'It is scarcely the thing, when you are present, tobe i wandering back to the days when another lady's name was engraved on the heart which is now written all over with Bessie.' ?-???? ',.'..' I ' If you . outlives me,' says. Mrs Phddicomb, ' which I really and truly, hopes you won't, I shall talk about you as long as breath remains to talk.' , 'Did yon' ever' see1 Sir Frederick Garstone, ?'' asks Hugh. . Mr Puddicombtbinks, and then he ' Says'i^'_.! .' .. ' ? '.' . ' ? ., ' : ^''Sir ^Frederick Garstone? You mean the present baronet? I've often beard of him, but I never saw him; He was quite a boy when I lived here, aridi ' by all accounts, a wild, untameable,, boy, who would have. , his own way in every thing.' .

We loft the Bank. together, they entered a cab, and, as the, cab drove off, I saw the lady's face. She: was; none other than Marian Mansfield, poor/Arthur Raby's sister.'1 ? ? -: ' \':j:: 'I thought she, was in India.' , ' So did I. . The ,)if tie man at the Dank wasn't Major Mansfield. I should have liked to have; soon her when she first heard that, her'namo was left out of old Raby's will.';?. ?;? ' They retire early,rand, -at six o'clock the next morning,' Hugh hears Mr Pnddicomb's voice in the garden, calling to tho chickens^ When, Hugh looks out of the window,' ho -seek-Mrs Puddicomb busily employed in tying'up 8ome droop ing holly hoclcs. He soon discovers that that lady never happy1 unless she was doing Romo thing useful. ' I have not . made' many acquaint ances in Bleakshiro at present,' snys Hugh,, after breakfast ;„ but I have threo young . friends whom I hope to bring here in the course of the day.' 'I hope' they are not swells !' ex claims Mrs Pnddicomb. 'I ahva}Ts feel so frightened of swells.' 'These nrc three children, the grand children of Sir , Frederick Garstono's old housekeeper.' 'You are fond of children,' says Air Puddicomb. 'I remember you had a little sweetheart whon you lived in Chapter street.''-.';' Hugh thinks his ' love for Polly Smith, who was 'only seven years old, was a very, different thing from his love for Angela, who is nearly six teen. '. i : So, leaving his guests to potter about in the garden, Hugh walks down to Garstone Grange. :i There, is no rain this morning, but tho road is frightfully ,dirty, and big 'drorj'si-Sre -'still falling from off 'tlfe.'tr'c'e?. --,, Hugh rings the Grange bell three times before anyone comes to the gate . Jnst as he is going to ring again, old Barbara makes her appearance. ' I thought the place was deserted,' says Hugh. ' Don't come near me, Mr Leigh, the fever's in the house, and I may give it to you !' 'The fever! Who has it?' 'All three of them, and they're as bad as they well can be.1' ' When did this come on ?'' ' Yesterday morning. They're been sickening for days, but I thought it was only the heat. When I saw how ill they were, I came to this gate, and waited until a boy passed, whom I sen t to Dr. (Jrawley, at Irontown.' ' Why did yon not send for me ?»' 'You're a young man, and this, fever's as catching as it's dangerous. I shonld advise you. to keep away from ' the Grange for the present.' ?'' And what did Dr. Crawley say , ?'. , ' He says they have canght the terrible fever which has killed so many at Irontown ; and he cays they require the greatest care. The poor children are down with the fever, Mr Leigh, and ouronly hope is the. goodness' of Pro vidence.' ., 'Have they any nurse besides your sen r 'I'm an old woman, Mr Leigh, but they are safer in my sole care than if we had half-aJoitten paid nurses from Iron town.' ' / am not afraid of the fever.' I shall call here every day, and if any thing is wanted, you will not object;to . me providing tho money.' ..,.., 'Thank you, sir. Money is scarce at Garstono Grange; and pride -ain't no use when -there's sickness' in! the house.'; ' ?:.-'. ? : ?''?: c :!? .? Angela is ill ! Angela is in danger ! ?But few' of the people who have been attacked 'with that fever have recovered. Why ..should Angola be more for tunate .'than, the others ? The blow i has; '? come so suddenly to Hugh' Loiglr that ho can 'scarcely realise the truth at first, But two days ago ho was thinking that Angela would have1 tpf die ; arid now, ?. , When Hngh was, in London, he 6aw a play called 'The Angel of Death.' That angel, in many disguises, was ? supposed: to bannt the world, and when she 'singled ont a victitnj she touched that victim with' her sickle. '' .'?'..' I ^Tho Angel of Death is now .hoyeririg over Garetone Grange. Who will her Tictiins.be.'? ; ; .-' A . .: ?.??:?? ?..: .;.' ...-.? Chapteu XIX. If Mr Puddicomb is over in his ele ment it is when he is pottering about in a garden. He is doing so now, having a. regular revel amongst the slugs and snails, the cabbages and tho roses, and enjoying himself as only a Cockney can. The garden at Bow is little bettor than a back yard ; com pared with tho garden at Bow, tho Hill Peak Garden ir a little Garden of Eden, therefore, is Mr Priddicomb supremely happy. Mrs Pnddicomb, forgetting that she is the guest of the, master of tho house, is helping old Margery, who is hobbling between two rows of French beans, which are almost as tall as herself. Tlio two are having an interesting conversa tion as to the best way of making mint sauce, when Hugh Leigh returns. ' Why, you are looking as whito as a ghost ['exclaimed Mr Puddicomb. ' No ill news, I hope ?' At the sound of 'ill news' Mrs Puddicomb rushes across the beds, dropping the beans from her apro nas she runs. ' I have indeed heard bad news,' says Hngh. ' My friends I told yon about this morning are all three dangerously ill with the fever.'' ' They were talking about it in the train,'' says Mr Puddicomb. ' They said it was like the plague in Iron town.' ' It is indeed,1' says Hugh. ' Over a huii'lred died of it last woelc. Are you afraid of the fevor ?'' 'Not for myself, but Mrs P. is n dreadful woman for catching com plaints. Why tlo you ask ?' ' At the risk of frightening you I must tell you the truth. I have been far from well tho last few days. I was constantly with Mrs Grey's grand children up till Tuesday night ; I may have caught the fever myself.' ' And if yon do have the fever,' says Mrs Puddicomb, ' I shall think it fortu nate that I am staying at Hill Peak, for I have had great experience of sick ness, and consider myselt a first-rate nurse.' ' Are you not afraid of catching it yourself ?' ' I have had it twice already. People seldom catch the fever a third time.1' A week goes by — a sad week to Hngh Leigh. Each day — sometimes twice a day — he goes to Garstone Grange ; but it is always the same news 5 Mrs Grey's grandchildren are neither better nor worse. Sad tales come from Trontown — tales of parents dying and children left to starve — tales of- people lying dead and nnburied for days — tales of courts and allevs where it is death to 00 down. In some streets black flags hang from the corner houses, warning passers by that the very air which blows through those streets in the black breath of fever. A fund is being raised to help those whose friends and protectors have fallen victims to the Demon of Fever, and when the committee call at Hill Peak, Hngh Leigh gives fifty pounds. He also gives ten pounds to old Barbara Grey. At present, it is only of use to pay the doctor ; but if the children re cover they will bo able to have better food than the usual fare of Garstone Grange. All things considered, Mr and Mrs Pnddicomb have a pleasant time at Hill Peak. They seldom leave the place ; for it is scarcely safe to go to Irontown, and the common and country lanes are too muddy for people ac customed to the paved streets of Lon don ; but they have the garden, and when it rains they have the house, and that is all they want. :At tho. end of the week the sad-faced coachman comes to Hill Peak to drive Hugh's guests away. ' If ever you come to London,' says Mr Pnddicomb, ' remember your home is at Bow.' ? ' Our 'ouse is a poor place after 'ill Peak,' says tho lady ; ' bnt Bow is a cheerful neighborhood, arid we will do our utmost to make you 'appy.' Then Hugh is left alone with his thoughts. . What thoughts are they ? Angela is. lying, ill, perhaps dying, and Hugh may.never see her againl Hugh ? knew that ho would' have many obstacles to overcomo before he 'could' claim his love ; but now there may be an obstacle which it is'nbt for mortals, to defeat. Hngh Leigh does not catch the fever. Considering -that he. held;, Angela in his arms and kissed her when the fever most hare been in her veins and on her lips, it is strange that he escaped. But there is a mysterious law in con nection with contagious diseases -wHiicSi is beyond tho wisdom of mortals lo fathom. . Hugh goes to Garstono Grange, is talking to old Barbara at the gate frbeb Doctor Crawley comeB out. Ho is a cross, disagreeable-looking man, inilb penetrating eyes and a sneering rooatb, more like a detective than the tisnal good-torupered, choorful gentlemen the members of tho medical profession are as a rnle. ' This is Mr Leigh,' says oltP Barbara, ' tho gentleman who lives at Hill Peak.' ' I must have a few words with Mr Leigh,' says the doctor ; and ho loo&s-; at Hugh as a policeman might look aft a man who is ' wanted.' ' And I have been wanting to see yon every day for the last week,'' says' Hugh, ' only somehow I have alwajs missed you. Will yon come to ray house ? It is not far off.' ' My time is too valuablo togo- to any house just now, uxcept where there' is sickness. For tin- last few weeks 3' havo been with the sick and dying from morning until night — Sometimes I hate not had time to take off my clothes for flays together, sleeping when and where I can. I don't do it for money, because my patients are, as a rule, too poor lo pay. I do it, sir, because it is my duty. If yon have lime to vrulk a littlo way down the hill we can talk db we go along,' '1 lie doctor unfastens his horse from the Grange gate, leads the animal slowly down the hill, and begins — ' I was called to Garstono Grange to attend t 0 boys and a girl, the grand childron of the old housekeoper, trbo were sick with the fever. I came, ea&* found two girls and a boy. I know 'the children by sight — I know everybody about here by sight; I have seen them in Irontown, and I have seen them frith you, sir ; an-1 tlio tallest of the three}, who has been going about dressed jis a hoy, I soon found out was a girl. I said to Mrs Grey, ' You are deceiving ? mo — that is no boy !' She said rat∨ rudely, ' It is no matter to you what he - is ! Everybody out of this house be lieves him to be a boy ; and I trust ttoi you, as a gentleman and a man of honor, will keep the secret.' ' ' And yet you mention it to me ?'' ' Because I know that you are in ibe ? secret. That girl became delirious, and she spoke of you as if yon were a great' dpal more than a more acquaintance. There is something strange, perhaps ? nnlawfnl, in all this ; and unless yew can explain my suspicions away, I sbal) deem it my duty to have the matter thoroughly investigated.' ' I believe there is some mystery ; but' I know little moro than you do.' ' You knew that tho supposed' boy was a eirl ?' ' Not until within the last few days; You spoke of suspicions. Tell me what you mean ?' ' T will. I think the worst, as I always do. I think that you have taftew some yonng girl from her friends, and disguised her as a boy to prevent yonr evil conduct frnm being discovered.' ' Doctor Crawloy, you may be a. clever man, bnt you have not guessed tho truth. You havo no right to ? qnoRtion mo ; bnt, for the sake of that girl's character, I will tell you all. 1 don't know who sho is. I only know that she is a girl, and that I love hrov Shonld she recover I hope to make her my wife. Yon believe me ?' ' Mr Leigh, I don't.' ' And yon will keep this secret ?'* 'Only as long as tho girl is in. danger of death.' ? What Doctor Crawley meant to- iio will never be known. Within i! reo weeks from that day he was dead, aitdi the fever killed him. ??'??ir$i$ And now there is a funeral at Gar stone Grange. Little Tommy, tho deaf. and dnttuV boy,' is dead. Oh a Sunday morning ho is buried in Irontown Cemetery ; and :Flugh' Leigh is the only friend who sees the tiny coffin lowered into- tlher grave, old Barbara being unable to leave the others, ; Who will be the next victim ? Alas ! victims are many before tho Fever Demon flies away from' Iron toww; but ' Angela and Edith are spamL When Hugh calls one morning he hears that Edith is well enough to sit up, and that Angela, though still weak^iaoutof. danger. Day after day tjic/iiows is better. AJ last Hugh heaisf ll&tKEM;'th has fome down* stau s, and that /)d-gc'a is i\, ec-.s ted to do the wmo j^aiday or two.
