Bhahsperi Conglommorofunnidogammonioe , a Musical Extravaganza , hv CTidrles London:, Whittaker, 1843. - Here is a singular title prefixed to a not less ; singular D rama j in which the author brings simultaneously on the stage the principal characters of the Bard of Avon ; namely, Richard III., Macbeth, Othello, Hamlet, the Ghost, Sir John Falstaff, Shvlock, Justice Shallow, Ophelia, Anne Page, &c.;, for the purpose of shewing, in a laughable way, the working of the New South Wales Insolvent Act, and the value of sheep and cattle, and mortgage securities at the present time. The piece contains a number of comic songs, adapted to well-known airs, and is full of humour from beginning to end. It is indeed by far the most rich, in this kind of merit, of the productions that have issued from the pen of its author. We can, there fore, recommend its perusal as a certain temporary relief from the " dull care" now universally prevalent.
