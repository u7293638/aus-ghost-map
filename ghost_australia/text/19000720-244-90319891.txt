According to last issue of the "Reporter" the machine completed the work of cleaning watcrtables on the roads in the South liding, in a5 days, at a cost of £9 11/; simnilar work last year under contracts costing £23 "r f;. If thik be so, there still remains another important tlucstion to answer, viz.--' Waill the machine effectively and with .-imilar economy, do the more important work of str? t formation, which the shire is so much in need of? " If it will, the purchase cannot have beenl a great mistake after all (notwithstanding that it is presumed to have lar'et responsible for the raising of the rate to 2 ), as it is likely to pay handsomely in thee end. The items of cost connected with the road machinery are put down in the council's estimate of expen diture for the current .ear as follows:- Cost of machinery, .£20s ltist;; horse hire, £17.0; wages of machinery man, £130 ; total, £t"`+ Iftft;. The item for horse hire provides for the machine being worked 10ti days out of the :l: working days of the year. Charging only the 100 days for the machinery mlan, the total cost would be about f4t00, which would be tmet by a 2: rate. The price lixed by the council for the hire of the machinery to any priantae indi. vidual is .:2 10; rer day (including machinery, worker, driver, and teanm of • hor<es.) The members of the executive fully discussed the questions involved in the information above given, and the general impression was that two municipal ghosts had been laid, the meeting agreeing that the association would have little to do as far as municipal mnatters are concerned, until about the time for framing next year's estimate.

MI. Coghlill, the president and secretary were instructed to confer with :t-e president and secretary of the Surrey hills associa tion in regard to extra and quicker trains, and to draw ttp a comintttnica tion in the matter for submission at the next Imeteting. It was pointed out that the wide blanks occurring between the trains 1cavintg Princes lridge at 11 a.t. and 12.15 p.mt., betweetn thotse leaving at 12.2(1 land 1,20 p.m., and also between those leaving at 10.25 and 11.25 p.m.. ntight be filled in, in each case by the runnting of an additional train. It was sug gested that the running through to ilox lill of the following trains mtiglht be practicable, and would mtuct the case, viz., those leavinlg Princes lridge for Catmberwvell at 11.20 a.mt., at 12.10 anud 10.15 pan. The two first-namted would. on the returu journey fill up big blanks betweent the trains at presesnt leaving lox Hill for the city, and the 10.15 would on the return journey take the place of the train now leaving Box Ilill ttt 11.17, the time-es almost coinciding. It was also agreed to urge. that the 5.12 p.m. train to Lilvdale should be made more of an express than it is at present. There was considerable discussion as to the need for improved station accommnodation at Box lill, the inconvenience caused througlh the close proximity of the ladies' waiting roomt to he booking oflice being especially pointed out, also tho hard ship occasioned to those who have to carry heavy loads of milk and other goods up the ramp to the platform. On the itotion of Messrs Ellingworth and BIatten, it was decided that a communication be sent to the acting comumitssioner pointing out the urgent need for new station buildings at Blox Hill. The next meeting of the executive will be held at the Young Msen's club rooms on Tuesday evening, .uly 21, at 7 80 sharp. Oflice- bearers are particularly requested to note tihe meeting night-next Tuesday.
