CHRISTMAS GHOSTS. Between the moonlight and the fire In winter evenings long ago, What ghosts I raised at your desire, To make your leaping blood run slow! How old, how grave, how wise we grow, What Christian ghost can make us chill, Save those that troop in mournful row, The ghosts we all can raise at will f The beast can talk in barn and byre On Christmas Eve, old legends know, As one by one the yeajs retire, We men fall silent then, I trow, Such sights has memory to show, Such voices from the distance thrill, Ab, me, they come with Christmas snow, The ghosts we all can raise at will. Ob, children of the village choir, Your carols on the midnight throw, Oh, bright across the mist and mire, Ye ruddy hearts of Christmas glow. Beat back the shades, beat back the woe, Renew the strength of moral will, Be welcome all to come or go, The ghosts we all can raise at will. Friend, sursum cordat soon or slow We part like guests who've 'joyed their fill, Forget them not, nor mourn them so, The ghosts we all can raise at wilL â€”Andrew Lano*
