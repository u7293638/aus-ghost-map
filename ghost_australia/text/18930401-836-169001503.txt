London. : February 17. MkI: Gladstone .delivered himself of ; his Home Rule Bfll oU jMonday, amidstv circhm stancoi 'of the ' greatest excitement;-.. The doors' of' the House were not opened tUl twelve, and then -an unseemly 'rush .of M«P.'s took place, one old man' being .knocked . down and trampled under foot. The 'speech took two hours and a half, Mr. Gladstone s voice hot .being equal to the effort1 unfortunately. As to tne comments vof/men aud - parties, Tories, of courseV^oppose' everything with a non posiumus attitude; Radicals of the left wing dislike the retention of the Irish M.P.*s at Westminster, and the Nationalists express a guarded approval of the Bill, qualified by objections to' the veto and. the financial proposals. ?. There is not very much difference between/ this Bill and the' 1886 measure, save two clauses for the . retention of the Irish members at Westminster. The Gov ernment are strong in the House now, .with their majority , increased' to 42. There 'is every prospect of the Bill being passed through the Commons.. | Your late visitors Mrs. James Brown Potter and Mr. Kyrle Belle w, have, been- having a run ' of -bad luck since they' departed from your shores. Their Loudon season at the Shaftesbury, where they J produced Mr. BeUew*s absurd version r of 'Hero and Leander,' 'was a 'disastrous failure, their tour in South Africa waa| brought to an untimely end by the burning of the theatre in which they were acting -, at Capetown and the loss of . oil their dresses; and properties, and their still more recent American campaign has turned out to be evenj.more disastrous than the rest-. ? And now when they have survived all these hardships,' the ghost of tne South African tour has risen in a most blood curdling manner, and demands - money far breach of contract. - Mr. and Mrs. Lorraine who wero engaged for a period of six months at a salary of £6 per wees each, were thrown out of engagement* 'and practically stranded in S-mth Africa1 about a month after they arrived there, for when . tbe| theatre was ie dnced to ashes, tho Potter— Belle w combina tion hurried bock- to , London and left their unfortunate employees behind them in destitute circumstances. : Mr. and Mrs. Lorraino followed them to London however andlhecaso was before Mr. Justice Bruce \- this week. His Lordship docided that Potter Bellow had behaved wrongly, and he gave judgement for the plaintiffs for the amonnt agreed upon— viz., £157. There is, I may, remark here* a strong' dislike among actors: to bringing notions against managers who pay ; them falsely, for it givos them a bad name; and makes other managers sby of giving them engagements* and the consequence is that tho^ poor mummer is iu many cases treated to very scurvy treatment from swindling employ - ? era, and as n rale be bears tit quiotly, and hopes for hotter luck 'next time. However, ' popular opinion is with Mr.! and Mrs. Loraino in this instance, and if it; bo a tparning.to tricky managors in the future, they will havo done a good turn to tho profession gonorally. ?The mention of the names of Mrs. Potter and Mr. Bellow reminds mo of tho very for giving manner lu which thoy havo behaved to wards, ono another in tho past. When ' Hero and Leander' died a natural doath-and it passed quiotly away after a jvory short Illness —tho partnership botween tho two 'stars' was dissolved. Mrs, Potter told an inter viewer that Mr. Bellow was pot a good onough aotorto play with her in - serious plays, and Mr. Bollew, being of an equally confiding teraperamont, assured a representative of tho press, that Mrs. Potter would spoil tho best play that was ever written; So for a tlmo they wont their different ways. Mrs. Potter rested aud Mr. Bellow accepted an ongago' ment at the AdolpM Theatre, but differences aroso between tho management and himsolf, ; and ho loft tho theatre. Ho said that the# parte they gavo him to play,! were not: equal to his abilities, but tboso who wero M in the know' though thoro must bojothcr reasons for tho spllW Tho noxt thing we hoard was that bygones wore to bo' bygoncb, and that tlio Pottcr-Bellew partnership was formed again. ^ People smiled when the news was first pub-, ^ Iishcil, and wero disbelieving, but the fact soon became apparent, and tho partners - loft for' America to undertake tho tour which ended so disastrously to them both. . , ; . Mrs. Bernard Beere; who tried ia^ vain to court popularity in Australia, has failed in a: .. similar endeavor in the United States* and: / . she has returned to London in disgast. Hard., and- bitter things sho -has- to say , abont^ America , and the Americans, but oven - her; v failure in Australia has not embittered hor- k... against you. To an interviewer recently - has been loni in praise of everything apjfciP* taining to tho Antipodes— its cities, its people, ;? , -v its theatres, and its climate — and she declares ; that as soon as sho has made , her pile, sho. ? »? - will at once take passage in a P. and O. . / liner and live and die in a bungalow-dwelling . under tho Southern Cross. I cannot tell you * which colony she has decidod to erect . hcr ^ / bungalow-dwelling in, as she did not mention ; /** the fact. Probably she thinks she has time ; enough before her in which to mako up her ; ? .*; mind on this point. ^ As yon are probably aware, the great and 4. all prevailing rage among Englishmen at ^ the ; ..y/ g resent moment is to float Limited ' Liability , ompanies. ITie/mania, it is true, starts ; 1 some time ago, and ' instead of : decreasing, /it * ^.v. appears to be increasing in popularity. :. Tho ; ? latest and moat discussed concern that .has '? .. ^ ??? -j? been offered to English speculators is 'tho j business or entertainment known ' as - the / ' ^ Moore and Burjpaat Minstrels.^ This par ticular entertainment has been in existenco ?for over 20 years, and is, oseverybody know?, ! a Christy Minstrel tronpo \yho have hitherto ? performed only in London. In - January Messrs. Moore and Burgess sold the London rights of their entertainment to a Limited Liability Company for £65,000 and now they - - . / are trying to dispose of their provincial rights in the^same manner for £40,000. ) Among .the directors of this provincial company, are ? ? ; - fouml the ^rnes of Mr. C. Haddon Chambers, the^ustraato ^dramatist ; Mr. Ivan Cargill, . ^ thet&usidii; director ; and Mr. Harry .Monk-r - house, the Vpopnlar comedian. But on tho ; face of it, these ventures are such that no practical man would touch with a 10 foot- - ♦. pole., In the first place, the Moore and, J. Burgess Minstrels have been on show- for many years and people have begun , to tire of the 1 ^ entertainment, for the variety in this kind1 of . ?;? business is about, the same as iff to bo fonnd in -/ i.. sheep or grasses. Bat on the ground that // they never appeared out . of London,' all tho ?. country cousins went to see the 'show when they 'came to town for their holidays, and it ifc is not likely that these good people will conj irA tinue to patronize the London show when a - , -Z: duplicate entertainment is provided for them' [ in their, own towns. Of coarse the. canny ?? ? J vendors said nothing abont organising a pro- ??.. vincial troupe, when they, offered the .shares in the Loudon compauy for subscription, and . *-£ in this way the public has been duped.' The London press have made a very scathing on-. ? slaught upon the promoters of these, couojfc? ^ during the present week, and, as will be seen ?? ^ from the above description, their attacks have' not been without reason. In conclusion I may I ' add that Mr! G. W. Moore is one of the most . / popular 'comedians in London,' and ! he' has ® , been the main 'draw' of the Moore and Burgess r entertainment.' ; 1 Within ' him the j -. va show will be as, hollow as ,'a performance of' ^3 ' Hamlet' minus the Thane of Denmark. - The boxing kanmiroo is still a big draw at '*1^ tho Aquarium and Professor Laudennan is . ^ making a pot of money out of jthe entertain ment, bnt'hexworka'hafd enough/for his ^ success. A newspaper man' met Mr. Lander- z- 'S man the other day; and he' tells us - that the ? ' ' boxing man' was looking very much dis figured as the result of his daily ' combats. ' c The reporter describes a short conversation ?* he had with the Professor, and from the, - following? remarks you will .perceive that' boxing a kangaroo is not all beer and skittles.' Ji ' Your kangaroo bite hard, then f* I said. ^ ' Rather,' replied Landerman, very seriously. -*-: ' You see 'Jack* can get. very littie exercise - ® —in fact, the only exercise he . gets, is his v ' ~ 1 scrap' with me ; and a kangaroo, like every* - body else who has few opportunities of getting ont, is inclined to make the most of : ''v*[ bis chances when he tastes freedom for the moment.

In fact , I:may - ultimately have to use the big feather-bed t gloves that beginners use. Still, 'Jack' r.w! means no hann. His affection for me grows : ? !?': every, day more and more, .bat so does his, muscle, said the professor ruefully, /gently ' stroking one of his swollen ears.' Bat tho wonderful performance of a boxing, | ? *' kangaroo has not been allowed -to go/nn* '?« Challenged, and now . at the Oxford Music ' ' Hall, a rival attraction is exhibited in the;per- : bod of a wrestling lion. The lion is named » Prince and this splendid full grown r cafirarian : * v consists largely of an immense pair of jaws and a cob at the tail end, the intervening ?'''- space being filled up with a largo quantity of ~ lion. Mr. Alicamousa is his trainer, and it : is at ' his bidding' that Prince jumps 'over - hurdles, lies down to order, fires a pistol and finally engages in a wrestling bout with his ? \ master, who throws him to the gMltd, wrenches open his hideous jaws and conBKies / -d the performance by putting his head iu the ' - lion's mouth. A crowd of people turn up : ?4 nightly to witness this novel exhibition, and a Star man has interviewed 'Mr* Alioamousa \ upon himself and his pet. : Briefly,., this is how the conversation ran : — 11 Name?' .do- \ manded the Star mail. — 'Prince.' . ' Age Vi ? ,cNearly seven years.' : Clls he a natnraSised ^ subject Born and bred in the forests of South Africa, but as he has been in England -y three or four years he is beginning . to- teel « t quite at home.' 41 Is this his first appeartmce -J as a wrestler r'—' 14 Yes.

More than this— eome 43,000 of the stamps ?a . areobsolete, so that their surface value,' which ?-;?*??. 18 *700, is only a part of their real value.

A curious piece of club law was before the ? ? courts last week, in which a man was sued for ?-| *. - - refusing to contribute towards his; own ' - ** - - maintenance. This anomaly {vWrf\ argued ' before the worthy judge, when tflj^felnuhittee of the Royal London Yatch Club,* sued VMr. ?1 - Corbett for three guineas towards' the ex A . prases of repairing : the Club house. A i special meeting had been held, which re solved that this ? sum should be exacted from ?\ ' each . member as a contribution to*'the : | . requisite , wort- Mr. Corbett and about . seventy others objected to phy — hence the ?2 ' ' action. The judge held thatthe\committee r ? could not recover, because the*- smb. and w . everything : belonging to it— ihclndhig ali ? ? ? subscriptions and other moneys-^- was the v property* of the members. This bring so; ?Z: ? . . each man was a part-proprietor, and to grant d the contention of the committee would be to iv . : make Mr. Corbett sue himself for. what would be his own property, .. A proprietary H club would, of course, be different, but in the present case the place belonged to members. \ The' law books contamed'novtansibn, on the \- - point, but the judge's mind on the subject, althongh he gave leave to ' appeal. i - The case reminds mo. of the oTd lady ina 3 country union, who bad been born in tbe onion and bad lived there, till the age of 83, wtap - she . demanded a pension of the ' . authorities on the plea that she hod been in -}? -. their, employ for 83 years. ?A . - One ? of those improbably probable stones ^ *.
