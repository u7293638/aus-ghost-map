" HOW ISHALL WE DECIDE THIS QUESTION P " Now, which is the worse-to have no appetite for your dinner, or to have no dinner for your appetite ? There are lots of people on the one side or the other of this questlon. When" good digestion waits on appetite and health on both," that is the ideal attitude of a person towards his meals. But most of us are not blessed in that way; we either have two much food without an appetite, or a vigorous appetite without enough to satisfy it. Different folk will answer th:s question differently, yet the common sensa of it is that, within reasonable limits, it is bet'er to have an appetite without a dinner, because, short of tue starration line, a hungry man is a healthy man; whoreas a man who ought to eat and doesn't feel like eating, stands in need of " alterations and repairs." To illustrate. We recently receivod a comunication in which the writer says, " I wes afraid to eat." Did he fancy his food was poisoned, or did his nature rebel agains; the nourishment lived on ? If the latter, why ? Let him clear the mystery himself. He says, "In the year 1889 I changed my work from railway porter to signalman. I had been signalman twelve months, and then all at once, so to speak I did not feel myself. My mouth tasted bad, so that ordinary articles of diet seemed to lose their flavour; the palate, to put it in that way, appeared to have nothing to Eay to them One thing was like another, and none was good. My tongue was coated and furred, with a dark line down the middle and yellow fur round it. My breath was offensive and my appetite poor, with pains through the chest and shoulders, which were always right before I had eaten any thing. Then I was greatly troubled with wind. It would gather so it felt like a ball in my throat, and act as if it would choke me." We cannot wonder that under these circumstances our friend failed to do justice to his meals. He adds that there was what he calls "a pricking sensation" at his heart, as though it were touched with some sharp instrument. Then, again, at times he was attacked with spasms, the agony of which was so severe that the sweat ro:led off him. "I dreaded," he rays, "the thought of eating, and many a scanty meal have I made, for I was afraid to eat. " After a time I got into a low, weak, nervous condition, and felt miserable, ss if something was going to happen, and this caused me to lose a good deal of sleep." What he means by the fear of " some thing going to happen" is, of course, the fear of some calamity, such as the lose of his position, his own death, or the death of somebody dear to him. This was due, as he intimates, to the impoverished state of his blood (the life bearer), his unstrung nerves, and to the brain enfeebled by lack of nourishment. The night of this form of illness is always full of ghosts and goblins, the creature of a restless and ungoverned imagination. "With great difficulty," he says, "jI etuck to my work, for I had a wife and family depending on me. Sq I struggled on, but what I suffered for over two years is past my powers of description. I am sure no one has suffered so much as I have done." In the latter statement he is undoubtedly wrong. One's own pain is one's own, and is always harder to bear than one's notion of his neighbours pain. There is a countless multitude who are all the while going through the same wretched experience,only we don't happen to come in touch with them. Well, the writer finally mentions that after all medical treatment had left him where it found him, he chanced to read in a book of a caso exactly like his otwn having been cured by Mother Seigel's Syrup. " My wife," he says, "got me a bottle at Mr Langstaff's, in Woodlesfoad, and after using its contents the ailment leIt me and has never returned since that fortunate day. I should like the whole world to know what it did for me. I have been employed by the Midland Railway company for cloven years.
