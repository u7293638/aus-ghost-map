''Wish' 'you. would stick to your crutches, ?'? and - not throw- me' down,' Bmarled Jimmyi' In his excitement,'; the cripple was ' performing ' some curious antics with -his loose leg and arm. ?' j ':'. The street was full of eager sight-seers running down to the church to view, the^ bride and the white horses, but as usual, moat nf,them were women and girls. J . ?; 'The* ;;Lord have, mercy on, her,:, gasped a littlo old hump backed woman, with, a stick in her hand. 'It's little you; young girls know what's. afore you when you marries'.'-' .'I didn't have two -white, horses, 'tis true, but I i had a 'gay weddin', and the whole country ''side there;' an1 I reared ten sbris; I buried three, an' no* liare a one have 1 to give* me a ha'porth.' ; ' Don't be a talkin', old woman,' said a tall old man, with the corners of Iub mouth sulkily turned down. ' Sure, Bhe has a good home to go te, what more can any raysonable woman want?' ; ' An' a fine handsome yoiing husband to take her there,' giggled a flighty. look- ing young nursemaid. ' People who ought to know,' said a tall old woman, with a hard old mouth, ' tell: me 'the bride was forced into the match, but I don't believe that ; girls are not so unwillin' to go to a good home in a carriage and , pair. .Pour old Peggy '11 have; to .give up setting he cap at old Murpby now ; she's been Jtryin' that jon -these' many years,' arid 'the hard old face broke into a harsh old laugh. - ! The bride swept in on her father's arm, and took her place in her shimmering satin gown at the altar ; the bridegroom, resplendent in blaok frock coat, with the fateful ring plainly visible in his hand took his place by her 'side, ' .

As the priest raised his voice and said — ' If any persons have aughtcto^tiay^ why this:Dian and this woman should not lie joine'd ^together in hply ,.Wdl6ok, let them': speak; nowvror ,for. 'eyet, hold their peace ;' the silence was^brfike'n^ by1; ihe heavy tramp of a horBe at' f uUgallop corn- down the Scotch Church hill.'-; The horse man would not spare time to go round the churchyard to the gate, but encouraging his horse with a shout, jumped, it over the hedge, thus cutting off a corner, gal loped up to the church door,, sprang off his horse, and hurriedly entered/ the church. He had an ugly stubbly beard* on his chin, Mb clothes were all torn,'rag- ged and dirty, beyond all redemption by water or needle. Beside that gaily clothed party he looked 'doubly disreputable. He pushed rudely aside every one in his way, . and strode up to the altar, creating a great sensation among the audience, but having their backs to him the wedding party saw nothing of all this. As the priest paused after asking that question, Tom Rttynor — for it was he who came in suoh beggarly guiBe — came foi ward and said — 'I forbid the banns !' His reasons were unheard, for a wild hysterical scream broke from Lucy's pale lips when she heard his voice, then she fainted and fell heavily to the floor, Btf iking her head against the altar railing. It seemed impomiblo to revive her. ''Oh, ? you scoundrel,' said ,:Lacy, 'you've killed my child.' f ,... .' If. I .was a youngeriraan,' .said Mur phy, shaking, his fist in Tom. Raynor's face, 'I'd knock the two eyes out of ye; I'd — I'd have your blood !'? ;-; r( 'Hush,' said the priest; 'take her out some of you, and stop Buch unseemly words in this holy place'.' i !'.. Tom Raynor,1 in- his dirty ragged raiment, quickly lifted in his arms the [unconscious girl, dressed in her long 'sweeping, shining robes, and carried her outside. ' So intent had he been trying to revive her that' he heard' none of Mur phy's words. i Half an hour, an hour passed, still Lucy lay as dead. She was carried to the priest's hpiise cIobq at hand and a doctor sent for, who at last brought back partialjiConaoiouanoBS and ordered her to be taken home and carefully kept from all excitement. ?:,.(;; : '.

' Come away and get the lad something to eat.' Thus leaving Lucy and Tom alone, he rose, bent over her, ' Luoy, you have never yet admitted you loved me.' Lucy looked up with a return of the merry look she had a few short months ago, but which had been banished lately, and smilingly answered, 'Not in so many words perhaps but facts are stubborn things.' 'And you do love me 1' ''Aye, thou poor ghost,' as Locke Richardson says.'
