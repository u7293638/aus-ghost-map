A GHOSTLY STORY. A donkey dressed in garb of white, With little brains to boast, Went forth one pitch dark night last week To play the goblin ghost. Yes, reader, you may well suppose It was a ghastly sight To see this ass in form of man Dressed in those robes of white. To meet two boozois on the way And cure them of their error, This ghostly form went forth that night To:fill.their hearts with terror. And as the boozers homeward came The ghastly ghost appeared; But, alas, that night they sober were, And only laughed and jeered. Completely sold, the ghost went home, And I trust from that night hence He'll cast his donkey freaks aside And try to learn some sense. May 7th, 1886.
