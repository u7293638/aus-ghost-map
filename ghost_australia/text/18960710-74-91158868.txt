JPARLIAMENT. THURSDAY, JULY 9. (FROM OUR SPECIAL REPORTER.) (BY TELEGRAPH.) HIOUSE OF ASSEIMBLY. The SPEAKER (hon. B. S. Bird) took the chair at 7.30 p.m. WOMEN SUFFRAGE. Mr. W. T. BROWN presented a peti tion from ratepayers at Campbell Town, praying that the right to vote for mem bers of the House of Assembly be ex tended to all persons over 21 years of age. The petition was received. THE "GHOST." Mr. CROWTHER asked if the Government intend taking any steps to discover the party or parties who are causing fear to the youthful population by playing "ghost," ordinary means having failed. The PREMIER, for the Attorney General, said the matter was under the cognisance of the Hobart police and the Municipal Council of Hobart. ADDRESS-IN-REPLY. The SPEAKER reported the presen tation of the address-in-reply to his Excellency the Governor, and that his Excellency had been pleased to receive the same. THE AGENT-GENERAL. PROBABLE RETIREMENT. The PREMIER desired to make a statement in connection with rumor s having reference to tihe Agent-General. H-e regretted to say that a cablegram had been received from Sir Robert Her bert indicating the probability of his retiring from office after October 1 next. Sir Andrew Clark had taken up tie business of the office from July 1. It hlad been known for sonime time that the health of the Agent-General was not such as his friends could desire, and for somne time past he had discharged the duties of his office more for the love of the work than for any other reason, and at great per sonal sacrifice. His services were so valuable to the colony that he yet hoped his health would permit him to con tinue in office after October 1. He could not say anything would be distinctly settled until he received the letter from Sir Robert which he had written. ani until he had discussed the matter with u.s colleagues. PAPERS TABLED. The TREASURER tabled a number of financial papers, which were ordered to be printed. FINANCIAL STATEMENT. The TREASUJRER then delivered the fintacial statement, as follows: Mr. Speakler, It is my intention, before concluding my statement, to move for supply in accordance with the message you have just read; but, that honourable members may give intelli gent consideration to the expenditure necessary for the coming year, I will pro ceed to place before them a brief state ment of the leading figures by which Minis ters justify their full confidence that the supply is necessary and adequate, and the present revenue sufficient to make good the supply. It will be my privilege again, upon this the sixth occasion of my presenting an an nual budget, to deal for the fifth time with surpluses of annual revenue, a feature that recalls those hopeful prospects which characterised the position of the country and the pursuits and commerce of the people in 1873-4-5, the former years of my Treasurership, and again in 1895 and 1896, and that fulfilment of hope which has on those occasions rewarded the confidence of Treasurers. It is, I trust, with pardonable pride that I can point now to the realisation of the anticipations (called "dreams" by some) which I presented to this House on the 27th June last. I then spoke of "features more than hopeful," "a promise of better things," "the satisfaction and sufficiency"--then ex pected; "signs of abundance," "the three years of financial famine, 1892-3-4, suc ceeded by years of plenty." I can now speak of these auguries as largely realised, or making for realisation. The revenue is steadily rising; increased Customs duties give proof of the improving condition of the people; postal and telegra phic services are in greater demand; im provement in our territorial revenue gives an assurance of increased activity; while the largely increased tonnage passing over our railways is a record of harvests won. The year has been a good one for the far mers, who sorely needed it, and the lines of ipastoralists also have fallen in pleasant places. A 30 per cent. rise in wool prices has taken place; wheat has yielded an im proved average quantity per acre and a phenomenal price; money has cheapened; foreign capital is freely invested in Tas manian undertakings and stocks; the min eral output is increasing, and the value of metals has hardened; free markets are open to us in the Australian continent; in vestment stocks have recovered value; trade is healthy; exports are well main tained; banking operations are sounder; rents are cheaper; exploitation of the mag nificent reserves of the colony proceeds with greater application and efficiency; and the Government has practised economy. We promised all that last year, but the promise fell unheeded upon unbelieving ears; Nothing more is wanting to complete the record of that forward movement but a word of congratulation to our North-West Coast friends that foreign trade has been opened at Devonport by the departure of the Franz with Tasmanian produce for Europe, and upon their important and much enlarged trade with the free markets of Now South Wales. During the past five months the exports for 1896 compared with 1895 give the fol lowing most satisfactory comparison: 1895\. 1896. 5 months. 6 months. £. £. Jam ..................... 7,000 11,100 Oats .................... 10,000 18,000 Potatoes ............... 27,000 68,000 Hops .................. 12,500 18,700 Malt ..................... 400 2,100 Hides and skins ....... 6,400 9,200 Wool ..................... 1 90,000 149,000 Hay, straw, and chaff .. 1,700 15,000 Timber ................. 12,800 13,800 Eucalyptus oil .......... 1,300 1,800 £169,100 £307,100 The Franz cargo of Tasmanian produce of £5060 value consisted of hardwood, blackwood, and myrtle, also of barley, but mainly of peas, at the export value of 2s 8d per bushel. Six steamers, with a mea surement of 5500 tons, have been kept in the trade for months, and have already car ried away agricultural produce of the export value of £85,000--a part only of the crop and it is anticipated a similar tonnage will be engaged in the export trade until the end of October. Thus, and by other .evidence, we find that agricultural interests have rallied. Againi-n this very limited community are we experiencing the value of returing con fidence. Similar experiences to ours are causes for congratulation in the United Kingdom, where the Chancellor of the Ex chequer reads in the six millions of surplus revenue the rising prosperity of the people and improved trade, and in Ncw South Wales, Queensland, and Now Zealand, whcere revenues are again productive of sur pluses. Assuming such statements to be warran ted, we do not think you will be surprised that the revenue of three consecutive years in Tasmania produces surlpluses, and gives ample justification for the belief that a further five per cent. addition to revenue will bring us within a measurable and con tracted distanceofproviding for theaccumu lated deficiency in revenue acccounts. In asking theattentioncfhcnouraiblenImem- bers to the financial operations of the past, present, and coming year, I shall not have occasion to dwell upon the narrowed ex ipenditure unider which the Government is, I believe, satisfactorily carried on. We have established a cost of administration commensurate with our altered circum stances, and, while still intent upon re ducing our expenditure whenever possible, it is satisfactory to know that the position is no longer acutely embarrassing. The comparative statement of appropria tion and expenditure for the year 1894 showed E867,.877 explended below and only .cr]0 above the estimates, and for 1895 £e55,230 and £0835 respectively, both of which records must be highly satisfactory. 1895. The year 1895 has financially been most encounragingg. The revenue was re-estimated on Jiule 25 last at £757,830, but produced £761,970 |8s bid: the exi)elnitllre sac thlen esti maltedi at £753.,39, but was reduced to £748.94.t 's ;d: prcd:!:cing, instc; of a surplus estimnated at £3091, an actual sur pluls of £13,024 15s. Thile Customs revenue of 1894, £281,9.i5, rose in 1895 to £304,361. Territorial ditto, £17.567, ditto £58,079. Railways ditto, £141,198, ditto £152,717. In Customs the chief increases were Spirits ............ ... £1400 Tobacco..................... 6300 Cigars and cigarettes........ 1700 Doots ....................... 1000 Drapery .................... 8000 Dried fruits ................. 1300 Hardware ................... 1100 Machinery .................. 1700 Sugar ....................... 6700 Tea ........................ 1100 Timber ..................... 1500 While the following produced less revenue by the amounts stated: Cattle ....................... £2200 Coal ......................... 400 W heat ...................... 1800 Sheep ....................... 500 The increases and decreases are alike satisfactory, the for'::er obviously because of the improcved revenue derived from quicklened prlosplerity, and the latter as indi catig larger home production. It is a s?arange lonllilent 1upon productive duties that, in spite of the duty raised in 1894 to 40s onil cattle anld 2s on sheep, we are consuming locally fed meat at a lower price than has ruled for years. There were imported duty free Horned cattle. Sheep.

Fluctuations of imports have been important, and the largest number of cattle imported in the past 20 years was that of 1891, viz., 4720, and of 1892, 3981, in face of the protective duties. We may conclude that the duty has given revenue, but not better prices to the home producer. On the other hand, the consumption of tea increased on a 30 duty far beyond the pro portion due to. increasing population; and the interesting'experience found associated with that article is repeated in the history of kerosene oil, which, with the higher duty of Is per gallon abandoned for the lower duty of 6d, has a largely increased consumption. The duty was reduced from Is to 6d per gallon on and from January 1, 1893\. Mark the result disclosed by the following figures: Oils pro. 0u 780 7"1'90 10,,500 duced 11,900011,200 7700 7800 8701 980010,100 Ats duty of, per { 1 gallon i1s d Gd l d d SEstimated on five months' collentions. Again, the increased consumption of tea on a 3d duty in 1895 as compared with a Gd duty in 1892 is shown by the relative figures of 978,0001b. and 790,0001b. Further comment is needless. The growth of outports is marked by the following revenue collected by the Customs, comparing 1892 with 1895: Strahan ........ £5,090.... £10,360 Devonport ..... 10,650.... 10,950 Ulverstone ..... 800.... 850 Stanley ........ 1,600.... 1,700 While Burnie registers a decline from £5900 to £3800, owing to projected ven tures at the Whyte River and Heazlewood not since profitably pursued. There is an annual falling off of bond rents (steam communication being the cause), but such a loss of public revenue means a compensating trade profit. Excise.-Beer is making the return esti mated for the year, and the rate of 4d per gallon may apparently be relied upon with much regularity to produce £18,500 per annum. Cigarettes and cigars, the duty on which fell from £7027.in 1890 to £3903 in 1894, are now yielding an amount which shows a satisfactory approach to former duty col lected. The excise law of 1895 is effecting its purpose as a check, and this, together with increased vigilance in regard to smuggling, have produced for that year £5600, with a re-estimate for 1896 of £7000. The land tax, again, well maintains revenue expectations, the reduced valua tions not being so important as many ex pected. £38,000 as the product of one half penny after rebate upon mortgages is a well-supported estimate. The assessments of values have declined one million and a half; being 1894\. 1895. 1896. £20,734 £19,546,000 £19,105,000 The territorial revenue increase is mainly due to rentals of mineral lands--£14500, and of .Crown lands-£1500. Coming now to the current year 1896, the revenue has so far pro gressed satisfactorily :-Customs yield ed, in 1895, £304,364; may be re estimated for 1896, £323,000. Land, in come and companies tax, £98,697; ditto, £77,100. Inland revenue, ditto, £112,299;, ditto, £125,290. Territorial ditto, £58,097; ditto, £61,650. Railways, ditto, £152,717: ditto, £152,000. The chief increase in Customs warranted by the actual collections so far in 1896, compared with 1895 being, on Spirits ..................... £1500 Sugar ...................... 1000 Oils ........................ 1000 Stationery ................... 500 'Hardware, ironmongery, etc. 2000 Drapery ................... . .. 000 Earthenware ................ 700 Other goods ................ 5700 And our experiences of 1895 are repeated this year with coal, which will be less productive by £1500, and sheep and cattle by £1000. Land, Income, and Companies Taxes. The separate collections are set forth in papers distributed. They must be dealth with as one collection for purposes of this explanation. The estimate of June 25, 18S6, from land was the smaller amount, and from the income tax the larger, owing to the latter including an inhabited house tax and a tax on certain structural im provements. Irrespective of the disturbance of estimated revenue by the retention of the existing land tax, I must own to some disappointment that incomes have not yielded yet what might reasonably have been expected. The yield of tax for 1995 is not more satisfactorj- than for 1894, and for a scond time book debts of former years have, I fear, done duty in narrowing at least partially the incomes admitted; but trade commenced to inmprove last year, and the conmmissioner is getting upon more certain ground, warranting confidence that at existing rates tile annuial amount to be relied upon is £35,000 or more, towards which improvement the amended act of last year will contribute. The assessments for 1894 and 1895 are worthy of the attention of honourable mlembers: 1894 1895. Persons assessed, No... £2,3)99 2,145 Amount assessed...... 728,627 713,723 Tax yielded........... 31,058 29,93.1 Of two hundred pIrofessional men, only one hundred and twenty are assessed, and fifty of those are clergymen. There are professions and pursuits insufficiently assessed, and the most searching enquiry will be necessary if these are to be ade cquately reached. The returns are unsatis factory, aind cause regret that the licensing system, as applied to certain professions and pursuits, was not adopted when pro posed by you, sir, in 1887, when I had the pleasure of being your colleague in another place. A license to brokers, for example. would purify the ranks of a responsible class, and would probably be more popular generally; and, extended to clergy, doctors, lawyers, commission agents, sharebrokers, civil engineers, and architects, would be more far-reaching among the 718 persons which the census returns record as follow ing those professions. We have already seen, sir, that higher duties on tea and oil are less productive than the lower rates of duty, and should be a gain Warned not to Look to Articles of Domes tic Consumption to relieve uis from the income tax. We also have evidence that the deficiency which the incomne tax is raised to cover is a wan ing quantity, and gives hope, if the tax is continued, that some relief upon the pound age rates will be practicable when we have fully suppcrted the credit of the country. But I thlink there can be no reduction of rate until then; and I beg honourable mem bers to bear in mnind that the people who have inot taxable incomes (thirty thousand out of the thirty-two thousand heads of families and other breadwinners of four teen years of age and upwards) are sharing the burden by their proportionate consump tion of dutiable goods giving Increased revenue of £22,000, £41,000, and £53,000, in the respective years 1895, 1896, and 1897, or onsiderably in excess of the revenue ci aected under the income tax. The total cost of collections is stated approxhimately at two per cent. upon the revenue yielded. Land.-The large sum of £45,000. carried forward from revenue on land and income taxes due in 1894, caused the collections for 1895 to be exceedingly high, but the com parison of that year's total with the amount now re-estimated for 1896 is not otherwise significant. Inland Revenue.-While for the last year all contributing items well maintained the estimates, in this year important progress can be reported, the most important items in excess being post (£9500) and telegraph (£3300). This excess in the telegraph re turns is due to expansion of traffic on the lines arising from improved trade and largely increased number of mining mes sages. There is a close alliance between the rise and fall of both services, and there is an element of new business deve loping. I have not altered the estimate of pro bate duty (£5000), although gauged by the collections of the first six months a con siderable deficiency may be expected. We are accustomed to find on an average of years that the estimate is less than the actual realisation. The average receipts for the past ten years have been £5300 per annum, and if not maintained for 1890 this will probably be exceeded next year. Territorial revenue increase is again due to mineral rents and land sales. Railways, although re-estimated for 1896 at £717 less than revenue collected in 1895, appear from the returns to date likely to carry an increased number of passengers, a very large excess of tonnage, and to break the.record of percentage of profit after pay ing all working expenses. The revenue to end of June is £779 in excess of that collected in the correspon ding six months of 1895. The effect of these changes on the year 1896 in Customs, inland, territorial, and railways will be to produce between the revenue, now re-estimated at............ £768,790 And expenditure voted............ 743,655 A surplus on the year 1896 of..... £25,135 Thus the surpluses of the years 1895 and 1896 will amount in all probability to £38,159 as compared with the deficiency on both years disclosed by the explanatory statement of June last, if we disallow the transfer then proposed from the assur ance fund of the Real Property Act,£10,414 16s 7d. We do not press for the transfer now : it may more appropriately be handed over to the commissioners of the sinking fund in reduction of the debt. 1897. The satisfactory outcome of the years 1895 and 1896 now reviewed will also be found repeated in our accounts for the coming year 1897. The revenue Is estimated to yield.. £786,010 And we intend to keep the expendi ture within..................... 751,802 and thereby secure the third surplus in three consecutive years of which I have previously spoken. These figures are so closely allied with those of 1896, and are so evidently justified thereby, that I need not detain honourable members with a dissection of them. The expectations from Customs are, however, specially noteworthy as increasing in three years £22,000, plus £19,000, plus £12,000, with ample reasons to justify even better results. Figures, Mr. Speaker, are said to be very dry, but the succession of surprises of which they are this night the cause have, I trust, made them unusually interesting and palatable. Mr. Speaker, trustworthy as we have proved to be in finance, our promises to re duce the expenditure. redeemed, the esti mates of revenue verified, and surpluses restored, we appeal to honourable members to help us to be equally trustworthy to re deem the promises which we have made, ani to enforce the principles espoused by so large a majority in this Chamber--the principle of Taxation Upon the Unimproved Capital Value of Land at one half-penny in the pound, in exchange for the like tax upon the assessment of the real esate. In 1894 we carried through this House a Re-assessment Bill framed with a view to establish a basis for land taxation upon principles which we again recommend. Its r'ejection elsewhere delayed the purpose. In 1895 we made a second attempt, and have pleasing recollections of the large sup port thle principle received, but were again disappointed by an irreconcilable second Chamber. Justice to the cause-duty to ourselves respect for our pledges-alike combine in urging us to persevere. We are not obli vious to the growing regard for uniform taxation upon wealth in all forms, nor of the many justifiable reasons for its advo cacy, nor of the measure of equity it should seculc. In 1887, and again in 1888, I had charge elsewhere of the Wealth Tax Bill, which my colleagues, associated with you, sir, suc cessfully carried in this Chamber; but, al though it was baited with an extra 3d per lb. duty on tea (the only food then acceptable elsewhere), our policy was defeated. The rejection of the proposals of 1887 and 1888 left the income tax the only alternative for overtaking an increasing deficiency in the revenue, and forced Parliament to adopt it or repudiate our liabilities; but if it is to continue, justice requires that the land tax which accompanies it should be levied upon the unimproved value of the land. At the piresent time capital invested in improve ments upon land is treated quite differently from capital invested in any other way, and is made to pay a tax whether it yields profit or not. Taxation of the unimproved value of land has commanded the attention and secured majorities of this Chamber for two consecu tive sessions, and has become the continu ous policy which must succeed if we perse vere. Temptations to tentative fiscal re forms may be great, but while we vaccil late another Chamber is firm. Only after a principle has become deep-rooted here, and is accepted by the people, can we com mand its adoption. Only by unbroken ranks here and persistent purpose canl we hope ultimately to succeed, and satisfy the people that their mandate is respected, It is con flrmed by their approval. Members here amnd elsewhere have been returned as sup porters of it, and now upon this, the third time of asking Parliament, we claim that ther is no lawful impediment, and if any forbid the banns the people must decide. For how long is legislation to halt between two opinions? Are we solemnly as a party to piledge ourselves to a policy, and, suc ceeding here time after time, to abandon the people and the interests which they have trustfully committed to our charge, because our efforts are checked? Ministers thinkc not, and believe that the time is op portune to force a settlement. By this Par liament the purpose was adopted-by it must the acceptance be, or another Par liament be elected to deal with it. New South Wales has adopted taxation of one ienny upon unimproved value of lands, inll association with anl income tax, finding in it an equitable and judicious means whereby they are enabled to aban don Customs revenue to the amount of one million sterling. With this system we are abreast of the times; but as to the uniform tax upon all forms of wealth we accepted defeat of this measure here, and its aban donment by New Zealand will be a difficult fact against which to battle. We can now point to no British community that bears this new form of impost, and Canada, as well as New Zealand, may be referred to as countries that have adopted and aban doned it. Taxation on the unimproved value of land, accepted by New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, and Queensland, is likely to be commended as a federal revenue should the Federal Parliament be empowered to raise income by other means than Customs duties. The attention of Parliament will there fore be asked to a bill having for its ob ject the re-assessment of the lands of the colony. The large economy which the country has sanctioned in the Post and Telegraph services has enabled the department to overtake their cost. After due allowance for revenue stamps collected by the Postal Department, probably £8000 a year, the losses in 1893 and again in 1894 were £17,000 in each year; that loss was reduced in 1895 to £8000, and will be converted into a sur plus for 1896 of £6150, and for 1897 we may hope to realise a surplus of £9000. In submitting the estimates of expcndi ture in committee of supply we hope to justify every change, and to find them in harmony with the expressed purpose of Parliament to take advantage of the earliest oppportune occasion to respect the pro mises of Ministers to many civil servants. Merited promotions have so far been recog nised by title only. Our circumstances will now warrant instalments of practical recognition by annual increments. By reorganlsation and redistribution of duties the salaries saved are equal to the increases given, except in the important service estimate of Post and Telegraphs De partment, where £1200 for extra staff is found necessary. Otherwise, the excess of £8000 in 1897 estimates over the Appropria tion Act of 1896 arises from larger reserves from land fund, increased provision for railway service, diamond drills, defence, and for land assessments-the excess caused by such provision being partly met by contraction of interest to the amount of £2700. VWe have how advanced sufficiently far to consider the Accumulated Deficiencies. A succession of surpluses on revenue ac count which average over £35,000 for each of four consecutive years, 1880, 1881, 1882. and 1883, gave rise to a laudable desire to reduce the taxation of the people, but it was accompanied by a disregard for the ever swelling interest account, caused by expenditure on public works then annually projected, and resulted in a legacy of debt every Administration since has had to grapple with, and has been followed by a period of adversity, which nothing short of prescience could have foreseen. The ac cumulations of prosperous years disap peared in the following years of shortage, and we find at the end of 1889 an accumu lated deficiency of £167,469; during 1890 and 1891 this was reduced to £101,507, but in 1892 it grew by the amount of £132,378; in 1893 it grew further by the amount of £128,232; and in 1894 it further grew by the amount of £93,010; the accounts at the end of that year disclosing a total defi ciency of £455,127. That has been the great cause of our anxiety, but we are now able to attack it vigorously. The Explanatory Balance-Sheet, 1895-6-7, now in the hands of honourable members, shows provision for a reduction of theimount by £72,907. It is a great relief that no new burdens on the people are necessary. We may breathe freely again, and the troubled soul of the taxpayer may be at rest. Expenditure at all costs must be minimised, and yearly surpluses secured. From the smitten con dition in which all interests for a time lay we have risen, and are marking the estab lishment of an altered condition of our f nances, now again adequate for all needs. The local exchequer has been through the samne ordeal before. Between 1879 and 1881 a deficiency of ;£109,342 was paid off, and this was effected prior to the developed railways and road systems: we now enjoy a population then of 118,000, against 164,000 now,and a revenue in 1879 of £373,494, com pared with our annual ways and means now of £T169,000. The deficiency, and our ability to meeli it in 1896, are not disproportionate to the circumstances and position of 1879; and a little patience with the income tax, and re turn to the Customs revenue of £376,130 for 1891 will relieve us from the incubus more promptly than we expect, and without embarrasslng land, wealth, or the people. Returning confidence in land values is not misplaced. The improvement which in June, 1895, we saw coming, is accelerated by pastoral, agricultural, and mineral prospects, and land need not fear Treasury exigencies. Australasian Credit. The world has witnessed the spirited efforts made by the seven Australasian co lonies to retrieve disaster. Tasmania has, unfortunately, had her share of the trouble, but all are showing a bold front and grapD pling masterfully with the sad legacy. Australasian credit has been elevated there by to the highest national order, ranking with the strongest Governments of Euirope, and surpassing the United States. The credits of Governments are relative as the following figures: £ s. d. United Kingdom, 2% consols until 1903, and then 2%, give an effec tive rate of interest of ........ 2 2 0 United States Government stocks. 3 0 0 Germany ........................ 3 1 3 All Australasia ................... 2 18 6 Tasmania ........................ 2 16 0 A most satisfactory position in the group for Tasmania. Six million sterling was the rise in Aus tralasian Government securities recorded in my June statement of 1895. A further rise has since taken place representing an other twelve millions and a half sterling, for which estimate I am indebted to the editor of the "Insurance and Banking Re cord." The lowest quotations were in May, 1893, for 3% per cent. :-Tasmania, 84; South Australia, 851 ; New South Wales, 83% ; Queensland, 75; New Zealand, 90; Victoria, 79. The last transactions are: Tasmania, 110%; South Australia, 111; New South Wales, 109¾; Queensland, 109%; New Zealand, 1009'; Victoria, 107%. Since my last statement three per cent. stock has been floated by-West Australia, at £100 16s Sd; South Australia, £97 4s lid; New South Wales, £96 1Ss 3d;New Zealand, £94 8s 9d; and are now quoted at-South Aus tralia, £102 5s; New South Wales,£102 10s; New Zealand, £103. The "over- confiding'' public, blamed for lending to us too freely, is again in the field, buying Victorian 3?% stock now at 1071, which they spurned in May, 1893, at 79! This appreciation of Government stocks is variously accounted for. and many of the causes are as apparent as the effect. One authority informs us that timid investors demand high class stocks, that there has been a decline in loan value of money and a diminution of supply consequent upon the reduction of the national debt by 190 millions in thie last 39 years (of which b milieuons were in the last 11 years), and con temporaneously therewith the investments by post office savings banks and other Gov ernment departments, which hold now one third of the total debt as against one-fourth of it eleven years ago, thus narrowing the absorptions of investments by the pub lic to about £400,000,000, in the face of the fact that the annual conversion of income into capital createsanewannual demandfor in vestments to the amount of £180,000,000. Our satisfaction arises from Australasia being among the "high class stock de manded by timid investors." Imperial consols 2% per cent., reduced after 1893 to 21% per cent., and redeemable at par in 1923, quoted at 110 in April last, give, with the prospective reduction of rate and re demption at par, an effective value of E2 2s per cent. per annum, against effective value in May, 1896, for Australasian stooks, 3.011 per cent., and for Tasmania, 2.957 per cent. These combinations of causes may well be termed "embarrassing;" but these are not wanting signs that the position is "temporary," and if advantage can be taken of it, action should be prompt. The time appears to be opportune for the Conversion of our Debt upon better terms than 3% per cent. In closing my statement of May 16, 1894, I said there was a sunny side of our troubles-that common interests and com mon dangers remind us that "unity is strength," and, ultimately, as the result of recognising common brotherhood, there will come the consolidation of all Aus tralasian loans floated as a federal debt at a reduced rate of interest. Again, on June 27, 1895, I reminded honourable mem bers of the purpose, exposed to them the very serious extravagance of Australasian finance in London, and expressed the opinion that the greater part of such charges should cease when federated Aus tralasian finance will have its representa tivo established in London, and we shall be nearer that felicitous period when a fur ther reduction of a half per cent. per an num upon the cost of our debt may be pos sible, and a saving be effected to Austral asia of one million sterling per annum. Now these forecasts are taking form, and I wish honourable members to know what we are attempting to do. But I would first express my thanks to the Government Statistician for most valuable help. He has prepared the tables upon which I have acted: they are distributed this evening. The following memorandum addressed by me to the honourable the Premier for transmission to the Agent- General and to the Governments of Australasia will, I hope, fully and clearly state the case. "Treasury, Hobart, June 5, 1896. "Memorandum. "Mly mind has long been exercised upon the necessity for innovations and reform of our system of finance in London. In February, 1895, you will remember the Federal Council of Australasia carried, at my instance, the following resolution: 'That this Council desires to represent to. the Governments of Australasia that more: economical finance may be secured by jointly, or by some federal authority, in viting subscriptions to and undertaking.the: management of future loans.' I have not followed up the purpose therein expressed, because hoping for an early development of federal government for these colonies, The time, however, seems now opportune for some movement, and waiting the unifica tion of the debts of all the colonies as; Australasian federal consols, which may be more remote than we hope for; may lose the advantages for conversion of our' Tasmanian debt which the plethora of' capital now offer. Herewith will be found tables, prepared by the Government Statis tician, from which it appears that conver sion to three per cent. can be effected upon the market quotations of May 27, 18968, of Tasmnanian stock at a capital cost of £887,884, and effecting an annual saying of interest between the average* face rate of interest now paid of 3.824 per cent. and a conversion rate of 3 per cent., which gives £36,851, and, further, that by pro viding a sinking fund of £8062 the in creased nominal debt of £887,884 would, at 3 per cent. in fifty years, be wiped off, and the transaction give a net immediate annual saving of interest of £28,789. A table also supplies, as the result of valuatlons ol the capital sums invested at market prices, May 27, 1896, that 2% per cent. Imperial consols at £112 5s give a net effective rate of interest to investors of £2 5s per cent., and that for the seven Australasian colo nies, now paying on faced rates of 3, 3%, and 4 per cent., the valuation, at shortest optional redemption periods, gives a net effectiye rate of 2.957. The equivalent imC mediate saving on Australasian debt of £210,538,117 would amount to £1,015,00. I have also prepared a statement of charges pai4 la connectlon with flotations of loans, and London management of Aust~a?l~a Sfit?h'es,wh'ih exposeS 'itacties and agree mneol. wl4h could not be more extrava gant, and which, if contlnuled, and on the ;assomptiwn that pitcems'l the whole debt of £-200,J00,000 will be bandled during the next 30 years, will be at a losts to the ?oloniUs of £298S30 .per annum, the share of Tasmanla being, roughly, about £1.2,000 pertinum. AlthOugh the tables were made up on .a three per cent. conversion, it may be allvisable to aslmilate the rate with 24. Imperial consols. Present conversion may be under less ahvantageous circumstances pilot* to than .after the formation of an Australasian commonwealth, under which tthe entire lands of the colonies would be associated with the joint and several lguarantees of each and all of 'the colonies, and the creation of an interminable stock be of more ecsy accomplishment, but upon such points very valuable adv;ice can be ob tained through Sir Robert Herbert's agency. There is grave cause for alarm in the pre sent condition of colonial indebtedness, for, notwithstanding the Australasian volume of trade has reached £14i4,000,000 in a year and may be quoted at £120,000,000 now, or a considerable excess upon the volume of trade of Great Britain when Her Most Gracious Majesty ascended the throne, and, further, that the accumulation of private wealth in Australasia grves £309 per head of populbtion against £246 for Great Britain, and that agricultural, manufactur ing, and mining pursuits arebut in their infanicy in Australasia, these colonies may be paralysed for a time should European developments cause a crisis contemporane ously with a need by the colonies to renew even a tenth portion, or £20,000,000, of. their loans. British 'financiers will also possibly advise that 'for investment an interminable stock ?ny 'be preferred, and, possibly, with the option to colonies of re demption in 50 years. The table of costs attending our present methods of finance in London may serve as a basis upon which to found advice for remedies. I shall very much prefer that all Australasian finance be concentrated in one office in London, the agency of the Australasian commonwealth, or waiting for that, the Australasian Finance Agency; but this anticipates federal action by the probable agreement of the Australasian colonies to associate for the purposes herein set forth, as 'to which agreement no progress has yet been made, but as to which I address you separately for communication with the honourables the Premiers of other Austral asian colonies. There is, I trust, ample in this memorandum to enable the fullest en quiry by Sir Robert Herbert, and, as I hope to move in the matter during the coniing session of Parliament, I shall be glad of his prompt reply. Possibly all the 'Agents-General may be induced by Sir Robert to meet, and, after discussion, make joint representations to their Go vernments upon the subject. If the colo nies'be brought into line on such an im portant item of finance as the debt, it will "be a long step towards complete federation. It will be observed that all calctilations are made on the assumption that the stocks can be exchanged at the market value of May 27, and, therefore, the cost is placed at a maximum; but, although the 1Agures include a quarter per cent. as a bonus to induce the public to come in, there does not appear on our part any necessity to follow Mr. Goschen's lead in this respect, for, with the premium prices nbow quoted serious fluctuations of an im portant nature, if not imminent, must be expectdd, as such values cannot be regarded as permanently established, and should in doce'holders to accept converted stock at less than the capital value of existing prices at three per cent. I cannot hope that our bankers will afford to you any assist ahce, or even valuable advice: they can not look Wfth any favour upon these pro posals, anid we must be prepared for their frowns or, what may be as bad, their indifference coldly expressed. That posi tion 'has, -of course, its value, and Tas mania, if 'alone, may find it obstructive, although not permanently successful; but Australasia, if unitedly taking up the purpose, will establish investment stocks second in popularity only to Imperial consols, arid can breast all opposition. The time must come, and I think is present, for the management by our own officers of all financial matters in London, and dealing directly with the public instead of through syndicates and bankers; and the exigencies of holders of stock, and the further cause which may arise for future borrowings should keep the doors of the Inscribed Stock ¶Yfice open to the public in perpetuity, and Australasian consols be dealt in as freely and as frequently as are Imperial consols. Obviously, then, the matters for reference are: 1\. The establishment of an Australasian Federal Finance Agency, in which the Australasian Agents-General shall ex cficio be the 'managers.' 2\. The conversion and consolidation of Australasian loans at a reduced uni form rate. 2\. To report upon the purpose which is submitted, that the said Australasian Finance Agency shall undertake the flo tation, inscription, and management of loans, and all finance connected therewith. 4\. To advise upon theprobable capital sum at which investors should be invited to convert their holdings. 5\. To advise upon the preference for inter minable stodks, anti whether option to redeem in 50 years should be had by the colonies. Or; 6. Failing any concerted action by the other colon'ies, to advise separately upon the matters having regard to Tas manian interests only. "P. O. 'FYSI, Treasurer. "The hon. the Premier." When honourable members can give time to the investigation of the schedule attached to my memorandum bearing upon theproposal,they will find undercolumnA,B, and C, "Interest payable yearly on exist ing debt (A)'" set alongside that payable on conversion scheme B and conversion scheme C. Column A Ohows an annual progressive lessening of our interest bur den by the renewal at the lower rate of three per cent. interest which may be reasonably expected to rule; the full ad vantage of which will not be felt until 1926, when all our at present existing lia bilities will under such circumstances have been exchanged at the cheaper rate. 'Reading the three alternatives of pro viding a sinking fund to pay off In 18 years, or 30 years, or 50 years, the present capital cost of conversion, viz., £887,784, we'tave the following results: 6\. Continue to provide £297,600 annually for 18 years, the present amount of in terest paid, and defer until 1914, and thereafter the advantage of paying only £233,465 per annum for interest. 2\. 'Provide from now £278,757 annually for 30 years, with an immediate saving of £18,843, and defer the full advanatge until 1926 and thereafter, when the in terest will be £233,465. '. Or, adopt the alternative scheme recom mended of fifty years' sinking fund, with a reduction of the annual interest, effecting an immediate saving of £28,789 'by an annual payment reduced to £268,811, to be further reduced to £233,465 In 1947 and thereafter. Column C indicates the immediate and perpetual reduction of the present annual interest of £297,600 to £260,749. In this scheme the immediate annual saving is £36,451, but at the cost of a permanent in crease of nominal debt by £887,784. The apparent anomaly exists that whereas we immediately increase the nominal debt by £887,784, the debt of £7,788,170 is in effect contracted to £6,820,000, or by '£962,170; or representing .471 per cent. of original capital debt. The tables fully justify the. satement piade fy me last session, that a conversion to fedletra consols at three per 'cent. would speelaip effect a savlng to Australasia oi one million sterling. We hope to have oc basidll to deal with this stibject before the sesso'n is closed. In no other way does Tasitrania need to test the European. money market, for we can find locally at 3½ per cen't. or three per cent, all that is needed fdr a time for pDublic ztorks. "The operation of the Local Insf'ibed Stock. Act has been a success at 3½ per cent., and it is our purpose to ask for power to raise a half million more. Subscription of a quarter of a million authorised last ses sion was fredly made, and much disappoint ment expressed that the account is tempo rarily closed. It can be popularised, and is effective as proof that local confidence and local ability:are alike apparent. With the finance papers will be found the position df the public debt at December 31, 1895; the subsequent movements therein to June '30 last will be found by comparing therewith'the following figures: £C. Debentulres redeemable in London, less £200,000 provided for in last issue of inscribed stockl ........ 3,076,550 Inscribed stock redeemable in Lon don ........................... 4.456,500 Treasury bills ditto ............. 70,000 Debentures redeemable in Hobart. 249,420 Inscribed stock ditto ............ 250,000 Treasury bills ditto ............ 145,000 £68,247,470 The Treasury bills and local inscribed stock being in aid of revenue. The Commissioners of the Public Debts Sinking Fund report an increase of funds in the year ending June 30, 1896, of £6343. The ex tension of time granted to purchasers of Crown lands under the credit clauses of that act has temporarily interfered with the more important progress usually regis tered by that fund. The arrears on pur chases, leases, and occupation licenses amounted at the end of 1894 to £37,670, since when payments and rearrangements of terms have been effected or are being effected to the amount of £25,200, the balance being included in a list of default sales now being gazetted, which embraces amounts due to the extent of £12,470, so that the stagnant is being transformed into a liquid asset. We must extinguish our present con solidated revenue deficiency before any Treasurer can have the pleasure of advising the adoption of that salutary provision which has enabled the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom to re duce the national debt to six hundred mil lieon sterling by paying yearly surpluses of revenue to the Commissioner for the re duction of the national debt. Minerals. To all that is hopeful in other pursuits, and the handsome realisation of a bounti ful harvest, may be added rich promises for the future of our mineral areas. Metals account for one-half of our exports, and represent one-flfth part of our combined pro duction and manufacturing power. Good management and sufficiency of capital in combination have secured successes. Thus, we have the Western Silver Mining Com pany, with nothing paid up in capital, working on a poor six per cent ore, realls ing £200,000 net for ore sold, paying for plant, stores, management, and cost of mine, and distributing £50,000 dividends; Mount Bischoff Tin Mining Company, which has paid its 230th dividend; Tasmania Gold, which has paid its 142nd dividend; and the New Golden Gate, that has carried payable gold down to the lowest depth yet attained in Tasmania, and paid in dividends £117,600. Other mines have been added to the list of dividend-paying companies. With so extensive an area over which out crops of ore are continually being revealed as the country is opened, and the marvel lous development witnessed at Mount Lyell, we are not surprised that it has been esti mated that the export of metals will shortly be doubled in amount. But it is to be de precated that far too many ventures are prematurely placed in the market with pros pectuses not warranted by limited develop ments. The dividend-paying companies are not the only good properties known to exist, and the light line of railway front Zeehan to North-East Dundas district should enable many companies to establish the values of these; but the exercise of much more caution by promoters is de sirable if we are to maintain the popularity of the West Coast as a field for the invest ment of that foreign capital without which success must be much retarded. Government expenditure in the district has proved most satisfactory. The rail way opened in February, 1892, at a cost of £229,424, has yielded a profit of £8287 up to December 31, 1895, after paying interest and working expenses. Other works also have had attention-tracks, roads, streets, and sewerage--all auxiliary to the settle ment and development of that district, and carried out at a cost since 1886 a! £150,000. Those works have Jointly contributed to secure a revenue from the West Coast mineral lands of £102,297, and from miners' rights, etc., £6000, and resulted in an export of gold of the value of £135,112, and silver, £268,737, a most satisfactory outcome of enterprise in a mineral area whose development is scarcely cradled. The successful starting of smelting opera tions at Mount Lyell is the capping-stone of that marked progress which has attended the efforts of that company since November, 1895\. Wealth, then buried in a country inaccessible even for foot traffic, is now flowing from the smelting furnaces, the township of Gormanston rapidly becoming occupied with offices, villas, and houses for an industrial population, and communica tion open with the port by a line of railway of 14 miles. Such progress is a source of much congratulation to all. Imports and Exports give the following comparisons: 1894\. 1895. Imports .... £980,000 1,095,000 Exports ... 1,490,000 1,373,000 The difference in value of exports being in wool and copper pyrites from Mount Lyell, the continual export of which is only de layed. Other features of the exports are very satisfactory, farm and dairy produce figuring to a more important extent than hitherto. This unfavourable comparison of exports is immediately rectified in the figures for the first five months of 1896, which give £140,000 increased exports for that period, and promise a still further development of trade, especially with the free ports of New South Wales. The mineral exports of the current year are again increasing in value. The dimin ished weight and value of wool of 1895 ex ports are fully made up from the same clip shipped in this year. Timber, again, bids fair to figure as a valuable export; for although so far stock has largely accumulated in London, there is no lack of assurance in the trade that the value of Tasmanian timber is being established in Europe and new markets be ing opened. Public Works. While the interest charged upon our heavy permanent debt continues to be, as it now is, swollen by the interest due upon over £400,000 of floating liabilities, no Treasurer would or could venture to in crease our loan obligations by any serious amount for public works. But we have, in addition to certain unex pended balances and money available from Crown lands fund, £200,000 in hand with which we have yet to deal, and upon this fund Ministers hope to be able to operate immediately, if cautiously. We may also entertain the hope that pri vate enterprise will aid us in construction i of public works that shall find labour for our people and advance the interests of the colony at large. Some £2000 will have to be found for new school buildings, and £2000 for post and telegraph offices-expenditure justified and necessitated by the extension of educa tional advantages throughout the commu nity, and expansion of business generally. Whatever immediate course we adopt in respect of any portion of this £200,000, we regard ourselves and the country fully pledged to provision of this sum (if the line costs so much) when occasion is ripe for the extension of the railway beyond Ulverstone. Mr. Speaker, it is with some measure of pride, not wholly unjustifiable, I think, that I have given this account of my stewardship during the past two years, and it is with hope abundantly justified that I look forward to that new era of prosperity which the facts and figures I have cited seem to foreshadow. Ministers have more than fulfilled their promise to reduce the ex penditure, and by that reduction, rather than by increased taxation, to balance the public account. Their engagement to effect a saving on the estimates of 1894 of £21,000 has been fulfilled by a saving of £41,000 for that year, and the expenditure of 1895 was less than the original estimated disbursements of 1894 by over £80,000. Ministers have, with much able support of hon. nmembers, Carried out a rigid sys tem of retrenchment that, at first, may have incurred for them a considerable degree of unpopularity, but which has come to meet with the cordial approval of the bulk of the taxpayers throughout the colony; and can confiden'tly state' that the results have been increased efficiency and substantial improvement in the administration of pub lic affairs. Confirmed in the belief that Ministers have discharged a difficult and most re sponsible task creditably to themselves and with advantage to the community, I lay my estimates before the House with the full expectation that they will be favourably received by.a majority of honourable mem bers. And now, Mr. Speaker, having expressed my thanks to you and the House for the patient and attentive hearing given to me, I move that the House go into com mnittea of supply. The motion was carried. In Committee. In committee the item, Governor's establishment, attendant £95, was passed pro forma. The House resumed, and leave was given to sit again on Tuesday next. LEAVE OF ABSENCE. The PREMIER moved for 14 days' leave of absence for the member for Westbury (Mri. Reibey).-Carried. NEW BILLS. The PREMIER, by leave, introduced bills for regulation: of the Civil Service of Tasmania; to provide for the establishment of a department of Agri culture; to amend the Education Act, 1885, and the Game Protection Act; to provide for the better suppression of betting and gaming in public places. The 1ills were read a first time, and the second readings were fixed for Tues day week. ADJOURNMENT. At 9.25 D.m. the House adjourned till 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday next.
