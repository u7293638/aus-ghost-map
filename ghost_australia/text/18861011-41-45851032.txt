SPORTING. VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING [By Telegraph.] (By Our Own Correspondent) Melbourne, October 10. Saturday morning was fine enough to nduca a splendid attendance at Canlfield, mt before the racing began there was a heavy bower, and later in the rilernoon it came liter the Grand Foal Stakes and Guineas bad been decided, so that ths results of the principal races were not affected by tha weather. The racing was good, tha Guineas being a most exciting set-to between Maddelina, Volcano, and Firat Consul, and the latter ought to have wen, but he seemed fco run unkindly until they got Into the straight, and then he just failed to make up bis lost ground. Both the Guiaeaa and Foal Stakes winners, were bred at Morphetville, and the result of the day's racing will still further increase the reputa tion of Sir Thorn 33 Elder's stud. A large Beld weighed out for the Maiden Plate, and Newrnaster, an outsider, won cleverly from ths lucky Highland Chief. The Ballarat people served Huntsman up very warm for the Hurdle Race, and after a good race with Bonnie tLad be landed Ms backer's money. Fouiteen saddled up for the Foal Stakes, and the Sydney people declaring in favour of Yetman ha left the paddock first fa vomits, although Epicurean, 'Sumatra, and Eortense were all backed. The Lockleys filly got the best of the start, and having tne race In band all the way she wen by four lengths from Perhaps and Yetmac, who r&n; a dead heat for Escond place. The stable did not proSt much by Hortense's victory, her unlucky defeat by Mistletoe having rather damped their ardour. The Guineas came nest, and with no stable money for Maddelina and Blairgowrie, the other Sydney representative, Volcano, went oat at even money and odds on._ The start was not easily accomplished owing to First Consul and al-addelina refusing to toe the line. The favourite got ofr well, and appeared to be running over hia field until Maddelina tackled him, when he speedily; lost place to the mare who led into the straight. At the distance Blair gowrie bore down on the leaders and looked all over a winner for a few strides, but he died away again and left Maddelina and Volcano to struggle on with First Consul in hot pursuit. In the last 100 yards Maddelina began to stop, but she just squeezed home by half a length, while First Consul, who came with _ an extraordinary run. in the centre of the course, wa3 only half a head behind Volcano. With the exception of First Consul tha field were all SDun out at the distance, and had Power bsen able to get Hortense's brother going earlier he must have won easily. On. returning to scale Hales protested against; Colley for boring him on to the rail3, but after hearing the evidence the Stewards dismissed the objection. When the horses were weighing for the Hontera1 Cup the rain began to come down in torrents . and the start wa3 delayed some time. Char coal made most of the running until he slipped-up on the fiat, after which he never got to the front again, and finally fell at the last fence. Union, the favourite, was always In a good placa and led into the straight, when Mr. Inglis, who Lvl ridden a very patient race, sent Goldfinder to the front and won cleverly. Hogmauay and iliddlemarsh were She only two backed in earnest for the Toorak HandicaD, and the latter won cleverly at the finish from Eichworth and Hogmanay, The following fs a description of the running : — MAIDEN PLATE.
