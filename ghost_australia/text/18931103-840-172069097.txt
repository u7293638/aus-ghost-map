Hampton Court. Ghosts in the Palace. Tho Psychical Society, if it bo in need of any ghosts to' lay,- should- turn its attention to Hamilton Court -Palace. - A resident in the Salnco informs tho Dailu Graphic that even to ur — ut this latter end of an uubeliovin-r cen- tury — the doors of Hampton Court still open auu Abut to tho touoh of ghostly fingers, and some of the . rooms still resound to ghostly rcvolry in tho small hours of tho morning. Jime Seymour, it appears, is one .of tho most restless of theso vagrant spirits! Hoi' voice is se ofton heard that it has become quite well- known to tlio living listeners, whilo her habit of pulling away pillows from under tho heads pf sleepers must go far to ensure her a hearing, oven among tho least wakeful. Another of King Honry tho Eighth's wives, Auuia Boleyn, confines horsolf, apparently, to what is known in theatrical parlance as "walking." Sho, poor lady, however, unable to rest iu her grave,- would hardly be moro, comfortable' for a pillow. Nevertheless, oven her -'silent protest against tho nnoient injustice of her royal husbnnd has been sufficient to deprive one' of tho. residents to-day of tho services of a cook. The good woman was not unwilling to oblige — indeed,- in her last situation sho had curried her complaisance so far us to uot as nurso to n mistress "who was inflicted with haricot voins — hut sho protested thero was a limit to all things, und not all the goodwill -in the world couhl induce, her to stay iu a placo wlioro "Ann Bullion wnlked, and ghosts woro "so' harbacious." In fact tho same old stoty that has been -told of scores of old houses is told again to-day of Hampton Court. Figuros.aro distinctly soon to glido through the walls, looked doors aro opened, strange noises' aro hoard, and sleepers uro wukenod by nightly visitants. . -. . -
