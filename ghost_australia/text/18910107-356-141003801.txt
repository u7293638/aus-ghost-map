The Sioux Ghost Dance. T?0 Ghost Dance, in which the Sioux Indians are now engaged, has seldom been witnessed by a white man, but an American paper describes one of them as seen from a distance by an enter prising contributor, who persuaded a friendly half-breeood to take him to the spot. The camp in question was situated in a hollow, between a narrow belt of hills. Many of the Sioux are farmers and freighters, and their waggons were corralled in the middle of the valley. Some of the older braves and squaws, who have never reconciled themselves to modern ways, had tents apart. The oxen, pigs, and poultry were cooped or tethered on the out skirts of the camp. Thedance began at dark, and though the old squaws had carefully raked out the fires, a blaze arising from thom no.a and then revealed the fact that the braves were in full war paint. The warriors formed in rows at the eastern end of the camp, those iu front kneeling, with the young bucks and squaws standing behind them. At this point there was a pause of about ten minutes, during which perfect silence and absolute immobility prevailed. Then the old squaws joined hands and knelt down in the contre of the valley. They began chanting what sounded like a dirge varied by savagely triumphant yells. The warriors ad vanced, and, joining hands in a larger circle behind the old squaws, they began the Ghost Dance. They, too, chanted a dirge, but less shrilly than the equaws, and then came the invocation tothe dead braves to arise, and exterminate the white man. The old women, meanwhilo, had each pro cured a burning stick, that had ap parently been dipped in some kind of pitch. Returning with these, thy' stole like shadows under the linked arms of the warriors, and passed through the circle like a procession of sphinxes, This was repeated again and again, and it is said that the dance lasts till daylight, when every one concerned in it is more or less .exhausted.
