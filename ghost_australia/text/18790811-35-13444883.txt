ST. BENEDICT'S CHURCH. The Rev C F P Collingridge delivered a lecture in St. Boneda t s Church last night on Christian education, attach was also announced to be a revelation of the secret of the unbounded zeal of "Secular Members" for the education of Catholics - alias trips - wiping of the crocodile's years Every so it in the edifice appeared to be occupied The rev gentleman prefaced his remarks by reading the following extract from a -pOint Pastoral letter agreed to by the English hierarchy in by and on April 21, 1871, and which his Grace Archbishop A Vaughan and the Roman Catholic Bishops introduced and commented upon in thou recent Postal al -"A people to whom morale was not taught cannot be moral, but Christian morals cannot be taught without a onion for what is more ility but the law of duty , which arises from our personal relations towards God and our neighbour i And how is it possible to teach this law of duty) without a known - ledge of the persons towards whom these relations exist? But to know this- unless men are going to reduce a Christian people to the level of Deists Christianity must be taught in our schools Christian morality cannot be taught without the knowledge of Christ, and that again, by necessity, involves the knowledge of His history His teaching, His -ammendments. His incarnation. His Divine iKnsonolitv And what this but dogma for religion without dogma is not Christianity In whatsoever school, then, religion is not taught, morality is not taught, and where morality is not taught, the heart, the conscience, and the will of children are not concerned for the duties and conflicts of life What can be more false, what more fatal to man, to families, and to States, than to call this education?" He | explained that as he was about to take his leave of the congregation with a view to become a member of the order of Jesuits, he deemed it his duty | to address them on educational matters which had recently engaged their attention He had promised to tell them that night the secret of the unbounded d zealot secular monitors for the education of Catholic children It might not appear strange at first sight that those who thrived on a system of huddling together all sects in one mass, without definite religious teaching, for the intellect should wish Catholic children to be stirred up and mixed with their old pour ida-? victimized Christiania Their object, no doubt, was tomato the rising generation homogenous It looked be well to see the citizens of a country turned out as bricks from a mould, and moved and shaped by one ubiquitous and gigantic machi- j nely It was so conducive to the extension of individual liberty and the chief mechanician in this Church engineering was so paternal, that it was foolish for the little lambs of Christ's flock not to throw themselves into the mould It was strange, however, to behold the unlimited zeal of their civil instructors for the spiritual and moral welfare of Cafhob'- children. The Pope and the bishops had never thoroughly understood the wants of the Catholic people, but the whole of the importers of the Canadian and. a few other self commis sioned officers had done so, and were ready and willing to make all Catholics understand their religion, and in particular the shape and colour and degree of the docility due to their pastors They were also most desirous of an dang Catholics just and truthful and temperate j in other words, of moraUy reforming the benighted Catholic section of the community What was the secret of such burning zeal? where their secularist contemporaries apprehensive of the eternal damnation of those outside the secular flock ? Did they fear that Catholics would poiishoaerlastmglyif not brought within their educating influence? No, they had no apprehensions of such a character, for practically the men he referred to disbelieved in a future retribution Their most noble aspirations were measured and limited by the number of revolutions the earth made round the sun while they walked under its light It were foolish according to them, to disdain the present life when the future one was so obscurely pointed out in searching the zeal of ser marists forth se who possessed the most explicit and definite views concern- ing the faith, he would have to stigmatize error is a he told to the Holy Ghost, and to raise it to the father of all lies, who was i her from the beginning , but, in showing his deletions of religious error, he would be unfor t nato if he was understood by any one present, Catholic Protestant, or Infidel, to be spent ing against persons He would say with sincerity) that he felt and had always felt a deep and-enthusiastic utfcetirtifo the English people and the English race, to which he belonged M mv of those who had unfortunately given up defined Ghtistnmty were amongst his brethren and countrymen, lad what he contended was that they were dupes, china es of error, victims of the father of lies Without invoking the Heavenly music, like the poet, to discover the cause of all the mischief, he could declare that the secret of the interest, the compassion and i earnest zeal shown by the secular world for Catholic children was the influence of the infernal serpent This was no assumption of his nothing got up to frighten them It W in his certain knowledge as sure as he was a priest of the living God as sure as that the Evil Orra with thousands and tens of thousands of evil spirits his satellites were going about seeking whom they might devour God's word, the perpetual teaching of the Church, the continual practice of exercising before baptism went to prove the existence and dangerous proximity of the dead and his angels of darkness the world could not believe therefore the world laughed at and scorned such a doctrine The father of lies told a lie to the first woman and tempted her to disobedience and pretended to take an immense interest in the w elf are of our first parents They possessed a knowledge of and the love of God but he pcrbU ided then to seek another knowledge, which he alleged were hi"horthan the first They yielded to the tempter and liar The gained the inferior knowledge, lost their innocence and forfeited God's pleasure and the ship her spiritual knowledge they had been gifted with They became subject, to error, and to every disorder of mind and body The Devil looked very courteous when he was tempting and his own stores throughout the world the dupes and victims he had referred to-had all the more spaciousness and plausibility to effective work They were now offered a better education for their children The,, were to be moralised and Christi sized They were to be taught not to be senile and priests hidden The A atac, the hierarchy their own priests and pastors had flodden them down had taught them to lose the principles of true Christianity to become murderers and thieves and drunkards > ow was the time of salvation for the Catholics Let the rising generation frequent the Public schools and they would become tenants tod from price fly thraldom, and learn to be manly Christians Secular knowledge with a mysterious modicum of Christ an to aching adapted alike "or Chnstiana, spiritualists, and This, va the specific that with the apple and it was easy to guess who the coach Iel tempter was Had they ever heard of the Egypt in crocodile a formidable reptile worshipped by the Egyptians of old This monster of the "Nile would make only two mouthfuls of the stoutest Briton there was a peculiarity about it which has made it proverbial If we got within a eel am proximity of it its eyes at once appeared affected its whole countenance drooped and li go to us rolled down its bon s 118 1 south, already wide enough, was s 1 etched back to a 1 unusual length The pool thing looked quite pitiful, quite full of Solicitude for all around it But do not be deceived Go no farther "-top rected" turn back Tlj for your life Those tears are crocodile s tears with a rush the reptile will be upon you The crocodile was the einbocLmrut of o√π claiment and indifferentism Such sympathy the crocodile had for its victims underhand spoil ears of the Anti Christian and an ecclesiastical schools id for Car bolto children The reverend g ntkmun concluded his lecture by a brief reference to the Denominational school system in England, which he maintain ed worked exceedingly well to the support given by sections of the Press to the views of the Catholics regarding educational matters and to the fact of representative Church of England ministers not having taken the side of the secularists
