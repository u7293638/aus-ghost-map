ORIGINAL POEM. THE ARMIES OF THE DEAD. Down the dead years to heedless ears The voices of the lost are borne : Before blind eyes a Legion flies Its viewless colours, stained and torn. Unmarked it comes, with silent drums, Unheard, it marches to the fight : Dumb bugle-notes from phantom throats Re-urge it onward through the night. What are these men that mock our ken, Whose camps are set in fields afar ? Whence come these hosts of hapless ghosts To waste the Vast with soundless, war? Can spirit-hands with spectre-brands Onwage in Space their Earth-born jars? Shall the long call to battle fall Within the marches of the stars ? Yes! Ever on in ages gone The words have watched this great campaign, And fierce and fast the trumpet blast Through aeons shall resound again. Since first they swung, the stars have sung The Song of Battle overhead, For. face to face, in boundless Space Are set the Armies of the Dead ! This is the Law to overawe The coward souls that shun the fray : Weak from their birth, upon the earth They skulk through lifeâ€”and pass away. But when such fearful spirits here Have dropped their mortal guise, and fled To that last bourn, whence none return, They join the Armies of the Dead. And evermore on that high Shore, By Fear compelled, in long array, With sword and shield they fare to field To front the forces, dim and gray, Which Terror brought against their thought When in the flesh they moved below: But from the grave the true and brave Of Earth, to perfect peace shall go!
