Frtohtened to Death. A correspondent sends the follow ing startling narrative to the Daily Chronicle :—The peace of a select circle in Oxford is just now con siderably disturbed by the facts having leaked out concerning a very thrilling ghostly visitation which happened a few weeks ago in an old house, reputed for a long time past to be haunted. No tenant had been found sufficiently bold to hire it until lately, when some young ladies connected with the Salvation Army, nnder the head of Miss W , a well known worker among the "poor, ventured to take it off the landlord's hands for a small rental.

De termined to discover tbe truth, they set to work in a very methodical way flouring the staircase, so as to detect footsteps, and by pasting up the fireplace. They moreover in duced the ■ policeman to watch the house, so as to prevent any knavish attempts upon their credulity. The result was highly unsatisfactory, for on the second night of their stay they all saw the figure of a woman apparently issue from the wall, and pass up*' the staircase and vanish. MissW declaresthatthe apparition actually-passed through her own person, as though a door. On the following night-Miss W was upstairs! the other two ladies remaining in the f$glpur. Suddenly Miss W heard ariVftdul scream, and rushed down to see w^jat had happened. On the stairs she was met by the ghost, which once more " passed through her." Nothing daunted, the brave lady proceeded to look for her companions. She found one of them in strong con vulsions an<f*the other in a dead faint. The sad^art of the story is that one young lAly has since gone raving.mad from the effects of thej fright, and the other died a Tew days ago from the same cause. The ghost is that of a tall female in a lopg'grey dresg or roffiipS^
