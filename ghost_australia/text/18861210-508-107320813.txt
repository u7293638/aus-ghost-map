You must invite me to your club one night, Mansfield, to meet him. There's harilly a case in which he has been inte rested that i have not read from beginning to end. That Tichborne business was tome better than the best novel that ever was written. 1 have heard men of business say they have no time to read novels, and I have always pitied them I know of no greater relief to a man who is occupied continually with sober and serious industrial problems than to read a good novel or a rattling good police case. Take that diamond robbery the other day; why, it was worthy to be made in 'to » play.' 'It was very dramatic,' said Mansfield. 'It is a ijronderf ul thing in the history of many . modern romances of fraud and robbery, th^t both time, money, and intellect are. in vested in this criminal work, jast as if it vere a proper and virtuous trade, -while ingenuity is often taxed by the emergencies and exigencies of its adventurous character. The famous 'gold dust and bank Tobberies are cases in point. B ut the inevitable result seems to be discovery. It is a pity the miserabies do not take this fact into account. They do not. They devote life and. even money to the game. In the gold dust rob bery One of the thieves, whose sweetheart had been, ill-treated by his companions, con fessed. :He was in gaol; they were at large; she was not fairly taken care of by the men* who Were at liberty. In the bank robbery! Mr. Clayton, will remember that one of 'Rothschild's clerks found an error in the date or number of a bill, and inquiry led to detection. This was the affair in which a pafty of American forgers were engaged and ultimately captured. They entered upon the business with as much as eight or ten thousand dollars, with which they opened ba'pking' accounts, thus mastering: the methods of business and winning confidence until they had prepared their grand tbup. They only failed through the trifling error of .?a-r-wrong figure. The gold dust robbery was for a long time a mystery. Certain' cases of gold were sent from London, to Paris. They were weighed in London, at Dover, and Paris, and no variation noted; the locks and Seals too were all right; yet when the cases were opened in Paris they contained nothing but sand and iron. It was not until tb* pouf ession of one of the thieves, who was held for other offences, that the guard of the trial! was discovered to be the chief offender. \- The robbery, even with bis assistance, was on* of3 the most ingenious of 'modern in* Statbces.''' -* 5ea; that was a very remarkable case,* Said 'Mr. Clayton, ' and if, as the judge said in his sentence, the men had only devoted: thjeir talents in an honest calling they might have become rich and prosperous mfeu.' « Their lives,' said Miss O'Neill..' must have been full of excitement at all events/ *Ties,' said Mansfield, *and if therfe is anything in the theory of destiny, they were simply playing parts which they oould mot remst|t.mi(l 1 daresay they 'did n6fr^«aSer, more than I hare *een 'members of £he Parthenon .Company suffer on the mimic ri^g^-; .-?? ??'.?;??? -; -; ??:?? ?; ?-?'-- -.:??

V- ',Oh, he;can touch up the people with a good plain bit of human thought now and then,' I can tell you,' said Clayton, ' There was quite a spice of Dickens in his story this morning.' * Perhaps a little too much of that,' said Mrs. Dudley. 'The Bible and Testament have plenty of stirring and religious themes without going for them to secular books.' ' What did you think of the sermon ?' Miss Sybil/ Clayton asked, not wishing to enter into a controversy with Mrs^ Dudley. ' I'm afraid I was thinking of something else,' she replied. , ; * Orange blossoms/ suggested Clayton. ; Sybil did not reply. She turned to speak to Ella. VOh, do, Mr. Mansfield, tell us another story/ said Dick. * I fear you must humour Dick,* said Mr. Clayton. * Christmas is the children's time. We always tell stories, don't we, Dick, at Christmas ?^_' ' ' And it's a good ould fashion,' remarked O'Neill, * and I'm sure we'll all be delighted to listen to some more of Mr. Mansfields ex periences.' . ' Not my experiences/ said Mansfield ; ' London's experiences ; the world's experi ences; for I have only told you really what* you may. have read in the papers. But .these . things make an impression upon me, and especially since I have been associated with theatres. I am always suggesting them ±o dramatists with a view to new pieces; but I suppose some of the incidents which seem to me peculiarly dramatic cover too much ground for theatrical 'interpre tation. Now, for instance, the patience which some of the professional thieves evince in their work is most extraordinary r It is indeed the leading feature, and an ab solute necessity, it seems,- in the successful conduct of what- professional thieves call their big and serious afiains. My friend Jot'. Llewellyn, the great criminal lawyer, de lights, in dwelling upon some -of the : eases with which he has been associated. One of the cleverest things I think I ever heard of Was, the netting of £20^000 recently by a little company of professionals whom the police call a gang, which is quite & romance of crime, though hardly; the sort of story, perhaps, that will interest Dick. But then I don't think I know, any ghost stories.* ' Oh, nevermind/ said Dick; * anything like a story interests me, doesn't it, Ella? You should hear some of Ella's stories.' \- \ vOhjIvamBUTe w? shonld.be delighted,' said Mr: Mansfield. ---? '?? -^ *» j ~^ it 1*1 don't '.ttmik MydTt '^ronld^?4rB|id'; Ella.

' I have a cab at the door with another officer inside,' he continues, -and he hauls x)S his prisoner While the shopkeeper goes for his hat and coat, and in due course proceeds to Scotland Yard, to find they had not heard of the rob bery or the clever capture.' . 'It seems/ said George' Dudley, 'as if thieving were a regularly organised business in London.' ,,??:'. 'Oh, yes, it is,' replied Mansfield, 'quite a busiaesa — or rather, as the superior per?, sons engaged in it call it, a profession. It has grades, castes, classes. It has its mer chants and lawyers, its experts in precious stones, its goldsmiths, its receivers and : dealers. The lowest rung of the thieving ladder, I am told, is that which is known as the 'leg of mutton trick.' Your house is watched; only a short surveillance iB neces- sary. The butcher delivers at the kitchen door a joint of meat, say a leg of mutton. Ten or fifteen minutes afterward he is well out of sight. Then the thief makes a hurried call ; it is the wrong leg of mutton. Your cook returns it, and the operator scores the joint. This is a very simple, rarely unsuccessful plant, so a friend of mine tells me who is a very charming and clever gentleman, who graduated at Oxford, and is known, nevertheless, as a thieves' lawyer. He told me an extraordinary story the other - day about the manner in which any article that you very much prize and of which you have been robbed may be restored. You communicate first with trae of the chiefs, one of the leading men in that /branch of work to which your loss or the mode of the robbery naturally belongs. 'Gentleman Jim,' for example, is a most amiable and obliging thief by profession. ' A friend of mine,' says my informant, the' aforesaid lawyer, '. lost a valuable scarf-pin, an heir loom, at the Oaks. I applied to Gentleman Jim. He gave me an appointment at a certain little tavern in the eastern part of London. I met him, and' was struck with the cleanliness of the inn. There was a plump and rosy landlady. Her daughter was playing the piano in the parlor. Gentle man J im said gin cold was his liquor. I took gin cold also. So likewise did a gentle man whom I had observed on the racecourse at Epsom singing sentimental songs to a harpist. Gin cold was the popular drink. The landlady herself ' did not mind' if she had * just one/ and we thus became quite a little friendly party. The -man with the ^pin was late. It was an hour after the appointed time before he arrived. He also thought gin cold was a good thing, and when he had 'wetted his whistle/ as he called drinking off a glass of raw spirits, he beckoned me into a back passage, bolted the door, and under a gaslight took outa-bundle from his pocket, a red cotton pocket hand kerchief full of pins, watches, chains, lockets, and various articles acquired the previous day on the course. ' Which is it ?' he asked. I fished it out. ' Will £5 satisfy you ?' I inquired handing him a note. ' Cer tainly, anything you like/ he said, ' the governor's tip is good enough if it's only a two of gin.' ' But I am afraid these are vulgar details, Miss O'Neill; they are only excusable as the scenes of lower life are excusable in a melodrama, and life is more or less a melodrama.1 (TO BE OOKTnrcTED.)
