JffY LADY'S PLOT; OB, THB Cxhost of Diavolo Castle. CHAPTEB XXV. ATjOKB AT DIAVOLO -CASTLE. Mrs. Allingham saw her guests depart 'with the profoundest eenee of relief. The injtant \- ifchey were gone ehe turned to Doctor AiliTig ?tam. Never dreaming that he had listened to Doctor Jeffries with other than her own supreme indifference to Nina's ' peculiar ideas/ she said eagerly, dropping her hand in caressing affeo fion upon his shoulder as she spoke : 'Now, Berfcfaold, give me an hoar. I had no chance to talk with you last night, and am absolutely pining to do eo this morning.' But Doctor- Aliingham felt BcarQEuy prepared for so momentous an interview. He was ntft without his own shrewd suspicions w regard to hip mother's anxiety, and desirous 61 baTOfig his .mind dear and fixed as to his intentions, found a 'prompt excuse. He promised, however, to meet her in the drawing-room before noon, and- with that pro mise, at once hastened away, Mrs. Aliingham looked after him a moment, fiaa then, shaking her head witfn ah Unqpmfdrt able sense of increased anxiety* wenfc to Bet own rOMSB. ? She found Erigitta there, busily engaged in ker usual tasks. . \- ' Miss Beauchamp is lying down/ the ?woman ?explained, in reply to Mrs. Allingham's imj^iry» ??and, as she directed me nofc to go to her till I heard her bell, I thought I would make you com fortable, mistress/ Mrs. Aliingham nodded her head in acquies cence, and walking to a window opening on one of the smaller court-yards, looked thoughtfully out. ' ' But she saw nothing of its beauty. Its wilder 'ness of flowers ; its singing fountaibs ; itB gay pavilions; itstesselated pavement ? ips gleaming statues made no impression on bar mind. One' thought occupied her — the thought of her coming interview with her son. From that thought she was at last recalled by Brigitta'e voice. The maid, as she went to and fro at her work, had been furtively eyeing her in hesita ting doubt, finally bursting- out in these words : 'He showed himself to Miss Beauchamp last night, mistress !' Mrs. Aliingham neither cried out nor spoke. She just turned slowly round and looked at the woman. But it was an awful look — a look of mute, white terror, for which there could have been no adequate words. Brigitta started to run to her. Mrs. Aliingham, still mute, repellantly, raised one shaking hand and waved her back. Awed into silence. Brigitta stood gazing at her, waiting till she could speak. Directlv the words came. Slowlv. nainfnllv. as if by a great effort 6he began hoarsely : * Did he— did he — ' Her Toice failed her. Brigitta hastened to answer. ' He «aid nothing, mistress — just looked at hez and she fainted/ ' Ah !' breathed Mrs. Aliingham, sinking into a chair. ' No wonder she fainted ! no wonder. I should faint ! — I did, you know.' ' Yes, I know, mistress/ answered the woman, her voice awed and anxious. 'But he never comes here ?' 'Never! It is only the other, and more dilapidated portion of the castle he haunts. But — but siiie is a guest !' , As she uttered those last shuddering words she raised her eyes in terrified inquiry to Brigitta' s face. The woman spoke the very thought that was in her mind. * Is it in mercy, mistress ?' Brigitta whispered. Notwithstanding that answer was in exact accordance with Sirs. AUingham'a fears, the effect was precisely the reverse of what might have been expected. It aroused her slumbering Vbe rose to her feet, still pale, still trembling, t& with the fire of her natural imperiOusne^s and determination blazing from her eyes. ' In mercy !' she repealed, harshly^ raising her arm in arrogant defiance. ' No man, living or dead, gha.H stand between me and my project ! Have I gone this far only to be balked ? 5T6 ! A thousand times no ! And, Brigitta.,1 turning her flaming gaze upon the awed maid, * there is to be no change of rooms '. That one is best adapted to our purpose. To that one she must and shall be kept !' ' She has no wish to change, mistress. I asked her.' Mrs. Aliingham forgot her superstitious terrors fn amazement. ?* No wish !' she echoed. i Brigitta repeated all that had passed between. Nina and hereeif from the moment of her first entrance into the haunted chamber that morning to the moment of her dismissal. As she came to a close, Mrs. Altrngftatn nodded her head approvingly. ' So/ she remarked, 'you told her I disbelieved in — in its apptarance ? That waft wise !' For a little she stood in silent thought. Then, saying she would go up and see if Miss Bean champ tras asleep, she moved io the door. .There she suddenly looted back. * Do not/ she said, 'intrude upon her till she rings. Bemember that you are to scrupulously obey her most trifling directions, unless — they happen to clash with mine !' With that charge she disappeared. She went straight to Nina's chamber. Fearful of awaking the girl if asleep, she entered without knocking. She found her stretched upon a ' bread, luxurious couch in xront of the fire, and, as ehe anticipated, wrapped in a still, dreamless slumber. The window curtains were carefully arranged to exclude a dangerous stream of the sharp mountain air, and the too brilliant rays of the son. Bat in the soft, subdued light the sleeper looked inexpressibly pure and beautiful. Mrs. Aliingham stood gazing down upon her for a'H&ile;, acd then stole eoftiy away to the drawing-room to await the tardy appearance of her eoru . 'It it were not for Berfchold,* 6he mused, ' I ' would sot imbrue my hands in her blood. She is good and lovely— too good and' too lovely to be—' She broke off there, exclaiming passionately* fj)o next moment : , 'What is ehe in comparison *iSi Ber&o;&'M «ij»fafj y.nfl aggrandizement?
