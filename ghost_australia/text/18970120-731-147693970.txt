THOMAS JARVIS INTERVIEWED. I On Thursday afternoon, our representative made his way to the humble home of Mr. Thomas Jarvis, 45 Crown-lane, Ultimo. He was discovered nursing a two year-old baby, and his face declared him to be one of the happiest men in Sydney. He was up and about and able to answer the knock at the door. Although pale and bearing still the marks of a critical illness, and a period of pain, it was very clear that he was an invalid on the rapid road to convalescence. In reply to the preliminary questions, he said: 'Â°You want to know all about my case ? Well, I am glad of an opportunity to tell you. The facts may be of value to those who are stricken as I was.' ' How long were you suffering ?' ?' Well, twelve months ago I got so bad that I had to leave off work, and I have done nothing since then. About live years ago, next Christmas, I met with an accident ; I was badly scalded while taking a bath in Pitt-street, Sydney. Since the accident I have been in failing health, and after four years of gradual development of the malady, I was forced to give up my billet at the Glebe Island.' ' What were the symptoms ?' ' Simply indescribable. The pains were something terrible. They were just about as much as I could bear. They were for all the world like as if a saw were cutting my bones in two in every part of me. I had no control over my bowels or bladder, and was a nusiance to myself and everyone else. I was incessantly shivering, and shaking, and could neither eat nor sleep. On the 23rd March last I saw a well-known doctor and he told me that my case was utterly hopeless. However, he gave me an order to the Director cf Charitable Institutions.' ' Did you make use of the order ?' ' No ; I came home and went to bed, and have been pretty well in bed ever since. Five weeks ago I could not walk across the floor; in fact, I could not get out of bed. I felt then that it was all over with me, and only a question of days when I would give up the ghost. My doctor was attending me, and did all he could, by opium and morphia pills, to ease the agony I was in. I was under him for five or six week. He came to the conclusion that I was suffering from Locomotor ataxia, or Progressive locomotor ataxy, a disease of the spinal cord, charac terised by peculiar disturbances of gait, and difficulty in co-ordinating voluntary move ments. He told me that I might last for ten years, and that I might never get the use of my legs. (Just then the patient kicked his legs about with energy to show that medical opinion is not infallible.) Well, just as a drowning man will grasp at a straw, I grasped at an idea conveyed by the ad vertisement describing the cure effected in the case of another boiler-maker in England, which I read in the ' Australian Workman,' by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People. I read in the advertisement of a case which seemed to fit my own. I determined to give the Pink Pills a trial anyway, and sent for a box. The effect was as marvellous as it was magical. I was able to cat and sleep as though nothing was the matter with' me. It was the first appetite and rest I had for many a day. It was incredible. I immedi ately left the bed and was able to move about. I have taken four boxes of Pink Pills during tbe past four weeks, and am now taking tbe fifth box. 1 can walk about with the aid ot a stick, and am gradually, but surely, recovering my former vigor and vitality. ' You see those crutches there ? They are perfectly new, and I have never used them. They were made for me before I got- the Pink Pills, but I was too weak to use them, and now I don't want them. All I want is this stick, and I hope soon to do without it. You see I am rapidly regaining my strength.' ' He is a 100 per cent, better.' said Mrs. Jarvis, who had come in and taken the baby on her knees. ' The Pink Pills have saved his life, and made another man of him.' A friend who called in at this point, said that Jarvis looked ten years younger that day than he ,did a fortnight previously. ' I can now,' oontinued Jarvis, ?' have a cold bath, and all the feeling has come back in my legs. If I keep on going the way I am, I hope to be able to resume work as a boiler-maker, and you know I have to4-e in the very pink of health and strength to work at that trade. I am better to-day than I have been at any time during the past five years. I ascribe all the change and benefit to these Pink Pills. They have saved my life. I am in no pain now, what ever. and feel like a new man. On the mantelpiece there is a bos of opium and morphia pills which Che doctor gave me to { deaden the excruciating pain. But they can ; 'stay where they are, for I no longer need | them. Everybody who knows me has been ' amazed at the change in me. They can 1 hardly believe their eyes. My being about j again has caused quito a sensation out j here.' i Such is this remarkable history, and it | confirms what is said in all the chief news papers of this country of the astonishing cures wrought by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale people. They cure locomotor ataxy, partial paralysis, and spinal disease, also the many disorders which arise from an impoverished state of the blood, such as ; ansemia, pale and 6allow complexion, general muscular weakness, indigestion, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, pains in the I back, nervous headache, etc. I
