POETRY. To Lay the Ghost. You say you've a ghost that haunts you, Thu ghost of a vain regret, The thought of the years you have wasted, And would, if you could, forget. Your heart overflows with sorrow As you think of the misspent Past, Opnortonitioe lost for over Crowd memory thick and fast. But all your vain regrettiegs Will never lay the ghost Wnich makes us. such one, at some time, His most unwilling boat. For the only way to do it Is to rise to a better life, To build up the old waste places, To start on a holy strife. To conouer yoor lowrer naturo, To crucify Self. aud to live, HLencoforth, to a nobler purpose, Your time and your strength to give. Oh, live as a man and a Christian, And you shall have polee at the last. And your deathbed shall not be haunted By the ghost of a miespent Past.
