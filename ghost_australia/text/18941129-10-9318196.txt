The results are included in " A Report on the Census of Hallucinations," published in the latest edition of the proceedings of the society. The question, of course, was framed in much more elegant and detailed form than the somewhat abrupt inquiry into which most people will translate it but whether we call " the spook " a " living being," or "an inanimate object," or " a mysterious voice, it comes to pretty much the same thing, so long as there is no external physical cause to account for the phenomenon. And now for the i emits. Out of 17,000 persons interrogated 15.316 answered in the negative, leaving only a meagre 9 percent, of people who had been favoured by extraordinary experiences.
