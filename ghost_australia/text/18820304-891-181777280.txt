It is thus we hsre access, for through Christ *we hare access by one spirit to the Father.* It is the* that we can worship the Father in spirit and in truth. This !e»sos He taught the poor eocfeseed sinner at Svchar* * well - It is thus this we are practkaCy sancrided, more and mere separated from «t2, for He is the cHoh* Ghost,* the 'spiritof hoEraes*.* It is thus we are comforted and guided; for the lord Jesus said, * If I go away I will send the comforter (Htarsliy ©crsdere. "which in duces zaneh saae than comfort). This sime word is used in I John 2. 1, for Christ the advocate (5tcral!y y<zssz&£e), cce who lock* , after all our interests. And thus, as Christ j kok? after all our invests before God, so the ; c»>w»y FhrscJrf# koks i&e; ail Christ interests : as connected with us while we are passing through the wilderness, the chine Servant hj hrto all truth ; for here again the truth is Hi* channel.

T- John sri. 3S. we rod, 4 He that belfereth ob ife, ccs of hi* beln* shall iow rivers of Irvine water.* Thus those who have V»fw qekkered, and who are indwelt by the Sciris, are row the channels through He £s ministered to others. The waters in the desert ilowed from a smitten rock. The water dewed from. Christ's wounded sice, and rt a only as we are ssdntes, exerrised, sub dued, that these rivers wSirr from us Onh as we come thus to Christ and drink shall living vatess £mr from us. Alas I how Ertle we see of the Spirit Sowing from those professing to be quickened by the Spirit- -"Is_it cot because we are drawing little from the great fountain* head?' 'Let him come unto Me and drink.* It is onlj through fared sinners that God is now to send forth His rirer of life. * The lore of God is shed abroad in oar hearts or the Holy Ghost-' And this love of God we are to pour out in rivers oa this arid desert as wit* nesses of God; first, by earrung the gospel to our fellow—inters,, and telling of that Christ whom we know, and who is offered to ibem; and. secondly, by rnraisteriog lore to all the saints of God in building up and com* forcing them. Ana it is only as our own affec tions and thoughts, that is, all our inner man, is filled with the pure water from the fountain, that the rivers can fiow. . In connection with the three operations of the Spirit of God which we hvre been consider ing, namely,- the being quickened,—being in dwelt, and comma*-fating, we may look—1st, at Christ himself ; 2nd. at the Church corpo rator ; 3rd, at each individual believer— 1st- As quickened by the Spirit Christ was bom of the Spirit. This was His incarnation, as we read in the angel s answer to Mary in Luke i. 35. 4 That holy thing which shall be born of ih/e shaU be called the Son of God.* (Luke L So.) The meat offering had to be mizzled with oil. (1 er. iL 4.) 2 he Church corporate!? in £--e resurrection of Christ (Horn i. 4; I Peter i. 3). He was quickened by the Spirit, as the Head of the body (1 Peter tu. IS*. The individual believer; when the Spirit appKes the truth to his conscience (James i IS). * Of his own will begat He us whh the word of truth.* 2n:. Indwelt by the Spirit. Christ we see sealed with the Spirit when, at TTT« baptism, the Spirit as a core rested on TTv-* The meat-offering bad to be anointed wirh oil (Lev. xL 4) 'Him hath God the Father sealed.* (John vi 27 ) The Church, we see at Penteccst, not merely ooickened bus formed into- & temple for .God on the earth: the true temple filled with the true glory- Ard we see this accomplished in rnlfilmert of Acts L S- k Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost, is come upon tou. and ye shall be wimesses unto me, (I) both in Jerusalem and in all Jcdea, (2) and in Samaria. (3) arc unto the uttermost part of the earth. The Holy Ghost thus fell cn — 1\.

The Gentiles in the^ preaching of the Word.- ■ (Actsx. 41.) - Asc-thcs'is: the Spirit cow given. In this latter method was the prot er Genrile pentecosf our peniecoet- Thus it is in the preaching of the Word that we are to expect the blessing of the Spirit As regirds the individual, indwelling is seen in his s^aHng: wh^n by bearing the record he receives his emancipation, his couscous liberty anaphase with God. takes his place as a son with the Holy Ghcst as the testifier, ana with Htm as the earnest waits tor the inherit Chrisc in His minLtry and prophetic work communicated the Spirit. : The Chnrch £» seen ccm-mcrteafcisg the Spirit, in the preaching of the apostles, as and subsequent to Penteccst; in "the Scriptures they hire left; and in all collective testimony do vs to the preset rime, thai has been in accord y ce with the Were cf God.

These words, Bern, Indwelt, and Communi cating, bar? theropposites severally in the three weeds spoken about the Spirit—Eesist, Grieve, and Quench. L The Spirit may be resisted. ActsriLoL. 'Ye stiff-necked and urctrecm osed in heart s~-d ears, ve do always resist the Holy Ghost.' This is addressed to the uncon Terted who resist Him as a qui&ener.; IL The Spirit may be grieved. Eph. ir. 3f>: ' Grieve not the Hob" Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the*day bf redemption * This is addressed only to saved people, who can grieve him as an indwelEcg Spirit. This show? what a friend he is to us If tog had eommsted some great sin, your friend would be grieved, your enemy would be rejoiced. You can zrieve'cnly a friend.
