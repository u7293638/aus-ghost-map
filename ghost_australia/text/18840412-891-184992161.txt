FOB THOSE WHO FAIL. " Ait honour to him who shall win the prire," The world has cried for & thousand years, But to htm who tries and who fails and dies I give great honour and glory and tears. Give glory and honour and pitiful tears To all who fail in thoir deeds sublime, Their ghosts are many in the van of years, Theywene born with Time in advance.of Time. Oh, great is the hero who wine a name, But greater many and many a time Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame. lets God finish the thonght sublime. And neat is the man with a sword undrawn. And good is the man who refrains from wine; But the man who fails and jet still fights on, Lo. he is the twin-born brother of mine. â€”By Joaquxs Wni.Tt, Philadelphia Prm,
