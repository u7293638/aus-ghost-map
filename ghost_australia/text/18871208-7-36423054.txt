LAND NATIONALISATION. TO THE EDITOR. Sir—I am pleased to find your correspondent "T. G. Bennett" is neither ignorant of Henry George's tenets nor of the wonderful advance that is being made towards bringing them into actual practice. A few short months ag >it wag said the George theories could aever enter into practical politics. People forgot that we even then had a land tax; small, it U true, bat tbere, all the same. I recognise "T. G. Bennett's" ghost in the land tax assessment, and for the report of the discussion on same which took place in Parliament last week, I beg to refer him to your issue of Ist inst He will there ccc that, notmthetandiag Sir John Downer's warnicg about its being' the first step towards the carrying out of Henry George's scheme, Mr. Holder bad a majority of seven. How abont the ghost no*? "T. G. Bennett" thinks I might have gone farther in my last. I did not do so for tear of taking up too much of your valuable epace; but for this I should have explained that all land nationalists want is justice for all, equal opportunities tor all; and to obtain this we ask that that particular element of nature which all nee more or less, viz, the land, shall be treated as common proparty ; tfcat it, tfaat every person occupying land shall pay rent in the form of a tax to the State (the people) for tbe privilege granted him. Toe whole community being the State all would benefit by such rents. As an instance of how we with it worked, take tbe following:—A farm, tbe present selling value of which is £I,OCO. Deduct amount paid to Government for same, and present value of improvements thereon, cay £800, leaving as available for taxation £200. This is the land value, and the only thing land nationalista wish to tax.—l am, iic, LAND NATIONALIST. Adelaide, December 5.1887.
