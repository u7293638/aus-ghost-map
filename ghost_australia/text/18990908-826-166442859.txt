The Pabnell Statue.â€”A meeting, convened by the Lord Mayor in com pliance with' a requisition, was held in the Mansion House, Dublin, for the pur pose of furthering"a movement for the erection in Dublin of a statue of the late Mr. Parnell. Much opposition was given by representatives of the Wolfe Tone Memorial Association, who con sidered that the success of their enter Erise would be seriously interfered with y the new movement, and who there fore suggested that the Parnell statue project should be postponed till after the Wolfe Tone monument had been completed. The Lord Mayor moved re solutions approving of the Parnell statue project, appointing an Executive Com mittee to carry it out, and expressing confidence that this movement would not obscure the claims of the men of '98 to be honored by the land for the freedom of which they fought and died. After a stormy and exciting discussion, the resolutions of the Lord Mayor, which were seconded by the Mayor of Water ford, were carried by a large majority. We have pleasure in drawing atten tion to the well known establishment of P.. T. Wallmann & Sons, undertakers and embalmers, Pulteney-street. This firm have been consistent supporters of our institutions for many years, and are de serving of support. Courtesy and cheap ness are among the many good qualities they possess. Mr. Charles Santley, the eminent baritone, has received from the Pope the rare distinction of being made Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, in recognition of his many services towards the Church both in Cardinal Manning's lifetime and since. This is a very coveted honor, and not more than half a dozen other gentlemen in England possess it. His Holiness the Pope has sent 20,000 francs to Monsignor Kaveggio as a do nation to the fund for establishing Catholic schools in the Soudan.
