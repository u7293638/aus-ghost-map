ECHOES OF THE WEEK. By GEORGE AuousTOS SALES. LONDON, Nov. 2" Perfect candour, even in a very] "fishy cause, deserves at least acknowledgment, and it may be concluded that seldom has a more thoroughly candid letter been addressed to a newspaper than the epistle which a corre sporadic not of 'The Times has penned in favour of the gaming tables at Monte Carlo 1 his candid person describes the Casino as a society which provides for the due exercise, it within proper limits of an ineradicable and li -donate taste of mankind, and does so in a way that is not only a powerful counterbalance to the gambling rooms of other places where excess in encouraged by means of drink and the usurer, but also confers enormous benefits on a large number of persons in all degrees of life The Bank of Monte Carlo, it would appear, got as £400 GOO (2) a year in support of law, justice, religion, and charity, besides en couraging athletics, pigeon shooting, and sport generally on the Riviera It relieves the entire principality of Monaco from taxation and pauperism, makes roads lays out gardens, turns on the electric light, and provides high class music all for nothing Messieurs, fades le jen le Leu est fad Rien ne is true one' ' The croupiers streep up the money which fools have start ed on the numbers-how often have I backed my) pet number 30-but still there is consola- tion in the remembrance that the citizens of Monaco pay no taxes and that the casino band plays every afternoon 711a hope job Ino At eli, although I firmly believe that the Enemy of Mankind is quite as black as he is painted and possibly a little blacker the attempt to whitewash him may be can no need for its ni(_eiiuou_nts3 Since Horace Walpole tried to whitewash Richard HI all 1 in Is of people have been subjected to that process I picked up the other day an old book, in which it was great ely maintained that Macbeth never murdered Duncan, who was slain by his own subjects shortly) after he returned from unsuccessfully besieging Duilimn, that he (Macbeth) was a most virtuous and benevolent sovereign, so pious that he made a pilgrimage to Rome during the papacy of Leo II and that it was to train) Malcolm III and his descendants that Mr beth was described by the iron ish chroniclers as the son of a bend and an ass case of witches Perhaps Monaco is, after all as v virtuous and pious us the much v killed 1 line of Cow dor Mr Henry) Blackburn, who, as the originator of the Academy and Grosvenor Notes -those invaluable illustrated com patrons to the catalogue of our picture blouses) be considered in the light of a public benefactor has started a class for instruction in drawing for the press 1 colors of illustrated magazines, and news papers are continually clamouring for clever people who can draw and some 54,000 driving came up to South Kensington Last summer, yet very few of these drawings were susceptible of being reproduced 111 photo relief I apprehend that Mr Blackburn is lambs industry teach students especially young lady pupils how to draw clearly, firmly, and in all in pen and ink, so that their perform duties when reproduced may come out like workmanlike etchings, and not like ragged raw blurred, clumsy scrawls A glance at the natty little designs in the ViePai merrie, the OKE nee Anmnant, and the Petit Journal jom line will at once show the immense ti < hnical superiority of the French draughts men or at our own In a drawing on wood thecngriur often comes to the artists as sistance He mends broken lines and enter piets smailes into coherence) , but there is no one to help the " pen and artist, whose often strategy efforts are reproduced with ton stru t fidelity by the photo process V well know n stamp collector in the Strand is said to have acquired a stamp HO precious from its rarity that he wants 3200 for it This wonderful stamp is an American one llrattleboio, 1840 I know Brattleboro It is in Vermont, the Green Mountain State, and it will go down to posterity as the birth place of Mr Tim 1 take, a Innneier of a very remarkable stamp indeed, who came to a sudden end through the instrumentality of another gentleman named Stokes, who was not handed for shooting J Y to death Quite the contrary But what 1 md of stamp is it' A postage stamp, a receipt one, or a bill one' Is it a United States postage stamp with the Btattleboro postmark super posed on it, or what' .

His Majesty's predecessor on the Dutch throne fought, I think, in that engagement ; but his own intonation of the words reminded, one of the possible noise of the charge of the scots Greys, combined with that of the Household Brigade and the Six Hundred at Balaclava. William Blake,_pt_oi* impetus, once saw the ghost of a Hen and made a drawing of the somewhat unusual apparition. Were you ever confronted by the ghost of a book ? Such has been my fate this week. Reading in The Times of Monday an account of the recent sale at Sotheby's of the splendid library formed by the late Mr. F. W. Cozens, of Melbury road, Kensington, and The Shelleys, Lewes, I came across an item to the effect that a copy of Goya's Caprichos, presented by the Duke of Tries to your humble servant, hail fetched the respectable sum of £19. I rubbed my eyes-figuratively'speaking with astonishment. I am slightly insane in my admiration of the etchings and aquatints of Don Francisco Goya y Lucientes and only a few days before I left town, at the beginning of September last, I was showing to Mr. Jan Van Beers, who was on a flying visit to London, my much-prized copy of the Caprichos, together with the Porte has, the Dciastres de la, Guerre, the Prisionicros, and the Terror. I had long been under the impression that my copy of the Caprichos was the one given me at Madrid, more than 20 years ago, by the late Duque de Erins, a Grandee of Spain, who married the charming songstress, Victoria Balfe. How I became possessed of another copy-the one now in my possession I have not the remotest idea. I see advertised a book by Mr W. IT. Phyfe entitled Seven Thousand Words Often Mrs- pronounced. Seven thousand words ! Dear me, Mr. Phyfe, that is indeed a " large order." How many words had Byron in his vocabulary As many as five thousand? How many kind Pope? How many Shaks peace? Mr. Phyfe's book, the title of which, I confess, frightens me, should, however, be of signal service to the intelligent foreigner, who is often driven to desperation by our capricious pronunciation. Here, for example, is a very intelligent foreigner, Dr. Ch. P. Grieb, whose big two volume dictionary of the English and German languages (Stuttgart, 1842) is now before me, and to whom English pronunciation is so desperate a puzzle that he has appended to his work a synopsis of words," differently pronounced by seven different lexicographers Webster, Sheridan, Walker, Perry, Fulton, Jones, and Jameson. I will only quote one variant from the synopsis : " Sausage." What do you say to " snssidzh," "snwsidzh," " sausage," "sossidge," "sos age," and "sausage';" What is your " honourable" pronunciation-to be Japoni cully courteous-of the name of the dainty which, in the Fast East of the metropolis is sometimes known as a " passengers" If Dr. Koch would only come to London how tremendously he would be licensed I Next May would, of course, be the most appropriate time for the illustrious discoverer of the consumption cure to make his appearance in English society ; still the opening of Parliament will bring a good many " smart " people to town, and the upper ten are sadly in want of a new lion. It is no use for any of the old lions to come back. Even Stanley, I am afraid, would have no chance of renewed popularity in high places, and Buffalo Bill might fail to draw. A social lion to secure immediate success must be slightly eccentric, and in that capacity the famous Berliner would seem to excel It is said that for breakfast Dr Koch takes a thick soup made of Hour is this our old friend water gruel into which he breaks "an enormous quantity of black bread, toasted At 2 p m he dines Bill of 1 are-Soup, roast meat, and a heart pudding Only the soup is served inst At the doctor dons a rather pi either ruling suit and an enormous slouched hat mounts a vt huts horse, and called for an hour in the liner Garten J be supper, which is due at eight is us sumptuous as the dinner is simple, and there must be always three or four sorts of meat Dr Koch, drinks during his meal large quantities of sodawater Oh I Dr Koch Is the 1 fatherland free from a malady called free Um et davhclilett And, if not, what my serious lymph will cure the in digestion of a patient if he cuts three or four sorts of ment for supper, and washes them down With "huge quantities of soda water'' I have at home a copy of the first edition of the "Beggars Opera, with the engraved music, and Dr Ptpuschs overture, and on the frontispiece I read in faded ink " Mrs Keeley s Copy 1810 The book belonged to my mother, and was probably given to her half a century ago by the delightful actress ii he entered upon her eighty sixth year a few days since, and whose birthday was commemorated by the arrival of an in stance of flowers, telegrams, letters, and gifts of life a large number of visitors called, personally to congratulate her, at her house in Pelham crescent, Brompton Let me see In what part did I first see the admirable Mrs Keele I have it It was at the old Adelphi in 1830 7 as Smike in " Nicholas Nickleby) "Oliver In ist was played the same evening, with 0 Smith as Bill Sikes, . uses as 1 age and AA Wilkinson us Mrs Grunwig Did Mrs Keeley play Our en' So strange are the tricks thutniemoiy plays us that I decline I forget But Mrs Keeler us Jack Sheppard I But Mrs Keeley IIB Dolph Hc)ligcr-in comedy, in force, in burlesque, and in operetta I suppose that nobody would go nowadays to see the old English operettas, were any manager rash enough to lev ne them yet how delightful the days of by ore seemed such pieces as " Rosina, " Love in a Village, "No Song no Supper, " Alidaa and " The Quaker The exhibition of the works of the famous Japanese artist Ilokusui at the Fine Art Society s rooms in New Bond street is the talk of the town this week Hokusai is often as realistic and as humorous as SI Jules Garnier, of Rnbelms 1 "lubition fame,, only there is nothing in Hokusai to wound the feelings of Mrs Grundy, or to attract the lynx eyes of the Vigilance Association pm is as Hokusai seems to have been an exceptionally modest artist His " mama for drew near, ' as he called his graphic faculty, begun when he was only 0 The mullins of little 'Thomas Lawrence and little Joseph Mallard William Turner began about the same age and the youthful John Everett Millais used to be taken by his nurse to Mr Says a drawing school in Tokio 'There were no perambulators in those days so I suppose that Muster Millais went to school in arms Hokusai, accordingly Mr Afareus Iliush the genial editor of the catalogue of the Japanese at list a works, was dissatisfied with every thing which he produced up to the age of 70 At 73 he had contrived to muster the real forms of birds fishes, and plants, "con sequently, died uses himself adds at 80 I shall have made real progress, at 00 I shall have got at the bottom of things and at the age of the event dot and every line from my in fish vi will be until e As a matter of fact, the hopeful artist died considerably on the wrong side of 80 "Are these, asks a cynical ret lew er, the soliloquies of a Japanese artist, or of some grand old Western Port tician' Stop a minute, Mr Cynical Reviewer Hopeful Hokusai find a predecessor in sold quay in the person of a very grand old painter, sculptor, architect engineer, and poet, who flourished at the brightest period of the Italian Renaissance AMitn this grand old man was nearly 60 he drew a picture of him self as a little child in a point with the motto beneath, ._7ICOÍ_ Yajima "still he learns the name of the patriarch who was still learning was Michael Angelo Buo pretty
