I envy Mrs. paddon her. jewels, That is be- cause I have always been so poor." " "Ton may be rich some day," he said. She was fingering the ring absently. "May I ?

They won't have anything to say to him at home England I mean " and she nodded across the water. "Frank is the only one that is worth anything, and Mrs. Briggs says that he is doing for himself by agreeing to cut off the entail." . Mrs. Briggs?" ?.-.,.

Mr. Armstrong looked at her in a puzzled way. "I am sure there is a mystery about that rang. It troubles me. I think it troubles you too." ; " Yes, it troubles me. But I am not going to let it trouble me any meta." ' ; She plucked the ring passionately from her finger. " I wanted to get rid of it ever so long ago; but there I couldn't.

"It alike drowning a living thing," She said Never mind; it's gone-dead-*onjr \ -HU the blacks say." ;'.>.'* v: v.-'; "And may, all evil memories go with it," said Mr. Armstrong, fervently. He still watched James with a serious 'opera: alleged expression. The innocent childish face seemed to reassure him. He drew a little nearer hero, of "I've no right to pry into your secrets' he said, " but-Miss Calderwood-I Wish you'd answer me this: You've not promised to marry anybody, have you ; ;*:'?{ $ ] ? Janie did not answer for a moment. Then she laughed again her hard little laugh; * "No," she said, " I've not promised to marry any body." A.nd then she walked away from him and he saw her a little later playing a game of quoits with one of the passengers merry as if she had never biowna:«ira.^.v,r 'a'. '2,..:?.?'.?.;?..'. The steamer was drawing, near Aden when the conversation took place. During ; roe passage from skin Mr; Armstrong and Miss Calderwood had become great friends. They had gone on shore there in he same party's party in ^ which James had been the only lady. The other ladies on board did not take much notice of her, perhaps,- poorlittlo-tfaing, ~ because her clothes were so- shabby. Mr. Armstrong did not " mind that in the least ; he only looked at her face, and that was a sufficiently pleasing object to atoni»?toriall ther deficiencies. They had driven ! to- other through the cocoa and watched the after-glowtaróaÉh the oil palm stems, had looked at the view from Wak Walla, and had come back to the steamer side by side in the stem of the boat, feeling as unconstrained in each other's society as though they had been friends for years. He had listened with the greatest interest to her childish S rattle, and had been delighted by her light when he had set the Cingalese boys diving for small coins. After that he took it upon himself to look after her, to lend her books, to play quoits with her in the afternoons, and' to walk with her on deck in the evenings. People soon become intimate on board ship, and they were on such good terms that the passengers began to talk about them, and Mrs. Haddon had a bet with a gentleman who sat next her at dinner that Mr. Armstrong and the pretty Australian would be engaged before they reached Marseilles. It was when they got into the Red Sea that the ladies began to be a little kinder to Janie. Her remark about the lawyers had set Mrs. Haddon upon a trail, and it was not long before she discovered that Frank Calderwood was the nephew of Colonel Calderwood, of Calderwoods, in Yorkshire, that the Calderwoods were an old family, and that the estate was worth £10,000 a year; that the next heir, Frank's father, was a brainless ne'er-do-well banished by his relations in Australia, who was quite ready to entertain Colonel Calderwood proposal of the payment of a sum of money in consideration that he and his son should resign their claims, and that Frank Calderwood, not altogether willing to sell his birthright, was now on his way to England in the hope of effecting some arrangement more ' advantageous to himself. Mrs. Haddon thought it quite likely that Colonel Calder- I wood might take a fancy to this handsome v\'/â&c; ^kcte^#J^*&u;&!e$ktA ¿z?%4ïa&sk;> young fellow and might not be indisposed to welcome him as his heir.' There was no doubt that little James in her very ignorance and simplicity had a fascination for man and might be welcome, too, as an element of life at Calderwoods./¡Under such circumstances, her manner and her wardrobe would soon undergo revision, and Janie might prove a desirable English acquaintance. So Mrs. Haddon took Janie under her wing at Sues and when they got into the canal and the nights, grow cold, insisted very sweetly, and with some tact in providing her with a warm cloak out of her own abundant altere. Wrapped in Mrs. Haddoo'scloak. Janief sat on deck, Mr. Armstrong generally beside her. How strange and dream-like it seemed, to glide" between those low white banks, with the curious life of the desert showing itself in glimpses on each side of them-a string of camels, a native village, a water wheel, a party of Arabs in their blue gowns, a group ox palma, a mirage, and those glorious sunsets of red and gold and purple. And then the swift falling night, and the loneliness and immensity of the vast sand plains, the stars coming out and, shining in the deep blue of space-it was all wonderful and poetic, and the poor little butterfly Janie, who had hitherto fluttered through life untouched by any of the stronger emo- tions and usually able to forget her worst trouble in childe play, inexpressibly sad denied. Her frivolous chatter was- silenced for a while. Somehow of late days Armstrong noticed that she had talked and laughed less, and, he had wondered what was the cause. This evening, when suddenly A deck lamp. just lighted, swung round the mast by which their seats were set, Mr. Armstrong, to his surprise, saw that her eyes were full of tears. "What is the matter ?" he asked, bending over the army of her long basket chair, " ron ' haven't been ' like yourself lately. You're crying-Janie-I can't bear to see you said. Tell me what it never " It's nothing, and I'm not crying Faltered Janie. " Yes you are. You're unhappy. And when you first came on board you were so G y - always laughing. You haven't sighed all today. Janie-do you mind my calling you Janie P" "Noise like it." "Tell me what it is in the voyage that has made you unhappy. " There 's nothing in the voyage. It has been beautiful." "Yes," heard softly beautiful in- deed." " I've been ridiculously happy. I have loved the voyage." "You have been happy. Oh, I'm so glad. And we have been a great deal together. Janie, and perhaps it's that have had something to do with making you happy or unhappy. Have I ?" " Unhappy P" "N-no" She shook her head. "Happy. thenF' "Yes. But don't you see?" " No. If it isn't the voyage and it isn't me, what is it?" " It's the end the end of everything. I-I like this life. I was forgetting all about things. I was sailing away away as I always wanted to, Sailing away' to a new country altogether. I didn't think about what I was to do when I got there. And now we are nearly there I'm only a stupid little silly. I'm not fit to impress people, and Frank isn't much good either. He and I will be regular new chums among those grand relations. They'll look down upon us, and perhaps turn us out of doors" "That I'm sure they won't do. Yon dear, little helpless woman; you'll win your way into their hearts." "Do you really think so. But I don't know- anything. I've never been to a dinner party in my whole life. Tm nothing, but a bush savage and you, see we are beggars. I don't suppose you know, but you see Dad was sent out to Australia because he was a shingle loose. Dad always has been a shingle loose. Yes ! he is queer 1 , Then Uncle Martip's boy died, and a lawyer wrote something to Dad, and ever since then We have had an allowance, paid quarterly; but Dad gets hold of it, and it all gone before one of us can grab enough for a neWs frock. Uncle Martin hates Dad, and Mrs. Briggs says that old lawyer' wants to do Dad and frank out of their rights, and it was Mrs. Briggs who talked to Frank about it, and advised us to come straight home and eke them by surprise. " I think Mrs. Briggs was quite right, and it is very likely when your uncle seen 'you and your brother he may entirely change his mind. Gordon Janie, tell me Sure." "I don't think there is anything more to all I'm frightened. I'm frightened of Lunt Sophia and Uncle Martin and that Id lawyer and-the whole -lot. I'm so may. I never felt so lonely at any time i my life before, not even when I was dreadfully unhappy and need to are strong moonlight nights and sit on a leg by the Pelican Swamp, and listen to the Hebrews and the native dogs, and the pawpaws, and I wish I was dead." The words tumbled out in gasps. Janie was nearly crying again. Mr. Armstrong possessed himself of her hand and pressed it tenderly. " Don't cry my dearest. You needn't be lonely. Yon need never feel lonely, as long as I am alive, Jane." Janie wrenched her hand away. "You mustn't. Oh, I know what you are going to say. Mrs. Briggs told me." " Mrs. Briggs told you what ?" "That men would make love to me, and that I mustn't let them." "I'm not making love to you, Janie. Never mind Mrs. Briggs. I love you. Do you understand, Janie. That's altogether different from making love.'" "in it?" I want you to be my wife. I'm in earnest. I love you so that I can't live without you. I'll take care of you. It needn't matter to you what the grand relations in England say to you. I'm rich enough to give you everything you can want. Only say that you care for me a little." Was it Janie Calderwoed's voice that answered ? It was the voice of a woman brought suddenly face to face with a great reality and sobered into almost tragic solemnity. "I can't say that," she answered very low. He, too, was sobered. " You mean that JO i dont care for me ?"' "I mean," she began and stopped ; " I Stern," she began again desperately, M that it is all a horrible mistake." (To be concluded on Wednesday.) *&*"£'% &i;*¿tL-*^te&A; ^&2Í¿^'.¿¿AJ&-AL?
