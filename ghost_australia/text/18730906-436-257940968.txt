It was close upon «)evpn o'clock, and scarcely a lighted wiodoVglimmered upon the deserted village street?, bpt-half-way between the Hall and the Black Bear, tlio two pedestrians met a man wearing a horsemanV cloak, and muffled to the chin, with' the show-flakes lying white uponhieiiat'andshoulders.. .

It-was half an (lour before Darrell- Markham end Sauiuel Pecker left the Hall, and the Black Bear gave signs of shutting up for the night. The few customers, who had been drinking and talking together since sis or seven o'clock, strolled out into the snow, leaving the house together for the sake of one another's company, and the business of the inn was done. J be one waiter, or Jack-of-all-tratles of the establishment, prepared to shut up the house ; and, as the first step towards doing so, opened the front door and peered out into the darkness to see what soit of night it was. As he did so, the biting winter breeze blew an upon him, extinguishing the candle in his liand, and also putting out the two lights in th$4>ar. " What are you doing there, Joseph ?"' Mrs Pecker exclaimed sharply. "Come in, and chut up the place." Joseph was about to obey, when a horseman galloped up to the door, and.springing from his horse, looked into the dimly lighted iiatl. • .- : " Why, you're all in the dark here, good people," he said, stamping bis feet Bnd shaking itlie snow from his shoulders. " What's the matter/" Mrs Sarah Pecker was stooping over the red embers, trying to relight one of the candles. "Can you tell me the way to Compton Hall, my good friend ?" said the traveller to Joseph thewaj'er *' Squire'Markhanfs that was." " Ay, Squire Markham's that was." " The waiter gave lie necessary diiections, which were, simple, enough. "Good," said the stranger; "I shall go on foot-; so do you fetch tbe ostler and give Inm charge of my bone. The animal's dead Lest, and a good feed of corn." The waiter burned Tiff to find the ostler, who wasaBleep'in a loft over die stables. The stranger, strode up to the bar, jn ^be interior of which Mrs Pe<ier was Still struggling with the refractory wick of the tallow.candle. . , " You seem to have a difficult job withthat light/ipa^m*-he said; " but'peihaps you'll make as short,work ofit as you can, and give me a glass of brandy, for my very vitals are frozen with' ti twenty-mile fide' through the snow." e'- Vi- There was something- in the stranger's voice, which reminded Sarah' Pecker of eot^e voice that - she knew; only that it was deef«r and gruffer than that other voice. She succeeded ac.lagt in lighting the candle -and, placing it in front.-of the bar between lierSeJf.apt} ;the traveller, took up a wine glass for the brandy. - ... • " A tumbler, '0 tum.ble.r, tna'stn,*' iremon- «trated .the stranger; V this is no. weather for 1 •drinking spirits out of B thimble." The man's face was BO' shaded' by bi6 slouched hut, .and- further concealed by the thick neckerchief muffled about his throat, that-fre-was utterly irreoogniaable in the dim light of Sarah Petjker'e obe. tallow candle ; but as lie took the glass of brandy from Sally's hand, lie pushed-his Jiat off his forehead, and lowered his neckwohief in .order to drink. He threw hact'tis head as hn swallowed the Jast drop of the fieryiiquor, .then throwing MM Pecker the price of the , brandy, he bade her a hasty good-night, and strode out ot'-'the l i o u s e .
