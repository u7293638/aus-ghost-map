Handball. The first round of the handball tourna- ment for the trophies presented by Messrs, O'Farrell and Fishburn commenced last Saturday at the Rising Sun Ball Court, Elizabeth-street. The first match was between Flanagan and Singleton V. Wal- ters and Kerr, the latter two being clearly overmatched, and never had the ghost of a chance from the start. The next match was Simpson and Halpin V. Maguire and H. Edwards, and proved to be of a much more interesting character. The former two conceded their opponents 15 aces of a start, and at half-time had got up to within four of them. But Simpson forcing the play in the latter half of the game , on his opponents won a good game by 12 aces. The first round will finish next Saturday, when O'Farrell and M'Inerney will play Collins and Matheson, and Hayes and Skerse will play W. Edwards and Stuart.
