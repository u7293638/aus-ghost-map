MUSICAL SOCIETIES. TO THE FENWICK THE HERALD.

a musical revolution in Great Britain, and that is turning out a hundred efficient choris- ters for every ten trained by other means, is at least 800 years old My friend evidently mistakes the Tonic Sol fa 'notation for the Tonic Sol fa * method "Rea vs vo this difficulty, ' says he " substituting the old no ation for the new fangled notion and in a comparatively she at period you would have springing into existence vocal societies worthy of the name Here, then is an opening for Air younger and his professional brethren who object to Tonic Sol-fa, to show what they can do by other methods Most of the children, who have been instructed in vocal music by that sys em leave school at too early an age to learn much of the difficult ' old notation But a good foundation has been laid for others to build upon And why has not this been done If, instead of meeting at a meth d which few professional musicians care to inquire, into, from a mistaken idea that it would interfere either with their own musical or pecuniary success, they had been content to take up the pupils knowledge where they found it, and lead him on to higher branches of study, the end hinted at by Mr Younger would have been attained 1 ing acre I have neither time nor space to pursue this subject further- at present, but I would commend the following extract from a recent authority to the attention of Mr Younger, and and others who may feel an enters t in the diffusion of music among the people -f "We have been able to watch many singing ela. sea taught on both notations, and have no he nation whatever in saying that, for teaching vocal music, Mr Curwen's (the Tonic Sol fa) notation is incomparably superior to the ordinary one It has hold its on a for more than to enter years now and has probably made as many singers in that time, in our own country, as have been made by all other agencies put t gether during the rest of the century the old musical n Station, with all its defects, is too widely known and to deeply- rooted to be super ceded by Mr Curwen a but among, those who value the spread of music among our people in it than the preservation intact of an antiquated forms who in fact love music for its own sake, and not for the sake of its mere h k and shell Mr Curwen's method and notation must (and most hearty appreciation -Little 'Music,' in Chambers's Information for the People, 5th edition, 1875 The suggestion of your correspondent " Amateur, that the clio) us, soloists, and instrumental s should be said f r their services has certainly, so far as the list are concerned, the advantage of novelty to commend it If tin is the water s idea, of what constitutes an amateur musician-on who studies the art for the love of it plus the past need not any further discuss the point with him, for we should never seen the gentleman of world-wide reputation ' is, I fear, at present a somewhat mythical personage At all events, judging from the last sentence of your car- to pondent s letter, he is not likely to assist us much unless like the " amateur ' chorus singers, he is well paid for his services But, Sir I trust this discussion will not be allowed to terminate in mere talk, and in order that we may get something attempted ' which may lead eventually to "something done, I beg to make the following proposition from the interest with which the practice of Mozart's Two 6th Mass has been regarded by those who have under taken to perform it-not perhaps, in a style hitherto unattempted in the colonies, ' as your paper stated on Monday last but as well as we can do it with the materials at our disposal I am inclined to think that the production of other great works will be equally welcome to real amateur musicians As soon therefore, as the was is disposed of I invite ladies and gentlemen who are willing to cooperate with me to assist in the performance of It is in a Creation and afterwards (at Christmas) the No side " Let those who cannot assist v vocally or instrumental do so by becoming honorary members, or sub tenders towards a guarantee fund for providing the neces- sary expenses of the first one or two concerts should the receipts fall sho t of the expenditure By these means I believe, a beginning may be made in an undertaking' which will, I trust, have a fair chance of ultimate success and which will, at all events, proÂ« sent us from becoming utterly stagnant in the study of choral music Apologising for trespassing so largely on your space, and on your readers' time and patience, I am, Sir i oura JAMES C.
