STRANGE CONDUCT ' OF A TRAMP. THE \SUPPEESSION OF YICE. , Mrs. Elizabeth. Grannis, a New York lady of great wealth, and president of the Ladies' League for the Suppression of Vice, was entertaining the members of the .league1 at her- house on a recent afternoon, when the premises were invaded by a drunken tramp, who walked into the basement and pro ceeded to take off one by one various articles of his clothing. When the last vestige of apparel had been .cast aside, the intruder calmly walked upstairs and appeared an uninvited guestjin the midst of the gathering. The ghost of Banquo could not have startled them more. The* fifty ladies, engaged in devising ways, and means of reforming the wickedness of a degenerate age, set up a succession of shrieks that drowned the whistling of the loco motives on the elevated railway. The tramp, saying that he was very tired and only needed sleep, calmly stretched himself upon the carpet and prepared for rest. A police man was promptly upon the scene, and the tramp will be hailed before a ^magistrate to explain, if _ he can, his strange conduct. ?
