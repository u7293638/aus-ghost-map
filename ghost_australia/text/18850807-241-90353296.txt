Brother Gardner on Progress. " While dis am de the aige of progress," said Brtoher Gardner, as he rose up with a force of 6SO pounds to the square inch, "do not progress too fast. Dar am such a thing as puttin' too much'sugar on a sweetcake. " Frinstance, progress has car'ied upipast de pint whar' wo kin stuff ole'hats an' coats in de winders in place of broken panes; but dean' jump to the conclushun dat you' has got to run in debt for lace curtains to keep up wid the time, " Progress has car'ied us past de pint whar' men' believe in ghosts an' goblins, but dean' emagine dat you am called upoh to shaw yer smartness by ridiculin' any of the onsartin passages in de Bible. "Progress has car'ied us 'past de pint whar' religun forbids a man to enjoy his self, but dean' feel called upon to w'ar yer hoofs off in dancin,' or to get so used to a pack of keerds that you shuffle yer knife an' fork as soon as you sot down at de table." " Progress has car'ied us past the pint of billin' 'taters wid the hides on, but deyi has got to be paid fur all the same, an' you musn't judge of a man's character by h'arin' him order Saratoga chips." " Progress no longer permits our sods to w'ar out our ole doze, but when yon kbtch a young man hoein' co'n with a broadcloth on his legs an' a paste diamond in his biled shirt you kin make up yer mind dat Injun meal am gwine to take a rise of 50 cents on a hundred." "Progress demands dat our chill'en be eddecated, but bekase yer boys kin figger cube root an' yer gals chatter 'French, doan' miss the chances to l'arn de fust a good trade, an' de second de art of bakin' bread an' cookin' bacon."
