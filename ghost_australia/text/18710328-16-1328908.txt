He had, in company with his coadjutors, cleared over an acre and a half of land, and they had Bown various classes of seeds He was some to say, however that the plants had thriven very badly through some cause There were two classes of soil on the island, the first was of a light sandy nature, and the other a rich black i negotiable soil Mr Hill, of the Gardens to whom he had shown specimens of the soil, had informed him that the latter class would, with piopcrdnimugo and thorough cultivation pion very productive He had also said that the failure of the seeds proceeded from their being planted in the wrong season Since Mr Fuller had been where there was not the slighest doubt that he had earned his blood by the sweat of his brow With his own hands, and with only a tin dish as an instrument, he had dammed back the waters of a creek, so as to have a supply of fresh water in all seasons He (Mr Buckle) had tasted this water, and he must say that it was the best he had ever drunk in Queensland. He had also constructed another dam which was originally intended for a private bath, and also a sum sufficiently capacious for twenty persons to bathe in The natives of this island had always borne the name of being very savage, and also treacherous, and perhaps there were good reasons to give them this name The fact that they were cannibals was proved incontestably During his (Mr Buckle's) residence Iberia, one of thofmestjoung men on the island was with his mother destroyed, and there was very strong proof that the flesh had been also eaten He had, however, observed , very many of acts of natural affection among the natives which he did not expect He had also I observed that some of the ladies were do truth of the little finger on the left hand, and on in I quiring the reason for this mutilation was told that it w us a sign that he damsel had been led to a tholivmetical ultur llnslittloiingci wasgiven 1 the husband as a proof of the affection in which his wife held him, and was not a compulsory portion of the marriage ceremony but entirely optional with lin lady Mr H ullor taught two clauses of the natives daily one in the morning and one in the afternoon Some of the children were now able to write letters of the alphabet, and make figures on slates there was also an advance class, which three pupils attended Lennie, Tommy, and Tobio Lennie had made very rapid progress, and was now able to read the New Testament with comp » u tively little assistance He had asked Mr haller if the blacks had any idea of a Supreme Being, and he had told him that the belief in a superior being was general among them They also beloved in the existence of an evil spirit, whom they called " Mellong " They ascribed all their troubles to him, and be loved his mission was to annoy and bother them in a private conversation which he had with them they fully corroborated those statements, and he also found that they believed very implicit!) in ghosts, whom they called ' Mother mother" During his stay he had some very interesting conversations with them, and they had treated him very kindly They had treated him to some excellent crabs, but their principal food was a room called the native honeysuckle and a large cockle called by them " Barong " Mr. Fuller had taught them to sing some hymns, and they could now louder several in a very pleasing and effect ive manner He had not the least doubt that Mr Fuller, despite all the dangers of his position, and all the deprivation he had to undergo, would continue his work upon the island, and that he was prepared for everything that came before him He had put the question to him that in the event of his station being broken open, and his provisions robbed, or even his life endangered, what course he would pursue and he had answered that he would still persevere Hitherto, although he had exposed his life in a most perilous manner, he had been protected by the providence of God, and expressed the fullest confidence in the blacks by whom he was surrounded His provisions were exposed nightly to robbery, but not a single native had interfered with them. He concluded by expressing a hope that some practical measures would be taken for the sustentation of the mission, as its importance and usefulness had now been clearly proved The Ciiaiesian said that they intended to form a society free from all sectarian bias, but simply with the object of sending the Gospel among the aboriginals, and upon the same basis as the London Missionary Society Mr Davidson then read the rules of the proposed association The Rev B G Wilson moved the first rose but on, us follows -"That this meeting recog meet the necessity of an effort being made to spread the knowledge of Christ among the (heathen) aborigines of this colony, and proposes that the Queensland Aboriginal Missionary Society be formed for that object, based upon the regulations now lead for approval, and that an adjourned meeting be held in May, to consider the confirmation of the plan." The resolution was seconded by Mr. Hooker, and carried unanimously The Rev. J. G Hausmann moved the second resolution, as follows " That Mr J C Foote be treasurer, Mr E Hooker bo secre story, and the Boys B G Wilson, E Griffith, C Ogg, J. Buckle, S Savage, and Messrs Milne, A Davidson, J S. Swan, K D Davidson, and V Robertson, to the committee, in accordance with the fifth regulation and that they be requested to communicate to with ministers and other parties not resident in Brisbane, with the object of inviting them to co-operate as members of the society) " The motion was seconded J)) Mr Roqees, and carried unanimously The doxology was then sung, and the meeting terminated with prayer A collection was made at the door in aid of the object, and a considerable sum realised
