THE JURIES BILL. In the House of Commons, on February 17, the Attorney-General, in moving the second reading of this bill, said that some time back the 6th of George IV. was the only governing statute the subject of juries, but, by the Common Law Procedure Acts of 1862 and 1867, and other recent enactments alterations had been made in the law, so as a had been extremely difficult of Into yours to find out what were the liabilities of different persons with regard to juries, and to satisfactorily adminis- ter the law No d mht, the defects in the law has resulted in a considerable deterioration in the character of James, and juries had not, for the past ten or t enty years, commanded the respect which those who were in favor of trial by jury wished to see them enjoy The general object of the measure was to raise the qualifications of jurors, to do away as far as possible with the personal residence of the present law, which was attended with great individual hard- ship, and to get rid of the practice, very inconvenient and he might say o'on corrupt, which prevailed, in connection with the bringing of juries into court (Heir, hour ) In twomattors only he would take the son, of the House on the decisions of the committee, and, if he could, reverse them. The number of the jury had been, as might be expected, the subject of considerable discussion He thought it important that the number should be reduced There was no particular magic in the number of twelve , it did not obtain in any country but England, and even here it was not universal. It did not obtain in some of the largest and most prosperous of our colonies, and if did not obtain in our county courts whose questions were decided by a jury of live with great satisfaction '1 Those who know the history of our law were perfectly aware that the number of twelve was not the creation of state or of any particular wisdom, and was arrived at almost as a matter of chance The two subjects of great importance upon which he ventured to differ from the committee were firstly, the com- position of the ordinary jury, and, secondly, the question of unanimity (Hear, both ). In the bill as it stood he provided for a definite proportion of men of the higher or educated elliss on each jury, and he should do his boat to revise the contrary decision of the select committee 'The provision which he made in this respect VVIIB home out by the recommendation of two Common law Oom missions and by that of the Judicature Commission. The Common Law Commission, when reporting in 1853, said, " On every trial there should be an admixture of jurymen of the class from which special jun lea are now taken In those recommendations there was nothing now, because down to the time of Queen Elizabeth the distinction between common and special juries was unknown, and down to that time, if not later, in every case of the slightest importance the Sherd was directed to select good jury" -which meant that it was to be a jury on which there were persons above the common run of men Many of the just attacks that had been made on the administration of our law by juries had arisen from the neglect of the under ghosts, and the neglect of responsible persons to administer the law was it now st odd It was suggested that the jury book should be made out indiscriminately frontiers of both sorts spoil and common but that system would be exceedingly moon venient, liiuBiniich as common jurors constituted an overwhelming majority in utmost every place except the City of London He would give a few figures to show the proportion of special and common jurors Sussex common jurors, 7500, special jurors, 197 Kent common jurors, 15,600, special, 100 Lancashire common jurors, 12,550, special, 1100. Mary labour common jurors, 3030 , special, 300 St Pim ci as common jurors, 6000, special, 50 Paddington common jurors, 1300, special, 220 'therefore, to suppose that by the system of indoor lininato selection they would secure the presence of educated men on every jury was entirely at variance with the facts of the case. It might also SO happen, under the in- disci drainage system, that in criminal cases they would have a jury of the lower sort trying a person of the upper north, or vice versa, and in civil cases they might have something of the Ellen sort, The great objection that was urged against the arrangement was that it would tend to intro- duce eliiBO prejudices into the jury box , but he thought that this would be amply provided against by securing the presence of a certain number of men of superior education upon every jury It was also part of his proposition to abolish all invidious dist nations with regard to closer apton, such as bunker, esquire, and the like, and to have no distinction except a rating qualification, those below a certain building to be described by the letter C, and those above by the letter S With regard to matters which were likely to give rise to class feeling, care would be taken that such matters should not be decided by one class alone. He was always glad to appeal to authority, and according to the practice in Scotland with regard to criminal proceedings whenever there were 15 jurors, 10 were common and 5 special jurors, but at the present day, in Scotland, in all cases where there were 12 jurors, 8 were common and 4 special 'the other matter which he wished to ask the House to consider was unanimity All he could say was that, with all respect for our ancestors, to insist upon unanimity seemed to be some what barbarian (Hear, hear) He could not see why it should be necessary to have twelve men agree in one opinion Why should one wrong-headed man be able to stop the cool stores of any number of reasonable men ? He had, however, no definite view as to what the proportion should be to give effect to a verdict, and would leave it to be hereafter decided. There was one exception with regard to unanimity In cases of treason, treason felony, or murder, the number of jurors would be the BUHIO us at pro Bent, and it would be necessary that they should be unanimous If he were asked why he made the exception, he could not perhaps give a long o d reason, but it was made on account of a deep rooted feeling as to the profound and im- measurable sanctity of human life, which he did not wish should be taken away more easily than under the existing law (Hear, hear.) He ought, perhaps, to state that he had the advantage of having the bill drawn by a gentleman possessing a unique knowledge of the subject he mount Mr Eric, the Associate of the Common Pleas If the House should pass the bill he ventured to think it would he found to contain the whole law upon the subject (Hear, hear ) After a brief discussion, in which objection was made to some of the details of the bill, the second reading was carried, opposition being withdrawn on the Attorney General promising not to hurry on the bill when it got into committee The Times holds that the bill introduced by the Attorney-General is one of the most important measures which have been brought before Parliament for many years. The essential provision of the bill is a new classification of common and special jurors, both in counties and in the City of London. A man possessing a certain income in lands or one month, or rated on a certain rental, differing according as his parish is a place of small or large population, will be a special juror, and a lower CLUBS of proprietors and occupiers will be common j aurora. The Times thinks this UB good an arrangement as could be devised. But assuming that by the new provisions an educated and able class of men are obtained, how are these to be employed in the administration of justice? Here the Attorney- General places himself in opposition to the Select Committee and their bill. He maintained last year that the system by which all the high-class men are kept for one class of cases and all the low-class men for another is defective, and that in every case there ought to be an admixture of of the higher or special jury element, This opinion he still retains, and he will ask the House to amend the bill in accordance with it. On the whole (the Times Says), we are not disposed to believe that a composite jury would be a better tribunal than the common jury as it now exists. This, however, is a matter of minor importance in comparison with other changes which the bill - proposes. A strong case of actualinconvenienca'... in our present system ought to be made out he-" is. more so very startling a change is effected as the reduction of the number of jurors in the trial of prisoners It is also proposed that in the event of the death, illness, or default of attendance of any juror or jurors during any trial, civil or criminal, the Judge presiding at such trial shall have the power, except only on a trial for murder if he think fit, to direct that the trial shall proceed with the reduced number of jurors, provided that such number be not in any case less than five In all such cases the verdict of the remaining jurors is to be a sufficient verdict Now, if five jurors who need not even be unanimous, are to send a man to penal servitude for life, the time will have come to talk as little as possible of a British jury as the palladium of English liberty The Telegraph asserts that a more Radical bill was never brought in by a more bland rove lutionist or advocated with more dexterous rhetoric. The Attorney- General asked the House to throw over the whole jury system, the palladium of our liberties, as mildly as a county member might move the second reading of some unimportant little bill for the construction of parochial waterworks What we words such a jury system as will work well, and give the nation confidence that justice is duly administered The inconvenience which it may mines on particular classes is a matter of minor importance, and there is absolutely no other reason why a jury should be composed of seven persons rather than twelve Much more may be said for the proposal to try causes by mixed juries, some of the members being common and some special But the Attorney-General's most persuasive pleading will utterly fail to make the House sanction his third and most formidable proposal, that, in all causes which do not in volve capital punishment, juries should be allowed to decide the issue by a majority of votes, instead of being compelled to give a unanimous verdict The scheme is unworthy a lawyer of such eminence Bren the Attorney-General himself condemns it when he oom CB to capital offences for in these cases he would demand a unanimous verdict But why demand unanimity when a man is on trial for his life, if we are to waive it when his liberty throughout the whole period of his existence is at stake? The distinction would tap the public confidence in trial by jury and if that shall vanish, the days of the most valued English institution will be numbered The Post thinks there is much to be said in favor of adhering to a number which has been sanctioned by long use, and Supposing that Sir John Coleridge should be content to retain it subject to the condition that when the jury are not unanimous the decision of three fourths should prevail, the House would hardly object to an innovation for which there is so much to be said For, perhaps, would there be any strong objection to reduce the number of the jury to seven if the obligation of una Dimity were retained With respect to the composition of the jury, Sir John Coleridge was more than sustained in his view by Mr Gathorne Hardy, who went so far as to urge that in criminal cases there should be a proportion of laboring men upon the jury, in order that the accused in the not be subject to the decision of the judges who class interestS might in duce them to lean to a conviction This (the Post holds) is the most radical j proposition which has yet been made upon this subject, and, taking for example a case within recent recollection, it is not impossible that if the gas stokers had been tried by a jury composed according to the principle which Mr Hardy advocates they would have escaped a merited punishment If the policy be adopted of introducing class interests in the composition of juries, a wide door will be opened to the defeat of justice. The Standard, without absolutely condemn ing the principle of a reduction in the number of persons composing a jury, doubts whether the number seven could be adopted consistently with the proper administration of justice The standard is also inclined to doubt whether the system of " composite juries" would answer in practice whether it would not be found that the social difference between the " special " and " common " elements, broadly marked as it would be by the statute, would not tend to arouse jealousies and dissensions in the jury box The proposal to take the verdict of the majority will need very careful consideration The Daily News says it is hard to decide whether any system whatever ought to be changed until we know exactly what we are to change it for The Attorney- General did not give the House any very decided exposition of his views with regard to the reform which he proposes to introduce, and it certainly did not encourage the House to place full confidence in the undefined reforms when the Attorney-General announced that he would be afraid to trust them in the more serious cases The Attorney-General has not made up his own mind, and until he has done 30 the House can hardly tell him what it thinks of the measure HER MAJESTY'S surveying corvette Choi lenger, Captain George S Nares, sailed from Madeira on February 5 for Teneriffe and the West Indies, in prosecution of her scientific voyage Between the Straits of Gibraltar and Madeira several very successful hauls were made with the fishing trawl at depths exceeding two miles The soundings obtained between Gibraltar Straits and Madeira show that a deep basin of 2000 fathoms depth exists to the westward of the African coast, cut off on its northern and western sides by a bank of shallower water which runs out from Cape St Vincent on the coast of Portugal, and embraces Madeira, but having a narrow entrance between Madeira and the Canary Islands This deep sea continues the chain of basins extending from the Black Sea to the westward through the Mediterranean, which divided by a shallow ridge between Sicily and Africa, forms, as it were two lakes, the shallow ridge at the Straits of Gibraltar separating them from the newly discovered Madeira GuK Pho temperatures taken on the passage from Gibraltar to Madeira, considered relatively in con junction with those previously taken by Her Majesty's surveying ships Porcupine and Shearwater prove that the summer heat affects the water to the depth of about 600 feet, below which depth the temperature is uniform all the year round from the experiments already made on board the Challenger, it appears that between the depths of one and a quarter and two miles the temperature is everywhere constant at only a degs above freezing point A Kind Japanese paper is now being published in London under the imposing name of the Tai Sei Munbun, or Great Western News The first number boB appeared It is edited by a Japanese resident in London the prospectus says -The immense advance which Japan is making in material progress renders the present moment opportune for the establishment of a newspaper in the metropolis of the West, to serve as a means of communicating further knowledge of Western arts and policy among the millions of Japanese who are now desirous of learning all they can of foreign nations It is proposed, therefore, to publish immediately a newspaper, which shall clearly reflect the opinions of Japanese who have SOLD the world and learnt European languages for the benefit of their countrymen in their Fatherland It will be the object of the editors to represent fairly the condition of the European nations in their political, moral, and religious aspects, and to select for comineo dation such arts and inventions as they have become acquainted with in their experience The paper will be illustrated, so as to convey the most vivid ideas of the objects explained, and to simplify description. Adurtiecmentsto a limited extent will be received in any European language These will be translated care fully into Japanese under the superintendence of Professor Summers, of King's College, who will act as co editor A circulation of 1000 copies will be guaranteed for the first three months, after which probably a larger number will be required A portion of this number will be circulated among the 700 Japanese residents in Europe and America, and the remainder will be forwarded to Nagasaki, Osaka, Yokohama, and Todo, for circulation in the Japanese Empire.
