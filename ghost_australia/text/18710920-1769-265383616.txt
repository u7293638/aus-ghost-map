EOW IT HAPPENED. BV JOHN HAY. I pray you, pardon me, Elsie, Aud staile that frown away That dims the light of your lovely face As a thunder-cloud the day. I really could uot help it,— Before I thuught, 'twas done,— Aud those great gray eyes flashed bright and cold, Like an icicle in the £un. I was thinking of the summers . , When we were boys and girls. And wandered in the blossoming wo«ds. And the gay wiuds mowed with your curls. And you seemed to me the same little girl I kissed in t te el ier path,. I kissed that little girl's lip?, and alas ! I have roused a woman's wrath. -There is not much to pardon— For why were your lips so red i The blonde hair fell a shower of gold From the proud, provoking head. And the beauty that flashed from the splendid •yes. Aud played round the tender mouth, : Hushed over my souHikea warm sweet wind That blows from the fragrant south. Andjwhere, after all, is the Itarm done? ' 1 believe we were madi to he gay, ;. And all of yauthnot given to Love Is vainly squandered away. - And strewn .through life's low labours, Like gold in the desert sands, Are love's sweet kisses and sighs and,vows And the<lasp (if cliiiging.bands. Aud when yon are old and lonely. In Memory's magic shine Youwill see on you*- tbin and wasting hands, Ivke gems, those kisses ofanuie. And when you muse at evening. . At the souiid.of some finished name, The ghost of my kisses shall touch your lips Anil kindle your-beart to flame. •
