:THE DEGAY QF BXTKAL.-TRADITI03S T | It is certain that, with our great and advancing sociar changes, the ' old memories and traditions which have been disappearing fast. Our Sibyl witli her volumes of local history, is repeating thegxpejig^cecjof^fer prophetie preds cessor. 3!he reason is not far to seek.; Let anyone plunge into the'depth "of even a moderately remote country diswest and north-west, and eschewing j -every highway Tvith: a trace of Macadam about "it, search out the ancient ways to which old maps ,pr .his ,own eyes may; guide him—the main lines of packhorse communication or the cross-roads which led to market. He will probably soon discover, when his path touches some modern road, a >wooden,; receptacle; resembling ha^^pah'^ Vnailed j on a gatepost or living in a tree ; andlie will rightly divine that tliis is meant for a rustic post-office. Let him, after, the first inevitable smile at the ways of a primitive people, cany back* his thought to their life in the days before this "scent" of the world's " paper, chiise'' ;was ,laid, tliere, -and. when' itheir! only roads were the old tracks which he has been following. The people cer- ' tainly coul^not ,write^ • For thegiBbst' part, they^cpvi.]eSrS)t%eaa.€ither; if-iiiey • .could, the. jBible and Prayer-book,, and the^roadsh'eets";pf cai-ols or' -of, pongs ' from the pack 'oftlie infi-equent peiJlar, made up the bulk'of .their available; literature j while wonderful prescriptions for the-cui;e of rheumatism or of ' the stone rnighV' be found preserved hi quaint M.S. on a fly-leaf in the singinggallery. _ After the day's labour, by the fai-m kitchen tire, in the summer twilight or the long winter evening, almost their only menta| pd "mteUebtiial resource would lie in tellingf over the old stories Andsa^^^nd,.. m^singing the old balMsiaMiiijmiesr ^Subh educa^" ^iqn-as-there -was^current would'rmi ':in" •;the ,isame; grooves, \ The. baby must be sung Tto sleep-; the restUsb. or fractious child must be''^otlied.by'a; stoiy • the dame would tea\h tlie carol which she knew, and the pr%er %hieh\she herself had once learnt.
