A SOMNAMBULIST'S STORY. Tbte following sfccry was told in a recent number of Cassell's Satur day JOURNAL by a sleep-walker.— One night I left the house, asleep, of course, without disturbing any one. I made my way to a summer house, a place I visited so often in my sleep that it was always the first to be searched whenever I was missed. It appeared that at the time I reached the doorway of the summer- house, from whieh I could easily overlook the road on which the garden abutted, a terrible tra gedy was about to be enacted. The house nearest ours was occupied by an old maiden lady and her nephew. On this particular night the ne phew had been to a party at some distance returning towards home between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning—-just at the time I was taking my walk abroad. As he reached the roadway at the end of the garden, he was set upon by two ruffians, and after a severe strug gle he was overpowered. The rob bers, for such they were, were about to rifle the young man's pockets when I reached the end of the gar den. Owing to the white dressing gown, and the pale, mild light of the moon shining on me, I sup posed they believed I was a ghost or something equally uncanny. Anyhow, my parents say that when they arrived on the spot—having missed me and at once started in search—the two men were hurrying away, casting terror-stricken glances behind them. The young man, although seriously injured, even tually recovered, and now says he owes his life to me. The curious part of the matter is that, although I was, when discovered, leaning over the wall, apparently looking at the injured man, I had not the slightest recollection of the affiair when awakening.
