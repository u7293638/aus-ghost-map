CURRUN!' LITERATURE. Mr Chrk Russell is likely to have n formidable competitor, in Mr Edmund Downey, whose Anchor li atch yams (Tins lej Brothers), tuough beanrg marks of hasty and inexpert composition, arc a capital col lection of sea stones, with the real ault flavour. Mr Downcj, thoutfi he docs not pretend to write ot storms and shipwrecks >vith the fervoui and spirit of Mr Russell, has more humour and ease His characters, also, though slightly sketched, have more reality than those of the elder writer, and do not give one the idea ol being mere dummies on which to hang a stori otadvcntuic 'I hero is nothing more difficult than to write of the sea and of suilora in a manner to interest landsmen, while keeping to truth and avoid mg technicalities A gicat manj who do not know u davit trom a (lead eye, and who get contused among those nautical manauvres which sailors who write love to tell ol, are able to appre- ciate a good sea storj, well told 'J hele is an endless lund of romanee about the ocean, and an exhiiusllesb tiiscinatiun about the mamulle calling Sudoi- mc among tho most imaginative and buiuoioiis ot men, mut love a jam as much us to be the subject ol one.

Yet any one who want« to know about tigers und bears and snakes, not to speak of leas fearsome wildfowl, may be honestly recom- mended to General Rice's book. The HayacUy and Morahly of Plants, by J. 13 Taylor (Chatto ar.d Windus) is a title which will startle a good many people who have not completed their own evolutionary process in respect of knowing about evo- lution. We have heard of the "low cunning of tho potato" in sending out its rootlets to every gleam of light, but that was in joke. Mr. Taylor is very much ni earnest, and writes with imperturbable gravity of the emotions, the desires, nu), the pussions, of plants. He confisses, at the outset, to some little doubt whether the term morality can be rightly applied to any but conscious agents, but he gets over this, which soma may con- sider a rather formidable difficulty, with an ease which cannot but leave us amazed at the logie of [scientific persons That plants aro sensitive, und do, or seem to do, things vv lucn look like the possession of some kind of reason, or, nt least, of instinct, we havo long known Dirwin spoke of the tips of radicles as acting like the brain of one of the lower animals-receiving impressions and directing mov ementa Hut Mr Ta) lor, in his enthusiasm out Darwins Darwin It ia only within the last few 3 ears, he tells us, that vv e have wakened up to understand what won dciful objects plants ure We ure afraid that most of us ure still in the shadow of ignorance as to the mental and moral capacities of plants Ileio, for instance, we havo the most startling prouts of the possession b3 vege tables of something ver) like 11 mind, not to say a conscience lu ta< t, if we may take Mr lujlor us the exponent of the latest science, there is onl) a dilleienee ofdegrie between Shakspi are an 1 11 cabbage '1 he phjsical basis of hie, winch is piotoplasm, is the same for plants as tor animals Hie lowi st mumtlrulc lins a structure scartclj to be ili8tiiie,uisht 1 tiom the highest legt table In the matter ot uitelli,tnco it muj be even doubted vv hethcr some plants mc not supe nor to some anímala Certainlj they do the wildest as nell as the m st sensible things As lorsu.ucitv there leally seems tobe no limit to the powers of plants Mr lujlor eveneiedits the primiose with ' diplomat!
