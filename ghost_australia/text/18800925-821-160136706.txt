THE TOURIST. MRS. BROWN IN AUSTRALIA. By ARTHUR SKETGHLEY. THE ADELAIDE SHOW. I'm sare the way as I've been a goin about in Addlehead is enuf to turn any one's brain,-for. tho' it aint large its one of them places as is lifce the Tovaer of London, that interestin as a day don't seem nothink to spend there, As to Brown he's gone off his ead over this ere Sorater as took and run aground'of its own accord, as shows as arter all a capficg, nor yet ossifer, can't doing nothink with a wessel sgin er will, as Brown says is like all other fieid mates. But as to this Sorater things looks fishy. So Brown he's been down aseein arter the injins . and all manner, not as ther 'ill be much more on cr Baved, leastways fiom wot I ears I don't think so tho Brown that's close and says never a word, but only shakes is ead as shows he's got somethink in it more than meets the heye. Its lucky as I'm a livin along with Mrs. Luggins as is a cheerful party tho' give to sheddin tears in er tea over Luggins, as she says as she's missed every air of his dear ead, though a judgiti from his fotty grafh he must ave been ss bald as a billiard bill, and she aint missed much, but as a feeling art for all that poor thing. We was 'avin of our tea one Sunday wben Mrs. Luggins, as is a serous widder as 'ave kep a boardin'ouso in Addlead over a quarter of a sentry thro 'er 'usbin bein' a Life Guard as took and emmygrated when there wss troops a goin' to Orimeer, as asked me if I were a goiti' to their reglar Show.' I says if its anytbink reglar I should like to. Not as I 'ol'ds with all Shows, tho' I well remem bers a goin' with my grandmother to see quite a gal to Richardson's Show as was Bartlemy Fair always 'eld in Smithfieid, as did used to be monks, as was where cattle did used to be sold, and is naw the meat market, where parties was brort to the stake in old limes, as was hurt to a cinder for their eonsbences' sakes, as 'ave all been put down by the axe of Parly mints, and 'igh time too. I well remembers thai Bhow, as wasn't all open and above board, as the sayin' is, cos tho' some on 'em stood out side a showin' of themselves all dresBcd up, you had to pay hextra aud go Inside for to see all the play, as must 'ave been werry affectin', cos I see my grandmother a sheddin*. tears, tho' she pretended to larf, as try in' to 'ide 'em*te>*ber redicnle over a dog as went Into the water from., the winder of a 'ouso on a bridge and brought a infant cut in his mouth. As iucottrse upael 'er thro', makin' 'er recollent 'er son as was my godfather, and come to a watery end off Bombay thro' 'is wessel a fiounderin' at sea. I can't say as I recollects much about that play as we see, thro' bein' obliged to look out thro' my screams, as I've 'eard say waa orful, thro' me bein' terrified with one man a kiilin' of another behind 'is back, and then there wbb a glare of red fire, and the ghost ail in white como np thro' a 'ole, as was the murdered man reduced to a skilliuton, and other devils a comin' up, as took and collared the murderer into the flames. When I got out they give me gingerbread as was all gilt and lots of things for to comfort me, tho' I can't remember arf on 'em now. Them fairs was werry genral thro'.London, or Was all put down thro' Parlymint— a interferin as can cut eterythink down from a king to a turnpike gate, as can't neither on em be re moved without one. So I says to Mrs. Luggins as I'd think over the Show, as I did next mornin, thro' bein daberons about dresBin myself as is a climate as its hard for to suit yourself with clothes, as is only to bo esDected thro' it uot bein ever in tended for them black parties as was born in the place to wear no clothes at all, so the weather didu't matter to them as wasn't nothing better than denuded savidges, poor things, as didn't make theiraelves any more then the beasts of the field as don't wear no cloth* s. I got myself ready, and went out agreein if I went as I'd meet Mrs. Luggics at the Show. So I started, and I was a standing on the kerb stone a tryin td make ont whether it were agoin to r𝔦 UWjoaehaviri of all my best thiDgB on "tho' weather being that eol^^^i^^^^7^hb||)n9>e^s,£ee]s the *' Wellj ;I %|rt' piking up my mind as to whether I'd gblb tliiB Bhow. weather or no, a« the eayin is, for tho' hot of a' waxination disposi tion I must say I'm given to let things osculate in my mind for and against, pariikler ps the clouds were alowcrin, ahd -the durt adrivin along tho road like wild charots and 'orseg. So jest us I were athinking as I'd ave a cab, for fear of tbe raiD, up drives a gentleman, and jumps out of 'is wehicle like a grey onnd, and say to me, Oil! Mrs. BrowD, are you a ngoin to see onr Show. Well, I says, I ccrtiugly were athiuk on it. AH right, says he, I'll drive you there, and give you a ticket. Jump in. And afore I'd time to draw a breath, be telis tbe man as was driviu' to back agin tbe kerb stone as didn't give me time to think of givin' in a check, he'd took and lifted me iuto tbe carridge like a fly, as I pitched end foremost into down on my knees, and away hedrove. I'm dreadful nervous in drivin, so got np off my kneesandgets.cn to the seat, and jest then tbe carridge gave a jert, and I ketched old o the bar in front, whtre the gentleman were a set tie, to save myself. JI'.s say, b ;llo! old lady, none of that. I eaj », none of wot X Why, he say, no pinclien me. I say, me pinchen yon; never. Well, he says, you cart me a pretty decent nip under my blade bone, as is a flesh; i a:; with men. Lor, «ays I, I thought it was the hack of the seat as I'd ketched old on, for it felt sorft thro' bun padded. Ho tnrns is ead, gives a grin and a wink, and says, won't do, old gal, won't do, and bust out larfin. I drored myself up, but jeBt thf n the car give a Juroh in stoppin as pitched me backards, and afore I could say Jack Itobison, that purtyad got me ont like a bird that sudden as took my breath away. I were quite a graspin for breath, and reglar staggered, a wenderin at that man's strength. Be says, here's your ticket. I can't stop; good-bye, and urries away afore I'd time to thank im for is perliteness, tho' I mast say as I were werry much art at is a thinkin as I'd made that free as to pinch im, and the way as he'd palled me abont in gettin me ont of tbe cab was that rough as one of my shoes come off on the step. When I got inside that Show and tied mv shoe, I must say I were took back at seein sieh crowds as was lookin at parties on orseback as was ridin round a field, and jumpin over fire-bar gates, and some come croppers in firm jest, jast for all the world like a circus broke loose. There was lovely animals showed, and sich sheeps, as gentlemen was a goin round for to judge, as all seemed wool gatherin by their looks. Bat in coarse they looked solim, thro' bein judges, as was a decidin which of tbem sheep should be killed first, lestwaysl suppose so. Cos there was the Guv'nor, and the Lord Chief Justiss, and a many more aa was all judges, as shows it were a matter of life and death. There was some other werry fine nannimais specially bulls, and other beasts of pray as I aint no judge on myself, tho' I'm sure I pray as I may'nt never ave no bull arter me agin, as chivied me all across two fields as ard as I could pelt, when a stayin with my married dorter down in the country. I went over the ground like lightnin, the bull a thunderin arter me. As my bonnet bein blowed off saved my life, thro' the bull a takin it for me, and stoppin short to gore it, as proves sb he must ave been mad, for he tore it to bits as he'd ave done me no doubt but for my bonnet as cort is eye. While I got over the stile, leastways just over, when I stuck, and there I were a balanciu on the top rail, with my ead down one side and toy eels np on the other for the bull to toss, if a man ad'nt come alODg gest in time to turn the scale; for in a minnit arter my. ead was over np come the bull, a roarin like a lion, as changed is tune when he got a tap with the flail as that man were a carryin, and give it im ot over is shins, as is a tender pint with bulls the same as with us all. I see some werry nice dogs, and lovely ponies, as parties was a lookin' at, and all as tame as donkeys. I were pleased with the dogs thro' bein' that partial to animals, leastways as long as they're kep' in their place. Wot pleased me most was the flowers, as was a sight ali rg with the frnit, likewise as was lemons as big as 'arf-quartern loaves ; and eich oranges, the size of cannonbalis as wonld carry oS yonr 'ead in a jiffy, as the sayin' is, if sent with force; 'cos I've 'eird as oats if fired out of a blunderbuss stings fright* till, partikler with boys up a tree when robbin' a orchard, as always comes to a bad end and leads to poachers, as is as bad a smugglers thro' being' always the cuss of a country. I don't altogether 'old with Shows, leastways not in Ingland, as is sometimes barmaids' shows, as they 'ad at Woolwich, which Z considers brazenface W8j s. As to Baby Shows, no baby as I cared for should ever be showed like that, a bein' eBposed to the weather bless their 'arts, as might settle on its dear little lungs, besides a risk of ketchin' any thiDg from others.
