From the balcony a fl ghl of sUirs led down to the top of the cliff ; a nnrruw pub cut into the rock wound down' to lhe beach bHow. We nixli' a cuieful survey of the grounds anil , outhouses : mod the next day, at low water, ex* { plored the caw. The largcbt cave was directly under the house. It was a long, narrow | passage. extending straight sftiead from the eti» trance for severs! rod* ; tlien it abruptly Hirided | into two paths, turning to the right and left. i Both were terminated at a littfe distance l>y a I solid nail of rock.

Next day we took our fiahing tackle and rowed out toward the cliff After waiting a while to make sure no one was watobiog ui, we made for the caves. Again we went over the interior of the larger obe with apparently no better success (ban before.
