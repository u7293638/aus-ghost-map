I FOLITIÜAJL AND SOCIAL. I {BY 8.0.1 ' . THE NOMINATIONS.' -1 IForty-nine citizens of Mew South Wales nave been nominated for thu ten seats on the Federal Convention, a considerably larger number than bas been. nominated in Victoria. Why some of them decided to become candidates can be explained only on the hypothesis that they are the suhjects of colossal vanity, for they have not the ghost of a chance of belog elected. The Candidates who seem to bu the most popular in Sydney are Barton, O'Connor, M'Ml lian. Cardinal Moran, Carruthers. Brunker, Reid,. See, Wise and Copeland. The first four are pretty strongly m the running. Mr. Brun- ker does not seem to be so much favored in the metropolis as either of those four, but I »tn informed he has a very large following in the country districts. At present Mr. Reid's chances are not particularly bright, but his friends say that he will alter that state of things before the election takes place. Copeland and See have, 1 think, more support than Wise, who has not made the impression here that I hoped he.would make. As for Bruce Smith-a very able man-hardly anybody mentions bis name, and if he does not ranve about pretty actively during the next three weeks, he will be very badly left. Speaker Abbott also attracts very little notice, but far all that be will, because of his position, poll well. The present signs .'are that the sec- tarian element will be strongly in evidence at the election, yet it is widely believed that Cardinal Moran will get a large Protestant yote. The Cardinal intends, within the next few days, to prepare an elaborate reply to all the objections that have been made to his candidature. ' . . .
