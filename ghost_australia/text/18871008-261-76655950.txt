Warwick-Thane's Creak Bailway In the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday afternoon, tb« Minister tor Wgrks asked We to again postpone the motioo, of which ho bad previously given notice, fot tbe adoption of the plan, section, and book of reference of the proposed Warwick-Thane's Crock railway. Thereupon the following discussion took plsce (we quole from Hansard and the CQUTUT) Mr. KATES Mid: Mr. 8peaker,-I do not understand. these constant postponement!. This i» part of a national railway promised four years ago ; money has beoo roted for it, and it wta paned by this House Ust year; bnt by some unfortunate rniiUke It was lost in Ibe other Chamber. The late Minuter Ivr Work®, Mr. Miles, promised distinctly to bring this line again bofote tbe Home m BOOH M Parlia ment met. Had it not been for bit uofortttoate illoesfl it would bare been Introduced here last July. . A fortnight ago I asked the Premier to let us know when this line would be intro duced, and he ssid in a week-that would be lant week. It *aa introduoed, and the dis cussion on it fixed lor yesterday, then it was postponed till to-day, and now it is to be post poned again. I should like to know when these postponements will terminate. It is very likely that the session will not last very long and it must be remembered that after p..'ing this Chamber it bu to go to the other Chamber, and that the other Chamber has to appoint a select oommittee to inquire into the merits of the lioe. That will take a lot of time again, and by that time the Parliament will close. 1 should like to know from the Govern ment-X now speak more in sorrow than in anger-what they intend to to. If they do not wish to go on *ltb the line, let them tell us at once, and we shall know what to do. I am one of those unaUuming, quiet mepibera who never lay 'mnch, andjnever trouble: the Government much I it we had bpllied and itorried like hon. members on the other aide, very likely this matter would hav« advanced very much farther. Let the Government say why it should be postponed day afterday, Mr. Stkvsmsou s What , does it natter I It will be thrown,out in the Upper House; Mr. Katw: I b»ve ration to tbip|c that it will not be thrown oat in the Tapper Honee. Mr. Mobehcu>: It has not passed' this ^ Mr? Icatm : This motion hasbefn put on the paper in a much more modified form this year than it wmImc year. . It is not the War wick to St. George line now j it is a branoh line about twenty-Hve miles lorg, fmbraping first dart agricultural ana mineral country, i The SfMXtBi I. must remipd the ben. member that'be mdst not discuss beforehand a motion which it on the business paper. There is bp question befpr* the Howe, Mr. Euas i I wiU o^ove the adjournment of the Hosiei 1 - ' - ' ' ! . Tho Spkakib < The hon. menjosr cannot put bimsslf ritrht i> discussing a motion Of which notiee bas been given by moving the I adjournment of thi House. The hon. mem ber can npfe pbe tdjouromwrt of tbe Hoop for jth* purpose ofaeking a question, but be must not diasuss the Warwick to St. George railway wfeeu a ration on that subject is on the table. ... , ... Mr, Katm i I to not wish to break tbe rnles of the House, and it I am allowed to speak .on this particular line it is no use m; moviqg the. adjournment of the House. I have nothing elae to apeak tff. . Tbe Spiakcr.: The boo. member will not think that I wish to prevent bis dlsenssiog this queetion, but it-is oootnry to parliamen tary practice for an boa. member pn a m*tion for the adjournment of tbe House to di#ow* a question of which notiee of motion bag been Already (fiven and a date fi*ed for its diaeas* eion. Thsbon. member can. of course, uov«', tbe adjournment VI tbe House to ask a ques tion of tie Minister. MB. Eatb i I want to know from the Gov ernment why this dally postponement should take place, and I shall conclude by moving tba adjournment of tbe Howe. I ktiow tbat my constituents are becoming very impatient; and I believe that the Government Ofed 1 be uhiibrd HE akaid of »hli line.

' Mr. MofcPHT: Mr. Speaker,-I rise ton point of order. , Thisis VregoU^ I think, ac cording tosour ruling. . The Awake: Qfcoursel fsannot prevent thehon. member from discussing this ques tion if he persists in ^peeking to' it j it is a matter for the Houfe itself to deal with. I can only say tbat it iscontrfry to »« pwlisj mentary practice for an hon. member,, on a motion for the adjournment of the Hotwe, t» discuss any question of which the notice of motion has already been given. The hon. member is perfectly justified in moving the edjonrnmeni of tbe House to ask a Minister why a motion has been poitpterf, but_ it is Suite contrary to parliamentary practice tq iscnssjbatmotion. . i ' 1 J. - ' Mr. KAT*b t Then Iaball ask the question. When does tba Government intend to bring ?his line fcifire'the House In rial earnest? When icWmwr Ke Government the right " -- |Seir own busiiiw in thljBoosP,and refuse to brecedsnce s»f allother)business. IftheGovrfnJ ment are not fit to perform tba funaUen of de^ terminlng in what psderto,bring in thairown business tb^y ^re oert»inly not fit to hold office. If any ion. member thinks we cannot be trusted to say In what order,we ehsU go en with: our buMOfU let him move » resolution, to the effect, and if he. oan .oarry it, effect .will be given to it immediately. I may say, sir, .that I attach very greet importanoe to lhe Imeof railway to which the hon. members haa referred, but 1 attsoh more importance to ths measure now before. the House-tbe Redistribution Bill. It has been called for by the whole C0H^>'nRABtiteBtatM»: o. 1 " T|ie PREMIER : I.fay it has been .called for b^ the wholo country and by both sides of tba ^citl'otfRAfiL* Mbubsbs : No. flear, bear j i The'PrtMtrhV It was brought'in in pniftu-, Boce of ns distinct a pledge as was ever giveh by a Govetnm^nt to apy Parliament. Mr. FOOTE: NO. T The PBixunt: Tbe hon. members for Bon» daubs is not Parliament although he does ocoupy a large space in his own estimation. Now, fir, everybody who knows anything «t all aVont a lUttrilrttW Bill kno« that it takes a nonsldersble time, even after the House has decided exactly what it is going to be, be fore tbe Bill can finally pssa, Supposing yrs were tb agree to-ttsyte ell the etectoratesAnfl the number of members in eaoh case, tbe Bill could not possibly leave this House for two or three weeks; everybody kuows that.. Every Bill of the kind that I know of has-been reooffl. mitteil two or throe times ; the Bill of 1872 wss rooommitted over and over again. In any case, supposing there were no more than tbe nccoswiry recommittals for mere_formal alter ations it would be quite impossible for that Bill to leave here for a fortuigbt, and that would bring us well up to the end of this month. Then it has to pass through an other House, and after that the electoral roliB havo to bB prepared, whiob will take a considerable time, aud it is very important that the eleotien in the new electorates should take place at (lie earliest possible date. 1 tliorfeore do not feel justillod in keeping back a menguie of tbat kind for something like a >. » ? k in order to bring forward a local matter, .wever grest impoi'tanoo to tbe locality in :ousted. That Is the reason why it was not gone on with yesterday, and so I told the hon. member himself. I hoped it might have oome on to-ii^. ; but I am unable to say when it can come i-u. It will come on at the earliest convenient opportunity. The Government are sincere in advooating it, and the hon. inembors does not assist his own cause by continually biiggestisg the imincenty of the Government, Mr, Tbobh said tbey knew that (Atiifa Bedistribution Pill was paaaad P»rH*mW»' m doomed. He pointed out tbe length' «t time that would have to ensue before thaa* railways could AdsIIj pan both bnnch(*idr tbe Legislature, and thought that if the Go vernment iotended'tu carry out their policy in lb) 8 respect tbe J would ha*e to An ao at oooe, He attribtrtedtbe delay to~tbe -iimir ence of the Toowooiuta people, and bad told tbe membera interested that tbe Go?er7iBioot were only throwing duat in their eyes. Mr.'Httxnid tint ha nw an object la continually postponing these railway*. They would bfe very convenient lines to haul in re calcitrant membera over this Redistribution Bill. (Laughter). For hie own part, be had no faith in tbe linea named. Jjjtr.~Kcu.icrr agreed alao that than was so great outorj for this till. This railway to Thane's Greek was a strong point at the last Warwick election, and,the Government had promised previously in tbe Bouse, and also to himself, that the plana ot that railway would bo laid upon the, table as soon aa the House met On tboae grounds he bad promised the railway to the people ol Warwick, and be would not have done ao but for tbe promise or tbe Government. ' : ' Mr. Stbtihsom said be told Mr. Ka»ii* tbe beginning 9! the session that the . fJo Ternment were only throwing duit in bbvyes in regard to this railway. He had said" last year that Ibe Government could, oarfy the railway from Warwick to St. :<lMrg»il*b» liked.

Mr. MorGin Although I am only a novice in politics, I am experienced enough to know that when once the House has given its assent to a measure or that nature there must be an end to business of any importance. That is a truism, an axiom of political life which cannot lie denied. This is the position,'therefore, that We are in ( if we allow the Redistribution of Seats Dill to bacome law, wo may say good-bye to our railways. The Premier says the motion has only been postponed for two days, because he [Iocs not want to delay an important measure like the Redistribution of Seats Hill for a «eck. Hut this railway question might have been dis posed of in the course of a few hours' debate. The PheMIek : Perhaps it might not have gone the way you wanted it. ^ Mr. MORGAN : If it h much longer delayed it will not. as the hon. member for Fnssilcm pointed out, slnnd the ghost of a chance of pass ing the other Chamber, It was thrown out '"ere 'ast session, and I make no doubt they ' . , v-;, throw It cnftnain if Ittiofcrtiot ipiiWi them be fore tyi mi4 of the sesikmjjM was tie cue tatt year.
