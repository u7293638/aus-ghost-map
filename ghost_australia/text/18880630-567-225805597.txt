MELECZXONS IKON "TKUTM-"..; (MAT 10.) The fine estate of Inrt.martane. in the CsreehtGowrie -district -iff Fathshin, was q recently offered for sale at Dundee, tbs re- ) serve price being £68,000 ; butthere was pot a single bid, aUhoogh tbe property was valued at £120)000 only a few years ago. The ICerruenbidpee, which left the Thames last Tuesday, for Sydney, is taking ont the first consignment of pure-bred stock to New South Wains, consis ing of Aberdeen, Angus, and shorthorn bulls and merino rams from the famous Ramboniliet flock. The enthusiasm of Mary Stoatfe admirers does not come to much when rendered in pounds, ebiliings, and. pence. Mr. Wyflie Guild's collection of 150 portraits of that famous lady, and 500 books more or less re lating to her, did not find a bidder wile- it was put up for sale en bloc at Edin burgh last week. The articles were then dis posed -if one by one, and the hooks fetched about £230, while tbe pictures averaged one pound apiece. At the eale of the Iranarelle library in Paris last week, £280 was paid for a superb copy of 44 lies Amours Pastorales de Daphms et Ghloe," which had belonged to Madame de Pompadour, and her arms and monogram were engraved on the green morocco cover. Another copy, origimlly in toe library at Chateau Ginrn, said for £270, -and a splendidly-iilruninated manuscript of toe fifteenth century, entitled " Petrarcha," fetched £165. The Lower Hhnse of Convocation has thought it neaeesary to add its cackle to toe recent mannderinga of tire bishops on the Sunday question. Archdeacon Barney acted as the spokesman of the flock, and told a harrowing tale of Sabbath desecration in his own riveraide parish—" He remembered the time (he observed) when any cue who desired to go ont boating would slink down aome by street, and do all be could to avoid being seen ; but now they seem to have co-sense of I shame, or no idea that they were breaking j tbs Lard's day." So we are going on step I by step towards the time when " the people " , will be deprived of toe " priceless boon" As. Does in never occur to this reverend gentle man that "the people" are the beet judges -of the value of the priceless boon"! Or an he suggest the ghost of a reason why a man should slink down a by-street on his way to the river on Sunday? Not he. AU that ho and the rest of their reverences can do is to hold np their hands like a party of wvlpsisHtiinl Mrs. Gmndys, and exclaim " Dear me, how shor-THrq <" Bnt it isn't only toe b ating men. The evil has spread to toe very apex of society. Here is tee Rev. Jacob Primmer aasptcioas j name !) giving voice at Dnnfermline to tee 41 great pain " which her Majesty has canifld to many cf her Protestant subjects by leav ing Florence on the Sabbath, and— woe tbe day I — driving to tee station " through dense and cheering crowds of Papists, 47 instead of slinking down a by-street, as no doubt both tee Rev. Primmer and tee Kev. Barney would have her do. All this comes— so at least, I gather from the Protestant Primmer — of 44 the Qneen's sunning after tbe priests of anti-Christ." 1 knew that there had been high-jinkB at Florence, hot I had no idea it had been as bad as this. Pancy Queen Tic- toriaxxmnmgtenmgh tee etreete of Florence after the priests of anti-Christ 2 Dr. S tamer leaves St. Paul's this week, wid he intends to reside at Oxford. He pre- aided at tee organ on Sunday evening for tee last time in bis official capacity. The Boo tor has received a number of -farewell presents from the Cathedral elegy, choirs, -and officials, and also from- juzmerons private menus, rnrs. ac&mernu; recently ssuusssea a fortune of .£80,000 from her tether, the well-known Alderman Randall, of Oxford. An old lady living at Byde died recently, and in due course her furniture was adver tised for sale. On the day before tee sale one of tee executors carefully examined an ancient bureau, and discovered a secret drawer and a false bottom, in which were upwards of a thousand sovereigns closaly picked together. There are some phases of hnman wnffnring which are almost too terrible for public dis cussion. Bach appeere to bs tee case of a poor fellow at Vienna named Rnflolfshnim, whom an all-wise 'Providence has endowed with three mothers-in- law, he having been thrice left a widower. Rndolfaheim, it is re lated, with a heroism almost super-human, oontrived to live en good terms with all three of tee l&diee; ; bnt the only resnlt of that was that the mothers-in-law, their native ferocity deprived of natural outlet, tamed upon one another. It may be that Kndolfsheim con nived at this resnlt for his own ends ; bat, if so, his calculations have been rudely upset, for after 6gfatmgapitched battle at his house, the mathers-in-lmwB have taken legal proceed ings against one another, and one has subpoenaed the unffartauiate man as her wit ness. Heavens, what a tragedy 2 Many fathers are in doubt in these days as to what to do with their sons. Xjetroesng- gest the profession af a clerk to a vestry as at once a gentlemanly and lucrative profes sion.

Some years ago, there was a etory told of a Maid-of-Hbnour dancing before Qneexx, amd asking for tee head of Mr. Gladstone an a charger. It has re-appeared in tea folbw- ing tale, white I take from tee OdLowaAf Oasettto a fonrnai -white, X believe, is kept alive by Lord Galloway and others for tee benefit of the Tory cause : — When at Bat moral, the Qneen heard xrf a pretty Highland lass who was naid to be tee finest dancer in tee Strath. Her Majesty sent for her to dance before her. The girl did so; and tbe Queen area much te armed. The gitl was rather of the better fdsww, and tee Queen bad difficulty about hw money. Her Majesty asked the girl what tee could give her— what tee would like. The girl 4 of a at rung Tory family) xcplied : "The head of Mr. Gladstone on a changer." TheQueenia reported to have aud that she could give her the charger, but, as for the hid of Mr. Gladstone. h« had lost teat years ago. tA iwiHWHuu flwfiw — Tt tae .become ao common to write the Jmgiiming u tepri, iatflisriiag article, and teen run it into some advartmement.
