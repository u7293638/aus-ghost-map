Miss Payne, a membar of the Payne musical family, died at Moonta on Thurs day morning from consumption. Mr. J. G. Jenkin, a ministerial stndent at Prince Alfred College, has been appointed to act as locum tenens at Mount Gambier for the Rev. J. Leggoe, the Chairman of the South-Eastern Dis- trict, during his absence. Mr. Leggoe proposes wintering in the mild climate of Fiji for the benefit of his health. The Hon. J. H. Gordon, M.L.C.,,has refused en principle to pa/ 10s 6d for being sworn in as a J.P. He did not believe in buying a seat on the bench. Early on Wednesday morning last a special train from Adelaide, carrying the English mails, dashed into the railway: gates near the Nhiil station. No one was injured. Mount Gambier Sisters of Mercy in ' Buenos Ayres.—It is now twelve months (says the Southern Cross) since the Rev Mother M. Baptist, accompanied by five Sisters of Mercy, left the local convent, Mount Gambier, to make a foundation of the Sisters of Mercy in Buenos Ayres. Whilst travelling to South America the Sisters visited many convents of their Order in England, and when they reached their destination the revolution was at its height. They effected a safe landipg, liowefer, and were warmly welcomed'by the Archbishop and tbe entire Catholic community. Without much delay they re-entered their old convent at Rio Bamba, and took up with characteristic energy the works for which the Sisters of Mercy have gained world-wide renown. Already the schools for children are flourishing under their care. A home for immigrant girls, who are coming in large numbers from Europe, has been opened, and a large orphanage, containing owr 100 little children, is mauaged with the zeal and care of the Sisters of Mercy. From Buenos Ayres we learn that the affaira of the orphanage are flourishing, the institution is out of debt, ami during the past year nearly $20,000 were raised for this deserving charity. We have great pleasure in reproducing these facts, as we know the residents of the Mount Gam-' bier district will be gratitied to learn that the Sisters of Mercy who left us .mly twelve months ago are doing such a good work in another laud. The Bews Memorial Fund amounts to £243 18a Id, but there are still lists to come in. < Up till the 30th June, 1890, £2,118,933 ; 2s 5d have been expended on water con- i servation in South Australia. This amount does not include railway water supplies. Government whips and cremation are topics which the Hon. J. L. Parsons has announced he will discourse on during the present session of Parliament. A section of members in the Assembly are not quite satisfied about the accept- I ance of Messrs. J. Martin and Go's tender , for the 90 odd locomotives, and it is; desired that a Board should be appointed to ascertain exactly the bonuB given to the Gawler firm for the privilege of con structing the locomotives in the colony. South Australia is a protectionist colony, and we cannot have too much of a good thing. So say ironical freetraders. Imports and Exports of South Aus tralia;— Daring the quarter ended the J 31st March, 1891, the value of the South Australian imports was £239,932 15s, or an increase of £443,639 15s as compared with the same quarter in the previous year; and the total customs. duties amounted to £169,098 13s, or a decrease of £9,732 16s 4d, compared with the March quarter in 1890, The value of the exports for the same quarter was £2,750033 I «f which amount £1,444,905 was staple! produce and £1,305,038 was foreign.

Questions in Parliament.—Our senior ] member has a thirst for information. He has no less than nine^jqestious on the the House of Assembly notice-paper, which are1-.-to be put to the Government ( on variotisdates. One is as: to whether the| Government paysjthe expenses of the j Governor's transcontinental journey from Port- Darwin.

On June 17 he will also ask : —With reference to the statement made by the Commissioner of Crown Lands on August 13, 1890, to the effect that Credit j Inspector of Lands R. P. Boucant- re ceived a salary of L330, chiefly for acting as a member of the South- Eastern Laud Board, has Inspector Boucnut ceased to be a member of the South- Eastern Gaud Board?

The largest number were married by Church of England clergymen, the Wealeyans coming close up to them. No less than 95 couples dispensed with the | services of a clergyman, and took advant age of the more direct end less costly services of the registrar.

The only business to be transacted is an application from Mr. A. Limbert -for the transfer of his store keeper's license to Messrs. Blackwell and Wrigley., Holders of land under the Government would do well to look into the last Gazette, where will be found a lengthy list of names of persons whose payments are overdo e and accruing for land purchased by them. Leigh's Creek Coal Company have the right to purchase or lease 10,000 acres in the neighborhood of the recent dis covery. Address in Reply.—The Assembly ap pointed the ' Treasurer, and Messrs. R.

Professor Bousmard has just completed a toiir throught the Transvaal gold-fields, where he has earned golden opinions. The performance is for one night only, and anyone'^ who desires a good pick-me-up, and enjoys! a hearty laugh is advised not to miss it. We have observed notices of the Professor's performances in various contemporaries and several South African newspapers; and one. and all speak lii the highest terms of his entertainment. The Southern District.—The resigna tion of the'Hon. W. A. E. West-Erskiue as a member for the Southern district of -the Legislative Council lias been officially received, and the Legislative Council lias | ordered a writ to be issued for the election of iiis.siiccessbr.. : Mr. West-Erskine was returned to the Council at the first elec tion for the southern district in May 1885.

Gordon appeared for the plaintiff. Mr. T. W. .Fleming, who conducted the case j for tbe defence, contended that the .Court had no jurisdiction in the matter, as the .contract was made at Narracorte. Mr; Russell suggested that the evidence I shonld be heard before he gave a decision,j as the evidence was applicable both to the contention and the case. The plaintiff set up that the defendant contracted to deliver 4,000 splitposts,at L3 per hun dred, and plaintiff^never; fulfilled his con tract. .

After the evidence had been called Mr.' Russell held .that the Court had jurisdic tion in the case. Verdict for the plaintiff for L40. : The .Equitable Life Assurance. Society —We are in receipt. of an article, j extracted from the London Mirror, criti- j cising at some length the position of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the i United States. This article shows vividly { the enormous business this Society is j transacting-, throughout the world, and, moreover, the writer proves inenntestably that the business it is doing is not only safe, but enormously profitable, showing that their business is obtained at a mini mum.of cost as compared with many other insurance companies. The institution j was established in New York as a purely mutual life office in 1859, and now it has branches in Great Britain, France, Ger many, Austria, Hnngary, and Russia, as well as in Australasia and the Canadian Dominion. It opened its head office in London in 1867; aud the Earl of Kintore i is one of the Trustees for Great Britain. There is L10Q,000 lodged in the Bank of England in the name of trustees for the special protection' aud security Of insurants, and the trustees are em powered to sell,, if,:, necessary, and apply the proceeds .in payment of matured policies; the.Society undertaking to replace all securities sold under this power. ' There js also a deposit of £20,000 with the British Boattl of Trade. Accord ing to the usual schedule deposited at the Board of Trade, the funds--von December SI, 1889, amounted ;t'oT22.258.799, and the revenue for that yfear wasi-Premiums, £5.201,844 ; consideration , for. amounts, £117.877 ; interest., £1,041,179; total, ] £6,360.400. , -The., new. business was i £36,518.354, yielding:., in premiums ' £1,-355,155 ; . w<», are in formed it was £40,000,000. yield ing - £1.480.000 :,-in/.j-tpremivins. . . In-j 1880 the assets wjerov£8,564.292, and ! surplus £1,428,720..-- In .1889 the assets were £22,322,981, ja«d the surplus £4.733,557- -; As further illustrating the enormous progress .this;giant society has made, we may mention that, the premium income increased from £2,4.90,931 in 1884 to L5,201,844 in 1889. There is a table given indicating the suplus earned in six. years by the largest ten American com panies, the Equitable being, at the top of the list with, L5,277,806, an "average to mean liabilities of 6 96 per cent. The average rate of interest earned by tbe Equitable is from 5-26 to 5*82 per cent., or nearly 25 per cent, in excess of 20 British companies. Election fob the Southern District. —We are advised that Mr. A. Mackie will again contest the vacancy in the Southern District. It iB also rumored that Mr. Shaw, late Mayor of Adelaide, and who is favorably known in the South East, will contest the vacancy. The Weather.—We are still having bright sunny weather, with extremely cold, frosty nightB. It is needleBS to say that rain is much required, and to chronicle that in the second week of June we have not had rain sufficient to wet the surface ef the soil, is something most unusual for this part of the Sonth- East. It is a serious matter for graziers, and whether the rain comes sooner or later, the results are bound to be disastrous to the stock. As it is sheep, especially ewes and lambs even on tbe most favored runs j are in a pitiable condition, and before the J winter is over the'losses are certain to be great. We hear that on some stations they are cutting down sheoaks to keep tbe sheep alive. Throughout Sunday j night and Monday morning there was an extraordinarily severe frost, and on the small pools of water the ice was a quarter | of an inch thick. Many householders had to put boiling water down their pumps I before they could get them to work on j Monday morning...
