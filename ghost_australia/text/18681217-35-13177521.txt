A. , Assistant Master, Mr Edwin W hithdd, M A. and Mr C O IIdra, M A,, Mr W H Catlett, and other gentlemen The Rev W. C B. Cave was also among the visitors present His ExcELLENCy. opened the proceedings by calling upon the Head Master to make his short statement as to the progress of the students during the past year The PAR MAHTritsaid the first duty which has had to perform on that occasion was much more of a pleasure than a look, for it devolved upon him to give it hearty and respectful welcome to his Excellency on his first visit to the Sydney Grammar School The presence of his Excellency the amongst them -was not only a sanction to what they had been down during the past year, but would, he doubted not, prove to be a very powerful in- centive to the industry of the boys in their future studies The prizes that were to be that day distributed scare prizes which the masters believed to have been fairly earned by close application to, and proficiency in, the various branches of study for which they were specially given they were awarded for the promotion of a healthy competition amongst the students, such as might lead them in for yet further progress, without the generous emulation so excited being perm tied to deteriorate into envy He could assure his Excellency and the ladies and gentlemen present), that the masters and examiners had the best possible reasons for know test that these prizes had been honorably earned by those to whom they had been awarded and ther theywere the testimonials of a more advanced individual proficiency, as compared with others with whom the student so distinguished had been competing In the-" award the ' Atekly markings," which showed a lad's industry in his allotted tasks had been taken into account, as well as the main Ita gained by him in the periodical examination which he had from time to time to undergo as the tour of his actual progress in his I Studies lovers -cry happy to be able to state that during the past year the pupils who had been sent on from that school to the University had been doing as well as they could possibly expect (2 Hear, hear, from Dr Badham ) At the Public Lwmnation in December, 1867, three formers had inkenalirst Class -Coghlan (distinguished in matheiiMtiCfl), Rennie (distinguished in Latin and mathematics), and Sly (also distinguished in Latin and mathematics (Cheers ) In the Second Class, Curtis had been distinguished in Latin At Matriculation, in February hint, Coghlan had gained the Senior University Scholarship, and Rennie, the Levey Scholarship In their first years examination Sly and Rennie had been equal, and O'Connor first class in classics, Rennie and Sly had been first class in mathematics, and Rennie and Sly first-class in physics (Re new ed cheers ) He thought that the public examination which had been instituted at the University had supplied one of the most evident wants in the colony and could not I but prove highly beneficial He regretted it should have been as yet not more largely availed of, but it was, of course, a great satisfaction to him, as the head master of that school, to think that, out of the seventeen who presented themselves for examination, all but three should have come from the Sydney Grammar School (Applause ) During the last year he had introduced into that school one innovation the study of Natural Science Of course they could not but see with pleasure the progress which Natural Science was now making in England, and observing that progress, they would of course like to see such studies generally taken up out here He had thus introduced the innovation, more as an experiment than anything else, for he believed that a long and careful course of study in classics and mathematics was, after all, the best introduction to Science [" Hear, hear, from Dr Badham] This he believed to be the case and it was not the less true because it was a truth that might be perverted and abused He had intended the study of Science, as he stated -with all the necessary appliances, and the result had been that the senior pupils had been benefited thereby , but the change had not, as he thought, been productive of any benefit to the lower boys He proposed therefore, for the future, to restrict their labours in that direction to the elder boys He thought the great want of the school at the present time was a Modern Division, and be esteemed himself happy in having been able to secure the co-opera- tion of two gentlemen who were eminently qualified to assist him in carrying out all that he proposed to study of English had, however, not been overlooked in the Grammar School, his relative of importance being always appreciated and insisted upon In June last they had had an examination entirely in English for himself, he desired to express the great satisfaction which he felt at w bit had been done during the past year They had been doing their work faithfully and earnestly, and, as a consequence, they were begining to see very encouraging results that the school was in a gratifying state of efficiency was shown by the way in which their pupils went up to the University The list examination had been very satisfactory As far as he could see, the boys of the Grammar School were good and industrious boys, who had confidence in their master's and he was quite certain that the masters had every confidence in them (Cheers ) Dr. Badham desired to make a few observations, but before proceeding to do so regretted to have to apologise for the mv voluntary absence of his valued friend and fellow labourer, Professor Pell, who, from the press of University work, was unable to attend 1 he was the more to be regretted inasmuch as Professor Pell, who had always taken the liveliest interest in that school, had personally examined Several of the classes, and was known to have satisfied himself as to the progress which they had made After paying a handsome compliment to Professor Poll for his integrity, his professional industry, and his devotion to the best interests of education in this colony, the learned doctor proceeded to read a letter, which had been addressed by Professor Pell to the trustees of the Sydney Grammar School It was as follows -" Gentle- men's have examined a number of boys in the Upper School in algebra and the elements of trigonometry, and the second form in arithmetic I am very much pleased with the result, and regret that an unusual pressure of work at the University has prevented me from examining the whole school in the Upper School, Coghlan, Kelly, Walker, and Anderson have acquitted themselves in a manner most creditable to themselves and to the school The proficiency to which some of the boys have attained, and the general indications which I observe of careful teaching, show that every boy at the Sydney Grammar School has the opportunity of becoming an accomplished mathematician I am quite satisfied also with the second form, some of whom have acquired an unusual proficiency in arithmetic I have, &.C, (signed) B Pell University, December 30th, 1868 " (Cheers ) Dr. Badham proceeded to state that he had not examined so many of the boys as Professor Pell, not because did not feel a warm interest in the welfare of the school, but rather because he had already good reason to have entire confidence in the course of study there carried on under the head master He had had several anxious conversations with that gentleman on the subject and the result had been that he had been perfectly content to leave all to that gentleman's gentleman well qualified for his important office, for he not only hold an independence of thought, but a reverential regard to traditional ideas and to the deductions of the intellects of others Mr Weigall possessed these qualities, so essential to a good schoolmaster, in a very eminent degree, and it was therefore only natural that he (Dr Badham) should have every confidence in his teaching Mr Weigall was, moreover, brought up in the same university as himself, and hold on many subjects, the same views that he did He said this by way of apology for his not having examined as many of the classes as Professor Pell He, however, did examine one class, and found it all that it ought to be, the boys in it had a perfect acquaintance with all that they had been taught and out of that there was, very properly, a blank 1 key had not been permitted to receive imperfect and erroneous ideas They knew all that they ought to know, and were chaffingly ignorant of what they were supposed not to know CVlau{,h) The teacher in his further labours would find nothing to undo , all had been left plain before him He confessed that he liked the Sydney boy, and did not think that he had any qualities which rendered him less susceptible of intellectual and moral improvement than the English boy He found in the colonial youth a great docility and aptitude for lo pm mg, but he found also that hero, or in England, the chief difficulty in the way of the education of children was the indifference of parents As it was in Birmingham so it wilshere, this indifference was the chief obstacle against which the schoolmaster had to contend His remarks, of course, did not apply to the parents and guardians present, for they had shown their interest by their presence, but he spoke for the benefit of those who had stayed away He quite agreed with Mr Weigall in thinking that the old grammar school mode of education was the best five or six years of steady and continuous study were better than all the " Ologies, in which some would wish to have their children experimentally and superficially instructed the learned Professor proceeded to insist in torso and emphatic language, on the unwisdom of those parents who were never satisfied with the gradual and thorough education of their children, but who, through their foolish dis f i list of the schoolmaster and their înlerineaUling with what they did not and could not possibly understand, often pro v cut the judicious schoolmaster from realising all the good results that he has laboured to see accused for their children. He deprecated that impatience which desired to see at once some tangible result as the evidence of a money grubbing spirit It reacted injuriously upon the colony, having a direct tendency to lower the standard of education amongst us This was a thing much to be regretted, because it must be evident to all that we had a dearth of public men-men really qualified by the soundness of their education for the heavy responsibilities of public life The prices were then delivered by his Excellency to the boys to whom they had been as it did Amongst those be distinguished were Masters Coghlan, Skelly, Patrick Rennie, Leslie, Haigh, Edwards, primus, and Chapman This was far the Chssioal Division In the Mathematical Division the pikemen were understood to be. Coghlan, pumps, Kelly, Anderson, Walker, Coghlan secundus, Ebsworth secundus, Violette-, and Goldring Primes for English were also given to Coghlan, Camden, Kelly, Jacobs, Cohen Brighton, Cohen Tertius, Edwards primus, and Ebsworth tertius Wives for Latin v, case given toLbsvvorth Secundus and Phipson primus Appleford drawing was given to Canty, another for writing to I swings, a French on o to Peter, and n> firii'O for proficiency in natural seven. ce 'J Kelly All the lads were greeted with cordial rounds of applause as they 611CCCEBU cry went up to the platform His Excellency the Gov ban on said it no "w devolved upon him, having presented the prizes, to disarm s that assembly with a few brief remarks The Head Master had informed them what had been the extent of the progress '"""of 17 the boys in their several studies, and had spoken (which he had been very happy to hear in very favourable"" terms as to their general conduct The meeting had also been addressed on the subject of education by Dr Badham, who, in eloquent and emphatic terms, bad insisted upon the great value of a regular and continuous course of study such as he understood to be provided for the boys of th to' school To the terms of that address he should not attempt to add any time, because a he did not think he would be likely to improve it He considered it a noteworthy f ireuwstonco that during the last year the fees pay table for a Ihopupils at the Sydney Grammar School had been largely reduce 1 He was also informed that there were no less than the free scholarships in connection with the school -all open for the benefit of those" whose parents might not, be able to pay for the education of a child at such a school It afforded him pleasure also to find that since the present head master had taken charge of the school the number of scholars had steadily increased When Mr Weigall joined there were' it appeared, hunt 41 scholars, hut at the end of last your the number had been increased to GG, and now the numbers in the G"host ' were 1-6 nearly three times as many as were in. the school when Mr Weigall first took charge of it. He bored the boys would always do their utmost to profit by the peculiar advantages which they enjoyed as pupils in that school All boys could not be equally cle her, but all might, at least, be equally industrious It rested with every boy to have that applicationtostulv whichvnnalwiy¡> conincnuiiblf-iilvinys benefiCial, and without which few (if any men over permanently distinguished themselves He hoped that such application as he recommended would always be one of the distinguishing characteristics of the boys of the Sydney Grammar School This terminated the preceding, the boys giving cheers for the " Queen, the " Governor, the " Masters," Dr Badham, and others
