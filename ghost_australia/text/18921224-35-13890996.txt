RALEIGH'S HOUSE FOR CHICAGO. The report that Raleigh's house at Youghal is to be taken in pieces, and set up in the grounds of the Chicago Exhibition, though not flattering to his countrymen on this side of the Atlantic, is (says the London standard) highly creditable to the enthusiasm of that quarter of the world with which his fame is so intimately connected Since the death of its late owner, Sir John Pope Hennessy, the house has been for sale but, though more than once put up to auction either no bidders presented themselves or the reserve price was not reached The faculty of hero worship is not strongly door closed in Ireland, except for heroes connected with the Land League, and we are afraid it is asking too much of the most respectful admirer of the Luzabothan worthy to expect him to exhibit his esteem by the purchase of property in the Emerald Isle Moreover, a ghost is said to haunt the house For purposes of romance a first class wraith is a highly desirable article, and no Celtic family with the least pretence to antiquity u without a banshee But it is quite another matter when the speaker comes to close quarters, and in Ireland, undoubtedly, a mansion is not improved its marketable value by the fact that a far-off proper for appears in it at intervals At all events, the house does not feel! so that if the owners, after giving us every chance to purchase it accept the offer of an American, it is scarcely possible to blame them And after all, the United M itos are inhabited by copied the majority of whom have quite as good a hum to Raleigh as we It might, indeed, be urged that they have a still better right to hold him in high esteem Tor did he not ask two thousand pounds In Sir Humphry Gilbert's ill-fated J.xneJitlon to the New World, and on the news of his half-brother s loss take up a fresh charter of discovery and colonisation ? Ho it was who 308 i years ago, sent out a fleet under Amadas and Bnrlovvo to explore the coast north of 1 Tofua, and it was under Raleigh's directions that they took possession of the famous land which has over since been known as Virginia Next year he fitted out a still stronger party to settle the territory, and if the venture did not result in great profit or much glory to him, the world-and the Virginians above all men are likely to remember it from the fact that he is reputed by a very unsubstantial legend to hal brought back with him the w cod which is still the staple crop of their prosperous State His adieu turous journey in search of the Golden City of Manoa might have been more romantic-it could scarcely have been less profitable-but the man who taught mankind the solace of tobacco, and thus began a trade which is worth millions per annum, assuredly deserves well of those who have prospered where he met with little except misfortune His irish house, therefore would be likely to form, even in Its transplanted condition n Mecca of the first moment to the Chicago sightseers There cannot be any doubt that the marshal mansion now for saloon, perhaps, soldered that which he built on the Munster estate of 42 000 confiscated areas bestowed upon him in laST This being the case, there is no special reason for being too sceptical over the story that it was here he first smoked on British soil the herb called "Yppowocj" though possibly the silver-pips period of his experience was when, in after days, the Virgin Queen deigned to sit by his side while be displayed to her the custom he had learned in Roanoke Modern criticism scarcely bears out the claim made on Raleigh's behalf, since it has long ago been proved that the tobacco plant was first brought to Europe by Fernandes, physician to Philip II, and that Ralph Lane and Sir Francis Drake presented Raleigh with the implements of smoking, which were taken so kindly to that he enjoyed a pipe a little before he went to scaffold But it is allowable to believe that he brought it to Ireland, and taught to Spenser the virtues of " divine tobacco," which that poet has so warmly edel rated All this may be admitted, and if, in addition, the Youghal garden is to be credited with being the home of the potato in Ireland, the house must, to many who have their own opinions of the advantages of that river to the Irish people, be surrounded with an almost sacred halo Still, if Raleigh's IIOUEO is to go at a great pace, one trembles for a great many other similar structures Milson's home was saved with difficulty and Anne Harris who 's cottage was only narrowly kept on this side of the ocean The Italians declined to part with the Colosseum, and the Quakers with William Penn s bones But if the Chicago folks do not abate their passion for Old World buildings, will St Paul's in London, or St. Peter's in Rome, be quite safe ?
