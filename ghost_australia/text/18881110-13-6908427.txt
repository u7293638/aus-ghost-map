Accoidiug to the books of reference, it is n conservativo Government which is in power, and tlie représentation of the nation ni Parliament is ulso decidedly conservative The nation itself is meantime dancing titiinaanoli "down the ringing grooves of tiuu, ' with what results another live years or BO will see Mr Arthur James Balfour, the Chief Secre- tary for Ireland, although nearly 40 years old, has never until now had time to divert his thoughts from philosophy and politics to love. Lately, however, he has been court ing, and is positively stated to be engaged to be married. The only question is to whom? The mere conventional story is that it is to a daughter of Lord Bath. There seems, how - ever, more picturesqueness, and perhaps as much probability, in the assertion that it is to Miss Margot Tennant, a daughter of Sir Charles Tennant, of the Glen, who was in former Parliaments one of Mr Gladstone's most fervid supporters. Miss Margot Ten nant is a young lady of marked individuality of character, and one of the most brilliant conversationalists in London. Mr Balfour has been lately staying at her father's house, where (her sisters being all married) she does the honours. It is curious how fond many of the Gladstonians like Sir Charles Tennant are of Mr Balfour personally. His appear ance, voice, manner, culture, and tempera ment are exactly those usually associated with well-bred Jacobinism. Conservatism seems to sound strangely in his mouth. It has the startling effect of the sounds of a trumpet proceeding from the strings of a fiddle. He counts Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Labouchere, Sir Lyon Playfair, and even Mr. Stead among his personal friends. The latter is enthusiastic about him. They will have it that he is at bottom one of themselves-that he is doing their work, and merely working out his party's policy to show that nothing can come of it. I expect that in future years he will be a national favourite. The English always begin with a bitter aversion. They cannot like a man until they have ex- hausted every form of abuse and caricature in describing him. It is curious to note how men's looks improve in the satirical journals as time goes on. Bright was once a burly and repulsive Quaker, and Randolph Churchill a tomtit. Now, even Mr. Parnell is becoming ideally handsome. Mr. Balfour is not much flattered by the likenesses of his friends, and the caricatures of his enemies represent him as a horror. In time the comic papers of all shades will represent him as what he is-a refined and good-looking man, rather above the middle height.
