COLONZAL NEWS. (FRoM OUR OWN OORRESPONDENTS.) TASMANIA. HODART TowN, Dee. 3. "The ghost" mystery has been the ex citement of to-day. It appears that be. tween one and two o'clock this morning three constables who were in Salamanca Place, near the old St. David's Ceme tery, noticed a man standing in the middle of the road, and a white figure similar to that which others have seen, and which has been called "the ghost," on the footpath. The man, who turned out to be Thomas Nevin, the Town Hall keeper, was arrested, and two of the constables chased the ghost, who was fleet-footed, but would have been captured only one of the constables fell, thus giving him a good lead. Nevin was taken to the watch-house, but was allowed by Sub-Inspector Connor to be re leased on bail. This afternoon the Police Committee heldaninquiryinto the matter. Their proceedings lasted five hours, and a number of witness.. were examined with a view of elucidating the mystery. The result of their deliberation was that Nevin, was held to be to blame, but the facts adduced were not sufficiently strong to warrant his being prosecuted. Apart from this ghost business, however, he was dismissed from his situation for drunkenness, having received repeated warnings. The Committee reprimanded Sub-Inspector O'Connor for having re leased Nevin on his own responsibility,. it has not been ascertained who the individual is who has been acting the part of the ghost, but there is reason to hope that he will soon be detected. The examination for the degree of Associate of Arts was commenced this morning at the Freemasons' Hall. There are 21 candidates, the result of whose preliminary examination will be known to-morrow. The matriculation examination in con niection with the Melbourne University has been . proceeding since Wednesday last, and will be concluded to-morrow.
