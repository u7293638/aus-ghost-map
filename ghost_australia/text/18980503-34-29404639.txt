He meditstwi s ,; . -.great length cm the symbolism of th eadwdral, repeatedly *■"•"'*"£ up his note ;' ' " and occasionally seeing wonderful nvsti visions.

There is no personality about any c ■ ■ {these time, they only act as catechisers t djcit opinions from DurtaL In Paris his sot was "saponaceous, the foot sank in it." The state of drought in the provincial town "toughened him to homines?-" Still with his bpiritual ansemia, his weariness, in difference, and torpor in prayer alternated a. persistent and obstinate yearning, a craving j for prayer, a constant invitation from j God keeping *"■" alert. Bored to death' as he is by provincial life — and no wonder—he at hist with much misgiving leaves for a cloister. "The Cathedral' is a study of symbolism and the mediaeval mysti cism of the|Roman Catholic religion, and as such in the midst of a great deal of arid moralising contains much that is interesting and original and that will afford food for re flection. Dnrtal in his reflections "travelled round the whole cycle of mysticism," and I found the cathedral the epitome of heaven and j earth. The cathedral was to him a, super human thing that "symbolised the loving ten derness of orisons," a pile of stones that, thanks to the science of symbolism, became a macrocosm. He enlarges on the symbolical meaning and history of all its parts, the proto typeof tile naveand pointed arch being found in the forest, thelengthJJpeadth, and height all revealed some special?rn idea on the part of the architect, and the cruciform shape repre sented the crucified Christ, the twist that some churches have symbolising the head and neck of the Saviour drooping over his shoulder when he bad given up the ghost. From Dar tal, too, we learn of a ritual of color wherein a different hue was allotted to each sacrament, a litany of Kerne, a category of the virtues and vices attached to vegetables, the symbolism of religious pictures, the meaning of the bestiary, or the church menagerie of good and evil emblems divided into real beasts and monsters. Thus gargoyles are "hybrid monsters signifying the vomitting forth of sin ejected from the sanctuary, reminding the passer-by, who sees them pouring forth the water from the giilim, that when seen outside the church, they are the voidance of the spirit, the fVyiv of the souL" Even wwJT^ according to Dortal, have their symbolism, and "Satan's baleful effluvia are of two 1""*^"^ one characterised by the stench of sulphurous waters and drains, die other by a false odor of sanctity, delicions trusts of sweetness and temptation. n Banuna and Bailey would willingly exchange their freaks for the monsters of olden ritn«« as enumerated by Dnrtal with so ranch unction—the gryphon, the phoenix, the unicorn, the porphyrion, the wyvern, the maoiooris, the leoncerote, the tharaoda, the sea monk with a body covered with scales, -fins all over, claws in lieu of arms, and baring a monk's shaven head ending in the snout of a carp. Some of the mystic visions, euch as that of the swords, and the explanation of the origin of the Gothic Cathedral are well worth reading for the originality of their imagination and the beauty'of their language, while the description of the procession of the "Court of Miracles," old : wrecks dressed in reach-me-downs and specimens of extinct headgeai; is sure to be frequently quoted. As fiction "the Cathe dral* is intolerable, as a series of lectures on architecture, art, religion and mystical mythology and a text-book of symbolism it is highly interesting.
