Au Ideal Dramatic Sketch. SCENE--The stage of the Royal Victoria Theatre. Time--morning. Various groups of actors and actresses scattered about, "pale and lazy". MR CHILLYBUM mending his stockings under a music stool in the orchestra. The PRO- PRIETOR behind a scene in a corner, examining through a pocket-glass, some carbuncles upon his nose. Enter the MANAGER looking cool; evidently bent upon business, but in no hurry. SIM.--"How now, ye secret dark and midnight" \--good morning ladies and gentlemen-- clear the stage and begin. CALL BOY--Please sir, Mr BROOKE arn't come yet. SIM.--"Oh, that a man should put an enemy in" \--haste! watch his arrival, and acquaint us quick, presto! Enter BROOKE. BROOKE--Behold him here! (general start) No welcome guest it seems, unless I------- SIM.--Take it coolly. BROOKE--Coolly! Hast thou not traduced me, blasted my fair fame, and to the vulgar cabbage trees made it appear I lied? SIM.--Thou liest! I did not. BROOKE--By all my hopes, and Coppin's too, of sweet monopoly, and sweeter gains, you did. Look at the Herald, whose columns to my puffs are ever open! Look to the fair Empire, whose pages are commanded by my bearded prophet! Look to that villa- nous Bell, whose ribald jests provoke me more than all the rest! In each and all of them the lie is given by you to me. SIM.--(Singing)--"Pray goody, please to mode- rate" &c.; BROOKE--I stand in TAYLOR'S shoes! SIM.--May they fit thee nicely. BROOKE--Where's my Manager; where's my HEIR? CROSBY--Take some of mine; I've got enough to spare. SIM.--"My soul's in arms, and eager for the fray". Who say's I'm not the manager? BROOKE--"I, Hamlet, the Dane". SIM.--Murther and mother's milk, who are you? BROOKE.--The great G. V. STEPHENS--(in the gallery)-G. U. (go it Joe). BROOKE--Where is HEIR? CROSBY--On my face--look! SIM.--Puff, blather, and gas. Gentlemen, "leave your d--nable faces, and begin". BROOKE--I'll not be bounced. I pay my money, and I'll have my HEIR. SIM.--Away! I know you not. BROOKE--Not know me! me!! me!! Oh, ye gods, must I endure all this? SIM.--Ask the grocer. BROOKE--Ay! where is that noble-minded man? PROPRIETOR--(running away with his nose in his hand)--I'm off. Enter Lawyer. BROOKE--"Angels and ministers of grace, defend us. Art thou" Levy of London, or his ghost? LAWYER--Of London, Levy. BROOKE--(with a fine romantic start a la Mac- beth)--"Avaunt, and quit my sight! Of all men else, I have avoided thee"! But get thee hence, too much I've quailed at sight of face of thine in courts already". Here a general row ensues, and the last two combatants, the "prophet" and Mr CHILLYBUM, are left pummelling each other by mistake, as the curtain falls.
