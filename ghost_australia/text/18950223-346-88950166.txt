WIDOW WATSON. (By r. P. Whitworth, in the " Austba lian Journal.'^ A wet Christmas. You know what that means on the diggings. It means hot, muggy '■.'■weather; mud up to your knees; damp, dirt, and discomfort generally. But it also means a big washing up, and, consequent-, . plenty of gold, with its concomitants— >;/drinking, gambling, riot, disorder, and devils' dance generally—that characterise I the diggings, or, rather, did characterise the J*, -diggings of, let us say, 20 years since. What a dark yet lurid, shadow the. early J days on the goldfields seem to cast over the memories of those who have lived long enough to recollect them. The days of easy getting and reckless, spending, of desperate » toil and mad revel, of hardship and danger' •^and thoughtless waste, of crime, perhaps, I'.iUid suffering. >1And yet from out of those dark days, from amidst those bands of careless and lawless adventurers, every now and again shine out \- vivid gleams of God's own sunlight, that show all the more brightly for the murky clouds by which, they are environed.' Such an one of many I hajre knowp occurs to me now. A wet Christmas, 'or, rather, Christmas Eve, on the Walhalla diggings. ' Th'ere::had been a week's rain, and Stringer's Creek'and .-••the Thompson were running bankers to the lakes below.1 The rounded hump of Mount Haw Baw loomed hazily through the light drizzle, looking all the miles he was distant, instead of, as lie was wont ill fine weather,, appearing almost to overhang the valley on the steep hill sides of which the miners sought their rich treasure. The roads and'tracks, such as they were, were covered with a thick layer of yellow mire and slush,' and all nature seemed as miserable and dejected as ; she usually does under such conditions. In =• the afternoon, however, the rain partially ; cleared oft, and the sun even got a chance i; now and again to lighten up the prospect ! ■ with a tearful emile.. ■ But melancholy-ai everything fobked ojifc-j aide, within doors there were very high jinks indeed, and the sound of^revelry,* not'tolsay devilry, impregnated with' the - fumes': of tobacco and the odour of rum, and fringed' „,with a garniture of choice digger blasphemy, ^issued from every hotel and shanty in the township. In a word; money was plentiful, the men were in high spirits, and Bullocky Ben, the burly landlord of the Pick and Shovel, who was usually of a grumbling dis position, was he«d to declare that there hadn't been such a 'roust up \ since he'd been in the country. Drinking, swearing, smoking, danoing,' singing, quarrelling, and, above ally-'Cara-' playing, were in full blast,, atiff'.poke^, eachre, Yankee grab, and other device's) by which the unholy alliance of gambleiM;ah'd ahanty-keepera ease the miner of hi<rhaMly Von gold, wont merrily on.. . 11 .' Why try to describe the scene further 1 Those of the olden time who have been in-it and of it will easily realise it, those who have not never can. That afternoon, or, rather, evening just aa the sun was giving a farewell glint, prior fco going to bed, beyond the Western ranges, the slosh, slosh of a heavily-shod man might have been heard leisurely, tramping through : the wot scrub and deep mud from the direc tion of the Tubal Cain mine, and making for; the township. Presently he emerged from the bush into view. He was a big, stalwart1 fellow, black- bearded, and embrowned by exposure to the Bun and weather.' Hard handed, hard- featured, with that far-off, yet determined, almost defiant'look that tells.so surely of the stern battle of life fought, yet • not always won. He was clad in the inevi 'table slouched billy-cock hat, a rough blue ;!jumper, and moleskin tro'U3eri,'stairied!with' ! ;:slush and bedaubed w.ith clay. .He. looked the \ ery picture of " what' he-was—-ahardyj» feirless, rough-aTi^tumble,: oldrtime; digger, jequal to either .fortune, and ready..at.,anj;. \- moment either for a feast or for .'a ' fray.' i'-Curly, for thacwae. the.soubriquet by which he was mostly 'known,- was indeed a hard case , honest,1^indeed; iridustrious,' and tr'ue: aa steel, but somewhat-, it is to be feared* of a hard-living, hard-swearing, graceless repro-., bate, a type, .'in/ short, of ai class of which there were so-" many in those day's.

The Pick and-Shovel—and, for the matter of that, every other hotel and shanty in the township—was doing a roaring trado that evening, and Bullocty Ben, his -wife, Jim the barman, Moll Dowd (the bis?, red-haired servant girl), and Hoppy Joe .(th#, old job man) were a3 busy as they couIdDG, reaping in the golden harvest.;-. <The full-,y-tha parlor was full, so was the long dimn^-rooitf,-!3o! was the kitchen.

' 'i'here was a lull in the hubbub as everyone in the room turned to look at the new-comer's solemn countenance. He did look scared enough, in sober fact. ' Boys,' said "Curly; impressively, seen a ghoSfc, and such a ghost'as I can't'say I'm sorry for seeing. And it's fetched me, you bet—fetched me up all standing, aa a eller may say.' There was a dead silence, and someone asked—' What have you seen ?' ' A ghost, mate3—the ghost of days long gone by, the.ghost of forgotten things, the ghoat of undone duty.' The men looked at him and at each other in surprise ; oven the card players suspended their games. ' Boys,' he went on, 1 I've seen this blessed evening what's brought the salt water into my eyes, and, by George ! v I ain't ashamed to say it. You all remember poor Harry Watson, as was'killed at the Long Tunnel two year since come June V ' Yes, yes)', . 'Well, ,T happened to be passing the widder'a this afternoon, anil turned into the iean-t'o to shelter out o! the rain, and there I see and heir summut as laid me out, knocked the sawdust clean out o' me. There was that poor creatur' a-sittin' cryin' over them father less babbies—cryin', mates, o'count of havin1 no food to give 'em. Think o' that, boys, this blessed Christmas time, land no food to give'em. -I couldn't stand their innocent, talk,'by George; I couldn't; I had to cut1 and run.', If I hadn't I should ha'' blubbed right 'oiit. "'Now, you'veiaii heer'd o'.that Santa Claus as bring things for kids on Christmas •Eve?!: ; , ,rT 'Yes, yes.' ''1 Very.well. This 'ere's Christmas Eve, and, we've had a good washin' up, all on us. Now,, what, I me'yii';focT to say is tins 'evp', that Walhalla's not goinr to be played so low down on as not to have a, Santa Claus of its own. And that Santa Glaus is.goin'to the widder's thia'very night, on the .'quiet, aa it were. We: ain't a mean lot o' skunks oh these diggings,' not as I knows on. ' There's my hat, and there's my pound note in the crown on jit. Anybody can cover it as | likes.' ! Bendigo Sam, tho biggest rough and bully, and the most inveterate gambler on the field, rose quietljj from the table, saying in, for him, a wonderfully'soft voice—'Put down your cards,1 boys ; I!m in this Lf reckon. > There's my|p6urid; "Who's next?' '■ ' ... There wa's no peed to ask. Xtl a moment Curly was! surrounded' by a 'sympathetic crowd, and notes, gold, and silver were poured into! the hat as if by magic. ' Pass it round here/ called someone from the bar, anqi the Pactolean strqam rolled in. ' Pass it round the township,' cried one .enthusiastic contributor. '.I rockon we mountain bays do things right- up to the nines when jwe do 'em at all.' t .And it was done. 'Some rgave in money, t'some in kinii. The affair by some means •;had spread through the plaoe, and all gave "something, fhe result being that Santa Claus must have had a very big pack indeed to hold half tfie offerings of these rough and ready, but generous, dwellers in the wilder ness. The township appeared >to be oppressed with some ! great and profound secret all that evenin^, ' 'Men who met! in'the hotels', Btorea, or ;street whispered to each other mysteriously, or, conversed in lpw, solemn tones. Even the^card players at the taverns seemed to-be pre occupied, and Ben, digo Sam i twice t made a misdeal, a thing he hpd never, before been known jto'do within) the mempry. of his, oldest'acqu 'aintance. 'Quarrels . were. made up,' old friendships which had been severed renewed and, singular fco relate, for the first time in .the hiatory of Walhalla, the eve of festival was allowed: to pass' without a fight,' or a solitary being ' run in ' to the -police, camp. Il was as if! the inhabitants had had pre monition of;some vast moral earthquake or volcanic eruption.
