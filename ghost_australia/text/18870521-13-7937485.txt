i REVIEW. | I THE SCHOOL- IN ITALY Since Mark Twain discovered the humorous side the "grand Continental tour," no book on Italian travel has appeared which can equal in brightness untrammelled honest observation, and exhilarating fun, the above work. The success of the author's Buchholz Variety has been phenomenal in German and already very remarkable in its English translation The whole German press have exhausted in praise the copious stock of synonyms of the language, and Prince Bis marek himself wrote to Dr Meade a complimentary and appropriately humorous letter. Herr Carl Buchholz- and his wife are highly respectable middle class Berlin citizens, and the fidelity with which their thoroughly Berlin character 13 portrayed on every page of this account of their " circular tour in Italy is delightful and masterly in its apparent ease. This description of their travels is supposed to be written by Frau Wilhelmine Buchholz, whose favourite idea is that in a six weeks trip in Italy, while her husband cures his rheumatism, she will acquire in a perfectly finished degree, the faculty of art criticism Accordingly her husband, Carl, her brother "Uz, and herself set out from Berlin to \ irons along the Brenner route so well known to contemporary tourists At Leipsig the motion of their journey is broken by the arrival of a gentleman who turns out to be a large manufacturer of patterned trousering tailors cloth Trau Buchholz tries to draw him into a cultured conversation on antiquities, as he, too, is bound for Italy "No, my good madam, he answers, " antiquity is not in my line They elton t wear enough formers those days But sun ty in Italy, among all the pictures of the great masters, I can find some suggestions for new patterns.
