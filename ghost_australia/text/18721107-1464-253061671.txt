BEALISED. (Vide Cartoon.) Little'Puck, the merry fairy of the weird, the wizard play, Made no foolish, idle statement when he said he'd speed away — Speed, and put, in minutes forty, round this spacious mundane sphere Mighty girdle ; for behold him in the picture given here, With the shining ghost of Shakespere standing stately at his side. Hearing all the world's laudations with a grave and lofty pride, Glorified a proven prophet through the messages which shew All the work has been accomplished he foretold so long ago. Praised be he, for every moment speeds a subtle shape of fire On the girdle in the oceans, over countries crossed with wire. Far Columbia, England, Europe, Asia from her Arctic bounds, By the means so well predicted, send us words of welcome sounds. Therefore raise we tenfold praises — therefore is our joy intense ; Seeing — that is speaking strictly, in a figurative sense — All Earth's other Christian regions, to their farthestfutmost shores Have been brought, as Puck presaged it — carried, to our very doors.
