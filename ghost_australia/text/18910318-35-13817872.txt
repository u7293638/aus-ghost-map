IS POETRY DYING? Edmund Gosse, in the New York; Forum.) Is poetry, in its very essence, an archaic and rudi- mentory form of expression, still galvanised into motion, indeed, by antiquarianism, but really obsolete, and therefore to be cultivated only at the risk of affec tatton and insincerity , or is it an art capable of incessant renovation - a living organism which grows on the whole, with the expansion of Modern life? In other words, is the sort of verse one which, like music or painting, delights and consoles us with species of expression which can never be superseded because it is in danger of no direct rivalry from a similar species; or was poetry merely who undeveloped, though in itself the ex' tremely beautiful, infancy of a type which is now adult, and which has relinquished its charming generalities for a mode of expression infinitely better and of more practical utility ( Sculptors, singers, painters must always exist, but. need we have poets any longer, since the world has discovered how to say if it wants to say in prose ? Will anyone who has anything of importance to communicate be likely in the future to express it through the medium of metrical language? Probably there would be no need to face this question, either in this generation or for many generations to come, if it had not been for a single circumstance. The great enemies of the poets of the present are the poets of the past, and tho anti- quarts spirit of the nineteenth century has made the cessation of the publication of fresh verse a possibility. The iuiolloctuslcondition of our times differs from lau of all preceding ages in no other point so much as in its attitude toward the writings of the dead In these periods of renovation which have re- wished the lives, tures of the world, the tendency has always been to study some one class of deceased writers with affection The activity of the dead is now paramount and threatens to paralyse original writing altogether Every poetic writer of any age precedent to our own has not a chance in popularity, often very much better chance than he possessed during his own lifetime In this great throng of resuscitated souls, all of whom have forfeited their copyright, how is the modern poet to exist? He has no longer to compete —as great "his forefathers did, from Homer down to Ben " with the leading spirits of his own generation, but with the picked genius of the world At every turn the throne ing company of the ghosts impedes and disheartening modern writer, and it is no wonder if the new Orpheus throws down his lyre in despair when the road to his desire is held by such an invincible army of spectres. On the whole, however, it is highly unlikely that the antiquarian passion of our age will last Already it fives s gus of wearing out, and it will probably be succeeded by a spirit of unreasonable intolerance of the past Intellectual invention will not allow itself to be pinioned for ever by those soft and universal cords of tradition, such as slight as gossamer in itself, but overwhelming in the immense mass As for the old spots, young verse. writers may note with glee that they are being caught in the butterfly net of education, where they will soon find the attractive feathers rubbed off their wings One by one they pass into text-books and are lost. Chaucer is done for, and so is Milton ; Goldsmith is annotated, Scott is prepared for a "local examinations," and even Byron, the loose, the ungrammatical, is edited as a school book the noble army of extension lecturers will scarcely pause in their onward march. We shall see Wordsworth captured, Shelley boiled down for the use of babes, and Keats elaborately anno tated, with his blunders in classical mythology exposed The schoolmaster is the only friend the poet of the future dares to look to, for his alone has the power to destroy the loveliness and mystery which are the charm of the old poets. Even a second-rate verse writer may hope to live by the side of an Elizabethan poet edited for the Clarendon Press It is usually said, in hasty generalisation, that the poetry of the present age is unique in the extreme refinement of its exterior mechanism Those who say this are not aware that the great poets whose virile simplicity and robust carelessness of detail they applaud have, almost without exception, been scrupulously attentive to form But what is true that a care for form and a considerable skill in the technical art of verse have been acquired by writers of a lower order, and that this sort of perfection is no longer the hall-mark of a great master We may expect it, therefore, to attract less attention in the future; and although, assuredly, the bastard jargon of Walt Whitman, and kindred returns to sheer barbarism will not be accepted, technical perfection will more and more be taken as a matter of course, as a portion of the poet's training which shall be as indispensable and as little worthy of notice as that a musician should read his notes correctly Less effort, therefore, is likely to be made, in the immediate future to give pleasure by the manner of poetry, and more skill will be expended on the subject-matter Poetry, if it must at all, will deal, and probably to a greater degree than ever before, with those more frail and ephemeral shades of emotion which prose scarcely ventures to describe. The existence of a delicately organised human being is diversified by divisions and revulsions of sensation, ill- defined desires gleams of intuition, and the whole gamut of spiritual notes descending from exultation to despair, none of which have ever been adequately treated except in the hieratic language of poetry The most realistic novel, the closest psychological analysis in prose, does no more than skim the surface of the soul; verse has the privilege of descending to its depth. In the future, lyrical poetry will probably grow less trivial and less conventional, at the risk of being less popular It will interpret what prose dares not suggest. It will penetrate further into the complexity of human sensa- tion, and, untroubled by the necessity of formulating a creed, a theory, or a story, will describe with delicate accuracy, and under a veil of artistic beauty, the amazing, the unfamiliar, and even the portentous phenomena which it encounters The social revolution or evolution which most sensible people are now convinced is imminent will surely require a species of poetry to accompany its course and to celebrate its triumphs If we could foresee what form this species will take, we should know all things But we must believe that it will be democratic, and that to a degree at present unimaginable The aristocratic tradition is still paramount in all art. Kings princesses and the symbols of chivalry are as essential to poetry, as we now conceive it, as roses, stars or nightingales. The poet may be a pronounced Socialist; he may be Mr William Morris, but the oligarchic imagery pervades his work as complete as if he were a troubadour of the thirteenth century It is difficult to understand what will be left if this romantic phraseology is destroyed, but it is still more difficult to believe that it can survive a complete social revolution A kind of poetry now scarcely cultivated at all may be expected to occupy the attention of the poets, whether Socialism hastens or delays. What the Germans understand by epic verse —that is to say, short and highly finished studies in narrative— is a class of literature which offers unlimited opportunities What may be done in this direction is indicated in France by the work of M Coppee. In England and America we have at present nothing at all like it, too idyllic stories of Mr Coventry Patmore presenting the closest parallel The modern interest in the drama, and the ever grow- ing desire to see literature once more wedded to the stage, will, it can hardly be doubted, lead to a revival of dramatic poetry In religious verse something, and in philosophical verse much, remains to be done The wider hope has scarcely found a singer yet, and the deeper speculation has been very imperfectly and empirically celebrated by our poets Whether love the very central fountain of poetic inspiration in the past, can yield many fresh variations remains to be seen
