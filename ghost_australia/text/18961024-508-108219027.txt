'The main point of my charge against them is that, being a convention formed upon the model of -that now existing in France, they have proved, by^every-cfrcumEtaace of their conduct, that their sol{* purpose andJntention was, not a reform, but a subvereibn.of Parliament— not a redress -at eriey ances lnc4 legal, peaceable, and constitutional: way,, 'but^ a determined and Bystematic plan to subyert ^ie limited monarchy and free Constitn tion ofJBrltain^ and substitute in ijs place, by in timidation, force, or violence, a republic or de mpcrafcy^LB wild, as cruel, as despotic, and as abominable as j-^wt which at **»-« moment desolates France?*, ? _-, i ^.Proof of this plot was to be seen in their call ing WdbT&i;&er; Citizen— at which Skirvtag and ^aa5earot-veres€^n to smile— and In passing a rer solutlon^provlding for future meetings: ?'ShowMe'sedtUon; tell me what It laj Is it pos aibto »t !wm to «eadd«r uqtblag man linotlg falling under the name of sedition 'than this reso lution—a step actually taken by. them to carry that seditious intent against the Parliament into execution?
