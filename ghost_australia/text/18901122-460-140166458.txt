They did succeed! , j however, and a little before twelve o'clock : i the gang of section men who were! : working at an embankment some three' miles from Msperunza saw two tired, sun-! ; burned jierapirmg little figures, drugging1 j themselves slowly along the track towards j them. i | These section men were a villainous lot of! | halfrbred Indians and low-down tireasers !",c very scum of the region..vet there was not a ! man among them who was not genuinely ; pleased to see liunn.v ami Van. The law's ' were libcmlly supplieil with the hest of the i alole and other rough fare during the; i luncheon which followed, ami when after-: wards they fell asleep, tire.I out with their I long walk, they were carefully pillowed upon "U coats ami jackets, and covered up with a | piudy red and yellow - striped Navngo j blanket. Thenthe section men went bade to 1 ! their work, grinning complacently at the | quaint and primitive work of art thev left : Iwdiind them. " ; 1 The afh'nioon down-train generally passed ; this point at alsrnt a quarter past four p.m.' ; A few minutes after four o'clock the workmen were beginning tothink that it was almut. : time to remove their hand-car from the rails ' | to let the train puss, when a slight rumbling I noise, followed by a joyous and exultant shout. ; caused them to raise their heads. What they | saw was the hand-car moving oft" down the . grade towards Kspenmza, with the two boys I j»erohod triumphantly ti|M»i its edge. With j a spring several of the hull-breeds started off ; in pursuit. TJiey were swift runners, as j active as cats, hut t-iie truck had a hundred : yards the start of them, and it was every . i moment gaining speed ii|>on the steep down ' I gradient. At lirst the Indians gained rapidly ! upon it, but just as the foremost runner had . 1 come within a dozen yards or so it began to 'draw away again, and they were finally, obliged to relinquish the clutse. Then they j turned ami looked at one anotlier with ashen ' ; faces, for they knew that lx'fore the oar [reached the eml of its jonmey it would lie ■ i going at the rate of fifty miles an hour: and j they also knew that nothing could prevent its ; I lieing dashed to pieces in the dry nrroyo at I the end of the line, or save its innocent ! freight from a sudden and frightful death. | The arrival of the afternoon train from • >enver was the event of the day in K-sjieranza, nd and all those who had no regular, lami ng employment, as well ns many who had, enerally contricol to l>e on hand to receive t. It was due in Kapeninzii at half-past four, mt as often as not it was fifteen minutes or lalf an hour late. There was never any danger if collisions on the ki. and G. N*., for the up rain and the down train waited for one mother at t'aliente junction, and after that hey had the track all to themselves. This lapp.v arrangement permitted them to treat he time-table as a sort of official joke which tad bts'ii perpetrated at bend-quarters, but vhicli did Hot in the least concern them ; nnd o proceed nt tlicir "own sweet leisure. So labitually did they avail themselves olthis acility that when,ui>oii this particular after toon, the rumble of the approaching tram was leara at least twenty minutes before its chedule. time, most people who heard it ushed out to see what extraordinary eireum tancc could have produced so noteworthy departure from the usual order of events, ijpng -Totu and Kansas Jack were standing ogether in front of the emporium, and it was hey who'lirst discovered that something uti laual had occurred. "It's tlie hand-car," said lorn, a-ranng lown the track all by itself. 1 hem blanked -ooden-headed half-breeds have let it get way from them. Well, tlie galoots will ha ve » loot it home to-night, and serve emi right, oo, for their infernal carelessness. Am t she ilBt making time, thoughi" Jack amileii as an answer, ami was alxmt o turn back into tlie emporium, when svime ilillg unusual about tlie nppen ranee ol tl,e!}P iroaching car caught his l'ye. tifl'eiieil up suddenly, ami shudetl lnse.ves •ith his band. , , " l)y God 1 Tom, theres somel>o»l> "" her.^ ecried.and without wuitmgforn reply hemadc liolt for the railway line, which was pei ajis ft hundred yards distant. He gave no thought as to t c ft liilM wl,Si. danger ol au> TeS stitfin ! cfore. that tlie occupants of the murderous car were his own two cherished pets, Bunny and Van. It (lashed upon hiui like a terrible, blinding,overpowering nightmare; itstaggercd hiinforambment,butfor a moment only. A second later he was cool and collected again. Justbefore the car reached him he mode a sud den rush in the direction it was moving, and bounded high into the air. His leap was bold, well calculated, and successful, for he landed fairly upon the platform of the (lying car, hut lie was struck down immediately by one of the wildly-moving arms of the power lever,which was used to propel the machine, j He rose again, however, seized the brake, crammed it hard down, and then sank back as if exhausted. The car flew on towards the unfinished bridge, but the strong brake was now slowly and surely crushing the life out of its wild motion. Gradually it sluckened speed, slower and still move slow, and linally came to a dead stop a few yards from the edge of the dry arroyo, amidst the wild hurraliB of the excited population. " Saved!" they cried. " Saved ! Bravo •lack! Bravo! bully old Jack." j But Jack never lienrd them. When they took him up a few moments later the strong man was dead, his skull crushed in by the relentless sweep of the flying lever. With pale faces and hushed voices they bore him hack and laid him upon the floor of the great empty freight-house. The men of Esncranza, rough men, who had faced death often enough in defence of their own miserable lives, stood around hare-headed, awe-struck, and silent in the presence of this heroic self sacrifice. Presently hong Tom, who had been stand ing with folded arms and eyes bent upon the floor, lifted up his head and spoke. " Boys," he said, " their lies the bulliest man 1 ever knew and the truest friend. Some folks say he was a had man and a murderer. I tell you it's a lie. There never lived no belter, kinder-hearted man than dear old Kansas Jnc|f. lie never killed no mail as didn't deserve it, and he never said an unkind woni unless the drink was in him. He died to save the two little kiddies who hadn't had their fling yet, and was too young to die. God grant that when our turn comes vo pass in our checks we may some of us show up as well as poor old Kansas Jack." They buried biin under a great lonely cottonwood on the outskirts of the town, and Long Tom put up over his grave a rude wooden cross, upon which he carved the following epitaph:— " Here lies John Harvey,of Topeka,Kansas, lietter known as Kansas Jack: a leave man, who died to save the lives of his friends, Bunny and Van."
