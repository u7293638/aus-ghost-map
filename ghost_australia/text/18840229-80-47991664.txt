Tn every case the writer's name is required, not necessarily for publication, bnt as a guarantee of good faith.] DEAR SIR,-Can you inform me which is the safest method to adopt to secure the services of a native woman. .."I noticed on a late visit to some of the raining townships that it is becoming the rule amongst a certain class of the community to adopt one of these native women and try to civilise her after their own idea of civilisation. I believe the most approved method is to hunt down a mob of wild ones and make a selection of one of the victims, but as our laws relating to the protection of aborigines are not quite so lax as they are in some of the other colonies, and there being no wild tribes handy, I am compelled to ask your advice. Excuse me for sug- gesting that you run no risk with regard to giving me advice, because it is well known that whilst there is no end of a hubbub being kicked up about the disgraceful system of blackbirding which is rife in the South Sea Islands and elsewhere, any amount of it is not only tolerated but encouraged in our midst. Yours, tte, BRIGHAM YOUNG'S GnosT. Yam Creek.
