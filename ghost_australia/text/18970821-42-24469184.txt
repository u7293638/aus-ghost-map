LITERATURE Original Poetry. The Wreck. J.H.M. ABBOTT. The tides wash in, the [?] spice-laden breeze Stirs leaf and grass above the gleaming sands, Comes singing sadly vague across the seas From far-off years and dim forgotten lands. 'The birdß are hushed, the Sunset hails the Night, And soundless Mußioiaunts the fading light. The Moon lifta yellow out beyond the bar, And paints with gold a broad, sort-beaming traok \ The surf-bootn shakes and quivers through the air, The hills have beard and sent their echo back. Manned by JUut Bools the Wreck tacks oat once more- Dim spectral sailing towards a long-lost shore. A dream of other days lifts the dim ghost-sorrow haze, Tears the curtains of the centuries apart, Hears the hawse-chains rattle loud, sees the busy thronging orowd, Sobs the bleeding of a maiden's broken heart. The noon was wanaand fair, and a song rang through the air— The Bong of Quest of Triumph rose and fell; The c*nvas bellied white, and the flags were streaming bright- But a maiden heard the tolling of a bell. "When the sun was low and red, and its glory tinged her head . With a glinting light and shimmer of fine gold, She stood above .the rooks where the seafowl nests and flecks, Beard the message that the mournful breezes told: * You may love or you may hate, bat we know the ways of Fate; We have driven many ships across the seas. Tou have lost htm now for ever—sing tha song that men call' Never 1 •»— Was the meaning of the sighing of the breeze. Then down beyon 11 the skyline In that ev*ning of the Springtime (An even of a. Springtime Just two hundred yean Ago) Dropped the yellow snn-kissed sail, tow'ring poop and brass-bound rail \ And the surf- beat splashed its mourning on the shingle far below. A ghastly orew at nightfall hears the wailing of the Home-osll Como a-hasVning from the mountains where they laid them down and died, Bail their ship towards the open over jagged reefs and broken— Sail in fine or foulest weather, at the flooding of the tide. But one Soul sits there alone, on a broken block of stone, And hearkens to the curlew while his sailors sttil away, Be has heard no message calling, and he feels the Ages falling; Falling heavy on his shoulders tfll the Dawn of Judgment Day. And the softer winds sigh mooning as the surf if hoarsely groaatef, And the noises of the night-tine wall bis soaows to theskie.i And the dreaming of the Outcast haunts the days of all the dead past— Mourns the losing of bis Lady and the glory of her eyes. In a chancel gray and hoary, where an organ booms the Glory— Sings the Splendours and the Wisdom and the Triumphs of our God- There is carven an inscription ol a quaintly old 4a • was written by a singer "neath the v Yt «B* tiaflye of alle Sorowe shulde ever ohanoe toe borowe A moment from her weplng, or a minute from her prayre; .  Praye she share it of her kindenesse, in her pitif alle benlgnenesse, With the Boole alle overburdened of thJe gentle Ladje I eyre." The Eas^grows pole, the fresh 000 l morning wind Ripples the surface of the smoothly heaving sea, The otrds are singing solaoe to the mind; The ship sails baok, a weird dead thing to'see, Dwindles, and sinks her ribs beneath the sand; Bad ghosts rour forth and weary seek the land. The sun lifts up and gilds tho mountain tops, The tide conies swirling o'er the bar again, Half hides a rusting cannosi ere it stops Swirling, and sighing like a heart in pain. The tpeotres fade and vanish from the dawn, The waves aglitter hail another morn. Wingen, N.RW.
