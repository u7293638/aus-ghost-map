A HEAL LIVE GHOST. Yes, 1 have seen a ghost, a real live one. 1 was a soldier, and on guard duty at Windsor Castle. Several young soldiers had been scared when on sentry at the midnight vigil inside tho cloisters oi fti. ueorgo s cnnpei, anu nau qiuuoa their posts; a most serious military crime, entailing exemplary punish ment. Determined to elucidate tho mystery, 1 secured the confidence of tho sergeant, und was detailed to take over this parti cular post at tho witching hour. In a secluded part of the cloisters (a most gloomy piaee, ecu in the daylight) wjls n door leading to tho private npurtnvnis of one of the resident clerical GflU-lnh. Taking up my station on the shady side of tills door, I waited with hated breath, for tne ghost to appear. Presently the door was stealthily opened, and a figure emerged entirely draped in white, and walked with ghostly strides towards tho jdr.ee where the sentry Is usually posted. Quick as lightning I shut tho door with a loud slain, and the ghost, giving a frantic scream, Mow towards It, and throwing off the white lublecloth, 'dis closed tho bewitching form and pretty features of Mary Ann, the housemaid of the said clerical olllclal. It is needless to add that "Mum" was the word, und since sonic years have elapsed no harm can he done by the re cital of how I laid the "Ghost of the Cloisters."
