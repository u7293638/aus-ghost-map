I will uot bother the compositors and reader by attempting to. .preserve tlie old fellow's peculiar phraseology, but will give the story as I heard it as nearly as I can, -without sacri \--acing orthography, or ma'viug any great breaches in Prisciau's i.eai, or a fool of Eoyself by a landsman's misuse of the. nautical lingo. ' In the year 'twenty-six,' said Chips, ?'jttst when I was out of my time, I took my head to go whaling, not as carpta&er;, but before the mast. I shipped on board the old one of Gale's of I)ej)tford. We took in some Shet ?lan&ers; at' Lerwick, as whalers mostly do, as hardly chaps as any afloatbut :one of them died* before we'd .left Ronas Head a month. He was a strange, silent fellow, that was always looking ©vet his shoulder in the forecastle at night, as if he expected to see something. We chaffed him about it at first, but he wasn't a safe man to plague. Bis mates told us all kinds of queer yarns about him ; that he'd been away from the Islands for ever so long, and that nobody knew where he'd been ta. All that he'd say was .that he'd -been in the ' Spanish service,' and some made out that that meant a slaver, some a pirate, some one .thing, some another ; but none of them any good. The Shet landers don't mind smuggling, but .they are quite a .pious people in the main, rand they didn't relish the way in which this man cursed and «wore, and was for ever sneering at the kirk. He struck-a minis ter one day when he'd got the. horrors, and the parson had . #one to look after him ;, saying, ' that he didn't want- any spies .about, bis bed.' His eyes were storing at the wall on one side of him, as if some one was standing there. They said .that he had got the horrors ; but, as; I've .told you, he had always that frightened Jook in the dark, even when he was quite sober. Something bad was on;his mind, that's very certain. " The day he died he was queerer than ever, I keeping out of the way of everybody as much as lie could, rolling his eyes about like a mad-,; wan, .talking to hiuiself, and as paleas a sheet. . YouId better turn in, Gait,! the doctor said. to him.; and down he went without a word, ati^l preeen! fcv the doctor sent himsome-stuff. thilikiug he was in a fever. My bunk was next to his. and -when 1 turnedin at. eight bulls 1 could hear himjbissing tU^ugh liis; clenchr-d teeth, just as if he Avas trying to keep in a tshrfek. It was luueli such a night as this, only there «was a deal more ice ranging about than iwhat weVc seen.' I «oou fell -asleep, :lor we? had been raakjngoff.blubber all day, and I had.' got quiie tired over the casks. I might hare been asleep about a couple of hours, when 1 was woke by a horrid scream-as if a soul was just draping an to the lower regions. 1 tumbled out in next sp no time, And so did the other chaps, and we all came crowding round Gait's berth. He was squeezed up against the «ide (we could see, when we lifted up the Ian 'tern) asif he wanted to drive his back into the wood, and was striking out "with his right hand clutched as ifjie'd got a knife in it, and hia left with all the fingers , spread out. His face was a horrid sight. It was as white and as wet as the.side of <a chalk-pit, and his eyes were regularly a-lighf with.rage and fear. ' I don't know which there was the most of in them. \- ' Take her ofi ! take her off j' be yelled, when lie saw us. ' Yon won't 1 won't yon, you lyiliians? Then, confound yau^ go to t>lazes with me.l I'll haunt you, and sink the jljip. !! " And then his face gave ,a> twitch like?--a .devil trying..to -laugh, and -he fell over on it dead^with' 'hie' arrasstill stiff. We could hard* ly get them down byjais ?sijies without leak ing .them. The next-day but- one11'we buried him, and-you may believe me or not, as vou ?liKe-but I can tell "you. that his body didn't drop into the sea, -but was cLragged. down tlie moment he teuehed thfe water. "The first slacij;:i&4rtoatils the ship per had his chest brought up/atid triedto sell his things; butnone'of us.wbuld bid- so the sKipper-and the doctor,.tliKe good fellows, bid against each other, toget ^a good round sum for his poor old mother, w&otp; he'jd flexerCared about, his mates told us. We didn't bid, be cause we didn't Ihin K it would be. lueKy " to put on anything that snch a man as he had Worn ; but we made out a list of what each of us would give to the old girl, and gave it to. ? the BKipper to be stopped oat «f our .pay.. ? "Nevertheless, after that, we Tiad nothing but misfortunes. Next to no -fishrcame-in sight. Scarce one of those that did come, could we get jiear j and when we, happened to atriKe ;one. the line was sure to breaK. O&c; of the j boats, too, went down all of a sudden, just as I tr it had been swallowed. -Gait was 'haunting us sure enough. We .didn't see anything of. "him, however, untiL-tne sun set for good. We .'were lying then, frozen up, inagreat^floe. some sixty miles N. W. of fhe Devil's Thumb. We could Just mace it out when the $un 'dipped^- ? not to come up; again ^for weess toeomc; There we were fairly shut in^or lfee whole winter. ? Well we were sawing: out a aocK for the ship ; f<jr the ship by moonlight, when suddenly the bears had done -growling, and the . waives howling, for a bit, and everything except tibe' grating saws waa still as death, for there-wasn't a breath of wind blowing-aH of .a sudden, i ray, we -heard shricKs and laughing. We KnoeKfld olf worK. and ran aboard -a minute -we were so scared : and when we ventured to loc.x over the hulwarK .. there, about 1v. ~, m 'us off. wecouIJ see the boat's CJVW we brj lost rnshing through the mist, as big as giants, and Gait after them, even bigger, stri icing out just as he did when he died. "Another time, we made out some .water a mile off, with a whale .floundering sabont -on it, as if she was puzzled how to get -out. We launched the boats over the ice, gave -cliase,. and Killed her, and towed -her alongside the ; floe to flinch. We were glad enough of the; crang ourselves, for we had been- on short al-j lowaneefor a long time.
