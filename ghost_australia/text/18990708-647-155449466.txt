-Ritualism v. Methodism. TO THE EDITOR. gIB) â€” I hope that all interested in the great Eitualistio controversy now raging in England will very carefully read Mr. Boyer's articles appearing in your columns. I hope also, in the words of the Prayer Book, that they will read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, for there is much need. Ritualism is trying to show its head here as elsewhere, but, like vice, ' it is a monster of such hideous mein, that to be hated needs but to be seen.' Eitualism is much more dangerous than Romanism. We know the nature of the latter, but the former, with its arrogance and deceit, its doctrine of reserve, and its dark ways, who can tell what it is doing ? Every one who wiBhes to preserve intact the principle of the Reformation and religion pure and tindefiled, should carefully read Walsh's 41 Secret History of the Oxford Movement.' If that does not rouse them, nothing will. That book tells us in what light the High Church clerics are pleased to regard Metho diBts. Take one or two gems : ' It is sohismatical to attend Dissenting Meeting HouseB, or to subscribe to, or assist the sectarian objects of dissenters in any way. The same cannot be said of Roman Catho lic Churches.' The Holy Ghost 'does not make His home in any Dissenting sect. We call these people Dissenters, and their sham churches sects. The Holy Ghost does not abide with, them.' The Bible is the book which God has given to His Ohurch, and it belongs to the Church alone, and not to any Dissenting sect.' To my knowledge these fabrications are being taught in this district. Yours, etc., Riveiuna.
