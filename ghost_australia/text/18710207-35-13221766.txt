£t)£ ÄBötuB Jtflomíng ggeratt« TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1871. A Bill before the Legislative Assembly to 1 amend the Cattle Slaughtering Act of 1856 has occasioned complaints from some of our correspondents ; others maintain that its provisions are necessary. It is for the Legislature to look at the question in all its bearings, and to arrive at a conclusion which may satisfy not those who may make fastidious objections, but all who may have causes of reasonable complaint. We lay it down as a principle established by modern legislation that the lives of the people are the great care of Government. To preserve them when they are in danger will justify sacrifice of both public and private property. To guard against such dangers as may ultimately lead to the peril of human life is also within the range of law and administration. It is upon this principle the country has proceeded in reference to burial grounds, several of which have been recently subject to restrictions, preparatory to their absolute closure. At Newtown, for example, the burial ground is private property.' The shares long yielded a very large annual income. When the ground was opened for burial, the country around was unoccupied to a large extent. No objection was made by law, to the establishment of the cemetery ; indeed, it was considered to be a public convenience. Every reason, therefore, which affects the rights of property seemed to protect the interests of the shareholders. Nevertheless the law wisely put a stop to interments, and protected the surrounding population at the sacrifice of private interests, after a fair and full discussion of the danger to health and life. The people who enter into certain lines of business, which are of a pernicious nature, must take into account this unquestionable power of law to consider safety of life paramount to every consideration whatever. It is not sufficient to say that the people have gone to the spot which has become pernicious to health. This does not deprive them of the right to the interference of the Administration. The fact that they are living in large numbers on the spot has been considered to constitute the paramount reason for protecting them against their own mention. These principles being admitted, there can be no doubt that the law did what it was entitled to do when it entered certain prohibitions against the continuance of establishments in the city which were once in- nocuous, but which the growth of population made pernicious, if not destructive. It is, however, for the public interest in a very high degree that no needless interference should interrupt the establishment of manufactures that can be carried on without serious mischief to health. The mere nuisance, if it amounts to less than this result, may be great; but it would be often a fair answer to those who suffer from it, '. You went into the neighbourhood of the nuisance, and therefore you must endure it." There are other cases where the interest established is so great that it cannot be removed without inflicting much injury, and in these the interference of law should be exceedingly rare, and accompanied with all those precautions which may prevent the removal from being an act of spoliation the result of spite and ill-will. There are two courses by which this may be prevented. Some Trades are so extremely pernicious that they ought to be carried on in places exclusively devoted to their use; the slaughter- ing of cattle, for example, especially where there is an insufficient natural supply of water, and where the land is low, is obviously dangerous to health. There may be other trades of the same nature and if they are not interdicted, they still ought to be watched and guarded by proper regulations. The bill introduced by Mr. Farnell, however, makes no change in the provisions of the Cattle Slaughtering Act in reference to the nature of the establishments interdicted. This Act applies at present to any city or town to which its operation has been or can be! extended by the vote of a majority at a public meeting, and the subsequent proclamation of the Governor. It is proposed by the amending bill to make it applicable to boroughs and municipal districts, and to (apply the machinery of the Municipalities Act to ascertain the will of the people. The waters must be ratepayers, and may be entitled to cumulative votes, thus giving a preponderance to property in a question where property is largely concerned. An amendment of the law in the manner proposed may not be without its advantages even to those who are engaged in noxious trades. It will perhaps in some instances prevent them from establishing their business in localities which are unsuitable, and from which they would be likely to be driven by the force of public opinion. According to the municipal law, a municipality cannot interfere to prevent the establishment of a noxious trade within its limits until a nuisance is actually created ; whereas, when a city, town, or district is brought under the operation of the Cattle Slaughtering Act, people who desire to esta- blish such trades will be forewarned, and go into more favourable localities to carry on their works. Such a bill, if it worked harshly in some cases, would in others give a real power to communities of manufacturers. Such communities, composed for the most part of the proprietors and their workmen, and persons engaged in the subsidiary trades which depend upon their industry, would furnish a large majority of signatures to any petition in opposition to the extension of the provisions of the Cattle Slaughtering Act, or to the bill to amend it On such a question it is necessary to be governed by practical knowledge of the probable operation of these changes. While the Legislature has to be careful of the health of the people, it ought not to hinder their industry. In ancient times, the law set apart certain districts for particular callings, and those which were likely to be injurious were nearest to the rivers, so that they might have the advantage of ever-flowing water. We, in our greater freedom, allow men to establish themselves where they please, and then permit their molestation, not indeed for frivolous reasons, but such as might have been easily foreseen. All we can hope for is, that the formalities imposed by the law may prevent injustice to individuals without sacrificing the public. There is a common law right, which belongs to all the holders of property, to abate a nuisance, and which is not abolished by the Slaughtering Act, or the bill proposed for its amendment. Au- the late Intercolonial Exhibition, some samples were shown of cloth made at Geelong by the Victorian Woollen and Cloth Manufacturing Company, and which competed fairly with similar productions from this colony. So far as the quality of the article produced is concerned, it would seem that our neighbours and competitors are to be congratulated, but, financially considered, we find that the enterprise is a failure. The cloth cannot find a sale at a remunerative price. The company has a six months' stock on hand, and can only keep its machinery running half time and in order to make the investment a paying one the shareholders desire a heavy protective duty. This is an illust section of the experience which has led the thorough-going Protectionist party in Victoria to put forward demands in excess of anything they had previously broached. The ad valorem duties were passed out of deference to their political influence, and as adapted to be a great blessing to the country. This was experiment number one in the direction of protection. It was to benefit the country by raising wages and finding profitable employment for artisans, and a good invest- ment for local capital. In these respects it has proved a failure. The artisans are working half-time, and the capitalists are receiving less than half dividends. Their first recommendations having proved fallacious, the protectionists are now anxious that the country should try experiment number two, and propose that the colonists should be compelled to buy colonial productions, by putting what are virtually prohibitory duties on articles that can be locally produced. They do not appear to be troubled with any" compunctions or any modest self-distrust in consequence of the break-down of their first promises, and are just as fluent as ever of predictions of the abounding prosperity that will flow from making the people pay a high price for an inferior article and of course, they are just as vehement as ever in denouncing the stupidity and selfishness of those who think that cheapness is better than dearness-that fair play to all is better than class legislation that competition is better than monopoly, and that it is a foolish rejection of the advantages of the age in which we live to restrict commercial intercourse to the level of the age | in which there were no telegraphs, no railways, and no steamboats. But though they seem quite ready to go to any degree of extravagance themselves, they do not find it quite so easy to drag all their former victims after them. Sir James M'Cut.t.ocii, who previously surrendered to them his influence, if not his convictions, demurs to being pushed on at such a rapid rate. In his address to the electors he does not say he will not budge a step further, but he does positively say that he will not go the length of prohibition. At the same time he has to a certain extent placed himself under the screw, and it is not in his power to name the exact number of turns which it shall receive. free trade is an intelligible principle, protection is an intelligible principle, and a politician may take up his stand on either ; but those who go in for compromising the two principles, and are willing to have a little of both in order to make it pleasant all round, cannot draw a hard and fast line anywhere. Sir James M Cl/i.ent says:-" The present tariff was proposed by the Government, and accepted by the country, for the purpose of imposing duties on goods that can be manufactured here without unduly sacrificing revenue, and in my opinion it has been so framed as to have been highly successful in securing the objects for which it was proposed." But this statement is somewhat ambiguous, for in the first place it is always open to question as to how much sacrifice of revenue is an i undue sacrifice, and in the second place it is also open to question, whether the tariff has been " highly success- ful," seeing that some of the manufacturing industries are in difficulties. Sir James therefore is open to be squeezed to a certain degree, unless he can show to his protectionist friends that to make any further sacrifice of revenue would be to pass the proper limit, or unless he can satisfy the shareholders in the manufacturing concerns that their investments have been 'a highly successful." It is not surprising, however, that he should intimate that there are limits beyond which he will not go. With the experience before him of the recent elections in the United States, i he must see clearly that the tide of public opinion is there turning. The Civil "War indeed, seems likely to do as much for fi eedom of trade as it did for the freedom of the slave. It precipitated and intensified the development of the protectionist policy. It gives full swing to the tactics of the protectionist party, but now the country is brought face to face, not with theories that might mislead, but with facts which it is impossible to gainsay. A degree of protection which has stopped short of prohibition, and which averages forty- five per cent, all round, has destroyed some branches of American industry and crippled others, and is oppressing the great agricultural class simply to benefit the mechanical class Some- thing like an insurrection against this policy has now set in. The democratic party, which is strong in the agricultural West, and strong in the agricultural South, has gained greatly at the late elections, and has reduced its minority in the House of Representatives from ninety three to fifty Another such victory and it will be abreast of its in all It does not, of course, profess free trade That would be too great and sudden a change ; and the enormous revenue required to pay the heaviest on the war debt compels for the present a petty stiff tariff But the speakers of the party talk free trade, and that is a refreshing novelty) in American politics The truth is beginning to dawn upon the minds of the people, and the majority, who are the sufferers by the tariff, are beginning not only to feel where the shoe pinches, but to see who it is that has fitted the shoe A free discussion of the whole question having now become possible, the Americans still high fail to find their way to the light conclusion, and their example which has hitherto been so unfortunate, will soon be on the side of economical truth and the day is not far distant when their tariff will be re formed, and its protectionist extravagance broken down Mr Ward, the truthful Commissioner of 'Trade, whose official reports disclosed the real state of the case, has been turned out of office, but a persecution of this kind will neither drown his voice, nor drown his figures, and the mass of the American people, once disabused of the idea that protection is necessary for their national glory and the confusion of the Britisher, will find that to give fair play to all classes will exhibit their country in its greatest attractiveness and will bestow on its mha bitants the greatest possible degree of xx eil being District Court - The following is the Cause List for to day Butler and others v Wilson, Richards v Sullivan, Simmons v Elliot, Simmons v Hull, Kinsela and others v Chard, Roberts v Blomgren, Milford v Cleary, Keep v M Donald, Barton v bant bike, Bennett v Dawson, Cam v Gardiner, Smith v Id Egan, Smith v Douglas Smith v Beauchamp, Smith v Dixon Nixon v O Hear, Mod it v Cor, Ashlin v Rice, M Neil v Dick, M Neil v Driscoll, M Nam ira v Maunsell, Collins v Moore and others, Marshall v Were jun, Barden v Cartwright, Cubitt v Cutler, D'Arcy v Blunt, Hanson and another v 1) Brien, Bennett v O liner, Hanson and another v Owen and another, Parfitt y Hill has ins x Logue and D vl/iell -The hon the Attorney General having gone over the depositions in the case of Joseph Logue and Catherine Dalziell, committed from the Coroners Court on a charge of man slaughter for having, caused the death of an infant female child, named Ada Jane Logue, has declined to file a bill against Logue on the ground that the evidence taken at the Coroner s Court did not disclose a prima facie case against him J LECTURE -Last evening, Mr J P Garvan delivered a lecture in the Sacred Heart Hall, in connection with the Sacred Heart "Temperance Society, on "Intern perance its effects, and whit Ireland has lost by it The hall was crowded The Rev J Cunninghame presided The lecture was most ittt nth of ely listened to, and at intervals Mr Garvan was warmly applauded At the close, on the motion of Mr J G O'Connor, a unanimous vote of thanks was awarded to the lecturer A similar compliment was paid to the chairman A number of the audience signed the pledge before separating Mr Ivey was Schoolroom -There was held last evening in the above schoolroom in connection with the Perseverance Division of the Sons of 1 temperance, a public meeting in advocacy of temperance principles the chair being, occupied by Mr. Pickering AA P 1 here were about three hundred persons g gathered together in the room, which, owing to the closeness of the evening was felt to be uncomfortably, filled A number of young" men, whom sense of decency or self respect might have re- (trained from making a public exhibition of themselves is, to the annoyance of the large and more respectable portion of the audience, kept up at the begining of the proceedings a series of the most senseless interim] lions An eloquent address, in which the speaker advocated teetotalism, was delivered by Mr Cnsror<l, missionary of St Barnabas Church Recitations were given by Messrs Johnson and Daw son and songs were sung by Messrs.

imported in the use of the Insurance Fire Brigade, which took place at Prince Alfred Park on tuesday last, being-, through a scanty supply of water, but partially successful, a second test was made of its car abilities j ester lay afternoon, at Barwon Park, St, Peters, Cook's River, the residence of Alderman 1 hollins Bovin It being the usual monthly practice of the bundle, as soon as the Insurance firemen had arrived on the ground, a trial was made of the old steam engine, which, like the now one, is from the in must picturing firm of Shand, Mason. and Co., of Upper Ground street, Blackfriars Road, London Streams from lets of various duties sins were thrown with much success by means of the old steamer After the arrival on the ground of various gen I turned - among whom were noticeable Mr Sutherland, ii L A (late Minister for Works) Alderman Woods Alderman Bown, Mr Robert Stewart (of Barham st-street)', Captain None (Marine Surveyor), Mr Broderick, Mr. Thomson (Sydney Insurance Office), Mr Jack (Victoria Office), Mr Ireland (Royal Office), (Ingham Clark (Liver- pool and London), and Messrs T Forsyth and James the event of the day was set about fire was quickly got up in the new steamer, in twelve minutes a pressure of 100 lbs. to the square inch was obtained, and the machinery, which has a very complicated jet neat appearance, was set in motion by the new engine the boiler tubes are horizontal, and interlaced instead of vertical, as in the old one, the result being that a greater steam power is obtained. 'The whole of the working gear, instead of being as in steamers of other patterns st uttered till round the machinery, has been conveniently placed close together on one side. The consequence is, that the engineer obtains a much greater command over the gearing than he could otherwise have There are three outlets, to which triple sets of hose are attached The number of hose may be, if thought desirable, increased by bracing at some distance from the fire engine 'There could not have been a better supply of water to the trial than that found in the lagoon at Barwon Park As soon as the pressure of 100 lbs. had been obtained, jets were attached to the lines of those with four jets, each baths of an inch, all working at the same time from the motive power supplied by the new engine, a distance of 125 feet was reached, with three lots, of the of an inch, a high stream was thrown 100 feet, which was in creased to 170. On the lowering of the jets, the pressure being then 102 lbs and the number of revolutions over two hundred per minute, with two jets, each an ii oh in diameter, the distance made with an altitude of f I can fifty to sixty feet, was 150 feet, with a bore of 12 inches, (160 feet were cleared, and the stream, on being turned against a number of high trees, lopped off the branches with great facility, and it perpendicular height of nearly seventy feet was obtained with a single lot of 12 inch over 110 foot was spanned, and with one of li more Dearly 110 feet. After the completion of the test con- ducted by Mr. Superintendent C Bown, and which was considered by all present to be highly satisfactory Mr. Alderman 1 Down, with a few appropriate remarks, named the engine The Fire King " Mr. C. Bown corgi mulcted the Insurance Offices on such a valuable acces- sit n to their already efficient plant. The trial lasted an hour and a quarter, the average pressure during the time was lOulbs , number of revolutions, 140 per minute. The finances of water thrown is estimated at two tons per minute The visitors were then invited to partake of a luncheon provided by M Compagnoni, at Mr Down's residence the chair being occupied by Mr Thomson, and the vice-chairs Captain Clark. After full justice had been done to the viands, a number of toasts were disposed of; amongst them were "The Queen," " Ihehealthof Aldermen Bown, coupled with that of Mrs Bown," " Mr C Bown, the Insurance Fire Brigade Superintendent," "The Insurance Companies," " City Council," " Houses of Legis- lature," and "The Chairman and W vice-chairman."

He alluded to the slight which had been put upon Wordsworth by his contemporaries, and the patient confidence with which he had worked on secure in the knowledge that posterity would honour him as he deserved to be honoured Mr. Iv-ouiuus planned for AVoidsyvorth a very high position in the ranks of English poets- said that, while Milton was remarkable for grandeur and sublimity, and Shakespeare for the anniversary of his genius, Wordsworth's great characteristic, was depth. There was in his poetry great profundity wonderful union of metaphysics and natural feeling. He went on to describe the poet's life the home of his infancy in Cumberland-the mountain solitudes in which his mind was nurtured-and the unobtrusive quiet of his later years, fey eral passages were quoted from Wordsworth s " Ode to Haydn," " intimations of immortality," and other poems, 'The lecture was very interesting, and at its close the lecturer was loudly applauded.
