' .Some-vain longing in her own heart lived and died many times, ns, these palo, leaden days crept on into the weary nights.

Many a night sho hoard her uncle, ns usual, on the, threat,dust-laden stairs-case carrying his dead flowers to the lumber room, but whether, in sloop, or wakefulness,sho knew nob; she never crept up to watob him again. ' ! At last a letter came to her from Lady Hartlaud. As she ..opened it her hands trembled, her checks burned with, a glowing .

' thoy rdstod on hor pretty figure and fair face, flushed with hope.' His voice shook a'little as ho said, “Yob, I wlill .fiit up for you." ; And then she closed the door, and loft him atono with the ghost 1 of his dead.

Then sho loii her up to a chosen group or two, and intro diicscu her as “my husband’s graud-daughtor, Hiss Avondale. ” Lastly, sho brought up to hhr chair a toll, limp young man, lopsided as to sliouldera, and' wonderfully long necked. t“My dear, this is yoiir cousin, Lord Avon dale,” she said, “And"'tho. veritable prince," sho whispered, laughingly. i“ Charmed, I’m sure, to know so ohonuing oj cousin,” said Lord Avondale. “Will you dance?” ; , j “ Oh, no !” said Amy, glancing at hor dross.

I saw ray cousin first last Sunday with Mr. Wiley. ” “What cousin?" exclaimed Lady Hartland. . “Young Mr. Maxwell,” sho answered. There w'n's a moment’s blank silence; then with her keen eyes all ablaze the old lady said in a low voice: “This is a very singular pro ceeding. ” “Singular, indeed," observed Mr. Mere dith. “ It must be enquired into. ” i“You arc sure it was your cousin, my dear?”' ; “Quite sure, Lady Hartland. He told mo ho was Mr. Maxwell, and ho made mo promise him not to lot his father know ho was in London. ” “And you havo kopt your word?" “Yes; and it has been very painful to me.” “But you must still keep it, interposed Mr. 'Meredith, eagerly. “You must promise me now not to pain Mr. Maxwell by letting him know his worthless son is in London.” ; “HushI hush I you are too harden that, young maii. Now, toll mo what sort of a ereaturd is this.cousin to look at,” said .Lady Hartland. i Amy described him, not without some terms of repugnance, while both listened to Her intently. ... j [ “ And ho has waylaid you once or twice. idnco?” asked Lady Hartland, ! “ Yes,, and always to importune mo ; to ad tint him into Uio house in my uncle’s absence. 1 “You must never do that, mind. .The man is a thorough scamp,’’exclaimed the Dowager. !
