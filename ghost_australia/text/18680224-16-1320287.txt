THE CHRONICLES OF SSAGPAT. The Hatching on the Bill. Warn, the Caliph was about to depart, and while the people of the land suffered, inasmuch as the finger of taxation pressed heavily upon their loins, it came to pass that the Vizier who had ruled over the inhabitants were dismissed, and new ones of the sect of the sheep washers were to be taken in their place, and one Hubble Rebbeck, who was ferocious in appearance, and picked his teeth in the presence of the councillors, got to himself two who were of lean and hungry aspect, and had before time been in the service of tho Caliph, and profited him nothing and their names where Whnnpeeror, who presided over the followers of the fiddle, and Con fussed, who dwelt in the regions of bewilderment and the three begged au Effendi of the law to preserve them from breaking the statutes of the country, and when he had consented they ruled over the land Now, it befell that in those days the nation looked for the hatching of a bird which should be of the breed of that goose which in old tune laid eggs of gold, and which was of the nature of the Lands bills for from old time it had been declared that the eggs which it should lay should cause fatness to the souls of the people And when Bubble bubble and his friends heard the cry of the multitude they assembled the counsellors and scribes, and they who doused the laws, and said unto them, "Lo, we me about to incubate on an egg which is of the race of the Lands bille, and thence shall we hatch that which the souls of the multitude desire " And the cottuBcllors replied, " It is well, that which is spoken do you incubate, and we shall see what will come thereof " and the scribe of the assembly recorded the words, and gunned But it was so that the counsellors were divided in opinion as to what this long wished for fowl should be, and what should be the color of its eggs Add certain of they who had flocks and herds, and were the slaves of the goblins of gold, claimed that the yolk of the eggs should be theirs as of their right, whereby they might increase in strength, and rescue them from the chains wherewith they were riveted But there were found of the profane and intermeddling who worshipped not the goblins, and derided then slaves, who affirmed that their bondage was of their own creation, and that the eggs should be for all But heroin was the lack of wisdom that none know what sort of bud should begin duced by the incubation of Hubble bushel and the other vmers, nor whether the egg might not be added in the course of thereof Nevertheless, they continued to dispute until the time drew nigh for the hatching of the fowl, and they held the breath of expectation And on the appointed day Confudtseed arose in the assembly of the learned, and withdrawing the coverings from the cage of state produced therefrom a decrepid and ungainly fowl, which he declared was descended from certain birds of like kind which, in the days of old, had belonged to one Tiberius Gracchus, a heathen of doubtful re- known But when the creature was shaken, its feathers dropped away from it one by one, until to the astonishment of the friends of Hubble rubbed it gave a feeble cackle, and, falling upon one side, made as if it were about to give up the ghost And Hubble but beef and his prophets roared aloud in their vexation, and Wlumpeerei betook himself to his fiddlers, but the soul of their goose decayed v> Ullin it, despite of their forms and their fiddling, both by day and by night And there arose great strife between the learned as to the nature of the strange fowl that lay shivering before them But there were two physicians who had come from a far distance to prescribe for the hatching of the land bills, which was to lay the eggs of vitality, and they were friends of Hubble rubbed and his followers And, as is the nature of friends in such assemblies, they revived the Vizier Confudt Jed, and spat upon the divan, and declared the bird that had been intended to be but a very form goose, and unfit even to live And Hubble rubbed into his board", and picked his teeth, wd Whimpeercr commanded his fiddlers to Play and recited an ode But the Effendi of the law closed his eyes in sleep, and saw not the 3rd And the finger of perplexity was on the "ps of the eloquent Now one of these physicians was a man of smooth aspect, and pleasant in the fluency of tongue and the other had written certain books on the genealogy of the sacred bird, and was mighty in drawing the bow And when they had discoursed a space, an old Vizier of great renown arose, and, stroking the chin of wisdom, bade the two physicians and the Vizier Confudtseed to take up the bird, and carry it into a secret chamber, and there devise what should be done a d at fit seasons report to the loan red what had been done Then they who had been perplexed were relieved, and the bird being carried away as was bidden, the scribe of that assembly) wrote the record in the books thereof, and-gnuncd ' And after a space the two physicians and the vizier Confudtseed brought back the bird which they had taken And lo, its feathers had grown and its courage was restored, and it held up its head and called as a bird might that should lay multitudes of eggs And the physician smooth of aspect and gracious m words, declared that they had fed it upon a corn called homesteads, by reason of which health had returned to its soul But it was marvellous to see how that neither in shape not plumbago nor color was it in anywise . like unto the unsavory fowl which had been committed to the chamber of secrecy Never i theless Hubble rubbed swore that it was the bird which he had helped to hatch, and waved yellow with indignation when this was denied Howbeit, the Mondiof the law declares that he understood not the transformation, while the mists of bewilderment enshrouded his mind And he shook his head throat and looked wise , but the semblance of wisdom sat not on the countenances of the other Vuiors And when the learned in the assembly saw all that they were wroth And one Loo leo, n magician, who knew the law, spoke the words, and the bird became armed with sharp claws, and its beak glistened with keenness, so that certain fine animals called " dummies," which the ages of the sheep washers kept, should not prey upon its eggs And an ancient expert, who partook of the nature of tho ghoul, inasmuch as he derived sustenance from dead men, recited wonderful incantations And n sago, who prophesied day by day) what should be, stroked the bird with the hand of patronage, and it grew and flourished, and great was the contention touching the disposal of the eggs which it was assumed it would la) And when the most honorable counsellors of the land heard this he) desired to know of the bird whose fame was waxing great abroad And the three prescribed baths having been given into it, it was carried in sacred so lemnity, and with the accustomed g)allons, to the hall of cedar wherein the) sun And when they beheld the sharpness of its beak, and of its claws, certain who were possessed by the ages of the sheep washers became troubled with fits, and howled and when news was brought thereof to the Vizier Whimpoeroi in the assembly of the learned, he seized his fiddle and executed the dance of war But it befell that, stumbling over the great loss of Bubble bubble, he was prostrated, and the fiddle he bore was cracked, and thenceforth the glory departed from it and from him But the most honorable counsellors, although they loved not the bud, assembled, and the) fed it with new food, and took from it the homestead which the physicians had given to it, and the claws of the magician leo leo, and, moreover, they filed its beak, and its plumage dwindled, and its shape was distorted and when they had thus dealt with it and had it carried to the assembly of the learned, and said, " lo, there is the bud ye dismal, behold and see if it be not as ye would " And when Hubble bubbLe of and the ATiziora saw it they were in doubt But when they had looked for awhile and considered that it was held of comb, long and weak in the shanks, and swayed its tail to and fro as it waddled, they beheld their own image, and embraced it as if it had been as it came from their own incubation And the physicians who came from afar oil were divided thereon Then the magician, Lee Leonard the epnitwho partook of the nature of the shoal, and the sago vi he foresaw what was to happen, arose, and, with the physician of smooth aspect and gracious language, and they who were like minded, betook themselves to their accusations, and behold they restored the claws and sharpened the book And when homered of purity was not to be found, they administered that which was of the next best, and so the bud retired, and grew less and less like that which had been first hatched, and the image of the three Viziers faded therefrom But a certain hour of the mines, who had absconded from a black pit known to men as such rom, emitted a pestilential odour, which befouled oil on whom it fell to destroy it Inasmuch however as he was blinded therewith himself, he know not all times which was the order should fall, and thence it happened ascertain time that a large mensuiotheicof bccainoblowndown the tin out of Hubble rubbed, whose breath over after partook of the evil nature of that order But the bird sustained no harm thereby And when the most honorable counsellors heard of this, they were dismayed Nevertheless they declared that they would destroy) the bird they hated , but, by reason of foal, strength was not in them. So it came to pass that the order was given, scaled with the seal of the Caliph, and adorned with the image of the Sultan, that the bird lande bills should be respected as the descendant of the goose which laid golden eggs in the old time, and should be left to distribute the like vitality) on the land But the people who looked on saw not with certainty that the bird would lay the eggs they de sired inasmuch as Hubble rubbed and Whim ' pepper and Confudtseed declared it was hatched in accordance with their own heart and no one who knew the first shape of the fowl to heed the word of truth to be in them and moreover the keeping of the bad was to be committed to certain priests of the god "Board," whereof one, who acted with a strong desire of sleep all whom he would destroy, loved not the bird, or its beak and claws Wherefore they feared that the laying of the golden eggs would be slow, and that the people might not profit thereby) And there were of the learned in the assembly of senses and counsellors who were perplexed with like doubts So while many hoped, there yet remained perplexity in the land
