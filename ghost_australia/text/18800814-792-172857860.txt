" TILL THE PRATIES GROW." (Nation.) [WHEN Father John Murphy, whose life has been published reoently by Messrs. Gill and Son, -was parish priest of Corofin, in the oounty of Olare, he had to fight the hardest battles of his life in trying to oheokmate the untiring efforts of prosslytdsm. A parishioner of his was tempted by sore need to renounce his faith, ana, in consideration of a weekly stipend, agreed to go to the ProteBtant church regularly and aot in every way liko a reformed sinner. On the first Sunday after entering into this agreement he was sulkily proceeding to the new place of worship, but having to pass the chapel on his way his conscienoe smote him, and, throwing himself on his knees before the humble edifice of prayer, cried out, " I m goin' from ye, alanna—good-bye, good-bye —till the praties grow!"] ASTHOKE, my heart is breakin' as I pass your holy door, An' see the open portal all invitin* to go in, An' hear the childher's voices as in saored song they soar, The priest's subdued " Or- musand the people's loud " Amin!" But oh ! I dare not enter, for a compact I have made, Like Lucifer at Heaven's gate no farther can I go; Don't frown on me, my darlin', nor a broken heart upbraid, Good-bye, asthore alanna—till the praties grow! Ah! nivir did I think, agrah, that I should pass you by "Without an adoration made before your holy fane; Bat oh ! the pinchin' hunger—I can't hear my childher cry, The livelong day for vittles, an' still hear them cry in vain ; I can't behold my darlin* wife lyin' sick before my eyes, An' hear her in a fever fierce bewailin' all our woe; I cannot do all this, agrah, an* stay in you and grace, So now good-bye, alanna, till the praties grow. I'm .passin' by your angels, an' I'm passin' by your saints, But oh ! the weary trouble an' the hard an' bitter year! An' you know when the flesh is weak the proudest spirit faints— While you point up to Heaven, we are smnin' on down here. But sura as at your altar I exchanged the marriage vow, As sure as from your sanctity all streams of mercy flow, As sure, achor alanna, though I sadly leave you now, I'm back within your bosom whin the praties grow. They've paid me to forsake you, an' I pawned my soul for bread, An' promised for their pottage that from you and yours I'd part; But while beneath their new-built spire I bow my sinful head, "Tis your ould stones, alanna, that will have my aohin' heart. Between the hymns they're singin' I will praise your Sacred Host, An' whisper Holy Marys whin their organ's in full flow; An' whin they ban the Romish Church, I'll beg the Holy Ghost To hurry on the saysonwhin the praties grow. Oh, )f inside you, darlin', some obligin' ' .neighbours kneel, Tell one of God's bright angels to go whisper in.their ear That there's a poor soul waitin' that can't inake its own appeal, But if it could, would ask Him to 6end down a fruitful year. Good-bye, thin, for a little while, the shelter of my heart— Good-bye the glory of my eyes—but let the faithful know That though I say good-bye, a vie, an' from your gate depart, 'Tis but, asthore alanna, till the praties grow.
