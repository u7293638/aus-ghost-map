As Things Are Seen and Heard. THROUGH ONE PAIR OF EYES AND EARS. Parliamentary Peculiarities. The Benefits of Tick. THE PROVERBS OF SOLOMON. Cut Both Ways. \- — - — — — — LEGAL WIT. The Harbor Question. —o— (By Mrs Lance Rawson.) No. II. I have been studying the Parliamentary debater, as reported in Hansard, and I find my mind improved and considerably broadened thereby. It is a strange thing, but somehow or other I used not to have much opinion of the collective wisdom of the country ; it always seemed to me that it was not a man's brains that got him there, so much as it was his adaptability ; the pliability and elasticity of his prin- ciples. But now I find I am all wrong as, judging by certain portions of the de- bates I have read, some of the members were born without principles, and appar- ently they are the very people who have got on best. Like the dogs born without tails, the loss does not prevent progress ; it only induces a tendency to run in a curve, or a circle— never in a straight line. The opening of Parliament always reminds me of a game played by children, and called "Old Diggly Bones." The only difference is, that where his Excellency sends a message to Mr Speaker and hon. members in the Council Chambers (pre- tending all the time he doesn't know they are sitting there all ready in their war paint, waiting to be sent for), "Old Diggly Bones" just steps in of his own accord. I was once present at the opening of the N.S.W. Parliament— when I was a good deal bigger wig than I am now, so far as appearances go — for I went with the Vice-regal or working end of the pageant, and so lost was I in the contemplation of my own consequence, that the only thing I was able to remember next day was that the coachman and footman who drove me wore silk stockings. It seems at first sight a small matter to re- member, but if he thinks hard for five minutes or so the intelligent reader will see that after all the silk stockings worn by the coachman were really a very impor- tant item in the show. It would have created a scandal had he gone without them ! * * * * After all, I am not sure that we'd be any the better without our collective wisdom. It may be a comedy or it may be a farce ; but whatever it is, it certainly keeps a few of our Tom Noddys amused, and experience has proved to me and my sister women that so long as a man is amused he is always safe, if not quite harmless. One thing that occurred to me during the pe-- rusal of Hansard was that the Premier and the Colonial Secretary must be nearly allied to the feminine persuasion, for the one always does as he likes, according to Mr Dunsford, and the other does as nobody likes, judging by the number of hon members who found fault with him. Another statement of Mr Duns- ford's suggests a lot of things to my fertile imagination. Apropos of ticks for instance— that they have been known to tackle man —I rise to suggest that a sum be placed on the next Estimates for the purpose of erecting dips for the human biped. There are, as somebody has said, more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosphy, and the tick- infected human is one of them. * * * * I have often wondered at the inferior quality of the married men, but supposed myself singular in noticing it. I really had a sort of diffidence in drawing atten- tion to the fact that there is a sort of finality — a I-know-all-I'll-now-die aspect — about the married man. But now I find from Mr Jackson's speech the **???*** man is acknowledged to be the flower of the race. Mercy ! When does deterioration set in ? Is it soon after marriage, or not till the hurricane years? Emanuel Kink says— Single men are the flavor of tama- rinds with curry; they are of the pliability of soft butter, and the steadfastness of the west wind, which just sums them up plea- santly, and hurts nobody's feelings. * * * * When and where did Solomon say — "There is a time for everything ?" I ask for information. I used to be well-nigh letter-perfect in the proverbs of the wisest man who ever lived— but I do not remember the Colonial Secretary's extremely trite quotation. Solomon said a lot of things that apply very aptly at all times and sea- sons and especially to the collective wis- dom, but I always do think it is braver to throw hunks of rock at your enemies than the proverbs of Solomon— they may hurt more at the time, but they don't sit on one's intelligence, and make one want to be always finding out if Solomon really did say it. How would anyone— the Colonial Secretary for instance — feel, if some one was to hurl a few of the follow- ing at him:— "See'st thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of him." Or, "Though thou shouldest lay a fool in a mortar among wheat, with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him." Yes; the man or woman who takes to hurling the proverbs of Solomon about should be run in for mental assault and battery, and severely fined. We are told that Solomon was a wise man, but I take no account of a man who required 300 and odd wives and a mouthful of every vice under the sun to perfect his wisdom. One of the most courteous acts of Solomon was speaking of wisdom always as feminine. I guess he learnt something from his 300 and odd wives. My youthful intelligence used to be greatly puzzled as to why Solomon was called the wisest of men. I could never reconcile his marrying 300 wives with either wisdom or morality ; there appeared to me a great waste of energy somewhere, and far too large a capacity for trivial flirtation np to a great age. And why Henry the Eighth, who only had six wives, was con- sidered a very bad, bold lot, and Solomon, who annexed over 300, was considered a model of wisdom, was just one of those items of history I never could fathom. * * * * This is a serious paragraph, and in all reverence and seriousness I ask what are we coming to ? According to a little paper called ''The Seen and the Unseen," published in the cause of occultism and spiritualism in Brisbane, Jesus of Nazareth has been speaking through the lips of Mrs Ednott Burbank in trance, on the subject of prayer. I don't exactly know what I can call myself—probably an agnostic ; but whatever I am, or my reli- gious convictions are, I confess to a feeling of contempt for people who, with all the dead and gone wise men to chose from, must take the one for whom millions of the human race have a profound love and reverence to bolster up their claim to notoriety. It is not even for the purpose of prophesy that the Divine Reformer is used, apparently, but merely to define the meaning of " Prayer, and it is given in very much the same words as used by one of the Fathers of the Roman Catholic faith in a sermon on Prayer. Like many others who dabble in this, thay, and the other, I, too, have dipped into spiritualism to some extent, and I would consider myself wanting in common sense were I to assert that there is nothing in the science. At the same time it is of all the sciences the one of which can be truly said — A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Mysterical and emotional women are extremely apt to imagine themselves inspired ; there is no pretence about the matter, they really and truly do believe themselves dominated. But this is the first time one has flown quite to the realms of Paradise for a control. In the same issue of the paper there is under the head- ing of "Another Notable Spiritual Mani- festation" an account of a somewhat eccen- tric spirit — one Captain Kidd — who ap- pears to have indulged in a few manly swear words now and then ; but as the incident mentioned happened in Cleveland, U.S.A., in 1857, notwith- standing what is termed ample verification —the reader's thumbs turn up in- stinctively. Then there is the young French girl who declares that she is in- spired by the Angel Gabriel. Even so, to what does it all lead ? According to this young lady the Angel Gabriel is supposed to have told her that a war will be the re- sult of the Egyptian complications. France is to be chastised and undergo ter- rible misfortunes. England, too, is to be cruelly struck ; her population deci- mated, her pride humbled, and her riches destroyed. Now, if he had just mentioned a word or two re our Wharfage and Harbor Board difficulty what a comfort it would have been. * * * * There is an old saying that "Small things amuse small minds," and somehow I could not help applying it while reading over the evidence in the Mount Morgan case last Tuesday evening. It stated there was laughter — loud laughter — " laughter in which his Honor and the opposing counsel heartily joined— &c.;, &c.;"— but I couldn't see even the ghost of a joke to give rise to so much learned laughter. Am I losing my sense of the ridiculous— the keenest sense I possess, or used to possess ? I trust not ; at the same time there must be something radically wrong when I cannot see the joke that made a judge laugh. Apropos of all the sparkling wit and fanny business — is it also charged for in the bill of costs, I wonder ? Poor, unfortunate scribblers are told to con- dense, condense; it might not be a bad idea to make the court bailiff shout the same thing whenever the learned gentle- men were getting off the track, as it were. * * * * The wharfage question grows in health, strength and vitality, and if it is not soon settled there won't be many aldermen, boardsmen, and citizens who will play in each other's back yards for the next decade or so. There really ought to be some way or other of settling these questions with less trouble than they cause now. How would a sailing race do ? two boats to start, one called "Wharfage" the other "Harbor Board," and the one that won, let his terms be accepted whether it be £25,000 or £100,000 for compensation or without compensation. To return to Hansard for a moment, I notice that Mr M'Donnel, the member for Fortitude Valley, spoke very strongly on the subject of sweating, as it is carried on in Brisbane. But Brisbane is not the only city where it exists. We do our share of abuse, even in this place. A few days ago I was talking to one of the most battered wrecks of humanity it has been my lot to meet. The thread of sympathy that drew us within the one circle was, I may say, a turkey. " What do yon do for a living as a rule ? " I asked. " I make shirts for a woman as gets the work from the shops." '' And what does she give you ? " I enquired. "Four shillings a day **????**was the reply. So much for the dignity of labor, say I— the supreme privilege of living, of cumber- ing this sweet, bright world, of being allowed to draw a small share of the air an all-wise providence has provided— Fourpence for making a shirt — Band and gusset and seam, Till over the buttons she falls asleep, And sews them on in a dream.
