Selected Poetry THE SILENT ONES. Their spirits pass, and leave no trace be- hind, But sink to silence, like the whisp'ring wind That gently rustles thro' the leafy boughs, Then dies away in faintly-murmur'd soughs. Their vacant places soon again are filled ; Forgotten the loved tones, that once bo thrilled Our charmed ears — and now another's voice Can bid our souls be sorrowful or rejoice. Oh, it is sad, and doubly sad, to think How ready we drop the life-long link Of heart to heart ! That leveller, the tomb, Makes no distinction in its common doom. Death plucks them from us, and with scowling brow Will no invasion of his rights allow. We leave them to the silence — glad to turn Where new affections and ambitions burn, And, if their wailing ghosts entreat us, spurn Their haunting memories — put them away, As hideous blots upon the face of day, Like raven's croak, or moping owlet's scream, Or horrid shrieking, heard in ghastly dream. Sweet uncomplaining Spirits ! Silent ones ! Sleep peacefully, while Time's swift cur- rent runs, Making you even with men's thoughtless sons ! Anon their places miss them — and they fall Into the Silent Gulf : Oblivion's pall Covers their virtues — and their faults as well, And soon not-ev'n stone their names shall tell But yet 'tis Heaven's mercy to us all That Silence buries Sorrow with the dead, Or there would be no limit to the tear- drops shed.
