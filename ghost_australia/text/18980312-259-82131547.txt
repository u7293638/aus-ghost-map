A TAMWORTH OHOST. The Tamworth " Obaarvor" e&ya; that the settlers at Moot Greek are now greatly agitated and exercised over the appearanoe periodically of a phantom, or rather a couple of phantoms, which take the form ot a lady olad in white and leading by the hand a child, The apparition is on view late at night in a sully alongeide the camp and h&o; been seen off and on tor fonr or five months past, bat those who saw it believed it was only a female returning unprotected from the danoing hall. Last Saturday night it was arranged that nearly the whole of the camp should assemble to try to fathom the mystery ot the White Woman and her child. One pe culiar thing about the phenomenon is (hat it is not visible to everybody. Up to the present nine persons have viewed it, and although others have been in their company and the spot where the spook was located pointed out, they were still unable to gee it. However, those who are able to gace on the spectre, or what ever it is, are positive it is a ghost and nothing but s ghost, and are evidently sincere in suoh belief. The locality presided over by her lady ship has been excavated in parts by some of the waterworks hands, but their credulity has not et been rewarded by the disoovety of any leaohed bones or decomposing bodies. Further developments will be awaited with interest. Von are going where you used to go.â€”To 1\. De Coni&y;'i Great 8&le.;
