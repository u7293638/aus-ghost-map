Tho Cooktoion Herald says:—A gentleman lately returned -from the Palmer reports having, on his .way down, seen great numbers of dead. Chinamen lying uribnried. One China man was lying dead in the water at the first crossing of tho where * the : horses have to be watered-, a most dis-. gut-ting mass of decaying humanity. One peculiarly revolting thing, is that the Chinese seem to have an actual ab horrence of touching, or of being scon near their dead countrymen. An nm'ns ingiustance of this trait was observed by our informant daring his journey. A. dead Clunky was lying close to ? th_ track ;? a. Chinaman was waddling along with his. baskets and bamboo polo, at the regulation jog-trot, bnt -catching ?sight tif his : dead conntrymaii, John turned off at a tangent, and --hooked r-itlVsp—tho hill at the rate of Un knots an hour, baskets and all. Arrived at th?*'tog_ of the hill, John made a wide' detonrj apparently afraid that the ghost of his '.countryman might stick him up for bitrJaTiftes.

First, that there is no yo-lh of tlt_L name in the. district that we nro awaro of; secandly, that our hospital is at present closed; and patients have not been "received for some month-, pist, .md thirdly, that no such accident happened at. the pound, or in the district to our knowledge. Beyond these Irtft'nq errors, we have no doubt but that tin-paragraph ia correct enough ; but we could not atlow our neighbour thus to indirectly accuse us of neglecting to supply our readers with such an interesting local item wit-t -out venturing some'mild expostulation." This, is-very -cruel ; and we recommend the Chronicle to allow tlie" Record to mauago its own casualties-for the future. -r-JScXo.. i i , \- Tho Buffalo Courier, XT. S. says :_— " A. day' or two 'since a clerk in one of the telegraph ofifces in to am, being the last to leave for his dinner, found the door locked, a* is usual; bnt, as is not usual, discovered thathe had left his key in another coat-pocket two or three < at his hotel. < The windows """wero two .stories up, and he did not exactly 'see'- the' point of ait exit that .way. And every minatc-his dinner was growing cold, and his i temper corres pondingly i hot. i Ho rattled the door, tried to pick tho lock with a shingle nail, and repeated softly to himself choice extracts .from profane history; but there he stayed, and) relief seemed ap pallingly remote. He; telegraphed to St. Thomas, Can., had it repeated to Detroit, whence it was returned, accord to accompanying instructions, t0..-tho- Atlautic and Pacific office lure in Main street—the result of which J wns to send a boy up to his room after his key, mid bring it to his office to release him. It is reported by the, Gottrier, that on Snuday morning- a firebrokj out on the premises of Mr, Pethric, situated ou Mount Pleasant. It was found that the building adjacent to .the 1 dwelling-house, comprising a kitchen, and dining-room;, and lH!il-rnom(the latter fortunately un occupied o_ this particular night) were so far under ? the power of the flames, that nothing could be saved. Every thing the building contained was com pletely destroyed, and- all could be done by the few persons present'was to use their every exertion to prevent the spreading of the fire to tlie neighbour ing house-. Fortunately, tho- wind, which was pretty strong at the time, was blowing away from the adjacent building of Mr. Crego, or the probability is that it would have been enveloped in -flames before the occupants were arousal or the fire discovered. The; loss sus tained by the i fire is estimated at over £250. The bnilding was uninsured.

It is rare, how ever, that snch a case a> the following comes under notice——perhaps it is also as well. Wo (Echo) understand that, at tl]c-- Criminal Sessions at'lllawana last Friday, a most curious case of the unceftairiity of the law was exemplified before "his-Honor District Court Judge M'Farland. It appears that a boy 15 years, of age, was charged with having tolen a box containing about- twelve shillings. - The constable who arrested gave in as evidence that the-boy, on be ing questioned, had admitted having stolen the box. The case -proceeded— Mr. Richards (solicitor for the defend ant), however, contending that the con fession might have been made by the boy, when.in a state of fear at the cxta stable asking him suddenly about the robbery. His 'Honor recalled the con stable, and examined Jiim as to what he said to the boy .before he made the con fession of having stolen the money—but "nothing : came of it. Mr. Richards " Now, Wicks, are you.not in the habit —of is it not a favourite expression of yours, " It.is better for you .to tell the truth.':* Tlie constable admitted that it was," and thathe had further made nsc of it Id tho boy. His Honor at oucc said that this expression of the constable was an inducement or a threat, especi ally to a boy only 15. years of age ; and as it was quite.plain in law that any ad mission, made'by the prisoner through any inducement or a threat could not be properly received in' evidence, h? would on his owu responsibility direct tho jury to acquit the prisoner. On be ing asked what was to be done with the money, 6s 5d., found on the boy when h_""wasr arrested, his Honor said," Give it to the. boy." We mayjwcll say that the law is like the fickle dame Fortune.
