BIBLE CHRISTIAN DISTRICT MEETING. FIFTH DAY.—MONDAY, MARCH 4. At 5.30 p.m. there was a well-attended tea, succeeded by & public meeting. Mr. W. Taylor, the representative of Auburn Circuit Presided. The Rev. J. Ashton, the Chairman of the District, read the report in a hamarons d,A forcible t** I****1 **** ltev. J. Foster then said the subject auogned him was ''The Holy Ghost.™ How should he treat a theme so vast? He dwelt on the personality, being, and func tions of the Spirit, combating what he re garded a* the anti-Ohristian notion that He was only an attribute or title of Deity, and traced the work of the Spirit in the varioai aspects of human redemption. The Rev. O. Lake spoke on "The Holy Oatholio Church." Be trusted that portions of tile grand old creed ware not held simply as theologic formulas, tat as living realities. Holiness was the true doc trine of a standing oi.ralli?g Church. In*thi* Luthennism. Luther wa* content with justifi oation aa his standard; but Wesley improved on that watchword. Hi* programme was to "spread Seriptaral *">iip?« through ft*** land." The consftqnannfi was that while Lutheranism had hist mush of its vitality, Methodism nourished. Hie feared that one reason why so little visible success now crowned, the efforts of Christ* Church was that men were not en couraged aa formerly to bear testimony that "the blood of Jesus Christ, God* Bon, oleanseth from all am." This holiness constituted (he Church, the pillar aad ground of the truth. It were to be doubted if even God* truth could ■tend in such a world as our* without holiness. The early triumph* of the Church were due to this —that the primitive Christians were holy; hence they were forceful and attractive. They wen never neutral. Sometimes their work* were revolutionary ; sometimes pacificatory, but alway influential. Their hnHna.^ was their force, and they were powerful in proportion as they were holy. There were other powers; number* for instance; but sometimes these were a source of weakness instead of strength. Let them remember what the Lord had said toQideon, "These men are 'too many' for me," and not trust in numbers. There were also wealth and social influence. Voltaire said once to Frederick of Prussia, " I am glad the prince* and philosopheu of the time axe believing my teachings; I don't care who get* the tent nuker "?^ fishermen." But Voltaire forget history and misread human .nature when he said that God's word declared ''not many mighty, not many noble are called." The speaker did not believe in the wealthy Church, or the learned, the sociaUy high, nor the numerically strong, but in tile Holy Church. It was catholic or universal as com prehending *-^ wipp, 2, A* *wiy"pif*i|OT?^jf>g all time. 3. As comprehending all truth. After enlarging on these points he concluded by saying, "It all depends how we believe these facts. If we hold them, not as the mummy fi«.lii^ in its withered h">^ the seed corn which might have blessed the ages, but as living realities, we shall have union, earnest prayer, abundant confidence in the Church's high destiny. We believe in the glorious future. There are no poets aad prophets of despair. There i* light on the face of all that look towards the future, and this is especially the east with the seer* of the Holy Cathono Church. Rev. J. Trewin in a few sen tence* referred to " Communion of Saint?," but expressed regret that he had not more tin? to with the topio fully. Certain tiling* were essentially neoessiry to secure com munion. 1, Love in the heart. 2. Confidence in one another. 3. Confidence in Christ, the centre of hope and joy. We had need of these things. Even the apostles felt the deep craving for human sympathy; even Christ longed and prayed for it mightily. Jesus jKomued to hallow it, and there were many bright Scrip ture examples of its blessed effects. This communion was to be promoted by various means, and when realised it presented the most perfect foreshadowing of Heaven that could be seen on earth. The Bey. T. Allen said it seemed that his subject—*' The life Everlasting"—was too deep, sacred, important to be entered upon at that late hour. One must live through a whole eternity to be able to talk fully and profitably about everlasting life. There was an instinctive craving in every human breast for the everlasting. This was more than endless existence. Fallen angels and lost souls had that. It was independent of externals entirely—began and continued in lightness of heirt He could not enter upon all the aspects of the subject, as it was so vast. The choir sang very creditably, and the pro ceedings closed with the benediction.
