At the Albert street Wesleyan Church yes terday morning the Rev W. Clarke, president of tho conference, preached to a fairly large congregation on the text, " Not by might, nor hy powei, but by Mv spirit, saith tho Lord of Hosts." Zechanah iv 0 The preacher com bated the idea held by some persons that all that was, necessary to bring about the millennium wa3 perfect circumstances, mid argued that perfect circumstances would not pioduco perfect character, as was evidenced bj the present advanced state of education and liberty Ho contended that it was impossible to make men moral by laws The fact was that when evil existed m tho heart it must bo eradicated No laws that were mado would make a community moral Thero was only ono pov cr that would-that it thi power of the Holy Ghost Some persons, ho said wantod new methods, new gospels butas these new fangled notions did not reach the heart, ho held that they would nover regenerate jociotv Nothing but the old Gospel of tho Loid Jesus Christ could do it The preacher next Combated the notion held by many persons that civilisation was going to do everything. Ho confessed tlyit civilisation gave us the idea of a certain conquest, or power, over something lovvor, and ho hod nothing to say against civilisation but he pointed out how, m the present civilisation, porsons became shaves to luxurious habits Civilisation, ho saul was very well, but it would never regenerate a man's heart It merely touched the surface Learned men existed before the timo of Christ, and jet the world was sinking dee per and eleepti until Christ came. Since Ho carne the world has been rising Tako the world us n whole, it was becoming better and bettei not by might, nor by power, but by the influence of the noly Ghost, through tho instrumentality of that old Gospel In tho evening tho Rev J.
