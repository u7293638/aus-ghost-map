PARISIAN ECHOES. PARIS, 16th March. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) France is at last to have a Colonial Minister with a seat in the Ca[?]net It was full time to take some definite decision on the subject One day the colonies were under the Foreign Miuistei, another under the Admiralty, next handed over to the military authorities, and occasional!) con centiated between the hinds of an under Secretary. An addition of 23,000 francs h vs been given to the latter functionaly, md he has b*en told to rise up a full fledged Colo uial Minister But it seems the bcith has no special pilace, no gorgeously furnished rooms, m a word, nothing to and izzlo in the way of glate and gilding the young men fioin the country Some Ministers, forget ting that they are at best only a higher ordci of clerks, believe it to be pirt of their d'g mty, of their 01 n imental duty, nuly to come to their office, unless allowed extras to keep a ciirnge For such, v Ministry is a Dutch cheese not a working line Eveiy colony Fiance owns is worked on a loss Ihere are so many issues in the sides of the mothei countiy Fieuch men av old their colonies, aud seem to rely on German and English representatives to look after any mercantile interests they may hive in foieign lands Further, they have no liberality in their enterprises, fear to in dulge in expense to reap remuneration. The foreign tiade of other countries pro grosses by leaps and bounds; that of France dots not even capriole Asa pissing tribute to the pleasures of memory, the city did npt even mike an attempt at a ghost of a carnaval on Shrove iue-day Folly has depirteu, but wisdom has not succeeded Mirth has been sup piloted by resignation Of late the holiday was sicred to puffing vans and slop out titters, but tins plan of impioviug the occasion has declined It is worthy of re mark that v tiadesman rarely patronises furniture van procession a second time to announce his wares and his boist fill independence, that ho has no con nection with any other house, the one over the way not excepted It is not the less an excellent occasion to tike stock of what business is most run after fur the moment 'iested by this standard, cheap tailoring is certainly in the a c c J udviit, and next cafe concerts with divas and tenon; or beei saloons with impromptu waiblers, oi aitiates that biro out their lungs against free drinks for the night As for tin juvenile masked b ills, they kept up to the annual level of tbeir statistics; the ucitiiei was very trying m the streets for the Bambini to take their fiist lessons in vanity as the thinly clad representatives of the privileged oulcrs of bye gone days A tiny duebexs, powdered and munched with a sugar stick in one hind aud a red cotton mouchoir in iking electric journeys to a little Lapland colored nose, in the other, is a spectacle that well deserves the passers’ by ej iculation —" pauu e petite l ' If there vveie children’s burnl clubs in France tins Lenten trot over the flags in fancy costume would soon qualify juveniles for then rights There was a good deal of miscellaneous evidence tint among all the tight rope politicians, Bauluuger was by fir ; the most admired In 1833 the binkruptcy law was voted, and that made no distinction between a dis honest and in unfortun ite bankrupt Both were equally punished by the unique law, social death, and the estate was sold to piy the oyster shells to the creditors When the honest li ider got into the shut lows he struggled on and on, hoping to compel foituue to return and smile As there was no difference, no extern! ating cucumstauces admitted, he lived on till the lust sou of his estate was ex pended When the cieditors were called to gether they found there was nothing for them, aud whcie thcie is nothing the king loses his nights The roguish dealer felt quite at home iu Ins bieik down Public opinion has long since called for a distmc tion between debtors The amended law has just come into operation A tradei, when m a tight place, can withm 13 diys demand from the local court a liquid itor. This functionary steps in, works the bust ness, and if he finds there is no hope he winds it up, saves something for the crcdi tors, and protects the debtor from being dis honored as abauktupt It is to benefit by this stitch in tune tliat the Panama Can il Company is in the courts Granted, but where is the cash to come from to complete the canal. Tins is the only point M lie Lesaeps does nut explain. Fine words will not butter the parsnips, nor vapid appeals to glory replace dividend*. The Government formally declines to in any way come to the rescue of M. de Lessepa’ collapsed enter prise. A poor man residing at Nogent, on coining home to Ins dinner noticed only one dish on the table. On raising the cover he found underneath a letter from his wife, stating that, suffering from an mcurablc malady, she decided to destroy herself, and pieferred to do so in Pans, where she was unknown The husband, accompanied by’ a friend, at once set out foi Pans. Tiro days they searched ’for the fugitive in vain. While waiting at a ’bus office ueai one of the bridges they noticed a crowd on the bauk of the liver Ihey joined it, and assisted at the specticle of fishing up a corpse—that of Ins ow n vv ife. A commissary of police m the Fauhouig Montmartre, is proverbial for picking up abandoned children A few evenings ago, a smait ring was heard at Ins door, the servant, on opening, admitted a beautiful olnld, ,u gnl, dies-ed most luxuriously in silk, velvet, furs, and covered with vtluable family jewels The little fairy could not tell more than that her name w is “ Alice ; ” she handed in a letter, anonymous; the mother bad to abaudou her child, and bequeathed it to the tender hearted official Forty appheitious have been received to adopted the little stranger. M Zola has turned engine driver, in oidcr to be able to depict the life of drivers, stokers, pokers, and pointsmen The terrible Bismarck is very lucky again; it looks, since be has become a doctor of divinity, that his piayeis are being heard, He secs two of his bear ache giving tormen tors now as low as fallen Lucifers—Paul Deroulede, the symbol of ebulition patriotism, and Deputy Antoine, member for Metz, md representative m the Gel man Parliament of the restoration of Alsaco to France Evi Gently both of these “leaven men” believe the revenge gamo to be all up, since the Emperor V\ illlam has dined with the French Ambassador. The peace of Europe appears to be more secured than frightened at the resolution of England to bnug her navy up at one fell swoop to the necessities of her imperial interests, and the fashion of the age At first, tne step of adding 70 extra bittla liners to an already robust navy took away the breath; on reflection, it was seen that she was only doing on her element what Continental powers vveie practising on their own. Blue jackets versus soldiers. This determination of England to hoist a broom at the mast head of her cruisi rs, and sweep the ocean highways and byways, was not the evuse of the sudden death of the French Munster of Marine, Admiral Jaures. He really died of apoplexy, though this ailment hat been brought into disrepute since the demise of Archduke Rudolph, and the mis manager of the Comptoir d’Escompte, M. Denfert Since their calamities, there are no more desolate looking buildings tban the offices of the Panama Canal Company and the Comp loir d’Escompte By the decision of the Court of Appeal, the dnectors of the Pkiiama Company cannot be adjudicated bankrupts, so their personal fortunes are beyond the reach of victimised shareholders But if the directors have misrepresented the financial status of the society, in order to soap new loans that will be a serious offence. It will be for the assignee to make this point clear. .Squaring the circle, or scouring a stable Government for France, are merely child’s play in compansou with bis task, to com plete the canal without money, or to sell it, vv lieu no purchases can be found. And poor M. de Lesseps, where is he? The journals never mention him; in society his name is never heatd. By the resignation of Comte Fillet-Will, governor of the Bank of France, the bust ness world has again become confused, and the position of the Comptoir d’ Escompte become worse. The latter establ aliment, once so animated, may bo said to, relatively, have now but a few depositors The scare, not a bogus one, sent the clieuts to draw out their hard money, and lodge it with banks that never specu late, They are the shareholders of the company that are uow in question. The ■haras have fallen as low as 300 francs, having been at 1050 francs. It is not yet cleared up to what extent the liability of the Camptoir is involved to back the copper ring societies to take the output of the cor nered mines up to 1891 at an artificial con tracted piice. In order to prevent the Comptoir d’Escompte fiom closing its doors in the fase of depositors, the council of the Bank of Franco accepted an arrangement to lend 100 million franca in cash against, among other security, SO million francs of scrip held hy the Comptoir M Fillet Will voted against the loan, as the SO million francs secntity was not vvoith half that sum To avoid ultimate responsibility, he has resigned A. legal question his been raised If the Comptoir cannot pull through cm the copper mines hold the French Government responsible, as it nominated the general manager of the Comptoir’ One ring less in the world is a blessing, not a cala mity The musical world has to record tho birth of anew star—\ldlle Ernies, at the N itional Opera, in the role of Juliette, with the in comparable Jean de Rt«zk£, as Romeo This lady ism hei twenty first yeai, she was born in Shanghvi, wheie her fuller, ißoston man, filled a post in the American Consulate Her i eal music il te ich°r was her own mother, although Mdlle c ime to Fins, to be finished in hi r singing and m her acting It wis literally her first appealance on my stigc She is a tall, slender, handsome young lady, charming in a word The spectitois had hardly heard hei fir»t notes, than they r ip'urously appl mded hei, mid st imped her as a success Her loioe is pure, bnlh mt, and stiong, she sing-, without effort, full of artistic t iste and scientific iceuracy But she rolled more on nature th in either science or art She was accomplished in the val*e air, inimitible in the bilcony scene, md per fection in the burial closing act The few spots on the sun will disappear after a few repiesentatiom The acting of Miss Ernies wis equally in keeping with her success as a singer She displayed an instinctive in telligence, a -surety, and simplicity that others do not acquire in a lifetime In her mute play, while listening to the Friar how to use the fatal cup she was superb She is the ideal Juliette tint Shakespeire hid in his mind’s eye Many preferred the Juliette of Miss Eames to th it of Fatti’s At the Exhibition the Ficnch colonies will be located on the esplinade of tin Inv ilidev, they will be in clurge of 300 nitues, selected fr mi the respective colonies Li 1546 there were 7,463,000 houses in France; in ISS6 there were 7,706,000. with an average of neailv file persons pei house.
