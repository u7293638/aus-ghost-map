Esq. tbe Retnrniue OSopt, initiated she procc-edin^s 5b tie customary formal manner by {he reading of 1 he writ for lie ele-ctaon, and caQcd on BIT one present to propose * candidaie. Mr W. Simpson, J.P- Eagiehawk, came forward bdd staled it gave him much pleasure to propose Mr .tnffivau as their, nrprt^atative in the. Assembly (Cbt-ert). He did so for "varitras reasons ; one of which -was that dcrin£ Mr^nlHnn's past career in Parliament be bad served tbeiB, " he beHeved, as truly asd aj boneSlyas any member there. (Cbeers). la tie wr position which Mr Sullivan would occupv, if be was returned, he would be better able to render greater-benefits" to his "constituents than he could -heretofore. He eologispd'Mr Salliraa's candor,and "and israjghtforwardness in always boldly ivowftljjhis political seEliirexits, and expressed his belief that he voold act jrilh .thai consistency and lionesty .which heretofore. had = cfetinguishe-d him. i After "fhrther (vnipliraentieg lie candidate, he again proposed him in the usual maimer. , Liester {Eaglehawk Municipal Council), with equal pleasure, .seconded Mr Sullivan's nomination,; inasmuch as Ift -Ktd known Mr Sullrvair for a long* time and had never been deceived in him. (Cheers.) Time had proved him to be one of The most liberal members that had erer entered the House. .When hi looked back and Mr Sullivan's worth as a private citizen, and as a public man, he found that the confidence the people placed in him had not been misplaced. /Applause). He felt great pride in looking back at his recent condnct in Parliament, where be had not onlr advocated liberal principles, but where he had tickled the ribs of O'Sbanassr and his mob. (Laughter). He felt certain that, if returned, Mr Sullivan would adhere strictly to the liberal promises he had made. (Cheers). He had no doubt hut he would be returned without opposi tion-and be almost wished there had been, in order to show what little chance anyone would hare had against him. For the sake of showing their strength be wished there had, and as far as expenses were concerned, it would hare been an ererlasting shame if Jlr Sullivzn had been put to any expense in the contest. (Applause.) The Beturaing Officer, having requested the nomination of any other candidate, and being answered br cries in the negative, and with "rre want no other man," declared Mr Sullivan duly elected in the usual manner, an announcement which was re ceived with enthusiastic and Ion; continued cheer ing, prolonged for some moments after Mr Sulliran came forward to address the meeting. Mr Sullivan said it was a peculiarly gratify ing thing to a man who had been the representative of a {constituency to know that he had maintained the good opinions of his friends during that period; but it became doubly gratifying, and gave him a far greater pleasure, when he found that his conduct in Parliament bad converted antagonism into support and friendship, as had been the case, according to the admission of Mr Simpson. (Applause). In coming before a con stituency which he had represented, he held it to be the duty of that representative to be in a position to give an account not only of general past conduct, but to render an account ol every vote he had given in that capacitf; and although his constituents had been so generous as not to ask a question relative to those votes, he did not, on the other hand, feel him self released from the obligation. He held it to be the duty of every representative who was entrusted with a" vote, and when called on to give it, to look upon it not as belonging to himself, to be sold or bartered away for his own personal advantage, bat as held in trust for his constituents. Every honest representative should feel that when he was called on to vote, he should vote for the interests of the people be represented ; that he should feel that his vote was not like a mere chattel property-a some thing he could dp with as he liked, "but that he should use for the interests of the community, and in accordance with their wishes. He was sorry to sav that there were men elected to Parliament who en tertained very different feelings ; men who vrere without principle ; men who had acted as traitors to their constituencies. With regard to himself, he was perfectly willing to give an acceunt of every vote he had* given for the last two years in the House ; to account for every word he had stated there ; indeed it was his wish to bring them under reriew and the closest criticism. (Applause.) When he first came before them lie made no distinct pledges as to what his particular conduct in Parlia ment would be, if returned ; but having enunciated certain political views, and that he would be guided by a certain course of conduct in Parliament, he be iieved he would be able to .prove he had never de parted from it, by the fact that his past conduct had been so favorably acknowledged by the intelligent community ' he represented. "(Cheers.) In order that his remarks might be more explanatory, instead of beginning at the beginning, he would begin at the end, as by that means the events he referred to would he fresher in their recollection. He also did to more for the reason because the only act in his whole political life-the only thing which, in the duration of two years, his worst foes could endeavor to make a handle of-and there were men in that House not very honest in making charges-was just that one act of his, recently, in regard to the Electoral Hill. Well, what was the position of affairs in regard to the bill ? In order to make it more clear to them, ije would briefly state the charge which bad been made against him-that he had consented to the passing of a measure when in office which he had objected to rrlien out of office, or that as a Minister of the Crown he had advised the Governor's sanctioning a bill which he disagreed with, and which he had opposed in Parliament,and for the sake of keeping office, that he bad sacrificed his political principles. J«*ow, it was well known, not only to every member of Parliament but to every reading and thinking man, that when the bill in question was before the House he had opposed it tooth and nail-that he had fought it clause by clause, where it affected the liberties of the people -that night after night, and often singly, he had fought for and obtained at last, a bill less restricted and more modified than it was intended by its pro jectors. (Cheers.) Well, having fought the mea sure as veil as he could, he might state then, that it became law by the action of both Houses of Parlia ment, and by being certified to by the law officers of the Crown. The bill was in that stage when he, with others, was called on to take office. Now, ac cording to all Parliamentary usage and to all con stitutional practice as laid down in England, it would have been contrary to all precedent for any Ministry to step in then and advise the Crown to withhold its sanction to the bill, and if they had been the means of introducing such a dangerous and in consistent precedent, the very men who accused him of want of principle would have been the first to accuse him if he . had acted differ ently, (cheers), and yet that was -what thev had brought forward against hira. After referring to the unconstitutional method, by the late Attor ney-General and the Minister of Justice, in advising the Governor to withhold his sanction to Torrens' Bill for facilitating the transfer of real property. he continued-Lookin", , therefore, at the preservation intact of the privileges of tlie constitution under which they lived, and to act in accordance with the parliamentary usages in England, and, looking at the fact that »n a youn" country like this, the customs of the British Parlia" [ ment should in a great measure be adhered to, he could not see that it woild have been safe to have i acted otherwise than pass the bill. (Cheers.) And | to look at the case from another point of view, let them consider that if even it had been constitu l tional and prscedented to have advised the Gover nor to have withheld his sanction, what would have been the consequences ? In all probability the Min istry, when they went back to Parliament, would have met with an adverse raajorityj and the very first* movement that would bo made against them, would . be « rote of ofcMiftferc?, so<5 s5j- Hcuv would v aire ts^ :irf-tske the- :oW Ministry they put-<.L" : j OTj C3 & -vliKT V.aiu3, if the Gctrcor fniisM ('. i ict infaCMTiaBffi "with tbf >i3Tiw of hit s wfc';ch ^ is »hst 'he lik<-ly have done-£h^y | to r^%2Ad ibt Hou^eand tfa^onntry , wpold vb^' ia«'sniiUr "^pcsli^D. -nti tbf O sli3irii.*y ^TinislrT would have agstin to bf for. AH ih>l* tho*c\l the illogical reasoning on that fu^f-1 by Kmc- of tb«e ijberal-s a« the? _<^M..them&tlTCt.; \- Why tirtBe m*atRSHSt appear to know that, if even be {Mr SnIKran) had objected to aaviring the Gover nor to rrfuse his sanction 01 th^bi^ltitl|5.5iypnt]r-o£ -frry-trarof^e^c^n^roeSVr^ of the Cabinet could have carried it- . They were the men who appeared to hare jlkIsL to bring- bwk-inlo u%eltor*ef* n»en ther fcaui assisted to o«t,ar.d whose meirures ihey" had cODdearned. He then referred to "the actidn o5 some of the present Opposition when: Ufe":Hoase met merely for the purpose of announcing the ap ppSntroen* of the Ministry, and in doing io he stig matised their -action sa" not onlv_.jrregtilar,_btjt e^wardK ; he said coVrirfflyv 'because it. was so, to attack ail absent member of the Howe, and irregular bctanw it was -unprecedented, according to tbV cssal coarse of proceeding. TJuit action, .of -jthe Opposition, i however, had not ' produced J the result ther 'anticipated; and is',"*>* happy to s»y that1 it- had but' one effect " ont-of doors \- thai -of ondirided disgust.- and ineffable onj tempt. (Applause.) When he first heard of it, hU feelings were those i>f violent anger,'which, however, soon snbsided into calm enduring contempt for the men, who, because ther yj^e_diskppoiiite<l in-lheir exotclalidjri~by a change of Ministry, could tarn round, and in their absynceTraake such unfounded charges against them." '("Applause.) The next mast important-act oMris life, whRVhe EaoT to refer^toj was the fact of hUjohiing^the ]presCTt Ministry,and in order , to. do io he would haTe to go back' :to some( eighteen or twenty months ago^At1 that timeJie; Heales' Ministry went out of ' office, - -aft erT' a! .rallsnt fight- They had gone into the House,'in ih>® first instance* depending on a majority-which bji some clever ueais was cnnrcrted JoLo-a.r^rinoritv\ _iijd it would fco Tecolleaed that they went out of;s . office on^a -fal^. issue. . Ther went ont because it'j was said'fir lie Opposition that their Estimates were1: unreliable," and yet the incoming Government ] brought forward* theirs on precisely the same ?. principles. (Cheers, and^" and so they did.") Well, he with the others went out, and although he looked on tie means which the incoming Ministry bad adopted to turn them out as anything but respect able, he felt content to let it go, and not to al'ow such feelings to influence him in embarrassing the Ministrr in the House. He had always deprecated repeated changes of Government as injurious to the interests of the country, and had never lent himself to anT act to put out a Ministry, with- i out valid reasons. He was determined, there- ! fore, that as long as th» Ministry brought ] i or ward measures for the public interest, and j acted honestly and faithfully he would not oppose ] them. "When" they went into office he laid down a i course of action for himself, which was to cheerfully j support them when he could do so honestly and con- i sistentlv, and at no time to offer them any violent or j strons "opposition." He determined even that he : would never trouble the House with much debate, j When the Land Bill was brought before the House, j he had only opposed the clauses which did not coincide with his opinion; In the discussion on j the bill he seldom spoke, and was in fact wearied ] with listening to the same speeches he had heard or ; read for the last lix or seTen years-nothing new, ' nothing novel in them. (Cheers and laughter.) He j was wearic-d out of his 'life' in listening to a re- i newal of thern, night after night, until it became no j matter of pleasure for him to be in his place. As he i had said, he continued in that state of not offering j any opposition to the Government until he found that j the best land of the colony was passing ir.to the j hands of speculators, and by collusion, fraud, and vil- ; lanv of every kind, that the land which should belong ' to the people was being diverted from its proper i course ; then in no mild or set terms he opposed the Government. It was then he felt a thorough want c>f confidence in the men who were governing the countrv, because he believed they-were acting in collusion with the men outside who were plundering, the public-with the men who were keeping them there. (Applause.) En passant, be might say he | agreed with the consistency of one member of that j Ministry on the Land question. He believed there j was one man in that Ministry who wished to carry j out honestly and straightforwardly the objects of the j bill, and that was Sir Duffy ; but in saying that, it | was more than he could say of his mates. (Cheers j and laughter.) Well, time went on, and the next thing which the Ministry, in whom be had then lost > confidence, brought forward was the Electoral Bill, which the Attorney-General had merely referred to as a little bill just to alter the present arrangements -a mere nothing,-in fact, a more easy method for the regis!ration of electors. Well, it would be re collected, the disgraceful means adopted by the Attorney-General to get the bill through the House on a second readingjby hishaving oue night suddenly, when the House was in committee, 'moved its re sumption, in order to get the bill through when there were few in the House to oppose it. They would also recollect how he (Mr Sullivan) had opposed it when in committee, and bow, with the assistance of others, he had removed certain defects. Then, to fill up the measure of his disgust with that ministry, he had to sit in the House, when be wished to be away -and often on almost empty benches-because he felt that be dared not trust them; that he did not know when they might take advantage of the absence of members of the oppositieri. to carry the most illiberal measures. It would be recollected that the tame gentleman who moved the Electoral Bill moved for leave to bring in a Newspaper BilL That he also designated as a mere nothing, but he (Mr Sul- j liran) was " not to be done" a second time. He felt j he had been sold over- the Electoral Bill, and the \ operation was not to be repeated on him. There- j fore, when the Attorney-General brought forward j his little Newspaper Hill, he cautioned the members j of the I ouse to be on their guard against the in- j siduous attempt, and, thus fortified, when the mere j little bill came belore the House, they were prepared j to oppose it. That bill had been characterised by j its projector as a mere little bill lust to alter certain ' defects in the existing regulations ; but which, if it j had passed into law, would have completely | smothered the public press, and would have de- i stroyed the liberties of the people. Instead of being i the exponents of public opinion, newspapers would j have become mere channels for the Government to j put forth their own views ; instead of their being | the custodians of the public liberty, they would hare ; been either stifled or have become the mere tools of j the Government. It was, therefore, with feelings of j gratification that he believed -he had been mainly instrumental in preventing the bill passing its second reading. (Applause.) Still the bill had been kept in Icrrorem over him, as he did not know at what moment the Attorney-General might ^ have stepped in and got it passed into law, but it was fortunate that the insidious attempt was frustrated. (Applause.) Well, all those things went on and in creased his disgust. He 'would not have been so much disgusted with the Ministry if they had openly endeavored to carry any particular measure. With regard to their' proposed deprivation of the electoral right, if they had come forward boldly, and avowed that manhood suffrage was bad .instead of calling it a question of the representation of the mowed interest of the country, he could have borne with them; but" instead of that, they were always seeking to,arrive at their objects by. covert means. He therefore, had aright to distress tbeui,undif . he could, to put them out of office, and believing that the rights of the people of this country would never be properly respected by them, that he was per fectly justified in taking the earliest opportunity of removing them. . (Applause.) Why,the Ministry,-, did not even disguise the fact that their principal object was to keep office and serte their friends, and. that such was the.case was instanced by ti<e fact of the Land-Bill-pawing into law. He therefore made up bis mind, that no matter what measures they brought forward lie'would oppose. It was no longer a question of the want of political principle, but of the want qf' integrity-and he made up his mind to vote against them, because their pievious con .duct had alienated from them, in and out of the House, that confidence which they ought to have I possessed.. In referring to the vote which had ousted the Ministry, ho said he was surprised at the result | of it. It bad been brought about by no collusion or intrigue,and it was with feelings of snrprise-not _un i pleasant surprise- heiound that the/vote was carried. Amidst his other surprises-and it was; a ' night of surprises-was one, that the _ Mi I nistry went out of office without fighting; ! not one of; them stood up to defend their position, i and when'Mr Duffy had spoken,; none of his col leagues supported him. He (Mr Sullivan); pro posed an adjournment, in order to give th«m time to consider their position, but they refused to avail themselves of it, and the result was they were defeated.
