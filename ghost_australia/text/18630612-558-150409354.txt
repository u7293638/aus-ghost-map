Tm]/.WS RIGHTS. lo inc baitor of the Ueelong Advertiser, Dear Mr Editor,—What a curious letter appears to your paper to-day. Pray what is it all about It is dated for Sunday, and speaks of something that Appeared in yonr paper of that day, which is the first time I heard of yoar printing papers on Sunday, A^d I think the writer must be mistaken. Anyhow, wother brought me the paper early- this morning, border that I might read that letter, and from the title I thought it mast be something interesting; hit. to tell yoa the troth, dear Mr Editor, I cannot Sflderstanu it. I have read it more than once, and SA-b time I get worse; for there are so many hard and queer sentences. Brother thinks Mrs j-mto" should eiplain what she means by the sR*r—whether she means anything at all cr not, or Tv £.r s*ie Intended to mean anything or not. Diiv ail I can make of it: That the lords of Ration might make right laws if they would; that 1119 Romans made slaves of the South Americans ; vD|. ihat venerable ghosts came out of the dead of malefactors, and that they played pranks 3cat capers in order to frighten living men. But, 'n» I do not see that that has anything to do with title of the letter, and I am sure I can't make S*7.mS better of it. 1 wanted brother to tell me tot it meant, but he says he cannot, though I shall 'te.l yon what he said besides; for if I did, and Cerito" found out who had written this letter, *Blight treat me ia the way she mentions about cae else in her letter. j-^STIXG Of THE DaIT AT COGHILL's Cp.EEK. flu a" iears entertained concerning the stability of jjl m al BcgUill's Creek have not proved ground .-:a- On Sunday morning the alarming news was tW .1 . ®_i__ _:„/i fliat 'lie earthworks were carried away a <ht*h at ^eas^ thirty or forty feet, and that the P»Q of water in the reservoir was only about five int* Dearty empty.
