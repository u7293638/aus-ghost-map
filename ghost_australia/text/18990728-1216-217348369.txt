S A I U H B E R N H A R D T . REPLIED TO THE CRITICISMS OF HER HAMLET. Mme. Sarah Berahardt wri!es to the ' Di : ly Telegraph'—:n French—in reply to criticisms on her Hamlet, * I &m; reproached with being too sprightly, too ' mannish.' It would appear that in Eng'and oue mu^t present Hamlet as a melancholy ^rofrseor of Wit eiiberg, bus I assume—b?saus> •jUak' S.eire himtelfEais so—that Ham- Ul w-is a 4 student' o Witteabsrg. 'It is said that I ao not play th.» -ad!ii');i. S jraCLicol Bai y where aunihii is tai. tbe tr&gi;'.io<> The ? E v;*h acor h:.s his own. I am iejroacbed for h iviug m "uldtd my rol«- »'C'>rdi:g to the eixKOiih century. Qiite so J The titne ot H-^m'et; is unlou^tedly the eleventh ceniury, if the '"'•roci-y of the play is considered ; bui i-e philosophy is much more recent, and the tr∈ of thought is that of a man l"BS savage and more polished. Taen, again, Shakespeare speaks of cannons, '>f salvos of artillery, and uses a thousand other technical words which are of the sixteenth century and not of the eleventh. ( I am reproached with not being sufficiently astonished, not sufficiently dumbfounded, when I see the ghost. Bat Hamlet comes expressly to see it; h; awaits it, and utters these words,' I will spsak to it, though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace.' These are not the words of a weak or languid person. When the ghost wast? to take him aside, he draws his sword against his friends, and threatens to kill them if they will not let him pass. That does not bespeak a feeble man. ' Seme wish to see in Hamlet a womanish, hesitstiug, fl gbty mind. To mi he seems a manly, resolute, but thoaghtful bsinj. ' To conclude, permit- me to say that Shakespeare, by his cohssal genius, belongs to tie universe, and that a French, a German, or a Russian brain as 8 the right to admire and to understand him.'
