ADDRESS BY THE CHAIRMAN In the evening the now chairman, the Rev F Bums, pastor of the Redfern church gave an address in the Pitt street church where the choir associated with the former body was present and led the singing He said that as the spiritual children of the men and women of the Speedwell and May- flower who had the foundations of the freest and greatest republic in the world, he thought he inter- prete I the feelings of their people correctly when he said that they heart ii v, sympathised with every honest effort in ide to draw these divide d colonies into closer and more fraternal relations But they wished it to be distinctly understood that any scheme that was not based on the principle of the devout recognition of God as the Supreme Ruler of nations and the fountain of all law and authority would not be acceptable to them He passed to the subject of his address, which was " The Kingdom of God in its Relations to the Church and Daily Life n One very common mistake into which men fell was that of confounding " church " with " kingdom," using the two expressions interchangeably, as though they were convertible terms, each standing. for, the same thing which they did not. Especially was that erroneous when by the world church was meant the ecclesiastical organisation of any particular sect country, or place Much as he loved their Congregational churches, he should be sorry to think that the Soviets had no loyal subjects outside the pale of their communion And for the same reason he refused to believe that any or all of the other con- great ones put together included every member of the kingdom The kingdom was larger than the Church of the churches No phrase was capable of covering a more deadly; error than the proud motto, Extra ecclesia nulla sMus " It would be more correct to say I was a regular, nulla salus " The two fundamental principles of the kingdom were the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man The kingdom was beat seen and understood by contemplation of the King Himself The conditions of entrance into the kingdom weiorepentaucoand faith, or to sum them up in one word, receptivity, and willing ne s to 3 vo up what opposed the reign of God in the heart and life and bid the kingdom welcome. The; could hardly conceive of the Apostles being much concerned as to whether the house in which they lived were called parsonages of lectures So long as they had a shelter over the) ear heads and food and raiment they were thankful Nor did they think much about what the gentleman who lead the paper at the annual meeting of the New South Wales branch of the English Church Union called the embroidery of religion " No they were of a more concerned about the warp and woof of religion than about its embroidery ' (Applause) That gentleman said that at the beginning of the Queen's reign a man would have been brought before the Bishop s Court for preaching that the body and blood of Christ were in the blessed sacrament " And so he ought if he was a Pro team t clergymen If he wanted to preach that kind of doctrine let him follow Cardinals Newman and Manning to Rome "But' paid theatre, 'now that doctrine was held by b shops archbishop, and clergy all over the world, and also by the instructed 1 city Some of them had long feared it was so, but the; mere thinks it, though SDIIOW ful, of know the worst from one who spoke from within the Church there was a sidelight on Archbishop V Vaughan s statement about the 700 converts a month to Rome It was not Rome v; without the Church, but the Rome; within the Church that was doing the work of PauL Was it for this that the mm tyres died and the fires of Smithfield burned as Was it not infinitely said that on the threshold of the nineteenth century it should be necessary to declare to Gluiatians that the Hut principles of the kingdom were not vestments altar lights, meets, and auricular confession nor even the flesh and blood of the Lord in the Sacrament, not meat and drink, but light houses and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost There was no official priesthood in the first Church, and any little of the sacramental clement-just the two simple ordinances of Baptism and the Supper All v are placed-, under Christ and none priests more than another the sacrifices they were to offer were eli of a spiritual character, as love, obedience, thanksgiving praise prayer, and acts of beneficence It was not until the Apostles and the hrrt Chnstu i father passed away that the Church took on a sacerdotal eh master They found that the word pi test was used as an official title in the third century, and in the fourth century celibacy of the clergy began to be enforced And what about those proper vestments in regard to which Mr Mounsey and the members of the Church of England UDIOU were so much interested i They) were simply the old fashioned clothes of I COO years ago As the Church grow more worldly her return became more elaborate and her h anarchy more complex and oppressive But the principles of his kingdom burst forth again in the glorious Jleformattou and subsequently they asserted themselves in the rise of Congregational independence in England in the days of Queen 3 hill eth Public senti- ment had to he Chii-,tianis«Mi But how was it to be done ^ By conversation example and the e regulation of a pure and wholesome literature He) needed a united and vigorous protest against the gambling spirit in all its forms, whether in the fall of the church bazaar- despite what the Prc life of this colony might sever the Tattersall's sweep, or a building society lottery They needed, to a more consistent and persistent witness against intemperance, impurity, profanity and the idolatrous lust of pleasure and Learn the home life also must be Chnstiauued Industrial and commercial life needed call; to be Christ harnessed No system which produced millionaires at one end of the scale and millions of paupers at the other could be regarded as a ratchet joy or just and it could not last in Christ and in His Gospel is, the infallible remedy for all the evils of the world
