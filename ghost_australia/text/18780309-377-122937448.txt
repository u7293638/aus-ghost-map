LOST IN THE SIERRAS. SCENE I. How silent are the Sierrnas in their top most heights, where tlhe grey peaks stand about in groups, holding up betwoon them thie little platter-like valleys ! VWe must go and stand on the border of one of these valleys. Now we feel the silence of the place resting upon us-n-are awed by the tall, frowning peaks. See ! a gloomy mist in thie west has risen up and reddened and almost hidden the after noon sun. Wno t ! in this drear place a lone man and his Ihorse. Hoow tired are both ; how slowly drag their steps ! Now theyhalt. The man, bewildered, lost, turns and looks about him; the tired beast tangs its lhead and stands motionless, glad of a moment's rest. Before them, darkly frowning, is a grey-walled canyon. It is deep-how deep we cannot see, for in the bottom squats gloomy Dark. Unismiling ms, the lost soul, she grimly sits hovering over her brood of terrors, as a hen spreads her wings over her young. Tihe lost stand perplexed and irresolute. They know, and only know, that they are lost in tIle high Sierras. Their knees betray their weariness and their fears. How great is the silence here P No sound from the lower world can reach this .height. The tall grey peaks stand about like voice loss ghosts. Along the narrow flats and upon the steep, unsafe slopes, are grouped thie white b?nes of lifeless groves of juniper and stunted pine--they are bleached as stag honms bleach on a plain, or the bones of dead soldiers on a battlefield. Did they die of the great silence ?
