VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. __ [By Telegraph. J I From our own Reporter. I Melbourne. October 8. The V.A.T.C. were favoured with splendid weather on Saturday, and the attendance at Gaultield was very. large,. During- the last few months extensive alterations nave been carried out on the course, which is gradually being improved, with Flemin'gton asa model. The paddock has been greatly enlarged, and the Stand has also been added to. Since Mr. Bond took charge of the Club, and worked it up to its present prosperous condition, the Caulfield Guineas, though comparatively a new race, has risen to the position here of a Two Thousand Guinea Stakes in England, and very great interest was centred in its results yesterday. Large fields con tended in each race, and the sport was first class. Backers obtained a foretaste of the reverses .which were in store for them in the Selling Race, for which Kanaka was made a great favourite, but was easily beaten, victory falling to an outsider, Milparinka, which was scarcely backed at all. Thirteen horses weighed out for the Hurdles, and the race wob regarded as so open that 4 to X was laid ou the field, and at the close Merry Maid was made favourite, more, perhaps, on account of having Batty's assistance in the saddle than from any other cause. She was, however, never in the hunt, and after Gambler had lost inevitable ground through bungling twice the Ballarat horse Sportsman won easily from Rhesus, who ran a great race under his weight. The winner was Dot backed to win much money, as he has disappointed his stable several times. The Fiemuigton-trained two-vear-olds who stripped "for theGreat Foal Stakes were a phu commonplace-looking lot, but St. Lawrence (an own brother to Uproarious), Quality, and Precious Stoce are fiue-Ionking youngsters; and as Heywood was very confident about the first-named he was inaae a hot favourite, and Bis Bis receded to 5 to 1. The start was a straggling one, but O'Brien soon had the favourite in a good position, and entering the straight he and Bis Bis were in front. Here Wyman broke a stirrup leather, and nearly losing his seat Bis Bis dropped out. but Quality came with a rush and collared St. Lawrence. O'Brien waited quietly with the latter, however, until fifty yards from home, when he sent him out with a beautifully judged run and won by half a length. Precious Stone came fast at the finish and got third place, just in front of a batch of four, among whom was Bis Bis. The twelve hones lel't in the Guineas were paraded round the jiaddock before going on to the course, and most of them were looking very fit for the contest before them. Guess work, who was very quiet, was much liked, and 6 to 4 was eagerly taken about him at the post. Frvingpan was the next-best favourite for money, as Mistaken looked small and common alongside some of the others. Transferred, who has grown very much, hod plenty of friends, and so had Caltna; but the Boolka party did not fancy their colt at all, in consequence of his having done very badly in his trial, and had he won his victory would have been a great throw in for the Ring. Mr. Watson was not long in getting them off, and when Guesswork was seen with a clear lecuct his friends felt very comfortable. To- their dismay, how ever, he fell back directly Frv ingpan went to him, and at the half-mile could not have been nearer than seventh. Mr. Pearson's colt in the meantime was making play from Heelaond Boolka, but as they came to the turn Gaesswork began to make lip his lost ground hand over hand, and entering the straight he was third. Being disappointed in trying to get up ou the in side, be stopped again at the distance, how ever, and Fry lngpan stalling off rigorously the challenge from Boolka, he won a fine race by half a length. The victory was very popular, as the colt was heavily backed; but Guess work's mild display was a great disappoint ment. .Not the slightest excuse exists for his defeat, but as he got off that " splendidly, it wonld appear that he is a faint-hearted brute, that will only follow up when he lias matters all his own way. Many persons blamed Bawling? for not going on when he got away in front, but the fact was the colt shut up directly Fryingpan and Granville went to the front, ana refused to extend himselt until half the distance had been covered. The Challenge Cnp was a fine race, and here backers were again unfortunate, as after jumping splen didly Erin had not the ghost of a chance on the fiat with the outsider Marquis, iarpent and The Hebrew were heavily backed for the Toorak Handicap, and the colt unproved on his Flemrngton running. by beating Larpent: but the race was a gift * " * Verdure, who got off first to the uncertain and was never collared. The effect of the day's running has been to.bring Fryingpan into strong request for the Canlfieid Cup and V.R.C. Derby. For the Cup his price is 100 to 8, but his advance has not weakened-the Assyrian, who is still first favourite, and it wonld be difficult to get more than lOtol about the old horse. For the V.R.C. Derby -Navigator's price is 2 to 1. Segeohoe did good work yesterday morning, and ho and Fryingpan are at 5 to 1 each; Guesswork is at 10 to 1; and Boolka at 100 to 8. The ollowing are the results.
