FENIANISM. ATTEMPT TO RESCUE COMXEL IHjnKE THOM CLERKES WSHJ MISOX. On Friday afternoon, December 13, about 4 o'clock, London was startled by the report of a tea rifle explosion in the neighborhood of Oleikon well At once alarming accounts were put in an dilation, but nothing threats alleged proved half so bad as the reality An attempt was made to blow up a portion of the House of Detention, at delicensed, with a man to come pass the i escape of that Fenian leader who has been for the last six weeks under remand from Bon street, and who is known as " Colonel" Blake the attempt did not succeed in its object, but it spread death and death notice through a populous neighborhood four persons have certainly been killed, and some fifty others more or less injured, many of them so severely that the worst consequences mo null created the story is simple and useful On the same morning the police authorities received information that an attempt would that day be made to effect the forenoon the Fenian prisoners in custody in the House of Detention It seemed improbable on the face of it, and al fast horses supposed to be a 11113Iuko in the date, and that the attempt was meant to be made on Saturday, when Bushe was brought up for re-examination at Bow street But a number of police were held in readiness, and detectives were placed in the sheets sin rounding the prison One house in the neighborhood, for some time suspected as a roman rendezvous, was particularly watched, but up till 3 o'clock there was nothing as to justify) the slightest action Atrocity minutes to a truck passed into Coipornlion Lane, accompanied by three men and a woman On it was a 10 gallon beer cask A cask on a li nek is no such novelty in all) part of London as lopistif) suspicion, and although it was observed by the detectives, apparently) lounging purposeless) about, it was not stopped on crammed When the men had brought the tin neck near the north east on corner of the well of the House of Detention they stopped, too soon to look around as I hough to satisfy themselves of the exact spot behind which lies the one case yard of the prisoners When the men with the truck had satisfied themselves concerning the spot on which the truck stood, the bung of the burial was quickly) taken out, a fuse inset and at the hole, in a match applied to the vouchers The men then turned away in different directions It is stated by some who were of witnesses that it was a woman who at the fuse , but be this as it may), the squib was ignited, and directly) 30 gallons, or nearly BOOlbs of gunpowder, or some oliver material, exploded, with a force «liiohtho wildest holds could not exaggerate It blew down about 10 foot of the north end of the House of Detention, which is 20 foot in height, and two bucks in length in thickness Ittoio down a house on the opposite side of the sheet, leaving neither stick nor stone standing It looked four houses on one side of his domicile and three on the other, leaving little more than the bin o walls standing, and these sounded with many an irreparable in each All these houses were occupied as thinly) as a rabbit women The houses in Corporation land at the time of the explosion were crammed with women and children, the men being cruelly out at work In a moment the hon ntl pillar of yellow the leaped up, then the billow of sulphureous smoke rose slowly, and the foul deed was consider missed 'the first shock over, crowds of people rushed to the rescue Women and children, covered with blood, were dragged out of the nuns, in winch for an home afterwards great fragments continued to drop at intervals as their weight overcome the strength of the mortar which had held them together One pool child, named M umo Thompson, had her face completely destroyed by fragments of glass forced into the flesh while other wounds were caused on lion both by glass dinner Though he (lost his A mine, of action to St Bnitholonii ry's Hospital, was killed almost on the spot, the bones of his chest being driven inwards by a mass of brickwork which fell upon him 'Iho she lets of the women, the shrill screams of the children, the means of those plunged into a state of painful insensibility, added in measurably to the lot rible nature of the scene the police were promptly on the spot, and found that the defenders had already arrested House of the four persons with the truck, as they hurriedly rushed away, from the scene of then unexampled outrage Soon cabs who found and brought to the end of the filled, and the victims of the atrocious crime were placed in them and carried away to the names!, hospitals At St Bartholomew's one of the lectures on anatomy was ndthossmg his clubs when the re port of the explosion boomed through the room He at once expressed his intention of remaining to aid the injured by what he felt must be a due calamity, though there could have then been no idea of its extent Set eral students volunteered their assistance, and at once the whole working staff of the hospital stood to their posts Nor did they organise Ihoinsolies in man Before long the wounded began to mine, and they were all promptly attended to A fun minutes after a acts The nimm spelter that at least one poison was buried in the rubbish of the house which had suffered most severely Immediately the firemen set to work to clear away the mass of bricks and pulverised lime which lay where a house had been, and they continued their labors until midnight. The courtyard of the prison, thrown open to the Street, was, within 5 minutes of the pipe tration of the outrage, occupied by warders of the prison, each armed with it loaded carbine They stood among brickbats which the force of the explosion had hurled 40 yards across the court yard, breaking the windows of the cells, and leaving deep indentations on the walls, where there were men ks 30 feet from the ground Had the prisoners been exercising in this yard at the time of the foul deed hardly one of them could possibly have escaped with his life 'The Fenian miscreants had ever done thou hellish work, and if they had succeeded as fully as they in tended Burke and Casey would have been among the first victims of the murderers murder it is, and no loss curio The police speedily placed guns day at the ends of the streets The warders guarding the breach were relieved by a force of the A reserve, under In spector Brndstoik, and soon afterwards ado attachment of the Guards in mud, and took up a position within the prison, where they remained for the night After the concussion, and after the smoke had cleared away, a crowd of people rushed through the breach in the wall, and surrounded the entrances to the prison The go vernor, not knowing their object, bade them disperse They hesitated, upon which he or fired a volley of musketry, with blank cartridge, to be fired, and the crowd, which had collected from curiosity, taking to their heels, panic stricken, the ground was cleared of the men udors in less than five minutes. The great body of the prisoners were thrown into an indescribable state of alarm by the explosion, and he loved the place to be on fire Terror stricken, they clamoured to be released, and some, breaking the doors of their cells escaped into the adjoining tornadoes Hlorls were made by the warders to appease them, but for some time in yam Casey was heard at the window of his cell calling on people to come to his rescue, and offering them money as an in ducement At the time of the explosion up wards of 10 male prisoners and about 80 women were taking exercise under the supervision of officers, in separate grounds at the opposite side of the prison, and they are said to have behaved with much propriety The damage to the prison from the concussion is very great, there being hardly a window that is not broken The following is an intelligible account of the manner in which the crime was committed It connects beyond all doubt the two men Desmond and Allen and the woman Justice, now in custody, with the conspiracy -On Friday after noon, between 2 and 3 o'clock, John Moore, the chief warder of the House of Detention, had his attention called by a police constable to the fact of a man, the prisoner Allen, loiter- ing outside the prison and refusing to go away He was joined by the woman Justice, who had been in the habit of visiting the Fenian prisoner Casey while under remand, and who had taken his dinner into the reason that very day They appeared to be recon nothing the prison The chief warder had seen the prisoner Allen the top of one of the adjoining houses, and had observed that he came down and talked to five or six other men He went to apprise the Governor of the suspicious circumstance, and while he was so engaged the explosion occurred Ambtoso Sutton, a constable in plain clothes of the A reserve division, had been employed to watch the House of Detention outside since Burke and Casey had been confined there At twenty minutes to 1 o'clock on Friday he saw the woman Justice and the man Allon near St James' walk, which in the immediate neighborhood the woman had been in the House of Detention at 1 o'clock, and Allan had waited outside When she came out she joined Allen and conversed with him for some time Desmond thou up period, and took part in the conversation, which lasted over twenty minutes towards its conclusion a third man joined them, and as I lie e, parted the man who had armed last pushed against constable Sutton by accident, and, having begged his pardon, asked him a hilling question, to which the constable, who had thus an opportunity of observing him, replied that he «asastiaiiuei to the neighborhood With that the third man walked on, and at the close of the convocation the constable son Desmond go towards St Jumos'walk He then watched Desmond, and, having seen him go along Corporation lane, observed him shortly, afterwards dinning a I nick with a barrel, which he put on the pavement The constable had followed him up by mines walls, n here Desmond stopped in the middle for a minute or Ino, and then went on 'the explosion followed, and then he saw Allen and the woman Justice running and) in) fast As

better to the jury to be sworn and a low The body, so that inquiry might be made at the same time into all the cases, and this was accordingly done 'The evidence produced was that of persons who witnessed the explosion, and was, otherwise, what is now so generally known Mr Moore, the warder of Clerkenwell Prison, said that a strict watch had been kept nil Unit today, as on the day pro vious they had received positive intelligence that an attempt to force the prison would be made On account of this the time of exercise for the prisoners had been changed, and so all chances of their escape

Richard Mayne as regards the defence of the prison He considered that if the proper precautions had been taken the calamity would not have occurred In this view the jury appeared to concur Ultimately a verdict of Wilful Murder " against all the prisoners was returned A strong detachment of the Guards was sent down to Portsmouth, on Friday, December 20, with a view to the better protection of Osborne house. The subscriptions for the relief the sufferers by the explosion at Clerkenwell have reached to about £1000 The promoters of the fund say that that Burn ought to be doubled to enable them effectually to relieve the distress which has been occasioned STIHTT IN0FVI)IAHIS1I On Saturday night, Wccomboi 11, an attempt was made to fire the very large premises of Messrs Pul nail, clothiers, of 187, Bishopsgate street, by throwing a bottle of phosphorus through a fanlight The premises, which are very extensive, stand at the corner of a coin t, which leads into Liverpool street and they extend some distance down the court. The miscreants throw the bottle at the fanlight of a door in the car that the aim was missed, and the bottle exploded harmlessly, as it turned out, against the outside door which was set on fine The Fire Brigade station is opposite, and the men were on the spot immediately after the atrocious outrage was committed They went through the premises, which were filled with smoke and prevented the fluid from doing any further damage than burning the door somewhat The building is 135 feet long by 10. feet wide, and is six floors field It stands in a part of the city where a Iii of would do incalculable damage, and as an enormous number of persons find employment at the establishment, the working community of the neighborhood would have suffered greatly had the attempt succeeded A rew aid of £100 has been offered for the discovery of the offenders Lord Londesborough, who lives at No3. Grosvenor square, has sent the following to the newspapers -" I should recommend owners of empty or unfinished houses to fit them with shutters, and their neighbors to see that a good watch is kept On Sunday morning, December 15, at 1 o'clock, an attempt was made to set fire to No 4, Grosvenor square, by throwing a bottle of phosphorus through a window on the ground floor Providentially, two policemen, who were on the other side of the square, see mg the flash, turned round, and were met by the watchman, who lives on the premises, and they then, with some difficulty, got the fire under. Of course, had no one been on the spot, the consequences would have been most serious." The same night, Some scoundrel throw a bottle containing Greek fire into the timber-yard of Mr. W. H. Latchford, Wardour-street, Soho. The business is extensive, and the foreman, who resides on the premises, while going to bed, after satisfying himself that all was safe, saw (flames issuing from a loft in which dry timber was * stored. The bottle, which was thrown over the gateway, a distance of 40 feet, struck a beam, and the liquid spread itself over wot timber and the damp ground. It was owing to this fact that the fire did not rapidly spread. The flames burnt slowly, and aid being at once brought to bear, further damage was prevented. The police suspect that the three different attempts which have now been made to cause a conflagration in the metropolis by Greek flag, within a few hours of each other, and the work of one man. The places selected-Biahopsgute-slrcot, Grosvenor square, and Solic, being at some distance from each other. Rewards have been offered for the discovery of the perpetrators of' those outrages. DESTRUCTION OF HER MAJESTY'S THEATRE. On the night of Friday, December 6, one of the handsomest, certainly, if not the finest, theatre in London went the way of all theatres, and was burnt to the ground in less than two , hours. The fire while it ago was one of the (lorccsto/or known in London, and though the main building, the beautiful theatre, quickly burnt itself out and crumbled away in a tower- - i ing pyramid of lane, yet its surroundings continued to blaze as house after house in the colonnade caught fire and were burnt from roof to basement. Those buildings facing the Haymarket and Pall-mall also suffered most severely, the houses on the Haymarket side being almost completely destroyed. The fire was first observed at about a quarter to 11 o'clock, and shortly after the first alarm all the neighborhood know it far and near, for thollifiilro was one gigantic mass of (Nemo in a few minutes. Anything like attempts to save properly-that is to say, the properties in the Iheiilro-«ns out of the question, for the interior glowed like a furnace, and the flames, darting through the Blight roof, created a draught which instantly made all hope of saving either the building or anything in it totally impossible. The fire caused its own alarm, and large draughts of metropolitan police from Scotland-yard wore instantly detached, under the command of Mr. Superintendent Walker and Air. Kotlol. They, however-, could do little more than keep off the enormous crowds that at once collected out of danger. Detach merits of the level Cupids, both from the Well- ington barracks and the barracks at the back of the National Gallery, came up almost simultaneously with the police. At least half of the troops were in full marching uniform, the rest in undress flannel jackets, just as they had been turned out of bed. With the assistance of this force Ihoslrools leading to the theatre wore kept clear, and the fire mains all round recent- .. street, Haymarket, and Pall Mill turned fully on The supply of water Boomed ample, and fire-engine all of lli-o-onginons they came rapidly - stamp were, under the directions of Captain Shaw, A * at once got into the best positions for checking the spread of the Homes, for all hope of extinguishing them at their source was hopeless. The glare at this time was seen all over the metropolis, and tons of thousands Hooked from x all points towards the great centre of the disaster, while cabs, carriages, and even waggons,' ' blocked the thoroughfares which led to it. In a short time the steam llro-eiigiiiofl here in full work ; and as fast as the more, it is to be hoped, obsolete bund engine's arrived they, too, were set to work-. The steam engines throw volumes of water with tremendous (force, and where their jets fell they seemed to explode in clouds, of steam. Not so with the hand engines, which required some thirty soldiers to work them, and the (cable dribble from which was easily directed and governed by one man. The exertions of the firemen were beyond all praise They climbed along parapets and copings at heights which made one cold to look at them, dragging with them great lengths of leather hose with which to play upon the flames at any point that Bcoincd of consequence, no matter what, the risk to the men themselves. In spite of flame and smoke and a terrific storm of burning fragments, they kept their places on the roof their comrades below now and then turning jets of. water upon and around the men to keep the spots cool on which they stood. The Boone was one of terrible grandeur. The roof of the theatre fell night a shower of sparks and burning fragments, leaving a gigantic mass of white flame in the centre, the very heart of which alone waschnrriiig'iip and burning building after building around it. All the steam fire engines were at full work, and the monotonous thud thud of those worked by hand wore the only sounds which broke upon the hoarse roar ing of the crowd and Ihohouvy flap of the great" sheets of Hume, which seemed to jeopardise the existence of every building near the place: Over the front of the clubs in Pall-mall The burning fragments fell thick as hail ; indeed, it was impossible at times to pass along this thoroughfare witltoutdiingorofbeingsovorely a burnt. The chiefs of the police the firemen .. working among these ; the shouts and cries of the men on the roof of the building itself and colonnade giving directions, amid the glaring uproar beneath, where to place the engines"; the efforts of the soldiers to keep the great moving mass of people back, all made up a scene as exciting and as grand in its terrors as the great fire some years ago at Cotton's wharf. The theatre was the main source of the , whole Uro. As is always the case with Theatres, it burnt like a gun-barrel, but, as usual, left a mass of Hume and heat which worked quickly .. and surely through into the surrounding buildings. House after house around it was gutted, and in spite of all the efforts of the firemen. The >* flames, however, were well within control, and the engines were principally used to keep the * walls of the main building cool for in many places they were bulging ominously. Still, s from this work they had every now and then to be diverted so fresh flames appeared in the Iioubcs around. It has always been said that Her Majesty's Theatre was so provided with large water tanks on the roof, Dial anything If It of danger to the building from fire was impossible What these tanks were doing it is impossible to say ; but one at least, when the flames reached it, burnt with a fierce flame like so much straw. That there could have been any water in it is impossible Of the theatre itself, one of the finest in the world, nothing remains but the bare, roofless walls, and Immense masses of charred materials in indescribable confusion covering the whole space on which the building stood. All the costly properties, all the wardrobes of the establishment have perished, as have also the instruments of the orchestra, the grand pianos, and a musical library of incalculable value, which had taken years to collect. Madame Thiers alone has lost jewellery worth from £1000 to £1200, in addition to all her magnificent stage dresses. The grand organ, which cost nearly £800, and all the stage scenery and decorations, painted for the most part by Telbin, Grieve, and Calcott, have been destroyed, and the whole fabric, with all its surroundings, is in ruins. By an odd circumstances, the only thing which has survived the general wreck is the dress in which the ghost in Don Giovanni was wont to be played. The actual and prospective loss to Mr. Mapleson. t the losses, is estimated at £12,000, and the disaster, as it affects him, is greatly aggravated by the fact of his not having been insured to the amount of a single shilling. He was about to effect an insurance, but it had not been completed. The large duty chargeable upon theatrical properties is understood to have previously deterred him. In the course of Saturday, December 7, Her Majesty, through the Lord Chamberlain, sent a message to him expressive of her sympathy and regret, and a telegram ' from Sandringham, in similar terms, accom- Jnr pained by an expression of hope that no lives He had been lost on the occasion, was received and from his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. The Earl of Dudley hold the lease of the theatre, about -6 years of which are still to run, and it was sublet to Mr. Mapleson for 21 years, seven of which are expired, at a rent of 3000 a year payable in advance It was built in 1790 on the site of the previous house, erected under the direction of Sir John Vnnburgli in 1705 which was destroyed by fire on the night of June 17,19 The first stone was laid by the then Earl of Buckinghamshire, and the house was opened on March 20, 1791, but for music and dancing only a licence for theatrical per formances having been refused by the authorities of that time. On the destruction of the Pantheon however, by fire, in the following year its license was transferred to the Opera in the Haymarket The architect was Michael Nbvo«iolskt, and it was originally called the King's Theatre, but upon the accession of Queen Victoria it assumed the name by which it has ever since been known It was the largest in England except the now Italian Opera its internal dimensions being said to be within a few feet of those of La Scala, at Milan From the curtain to the back of the boxes it was upwards of 100 feet long and 56 feet high , the width of the curtain was 10 feet, and that of the pit 25 feet The stage measures 60 feet from the orchestra to the back wall, and 80 feet between the side walls The building was of brick, covered with Roman cement, the entablature being of '"Bath, stone, and the surrounding columns of cast iron colored to represent stone, and 17 feet in height no east, or principal front was 233 feet in length, and 6 feet high In 1700 the interior of the building was partly remodelled by Marian, scene painter at Drury Lane The exterior colonnades and parades were completed by Mc Mrs Thomas Nash and Repton, in 1915 at a cost of £50,000 One characteristic of the theatre was its acoustic quality in which respect it is said to have been unequalled by any building of its class As to the origin of the fire little or nothing has been discovered, but the opinion is that it broke out first about some part of the stage Subscriptions are being collected for the relief of the employees who have suffered most from the catastrophe No circumstance of modern days has cast such a gloom on the lover- of music as the destruction of this magnificent theatre Only the night before the fire the grand musical drama of "Don Giovanni" had been given, when the Donna Anna of Mdlle Titiens, the Zerlina of Mdlle Kellogg, and the Don Gio rams) of Mr Stanley served to i sure us that modern artists are quite capable of presenting in an

into a state of the wildest excitement on the afternoon of December 17, arising from a terrific explosion which occurred on the Town moor Inspector Amos and sub inspector Wallace, of the New castle police on Monday, December 16, received information that a quantity of nitro- glycerine was stored in a cellar in the White Swan yard, in the cloth market, immediately behind the branch Bank of England and that it belonged to an auctioneer named Spark They examined the place, and found that it was contained in nine square canisters and in baskets packed in straw , they immediately sought the owner of it, in order to have it removed to a place of safety They found him at his place of business and represented the matter to him. He said that he would have it sent back to the person who consigned it to him, and in company with the cheers, he tried the railway company, but they refused to carry it An application was then made to Mr Nesham who has a gunpowder store, to have it put into a magazine, but he also refused to take it The case was then represented to the inngiFhatcs who, upon consultation, gave instructions to bare it destroyed The Sheriff of IS on castle (Mr John Mawson) is a well known practical chemist and the police applied to him as to the best method of dealing with this deadly liquid , he, after consulting with other chemists, advised that it should be buried in some of the creeps or crevices of some old pit work ings in the neighborhood but while these discussions had been gone on from some lines plained reason the who glycerine had been removed from the White Swan yard to Spark's office in the Town Hall, just over the Council Chamber This being discovered a policeman was immediately set to catch it, and between 2 and 3 in the afternoon a cart was brought and the canisters were put into it and taken to the Town moor the Sheriff and Mr Bryson, the Town Surveyor, with Sub-Inspector Wallace and a policeman named Donald Bain accompanied the cart to the Town moor They found a crevice or creep near to the Cholera Hospital, into which the liquid from the nine canisters was poured, but after this was completed it was found that a quantity of crystal lived matter was adhering to the bottoms of thereof the canisters ThoShen/f then instructed Wallace to put some earth over the liquid that had been poured into the crevice, and ordered the other men to bury the three crystalised canisters in the earth at some distance off Wiulo Wallace was shovelling the earth into the crevice he was startled by a frightful explosion in the direction where the three men had gone, and, running to the scene, £6 found that a sad catastrophe had occurred. The three canisters had exploded Donald Bain, the policeman, was nearly blown to pieces, and dead , Shelton and Appleby, two carters, were also killed, Mr Bryson was dreadfully mangled about the face and apparently dying, and the sheriff was shockingly hurt A boy named Samuel Wadley was lying in a hole dreadfully injured Mawson, Bryson, and Wadley were taken with all despatch to the infirmary, and the bodies of the other three were removed to the Cholera Hospital It appears on fuller investigation that the canisters when brought into the town were seized by the police, under the impression that they contained whisky They were conveyed to the Black Bull Inn for " safety." This is the story of one ostler, and the other ostler ho of the White S wan-supplies the rest of their native This person deposes that in the latter part of May last Mr Burrell who is now in India, brought the canisters from the Black Bull Inn, and asked to be allowed to put them into a cellar Hitvmg assured the man that it was only dirty grosse, and that there was no harm in it, his request was acceded to, but without the knowledge of the landlord The reader will notice the perfect facility with which an amount of explosive material sufficient to destroy half Newcastle was brought into the very centre of the town There now seems reason to believe that the three canisters had actually been buried when the explosion took place, the earth having been violently torn up as if by some stations near force If this conjecture be well founded, the accident wits probably occasioned by blows from the spaces of the poor fellows who were instantaneously killed The number of killed has been raised to seven Mr Mawson, the Sheriff of Newcastle, and Mr Bryson, the Town Surrey or, having died from the effects of the injuries they received on the dreadful occasion An inquest was held on December 19, on the body of Mr Mawson, and a verdict returned of " Accidental death," coupled with an expression of opinion that the law in reference to the s for age of nitro glycerine had been grossly violated The coroner was of opinion that the conduct of the person at Wigan who owned the dangerous compound had been very reprehensible
