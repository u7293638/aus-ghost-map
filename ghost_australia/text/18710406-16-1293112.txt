ST. GEORGE. (from a correspondent.) We have had quite an exciting time of it here lately in public matters We have linda public meeting for the purpose of appointing a road trust, at which six gentlemen were nominated, viz, Messrs D F McKay, George Kuk, R Hazard, Fnizei, Zieman, and Roberts, and it is to be hoped that whatever gentlemen may be eventually selected, they will be fully alive to the importance of the duty which will devolve upon them There is not the slightest doubt that increased facilities of road communication will immensely benefit both our town and district We want a road direct to Dalby, that is of the first import nice, our present route be Surat and Condamine being fully seventy miles round, and next we want the road open to Cunnamulla, on the Warrego, which road will open up a direct line of communication between Dalby and Brisbane, and the whole of south western Queensland, the Lower Warrego, and the Paroo, the whole of the trade of which immense district is now lost to the colony By the way, some time since a sum of money was voted for the purpose of opening up this road and the line I believe was surveyed, but we have heard no more of the matter The hove the mono] lately voted for St George district has been voted to be expended on the road between honored Suiut, if so, it will be completely thrown away, is like To of our traffic goes by that route Now and direct lines are what we want, and what we must try to obtain, and as the Queensland Government have quite) upset all our business uri statements with then border customs, the least they can do is to give us the necessary facilities for doing our buemoBB with Brisbane Mitchell's 10,000 sheep passed through here last week, I hear they have been purchased by D F McKay, Esq of Bullamon A line Ho It of stud all tip have also passed upwards, the property of Mr R unsay, Euthella 1 hear also of several mobs of store cattle travelling down the Moonie, on their way to New South Wales We have had a new "public" opened here lately (the fourth), and there is some talk of a new business and in the move to morrow The St George Amateur Clmsty's gave the first of a serles of entertainments the other night it was it complete success, both in an onion till- ing and (financial point of view, upwards of Â£12 worth of tickets having been sold It would be invidious to praise one whom all were scissors ing of praise, Biifiloo it to say that the whole affair seemed to be thoroughly appreciated b) ii crowded audience, especially the ghost of the pawnshop by Mr Kirk.
