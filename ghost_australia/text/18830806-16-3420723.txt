DONAL GRANTS By George Macdonald. Author of " Alec Forbes," "Malcolm," case. Chapter XVII. UP was not so late as before the next day, and before he had finished his breakfast had made up his mind that he must beware of the cart. He was satisfied that such could not be the consequences of one class of wine If he asked him again he would again go to dinner with him, but he would take no wine School was just over when Simmons came to him from his lordship, to inquire after him, and ask him to dine with him again that evening Donal immediately consented This time and; Mr cura was not there After as during, dinner, Donal declined to drink His lordship cast on him a very keen and searching glance, but it was only a glance, and took no further notice of his refusal After that, how co of, the conversation, which had not been brilliant ft on the first, sank and sank till it was not and, after a cup of coffee, his lord ship, remarking that he was not feeling so well as usual, begged Donal to excuse him, and proceeded to retire Doing rose, and expressing a hope that his lordship would have a good night and feel better in the morning left the room The passage outside w is lighted only by a rather dim lamp and in the distance Doing saw what he could but distinguishes the form of a woman standing by the door which opened upon the great st crease He supposed it at first to be one of the maids but the sea A nita were so few compared with the size of the castle that one was seldom to be met on am of the stairs or in any of the p issues, and besides, the form was standing as if waiting for some one Di owing near he saw that it was Lid) Arcturn, mile would have passed her with in obeisance But, ere he could lay his hand on the lock hers was thereto prevent him. He then saw that she was agitated, and that she stopped him thus because her voice had it the moment failed her The next however, she recovered it, and with it her self possession "Mr Grant, she said in a low voice "I wish to speak to you if you will allow me " "lam it join service, ray lady, answered Donal. " But we cannot here ' My uncle-" "Shall we go into the picture gallery " suggested Doml "there is moonlight there " " No that is still too near my uncle His hearing is sometimes preternaturally keen and best 'es, is you know, he often walks there after his evening meal But excuse me, Mr Grant-you will understand me presently - are you are you quite-" "You mean, ray lady, am I quite myself this evening '" said Donal, wishing to help her with the embarrassing question and speaking in the tone she had taken, " I have drunk no wine to night " With that she opened the door, and descended the stairs, the following, but as soon is the curve of the staircase hid the door she stopped, and turning to him said "I would not have you mistake mc, Mr Grant I should be ashamed to speak to you if-" "Indeed, I am very sorry," said Donal, " though hardly so much to blame as you think me " There you mistake me at once You suppose I think you took too much wine last night That would be absurd I saw what you took well enough "But we must not talk here Come " She turned again, and went down the stair, and led the way straight to the housekeepers room "Mrs Brookes" said Lady Arctura, "I want to have a little talk with Mr Grant, and I did not know where to take him there is no fire in the hour May we sit here ' "By all means, pray sit down my lady Why, child you look as cold as if you had been out on the roof there sit close to the fire , you are ill of it tremble '" Lady An entire obeyed like the child Mrs Brookes called her, and sat down in the door she gave up to her "I've got something to see to in the still room," said Mrs Brookes "You sit there and have your talk Sit down, Mr Grant I'm glad to see 3011 and my lad) come to word of mouth at last I began to think you never would '" Had Donal been in the way of looking at his fellow for the sake of interpreting his words he would now have seen a shadow sweep over Lady Aictuias face followed by a Hush, and would have attributed it to displeasure at the words of the housekeeper But, with all his experience of the world within, and all his unusually developed power of entering into the feelings of others, he had never come to pay into those feelings 01 to study their phenomena for the sake of possessing himself of the knowledge of them Man was by no means an open book to him-no, nor woman either He would have seemed to hasten or supplement by investigation what a lady chose to reveal to him So now he sat looking into the fire, with an occasional upward glance waiting for what was to come, and saw neither shadow nor Hush Lady Aictuia also sat for some time gazing into the die, and seemed in no haste to begin "You are so good to David" she said at length, and stopped ' No letter that I have to be," I returned Donal " Not to be good to Davie would be to be a witch ' "You know, Mr Grant, I cannot agree with you '" "There is no immediate occasion, my lady " " But I suppose one may be fair to another " she said, is if doubting, "and it is only fair to confess that he is much more manageable since 3 You came Only this is no good if it does not come of 1 on a good soul cc " " Grapes do not come from thorns, me) lady That would be to allow to cut a power of working good " To this she did not reply He minds everything I say to him now," she resumed presently "What is it that makes him so good I wish I had had such a tutor'" She stopped again She had spoken out of the simplicity of her thought but the words looked as if they ought not to have been said "What can have passed in her thought Donal "She is so different Her very voice is so different!" "But that is not what I wanted to speak to you about, Mr Grant," she resumed , " though I did want j 011 to know I was aware of the improvement in Davie I wanted to say some thing about my uncle " Here followed another pause embarrassing to the reticent lady not at all to the producer Donal, who sat writing in perfect quiescence "You may have remarked," she said at length, " that, though we live together, and he is the head of the house as my gun dian, there is not much communication between us " "I have gathered as much I cannot tell Davie not to talk to me " "Of course not Loid Mon It is a very strange "and I cannot pretend to understand him, and I do not want either to judge him or to set him out to the judgment of another I can only speak of a certain fact concerning yourself which I do not feel at liberty to keep from you " Once more a pause followed Though perfectly ladylike, there was nothing now of the grand superior about Arctura There was plain evidence of the sweet girl nature in her She was perplexed-not as to her duty, but as to the best way of doing it "Has nothing occurred to yourself" she said it length, abruptly " Hay e you not suspected him of trying experiments upon you "I have had a very vague undefined ghost of a suspicion that pointed in that direction " answered Donal "I suppose he is a dabbler in physiology, and he has a notion in his head he wants twenty 1 ell me what you please about it " " I should never have known anything about it, though, my room being near his I should have been more perplexed about some things, had he not, I do most entirely believe, made a similar exper uncut with my self a j cal ago ' " Is it possible ' ' "It may be all a if they don't mean about what he did, of that I am sure but I do sometimes fancy I have never been so well since it is a great shock to me when I came to myself You see I am trusting you, Mr Grant' You will remember I dined not have done so li id X not believed you would be at least is discreet is myself in the matter I believe the chief cause of the state of his health is that, for years past, he has been in the habit of taking some lion ible ding for the sake of its mental effects You know there are people who do so What the dam" is I don't know, and I would rather not know It seems to me just as bad is taking too much wine He pi ices Iniiisdf 011 Ins temperance in that respect But he says nothing of the other thing I have even heard him, in conversation with Mr. de michael, make the remark that it skins opium is worse than getting drunk, for opium destroys 11101 ii sense much more than whisky 01 anything of that kind I don't say my uncle takes opium I have heard there are other things, even worse, that people take ' 3 'The sole right of publication 111 Queensland of ' Donal Gi ml has been purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company Limited. "And he dared to give it to you whatever it was '" said Donal, with indignation "I am sure he gave me something For once that I dined with him but I cannot describe to you the strange effect what he gave me had upon me I think then wanted to watch the effect of it on one who knew nothing of what she had taken They say the effect of such things is a pleasant one upon most people, at least until they have indulged in it for some time, but for my part I found it very different I would not go through such agonies again for the w order She ceased Donal saw that she was struggling with a painful remembrance He hastened to speak "thank you heartily, and had), for your warning It was because of such a suspicion that this evening I did not even taste wine If I have not taken any of the drug in some thing else, I am safe from the insanity I can call it nothing else that has possessed me the last two nights " ' ' Was it very dreadful '" asked Lady Arctura, with concern "On the contrary gave me a feeling of innate faculty such as I could never have conceived of " Oh, Mr Grant ' do take care Do not be tempted to take it again I don't know what it might not have led me to do if I had found it pie wait, for lara sorely tried with painful thought!) I feel sometimes I would do almost anything to get rid of them ' There must be a good way of gethngriel of them 'think it of Gods mean), said Dora, that you cannot get rid of them so " ' I do , I do i ' "The shield of His presence was over you then ' "How glad I should be to think so ' But we have no right to think so till we believe in Gin stand-in is a terrible thing to say) -I don't know that I believe " 'Whoever taught you that will have to miss co for teaching a ten table he," said Donal Did not Christ do all he could to save the world, and will anyone d ii e to say that God, h hose visible presence Christ was, is not doing all he can, with all the power of a master over the creature helms made, to help and deliver them'' ' I know He makes His sun to shine and His rain to fall upon the good and the bad, but that is only of this w of his good things in "Do you mean are you able to worship a God who will give you all the little things He does not care much about, but will not do His best for you will not give you help to do the thing He wants you to do, but which you do not know how to do' ' "But there are things He cannot do till we believe in Christ'' " That is very true But that does not say that God does not do all that can be done for even the worst of men to help him to believe I He finds it very hard to teach us, but he is never tired of trying Anyone who is willing to be taught of God will be taught, and thoroughly taught, by Him People tell such terrible lies about God, judging him by their own foolish selves ' ' " I am afraid I am doing wrong in listening to you, Mr Grant I do wish what you say might be true, but are you not in danger you will pardon me for saying it-of presumption ' How could all the good people he wrong ' ' "Because the greater part of the teachers among them have always set themselves more to explain God than to obey him The gospel is given not to redeem our understandings, but our hearts, that done and only then, our understandings will be free Our Lord said he had many things to tell his disciples, but they were not able to hear them. If the things be true which I have heard from Sunday to Sunday in church since I came here, then, I say, the Lord brought us no salvation at all, but only a change of shape to our miseries It has not redeemed on, Lady Arctura and novel vi ill Nothing" but Christ himself for your very own teacher and friend and brother-not all the doctrines about him, even if everyone of them were true-can save you When we poor orphan children, cannot find our God, they would have us to take instead a some thing that is not God, at all but a very bad caricature of him '" "But how should wicked men know that such is not the true God' ' " If a man desires God, he cannot help knowing enough of him to be capable of learning more His idea of him cannot be all wrong But that does not make him fit to teach others all about him-only to go on to lead n for himself But Jesus Christ is the very God I want I want a father like line, like the father of him who came us our big brother to take us home No other than the God exactly like Christ um be the true God Cast away from you that doctrine of devils, that Jesus died to save us from our father there is no safety, no good of any kind, but with the father his father and our father, his God and your God " "But you must allow that God hates and punishes stn-and that is a terrible thing " " It would be ten times more terrible if he did not hate and punish it Do you think Jesus came to deliver us from the punishment of our sins' He would not have moved a step for that The terrible thing is to be had, and all punishment is to help to deliver us from it, nor will it cease till we have given up being bad God will have us good and Jesus works out the will of his father Where is the refuge of the child who feeds his father's here is that a) lad) ' In the for the corner of the room ' Down in the dungeon of the castle ' ' "No, no cried Lady Victoria, in his father's arms '" "There' said Donal, and was silent "I hold by Jesus ' ' he added, after a pause, and lose as he said it, but stood where he lose Lad) Aictuia sit motionless divided between the reverence she felt for distorted and false forms of truth taught her from her earliest years and her desire after a God whose very being is the bliss of his ci features Some time passed in silence, and then she too rose to depart She held out her hand to him with a kind of a desolate motion, then suddenly smiled and said "I wish I might ask you something I know it is a i odd question, but if you could see all you I could answer mc, and let the offence go" I will answer you anything you choose to ask " "That makes it the more difficult, but I teal ask it, I cannot bear to remain longer in doubt did you really want that poem you gave to Kate Gi acme-compose it, I mean, your own self ' "I made no secret of the authorship when I gave it hot, said Donal, not perceiving her drift " Then on did really write it Donal looked at her in perplexity Her face grow very red, and the tears began to come in her eyes " You must pardon me," she said, "I am so ignorant And we live in such an out of the way place that-that it seems so unlikely a real poet-' And then I have been told there are people who have a passion for appearing to do the thing they are not able to do, and I was anxious to be sure And my mind kept brooding over it, and longing to be sure . so I resolved at lost that I would, even at the risk of offending you, be rid of the doubt I know I have been rude-unpurdonably a rude but' " But," supplemented Donal, with a most sympathetic smile (for he understood her as his own thought), "you do not feel quite sure yet Who, vi hint in prison reason can there be why I should not be able to write verses' Is it because I h appear to be in what you call an out of the may place' there is no rule as to where poetry grows One place is as good as another for that."

The labour is in getting the husks of expression cleared off the thought, so that it may show for what it is A man's whole life can) have just opened him before he begins to die to the generation lather birth of one vital thought, if he be a thorough workman in words, none of that life labour will appeal in his ignorance of the thought- save indeed we should say it is transformed into power manifested 111 ease " At this point Mrs. Brookes, thinking the young people had had time enough for then conference, returned and the three and a while and had a little talk Then Lady Arctuia kissed the housekeeper, and b do her good night, and Donal presently I otu ed to his act is!
