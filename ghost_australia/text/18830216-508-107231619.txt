With that last anguished ejaculation she burst into a storm of tears and traded he? face In her hands. Sir Bobert -uttered a hoarse cry of mingled love and pain, and made & hasty movement to encircle lier 'with Iitb aim. Dr. Jeffries arrested the movement. Seizing the extended asm, he drew it agitatedly ?within Ms own, saying' : 'Come to the library Sir Boberfc. Thisis ter rible — ^terrible ! Maddie -will folldi/ with Lady JtSeauchanip/ Perceiving that Mrs Jeffries' had already gathered the weeping siren to her motherly bosom, Sir Eobert instantly acquiesced, But Lady Beaachamp indulged in no lengthy exhibition of her grief. By the time the doctor had comfortably seated his old. friend she made her effective entrance, leaning on Mrs Jeffries's arm. Her sad, soft-voiced apology for her * -weakness* only strengthened the profound admiration she had already elicited, end Bhe seated herself beside Sir Eobert, glowing -with secret satisfection and . confidence. 'The game is already von/ she said to-herself ?- — ' already -won/ She permitted Sir Bobert to describe the«cene Ehe had surprised in the library, and then in stantly followed it with an exaggerated account of all that had transpired in Nina's boudoir, men tioning, as a startling finale, the discovery of the book. It proved a startling one. Doctor Jeffries . opened his mouth in a shocked exclamation. Till that moment neither he nor iiis wife -had. made a movement or uttered a eound. ' Is she tampering ?with antidote's P he er claimed. ' Alas ! we fear it-/ Lady Beauchamp made that answer with &. short; sobbing breath and filling eyes. Before she could say more Doctor Jeffries burst out vehemently, addressing the stricken 614 baronet.

He hastity cleared his throat, while Mrs. Jeffries turned her head to brash away a tear. ?The doctor recovered himself on the instant. ' The first thing in order/ he continued, ' is to send for Eogers, who, as yon know, is a friend of mine.

Up to that point Sir Eobert had sat glariner at him in a growing horror which Lady Beauchamp deemed it expedient to- allowfull expression from Msownlips. _ . ,§he was curiously speculating «pon his reply, and the probable length of time before he would speak, when he all at once,, started violently ?from his chair.
