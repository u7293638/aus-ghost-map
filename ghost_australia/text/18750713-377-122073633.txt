Eve, looking uppm Eden at the myriads of stars, "sparkliog consation on the darkest mind"-throbbing lie "living.eap phires" in the "measureless aure" of heaven-- in quires of her Adam: " But wherefore all night long shine these P-forwhom This glorious sight, when sleep bath shut all eyes P" To whom our general Ancestor replied : "These (orbs), though unbeheld in deep of night,. Shine not in vain. Nor think, though men were none, That heaven would want spectators, God want praise: Millions of spiritual creaturer realk the earth Unseeli, both when we wake and when we sleep. All these, with ceaseless praise, His works behold Both day and night." After Milton I need not, nor dare not, add another word ; except that amongst those " millions of spiritual creatures" are, doubtless, our dear departed, who, though unseen by us, are ever near us, waothing over us, and loving us, with an infinite tenderness, still.
