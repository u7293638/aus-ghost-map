Good-Morrow Blytho New Year. Good-morrow, biythe New "Sear ! ( 'om'st thou in peace to greet us, Or fcdl 'of storm and fear ? Our dim eyes cannot pierce Thro* the thick mists that meet us ; Is thy face fair or fierce ? "We look back thro' the past: Dead hopes—grim ghosts—glare at us ; Old cares dark shadows cast. Yet joy and mirth are there— Beauty 'midst shreds and tatters— Thou may'st be free from care. Is it ourselves or thou, Marring this life or making; Can we rule fortune now ? Can we in heart he calm, While grief our life is shaking ; Smitten by Fate's strong arm ? New Year, can'st thou not give Sweet balm to hearts nigh breaking; Teaching us how to live ? Thy brethren, dead and gone, Schooled u» in health and sickness ; Yet comfort have we none. Can'st thou not teach us how— Tho' we lack sight and quickness— BJythesome to be as thou. O take thy text and preach, For our soul's wisdom cater ; Trust and contentment teach. Thou, glad New Year, we know True art- to thy Creator; O make us true also! O whether joy or pain Thou art for us up-storing, Let us their meaning gain ! O God, within this year, Answer our soul's imploring; O bring Thyself more near. C.R.W.
