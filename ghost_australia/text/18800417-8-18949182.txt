BAPTISM AT A ETJNEEAL. New Haven, Conn., Feb. 26.-On Tuesday morning last Mrs. Jennie Renfrew died in her room in the third story of a house on Broadway. The doctor who was with her said that it was " as near a case of starvation as could be." Ten years ago she and her mother lived in Pittsfield, Mass., where they owned a little house, and her mother suppor- ted them by teaching school. After the daughter was married, her husband came to New Haven, and brought his wife and her mother. Domestic trouble came, and Mrs. Renfrew obtained a divorce and the custody of her little daughter Minnie. The little money that Mrs. Renfrew and her mother | had was soon spent, and Mrs, Renfrew went to work in a factorj. She was taken sick, and the family suffered greatly for food and fuel before their wants were known. About a week ago their condition became known, but it was too late to save the sick woman. Before she died she said that it was her wish to have her little girl baptized before the mother's body was taken from the room. The funeral was this afternoon. The at- tendance was chiefly made up of factory girls who had worked with the young mother. The emaciated body of the dead woman was in a neat coffin. On the coffin was a glass vase containing water. After the funeral service the Rev. Joseph Brewster of Christ's Church said that in accordance with the wish of the dead mother he would baptize her child. The little girl, neatly dressed in black, stood by the side of the coffin, her curly head not reaching to the level of the coffin lid. Her face was bright and intelligent ; her eyes were filled with tears. The baptismal service was impressive. At the words, " I now bap- tize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost," the clergyman sprinkled water on the child's head from the glass vase that rested on her mother's coffin.
