The Wanmcl Examiner's Allora, correspondent writes as follows -"The railway authorities have not yet made up their minds about the Allen coal They have used two tons, and now ask for two more The coal has been used in workshops in Ipswich, and as fuel for the engine in one trip from Ipswich to Dalby, and has been pronounced by some to be superior to the best newcastle No arrangements have yet been made for working the mine, but it has been suggested by the owner that the Commissioner for Railways should send up a couple of miners to get out what he wants for a trial of it -The wheat crops about Allora and Spring creek are in splendid condition Two rust has yet appeared, and fairer prospects of a good crop have not delighted the farmers for years. It is very likely that most of the reaping will be done by machinery this year, as there are three or four machines in the neighborhood Mr Hegarty, of Spring creek, having recently imported two from Adelaide, fitted with all the newest improvements Bar the last English mail we [Burnett Argus) were pleased to hear, through Mr F G Connolly, that a Gayndah youth, John Joseph Power, who left here some five years ago to complete his education in the " old country," has had a most successful career while studying the medical profession He has now successfully passed the various examinations qualifying him as surgeon and physician and has acquired the following honors-M ROS, and L K and QCPI and LM We think we are not in correct in stating that Dr Power is the first Queensland native who has attained the above honors and that many who remember him as a small boy will be pleased to hear of his success We trust his two brothers who accompanied him will be equally successful They are both we are informed, studying the law A HilGiiTpro murder has been committed (Boys the Northern Argus) at on out station on Kiangaiun, full particulars have not yet been received but Sir Elliott has received the following information by telegram -" On the 3rd October, a person stopped at the hut occupied by two shepherds on an out station of Mrs 31'ïînb's, Kianga run During the night he stabbed one of the shepherds to the heart, who died instantly, the other he wounded, but not so severely as to prevent him from escaping The following morning the murderer proceeded to Mr Ferguson's station, and stated what he had done He was covered with blood, he said that he had been hunted by black troopers, who had tracked him all the way from Rockhampton From some cause or another the man was not arrested , it is presumed because no one believed his story On the 7th the police came upon him in the bush, he was then entirely naked He will be in Book- ham ton in the course of a few days It is stated that he is a lunatic The story about his being hunted by the black police was a pure fabrication " The Burnett Argus of the 9th instant contains the following respect- ing this extraordinary affair The dates given do not correspond, but we have no doubt the same occurrence is the subject of both paragraphs -" On the 29th ultimo a madman named Davis murdered a shepherd on Kianga, named Summers From what we can learn it appears that after having committed the murder the lunatic proceeded to Mr A Ferguson's (Walloon) and told the parties on the station of what he had done Information having been given to the police, Constable Sword started off after the murderer who had gone in the direction of Ghinghinda-and fortunately captured him on that station on the 6th instant, before the creature had committed any further butchery We are not acquainted with the full particulars yet, but will soon be no doubt " Of, Sunday morning, about 11 o'clock, Henry Byrnes, an apprentice on board the Annie, brigantine, was bathing in the river near the lightship in company with another apprentice, when he got beyond his depth and sank, never rising again Drags were got out from the ship, and search promptly made for the body, but without avail.

It is intended to fairly test the extent and richness of the lode before undertaking the cost of the furnaces Mr Daintree has visited the ground and his opinion is, we understand, very favorable another practical mineralogist has arrived in Rockhampton-Mr Ulrich-and purposes we are informed, joining Mr Daintree s surveying part) as a volunteer Prospecting is going on actively over the district, and in a short time we expect several copper companies will be launched with fair prospects of success -The Valentine Company, Ridgelands have declared another dividend of 5 per cent, payable to morrow, at the com- party's office -Two men brought in from Mount Wheeler to the Australian Joint Stock Bank, on Saturday morning a parcel of 300 ozs 17dwts of gold which they took out of a claim that had been abandoned for eighteen months One of these men recently returned from the Gilbert The gold was obtained from a small lead running through their claim at a depth of four feet from the surface, and about four inches thick They have as yet been unable to find payable gold in other parts of their claim, and the surrounding ground appears to be destitute of the precious metal The gold is found an ironstone and rotten quartz The lucky finders intend sinking deeper to give their claim a thorough testing lins rich patch affords another illustration of the strange character of the

now employed on some tailings The Morinish Company's machine has crushed 70 tons stone from the Welcome, prospecting claim which produced 190 ozs gold " Much confusion and inconvenience is created at the Maryborough Land office, says the Chronicle, by the system of granting special timber leases over large areas of scrub land in this district, without acquainting the local commissioner of the extent or locality of such grants, or, in fact, vouchsafing him any information whatsoever respecting them Were it not that the public has long ceased to manifest surprise at anything emanating from the Lands department at Brisbane it would hardly be credited that the gentleman in question is expected to adjudicate, primarily, on applications for land over which the Surveyor General, or one of his subordinates meanwhile exercises a concur! ent but, to all intents and purposes, sccretjunsdiction The consequences of so disgraceful an anomaly may be better imagined than described Selectors spend their time, labor, and money in searching and making application for land, the applications are pro visional accepted, and deposit received there on at this office, and when they are sent down to Brisbane for confirmation, the answer returned is to the effect that the land in question 19 under lease to timber getters The least the Executive could do, if they are determined to connive at the Surveyor Generals endeavors to nullify the free selection clauses of the Land Act by taking advantage of the perfidious wording of the 100th clause of that Act, would be to forward to the Land Commissioners in the several districts for which such leases have been granted full information of their area, boundaries, length of term, and other particulars the leased ground could then be plotted on the local charts, and although certain illusions respecting the extent of land favour able for selection would perhaps be rudely dispelled the cause of straightforwardness and sincerity would on the whole be a gainer by such a course M E gather from the annexed statement from the Gundagai Times that the dwellers on the Murrumbidgee are subject to occasional spin such visitations -" We regret to state that the buoy to which used to live in a pool in the Murrumbidgee, near Gundagai, seems to have quitted his old quarters , but we learn that a "host has come to dwell amongst us, possibly as a compensation for the above loss We cannot as yet indicate the spectre's residence of it has one, but the culvert familiarly termed Bennett's Folly, on the widening of Mount Parnassus seems one of its haunts, as we have been informed that on Sunday evening last a gentleman resident in our locality who was riding past this spot was there confronted by the supernatural visitant It rose apparently from under the culvert, tall, shadowy, and with a livid pies phone light playing about it such as a bad fish being in a dark place exhibits As the shape approached, the startled steed reared, and the rider's hair stood on end , but the apparition seemed to pass under the horse and disappeared with a faint hollow sound, like a distant dying groan We need not say that the horsemen made all haste to quit the spot , but we may add that another part avers that he has seen this spectre in the same place that it passed him by his a flash of fire, and that he thought his whiskers were singed off by it So far this is satisfactory, every place ought to be celebrated for something, and a well authenticated local ghost would add to our township s reputation ' On Thursday last, before His Honor Judge I Blakeney, at Dalby Circuit Court, Henry George I White, about 19 years of age, who had on the previous day pleaded guilty to a charge of I horse stealing, was brought up for sentence Previous to the Court rising yesterday John B Mitchell, booking clerk on the railway, deposed to being acquainted with prisoner's father, who was a shipmate of his He said that prisoner's father was some time since commissary general in the service of the Queen, and that the prisoner was nephew of Colonel White who commanded the 17th Lancers Some months ago Mitchell saw prisoner's father, in a hotel in Dalby, and he was then introduced to prisoner, who had just arrived in the colony from England From what he (Mitchell) knew of the family, the prisoner must have been well brought up His father came out to the colony some years since, and took up land on the Logan river, where he commenced sugar and cotton cultivation, but which turned out a failure When prisoner came out, his father had left the Logan, and at the time he took the horse he was looking for work, being particularly hard up When His Honor took his seat on the bench this morning, the prisoner handed in a character from a Liverpool shipping firm, on whose ships he had served an apprenticeship of five years His Honor, in passing sentence, addressed the prisoner, expressing his regret at seeing so young a man like him of respectable and honorable family in his their position He found that prisoner had been well brought up, but that was no excuse for the crime he had committed, and of which he had pleaded guilty He had tried to look as favorably upon the case as possible, but it was so very necessary to put down the crime of horse stealing, unfortunately so very prevalent in these districts, that he could not pass a very light sentence However, considering the prisoner's youth, his good character, and the fact that this was his first offence, he hoped that when he returned from prison he would be careful not to be again led away into a dishonest course of life The sentence was that he be imprisoned in Toowoomba gaol for twelve calendar months, with hard labor A COBBespomjem of the Dalby Herald, writing on the 13th instant, sends the following items of news from the Cumkillenbar Reserve " The few pioneer farmers of this district who have settled down on the Oumki lenbar Agricultural Reserve, after suffering a great deal of hardship through the effects of two dry seasons in the beginning of their agricultural career, are in hopes that they will have good crops this season which will well repay them for their toil With a scarcity of water, clearing and fencing, and poor crops in general, it required no small degree of fortitude to enable me to return here since September 1867 This spring holds out the hope of a plentiful harvest The maize crops planted last month are all up above ground, bearing a healthy appearance Though we have had a dry) spring up until about a week ago, there remained a sufficient degree of moisture to enable plants of every description cultivated here, at present to germinate quickly Some of the potato crops planted here in the latter end of August are a foot over ground, especially those of Messrs Hanks and Driver The rich potatoes imported from the sister colonies, which were planted here in the beginning of September, lotted in about six days after they were put in the ground, while the Toowoomba and other Queensland seed remained quite sound, and germinated in a most healthy manner The rain started hereabout midnight last night, and at present (noon) it is pouring down in torrents The late showers only penetrated the surface of the soil about two inches, while the present rain has already given it a perfect soaking A small patch of wheat, though entirely too thick, planted by Mr Koch, seems to be doing very well Those who tried cotton for the last two years have footed it up entirely out of the ground without, I believe, the least intention of plant ing any again A 3H7RDEBOUS assault was committed on Tuesday evening last (says the Warwick Ex manner) whereby a man named Peter Magee has received serious injuries It appears that about 1 o'clock in the evening, Magee in company with another person went into Hogan's Australian Hotel, Fitzroy) street Some parties inside created a row with his companion and attempted to strike him Magee interfered when the mob of three or four turned on him and struck him He ran out into the street, when the cowardly) ruffians followed him, and struck him outside the door with tumblers or bottles, inflicting several severe wound on the head Sergeant King hearing the row, proceded to the scene of disturbance, when the parties who committed the assault immediately fled The sergeant took the injured man to Mr Scott, chemist, to have his wounds dressed Finding that there was a fracture of the skull and that the wounds were very serious Dr Lee was sent for, who has been in attendance on him since Up to yesterday, Magee lay in a very precarious state On the following morning, from information received, Sei meant King arrested John Kennedy and Edward Connor, and on Thursday, James Dwyer on suspicion The prisoners were brought before the Bench, and remanded until Thursday next, the 21st instant, bail being refused in the meantime until the doctor had declared the patient out of danger The Peal Downs Telegram of the 8th instant states " The crushing machine stopped working on Saturday last, the water in the tank having become so muddy that the pump would not work On Monday morning the manager coin intended making a dam about two hundred yards below the machine After passing through the machine, the water will be conveyed by means of a race into the dam, where it will be allowed to settle, and afterwards be returned to the tank through another lace The dam and races were so far completed as to allow of the machine are commencing work yesterday, but it will be again at a standstill on Tuesday, for want of quick silver It was to be expected that delays would occur from accidental causes, but the failure to procure a retort is looked upon as an unpardonable omission, albeit several of the directors are sufferers by not getting returns from their stone, as well as losers by the enforced idleness of the machine while expenses are running on The stone crushed last week for Dr Candiottis 53 tons yielded 220 ounces of amalgam, and a return of 160 ounces or three ounces to the ton-of retorted gold is looked for This very encouraging and there is a good deal of talk about getting another machine Want of water is the greatest obstacle " In commenting on the post able visit of Signor Tamberhk and other celebrated artists to Australia, the Melbourne Daily Telegraph observes -" Opera having died a kind of natural death in Melbourne nearly two years ago, may soon be resuscitated Two gentlemen, one the Vicomte de la Chapelle, the other Mr W S Lyster, are actively engaged in recruiting England, France and Italy for such artistes as may be prevailed upon to cross the deep see to delight the eyes and ears of the people of Austra- ha It seems a pity to use any other than can gratulatory language under the circumstances, but our apprehensions are less for ourselves than for the speculators and the arts t s First, unless Mr Lyster- and the Vicomte can agree to combine their forces, both are likely to be ruined by a desperate and hopeless competition, and, next, unless the people of Melbourne become more liberal, and some of the ' critics less critical, the artistes are likely to collapse with terror Even Tninberlik may not be good enough for many who have never heard a singer of his quality before, and Madame St Urbain, who, we are informed, was the Martha who made famous Flotow's opera may be voted obsolete It really is a monstrous thing that respectable artistes should come 6000 miles to be informed that they do not understand the first rudiments of their profession, and that they must go to school again before venturing an appearance before a select audience of, say, some twenty or thirty individuals, who claim to be the most critical audience in the world' and even to constitute that audience themselves Tamberhk is not in his prime, neither, no doubt, is Madame St Urbain Shall we be civil to them, and be thankful that we can get anything like opera amongst us, or Shall we begin by grossly insulting them, and send opera packing for years to come ?
