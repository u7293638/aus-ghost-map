PORTFOLIO. Every phase and department of human life, its joys and sorrows, its hopes and and fears, its ordinary occupations and common features and inevitable vicissi tudes, whether it be solitary or social, - all have been touched and graced, and and smoothed and blessed, by this Life of of our life. All the conditions of our spiritual warfare, and of our interior life with God, have been gone through by Jesus Christ. He has placed Himself in that relation to the providence and will of His Father which He desires us to occupy; He has obeyed the guidance of the Holy Ghost as we are to obey Him; the ordinary means of grace have been made such to us by His use, and by the application of His merits. He accepted the assistance and met the onslaught and the wiles of the spiritual foes and enemies of all human souls. Within the universal range of His mission to redeem the world and teach us concerning the Father, He had a special vocation, an allotted time,'a defi nite task to do this, and not to do that, as each one of His servants has.-H.
