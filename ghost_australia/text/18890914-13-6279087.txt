O Hare at the conclusion of the confirmation, the address of welcome from the Catholics of the town and district was presented, in which reference was made to Dr Moore's visit to Home and to Ireland, to the establishment within Inn diocese of the orders of the Fathers of the Holy Ghost, the Redemptorist 1 others, the Nuns of the Order of St. Bridget, and the Poor Sisters of Nazareth and to the generous provision made by the Bishop for the successful termination of these orders deference was also made to Catholic education. Bishop Moore, in reply ing, expressed his sincere gratification at receiving the address In speaking on the subject of education he said that no matter what the result of political strife may be no Catholic could abandon the principles so long, earnestly, and conscientiously con. tended for, without ceasing to be a Catholic. The Minister of Education, who was reputed as of great scholarship, never seemed to have realised the true feeling of Catholics on this subject, For himself he would willingly merit live his life rather than abandon the principles referred to And should they (the Catholics of toda)y pass away before their just claims were acknowledged and conceded, the battle would still be taught by their successors, and would never cease until they obtained what they were justly entitled to He thought that the sooner this truth was generally and fully) realised the better namely), that Catholics could never compromise themselves in a matter which their conscientious convictions plainly told them effected their eternal welfare. As evidencing how deep an interest he felt in the advancement of Catholic education, the Bishop further stated that it was his intention at the beginning of next year to endow scholarships to the extent of Â£200 for the College of the Holy Ghost and the convents within his diocese, and he had been assured that his faithful priests in the diocese would contribute a similar Burn for the endowment of additional scholarships
