Ihe Exeomaunieation of a Biitingoished Heretic- Dr St. George Mivart, who has been excommunioated by Cardinal Yaughan. publishes in Saturday's 'Times' his correspondence with the Cardinal. Mostof the letters are onrions—one or two are suggestive—reading. Apart from the distinguished heretic's contention that a person ' may be actually a Roman Catholic and yet dishelieve in the Incar- I nation and the Resurrection '—a sentence that must have made the Cardinal's hair stand on end—St. George Mivart thus summarises ae a devont Roman Catholic—>he still claims to be so—his confession of faith :— ' The world was not created in any six periods of time; the story of the serpent and the tre^ k altogether false ; the history of the Tower of Babel is a | mere fiction; the stoty of Noah's Axk is aleo quite erroneous, as again that of the plagues of Egypt ; neither Joahoa or Hezekiah interfered with the regn larity of solar time ; Jonah did not live within the belly of any kind of marine animal; Lot's wife was never turned into a pillar of salt; and Balaam's aes never spoke.' Dr St George says theae are some of the things on which he has to make affirmation as part of the Roman Catholie Church's Confession of Faith, and which he Etoutly deolares any Roman Catholic _ who holds that 'the books of the Hew and Old Testaments, with all their part? were written by the Holy Ghost and have God for their author,' ought not and could not logically or rationally make.
