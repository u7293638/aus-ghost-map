CRICKET-SURREY AGAINST THE WORLD. This match, which created no little interest, was commenced on the Melbourne ground on Saturday afternoon. The Surrey Eleven con sisted of II. H. Stephenson, CatTyn, Griffith, Sewell. Mortlock, Mudie, Costick, Bryant, El liot, Blanchard, and Boxshall. Tho World was represented by E. Stephenson, Iddison, Ben nett, Laurence, Hearne, Wells, Marshall, J. Huddleston, AVardll, Conway, and J. Moore. Hearne wag chosen Captain o£ the All Comers, and H. Stephenson of the Surrey Eleven. The umpires were Messrs. Brodio and J. Smith. Flay commenced at half past twelve, the All Comers winning the toss, and sending in Wells and AVardill.' Caffyn commenced the bowling to Wardill, who opened the ball by a cut for one, and AVells immediately after tho change of position placed a ditto of the score. Gritliths was put on to bowl at the other end, and AVells mado a drivo for two. The scoring from this point by both Wardill and Wells was steady until Wardill finding what he. considered a tempting opportunity attempted something grand, and was caught oat by Mudie in the long field off. One wicket down for eigh teen runs. E. Stephenson succeeded, and was very nearly caught out the first ball, but very shortly after Griffiths got into his stump3. Two wickets down for 22 runs. Bennett was next sent in, and with AVells defied all attempts to put down their stumps in spite of the change of bowling, and were at their wickets at luncheon time, the score having been run up to something like 100. After luncheon Caffyn and Griffiths went in to bowl; and after a few more runs, AVells was sent to the right about by a ball of Caffyn s, after scoring 48. Ho was loudly cheered a3 ho retired. Marshall took Wells' place at the wicket, and from the style with which he sent the balls in every quarter of the field there appeared no reason to regret the absence of the English cricketer. Slow bowling attempted, and Marshall striking a ball too high, Mudie very cleverly caught it, and Marshall retired, after making 45 runs. Bennett was still at his wicket, apparently unmoveable, and Iddiaon replaced Marshall and ran up a very decent score when he was given out off- his bat, after making 28 ruiis. Five wickets down for 209 runs; the Surrey team apparently bavin; not the ghost of a chance. Laurence who followed Iddison was caught the second ball)from Elliot, at short slip; six wickets down for 209 years. From this point the luck of the All Comers appeared to have left them. Heirno followed Laurence, when Bennett was caught by Costick oil' Griffiths, after making 72 runs. Huddleston having just before been bowled by Bryant a duck's egg. Conway and iloore succeeded them, but neither added to the score, Moore being bowled by Griffiths for a cypbor, and Conway carrying out his bat with out an opportunity o£ doing service. The field ing wa3 very good.
