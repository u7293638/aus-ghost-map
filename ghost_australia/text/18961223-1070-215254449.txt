C" FBi-.M OAMEnA."l ologising' for my : dismal failuio as a iri_jthe past, I would respootfully aco for tho. following roviow of tho Jay handioaps in tho hopo that Damo may emtio more benignantly upon 'his occasion than sho has dono . So-far as my judgment goes, 1 do . any list previously published horo v oontainod so many " likely winners" as i ono I am about to roviow, and that is tho resident's Handicap/ 190 yards. For many years past thoro has always been a largo number of ontrants for similar , events, who v might fittingly bo dubbed "patriotic peds," whoso chances of running prominently in . their heats ovon woro as remote as.the .forth " " Pole. But this class has been on thodcoUnoT \- - - until in tho present instance it is practically non-existent, therefore tho tipster is for- bidden the ploasuro of braokoting a dozen or .'v . . . so names together, and asserting confidently that nono of them have ovon a "ghost of a Bhow" of winning a heat. To proceed, Mr. \- Editor, I think M'Garrigal on 3 yards, pro- vidlng ho is in anything like condition, nas something better than an outside show of winning hiB way into tho second round, . while Joronos (ab), H. J. Harris ualuoky . Harry , and the possessor of that good, tld, ; r . hiBtorio namo Burgoyno, on 7 yards, will v, . mako things dcoidedly Sultry for nil \fhom . thoy may happon to bump'qp against. Both of tho 0 yard men (Eennedy- and Smith) are V. undoubted fliers, and should sucoecd in getting into Iho seoond round. A. D. Bond / — -\uuu a. xj. AAuyui uu iv yucuu, uuvu liiuiijr r": -.

On tie 12 yards mark are Boms-real daisies, viz., , . Jas. Curtis, Cooky White, T. A.- Thorjey, and . / R. Fronoh, and it will not surprise raoAnWho, \- - least if the handicap is won from that limit. J. P. O'Oonnoll. J. Hourigan, and W. G.
