Bcsire ior Chan Wiso is tlio individual who gratifies in him self lite desire for change. There are three' things which enter mostly, into recreation— uncertainly, wonder, nnd tlio exercise of skill in tilings which nre not of the ordinary daily work.

In hunting, fishing, and the felling, of trees thoro is an exercise of skill apart from the ordinary labour of the day. Those w'holmvo mental work to Jo ought to have some inanual labour nftcr ivnnls, nnd those have manual • labour should find recreation and refreshment in mental; occupation oi! sonic 'kind'or other.; .
