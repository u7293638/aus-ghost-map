EFFECT OF A PRACTICAL JOKE.—The following r port of a somewhat singular case, which was heard at the Buninvong police court, on Wednesday last, 13 givsn by the Ballarat Sn, by way of showing results which sometimes arise from practical joking: d —" It appears that two young'men in the employ- ment of Mr Scott, squatter, of Mount Bunninyong, had been over assidious in the ir attention to some of , the fair sex in that gentleman's employment; and the result was a spirit of rivalry. One Sunday evening one of the rivals having titivated himself to an extraordinary extent previous to his departure to the Scotch Church, placed a new black coat on his perand further adorned his cranium with a new black bell-topper, when, to his horror he discovered that •ame person had filledthe hat with flour! and, as he placed the article on his head, the flourwas not only scattered all over his parted locks, but ran down his neck, and likewise destroyed his fashionable Sunday coat. Suspecting his rivalto be the author of the d mischief, he went to him next morning, and the resulfWaa a row, which ended in one of the parties getting a fracture of the jaw-bone, which detained him-in the Geelong Hospital for six weeks, and- for the injuries inflicted he sought £20 dvnazes. The bench assessed the injury at £5, and 2s 6d costs." . A MOVEET'S IKOISCKETIO!! aits ns COSSGQCEKCES ; A fightof a very peculiar character, in a menagerie is reported in the Ballaarat Star of Monday, as fol- -]ows,:—"Last evening, one ot the monkeys on exhibition in Start-street, at the menagerie of Mr Stutt, contrived to make his escape from his cage, and \- qzndkly gafried the roof of the ctrcnis;': where byjts " antics it afforded a considerable source of amusement to a little crowd who were present watchhigits manoeuvres. - OA his descent he went straight to the den in which the beautiful spotted leopard is confined. and by an exertion of strength very remarkable for such a small beast, raised the heavy iron door rfibe leopard's den and entered. It appeared there had been existi&z; -some little coolness between these two members of Mr Stutt's company, and the monkey on gaining the ioteriorof the den, showed fight,but did #0 to his cost, aa the leopard seized him by the throat, which he bit entirely through, and the unfor- monkey was dead before the keeper could -tunate . interfere, living only two or three minutes afterwards." \-- THE DiTtrtsroBD MURDER.—David Toung, .the ' man who has been for some time in custody, charged with being the' murderer ot Margaret Graham at Davlesford.on the 28 th -of December last, was yesterday bronght up before Mr Jnstice Williams, at the. CDtlemaihe Orcuit Court. The Crown Prosecutor read an affidavit made .by Detective Walker, to the effect that the case was not ready for trial, and that, ff the trial were postponed, additional and important evidence against the prisoner would be forthcoming; His Honor remanded the prisoner till. the. next Circuit Court, on the distinct understanding that he should then be discharged, unless the Crulrn -was f ready to proceed with the trial. . This condition was not to be adhered to if the prisoner- was admitted to bail, and his^ionor agreed to admit In n to bail ifhe could findtwo &uretiesin; £259 each, which his coansel said there was not the slightest chin.-o ofliia-being able to do.

He was on * mattrass on the ground, and the-weather beins hot, the dressed stump was exposed, and a swarm of flieswere, settling upon it. Presently a large toad hopped into the tent, and taking hu station near the head of the bed, bigia gob '- bling up thelloe "bottles in " doable quick." -The moment one aligiited witinn six indies of the (pot, he would square himself for the attack, his' eyes twinkling with excitemsnt, and then with a flash of his tongue asd a smack of his mouth, the unlucky insect would disappear.' The tray was asleep when this commenced, bat-soon awnke. and was at first frighttaci at die " ogly toad ' 1 to near him ; but our -friend bade hint be;.quiet,.and pointed ont thj service the ere iture was rendering him, when the negro and all present voted him a metober of. the Commission, with manvthanks, ahd he and his kindred were ai ouce in ldjh fiivor.— A MADMAS is A RAILWAT T(TAIS;—One evening last week' two'-gen-lemetf were returning- by rail fiom Wliitehavtn to liiverpial by the nigWe^ress •raiu from tlie north.- They ~had appartn tly only ene -tellow paasen^er; and he did not- appear until thty hid proceialed • >me distance "beyond Carafortli f station, A fhey were then alarmed by" seeitifr a tall, fert^iom loofeng ^pereon.Vu-ith *a liigp, beard aiid : mouA^e. yftdfy'rnnnirig almg the carriage "steps, aid'moving backwards and forwards in a most" extraordinaly manner. As thetrjonwasproceeding at a;rapid rate the person in question appeared tojbe exposing himself to .the. greatest dinget Among other strange movements,, lie lookyd into the compartment in which the two gentlemen were sitting, and; bBrs'ing ont into* kind of hysterical laugh, he asked them who the d 1 they were. The gentlemen so addressed naturally formed the opinion that the manWHS d.mented, and on the arrival of the train at "Lancaster, they called the attention of the porter to tbe Circumstance; but, as if having' method in his mr dnes he was then ^eietly -seatwi in his carriage, and was aUowed -to proceed in the train. Shortly after leaving Lancaster he resumed his eccei tr.c and dangerous performances .on the carriage step*, which he continued all the way to Preston,'where the train arrived a few minutes before eleven o dock. Here, again, the attention of the porters was called to bis conduct, but, as at Lancaster, he had managed to seat himself in his carriage, and was quiet, and the autliorities did not feel justified in detaining Mm. In a few minutes - the train again started, and between Preston and Wigan his conduct became still more extraordinaiy and e- alarming. The train was going at a vety rapid pace, during which the man was seen to skip along the carriage steps backwards, displaying the agility of a cat. At one moment lie was seen, while the next, like anapperation; lie was out of sight. On more than one occasion he looked into the ^carriage where the two gentlemen were silting, and presenting a pistol, declared his intention of shooting them. The terror and alarm which this tlireat caused may be easily conceived, for the two gentlemen were not in a position to offer any resistance to the madman. It was a great relief to them when rhe train arrived at Wigan. a little before half-paat eleven o'clock. Feeling that their lives -were in" jeopardy they jumped out of the. train, determined to go on no further if their fellow traveller was allowed to proceed. They informed the au-Jiorities there of .his extraordinary conduct during the whole "of the. journey from Carnforth, and ultimately he was taken into custody at Wigan, when lie was found to be sufficing under a violent attack of delirium tremens. MARHIIOB Asioiro ParEsrs. — Tbe question whether a priest can marry by the law of France, which is said to have been raised only twice in fifty . years, has been dedded in the negative by theConrt of the First Instance of Paris. The plaintiff, a priest, sought a decree of nullity of his own marriage, on theground that be was in holy orders at the time of ;the contract. The wife, though cited; did not appear, so that the other side of the question .was. not argued on this occasion. Counsel for the plaintiff-made a T_vy long .speech, end his arguments were adopted by the judge-advocate. In the course of the arguine t the Counsel said"It ia pretended that several of the apostles were married ;" I admit that, but whst I deny is that any of tliem married after they became apoitles." He cr B".ended that cdibacy "of priests was ah ordinance of Christ himself, who on several occasions had promised the kingdom of Heaven as a reward for celibacy. The Court, without going into. .any of the theological questions, laid it doWn that by the organic law of the concordat of Germinal year X, persons of the holy orders were subjected to the canons then prevailing in France, and were consequently under an incapadty to marry t and that this or^antic law had never ceased to be considered a law of the Stare, and that neither >be Code Napoleon nor the eontni' tution of the present Empire contained anything inconsistent with it. On this ground a-decree of nullity was pronounced. Another caso in wbich Jules Favre is council is now pending, but in tl.i> the question is raised in a different form. An interdicted priest desires to be married; -and the mayor, refusing to perform ihe 4 ceremony ' an action is brought to compel him; The point of liwis, how. erer, essentially die sane^holy orders are ^admitted to be indelible/and the fact of a priest beSng.nn- Jrocked cannot in I w effect the .^construction of the concordat reliid ou .by the .court of Paris.— DeSTKCCTIOS or CatKESB Pl8ATEJ.,-The follow, ing is an extract of a letter from a young gentleman on board her Majesty's gunboat Grasshopper.- It is dated St. Swstow, 13th December. 186i :—" When we left St. Swatow in search of pirates, and were going to Amoy on a-litlle business, we were stetun- speed when we sighted six small jainks. -ingatfull As soon"as they saw us tltcy set all sail.- andTmide. off. fastwe lay<4o and gave them - some grape abut, and all the men in the junks leaped overboad, and we picked op 76 of..tbau naked.
