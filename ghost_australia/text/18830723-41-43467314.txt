THE V.TL.fi. STET5PLEOTTASE MTVETTNU. HBy Telegraph.! Melbourne, July 22. The Winter Steeplechase Meeting held on Saturday at Flemington under the auspices of the V.R.C. was a great success. The weather was fine, and the attendance large, the Go vernor and suite being present. The course was in good order, but the going was a little Blower than usual. Each event was con tested well, the racing being equal to any previous meeting. Not one favourite won, and the books had all the best of it, the public being very hard hit. In the Grand National Steeplechase Mclnness, the rider of Chrysalis, was killed. The mare came down at the stone wall, and fell on her rider, whose chest was badly crushed. He never recovered consciousness. Dr. L. L. Smith started a subscription for the lad's mother, and got over £100. The following are the results :— MAIDEN HURDLE RACE.
