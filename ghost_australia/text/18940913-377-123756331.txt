THE LATE MB. T. F. ADSETT. from a correspondent On Sunday lst, at Goodna,at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the funeral sermon of the late Mr. John F. Adsett was preached by the Rev. James Davis,the minster of the church. There wa a very large attendance, the church being overcrowded. The friends of the deceased had come from far end near, and the largeness of the congregation testified to the high esteem in which he had been held. Before the sermon Mr. Davies read two letters of sympathy with the friends and the Church at Goodna --one from the Rev. W. Smith. the Primitive Methodist minister, the other from the Goodna Primitive Methodist Sunday school. Mr. Davis took for his text Acts, xi, verse 24 ' He was a good man, full of the Holy Ghost and of faith." He said that the words could be honestly applied to the late Mr. Adett. His character was summed up in those words, " He was s good man." The preacher went on to point out the characterisation of the good man-(l.) Good in every relationship of life ; () good in relation to God; (b) to himself : (c) to the family; (d) to the church ; (e) and to the world at large. (2.) Good, under all circumstances--(f) in prosperity (b) ad. versity; (o) in the day of trail. (3.) Good in every place. His religion is not the religion of place but of principle. He finished with a few practical remarks,: (i) The character of the good man is attainable to all. All men cannot be great, or eloquent, or learned, &o.;, but all can be good. (2) A good man is a valuable gift to the world, and his death is a great loss. (3) What a grand place heaven will be when all good men will be gathered together. The sermon was listened to with rapt attention from beginning to end, all present agreeing that every word uttered was true of the late Mr. Adiett, be death having been a great loss to the Congregational Church, to the Sunday school, and to the district as a whole.
