A MISNOMEB. to the editor. Sir â€” Ifc appears that the paper called the Protestant Advocate has received a wrong title, as it ought to be styled the " Roman Catholic Advocate in General, and the Irish Harp in particular." I have a strong opinion that the editor must be a Jesuit in disguise, and only wants to advertise the Harp ; otherwise I cannot account for his so repeatedly bringing it before the notice of his readers. If he be sincere in his Protestant advocacy, to a poor intellect like mine, the better way would be to prove that the horrid revelations we continually hear from the English Divorce Court and the Law and Police Courts in England are only Roman Catholic inventions, and that England is a much more virtuous and happy nation (I do not say weal thier), than when the monks ministered to the poor and wretched. I am, Sir, &c;, COBBETT'S GHOST.
