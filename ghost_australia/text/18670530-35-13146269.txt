THE ADVANCED RITUALIsTS AND THE BISHOP OF LONDON. (From MicaJi, the Priest Haler, 61 the Rev. Dr. Binney ) On Christmas Day I went to i High Ritualistic Church The first service was the ordinary morning service, rendered, of course, with full choral accompaniment The priest who preached hid on a white dress, which seemed something different from a sur- place, with what I suppose was a stole over his shoulders, which hung down nearly to his feet on each side, it was elegantly embroidered, net find its ends enlarged to admit the figure of a cross The sermon was delivered in a sort of free and-easj.ofT headway, but was in miner very much like what might have been addressed to a Sunday school, the style and mode being at once elementary and authoritative Ihebild, familiar way in which the preacher spoke of " God coming down in the form of a child," was very painful and seemed to indicate that he knew nothing of those brain and heart struggles with the deep things of God," which make those who have experience d them pro- foundly reverential in manner and language, when they draw nigh to the awful mystery of the incar- nation He described St Mar), Joseph, and the infant, as forming a striking and impressive picture, and uttered an earnest wish that he had a painting of it in the church He seemed to expect from it great and important moral results ,-" The rude foot of the man who was about to enter God's house is if it were his own n, would be arrested by it, the lip of the pro- fane, about to utter some offensix e expression, would be closed in an instant, all would be penetrated and subdued by such a picture ' Among other things, he illustrated the baptismal doctrine of our Ritualistic friend, for addressing those who had all " been born in sin and in the wrath of God, he impressed upon them what a solemn thing it was, whether they would or not," to be made the te notes of the Hon Ghost,' as they had been made in Holy) Baptism" This brought to my mind the words of the Bishop of London in his recent charge, and I wondered whether he could be what his Lordship means by " the power of the sacraments The bishop refers to '. matters which have often at times distressed individual souls, and led to perplexity and separation gloomy i lends of an oil trained Cahimsm, and doubts about the power of the sacraments " It seemed to me, listening to the preacher, and remembering the we order of the Prayer Book, in office and Article ,-" born in sin and in the wrath of God, " original sin-which,in every person born into this world, deservedly God's wrath and dam- nation, '-that there was abundant cause for " dis trc"," whether this was the language of an over strained Calvinism" or not. If the teaching of the Church-the very first principle on which its whole structure rests really be what it seems, is that in spite of the Fatherhood of God, the redemption of his- manity, the golden words of Jesus about children, every infant comes into the world in a condition fit for hell who can help being " distressed" with an an parish that may lead to " perplexity and separation - ' year, moreover, is it wonderful that" doubts " should rise in thoughtful souls as to the " power of any official act, sacramental 01 other, of either priest or prelate to convey the Holy Ghost, and thus spiritually to transfer of child of wrath" from "the power of darkness into the kingdom of God 's dear Son The heart seems to revolt against the one doctrine, the reason against the other There are men who feel no difficulty about either, but who fully and thoroughly believe both They have no metaphysic d hypothesis that distinguishes between original sin and its innocent subject, so that the one may be damned and the other escape nor do they hesitate about " the power of the sacrament" being that by and through which the baptised child is " undoubtedly saved " Stripped, however, of all that may be held by men of extreme views, I wonder what our respected diocesan really does mean by his " power of the sacrament how far it goes what is the nature and degree of the evil in the child that needs its exercise, and what the precise extent and limit of its action upon it Alas ' I fear other theologies, beside that of the Church of England, need to be rectified on some of these points After an interval of a quarter of an hour, the service for the offering of " the Holy Sacrifice" commenced A long procession emerged from the vestry, went down the centre of the church, returned and entered the chancel, there these of whom it consisted took their allotted places. The procession was headed by a cross-bearer, carrying a large gilt cross Then came a boy bearing the incense-boat, immediately followed by two others swinging censers, and perfuming the place as they moved along, Then there was a long array of choristers boy s and men, the whole being closed by three priests, the celebrant walking alone, last, as in the place of honour, All the guests to pre chasubles (I suppose they were), elegantly adorned, 601 gh all different that of the celebrant having on the back a large splendidly worked cross One of the two attendant priests was his principal assistant the celebrant reid the commandments and the epistle distinctly and well, the priest who read the gospel, read it in such a my that I could scarcely distinguish a, syllable, though I sat very near The two seemed to have a great deal to do in arranging the altar, and putting things in their proper place there were large cradles on the altars Cross immediately above the centre, and looking as if upon it After a while, two of the boys advanced up the steps, the one handing to the priest the incense boat, the other holding up his censer , the priest threw in with a spoon the fragrant ingredients, and as the smoke ascended, he took the tense, sensed the celebrant, the books, the altar, and and was then ceased himself As the service proceeded, I observed that, in going through the prayer for the Church militant, there was a pause" made at the mention of those who had departed this life ' This may be usual perhaps, but it seemed marked At the prayer of consecration, when the celebrant had touched the bread, he immediately kneeled down before it, and remained silent for some time , he then rose, and when he touched the cup he did the same What might be his thoughts, or inward utterance", or those of some who were there to communicate, I could only conjecture, from the directions in their private Prayer Book The two priests frequently moved about, sometimes they knelt on each side, one on the second and the other on the third step at other times they stood in a line, immediately behind and below each other As the communion was being administered, along hymn was sung, adoxative of Christ present on the altar As the congregation separated, I observed that some coming from their seats into the middle of the church, bowed towards the altar before they turned to withdraw Altogether, the performance was a manifest imitation of the Roman ceremonial It was destitute, of course, of all that makes one tolerant to it in the old communion and in the ministers of a Protestant Reformed Church- great grown up men, dressed in fancy dresses, that, like so many children, they might " play at being priests, -it was supremely ridiculous, or would have been so, had it not been too deep and serious for laughter I dare say it was all done according to rule, as laid down in the " Directonum Anglicanism ' I once thought of taking the book in my hand to compare what I might see with it, but I refrained, out of respect to the sacred edifice and to what I wished to regard as Divine service As I walked down the church, I called to mind the words of the bishop of the diocese,-" The actors in these scenes are, no doubt conscientiously, preaching by their worship a doctrine which is very dear to them , but let them remember it s not the doctrine of the Church of which they are ministers " Passing out, I saw that many were there merely as observers, for some were expressing themselves with great seventy " I could have hissed, ' I heard one say I had difficulty to keep silence, ' faced another There were groups looking and muttering, with expressions of countenance and hard words which I do not care to interpret or repeat To the questions, however, " What are the bishops about ' ' What use is it our living bishops ' "What would our own bishop think if he saw this -" "Does he know what is done by his own clergy, and in his own diocese, over whom and over which God has made him overseer to some of these questions, might have been given as an answer the following passages from the bishop s late charge, to which might be added from the same document other like words,"-" Certain persons have taken upon themselves so to alter the whole external appearance of the celebration of the Lord s supper, as to make it scarcely distinguishable from the Roman Mass" Matters certainly cannot remain much longer as they are If these practices are persisted in, it must be settled, even though the settlement be in- complete, by some controlling authority, judicial or legislative, how far the liberty of altering the outward form of worship thus boldly claimed is to be allowed or stopped At present things are done openly, which are disclaimed by all the bishops, and no advanced Ritualist ventured to exhibit his peculiarities when his bishop takes part in the service A clergymrnsiid to a friend of ~ -- soon ... au,, ( may alter an the stir made about Ritualism, there was not half a dozen churches in London where it was to be met with, nor more in the countryside over " I have lying before me A Guide to Divine Service, ' published for the benefit of Ritualists, " especially travellers and priests, that they may know where they can find churches more or less to their taste, in " Great Britain and Ireland In London and neighbourhood, the list amounts to over a hundred for the Country, it covers twenty-one pages each on in average containing the names of about forty How far this Ritualists are teaching and advocating what, in the words oftheBishopof London, is "not the I doctrine of the Church of which they are ministers, ' may be judged of from what has been cut out from some newspaper and sent to me It is a Review 1 a small book called " The Catechism of Theology, and among other commendatory passages, the following occurs " It i"; in the main, free from all mere Anglicanisms, md is particularly sound and trustworthy in the Sacra- ment of the Altar and Confirmation, and of Penance So, too, of Tray ers for the Dead We have, however, three faults to find There is no section devoted to Our Lad and all experience teaches us that, without plain teaching concerning Her privileges, the Incarnation is more fully inch cr! The statement regarding the Roman view of Unction of the Sick, is opposed to that of the best Roman divines The plain truth is, that the disuse of Unction is one of the sins of which the English Church has to repent Lastly, we cannot co- is made with the very timid and dissuasive language used about Invocation of the Saints there is an interval, not merely vast, but boundless, between Misers e i t and Ora pro mc, and it is much more likely that Protestants and Anglicans en in their deductions from Scripture against the practice, than the whole remain co of Christendom, amounting to four hundred millions, should have mistaken the truth on this head for fifteen hundred years A new edition, correcting the defects, will add incalculably to the value of the book, but in the mean time, it will raise the level of a great deal of teach ing much larger than is now stands '
