MY IiADY'S PIiOT; OR, mug Ghost of Diavola Castle. CHAPTER I. ' A FEBIliOHS ACCPBA.TION. In the upper hall of one of the handsomest residences on Portland-place, London, a young girl was hurrying with swift feet and wildly troubled eyes toward the wide marble stairway leading to the apartments below. She had not yet passed her teens, and despite the white anguish painted at the moment upon her features, was singularly and strikingly beau tiful. Her hair waa or a aeep Drpnze rea, ner eyes ot the darkest hazel, her mouth small, expressive, and tenderly sensitive ; and her complexion of a pure pallor and delicacy absolutely faultless. In figure she was of the middle height, Blight, supple and replete with grace in every movement. At the instant that she reached theteadbf the stairs she abruptly paused and pressed her hands against her heart as if in the effort to control her agitation. At the same instant a door, some dis tance down the hall, suddenly and noiselessly swung ajar, showing a maid's be-ribboned cap at the aperture, and below the cap a pair of steely black eyes. The eyes looked cautiously but eagerly out upon the trembling form at the head, of the stairs, their inky depths flaming with a mingled expression of cat-like watchfulness and mocking triumph. The interval of a minute passed, and then the whole 'person showed itself, slipping through the doorway and gliding with quick, stealthy tread to the stairway which the girl was now rapidly descending. Arrived there, the maid stretched her long neck over the low marble balustrade, softly Hiifjing down a few steps in order to obtain a better view. The girl hastened from the stairs to the library door, and stopped on the mat. After a moment she seized the handle of the lock and entered. . . : At that the unsuspected watcher nodded her head, smiling her mockingly triumphant smile again, and betook herself back to the room from which ehe had issued. As the door shut her safely in she nodded her head for the second'-time, ' I thought so !' she said. ' Gone to question papa !' Well, it don't make any difference — the old man is not to be moved by her hand ; bnt I I wish Inez would come ! It's time she was here. If s nearly 5 now, _and that is luncheon hour.' * ' While the maid was thus pursuing her some what anxious meditation above stairs, the girl was pursuing her suspected purpose down stairs. ''' She had .entered the library with a hurried violence that had gained her the startled atten tion of its one occupant on the instant. That occupant. Sir Eobert Beauohamp, turned sharply around from his . -writing table at the sound, and looked at her with a countenance of mingled surprise and alarm. Both emotions found expression in one quick, questioning ejacu- lation. \- 'Nina!' he exclaimed. - Before he could Bay more the girl had flown wildly 'across the room and fllfflg herself in a. tempest of grief on her knees at his feet Catch ing his hands between .her own. cold, txembling ones, ehe hunt out with a vehement, checking entreaty- ..?

' If I die unmarried-!' she repeated, in slow, - hushed tonss, and with the same wildly stashed expression -with Vh|ph ^e had first, feear^ t^e ' words. 'If Idieu^Hnarried..?* ;i She paused there, and suddenly etripped.Tip ; tfel Ti^ie, flpwii^'Bie^ye irom ter 'd^lica^ white am. ' See, papa V she cried, rapidly, hoarsely; ' See how thin !

HI' die unmarried,' it says. Papa, I shall 'die unmarried' if — if, papa, I continue to abide under your roof.' As those last startling words fell from her lips there was a soft stir at the door leading- into the hall. A rich silken dress all at once rustled, and a tiny foot, peeping, from beneath the silken dress, all at once took an impulsive step for ward. But in a moment the dainty, graceful little figure that foot supported was still again, and the great black eyes for tha second time quietly blazed an ominous, unnoticed watch upon the pair. It was Lady Beauchamp. She had returned frpm her morning drive, and passing through the Vvq.'H with the strangely noiseless grace which characterised her every movement, had penetrated the library at the instant that Nina started from her knees to her feet. Absorbingly occupied with each other, and «e£arat@d as they were from my -lady by the whole length of the spacious room, neither the baronet nor 'his daughter had. discovered her presence. ' . Both remained motionless in the attitude in which those astounding words of Nina's had been spoken and heard. Sir Eobert was incapable of speech through astonishment ; Nina through excess, of agitation. The baponetwas the first to recover himself. A threatening spark in his light eyes, he grasped the arms of his chair, and epoke four quiet, very quiet words. ' What do you mean ?' he asked. At that cold question the beautiful lips of the unnoticed spectator at the door curled for an instant in an exulting smile. But the next it faded, and she was leaning forward, breath lessly intent to catch the sound of Nina's low, answering voice. , If the gill's last words had been startling, these which followed were trebly so. * I mean, papa/ she cried, in the same rapid, excited' manner in which she had before spoken, ' I mean that Lady Beauchamp makes mysteri ous visits to my room in the dead of night. ? More than once, in the faint moonlight, I have seen her fairy-like form bending over the carafe of water at my bedside ; and more than once I have suddenly awakened, to catch a glimpse of her stealing noiselessly from the chamber, and to find, myself faint and panting in .an atmosphere of strange, deadly fragrance. Papa, the young Spanish widow it has pleased you to make my stepmother is gifted with much evil knowledge. Papa, that beautiful young Spanish stepmother is slowly but sorely sapping the springs of your p&ly; child's life. Papa, before Norman Devereux rettft-na from India his betrothed bride wilTbe cold in her coffin. Papa, in plain words, La-|y Beauchamp is poisoning me.* ?- . \'-'% Once more the lovely, breathless watcher atthe door made an impetuous movement forward, and once more she restrained herself. But the move ment had scarcely been made and repressed when her fairy-like figure was flying across the room. At Nina's bold declaration the old baronet for got his seventy odd years, and started to his. feet with the activity of a boy of sixteen. His tall, spare form erected itself before the offender in a mighty indignation. His light eyes blazed, his thin, white mustached lips trembled, and his snowy head shook itself at her in a tierce, fiery wrath that no words could have adequately expressed. Nevertheless the words came, and in thunderous toneB. ' How dare yon ?' he shouted. 'How—' Hia voice died away to a gentle growl. Two little hands had -flung themselves carelessly up to his shoulders, and two black eyes, of won drous brilliancy, were looking pleadingly into hia. . ', . ~ ' Don't Eoberi 1' softly entreated the lovely siren. ' Don't ! don't ! I heard all- — I know alll' . . Then, as the baronet's gaze tenderly met hers, she g-ently drew his head down to her lips, and whisi' red a few words in his ear. . The effect of those words was terrible. The old man started. back and fell into the chair from which he had just risen with a face of such death-like pallor and rigidity that Nina uttered a loud cry of terror. . ' Woman .!' she screamed, * what monstrous thing have you said to him ?' CHAPTEB IL pREPAnnre sib bobebt's jtrsa. Lady Beauchamp, standing with her arms caressingly wound about Sir Eoberfs neck, and her 7 cheek— pressed caressingly close to his, answered neither by word nor look. In a passion 'of grief and alarm Nina caught the old man's limp hands between both other own and began «^«Ji«g them. Either her touch or her suppressed sobs aroused him from his mo mentary faintness. Ho opened Ms- eyes, looked at her with a sort of shuddering honor, and quickly -shut them ^ina observed it with a bitter -pang. ? ^Oh, papal' she cried chokingly, * why do you look at me ao strangely P Are you learning to hat*! sac, papa?

With the question as. to whatgheBboula do still unanswered, she hurried into her dressing room, and catching a bottle of rose water from her toilet table,' began to bathe hep ; reddenedeyes and pale face. ' ' I wpl go down/ she g?id t6 I^erself I. ' IwiH not absent myself, but act in all respect flfi Jh§Te hitherto done.

' Oh ! why do I needlessly dwell upon it ?' she cried' out sharply, the next* moment. rIt is enough to be forever on the watch.' A few minutes later she descended to the dining room, no trace of her recent agitation marking the eiquisite loveliness of her pure, pale face. . The last bell had rung, but neither Sir Eobert nor Lady Beauchamp had made their appear ance. The instant the library door.had dosed', upon Nina, Lady Beauchamp had again thrown her arms about the doting old man'fifneck. ' Oh, my husband/ she cried, tenderly, ? cheer op.

And as Heaven is my witness, Inez, your little child shall be doubly, trebly dear to me from this miserable hour. For alas, Inez, is she not now all the child that I have ?' Lady Beauchamp answered with a sigh and a caress, but there was a sinister gleam of trium phant fay in her veiled eyes that it was well for her Sir Eobert could not see. ? After a little she spoke : 'I grieve/ she said, 'that you have been so blind, Robert, that- the truth did not gradually penetrate -your mind, instead of breaking upon you wfth a terrible shocfe. Again and again I have intended to gently prepare you for it; but the task. was a painful one, and I shrunk from it in terror. And now, alas, it is too late..
