WHEN THE WAR IS OVER. Fancy the kind of ghost implied in a haunted typewriter ! It is a "clipping" idea, as Belinda's gossip might say. He is the spirit of Hetchards who once a month, besides writing to Belinda, dips extracts from old and current books. The reading of to-day is mostly by way of extracts. If there were a censor of extracts, the read- ing might be almost educational. But the titbitty publications are lowering the re- ceptive capacity of the reading public, and making sustained intellectual effort almost impossible. When the war is over, and its sequel conflicts at an end, we shall wipe out all the bitty ' frivvie,' and settle down to literature and philosophy, our minds well trimmed for fifty years of intellectual peace.
