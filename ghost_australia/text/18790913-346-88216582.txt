RELIGIOUS TEACHING. Etc. {To the Editor of the Btndbjo Advcrthcr,) Sir,—With respect to Mr. Clark's ahusion to my speech at St. Patrick's Church, Marong, I beg to istate that the reporter diil not take the exact words I did expre33. What 1 did say was—"That it would be as well to have the name of God erased from the schoolbooks a3 to make so slight an allusion to it. While a history is giren of the kangaroo, the dingo, the jaguar, etc., etc., 110 mention Í3 made of God, more than being Eome kind of benefactor." Mr. Clark's name may appear in the sckoolbook a3 n benefactor! the child would naturally ask who is this Mr. Clark : The book would reply, he is r.u M.L.A., an orator, a secularist, and so forth. But if the child.ask? who is this (.tod, the .books árc niute, the child will naturally think the legislator greater than the God. God is mentioned, hut tho child is not told his relation to God; he is not. told of Jesus Christ or the Holy Ghost, or what relation they bear to one another. He is not told how Christ came on earth, or for what purpose he did come; ho is not told what sin is, and how offensive it is to God, nor is God's power and majesty explained to the youth. It would be as weü that no mention be ma :e of God when no explanation is iiven to the.child as to who God is. But the'error nr. misprint was readily grasped by Mr. Clark, w ho felt very iudig»act._ Ño rinubt it was quite opportune fur an electioneering speech. lint Mr. Clark was speaking to christians, though YVcsleyans, who know well the benefit of a good religious trainiuj, and that nowhere can it be jgiven better than in the school room. — loar?, etc., >1.
