Coursing. (By 'Lk Grand.') Sydney, Tuesday Afternoon. At Usher's Metropolitan Hotel on Monday evening a meeting of the New South Wales Coursing Association was held, at which meeting delegates representing all the oountry and affiliated olubs were present. Mr. B. Coombs was' in the choir, and he explained that the mooting hod boon con vened to consider whether tho Association could, in honor to N.S.W., bring the Chal lenge Stake off at Booty Hill on the dates advertised. The Hon. Sec, Mr. 0. Sager, read a lot of correspondence from Belmore, Orange, Goulburn, Bredbo, Cooma, Carooar, Parkes, Maryyille, and several other places, and from eaph of the above places a number of hares have boen forwarded to the Plumpton at Booty Hill. The caretaker was present, ' and reported 150 good strong hares on the , ground, whioh were being fed and trained daily. Bo after some disoussion Mr. Dawson proposod, and Mr. Weir seconded, ' That ( as the Association has sufficient hares in its enolosute to run the Stake, they (tho Abso- ' oiation) should bring off the Challenge as advertised.' | The resolution was oarried without a dis senting voice. I hod a look to-day at Bolmoro Pork and its hqres, and I must Bay that they are the best lot of hares that I have ever seen in on enolosure, and should the weather keep fine puss will simply play with the majority of the dogs. | The draw for the different stakeB took place at Usher's Metropolitan, with the fol lowing result : — | Enfield Stakes, [ Messrs, Marks and Philllps's b and \r b Misty Bain (Liquorice — Misty Morn) v.
