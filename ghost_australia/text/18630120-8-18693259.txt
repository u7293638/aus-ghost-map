AMERICA.

Ourcorrespondent says that the De mocratic majority lu the new HouBe ol Representatives will be from 11 to 20 lhis being the fact the next question is as lo the effect vvlilch the change will have on the policy ot the Presi dent It appears that ho is quite sensible ol the condemnation which lils mcasuics have received Although the new Congress will not meet till December, 16GJ unless specially

already discern from the tone of the Republican press how that party has lesolvtd on ti eating the victory of its oj potieiits After deiiouuclne the Democrats for weeks and declaring that the election ol Seymour mid the Woods would be a base compromise uah the nec,ro drivers and a truckling to Lnglaud the Republicans iiow affect to regard the popular vole ua merely u ceuaur on military blunders of the Cabinet aud its generals Ihej pretend to think that it is not a condemnation of Mr Lincolns 6crvile war and Mr Stantons illegal arrests which is luvolved in the election o! nu Opposition Coneress but that the event is similar lo the out break of popular feeling in 1 nglaud which overthrew Lord Aberdeen a cabinet in iSoo Anxious to lessen the importance of their deleat the Hepublicans now copy tho trick of Mr Se ward in replying to 1 ugliind on the Treut affair und say that the Democrats assert exactly their own opinions-that the military administration has been dcleotlve and that the war must now bo carried on more vigorously than ever As the Conservative leaders to insuro their own safety and not to aliénalo any of their supporters have made use of similar language during their electioneering it follows that no su iden change m the lederal policy can be anticipated Hie Con Bervutivca must feel their way and not bring back popular favour to their opponents by any incautious denunciation ol the national acts Lnough for us at present is it to know that the worst of Mr Lincoln s mensures have been condemned and will probably be abaudoned Hie Conservative victory will prevent the great crime of stirring up Hit negro race to insurrec tiou aud It will iusurc personal liberty and free discussion at the North 1 or tho rest we must trust to the growing know ledge and Hie awakened conscience oi tho couutry 1 be most important fact in the military news of the mouth ia Huit General M Clcllan has been removed from the command of the army of the Potomac and lins virtually retired irom active service this displacement is officially explained as the result ol an inquiry into a charge against the General of disobedience of orders On the (til of Ootober Gencial Hal leek as commander In chief ordered M Clcllan to advance against the enemy and give him battle M Clcllan disobeyed the order nlleglug that lie was short of supplies 1 his state ment General ilalleok saj s could not be true as all M Clcllan s requisitions liad been promptly supplied Hie Harper s 1 erry investigation had also censured the removed generul for the tardiness with winch lie pursued tho enemy There is how ever no doubt that political consldtialions have had their weight in bringing about M Clcllan s dismissal Had M Clcllan been a mero professional soldier says the Dulj Ae u no one would have inquired what his political opinion« were but he never professed to be so It was well known what lie thought of the anti slavery policy ol the Government and that he dis approved of it But the | resint war i artakes largely of the character of a war of opinion Aud it is appro icluue ii it has not entered a critical stage Heretofore the Republic ins h ive conducted the war much as the Democrats might have eon ducted it But us the term fixed for execution of Mr Lincoln s pioolamatioiidrawBnear the [orlod ol neutrality is passing away It w ouid surolv huve been an act of

was intended was evinced by the fact that General Halieck had ordered all officers of the army oí the Potomac to join their regiments within twenty four hours, undei pain of dismissal As a v Ictory of
