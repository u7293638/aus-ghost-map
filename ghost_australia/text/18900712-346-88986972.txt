A GHOST STORY. 0;-v hostess told us how onco tlic liouse j vi.s ovuifult oji Mie occasion of a wedding, and how s!\a had to put it couple of girls in the ghost room, thinking there would, at all events, bo safety in numbers, and one would protect the other during the short hours of the August night. "I shall never forget the girls when they came into our room, '' said she, laughing, " for they tore in in the middle of the night, and told us they j had heard a succession of s'nots in the next | room, followed by the falling of heavy drops of blood on the lloor. I must say I felt a ! little squeamish myself ; but Tom got up, , and he and I went in, and, sure enough, we j heard tiio blood dropping too. It was a , very still night, with the harvest moon just over ' the house yonder, and it shone in, so we j didn't want any candles ; and as we stood I listening it had rather a gruesome sound ; i but all at once Tom said, ' There's naught but your jam closet there, missus ; there's no room for either pistols or blood,' and in a moment I knew what it was. I'd been bott ling gooseberries some weeks ago, and put 'em in there out of the way, and the horrid things had fermented, or something, and gone on working, until they had popped out the corks, and tho blood was my i ice red ripe gnoseborry juice falling down on tho | shelves, and creeping out underneath ; for ! there ! I'd forgotten the best part of the story, which was that the girls wouldn't call us until they saw the blood actually coming info the room—a sight they showed us naturally enough when we came in with 'em. 1 can tell you they were laughed at, and tlu y don't like being offered ripe goose berry tart even now % If you'll come with me i can show you exactly where the ghost was."—" Bypaths and Crossroads," by J.
