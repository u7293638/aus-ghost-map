? WELL, this is a nice way to talk about Royalty, anyhow. The Berlin Pod says it was abandoned. A QUEENSLAND telegram thus, "The elections are in full swig." And we believe it, even thougl they did leave the " n" out. A YOUNG fellow employed in one of our Mel bourne olliccs was lately sent out on a message to Heidelberg by train. He was so long going that he entirely forgot what he was sent for. He is coming back to find out. He's not back yet. "£4000 was offered me to sell the race,' says Hanlan, referring to the late contest with Kemp, and as the plucky Canadian's dealings ha\ T e always been " fair and square" no one doubts the assertion for one moment. Hanlan might strain a point in this instance and go a little further by giving the name of the generous gentleman. THE rain was falling fast the other evening and no little amusemeut was offered passengers by a Brunswick tram on reaching the Bourke-street points. The signalman, it appears, aid not exactly relish " a wet," at least outside, and so instead of taking up his stand in the centre of the blocks made a dive for a friendly verandah hard by, from which point of vantage he waved the hand-lamp. The gripman (fortunately for the other) was unable to leave the dummy, or the probabilities are that he'd have given the pointsman a tongue-banging that he wouldn't have got over by knock-off time. " I can't see yer. Ware's the berloomin' light ?" gurgled the inufiled-and-buttoned-up gripman, " can't yer cum out to yer proper place ?" And at length the other "cummed." Though it was amusing while it lasted, we do not envy the tram pointsman, who is compelled to " do the block " in a pelting rain and when the wind is howling wild. We would suggest to the Tramway Company that all the pointsmen in their employ be supplied with a handsomely finished boudoir set up in the main thoroughfares, also a few luxuries in the shape of a couple of bottles of brandy or whiskey, two pairs of Berlin wool-worked slippers, a gas stove, cooking apparatus, telephone and a boy to go out and wave the signal- lamps. We know that we have merely to mention the matter when Mr. Clapp will see that the pointsman's grievance will be instantly remedied. If said pointsman happens be of the mashing fraternity, his boy can carry messages to and fro to the girl, or in case of emergency look to the lines while the other takes tlie young lady to see " Alone in London." " TELEMACHUS" says there is nothing great about our river. But there is ; there is a thundering great stench. WE are always seeing in the dailies this phrase ; — "The bank returns." Where has it been, and from whence does it return ? CROYDON, Queensland would appear to hit the taste of the Chinese to a nicety. A short time back several members of the local police made a raid on a few of the very numerous gambling dens. The Mongolians, not caring about their coming uninvited, set upon and savagely attacked them. After a severe tussle, the police muzzled eight of the principal heathens and ran them in. On confronting the Bench on the following morning, the worthy M.l\ dealt out justice all round in the shape of a two pounds fine—what next ? THERE is a movement in Fitzroy to prosecute the agitation for securing a direct line of railway through Fitzroy. What on earth have Fitzroy people done now to deserve this ? A MATRIMONIAL item comes from England, in which a Mr. Smith took unto himself a bride, and after the wedding and the breakfast the happy couple set out by train for their honeymoon. Now we are not in possession of all the facts of the case, but we do know that Mr. Smith dozed off to sleep in the carriage, for on waking up he discovered a message from his fond and. loving wife pinned to his coat tail. It was short and to the point (not the coat tail, the slip of paper), and read thus:—" Tired of matrimony; had enough of it, and gone home to ma.—Mary." LUK W OT, a Chinaman, has won five hundred pouuds on a lottery ticket in Ballarat. Wot luk ! AT the Heidelberg railway spread, given in honour of the opening of the line, Mr. Cameron, M.L.A., in the course of a little speech, pointed out to all present at least one advantage to be gained. Be stated that he "missed the train at Spencer-street, returned to town to get his buggy, and was astonished at arriving in Heidelberg fifteen minutes before the train." MR. WORFOLK is the name of the Lilydale undertaker, and yet there were folk a short time back who said they hailed from " the dale," and let in no less than five Melbourne and suburban undertakers. The local remover was let religiously alone. Mr. Worfolk is in luck. A BRISBANE Chinaman, with £40,000 liabilities. shue pinches. George Sbue, has failed Now we know where the SPEAKING of the land boom, it is said that we are " gaining ground." That's so. A PRETTY good yarn comes from that heavenly spot designated Dubbo. It seems that in common with all other places at present the silver mining craze has penetrated the wilds of Dubbo, etc., and every farmer round about owns about nine or teu. The chief character in this little item is a Glen Innes man. lie is said to be rolling in riches, and at the same time i esidents round about claim him as a skinflint. Two prospectors had the luck to run against him recently, when they were engaged on a not over-successful expedition. They were making their way to town to sell the result of their joint efforts, about an ounce of gold. On reaching the gate of the person alluded to, they found they'd run short of flour. On begging for a little they were met by a rough refusal What did they do ? Use up all the choice language not,found in a dictionary ? No, siree, they were Colonial young men ; and, pitching their tent, set to work digging away as joyfully as the grave-diggers in " Hamlet." when they commenced panning and washing with feverish haste, as though they'd struck a Golconda. The flour refuser, on seeing them, had his cariosity aroused, and proceeded to stop them. telliDg them that he would not, on any account, have the ground ploughed up in such a fashion. The prospectors, laving previously sprinkled a few grains of gold into the dish, showed it to him, and, bringing to light their miners' rights, informed him that they intended to, as they poetically put it, " dig like ." Skinflint, not liking to lose a good thing, struck a bargain, and supplied them with a complete fit-up each, and twenty pounds in solid cash to vacate the ground. This they did with seeming reluctance. {Prospectors in future going along that way will find it just as well to carry clubs.) SPECIAL instructions are given the police to comel all people riding and driving horses to " walk ver the crossings," and as far as tramcars are oncerned it is at those identical crossings that hey dash around the corners at a greater Bpeed han ever. A MAN who was arrested yesterday in Sydney for eing drunk and disorderly had several secret ockets sewed up in his clothes filled with new overeigns. Need we add that he was a married an on his way home ? 'ORACE 'ARRIS, a gentleman who some time back was bossed by Mortimer Franklyn, Esq., when the latter ran the World, has now blossomed into a full-fledged Croydon (Queensland) Justice of the Peace. His game clings to him like a leech, as witness the Figaro—" The editor of the Croydon Miner is evidently of that school of politicians, happily few in number, who hold that when facts do not suit their particular views the best thing to do is quietly to alter the facts to suit those views. According to the Croydon Miner's report of Saturday evening's meeting, the only event worth recording was that three hearty cheers were given for Griffith. The Miner reporter was the only person out of some five hundred present who heard those hiarly cheers. Probably Mr. Harris' ears were so stunned by the hooting and hissing with which he was received, and which compelled him to retire without having uttered more than two words, that he was not in a fit state to hear or report anything correctly. Some latitude is usually allowed in political reporting, but it is seldom such a glaring misstatement of facts as the one in the Croydon Miner of Wednesday last is to be met with in any respectable journal." IT was in South Yarra, and she had been rhapsodising about Browning for nearly an hour to her best young man, and as Bhe sat there in the flickering firelight shading her eyes with one shapely hand, he thought he had never seen a fairer picture. She was was about to go on, when her little brother opened the door. " Penelope," gurgled he, " carn't I hev some 'er that cold plum puddin' you put away to eat after Mr. Jenkins goes hum ?" TOUCHING the Goulburn Protection Union, Mr. Rose invites Mr. Reid to a debate. Opinions are about evenly divided, some depending on the rose, while others cling to the reed. SLOGGER SULLIVAN is doing things in the most bare-faced manner. He now wears a clean shave, having removed his dainty moustache. It's only people who are bad looking who wear moustaches, don't-cher-know, because it hides portion of their bad faces. THE Trickett-Hanlan match will come off after all. The American knows a -trickett two yet. THE Age, whose circulation is, but no matter, says :—" The Queen has gone lame, and it is unlikely that she will Jigure in the Birthday meeting." Her Gracious Majesty gone lame, eh? What's on foot in England now, we wonder? And just at birthday festivities too—dear, dear. Well, while greatly regretting to hear that such is the case, we think it is hardly the thing for the Age to print this item of news under the heading of " Sporting Intelligence." THE playful solicitors of Ballarat are at it. The other day tlie local justices were investigating a dressmaking case. The gentleman who appeared for the plaintiff suggested that the defendant, who objected to pay for the dress, should settle the question by trying it on in court. She declined. THE late prize fight between Jack Burke and Peter Newton proved a perfect daisy. Of course before the affair there was a gentle flutter of excitement, and speculation was rife as to whether it would be genuine or not. It was genuine, we have this from Peter, and—well, he ought to know. The onlookers, and goodness knows there were plenty of them, are, however, just a little puzzled over the affair. At such hurricane speed did Jack Burke conduct affairs, that they, even when they saw Peter "put to sleep," were actually in the dark as to what had taken place, and they wanted them to go on with the fight, not believing that the thing had been fought to a finish. Burke may well be called a record breaker, and should be worth his weight in gold as a newspaper editor. BURKE, the " Irish Lad," if he intends visiting the frontispiece at all in the coming Slavin contest, will act wisely in taking a ladder into the ring. FROM a N.S. W. paper :—" Mr. (&f.P.;) was closely buttoned up as usual, and therefore it was impossible to tell whether he had a clean shirt— or, indeed, any shirt at all. The inference, however, was that he did not possess such a garment. He had, however, a pair of 16s. 6d. trousers (made to measure), but they rested on boots that had evidently seen better days." Fame this — in lumps. MR. SERVICE says that " the Government is the best possible Government in Victoria at present. " Correct, and that doesn't say much, mind you. MUDD is the name of the gentleman who superintends the cleansing of the water supply, Ballarat. He is the right man in the right place, BISMARCK was 74 years of age on the 1st of April. People can scarcely credit that the level-headedbis-y body was born on All Fools' day. MR. HAWTHORNE, M.L.A (N.S. W.), is 0f opinion that there is a splendid field in the country for the labours of missionaries. "We second the motion, and they might as well open up at once in the Parliament House. A MELBOURNE management is going in. They've gone in. (In-solvent.) A YOUNG man, a resident of Nhill, recently visited Melbourne. That he was not particularly struck with the Queen City of the South may be judged. from the joyous fact that he became suddenly seized with aa irresistible idea to get out of it as cheaply as possible, though at express speed. With this end in view, he drank his own health—in poison. Up to the time of our going to press no local undertaker had received auy order concerning an{h)ill man. By the side of the wanted-to-be- deceased was found a piece of paper, on which was written, " Not attemptnl uicide Vv. been poisoned at Nhill." What foolish eople we do meet in this world, to-be-sure. Did e dread an inquest ? Surely not. Our coroner is ot particularly hard to please, and the mere fact f his having once resided at Nhill would have ufficed. Oh, dear ! it's an Nhill wind, etc. A BAND of young gentlemen doing business under the style of "The Waterloo Push " have what is known " put their foot in it," the firm having come togrief, thanks to that handy-even-though-at-timespeculiar article known as the Law. From what we can gather they had been engaged in an " entertainment " got up to provide sympathetic contributions (otiwds a comrade in gaol. Emerging from this assemblage they demanded drink at " the little pub. around the corner," and being served refused to pay. The constable who was called upon by the publican WBS set upon by the young desperadoes in a body, stoned, knocked down, and when helplessly at their mercy, battered, kicked and clogdanced upon, with a reckless disregard of consequences, which must have resulted in his murder but for the plucky interposit ion of a passerby named Beare, who proved an efficient substitute for the over-prudent publican, who had at the outset run away to procure assistance—to remove the corpse presumably. Thus were they disturbed in the middle of their Jubilee jollification, which, finishing somewhat abruptly, has been postponed for eight years, owing to unforeseen circumstances, caused through the incarceration of the' firms principal. THAT mesmeric marvel, Monsieur Victor, broke a bone in his right hand, and strained the sinews of the same, a few nights since at Adelaide. He was giving an exhibition of his powers in the Town Hall, and while endeavouring to prevent one of his subjects from falling over the platform, was pushed off himself, and fell on his right arm, receiving tlie damage before-mentioned. From which it will he innocently observed that Vic. in giving his seaiice>> makes no bones about it. PETER KEMP'S from all oarsmen exempt, To defeat him there's none'll attempt; Trot out Teemers and Bosses, They'll all swell your losses, For their chances look somewhat un-kemp-t. SOMETHING OF A BORE.—The Secretaty of Mines would seem to have a gay time of it just now. The other day he received the following valuable docu ment:—" I have a very great favour to ask from you. Hope you will be kind enough to grant it. i have a brother with me—a new chum. When lie stands on ground where there is gold he receives violent shocks in some plaoes ; in others, the shocks are not so severe. Now, what I want from you is to test his gifts. You have men at work in Gobur; will you autho ise them to sink where my brother is affected, and not where there is nothing ? If my brother's idea is correct, you could then employ him at a less cost than boring rods. If you ate acquainted with he can explain to you how he isaffecjted. I tease my brother by telling hiin of a clergyman that was the same whenever he trod on a grave. • Do please try him; there will be no expense attached to his first trial. All I want from you is to authorise the men in Gobur to sink a shaft down where Mr. says there is gold, or thinks so. I must now ask ten thousand pardons fcrwhatl have taken upon myself to do." That this party's brother is a" bore " there is not the slightest question, but it does seem a bit paradoxical to "sink where my brother is affected, and not where there is nothing," for his brother evidently is affected in the cranium. How shocking PLAIN Bill Beach, the retired champion oarsman, must be a bit of a lad in his own quiet way. He says : " So sure was I that Kemp would win the race that I sent my wife a telegram four hours before the start, saying that he'd won." Jiravyo, Bill! Now all along we have been plumping for Kemp, and plan king every solitary copper on Peter; but knowing now that Beach forwarded the above message home, our thoughts fondly turn to Hanlan, We ao wish Ned had won. What a picture for a painter it would make, eh 1 Beach, the retired champion at home, sneaking over the back fence, and slipping noiselessly to bunk, while Mrs. B. is on guard behind the front door with an uplifted club, the latter humming " Still so Gently Oar Me Stealing." Yes, the Beach message might have proved an awkward Jiilly-do. AN enterprising resident of Heidelberg is about to run iu opposition to the newly-started railway. As he intends making speed the main study, he will run bullock teams, and sheuld have the warm support of the general public, as, on the lines the Heidelberg train are at present run, the <-tcam roller, so to speak, " knocks the staffing out of it." THERE is a sham spectre making night hideous out at Moonee Ponds just now, and some young men of the place are said to have formed themselves into a vigilance committee for the purpose of " laying it." Should thiB not read, " laying for it" ? We are not, as a general thing, particularly partial to ghosts, genuine or otherwise, Btill we think those young men might be going a trifle too far if they made this sham a reality. Suppose they made it half a ghost.
