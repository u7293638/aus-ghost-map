UEWS ROM THE PACIFSG A HUGE 1IUAL WAVE. MASSACRES .BY ISLANDERS. , (By Telegraph.^ ? (From Our Own Correspondent.) _ _ . . Sydney, May 5. liie steamer Archer, belonging to the Pacific Islands Company, has returned to Sydney after an extended i cruise in the^ South Seas. Besides the Gilbert, Elliott, and Marshall groups she visited New Britain, New Ireland, and numerous other scattered islands. She reports some sensational news from the Marshall Islands. A tidal wave lately swept over several of the islands doing considerable damage, and its effects were felt in the Gilbert and Ellice groups. In New Ireland and at Nukufakau it caused great harm as well. At Jaluit,- in the Marshall Islands, a German trading schooner came to port from the Carolines and reported that the tidal wave had extended there, causing great loss of life. One of that group was entirely swept and there must have been several hundred livea lost. Cap-', tain Hetzfelt, of a German schooner in the vicinity, succeeded in rescuing some natives. One island, he stated, was completely washed away. Several massacres are reported from the Bismarck archipelago. At New Ireland a trader named Petergon in formed Captain Henry, of the Archer, that he had sent two boats down the coast in February. They had reached the trading grounds and anchored for the night. Whilsb they were asleep some natives put off in war canoes, captured the boats and massacred the crews. The boats were manned by 11 natives, whose bodies were taken ashore, while the boats were destroyed. At New Britain some months ago the little trading ,ketch Sea Ghost was captured at Nusa by natives, and the whole crew was: massacred. One of the murderers was recency captured at New Britain, tried, sentenced to death and shot.x A few days before the Archer left the German warship Moewe had started out from New Britain for Nusa on a punitive expedition in connection with this same massacre. There was again a good attendance last evening at the show located opposite to the Commercial Hotel, Hannan-street, and con trolled by Signor Antonio. Those who paid for admission into the marquee last evening did not fail to expresg appreciation of the doings of the remarkably trained beasts and birds, which are the prime attraction, as well as of the ventriloquial displays and the marionette performances. There will be a matinee performance at 3 p.m. to-day, and a change of performance is promised for the evening.
