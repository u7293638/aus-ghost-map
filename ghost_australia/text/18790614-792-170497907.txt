The Bishop delivered, on Sunday evening, after Vespers, a striking discourse from the Gospel of the festival of Trinity Sunday. " Going, therefore, teach ye all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." His Lordship dwelt at some length on the Jubilee granted by our Holy Father to the faithful. The Bishop announced that a mission would commence in the pro- Cathedral on the first Sunday of July next (6th), and terminate on the 20th. This was intended to help the faithful to comply with the conditions of the Jubilee. Rosary, Sermon, and Benediction of the Most Holy Sacrament will be given during the forthcoming mission. THE BISHOP AT WOODSTOCK. On last Sunday, 8th June, his Loidship celebrated Mass and preached to a large congregtion at Woodstock. A CHEERING PROSPECT. It must be exceedingly gratifying to Catholics to observe the unmistakable reaction that is fast taking place among Protestants, the public, and liberal Catholics on the absorbing question of education. It iB my pleasing duty to notice the withdrawal of the few Catholic children who have been attending State schools. Relief from the education persecution cannot be far distant.
