PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE' RABBIT PEST. The Stock Department has . received over 100 applications for the positions of rabbit inspectors in the Eyre dis trict, and announce that as good selec tions can be maiie from this number no one else need apply. An English exchange remarks tbat there are many gems in Mr Ganett's collection of schoolboy mistakes, which he has well named 'Chips from my Blockheads.' Some of the, errors are due to associations of ideas that would, only occur to schoolboys. Thus, ' Samson killed the Philistines wi.th the pillows' at once suggests the hero of a. . mighty bolster fight ; while the unconscious humor of the statement that the ' descen dants of Noah became very humorous' justi fies itself. The mind alonce pictures Shern,. Ham, and Japhct making fuuny xemarks about' the Ark and its curious assortment of passengers. The schooiboy, again* who 'as- serts that ' Cycling makes the road, danger ous for Presbyteriauy,' and the other who describes Jehu as 'one of the most wicked and pious kings of Israel,' -were uncon sciously making most pregnant epigrams* . 'The Wickedness of the Pious' would, in, deedj make an excellent historical essay-'- and it would be a lonft one, [Advt.] to the editor of the kalgoorlie miner. StB.-iWhen they saw I meant biz. Western & Kiddle evidently concluded to remain silent. Hy deposit has remained in the hands of the Editor for over two months without any i esponse, and as ifc is still likely to remain so I conclude there are no prospects of a niitch and declare my challenge off, and will take no further notice of false i amors circulated by jealous teamsters, and remain driver of the team that drew the IS-ton load without a pull. — I am, etc.. , T. S. McGUIRE. P.S. — Since the above accomplishment the 1 same team .has brought 11 tons 3cwt from -tke other side of White Feather, and as it ? was'brought through the bush I, with otheis, ? consider it the most meritorious pull done by a team on the goldfield. Ka'cooilip November 29. Three figures In Shrouds Probably few persons would be suffi ciently strong-minded 'to pass a solitary alight in a room said to be haunted without experiencing t some disagreeable nerve shocks'. Lady Burton tells a story ol a friend of hers (Winwood Keade, the author), avIio put this fact,, to the test. Keade ?was a man of strong ' nerve and un doubted courage, ' so brave that he could heard 'to tell this story,' is Lady Burton's comment. ? ' \- While travelling, either, in Africa or India (Lady Burton is uncertain about \- 'the exact locality), Eeade was told that a certain * bungalow was , uninhabitable, as it was haunted *by the ghosts of three, surgeons who had died there of cholera, ? and who, each midnight, entered one of the rooms (which had glass doors open ing out into the compound), arrayed in their winding sheets. 'Wishing' to test the truth cf this story, the author took up his abode in the haunted room one night, armed with a gun and plenty of lights and books. His native servant 'absolutely refused to enter the bungalow with him, .but consented to remain outside on the roof, also armed with a gun. Reade occupied himself with his books, jaid all was quiet until 'the stroke of ?twelve, when, -'with a loud noise, the glass flew' open',- and three figures; in white shrouds, stepped into' the room.' On',, Lady Burton's inquiring if -the ?} -spectator Had tested 'if 1 the apparitions \- Avere practical jokers of supernatural ' Tisitors, 'Reade candidly replied: ''To '\ -'tell you the -truth, „ I fainted dead off, .-/and dropped my gun ; and, as soon as ' -\ I- came to myself, Lcalled-the boy down 'from the ' roof, and made off as fast as I ^oiild.'— Globe.
