m m w SOUTH AFRICA. m (ibom our own cobbespondent). Since writing you last Miss E. Chambers and Mr. A.. Marsh have left, and arrived in . London, and. wTill, I expect, shortly leave - for South Africa again with their new company. ' The members of her .late company joined Mr. A. R. Thorne, whose success was not great, so much so the ghost didn't walk. , Messrs. Bernard, Salwyn, and Vincent have joined Ben. Wheeler, and opened a few nights -ago in Durban. The Miss Be van's, I hear, will do the small towns with Mr. Thorne. . It's a pity these ladies didn't return to Australia when Miss E. Chambers season had finished.: What the end will be of the company it's hard tp say, and where their .graveyard will be " theatrically" I mean remains to be seen. Bogus managers must fall in South Africa. Ben. Wheeler is as fresh as ever. Frank is a clever comedian, and they can always do good biz. Ben. pays his way everywhere, and gets the esteem of everybody, company and otherwise. Perkins' Opera Company still hangs on, while Verdi is doing good biz. in Pretoria. The Miss Albu's leave in a few days, about the 15th, for Sydney, where they will open. They are very clever artists, and indeed it may be said Miss Julie is the " English Nightingale." Ta, ta, more in my next. ' ' . ' Mr. Haddon Chambers' play " The Idler " lias been performed 50 times already, at the Lyceum Theatre, New York, and is still running strongly. Miss Lilian Russell, the comic opeva prima donna , has been offered 1000 dollars to sing the chief part in " La Cigale" at the New Garden Theatre, New York, during the winter.
