Sir Geoffrey Trovothon," she sald, her volco cool and silvery, " if you have decoyed mehore.for the purpose of frightening me into a marriage with your son, rest assured you have had your trouble for nothing. As I told you in the beginning, I tell you now, I will not marry him. I will dii here where I stand rather than speak the words that will make me his wife. "And you, sir," she added, clenching her white hand and setting her teeth, "only let me regain my freedom, and you shall pay dearly for all this." The baronet laughed softly. "ltegaln your freedom, my dear," he re. peated. " My dear Lenore, you are not at all likely to be free for some time to come unless you pay tho required price for your liberty. Listen to ome, Miss Trevethon. \Ve have no time for theatricala. The night is pessing away, and we must get out of this old ghost-trap and be on our road to Paris beforo the lday dawns. So listen to reason now, liken sensibleo girl. As I told you be fore, it Is not likely that that I shall relin quish the hopes of a life time, and see my son cut off from his rightful inheritance, all be. cause of an idle whim on your part. You are Richmond's wife as it is. You were married to him, at your father's wish, in your childhood, and you are commalnd.d by your father's nlast will to hold that marriage Bn. cred," She laughed in hirs very face, in superb and 'carless scorn, "I repudiate that silly ceremony of my youth," she exclaimed ; " and you will find it a little dificult to force rle to submit to your wishes." The baronet's smiling face had changed in a fearful manner. It was livid with stIup pressed passion, and his eyesglared like those ,f a wild beast. 'VWe'll see I" he answered, in a low, threatonlng voice. S' 'l'h clergyman there, nird the woman who is to act os witness, are ,oth mine, sworln to ley service. You marry uy son and to- morrow's lawnl will see you on, your way to Ioullle, and to-morrow's papers vill announce tihe lliauce." " But if I refuse, as I do, Sir IGeoffrey, lhat then ?" Interruptled her fearless voice. " What then 1 Listen, 3iss Trevethon, ilad you slhnll hear. If you refuse, thle Celc. nomy will proceed all the Same' ml hlue wit. :es..I will sin thie certtileate.

"1 say nothing, only what I have already said, Sir Geoffrey," was her quiet answer. Tihe baronet chuckled incredulously. "A life Io luxury enid pleasvre, as my son's wife, is certainly i preferable to being bllriedl alive, my dear, and you are too sensible a girl to waste anl instant in deciding between the two.
