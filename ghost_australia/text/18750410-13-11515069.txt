?THE, GRAND OPERA IN PARIS {PBOH AN OCCASIONAL OOBREaPONDENT.) PARIS, FEB. 19. The public excitement and interest aroused by the completion and opening of the Grand Opera-that great project of the Empire which haa come to bo adopted by the Re public as a special ílluatration of ita own grandeur by a apocioa of logic peculiar to the vainglorious Trench nation-waa at ita height when I visited tho vast structure a fortnight ago Wonderful stonea respecting thenurabor of nighta for which evory placo in tho house waa engaged were in circula tion and the impoaaibility of obtaining per mission to make a tour of inBpection of the vast building either in tho daytime or during the cntr actes of a representation waa strongly lmpresaed upon me I did not however despair for I had as the French aay powerful protectiona and I betook myself at once for advice assistance and author.tie n formation to a colobrated lady with whoBO name your readers aro doubtless familiar for the Baronesa Blaze do Bury ia aa well known through the writings of the first i Itératcurs of the day as she ia through her own both in Tnghsh and French and to her husband Baron Henri the palm of musical criticism ia unanimously awarded lhe beBt music given in all Paris is to be heard in the salon of tho Baronne and the leading artista there do congregate m common with tho llluatrationB of every branch of science literature and politics Unai palled by the difficulties with which I waa threatened I reaorted to the Baronne and the re8ult of my well placed confidence was a place m one of the beat boxes on the grand tier aa wo should call it -the premier ¿tage OB it is called hore-at a splendid representation when tout Paris assisted and a special order from M Halan zier the director-who must I imagine bo quite the busiest and most harassed man m Pans at the preaent time-that I and my friends should be conducted through the foyers the coulisses the couloirs in fact and emphatically partout I had already closely examined the exterior of the Grand Opera and formed an estimate of it from which though much decried I find it impossible to depart To my taste it ia heavy incongruous and unsatisfactory Its vaat size and the magnificence of the materials used in ita construction lend it an imi ortance a part and claim admiration and wonder for tho8o two qualities-apace and wealth But the gorgeoua edifice standa upon a flat square for which it is too big and too heavy and with one s firat glance at it cornea the im pression it must have been intended for the top of a hilL Tina produces a senBe of discomfort wl ich ia destined to increase as one examines the orna mentation so ponderous so intricate and so misplaced the mosses of heavy pillara supporting lampa not low enough for convenience not elevated enough for ele ginee the g eat staring gilded groups which thrust themselves up from the roof into the aky breaking the linea of the building and fatiguing the eye of the apectator the marble groupa which are spoiled m their ensemble by the introduction of Larpeaux a indecent and ugly "Danse" -a reproduction to frighten one from Terpsichorean revels for ever by its drunken unpleasantness apart from every constderation of morality and taste-and its external pillara copied from the piazza of St Mark which I cannot but regard as a serious blunder in art That the piazza in the sea board city Queen of the Adriatic should bear the device of the divided gondola is fitting as fitting as that the state carriage of the sove reign in old times should be represented by the bucentaur in which the doge went to his wedding with the beautiful sea but that a theatre in the heart of an inland capital with no maritime associations should be decorated with pillars hearing the device of the ship of the state appears to mo a taste less absurdity The weight of the entire structure is oppressive the olia podrida of the architecture m which one finds no rest no point d appui the rows of busts and entabla tures in metal and in marble the contrasting colours and materials of the balconies the loggie which might be thoae of a club house the topmost balustrade which might he that of a substantial bridge One feels angry with one s self for seeing these things so clearly for feeling them so forcibly that tiley spoil ones pleasure in the completed spectacle but they are irresistible and be fore one ascends tho heavy external stair case and entera tho building under the vast i ortico one ia diaenchanted of all but the consciousness of tho riotous fancy the undisciplined profusion and tho gigantic cost represented by the Grand Opera With tho first glance of tho interior ono ig fairly dialed and it takes some time before one can distinguish details in tho immense »Pace -unid the gorgeous mingling of marbles i recious atones and metals spion did

arms diamonds "litter the crowd-which is no crowd in the vastness where trains lie securely their full length ui on tho soft velvet of the crimson carpets and every figure is reflected in mirrors of extraordinary height framed in hangings of superb satin damask on ita way to the corridor with its vorlbes of Gobelins tapestry expressly manufactured for tho Grand Opera tho glimpses as one ascended the beautiful circuhr staircase of the superb mosaics which form the ceiling of the peristyle and ot tho masses of gold and carving which decorate the foyer du publique -all thoae bewilder one with their variety and grandeur and make it ímpoasible to regard the ensemble with a critical eye The time to do that is m tho e tr actes after one has thoroughly studied the atage and tho nalle Let me aay at oi ce that both are extremely grand I heard it said that the salle was small in pro portion to the space around it and it may be so but its size and proportions struck mo as being i erfeot as

which hanga from the centro of the root is decidedly desorving of all the admiration it ha8 ro ceived its details are of singular beauty "'d tho _u.rn.enBO number and brilliance of its lights exhibit a happy combination of art with mechanism I am assured that it cost £15 000 and though I do not vouch for th accuracy of the figures thoro is nothing in them to cause surprise when one contem plates this really astonishing object I conclude that there has been a rearrangement of the lights since the "Ouverture" as their in sufficiency was then complained of and on ths occasion of my visit nothing could bo moro luxurious and perfect than the hghtiug of the stage and the salle If it had wen less soft amid all ita profusion it must «ave boen blinding and I waa particularly struck by the beauty and effect of a clrclo of shaded opal globes placed immediately be neath the coiling and supplemonted by a series of lucarnes below them formed by diamonds and oblongs of deeply cut thick glass of various colours through which a soft subdued radiance fell Of the ceiling I shall have to tell when I come to the general subject of tho pictorial decoration of -the Grand Opera I must now refer to the gilded reliefs with which the pillars the galleries tod tho devants de loges uro adornod Theso reliefs as well as the huge mytho '»Bical figures which support the state boxes are all in bright gold on a ground wlucU is not white, but a delicate pearl grey, and | though the general effect is at present too i nell and too glaring, when time shall have toned down the shinu » of the gold some- what, I have no doubt the beauty of them will ho more evident It is not to thoir glitter that I object, it is to their bewildering numbor, their melange, and their moon, gruity If one could fancy a sale by auc- tion of the emblems and effects of the arts, the muses, the graces, and tho gods, one might take the Grand Opera salle de spectacle for the auction room Tho moat hotorOt,o neous emblems are heaped up together, eras arc confounded, allegories aro mixed, classic and Gothic heads appear on tho same pauel.tho accessories of the Olympians aro linked with the "properties"of the modern stage amusical ' trophy ' adorns a panel divided from the next by the fasces of the Roman hctora , a grotesque head grins "underneath a laurel wreath, twined with classic elegance, at a little diatance a golden panther hoad, with expanded mouth, and ears laid back in act to spring gnns from the front of the gallery Everywhere the samo movement, the same riotous fancy, the same profusion-a gaspd läge of gold, and colour, and form I take the same objection to the several parts of the building which I take to it as a whole It suggests the image of a beautiful woman so tastelessly over dressed that one cannot see her beauty for her bedizenment The idea, the pure form, tho central and abiding sentiment of the building one never gets at One pursues it unavail liigly, trying to lose sight and memory of one detail of decoration after another, and to trrive at the fond of the artist's thought, the point of departure of his intention, but it is all m vain , and at last one comes to believe that there is no fond in it, that it is merely a triumph of mngniücent material and boundless expenditure-an audacious monument to the decadence of art " The embodiment of our era the impersonation in marble and gauds of our civilisation, the symbol of our déchéance as a people this great "temple of the arts" was described to me by an eminent Frenchman inclined to take a pessimist view of the situation of France, political and social and who revolted exceedingly against the flourishing eloquence with which its inauguration was greeted, " as though the credit of the nation were redeemed and its future saved by the building of a big playhouse ' But he shares the exaggerated view common to his country men, of whatevor way of thinking they may be, and I cannot blame Paris for being; proud of the revival, of which after all, the Grand Opera is only one though a very prominent, proof Others were afforded when one turned one s attention from the salle to the spectators, and contemplated the wealth and luxury represented by the womens dress This is not always the case, I know, there aro sometimes rather dowdy assistances even at the Grand Opera but my visit foil for tunately, and even in the high and palmy days of the empire, at a state gala I never saw any spectacle more splendid Madame la Maréchale deMacMahon was there arrayed in sapphire blue velvet and Mechlin lace and wearing her famous parure of pearls several of the ladies of the Orleans family-the PnnceBB Czartonski especially conspicuous in her gorgeous diadem of diamonds, which Hashed like a circle of fire every timo she turned her head a number of American ladies, whose beauty was as conspicuous as the splendour of their jewels andadistin guished party of Russians from tho p xibaasy, whose toilettes were quite astonish _i_ One slight fair haired young lady wore c pelisse of rose coloured velvet with tnmn mgs and hanging sleeves of blue fox fur, fastened from the throat to the feot with ela ps two inches wide of diamonds and emeralds and her braided hair wis closely studded with clusters of similar jewels ' The stage is of immense size I thought the scenery very poor indeed, not comparable to that at Covent garden or Drury lane any more than the opera itself was comparable to those we are accustomed to hear It does not do to listen to Madame Bloeb, m the charactor of La Favourite (or La Favourita as they call hei here as the Parisians insist on having the opera sung, in French, very much to the detriment of the performance), after having heard Mademoiselle Tietjens inter- pretet m her unrivalled, indeed unequalled fashion. M. 1 aure sang, as he always sings with much finish and mastery of tho music, but he did not tako the trouble to act the part of the King at all, and the others were not worth mentioning I could not but be surprised at the patience of the audience w ith aporform anco which certainly would not have been tolerated in London, and I felt the truth of a remark which was mado a few days beforo in Le Figaro, t e, that the at traction was entirely due to ' ce grand com- positeur, _T Qarmer To that distinguished orchitect indeed is duo the ' aflluenco to the opera, which calls itself magniloquontly Académie Nationale de Musique Ihe "cur. tain is a very beautiful one, the imitation of rich crimson velvet is perfect, and the painted folds are wonderfully rich and grace ful, but the avañt scene is stiff and common place, and its colour is dull and nihar iiionious In the first enlr acte a couple of polite oui cíala presented themselves to conduct us over the building and on looking down on the man ellous staircase I had imperfectly seen while ascending it, I fully realised its extraordinary richness and beauty. The Hat steps, perfectly easy to ascend, though ttusy sweep and curve so cunningly, aro of the purest white marble the balustrade is of richly wrought metal, its case is adorned with entablatures in many coloured marbles, and the ranope, or handrail, of great width, is of polished seagliola, smooth and shining as glass The Parisians persist in calling it onyx d'Alger, though it bears no resemblance to onyx From the tribunes which jut out over this staircase the coup d a ii is truly won- derful, and the constant movement of a mul- titude without any sense of crowding the endless reflections in the mirrors, the myriad lampB, the gleaming statues, the innumerable touches of colour overhead and around from the marbles beneath from the dresses and tho velvet carpets produce an intoxicating effect which hardly permits one to analyse its constituents The foyer du publique ia as magnificent as thoGilded hall at 1 ontaincbleau, or as the Salle des Marechauo at the 'lurlenes was when that ill fated palace existed It is of immense height, with a vaulted ceiling whereon M Paul Bandry's famous frescoes are displayed , its walls are covered with reliefs in gold, its draperies are of tho richest satin over manufactured in Trance, of an exquisite neutral tint, looped with thick ropes and tassels of gold, its mantelpieces are of precious marble, but again they are cumbrous and heavy and over each window there is a gilded trophy, which breaks the lino.vv Inch would bo harmonious if the so called ornament were not there, and in this case too breaks up the enscmbk, and deprives the eye of a resting point. The peristyle with its vaulted roof o symbolical mosaics, at which the Venetian workmen havo beon labouring for 15 years is entirely beautiful and satisfactory, and one studies it at tho time, and thinks of it afterwards with greater pleasure than that which any other portion of the hugo build- ing affords On ascending the staircase which leads from the first to tho second étage, one is surprised to find that all the grandour of tho effect vanishes, only a wide Hat spaco presents itself, the staircase is of common stone, the balustrade of common cast iron, and the handrail of ordinary painted wood. I had previously observed an equally in- congruous detail in the salle, where the pas- sage between the stalles d'orchestre and the parterre is defined by a clumsy barrier of sturdy timber, no more elegant than the "bar" of a third class refreshment-room at an English railway station. Arrived on the second étage one finds dumpy columns, quite needlessly thick, and disfigured by metal capitals, a heavy ceiling, unpleasantly suggestive of a steamer's saloon, and a series of niches in the wall, with, apparently, polished granite grave-stones inserted into them ; from the centre of each rises a clumsy, dwarfed column, forming the pedestal of a round ordinary lamp. Anything more taste, less or out of place than these "pierres tumularies," as I heard them derisively designated, it would be difficult to imagine. The effect of the third étage is equally heavy and dismal. I didnotgohighor.boinganxious to seo tho coulisses and tho foyer de la dame during the second entr' acte. I now como to the paintings executed by M. Paul Baudry for the foyer, which were exhibited piecemeal at tho Ecole de Beaux Arts last year, where I saw those destined for the foyer de la danse. In the frescoes of the foyer du publique the artist devotes himself to the enchanting art of music ; he shows in its sources, aud dovelopes its history. When we look up at the great central ceiling we rocogniao on one aide the heights of Parnassus, and detect tho artist's intention to represent the divinisation of Poetry,Music,and Beauty by the Greeks. The central figuro is Apollo, who is surrounded by the Graces, the Muses, and the modem im- mortals elevated to this good company by their fame as composers. On the other side, Homer forms the centre of a group of tho poets of antiquity and tho painters and sculptors of the heroic agoa. Over the whole of this aplendid decoration muaic pro aides, for abo occupies the centro,of tho vast ceiling, in a bold and fine design represent- ing the union of melody and harmony, attended by poetry and glory. Commonplace and banales as such compositions scorn to bo in description, I can assure your readers they havo not a tamo or poor effect in reality ; they fit in with the aurroundings, and in this instance they are really well done, unneces. sarily so, perhaps, considering that it is not possible to examine them critically without straining one's neck and one's eyes un. pleasantly, an infliction which has always led me to prefer general effects of colour, Byzantine designs, BO to speak, to more elaborate and artistic efforts in roof paint- ing. In ten large paintings which clothe the sloping sides of the beautiful ceiling, M. Baudry haB developed and at the same time defined his idea. These paintings exhibit the character and the effects of music and dancing. Music triumphs over pain, and soothes madness in the picture of " David ploying before Saul;" and conquers death itself in the dramatic painting of "Orpheus and Eurydice." Tho simple soothing art of the shepherds is expressed in a sceno in- spired by the idylls of Theocritus and the eclogues of Virgil. In "Tho Assault," tho Greek warriors are led to victory by martial music. Sacred art ia repre- sented by the " Dream of Saint Cecilia" ; and the closed eyes and wrapt expression of the Christian virgin form a doubtless in- tentional contrast to the Pagan figures in her vicinity. Saint Cecilia, the vory ideal of a young patrician, liea Bleeping on a terrace of her palace, under a serene starry sky. Angela, surrounded by light, play to her celestial harmoniea. To eBtimate this paint- ing rightly, ono should turn immediately to that which represents the daughter of Herodius. The scene is a magnificent tri- clinium, and Salome, wearing the dress and veil of a courtesan, dances before Herod. Herodias, seated beaide the tetrarch, watches with a bideouB malignant joy his stupid brutal pleasure, and hands a dish to the executioner, that he may " bring her hither the head of John the Baptist." If illuatra tiona such aa theae are to be accounted ad miesihle at all, it ia difficult to believe that they could bo hotter executed. M. Baudry ia certainly a master of drawing, I do not admire his colouring very much, and I regard bia paintinga in the foyer de la dahse as ' detestable, execrable. Illustrations of an art indeed ! Thoy are savage and revolting indecencies, which would lead ono to believe that la danse ÍB a generic name for bru- tality. Surely this is bad art and worse taste. A green-room for the ballet decorated with these hideouB pictures of satyrs, mtenads, and savages, surmounted by a series of portraits oE the celebrated efansew-cs of the last two oenturies, presents a medley which is Bimply vulgar and ridi- culous. The foyer de la dante ia merely a continuation of the stage, and its elastic floor slopes down to a vast sheet of looking-glass, in which the coryphées may contemplate until the moment of their entrance upon the scene, those attitudes, contortions, and feats of strength which they must never leave off practising until | their evening'a taak is done, aa waa explained to mo by the official who conducted mo across the stage to the foyer, where the ballerine were performing, without music, a pantomime which struck me as more meian choly than ridiculous. "You see, thoir muscles muBt not ho pormitted to grow cold," said my guide. There wore tho poor women, withfincongruous wraps over their Btage attire, all dancing desperately, in a busineaa-liko way, and pointing their toes at the velvet covered bars placed there to help them with their entrechats, making a mufllod shuffling, sometimos thumping sound, and without the ghost of tho aot Btage slimo upon their elderly hard-worked faces. Per- fect order, propriety, and, I am bound to say, dull silence reigned "behind tho scenes ;" the houso is too now to bo dirty, the scenery ia too new to be ragged, the ateam apparatus by which the shifting ia done ia intereating, and incomprehensible ; and I was particularly struck with the pro- fusion of crimson satin damask hanging about ovorywhore, to heights whore it ia almoat out of eight, and in places whero it must bo totally useless ; and also with tho number and minntonoss of tho precautions againat fire. The back of the stage and the adjacent portions of the building wore strewn with fire-hose, looking Uko big brown worms, and an army of men wore ranged about the fire- engine, with an army of buckets at their feot ; vvhilo the gas jots, so far as I could see, wero all oucloaod in gla88. Wonderful legends aro current in Paris concerning tho luxury and extravagance of tho dressing-rooms which havo boon fitted up for the leading artists who are oxpectod to appear on tho boards of the Grand Opera ; and I was especially onviod bocauso I was BUppoaed to be about to behold these myateriouB apartments. A boudoir, lined with blue satin capitoimé in silver marguerites, as a delicate allusion to hor impersonation of Faust's victim, had boen, I was told, specially prepared for Madamo Nillsson Bougvaux, and it was held that if any. thing should havo provonted her from catching tho obstinate cold which still keeps her away from tho Graud Opera, it assuredly would havo been that blue and silver 6oi!Íoj»!i(!re of a birdcage for the capri, cious and hard-to- manage songstress. Into tho exiatenco and whereabouta of this deli- cious retreat I sedulously inquired, but found it existed only in tho fortilo fancy of tho Parisian world. I was ahown ono or two vacant drcBaingrooma, which aro airy, of good size, prettily fitted up with the ordi- nary requirements of tho toilet for ladies and gentleraon, and docidodly comfort- able, nut in no way remarkablo: and I was assured that thoae which I had not seen wero identically similar to thoae I had seen. Tho immense space is very impres- sive, and ono little detail which I learned from the concierge conveyed to my mind a striking notion of it, and of the amount of employment which the building affords. The concierge, a cheerful young man, with a cheerful wife, and a little black puppy in which their affections are (I hope tempo, rarily) centred, informed me that a portion of his trust comprised tho charge of a atrong room, hung round with 7,700 hoya ! Tho diatanco to be traveraed by the employés of tho . Grand Opora ia so great, that M. Halanzier has found himself under tho neceBBity of almost doubling his original ataff, and the nightly inspection of tho pro miaea, independent of tho firemen's watch, is quito killing work. . . I left the gorgeous temple of muaic, in which the muBic is the vory last thing ono thinks of, without any wish to visit it often, and fooling obliged, on tho wholo, to endorso the opinions of many artists among my friends who, according it wonder and a cor tain kind of praise, as a " big thing." done boldly, refuse it tho admiration and rever- ence inspired by tnto art, and doline it na " an orgy of gold and colour.
