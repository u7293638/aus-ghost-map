A STRANGE FREAK. Under tliis heading, in Friday's issue of the Argus, the doings of a semi- lunatic named Stone -were referred to. They ?were in connection with an absurd charge of lunacy preferred l>y Stone against an official of the Omnibus Company, and an offer of £1000 made to ~\liss Pomeroy to perform for a month in a play of Stone's writing. .Another of .Stone's freaks which caused trouble and expense to others may he mentioned as a warning to the public. Stone 'recently agreed to purctia.se of Mr Pepper the mechanical appliances for pro ducing the " ghost" illusion. A price was agreed upon, and formal legal docu ment! ivero drawn up. A further sum of £500 was afterwards agreed upon for in cluding New Zealand among the " rights'' to which tiie sale extended. Money pro mises seemed no object with Stone in his dealings with Mr Pepper any more than in those with Miss Pomeroy. When it cam eto the actual payment, however, the solicitor who r.elotl for the parties was startled at hearing from Stone that the forthcoming funds depended upon his getting discounted an acceptance of His Excellency the On .venior for £.'5000. The completion of the matter waited this event, and the next event was a call upon the solicitor by a broker who had been applied to by Stone to undertake iiic in tended discounting business. Surprised at being made a reference in such a mat ter, the whole business was by the man of law explained to the broker, and nothing more has been seen of Stone in connection with it. Mr Pepper is thus left to pay a little bill of costs for thus dealing with a half madman.
