A 'WVsITE ELPF.lANT.-An important person age has lately died at Sinusam in the shape of one of the King's white elephants, and according to custom it was buried winh the highest funeral honours. One hundred Buddhist priests, we are told, olliciated at the ceremony, and the body was conveyed to its. last resting-place accom panied by a procession of thirty State barges. A practical joker attempted to frighten an old sea captain as he was pas-ing through a grave yard, by suddenly rising before him from behind the tombstone in the character of a " sheeted ghost;" but the old salt raised his cane, and gave the apparition a sound cudgelling " for being out of its grave at such an snseasonable hour." A clincher: An old washerwoman once would hang her clothes to dry on the railings of a church; after the repeated prohibitions of the churchwarden, she at last came out with the fol lowing burst of eloquence :-" Lor bless ye, sir, ye wouldn't go and take the bread out of my mouth, would ye ? 'Sides, sir, cleanliness comes next to godliness, parson says." 3Ir. Henry Bessemer, apropos of a discussion with reference to the word 'billion,' has given, in a letter which appeared in The l'iles, various illustrations of what that number means. Thus, assuming that a thousand leaves of paper msight be pressed into the space of three inches, he says that a billion of them would make a pile of 47,8 .i miles high.
