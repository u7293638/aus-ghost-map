"WHAT THE PAPACY EORBIDS TO' ; ; BE. READ. ' This may be -shown either from the" list ( of. prohibited books, : or the list of expurgated-books. . But it: is best to show it from 'the: latter list : for this reason : if we take a passage from i prohibited book, " and say " The Church of Rome 'forbids this," Roman Catholics may fairly say, " The Church forbids' book; but does not say for what particular things she forbids :it ; . andiit ' may.'be that it was hot for. this particular, passage that she: forbid- it, -but-' for some; other ; heretical things contained in it and this might be true enough. But in expurgated books the matter is made plain, because the Index Expurgatorius expressly points out the very passages that are to be blotted out or: altered ; and these are; of course; : the passages: that the i Church :of Rome con- : aiders heretical;: or dangerous" to; faith 1 or morals ; and we, therefore; find here ex-: actly what she condemns.' " <v There is, however; a' difficulty in choos ing the Index Expurgatorius;; 1 For 'while" the Index :Prohibitorius; or list' of for bidden books was alwayspublished freely? to the world, the Index: Expurgatorius' was as carefully concealed:' The 'reason1 is evident." . It . was desirable- that every one should know what books were for bidden ; but when the books of. some great, -man were altered, by cutting out' some passages, and ; changing others to an opposite .meaning, it was not desirable that every one should know that ; it was thought much, better that people should not know that the Church of Rome had found occasion ;to> alter his writings ; hut that they should think they had the real opinions of that great man, when in fact they . only? had;the opinions which the cor rectors permitted him to give, or put into: his mouth for him;; : Hence; the Index . Expurgatorius was carefully kept-' secret. It is true, they had to; print it, in' order that all -those who had to see that books were corrected, might know how to do it-; but all these persons were strictly re quired to keep the printed index quite secret. It, was only by accident that copies were: at first discovered, and it is possible that there are many such lists of expurgated books not yet published or known. "When the first Index Expurgatorius was discovered, this was found on the back of the title page — " By the decree and command of the Duke of Alba, let care be taken that no one, except the king's head printer, should print this Index ; nor that he, nor any other, should publicly or privately sell it, or have it, without permission from the ordinaries" (i.e., the bishops). A diploma of Philip the Second, King of Spain, forbids copies of the Index to be given to any but the examiners of books, who were not to lend, it, nor let any one take a copy of it. Gretzer,- the Jesuit, says, this Index was not made " that it should be read and made common by everybody, but , by those only to whom the duty of correct ing :and expurgating books was com mitted."— rDe jure et More, prohib. libr. pi. 17.., And he asks1 — " What was that Index'.to, other people ?" (p. 11.) How ever, notwithstanding all precautions that ..could be taken,- copies of some lists came to light, and were published ; which we alinll nan 'fpnm fiinA fn ' We can here V give but one- or-rtwo instances : ;We.fake. hs ohr first instance of the things which the Church of Rome wishes to blotout, the Bible 1 of Vatablus. Of course the correctors could not think of blotting. passages, out of the Bible, itself; but they would think notes on the .Bible a fair subject ; and ' the Bible then most used by the learned, was the Bible which had the notes of Yatablus in it. ; We extract the" following account of .this book from the learned Roman Catholic Du'Pin." Yatablus, who was a Roman Catholic, was the most learned, man of his time in the Hebrew lan guage. The French King, Francis I., made choice of him. to be Regius Pro fessor of Hebrew. ' He made so learned .lectures on the Sacred Scriptures that people came from all parts' to hear them. He 'spoke Ins lectures : and' 'did hot 'write them. .'".'His hearete/titeti many ' of liis hot es on 'the .01 d Testament. Robert Stephens, a' famous Printer 'in Paris. aot-: these 1 notes'. c'oliectedi and printed them in al Bible. ' Du Pin say's of these notes'— "These notes ' are, very useful for the understanding ' of hHe .text ; because there are few,diffieult'passages . but what .lie explains in a 'few' words, ac cording. to the mos t natural sense. " IIow- ever," as the printer 'ivas' a Prptestaht, the book got a bad name,' and wash con demned' by, the 'University of Paris', who, as' Du Pin says, " were hot sufficiently acquainted with 'the :Sehrew-;hgue!.'' .However, " the doctors . :of the university of Salainanca ' (in Spain) were1 more favourable to this wprk'(ta6ugh!;Romah . Catholics also), and caused the text and 'the notes of Yatablus' s Bible ' to be ; printed ' in Spain, ' ' with' j/approbatibh. Stephens defended' them again st the ' cen- . sures pf Vthe divines .pf.'Paris, and since that' time they have been almost', generally \- received, .and', approved" of by men' oi learning:" ' : ! ; Such a commentary on the Bible, pi course, attracted paictfiar notice, "and' 'ii is express y mentioned in the 1 3rd of the ' Ten', Rules, drawn1 up' by the committee of the Council" of Trent, and sanctibnOc by' Pope' Pius IV.' But if any notes are1 'circulated' with versions'. of this kind which are permitted,, or with the1 Yulgate , 'edition, suspeotbd' 'pixoes . having been expunged , by .the' faculty: of .'theology of any .Catholic,' university, or : by the generar Inquisition; they (the notes) may '.Be'--' permitted, to 'those persons to whom the1 Versions ,<penmll'';'!«p<bn lwhicli conditions the' whole yolume1 of the Bible'; . whicbl' is !'cbmmohiy, called 'the" Bible 'bf ; Vatablus,1 or - parts' of 1 it, may be, coh- ceded' topibus and1 learned men!" '' '. ? ' Of course 'a1 book which was 'of : such' importance as. to ' be specially mentioned in this rule,' wbuld be corrected with morethanordinarycare.Tt was' accord-? 1 ingly 'cbteebteduby' the ' master' of 1 the' Pope's Palace, who was the person whose duty it was to correct boolcs at Rome. A copy of that Vatican1 -Index has been published, and there we find what correc- tions were thought -necessary. . ; Oh the ,18th chapter of Exodus, Yata-; blus's Bible bad this note — "Moyses , secundum legesDei judicat ives populi;"-i that is— " Moses judges the people ac cording to the laws : of God.''— See. verse: 16\. On this the Index Expurgatorius ; says — '? Deleantur ilia verba" — " let those words be blotted out!" Now, really it is hard to -see what barm there could be in that note. Every one must admit that what the note says, is quite true ; but perhaps, the ' note might - have put -it into some one's head to think, that if Moses in old times . went by the laws of Qoci, the priests ought, to- do so now. In the 26th chapter of Leviticus, the Bible of Yatablus had this note on the margin, or edge of . the page— " Sculptilia prohibet fieri " — " he forbids graven things to be made ;" and on this the Index, says — " deleatur illud" — " let thathe- blotted out!" -Weli;. now, really ; this1 L precaution miglits seem" almost useless '; for the very same hiing is found in1 the1 very first verse of the chapter itself. 'In! the Latin Bible itself, which the Councilj of Trent pronounced authentic, the first verse has this-in!it-k-" Non'facietia vobis idolum'et' Sculp tile "—"you shall- not; make to ; yourselves any idol or graven thing."— Douay translation. ; Now; what great harm was it to -put a, note. .on, the,, edge of ;the page beside, this verse—" -He forbids graven things to be made ?'!

But this was - more than "the, J master of the sacred palace could staud ; so he put his thumb :upon that — " Let that be blotted out." What reason could there bp but:. this,: that if the; note of St.. Steplien. on that, verse 'cif, Isaiah be true,; the; consecrated wafer cannot be the Lord , Jesus , Christ, and tran'substantiation is false ? Now, let: the, reader turn back for a moment to that third rule of the .'Council.' of Trent,, which directed how the notes ill the Bible, of .Yatablus were; to be cor rected— " , Suspected. . . places having , . been expunged:" what was there to suspect in these notes ? What design could- have been suspected in them, except a design to call attention to what is in the word of God? That, then, was the object of " suspicion" at Rome. ' ' We might give many more instances from this book ; but we must he brief. Still we cannot pass by the Index; for the Church of Rome: cor recta the Index of a book too, for fear it should help people to find what is! dangerous to faith or morals. Rule Y. provides expressly ; for this;; and in that Yaticau Index Expurgatorius we . find - the following direction about the 'Index in the Bible of Yatablus : — " In the indexes of these books of the Old and New Testaments, .let the subjoined propositions be blotted out as suspected."
