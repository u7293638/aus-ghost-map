HARRISON AND CLEVELAND. Speculation as to "who "will win the great I Presidential Cup of the United States is livelyâ€” > that is, it is beginning to be. I am not much | interested in the issue, but am amused to see it I frankly admitted that this great people, this model of government by the people, this country wherein every man is as good as every other man and rather better, really is under the thumb, nay, the foot of New York. That great home of Tammany, someone lias called it the of all Europe, controls the elections for presidents of the United States, with their 60,000,000 of people. An interested rag says, and what it says must be taken for what it is worth: "It is of the utmost importance to the Democrats to carry New York. Harrison can be elected with the 36 electoral rotes of New York against him: but these votes, it is very certain, will be cast for the Eepublicau ticket. With the Democrats the situation is different. The loss of New York is tantamount to the final collapse of their party and its candidates. Unless Cleveland carries New York he will not stand a ghost of a chance of election." Happy people, these Americans, but do not envy them.
