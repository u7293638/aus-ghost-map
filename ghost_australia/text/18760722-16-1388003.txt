I ~l"Tl√≠e Six Chinese Companies. The '. yellow agony is fast coming to a head in California The intruding Mongolians have been piling it up just a little too high So the latest intelligence from the other side of the Pacific informs us that the Americans are making a determined stand against the foreign invasion that a strong feeling of alarm his sprung up at the persistency and rapidity with which the Chinese who already number 30,000 in San Francisco alone are working their way into and monopolising all kinds of business and handicraft trades, that the Mongolian flood is still pouring in with ever a pressing volume that consequently, mass meetings of the citizens are being held, anti-Chinese clubs are being formed in every direction, and there is serious trouble ahead " All this promptly confirms the statements made in the article entitled " The China- man Abroad," printed in our columns some short time since But there is more behind Already an appeal has been made to the General Government to stay the plague by summary measures and to this appeal the reply returned was that the existing treaty stipulations between the two countries prevents any such measures being taken , but, in the meantime, a resolution has been offered in Congress by a Californian representative, requesting the President to negotiate for such a modification of the stipulations as will restrict them to commercial purposes alone It may with confidence be predicted that the resolution will be passed unanimously for the Americans are not the people to do things by halves whenever they set about it This decidedly meaningful popular movement has put the Six Chinese Companies on the alert, and their representative in San Francisco has spoken out in a strikingly characteristic address to the American people It pleads, in a tone of blended remonstrance and sarcasm, that it cannot be asserted with truth that Chinese labor in- perishes the country, that the Customs duties paid by the immigrants benefit the revenue, and that if a reciprocal treaty were concluded between the two Governments prohibiting people of either nation from crossing the ocean, the benefit to the Chinese would be that they would remain at home in the enjoyment of complete domestic happiness, and would be exempted from the abuses and insults heaped upon them in the open streets of that so called Christian land . This is very good for Mongolian John, and is another corroboration of Bret Harte's excellent delineation of his character But what are the Six Chinese Companies who thus champion the cause of their countrymen in the foreign land ? The answer to this question is not generally known amongst English speaking people, not even amongst Australian miners, who, one would think, have a very direct personal interest in all that concerns the influx of yellow faces into their special domain When Mr Hepworth Dixon was in San Francisco he made it his business to got all the information he could from the leading Chinese i residents there, touching the manner in which the great Mongol han migration is conducted and the facts be elicited are certainly of a very great trouble kind His principal informant was one Lee Wong, whom he describes as a merchant of high standing and approved integrity, respected alike by Among ins and his own country men The substance of Leo Wong's revelations is as follows -The six companies are, in reality, only five , the sixth being merely a committee of management resident in America, whose business it is to look after the interests of the five companies 'the names of these five companies are are Nmg Young, Kwong Chow, Hop Woo, Sam Yes, and Yang Woo They collect the emigrants in China, carry them on to Hongkong or Canton, make all arrange ments for their transport, and BOO them put on board the mail steamers for California A sixth company, of committee, sits in San Francisco, receives the emigrants on their arrival, and takes care that all their contracts and obligations to the five companies are carried out in collecting the emigrants, the companies' agents travel up and down the provinces, both near the sea and far inland, and act in every respect as most efficient emigration agents "Of course," says Leo Wong, they talk big Melican (Auiciiein) talk big Chinaman, talk bigger than Mclean 'the agents tell their pool fellow count! j men that in Cihfoiiua-or it may be in Queensland the hills are made of silver and the most fun with gold To all candidates for emigre ation they tiller free p cases to the nearest seaport From the moment a man accepts his pass he is taken care of, carried in boat or cut to the point of embarkation, fed and clothed, his passport to the foreign trade press ed for him, his berth seemed, as if let everything is done for him 'the fee for every Cluniiu in from Hongkong or Canton to San Francisco is a J'S, which sum is punctually paid by the companies for each of then fungi units to the Amir it in Pacific Mail Company But upon his 1 Hiding at his destination the mail company refund s J of this amount to the whole Bile exporters of their conditioned By the time a pool Chinaman is 1 sailed on Amei le in for he is a debtor to the five companies to to amount, on an average of MOO He is both their dtbtoraud bondsman until every cent of this money is repaid He is in no sense his own in aster so long as a cent of it remains unpaid The companies take his personal bond for the amount, with compound interest added But, in addition, there is a family bond evicted by that ever property his father or mother, under or brother, may pt SSCHB, is mortgaged to the camp mines in the full amount due from then relative, with running interest at the rate of 24 or 10 per cent added If felt to be no property, the personal bonds of the relatives use given, especially those of the father and grandfather for his ancestors are of the most s lered things a Chinaman em pledge 'the interest chin god on personal securities is five times gre item stating that charged on property "Yot, s and Leo Wong coolly, " the securities seldom fail Of course we run some risk Our man may die worse still, he may fall sick , worse still, he may commit a crime If sent to gaol, his work is lost Again, his bond may turn out bad But every business has a lucky and an unlucky turn." Upon landing in S iu Francisco, the emigrant Mongolian is taken in charge by the Wing Yung committee. He is conveyed to their depot, lodged, fed, clothed, and turned out 'The committee receive his wages, allowing them a small pittance monthly to live upon, until the whole debt has been repaid A few emigrants are well enough off to pay their own passage money ; but even these pay the companies $5 each upon land ing in San Francisco Ullin fee secures for them the privilege of having their bones sent back to their native land, after death, for interment in its sacred soil In no instance is the contract between the five companies and the Pacific Mail Company allowed to be set aside or evaded But how is the strict watch needful to secure full repayment of the debt to the companies main tamed ? Let Leo Wong answer the enquiry He says -' We have our spies and head men of ry where in San Francisco we have many sales It is thought a good thing to be a spy a bad thing to be a ghost A spy serves the Chinese, a ghost serves the Mehe ms By into any of MICHO spies and head men we hear of what is going on in every house We know every must n une, where he is, and what he is about It is our duty to fish out things Even when a in in is dead, we have to find his bones and send them home If not, he would buried and for g Witton like a dog " Without the eel silicate of the coin p nues no American captain will carry a dead Chinaman's bones, and some cap tun H will not carry them at all Do all Mongolians observe the sacred obligation of providing for the sending back of their bones to the native soil " Y es, all good people How and there some '1 free riders, having no regard for their ancestors, cut their pigtails and put on Mehe m clothes Not men, but curs 1 except three dogs, all Chinese (,<> back when they no dead in Aluhei, plenty land, not much people in China plenty people, not much land so Chinaman likes to go in Molles, and go back to Chilli when he died But Lou Wong stoutly denied that the five comp ones exercised the seen t powers of a very large committee or secret society It was stated to him that a report it was burnt out that of two of his countrymen living at Nevada one broke the rules of the < emp ones, and the other i cecil and a hint to kill I am and HO craftily was the crime perpetrated that the assiiBun never WIN traced To this statement the reply was "Who knows! bonus Chinaman good Home had Mehe in law make bad man worse In Hongkong if you kill a man, you will be hung whether you have plenty of money or not Money makes no difference In San iraneiHto, yon kill a man , if you had of plenty money, you got off 1 hut is not good law were, too, all HOT is of secret societies me allowed and ' In China, only bad men enter into Masonic ad. lodges, rogues and rebels who want to change the dynasty and destroy the faith. These secret ] societies are all put down by the mandarins. Here the bad Chinamen start a lodge. We ask the Melicans to put them down. They answer that the law allows Masonic lodges. That bad law. The sixth company has to put them down." Such are the Six Chinese Companies. The facts brought to light respecting them clearly show that in the art of organising, superintend- ing, and controlling emigration, the Mongolian is as superior to the Englishman of the nineteenth century as the latter is superior to him in scientific prowess and moral culture The revenues drawn by the five companies from their poor clients are something enormous, and the leading members of them live at home in a style of Asiatic princely splendour. It is for them primarily that the swarming hordes of pale faces in San Francisco, in the Australian colonies, and in the mining districts of the Malayan archipelago, are mailing and toiling. And their influence at the Court of Pekin is doubtless very great, perhaps even paramount. The problem arising out of the Chinese invasion is therefore a more difficult one for the American people, and for our selves, than at first it seems. There is really serious trouble ahead, trouble which it will require on unusual degree of caution, coolness, and sagacity in both American and Queensland statesmen to surmount.
