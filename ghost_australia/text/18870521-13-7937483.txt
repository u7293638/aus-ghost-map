PICTURESQUE VICTORIA. By TELEMACHUS. CRESWICK. I. Creswick is the other half of the Daylesford district, whose description was attempted in the latest papers under this head—an ancient mining and a modern agricultural district, situate on the head waters of the Loddon river and the railway line from Ballarat to Maryborough. We reach it from Melbourne by way of Ballarat—Geelong and Ballarat Across the Werribee plains, now green and gay with abundant rain. Past Mr John Woods's ridiculous wattle groves. Groves they were to have been, but somehow they have developed into scrub patches. They are wiry and thin, and altogether like strips of mallee, just high enough to shut out the view from the carriage windows, and create in the traveller's mind an abominable sensation of being whirled through a wilderness. An average man, after travelling 200 miles at 20 miles an hour through such groves, would be mad as a man lost three days in the scrub, or an imbecile in the old days after a 20 minutes spin in a lunatic cage. It would, doubtless, be an excellent thing to have timber alongside the railway lines, but it should be grown in 10, 20, or 100 acre blocks, set off at convenient intervals ; and as land is so exceedingly precious in the colony, it would of course be proper to utilise the strips alongside the permanent ways. But not in wattle groves. Lease it to the farmers, let it out to Chinamen, do anything rather than shut out the whole of the railway-carriage views of picturesque Victoria, and condemn us to perpetual vistas of scrub. Dear old Geelong looks sleepy and con- tented as ever in the warm noonlight of a moist May day. The clear waters of Corio Bay lap on the shores almost close beside the railway line : the great sheet of water is still and blue, and bare save one little steamer at anchor, and a couple of fishing boats with sails flapping and gleaming. In many open spaces seen from the train the grass looks soft and green, and the goats browse contented and undis- turbed ; the groves about the churches have become more tall and dense than of old, and in the garden grounds nbout the many de- lightful homes the Australian autumn is turning colour into the English leaves. Only a glimpse at Geelong and back again to the great half circle, or tearfully irregular half- curve of railway line which joins the metro- polis to Ballarat. Over the Moorabool River all too fast, too fast, for down the Moora- bool just now all things seem surpassingly beautiful. The autumn rain and fairly genial sunshine, with the plough of the farmer and the spade of the gardener, have all been working together, painting at a series of pictures which run past like the scenes of a panorama. There are many fine gardens and vineyards down the Moora- bool, and all their leaves seem painted now, yet none to have fallen-apples and plums and pears, yellows and browns and reds, tall pale poplars over all like high priests of autumn, vines with tints innumerable, and black patches of newly stirred soil, beside little paddocks that might have been imported from Ireland. Great gums also by the river banks, suiting themselves to the new order of things, as though they had known no other, and bare green knolls and downs above, with the mountain forests far away. A poorer country when the Moorabool is passed, a wet, waste, boulder- strewn country, with many a skeleton of on old cottage home dotting its dreary surface, with villages beside the railway stations neither prosperous nor beautiful in appear- ance. A country to be hurried over ; to make a man thank God for express trains, or ordinaries with good sleeping corners. What a country it was in the old days, when there was no road, but tracks innumerable, a wilder- ness of track miles in breadth, and thousands and tens of thousands of travel- lers on foot and on horseback, and in vehicles of all sorts and conditions, bogging and jogging and flogging and plung- ing and labouring and sweating and groaning along. A mile away there now is the blue metal road, whereby at last the anguish of travelling was relieved ; and, all vacant and desolate now, there stands the great hotel, where Her Majesty's escort was wont to halt, and "Cabbage-tree Ned," to refresh his team and his passengers. The grass grows over three fourths of the road, an old traveller sits by the closed bar door, and a bewrinkled merino ram looks through the wire fence, and seems, with his curious look, to be asking which is oldest or laziest, you or I? At Lal Lal there is beauty, but not beside the railway line ; iron, also ; we see as much of the iron from the carriage windows as the world of commerce has so far seen of its profitable use. Elaine—we could not, for all we see of you, name you either fair or love- able. But look ahead. Let us awaken ; let us think. There is Warrenheip, there is Buningong, the two giants who have over- looked all the wonder of Ballarat. They see all, they saw all. The black wooded hills, the creek flashing in the dell, the silver eyes of the lakes, and the quaint-shaped sister hills, links of the one great volcanic chain running far out to the sheep lands of the west. They saw the first shaft sunk, the first dish washed, the tremendous, im- petuous attack then on forest hill and valley the riot and tumult of the charge of all the adventurous spirit of the world, the tented array, the labour and the combat, the wild hope, the maddening suc- cess, the killing despair. They marked the birth, they watched the growth, they contem- plate the present magnificence of the great city. Leave them to their contemplation, do you say ; you who have been asking what has all this to do with Creswick? No, we will not, we shall get to Creswick soon enough. I never did and never will hurry past Ballarat. It is the cradle of Australia. Those old con- vict masters and wandering shepherds who preceded the age of gold never discovered or brought to birth the true genius of Australia. Here she sprang ; here- from she invigorated, inspired, endowed us all. He is no true Australian who does not, in Ballarat, find something akin to the Moslem's Mecca sentiment. The train gives us an hour and 10 minutes. Let us go up the street. The spirit of the time was on all early planners and builders of Ballarat. The width of the streets, the solidity and grandeur of the buildings, speak all of high ambition, bold belief. And how the trees have grown in the streets ! And-what is the matter with them? It was 10 years since I had last seen Sturt-street, and, must I confess to a little disappointment? The plantations have grown tall and ragged ; the blue gums have overtopped all other trees, and blue gums are not beautiful. And the statue, it was proper and necessary to take a look at the statue, the marble Burns, which the good folk have erected to their perpetual honour and in- struction. It is a fine statue, and in a wonder- ful situation, but why does it not impress one more ? What is the matter with it? There, at least, is one good reason. It is backed up not by a solid facade or a clump of lustrous evergreens, but by a hideous net-work of telegraph wires. All the wires of the world seem to converge on a great post just behind the statue : you might get a similar effect by setting a little statuette on the rim of a sieve. If a pine tree could be substituted for the telegraph pole it would be very well. A good Scotch pine, a fir whose boughs would harp to a wild south gale and cheer or soothe the poet if he lived in the stone, but he doesn't. It is not quite the Burns we know whose personality is shown forth by the stone. It is not good Scotch work. It is very fine, but slightly finical. When another statue is erected in Ballarat they should not only choose for its making a skilled artificer in stone, but one who can give evidence of a knowledge of the subject to be dlsplayed. They sent to Italy for Burns. I do not think they need go outside Victoria for Moore. But if that were the real Burns, or the ghost of the great singer, the sharp emiter, the interpreter of so many of the sentiments and passions of humanity could cross over seas, or descend through vast air spaces, and take up his abode for a night and a day in that marble image of his old self, what themes should he find for verse down below him. There is the buzz and hum, the clatter and bang of the sharebroking on the Corner. How through the day he might con- jure up all the comedy and tragedy of that business and infamy ! And when the night closed and the stars came out, just think of him calling us of old to the Brigs of Ayr, "Oh Warrenheip ! Oh Buninyong ! '' Out from the two gigantic earth mounds should rise two spectral figures, grey and vast and shadowy. And they should talk together, and the poet should tell us all they said. They might tell other people if they listened, but nobody in Ballarat just now seems to have time to listen to any- thing. All talk of the great mining revival. The whole of the Sebastopol plateau, they say, will turn out to be a gigantic goldfield. All the old leads converge there, and if the water can be kept down all will be worked to great profit, and hope rises in leaps and speculation goes on by bounds, and sometimes falls in the brook and some- times clears it. Every man dreams of riches, and some, doubtless, will realise their dreams. New life will certainly be given to the great inland city. If it could but be done without all the infernal gambling and swindling which attaches to it naturally, ap- parently, as to the business of the turf. Mining used to be manly, heroic in some of its phases. It seems wolfish as bookmaking, foxey as sprint running now. Look at the dozen men who enter the Creswick train. Half of them have the last share lists in their hands, and their eyes as they gaze are only similar to those of men who imagine they know or can find something going through the weights of the Melbourne Cup. It is shadowy with impending eve us we glide out of Ballarat station, for there are grey clouds in the sky which seem inclined rather to close than to disperse, and so the many scars which the digging time wrought on the face of nature are partly veiled or hidden. We see, however, the old leads in places running like long seams of old wounds down the valleys. We know that the gold particles trickled down these on some waters of primeval days, that nature spread her bribe, which was so eagerly grabbed. But it was only a bribe. Just a little inducement to men to come and settle, and work for the truer riches which the well-tilled land would yield. There are many signs of the more wholesome tilth as we bowl along in the dying light, there will be more on the morrow ; we shall see little of Creswick this night, we shall not indeed attempt to see anything. It is one of the foolish things of life to attempt to see anything of any small country town in the night time. The gas that is burned seems only to make darkness more visible. The shops are open and empty ; one marvels why evwrybody does not go to bed, or at least keep inside, and read books or sing songs. I had fully intended to get to bed with all speed, to take one of those long, deep baths of sleep which come as Elysian periods to the journalist of the city, and when in the comfortable American Hotel a room was prepared, with a well-draped bed and a heap of feather pillows and a 'possum rug turned conveniently over the rail, and the ther- mometer down near 40deg, everything seemed exceedingly propitious. But as the devil would have it, there were two and forty footballers round about, who, whether in the house or out of the house, seemed deter- mined to make night hideous with sound. Creswick had been playing Daylesford, and they had not pounded each other into silence through the play. There was plenty of noise left in them, though all the tune seemed knocked out. They were quiet for an hour while they fed, but by 8 they were raging again. Listening and enduring, one could not but think that the world was grow- ing degenerate. Is there not a strong leaven of west country life, of good old Welsh mining and singing blood about all these districts. Welshmen nor West Countrymen ever made such a din as that. What have you done with your voices and your ears, you degenerate sons of melodious sires? Do you know of that good old father (I must confess that I forget his name) who made a boast- " (And I hold it for a valiant thing.) With any three men in Devonshire, Iie vowed that his three sons should slng. There was Dick the tenor, and Jack the main (sing every man in his own place), And Richard, he was the eldest son, And, therefore, he should take the bass." There is no tenor, and no main, and no bass amongst them now. It is all base. And about 9 of the clock the Salvation Army must needs come to their assistance. I dozed at 9 ; I awoke at 10. I had been thinking first and dreaming next of all the old West Country life-of the good ships that went out, and the good songs that were sung, and the gallant deeds done ; and behold we were far out on the Spanish main, and loose sails were hanging in a gale, and spars were falling, and the sides of a great galleon were grinding against our own, and from the dungeon like depth of the galleons hold came a voice, "Simeon Hart, beest that thee ?" and another-"It be, and who be you in the name o' tho Lord." " I be thy sister's son, and come thou down here and take me out of hell." It was nothing, nothing, only a bit of "Westward Ho," mixed up with things of the present, only the last chord ol the footballers jumbled in dreams, the last chord which was soon, thank Heaven, a lost chord far down the street. Then silence and sleep, and in the early morning I went out to look at the town. The sun was just up, the sky about half clouded over, there was a nipping and an eager air abroad, and not much be- sides. The broad streets were almost empty. The bluegum trees planted on either side of the street made a bold show in contrast with the generally white walls of the houses. Here again I must say that the bluegum does not seem to me suitable for street avenues. He is not a gentleman amongst trees. He is not to be compared in summer time with oak or elm, or sycamore or chesnut, and if winter foliage is desired who would choose a gum- tree and neglect a pine ? Nevertheless it must be admitted the bluegums make a goodly show in the long avenues of the Cres- wick streets, and when a considerable eleva- tion is gaincd their foliage robs the landscape of the aspect of barrenness which was not natural, but has resulted from long years of mining. They are said to be healthy also. They exude healing odours. They are the greatest of all water-drinkers, hence fine drainers of swamps. On the near surrounding hills also every stick of mature timber has been long since cut, and the young growth of saplings seem to be of about the same age as the trees in the streets. There is but one building in Creswick really impres- sive in its grandeur. It is the hospital. Set in lightly timbered grounds on the brow of a well wooded hill, it would be taken rather for the residence of the lord of the manor than an eleemosynary institution. Its turrets and towers rise above, its long facade is seen through, the trees. You would certainly expect to see youth and beauty, in all the glory of health and wealth, appear on the balconies, and perhaps feel a little shocked to see instead some poor cripple or yellow cheeked convales- cent hobbling out for a gleam of sun- shine or a breath of fresher air. It must, however, be said here that the hospital at Creswick is not so magnificent when closely approached. It gains in apparent altitude from its peculiar situation. Its interior arrangements, however, are remarkably convenient, its superintendence exceptionally able, and its management good. I like two of the churches of Creswick. They stand on a hill whichh apparently they have named. They enshrine the Anglican and the Roman Catholic faiths. Both are built of the everlasting basalt-one with a square tower, the other with a fairly proportioned spire. Both are well set off with trees, and seem complete, and suited to the requirements of the place : not fragments of gigantic schemes pre- pared In days when a Babylon was ex- pected to grow upon every quartz reef. I like not the Presbyterian Church. It is a hideous thing in red and white. It also is very well covered in with trees, but the artistic eye longs for an extinguisher when its primary colour- ing glares out of the greenwood. Down in the long main street are some fairly good commercial buildings. The town hall, with the inevitable tower ; the fire brigade station, also with a tower, the bank the post-ofhce, some substantial stores. But it seemed to me, in the early morning walk, that the beauty of the place lay chiefly in some little clusters of miners' cottages about the old leads and the long worked shafts. There was a homeliness about them which does something to hallow a landscape-a charm of mingled colour, too, in the dark roots of well- weathered shingles, and the red chimneys taking the place of the tiles of an English village, the autumnal foliage in their gardens, and the blue smoke wreaths ascending through the thin air. Beyond one such group, and a wilderness break of old mining waste, rose the great round head of Spring- hill, smooth and glistening in the morning sunshine as the bald head of a jolly miller, furrowed to the crown with the plough work, though the furrows could not be seen in that distance all rich and fat and loamy-the head of a mountain that would feed a multi- tude, that neither bred or encouraged any feverish digging life, but would support a church and a school and a village commu- nity, with all its necessary adjuncts and ap- pliances, for ever. Many such hills round about.
