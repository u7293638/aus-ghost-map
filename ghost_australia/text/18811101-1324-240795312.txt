PROFESSOR BICE'S THIRD ENTER- TAINMENT. Professor Rice gave his third public performance of mind-reading and exposure of Spiritualism to an appreciative audience at the Mechahcics* Hall. In the first part of the entertainment the Professor astonished both old and young by the wonderful manner in which he discovered articles thought of. He did not make a single failure, and has truly fulfilled the promises he made to prove himself a veritable mina-reader, and not the possessor of a clever trick, even describing a photograph of an unknown gentleman and a sceptic. In his exposure of Spiritualism he was far better than on Thursday evening, and the production of the ghost was so " weird-like" and of such n supernatural appearance that it caused an amount of excitement rarely witnessed within the walls of a hall of entertainment. When we state that whilst the ghost walks the Professor is in fall view of the audience, it becomes most pmzling. His ghostahip was more himself than before, and although he caused more than, one funt, was most affable, permitting anyone who wished to shake hands with him. The ghost is of an uncertain weight, one moment weighing a ton and the next but a pound. It is the facsmUie of Terry's Ghost, now being exhibited in Melbourne. An interesting feature iu the entertainment was the personation by Mr Harry Lemon, son of the late editor of London Punch, of the famous actors, J. L. Toole. R. Phelps, and the German tragedian, Fechter, in which he completely lost his own identity,' aud greatly amused the audience.
