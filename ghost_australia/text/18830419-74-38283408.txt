The idea any that Carlylo was very harsh in his home, and qua that his wife led a very wretched life, is quite are contradicted by Emerson's evidence. He notes Irol in his diary in 1848 that he had booeen staying m for many days with " the Carlyles" at Chelsea. the This is his testimony :-" Carlyle and his wife i live on boeautiful terms. Their ways are very holt engaging, and, in her book.cases, all his books Iene are inscribed to her as they came from year to nun year, each with some significant lines." Pro- cou fossor Norton, the editor, was a near friend of Ker both Carlyle and Emeoron. There are signs 40, already that Professor Tyndall's prophesy will come true, and that the grand true man Goi Carlyle will presently stand forth in his glory culi far above the misunderstandings and cavillings 3,G( which succeeded his death, just-as a grand ir. mountain, as the day wears on, raises its head dou proudly and gloriously.'abov .the. mists which knc in early morn obscured it. .. to r SnRcIOIIAD'S IIMaBELF AGAIN I" . but Which quotation with due apologies may Ire happily be applied alike to 3I r. Oladstone and Pen to Mr. Fawoott. By a curious coincidence both ' a the Premier and the Postmastor.General, after mn absence caused by illness, entered the House of Ti Commons for the first time this session on you M[onday, March 5. iMr. Fawcett came in first, of and was greeted with loud cheers, which aptly don illustrated the very kindly feeling which every- fan where prevails towards the blind Postmaster, whose lifo recently hung in the balance. But the greatest enthusiasm was of course mani tested when thle Prime blinister, about 5 o'clock, walked quietly in and sat down on the Treasury Bench. Mr. Gladstone had arrived from the Continent at Charing Cross on tihe previous Pa Saturday, after having spent three days in Paris cal on his way from Cannes. In Paris he had in- Br terviews in a friendly way with the President of and various Ministers, and it is hoped that the explanations *given and the confidences ex. changed will have materially tended to clear up pal the little misunderstatidings as to notion in G. Egypt, which have arisen between France and at this country. Mr. Gladstone now looks quite T j well again. He is brown as a berry, and walks with elastic step utterly different from the slow heositating walk of two months ago. DIr. Gladstone certainly has marvellous recuperative powers, and his case is a striking example of what the vis medicatrix naturos can be accomplish in a septuagintarian when aided by the warm breezes of the IMeditorranean. The Conservative Press declares that Mr. Gladstone we will not again resume his full loadership of the 22 Commons; he will, like Palmerston in Ins latter yi days, leave the mass of the work to his lion. tenants, and confine himself more to exercise a a general control over matters of policy tihan to the fighting of debate. Yet it will go hard with no the old war horsl bhut lie will be in the fray. pe On the very first day lhe needs must speak. IBut W of that anon. The thought that Gladstone has, if the Conservative authorities are right, and they probably are, taken the first steop towards that final retirement which ere many years must certainly come, makes one critical as to his ouc cessor. Lord Hartington has acquittedhimself te during his chief's absence with more ability * than was expected. But Ihe is only slow and nt sensible; he does not add to these excellent qualities the enthusiam and overpowering per- 51 sonal influonce of the Premier-and of course wi has not Gladstone's oratory. In Gladstone's at absence W.Vestminster has been like Hamlet f without the Ghost. TIIE BRITISH IN EGYPT. in The papers of all sorts of political belief have Gi been protesting against the proceedings of the tI Indemnity Commission in Egypt. The Egyptian Government have invited applications from w' those seeking indemnities, and have stated that they mean to appropriate Â£3,500,000 to meet the same. So all the persons injured in mind, body, orestate, at Alexandria, have been send ing in claims, most of which. from rascally Germans and Italians, and Bulgarians, and ti Swiss, are three-fold greater than by the most 2s liberal calculations they ought to he. Yet it 1I Would appear that,.the miserable Egyptian di Government will be cajoled by foreign dictation etopay nupto the full. Tihe thing is scaudalous, and if allowed to be carried out will deserve to In rank with the extortionsof Pigarro and Cortes, or exacted from equally defenceless victims. fo Touching our occupation in Egypt, Lord Hartington, the other day stated pretty g definitely that we shrould withdraw in six months or so. Gladstone 'oi March. Gth c spoke as follows:-" My noble friend thie ct Secretary for YWar referred to a certain period ft within which he thought it possible we might n withdraw from Egypt, and that reference lhas been understood in a great degree by the right ee heon. gentleman opposite as a statement that t e were to withdraw from Egypt within that E period. What my noble friend expressed was sl his hope; and that hope was the impression bu which he received upon such' a review of the Â° circumstances of the case as in the present e development of tlhe circumstances is practicable. What my noble friend and what we all feel is, it in the first place, that we have an im ortant f purpose to accomtplish in Egypt, and in the second place, when that purpose is accomiplished a we are sincerely desirous to withdraw. (Hear, nhear.) But with regard to a definition of time it is impossible to venture beyond an expression it of hope, because it is evident that the purpose as Swe have oi view must regulate the time to he , es employed, and that a fixed and arbitrary 0 time should not bh permitted ' to h interfere with the attainment of that r purpose. (Hiear, ear.) I think I may ry this. that tiel definition of the objects t] for which we are in Egypt has been explicitly made upon more thian one occasion to the IIouse. We are there for the establishment of order and stability; we are there for the inm Sprovoment; of thet instittlons of tihe country; we are there to secure as far as depends uplon us - the fulfilment of international engagements, w and we are there undoubtedly in a principal de- n gree with reference to the freedom and security Sof tihe great passage by the Canal fromr one sea to thoother. (Hear, hber.) fut if these were Smatters which were entirely and absolutely in I our hands it might be right and apar1 of our Sduty that we should from timo to time state I t exactly the points which we had reached in the adcjustment of these matters; but it will be Sborne in mind that we aire there not as the 0 masters, but as the friends and advisers in the ' first instance of the Egyptian Government, and Sthat with respect to many of the purposes for t rwhich we are thlere other nations have interests, is and not only interests but rights just as definite andl just as undeniable as our own. (Cheers.) STherefore we can state nothing definitely at id present.' .. OUR ARMY. h. The army estimates of the coming financial 0e year state tlie expenditure at Â£15,Si0l,700. There d isa oaesldorable increase, but of this Â£31,000 is contrihuted by the fact that it 1803 February has 20 days, so that thie financial year is one do day longer than in 18S3. So we spend Â£31,000 a. a day on our soldiers, and about the same on ng our navy I The army reserve is to be consider y ably increased. The number of our regulars, l auxiliaries, and reserves is set down at 036,051 s. men. But many of these men are, likte the French army of 2. millions, only on papier. The effective strengthl of our army, from all sources, ce is 555,435 men; 'of these, 02,000 are in India. . There are 2417,021 volunteers, of whom 207,300 he were effective last November when told. ie rTiE DANURIAN CONFEnrENCE. 1i The results of this Conferonco of ropresonta ftiyus of the Great Powers will be telegraphed to ire yon. I just wart to note tlimt although the y Conferencols sitting at thIe Foreoign Ollico in d Whlitelhsall, London, and is pIresided over by cs Lord Granville, yet we know no more about or its procredings than if it wecre sitting , ite Kmtschatka. About 5 p.m. when ' t1oe Conference breaks up we may lsee R ussian, French, German, Austrian, ad Turkish, Servinau, talian, and Englishl repreo. re- sentatives rolling awayin their carriages from led thie doors of the Foreign Of1ee. But " the rt great men give no token, and tie silence is un O broken." tIn the evening, maybe over grand ty dinner tables, there are mysterlors hints, but of said hints never go direct into the English Press. Ily Wenu it our moririg papers telegrams from 05' Patio and Berlin stating that "such and such a cal resolution was arrived at in thie Confercnce at ly London yesterday," and we accept this round rs about methlod of getting information. I suppose Stihe foreigners send conidential reports to their erGovernments, and the details leak out in So countries where the Press is more closely con enr aected with thie Government than in London. ten Any way we have to go from home for news of roy what occurs daily at the Foreign Olice. led Something besides ArrcAra aud Coerion Acts irg are requisite if we want to raise thie cordition of ex thie Irish peasantry. There are two alterna ley. tives-(1), help tlhem to emigrate and settle ns uponlanld wherore conditions are more favour i able, or (2) arrange so thrt trey ray gret more and better land in Ireland. At present the 001 emigration theory of relief finds most favonr, opd vast efforts are being made to get the wyetuber Irishmen away to fresll fields and pastures nea, Tihe landlords desire nothing better than to get rid of te Jtrlsh population, as there is then a prospeot of the places of " no rent" Irishmen being filled by n better class of people. But there ought ti he a remedy without driving the population out ot thie country. Ireland is very thinly peopled in. deed, and the population is constantly becoming less and less, so that the menus of subsistence for those who remain ought to be increased. This is one of the latest proposals in the newspapers towards reclaiming the Irishman without driving him out of house ani home :-" A real and permanent remedy can be easily found, if our legislators will but carry a little further that interferoneos with the absolute power of landlords which they have already recognisod as a prinoiple in the Land Act. An examination of tie literature .of the Irish Land Question will, I think, show that as a rule wherever the holdings are of adequate size and the rents not exorbitant the Irish peasant, far from being a half.atarved pauper, is comparatively well off and able to save money. Tile Land Act ensures that future rents shall be fair ; it is only neces. sary to ensure that holdings shall be adequate, and the problem will be solved. Tor this pur pose local authorities must have power to take any land from which the people have been cleared since the great famine, or suitable por tions of mountain land or large grazing farms in any district, to he lot at fair rents and in such quantities . as m-roy bm desired. : Ilt 'o'cif are enormous areas in the central parts of Ireland occupied in grazing farms of many square miles each, but even in the poverty-stricken West there is probably ample land to double the size of the present holdings. In MIr. Tuke's articlo in the Con temporarry Review of April last he gives the numhber of holdings in the ivo distressed counties of Donegal, MIayo, Galway, Clare, and Kerry, as 158,400, and the cultivated acres as 40,500, being an average of almost exactly six ea res per holding. But in Johnston's Geineral Gnzeteor,' published in 1871, I find the cultivated land of these five counties given as 3,GGT,000 acres, or nearly four times as much as iMr. Tukg gives ; while the total area is nearly double this, or 0,141,000 acres; and it is well known that a portion of nountain land added to a holding will often make all the difference between comfort and starvation. If the land of Ireland is thus thrown freely open to the peasants of Ireland, to be hoeld at fair rents, on a Reoure tenure, and in adequate quantities, no more will be heard of poronnial destitution. This is the only way to right the wrongs of long years of oppression and an unbroken succession of evictions and confiscation, and till this is done no reinedy will be found for distress and famine in Ireland."
