Another Fisher's Ghost. On Tuesday last Mrs. H. Small, residing ai Luddenham, about twelve miles from Penrith, reported to Sergeant Dove that her son, aged 1^ years, on returning home at about 12.30 thai morning, and when near the Fiery Paddock, sav- a phosphorescent figure about the size of an ela phant, but of the shape of a dog. This changed to a fiery circle shortly afterwards, and shortly after that to the figure of a man, headless. The young man became so terri bly alarmed that he started off towards home at a pace that would surprise even Samuels. He told his mother what he had seen, and on the following morning the two proceeded to the spot, where they Baw the remains of a fire, and among the debris some burnt bones and other things, which caused Mrs. Small to give information to the police. On Wed nesday Sergeant Dove, accompanied by Mounted constable Belfour, proceeded to Mrs. Small's residence, who at once took them to the spot in dicated. After a search the sergeant collected certain portions of the burnt debris, including bones and buttons, &c;, which he broua-ht into Penrith. The locality is described as in a very, out-of-the-way place, near the southern boundary of the Homestead run, and near the famous Filly Paddock, about a mile and a half from the Lud denham-road. Judging by all the surroundings, there is every appearance of a body having been burned ; and what is more suspicious, within a few feet of the fire. A hole has been dug about 6 feet long, 2 feet wide, and about IS inches deep, dug by some blunt tool. This hole and the remains of the fire appear to be of about two years' standing, and the general impres sion is that there has been foul play. The police have made every inquiry, but bo far without finding anything that would at all lead to elucidate the mystery. The bones were on Thursday examined by Dr. Brady, and care fully compared, with the result that the doctor at once pronounced the bones to be those of a human being.
