ODDS AND ENDS. By Urban. In my last letter yon have made an error, with regard to the trowel used by Lady Robinson in laying the foundation stone of the Working Men's Hall. It was the work of Mr. Mills-, and presented by Mr. Seeligson to the committee. On the 31st ult. the Government Gazette was printed by 6teain. This, I believe, is the first instance of steam printing, in tiiiÂ« colonv. In closing Rainer's Diorama, Mr. Stan ley thanked the public for their liberal pa tronage. And tie show is wall worthy of patronage. The scenes illustrating the cap ture of the Kelly Bushrangers were espe cially good, and took well, particularly that sli'ovving the Glenrowan Hotel on fire, and Fathei Gibney intrepidly walking up on his errand of mercy and Christian love. This evoked a perfect storm of applause. ; I can also give high praise to the scene in the Russian War, representing the siege of Kars and the final blowing up of the forts. And the American War scenes are remarkably good. You will, however, be soon enabled to judge for yourself, as the diorama is about to visit your shores. .On the 8th inst., Mr. George Shenton, the. first Mayor of Perth, entertained the mem bers of the Municipal Council at dinner, in celebration of his new title. Mr. Shenton has for years possessed the confidence of the Perth ratepayers. I trust he may long . continue to enjoy his title and position as chief civic functionary. Perth is waiting anxiously to see Grif- - fiths' great ghost. SUvester says he has nothing to do with it, and won't be respon- - sible for any failures. Lord Gifford, our new Colonial Secretary is a married man. His marriage took place at Eaton Square, London, in April last. Lord Gifford is-a captain in the 57th fort.
