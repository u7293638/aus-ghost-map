The Wyndham Results — Sad Steeplechase Accident. The gathering at Wyndham last Saturday produced one of the largest attendances ever held on the Werribee Plains, the weather be ing delightful, the card well filled, and no counter-attractions to keep away the pleasure- Bec&iug; uuuiic. xne racing nseii, moreover, was fully up to the mark, and all went "merry as a marriage bell" until the Steeplechase, when, as will be seen in the report elsewhere, a fine young lad named Rose was killed on the spot through the horse he was riding, Sunshine, falling on him opposite the stand. He was a parti cularly well-conducted fellow, full of pluck, and lie had been put up at his own earnest solicitation. His father trained several years for that enthusiastic lover of jumpers, the late lamented Mr. John Brown, of Ballarat, and much sympathy is felt for the cruel ' bereavement amongst hie many old acquaintanoes. Barlow, also — who is gene rally called the English jookey— received considerable injury by & nasty fall from Rocket; and this was doubly unfortunate for him, inasmuch as he has only just re- oovered from a broken leg sufficiently to ride. The results of the running for the different events were as follows .'—Selling Flat Race — Nymph, with Ard Righ second, the favourite having been Queen Elizabeth. Hurdle Race, for whioh six started— Miller, with Stormbird next. Wyndham Handioap, for which Coriolauus was served up warm as usual, and as usual sold his stable— Bunnie Bee.
