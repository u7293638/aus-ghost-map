7 ! ". CRICKET. : ^^'''For.tbé'BBOond'time'tbié seaaon haa tte kangaroo bad to succumb to tho lion, and tho defeat of tho! "Australian Eleven in' tho match against England, at; -liordsj provea the truth of my long ago oxpressodj 'Opinion that they were about equal to a strong! 'county, but had no earthly chanco of boating an «eleven of England, or even a woll-solooted team of players, In tho match whioh has juBt been con cluded the Australians were outplayed at ovory -point of the game-thoir batting, bowling and fielding -being alike inferior to that of tho Englishmen. It is true that they played a bit " stale " No doubt they -'must fool tho ofïeots of the hard work they havo -done. Bat givon all this in, at no period have they 'boon good onough to beat a picked eleven of Eng land, Tho new men havo boen dooidod failurea. *The only mari who showed really good oriokot was . Palmor, but ho could get no ono to assist him. .Spofforth failed lamentably with the ball, and Englishmen no longor seom to foar him as thoy used. On the English side Shrewsbury's innings will go down to posterity aa one of the very best exhibitions of batting that han ever boon soon. Ho never gavo \- a ghost of a ohance until ho was caught ont.
