Nurses in Time of War. Speaking of volunteer nurses in time of war, a soldier says : 'Some of the nurses are wise, and some foolish; some few careless; most over anxious that their patients .should eat, should'' rouse themselves when lethargic, and sleep when inclined to look about and talk; and all are of nninton that the Datient should be con stantly bathed with water or scent. ' ' Poor fellow !' one lady was heard to say, while tears of compassion stood in her eyes* ' Toot fellow, you are suffering io much ! it will relieve you if I wash your face.' .

' ' That's the ninth lady; its has washed my face to-day.' ' Would-be Tenant : 'I like the house very much, but I hear that it is haunted.' Landlord (rubbing his hands and railing) : ' My dear madam, I attend to that personally. The ghosts only appear to tenants who do not pay their rent and refuse to move out.'
