SERGEANT S. PBENTISS. TJIB following graphic sketch of the character and peculiarities of Mr Prcntibb, so well known in the United States of America BE an orator of very great power, is taken from Ten Years of Preacher Life, ' by Milburn - Sergeant S French was a compound of contra ilittions With a noble bust and superb head, he was yet short of stature, and was deformed by a shrivelled leg The master of nearly all manly accomplishments, a tearless eyes and bold hunter, he yet halted pain fully in his gait. With exuberant animal spirits, and matchless powers of conversation, (which made him the delight and soul of every social circle,) he would sometimes, in solitude, locking himself in for whole days, shed scalding tears, goaded almost to madness by morbid self torture Gifted with every power to win the admiration, confidence, and love of women, he shrank from their society, dreading lest his one drawback should excite unsympathetic remark, and this when his genius had already dazzled the best minds of the country Born and bred a Puritan, he was the representative men of south-western lue Pacific in disposition, md remarkable for sweetness of temper, he was famous as a duellist With virtues of character that won for him the lasting regard of the good men that ever knew him, it is nevertheless com- puted that honest hundreds of thousands of dollars by LBmbhng. Possessed of a fancy is gentle and sportive as Herbert s or Cowper's, I suppose that the eloquence of invective has produced nothing since the days of Demosthenes equal to his thunders against Mississippi repudiation The most effective man on the stump in the country he at the same time shone conspicuously in its higher courts Cogent ia argument, copious in imagination, he pleased while he persuaded, convinced while he charmed With a memory where way like retentive mss held not only the thoughts and images, but even words of ancient and modern poetry, there was coupled a wit as fertile as it was bathing, and in ur derstanding robust is it was comprehensive and original The Bible, Shakespeare, and Milton, were his land books, and it is said that he knew them from his to had His pathos was as extraordinary as his scorn At first you might have fancied him a mere rhetorician, but he had not proceeded far before you found him a consummate orator. He was master of all the passions of the human soul, and moved them as the expert musician draws from his instrument a concord of sweet sounds He gave in bounty what might have been the ransom of ounces , yet toward the proud he shewed the pride of Lucifer He would stand before a crowd of repudiating Mississippi voters, hurling at them taunts, ridicule, Barcaem, defiance, unt 1 their faces grew pale, and their lips livid with rage And then when the pestilence walked the streets of the city, and in almost every house there was found one ded, without a thought of personal danger he would devote weeks to the bed side of the poor and the stranger, with all the watchful tenderness and untired patience of a woman He was the idol of children, and no less of Indian warriors He is said to have delivered the greatest speech ever made in the Hall of Congress, and yet the people of the backwoods grew almost delirious under the spell of his eloquence Before the pistol of an antagonist at ten paces, his men was calm, his nerves farm as steel, but if introduced to a lady, his knees trembled, and his embarrassment would have been ludicrous had it not been so painful Take him for all in all, he seems to me the most wonderful man that our country has produced And yet he has left little to justify this remark to the world, if I except the unparalleled impression upon all who ever knew or heard him Leaving Maine, his native State, when nineteen years of age, he made his way to Cincinnati, and thence to Natchez. His object was by teaching to provide the means of preparing himself for the bar "I left Cincinnati," he said, " because everything was so tame-everything so cheap I couldn't spend a ninepence. I was haunted, too, by the ghosts of slaughtered swine. I arrived at Natchez with one five-dollar hill in my pocket. I knew that it was not a capital to trade upon, and I spent it in the purchase of confidence. So soon as I reached the threshold of mine host-the Boniface of the hotel I ordered a bottle of wine with cigars, and called the landlord as the only guest to join me. He drank and I told him who I was, what I wanted, and what he had to expect in the way of pay for my fare beyond what was before us He looked at my face, said he would trust it, gave me his hand, and, without a word more did trust me for board and lodging till I got a school I kept school, and cleared ground enough-of butcher rods, with which I taught the young idea how to shoot-to entitle me to a pre-emntion-nght of public land " He brought letters of introduction to a wealthy merchant of Natchez, from whom he borrowed fifteen dollars, with the promise to return it as soon as he was able At the close of his first quarter's tuition, he came into town with a proud heart to fulfil his pledge, but was shocked by a severe reproof which the strict man of debt and credit administered for his delay, and the trouble it had given Some years afterwards, Prentits gained a suit for this old friend which saved him the bulk of his fortune and the generous friend of the old time counted out a five dollar bill as the fee which the lawyer had left to his honour. Removing to Vicksburg, notwithstanding his youth and that he was a Yankee, he at once took the fore- most position at the bar, and was ere long drawn into the maelstrom of politics, as every man of decided character in the South soon will be Although he defended many of in an charged with murder, and, no doubt, often robbed the gallows of its due, he never, except in two instances, prosecuted men charged with capital offences One of these was a desperado named Phelps, who, after a series of high crimes and misde- meanors, setting the officers of the law at defiance, had killed an unoffending citizen in cold blood. He had borne himself throughout the trial with the in- solvency of a brave, treating all persons in the court with disdain When Mr Prentiss rose as the assistant of the prosecuting attorney to deliver his speech, the ruffian glared fiercely at him like a wild beast ready to spring upon his victim , but as the law yer proceeded to rehearse his crimes, and portrayed them in the dark colours of their guilt, the culprit quailed, his head Bank upon his breast, and he sat abashed and overwhelmed, not daring to lift his eyes again until after sentence of death had been pronounced While in the jail awaiting his execution, he sent for the man who had sealed his fate, and the heart which had long been chilled and defiled in the breast of guilt, softened and bared itself to the prosecutor He told the story of his life to Mr Prentiss, and then mentioned that he had formed the purpose of escaping during the trial His plan was twofold first, to leap upon his prosecutor, who, aside from his lameness, had the look of a mere boy, to kill him, and then, amidst the confusion, secure his own flight He was deterred from attempting to execute this fine scheme by tending in the eye and bearing of the youthful orator unmistakable signs that such an at tempt would prove an ignominious failure When he had disclosed his plans, Mr Prentiss quietly remarked, " I saw it all, but I was prepared for you " His main object in soliciting the interview was to un bosom himself by making known the particulars of his private history In those days, the law of honour was the higher law religiously obeyed in Mississippi. Street fights and duels were of daily occurrence, and every professional and political man was expected to take a hand with rifle, pistol, or bowie knife, as often as convenient. Such was the general delight in these encounters, that as soon as the sound of shots was heard, the entire community flocked to the scene to witness the exhibition It is related that as two gentlemen were I engaged in target practice at each other in one of the villages of Mississippi some twenty years ago, an overgrown lad, the down on whose chin scarce required a razor, rushed up and down the street, along which the bullets were whizzing, wringing his hands, and shrieking convulsively), while tears dropped from his eyes, " A gun ' a gun ? will nobody lend me a gun I I understand it's a free fight, and I'm dying to have a crack," It was a matter of course that so conspicuous a person as Mr PrentusB should take his share in these honourable encounters, which were of almost daily occurrence in Vicksburg. It is stated on what seems . good authority that an enterprising capitalist built a steam ferry-boat to ply between this thriving city and the opposite bank of the river where the formal in- terviews usually took place for the express accommodation of the duellists, their friends, and an interested public. It is added that the returns from the investment were large-the fare charged was twenty five cents each way. Mr P had scarcely made his brilliant debut at the Vicksburg bar before a plan was set on foot to get him out of the way. It was arranged that a person, who, having been born and educated a gentleman, had thrown himself away, and was last becoming a sort, but who was withal a capital marksman, should perform this service for the community. His second bore the challenge. Prentiss quietly read it, and stated that he would answer it at his own time and in his own way. Selecting one of his best shirts he despatched it by his body-servant, with the following note -" Sirs-I accept your challenge, but with one proviso, that you appear on the ground in the accompanying piece of minent, as it is impossible for me to fight any one who does not observe the externals of a gentleman." The gentleman withdrew the challenge, but kept the that Mr. Plenties had two duels with General Foote, which, by the way, were the only times he ever fought for the various little episodes with fists and cents are not to be taken into the account. At the second meeting, a large crowd was assembled to witness the scene One shot had been bred, Foote's ball flying wide of his antagonist, while Prentiss had missed fire The parties were placed at ten paces for the second round, pistol in hand, only waiting the word The intense interest of the spectators had drawn them in two long lines close to the combatants, leaving only a narrow lane for the passage of the balls An urchin, who had an ill chance to see in the crowd, had taken a tree in the year of Mr. P and by alert climbing was rapidly gaining the breeches, where from a con fortable seat he might witness the trans- action Prentif fa observed him, and said in his kindest tone, " My son, you had better look out, I am afraid you will be hit General Foote is shooting very wild to do) The remark, and the manner of its delivery, called forth a round of three cheers from the bye btantiers , when, order being restored, the fight proceeded As he was about to retire one morning towards three o'clock, there was a violent rap at the door, opening it, he encountered a mechanic, known to him by sight, who was evidently under the influence of liquor, and demanded immediate satisfaction for some fancied insult he had received at Mr P 's hinds Premiss reasoned with him, suggesting that he should go home and sleep on the matter, and if, after cool reflection, he desired to appease his honour, he should he satisfied but the fellow was immovably set upon fighting then and there Always disposed to oblige his friends, Mr P called up his body servant, Run, and good humouredly requested him to bring his case of duelling pistols, and then proceeded with great de liberation to load them Giving the choice to the aspirant for duelling distinction, he took the other, and it was arranged that the parties should take their stands on the piazza in rear of the office, at eight paces. Buir, greatly elated at the thought of his important post, was to hold the candles, so that the light falling through the windows, should be thrown directly upon the combatants When all things were in readiness, he was to count in a loud clear voice, from one to five , the fearing to take place at discretion, anywhere between the first and the last number Pistol in hind the men took their stand, their eyes glancing along the barrels, writing only the dreadful word, one when the mechanic, flinging his pistol to the ground, cried, " Prentiss, do you suppose in such a fool as to be fighting for it three o'clock in the morning with nobody but a nigger by * I thought I was is braves min 19 you are, but I ain't, sole's shake hands and be friends " Riding the circuit in Mississippi a quarter of a century ago was no child's play Bench and bar, mounted on horseback, with briefs and records stuffed into saddle-bags, had to make long journeys over roads which were sometimes knee- deep in mud, and which sometimes dwindled to a bridle path, or even to a faint trace, fording and swimming streams frequently out of their banks, flooding the country for miles on either side, and crossing swamps where anning was a common occurrence, and where it was no uncommon thing for a quicksand to swallow the horse, and put the rider up to all he knew to save his own life. The taverns were log cabins, so were the court-houses and jails The recreations of the sprigs of the law after a hard day's journey, or the yet more arduous duties of the court-room-were story- telling, whisky punch or whisky reverend (as the un- mixed is styled), and a game of seven up" or "poker in which judge, jurors, sheriff, clerk, witnesses, clients, and lawyers united I cannot refrain from inserting here the account of one of Mr Prennes' journeys, from the pen of Colonel Baillie Peyton, as characteristic of the man and the times " On landing at Vicksburg, in November of 1873, of 7 out from Tennessee to New Orleans, I found Mr Plenties and Colonel Forrester, in old friend and former colleague in Congress from Tennessee, looking out for me They made so strong an appeal that I was induced to leave the steamer and accompany them to Hillsborough, the county seat of Scott County, situated in the interior of Mississippi, where the Board of Commissioners appointed by the President to adjudicate the claim of the Choctaw Indians was about to meet A few days before my arrival, i Most violent and calumnious article appeared in a newspaper published at Vicksburg, in which these claims were denounced as fraudulent, and Colonel For ester and Mr Prentiss held up in a most odious light before the public The name of the author was demanded, and after some hesitation rather than meet the consequences of a refusal, the editor agreed to place in the hands of Mr Pratt is a sealed package containing full and undeniable evidence of the author- ship, to be opened at Hillsborough, on condition that Mr e, one of the commissioners, should deny him self to be the author of the article " This expedition partaking somewhat of both a civil and military character, afforded the best opportunity I ever had for appreciating the personal qualities and splendid abilities of Mr Prentiss Our Journey led through Jackson, the capital of the State, where I heard him publicly denounce! repudi mon as a crime, is an act of moral turpitude, when surrounded by repudiates who had also been out, and many of whom had shot their man with perfect impunity , but those who did not like him too well, dreaded him too much to make it a person a matter "After travelling several days over roads almost impassable, through a country thinly settled, chiefly byMpntteis, we arrived it Hill borough It was a small village, with the forest trees standing on the public square, and in most of the streets Here and there By a fallen musk, cut down for firewood , the limbs being lopped off BS occasion required The court house jail, and private dwellings were built of trees, the former and some of the latter having two sides hewn At this mode place were collected an immense number of Choctaw Indians and land speculators "The object of Mr P 's visit was to expose the commissioner who had publicly denounced the claims he was about to adjudicate, drive him from the Board, of induce the other commissioners to refuse to sit with him, on the ground that he had disqualified himself, both as a judge and as a gentleman, to be associated with them in the decision of causes which he had ever judged, and also to demand personal satisfaction for the abusive and ide "This journey to Hillsborough, as I have said the nature of the business which called him there-the crowd of men, savage and semi s wage, civilised and semi- civilised, amongst whom he was thrown, and to all of whom he was the chief object of attention , the philippics he hurled in the face of that commissioner, presented S S Prentiss in a great variety of scenes, and in a more interesting point of view than I ever saw him or any other man "We arrived a day or two before the Board was convened for the transaction of business, and put up with an unlettered but well meaning old gentleman, who filled a variety of public offices , being the town " sqime," jailer, and tavern keeper, in which last vocation he had many competitors ""When not otherwise employed, we amused ourselves in shooting squirrels, which proved to be no small accession to our bill of fare Boiled gray squirrels are quite a delicacy when properly cooked, and this Mr Prentiss superintended in person, calling loudly for butter with which to dress them " He was formally introduced to the chief, Captain Post Oak,' a perfect model of the natural man, six feet six or eight inches in height, he joined, too, in the sports of the Indian, among other things shooting blow guns, at which he soon became so expert that he beat the best of them A blow gun is formed of a reed or cane, from twelve to fifteen feet in length, bored through so as to admit the passage of a light crew, which is ejected by the breath hence the name With this weapon the Indians are able to bring down birds and squirrels from the trees "In passing the jail one day, we caught a glimpse of a prisoner confined in the dungeon or lower storey, He beckoned us to the grates, and then through livid lips and chattering teeth for it was frosty November weather poured forth a touchingappeilforprotection, strongly protesting his innocence, and declaring his ignorance of the charge against him Additional interest was imparted to the situation of this man, on account of the fate of two who had been recently elected to the gallows by a public meeting of the sovereigns " Repairing forthwith to the tavern, we inquired of our landlord as to the charge against him, and requested as his counsel, to see the pictures upon which he was committed The 'Squire' appeared to be somewhat embarrassed, and at length acknowledged that there had been no regular commitment, nor even any specific charge against him but said the fellow was a doubtful character, and had been imprisoned on suspicion ' On suspicion of what >' asked Mr Prentiss. 'Has anybody been killed, or robbed, or lost a horse, a hog, or a cow v " No, no,' said the Squire, is nothing of that sort his happened, but then he is a kind of surplus character, circulating about, and not very agreeable at that "Mr Prentiss declared that he should be set free that if the Squire refused to turn him out, he should be discharged on habeas corpus, if he had to go to Jackson himself for the writ, and sue every man concerned in his detention for false imprisonment, Thus I startled the Squire, who had never seen nor had he any definite idea of a writ of habeas corpus, and en | tertaining a respect mingled with awe for Mr Prentiss, he consented to discharge the prisoner. Unfortunately), however, his son, who had that morning ridden twelve miles into the country in quest of butter wherewith to dress our squirrels, hid cm led the key of the jul with him, so that it could not be opened until he came back Meanwhile, Mr Prentiss, whose whole heart was now in the matter, and who felt like an ancient knight bent upon the rescue of an unfortunate- captive from some feudal castle, returned to console the prisoner with the prospect of his early liberation He, poor fellow, stood shivering, with sunl en eyes and hollowed cheeks, looking the picture of deep r Mr Prentiss inquired if he did not think a little brandy would help him Mightily ' but there is no chance to get it in to me' Mr Prentiss, however, set his fertile ingenuity to work and succeeded by introducing a blow gun through the gates, one end of which the prisoner put to his mouth, while the brandy was poured into the other " Finally, the young man having returned with the key, he was brought to the tavern ate a hearty meal received a handsome purse sufficient to supply his immediate wants, and went on his way rejoicing, looking upon his liberation as next to a minute, and on the generous man who accomplished it as his good angel There was to me something inexpressibly interesting in this scene, as the poor fellow gazed in the face of his deliverer, and hung around him as though he felt secure in his newly gained freedom cut) in the presence of Mr Prentiss It called to mind the touching picture of Uncle Toby at the bed- side vi Lefevre, and the effect produced by his honest benevolent face in winning the heart of the little son of the dying officer, who was unconsciously drawn to his side, and took hold of his hand "All that Steine said of his hero and more, might without exaggeration be said of Mr Prentiss There was a frankness in him which led you at once into his soul, and shewed you his goodness of nature there was something in his look, and voice, and manner, which materially beckoned to the unfortunate, inviting them to come and take shelter under him He was indeed, a man whom, at first sight, the loweSt would trust, the distressed appeal to, and the brave confide in But to return to our business at Hillsborough When the Board met in the log cabin, the scene was picturesque in the extreme. There were the three commissioners, Mr Graves, Mr Tyler, (a brother of the President of the United States, and Mr. e, with their clerk, Seated on one side of a table made of pine boards, on the other sat the counsel of the Indians, while the building was filled to overflowing with their clients, hundreds of whom, unable to find room inside, were crowded around the house, with their swarthy faces and darke) CB peering through the apertures between the logs ' Mr Prentiss rose to a preliminary question, and handing a newspaper containing the offensive article to Mr --, inquired whether he was or was not the author to which he replied with some heart turn and evident embarrassment in the negative Whereupon Mr Prentos drew from his pocket and broke the seal of an envelope containing the papers which had been placed in his hands by the editor of the Vicksburg Kemmel They proved to be the original manuscript from which the article was published, in the handwriting of Mr ; and also his letter to the editor which accompanied the same In this letter he boldly assumed whatever responsibility might attach to him as author of the article, and in advance ten dered personal satisfaction to the party aggrieved as these documents were produced, and the truth flashed upon him, the commissioner made a lame effort to justify his denial by saying, ' I was the writer but nor the author of the article, having copied it for a friend " Mr. Prentiss proceeded to read the letter and manuscript article, in the latter of which ' one Forrester, and certain influential men' along with him, were denounced in unmeasured terms, the claims they advocated condemned as the most stupendous fraud ever devised, and the whole thing represented is a deeply laid plot to swindle the United States and the good people of Mississippi "The commissioner was eulogised is if he were the only man in the commission who possessed the salient, honesty, independence, and patriotism to throw him self in the breach, and resist the speculators " Having read these documents with marked deliberation and emphasis, Mr Prentiss threw down the papers and raised himself to his full he got, his noble front line, and chest expanded by the tension f f his soul, his countenance then flowed with the fire of intellect, and his eye consumed with lightnings of scorn that laughed forth as he spoke,' the form of that base commissions- Thus as he stood, the painter or the sculptor who should have mirrored his features on canvas, or graven them in marble, would have then and there won immortality * Ere he had uttered one word his work was accom- plished the man was gone-the former judge was the convicted culprit During the two hours in which this torrent of eloquence descended I do not believe its effect it any moment exceeded which his look had realised I never till then understood the force of an expression used by Disraeli I believe in describing Voltaire ' That he possessed in a remarkable degree physiognomist eloquence If the philippic of Cicero which drove Catiline from Berne was as terrible no wonder to it on the left the city ' On this occasion, Mr Prentiss, with an oppressed nation is his clients, had a noble theme for ora orr, scored) inferior in interest and variety to that of Sheridan in the trial of Hastings He gave a most interesting history of the Choc this is a nation, of their pacific character and uni form friendship for the people of the United States, dwelling with great effect upon the oppression and in justice which they had already experienced. He described what a judge should be, investing him with elms st divine attributes of virtue, and wisdom, and justice and then contrasted such a pure and elevated character with the prejudiced partizan and unprincipled demagogues, who, acting in the name and clothed with the power of his government, was about to crush the last hope of in injured people, and fitch fronting the mite which that government, in the exercise of its resistless power, had seen fit to grant them In alluding to the wrongs which the Choc laws had experienced in return for their good conduct he melted the hearts of all Indians and white men and drew tears from eyes before which death had no terrors groans and sobs burst from stone bosoms, and cheeks were wet which had seldom or never been governed by a tear "The Board adjourned to consider the motion to expel Mr ; and at its next sitting he read a protest against the power of his colleagues to deprive him of a commission he received from the President of the United States, which was the occasion of such another speech from Mr Prentiss as I have just described But the other commissioners refused to sit with him, referred the question to Washington for the decision of the President and adjourned sine die ' The personal satisfaction which had been tendered in advance by Mr e, was refused by him, and having thus retreated beyond the pale of honour, he was stopped The President afterwards removed him Mr Prentiss power over juries is illustrated by the following incident, which occurred in a pine woods region, not far from Pearl River, Mississippi. He appeared for the defendant in a suit brought for damage the panel, composed of wire grass people were thrilled by his marvellous eloquence and, despising the technical forms of the law, without retiring from the box, agreed upon their: verdict, which was thus delivered vita voce, by the foreman -"We finds for Lawyer Prentiss, the plaintiff to pay the costs " He was the head and front of that party in the State respectable for intelligence and position, but overweighted at the polls, which insisted upon the payment of the bonds due from Mississippi to her creditors This party had been defeated in one popular election, but some of the leaders thought that success might yet be attained by nominating for the office of governor, Judge Sharkey, a man of irreproachable character, and withal very popular in the State Mr Prentiss felt that it would be hazarding too much to remove Judge Sharkey from the place of Chief Justice on the Supreme Bench, and subject him to the chance of a popular election , he therefore induced the nominating committee of the Whig Convention, assembled in Jackson, in June, 1843, to alter their determination of proposing Judge Sharkey, and to substitute the name of another prominent member of the party This created a perfect furor of disasters renaming the members of that body Complaints and murmurs arose from all quarters of the hall No one objected to the gentleman who was offered, but nearly everybody preferred Judge Sharkey During all this excitement, Mr Prentiss, clad care lesBlv in a plain summer suit his collar open, and his fine flowing locks streaming rearranged and almost wildly, sat perfectly calm and silent The time had not arrived at which he decided to mingle in the strife, and assign the reasons for his conduct At length a member addressed the President, and proposed to strike out the name of the person reported from the committee as the candidate, and to insert that of William L. Sharkey The motion was not e-seasecondea before Mr. Pienfass sprang rather than rose to his feet, threw his well-known stick in its accused Kind place to support his infirm limb, and, in advanc- n g energetically to the front of his desk, began to pour forth one of those powerful and overwhelming torrents of eloquence for which he has become so famed The peculiar sound of his cane, as he limped along from his seat (a bound which is well remem- Very d in Mississippi, and which never failed to draw universal attention, whenever, during his service in Congress, he entered the Hall of Representatives at once stilled the audience into the most perfect silence Every one could see that the mood was upon him, and that he had been touched by the magic wand of his miniStering genius He assailed the motion as striking a death-blow at the already crippled character of Mississippi With more than usual skill he drew a graphic picture of the whole array of repudiatory, " with their ragged pirate flag borne shamelessly in the midst of them, advancing in swarms to do their murderous, infamous work " He described them as 'Huns,' guided by leaders who owned all the atrocious principles of Atula, without possessing his courage or his t dents " Alluding to the defeat which the bond-payers had sustained at the last elections, I he spoke with power unsurpassed against that policy which dictated to us, " after having lost the main battle, and been driven back from every post, and i cuted it all points, to draw our greatest leader from the strong citadel of the Supreme Court to encounter in uncertain fate in a hazardous campaign " This citadel maintained, he declared that the " wild beast of repudiation" was restrained from striking, at least, the left fatal and irrecoverable blow on the already pre strate name of Mississippi "Here, after having scattered his vile foam and exhaled his pestilential breath in every other quarter, he could at last be muzzled and strangled " He then spoke with deep feeling of the purity, learning, and spotless character of Judge Sharkey, and declared that "the honest men of Mrs hiesippi could not spare him from the bench at such a time His court was the last refuge left under the inflictions of this worse than Egyptian plague," and they would rise up in one solid mass to protest against his being surrendered against the letting go of our only hold, to flounder amidst the uncertainties of a political campaign " He said, with an expression of countenance that thrilled the audience, that " Judge Sharkey should not be forced to sell the pure ermine of judicial eminence by seeking an en gagement with this unclean monster " Still, he continued, it was " essential to fight the beast, pestiferous as it was " He had read in Roman history that the march of a whole army had been once arrested by coming in contact with a huge serpent, whose very breath poisoned the entire atmosphere around them Regulus halted his columns, and decided that safety called for the destruction of the monster even though many human lives should be the forfeit If the serpent, as was naturally to be expected, should follow on their march, the whole army must inevitably be swept away by pestilence. And thus, day after day, were detachments drawn out, until the destroyer was in turn destroyed. " Our march," he continued, " to fame and to greatness as a State, has been improved by the intervention of this vile serpent Repu- diation Its hiss is heard from every hill, and through every broad valley of Mississippi Already its venom has blighted their bloom and freshness , the very air by which they were nourished is contaminated, and certain death seems to be the fate of all who venture within the tainted precincts One only spot is safe from its noxious influence, and let us rather closely guard every avenue of approach, this open the way for the incursion of this fell destroyer. He should be fought by the subordinates the rank and file of the army , but all America would deplore and ridicule the policy which the resolution in question, if adopted, must force upon the bond-paying party " Colonel Thorpe thus described a scene which occurred at New Orleans, in February, 1844, on the occasion of Mr City's visit "The streets about the St Charles Hotel presented a vast ocean of heads, and every building commanding a view was literally I covered with human beings The great statesman of the West presented himself to the multitude between the tall columns of the finest portico in the country. The scene was beyond description As the crowd swayed to and fro, a shout was raised for Mr Clay to speak , he uttered a sentence or two, waved his hand in adieu, and escaped amidst the prevailing confusion Prentiss meanwhile, evidently unconscious of being himself noticed, was at a side window, gazing upon what was passing with all the delight of the humblest spectator Suddenly his name was announced He attempted to withdraw from public gaze, but his friends pushed him forward Again his name was shouted, hats and caps were thrown in the air, and he was finally compelled to show himself on the portico With remarkable delicacy he chose a a less prominent place than that previously occupied by Mr Clay, although perfectly visible He thanked his friends for their kindness by repeated bows, and by such smiles as he alone could give ' A speech . a speech' thundered a thousand voices He lifted his hand, man instant everything was still then point- ing to the group that had surrounded Mr Clay, he said, 'Fellow-Citizens, when the eagle is snoring in the sky, the owls and the bats retire to their holes ' ( AL d long stir re the shout that followed this remark ceased, Prentiss had disappeared amid the multi | tude " The popular assembly was the place of his proudest exhibitions to the multitude he was as a trumpet He said, " Fellow-citizens " and, arduous elected,, the people stood still or swayed to and fro, or shouted were bad, entailed or frowned, at his magic will He was invited, just after the adjournment of Congress in the summer of 1838, to address army's meeting at Havre de Grace, Maryland, and thus made his bow to the audience -' Fellow- citizens, by the Father of Waters at New Orleans, I have said fellow citizens on the banks of the beautiful Ohio, I have said fellow-citizens , here I say fellow-citizens , and a thousand miles beyond this, North, thanks be to God, I can still say fellow citrus " Thus, ma single sentence, he saluted his audience, drew every man, woman, and child near to him, made himself dei- rtothem, by a word covered the continent, by a line mapped the United States, from the Gulf to the Likes, by a greeting, card from the heart, beaming from the countenance, depicted the whole country, its progress, development, grandeur, glory, and union. Every hat was whirled in the air, every handkerchief was waving, the welkin rung with hurrahs, the multitude heaved up to the stand, stood on tip-toe, and shouted cheer after cheer, as if wild with joy, and mad with excitement While Mr Prentiss was delivering a speech in Paris ml Hall, BosUn, Edward Everett, unable to contain himself, turned to Mr Webster and said, " Did you ever hear such astonishing eloquence I" " Never from any one but Mr Prentiss himself," was Mr Webster's reply During the Presidential canvass of 1844, he was making one of his great speeches before an immense audience, in Nashville, Tennessee Overcome by his exertions, he fell fainting into the arms of his friend, Governor Jones, who, frenzied with excitement, shouted at the top of his voice over the unconscious form which he supported, " The, Prentiss ! die now, you will never have again an opportunity so glorious " Having used his best exertions to convert the people of Mississippi from their disgraceful policy of repudiation and mortified beyond expression at the idea of remaining in a State which refused to pay its debts, he removed, in 1844, to New Orleans It was in the bar-room of the St. Charles, in February 1848, that I saw this extraordinary person for the first time He died a little more than two years after, in his forty second year. His death was hastened by the fearful drafts made upon his admirable constitution in his political career, and by the superhuman exertions he put forth in professional labours, to relieve himself from embarrassments which edged him about, and were in great part the results of gaming Few books of American biography rev call a character possessed of such sweet, beautiful, and noble traits, adorned with the highest gifts of genius, and enriched by all the culture possible in his position, as the Memoirs of S S Prentiss, to which, by the way, I am indebted for much of the material for this sketch But few leave to painful and Bad an impression It is the story of a man who might have been the boast of his rate-the glory of his nation , who, with talents and opportunities the greatest, died before his time, and now discrowned of his kingly power, with ghostly finger points the eyes of his countrymen to that solemn warning coupled with the imperishable truth, " Whatsoever a man soweth, that also shall he reap "a
