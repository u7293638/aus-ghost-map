Cape Moreton light wns wighted at IO p.m. on that day, and the Vessel was hove-to till daylight, when" she rounded Cape Moreton. She cunio alongside Forrest's wharf on Saturday afternoon, where sho will discharge the cargo consigned to Brisbane, and also take in freight for Baffle Creek should nny oder. Captain Baker is agent for this vessel. The Rhondo, schooner, will engage in tho lightering trade in this port in a few days. The Eva, schooner, will leave Raff's wharf for Mooloolah nt 2 p.m. this day. Captain Banks gives us the subjoined account of the passage of the Cairngorm from Liverpool to Moreton Bay: She left Liverpool on March 22nd, in tow of a steam-tug, having on board some 200 tons of cargo and about 169 passengers, and arrived at Greenock on March 23rd, where she took on board about 300 tons of cargo (including a screw lighter in pieces), and 195 passengers. She left Greenock on March 28th, with the follow- ing passengers on board, viz., 147 English ; 131 Scotch; 75 Irish; and 3 others; total, 353 souls. She had a fair run to the equator in 22 days. It was crossed in 26 deg. 30 min. W. longitude. She reached the meridian of Greenwich in 42 deg. south on May 17th, having had to contend with light variable southerly winds and calm, and get- ting a good share of the " braw west winds. " By June 11th she was in a parallel with Tasmania, when the wind veered to north-east,and continued from that quarter until June 27th. When in lati- tude 31 deg. south, longitude 154 east, the wind changed to south and freshened into a strong gale, with terrific squalls. On June 28th she made the land off Cape Moreton. On the 29th, at noon, she received on board Mr. Sholl (the pilot), after a passage of 92 days from port to port. We stated a few days ago that Captain Bennett intended selling the schooner Hamlet's Ghost, which brought him and his crew in safely from the Chesterfield Islands. She has since been transferred to Messers. J and G. Harris, but the price paid for her has not been stated. The Everton was lying outside the river bar when the Clarence passed her on Saturday last. The Clarence left the wharf at 7 p.m. on Friday last, and proceeded to the bay to bring up the pas- sengers from the Cairngorm. She crossed the bar that night, and anchored at a short distance form the vessel. Early on the next morning she went alongside, and, having embarked the passengers and their luggage, returned to Brisbane. She ar- rived at the South Brisbane Depot at about 1 p.m. on Saturday, and landed all the passengers. Shortly before the Clarence cast off from the Cairngorm, it was discovered that five seamen be- longing to the ship's crew had stowed themselves away among the passengers' luggage. Captain Banks immediately gave them into the custody of Mr. Inspector McDonald, of the water police, who brought, them to town and lodged them in Brisbane gaol. The Clarence leaves hence for Rockhampton at noon this day. For Maryborough, Gladstone, and Rockhamp- ton, the Queensland will leave at 12 noon to- morrow. The Settler is temporarily laid up, pending the completion of her fittings. We may mention that an advertisement has appeared in the "Sydney Morning Herald " offering this vessel for sale. The Uncle Tom was lying off the powder maga- zine last night. STEAMERS for Ipswich.- The A. S. N.
