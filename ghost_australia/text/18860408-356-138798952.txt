': SARAH BERNHIARDT. ' :' I is rather alarming to honieaa tha~ Sarah Bernhardt contemplates appear. ing.in a whole series of Shakspeare heroines. "Her annexations o "onr poet's characters have been more numerous than the British public are yet aware of. She told a reporter of a Paris paper the other week that she had already appeared in Desdemona, Cornelia (sic), C01oopatra, and' Lady Mnacbeth. His isterview with her had relation to the farthcoming producti.on of " Hamlet." But before she spoke of it she announced her positive aetermination to appear as Beatrice, Rosahnd, and Juliet. Opholia rather alarms her. She had been struck 'by the extreme youthfulness of the character, but takes comfort in reflect ing that her Evglish rival is about heiÂ· own age. The Porto St. Martinversion of' IIHamlet" is to be on all fours with the English acting version. The stocke French "'Hamlet"' had improved on Shakespeare by disturbing the leisure of the ghost, and bringing him on the stage after the duel to conclude the piece. This, however, was not the more famous version in which " Aogels and ministers of grace defend ts's ,was translated " Mon Dieu, qu'est oe que o'est que cola ?" Such solecisms will be avoided, the costumes of the foulr. teenth centutry will be adopted,' follonw ing Fechter's suggestion, and Hamlet will wear a blonde wig, for therather inconclusive reason that Burbage did the satmeo.
