4 ^HOWSHALt. WE DECIDE THIS (QUESTION ? ' Now, which ia the worse- to have m appetite for you? dhuier, or to have no dinner for your m-uetHe?' There are lots of people on the one side .or &e; other of this question. Whec 'good 4ig«stiou waits on appetite and health on fe..ith/ that is the idtal attitude of a person (towards bis me&te; . But most of us are not jkk-ssed in that way ; we either have toe much (food without an appetite, or a vigorous appetite without eaough to atisfy it, Differ *»it folk will answer ihis question differently, S*» me com moo sense of it is that, within seasonable limits, it is better to bare an *ppeiite without a diuner, because, short of ihe atarvation line, a hungry man 13 a healthy *u*n ?; whereas a man who ought to eat and ^oesi/t feel like eating, stands in need of ' alterations and repairs.* To illustrate. We recently received « &omniuuic;&tton; in which ihe writer sayf, ' I vas afraid to eat.' Did be faDcy his food »*s poisoned, or did bis nature rebtl against fte nourishment lived on? If the latter, «ri»y f Let htm clear tbe mystery himself. He sayp, 'In the year 1889 I changed my w,ork from railway porter to signalman, t fead been signal twelve months, and then all *t oncp, so to speak, i did not ieel myself. My mouth tasted bad, so that ordinary articles of diet seemed to lose their flavour; the palate, to put it in that way, appeared to have nothing to say to then?. One thing was like another, and none was good. My tongue was coated and far red, with a dark line down the middle and yellow fur round & My breath was offensive and my appetite poor, with pains through the chest and ghouMers, which were always right before I »ad eaten anything. Then I was greatly ft-oubled with wind. It would gather so it £e!t Jike a ball in my throat, and act as if it «r.oald choke me.' We cannot wonder tfcat under these circum, Stances our friend failed to do justice to his Sieals. He adds that there was what be calls * a pricking sensation' at his heart, as though jt were torched with some sharp instrument fhen, again, at times be was attacked with. &li;&3iu?~. tb& aevinv of toKioK »--? o** on«n.A that the sweat rolled off him. *I dreaded/ foe suye, * 'be thought of eatintr, aud many 'a tttanty meal have 1 made, for J toaa afraid to' * After a tin e I got into a low- weak, Strvous condition, and felt miserabjp, as if something was going to bapptn, and this #»niied me to lose a good deal of sleep.* What be means by the fear of Something going to hsppeu' if, of course, the fear of same calamity, sucn as the loss of his position, his own death, or the death oF somebody dear to bitr, Tms was due, as h? iptiatbtr*. \o the impoverished state of his fclood {ihs life bearer), his unstrung nerves *nd io tbe brain eofWjbled by lack ot iP-oufIs'id enf, Tfre night of this form of ilh^M i* always fall of ghosts and gobliof: tiio creatures ot a restless and ongoverne-i jfu-'gniHtion. ♦ With great diflSeulty,' he say«,-I stuck to oiv work, for 1 had a wife and family depending on me, So I struggled on, bat What I Buffered for over tw0 yars ;s past my |»ower« of dc-sciiptii-n. / am sure no one ha* tpjfered at nvth as I have 4one.' In the latter statement he is undoubtedly . vronp. Out's own pain is one's owr, und )8 always harder to bear than :a oue'a noti.n Of hi« neighbour's pain. There is a countless wultifude wno are all the while gcing thfi-ujth tht- same wretched exjetienpe, only We don't happen to come in t. ach with thtw.
