QUEENSLAND STEAM NAVIGATION CO. (To the Editor of the Queensland Times.) Sir,-I would caution the Ipswich public to be on their guard as regards a Director of the above Com- pany. The statistics furnished by the highly moral, humane, sand illustrious Fitz, as regards the Emu and her earnings, has evidently been supplied by this Director for purposes-as the public well know- but little calculated to advance the interests of the Com- pany. Seeing such to be the case, it would be as well for the Ipswich people to consider how far conducive it is to their interests to continue their support to a Company where a man is a Director who was granted a living here when unable to get it elsewhere, and who now turns round ungratefully to stab the place he is so much indebted to. I am, Sir, A Murdered Chinaman's Ghost.
