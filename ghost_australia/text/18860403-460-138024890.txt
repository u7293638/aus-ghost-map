PICTURESQUE VICTORIA. Bt "THE VAGABOND." LAKE TYERS. No. IL A night at Lake Tyers soothes the soul weary with the duties or pleasures of a city life—the endless strife for dollars, the struggle for fame or gain, the treadmill of society occupations. Sitting on the verandah of the good missionary's house, listening to blackfellows' lore as recounted by Mr. Bulmer, to tales of Maoriland from Mr. Morris, to pastoral trials from Mr. Sterling, I look over the lake, on which the moon casts deep shadows aud twinkling stars are reflected. All is calm and still. A primal peace possesses the night Suddenly the silence is broken. Loud and clear the cry rings over the waters— a "Coo- Iiaugh ! "— quite distinct from the Coo-e-e heard in other parts of Australia. A bright fire blazes up on the opposite bank. Through my glasses figures can be seen around the flames. "C'oo liaugld " again and again. What is the ex citement? A blackfellow takes over a small boat, and the outcome is that "Billy the Bull" delivers The Argus of this day for me at Mr. Bulmer's, sent by Mr. Durham from the Entrance, the first time in history that the same day's news has been read on Lake j Tyera. This forms an epoch to be con nected with my visit My friends, living at! Douglas Blay's opposite, say that the signal fire, and the shouts, aud Billy's en-1 thusiasm is as enthralling as any of George It Sims's plays. Our answering cries are plainly heard, and the effect is as interesting to them as to me. As the site for an aboriginal station, Lake Tyers for many years was unsurpassed in the colony. It had one great advantage in that it was far removed from any settlement and the attraction of grogshops. Mr. Buimer had every chance of working out the Church's scheme for the redemption of the black fellows' Bonis. Stray visitors came to the station, and recorded their impressions in the book from which I last week quoted the late bishop's opinions. I Bee many weil-known names. Here is the signature of my friend Monsieur Pesoli, of the French Consular Service, whom we miss so much at the Yorick, and hope some day to welcome back from San Francisco.' Here is the bold hand of a deceased Government official whom I first met in Fiji, where he soon acquired a character for madness through his desire to utilise his holiday by throwing off the clothes and restraints of civilisation and paseing his time vaka viti in the native huts.' fleas, oil, and a variety of choice smells thrown in. Here the Tom, Dick, and Harry of society have inscribed their1 names and recorded their impressions, mostly of a supremely idiotic class. What can an ordinary Mel bourne cockney know of the question of the treatment of our aborigines which has been a puzzle to philanthropists and practical politicians? Vet with a Bublime imperti nence Tom, Dick, and Hairy, and the females of their kind, scrawl their remarks over the visitors' bookt patronising Mr. and Mrs. Bulmer in, as it seems to me, a most offen sive manner. My -friend Mr. llicbard Speight has something to do with this. No doubt the most excellent and efficient and courteous chairman of our board of Railway Commissioners"will open his eyes when he reads this. Bat Mr. Speight as the father of the much-to-be-commenaed cheap summer excursions, has this year been the means of crowding the Lakes Entrance with visitors who nearly all come to Lake ff^ers, and when they get the chance leave their impressions thereon in writing. These daily visitors are really becoming a nuisance at the mission station. They interfere with the progress of the children in school Bessie Cameron iB made a show of by playing the harmonium in church for their benefit The blackfellows tie. to an extent demoralised by the presents of money—not, however, in all eases, for Mr. Speight's excursionists are many of them, like John Gilpin's wife, of a frugal mind. They take back with them as souvenirs the woven grass baskets, and talk about the blades for months afterwards. They have been amused, but the result as regardB the discipline oh the station is decidedly pre judicial. Lake Tyers was not established by the Go vernment and the Church of England Mis sion as a show place, an appanage to the hotels at the Lakes Entrance. Supported by the people, it is quite right that the station should be open to public inspection, but that should be at proper times and seasons. I quite agree with an idea promulgated in a conversation with Mr. Bulmer that one day a week should be set apart for visitors. Saturday, I suggest, would, be the best, as then the school would be closed, and Mr. Morris would have a better chance of grinding a tea' extra examination points out of his scholars than at present It is because I fully recognise all the difficulties Mr. Bulmer and Mr. Morris have to contend with that I would have the Aboriginal Board issue a peremptory order respecting the admission of visitors to Lake Tyers. On some stations this would not be required. At liamah-yuck the buildings are far away from the public road, and the church and Bchool and chil dren's boardinghouse are corralled off from the other buildings, and inside the fence casual visitors, unless quite commc il faut, would not be welcomed by Mr. Hagenauer. One other suggestion to the authorities, and I have done with my moralising. The present unalienated shores of Lake Tyers should be declared a national park, reserved to the public use for ever. The present aboriginal reserve extends inland along the shores of the arms of the lake stretching northwards from the promontory on which the station is situated. But east and west the shores of the lake arc not reserved, as I hold they should be. There are already three residences round the Lake. Douglas Blay's I have described. Mr. Stocks has a selection on the north-west arm, and Miss Morris a charming homestead on the south, the house facing the lake, the selection running to the ocean beach at the back. The Misses Morris receive boarders here during the summer months, and it would be hard to find a nicer place to stop at. There are two or three other selections under the old act on the shores of Lake Tyers. Xo more should be allowed ; all the laud at present unalienated should be added to the aboriginal reserve to become, when the blackfellows die off, a national park for the perpetual use of the people, the same as the Yosemite and Yellowstone parks in the United States. The land around the lake is of but little account except for residential purposes, no more charming sites can be found in the world, but I would not have them taken up by the select few but reserved for the enjoy ment of the many. The tired city man of the future should be entitled to his share in Lake Tyers, to fish in and shoot over the waters. Xo private proprietor should pre vent him having access to or camping on its shores; there Bhould be no barred pathways, as at Camperdown. I appeal to all lovers of Nature in the new Parliament to assist me in having Lake Tyers and its shores proclaimed a heritage for the enjoyment of the people. For fishing Lake Tyers cannot be sur passed. All the fish of the sea, the rivers, and lakes are here Bream bite freely. Dr. Hewlett and Mr. Jenkins have two or three days' rare sport with the rod and line. "Twenty-two dozen, on my honour as a Christian, not as a fisherman," says the Learned Clerk to me. The schnapper is also found in this inland water. I see one fine fish of this species caught by a blackfellow. But the best fun is with the "skipjack," or sea trout, the kari of the aboriginals. This is to be seen continually leaping out or dart ing along the surface of the waters. Its habits of feeding are like those of the pike, it "runs," as wc said in the English Midlands. So one trolls for the kari with a spoon-bait, or catches it with hand lines attached to a pullingor sailing boat To the "game fisher man "I Bhould imagine the kari offered ub much sport as a salmon. A truly wonderful sight at Lake Tyers for about a couple of hours every evening before sundown' 18 the nightly sport of the fi8h called by the natives "fat mullet," which then delights in jump ing from four to si* feet out of thewater.lp every direction, as far as jhe eye hundreds of these fish, evidently on pasUme bent, are to be seen taming (like P°rP°J*&l; complete summersaults out of their natural element The fat mullet is a really hand some gentleman, growing to 121b. in weight, but to the "gamefisherman keisamMt tantalising customer, for never yetj has be been taken with a hook. If some followeroi old Isaac Walton wishes to achieve for him self undying fame and glory, here w his chance. Only let him find out what cunning bait will tempt the fat mullet^ and wherever anglers assemble there wiu his name be revered. The sportamn who prefers the gun will see lots of ducks and swans on hake Tycra: it will depend, on his patience in following them up as to .whether he will get any. The broad stretch of lake between the Mission Station aud the narrow belt of sea beach shows why the black fellows called this li awiigatti, or bigwater, before it was named after Mr. Commissioner Tyers, but the arms running to east and west are the superior attraction from a picturesque point of view. It is up these arms, also, that the gunner will.follow duck or swan, ror myself, I have neither time for fishing nor shooting, besides I have grown out of the hunter stage of existence, the desire to kill for amusement, so I take neither gun nor rod with me when we start in Mr. Bulmers boat for an excursion up the Nowa Nowa, 01 north-east arm, accompanied for some dis tance by kind friends who have come to see the last of me before they return to^Mel bourne. It is 15 miles to the head of Nowa Nowa, and Mr, Bulmer sadly laments that 1 have not time to stop another day that we might camp out by Boggy Creek. But can t we get there and back to-day . I ask. Oh! no ! It has never yet been done. He make two davs of it when we go there. It is too much for the men to row in one. 1 look. ai the stalwart figures of the two carefully Go vernment- preserved aboriginals, Joe Bankf and Dick Cooper, who have the oars, ana speculate how much they would have been worth in " Ferginny m the old days. Then 1 remember that I have before time been complimented on my skill m ' nigger driv ing," and I reflect—'"my dear black brothert I'm going to get as much work as possible out of your dusky bides to-day." We row eastwards across the central pool of Lake Tyers. Hounding a point, and we have lost sight of the Mission Station and the shining belt of sand which separatesit from the ocean, and are in anothei land locked sheet of water. Ihe course is im neded by vast masses of water weeds, but there are good, deep channels, through which Mr. Bulmer steers the boat. My Melbourne friends leave me, one of our crew favouring them with a "Voo-hawjh! as a send-off. 1 find that this cry is much more piercing than the "C'oo-e-e" of the ordinary blacktedow. Past an island, and we are journeying north wards along the east coast of the peninsula on which the mission reserve is situated. AU is quiet and still, save for the note of the bell bird or the rustle of the wingsofwater fowl flying overhead. The banks of the lake arc clothed with a thick scrub, peppermint aud cherry trees, hazel and wattle, pittoS porum aud supplejack, and tall gums ana messmate, with a variety of ferns in the un dergrowth. Nature is all primal about here. The kangaroo, and the waliaby, and the emu are stilt to he met with in the reserve. A fine young emu was recently run down by the blackteilows, and is now perfectly tame, and lord of Mrs. Bulmer's poultry-yard. But my attention is confined to the waters. I have no desire to leave the boat to mepect the beauties or curiosities of the bush. As we go onwards we leave one lake to emerge into another. This is the north arm of the Lakes Entrance on an enlarged Bcale. Ihe series of quiet pools and deep bays are most beautiful in form aud outline. This has been compared to Port Jackson, and on a small scale is not unlike the Middle Harbour there; but the foliage on the shores here is more luxuriant All in all, one is at every mile convinced that the waters of Tyers form the "gem of lake land. There is nothing I have yet seen can surpass them. Pleasant, indeed, it is to be rowed along on ' this hot summer day, aud listen to tales or early work amongst the aborigines from Mr. Bulmer, the greatest authority on the man ners and customs of our natives 1 have yet met; and whilst he thus entertains and instructs me I encourage my black brothers, by word and song to put their shoulders to the oar. But they hang their heads dolefully when I sing. They are not used to high class music. Our black rowers are not very mncb inclined for work on this hot day, f®1 which I do not blame them. In their place, I would drop the oars. But it is my place to keep them at it Joe Banks professes to have a slight cold, and drinks a pannikin of the salt waters of the lake as a cure. I remember how the inland Papuans who came to Port Moresby took copious draughts from the sea, aud wonder at the eame custom being prevalent here, lery little fresh water runs into Lake Tyers. It is always brackish and unfit to drmK. InoW days the natives about here camped at tuf head of Lake Bunga, which was otherwise known as Lane Beak, or good water, in con tradistinction to the salt of Lake Tyers. At the Mission Station at the present time there would be a difficulty in respect to water if any prolonged drought occurred, as Mr. Bui mer's large tank would not then hold out for the requirements of all the inhabitants. So on a voyage up Nowa Nowa ,we have to be careful where we land to make our micFday meal off the plentiful Bupply of good things Mrs. Buliner nas provided- But we manage to find a place near which there iB a water hole. Dick fetches a hillyful, and the bush beverage of Australia is prepared. But I do not let Dick and Joe stop long here, but worry them and Mr. Buliner to continue the journey. Getting the hlackfellows at the oars into conversation, I make them for a time forget that they are working hard. I listen to the complaints of one that he has no house, and is compelled to sleep out under a whb* mia, and assure him that they shall be duly recorded. Then I myself get interested, re specting the m'raat, plural m'rajti, the spirits which were supposed to hauut the shores of this lake. Do they believe in the nCrajU f They have never seen one themselves, Btill it is evident Joe and Dick have faith in these spirits. But English country hinds also i believe in ghosts. There is scarcely a village in which yon will not find a labourer who at least knows or knew some one who has had a view of a disembodied spirit. There are yet scores of conntry places in Great Britain of evil repute in whioh Hodge after night fall— " Doth walk in tour and dread And having once looked round Walks on, and turns no more his head Because he feus a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread." No 1 Joe and Dick have not seen a m'raai neat Lake Tyers, but they have a well authenticated record of people who have; ft not the grave of a white man who was killed near here haunted ? Is not his spirit at tunes seen, round the like jumping up and down, whistling and dancing, holding a covroboovte ill to hhsseii? 1 suggest that this if recr snlike vhst the seen: o-i t white- esse vps&i; ±c»; that it bss t« thst -oi a Hackiei#?*. who. as their o&i; eat© vt'EE teii thess- aiwv* ".WEsped cp *rite ir-'ovs. TP_:s is a prv&lem; for Joe a->i P.ck to s.x*e; I h*c* trtsiified a shsie .£ d.-*l-t Irto fie-ir better in the a'mi i -' Yfeey ire or ersifliij fKti&f; vert tired oi p«.;iit£_ i&i; res the toat Kviet the saade cd c&e; tree; oe tc>? bank. sad mtke s ftHa&s; or sfetrsg Ssa.
