THAVELiliKti. STARVING WHAVEB3. Ahsnt 300 milss Jcom the Qhjrman oantte^ in the northern part of the provinte of Biliasia, ' there is a line of low hills oalled the Hay- j stack Mountains. Scattered among -iheie i hfllftj some times, in villages and again in deb taohed and isolated log oabins, ate to be found abont d000 .people, who are oallad the Hunger- Mansohen— human beings whoneVnr have enough to eat. Their bnsinoss is hand loom weaving, and it bas been carried on so ltag on starvation wages that their bodies : have shrunk andjdwindled until the anthro pologist may almost classify them as a separate species of the human family. Most of these weavers live in the little country of Glata, but a few hours' ride from Breslau, and Goldhach is-the Schandfieck or shame spot of German v. It waB aeold, rainy April morning that Kyborg and I ' ollmbM from Rfmers to tbe rooad 'plateau ,on whioh the miseimble little hamlet is situated. In about 30 minutes of stiff climbing we reached the top, and Goldbach lay before us. Its low cabins were strung along both sides of tbe roadway for nearly half a mile, and even from where we stood we could hear the monotonous cliok-olaok of the long line of looms. Some little children ran into the cabins to make known our arrival. The -oliok clsok stopped for a moment, and ghost-like, faces peered out of the windows. . Snoh withered human beings I had never seeu be* fore. ( Their eyes were tttinken and dull, atid the skin on their faces, when not sickly white, was of a dingy yellow hue. They looked out npon us bt .wildered, and then. ' fell baok to j their looms, and the olick-olaok began afresh. We wandered on to the Mid of the hamlet and then back' to the* inn; and foe only* livings creatures we saw' were the' -children alid the faoes in tbe window. There was not a horse : or dog. anywhere, in sight, £nd the impres sion the little village gate us was that of an isolated settlement shut'; off from human , sympathy and even deserted by the domestic animals. Herr Sammek, the mayor, was a wrinkled kittle man, h*»dly up to my Moulder and there was a worried look in'his fate whioh I had 'not hblio^i among the other villagers. It comes, I fancy, from his weary ing efforts to oollect village taxes. He was anxious . that we should have bis Offieial statement of the oase. Goldbach, he said, was the poorest plate in the entire; district. There are heady a hundred weavers in the village, -and they /just hardy exist. In the Bohemian -speaking Tillages farther to the west, the weavers have always had the alternative of working in the woods or at their looms aa they chose, and the; are oon seqnently better situated. In Goldbach, however, this ohoioe has nevflr existed, and the villagers are so weak and unacons tomed to outdoor labour that they simply cannot undertake it. All that they are oap- - able of is a little work in their gardens and 1 weaving, and the competition with mac hines is so gzeat that their cloth must be sold at the very lowest prioes. The Government in 1862 bought the land in Goldbach and reeold it to the weavers cn the instalment plan, eaeh settler promising to ' ' pay fife marks a year on his lot till the debt , was canoelled. Before that time the village had hesn in the hands of large land pro prietors,' and it was purchased from them in tbe hope tha* personal ownership of house and garden would give the weaver a new impetus to ; work. Had there been enough wotc few them this hope, no doubt, would have been realised, but band-loom weaving is arfltttle in demand to-day that the lots are still unpaid 'for. The average annual in come of a family of eight persons is not more I than 400 marks, or less than £20.. This is 4 | supposed to cover all expenses, and it' is not ; baxa tonnderstand why there are so many: mortgages. The main kinds of weaving done in Goldbach are shirtingis, handker chiefs, sheets, ahd ticking. A middleman, livtngin Reiner*, fnrnishes the raw stuffs, and then buys theoloth at a valuation agreed upon beforehand. ' The Government has also had some work done here, but as it usually wants towels for the anny, and the 'weavers are too weak to do snbh heavy weaving, the middleman is the main employer. If there is a flaw in the cloth returned to him it is hot paid for, and a'case iskno* n where a woman worked two weeks on some sheetings and all payment for die cloths delivered was refnsed because of some little mistake. Tho bill of fare in the village Varies a little in the differ- . ent cabins; but ini the main it consists of rye coffee, rye bread, and meal^ A queer mix ture 6f, dough and ineal is the favorite dish for Sundays. Potatoes are eaten when cheap ? enough;'.' Most of. the , weavers have little: gardens where they can raise all the vege tables they can, but their lots are so small ; that they have no xopmyfor large crops. Their potatoes give ' butT yeiy early in the . winter. Meat is sddom^secb. Herr Sammek. has it once a week, but he earns an extra .160 . marks a year for his public services, and can afford it. The others get a taste of £t oqce ? :in six months.' ' grater', part of tlie .

We saw but six children, -and asked where the rest iWdre. ' In tho graveyard, he returned, and X fancied -that i.I saw a look of thankfuluess on his face. 'I don't want oharity,' ho. ?explained, ' hut I do tbisk they might give mo work. If I had enough to do I oould feed my children on bread at least, but now I can't earn over three maiks a week. Tbatra the reason the other ohildren rdiod. They weren't siok— no ouo getr sick 'here— they just -got thinner ana thinner and wittier away.1 Our next call was at a cabin on the outskirts of the village, where the father -supplemented bis loom earnings by odd jobs at plastering and whitewashing. He was away at the time trying to find work ?in Reinerfe, bnt the mother with her four ohildren received ni. I was struck in this home by the off cots of the life on the older jahildren. As I hare said, the little ones in the village were generally health* , but in this last oabin there was a lad of 17 years who looked as if he oould not be more than 12\. Bis faoe was pinohed and drawn, and he moved abont so listlessly that I thought he. must be ill. His mother, however, m surred me that that was only his way. His sister, a girl of 16) although not so thin, looked equally unfit for the work, and baa the saddest face for her age that I have ever. seen but of her, too, the another said it was only the way of the child. . At all of the' other cabins we heard.. praotaoslly the same story. The looms wero always clicking, and the ohildren were either spooling or peeling potatoes. V
