THE RAILWAY GHOST. A HORSE OR A BUSH? Nothing more has been seen lately of the ghost which is alleged to have promenaded the railway line between Lithgow station and Albert- street. It looks as if his "spookship" must have got wind that the police were on his track. Anyway, when the stalwart and ever-alert Senr.-constable Burns was on the lookout, last Thursday night, on the viaduct near Lithgow station, no ghost put in an appearance. In stern and solitary vigil Const. Burns' night-watch passed away, his labor being spent for nought. Const. Bell, the latest addition to the local force, was also in the vicinity, ready at any moment to do or die in a valiant attempt to capture his ghostship. But he also was doomed to disap- pointment, and visions of fame in this direction passed away as a morning mist before the rising sun. Statements vary considerably as to the ap- pearance of the alleged apparition. One eye- witness avers that the figure was that of a man, about 6ft. or 7ft. high — but whether he wore a "flogger" coat or a "sac " made by one of our local tailors, he (the eye-witness, not the ghost) was unable to say. He was further described as being slight of figure, but opinions differ on this point. It has been said—by some incredulous and malevolently-disposed person—that the appari- tion was created by "Fred" Sharpe's grey horse, but this statement is indignantly denied by eye- witnesses, Others have it that the ghost was only a bush, and that since it was cut down no further sign has appeared of Monsieur Spook. This also is ridiculed by those who have been favored with a view.
