THE INTERCOLONIAL CRICKET M ATCH. dnsLaDn, Tuesday. TuE South Australians resumed their ecoond in nings to.day in the preoese of a fair attendance. Theo weather was tropioal. Reedman took his esore to 73, when Dontan brought about his downfall. Roeedman played stoerling oricket, and did not give the ghost of a chaence. Ris performance was most meritorious, and the fieldmen bshowed unomiotak able joy at his removal. When New South Wales in their second innings had three wickets down for 32 Jones jumped out to the ball from Jones, tbhe South Adelaide fast bowler. The leatheor rebounded from Jarvis's pads, and the university man weas out. Boon after the same bowler sdattered Moses's wicoet eitb a beautiful boll. Gregory mude 13, when Giffen, who was trundling well, caught him off his own bowlin:r. A stand was made between Bannerman and Donnan. The latter made 20, when he got out in the same way as Gregory. Ho played splendid oricket. Bannerman was stone walling in his own partincular way, and for an hour contented himself with playing Giffen back, not adding even a vinalo to hie tally during that period. At last he got the South Australian eaptain beauti fully to leg for 4. Youill shaped nicely until a fa?t one upset his calculations--five for 80. Banner man played with dogged dcfenee until time, although five minutes before time Giffen was asup posed to have osught and bowled him. Mr. Searoy gave it as not out.
