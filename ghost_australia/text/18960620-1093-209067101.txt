BIJOU THEATRE. Another large and appreciative audience greeted Hudson's Surprise Party at the Bijou Theatre on Friday evening, when the final presentation of the opening programme was successfully made. This evening an entire change of programme will be given, the songs to be rendered in the first part being " Will-o' the- Wisp," Mr. A. Holland; " Assortments," Miss Ida Rosslyn ; "My pipe" (from Rip Van Winkle), Miss Marie Alston; "The g'enteel colored pair," Messrs. McKisson and Kearns ; "Occupations," Miss Emmie Morrison; "Don't get weary," Mr. T. Hudson; and " The diver," Miss Onslow Mackay; the curtain falling on M. Provo's "Shadowgraphs extra ordinary." In the second part, Miss May Habgood will play Godard's mazurka, "Suite de Danses," and "Erin," a transcription on Irish airs. Mr. Hudson will contribute " baujoistic" effusions, and M. Provo will repeat his clever juggling feats. Mr. Harry Shine will sing "For the sake of the little ones at home" and, for the first time in Adelaide, "For me." Miss Emmie Mor rison will appear in serio-comic specialties, Messrs. McKisson and Kearns as " The Zulu cranks," and Miss Ida Rosslyn in a vocal and terpsichorean specialty "Birds and Butter flies." The amusing sketch " The Pneumatic Eradicator" will also be presented, and the performance will conclude with "The Ghost of Thompson." A crowded house is antici pated.
