ORIGINAL POETRY. Lines picked up at Stockton, supposed to have been written by D. R, respecting his late speech at the oddfellows' dinner. I know I have done myself brown as a toast, With remorse I'll grow thin as a kangaroo's ghost; To peace I'm a stranger, myself I can't bear, Since the time that I spoke so unkind of the fair. My conscience was twitching the time I was speaking, And I felt that my organ of courage was leaking; So you see that I did not mean all that I said, Nor yet could support all that I to them laid. 'Twas my own sex that vex'd me, but to them durst not spout, / Or they quickly, you know, would have turned me out; So I turned on the ladies because none were there To defend their own cause, or disfigure my hair. But since I have thought that I should have stood true Regardless of what my sex could or would do; I know that my peace is quite at an end, Till the ladies forgive me and own me their friend. This I trust they will do, and in oblivion dead, Sink all that I may against them have said; If this they will do, I'll reform by my life, And before very long will take one for a wife: Then here's for a wife C. and H., what say you, To a bachelor's life for ever adieu.
