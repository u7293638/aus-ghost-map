St. Saviour's Cathedral, Goulburn. The ceremony of laying the headstone, celebrating the completion of the stonework of St. Saviour's new Cathedral, Goulburn, commenced on the 16th January, 1874, was per formed on Wednesday, 29th March (says the Herald), in the presence of a large congregation, who at 10 a.m. as sembled in the pro- cathedral, where a shortened form of service appropriate to the occasion was used. The Bishop of Goulburn, Dr. Thomas, the Venerable Archdeacon Pud dicombe, Canon Soares, the Rev. G. M. D'Arcy- Irvine, and the Rev. J. L. Taylor were among those present. At the conclusion of the service the congregation, followed by the Bishop and clergy, and school children, went to the new building, where a platform was erected, on which the Bithop and clergy, the Chancellor (the Hon. C. Campbell), and Mr. Joplin^ treasurer of the building fund, took their seats, and afterwards (by invitation from the Bishop), Mr. John Davidson, Mr. Holborow, Dr. Sly, Mr. Rossi, the Mayor, and Mr. Blacket, The last stone was lowered into position, the Bishop declaring it so placed ia the faith of Jesus Christ and to the glory of the Holy, Eternal, and Undivided Trinity, the Father, the Sod, and the Holy Ghost. The Bishop called upon tbe treasurer, Mr. Joplin, who made a report of the' financial condition of the building fund. £14,S00 had been received from all sources, and £15,530 expended. This, with £700, represented the entire cost of the building so far as it is now completed, and they would see left a debt of about £1400 ; but against this he had some promissory notes, and the Bishop had 6ome promises, so that they might consider they had paid for the work already done. The com mittee had become responsible for a cash credit of £5000. He thought about £10,000 would complete the entire work, including cost of the tower. The Bishop of Goulburn, Dr. Thomas, then delivered a lengthy address.
