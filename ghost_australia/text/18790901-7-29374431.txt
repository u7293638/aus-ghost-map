Tbomaj. Ttoa 6Usfic\oji o| «tt *wenan-s gmit was overwhelmingly strong, and | ttni confirmed by a large body of evidence. The theory of a men eonoealment of natural death with a view to fnadalent gun is a possible one, but it is only a theory alter all, and the oooolorioo the Jary came to was almo*-; inevitable. On hearing the verdict tbe> prisoner beteme mncb agitated, and made a ctatement I which, wnflawithdrmirinc the •cr t qMLtino««he j bad iwufe against Church eae Porter, the men who bought the daeeased lady's furniture .she reasserted her nujoeence, sad charged the crime of insider upon the father of her illegitimate child, for whom the eew oo reason that she should suffer titefienaU'f of death. She did not, however, name tbaioanm Court, though she has minee done ao in ? tons; narrative which can hardly help her case. After the dread asntenee had been. psssoil aha urged a plea in stay oi execution whl?u a Jury of matrons, empannelled in Court, decided to be without foundation. The unhappy creature'* fortitude then gave way entirely, and the warden bore her oat of the dock. Her fate excites little sympathy, her abominable falsehoods betrayiog a selfish readi Beat to sacrifice others which make* pity im possible. Another distinguished personage has fallen a victim to the inclemency of the season, the Oonntesa of Waldegrave dying on the Sth in stant from an attack of pneumonia. Th ■ deceased lady was in her earlier years renowned for her beauty, as she was during the whole of her life fer her wit, generosity of heart, and social graces, which made her receptions at Strawberry HUl(Horace Wilpole'a residence) the most brilliant and successful of any in London. In tie exercise of hur hospitality there is no doubt the deceased count****, by her ian> tact and iatelligenoe, did real service far the liberal party. Her career was not without a certain remaned. She was a daughter o'-John Snhain, tbe great singer, and was married four trmte In 1836, at the age of seventeen, she wedded Mr. WtMegrare, her second husband being Earl WalAegrave. her third Mr. O. G. Vemon Harconrt,and her fourth Lord Carling fbrd. who survive* her. All lovers of English music will regret to learn of" the death of Mr. Henry Smart, the well known cwnpoawr and organist, in the sixty eerentliTeexof his age. He was a nephew of Sir George Smart, for many years organist and com poser to Her Maiestr's Chapels Boyal,andwas the eon of a nolinist and orchestral leader of repute. Thus strongly imbued with hereditary talent, Kr. Smart afforded a notable instance of the triumph of genius over apparently unsur aountable djf?wiltieii. Although blind, he was one of the finest organ-players of the day, and that kno snail distinction in aa age when his art has roaches! a perfection never before equalled, sad In a country where it may be foond in its highest development. It was a rare pleasure to hear hi* improvisation, of which he «ave a remarkable example hut year at the Paris Exhibition, when he performed on the grand organ for half an hour, with oar National Anthem as the foundation of his theme, to a crowd of At*lfp<*?A French musicians. His jwrt amp, too, are doset yodty popular. Only a few weeks ago, in recognition of his services to music, he was granted a pension of £100 on Her Majesty's Civil List—too late to be of use to him. Aa I have before intimated, the agricultural Interest is at length bestirring itself in good earnest.' The newly-formed "Farmers' Alli ■aoVkavesfaengthened their schemes at an important conference at Exeter Hall, and a great meeting of Baser farmers have solemnly invoked* file ghost of protection, with a result akin to that of calling spirits from the vasty deep. This week the Royal assent has been given to the appointment of a SelecKOommittee to enqaire into the present depreaaed condition of agriculture, and we are *^minHf«l of an at tempt to procure legislative assistance for the taiiuewMlWSajwben things weieWu a similarly pitiable plight. Nothing was dime then, and a cut (Marian of favorable years fotmed the best solution of the problem. Our farmers would lie happy if they could indulge in a hope of the sue mode of escape from their present troubles; bat the wretched weather, which has made spring miserable, and spoiled the Agri cultural Show at Kflbura, threatens to spoil the crops intotbe bargain. We are constantly tan tafind with" signs n of summer, but the reality does not arrive. Although prayers for fine -weather toe btasgeffered up in the churches, the liey, seemingly, ia past praying for, and unless ire soon get warm days and cloudless skies, the grain eropa w3I cot a very poor figure indeed. THE SOOTH AUSTRALIAN GAS COMPANY'S WORKS, BROMPTON. A psrtv consisting of over a hundred gentle men, including a large number of members of awthbranches of the IggMatnra Cseveral mem bers of the Ministry being among them) and many other prominent citizens, paid a visit to Ihe premises of ihe Sooth Australian Gas Com pany, at Btumptim, on Saturday afternoon, August 30. The principal occasion of the visit wa* the turning of the first sod of a piece of ground on which the Company are about to erect a new gasholder, but the proceedings of ihe day also included an inspection of the works, *o which improvements have been recently made, and the indidgemce in various refrash «nent? provided for the visitocs by tfa? Directors, so which there was the usual accompaniment of speeches. The"gaspkaiio l "asitwasfacet)OUBly Jtermed by one of the party, was thoroughly enjoyed by all who attended, and to ike shareholders especially the ganeral appear ance of the works must have given the greatest satisfaction. The party were conveyed from Adelaide to Bowdenby a special train, which started at US pal, and on their arrival sjuuua?e the Company's premises were eon dtSed over the works by Mr. Anderson, the engineer, who in a dear mnA intonating manner explained to aQ who -were fortunate in being able to'keep near mm the various prncossjui con seetedwith the manufacture of coal-gas. On catering the yatd the visitors wen shown a short sUing from the Fort Bail way, along which eeal is brought in trucks, and afterwards when j it has served its purpose taken back in the farm , of cake. The tracks are shifted on to the siding 4y means of a turntable, At the end of the siding tbefraoktap?lowered by tneL" own weight ttojhelei-elof the paved yard, so that loeaW ; aidnnloadingoan be proeeeded with easily-a^ 1 ••*■' ktibwii- ?«*• .. -- -?ue*a •— --, •"• is used to raise them again. About 30,000 thousand tons of coal and coke passed over the siding during the last twelve months. The party were next shown a new retort-house, which is 250 feet in length and 65 feet in height, and has been c t eii Bid recently in consequence of the increased •flf"t* for gas. It has been designed to hold tbzee-sstaof retorts, but only one of thesshas sMsmstte&up; at present, although the others —"Biflsj reedy for nee when need arise*. These niatsi ere provided with six furnaces, and c?n tahi all tbe latest isaprovementa, including lids which ere snjf-rioaing, In the second retort boose the visitors were shown the process by which the mannas bodies contained in the coal re released aid carried away—first for purifica tioa and subsequently to the gasholder far etorage. The fnreaces supply the heat, and l(r. Anderson took oae of the atoppeaont to give some idea of the intense beat required for the I aVuuis slhsi of gas from the coal contained in the -retorts. The visitors were then takeoorer the third retort-house, which is similar to the last, and were shown the place where the gas, after leaving the retort*, is cooled. From each retort there is a tobe entering a- cylinder onptaiaing water, in which -fchetor andotber maislimjoriginally heldina -vapor condense, ead are grart roily removed. The tar trickles fasn the slain, as the cylinder is called, into a well, and the gas is passed thsough a series of pipes known as the een dems?E, where more of she moisture still held in. the fora of vpnwbv reason of the high tempe rature is nspseelr i from the gas, Theoondanaer is exposed to the air, aad jdoU water is played «-ra it ia s?derto.eeawt.ine process of separa tum. Thewext piece visited we*•house een taining uilieiewns aaed foe tiM purpose of re lieving tibe a**** from tke pressure of the gaa- Jtolders. B>s?a)eo there are two ateam boilers, eoe of wUeh jejn use for daring the exhausters sod the other is m reserve. The pwrineatkm Howes in all ita stem was «ext explained. After lmrin«theexhaa*teai the oooledgas passes through the purifier, a eeries of layers composed either of slaked lime or oxide of iron. ThU pro cess is icouired for the removal of sulphuretted tydiogen.carhenie eeid,and other impurities, which detract from the illuminating power of nuel gss seaarriing to the amount in which they areco?Wiaedinit,end it is the object of all lnaoufactorers, as far at possible, to separate shew from tke gat before it is taken for storage totheboldaes. From this part of the works the party proceeded to a place where a gas meter lot totting the illuminating power of the gas is kept, and next to a room wtaere two large gat station meter* an situated. When the purin «■«?• pea oast i* completed the gat is carried •way to the gas-holders, which are known to ao*tpen*nsM usa*onieteri.'' The holder u a lane beU-fike structure, made of wrougfat-iron, sad inverted in a tank of water, in which it either rises or falls. The South Australian Gas Oompany have at present two of these gas faoJdcM. One is 100 feet in diameter and 38 feet ia height, holding 230,000 eubie feet of gas, and the other is 70 feet in diameter and W feet in height, holding 70,000 cubic feet. A new gas holder has been shipped from England, and may >e expected to arrive in about six week*. Some, I !<3ea oi Its sise may be gathered from the fact that with the tank it wifl occupy about aa acre of ground. It is constructed on what is known as the telescopic principle, being formed in two J cylinder* fitting into each other like the slides of a telescope, an arrangement by meant ot : which better regulation of the pressure is secured. The holder wul be ISO feet in diameter bj 60 feet in height, and its storage capacity will be a million cubic feet, or consider ably more than four times as great as that of the larger gasholder now in use. There will be 855 tons of ironwork in it, and the tank will contain four million gallons of water, ijt., four times as much as the North Adelaide service reservoir. The whole work, including the pur chase of gasholder and tank, would if carried out in England cost about £30,000. and it is hoped that no greater expenditure may be incurred in the erection here. The freight alone will cost £1.000, and the work of erection will take probably more than a year. Before leaving the inspection of the works men tion must be made of the governor, through which the gas passes before it enters the main and is thence supplied through various pipes to the consumers. This apparatus, as well as the coal-houses and various machines used for test ing the quality of gas and detecting in it the amount of those gaseous substances which mare or less affect its illuminating power, were examined by the party before the more formal business of the day was proceeded with. After the inspection an adjournment was made to the site of the new h >lder, woich is a piece of laud situated some few hundred feet away from the Company's work*. The site takes in an old pug-hole, to use a term particularly lamiliar to the M ffindrnvrHh bricks," and this fact, which is as advantage, as lessening the quantity of excavation otherwise required, was taken into consideration by the Directors when the land was purchased. The formal ceremony of tuning the first sod was performed by Sir Hbkbt Atb&b;, MJLC. (Chairman of ihe Board of Directors). Before *"«*™g use of the shovel he explained in a few well-chosen remirks the nature of the work to be carried eat, and stated that the gasholder which it wsa proposed to place in the tank would be four times as large as the largest the company had seen that after noon. The largest gasholder in the world had been constructed by the Phoenix Gas, Ooke, and . Light Oompany at TfuMflgfrm, near London, and was capable of storing 3,100,000 cubic feet of gas, or three times as much as the new bolder now on its way to this colony for the South Australian Qsa Oompany. It was matter for great satisfaction that the Oompany had secured such a business that a new holder was required, in the advantages given by which the general public would have their share. Sir Henry proceeded to refer to the wonderful progress made in the methods of illuminating streets and houses since the introduction of gas. which, as some one in a neighboring colony had said, was, after all, only ** bottled sunshine,'' coal being a vegetable substance buried in the earth ages ago, and storing up the rays of the sun which lighted the world in those remote periods, only to give them up—preserved sun beams as they were—when required for the purposes of a modem race. Sir Henry then applied the shovel in the proper way, bending to hi* work bo lustily that he was loudly cheered. The earth was removed by another Director, Mr. 8. Tomkinson, J.P., whoso endangered his equilibrium as he seized bold of the wheel barrow that a facetious MJ*. felt constrained to remark that" the banker bad lost his balance,* an observation which provoked great marriment. From the site of tee aew holder the parly wended their way bad: to the works, where provision had been made far refreshments. Before them were indulged in, however, the visitors inspected a new kind of lamp <tM?g«n?rt to compete with the elscteic light. It is knownes Sugg's London patent Argand burner, and gives a light equal to that of IDO sperm candles. The illuminating power of the ordinary street gas lamp is about that of eighteen **Ji«i. so that some idea of the great brilliancy of the light furnished by Sugg's burner can be readily formed. The lamp is made of white reflecting glass, and is provided with a tall chimney similar to that of a kerosine burner. It is said to be seven and a half times cheaper to use than the electric light. On an adjournment, being made for refreshments glasses were charged, and the sentiment "Success to the Gas Company" was proposed by Sir John Mobfhktt. In responding to the toast, Sir Hekby Atbes pointed out that the success oi the Company bid not been achieved without some difficulty, but that only made it the more satisfactory, since easily won vio tories were never thought much oL He spoke of the difficulty experienced in getting the whole of the required capital subscribed, and said it was satisfactory to know that the Com pany had made it* way in spite of all obstacles, and now supplied to die people of Adelaide and the neighborhood a better light than they had before and at a cheaper rate. The Oompany carbonised 60 tons of coal per week, and ex- They were now providing extra storage accom modation in order to meet increased flin«iflf_ The don. W. Hobgax (Ohief Secretary) gave the health of the Engineer (Hr. Anderson), of whose energy he spoke in glowing terms. He remarked that after visiting such beautiful and well-conducted gasworks as those of the Oompany they could not go beak to town and see the kerosine lamps without looking upon them as a disgrace to the colony. The toast having been drunk witheheers, Mr. Akdbrsoh responded in suit able terms. Mr. TV. G. Bum (Mayor of Ade laide) said as the question of lighting the Oity with kerosine bad been raised he would like to make a few remarks. When the Gas Oompany sent in their tender Car the lighting of the Cor poration lamps the Council considered that tile enhanced price, which was IS per cent, greater than what had been previously paid, was more than they ought to give for the gas. Various [ letters passed between the Oompany and the Council, and up to the but moment the latter , were anxious not to change the kind of light , then in use. But the Oompany were firm, and the Corporation, thinking the rate proposed was an overcharge, determined to go back to an inferior light. A meeting of the dtisens was called, however, and it was explained that the ordinary twopenny rate would not pay for gas, ana that if the tender of the Company Weresuepteda ttoeepeui;; «*■ would be re quired. Notwithstanding this exnlauatwu the meeting egreed to no more than the twopenny rate, and the Corporation were compelled there fore to fefrre the cheaper light. The bulk of the Corporation were in favor of having gas, but the proposition to accept the Company's offer was lost, there being one Councillor absent from the meeting held to consider it. Nobody more than himself regretted that the street* Were not i lighted with gas, a&d; he trusted that next year I better arrangement* would be made, and that | if the city bad not the electric light it would have the next best thing—gas. Sir Hesbt Aoebs pointed ont that tibe rate which the Oom pany proposed to charge the city for gas was fixed as nearly u possible on the basis of what ' was charged to individual citizens. Whenever i the Corporation should become tked of the luxury of kerosine the Oompany would be J happy to supply them with gas at the same price , as they charged for lighting *fa? shops oc the citizens. The Hon. Hz, Kosaur said bis re- i mark was made more" in the way of regret than of fault-finding. The proceedings then ter minated, aad the party returned to town by a special train shortly before 6 o'clock.
