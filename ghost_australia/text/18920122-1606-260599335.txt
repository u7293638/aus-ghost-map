THE YILGARN RAILWAY. »— SPEECH BY MR. PIESSE, M.L.A. TFROM THE " DAILY NEWS."] MR. PIESSE resumed the debate of Mr. Parker's proposed amendment of clause 2 for striking out the word " Northam " with a view to inserting other words. In supporting the amendment, he said Albany could not to) fairly regarded as a port competing against Fremantle for the goldfields traffic. The House should consider that a great deal of the traffic would come from the most northern portion or the Great Southern Railway, besides passenger traffic to and from the eastern colonies by way of Albany The extra 27 miles of haulage would be as much a hardship to the settlers along the Great Southern Railway as would be the extra 15 miles to the more northern settlers if the line went by way of York. If Newcastle and Toodyay were such productive districts as Mr. Clarkson had said, why should not these districts send their produce to Perth and Fxemantle as their nearest market and leave Yilgarn to be served by the settlers in the York, Beverley and more southerly districts, as an inducement to increased settlement ? The Northam route would pass through marshy country, and great expense would be reqnired for flood embankments, as he knew from his experience of the country. The Great Soutnern railway was looked on to some extent as not belonging to the colony but although owned by a private company it was a work of great importance and value in developing the resources of the colony He hoped the House would consider that portion of the southern districts which he represented. r THE Daily News describing the scene in the House at the conclusion of the debate on the Yilgarn Railway question, says : " The Premier with his solid majority sat impassive and did not even condescend to reply and when the division bell was rung there were 19 Northamites (Ministerialists) and 9 Yorkltes, the former being too much ashamed of themselves to raise even the ghost of a cheer over their victory."
