Entertainments. "Diplomacy" was performed for the fourth time at the Theatre Royal last night, and it was surprising to find the house only moderately attended. The nature of the play, and the truthful delineations of human character incidental to it, ought to attract a better audience even on a showery night. Pilot essor Pepper's entertainment last night was honoured by the presence of his excellency the Governor, Miss Kennedy, and suite., The illustrations of torpedoes and the advantage of the electric light in modern warfare were very clearly exhibited. The ghostly illusions were capitally rendered, and the dancing skeleton was especially amusing. To-night the professor announces a feast of ghosts, and a number of the very interesting views presented last night will be again introduced. On Saturday night the professor's benefit is announced, and he deserves a substantial recognition from the public. He has introduced many very interesting scientific subjects here, and made them popular by his humorous style. * The Coätnorama was fairly attended at the Town Hall last night. At the close of the entertainment all of the audience received a present, the gold watch going to Miss Ross, of the Valley, and the silver watch to Mr. Welsh, representative of a Sydney firm. The entertainment will be ?ÊiA to'niSht and to-morrow night, and on the latter occasion a suite of furniture and a tea service are to be given away.
