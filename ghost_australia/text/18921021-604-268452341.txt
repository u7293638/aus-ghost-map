THE JAPANESE M.P. Japan lias borrowed Parliamentary institutions, amongst other luxuries, from the West ; anil, since human imluro under all skins is pretty much .the sumo, the Japanese M.P. quickly develops all flu! familiar vices of the iAT.it*. under other skies. Ho “ wobbles'’ and “ dodges hi' “sits on a fence;” lie joins witli his fellow legislators in “ log-rolling ” iiarfor mances on the largest scale; andhaving once secured his seat, he calmly ignores his constituents until the next election is in sight. Hut Japanese constituents deal faithfully with their guilty representatives According to Mr Budynrd Kipling, ‘‘a Itadicnl Member of Parliament at'Tokio lias just got into trouble with his constituents, and they have sent him a priceless letter of reproof. Among other things, they point, out that a politician should not be • a. waterweed, which wobbles hither and thither according to tint mo tion of the stream.' Nor should ho ' like a ghost, without legs, drift along beforo the wind.’ ‘ Your conduct,’ thoy say, ‘ has been that; of both a water weed and a ghost, and we purpose in a little time to give you proof of our true Jupnncso spirit.”' This particular member of Parliament, Mr Kudynrd Kipling reports, “will very probably bn mobbed in bis ’rickshaw and prodded to iiiconveuieneo with sword- slicks ; for iho constituencies are most enlightened. But how in tho world enn a man under these skies belmve ex cept ns a waterweed ami a ghost; It is in tho air—tho wobble and tho legless drift.”Cliimitcdoos,nodoubt.a(l'ectvirtuo, in a most surprising manner ; but have wo not amongst ourselves honorablo mombors who rcsnmblu “drifting water woods” and “legless ghosts,” even without the poor excuse of the enervating Japanese climate ? It is in tho air, even in this colony—“tho wobble and the leg less dri,t ’’—and who alascan invent ^a euro for it? Theso Tolrio radicals, how ever, lmvo at least enriched the political vocabulary by ono or two delicious phrases.
