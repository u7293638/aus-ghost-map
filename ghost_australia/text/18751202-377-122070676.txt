THA ULOUUUD-TAB. BT PAUL H. HATNz. Far up within the tranquil sky, Far up it shone; Floating howgently, silently, Floating alone! A sunbeam touched its loftier side With deepening light; Then to its inmost soul did glide Divinely bright. The cloud transfigured to a star, Through all its framo Throbbed in the fervent heavens afar One pulse of flame; One pulse of flame which inward turned And slowly fed On its own heart, that burned and burned, Till almost dead. The cloud, still imaged as a star, Waned up the sky ; Waned slowly, pallid, ghost-like, far, Wholly to die; But die so grandly in the sun The noonfire's breath Mothinks the glorious death it won, Life! life I not death! Meanwhile a million insect things Crawl on below, And gaudy worms on fluttering wings Flit to and fro; Blind to that cloud, which grown a star, Divinely bright, Waned in the deepening heacens afar Till lost in light!
