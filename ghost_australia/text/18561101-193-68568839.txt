SELECT POETRY. THE BACHELOR'S REQUIEM. BY FRANK FREELOVE. Gone to the grave ! with no wife near to cheer him, No children to kiss him, no friends round to sigh Alone —with his head on an empty cigar-box, His feet on the fender— he laid down to die. Dying alone, with no friends to surround him But the rats and the mice, that gaze awe stricken on, Who left their rich meal of his boots and his papers, To finish their feast when his spirit has gone. Haggard and worn are the bachelor's features : His cheeks are all sunken, his brow coldly damp, His eyes black as coals, with one faint spark to light 'em, And this is the end of the merciless scamp. He writhes 'neath the last pang of torturing conscience, His bosom is heaving—that never heaved yet— He thinks of the thousands of hearts he has broken. Of the thousands of loves he has won—to forget. Hark ! there's a rustling of robes in the entry, And daintily treading come pretty young feet; The door swings wide open, the ghosts make their entree, The flirt and his victims on earth again meet. There were bright, giggling maidens, and beauteous ladies, Arch, mischievous girls, with much fun in their eye : And withered old maids, and half-crazy young dames, Who called in to see the old bachelor die. He gives them one glance, and his eye flashes fury— He turns to reproach them — alas, they are gone ! The rats and the mice have impanelled a jury— The bachelor shivers, and dies all alone. Alone in his glory! with empty old bottles, And, tailors' and boot hills, and club bills around. With one hand convulsively clutching the poker. And the other a crushed billet-doux, he is found. THE DOCKYARD BELL, at Williamstown, will ring on Saturdays at Twelve o'clock, instead of One, on and after this date until further notice.
