Depow on Superstition. "I am not superstitious," said Chaun cey MJ. Depow the other day. "I no not believe in witches, spirits, elves, vam pires, ghouls, or ghosts. Nor do I be lieve in an evil genius, the evil oyo, a bottomless pit, or a devil with horns and a clkven foot. I would not pass a night in?~a church or graveyard with a corpse, Ã½ecause that would be an un pleasauntand unprofitable way to spend a night. I would wear nothing in the nature of a talisman or mnascot and never crried a lucky coin. As to sit ting dcown with thirteen at a table, that is ono~thiig I would not do. But I re spcct'theosuperstition, notbecause I am superstitiqus, but because I do not want to feel uctm mfortable. A good dinner consists in omething more than thhing to eat'a~n drink. Its pleasure depends more on the subtler elements of good company, mitnds at ease and attuned to harm ,ny with the spirit of the occasion. If y.ur dinner is to be made uncomfort able,'by a ntouiuful or unpleasant feature of 'this kind you might better stop at a rr;staurant aid swallow a dozen oysters. oloun could at least then have a pleasant chat with the ,nan behind the counter while he opnen your oysters."
