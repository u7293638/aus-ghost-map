WHY CHILDREN ARE AFRAID . : : 1500 CHIDDiRBN ANSWER. ' .' Professor Miiddanald, of the 'Washington Bureau- of- FMrioa.tion, has Been making a series of ' extremely interesting investiga tions as to the causes which arouse Ifear'in children. His Btudy of if car iu .flic youth ful subjects was made by distributing hun- dreds of lists containing all miamiei'.of causes, such ns might excite -that emotion. Parents, -teachers and other persons — even the little ones lihom selves— marked -off such items Us the latter really feared.- .After reducing all of the replies to a table, it .was found -the highest number feared -thunderstorms, the nejJt highest rep tiles. Then follow, in order, according to the number fearing 'tlhem, strangers, dark ness, 'lire; death, -domestic animals, disease, wild animals, water, insects, ghosts, &e.; A comparison of an equal .number of -boys and giris Show tlhalt - the girls feared 1705 things on the list, and the boys 1100 things. The girls exceeded the IboyB in the fear of- everything except water, high place's, and strangers. Tlio ratio of girlls to hoys in the Tear of rats and mice was 75 to 13, as -mlht be expected. ' . . " - It was also ascertained that fear in the boys increases f-roon ' the seventh to the fifteenth. year, and -then declines, while in girls it increases snore steadily from the fourth to tilie eighteenth year before di minishing.' The /car of thunder nnd light ning; reptiles, robbers and machinery were found to increase with age. A careful study of ; the circumstances of birth and childhood of, what were considered to he the '50 greatest men of modern times disclosed . the fact that the average, great man was horn in a family of six children, not including half-brothers or half- sisters. It was figured from the data that the chances for greatness in a child are-two to one in favor of the older ' half of the family.
