LANGLEY. (most ODE OWN CORKESPONDEKt) „ , •. ,.• • Wednesday. so The Langley "ghost" has been seen several times within the last week, all Morts to capture it being unsuccessful: VJn one occasion a resident, on- taking his horsa to the paddock, was suddenhfeon- Eronted by a figure in white. The horse trembled violently and, breaking away, bolted. On assistance being obtained, an effort was made to surround the ghost, but it evaded capture and disappeared in some scrub. A number of trappers are working with a will in the district,-ahd no, doubt our troublesome friends, the rabbits, will be -considerably thinned. ' Bees- are very prevalent this season, several good lots of honey being obtained, also a fair average of stings. ^^
