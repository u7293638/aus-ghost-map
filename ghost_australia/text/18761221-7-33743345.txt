In this etage of the | disease lies %he foundation of all hypotheses of ghost-seeing, of ecstatic visions, a&d; even <rf poetic frenzy. £. curious instance in point, which came to our notice very recently, is that of a well-known writer in ihs press, who for some time past has 'devoted jeXttatdah to the Bubject of moA&dtfrental;'conditions. - This in a letter to a daily jodmai, states himself to be the victam of the horrible spectacle of two men hanging from a gallows, a sight which he once beheld while acting as a city reporter. The. suspended corpses are clearly brought be fore him by the sdimd of rain (the execu tion occurred during a rainstorm), and also by the sound of laaghter, since, through some uncontrollable impulse during the JMmpWr, he was induced to utter an nn timSy peal of merriment. That the writer's Drain is injured, possibly by the excessive mental strain peculiar to his pro fession, seems probable; and the lesson is tnanifefAed, «s already described, by the t^iiatsot recurrence of tie apparition. It is a wefl-known fact that we hare two natures, one purely organic and emo tional, the other subject to the reasoning powers'. l%e organic nervous cham exists 1b the body M a link between emotional jnettai acts and vascular supply. An im preeson i fnnn. without, made through the organs of the senses upon the emotional centre?, is reflected directly from them to the vascular expanse.
