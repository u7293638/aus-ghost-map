FOB.'' ' ?-? -. ' Mrs. Mowbray resided in one of the most aristocratic- of our squares. , She Was a woman -with a mission ';' better still, with a heart full of . sympathy for. God's unfortunates. Prosperity, a long career of riches-that ha,d had no stint or. stay, ; had not blunted the - kindly feelings of her nature ; and the hand was always as open as the heart to those who were suffer ing and oppressed. In the lists of charities, her donation was seldom missed ; outside them, in the courts and alleys of our mighty city, her name had been for years a household word. It was in ministering to other wants, that some three years ago old Mrs. Mowbray had discovered Mar jorie Kelly, a wan, pale-faced teache'r of music, struggling hard to live,and fighting with ill-health, as well as gaunt poverty. She had chanced upon her accidentally, and whilst relieving distress in another, she had heard of this young, unselfish, uncomplaining girl, upon whose scanty earnings a disreputable brother waB for ever levying black-mail. . She had found her at a bed of sickness, cheering and sustaining the heart of the invalid. 'She had been struck with her quickness of hend, her tenderness of speech, her tact, her natural cheerfulness : and it was not long before Marjorie Kelly 'passed' frbni ' her dingy lodgings down a back street in Bloomsbury to Mrs . Mowbray's splendid home ; and, whatwas better still, to' Mrs. Mowbray's generous heart. -She1 became an almoner* 'of the widow's bounty,' a female secretary, energetic and vigilant, an invaluable aid in all matters affecting the disposal of large sums of money for charitable purposes. Mrs. Mowbray began to wonder presently how she had ever got on without her, and Mrs. Mow bray's ? relatives— who were, to say, the least of it, a trifle mercenary — began to grow alarmed at the affection of the old Jady for the young one. It was rumoured that Miss, Kelly would drop into a fine thing presently : 'She has wound the old woman round her little finger,' asserted a spendthrift nephew, reckoning every hour before his aunt's decease as so much waste time between him and, his 'expectations.' 'She'll make a nice purse --ut of it,' cried the envious and uncharitable; ' Virtue will be rewarded pretty handsomely here,' snarled the satirist ; 'She deserves all that will be left to her,' asserted those who knew her worth, and knew her best. ' - '' Marjbrie Kelly had not troubled her head much with all these various com ments, sqme of which had reached her indireotly ;? ? she pursued the ,eyeii tenor of her way, undismayed andimdisturbed. Assured that she was doing' good to othersj and fulfilling her duties to her mistress, ahe had but little thought for the' murmuw of the crowd. She was conscious of her position, and [assumed not. on it; she , knew more of the inton: tions , of Mrs.; Mowbray, as: regarded her futurV.'than the^. world knew, and she was, content with all that was planned for her; -?..,.,...? , ?/ .; ?? ?-„?.... -., 'I shall not leave you much money, ' Mrs. Mowbray had told; her.once ; %t you will not require,, it,, and I' have other views ;, but .what,I leave you, Marjorie, I shall certainly, tie up in suchi away that your brother will not be able to make use o'f'it. If tbere's'one man's repentance I don't .believe, in,' Baid the old lady; de, cisivoly, '?^?i£'s Robert Kelly'k.' «. ' -.' '? r' .,,' vVhilstT there.is life there is p hope,' said Marjorie. ',.'.. ' ' ' ' r . ''\ ','.''..' '. ? ' ' Hope in him for yourj mishey,' added Mrs. Mowbray acridly.' ' ' ''/'. '. The merchant's 'widow had a ' few strong dislikea as well as strong fancies, and to the impostor she was as hard as adamant. Robert Kelly had ' deceived her once or twice by ingenious begging letters and false appeals to her merciful consideration, and she had not forgiven him. She scarcely forgave poor' Mar jorie for taking- his part, and /spending, her money upon him. ' . . '''.''?.'? '' 'In -the1 matter of your brother Robert,1 my child, I am inclined to think you are almost a fool,' 'she said, very acri-' monioualy, when'Marjbrie returned from her expedition to the east of London. ' '' I don't profess to be whe, and Ihelp him because ; he .is my; ;? brother, ?- not because he is deserving^', answered Mar jories , ?.???:?'. :'?-.'??.?'?????' ??'???;:-i: . ;:/ ' ''???.' 'I know it,' said the plain-spoken' woman,- 'and it is that which aggravates me | Sow, this boy Bill j he interests me.' f . Marjorie had told the S'-ory of- the death in Gregaon's Rents. ? ., 1 ; '1 am, glad of : that ; but he'will not come, I think.' ' -' ''?.'' , , ' I; think he will. -Indeed, my dear Marjorie, -I am sure ho will.' .: . .-? : And, as Mrs. Mowbray did not like to be. contradicted, having a few little fail ings: common:: to our?; poor humanity, Marjorie said no more on that occasion. ' The next day there was no opportunity to say anything, Marjorie Kelly being down with scarlet fever, caught in Greg aon's Rents; It was a, 'terrible iever of its kind, and Marjorio fought hard, for life, 'and for days and week's ' lay '' at death's :door,' ? a^weak; arid patient woman, ?????:-!'?? ;:?'?:??''?.'! ?-*? ??-??'' ''?.????,-y..i : '? ; Bfer!.first thought, and long before she could raise her head from the pillow, was, strangely enough, of the.vboy^in Gregsbn's Rents. He had been mixed up with her fevered dreams, and there:, had been amidst her wild' confusion of thought the phantom figure of Bill as she had seen him last — ragged, gaunt, and hag gard, a spectre of ' the. Btony-hearted streets. .'Has he been here 1 'she askod, sud denly, one night. 'Has who been ??' rejoined, the nurse. . ' The boy I loft in Gregson's Rents. ' '.I will enquire *-f ' Mrs. ;Mojwbray. ' -Mrs. Mowbray came intoanswer that question for herself. In the .concern for her companion's fever,' in the multiplicity of details forced upon her by Miss Kelly's illness, poor Bill had been completely forgotten, . and he had hot taken any pains to thrust himself into notice, ' What has become of him, I wonder K sighed Marjorie.

'There you are very muoTh' mistaken^' Mrs. Mowbray replied ; 'fot,'to tell you the truth, my dear, we were afraid,, a few days ago, you would not get -Jyer it,. and we telegraphed to him to come at once.''

'My dear, I haven't any patience with you,, when you go on like this,' cried the old lady. ' I wish your brother., —was half as good as you are, that's all.-'' 'Nbj-no; I am very bad,' said Mar jorie, restlessly. 'I have let a poor ;ladL drift away to wrong. I should not lltiav.e, left him without his promise to me — -l' should have sent next day — there weir^so many ways of helping him, and I did^not, think of them. . If I had not fallen ill— oh ! if I had not fallen ill -' ]''?. pi She was very weak, very restless' and excited, and it became necessary, to attempt to pacify her, if possible. ^But the boy was on her conscience, for ever before her was the crouuhed up figure' in. the open doorway, the grim statue- of human suffering and deBpair. It haunted her — it rondered peace of mind impossible .' It was part of the malady, as it were; and' the doctor shook hia head again next day, and sa.id that hers waa a aeriouacaae; indeed.' '.'.'Still Marjorie fought through he-* malady at last. When she was out of danger, but as. weak as an infant, they told her what had become of Bill. The news '. was broken to her gently; but the news she would have, under any circum stances,' and it did not wholly unnerve her. On the contrary, there .was a strange light upon her face; after awhile,; at which ? the watchers marvelled, and hardly thought was of an ' earthly -'origin. Bill was in .trouble. Under ' the ' respectable.: name of William Desmond, he had found his way into print,, and the papers of a few. Weeks back had chronicled' his sen tence of six months' imprisonment for robbery ;of;, goods from a shop - door. He : had pleaded guilty before a magistrate ?; he had pleaded' poverty as his excuse ; and the case, -had not gone to trial, but had been settled off-hand. William Desmond, only- known to the jWprJd in. general; and Gregson's Rents in particular, as '*? ' Bill,',' became a prisoner at Hollo way. , . ; , -..,, 'He is safe,' '.whispered, Marjorie, faintly;' ' I shall know where to find him, whim, I ! am strong, again.'' ^ .'. ...j ',.., When she was strong again !\ OHATTEB VI. -FQR GOpD- r-OR FOR EVIL 1 Some five, months after this; William' Desmond, cropped and;cleah,' with; a bran new pair of boots, the gif t'of the governor, on his feet, was taking his leave of the Holloway officials in -the reception room of the prison. '; The governor' was at his table, with a clerk and the chief warder in attendance, and the boy Bill in front of him, with a shame-faced and yet lower-, ing look on his face— ' hangdog' is the unpolite expression. In the back-ground were sundry atoms of the prison 'world to complete this neutral-tinted picture. : ' ' Your name is William Desmond V asked the governor. ' ' Bill, they call me gen'rally,' was the shwanswer. .
