CHRISTIAN EVIDENCE SOCIETY. LECTURE BY THE PRIMATE. The first of a series of lectures on the characteristics of the Bible was given last night by Dr Baird), president of the society, in the hall of the Young Men's Christian Association The subject of the lecture was " What is of faith as to inspiration for or what do you mean by calling the Bible inspired?" The chair was taken by Sir William Manning The proceedings were commenced with a hymn and pray c The CiiAtuxr AN, after a few preliminary remarks, introduced the Primate to his audience The Bishop before commencing his lecture made an appeal on behalf of the society for further assistance, stating that if these lectures were to be continued they must be self-supporting, and something more A lix nm having been sunk a collection was made Di BARon, who on coming" forward was received with applause said that this lecture would deal throughout simply with the chair acoustics of Holy Scripture itself, its Structure and inspiration, the mutual relation of its various parts the idea element in it of doctrine the character and spiritual force of its moonlit), its, historic effect on the course of the in o Id at large, and the growth of the Church of Christ He had determined upon this course in his lecture for two main 1 reasons The firstM as because the Bible, rightly understood, was itself the chief Christian evidence carrying with it a strong implicit proof of ltsoiindinno authorship and of the truth of Christianity, which it can bodied lins belief was strengthened be the observation of the general course of the attack on the Bible of the champions of so-called free thought proceeding in nine cases out of 10 from sheer ignorance of what the Bible really xi as as an organic whole, and denying most of their effects from a similar ignorance in then heard ora, even those who were not without the reality of Christian faith Caricature was the favourite M Capon for even in warfare 11 Inch cared chiefly for warfare, in hero a time portraiture of the original would be sufficient to shame the false or per vol tod representations, and of the inferences drawn therefrom The second loisonfortho course he had adopted 11 as the desire of the society to produce something that would have some positive force of instruction apart from mere polemical attack 01 defence Any contribution to this important object instruction would have its value when special attacks and discussions had passed into oblivion They should ask "What is of Christian faith as to Seraphim inspiration,' 01 "What do the month when we hold it essential to Christ but) to declare that the Bible is in spired" Various theories of the character and method of inspiration Mere held by thoughtful members of the Church of Christ, and there was much in those theories on which Christians must be content to differ, though he could never hold that the, should prevent them from putting forward in all For event and charitable earnestness whatever seemed important to the truth No perfect theory could be framed, for that would require 11 knowledge the in bold mind of God and of the law s of His influence on the spirit of man, which our Lord had declared to be inscrutable to man These theories Mere matters of speculation, not of faith Underlying them in as a common belief in the supreme authority and inspiration of the Bible mining, in actual fact, our existing Chnstiamtx xi as built If there was (rib was certainly the case), in spite of all divisions,, a fundamental uncle of belief in the great articles of faith a set forth for example in the Apostles' Creed, it xvaslnsloricall) certain that this unit) of belief came from a common acceptance of Holy) Scripture as in some true and special sense the inspired Word of God By a right instinct the society had seized upon this acceptance, A ion old as inseparable from the acknowledgment of the true Godhead of our Lord Jesus Christ, and made it the basis of a common Christian fellowship Hence there was something which xi as not of speculation, but of truth, on this all-important matter, and that that something in as he desired they should thoughtfully) inquire To gain a clear idea on this subject there were the preliminary consideration at which he would glance First 111 strict con redness, they should not speak of the Bible as an inspired book, but of the human author 1 of Holy Scripture as inspired men inspiration xi as the action of the spirit of _ ed upon the fixing spirits of mon Mon n 000 on special occasions lifted above their ordinary selves, so that those " holy men of old " in relation to the writing of Holy Scripture might well have had some special exaltation above what might be called the average inspiration of their hearers, so much was indicated to us in the recorded spiritual expressions of the prophets of the Old Testament It was also to the that words moulded the thoughts they convey ed, and that the choice of an order for things divine needed a guidance from above as truly as the choice of thoughts We might therefore truly speak of "verbal inspiration " Under the consciousness of these two undoubted truths, no more justified in speaking popularly of Holy Scripture in its present concrete form as on inspired book, but the phrase was still in strictness incorrect, and tina incorrectness tended to obscure the all-important truth that the waters of the Holy Scriptures were not merely mechanical instruments through which the Spa it of God spoke They were living thinking men, inspired by the spirit, but living and thinking men still Next it should be noticed that under the general name of inspiration, in the Bible, were mostly included two distinct conceptions, which might better be called revelation and inspiration, processes not identical but correlated or corresponding to each other To convey truth from one mind to another there was first need for the presentation, manifesta- tion, expression of truth by the teaching and, that May re- velation There was necessary also the stimulation and excitement of the intelligence of the learning mind, that was inspiration Whatever we knew thoroughly m 0 could express and present to the minds of others, but the latter (as oxen teacher sadly confesses) was but slightly in our power, although ox in the slightest measure of inspiration was the most important element of the teacher's art, and for want of this power to inspire much true teaching in as wasted every day) But in Divine teaching there was no such limitation There For elation and inspiration could always co-exist and harmonise with each other They were brought together in such prophetic phrases as the spirit of the Lord was upon me," there was inspiration, the quickening of the spiritual eye that it might see the things of God For perfect conveyance and transmission of truth, the two processes should not only to exist, but exactly keep pace with one another But, actually, rose lation might be larger and wider thantnspn ation, the truth received and transmitted might be but imperfectly grasped even by the inspired mind Itxins not necessary to know the exact meaning present to the mind of the prophet or psalmist to comprehend the whole meaning of the Dix ino utterance itself. It was, therefore, better not to speak except popularly of the inspiration of Scripture, but rather describe the Holy Scripture as a revelation from God through man, and to give the name of inspiration to the BUneinaturol moving of their minds to understand and to enter it by the Holy Spirit of God Looking at the question under their light, he proposed to consider how far such revelation and inspiration were given to all humanity, trad next how far they were the supernatural privilege of the Church of Christ since the great day of Pentecost, and then to examine the relation of likeness and difference following and yet transcending the general law in which revelation through the inspired writers of Scripture stood to those lower forms of knowledge of the the will of God he was convinced that the line of thought followed out in Drummond's "Natural Law in the Spiritual World" was the one which modern speculation and faith as craving for unity in the works of God emphatically) needed He was inclined to believe that the supernatural itself in Christian doctrine and grace was often rejected or put aside without examination as incredible because it was set forth as preternatural, either ignoring or con- tradicting the natural laws and powers which, by our own confession, wore the work of the same Almighty Creator in relation, then, to all that humanity), let us consider that to one who believed in a -"true God all truth was an expression of His will and His nature, and therefore, so far as it was capable of being known, the human mind was a 1 evolution of Himself to man The mi infestations of nature, what it 0 read in human history, or in human thought and literature, was the expressed result of the working of natural powers of the mind, educated by the environment in which God's providence had placed men What should we say of the power to know these things the reason, as we called it-whether the speculate 6 or the moral, through which man's soul rose to) omit the sphere of sensational intelligence shared with him the into creation, to see everywhere that which was invisible, and to apprehend if it could not comprehend the eternal relations embodied in Oxon -changing forms P As it must be the gifts of the CrossING Hand, so, like all the which filled creation, it must be constantly sustained and guided by the indwelling of the same power which made it It must have, in other words, a constant inspiration Gromoboi Before quitting this part of the subject we had to go one stop further and let us remark that in this process of knowledge of truth and of God, the instruction of the race went on, not simply by the natural gifts to all men alike, hut by the teaching and originating influence of a comparatively few men who were in each generation the torn leaders of men they saw clearly what others Baw perhaps not at all they had the power to speak to humanity strange moods which stood out as in letters of glowing light before the world. The few had toonginato and to lead, the many had to judge and to accept Again, if God originated all things, "the sovereign masters of men's hearts must hold their spiritual senior eights is simply a delegation from Him In proportion as they lose above the level of the earth, they caught the rax s of God's light, and reflected them to the low or world He would task them to remark m how great a degree the world-wide power of roi station of truth was exercised through books Action was great, speech was great but the written word was perhaps the greatest force of all Every good book was a gift for which they should thank God So far us it set forth truth and light it was a record tion from heaven ostriches who quote was implied to understand and to declare These large conceptions of revelation and inspiration were unquestionably taught In the New testament, especially in the writings of St John But turn from all humanity to the redeemed humanity within the Christian covenant, from the world to the Church of Christ that Church, so He did fred, was to be founded on the revelation to all of the divine truth from the eternal rather the actual birth of that church, was the outBOurinfi at the. Bay of Pentecost of the Spirit upon all flesh, upon all who should receive Hira, upon all in various orders and degrees in a new and higher sense the Church here entered upon the birthright of true humanity with a concentrated revelation which was to the diffused light without the pale as the sunshine to the twilight The lovolitonol Gol was to be laid open open to babes The inspiration was to be the fulfil 11 out of the noble game of Moses and the glory- ' ous promise of Jeremiah, because in it all men were to be as prophets, in that all knew and denim ed the Lord himself But as the whole truth of the Godhead was unfolded in the Gospel clearer still bet and the distinction be tween revolution and inspiration Revelation was in till its parts the gift of the Lord Jc us Christ It was the loca- tion of God and man as one of Him who wits tliebivwour for bin and death, and as the Mediator for eternal no CLss to the other And it was clear that this revelation to the soul of men was one Inch was universally to all who received it in full, and it was to belong to all ages until He came again But inspiration-the quickening of the spiritual capacity) to receive this rela- tion was night's defined to us as the gift of the Holy Ghost in certain well-known passages out Lou! himself marked this relation the Comforter He said, shall guide men into all truth be bringing to their emembi mice" and under standing whatever Christ himself hath said unto them " taking of that which is Christ's and showing it unto them " Leen where in the Clius tram system the same truth was implied the indi* du of Christian life was the now lodge and the reproduction of the divine life of Christ the power by which it was realised was the gift of him who was emphatically described as the Spirit of Truth the holy 'spirit, the Spirit of Love There was under this general gift to all the special and exceptional exultation of the. few there had been in the Chin eli m es on five men who were the head s of spiritual humanity raised up above all as teachers of the evolutions of Gtd Even among those who had not rise to this heroic level of saintliness there was still almost inn no difference Almost every man who in any degree led, had his own&poetal; mission in revelation of truth, and his own special gift of map nation by which the mission might be accomplished there also we observe the same transcendent power of the written word in the 18 centuries of Christianity what a noble Christian literature had grown up As he could over estimate to take only instances from ancient days, the spiritual force exercised by Origen and Athanasius by Jerome and A Augustine, W Thomas Aquinas or 1 bounds t\ compass They. had undoubtedly boon to the church of all times re v calm s of the truth and power of God Nor wife this high pi ii doge confined to them All the count- less Christian writers who had spoken and were speaking to men whether it were but to a few or but for a time, we are yet adding something to the fabric of the Christian revelation of God Such it would seem was the evolution of the general law of revelation and inspiration of God as in other was s so especially through the written words of men-first, as it existed in what we called the natural order of humanity at large , next, as it was realised in the supernatural order the true characteristic of the miraculous nature of royals tion was that it was at once Supernatural and naturally direct, unique extraordinary exhibition of the same Almighty power, the same all embracing design of all perfect righteousness, which were al mrs a work from the same divine hand in what we called the ordinary workings of the providence of God the revelation of God in Holy Scripture would be to some degree been incredible to us if we did not see in it the culmination of the meat general law of God's isolation of Himself to His creatures And here then, hit, the true differences of Biblical re* elation, that which in the eyes of all Christians distinguished it so essentially from all other revelations of God -1 vote, of course in its author Not in the medium through which it waggon for theaters of Holy See return of some of them to us unknown, were cer - turned men of like passions with our self 0s differing among themselves in faculty, in degree of inspiration, and loftiness of mission, and with respect to the writers of the Old Testament, they had not and could not have, that knowledge of God which He gave to the world once and for ever by His Son The essential difference was in the purpose which the Bible was to serve, and which it has served actually in history of the last 18 centuries that purpose was declared in the words of an article of the Church of England, which all of us would in substance accept, that it contains" for all men and all times "all things necessary to salvation " This was the one thing that was of faith as to the revelation or inspiration of the Holy Scripture On the acceptance or rejection of that class, by which we distinguished the Bible from all other books, turned the difference between those who were and those who were not Christians On what did the unexampled claim of universal and undying authority of Holy) Scripture restr" Llttntntelv In this one foundation-thocou v action that it contained adequately the direct manifestation to the world of the Word, and of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ himself the manifestation of Christ was the central essence of the spiritual rose elation, mud up to this all led to the preparatory revelations of the Old lasts month Each writer of Holy Scripture had, we believe, just that light from heaven which enabled him to perfectly fulfil his part Even evangelists in the New Testament, even St James, St Peter, St Paul, St John, had each what St Paul called his "gospel" to deliver each his own phase of the perfect truth of Christ to set forth This great principle of Biblical revolution had many important consequences at some of which he would glance In this relation of all parts of Scripture to the central revelation in Christ In) the secret of that unit, obvious to all believers and unbelievers alike who thoughtfully studied the Bible It was miraculous in itself, containing as it did an infinite variety of time, place, language, authorship, bound all into one AA hat other example did history offer of books separated from each other by thousands of years, by infinite distance, by diversity equally minute of character, race, and civilisation, vet forming one complete and progressive w hole See, again, how in the continual approach to the full manifesta- tion of Christ is the secret of the progressive eness acknowledged by all in the Old Testament In the growth of knowledge of the full incoming of that manifestation drawn out by the work of proclaiming it to the world in all its varieties of thought and character lay the secret of the dog eloquent of Christian doeth rae, equally admitted in the New Testament itself In this recognition of the Bible as an organic whole having its central life in Christ was based that wise advice of his back Christians seek the truth, not in this or that passage, but in the complete development of doctrine in the whole Scripture How many errors and difficulties in the placing of faith in the authority of the Bible would have vanished had this counsel been always followed, both by those who taught and those who read and heard They might also mark the double function which every part of Holy Scripture had to discharge It had to speak to its own age, therefore, to speak in the language of that age, and it had also to speak to all ages, and therefore in the language belonging to all time It had to discharge the special duty laid in each generation on the prophet who was charged with the revelation of God, and yet to prepare for or to look back upon the one perfect and unchang- ing manifestation of God in the Lord Jesus Christ the double sense of prophecy, embracing both the immediate pu hal fulfilment up to the time of the prophet, and the perfect fulfilment of which the other was but a type in the kingdom of the Messiah-w hat had been recognised as thotypicul foreshadow ing of Christ in person was no fanciful rule of interpretation lins double purpose of Holy Scripture extended to all its parts Those considerations tended to the one conclusion that the supreme Divine authority of Holy Scripture belonged to it as a whole, that the whole centred round the Word and the person of Christ, and expressed itself perfectly as regards the essence of the Christian faith only through that Word and Person, and that the message of God could not be understood when we isolated texts, and tried to find in them thus isolated the full perfection of Christian truth That the law of Scripture must be viewed as a whole, perfected, was the declared command of Christ Let us consider in what form the manifestation of Christ to man through man was made What, in fact, was the Bible in character and structure ? Unlike all other sacred books, it was primarily a history's record not of the thoughts and ideas of men, even of inspired men, but of the actual works of the providence of God Starting from the creation and going down to the fourfold Story of the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Christ, it was a proclamation to the representatives of the whole world This was the chief element of Scnptut e 1 brought it there was interwoven, like a thread, the teach- ing, in the name of God, in the law of moral and ecclesiastical righteousness marked out in the history, in the manifold utterances of prophecy, and disclosing the whole nature of God All led up once more to the perfect law and teaching of the great Prophet of prophets, the revealer of God in Himself, partly revealed to us in the gospels themselves, and partly reflected and explained in the apostolic utterances which were its witnesses to the world In both these, the history of the prophecy of Scripture, w had a progressive e re station of God, and interwoven with them was the response of men, the out- come of divine inspiration, in adoration and praise, m supplication and prayer, in confession of earthhness and aspiration after heaven It reigned through the historic and prophetic books of the Old Testament, it concentrated itself in the great book of the Psalms and had its brief perfection in the pray ors of Our Lord We must see that it was necessary to view Biblical revelation as a whole Who could lightly cut the thread of history i Who could break any where the continuity of Divine teaching? They should also strive to see what was essential in each of those elements of Holy Scripture to make it adequate for its place in the manifestation of God in Christ What was essentially needful for the historic element t Absolute historic truth History must be true, or it was merely fiction Nothing was clearer than that the Scriptural narrative claimed to be strictly history The brief sketch of the primeval world in the earlier chapters of Genesis might possibly be a symbolical narrative, but from the Flood onward the narrative had plainly claims to be history No matter how that narrative came to us, if it was in any sense a revolution of God, speaking with authority it must be absolutely true Here he must speak plainly about what was called the miraculous element in holy Scripture not as many readers were apt to suppose sown in and cast in the history, but appearing in the order of God's providence I his element in as inextricably interwoven with the texture of the history itself, and was received with the same calm absence of wonder is what we called ordinary facts to explain away miracles, or to remain contented!) in doubt whether the record were plain or ambiguous, true or false, was absolutely incon- j history with the acceptance of the Bible history as a true revelation of God. 'I his miraculous element of it the Bible record was an essential part of the preparation for what in itself was the miracle of miracles -the incarnation of God on earth Again, this element must be considered as a whole, for, to explain away miracles here and there was futile, such was the historical element of scripture, accept it as absolutely true, and the supernatural character of its new relation proclaimed itself But in but could they say if the supreme history up to Milich it led the life, death resurrection of our Lord as they stood forth to us in the fourfold harmony of the gospels Here it was that the absolute truth of the record Mas raised above all dispute the figure of the Jesus of the Gospel blood out by consent of all, unup preached and unapproachable It aimed on its work forefront the x visible sign < I His mi visible God-head, and scarcely) less plainly did it indicate the Dix mo inspiration of those who in measure understood it and recorded it to the world he would now turn to what he might calling the largest sense the prophets element of Holy Scripture we hut was required for it-.
