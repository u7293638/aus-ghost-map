'IRE WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF GHOSTS. . Extraordinary evidence was given in the Hawthorn court yesterday during tlie hearing of a case in which Emily Adams sought to recover certain moneys retained by W. H. Batten, auctioneer, as commission and expenses iu connection with a sale of furniture at Hurt's- parade. - According to Miss Adam defendant agreed to conduct the sale at half tho usual commission, and to charge hor only advertising expenses, whorcas he had deducted from iho proceeds more than double the amount he was entitled to, and misrepresented the amounts which some of the article realised. In cross- examination by Mr. Westlcy, Miss Adams with much warmth admitted that she believed in the existence of ghosts, stating that sho could, if desired, give some "great accounts" of that class of phenomena to tho court. (Laughter.) The witness added, symjiatheticnlly : One of the ghosts, poor thing, had a broken leg — loud laughter — and Mr. Wcstley : Aro you really serious, Miss Adatns, in swearing that you havecncountcred these "spooks"? — lam, indeed. There are human ghosts in Hawthorn. (Re newed laughter.) Mr. Westlcy : By tho way, is it a fact you had Detective Dungey sleeping in your house for tho purpose of laying hold of a "ghost"? — I must refuse to answer that. It does not concern you. Mrs. Adams (mother of the witness) : If you are not satisfied 'ou can sec the written testimony of tho " ghosts ?\ (Laughter.) The defence was that Miss Adams imd imagined the alleged agreement with Mr. Batten, who flatly contradicted her. The case was dismissed, with 21s. costs.
