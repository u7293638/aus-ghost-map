It was. not to prove a gale, though it would have been hard toguess what lay behind that dirty jumble of white and livid, terraceswliicli hud been stealthily, creeping all the morning : zenithwards. The clouds scattered to the rush of the wind, the sun with a -brightened disk leapt from one flying vaporous edge, to . another; ydazding. out the. snows of'the dissolving seas till the eye reeled from the glare of the brilliant foam and the sharp and lovely sparkle of the pure dark blue between. Indeed, before- long the wind' steadied down; into a noble sailing breeze with a piebald shy of warm and cheerful . weather steadily swinging"into the southeast, as though.the whole heaven revolved from one.quarter to another lite a panorama on a cylinder. Wilfrid looked liis wishes, "but said nothing. He-huiig apart in a fashion that, was the same as "telling me .to keep off, nor had he anything to say to'Miss Jennings. . Finn easily inter-: prcting his master's-face, piled cloths on the yacht till it seemed asthough another •rag. would. blow. the whole lofty white •fabric 'of -Canvas,. taperiiig .gpsM',-', and rigging clenn.over the bows. We fled along in thunder, and to evezy curtsy of the vessel's head the water recoiled in a roar of ispumo as far as the jjliboom end, .speed aft as fast, you would have thought, as the eye could follow it, the swell;w;isli-; inj» to the counter as if. to help lier;. .- '.; .

I glanced at Wilfrid,, not knowing., what sore of mood this first glimpse of the yacht would jinl into him, but there was no alteration of fa'ce.: His countenance had set into an iron-hard expression ; inethouglit resolution could, never show more gTimly stubborn. ;Miss Jennings came to .the; side to look. .7 • 7 ."
