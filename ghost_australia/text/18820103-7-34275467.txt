CRICKET. The cricket matches played on the Adelaide Oval on Saturday, December 30, attracted a very fair attendance of spectators. Unfortu- <*> nately the wickets provided were not up to the mark, that at the south end being a regular "ridcer." The Hindmarsh team at the north end run up a king score, bat the players at the other end made only small acorca. HrKDVAKSH V. KKX-siyoTOS'. Noel and Jarvis were the first to assume the defensive, and after a cautious opening they set down to work and kept np the part nership for ? long time. They both played splendid cricket, Jarvis in particular has seldom appeared to better advantage, his batting all round being clean and vigorous, while his long score |was compiled without his having given the ghost of a chance. Noel played with freedom, and his innings was in point of style little if anything inferior to that of his companion. Gould ably supported Jarvis for a time, but after this there waa a break in the scoring; Caterer and Lucas disposing of some of the batsmen very cheaply. Norman played an exceedingly free innings, hitting to afl parts of the field; bnt his general play wsu too uppish, and had the Kensingtons been awake he should have been disposed of much earlier. Hill played nicely, and at twenty-five minutes past 6, when Caterer got at Norman, the score stood at 246, having been brought up S3 by the last wicket The wickets fell in the following order:—One for SB, two for 121, three for 136, four for 127, five for 129, six for 130, seven for 174, eight for 192, nine for 183, ten for 24& Caterer bowled well, but he had agood deal of hard luck. Lucas sent down a large number of balls for a small quantity of runs, and Tardif trundled fairly. Subjoined are the scores ?— "HrSDXIAB.SK. ?. Jfocl c. Morris, b. Tariff— .- ... 4* \\. H.
