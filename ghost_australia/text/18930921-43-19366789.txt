CUAI'TKU XI. 51K JOCUI.JK, J I. It was fully two hours before the tramp came forth, his outer man tnnsfdniieii out of all recognition, save for his fctmu nos, by a respectable suit «.l jlolhiug and highly polished boots furnished to him by the sergeant. " Clothing does not tnakn tho man," Faith the adage, but in this case lh>i -jl-1 saying was v rung. The (altered, limp ing wretch who had entered the servant's room, scarcely anything human in his rags and dirt and umcrv. Blood here now :i smiling, hale looking in.m of forty. A clean tdiave, witli a copious supply of water, and a suit of brown tweetl had mado all the difference in him. At worst ne was rot a bad-looking fel low. Save for an ugly scar, which gave to his mouth a sinister aspect, he was well-featured, and not, by any means the. hang dog footpad he had steiucd through the prejudiced sptctacles of tho lodge lieruer. Mr Jocilyn reclined on a sofa, smoking a very aromatic cigar when the wayfarer was ushered into his presence. For a moment ho sat up and stared at the liguro before him. " Are yon the chap that opened the gate last night.'" " Yes." " I'm glad to ice you havo made your self presentable heforo calling on me," returned tho magistrate with a must gracious smile, in winch a sneer was hid den. " Take a seat, my good fellow, and tell me to wh.nt fortunate event I am in debted for this visit. The tramp, not cccming to liced tho sarcastic taunt, looked coolly munri about the luxurious apartment. There wire one or two cosy suits at liik side, bur the man limped scrou the room to an arm-chair with a high back, which stood by the window. Stating liiin«ulf hero he had the luagistrate's face full to the lipht, which was cvideutly what tho visitor desired. "1 thank you, Mr ,/oCtYi'ii," lie says, quietly, but laying peculiar stress upon Uie two last wonla. ''It's very hard for a lame man like myself to get about with any degree of comfort." "You are rralUj lame, my friend," quoth the J.P., looCing hard at tho tramp. •' No shamming to create sym pnthy ?
