" Well,, I . will, relate a peculiar \ affair that happened on Tall mans Gully, in 1859." S " Wc were all attention, and listened to the very reniark- ( able narrative he related in the following manner : y " Yon must know," commenced my uncle, " that i and ) four mates' were living in a tent on the banks _ of the ( river — living, I said, I. should have called it existing, for ) we were most unfortunate, only finding sutficient gold to \ keep us in the commonest tucker. After our everyday's ( work, you may be sure we were tired enough ; but we were y every night disturbed in our rest by the clink, clink, cHnk \ of a pick, about fiftj' y.ards from our cauvas home. This ( confounded noise always. commenced at midnight, and did ) not cease until the break of day. One night wc were \ determined to see who it was ; so wc sallied forth in . the r bright moonlight, and saw a figure in a coarse red flannel J s.iirt, high boots, and slouched liat, hard at work by an C old claim which had been deserted for many years. I was ( chosen spokesman, to expostulate with this noisy digger; i but when I was within twenty yards of him, I stood still, ( transfixed with horror,— for the wearer of the digger's ( clothes was no lir/viig man, hut a xlteleton S " Uncle Ned 1" we all cried, "how fearful." . C " One night, our tent was visited' by a handsome, well- y to-do looking man, of; .about- fifty ; years of _ age, who S enquired for a digger of \yhpm ;\ye kneiv nothing about. He told us that in '51 he and a mate of his deserted from / one of Her Majesty's ships, and started for the Tallmans \ gold fields. They wprked with pretty, good luck for a few \ months, when the new. com ef went down to Melbourne to f see-abontPome letters. .Before he went, he said" to his ) mate, .'Bob, whatever you do, never stop working the ( claim for a day uiitil l come back.' Bob promised, and y they parted. ' I went down- to Melbourne,' sa,id the ex- \ digger, ' aiid there was arrested as a deserter, and seiit 011 hoard ; arid now that I have obtained my discharge, I / have hastened up here to find my old chum.' ' You will \ see. iiim to-lnight,' I said ; ' but yon'll find him very much f changed.': .- At midnight, the everlasting clink of the y phantom's, pick was heard, and we all turned out. 'Ah ! ' ) cried the "sailor, ' there' A dear old Bob. Bob, here I am r back. - Boh, speak to me.' He ran to the figure, which ) turned its liidcous face on him. '-With a'lpud shriek the seeker i fell senseless on the' ground. "The- ghost threw down its pick, arid vanished.-.- Ln the morning we., discovered the ) poor sailor a raving lunatic.
