MAIL NEWS. (From Papers to 2nd October ) AFFAIRS IN KERRY. A correspondent of the 1 imes travelling in Kerry, gives the following account of the condition of the people and the working of the present land laws - As to the present ability of the tenants to pay their rents, no doubt they have suffered severely, especially those who depend chiefly on dairy farming, but most of them could probably put together half a year's rent if they tried Their advocates allege that landlords and statesmen are not making sufficient allowance for the depression, but they must admit that the tenants themselves are to blame, for there have been so many protestations of inability to pay which have proved unfounded that they are now received at least with suspicion A tenant on Lord Orrnathwaite's property, I am told, took a farm in 1862 at £250, having little or no capital He subsequently purchased the in treat of two or three tenants on another estate and a number of houses in Listowel worth about £2000, and is reported to have a large sum besides His rent was reduced to £232 by the land commissioners, and he refused to pay until his house property was put up for sale, when he paid the rent and costs A woman on another property in Kerry, whose rent was 18, was not allowed to pay even with a reduction, proceedings were taken against her, and she had to pay the full rent and £16 costs, which she did with many maledictions on the league and the priests who had prevented her from settling amicably with her landlord The effect of the Arrears Act was also very demoralising A man, for example, who owed three years' rent paid one, and got off the other two, being thus placed in the same position as his more thrifty neighbours who had paid everything that was due The latter now say they will take care not to be caught again, and many of those who were relieved of their arrears have paid nothing since, and say, by way of excuse, " Shure, There'll soon be another Arrears Act " It also enabled many who wore hopelessly insolvent to prolong their lease of life, and has in reality benefited neither them nor the landlord The Land Act provides a method of getting rid of insolvent tenants by giving them the right of selling their interest, but the league will not allow it to work, in fact, they sit on the safety valve and then complain of the machinery Nevertheless there have been cases, even in Kerry, within the last few months in which as much as eighteen and nineteen years' purchase has been given for the tenant right more, in fact, than they are willing to give the landlord for his fee simple These sales must have been privately effected, for no one is allowed to buy the interest in a farm at a public auction Nearly all the landlords and agents I have met in Kerry look to peasintproprietorsktpaa the only solution of the land question. The relations between landlord and tenant have became so strained that it seems almost hopeless to think they will over settle down again, and the tenants are in many cases anxious to buy if they were allowed In one case a landlord lately offered to sell to a tenant whose rent is 9-4 for 125, and to forgive him the year's rent due, the result of which would have been an immediate reduction of his rent to be a year, but he preferred to pay the £9 4s and costs In another case the judicial rent was £18 10s and the landlord offered to sell for £¿~>o, which would have reduced the rent to all but the man said his priest would not allow him to buy I have, on the other hand, met one or two landlords who are unwilling to sell, and who are persuaded that land will go up again, and that if only law and order were restored the tenants would resume their former ways The large farmers are, I believe, generally worse off than the small ones They began to live very extravagantly in the good years, giving large fortunes to their daughters, getting unlimited credit at the shops, and borrowing without difficulty from the banks, with the natural consequence that they now find themselves in many cases terribly involved. The smaller tenants, on the other hand, who have not had the same opportunities for extravagance and can work their farms, as a rule, without employing labour, have not suffered so much and are paying better. Though the times are bad, it is by no means impossible to farm Without a profit A gentleman who is both a landlord and tenant tells me that his farm is paying its way, and a large farmer says that after paying his rent and discharging all other obligations he had a small balance last year, but the fact is that the tenants generally have been neglecting their work and attending meetings and reading the papers, and expecting to get the land for nothing The younger generation have become regular idlers, and are not satisfied with the style of living their fathers have been used to They have discarded the good old free and corduroy for cloth and tweed, which are more expensive and less sen cable, and it is not uncommon to see a farmer's daughter with a gale's rent on her back I have seen no trace of poverty in Keri y Even at such an out of the way place as Dingle, on the monthly fair day, I could not avoid being struck with the remarkably well to do appearance of the people The men were all dressed in blue cloth coats and tweed trousers, and it was only here and there that an old man was to be seen in the picturesque dress of former days The children, too, seem every where well dressed and fed , but though I failed to find it, it would of course be too much to allege that poverty does not exist One thing is perfectly clear, that the people generally care nothing for Home Rule Many of them hardly know what it means, and farmers of a better class are afraid of the taxes they would have to pay I met a decent old fellow, while taking a ramble through the mountains, and had a talk with him on things in general He complained of the bad times and the prices of butter and cattle, and I asked him whether he thought things would be better under Home Rule " I think a land bill would be the best he said I do not think Home Rule is much good and by a land bill he meant land purchase Another man whom I met in the same locality made a suggestion which should commend itself to wiser heads than his " What ever Act the Government pass, ' he said, " they should insist, insist," he reported cm practically, " on its being observed for a certain term of years. It would be a first class plan, sir, a first class plan " THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE AND BILL. GARIA Writing on 20th October the Vienna correspondent of the Times says - It is asserted in well informed circles that a secret understanding has been made between Germany, Austria Hungary, and Russia, according to which Russia has engaged not to occupy Bulgaria, but is, on the other hand, to be allowed to take any measures short of occupation in order to recover the position which she held in the country under the treaty of Berlin This arrangement is described by some of Count Kalnoky admirers as the best that could be made in the difficult circumstances created by the Czar's excited and irritable state of mind If, however, Russia be debarred from a military occupation, she can only recover a part of her influence in one way, and that is by placing on the Bulgarian throne a Prince also lately devoted to her To do this will not be difficult, for most Bulgarian politicians hold that so long as the Constitution is maintained it signifies little who is Prince Abandoned to Russian agitations, the Bulgarians will soon feel the necessity of restoring peace to the country, and if Russia only has the sagacity to promise that the Constitution shall remain intact, a party will soon be brought to pronounce itself for the election of Prince Nicholas of Montenegro or Peter Karagcor goods Russia has had one of these candidates in view from the first, and cares for no others Either of them would be acceptable to the mass of the people, especially if the election of the new Prince were made the occasion of erecting Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia into one kingdom, nor would the fact that Prince Nicholas and his son-in-law, are particularly obnoxious to Austria furnish any reason why the other Powers should object to the election of one of them An article in Count Taaffc's organ, the Presse, declares to day that England is outside the sphere of Continental alliances The Press does not generally speak for the Foreign Office, but on this occasion it probably expresses the views that are entertained by those who direct the foreign policy of the Empire England, it is complained, cannot be relied upon to support an active policy in the Balkan Peninsula, and therefore Austria cannot on mere sentimental grounds interfere to alter the arrangements that were made for Bulgaria under the Berlin Treaty. She will have done her utmost by preventing the forcible occupation of the country, but questions of internal government must be left to be settled between the Bulgarians themselves and the Russian?, Lot the Bulgarians resist moral pressure if they can; it they cannot, it is not Austria Hungary's business to supply them with moral strength. This reasoning is plausible enough, and will supply the British Government with a ready argument if a day should come when Austria finds herself isolated in objecting to a pot candidate of Russia for the Bulgarian throne. That mischief would arise out of such a Can- didature as Karagoorgcvics's is probable ; but mischief becomes inevitable from the moment when Bulgaria is left late in tote with Russia for the settlement .' her affairs. And, after all, it will rest with Austria to minimise the mis- ch of, by accepting horses for the logical consequences of her present position, and approving whatever candidate the Bulgarians choose to elect under Russian pressure, even though there should be some little trouble in Servia, Rosina, and Herzegovina as the ultimate result of this policy. I A FRENCH VIEW OF THE EGYPTIAN QUESTION. ! The Republique Française, in an article on the Egyptian Question, says -"The importance of the French interests in the Valley of the Nile has been misconceived by a few persons in an hour of scare and bewilderment ; but it is now forcing itself upon every mind, with all the irresistible weight of a painful experience. That deliberate opinion may be thus formulated -First, France committed a great blunder in not proceeding to Egypt with England in 1882 England, on the other hand, in failing to withdraw from Egypt in accordance with the solemn promises of her Government, committed a mistake of equal magnitude. These two faults are the cause and origin of the disagreement which followed the entente cordiale If those two errors be not retrieved, this disagreement between the two countries cannot but become aggravated. Secondly, there exists no radical incompatibility to even the interests of France and England so longasEjjypt is neutral. So long, however, as that country shall continue to be occupied by British troops, it will be a 0 trous morning, a corpse standing between the two nations. Thirdly, has Franco during those last few years over contemplated making the possession of Egypt an integral part of her programme of colonial expansion ' Since the opening of the Suez Canal no one in France has cheriShed such a project. Franco has been discontinued [renounce) to exercise her influence in Egypt save by the means which are lawfully open to every other nation, without excepting Great Britain. But she demands-nay, requires (a u/7«)-that Great Britain shall do likewise. 1 ourthly, France having renounced the conquest of Egypt, can she allow any other European Power to seize upon the Valley of the Nile' She will never allow it. Egypt incorporated with or annexed to England implies a casus belli which no party in France could evade. England, mistress of Egypt, would command the Suez Canal, would hold the key to all our colonies in the far East, would hold our African Empire in check, and at one blow suppress our time honoured influence in Syria. A great country could not without shame accept such a animation until after a maritime and a military disaster which would leave it practically powerless 1 ifthly, 1 France does not want to have anything from England, but she did not allow England to take anything from her. Egypt, as the Border State of the Suez.! Canal, can only be placed under the international guardianship of the whole of Europe-." A THOUSAND SHEEP POISONED. The mail from South Africa brings tidings of another of those wholesale poisonings of sheep that have happened from time to time, filling the minds of the farmers with consternation in the localities where they occur. This time it is a farmer in the Bloemfontein district whose stock has been so ruthlessly destroyed, and to the extent of nearly a thousand sheep The particulars of the case must be of special m tel est to all owners of sheep The clip used was one of the best known of the class distinguished as powder dips (arsenical) and has long had the reputation of being prepared with great care We believe the farmer used it with some degree of confidence in face of the printed statement with each package to the effect that this powder dip might be used with poor feet safety if the directions were followed. Unfortunately the results have contradicted this. The directions were followed with ordinary care, you nearly a thousand of the sheep dipped were poisoned. How did this occur It appears the sheep were suffering from scabs, and twice dipping, at an interval of a fortnight, was considered desirable. A large dipping tank was used, that contained some of the solution of the same dip hold over from a previous dipping. This was added to in the usual manner, and the Hock was dipped Owing to the hot weather or some other cause, tina dipping caused some soreness and inflammation of the pelt (or skin of the animals), but much attention was not paid to it The sheep were dipped a second time, as recommended in the directions accompanying the dip, with the result that afterwards nearly a thousand of them died, and in great agonies, caused, as has since been proved, by the absorption of arsenic through the skin. The case appears to be a good deal analogous to that which occurred at Berwick on Tweed some years since, when 850 sheep were poisoned -Field. LORD LONSDALE SUED FOR £20 000. A suit has been commenced in New York by David de Bensaude, husband of Violet Cameron, the actress, against Hugh Cecil Lowther, otherwise known as the Earl of Lonsdale, for <U0OO0O damages for alienating the affections of the plaintiff's wife The husband, in his complaint, says that Violet generally earns about "15 000 a year, and that she " forms an attractive and profitable feature of any theatrical enterprise to which she may be- come attached " he complains that the defendant, well knowing this," has been acting ostentatiously as her manager, " wickedly intending thereby to deprive the plaintiff of the aid and assistance of his said wife." Lord Durham, who is staying in New York, is also being mixed up in the affair, by the newspapers at least. The following document appears in the New York Herald of 7th October " The Casino, New York, October 6, 1886 " To the public, Although it had been my intention to have remained silent upon such a subject, I feel that, owing to the constant attacks made through some of the newspapers, the time has come when justice requires me to say something for the good name and character of Miss Violet Cameron, who has been so cruelly maligned in this country. " Some papers are asking the public to form an idea of Miss Cameron's character apparently on the loose statements of a mere adventurer, who takes no pains to evade his hostility to her, and has sought to deprive her of that which every honest woman is proudest of and loves namely, her moral reputation. I think that the public might in fairness hesitate before pronouncing judgment upon a woman who has sought openly in the courts of England to have her case tried upon the true facts, instead of forming an opinion on unwarranted insinuations founded on unjust suspicions and not on facts. "I think it strange that in a country where men and women claim to be just and generous a woman who bears the respect and admiration of everybody intertown, and whohasgaincd her high prominence and position in the eyes of her fellow country men and women through her straightforward and honest life, should here in a foreign country be robbed of that character on a mere statement of one who has neither reputation, good character, nor responsibility of one sort or kind, and I feel certain every honest man or woman of her own country will i caddy endorse my statement As Miss Cameron's manager I feel myself placed in the most unfortunate and embarrassing position through this man's malignancy. I would have returned at once to England but for the fact that such an act of mine would reflect upon Miss Cameron, and would have been unfair, not to say unmanly, and I trust that the public will not be a party to accepting rumour for facts, and will accord to Miss Cameron the confidence and just respect which she can always claim in her own country. " Let me also beg you to say that, although no one more than myself appreciates the value of free personal criticism upon the living, I do resent unfounded and untrue statements upon the dead, and I absolutely contradict that statement in one newspaper as to the whereabouts and surroundings of my brother on his deathbed. He died in his own house in Bryanston street, London, in the arms of his mother, and surrounded by his own family. Let me further add that, with every wish to be courteous to the Press, yet should they deem it necessary to continue untrue and libellous statements concerning myself and relations, I shall simply instruct my solicitors, Messrs. Howe and Hummel, to act in my behalf, and secure me through the courts the protection and justice which I feel America affords to all. Your obedient servant, Lonsdale." THE WEALTHIEST CABDRIVER IN EUROPE. Every one has heard of our aristocratic cab proprietors. The latest idea is for their owners to drive them. A member of the St James's Club-the most select after the Bachelors' in London drave up to the club door the other day (says the Manchester Guardian) and took up any members who engaged him, charging the legal fare. This gentleman driver resides in Belgrave square, and has three new hansoms on the Birmingham plan He may be seen any afternoon in the West end driving one or other of his vehicles. He is certainly the wealthiest cabdriver in Europe, and boasts the name of one of the oldest families in the south of England. MR BENT AND THE PRISON CHAPEL Mr. BY It, the sculptor, now languishing in durance vile, has set at rest the ghost theory, writes a London correspondent Until he was sent to prison a large community persisted in the belief that he was merely a sculptor broker. Since was committed to prison for his fraudulent transaction with Sir William Abdy, he has been allowed to hit up his time with his chisel He has carved some decorations for the prison chapel, which are said to be highly artistic
