The Sin of Omission, ffTinii't tho thing yon Ho, dear. 1 t'a tho thing vtm'vo loft utulnno, , Which -gives you a htfc of a hoartuuhe At tho sotting of tho huh. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, < TThe flower vou nnglit have Hunt, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. Tho stone you might havo lifted 1 Out of a brother « way, ' Tho bit of hourlsonm counsel Yon weru hurried too much to finy-j s i Tho loving touch of the hand, dear, Tho gentle and witisonm tone, That yon had no tune nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. Tho little nets of kmdnoHs, ' So easily oat of mhut; . Thcso chances to lw ftiigela Which every mortal finds— - Thny como m niglit and Kilenco— Each chill, reproachful wraith Wlion hope ih faint and flagging, i And a bhght lms dropped on fitilh. For life ih all too short, dear, And sorrow ih all too great, < To suffer our slow compassion, That tarries until too late. . And it's not the thing yon do, dent, It's the thing you lea vn undone, Winch gives you the bit of hcnrtacha . At tho sotting of tho sun.
