Suddenly I fancied I saw the misty outline of a prodigious whisker—not the stubbly mutton chop pattern, but the elegant Dundreary sort of thing I had never seen such wliiskers except once before, and then on the cheeks of the departed Dr. Hunter. The Doctor did depart, because he was seen On board at the Sand ridge Pie} . Well, Mr Punch my fancy could not help mixing up Dr. Hunter 1 with these inimitable whiskers. Gradually I saw hands, arms, legs, body, bead, and all connect themselves with the whiskers. A sort of feeling of mysterious awe came over me, and it reached a climax when I saw the gigantic outline of a Turveydrop hat emerge from the fo" of mv perceptions and settle upon the head of the apparition. A cold shiver came over me, and I tried to recollect something out of Shakspeare with which it is considered genteel to address a ghost, but my memory failed me so completely that I could hardly recollect for a tune where to get a gOod glass of beer. At last I partially recovered. I tell you the story without any comment. Have any other of your pub£ this ° P^nomenon ?
