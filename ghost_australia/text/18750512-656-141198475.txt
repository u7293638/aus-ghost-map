RAMBLlNft' NOTES BY A1 'LITERARY .BUSHMAN. . .. - ::BY-Ji Jasper W ? 1 — s.j --, ? NO. II. ;? - ' What is a swag? Tlie great: lexicogra pher, snnff;Consuming, and tea- imbibinjg'Dr Johrisbn, did riot kriow' ' the word in its colo nial acceptation ; he calls it a verb neuter, to 'sink by its own' ?woight.'. ; A. swag ! Magsmon, in their; peculiar, parlarice, tell their .ppnfederates, 'that, they . '.liaye collared the Rwair.' But we halve nothiriK to ' do in this. pappr. with thieves', patter. . Mucli we may. liavb tq ?ay. of ^swags; and] ' swagmen. (The liest'definition I cari find for a swag is that it 'is'' a portable package,' and that it should invariably contain hlanlcets,:ro'r; their' equivaj ilont-^-say,, a 'possum: rug.7 )But .^licn I sot forUi on, .my. ; journey of; discovery . ' up .the river,' I 'had no blankets— riot' the ghost Pf one'; I had, however, a very 'portable package,'' wrapped up in; an; old; Riverine .Grazier, arid I.' carried 'it' urider my arm. §dbri aftbr I left Mbssrs Learmonth's hos pitable stations, I felt' the; want , of . 'the alaukpts,, I assure you. On the track I picked up an old newspaperi'Svhich contained an advertisement, which seemed to mock a blarikotless bushman, as lie entered a very cheerless and dilapidated travellers', hut. Here.it; is.:— .... ,. v . . tOD.^INGS.rrExtra.bed^A. strong- iron folding bedstead, ' 6ft long bjr : 2ft '6in ^ide, with a wool iriattiress, bolster and pil low, complete-' for 21s.. .Samp . items,; 3f; w;de, complete 25s. . ^ent,' carefully packed t 5-r'ms a portable' pachage.'

But I got overj that night, and now have blankets. Look at; the ' prices above quoted. Wonder could; any Hay storekeeper supply such a swag at; even 50 per cent, advance ori the sums therp announced. Query ' ,' i ?- The grave's which ? ori e rrioets with? 'ripon somo stations are suggestive of sorubre thoughts. Fenced around and kept with more or less, care, beneath the - turf., with the ever- flowina and tortuous river riot ' far 1 off — r fit emblem of ; man's life,' flowing ori into the g^eat arid urifathbn able Ocean of Eternity — . far reriioyed from the,; city's -throng, these pion'oers of the plains rest from their labours. To each of them belongs a history, -and in somo cases the course of their lives and the , circumstances of their ' death, have- about them deep, almost romantic, interest. Two marble headstones mark two 'last I homes' on Cuba station : one being sacred to the memory of Mr'Sugden. Biit-how many — ah, how many meri have died in the bush, or on the arid plains, or in the turbid river, who have1 never received Christian burial, whose requiem was weirdly chanted by the ravenous carrion, crows ? Many sad tales could be re lated of ? such 'deaths— from' thirst, snake bite, drowning, or accident— a fall from a bovse, or the capsizing of a dray. So they wont 1 into - 'the ! Shadowy Land-—' unwept, * unhonoured, and unsung !' — almost, it might be said,: unknown. But God knows, ..'.not oven a sparrow falls'; without His'kriowledge. \^hat romarices might be .written albout bush life^witli iriciderits from the Olcl Man, Plain, Qr the Ono-troe, arid, in any. ; o ther easily iperitib'ned localities. /. 1 . .

It- is, therefore, scarcely tp be wondered at if the moral tone' and mental culture of this large class of the community does - not reach or maintain that high starida'rd'which eveiy lovorof his species desires. Yet hbw- very feeble arp the efforts to .bring, about. ,p,,bctter. state pf .things 1 to raiso the hardy sons of toil to a condition above -that of mere working animals. Verily' [I! belieye that many squatters 'think la .igrqat doal more of a team of working bullocks, 'or- horses, or flock of sheep, than they, dolof their station hands. , The fact that these men ' have ; minds ', tp be enlightened^ souls to live eternally in happiness or misery, nevpge^Qtor? jjito ; tho calculations of, iome-of our pastoral princes, .It is the old story ,'of the Rich Mini arid Lazarus, cnlonialised.

This is the secrot c'auso of tho wild outbursts and, intoxicating orgies, of bushmcn when they arrivo in Hay or any othervtowiv-'w-ith- ' thoir hard-oarnodiciieqWs. .
