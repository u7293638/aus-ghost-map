' lifctie John having jjeen scratched at eight minatea .toll,. and Maroaey. withdrawn, on the course, the field foe the Cnplwafi reduced. to eighteen. The. majority looked well, and the feature of the latest betting-was the ran on Briiiahsr, who was freely backed atr& to 1, after, opening at doable that price. Silver Mine kept his place as first favourite*- and thejmbHe.Btffl,puni«i their faith to. Boolka, while- of the outaidetfl Lesbia and Tnar Levite were in most demands The parade waa soon, .got through,, but they were a long time at the port owing to Mill* stream being so unmanageable. When the flag did ™? it was .to a , splendid start, and passing the Stand the lot wejte wonderfully well together. The fall of Jim Cane caused the field to spread out very much at the first turn, and Boolka and Bonnie Doon keeping close in, they went up the hUl well clear of everything. All round the backJBoolka waa prominent, while a deal of use was also made of Britisher, the other favourites, Silver Mine, Recall, and Ben Bolt meanwn3a keeping 2a nice place at' the heels of the leaders. Fire furlongs from home it waa 'all over .with' Boolka, and when jthe torn was reached Britisher, St. John, Levite/ and Silver Mine looked like providing; the winner, aa Power had been hard on Recall for 2 furlongs, and Ben Bolt was some distance away. Once in aline foe home- Silver Mine deserted the Levite and went after Britisher, while O'Brien brought Ben JBolt out. on the hard going in centre of the coarse, and went in porsait of the leaders. SQuer Mine caught Britisher at the distance, and guickly deal ing his measure, the favourite's friends thought the race won, until Ben Bolt, with his immense stride, suddenly swooped down upon the black, and caught him joafc in time to win by a short neck. There was tremendous excitement over the finish, Ben Bolt not being seen in the race until jast at the finish. People at the torn say he was only seventh entering the straight, and O/Brian'a judgment in palling oat an to the old grouna probably won him the race, as the new-going, on which Silver Mine and Britishec finished, is much, softer than the centre of the course. The winner was cheered again and again as he weighed in, the public appearing delighted at a horse, backed for such a Jarge stake proving successful. The Steeplechase 1 wat '' run at a tremendous : pace,' - the lot keeping well together until a mile from ' home, when Contingent, Lady Camngton, a.nA Blackthorn drew away from: the others. ? Lady Oarrington, who struck two fences ? very hard; was the first-beaten of this trio, ana Blackthorn easing up when Corrigan. saw it waa so use chasing Contingent, the places were . filled by * The Irishman -and. Havelock. The winner had plenty in hand at the finish, and cantered home, ten lengths in front.

I * There, waa a delay of ten. minutes at the post, earned principally by ill- temper, on the part of MiQatxeatb, while The Levite indulged in an exhibition of kicking,' which caused him to be left with a clear berth to himself. AtlaBtMiDstreani vraa placed ia the middle of the field and the signal was given to a splendid start. Islander, BooLka, St. John, and Levite appeared to be the first to move, and at the distance St John and Boolka on the rails, with Lesbia, Zeno; and Levite in the centre, were, the moat prominent, with Britisher* and Ben Bolt dear of the others. The lot came to the Stand in very close order, and passing the Judge's box Zeno, Lavite, Boolka, and St John were dead level, and a length behind them were First Consul, BenBoltjTarpeia, Jim Cain, and Bonnie Doon, whttelslandecwaBlast^butthere was not more than, aix lengths between the whole field. Directly after; this ;Jim Cain came down in the middle of ,the -field, and caused a deal of confusion,, all the leaders with the exception of ' Boolka and. Bonnie -Doon - running out very wide at the tarnj and losing a deal of ground; Boolka 'led,- Bonnie Doon and -Mentmore'' -up' the 'hill,' the three being closely '.attended by Britisher, with Recall-- and - Lesbia at-/ the ' head \ of the others, St John, Silver Mine, and Ben Bolt beSag~well placed, at. the head of the main Jbody. ' Passing the. mile post Boolka on the inside -was still to the fore, with Bonnie Doon and Ment more at his girths, and a length off Britisher, and Recall just headed a closely packed bunch, while Tarpeia was beaten m. Along the back the colours of Boolka were being carried just' clear ' of Bonnie -Doon, while Britisher hid: headed Mentmore, and behind the Mordialloo horse came Recall and Levifce, with St.1 John and Silver Mine next, aud Ben Bolt heading the others. At the far turn there was 'very 'little- change, Boolka and Bonnie Doon leading Britisher two lengths, with Mentmore, EecalT,Xevite, and St John next, but 'when they reached the 5- furlong post Boolka had dropped back, and Bonnie Doon waa leading Britisher, and Mentmore, with Levit&r; Recall; Boolka, and St. John next, while Silver Mine waB moving up, the only others in the race being Remus, Lesbia, and Ben Bolt. In the next furlong Britisher joined Bonnie Doon, and at the bend Levite, St John,' and* Silver- Mine were following, Boolka ' quickly; ' dropping behind Lesbia. Recall, and Remus, while Ben Bolt had still a' lot of ground' to -make up. Britisher was the first ? rounding xhe turn, with Bonnie Doon, who was rapidly- compounding, jast clear of Levite, and Silver Mine next, and then- came St' John, followed by Recall, Lesbia, and Ben Bolt, thia lot being on pretty close' terma. Entering the straight Bonnie Doon and The .Levite retired from the %ht, and directly they got in line for home Silver Mine took second place, with St John and Recall' heading Lesbia and Ben Bolt, the latter being pulled out on the bard ground in the centre of the course. Before reaching the distance* SQver Mine caught Brivhhgr, and the Ballarat horse offering a very iyjUi resis tance, to the favourite's chillies h3 quickly lost his place, but Ben B:Ii --r-c.-naupon the scene, and passing L::':'T-; £-.
