FEDERATION. NOTES ON THE CAMPAIGN. By "Yes." The anti-federalists appear to think that there is safety in numbers-of statisticians, and so, accordingly, each week the electors are presented with the results of the gloomy calculations of authorities It would be very interesting to ascertain who these authorities are where they get their data from, how they bring their masterly deductions always to one point, to , the complete financial defeat that is to wait upon New South Wales if the scheme of federation as proposed is carried years But although the anti-federal statisticians always agree as to the broad conclusion, they differ exceedingly as to the effect of it. One day we are gravely told that every taxpayer in this colony will have to pay something like £3 lGs extra taxation yearly , the next it is stated to be a more bagatelle of 22s 6d, and now it is ascertained that " in certain circumstances a man with a wife and four children will have to contribute £8 16s ' Naturally taxpayers. who have been favoured by Providence with a wife and four children do not appreciate this putative federal blessing , but there is really no occasion for alarm In the first place " in certain circumstances there is a judicious caution about that phrase taxpayers under existing conditions may have to pay a good deal more than £8 lGs If they smoke expensive cigars and drink costly were on a liberal scale they contribute for more to the revenue than humbler citizens who indulge in neither of these habits , but there is really nothing in the constitution to force the people as a whole to waste their substance on champagne and remus And perhaps, if there was, the general body of taxpayers would accept the situation with equanimity. . . a But the strong point (for the federalists) about all these pessimistic arrays of figures is that those who marshal them, in reality, violently opposed each other One day we are told that the cost of living will be so much increased by a protective tariff that life will be scarcely worth living in this colony, and it is not without its laughable aspect to find that this warning usually comes from gentlemen who, all their lives, have expatiated on the virtues and benefits of protection ' Now, it is the drying up of our rivers the deliberate filching of our water reserves by the other colonies that is to yoke our patient taxpayers for over in the unscrupulous service of the General Treasurer, and then it is the designing Victorian senators and representatives who will saddle up with all the additional cost of federal government One moment we are to be ruined, we are told by the freetrade anti-billites, because of the anticipated downfall of our freetrade system (though, to be sure, we do got intercolonial freetrade all round), and the next our downfall will come about, say the protectionist and Sillitoe, because of the heavy tariff that will be instituted against the rest of the world, and which will greatly increase the cost of living says What the electors would like to know what they should insist upon the anti- billites telling farmers how diametrically opposed policies will contribute to this uniformly disastrous result But the anti-billites are in so great haste to frighten the electors of New South Wales with horrid-looking spectres, that they do not consider it worth while to remember that they are manufacturing their ghosts in full view of their audience-and a most attentive and short one it is, too little consistency would go a long way at this juncture , but couaiBtonoy was noverapart of their pins A * . But it is extremely difficult to be consistent sometimes, and in this case the difficulty is aggravated It is apparent that the anti-billites are hopelessly divided amongst themselves One section will have none of the bill, because it is " un- democratic " and does not commend itself to the " platform " , the other because " the intellectual and professional " centre of Australia (sydney) is not to have the capital But both sections cm ploy precisely the same arguments to prove their entirely different cases, and the arguments are generally hysterical appeals to the blandest sort of " self interest " No doubt many of the anti- bullies are sincere and able men, but the party, as a whole, seems to have adopted Mr Biglow's pithy creed - N I du believe in bein this Or that ez it may happen One way or t other landless is To ketch the people living in it in t by encircles nor men My prudent course is steadied I scent which pays the best, and then Go into it baldheaded But perhaps at this crisis of our affairs the instinct which has often enabled some of our politicians to " scent which pays the beat " has failed them. There are many signs that the passing of the constitution is assured says One of the most hopeful is the great and intelligent demand that has set in for all kinds of literature bearing on federation This applies particularly to working men, who are reading authorities, real authorities, on the broad aspects of federation In the libraries and reading-rooms Bryce and Freeman and Bagehot have been in steady demand, and the effect of this kind of first hand inquiry ought to be very great The mass of the electors are content to entrust the handling of the union to Mr Reid and Mr Barton, and the great coalesced parties behind them , but they are absorbing for themselves the theory, so to speak, of federation The course is calculated to give them a more lofty outlook, to enable them, perhaps, to view without flinching the dread threat of an extra penny postage under federation says The extra penny postage throat has been called the penny-in-the-slot argument Put a penny in the slot and got what you want a stick of chocolate or a brand new up-to-date federal Constitution , but shun any machine that makes a greater demand than a penny an your purse or patriotism That seems to be the extra penny postage argument, But it is paining of It makes too large a demand on the faith of the electors, and faith was once cynically described as " the faculty to believe that which we know to be untrue " But that kind of faith can be taxed too far It has been taxed too heavily already, much more than the people of New South Wales will ever be under the Constitution says A note of Charles Dickens on Washington may be interesting He said, "It was originally chosen for the seat of government, as a means of averting the conflicting jealousies and interests of the different States, and very probably, too, us being remote from motives consideration not to be slighted, even in America It has no trade or commerce of its own, having little or no population beyond the President and his establishment, the members of the Legislature who reside there during the session, the Government clerks and officers employed in the various departments, the keepers of the hotels and boarding houses, and the tradesmen who supply their tables It is very unhealthy Taw people would live in Washington, I take it, who were not obliged to reside there and the tides of emigration and speculation, those rapid and re- gardless currents, are little likely to flow at any time towards Buck dull and sluggish water " In all probability, except that it need not be unhealthy, the capital of federated Australasia will excite a similar description Without setting up for a profound politician, Dickens had enough strong common sense to see that those " rapid and regardless currents" of speculation and emigration were not likely to flow to a place simply because it happened to be the capital Nor have they nor will they hero Ino into billets try to persuade the electors to an exactly opposite way of thinking But the electors will adopt the attitude of Dr Johnson replying to Macpherson "Sir," he said, "I shall pay greater attention to what you prove than what you say " 4 6 6 4 6 It is said that the federal cause is making excellent progress in Newcastle and its district No one need be surprised at that Ino minors, perhaps, conBli into the most intelligent class of politicians among the workers With their strong leaven of North country and shrewd Scotch blood they are not likely to be led away by the claptrap of self-appointed leaders of the people " And, moreover, they have suffered greatly in the past, and owing to the fierce competition in the coal industry of late years the outlook for them has not been cheerful They have all to gain and nothing to lose by federation The ridiculous statement has been put forward that federation will foster the Victorian coal trade at the expense of Newcastle, but it can no more do that than can bi-metallism put a stop to early marriages As a matter of reasonable deduction, it is tolerably certain that the Newcastle coal trade will receive an immense impetus under federation. Manufactures will spring up and where are manufacturers so likely to begin as close to the coalfields t Then again, with the vista of a great intercolonial commerce opening, it may be taken for granted that the known iron resources of the colony will be developed ; which, of course, means life and activity to the coal industry. England's commercial greatness has largely sprung from her possession of coal and iron deposits. We have the coal ; with federation we shall have the iron. It may compensate us for the extra penny postage.
