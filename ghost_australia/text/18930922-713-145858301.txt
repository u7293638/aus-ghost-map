They were accompanied as far as Sydney by Miss Grace Norman, who is the guest of Lady Duff. Mbs. Lewis Kibble gave another of her most enjoyable "small dances" at her residence, "Moul trassie," South Yarra, on Friday last. There were between 60 and 70 present, and the iianoing was kept up with great spirit; the musio being supplied by Herr Schwartz. Mb. H. J. Farmer, solicitor, of Clifton-street, Richmond, gave a dance at his residence, on Wednes day. September 13, in honour of his son, Mr. Francis Farmer, attaining his majority on that day. An " At Home" was held by Mr. Robert Harper, of " Myoora," Toorak, in the interests of the War rawee Club, an institution that has shown a dispo sition to languish of late for want of concerted measures to make it a success. The guests, of whom there were a large number, were received by their hostess in the music-room, a large and pleasant apartment, lighted specially from the roof, as it also serves the purpose of a picture gallery j it contains, amongst others, some very fine landscape paintings. The objects of the society were set forth by Miss Violet Chomley, its treasurer, they being to form a meeting place, without distinction of class, for women who either worked themselves, or took an interest in those who were compelled to work. Miss Chomley dwelt much upon the praotical benefits, to be derived from the club, and she expressed regret that through inadequate funds they had been cpm pelled to close at nights ; they were desirous! to reopen. Mrs. Emery Gould, with equal insistance upon the practical advantages of the Club, spoke feelingly of what may be called its higher interests in creating a wider spirit of communion amongst women, letting those who led isolated lives feel that they had an attractive and common ground ion which to meet. The meeting was wholly successful —many new members joining. Mrs. Harper's gener ous sympathy and charming hospitality contributing in no small degree to this end. I The oharity "bread and butter ball", which takes place at the Prahran Town Hall to-riight (Friday), promises to be a perfect success. It is under the patronage of His Excellency the Governor and Countess of Hopetoun, and. the o.ommittee have worked most energetically to make it enjoyable, j
