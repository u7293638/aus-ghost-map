' I should not be' at all surprised to'seo him a much improvod horse. : Volunteer has not. won much, : but his perform ance lias booii vory good ; in fact, in my opinion it is bbttor than Cannonball's. The] first notice I liavo of him is ih 1870, when he stripped for the Maiden Plate at Brisbane.' The race was won by Greyskim (9st. llbi) ;-Zenobia (8st. 21bs.) second ; Volunteer- (9st. i'81bs.) a: good third. So von othors also started, amongst them Ruddlo's Count Bismarck. Ho also rim in tho Queens land Turf Club Handicap, with 7st. lOlbs. Wo noxt find Mm ' at Ipswich, whore he pbrformed very creditably ; but ho was evidently out of condition, for a sporting writer thus roinarks— ' V.oluntoor racod well all through, but his con dition spoiled liis chance. ' .. He earned 9st. 8lbs. in the Maiden Plato, and although only fourth, ho appears to, hayo run woll. Zenobia (8stl 41bs.) won the raco, but tho contest tor second honours is thus described-^' A good race for second placo ensued betwebn Volunteer, Bismarck, and Greyakim, who had -raced together for up wards of half-a-mile.' Bismarck was sooond ; thus clearly showing that Volunteer was out of form, as ho had previously boaten. Bismarck in Bria baub.; It will bo obsorvod that Volunteer has so far been in really first-class company ; and al though ho gave Zonobia 1st. 61ba. in Brisbane, tho maro only, managed to boat him up the straight aftor . a hard tussle. Tb give those in terested some idea what sort of stuff Zonobia is made of, I nood only add that that same year slip .boat Grafton,; in the St. Leger. Volunteer ran in Brisbane tliia yoar, but I boliovo lie was not' properly looked aftor. He was afterwards bought by iMr,; Jumes Con way, his present owner, and appears to havo had a good tiiuo of it. He. ran horo last July, and his, victory over Con federate at only a diftbronce of 7 lbs. stamps him as a very good horso, and worth looking after. In conclusion, I might remark that for the Bris bano Ovip in 1870, Prbmior wits top woight at 9st. lllbs. ; Caiinonbair8 woight boing 7st. 'lOlhs.- At tho same mooting Premier was handicapped at 9at. lllbs. for the big handicap ; Voluntoor, 7st; lOlbs. .__ ? ?. - -..-?.' .::
