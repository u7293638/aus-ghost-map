V.R.C. SPRING MIEBTING. (FROM OUR OWN REPORTER.) MELDOURNE, Nov. 1.. After two or throee very sultry days the weather changed on Friday night, and rain, beganto fall at midnight, and continued all night heavily. The weather cleared tosards morning, but during the forenoon heavy showers again fell, consequently the attendance at the opening of the V.R.C. Spring Meeting on Saturday woas small, but the afternoon keeping clear the numbers increased towards Mliaribyrnong Plate time, when probably 35,000 people were present. Ils Excellency the Governor and Lady Loch, and suite, and also the Governor of SouthAuatralia,were present,and the grand atndA was well filled, but the dull weather detracted from the customary brilliancy of toilettes. There was a good deal of growl ing at the train arrangements, which led to agreat deal of delay in returning. The lookmakers had a bad day of it all through, in consequence of the winning of favourites in the weight for age events. The Derby inish was one of the finest ever seen on the course, and caused great oexcitemoent. Kelso, the rider of First Chester, was hooted by the public, who thought that lhe made an attempt to block Nordenfoldt on the post, but afterwards it was concluded that it was an accident, as the breaking of a surcingle which got between First Chester's legs caused him to swerve. Mr. George Watson occupied his old post as starter, and was warmly cheered. All the jockeys wore a black band on the left arm as a tribute to the memory of Donald Nicholson. The racing was excellent, but the course was rather heavy owing to the rain which at in early in the morning. Trenton won the Melbourne Stakes after an excellent rce with Sheet Anchor. Mr. D. O'Brien, the owner, won a nice stake, and tle horse hooch fancied by his stable for the Cup. Trenton is a four-year- old, and is by the lately defunct Musket, out of Frailty. This is his first semson in Australia. In New Zealand, as a two and three-year-old, he showed excellent form, and was a warm farourito for the C.J.C. Derby, but he went amiss, and his owner was compelled to scratch him. Sheet Anchor ran a sme .horse, and was assisted by the heavy going, and he must make a good fght for the Cup if the going is at ali hard, as he meets T' uton on six pounds better terms. The stable, however, up to this race fancied Britisher, who beat him ina trial. Sheet Anchor will be greatly served by his gallop. Lesbia won the llotham HIandicasp, after an excellent fiish, and landed .2000 for her owner. Agent was a great favourite for the Iurdlo Race, and pulled his admirers through after a fine race, in which Gasalier did not disgrace herself. Thie Maribyrnong Plate brought out a good lot of two-year olds, but Acme literally romped honme, and the race was never won in such hollow fashion. She made good time, and it is hard to say what she would have done if the going had been good. Such a speedy youngster has never been seen before in Australia. She is rather on the small side, hut-possesses plenty of strength and quality. Her public form was verified, as Tladdelina, Blairgowrio, and Louise Berts, thethree other best performers, finished next the winner but they never had a thousand to one chance of beating Acmes. The Selling Race, injudiciously set before the Derby, attracted little attention, and was won by Albanus, a son of Proto-Martyr. The inspection of the Derby candidates then occupied the attention, and those whose looks pleased me most were Nordoen feldt, Thunderbolt, and Isonomy, although the latter was hardly so well as he might hate been. First Chester, too, had fallen away since his arrival, and Uralla was not greatly liked, althoughI the stable cluing to her, and Hales, in deference to Mr. Whito's wish, rode her in preference to Norden feldt. The latter maintained his position as favourite, despite a good demand which set in for Uralla at 7 to 1. At the close of the race the public were right in their l.dganent, as Uralla was never in it at any time, while Nordenfeldt came with the eourage ofa bull-dog, and beat First Chester in the last couple of strides by the shortest of lheads a few yards from home. First Chester swerved and interfered with the 'inner, but apparently did more damage to 0is own charge than to Nordenfeldt, who, however, must have got the race if the other had beaten him. Opinions were divided as to the merits of the win. A good many think that Nordenfeldt would have wen easily if the pace had been good all through, while many others think that the' Derby horses are a Umoderate lot and have no show for the Cup. Thunderbolt was never dangerous, while his stable com panioan Winchester ran a good horse and was a close third. Dunlop disappointed isadnmirors, and after the turn was reached was out of it. Isonomy ran a real good horse, but was made a little too much of. Nordenfoldt's weight is now increased to tat. 5lb. for the Cup. The hen. J. White it is understood only wins a small stake over tihe Derby, but a good one on the aribyrnong PSate. The Coburg Stakes brought a good day's racing to a finish. The Bohemian, who was backed for more money then anything at the last, scored a nood victory. The ring fared badly uring the day, especially over the Mari yrnong Plate aud Derby, while Nordcn fldt is anything but a good horse for tlhem or the Cup.o Tile following is doatilecd account of MliinomuOR STAKEs-A sweepstakes of 5 seos. each,2 ft., with 300 ove, ' added; second horse to receive 50 soves. out of the stake.

After one or two attempts the flag fell toan excellent start. Reuus went off with the lead, followed by Nqrdenfeldlt, Isonomy, and T''lunderbolt in the order named. The pace for the first hlalf-mile was slow, Romus leading, but at the end of tle mile he fell back. The pace then became fast, and Isonomoy, who had assumed the lead, kept it till eoutering the straight, where First Chester came and got a commanding lead. Ellis was driving Nordenfeldt along and overhauled First Chester steadily, and a determined finish was fought out. Wihen a hundred yards from home First Chester swerved and blocked Nordenfeldt, whom Ellis had to pull out, but le persevered, and thence to the post inch by inch gained on the leader, passing the judge a neck aheod of First Clester amidst great ex citoment. Winchester passed Thunderbolt and Isonomy when neacr homi. and finished a lengtlh and a half behind First Chester. The judge iloisted Uralla's number at first, and a scene of some confusion ensued.
