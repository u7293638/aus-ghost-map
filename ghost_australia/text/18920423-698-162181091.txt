The Miser's Ghost. A certain clergyman, detained late one night, at a friend's house, accepted, unhesitatingly, the offer of sleeping accommodation in the only disengaged room —the haunted chamber. Xow, as the reverend gentle man made it a practice never to travel ever so short a distance without some abstruse theological work in his pocket for perusal at odd moments, it is not sur prising that on this occasion he sat up till after the pitching hour ; indeed, it was nearly 1 o'clock a. m. when, in a complete but threadbare mediaeval suit, the vapoury spirit of yet another miser — a skin flint ancestor of the clergyman's host — appeared before him, whom the ready-witted parson at once J.U.LA^J. * IX- ** t-VA CUOIIjU A.£l(,L- (.10 1.U11U 1* i3 „ J, aiUV/11 J1I1T.

And with this lie politely presented a. subscription list for the renovation of the parish church. ' You will see.' ho went on, ' I have here the names of some of the most influential ?
