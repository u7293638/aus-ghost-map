A Bishop to Shouting Methodists. At a recent conference of Methodist ministers at El Paso, Texas, one speaker referred to the activity of the Catholic's building churches, seminaries, hospitals and magnificent sanitariums. He wanted the Methodists to do likewise. Bishop Duncan sanctioned the idea, and asked if it was not a fact that tlie servants employed by tlie Protestants of El Paso gave a certain stipend of their weekly salary to tlie Catholic Church, while the Methodists kept their religion to shout over and liave a good time' with, but did not 'build on if. " " Our good sisters," lie exclaimed;.do not. give as much in a month as (be Catholic serving woman glfes to her church in a week. Willie we Methodists are out in the woods shouting over our religion aud having" a-good time,- the Catholic's.-are; at ."Wiirk--;building colleges, '-sanitariums and: hospitals. No man ever raised a crop by standing •to the field ' hollering' over it,'' I have sometimes thought, when looking on a church full of children, there is nothing more beautiful in the sight of God. A beautiful garden of •roses, lilies and lovely flowers is sweet and beautiful to the eye. The hand of man guards and watches over it so that, no harm can enter. Sometimes a storm of wind or hail breaks the lilies, destroys the roses aiid makes ruin where before all ,was sweet, and or- . derly. The wicked and malic- ious man conies to to wreck and ruin bis neigMbour'S jgai-den, and when he sees this, everybody, is touched to the heart. Everything lovely aud sweet, trampled down and wrecked, makes the people grieved ; 'but, in the sight of .God, not the most -beautiful garden fashioned by ItlieVhand of ~ pia'u, not even, ili<»*V3oi\\.i'A.T i-ru/1™ -*.-5Vh" ri11 its -"uiin, via* BO "prjgiiit qna-giorions an aTe the so ulsof] ittle children in whom Jhe Holy Ghost dwells.- Sitch a scene. is sweeter and brighter in, t"hVfligM of Moa than - nnv o-nr^nn - ever formed
