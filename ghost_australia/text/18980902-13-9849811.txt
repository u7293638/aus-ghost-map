THE BENDIGO GHOST SCARE EXTRAORDINARY STORY. BENDIGO, Thursday. An extraordinary cirumstance in connec- tion with the prevailing ghost scare was re- ported to the police to- night. Constable Owens was called to the house of the young man Johnson who was arrested on Tuesday night while masquerading in female attire in quest of the "ghost," and found a young woman named Sarah Skilbeck apparently in a state of collapse. Johnson's parents said that the girl had been coming to the house about 8 o'clock, and when she was within 20 yards of the gate a figure in white came from behind her and capered in front of her. She threw a stone at it, and was imme- diately struck on the mouth and knocked senseless. Her screams had been heard and young Johnson rushed out just in time to see a figure in white flit up the street and vanish over a fence . The girl was car- ried into the house by a neighbour who was attracted to the scene and a doctor was sent for. The constable could get no statement from the girl herself. He examined the fence over which the ghost was alleged to have gone, and found it to be quite 7 ft. high, and one which he would be willing to give a runaway a start of minutes. More- over the vegetation inside bore no marks. The spot is said to be the same as that at which Mrs. Johnson was frightened some nights ago.
