'' ' THE i BED INN. TowiBOS tb*«IoM«f a,«oM, blfskld.y is ibe early winter of J*»4 }. '. *&$ myt.ll waiting anxiously and iupaUtnUy In a lonely and ptotureique spot en tbe banks of tbe Ottawa riv«r, about twelvs miles from tb* jlittl* town of St. Botuebe, whence I bad ?ridden that attemooa, and thirty or mor* from Montreal. ' I belonged lo a private-dslecuve agency, and waa ben In this lonely plane by appoint. u.tel ?_!!*- aatw wtt#tHatiwlil flAllftM wlMAM wMSs person, In exchange for whioh It had been agreed— by what secret and complicates' n«. got|tUon. it It hardly necessary to acquaint the reader with— to restore to me certain ttalon property in tbe thap* of bonds, en. tlfleates, and bills of exchange to a gnat amount. The place, at I hive said, was wild and romantic, with a rdntd sawmill at th* fiver's edge, hut b*low tht ateep and rocky bluff, aa 4b. only vettigt of arUBdaUty in vltw. Tb» sky was ovtreatii ani4h* wind moanlog dismally tbroagh the Ovtrbangln« fin and hemlocks; tba broad, partly froian river, with the rnggtd monnteint looming forbiddingly on tbe (ui'ther btok, and a ftw seagulls screaming and swooping weirdly in. tbe suits between th* low olouds and tb* runniog loam, looked intxpnttlbly mouro ful and deiolate, and tbe appointed hour bad long alnc* passtd m* by without affording tbe faintest indication that tbe rendesvotu was to be kept. Tears of «xp*ri*noe in my peculiar vocation with criminals and dMpante classes had Inured ma to dlwppolutmsnt and fortuity ; but I must acknowledge that upon this oeoaalon I felt my patimc* tonlr tri*d. I had every reason to believe that the compromise bad been eStottd In good faith (notwithstanding tbe wily and utenvlabl* reputation of the go-between, who had arranged for my meeting with 'Crunk Dudley,' the head thief concerned lo the robbery, at this partlenlar hour tad place), and oy rid* thither from St. Eustach* bad bean slowly and wearily pursued over an unfrequented und tnostvUltlnou. trail, which it would be an abuse ot language to denominate a road, and onr which I anticipated considerable difficulty io re tracing my ttepa should I cluno* to be belated. At length, however, i concluded thtt Crank had either met' with some delaying accident 01' deemed it unsafe to'kwp hli appointment — he was an old aud shrewd oB'txAer, whom any deteetiv* would bsvn oh»erlully hit a finger to eapturc-^and, nmcuoting my horse, spurred up the bank to ngaln th* road. ? I had hardly dan* so before aa indistinct but unmlstaksbl* wan ing prompted me to unwonted haste. It wu the touch ol asuowonke melting upon my ohetk. Fully alir* to th* tenon of tb* first gnat snowfall of a Canadian winter, I rurtwj rapidly forward in the hop* of reaching St. Eastaob* before the ground should b* covered. But I bad not prooetdad a mile before th* track was hopalusly obliterated, and the air so thick with tbe allenb sittings of th* .now, ;whuh cam* down almost as fin* as meal, at to r«ndar tha landscape Invisible, tav* tor a ftw yards around 1 added to which tbs temp*ratu-* was rapidly tall log, and the wind rlilag In a nunnsr tug gtstlve el bnast-deep drift! and dangerous pitfalls. There wa. no plaoe to turn back to, and to push forward Involved a certainty of being both benighted and lost io th* woods. In this prsdlcament, I recalled a half ruinous, little red-wa»hed hostelry, rejoicing in the -.me ot tbs Bid Inn, whioh I hid noticed at tome distance from th» rotdeil)* shortly before naahlog th* river, and which had afforded so little signs of life ss I rods by it as to gin m* the Impresilon that It had long sloe* bean abandoned. But ' any port In a storm ' was now my motto, and, swerving a little to the left of the trick, or what had been the track, I tporred forward Id a direction that I thought would lsad to its vicinity. I was not only anon apprised of my proximity to It by the birk of * dog, but, upon citohlng sight ot th* home itself— a nmbllng, two-story, frame affair, whose side. bad long before lost moit of the dull, red colour that gave It a name as a public-home — I was ovarjnyed tote* the lower windows glowing with firelight. To obtain admittance, give my horse In charge of tb* proprietor, who aeemed to bs tbe only man about the placo, and aeoure a capital tbawing-ipot before the gnat fire niartsk In tha Anmmnn tnnm wtLliin At ttttilitli the nonsewlfe was alto busying uerielf with some cooking, was tbt work of bnt a few moments. . 'She was a tell, bony, rooionlar woman, In middle life, with a restless, aniian expression of the eye that augured badly of her husband's peace ol mind, and a general gloom and taciturnity of bearing. Jut I bar*, a way of apeedily making myself at ease with talks of varioui sorts, and drew from ber in a few minutes thtt tbe wat Scotch and ber husband a French Canadian ; that they lived there all alone tinea tbe building of the nearest railway bad alto gether distraoted travel from what bad oooa wen (be decent highway nfar at band ; and 'tbat they were to poor it to be eager to sell out at tb* first opportunity, though still abl* to accommodate any unfaitidlom gutit who might cbanes along, as I hnA done, .

I could return to St. Eustscb* in a couple of bouT»,i( I only had a guide,' aaU t, looking anxiously out at tbs gathering twilight, through which 'tbs snowstorm wu still whirling its sifted ' burthen with fierce pertlateney. ' BcildM, I fear tbat I have jsrely enough money with me to meet even tnyexpenieialyoarinn. ' . ? ?? As I thnw out this f tit* scent as to my elroumitaneet, I noticed the mtti and woman exehug* a swift glance of mingled cunning and Inoredalltr. and tbe man alto tpoke a few words in F«noh, which I pretended to ovtriiosr In a puzzled way, aa though I did not understand. ' 'It Isn't likely yo'*l!

I medo theto menial notes in far lets lime than it hat taken me to etprots them her* ; and when I resutcod my teat by tho fire with on air of all the earelovwoat and trustfulness that I could assume, Bourahots piaoed some fflaases and a bottle of brandy upon the lablo, and gruffly invited mo to oin him in un petit twrre. Bat 1 mado a -olnt of never drinking out of strange bottlst under suspicious cTrcumstenoos. and, Mousing myself on the plea of being undwr medioal tri'attnent for a painful oomplatut, I produoed my own brandy flask, which I pretended to nave Ixwn espcoially prepared tor me by my physician, and, ponria^ out 1 small quantity, touched his ituus merrily , it the tame time wishing bim and his lonsort hotter luck in the future. Ho teemed a little Ukon aback by thli nanmuvre, and only replied to my well ?risbos by first a grunt, and Uion a short itttor laugh, aa in derision at tbe piepos ieroutness of their purport; after which ho krose,:Snd, opening tho door— through prhloh a oolutun of enow oamo suddenly nulling Ilka an angry ghost— whistled In Iho dcyf— a rough, savant- looking brute, of Lhe stunted Newfoundland stock, which, iftor enulUng of my logs eurpldou.ly, ?hook the snow from bit shaggy coat, and ?towed hiunolf away in a corner. The nipper, which wu soon ?forward, ?erved u. by the wom.n, mad* up lo quantity what it I10UJ In quality— conitailog of bacon and venlmn, with not griddUcaksi ind exoellrnt oi)O*e : and as I wu both bungry and tired I rnjoyni It very much. There wu nothlnit to reid whan It wu over, and, u neither my host Bur holt*., ippeand to datin aoolablllty In th* way of Malversation, I wu soon dozing comfortably In my chair, though ifter an old habit of mine wbloh toiblei me to ujoy th* rtouptr itlon '1 semi slumber without altogether ?butting out a ooniclousneu of what is going no in the waking world around me. IIi-w*v*r, u I hoard them speakiag together in low volcel, and In Prenob, I paid little attention to what they wen' saying until a reference 011 th* part of th* man to ' Mon.lsur L» Crank' at ono* aroused n* to livelier attention, and to a wcollertlon it my r»ore«nt nodenvoni-makiir of the river-bank at the aim* time; but th* woman Holy said in roponie : ' Y*i, tbli Is nnmls tatktblr the man,' and thin their conversa tion drllted noon tonic* of a personal nature, ?blob soon developed Into a Acnjagal wrangle, tnd tnlgbt bav* proceeded to blows bad I not uit then itretohed mjielf with a yawn, and ixpreaaed a daitre to b* shown to my room. Before obeying mo, th* landlord again opened th* door, and kinked tb* dog ont Into U« itorni, after which he lighted a candle, ind led tbe way up a narrow, rickety «Ulr »H that aaoruded from a little corridor imt jff tbe side of th* room occupied by tb* firs plan, and. proceeding along a hallway to what must htve bean the r'niot- iit Htremlly at the looMy hcuae, ushered me Into a large, bare. walled chamber, devoid of furniture except, a bsd.tead, a small Ubls, and a tbree l«gged stool, hot nomswbat rmlrtmed from ibnolntt ohemlessDess by a bright wood-fire lhat had twen built upon the hearth, and whose leaping fiama-toeguM went np tba chimney with a roar as 'b» flenx utora shock th« one window at if with a giant's gntap. Altogether, tho accommodation wss better than I had anticipated, and, after itnarittg myself tbftt tbe door wa* provldod with both lock and bolt of substantial juality, I bade my host good-night, locked myself in, and prepared to make mysnlf jomfortebln for the night. After a brief 'lamination of the walls, to mako sun there was no other entrance, I took oft' iverylhinc bat ray undergarments, heaped the fire with all tho spare wood that bad been provided, blew out tho candle, and, leaping into the luxurious undulations of Luold-faahloned feather-bed— after potting ny revolver under my pillow— waa toon lOuad aaleep.
