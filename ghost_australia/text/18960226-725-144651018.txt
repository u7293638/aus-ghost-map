TrtAVEI^fjltR. UP THE STELVIO! Neu-Spondingi&n;£^^\^^ltsnainD would seenr-io indicate, nor is Jt ^even ^', viUsge ; it is merely a taverh wluoh' is run' by a woman, and a ve^^retty woman, top,' : whose low, soft voioo seems -'to captivate you the moment yon hear it. - and- which enables ;her to overcharge you without' a ringle pro-! test on' your part. -She has, I understand, been very soocessfol In the hotel businesp. The tavern isrituated at the cross -road s\ and from the corner of the hotel begins .the long, straight road that loads to the. Tyrolese. end., of the Stolvio Pass, the highest road pass in Europe. When I reached Neu- Spondtag it was dark, and had been dark for some time. The slow bos eetme down there with a great ap petite, and I must admit that the hotel pro vided an exceedingly. arond dinner, with an'^ excellent half bottle of Tyrolese wine. If you know the right laud of dine to ask. for, you get a very-excellent drink. There is a factory at -Bntzen whore they make wine oat of Idgwttfcl and~'eoifietIung else which is ex ported as .Tyrolese wine, but I understand it is not so good as that made from tbe grapes whioh clothe the hillsides of the Tyrol. The stuff 'brewed at the fsotory is for export only and so there is no pablio opinion about it. locally, hut the people of - the Tyrol know bettor than todrink it. When I awoke in the morning and looked out ot the ^window I ? found that I was at the VCTy end of the -earth. The mountain rose opposite any winddw with 'only the width of ; the road, die main road leading to Heran, between the earth andthe window'. I looked out of the window to see the topxrf the hill; bnt np, and up, wont the earth. Then-I - raised the window and put my head out, gating upwards, trying to see the top of the . mountain but ! eouldnotsee itr. . -It is one of these places that it takes two men to seethe top of.. as the old |olce. has it. On the other side of tbo hotel there is a wide and extensive, view ; you can see across the valley for two milos, then come tremendous . hills, and over rthe tops of the first monntains can oe seen the snowy peakB of-tiie great OrtibrBange. The Old ,. Ortier itself, -ih^.vMont^ahcol ^ /the; Tyrol, Ss not to be seen from any valley-: '^To' ?get A vifiwof it, you nrast olimb forthoasands of feet up the pass. It is a beautiful moun- ^ trin; shaped something - like the bald headof^ tin fntfliftfttnaf man, oovered witb eternal snow. : Hie morning was lovriy, without , a dond ' in the sky, and I resolved to foot it up'the| Stelvio Pass, at least far enough^to get a sight of Old. Ortier. I tookaoamera with me/a oamera made in Milan, which carries the continental size of glass, which -differs somewhat from the English-and American measurement of plate: It 'was anewiind of earners; nnd repRsaited the highest deve^ lopment of cam^a -making as ttnaerstood by ^e ltslianB^ It woidd do anything from a sn&p-;^iot to a time exposure. .1 had been two months* In' Switzerland - with a^brandnow knapsackhoughtin London; audit seemed a jntyto carry that .knapsack back to London witfcdnt ever onoe having ;bad it on my back. j I^elt I oould not oonv 8cientiously meet the ghost of John Brown, whose knapsack was ^trapped npOn his back/ if I did not carry my knapaaok~4or at least one day*s journey ; so I put the camera |n ihe koapBaclc along with lohuAb ftnd other 'neoessitiesof life and started up/the Stdrio, ' The first ' two miles of the road were levri - waDting; , then - 1 paffied thtoagh the^very muddy village of jfrad.
