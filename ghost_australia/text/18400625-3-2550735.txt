Metrical Versions Of the Collects for the Sunday's in Advent. BY CLERICUS CANTABRIGIENSIS. 1ST. SUNDAY IN ADVENT. O God Almighty, may thy grace effect, That we the ways of darkness may reject; O clothe us in the panoply of light, Now in this mortal life, equipp'd for fight, In which it pleas'd thy Son Christ Jesus well, In great humility with us to dwell; That in that last concluding day of time, When glorious in His Majesty sublime He shall return, His Church triumphant's head, To fix the doom of living and of dead. We may be rais'd by His all potent breath To life eternal, free from pain and death. Thro' Him, who evermore co-op'rative With thee, and with the Holy Ghost doth live And reign, all this, we humbly pray thou'lt give. COLLECT FOR 2ND SUNDAY IN ADVENT. O, ever blessed Lord, Whose boundless love to man Has caus'd thy Holy Scripture word To them, redemption's plan; Has caus'd it to be written for Our learning; Mighty Creator. In suchwise, grant that we May hear it, read, mark, learn, And inwardly digest, to see, And clearly to discern Its meaning, so thy holy word, Patience, and comfort shall afford. And thus we shall embrace, And everfast retain The blessed promise of thy grace Life's everlasting reign, Which in Christ Jesus thou hast giv'n The Saviour who came down from heaven.
