PORTFOLIO. Live a Life of usafrmness. Itis desirable to engage in some definite work for God. And asyou work, let the thought often come across you that He lures you with more than a father's affection,or a mother's tenderness. C.nt it your greatesthappi ness to be employed in any way for Him. Depend upon it, God has some work for you to do-some work for which you are specially fitted and some work in the doing of which you will be sure to find a bless ing either to yourself or to others and perhaps to both. Be sure of this-It was never intended that any one of us should be useless. Live a Lfe of Purity and Holiness. We should be ever growing in likeness to God. The child should be like his father. He should "grow up unto Him in all things." We should be ever fighting the good fight; overcoming evil, and acquiring day by day fresh Christian graces. Oh for purity of heart and life l the Apostle says " Keep thyself pure," pure in our bodies as well as in our souls. Let us remember that " our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost ;" and that we must keep them pure and undefiled if we would live unto God. It is true, we shall never reach perfection here. But as he who would hit the mark must aim high, so should we. We should be constantly growing. Our course should be as theshining light of the sun, " which shineth more and more till it reaches its meridian height." And if we feel-as we most likely shall feel-that sin cleaves to us to the very last, we will keep our eye all the more steadily fized on the cross, content to the end of our days with the humble prayer of the publican, " God be merciful to me a sinner."-" 3Y .Father," by the Right ier.
