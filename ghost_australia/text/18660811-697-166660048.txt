THE WINTER EVENING. It is a stormy evening, And the cold wind howls without i Rattiing tbe northern windows, Shaking the trees about. But in this pleasant play-room Wc do not feel its pow'r, A6 round the lire wc gather For one short, cosy hour : x or nurse wui leu a siory, Not one of ghosts and fay6, But taken from the Bible, Sweet talcs of olden days : Of David and Goliath — Of Christ the Holy Child Of children whose hosannus Were warbled sweet and wild : And how the loving Saviour Will cherish children still, And smile on these who love Him„ And try to do His will. And now it is our bed-time, So thankfully we'll go; For there are many wand'rers All^homclcss in the snow. But first we'll sing together Our little eveniug song, And praise the great Creator For mercies the day long.
