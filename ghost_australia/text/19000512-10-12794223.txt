experience has proved a fertile source of inspiration to writers of many ages in tho realms of prose, poetry, and music Tho canal was all a-twinkling with glow-worm lights There was music everywhere supplied by bands and vocal parties, with hun- dreds of pleasure- seekers on tho water Reminiscences of Byron and Mr and Mrs Browning are kept green in the memories of the Venetian people, especially the Gondoliers, and all seem to be acquainted with Shakespeare's "Othello" and "lovely Desdemona of whom they speak as if they were the hero and heroine of some recent cause celebre They will chatter over tho evil tales of Byron as if Guic cili were alive and blossoming in all the fulness of her fatal beauty. But of all the great English poets, they most cherish the name of Robert Browning Poetry and pleasure wore realised to be on the wings of the light breeze of the Canal touched by the salt of the olean-waveil Adriatic.
