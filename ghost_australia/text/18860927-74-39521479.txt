T1E PLANET NEITRB. Si;--The following extract from a recent- number of "Science Gossip " (August) may be interesting : '" The' Pldnet Neith.-Sovep times has a telescopic body been obsoerved near Venns, in such a position as to suggest that it is a satellito to thatplamet. Mr. J. C. IIouzeau; if the Brussels observatory, has collated these observations, and finds that they 'lq not accord with tho satellite theory, neither do they agree with the aupposition of an intra-mercurial plbett. Uufinds that they iuay be explained by supposing the exist p?co of a emall planet that travels in an orbit about equal to, or a little larger than that of Venus, and that it comes in con. unction with Venus at intervals, which are multiples qti a little less than three years theose between the seven observa tions corresponding to such a period tM. Ilouecan proposes the namo of Neith for this hypothetical planet." 1 am well aware of the f(ct raerred to above, namely the ~lbspyveil apj)pearances. I have been inclined to attribute them ito a g"host" in (Lio eye-piece of the telescope, g very comulstoand very deceptive incident in counoction with telescopic observation. It is produceld by the reflection of the imago of a bright star between the lenses of the eye-piece. As to the supposition of a primary planet revolving any wllgv near the orbit of Venus, it is strnugo, and altogether unaccounsalso, that it should only reveal isaelf when in proximity with tlht planet, that is, under the most un favourable circumstances for visibility. Surely such a body would, au\ongst such an army of comet spc er isud planet finders haye been taptuied n\any times:. in dilffrett parts of the sky away from the glare of the brilliant Venus. Without presuming to be an authority, I may form, and perhaps express an opinion on the subject.-Yours, etc.:: A. B. BI3qg.
