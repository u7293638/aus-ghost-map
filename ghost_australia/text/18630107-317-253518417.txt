Widely as tbe custom^ has prevailed lately of drinking tbe peroicioaa spirit, its consumption is nowhere so steadily persevered in a* at a certain dram shop in rim Quartier St. Jacques, where, from four to six o'clock every aficrnoon, no matter whether it might be wet or fine, twenty you ng men, the members of a weiety eatled Le Club des Abantheura, assemble to drink as mnch ab-inthe as their heads will carry. On entering tbe club, which Is restricted to 30, who eaase vacancies only by death -a condition, probably of frequent occurrence—each new member awean, as his co-astes havedone, never to get drank on anything• but absinthe; and this oath they strictW keep. We have heard mueh of this fatal liqueur. M. Delvau describes its t fleets in these wordsThe drunkenness caused by drinking absinthe resembles no other drunkenness Known. It is not the heavy intoiicailon of beer, the fierce madness caused by biaudy, or tbe jovial humor produced by wine. No! It takes you off your legs at tbe first glass; it fastens on your shoulder* wings of the wide* sweep, and you mil off into a country without limit or horiaon, hot at tbe same time without light or poetry. Ton think, like all ereat dreamers, that you are stretching away towards the infinite, and, like all great ruminants, you are only tending to the incoherent. Great dreaders are great explorer*, and bring back sune treasures from these excursions into tbe land of tbe ideal, but the atisinthe drinker returns from his journey into tbe Sahara laden only with imbecility, if not madness' There are 500 of these gnlfs of perdition in Paris "—AB the Year Hound.
