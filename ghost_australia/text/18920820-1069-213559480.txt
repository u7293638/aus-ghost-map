POETRY. INADEQUACY. Tho haste, llio bonded knoe, tho cry , With anger youth's ideal warm, The sad l ive iu tlio .V aster's eye That followed tlio departing formi Fino ardors quenched in caution cild, Puro druftius that never dawnod again-— A pioturo hero, to thrall nnd hold, Tho flcoting momory of men. 0 weak and molnnchoiy doom, 'To his young lioart's briuht festival To bid f.ir guests and not find room, For tho most gracious guest of all. To hn.il tlio Holy, groct tho Juot, To ask and crave, and Btill not Btny, Wistful and frank to nlmoBt trust, Yet pnsB to gilded want away ! , 0 boundlcBB misery, diainal fate ' Of mindH that Bcif but hnlf aubduo, 'J'o reach, of loftiest lifo, the gate, Aud valor lack to vonturc through : To cheat the infinito deaire, 'To halt aud faltor noar tho goal, To kill tho spirit's mounting fire, 'J'o save tho shadow, Iobc the boftl I A Blory old, yot vital now Thu vision and the voice abido, A beckoning sbape with Btar bright brow Travels our paltry lives beside : A voioo that cioar, peisistcnt, low, Softly persuades and lingeralong, BreatheB whoro the ghosts of beauty grow From color, music, marble, song; Culls in bluo morn's bird eohoing air, Murmurs amid tlio twilight pinoB, Whispers in sighing streams, and where The rosy globe of suusot ehinoB ; Spoak a from shy blooms in spring that blow. From tho still stars that beam above, From lights in conquering oyos that glow, And the strango charm of woman's love. For duty's self forgetful pain, For ata.inle.sH thougnt, for servico high, Still pleads the urgent inward strain Whilo One liko God seems gliding by. But wo, indifferent, deaf and blind, In moan, contented ways drift on — Somo moment we shall oturt, to find The voico hushed, and tho pilot gone.
