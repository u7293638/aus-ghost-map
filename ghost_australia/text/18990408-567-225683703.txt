SIB PETER'S LODGER. - By Oswald Cuviiibd. CHAPTER 1. I am said to be the fastest girl in Foxahire. It is not true. My mater Evelyn is faster. Only I don't age fast' in a bad sense. We are neither of as that, we are only go ahead.' We : can ride harder, dance longer, dress better (tailor-made for choice), play golf and most other games (except croqaet and halms) against -any ' girls in the country. We talk load, I daresay, and go in for slang, and hate accomplish ments, and loathe liter store ; in con sequence, we are very popular in the banting season. Flirt Not much. Men are snch idiots as a rale, -and.' the nice ones don't care to bother. We leave nil that to the married women. My eiater Evelyn is the eldest daughter of Sir Peter Emden. . They call him the Sporting Baronet in the newspapers. He keeps a string of race horses that eat their heads oB and ueeer win a farthing. He rides sixteen stone to honnds, and it costs . him a lot to mount himself, for he is a splendid man across country, tbongh bs is long past sixty. Evelyn is awfully pretty, mnch prettier than me. She has a splendid fignre, and is as clover as they make them. She is not a bit selfish or hard, as some people say she is — tbit is one of the lies one'e eoemies iuvent if «oe i good-looking and does things well. She is twenty-seven, and tall, and slight, and dark ; rides very st-ught, and' can cat most men dowo across our stiff conn try. She is very clever at water and doubles, bat yua should see her negotiate the big post-and-rails. -By Jove I There's nothing like it ! 1 meant not to say ' By Jove 1' in this Btoiy, or any words of that sort, but as it's down, ni let it stand for once. When I get talking about Evelyn I cau't help letting out a bir. She's snch an awful good sort I I'd hatter get it said at once — we are fearfully poor. Father never actually ran through a fortune (which I always think mast be a very lively and pleasant thing to do), because his father did it before him. Poor father is always awfully nice and generous, and we are always well-dressed and well-mounted, bat where it all comes from is more than I can sy, for £ know of nothing that we had to live upon except oar debts. Plenty of ihern ! and they are hardly ever paid. Once the batcher asked for a cheque, said, when be didn't get it, the meat supply was turned off. We lived on mattou from the estate — very lean and tough — for a month— and it got rather moDOtonous at last j roast mutton, boiled maitoo, braiBed motion, mutton broth, mutton chops au naturel , mutton cntlets A la soubae, mutton cntlete stewed with peas — for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, till, at last, father went op to town, made an assignment or ar rangement with the butcher, and we relapsed into beef and veil to "our great comfort and relief. It was at breakfast at Emden Hal! that this story begins. Evelyo and I were in one habits J there was a meet of foxhounds ten miles off Father was in pink. Three of us make the family, for both our brothers are in India, and poor mother died tea years ago, when I was twelve. That makes me twenty -two. Awfully odd. It sends a cold shudder thrnagb me to thiak of it! But I don't want to bother about myself I waut to come to our lodger. Thai's what Evelyn cbIIb him. To look at the dining-room at Emden, no one woold think we were paupers. It's a great oak-panelled, room with a groined roof that people come hundreds of miles to see, the woodwork all polished and darkmed with centuries of hard rubbing, a dais and niches in the walls at one end with figures of knigbt9 in plate armour, and rows ol portraits of ancestors bung against the wainscot. Father won't sell a piece of the old family plat", nr a bit of the armour, or the grey heirloom pictures, ritiaus and Vandykes, though our lawyer says he could break the entail and should, sod the sale woo'l pay all unr debts and set us going again for years. I am awfully glad be won't, but Evelyn says its idiotic rot and false pride. Perhaps it is, but I love him to keep up bis state, and all ab. — — — UnnailOD (DC ftPA Sfl hfi.nl tin. tile tuutQ ou irewawBv " - — - — ; — Evelyn always collars the morning paper, and, if there is anything amus ing, she reads it ont to us. This morn ing she was amused by something she read, 'Out with it, Evie,' said father, and ehe read this most absurd advertise ment ' Wanted, by young American millionaire, a home with family of pi eition io hooting couutry, stabling fof nine horses, and accomodation for grooms and valets.

Mr. Feartberrton look nocotaoexif tin objection, and went on with the nego tiations in a very bust Ilea si ike way. ' Sir Peter Emden will, -of coutbb, require Afaraniwa Tlid PrtkMiArotAnhili all a nf L.abaiti, in Yorkshire, are M'.

His bankers are Grudge and Gooley, of Walbrook, who will furnish Sir Peter Emden with full information as to Mr. Feathers too' a financial stand ing. We did not refer to the Feather- stonhaoghs, It woold have given the dhow away,' rt Evelyn eaid, ' and upset oar apple-cart ' and father, who la not a bit a man of business, said it was quite unnecessary -to trouble vGrndge and Gobley, but Evelyn did not ; agree and wrote herself. The answer same : 'Mr. Feathers ton is good for any amount.' : The only hitch was onr ages. Father thought it unly fair, after what Mr. FeatUereton bad siid in the advertise ment, to tell him that our united ages — that was the clever way Evelyo insis ted ou putting it— cune to forty-nine years, and Mr. Fea'hcrston, who seems very shrewd, at once wired back : ' Quite satisfactory, if yoongott about four and eldest forty-five, bat not if disparity less considerable ; state par. ticular?.' On which Evelyn, who is a bora diplomat, telegraphed at eocc, Sty, eldest twenty-five, youngest twenty-four, total forty-nine. As she pnt it, the 'say' saved the aUM'im, and made a fair answer to a ra'.ber impertinent. questioo. — Then came a letter : ' The situation, as stated in la-t telegram received, is fraught witb peril to Mr. Featberatun, . the nature of which "Sir Peter Emden' will at once recognise when he bacomes eogmzaut of the painful infirmity of Mr. Feathers ton, bat the difficulty can, perhaps, be overcome.' He always wrote in the third peraoo, and never made a alip in his per -one or tenses. It took the time of all three of us, and lots of rough copies, to keep up with him. CHAPTER IL ' Well, it all got made right at last, . the £1,000 chtque came by post, aud, next day, Mr. Feathers ton's horses arrived, a string of eight in their striped clothing — hoods, body cloths, and all complete, and their owner's mouogram, A F. — his uame was Arthur — -just - about opposite the near stifle joint of each borsr. Five tranters, two covert hacks, and one machioer — all looking wonderfully fit. Then the day following — it was a meet of bounds at Dredge Ha'l — be toroed op himself, a day sooner than he was expected, -in hie owu dog-cart, with the second macbtner. I like to be particular. One thing io his advertisement was certainly correct, he was 'singularly good looking ' ; only how a ' shy' man' of constitutional timidity ' con Id have the inconceivable cheek to say so much of himself, we did not find out till later. - Yes, he was awfully good-looking, tall, slight bat strong, and dark ; but all thai about his shyness was a fraad. Never in my life have I seeu so cool a band. I shouldn't think he had ever blushed siuce he was a baby, or been out of couciet with himself since he was put into shert clothes — Dot that he was exactly conceited or impudent. It wuuld have been better if he had been, there wuuld have been something to take bold of. He amply looked at every one with a helpless sort of smile, as mach as to say, You see what an absurd fix Fm in— do be nice and help meout of it!' and everybody did help him out of his bothers. I was outside, playing with the dogs, and waiting for my hack to come round, for it was josfe time to start, when he drove op alone "in his cart from the statioo. He bad on a very well cut, drab covert cost, and his hat was nil ' right. I ' saw he had his pink on nudirneath. I had meant Evelyn to do the honours, as I strongly objected to the whole thing, bat she and father bad driven, an hour before, to the meet and breakfast at Dredge Hell He pulled hie horse up at the front door ai.d looked at. me— hiB fece break ing into a conciliatory smile, . I dare say I looked rather black at first, but I could not keep "it -up against thai absurd stnilp. Seeing which, he took his hat off -and made this profonod To which I answered — not in the least knowing what I meautbut impelled by the Bmtle to say something agreeable — idiotically : Yes.' « I thought so,' be said. ' You thought what I ' 'I tbongbt yon wete tbe 'yoongest ALI8S jjmoen. ayin truro uue ina that I know" it already.' I might have been the eldest,' " Oh no, you couldn't ! ' - « Mow do .you know,? ' , Because — oh, never mind.! Please don't ask— that cqmeslstcr The mere words sound father imper tinent, bat "the smile and the time; saved tbenv and due didn't rhlod. In fact, I mustadmitat once that he wb more or less impertinent always, or. would have-been if what he said had i nht alwavs been mixed no with »c that ' Bams ingratiating smile. / Well, yon frrffrelier take'sparej X said ; 'yputmay Ibe sorry afterwards; ijsrarnyQO Aatmymtter, : Evelyis tbe oretty one.' - C,' ' No!' : ' .

Now, what was it t ' Jast tbeu we came to a little hill, and. Skylark slowing down to . about twelve miles' au bonr, I could msnage to speak. ' T-snppuse this i what -yon call ao American trotter I ' " ' She's American and a trotter, but not phenomenal. 'She's only a three- tninute-a-miler — nothing to talk about. But hiiw about what struck you 1' 'Well,' I Baid, 'it strikes me that you are nit, a a the shopkeepers say, quite up to sample ' .

Y- -n promised in it to be ' shy' aod 'constitution ally timid. Now, you. know, really, for downright coot assu rance—' Mr. Fsatherslon palled up Skylark so suddenly, that her fore lege went higher in the air than ever, her back aoiud nearly at perpendicular, and for a moment I feared she would come over upon us in the cart. ' ' H<»w perfectly and laridly'horrihle 1' be said. Why I ' I asked innocently. ' You e -n't think how it. interested ns ; we anticipated al! sorts of things from you. Yon were to be 'singularly good looking,' you know.' 1 But I don't know.' ' Intelligent I' obr _ ' Of agreeable minners !' Don't.' ' Accomplished I' 'Oh.-yw, go on j but I warn yon it's killing me ' I'm sore it's all true I siid, icily, ' bat what I don't think was quite fair of yon w-s the part about your shyness and constitutional timidity.' ' That was cot in tbe advertisement too, was itf ' Yes, that's what the advertisement said.' ' Oh I itB too bad ; what shall I do f' By this time Skylark had gat her feet on to terra Urnta again, and was going forward at her usnal stride, hut the smiU bad quite Jeft Mr Festherstan's face. He did uot speak for a bit, and was eo visibly put out that I began to be quite sorry fur him, and put io a conciliatory — Well T ' This comes of trusting professional people,'' he said. ' 1 have never seen \- tbe advertisement. Do London solici tors never understand chaff I' 'Never, I should think.' ' I told them to tell ihe plsiu truth about m -.' I eaid, 'Put in that I'm lovely and easy-going all round.' Lovely doesn't mean good-looking, you know, in America — it means amiable, aod I told him to say t loved sport and all that. ' Tell them,' I said, ' the plain truth ; unly jast add I'm timid, and not op to English ways, and can't be bothered.' 1 was in a hurry, and left them to do it all. They took notes, and they didn't see it was chaff. Good heavens ! they did nut see it was all chaff — bat you do. Oh, now, say you dor There was jast the pale ghost of the old smile coming back ou hie face, and it woo me at once. ' Of course I Bee it was chaff,' I said, with conviction. ' Thauk you, thank you 1 And then Fve mads them do snch extravagant and eccentric things since I've been in this country. I suppose they thought 1 this was another of my fancies.' . \- 'Aqd you made them put the adver tisement into all tile papers !' ' Not all — only into the two or three \- that you wnre likely to eee.' s 'That I was likely'" to -see, Mr. : Featherston f ' ; ' I mean you . and yonr father and sister, and hooting people generally But this comes later.' ' What comes, later? ' Why this. If it came now, it would spoil everything.' You pnrale me." r I life so simple.' Is it? - Yes, isn't it ?

Don't follow Captain Jjriver whatever yon do — he goes well, hut he rides as if he had no neck to break;' '. I see. Thank yon. You're a good sort. Well, here we ere.' v Mr. Featherston got down aod helped, me doifo, he threw hie covert coat on the seat of the cart and stood up in pink. I was g|ad to eee that his - boots," breeches, and coat "were all right to a point. How had he managed it 1 The hnntiag .people were, coining -.oat from the doorway of. Dredge- Court, a crowd of men, mostly in piok. Borne of them were mounted already. . All looked very critically at tite new-comer. ' There was "really nothing amies about him, nothing to . take hold bi, either the cot or his clothes Or the look of the man ; he was over six feet high, straight, and strong in the shoulders, and with a resolute- face, and 'he looked to ride about twelve Btoue, or twelve stone feeveu— just tbe mau to go, if he only knew how to ride. i 'Is 'that the d — d Yankee? l| heard some one ask. I How had they heard of himf— I wondered. Through his groom, I suppose. Then Evelyn aud father came out;- They, too, bad' heard of his coming. 1 heard Evelyo speaking to tbe men round her, as she came up:-: 'Oh, yes,' she was saying, 'a vonug American, a very good soft— gui-st of ours, for some time, probably; con nected with the Foatherstunhaughs of Leiham, spell their name differently, but pronounce it the same. Nu good across country, I fancy; probably awfol tailor ou a horse, but wants to leant. Don't chaff him, you know Bad form to chaff strangers.' She said eo, much, and talked so quickly, and then changed the subject so suddenly, that no one bad a chance of asking questions. Evie is as clever as they could make 'em, aod IhinfeB of everything. . I conld see by the men's faces that they didn't like the look of htm at all ; they woold have been better pleased, I daresay, if he had been plain, small, weak, iil- dressed, aud if his gruum and horses had had holes to be picked io them, but they didn't. His man brought up a dark grey, sixteen bauds, thorough-bred, well ribbed-up, shoulders well set back, powerful forehand, and quarters with lots uf gallop . and jump in them. 1 watched Evelyn's face. I knew she w»s taken aback by Mr. Feathcr- stpu'e appearance, hot she took care not to show it. I iutrodnced him to her and to father, and 1 saw at once that father had taken to him. Our three horses were brooght up. Shall I put you ou,' he said <o me ; but I ehirkeff it I was afraid he didn't know bow, and 1 should slide down again and he disgraced for ever, aud disgrace him too. He did not ask Evelyn, but looked at her questioniugly with a raised eve- brow -and the eternal smile. She nodded, aud be took her little booted tout in his hand, and, in a second, she was comfortably seated in her saddle. She smiled gratefully down ap#b him.and tie remained b her side from thst moment. Evelyn is certainly tbe cleverest woman I know. CHAPTER III. \- All my friends came round me and abased tbe new-comer. They mostly do abuse new-comere in hunting parte. ' Looks a hit of a duffer, doesn't he ? one of the men began. ' Well,' I said, ' it didn't strike me, but I daresay he is.' ' Can tbe beggar ride f asked another. ' Doesn't look much like going.' ' Perhaps, if yon can manage to get forward pext time, Joe, he'll have a chance to show' you.' One most stand up for one's friends, aod Joe Parker is certainly not the man who ought to bluff about goiog to hounds, but I felt nervous all the same about Mr. Feat iteration's riding. 'I say, yoo know, tbe fellow can dress if he .can't ride,' said Captain Driver,, whose own coat and hat are always a bit off colour, though I must admit he knows how to ride himself ; 'guess he's been turned ont by hie London tailor ; shouldn't wander if he's a bir uming tailor himself !' ' Daresay be is, Captain Driver ; and, look here, now, you make friends with him. He might give you a hint or two, you know.' The men laughed, .and I scored. Who is tbe fellow, after alt ? asked Lord Toobridge. ' He doesn't look -a duffer, though, perhaps,' he isone. We'll wait a bit and gee.' ' I juBt repeated what Evelyn had told them. Shegenerany knows her. way -About, find I wasn't goiog to queer her pitch this torn. . -We had a sluwisfa day all the' fore noon, pottering "about in the woodland near Dredge .Hill. Mr. Featheraton rode ty Evelyn's tide. They : seemed very well phased with each other. I felt ortf of it, I confess. There is ao use getting the. start pi Evelyn ; she's "always Grst nt tba post, pulling double. Of course, I waa ad idiot to like him jbo mneh, and to tbink he liked me. It's just my luck nil the. tiuie! ' fiWibtro disced Mr,. Fratherston to Lend Ton-, bridge," who is a great pal of hers and ; propoupnee to her, and wonld do it efegin -mprrow itahe'd Itii imjana; I no-iced that tite dud something to hie .aadJ jhelanghed. aod tfaeuLord aod talked )o me, „ She jast: does <wbt she , likes with isssisiii [?] got rather hot about it, aud I went too for— only it is too riling to hear men ragging a man behind back because he's nicer and clever and bettor, looking than they are ! Isn't it jost too mean for anything 1 They t oould abase his riding, and what a tailor in the pigskin he must be. And then I made an abject idiot Of myself. What ! not ride ? I said j yon jnst wait. I'll lay odds he cute down every une of you I' The moment I said it I was oorry I spoke. It was not till past two that -we found agood fox in Dowling Sptnuey,. outside the woodland a The Spinny lies on the slope of a bill, .aod yon can .see the open couhtiy from it, spreading away beneath yon for miles— meadow land "chiefly, lots of fences," mostly raspers, bullfinchesj and dpubles,- with tile big Dredge jf brook locking like a . bit. of "white tapa lying on tite ground -in the -valley, four miles off Across the valley aod ovm the' fulls beyond, three miles farther on, axe . Durham, woods. IPs juBt the loveliest) bite of hooting' country you ever saw, only it's made for grown-nps, not beginoere, and I did wish our guest had aoeatier line for his first try. As soon as the hounds were pot into the Spinny at one end, the fox went out like a shot from a gun at the other. The gone lies thin on the ground, with a few fir trees aod no covert to speak of, and the bonnds ran through, full" cry, and the field followed, getting .through thegoree as well as we "conld. We could see the fox— a big, dog fox, with a white tip to his brush ss broad as a Bonp plate— takjug a straight lius over tbe meadow potside, and half the pack racing him, aud tbe rest scrambling over the low etooe walls that skirts the Spinney. About two hundred of us got a fait jammed in the covert, rushing for a good start, and you heard "d s and laughing aod ehonting aud stirrup irons jangling— one mart agsinst soother's, us we crowded ou between the trees — till, at last, we alt jumped the wall aud got away, but the tail hound was already ont of eight. It was splendid over two hundred horses galloping like mad downhill, and the cheering of the huntsmen aud whips, and tbe hard breathing and snorting of tbe horses, and the thumping of hundreds of honfs on tbe turf— it was snch a row aud each a rush i It was jost magnificent — it was like that awfully exc ting row the band makes at the Palace Theatre, as the express train comes rashiog up to the footlights in that American Biograpb thins, aud the files aud drama of tbe Orchestra, aud I don't know what other inBtrumeota, go hanging and. puffing and hissing and panting, with regular brats that get quicker and loader and louder till yon can hardly bear it, and waut to shoot and yell yourself. 1 I heard Captain Driver say, ss he -cantered along beside me, ' By Jure, he's heading for the Dredge Brook and Darhtm Wuods, and we're in for a hot thing !' " I pulled my bores together and fell into Driver's wake, a length or two behind, for I thought to myself, This is going to be the biggest thing of tbe season, and they'll talk of it— and I want to see it out.' # I looked round for Mr. Featherstun's grey — hn was tbe only grey ont thst flay but I couldn't make him ont in .the ruck, and I thought it just as well perhaps, for it was awfal goiog just then, downhill, and the footing very big. Driver was taking a splendid line, going like a real workman, aod, follow iDg his lead, try. mare took her fences beautifully Presently we forged ahead of the others, aud again I ventured to take a look round for Mr. Featherstoo ; there was already -half a field between us and the rest. I could make out Evelyn end father to tbe left, nearly" level with us, and Tonbridge giving her a lead, and Shafto close up— all riding strong and hard, determined -not to be left behind in what looked like goiog to be tbe fastest rnn in the year— bot no Featherston. m The pace was getting tereifie aud tbe hotrods were running dumb now, heads ap, dropping their mosle because -of the speed they were travelling at. We raced over five or six fields, like a steeple-chase still going downhill all the time, and as we n eared the water meadows in the valley, the gruood got heavier and t&e; fencing srau »«uw. Tbe doffers had already began to tail oft We came . to a big post-and-rail with a drop Into stiff plough land be yond. H adcounted for about a dosen of the field.'. They came thundering up ; nine of them refused it, their horses half-cooked already. Three got over and -came down -on their heads foto the ploughed field on the 1 other tide. I saw poor Joa Parker, for a moment, almost standing on his hesdi,- up to the chin in the soft mould, with bis legs in the air, tobkutg, as Captain Driver afterwards said,! like a , blooming apple tree just planted ' Captain Driver looked back at mo aud laughed at. the doffere. He had polled sp Ms horse to a slow trot' to save tite. heavy land. -'Easeher -a. hit, Mite Emden,' be called to me, — ' the brookfe only three fieldB ahead and you'll want a hit left for that.' He elpwed down to a walk as his home sunk - over his fetlocks in tho foesh earth. « Anyhow the others are doing time too/ he said, encouragingly, to me as we fiohridred along tide by tide, r Tfae Dredge will fab bank high after tita whe/ltausid: . «ji?owren|etoe six good lengths law at the brook, for IriOnbt if I ton get brer this time totd t dooV waut jour vnarei qn top pi me inMro wtiiefc You're fighter. and your mount fresher, au4 I ttink yn may -jtnUMiwiigh.
