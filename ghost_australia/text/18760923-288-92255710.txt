THE MYSTEEIES OF CEIME; OB, The Expebiences of an Edutbubgh Detective. — 'No, XIII. [Published by special arrangement with the Author.] A NIGHT IN A BAKEHOUSE. ' Last night a bag of flour — a whole bag — was stolen from my bakehouse. It must have been done by some one acquainted with the place, for not a door or window ap peared to have been tampered with.' The speaker was a wizened, little old man named Skinflint, a master baker in the High-street, who had just made his com plaint, and been handed over to me to give the particulars. and excited enough, demanding my assist ance, and in the same breath making any thing but flattering remarks as to the efficiency of the police in general. ? I had neither time to. waste, nor the in clination to waste it, so I stopped him. 'Do you suspect any one — any of your men, for instance ?' ' 'That's just it,' he quickly returned. ' The robbery must have been committed by some of the men.' ' Why mustT' I dryly enquired. f ' Because this is not the first theft that I have detected, and a strange circumstance accompanied each. Two nights ago a box of raisins was . taken away, and the night i-efore that a basket of eggs, and the strange thing was that each time the thief haddeliberately gone to work and set the sponge for the afternoon bread. Nothing .was'. omitted or bungled — the work was tloaie neatly and tidily, and the place left us if nothing had occurred.' ?» 'Strange. How do you account for that?' ? ' 'I cannot account for it at all. The'men one and all denied stoutly any knowledge of the thing, and threatened to leave on the instant if I did not retract the charge. I bad to do it, too, ? curse them ! for at this season I find it* almost .impossible to .get £qod. hands. . But last night a whole bag of flour w6nt at a whip ;. it is .top much. 1 shall be ruined !

We , lean' do ; no more just now/' and I bowed ' r slightly, to intimate that the interview was . at an end, and he took the hint and left. - After he was gone, I found myself uncon- ; sciously giving the matter a good deal of .: thought. The stealing of the flour and : b^her things did not puzzle me much,consi- ... deringthehard and gripping character of ; the master, but that the thief should coolly set to work- ^and leave behind him some thing which -said plainly, ? The thief is a baker, and an expert one,' was a circum stance to which I could find no parallel in the whole range of my experience. Even . , McSweeny, when I referred the. matter to ^ him, admitted that it was 'mighty queer,' ..V but added— ^' Jist wait till the; morning : an' welL,be thick-headed ouhmadouns if we ^don't see. through it then. . When a , thafe could slip in through thie key-hole, ? andget back again wida sack of flour in ;i his p_ocket- an' no one the wiser; he'll not ^ be slow to try it again. If he tries to* ?: '- night, well be there to- help him- to carry it,' and pne of his expressive wiiiks con veyed the rest. , , r ? . 'But the. wprk-r^the. setting of the .' sponge?'' . ' :( ..;. ' ' ' ? ' j ' Och, we'll help y^ytn at that,.tpo. Bedad, , it's myself that won't lie idle while he's thumpin' at the dough j*' and~he fondled lovingly with a pair of handcuffs. - ' I don't mean that; but why should he doit?' ,. \;:; ; . .;. ' . :_/ ; ',.,,» ' To aize his mind. Sure, one good turn deserves, anorner. xr ne uoesn i xiuiih: so, we'll taciie him.' McSweeny was never without an answer — good, bad/or indifferent— so I let th« matter drop. ' : : ????i But there was more to come yet. About half-past five in the afternoon a man— evidently .a journeyman baker, and fresh from his work— made his appearance at the Office, and cautiously asked to see a detective. He was handed over to me ; and what was my surprise when he in- : formed me that he worked with a Mr, Skin flint, in the High Street, and then went , over the details of the missing property, the singular habits of the thief , and the rage of himself ^and his fellow workmen at being suspected ; and finally asked us to take the matter in hand and sift it out, without let~ ting Sldwflint hinvstff 'know anything about it. - j; TTfiVA wflSD miefir nnsi^inn in tlifl affair. First the master comes, secretly and without the knowledge of '? the workmen, and places the matter in our hands, and then the workmen, in like manner and un- . known to the master,' send and ask us to ferret out the eccentric thief. What was behind it all ? J thought I would try to - discover. . .' . . : : : The appearance of . the. man befPre ' l me was singular, but it took me some time : \ and curious study' of his face to find out , ..- ; where the singularity lay. Then. I found, that it was in his eyes. r At one moment I thought them dull' aridf stupid, and then in : a moment they looked bright and flashy — ' giving him a sort of 'raised' look. But he was sane enough — as I found out . j on questioning him: — and quite as excited -. and indignant as his master had been in the morning. Of course, that Skinflint had been there at all was a fact that for several reasons I kept carefully in the' back ground. V, 'Now, quietly, between ourselves,' I said, soundingly, after I had talked with him a little, 'who do you think is the thief?' The answer came at once, and without the slightest hesitation — ' Old Skinflint himselfc' ! He was wrong-^-I thought it-^mew it — - J but I would make sure. ' Was Skinflint ever a baker ? — I mean, has he ever ' boxed' the trade himself ?' ' No, he knows nothing about the work ; — never did — and that's why he's a tyrant.'* ' Does he not . know enough about it to J^ be able to ' set a sponge' ?'V ? - . ' Not he,' and the man smiled right out at the idea. 'Why, to do. thatyjmy or ^to know how to heat an oven, is what proves a baker. It is the. CTand test of his skill. He knows no more about, it than the cat— nat «o much, for he doesn't see itf so often.' . 'Then, if .he is the ttaef, how is it that . the sponge is always se£ for the afternoon's bread?' . .; : . The man looked puzzled— a little 8tag-: . gered — and scratched his head in vain. . '. 'Ah, that'* it. That's a funny thing,',' - he said .; but, though he himself had men tioned the fact/ he appeared quite helpless- : at a solution. ?

You have to go up a stair to it, so you will know that it is a little separate building run out from the back of the land, and having a roof of its own. Two windows in the roof are supposed to light the inside, but they are often blocked up with bags of flour; for Skinflint always buys in .a lot when it is cheap. One of the windows, though, is at present clear, and as it Las a inoveable pane, with a wire catch which could be opened as easily from the outside as the in, nothing could be easier than to get down the close into the yard behind, climb up by some of the empty barrels on to the TOof, get in your hand by the moveable pane, unfasten the lower half of the window, and jump in.' ;- ' But the getting out again ?' ????:'? *J Oh, that would be quite as easy — easier, , in fact.' 'But could a sack of flour be taken through the aperture ?' . . -?? *?' No— not in a lump.' I thought for a minute, and then said — ' This^son of Skinflint's— you said he was generous, while by your own account his -? father is almost a miser for stinginess — ?where, then, does he get the money to be generous with ?' ' Well, I don't know that he has much money — only, it's bis nature. He'd give the very coat off his back, if he thought you were cold and needed it. Any one with a plausible tale could get round him easily. But I've heard him say that, if he wanted anything, and his father held back, he wouldn't trouble to ask it again, but just lake it.' 'Ah!— indeed?' I thought I was be ginning to get at something now. ' Yes. I tcould laugh if it turned out that he had taken the flour and things — or given them away, or something. It would : serve the old beggar right. I wouldn't care what he said about us then — not though Harry took away a sack every night.' Now that the thing had been placed in our hands, I could not see very well where the laugh would come in. Robbery at any time is a serious matter, but it becomes doubly serious when a father suddenly awakens to find himself forced to prosecute his own son, and trebly serious when that son has nothing really criminal in his na ture, but is, on the contrary, 'one of the right sort,' brimming over with generosity *a& good feeling. If things went on in thU i way, j. ijcgau vu icui t-uux jl wvjuiu. suuu uuu myself engaged in a nasty job. ' How does this young man's generosity generally show itself ?' I gravely pursued , — ' in giving things away ? * ' Yes — oh, in lots of ways.' 'Have you noticed him 'generous' to. aay one in particular ?' ' Yea— to his uncle, Skinflint's brother^ but then he's a poor man, and has been long ill, and is struggling hard to keep a very large family. Fve seen Harry take out his : purse and shove it bodily into his hand. I've seen Mm smuggle six loaves out of a batch and carry them down to the uncle's shop himself.' ' You say * smuggle.' Am I to under atand that the loaves were stolen ?' The man opened his eyes and stared. The idea seemed new to him. f 'I mean, did Skinflint know of it ?' I . pursued. ' Not he. He'd see them drop dead at liis feet before he'd part with a farthing to . save them : and yet he owes all he has to them ; for the shop and business were all theirs once. He wormed them out of it somehow, and luck has gone against them * ?ver since.' ' Where is this uncle's place ?' 'In the Cowgate. It's a little shop, a kind of provision store, with the house at the back: but he doesn't seem to get on well, for there's precious little in it.' ' I suppose he sells all sorts of things — flour, and eggs, and raisins, for instance — ?anything to turn an honest penny ?' ' Just so : all these sort of things.' ^ I mentally resolved that if nothing turned tip I would pay a visit to this little pro-, \- vision shop next morning, and have a look at the stock of flour, invoices for the same, -' Sec. Yet I innst say that I sincerely hoped' I would find myself on the wrong track. - ' Thecircumstances of the case were peculiar; and my sympathies were now strongly in favor of the suspected parties, even though; they should be guilty. ' Some such thought ran throughmy mind : but I pursued the inquiry no further. I took down the man's name — John Hastie — bade him good night, promising to do all in mv power for him and his mates, and slfortly after, in company with McSweeny, took a walk down to Mr. Skinflint's bake house. We found him waiting for us, ^ and amusing himself in the meantime by killing . il clocks,' or cockroaches, which, he patheti cally lamented to us, ' ate up half of the profits of his establishment.' He showed us over the place, flour house and all ; and then, after drawing out of him a few move facts respecting his brother, we arranged to return at ten o ciock ana auow ourselves to be locked up in the place for the night. I may here say that had it been an ordi nary case of theft or robbery, especially with such a. man for the complainer. I A: -would not have taken so much pains with it. But now my curiosity was strongly ex cited, and I had resolved to watch not one *? night only, but two, three, or a dozen if . aeeessary.* I had noted many an instancs 'ofinirgTara or' thieves doing irorTTaftiF tjg their vocation, butjt was generally rkMhjLt Ijtenej&tted; ^ems9tres, such' as unfn^ champagne* Cigars, «-ast fowl, &c;, when they found them handy; but here was a case quite the reverse. The ?ithief, by-workings not only gained nothing, ind^nagngdred his own *s&fety; for the time,J)ut left ,a clu£ .. ip his identity; as ^*$k -'' —?''?' ' , ' ''- ;? '? After arranging our plans, McSweeny and I got to the place at 10 o'clock, and were received by Skinflint, whose consent to pntrlittle item we now proceeded to aak. Pointing to a* solitary bag off -flour in one corner of the flour-house, to which we had invited the proprietor, McSweeny soiuid ingly began— ? ! ' Isn't that the sister of the one that was stolen F' ' Yes-f-it is the only one of the lot left — ? the finest American flour ; by far the most valuable in the place.' . ; **i)'ye think, now,' and McSweeny put on ' his softest wheedle— 'd'ye think, now, ye coidd take out as much flour as would let in my .own swate self.' ? r- '. Skinflint started and stared. ' What do you mean to do ?-' he -angrily demanded. :. 'Only to make myself *the most valu able in the place.' Sure, I won't be the first American flour that's' come from Bel fast county.' 'I can't allow it: it would spoil the flour.' ' Divil a bit. Ye can bake it up into chape loaves for the poor ; it'll look mighty charitable, an' at the same time be a great benefit to yourself. Men of genius like you always ldll two birds with the one stone,' and McSweeny !s look of great sim plicity and reverence completely deceived the man before him. Skinflint still demurred. 'Sure it's meself that runs the most risk,' pursued McSweeny. 'P'raps the vagabones 'ill steal me an' bake me up into bread, then I'll find me head sticHn' out of a loaf, burnt black like a wanderiu' cur rant.' ; Still it took some talking from us both to convince Skinflint. It was a little amus ing to watch the struggle between his ava rice and his eager. desire to capture the rob bers ; but at last he consented. The mouth of the sack was undone, and about a third of the flour scooped out and stowed awav in a bin. Then McSweeny stood up on an empty cask, and worked his feet down in the flour till he reached the bottom, a draw ing-string having first been run into the mouth of the sack and the ends placed in his hands, so that at any moment he coidd duck down his head into the flour, pull the string, and look to all appearance like an innocent bag of flours ' Bedad ! it's soft, anyhow. Aitchoo ! a — a — tchooT he sneezed*; ' it's as good as an ounce of snuff ; but it'll take a mighty lot of brushin' to make me presintable at the muster call in the mornin'.' I arranged to hide in an empty flom* cask close at hand, with an empty sack to draw over as a cover ; and then Skinflint put out the lights and retired, locking us securely in. It was a clear, frosty night, and by-and-by the bright moonlight stole in at the window of the flour-house, giving the long row of flour bagsratheraghostly appearance. It was lonesome, but quite comfortable and warm, owing to the heat of the bakehouse and oven below. 'I begin to think it's hell!' whispered McSweeny, ' an' them's the white ghosts of the twelve pirates I read about once that got hanged. I could fancy I see their heads noddin' at me. The divil! what's that? Something crawlin' over my face ; it gave It'snibblin' at me neck now— 7110, that's not it — it's another. There's a lot of them. Down, ye divils ! They're comin'on me in whole regiments. Bedad! this beats the bugs. They — oh, ss — s — s ! they think Tni flour, an' they're atin' me !' ?'They're only cockroaches,' I said; ' keep still and they won't hurt you, and for any sake don't speak so loud.' ' That's aizy said ; if you only felt them nippin'. Who'd have thought there was such a lot of them ? I wonder where they were all hidin' afore the light went out ?' 'Fool!' ' Yes, I am ; but it's not with atin'. The atiu's all on the other side. But I've £?ot as much as I want. Two hours' nibblin' -should satisfy any man. Bad luck to them, I didn't know it was them that were ticklin' me. Why doesn't owld Skinflint keep his bakehouse clane. It isn't safe. He'll be inakin' currant bread when he doesn't want to.' 'Be quiet, can't you! They're in all bakehouses.' ' That's comfortin'.' 'Hush! I hear a noise at the back. There's some one among the empty barrels in the yard. Do you hear ? They're get ting up on the roof. Hush !' and I crouched down in the cask and drew forward the sack; leaving only a slight opening through which I could watch the window above me. , . There was a clambering sound along the slates towards the window, and then a man's face came slowly into view. It was clearly distinguishable in the moonlight, and I uttered a startled cry as I recognised John Hastie, the journeyman baker. ' You told me to he quiet,' growled McSweeny from inside the flour bag, into which he had ducked and -drawn the string-, 'but 'it's yourself that's doiu the talkin' now. Wliaf s up ?' ' A man. and he's coming down.' The nioveable pane iu the window wa« opened from without and the man's head tlirrst iu, and then the fastening was un done and the window let back. Then, very coolly and methodically, the man dropped down before us. taking not the slightest notice of McSweeny *s floury head and face and gaping mouth, which liad popped out of the bag close to his elbow. In the occasional glimpses I got of tlie intruders face I thought it looked a trifle paler than when I had seen it up at the Office in the afternoon, but I was scarcely prepared for the discovery that followed. He walked forward without auy of the shirking hesitancy of guilt, straight to the -ras bracket, struck a match and lighted it. Not a moment too soon, as he thought, McSweeny popped in his head and drew the string of the bag. But he might have saved himself the trouble. A peculiarity about the man'* eye* — a strange glassy fixedn^w— caught my eya, amf at once tbTe trut£ flashed. upon'ineT Theman was^t,aa|OT^^;£;v» '-'' .^ wbjgpr to McSwe^y, but 4ie1 shrank aricP iij-©n |^e somnambulist, tiU his;head^ liwl ^'Sim£ he!s more like adeadl ghost walk ^','|i^%hispered,in ret^^witiha«slight chatter in his teeth. 'I don't like the look of Minat all. Luk at him now. ''What tlie diy!& iiefgoin' to do with the floiirf 5 ' ^- - T-he man had stripped off coat and waist coat and turned up rus sleeves, and *ras ap proaching the head of the bakehouse stair bearing in hi». hand a large scoop full of flour, when an idea seemed to strikeTiim, And he turned .back. '- McSweeny, fearing he was coming to Ms-bag, made an excited spring out of it; but he. had nothing to fear — the man only lowered the ga^ and then descended to the bakehouse, with us f ollow- ing^on tiptoe at his heels. Then ' we were witnesses to a strange scene, - . - - - ? - ''- Hasiie yery* deliberately lit the gas, walked straight to one of the dough bins, and mixed the 'flour he carried with a quan tity already there. Then he took a pan of hot water out of the oven and worked away with it a long time, cooling it by adding cold water, and testing it every time with a thermometer till he got it to his liking, when he poured it into the bin, and began working away among the pasty mass with his hands. This done, he scraped his handa clean, dried them with some flour, scat tered some flour over the dough, scraped down the sides of the bin, and covered over the whole with a cloth and board. ' Well, that's done,' fee said, speaking for the first time, with a sigh of satisfaction, and taking no notice of us as we peeped out at the foot of the stair ; and then from a hole in the wall he took out a tobacco pipe, and settled himself to a comfortable smoke. 'Sure, it's meself that could help him this minute,' muttered McSweeny, with an en vioualook. 'It's a fine time of it ye have over there, never so much a»axinf a body to take a draw.' But the man smoked on, meditatively and quietly, and then resumed his vest and coat. ' He's goin' to pocket a bag of flour now,' said McSweeny, as we slipped hastily up to the flour room. But he was wrong. Putting out the lights as he went, the man ascended the stair, got up on the flour bags, pulled himself up through the win dow, closed it as he had: entered, and was gone. 'What a big chate of the world; I thought he was the thafe,' grumbled McSweeny, as the sounds died away. 'So did I at first; but he's not.' 'P'raps the real thafe i» to come yet,' was the quick-witted suggestion. ' Surely we're not to have so much trouble an' bitiu' for nothn'.' I thought the idea a good one, and once more we ensconced ourselves in our hiding places. But it was well on for three o'clock before we were again disturbed, and this time the sounds came from the bakehouse door. We distinctly heard a key inserted and the door opened, and then two persons —men — entered, conversing in subdued wlrspers. They did not strike a light, but came softly up the stair to the flour-house,, and. I could have touched them both with my hand as they passed on towards- Mc Sweeny 's bag. One of them — the younger of the two — turned, and without a word pointed to the bag containing McSweeny, and as he did so the moonlight struck full on his face, and I saw distinctly the fea tures of a rather good-looking young man. The other obeyed in silence, and at once seized the bag and endeavored, with a lift f rom the other, to get it on his hack. The position must have been anything but an agreeable one to McSweeny, but he bore it unflinchingly. As ill luck would .have it, however, the tity of flour was drawn in with his breath, ' and he emitted a sudden and energetic double sneeze. The effect was instantaneous. He was dropped with a yell, which the thump he received caused him to echo, and then loosening the string, he sprung out before them like a frightful white apparition. I made a grasp at one as they whisked past me like swift shadows ; but I was only drawn forward, cask and all, on my face, and then lay sprawling while they were flying like the wind. . At the same moment McSweeny made a dash forward, tumbled over me,; grappled with me, and tugged me up by the hair of ?the head. ' So I've got ye, ye vagabond !' he cried, giving me a thump in the ribs before I could find my voice. ' Ye let me fall on pur pose in the sack, did ye ? to try an' break the small of me back, an' then lay down there that I might break me neck, there, there, and there !' * He was thumping me with a vengeuce, but I could do nothing but laugh, which I did till I was powerless. Then lie pulled me up into the strip of moonshine, and peered into my face. 'Och, bedad, and it's you!' lie cried, with a whistle of dismay. ' Why did ye chate me? — an' we've let them off aftar all F 'I'm afraid we have; but I think 111 know one of them again,' and I whispered a moment in his ear. ' Ye don't mane it ?' he cried, excitedly. ' But I do ; it's a fact,' I returned, aud then we went down, aud up to the bake house door, and found, as I had expected, that the flying thieves had taken time to lock it after them. But we had no fear of them returning, so we both got out by the window of the flour- house, fastened it behind us, and went home to bed. Next day I called on Skinflint, and inci dentally enquired for his son. He told me that the young man had been taken unex pectedly ill that morning after leaving the house to open the bakehouse, aud had re turned, when he had to get up and go in. his stead, and was not a little surprised to find us gone. I gave him a full account of the night's proceedings: but as it was given without any private comments or suspi cions, he did not make much of it, but at once began to tell me of a strange occur rence of that day. This was neither more nor less than the receipt of a note, stating that he woidd find the stolen property — to wit, one bag of flour, one box of raisins, and a quantity of eggs— safely deposited in his yard, to which place the thief had had them conveyed before writing the note. A pcatcript stated that he, the thief, had baaa ^orce^.JE67maJke the Fe§Htu|S.on by^a remgtic isj^m^^^rtif^^mvihlllh.' g)tee i»@l me to ^lxJther K- further in the matter.

If he should read! this- he will see that detectives are not quite* €0- badi as thiey are sometimes painted. . ?? ; ? As for Hastie, the sonmambufist, when told of his part in the adventure-,.he appeared overwhelmed with confusibh,*and took the first opportunity to slip on his coat and walk out of the bakehouse. He nevefcame bank, and was only heard of by chance months after as having been seen in a far distant town.
