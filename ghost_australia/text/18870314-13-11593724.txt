THE VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MARCH MEETING. A bright day at Caulfield on Saturday brought a large attendance to see the last day's autumn racing, under the auspices of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club. And a visit to Caulfield on Saturday was pleasant, apart from any attractions which the racing might present. The grass in the reserves has thickened into a beautiful carpet, and the trees and flower buds were equally attractive. It is a peculiarity of the couch-grass that it prospers better through the summer heat than the winter cold, and this merit should recommend it to the rangers of Australian racecourses. What with agreeable surround- ings, good catering at moderate prices, and a variety of sport it was through no fault of Mr. Bond, or the V.A.T.C. executive, if visitors failed to enjoy themselves. At half past 1, a convenient hour for start mg, eight horses went out for tho Selling 1 ace Hie Ghost was once more cn trusted with his owner's conlidenee and a very large Bhare of public money, his starting priée being even money And with 7st 21b to carry it seemed a safo speculation to back him Mttroney, with the same weight, was at odds of 7 to 2, and Sorcerer also had some support from his stable connections 1 rom a struggling start the favourite remained in the centre of the held down to Hie bend, where ho apparently hud little chance of winning In tho run «own tho straight he camn ulong the rails and improved his position slightly, but Power »as no more Bucccsslul than Williams and other jockeys in getting tho owkward clieitiuit home a winner, and Mnroney, without being troubled, won easily, with the other bucked horsoB filling the places .Ihe Ghost has been a good horse to the rinK and if any animal is entitled to have Ins picture hung on tho walls of the Victorian Club it íb surely this inconsistent son of Ilninlct When Mnroney waa put up for nuction one other racing man beside his owner wished to get lum Ile was knocked donn at J.75, hut the owner claimed'lum at iîO and contended that no other bid was innde. Aa a consequence of the dispute he «its put up again mid Mr Rennison got lum luck for £80, the whole of Which sum went to the funds of the club There were seven saddled tor the Hurdle Haee, the angular Goodwood, who has shown to such advuntnge ot late over all kinds of fences being favourite at odds of 5 to 2 against him, while 1 to 1 could be bud against either i ouls or Revenge.
