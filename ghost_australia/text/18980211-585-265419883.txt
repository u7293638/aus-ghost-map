While In a bilh (a Pitt-straet, * Mr Jarvil had thg mitfortune to slip and fill CD the hot water pipes, and before ha could be rescued he wss scalded and burnt in a terrible Way. The (hock of the burning and tha fall proved to ba very diaastrons for Mr Jama, and (or a number •1 y*ars alter be wat a confirmed invalid tuBeriug terribly (ram locomotor ataxia aqd ether form! of paralysis. A (aw months •50, however, reports began to be circa* llted ih the neighbourhood that Mr Jarvis Wtt ((ettiog round again, and that be had had I moat mervelloua recovery from this tppifehtly incurable malady. It was on account 01 these ruicora that a special itpatter thai the Sydney Worker was dei* pstclicd to get ail information regarding •arc* aod one af ternoon made his way to bit hens*,4$ Crown-lane Ultimo. Mr Tho*. J»r*ls ifii discovered Darting twcyear-old-baby, and bis (aca dsolares him to be one of the happiest men in Sydney. He was up and about, and able (0 answer the knock at the door. Although pale and bearing (till a (aw marks of a critical illness and a period ot pain, it was very clear that be ires an invalid no nor*. In reply to the preliminary questions he «sid:—"You want to know all about my «ut? Wall, I am glad of an opportunity to tell yon. The fact* may be of value to those stricken aa I was." "How long were you suffering?" "Well twelve months ago I got no bad that I had to leave off work, and 1 have done nothing ainoe then. About five yeara ago next Christmas I mat with an aooident; I was badly scalded while taking • bath In Pitt-street, 8ydney. Since the •ooident X have been in failing health, aud after lour years ol gradual developsneot of malady, I was foreed to give op Biy billet at Glebe Island." "What ware your stmptoms!" "Simply indescribable. Th* pains want terrible. They were just abent aa much as I coald bear. They were for all the world like aa if a new was cutting my bona* i& two in every part of me. 1 had so canrol over my bowels or bladder, and wae a nuisance to mytell and ereryons else. I waa incessantly shivering and shaking, and coald neither eat nor elaep. On the 2grd March last I saw a well-known doctor, and ho told me that my ease was utterly hope, leas. However, he gave me an order to the Director of Charitable Institutions." "Did van make use of the order?" "No; 1 came home and went to bed, aid bars b**n pretty Wall in.bed.avw since. Five weeks ago! could not get oat of bed. I felt then that It was all over with me, and crnly a question of days whan 1 would pve sp the ghost. Uy doctor was attend* }ng me, add did %U he oould, by opium and morphia pills, to eass the agony I waa iu. I was under him for five or ail weeks. II* came to the concla<is& that I was (uttering from locomotor ataxia, or progressive locomotor ataxy, a diseaee of the spinal chord, characterised by peculiar disturbances of gait, and difficulty in coordinating voluntary movements. He told me I might last for ten years, and that I might never get t^e Me of mv I'ga. (Just then the patleat kicked hit lege to ehow that medical ouinion is not infallible.) Well, just as • drowning man will grasp at a straw, I grasped an idea cmveyad by the advertisement deacrlbing the our* of another boiler-maker in England, whioh I read io the Australian Work, man by Dr. Williams" Pink Pilla for Pale People. I read in the advertisement of a use which aeemed to fit my own, I determined to give tbe pilla a trial anyway, and **nt for a box, The effect wag at marvellous aa it waa magieal. I was able to « i and deep aa though nothing waa the matter with m«, It was the fint appetite and mt I had (Or many a day. It waa incredible. I immediately left my bed and waa able to move a boot, Yon sts ttose crntchai there? Tbay are per. fectly tisw, and I have sever «uwd them. They were made for me before I rot Dr Williams 1 Pink Pills, but I wae too weak to nee them, and now I don't want them." "He is 100 per ceot better," said Mr* Jarrle, who had aome lo and taken tha baby on her kneaa. "Tha Dr Williams' Pink Pilla for Pale People hare aaved hie life and made another man of him." A friend who called ID at this point aatd that Jarvia looked tan year younger that day than be did a fortnight pntioni. i can now continued Jarvia, "bavf a cold bath, and all tha feeling hu coma back into my lege. 1 ascribe all the change and benefit to Dr Willsms' Pink Fills forPale People. They have aaved my life I am in no pain now, whatever, and (eel lilw a sew man.
