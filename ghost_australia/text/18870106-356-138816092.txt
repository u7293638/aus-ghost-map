Sooth I scarcely know, For but now bshe ran, As she used to go, Tripping, hiding-sea.! With her winsome face Half-way turned from me. Dear and dainty grace I S Though, alas' she may Never pause or speak While TI lean and pray. Tender wile and freak Each a'fresh surprise Iow of old they shone In her laughing eyes! Oh, my sweet, my own, If you could but stay I Pale as drifted snow I Faint as winds in May I TI would shield you so, Clasp you warm and safe, Nevermore to be Wand rer.or waif I Rapt in reverie, Softly Irepeat Neither threat nor beast Sad the thought and sweet. Like a little ghost She is flitting evermore Through the hallway dim, Past my open door!
