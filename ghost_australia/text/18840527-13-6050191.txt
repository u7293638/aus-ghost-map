BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL The trial match arranged by the Anglo-Australian Football Association duly came off on Saturday on the Richmond cricket ground, when a very good game ensued the blues eventually winning by five goals to two. Up to half time the game was very even the reds having rather the best of it and the only goal scored so far was one by Spence for them. The blues kicked a goal immediately after the whistle had sounded for half time which was not of course allowed. The next goal was bullied through by the blues and then Ware and Excell in succession scored for them. The next point was gained by Almond for the reds but it was not allowed on the score of off side. Howard and Sorby then scored one goal each for the blues and just before, the call of time A. Scott headed a goal for the reds from a corner. During the last half of the game the blues had decidedly the best of it appearing to stay better than their opponents. Fore the reds, Almond, Nicholson Tunnicliffe and Spence played best, and on the other side Ware and M Lara esi cclally distinguished themselves and othors dosorvlng mention aro Excol], Sorbj jiud Howard Tho sides wore as follows -Blue-Keeto fgoal) Scott and M Laren (baoks) Law and Robins (half hacks), Waro and Excel 1 (right forwards) Sort y (caulaln) and Liddell (loft forwards) A A.
