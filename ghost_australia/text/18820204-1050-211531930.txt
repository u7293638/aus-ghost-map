THE CHRONICLE ' "OF - ' RUTH' WYNGATE-' A TALK OF . OLD AND NEW/ENGLAND.! By Annie Lucas.1 CHAPTER X L V I I. HEAPING IN JOY. ' Mark returned from Boston, and told .us how Margery's' brave, tender heart had kept up toithe.last ;.how. he had seen her stand on the. deck .of the good ship which was;to, bear her back, to Old England, with; her hands clasped ..upon her husband's arm, and the light , of love and. hope illumining. her-, fair, faded, face. . So,: with , a, favouring breeze in its sunlit.sails, the .vessel. had:borne her from his sight. ..The vessel was called , the "Phoenix," and she bade us, Mark said, take that name as an omen.: Prom, the ashes of the: dead, sorrow ful past, a. new life was about to spring for. herand for Digby ; a/life, in which we and he . and , she -would be , linked together still, though the > ocean, rolled between us. For God. would bo its. aim and end. And sorely as we , missed ..the dear, sweet, sorrowful face' and 'quiet, gentle presence from our- midst,. we dared not account that a sorrow which God had sent as a .blessing. . And at the season which had been so sad the previous year, when . Margery had kept . her sad and solitary watch by the new-made grave ,in.;which her. last eartlily. joy had been buried ,out; of her : sight, letters reached "us from the far-off,. familiar shores of Old Eng land,, whicluwere, indeed, as cold waters to thirsty ' hearts :.. for ; Margery's were full of trustf ul ; love; and . chastened; happiness," and reviving hope ; and Digby's were earnest and manly,: betokening a growing., confidence in the God lie- was learning to know and love, and a steadfast 'purpose to walk. in liis ways. Of Margery, ho spoke with deep and reverent tenderness,- .yet in few. words. Expression failed him, he said, of ..what; lie j possessed in her..;:. After', the. receipt of these , -letters, we could, more, fully. rejoice that the life .which with, us must ever have remained maimed and blighted, was .finding its full development in the lot to which the mysterious, indissoluble tie ..which God has decreed to . supersede all others had linked it; , ... ! , /..Then. our. quiet life ..flowed on peacefully, restfully', unbroken save by a new blessing sent us Jin early spring in. the, birth of Mark and, : Maude's ; first-born son. In, > peace and prosperity we. dwelt, surrounded with those dearest , to us, and with the blessing of God UpOn iUS. , , In the early summerof :the, following year tidings .again , reached , 'us ; . tidings that made our .hearts leap.

Thenceforth he lived amongst us as one upon the eve of a long: ancl painful journey. >; With the autumn came an attack of ague ; with the winter, feebleness and failure ; with: the spring, the breaking of the earthly fetters. With his children and children's children- around- His bed, our beloved and venerated father, passed peacefully ,- away, in : assured - faith and hope, leaving 'stamped upon our hearts the example: of a holy and consistent: life, the- memory of a most .tranquil .death, and a reverent an'd'!tender-'remetnbrance<of lai father who had so well merited his children's flfEGction n.n/1 vnnnfiri.! . ; / i..'M ; : A few months- more; -and ; Aunt Deborah's, place; was vacant too.
