Xotwitlnttiuuiiujr tho countor-r.ttractiou of thnj'iDipiuj,' contents in conuection with the Agricultural Show there was a capita! at tendance at the Spring Meeting of the Port A-Maide Racing Club. With tho elements always as favourable as they woro on Satur day Cheltonham Park would bo c. popular resort, as the course and its hurrbuudings aro eminently suited for tho holding of race meet ing.*. It is easy of access, and when tho lawn in the Grand Stand enclosure is perfected tho c!ub may expect tho fair sex to patronise their fixtures in equally a& laree minilxrs as they do those held at Morpbctt viiie and the Old Courbo. The cominittec are evidently Ions upon making their course as attractive as possible, and as funds permit thev add improvements. In their latest expenditure they havo studied t!ie wants of these particularly interested in tho hones by the erection of substantial scraping sheds in the saddling paddock. They havo also provided a temporary casualty hospital. Thcro were ievera.1 nicinbisrt of thcLeguliiturc present on Saturday. Tho Premier, tho Hon. C. C. Kingston, was there for the first time, and he lunched with tho committee. The amount that passed through the totalizator was £5,053 10«., which wait just £100 short of tho sum invested at the Spring .Meeting last year. Tbo macliiuo was under the manage ment of Mr. White, assisted by Mr.. Longson. During the afternoon the City Volunteer Band discoursed a programme of music. The racing was n-ited for several surprises which cropped tip, tho consequent result noing that sorao linaltuy dividuiuls were recorded. The biggest was paid over the first event, the Trial Stakes, in which backers of Longbow received £21 IDs. in return for their sovereign. Tho Idler was served up very warm, bnt he just failed to catch Bridal Morn anda Long) io\v, and had to he content with third phse. Tho half-sister to Tradition led Longbow into tho straight, but after an interesting sot-to Pattersons gelding woro her down, and Itrat her by half a length, while the favourito misled second honours by a neck. The Rector made his roappoAranco, but ho was not fancied by his party, and ran nowhere. The absence* of Conscript in the Hurdle Hacc did not occasion surprise, as it wA3 reported on the previous day that ho wm to ba reserved for the S ring Handicap. With him out cf tho road Rosodale, who was making her debut over tho small sticks iu public, was cntrnstud with the most money. S!ic had acquitted her self creditably over tbo schooling hurdles, and Mr. Mallon was pretty coniidont sho would score in this company. Hi* confidence in her was not misplaced. as eho won pretty comfortably from Snowdrift after Holmes had ridden her very vigorously lietwoen tho fivo and tiiree furlong posts to get on terms with the leaders. Home Knlc was going well until ho jumped over the rail into the course itiSCuu^ of negotiating the hurdle after rounding tho Stand turn. Another maiden performer was Happy Jack, and lie was conspicuous for a time, but ho tired away to nothing, and ho evidently requires n little more time at thogame. Fifteen outofthftsixtcen coloured oh the card in tho Flying H&ndirap; passed tho stales, and My Novel was voted the pick of tho bunch, she carrying double ad much in tho machine as Di&dcm;, who w'a.'t tho nest in demand. She and Helena, howevirr, were br.dlv placed at the start, which militated considerably Against her chancu c: kuccoks. Electric, on tho other hand, pimped olT the mark first, and never again S«mg h«uled won easily by a couple of Iciujth*. paying u. dividend of £11 3s. Electric is the linrso which cuuld not gut a place in the Trial Stakes at Jvapnnda tho pre vious week, hut Inter on won tho Flying Handicap, his two performances calling for an enquiry by tho Stewards which has not yet been decided. On Saturday ho put npa7-U-. pnalfy. The same farco xtas f nafctcd in connection with the Steeplechase hh took pUcn in the Kapurtda Steeplccha*?. Eclipse was z divided favourito, and being only one of two to go tho courao corrtcUy he won by over a furlong. Young Lucifer coming to grit.*? i»t tho last jump when on torihs with tho winner. Pwtal and The Ghost declined tho first obstacle, whilo later on Repetition baulked and SStriko ran off. Woodnold did not ta&ke; a tuiHtako, hut be was so slow that he only just heat Young Lucifer for second place aftor tho latter had been remounted. Trout found most favour for the Spriucj Handicap, but he was never dangerous, tho places Using filled by tho three outaidcrsof the party, thoactual winner being supplied in My^ Novel. Tho success of Carlton'fl sister occasioned an much Etirprifto M tho failure of tho favourite, Motnpa, and Conscript, as it was thought she would find the mile a bit too far for her. Tii r.pito of his mitsinft the Trial Stakes, tho Idler wan agnin Ffllccted m favouritafor tho Tntuli/ntor Handi cap, but he was seen to lew advantage than he was earlier in tho afternoon. Tho race pro vided the most exciting Hnirh uf tho day, Bridal Mcir.i. who battled on moro gainoiy than she did in hor first encouutcr, dofcating the well-supported Dblihlnon by a nose.
