'Ono bird in the hond'a worth two in the bush,' said she, with a smile ; 'and' now that there is a chance of some £riud,' I cm go about my usual oooupations.' CHAPTER II Fanny did not, like modern heroines, retire to hrr own apartment. She shared her, mother's brdrnom, and tlioie sho could not reckon iin being alone for half an hour. What could she do? She deter mined to escape from home for a li'tlo while, and go and pray and weep ut her much-loved father's grave. She soon b-*f(an to repent of tha proiniso she had given lior m ither. 1 For,' thouttht she, ' even if Mr. Sokes proved inexorable, and put in u broker, ho would only dan take the value of the quarter's rent ; and I'm sure in the sitting room alone t hero's enough for that. True, after suoli a disgrace, wo oould not remain in his liouso. Out would not tlmt lie fur bettor than that I should break my heart by giving up dear Prod Benson, and, perhaps, his life into the bargain ?' And Fanny determined under no air. cumstancos to oocept Mr. Stokes. But then, if tha shook of the cruel landlord's proceeding to extremities shonld drive hor mother to desperation, — perhaps to KUioide? Mrs. OobIoW bud often said she the good lady was very much afraid of death, and very impatient of pain, this was only an idle threat ; but it filled poor Fanny with anguishing fear. What if, owing to her refusing StokeB, her mother were to throw herself into the river ? She would then be her mother's murderess J and Funny wept bitterly. She had turned into ihe latio that led to the churchyard, when she oaught sight of Mr. Aubrey, tbo village parson. She could not avoid him and soon he came up and spoke to her kindly, and elicited the cause of her grief. How sincerely did the good man regret that it was not in bis power to offer substantial help. .He tried all he oould to comfort poor Fanny, and promised that any influence be possosned should be used to iriduoe Mr. Stokoa to be lenient. - After le»vinp, Funny visited one of his parishioners in the village, and on leaving the cottage whom 'should she meet but Mr -Stokes himself. ,. ' ' Quarter-day, the source of such grief and terror to many, was a pleasant pros pect for Mr, S'okes. He had a good deal of property in small tenements, so a sum of money was coming in the shape of the quarterly rent, and where that was not ready, even more than the equivalent would be bis in the seizure of goods, to which he always had resource without delay. So Mr. btpkee looked particu larly happy as quarler-duy drow nigh. | [ Another sou-ce of satisfaction was ; hi*, probable union with Funny, whose beauty had inspired him with as muoh love as, his'' sordid nature was onpible of feeling.. ( ^ Mr. Stokes, though a very, hard man, aimed at being considered a highly ? res peotable one He was rather proud of1 the'aoqu'aintanceof the' clergy rnanj (if 'the' p.lace, and when Mr. Aubrpy greeted. . him. oordially, and invi-ed him |.o.tea, his good; spirits roao to1 positive hilarity..-, ?

While praj ing ear neatly, she remained uucon-cinus of the approaohing storm ; and. whoa the rain'1 began to fall hoavlly, her flrat thoughts were for her poor mother — the buy bar-* ve»t I : i .. Alas ! alas I a few hours of such poltinj; rain, and Mrs Onslow'a bay would be unsaleable. Funny's garments were nearly drenched; but she was too much ugit&ted; to otidure the prospect of an immediate return to liar mother's roof. Su she took shelter in the church porch, and there gave full vent to hor grief. , ' Fred, dear Fro-],' oxclaimtd she, ' I must resign you for ever I It Beems to be honven'a deureo ; and if to savo my mother I marry 'mother, then I shall dread your return as tnuch us I have hithorto longod for it.' This thought was so torturing to poor Finny, that she w(is positively oonvuhed witli grief. Tho day had been one of most painful excitement. She was oom pletely overwrought. There wasa reac tion, Fanny bad sunk down, half ex hausted, on iho worm-eaten bonch benoath tho north. In tlio contemplation of bqr soon some relief was afforded' by a 'kind of uncohaciousness that savoured moro of stupor than healthy sleep. Yet even in this slumber the image of her lover was atill present to her imagination ; and when, the rain, penetrating through some ore-, vices of the ancient porch, roused her from her state of somi-inseusibility, she awoke, uttering Fred's name. She shuddered as she become gradually aware of her actual position. In the re gions of the debd, sho was the only living creature. ' And while ghosts are flitting around me,' thought she,.' the atorin is bursting, over/my head ; and my poor mother—' h -w frightened atje -roust be at' my pro longed absenoo!
