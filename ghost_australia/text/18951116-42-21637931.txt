Religious. Boundless Salvation. SERMON BY GENERAL BOOTH. Delivered in the Brisbane Opera House, 4th November, 1895. Rev. xx. 11, "And I saw a great white throne." Many people go round the world to look for sights, inquiring for something new. There never was a time when men gave bo much of their money, and risked so much, and travelled so far, and devoted . so much "of their time to seeing sights, as they do at the present day. Going round the world sight seeing is quite a common thing ; and when they have gone all round they look for something else. Well, here is something people want to see — something new, striking, inte resting, and sensational, " And I saw a great white throne." I'm Borry to say that this is the last thing some of those globe trotters want to see. They would compass the ocean and go to the stars if it were within their ability so to do for what they can see ; but they are not Immediately anxious about this; yet what sight can compare with it —" And I saw a great white throne." Then follows a description, briefly given, but strikingly portrayed, of the great Judgment Day. There Is I believe but little difference of opinion among the larger part of this audience that there is going to be a Judment day. The question may be asked, what I mean by a judgment day ? I reply that there Is going to be a period in the world's history—before this world is done—when God will inquire into the character and conduct of all who have walked on its surface ; when He will dis cover and reward the righteous, and dis cover and convict and condemn and punish those who would live in rebellion against Him. I say there is going to be a judgment day. Some people don't like the idea. One reason is they can not understand it, and they reject It be cause there are mysteries about it; and some people don't like it because they're afraid it will condemn them. They fear they'll fare very badly ; wicked men and wicked women don't like the idea of being pulled up and convicted, and pro claimed before the universe as enemies of God and of mankind. But there is going to be a judgment day. Things are very much mixed up in this world, and it seems natural that there should be a clearing up. Conscience says there is to be a judgment day. We feel that all wrongs are going to be punished. When we see it is not done here—for we see wicked people ride to their grave In theKr carriages, and we see the good and righteous go down to the grave with sorrow and pain—we feel, I say, that there should be a judgment day. Christ says there shall be a judgment day ; and. my brethren, you cannot take one piece out of the Bible and reject another. Tou must take It as a uniform piece : you must take it as a book. It says many things you prize, and which you would not like to lose ; and It says we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ to receive the things done in the body, whether they be good or whether they be bad. About the Judgment there must be great mystery, which I cannot understand, which no other man can un derstand, which perhaps the angels of heaven oannot understand; but God Almighty Is strong enough to make these things which seem so difficult surmount able. This Day of Judgment will be one of the most Important days that has come upon this earth. And she has seen some wonderful days! The day when God created the world was a wonderful day. Whether It was done by a direct act, or as some people maintain by evolu \- tton. It was a truly wonderful transac tion: and I do not wonder that the morn ing stars sang together as they witnessed that creation, and the saints of God shouted for Joy. The redemption of the world was a marvellous act—when the Father gave His Son to be condemned ahd to suffer as the man of sorrows. What a day It was when Jesus, the Son of God, broke His heart upon the Cross that He might deliver us from our bad, cursed habits, and take out of us all evil. Oh! my God, my Christ, what a day it was when Thou didst break Thy heart upon the dark mountain! And the saving! what a wonderful act that was! I remember when I was about to leave for the States how It was rung across the Atlantic that the Governor of the State of Illinois had pardoned those Anarchists. What a daring act It was! Little did I know that this same Go vernor would preside at one of my social meetings In that great State. It was looked upon as a wonderful day In the States, but when God pardons a man— the man that has dared to break the laws of heaveft and has trampled on the Son of - God—ifell may the angels* of heaven nil the heavens with song! Yes, the MTtac of the world Is a marvellous act; but the judging of it! I will not say that it Is as Important as the making of It, or as the redemption or the saving of it; but 1 will say that that day, when He shall summon all the inhabitants of the earth, will be an Important one. Oh God! that we may all be ready! I want to remark that this Judgment .Day will be of the greatest importance to you when you remember the circum stances which will precede it The cir oumstances are not described In this book. But we can gather some sort of Idea of the marvellous circumstances that will precede and accompany this day of days. I think I see the patience of the Great Jehovah exhausted; He can not in justice to Himself and poor sinners on earth allow this state of things to continue longer when all real opportuni ties are ended. I see the hour has come for the winding up of the clock of time. And I see Gabriel as he receives the signal of the Great King with his clarion in his hand wing his flight in company with thousands of other great angels, and see him plant one foot upon earth and the other upon the floods and swear that for ever and ever time shall be no more. Then I see him put his clarion to his lips and blow a blast, and the millions of other angels do the same. And as the reverberation of the trumpets cease, I see in the thea tres, in the concert halls, in the church es, in the mansions of the great, and in the hovels of the poor—l see great spirits appear. I see spirits ! ghosts ! ghosts ! everywhere—l see them walking over the route of the rivers and the seas, and everybody cries out with won der, " What can this be ?" And at last I hear them say, " This—this—this is the resurrection of the Dead !" An other strange sight meets their vision ! What can it be ? Ah ! the sense of consciousness strikes and takes posses sion of the vast multitude, and the righteous shout, " Here at last is the great white throne !" Ere wonder has passed from them they exclaim, " Lis ten ! what is this strange music ? What is it ?" and every eye Is turned in the direction from which it seems to come. Here is the long-looked-for on earth, the long-waited-for in heaven ! Here is the grand procession coming to the judgment ! Here it comes, headed by the cavalry of heaven ; with its white horses and millions and millions of angels. And here is a wonderful form ! Who can this be ? Everybody knows who it Is. Some signs mark It as a human form ; by tome signs it appears to be the Son of Man, but ten thousand other signs mark It as the Son of God ! Here is the Lamb that was slain leading on ; the Lion of the Tribe of Judah ! And what is this ? Here is the Book of Life. I think I see this Book of Life brought by angels. It might be books and books as we know them ; or living scrolls and scrolls and scrolls of pearly white ! On the one side I see them, written on in letters of gold are the names of the angels, names of the faithful—God's own. On the other side of the throne I see the books of death. I see the angels unroll them on sheets of the blackest darkness. Writ ten in letters of blood are the names of the rejected of Jesus Christ; the names of those who were too busy to save their souls ; too busy with their money making, their fine things, their mar riages and their giving in marriage, to get ready for the Judgment Day. I see every eye glued to the book of ttfe an* the book of death. The trial is begun. The righteous go to the right hand ; the wicked to the left hand. This is your day. Tou trampled on and sneered at the justice of God. Did you think the justice of God was not going to work out ? He hides Himself, but He will come forward, and that will be His day. Mercy has held His arm, but now His day has come ; and as the dark black midnight scrolls are unrolled, in blood red letters will be found written the names of those who would not have His mercy. At last the affair is finished. The last stroke of the bell of Time is struck. The final has been run. The declaration has been made as to who are winners and who are the losers, and the last chapter comes to a con clusion. No, not quite, for, see, there are two more processions. There is a pro cession marshalled by the fiends of hell. Those forming it will take their farewell look and journey down to the gates of the damned. I have read of the proces sion of unfortunates to Siberia, the region of eternal snow. I have read of the chain-gangs of the slaves who Journey through the barren sands of Africa on their way to slave ships. But, no, there is no comparison—nothing that can com pare with that band of men and women who will look one long look at the gates of heaven that will never be theirs ; one last look at Him who would have been their Saviour ; and then turn round and see go by the Hallelujahs, the music, those who have been cleansed by the blood of God and have accepted 'salva tion. Then I see them go down, down, down to find themselves In that dark abyss with those who have been the com panions of their lives. Then I look at the other procession—the music, the de light, the Hallelujahs, as they march until they come to the gates, unto the sea of glass ; march ! march into the realm? of joy and glory for ever and ever. Now I want to get a little closer, and remark that this will be the most im portant day for you men and women in this audience. It was an important day when you yonder saved your soul ; it will be an important day when you are called forward and your deeds are weighed. You yonder will find that it was a most important time when you dashed from ycur lips the goblet of the water of life ; when you refused His mercy. Not know ingly, you say. Ah, no ;no man does it knowingly. But God does not tell people when it is their last chance. To come nearer : there are three things I wish to emphasise, and then I am done. In the first place, it will be Important, because you will be there. Tou will be there ; there to take your trial ! Your destiny will be settled; your sentence will be pronounced. His word will come which will swing you into heaven or swing you into hell. In the second place, it will be an important day to every one in this audience, because. If your name is found in the book of life, you will go without further trial, for your sins have been blotted out. They used to sing In the old country the old hymn— " When the roll Is called in heaven I will answer to my name !" It will be a good thing if your name is called In heaven, but it will be more beautiful If it is written in the book of life. I know many people are sick of their name. They don't like it, and would change it if they could. They would never have had It had they had any voice in the matter when it was given them. But if you da not like it here, I tell you your name will be as musio if you hear It there. "Oh !" you say, "my name will be there. My name will be there!" Why ? You have no right to think you are going to see it unless you are sure you have it written to-night from this! theatre. Why should you ? My third point Is that It will be an Im portant day to you If your name is not in the book of life. In that case you must go to the left hand—to the left hand ! People will condemn themselves. We cannot make you believe there Is harm In holding yourselves away. On that day it will be too late. Then no songs will do it! Then, without a word from the preacher, you will go down—down! You say, " Oh, but my name is in the church register," and " I've been to the sacrament!" But is it in the book of life! Is It. I ask! If It Isn't, the church register and the sacrament avail you nothing! The man, the woman, who has heard the word of Christ and obeyed it; the man, the woman, who heard. His commandments and kept them —these are the people who are going to the right hand. The others are going to the left. Think of the painful exposure of your past conduct—all the nasty, dirty things you have done ! To go to hell would be a trivial matter to some of you. but to have your conduct exposed will b«t a trial 1 Just think of it. Imagine you were to be summoned to this stage to hear a recital of your past acts ! Why you'd die of very shame—you'd blow your brains out before you came! But this Is not the Judgment Day. This Is the day of mercy. The day of judgment Is not here, but the sheep are here and the goats are here. You sheep, look your Bible up. You goats, throw yourselves upon Christ's mercy. He will receive you. Diagram Showing thb Bsbvlts or Couplets and Incomplkti Mamobis on Whratbn Hat. (From the Bepork of the Hawkeibury Agricultural College.) No. Manure used. Yield per acre. Mo.
