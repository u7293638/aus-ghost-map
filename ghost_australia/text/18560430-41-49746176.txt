CHINESE IMMIGRATION. TO TIIE EDITOR OP THE BEGISrER. Sir â€” l am glad to perceive tnat a numoer oi Chinese have lately been arriving at Port Ade laide, and that more are likely to follow, which [ hope is not so much the result of accident as ot a more liberal and enlightened policy Dcing ndopted by our Legislature than in the neigh bouring colonies. To me it appears their arrival in South Australia, even in considerable numbers, can do no harm '; for if they become agricultural labourers the price of provisions will fall in proportion, and if they become gold diggers they increase the number of consumers, and thereby benefit the farmers. Should it, however, bo decided to levy a poll-tax, or to prohibit their arrival altogether, then it becomes an interesting question to statesmen and philan thropists if these people could not be other wise provided for. In this vast continent, from the little we know of the north coast, I should fancy that from the climate and soil it is ?well adapted for the cultivation of cotton ; and it i3 well known there are thousands in China who are ready ami willing to come as labourers in order to avoid the risk of starvation or of having their throats cut, which seems to be very much the fashion at present in their own country. Be sides this, the natives of India, who are close at hand and are used to the cultivation of cotton, might probably bs introduced with advantage in more limited numbers. Tome this appears a glorious field for the young and enterprising, and there ato many such in South Australia, and they might thereby not only benefit them selves and Jhe Chinese in a pecuniary point of view, but become a means under Providence of destroying slavery in America, which has been stated on, good authority to rest on a cotton bale. I am, Sir, &c.-;, THE GHOST OP UNCLE TO^VT.
