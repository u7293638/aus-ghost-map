THE HELP THAT COMES TOO LATE. . It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, That gives you a bit of a beartacho At tbo sotting of the sun, The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you did not sond, dear, Aro your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted, Out of a brother's way, The bit of henrtsomo counsel, You were hurried too mueh to say Tho loving touch of tbo hand, dear The gentle winning tono Whiah you had no time aud thought for, , With troubles of your own. Those little acts of kindness So easily out of mind. Those ohahces to bo angels Which we poor mortals find— . They come iu night and silence, Each sad reproachful wraith, Wbohhopo is faiut aud flagging And a chill has fallen on f&itn.; For Ilfo ia all too short, dear, And sorrow is ail too great To suffer our slow oompas9ion That tarries until too lato ; - And It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's tho thing you leave undone, Which gives you a bit of heartache At tho sotting of tho sun. — Margayot E. Snng6ter.
