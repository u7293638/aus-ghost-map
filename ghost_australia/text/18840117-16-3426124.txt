DONAL GRANT. By George Macdonald. Author of "Alec Forbes," "Malcolm," &c;,&.c. CHAPTER XLVIII Donal had been at home about ten days, during which not a word had come to Dances himself from the castle, and he was beginning to gross, not anxious, but fungi by for ross s of Lady Arctura, st hen from a sound sleep he startled suddenly awakes one midnight to find his mother by his bedside , she had loved him with difficulty "Laddie," she said, "I'm thinkin' were wanted." "Whom am I started, mother'' he asked, rubbing his eyes, but with anxiety already this sobbing at his heart " At the castle," who Copland Hoo ken jo that he asked May be ye st adina care to ken, an'1st ad bao ill tells her she answered "Ye may on' it by what name he like, but glen I was you, Donal, I st and be atf afore the day break, to ken st that they're dum' say that pure loddyatthc minkie plate by o has' left. My heart is that air about her I cannot est another moment till I had you as a upon the 10d til her '" By this time Donal was out of bed, and hurrying on his clothes He had the pro- foundest faith in ss baits on his mother said Was this a second sight she had had He had never been told that she possessed the gift' She might has had a dream, of some impression so deep that she could not but j add to it ! One thing only was plaintively was no time to be lost in asking questions It was enough to him that his mother said " Go and that it was for the sake of Lady Victoria that she so wanted him to go I Hoss quickest could he go " There were horses at Sir Gibbie s, it would save much time if he took one Putting i ci ust of bread in his pocket, he set out running There st is a little moonlight, enough for one who knew every foot of the way, and in half an hour of swift descent bosses at the stable door of Glasln each By this time he knew all the stays of the place, and, finding himself unable to rouse any one, speedily gained an entrance, and opened the door, found his Gibbio's favourite mare, and without a moment's hesitation saddled, by idled, led her out, and mounted her. His mother had under taken to go down as soon as it was light and let them know if he should have found it necessary to rob the stable. And now that he was safe in the saddle, with four legs under him, and time to think, he began to turn over in his mind that he must do But he soon saw that he could plan nothing until he knows what st as the matter, of st Inch he had dreadful forebodings Was it not possible that a man in the mental and moral condition of the earl would risk any thing and everything, unrestrained by law or conscience, to secure the property for his son, and through him for the family ' Donal found at least that has me once yielded to the suggestion of the possibility, there st as Remove any where for him to stop The call might might poison her, smother her, kill her anyhow, and then rushed into his mind what the housekeeper had told him about his co city to his st lie, a man like that, who was no longer capable objection, however well he might I note the difference between right and is i one, who boldly did know the diffcienccbotsseen dreaming that he did a thing and actually doing that thing, could scarcely be considered a safe member of a family than any iles is in or out of hell He st ould base blamed himself bitterly for having gone away had he not been so sure that he was not fpllowmglus own will in the matter, if there were a better stay than he had taken, he did not think that way had been intended for him to go in, else it would have been shown him. But now he would be restrained by no considerations of delicacy towards the call or anyone what ever his hand found to do he would do, regardless of how it might look' If he could not readily get a word with Lady Aictura, he would at once seek the help of the law, tell what he knew, and get a warrant of search He dared not think st hat he headed, but he felt honored be sure of nothing without seeing her with his own eyes, and healing from her own mouth that all was sullenly that should not be, else at hy should his mother base have sent him to her ' Doubtless the way to help her st could be unfolded to him as he went on And, if everything should seem to go against him, be would yet say, with Sir Philip Sydney, that " since a man is bound no further to himself than to do wisely, chance is only to trouble them that stand upon chance ' If his plans of attempts, whatever they might be, should all in themselves fail one after the other, jet, he said to himself, "there's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough seas than those she will And so he lode on, taking good cane of his horse, lost much haste should make the less speed But the animal st as strong and in good condition, and by the time he had seen the sun rise, climb the beacons and go half way down their western slope and had stopped three times to refresh her, he found himself, after much climbing and descent, on a good level road that promised by nightfall to bring him to the place of his desire But the poor beast was now getting tired and no wonder, for he had had a hard days work Donal dismounted everybody and then to relieve her, that he might go the faster when he mounted again, comforting himself that, in the true path, the delays are as important as the speed for the home is the point, not the swiftness an hour too soon may be more disastrous than an hour too late' He would arrive at the right time for Him whose stays are not as our ways, because they are so much better' The sun went down and the stars came out and the long tss dight began But before he had got a mile further he became suddenly ass are that the sky had clouded over, the stars had vanished, and rain was at hand The day had been sultry, and relief had armed lightning flamed out, and darkness full of thunder followed. After a few dashes it became evident that the storm was dressing never His horse, though young and high spirited, Eastoe we try tobogieatly frightened, the ram refreshed net, and they made a little more speed But it was dark night, amidst the noisy grumbling now raging storm, before they came where, had it been light, Donal st could have looked to see the castle When he reached the town, he rode into the yard of the Morven Arms, and, having there found a sleepy ostler, gave up his horse he would be better without her at the castle and was just setting out to walk to the castle when the landlord appeared who happily had by this time learned to pay proper respect to the tutor at the castle " We didna like to see you, sir, at this time ' he said " Why not returned Donal, scenting information We thocht ye was away for the summer, scene think the young gentleman says, an the earl himself follows '" " Where is he gone ' ' asked Donal "Oh, Dinna ye ken, sir has no ye hard ' ' " Not a word " "That's sarra strange, sir' There's a clearance at the castle First gazed ray Lord Forger an' syne my lord himself' an' ray lady, his niece, an' syne gazed the housekeeper, Mrs tress Brookes for her mother was deem,' they said I'm thinkin' there many be a wedding' to the fore There was some word of' fitting' up the auld house in' the toon here, cause Lord Forgue didna care about been at the castel any danger It's strange you have hard, sir," he went on, for Donal stood absorbed in awful hearing " Surely some letter rain has mis canned ! ' He felt as if the sure and firm set earth were giving way under his feet. "I still run up to the castle, and hear all about it from some of the people," he said " Look after my horse, will you ' ' "But In tell' you, sir. we'll find' nobody there, said the man "They're a game. To the best of my knowledge, there's no a soul about this place keep it may be deaf Jean Lobban, Wha wadna hear the angel withe last trump. Mair by token, she's that fears for robbers that she gangs till her bed the minute it begins to grow dark, and sticks her held anchors the bed cities-no that that makes her only defer " " Then you think there is no use in going up ?" he said, "Not the smallest," answered the innkeeper. " Get me some supper then, I will take a look at my horse, and be m by and by." He went and saw that the horse was being ministered to, and then set off for the castle as fast as his legs would carry him. There was foul play somewhere beyond a doubt where or of what sort he could not tell ! but first he must make sure that the man's report was correct If it was, he would go straight to the police The factor had left with his sister for a hold it before he did. He mounted the hill, and drew near the castle A terrible gloom fell upon him there was not a light in the sullen pile ' It was gloomy even to terror He went to the main entrance, and rang the great bellas loud as he could ring it, but there was no answer to the The sole right of publication in Queensland of "Donal Grant has been purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Continuity, Limited. summons, which echoed and yelled horribly as if the house were actually empty He rang again, and again came the horrible yelling echo, but no more answer than if it had been a mausoleum Although he had been told enough to know what to expect his heart sank within him Once more he sang and waited, but time was neither sound nor heating Should he go away 2 The place grew so ter able to him as he stood there that, had he found the door was wide open, he would almost have hesitated to enter But something urged him from within, his mother had sent him here surely she was only the agent of another I-and here was his first chance of him ning whither they had gone there might be a letter or some message for him anyhow, he knew that he had to go into that house, and at least learn whether it was indeed empty There was false play he kept repeating to himself but what was it And where was it to be met and defeated ' As to getting into the house, there was no difficulty, and he made no delay , he had in his pocket the key to his own staff, which he generally earned and if he had not had it he would yet soon have got in, for he knew all the ins and outs of the place better than any one else about it. As it was however, he had to climb 01 or two walls before he got to the door of the north tower Happily he had left it locked when he went away, else probably they would have assuredly other a rise He is out softly, and with a strange feeling of dread, up the stair to his 100111 He must settle in his mind what he was to do fast, or rather is it he was to do at all He would not go roaming about the house authoresses loving unexpectedly upon the deaf old woman, and tciiifymghcioutofhci sons is That would not be the way to get any infor in action out of her If there were no false play, he went on thinking as he walked wearily up the star, sin ely at least Mrs Bl ookes would have written to let him know they were going If only he could be 11 n who 0 she was He SA is 11101 e and 111010 weary us he ascended, and when be reached the top he staggered into his own room, and fell on the bed in the dark But he could not rest the an of the place w is stifling The storm had ceased for a while, but the atmosphere was yet full of thunder, and terribly oppressive He got up ready to faint, and opened the window A little breath of a tame 111, and 1 cms ed him , then came 1 little wind, and in it the man of what they used to call the ghost music It awoke many 1 reminiscences There again was the lightning The thunder broke with a great roar that believed among the roofs and chimneys The storm was to his mind, it would do him good He went out on the 1 roof, and mecha- finally took his way towards the stack of chimneys in which was the iLoliaii hup At the base he sat down, and stated into the darkness The lighting cane, and he saw the sell The watching like a perfect peace to take up do if it souls, and the land bordering it like a waste of dread Then came the thunder so loud that it not only deafened but seemed to blind him, so that his barn turned into a lump of clay and then a lull And in the hall seemed to come a voice, calling, calling', from a Lieut distance Was it possible Was he the foot of weariness and excitement, or did he actually heal his own name What could it be but the voice of Lady Aictuia, calling to him from the spot world' They had killed her, but she had not forgotten him ! She was calling to remind him that they would meet by and by in the land of liberty His heart swelled in his bosom Cann another roar of thunder, and when that ceased there was the voice again "Mr Grant Mr Grant . come , come and he thought he heard also, but could not be sure, "You promised' Alas, the voice was from very far away But, could it be from the spirit land ' Would she bring his promise to bear on him thence, tempting line thither ' She would not I And she knew, too, that he would not go before his hour, if all the spots on the other side were to call him to them He remembered having heard and lead of voices from far away, while those who called were yet on the body Once more it tame, but this time it was very faint, and he could not tell what it said A wail of the ghost music followed close, and that seemed to come from behind him, not from the chimney Working apparently by conti uses, it woke 111 him a thought which study would have walked sooner but for the state he was in' God 111 heaven ! could she be down there in the chapel ' He sprang to his feet With superhuman energy) he gave a spring and caught hold of the edge of the cleft, di cw himself up till his month was on a level with it, and called aloud, " Lady Arctic ' ' There came no answer ' I am stupid as death " he said to himself. "1 base lot bel tell me in sam ' ' "I am coming 1" he cried, filled with sudden life and joy, dropped on the roof and sped down the stem to the door that opened on the second floor, he knew the way so well that be needed but a little guidance from his hands, and would not strike a light, to reach Lady Aictura's forsaken chamber. He Inn ried to the spot where the wardrobe had stood, and would with one whose have sent it out of his stay. There was nothing tion el His heart sank st turn him Was he in a terrible dream ' He had made a mistake ' He had to use too much to his knowledge of the house, and deceased himself as to st here host as Clearly he was not in the light loom 1 He must at last strike a light, for he had no longer a notion where he was Happily he is as ss eil pros held Alas' alas' Iicstassvhero he had intended to be It was her room ' there was the wardrobe a yard or so away from its usual position, but where it had stood was no recess I Fresh plaster gave clear sign of where it had been, and that was all 1 It was no dream, but an awful succession of facts He did not lose a moment contemplating the change. It would have taken him perhaps hours to be oak through though the mortar was not yet hard. Instinctively clutching his skene dhu, he darted to the state it must has been the voice of Al dura he had card She was walled up in the chapel ! Down the great fair, with the swift strong noiseless foot of the Highlander he sped to the door of the earl's business room, through which alone was the closet behind it and the oak door to be reached. It was locked There was but one way left' Down to the foot of the stair he shot. Good heavens ' if that way also should have been known to the earl' His heart beat so that he could hardly breathe. He crept through the little door underneath the state, and made a great noise with the pan and brush left Is ing there, but was now past fear of being heard. The low arch behind, through which he had crept, was not built up. In a moment he was in the crypt of the chapel. There was but one difficulty left I could he get up into the opening through the wall from the passage above' Or, so it, could he, on the steep slope of the same, find purchase for his feet so as to lift the slab he had there replaced ? He sprang at the slope, but there was no hold, and as often as he tried he slipped down again immediately. He tried and tried again till he was worn out and almost in despair. She might be dying, and he was close to her and could not reach her He stood still for a moment to think. Then came to his mind the word, "He that believeth shall not make haste;' and he thought with himself he could not at that moment have thought, had he not thought it many a time before-that God can- not well help men when their minds are in such a tumult that they will not hear what He is saying to them. God can easily help the man who will hear him speak if there be no other better way, he will work a miracle for him. "The food" does some foolish reader say '-"To be thinking when he should have been doing!' "Take care, I say to him, for the time will come when you will be able only to kick against the good of your dns or, because you counted it lost time to make a silence in your soul that you might hear what you ought to do ' With the fear that his friend might be at the point of death within a few feet of him, and for want of him, Donal hos)t the strength and wisdom to be quiet and to listen ' And, as he stood there in the dark, the version of the place came before him as when first he saw it, when he threw in the lighted envelope, and in the vision was the stone like a gray stone on which it fell and burned. He started at once from his quiescence, dropped on his hands and knees, and crawled until he found it. Then out came his knife, and he dug away the earth at one end until he could got both hands under it, when he heaved it from the floor, and shift- ing it along, got it under the opening in the wall. cmntR XLIX Moe v madness, cupidity, cruelty, and, I am old fashioned enough to think, immediate de- maniacal temptation working in and on a mind that had ceased almost to distinguish between the real and the unreal and that not merely as over man who bends the energies of an immortal spirit to further the ends and objects of his lower nature, fails so to distinguish But as one unable during considerable portions of his life, to tell w better things took place outside or inside him, content to argue that what equally affected him had an equal right to be regarded as actually existent, and forgetting that there yet remained the fact that the existences were at least of different natures, having difWoMt haws and involving different demands upon the two consciousnesses had culminated in a hideous plot, in which it would be hard to say whether folly, crime, or cunning predominated, and the earl had made up his mind that, if the daughter of his brother should continue to refuse to carry out what he asserted and probably believed to have been the wish of her father, and marry her cousin, she should, provided there were another world to go to go there before him, and leave her property to the son in whom he had resolved to make up to his mother for the wrong he had done her j while if there were no other world, in which to be consoled for the loss of this, there were yet the words of Hamlet to quote-" Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes V" in other words, she would be no worse thansho would of necessity have been, when the few years of her natural earthly pilgrimage were over; and the difference to her was not worth think- ing of beside this greatness of the stake to him. But at the same time he hoped a Little fright would serve, and she would consent to marry Forgue to escape the fate she should soon see hanging over her-in prospect of which probability he took care that Forgue should not bear a blame fit to render it all but impossible she should afterwards learn to love him, sending him and of the way to London. The moment Donal was gone he began, therefore, to make himself pleasing as he had well known how in his youth, and soon had reason to be satisfied that interest could yet rouse something in him of the old gift of pleasing; with the ad vantage of the loving prejudice of a dutiful niece, it was not difficult for him to overcome, or a least to hold at abeyance, the the distrust of him which had for some time been growing rather than diminishing in her mind, and be prevailed upon her, and that without much entreaty, to consent to accompany him to London merely for a month or so, he said, while Davie was' gone. He would take her here and take, her there, and introduce her to the best society in the capital. She did not expect much from his so undertaking ; but the prospect of again seeing London, where she had not been since she syus a little girl with her father, had its attractions for her imagination, and she con-' sented not, however, without writing to Donal to communicate the fact ; her letter, it is hardly needful to ask how, never reached kits. The earl arranged, in order, as he said, to show his recognition of her sweet compliance, that they should post it all the way; ; nobody now-a-days, he said, ever saw anything of his own country. She should, for he would take her by the road he used to travel himself when he was a young man, and railways were in their infancy ; she should judge for herself whether we had not lost much of far more value than anything gained by mere rapidity which, indeed, only made life itself seem so much the shorter. He sent Summons before him, and contrived that almost as soon as he himself was gone Mrs. Brookes should receive a letter from the clergyman of the parish in a remote part of Caithness where her mother, adopt a very old woman, lived, saying that she was at the point of death, and could not die in peace till she had seen her daughter. The whole thing was the work of a madman-ex- cellently contrived for the immediate object, but having no outlook into the dangers of the future. Mrs. Brookes had at once obeyed and gone. He knew that she would leave some one in the house, but he knew also who that was likely to be-namely, old deaf Jean Lobbail ; this was an advantage for his plot. After the first night on the road, be turned across country, and a little towards home; after the next night he drove straight back. As it was by a different road, Arcturit suspected nothing. When they had got within a few hours of the castle they stopped at a little inn for tea, and there he contrived to give her a dose of one of those drugs he had with him. At the next place he represented her as his daughter with whom, because of a sudden illness, he was anxious to reach home, however late He gave an imaginary name to the place, and kept on the last post boy, who knew nothing of the country He, knowing it well from old time, give directions that completely bo wildered him, and he sit them down at their own cattle door supposing it to be an altogether , different dates and in a different part of the country, it was a kind of thing quite after the earl s own heart, for he delighted in making a fool of his fellow men t ii Last of all he sent him away so as altogether to avoid the town, where alone, so far as the outlook of the earl went it was of minor taste that nothing should be inspite of his return Ilosvhi could effect what followed I hardly know, but he had the remains of great strength, and when mules certain influences, which he knew how to manage, was for the time almost as strong as he had ever been, he contrived to get her up to his room on the stair, and through the oak door He had prey ready made preparations in the chapel with his own hands and his own hands only All was in beautiful readiness, while the pi 031 test of what he was going to do and witness woke no unpleasing recollection of former cruel delights, and made him for the moment feel almost } young again So far he had carried out the programme he had drawn up [TO BE CONTINUED]
