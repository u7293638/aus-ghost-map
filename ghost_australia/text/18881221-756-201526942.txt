The' Sin off Omission. It isn't the thing yon do, dear, It's tho thing you loavo undono, Whioh gives you a bit of a heartache, At the Batting of tho sun. Tho tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, Tho flower you might havo Bout, dear, Aro your haunting ghosts to-night. , Tho stone you might havo lifted . : ' ' Out of a brothor's way, : - The bit of hoart soino council You were hurried too much to say. The taring touch of the hand; dear, Tho gontlo and winsome tono, That rou had no. tune nor thought for, . With trouble, enough of your own. Theso littlo aots of kindness, . ' So easily out of mind; 1 Thoso chances to bo anmla ' Which oven mortals find— ' They come in night and silonoe, ' Each chill, reproachful wraith, ' Whon hope is faint and flagging, . . And a ulight has drooped on faith. For lifo Is all too short, dear, And sorrow Is aM too groat, . , , To suffor our slow oompassion . . - " 'That tarries until too loto, . And it's not tho thing you do, dear, - ...--. It's the thing you leave undone,'- - . Which gives you the bitter heartaeho ' \- ' At the sotting of tho sun. ' u — Maeoabb? N. SAKdsran.
