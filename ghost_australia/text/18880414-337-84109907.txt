Sam Sees Ghosts. Sir S. W. Griffith must be in a political delirium tremens. He is baunted by Coolie ghosts, Kanaka ghosts (Pietzcker's Mean-White ghosts, but he doesn't mention these), and the ghosts of "rings " and " syndicates." He sees phantoms that no one else sees, just as a man in the horrors can see blue devils which are invisible to sober, cleanly brains. Sam assured his election audience the other Bight that the most tyrannical rings existed in Central and Northern towns. He worked himself up into a fever heat of imagination. "Why," said he, "I was in a town the other day, where the people assured me lhat they dared not get up a requisition to a Liberal candidate, because, if they did, they would simply be boycotted by the rings, who have got the com mand of money. In another town I met a man who told me that, from the day he had announced himself as a supporter of the Liberal party, not a single customer in the shape of a planter had entered his shop. That is the m^ueuce which these syndicate rings have, and if we let them come here we shall get into a state of terrorism." " Augh 1 that is too thin," came in a dry, cynical voice, with an abruptness that craqked the respectful silence with which Sam's statements had been received. Had a clown suddenly shot up through a trapdoor on to the platform and turned a back somersault, the effect could not have been more emphatic. The audience exploded with laughter, wave after wave of which interrupted the proceedings for some minutes. The people had been trying to swallow Sam's gas seriously, and, at least, without outward signs of dis respect, but the solitary croak of dissent upset all their gravity, and they at once showed Sam that he wasn't " fetching " them on that tack.
