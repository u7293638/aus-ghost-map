Witherell, master, forty months out—850 barrels sperm oil, 900 barrels black— on the 22nd November, lat. 37.10 south, long. 158.3 east. THE schooner Maid of Riverton, for Portland, was sighted by the Mary and Rose, on the 5th inst., under Rabbit Island. Wished to be reported. THE ship Lady Young, from Dunedin for Welsh- pool, was sighted by the Glencoe off Rodondo. THE ship Glencoe has made a good trip to and from Dunedin of thirty days. During her stay there, she discharged over 500 tons of cargo. She brings back sixty passengers. The schooner Ismyr, from Hong Kong, brings dates to 2nd October, being six days' later than last mail's advices. Captain Summers reports that the clipper ship Westminster left Hong Kong on 25th September, with general cargo for Melbourne, and that a severe typhoon took place in the China Sea on 29th Sep- tember, which wrecked and disabled several vessels, the Westminster probably among the number, as she had not been heard of at Anjer when the Ismyr passed through. LOSS OF THE SPORTING LASS.—On Friday morning the boats belonging to the Sporting Lass, whaling brig, arrived in Brisbane, bringing the crew and Cap- tain Bennett, the master of the vessel. The following account of the loss of his vessel has been furnished to us by Captain Bennett :— The Sporting Lass, whaling brig, of Sydney, Bennett, master, left that port on the 24th August, on a whaling cruise to the South Pacific whaling grounds. She arrived at the Chesterfield Bank on the 14th day out, and remained there while whales were to be seen. On the 3rd November she left that place for the French Reefs, to the north-west of New Caledonia, and during the passage she had light winds from the west, veering round to the south-west, south south-west, south, and south- east, and afterwards light and variable winds, principally from the south south-east. On November 4, at half-past four p.m., she sighted an island, bearing about north-north-west, about sixteen miles from the ship. At seven p.m., while in the act of tacking, the wind followed the ship round, when the sheets were hauled alt, and she stood on, the vessel heading to the north-east and by north, and the isle bearing north- west, about twelve miles distant. At fifty minutes past eleven p.m., the look-out reported that he saw the bottom, and on sounding, seven fathoms of water were found. No reefs or breakers were visible. The helm was ordered to be put down and the yards hauled aft, which was done ; and the vessel then struck, but so lightly that it was not felt on board, and in- deed it was not until the coral knolls were seen all round the vessel on looking over the side, that it be- came known that she was on shore. At this time there was a strong current running to the north and west. Both pumps were rigged, and kept going ; but as she was making a great deal of water, the port cable was veered out, and the brig was allowed to drift on to the eastern prong of the reef, as it was feared that she would sink before the provisions, &c.;, could be secured. At one a.m., the water was over the blubber-room, although the men were con- tinually kept at the pumps ; and at two a.m., the brig gradually settled down on the port side. The whaleboats were then lowered, and anchored clear of the vessel. An hour later a dingy was lowered, and got safely alongside the brig, which at this time was getting very uneasy. A few tools and other articles were taken into the boats, and as daylight broke, an island was sighed from them as they lay at anchor. They then left, the brig and made for the island, and on reaching it, it was found that it was occupied by the crew of the American whaler Hope, of New Bedford, which had been wrecked on the shoal on the 17th of October. Captain Bennett and his crew landed on this isle, which was called Gifford's Island, on the 5th November, and camped there until they left for the Australian coast. On the following day, three boats were sent to the wreck to procure some boat planks and other necessaries to fit the boats out for the passage for Sydney, whither it was his intention to proceed. Everything was ready for sea on the 12th of Novem- ber, but as the weather became unsettled, they did not leave Gifford's Island till nine a.m. on the 17th of the same mouth. They then made for Bennett's whaling station, which was reached at seven p.m. on the same day. On the 19th, Captain Bennett, with a portion of his crew—twenty-one men in all, having left seventeen coloured men on the island—left the station in three boats, in company with four boats belonging to the Hope, containing the whole of her crew, numbering twenty-six men. These seven boats remained in company till the evening of the 19th, when those belonging to the Hope were lost sight of, and were not again seen until after they had arrived in Brisbane. One boat belonging to the Hope is still missing, and as we understand that she could not be considered in a seaworthy condition, some fears are expressed for her safety. She was in charge of the third mate, and had seven men in her. Captain Bennett informs us that there is no water naturally on the island on which he left his seventeen men, but there is a distilling apparatus thereon which is capable of condensing 115 gallons of water in four- teen hours.—Moreton Bay Courier, Nov. 28 LOSS OF THE HOPE AT BAMPTON SHOAL.—On Thurs- day morning, about eight o'clock, the master and portion of the crew of the American whaler Hope arrived in Brisbane in their boats, and reported the wreck of their vessel on Bampton Shoal, on the 17th October last. The following particulars have been fur- nished to us by Captain Gifford, the master of the vessel :—The American whaling ship, Hope, 300 tons register burthen, L. S. Gifford, master, belonging to New Bedford, sailed from Sydney, on a two years' cruize, in July last. She was tolerably successful in taking whales up to the 17th October last, on which date she got stranded on Bampton Shoal. The weather at the time was fine, and the disaster was solely owing to an error of nearly forty miles in the position of the shoal as laid down on Captain Gifford's chart. From the time of the wreck to the 30th Octo- ber, the ship's company were engaged in securing provisions, stores, and other articles from the ship by means of the boats. These they conveyed to an island near the scene of the disaster. Subsequently, from the 30th October to the 6th November, the crew were em- ployed in repairing the boats, to render them fit for the passage to the Australian coast. The party were ready to leave the island on the 6th November, but during the ten following days (to the 16th), such heavy weather prevailed that it was deemed imprudent to put to sea. At daylight on the morning of the 15th November, a brig was seen on the reef, about six miles distant from the island, which was occupied by the master and crew of the Hope. The crew were afterwards seen to abandon the brig, and come towards the island in the boats, when it was ascertained that the vessel was the Sport- ing Lass, whaling brig, of Sydney, Bennett, master. Captain Bennett, as our readers will remember, was cast away some few months ago at the same place, in the schooner Prince of Denmark, from the remains of which he constructed a smaller vessel called the Ham- let's Ghost, and in which he made his way to Brisbane. The crew of the Sporting Lass saved nothing from their vessel except what was taken into the boats when leaving her, and she soon afterwards became a total wreck. The two ships companies, re- mained together on the island for two days after the second wreck, and on the 17th November, the entire crew of the Hope left the shoal in the four boats which belonged to her, and in company with five boats containing the crew of the Sporting Lass. The whole of the nine boats remained together until the evening of the 19th, when Captain Gifford lost sight of the five boats belonging to Captain Bennett, also one of his own, which was in charge of the third mate. The three now remaining continued their course without further accident, and on the morning of the 24th inst., at three o'clock, they made Cape Moreton light. They reached Brisbane about eight o'clock yesterday morning, all in good health and spirits. It is supposed that the six missing boats have proceeded on to Sydney, it being Captain Ben- nett's intention to go thither without first putting into Brisbane, and, as far as we can learn, there are no ap- prehensions to be felt respecting their safety. Respect- ing the vessel herself, we learn that she has been absent from New Bedford about six years on her present voyage. With her cargo on board, as at present lying on the shoal, she is valued at 70,000dol. Captain Gifford is a heavy loser, and in all probability has lost the earn- ings of many years' toll. The vessel was, so far as we can learn, uninsured. The greater part of the crew which landed here have already shipped on board of the Rockhampton, Black Ball ship, which is about to proceed to Callao. The remainder will, we believe, with Captain Gifford, leave Brisbane for Sydney to- morrow in the Urara. We understand that it is the intention of Captain Gifford to sell the wreck on his arrival in Sydney.—Moreton Bay Courier. —————————— LAUNCH OF AN IRON-CLAD VESSEL FOR THE ITALIAN NAVY.—The new and splendid fri- gate, Re di Luigi di Portogallo, was launched on Saturday.
