GHOSTS. One ghost in London—that of the first Lord Holland—is said to walk the Sir Joshua room at Holland House with his head in his hand. The dead are said to walk on Kingston Bridge on All Souls Night. Anne of Cleeves still haunts the gallery at Hever Castle known by her name. Tourists are solemnly told that Nell Cook may be seen on moonlight nights at the Dark Entry in Canterbury, and Herne the Hunter was firmly believed by old Windsor people only to have ceased his perambulations of the forest when his oak was blown down not many years ago. In Sussex, most stolid and old fashioned of the home countries, there are plenty of ghosts. There is a drummer of Herstmonceaux; there is "Old Oxen bridge" of Brede Place; in primitive St. Leonard's Forest "Squire Paulett" is still believed to jump upon the crupper of the belated horseman, and stick there until clear country is reached. That very common English ghost, the black dog, abounds in Sussex. Under every sequestered wooden bridge the ready believer may see a headless old woman spinning, and in that lone coun- try between Kingston, near Lewes, and the marshes of the Ouse, more spinning —this time of charcoal—is done by a grey, eyeless goblin.
