THE NEW POPE. Dr. Vaughan's new Pastoral, on the. new Pope, Leo XIII., which has been duly praised by Freeman as a sort of in spired document, " appealing to the heart and conscience and intellect in the land." is a very poor affair. As usual, it is verbose, weak and assuming enough. If it has an appeal to the " intellect of the land," God help the intellect, for it must be weak intellect indeed which will not feel insulted by such imputation of inca-. pacity on the part of the readers of it. It begins by stating that only recently he, Dr. Yaughan, had "implored the clergy and the laity to pray for the repose of the soul of the great Pius i and to pray also that the sacred conclave might be guided by the Holy Spirit in the choice of a worthy successor." Now, it is strange that this which is supposed to be an "appeal to intellect," should, in these two or three lines perpetrate at least two absurdities. For example, why should Dr. Yaughan implore prayers for the re pose of the soul of Pius, since he has him- self admitted that he does not knoib what is the state of the soul of Pius? You can imagine a man imploring help for a person whom he knows to he in need ; but is it , possible to imagine a man imploring help, for a person about whom he knows .noth ing, and who may be entirely beyond all. ..such offers of help ? But let this pass as one of Dr. Vaughan's uncertainties ; look at the other absurdity of the Archbishop imploring prayers for the conclave to be, guided by .the Holy Spirit in the choice, of a worthy successor. The . famous; assumption of Papal claim is this, that the conclave is guided by the Holy Ghost, ' and must, as a matter, of course, elect ilie right successor. Moreover,, the' theory is, that when the conclave have elected any . one, that one is the right successor, and. licis 'been, chosen by the Holy Ghost. . In deed Dr. Yaughan adds that, altogether apart from this certainty that the con clave will .be gided by the Holy Ghost, the sacred conclave is so composed of " august personages " that " no ; other guarantee " is required to make sure that the right man will be elected Pope. Well, if it is certain that the conclave have such \- qualities of spiritual, moral, and intellec tual discernment, that the . right Choice will be made"; nay, if it is certain that the conclave will be infallibly guided to choose the right man to ,'be Pope, then, what absurdity than. -that' Dr. Yaughan should implore cl ei'gy 'and "laity to pray that the sacred 'conclave might he guided to " make a >vorthy choice, or,' as the Bishqp of /Bathurst has said, make a' ;;'Surely,- if the choice made be of the Holy,' Ghost, according to the usual Papal rassumption, must not, the one chosen' be worthy or judicious, as t a necessary consequence ? If the .one, chosen be " Peter," and v, if . Peter. , ' 'infallible, "/and if the; in|dble>plM.e .choibe of the Holy ; jGrhostj'suiely- grayers forsuchguidance must beVabs superfluous'? ?''; ; j '1'Tlie rest ,bfthe'4jbbirq'.stqral. is. only a rehashpfthefirstbheV whicbwe,hashed 'and hashed again, nafo.i'TOthingqrsti than an Irishstew, ,They£op ' always ' is, wlien.ass'u been refuted, to assert them again, -as if nothing had ever h'appehed. We.have shownby the most indisputable, historical proof -that the Popes have been, for the mpstvpart, a; line" of either superstitious nobodies, or of the most ambitious and unscrupulous of worldlings, or of the most debased and im moral and uncrupulous of rulers. We have shown from Roman Catholic writers, as well as from Protestant ones, that the Popes, many of them, " have been mon sters of iniquity," " apostat'eal rather than apostolical," and that some have been such abandoned wretches that they were guilty of every crime which human nature is able to perpetrate. Yet, Dr. Vaughan, in his new Pastoral has the audacity to say, evidently in reply to us — " read the story of the Popes from the day St. Peter was crucified on Jerusalem and the present hour ; and what do you find ? You find the history of warfare, of everlasting battles, . moral and physical, of violence and blood shed ; and why ? because the Popes are the vicars of Christ who was Himself, crucified between two thieves !" Then, he goes on to 'say, that to every attack, or solicitation of " the world " to wickedness or unfaithfulness, the Popes have always uttered their divine nonpossumus! And then he thus sums up—" Take the facts of history as sufficient confirmation of what I say ; thirty of the Popes were martyrs ; some of them were exiled, others impri soned, thirty were compelled to leave Home, while some of them were compelled to reside in a foreign land." What we always ask is that the simple facts of his tory should be accepted; and what is the value of these " simple facts " of Dr. Vaughan? But her, e are "simple facts" which Dr. Yaughn dare not specifically deny ; " Fifty Popes," says Gerebrard, a Roman Catholic historian, "in one hun-' dred and fifty years, from J ohn VIII. to Leo IX. entirely degenerated from the sanctity of their predecessors, and were apostatical rather than apostolical." Baro- nius, another Roman Catholic historian, says " many shocking monsters intruded into the pontifical chair, who were guilty of robbery, assassination, simony, dissi pation, tyranny, sacrilege, perjury and all kinds of miscreancy. Candidates, desti tute of every requisite qualification, were promoted to the Papal chair; while all the canons and traditions of antiquity: were contemned and outraged.":" The Church," says . Giannone, another , Roman Catholic historian, " was their in a, shocking dis order, in a chaos of iniquity'." . " Some " says Barclay, " crept into .the Popedom, while others ' broke in by violence; and defiled the holy chair with the filthiest immorality." Everyone ought to know the history of the two. harlots, Theodora and Marozia, who. ruled the Papal chair, and'barried on their debaucheries with the Popes in the face of' Rome. Theodora made John X. Pope, and continued to be his whore, until he was deposed; and Marozia was mistress to Sergius, one of his successors ! John. XII., was made Pope in his eighteenth or nineteenth year, and was, notwithstanding his youth,1 says' Platina, a. Roman Catholic historian,' worse in debauchery and immorality, than all his predecessors ! And John XXIIL was, says Labbeus, another Roman Catholic historian, convicted of forty crimes. The Constantino Fathers found his Holiness guilty of simony, piracy, exaction, bar barity, massacre, murder, lying, fornica tion, adultery, .incest, .constupration, and sodomy; yea, he described him as the oppressor of the poor, the persecutor T of the just, the pillar of iniquity, the column ' of ' simoriy, and, to finish the climax, an tiffimaculate devil !" He spent his youth in immodesty and defilement and impu - 'didtyl Ho passed his nights in debauchery and' his' days in sleep. He. violated mar ried' women and 'deflowered 'lioly nuns. Thre: hundred of these devoted virgins | ,were(tiie' unwilling" victims' of his ' piousness, &c;!; &c.; ! !

All this iseasily said by a i few rhetorical flourishes ; but the Papacy knows better. Men who are conscious of victory, and who know that their cause is established never shout and gesticulate as the Papacy is now doing. The action of cardinals and bishops and archbishops is that of men who know that their .time is short, and that power has already passed away out of their hands. According to Dr. Yaughan, however, Leo XIII. is soon to see what Pius IX. was not permitted to see. The God of Battles is to make Leo a lion who. will devour and break in pieces all his enemies 1 Yes, a "stuffed lion" from one of the museums! No doubt he has the skin — the claws — the bloody panted mouth, with ferocious teeth ; but he is a stuffed lion, which may frighten children, but will hurt nobody. Dr. Vaughan, however, is not aahamed to make Leo more than a stuffed lion. He has gone, he says, to the prophet Malachi and blasphemously attributed to him the words (wherever they are to be found) which are exclusively applicable" to Jesus Christ— the "Lumen in Cmlo." It is amusing or pitiful to see Dr. Vaughan exposing once more his total unacquaintance with Seripture. The prophet Malachi says not one word about a " Lumen in Casio." These words don't occur in Malachi. Perhaps they are a Popish tradition. We forgive him ; for "Leo", is one of the constellations; but he must go back to Pagan times ; or understand the language as only a Pagan figure. Somewhere in the same heavens there is a "dog star ? hut who is he 1 An amusing correspondence has ap- peared in Freeman between school teachers and the editor, on the subject of the removal of the inspectors from their pre- sent districts to other places. The editor condemned the action of the Council of Education for such removals, because the change would be injurious to Catholic denominational schools, for the new in- spectors would he sure to give as the result of their inspection the marks of only "tolerable and moderate," , while the pre- sent, inspectors have been wont to give them the marks of "fair," "good,", and "excellent;" and dreading so serious a result, the editor has soundly rated Mr. Wilkins as the author of the new persecu- tion of "Catholic schools." Two Catholic teachers have come up gallantly to the defence of Mr. Wilkins, and have asserted that he is a gentleman who has never ceased to show his sympathy with Catholic schools and teachers; and one of them has asserted that, it would have been absurd for Mr. Wilkins to have designed such persecution against Catholic schools since Mr. . Inspector O'Byrne— a Catholic— is to he removed from the country districts to Sydney. The editor has replied — "Oh I did not know that Mr. O'Byrne was ap- pointed to come to Sydney," meaning that if he had known that a Catholic Inspector was to be one of the inspectors of the Sydney district, and not Mr. M'Credie nor Mr. Hicks, as was supposed, a man who dis- covered such strange things in Catholic schools, he would not have attacked Mr. Wilkins, nor accused him of designing mischief on Catholic schools! This is all very curious and amusing, and lets us into the little secret of how Freeman and his authorities can wink to inspectors and hope from them that in their reports as few "moderates" and "tolerables" shall appear as possible, and as many "good," "fair," and "excellent" shall be returned as will not involve the inspector in positive lying! Quite so. Freeman knows all about the Jesuit doctrine of "morally present," and "virtually true by mental reservation." He practises it everyday; he sees the priests practising it in "their sacred calling of confession and preaching" and so he expects that if the heretical Hicks or M'Credie will not understand how to do things for the good and credit of Catholic schools, at least the Catholic O'Byrne will understand how to do it; and therefore since he has come to know that the inspector is coming, the editor consents to admit that he was ignorant! But the most curious part of the correspondence referred to is not yet mentioned. A third Catholic teacher comes up to defend the editor, and to refute the other two "admirers of Mr. Wilkins;" and this third man produces all sorts of proof that Mr. Wilkins is against Catholic schools. Here is one of those proofs : "Who supplied our enemies in the House with extracts from our Catholic books (which had been secretly and illegally used in the schools) in the debate that took place in 1867, when so much blasphemy was uttered! against the Mother of God, and His saints ? — Mr. Wilkins, of course!" Our readers will remember the extracts about "Holy Mary" and her other beau- ties in "copy lines." Had, therefore this wretched Mr. Wilkins concealed the Catholic books, and refused to give Parlia- ment extracts, he would have been the friend of "Catholic schools" but because he did neither, but rather exposed the whole Papal plot and convicted certain priests and teachers of lying, and fraud, he must now be denounced; by Freeman and his supporters as the enemy of "Catholic schools," and as designing to make them both "moderate" and "middling!" y.i.

How is this 1 We wish our legislators would try to com prehend and answer the question. The reason is, because their blasphemous Popes claim to be the representatives of God on earth, and to have the authority of Jesns Christ to order Icings and govern churches as lie will. And this outrageous claim they make still. On the ground of this claim they/ have dethroned kings, defied parliaments, cursed nations, and released peoples from all ' oaths of allegiance. Therefore no nation is - safe, no people can be loyal, if such claims are acknowledged. But Mews jandi 1 Gentiles of. .every rank, exe'ejiting Papists;1 abhor such claims.

Unfor tunately the religious /freedom which pre vails in Scotland,/ and which is not an outcome from the teaching of Popery, permits Popish, priests to set up their claims and open their ' sedition shops with out let or ; hindrance: , ' / /Unfortunately the old laws which -abolished/- Popery out, of the land, and forbad Papists to preach the claims of the Pope, have fallen into such obscurity that the Pope can dare to ignore them; with ;tkat impunity /of. which Romish slanderers; are: : always alleging Scottish Prptestantismas incapable. But the people of . Scotland ,, have . so . ;.iong enjoyed the liberalizing spirit of Protestantism, ; arid have/so deeply learned/ to ' respect the con sciences of / othrirs that, in ! spite of their ' ;Cqnyiction,tbat;.Popish,bishpps;are;vteach- ers ,of; .lies,- and , Popish , priests the sowers of sedition,, they raise/ no cry of alarm, /as the people of England did wlien a hier- archy from Rome was set up, but simply look on with both scorn and pity. It was becoming that tlie people of England should be alarmed' 'and excited/ and show their alarm iri Durham letters , arid EccIe- : siastical tit! e3 bills, because . the . ;;Refor ina- tion in England ;had left a large portion of the spirit of - Popery both, iii' Church and State; but .in, Scotland the Reformation was ' totally different ; so much so, //that while the Scottish people hate. with a perfect; ' hatred the - very appearances, of Popery, they are far more composed arid possessed/ in/ tbeir very safety,, when a . ship load ' of 'Popes'/" /blessings/ "cardinals' hats, recl , beads, olcl bones, old rags and f ney/sUk,..and pther .-baubles/ from ; Rome .arrive .for ; the setting up, of, .Popish; shops, than the people of /England were; in/similar . /cirpumstances/'/ The Pope and/his/.

But they make ri'i mistake. ' The spread of- therP6pish"Uhurch; in Scotland is not/ growth, /but diffusion; . - It is not that the Scotch are_turning Papists, but that Papists, have - long ; jfound out/, that Scotland; is/a better country than Ireland. Tliey "find that iridustrv 'thriyes bett'er in a- heretical ' country than in / the land of saints.- They: find that however fine fit is -.to'i sing. - billadsrj /about the beauties of .'/ould , Ireland " they are better away from it than in it. Hence swarms of them cross the channel every year/ about the harvest time; and never return, be cause "heresy" is more considerate of them than the " true faith." These- swarms have settled in all the greater cities, as well as scattered themselves through the country parts ; and the consequence is that " the foreigners" and their children are now a difficulty and a danger in Scotland, like the Chinese in California, or the same Mongolians in Queensland. Take Glasgow, for example, it is nearly a third of Irish and their. Scotch born children j and so its statistics of crime, of poverty, and ignor ance are a reproach which is constantly being thrown in the teeth of Scotchmen ; and the pauper institutions are so monopo lized' by the Irish, that asylums and infirmaries are almost exclusively Irish, supported by Scotch. Edinburgh in a less degree proves the same fact. Dundee still more, and other places in proportion to the openings for "unskilled labour." "Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that priests and chapels and convents and crimes have increased in Scotland. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that need has been felt for bishops and car dinals in Scotland, to govern these masses of ignorance and superstition. We confess that we have been astonished that Pius was so long in asserting his claim to gather up the chief pauper and criminal classes of Scotland, as the sheep of his fold. But now that, < he has done so we trust that the Scottish people will be all the more careful to persecute the Papists by teach ing, their own people what were the prin ciples by . which John Knox made the- country what it is. We advise this perse cution. We counsel the Protestant clergy to. teach their people, and especially their young: -people what are the essential differences " between Protestantism and Popery, and what - are the Scriptural ' proofs that Popery is that " falling way " which dishonours God and ruins souls.

Paul preferred to remain that he might be of use to the brethren rather than depart for his own advantage ; therefore, like the Apostle , Papists submit to the death of Pius and resolve to pray for the repose of his soul, that as soon as possible he may be de livered from Are and get safe into the arms of his blessed Redeemer ! Such frightful handling of the Word of God cannot but breed, iu intel ligent men, contempt for religion. As well might the Jesuit have said, " Paul was in a strait as to what would be best ; therefore, like the Apostle, the priests are iu a strait as to which is best — whether to mock God or deceive tbeir fellowmen for the sake of gain ! We hope that Father Kelly will yet be in a "strait;" and that that will be—whether tofadhere to the Ultramontane infatuation of Pius IX., or to adopt the altered policy of the regime of his successors. No doubt, he will then be very " like the Apostle." But we tell him before hand that his preference will not be on the principle which the Apostle accepted. He will evidently prefer not that which is patriotic, but that which is selfish. Italy's New King. — As soon as the official intimation of the death of Victor Emmanuel was made, his son, Prince Humbert, published the following proclamation, in which he avows that lie will be faithful to the policy of his late father, and maintain the crown and throne of united Italy at all hazards: — "Italians, — The greatest misfortune has suddenly befallen us. Victor Emmanuel, founder of the kingdom of Italy and its unity, has been taken from us. I received his. last sigh, which was for the nation ; his last wishes were for the happiness of his people. His voice, which will always resound in my . heart, bids me to vanquish sorrow, and indicates my . duty. At this' mqment'thereqs only one consolation— namely, to show ourselves worthy of < him— I, by follow ing' in his , footsteps, and you by remaining; ;dev'oted to : those civic virtues by -the .aid .of. which he accomplished the difficult task of ren dering Italy. _ great and . united. , I shall be iiuiu.ii.ui in ms jjruiiu example ol . uevonou to country, love of progress, and liheral institu- 'tions, which are the. pride of ray house.. My sole 'ambition will be to deserve the love of my people. Italians, your first king, is .dead. His successor will prove to you that institutions do not die. Let us unite, in this hour of great sorrow; let us strengthen, that concord which has always been the: salvation- of Italy. " After wards the new king reviewed . the1 troops, and -was received with the utmost enthusiasm. So that the hopes of : the- clergy that a revolution : would take place with a vieWjto the restoration of the Pope's temporal power have fallen below -zero.: '' ' '
