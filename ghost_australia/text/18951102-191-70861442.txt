Mf word has always been as good as my bond, and when I subscribed my name to the Cairns Political and Progresss Association, I did so fully reoognising the im port of my action, and thoroughly resolving to stand ot fall upon the result. By that pledge I affirmed my intention of supporting the eleot of the Labour Party, a course which I intend to strictly follow.
