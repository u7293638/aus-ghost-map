A SUPPOSED PHANTOM. To the Editors of the Armidale Express. Gentlemenâ€”I am not afraid of the de parted, nor do I fear the livings-provided they assume a human shape. Sauntering along the principal street in the city, and when only about 100 yards from the Court House, the centre of the town, at nearly 10 on a dark night last week, my progress was rather abruptly impeded by the sud den appearance of something white, which to my vivid imagination seemed to belong to other than the spot which it occupied. Flight was my first thought, but I aban doned the idea without knowing why. " What was it ?' " Where did it come from ?" " Where was it going to ?" were questions which I felt inclined to put, but dared not. I cautiously lifted my hand to my head to readjust my hat, as my locks, generally smooth, were gradually approaching an upright position. I stam mered out, " Who are you ?' and breath lessly awaited an answer in vain. The longer I gazed at the object, the larger it apparently became. At last it moved, and to my great relief I discerned that the cause of my perplexity was a white cow. Now, Messrs. Editors, how much longer are the streets of this Cathedral city of ours to be devoted to grazing land for stock ? If for an unlimited period, it is to be hoped that those who use them for their " milkers" will endeavour to procure dark-coloured animals instead of those of a ghost-like hue. Trusting the Inspector of Nuisances will not receive as great a fright as I did, in the execution of his duty, I remain, yours &c.;, NEW CHUM.
