It is the duty of assisting at the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass on the Sundays and holidays of the year. This is aprecept of the strictest obligation, binding under the penalty of mortal sin all the faithful who have an opportunity of complying with this great duty of religion. In thiB city, where there are several Masfces eveiy Sunday, as well as in othter missions of the diocese, the faithful Mjoy this opportunity, and conse- . quently can never be exempt from the obtigauonof hearing Mass on Sundays, unless prevented by sickness, or some othergnve eause* In other parts of the diocese, where the 'faithful cannot hate Massevery Sunday in their own respec tive churches, they are obliged to aanetiff'the day by prayer, piotta readingj ^'^her rtligiotispractices, fdr the Wordi oF the decalogue are addressed to all jfithout exception—" Remember that thou.lceipphblythe Sabbath Day." We entreat you, therefore, dearlybeloved, never toforget this great obligation. Parents should, on those days especially, instruct their children in tne catechism, and by their own good example bring them up in the fear of God and knowledge. of religion. . Let them be instructed as to the nature and efficacy .of the. Holy Sacraments, and especially asto thegreat sacrament of the altar, in whiqh we adore the realpresence of the body tuid,blood, soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ. We recommend that the Bosary of the B.Y.M. be dev<ratly - recited,- not only on Sundays)~bttt on all days in Lent, by" the members of eaoh fail for this purpose. By this piotts practice you will inspireVour children with a loving veneration for the Blessed Mother Of God, and, under the protection of her whom the Church calls the refnge of sinners and comfortress of the afflicted you and your children may expect to obtain from her Divine Son all the graces necessary for your salvation. Teach your children by your own example the great duty of prayer, bearing in mind these words of our Saviour —"Where there are two or three assembled together in My name, I am in the midst of them." Pray, not only for 'ourselves and your children, but pray Jor your enemies; pray for the conversion of sinners; pray for peace and concord amongst Christian kings and nations; pray for the welfare of the Church; and especially for our Most Holy Father Leo XIIL, persecuted as he now is, and has been for many years by the open enemies of God and religion. Unite your prayers now to those of the faithful throughout the Christian world, and, no matter how great may be your trials and afflictions, you will to a certainty obtain assistance and relief. "Ask, says our Divine Bedeemer, " and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you."—St. Matt..vii., 7. But, dearly beloved, whilst attending to pfayer and the other great duties of religion,' you must not fail to manifest the greatest zeal for the .education., of the rising generation. Christian parents : are bound to give their children a virtuous and Christian •education. This is a truth so selfevident'that it carries immediate con' liqtioin'tb 'the mind. They should educatbthem, nbt for tlris miserable world otflyr'btft they should educate themfor Heaven.-.' It is not enough to provide them, i .jrith food and raiment, and to estahluh them in the world, their Bupernatural/.welfare must be provided for ,also,so; that , they may be- disposed to .answertheond for which' the Almighty created : them^ ' and . that end is the - eternal "enjoyment of Himself in Heaven. . .It is strange, dearly beloved, that' truth's so manifest and, self-evident as these are, are so little attended to by many.', unhappy parents, I Oif 'ihem we may jnstly .complain in the /language of, St..Paul. "If any man," : «ay4 the apostle, "Jiave not care of his ovto, and especially of thoseof-his house, he hath denied ^ne ri futh^wd\\{s l wSrSe than anl infidel^ Iri'^hftfr'Words .there is no '^Spirit'Godthrougtiitemotith of '^kWw?'t-J ^wefpie, j. .JteMBipt^aipiliesi Vfeo neglect jthe moral direct opposition;• to. the Divinej «theiholyj -wlifeion ' they ) profess - "Whitit ^the manifest Criminal 1 ftflift&«fit& IbJ the eternal wt&f;&reMJheir.children; they betray the causeof God, and clearly^how their souls.

It.were better for him that a millstone were about his neck, and that he were cast into the depth of the sea."—St. Matthew xviiL How many woes, then, will be pronounced on the Jast day against those fathers and -mothers who scandalise their children, and-who, instead of endeavouring to save their souls by good example, plunge them, by bad example, into eternal ruin. Wherefore, dearly beloved, we exhort you with all our zeal, not only to edify vour children by your own good example, but also to impart to tbem a sound, moral, religious education. What will become of them when they growup if they shall have no religious principles to direct them P Corrupt nature, the inheritance of our firstparents, will lead them to sin, bad example of ^ Other vicious children will hurry them into it, and education without religion will complete their misery/ Send your children, therefore, tothose schools where religion is taught—where they will receive not only that instruction that will fit them for the world, but also that moral and religious instruction necessary for their salvation; Enable your pastore, by your generous offerings, to support your own schools. This is a duty that fGod demands of you, and for which 'you will have to render a . rigorous account at a future day. You will risk thp salvation of .your children if you send them to schools from which religion is excluded and where they are forbidden tomention the adorable name of Jesus—" Blessed for ever be His Holy Name." Do not, therefore, be so cruel to your children, who are so dear to you, being a part of your own flesh and blood, as to expose them to the danger of losing in those Godless schools that priceless gift of Divine Faith which they received at baptism. If you do, what answer will you make to Jesus Christ when he will put this question to you on the last day —What nave you, done with those children whom I purchased by My blood, stamped with the seal of baptism, and eilriched with the choicest gifts of Heaven P Give them back to Me adorned with that robe of purity and innocence with which they were invested when I consigned them toyou. Where are they nowP They were formerly purp and holy, the; living temples of the Holy Ghost, but now I repudiate them, now I know them not ; for, notwithr standing their former purity, they are this moment so many dens of unclean spirits. They were formerly the objects of My love, they are now the victims of My wrath and indignation. Oh, unhappy parents, you have destroyed the faith of your children by the bad education you gave them, xou have destroyed in their souls the efficacy-of the Grace of God, and the merits of your Saviour's sufferings. Ton are, therefore, accountable to God for the blood of your children, whom you have spiritually murdered. Wherefore, dearly beloved, that you . may escape this apalling calamity, we entreat you with all our zeal to attend to this important duty that we have so strongly laid before you. : See that your children and all those entrusted to your care receive that education that will enable them to lbve God • above all things, and their neighbour as themselves. By this means you will have every reason to hope that you and yoar children shall be united .for ever in the enjoyment of the :beatific vision of God. As regards the Lenten Fast, we need scarcely remind you that it has been observed in: the Church from the time of the ftpoatles. ' You-are now invited to make,atonement to God for your ,8in8 i by Saving, and works of penance.. The Church now speaks to you in thewords of .the Prophet Joel, ii.,12 .-—" Turn to Me;in-fasting, mourning, and -weeping, •and 'rend' your hearts and not >youfc garments."

Young people under twenty-one ears of age, also old people, and those ho are suffering from siclcness, as well s persons subject to hard labour, are xempt from the general law of fasting. In consequence of this great relaxation n the law of abstinence, we again most earnestly exhort all the faithful of the diocese to attend during Lent most asiidubusly to the duty of prayer, to ecite, daily the Holy Bosary of the B.V,M>, to meditate .on tilepassion, and death of our Divine Lordj topray for the welfare of the Church and of our Holy Father the Pope, and to receive within the Paschal time the Holy Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist. . May the abundance of heavenly, graces be bestowed upon you-all, and the peace of our.Lord Jesus Christ remain,with you for ever.—^Amen. : <$i Mastik, Bishop of Sandhurst. ; Given at our episcopal residence, St. Lilian's, Sandhurst, 7th February, 1889.
