REV. CHARLES CLARK'S LECTURE. The Rev. Charles Clark delivered his last lecture before an audience which again fairly filled the Opera House last night. It was Charles Dickens without comment. The celebrated " Christmas Carol" was delivered on the lines arranged by the author himself when giving the story from the platform and needless to say, the conversion of Old Scrooge from miserly hardness to genuine kindliness of heart was told in a May the master would have delighted to hear. Mr. Clark kept his audience for two hours without a break in the spell. It speaks well for Brisbane that Christmas could be celebrated in June, and that a ghost story should hold its own against so many counter-attractions. Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim, Scrooge's nephew, the ghost, and Ebenezer E Sqrocge himself, all lived once again and if any of the audience had not read the " Christmas Carol there are such people-their introduction to the story was something to remember. Tears and laughter were close together. Scrooge on Christmas morning, and the happiness he wrought, were the me enough for Mr. Clark at his best, and his farewell lecture was Dickens indeed. At the close, when the hearty burst of applause had subsided, the reverend lecturer thanked his audience of last night, and of previous nights, for their spontaneous expressions of appreciation. In saying farewell, he could not but feel regret that in all probability he would never see Brisbane again ; but to the old friends who had welcomed him so warmly once more, and to the new friends he had made, he would promise the heartiest remembrance. Thanking the Brisbane people again for their hospitality and genuine kindness, he would say, in the words of Tiny Tim, " God bless us, every one."
