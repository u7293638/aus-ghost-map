CHEATING THE UNDERTAKER. It is so very seldom that a man dies and comes to life again a short time afterwards that when a startling fact similar to this does occur it is generally worth chronicling. It seems, according to tho Colac Observer, that a man named Samuel Talbot, a laborer, re siding in Colac. becoming suddenly indisposed, the services of Dr. Rae were called in, and after the usual medical inspection the man was ordered to bed, and the doctor departed to obtain the necessary remedies. While away a message was sent to him that Talbot had suddenly shuffled off this mortal coil ; and believing the statement to be true, though somewhat surprised, he drew out the necessary certificate stating the cause of death. The friends of the supposed deceased man immediately took the necessary steps for the funeral, the undertaker and the registrar ol deaths having been informed of the mournful event, and no doubt chuckling at the thought that business in their line was looking up. In the house where Talbot was laid "straight out upon his bed,", was gathered a number of women, and mourning and lamentation could bo heard, tho friends weeping for the poor man, and would not be comforted. When lo ! Talbot opened his eyes, and stared around him with marvellous surprise at the scene which was being enacted in his house. Of course, the women screamed, and covered their faces, forming all manner of thoughts about ghosts, aud it was afterwards found that Talbot had merely swooned away, and had been in a sort of trance for a number of hours. Tho undertaker was compelled to desist making the coffin, the registrar destroyed his certificate, and the doctor indulged himself with a hearty good laugh. Tbe joy of tho friends can, of course, be better imagined than described.
