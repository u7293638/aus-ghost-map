NOTES AND COMMENTS. / IN SANDHURST. A little too far, perhaps, down the main street of Sandhurst there is a very imposing building-a long and lofty Grecian fugade, a noble entrance, and a general appearance of solid prosperity To what purpose is that dedicated a asks the visitor approaching and presently reads with no little surprise The I Free Library and School of Mines and In dustries ' This seems good indication of a. steadfast resolve to make liberal provision for the industrial and intellectual side of life, and on closer inspection it proves to be just as good as it looks It is a large and a comprehensive institution It combines instruction with amusement Melbourne folks will understand it better by imagining the Public Library and Picture Gallery, and Athenaeum, and Work- ing Men's College, first cut down into Lilliputian proportions and then rolled into one I The Sandhurst institution opens from the main vestibule into a very pleasant octagonal library and reading room where books are i distributed to subscribers, where they may also be read. to the left is the newspaper and a magazine room of the subscribers, to the , right a free newspaper and reading room for those who cannot afford to be subscribers An excellent idea this of the free reading room, and to be commended to the notice of the trustees of our own Public Library Tor they also have a very extensive clientele, who apparently cannot afford to perform many of the ordinary obligations of life who have little difficulties about soap and towels, and shoe strings, and buttons and scissors and razors It is told indeed, that these habitues of the Melbourne Public Library have very queer difH culties in connection with their tonsonal arrangements One of them was missed for a day or two from insanity corner " What happened to him asked a friend, and the reply was " He made t seen a razor or a pair of scissors for more than two years, and afraid they would run him in for vagrancy He didn't like to walk fifty) miles up country and get the hearer to do it for him, so he just gammoned drunk, and got a week, and will be here again to morrow " 'j here are not many of that stamp however, even in the free reading room at Sandhurst The reading room and libraries are but a small part of the institution. The talk is of the schools Seven hundred pupils are receiving instruction in these schools seven hundred paying pupils-and in addition to these there are the thousands who pick up crumbs of knowledge as they stroll through the museums Here, as in Ballarat, j oaths and men are to be seen hailing from all the colonies learning in the most practical fashion the sciences of geology, mineralogy, chemistry, and metallurgy, labouring away at the furnaces, the laboratory benches, or with the Dloiv pipe at the gas Here also are lads learning the handicrafts of carpenter), engineering, carving, metal working learn ing, that is, to be in the true sense craftsmen and not mere cogs of factory wheels, Here, a step higher, are boys and girls, and indeed men and women, learning drawing and painting in all their branches Church windows and engine wheels, plans of batteries and bunches of daisies, Venus of Milo and brother Tommy. head, are amongst the copies, and there is one little innovation here in the art section which seems like the beginning of the end of the difficulty about artist's models. ' I try to teach them all to draw from life, says the instructor, to get them to oblige each other by standing, and to bring their little brothers and sisters, we may (yet educated models in that way some day Only when one looks up to that recumbent lady with the butter flies, which once graced the French court of the Centennial Exhibition, and understands the extreme length to which art requires her votaries to go, it seems doubtful if many of them will be inclined to persevere Drawing to be of any use however, must be drawing from life, or from originals in some sort and it is encouraging to see the Sandhurst School following in this respect the ideas of the best modern teachers. It is notable, also, that agricultural chemistry finds a place in the curriculum of the college and somewhat deplorable that this chair is vacant through the resignation of Dr Burg harris, who has been appointed to the newly established School of Mines at Castlemaine V line a buzz and clack and clatter there is within the many rooms of the great estate hammers when in the evening hours it is all busy! A half-dozen lecturers are talking and a hundred pens and pencils are busy below lathes are spinning, wheels flying round, white hot crucibles Ititi from the furnaces , saws planes files hammers are busy, and by the odours abroad it may be known that the chemical operations are in full blast It is no mean institution now, and from the building operations in progress it will certainly be much larger by and by Nearly completed is a very large lecture ball, with close rooms (or teachers' theatres) attached, and in continuation of the main tug side there is a three story building with a tower, which will provide accommodation for many students Thousands in a tolerably near future, probably more students in the Industrial College of Sandhurst than in the ancient universities of Oxford or of Cam bridge thousands of the children of the workers of the land entering in by open doors to all the course of the place of learning A marvellous development truly and progressing similarly now throughout the British world Little doubt, indeed, that this is and will be the great college of the future, and good as great in most ways But how foreign how far removed from the old idea of cloister, grove, and hall I Must we not remember that while this i en idea grows and develops and premises by and by to illuminate the whole world, the old idea has its claims, its uses, no less than its privileges and tradi- tions? We should hardly expect to meet the shades of Pluto or of Verulam, or Sophocles or of Spenser, wandering here, and this world of ours would perhaps be appreciably poorer if those dear ghosts should take a final departure To turn for a moment, however, to the gentler side of this institution there is pleasure in a peep at the picture room we cannot SO for, a ly gallery, where the nucleus of a collection is now badly bestowed The Sandhurst people have subscribed a little amongst themselves, and their subscriptions have been supplemented by some Government assistance as I taking advantage, of the Grosvenor and International 1 the Dillons, the) have secured a few good pictures 1 notice to instruct the trial of tinted south that there is something more an art than is set forth in advertising almanacs, and to cheer the men of larger ex- perience whose lot has been cast in the inland city, with scraps at least of the beauties which once surrounded him. All honour to the cultured and enthusiastic people who laboured to bring this little collection together And surely there should be, much sympathy with them in their hitherto unavailing effort to get a suitable building for their display Surely this is a matter in which, in these times of surpluses, the Government might aid and if money is available, there must be good at nee enough in the community to get over the little difficulty which exists about the site Cannot the ban throat folks take a leaf out of the Ballarat book and mise an art pavilion in their gardens Two or three thousand pounds would suffice Dryness light and security against fire are the only essentials, and if the world looked bare for a while the gardener could very speedily clothe them with Icnmi Money money however, is their one want 1 or college and for laboratories, for teachers and for art galleries we are crippled and Btultifie 1 Mr Lillie MacKay the curator, declared for want of money, and there of course, begins the old argument of the provincial humans against the metropolis It is too tone and tedious to enter on seriously, and besides there is no possibility of finality in it, for you would no sooner get the dis fetched between Sandhurst Bay, and Melbourne adjusted, than a half dozen other dalma would be brought forward from ns main) townships or villages around But it may surely be said that there are certain lines along which, in good times, wise administrators might well be liberal, and two at least are those of technical education and art instruction and encouragement Both make for good in every. 1 he) tend to develop good citizens in the broadest sense, to make finished craftsmen, thoughtful and perceptive men and women content because appreciative, industrious because all their labour has been made artistic But in making endowments of this sort some care is required, and there seems not a little danger just now of state funds being wasted through a too wide distribution With schools of mines and industries at Ballarat and Sandhurst, and possibly at Melbourne, and Borne centre in the North Eastern district, it seems that the colony should be very well provided But it is now seriously proposed to establish other schools in at least half a dozen other localities left) institutions they must ever be with inadequate appliances and incompetent became poor) paul teachers for how can anything like a staff be maintained on an income of £400 or £000 a year ' A few votes may be captured probably by promising such amounts, but these are not [ times when Ministers need sacrifice evident duty to the exigencies of official existence
