I TUUItSDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1878. | Since the departure of the last monthly mail for England, we have had stirring times in our political world. At the period referred to the conference between the Houses of Parliament on the subject of reform had just terminated in total failure. The two committees had reported that they could find no common ground whereon to negotiate. All hope of accommoda- tion having been thus apparently swept away, in accordance, it is believed, with Ministerial intention, nothing remained for the Government but to proceed to the next act of the farce. AVhat this would be had long been announced. From the commencement Mr. BERRY-clearly foreseeing that the Council was not likely to betray its constituents by accepting the revolutionary proposals which he calls"reform"-had expressed a determination to appeal to the Secretary of State for assistance His origil plan of cimpaign was very simp Nothing was necessary but to pa a bill embodying the most outrageo notions of the "Liberal" paity, ai m the e\ent of its bomg tluown o by the Upper House, tako a plcasu tup to England, along with two three of his faithful followers, foi t, purposo of insisting on its being passi by the Imperial Parliament ovci ti heads of the lecalcitrant senatois und thicats of revolution and sepaiatio AU Vient well until the tuno cm foi taking tho last step, when became evident that, howevoi wi ing many of Mi BFRR\ S fullowc might be to talk about embassies av Impenal interference as a means i coercing the Uppei House, they woie I no means v. illmg to give practical eile to then expiessed intentions The were only playing a game of " biag," i which they tu ed so soon as they foun that they could go on without grei nsk of dangci to then own MOWS < interests It is not necessaiy that we shoul heie gi\ e a detailed account of the îeco tion which this ambassadouil piopos, met with in the Assembly Aftei lengthy debate of almost unpaiallele violence, the Ooveinment min iged t secure, by a small majonty, i vote < ¿£5,000 foi the expenses of tin ce con missioneis toEnglind lins majout; small as it was, was only obtained h an earnest appeal from the Chu Secietiry just befoie the divisio was taken, calling upon his followei to lgnoie conscientious objections t the comic proposed, and suppoi then party without îegaid to coi sequences By tactics of this soi the Ministiy escaped defeat, but uctoi undei such circumstances was almost a fatal to the Ministcual scheme as faduii Should this ndiculous delegation eve start upon its travels-and w e shall coi tmue to considei its depaituio anunpo: sibihty untd w o know that it has acti ally gone-the leputation which will g with, it must completely destioy an moial influence it might have had unde othei encumstances It will not g as the îepiesentative of i giea and undivided party, but as th mouthpiece of a Government desnou of retaining ofhee at any cost an of oui} a certain portion of Mi BLRR\ S usual followers Neailj all Mi BLHRA S most influential supporters togethei with the whole of theOppos; tion, have entered a solemn piotes against the mteifereuce of the Impeiia Parliament m the internal affaus of tin: colon}, except at the expiess lcqucst o the colonists geneially But unless th Impenal Legislatuie is to ínteifeie what is tlie good of tin owing av>a; ¿£5,000 on the embass} 1 And i must be lemembeied that it wil not be possible foi oui en\o}s to pie tend that they have the authont; of the people foi îequesting Impena legislation, foi aftei spending months n passing a ltefoim Bill thiou_li the \s sembly by e\er decieasing mijouties w e ha\ e lately been mfoimed that tin Go\ eminent does not intend to seek it1 adoption in England, but simply to as!

STY conti ols hei representatives-is dangerous to colonial liberty and almost intolerable to colonial statesmen He desnes that governors shoidd be like independent constitutional sovereigns, who, Uo nu agines, aro at the beck and eau' of their ministers It will be seen that the hon gentleman ia getting into a slightly illogical position Ho LI inviting ana. depiecatnig the íntcifciuicc of tlio

which u now inpidly appioacbing a penod which will aflbid tomporary rest, has been dig nified, conciliatory, and, if justice counts foi anything in the settlement of human affairs, must pi ove eflective The con feience between the two Houses liavtng closed without arriving at any undei standing capable of sen ing as a basis foi legislation, and the Gov eminent having clear.) expiesscd its deteimutation to send commLssioners to London, it be came necessary for the members of the Uppei House to como to some decision as to the course it was desuable t» pursue m defence of hbeity and good

Secietaiy of Stale to imagine that he w ould be led astiay into immediate action by the ( puUe statements of two 01 thieo dele gates, w ho could say nothing more for themselves than that they iepie3ented a fiaction of a party in the Legislative Assembly of Victona, unless the Uppei House appealed by counsel, as it vv eie, to «uppoit the othei side Then, again, it would have been distinct!)

it was thought bettei to addiess a «?imple manifesto to the Secietaiy (f State, plainly setting foith the facts of the case Ibis veiy tleai and able state paper may be found m an othei column, and we advisedly say that it is impossible with tiuth to deny the judicial impartiality of its aiguments 01 to cast doubt upon the substantial accuiacy of its facts It LS impossible foi us in the limited

"iittoiian politics, to give the Council s statement attentive consideia tion It may be said, of com se, with re0aid to tins deteimutation to addie-s the Secietaiy of State, while abstaining fiom peisonal lepiesentations, tint the Uppei House has stultified itself, as both proceedings aie alike in punciple But, as we said recentl), this is i vciy supeificial view of the cas" "To foi wai d a statement of facts and "views to enable the Societal.» of "State the bettei to decline íntei "feience, is certainly no admission of " his right to mteipose, but to send "delegates aimed with povvei- to nego "tiate, discuss, îefute, admit, oi c.ei "eise discretion of any sort, would " imply to some extent a doubt concern " mg oui own povvei of self government ' But while taking c ne that the cause of ti uth and nghteousness should not suflei fiom the embassy in London tluough any shortcomings on its put, the Council, in puisuance of the idea that a settlement of oui constitutional difficulties should take place on the spot, felt called on to mai e one moie effort to bung about an undei standing Accordingly, on the motion of Mi CUTHBERT-a late membei of the Ben y Government, who quitted hw colleagues owing to the outiageous natuie of then leform pioposals-the Upper House agreed to a series of reso luttons offeung substantial concessions These will be found fully detailed m anothei column Wo need say nothing moie heie to indicate then natuie than that wheieas members of the Councd aie now elcctedfoi ten yeais without lia bihty to dissolution, it is theiem pi o posed that they should be liable to be sent to their constituents by the Govern ment of the day This lecogmtion of responsibility was intended as i return foi certain haimless concessions asked foi with regard to mone) bills -concessions calculated to obviato deadlocks without m any wa) m terfenng with the substantial con tiol now enjoyed by the Assembly over the finances of the country These íesolutions weie îeceivedby the Lowei Chamber last night, bu' the Govern ment, so fai from exhibiting any de3iro to seize the olive branch thus pi offered, contemptuously allowed the House to bo counted out This is the last burnies* day of the session, and it is almost «certain that a similar line of conduct vwiU bo pursued The fact is, the Ministry dud tho " Liberal " party do not want a settlement It pays them best to keep things in disorder, aud until the country is sick of then self seeking tuibulence, this mattet will nevei be arranged They announce, it is tiuo, then- willingness to negotiate, but onl} on the giound tint "finality in " legislation ' be conceded Tins phiaso is a neat one, coined to deceive the people, foi "finality of legislation with them mears nothing moie nor less than tho entno subjugation of the Council to tho Assembly in all thing-, Such a consummation will bo íesisted by the pioperty and inlt,lli_-nco of the countiy to the bitter end Hie political situation in Victona LS so accuiately appreciated by the Sado day Review, in an article on the révolu tionaiy anns and pioceedings of the Ben y Ministry, that wo cannot but icgiet to find such con cet pi émises dis figiued by " a lame and impotent con " elusion ' It is admitted that " the " sovereignty of liumbeis having once boen established, "the woist possible " constitution would be thenceforth " secuio from doteuoiation, ' and that "Mr BLREYS various measuies eithei <( piovide or assume that the numerical " majonty of colonists shall be absolute " masters of the persons and pioperty " of the community It is pointed out that the Attorney Generals menaces foreshadow " an abuse of n une " neal strength which would be worthy " of the French Convention , that "the " unbounded complaisance of the Go " \LR_OR furnishes lum with no pio " tection a_oinst tho wanton and mso " lent threats of a demagogue who is u nominally his Ministei, and that " a " tlneat of biutefoicc as the alternative " of submission is in itself an act of " violence And with these facts before it, what does the Satuulay Review îegaid as the only possible eventu ahties ? " The Lnghsh Government, it obseives, " will soon have to " decide on the issue w bethel it " is worth while to oppose révolu " tionaiy measuies m Victoria It may " be taken foi gi anted that all the " wealth, and almost all the respecta " bihty, of the colony is on the side of " the Lnghsh connexion , but it is out " of tlie question to support the minonty "in a civil wai Theie aie only two " alternatives Eithei the demociatic " faction must bo conciliated by a sub " mission to its demands, 01 a dissolu " tion of the colonial i elation must be " enduied In the inteiest of the " bett« clas-s in the colony, it is pio " bably desirable to continue foi the pie " sent a connexion which ma}, peihaps, " not alwa}S be merel} nominal This is extiaordinuy lan.uage tobe used by a leading oigan of public opinion m the mothei countiy, and pie supposes, we will not say culpable ignorance, but a complete disiegaid of thegeogiaphical and political sunound nigs of the case If this colony weie a sequestered island, and the gi eat bulk of its inhabitants were sinai ting undei the sense of an acute guevance, winch the} had no powei to lemedy them seh es and which the Imperial Go veiinnent refused to lediess, a demand foi separation would be veiy likely to anse, and would piobably bo acceded to, m preference to adopting a policy of coeicion But we have absolutely no political guevauces, and the quail el bot ween the two Houses list }eai, out of which this hollow and fictitious agitation Ins alisen, was a îeisonal one The Mmistiy had seemed the support of a majonty in the Assem bl} bj promising its membeis the io new al of an annual stipend of £300 each and this was íesisted by the Council, partly because the sense of the countr} has nevei }et been taken on the question, and partly because it was submitted to tho Uppei House m a studiously oflensne and un constitutional manuel Not only so, but the principal or0an of the piesent G ivei mnent had declaied that, " in the " opinion of the public, tho expen nient of paymentof membeishad piovcd a f uluie, and the money invested in it had been "a dead loss, while, of the lint Assembly elected upon this plan, it was emphitically asserted that it " is "hue to nothing but the woist m " shncts of a grovelling gieedy spnit, "winch values the opportunities and " poweis of public life only foi the pel " sonal piont which these bung ' Now it has been avow ed by a membei of Mi BLRRY ^ Government that the ann and end of his îefoim scheme is ' to enable the Assembly to put then "hands into the puise in an easy, " accessible, peaceful mannei, exempt alike fiom the check of a Second Chambei and nom populai îestiamt, foi it was an essential featuie of that scheme that money bills should on no account be submitted to a pichicate Thus then, the demand for an óigame and lcvolutionaiy chango in the constitution has not ongmated with the people, and is not the lesult of an} conflict between public opinion and the Upper House, but is solely attn butable to the eagei desne of the ma ,outy m the Legislative Assembly to obtain the absolute control of a levenue of fi\ e millions steilmg, without let 01 lundi ance, to bo followed, in all proba biht}, by the institution of a leign of piofligate coiruption and extiavagance, worth} of the worst ela}s of Louis XIV Thus much foi the political sunound mgs of the case, and it is only necessaiy to make the statement completo by le minding our English cntics that, so fai f loin any legislative obstiuctions having been offeied to the execution of the populai will m this colony, theie has been an actual rivalry among party leaders as to which should be most liberal m his concessions, not meiely to public opinion, but to the capacious and wayward impulses of the people A conservative Administration instituted manhood suffrage, a Mmistiy of mode rate men gave us vote by ballot, another moderate Cabmet thiew open the lands of the colony to free selection, ind secured "homesteads foi the " people ', a " loyal liberal " Govern- ment abolished free ti ade, and set up piotechon, and to the conservatives we owe our system of free, secular, and compulsory education, which was stienu ously opposed by Mi BERRY SO that e^ery Government which has hold office Ins endeavoured to adapt itself to the fluctuating moods of the populai muid, I and tho Legislative Council liai aCteti not as an obstacle to "progress," or id tiogiession, as the case might bo, but as a íestraint upon piecipitato legislation We come now to speak of the geo graphical position of tins colony in re lation to other portions of the empire It occupies a small comei of a continent, the whole of which belongs to and LS being colonised by Gieat Brit un It is cotei minons with two colonies-New South Wales and South Australia which aie rapidly giowmg m popu lation and piospcrity, and which joint!) emit mi 890,000 inhabitants, 01 30,000 mol o than Victona To the north east lies Queensland, with 200,000 people, and to the south is the island of Tasmania with upwards of 100,000 Lach of these portions of tho empire is fcrvidl) lo)al to the Ciown, pioud of its connexion with the mother countiy, anxious foi federation, and altogethei opposed to the levelling policy and anarchical tendencies of the dominant uarty in Victona Both by sontiuient and interest, they would bo stiongly aveisoto the erection of this colony into an inde pendent lepublic, an alien community, and a theatio of penodical i evolutions , foi, although they would be considei able gameis by the large e.odus of capital and intelligence which would immediately take place from hence, yet the peace and order of society m New South Wales and South Australia would be liable to constant disturbance at the hands of then ttubulent and tumultuous neighbouis, and the conversion of Vic tona into a political and social ALsatia oi an Austi allan Mexico, wouldpioveto be anintoleiablo cm se to the loyal and law abiding communities acioss its boideis England has impeiial di ties to perfoim tow aids these, and howevei well dis posed some of hei statesmen may be to wash thou hands of the one colony m which lampant deniagoguism is at once the bane of society, the foe to pi ogress, the îepioach of fice institutions, and the standing tiouble of the Colonial Office, vv o do not anticipate for a moment that the Earl of BE VXOXSI ILLD'S Admunstia tion will di earn of accepting eithei of the "only two alteinatives" which have been suggested by the Saluuüty Henel Mr MUNRO in his deliverance at Carilton may be taken to represent that portion of the Ministerial party which really desires a leform of the Council, and does not w ish lcfonu to degenorate into an election ciy and a meit, factious party stiuggle Hie lion memboi sub mits two peifectly mtelh_iblo piopo sitions The fiist is that the main object of îefonn is to londci the Council molo amenable than it now is to public opinion, anti the second is that leformeis should not fly ofl at a tangent because they cannot obtain all they desire at once The gieat thing is to progress, and to piogiess m the light direction, because one step Oamod íendeis the next stop e tsiei And it is peifectly easy foi the Assembly to mal e highly aatisfactoiy progicss this veiy session, because the Council has sent clown a bill which w uki icndei the Tjppoi House moie amenable to public opinion md which does not c1 um foi that body the exorcise of any new povvei The only obstacle to this valuable íofoim being oflocted is tho Bul lenness of the piofessional pohtici uis of the Liboial part), who íefuse to considei the bill because it niif,ht íemovo the gt lev ance on which thoy ti ade, and undei it the íofoim agitatoi might find his occupation £,one On this point, the following passage from the addiess of the membei foi Cailton may be com mended to the attention of the countiy at laifjC - "There was now on the table of the Legis- lative Assembly a bill to alter the constitu- tion of the Legislative Council He did not refer to the bill bj winch the Council pro posed to nltei the r6th clause of the Consti tutton Act and he wished them to bear that particularly in mind because one of the diuly 1 apers of that morning m a leading atticle confused the two bills together Ile would challenge any man to saj

The experiments have been so far successful that on Tuesday night and last night one of the carrages on the Williamstown line was lighted with gas instead of oil, and ti» superiority of the new si stem as re garda the comfort of passengers wai at once evident The method of providuu the gaa ia by filling a reaervoir placed beneatl the carnage ata very high pressure, but ii the consumption of tho gas the pressure ii controlled bj a regulator, w Inch prev enta it¡ being wasted As the reservoirs in tho dif ferent carnages are not m any way connected with each other, the light would not be ex tinguiahed by the uncoupling of any of the carnages The reservoirs carry a supplj which it ia estimated would last for 30 hour, if necessarj As the cost of lighting the car nages in this manner, after the apparatus ha. once teen fitted up, is very much smallei than the expenso entailed by the use of oil, the Minister intends to gradually extend the ajstcm to all the carriages on the Govern ment railways The proceedings between the Hand and Band Company and the National Bank are getting somewhat complicated.

Slack had been arrested on a warrant directing his imprisonment for two months for contempt of Court. It is contended on his behalf that he had already surrendered to undergo his imprisonment for contempt, and after a few hours incarceration had been re- leased by Mr Justice Molesworth, and there fore he could not be rearrested on the warrant. The order on which his first deten tion took place was not before the Court, as Slack could not obtain a copy of it, and the Court granted the writ of habeas, returnable on Friday morning, so that all the documents might be produced.
