SCENE III. SILENCE no longer reigns. The ?winds, at first so timid, have come forth in all their strength and now shout victoriously through their dominions. Hark! are not the ghosts of the dead races at battle -with the gnomes ? No; 'tis but the howl of the wolf, seated at the mouth of his cave ! Now the snow sits steadily down, and wearily drag on horse and man, heavily lifting their snow-cumbered feet. At last-thank God-at last the shelter of the grove is gained. The wolf is still laugh ing, seated on the rock before his den, but the shelter of the firs is good. The snow cannot come near, but it hastens to raise a wall about the trees, the low, outer branches of which almost sweep the. ground. Grateful is his fire of sticks to the chilled feet of the wanderer. The storm is forgotten while he lumbers. Let gnomes and the ghosts of warriors battle- let the grey wolf laugh on! The lost man sleeps and Ms hungry horse, with his nose in the embers, dreams of the green grass of the lower valleys. The red light of the morning sun burns on the snow and the sleeper awakes. Oh! -sun, mock not with your brightness, for the wall of snow is high. Gazing on it, the heart of the lost man stands still. The snow-laden boughs of his trees are weighed down-they rest upon the encircling drift. What a beautiful fairy palace our lost man has! But he will not look upon or delight in its dazzling walls-he only sighs, and moans and mutters. Whose are the names he speaks ? Why does he not be merry, and sing and dance in his splendid snow palace ? But his hands clasp his knees ; he rocks to and fro. Rising, he approaches and caresses his dumb companion, and the horse lovingly rests his head against his master's cheek. " 'Tis full fifty miles to the valleys, good Dobbin," he says, "and we must be moving." Quite up to the breast of the horse is the snow, as the pair resume their journey. Such is a storm of a single night in the high Sierras.
