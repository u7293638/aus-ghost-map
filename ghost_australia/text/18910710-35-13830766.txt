THE BERNHARDT SEASON IN SYDNEY. "LA TOSCA." Madame Bernhardt appeared for the first time at Her Majesty's Theatre in tragedy last night " La Tosca," the text of which is perfectly familiar hero, was thus revealed in all the dread reality with which tlieunpics_ivoartof this great actress can invest it. It is not too much to say that the audience was pain fully affected by the roprosonUliou No less than this was to be expected Sardou is probably the cleverest, the strongest, of living dramatists, but in such a play as "La Tosca" he shows that he cannot chaston the horror of the chosen subject by the poetic qualities of style which retino Sholloy's masterpiece, "The Corner," to say nothing of the breadth and poetic feeling which raise "Macbeth" so far above any suggestion of melodrama in our opinion Sardou, in that last act in wind Fiona leaps from the battle meats, runs perilously near the melodramatic, and not all the pathos and strange that its method of the Bomhoidt could oblite- rate this impression There is a revolting brutality about " la 1 roses " which cannot be found even in the one wholly unpleasant tragedy which Henrik Ibsen has written We refer to " Ghosts," in which the conspicuous elevation of style sUggests either the classic force in modern form of one of the old Greek dramas than the material realism of our doughty The 1 south vv liver is, however, so truly great in the construction of his plays his story moves on with stops so swift and sure, and he has so largely the gift of keeping pace with the march of thought-imhko Ibsen, who has made the fatal mistake of coming into the world 20 years ahead of his time that we are forced to condone even the unnecessary torture and bloodshed of the third act, and the scene of unparalleled lust and treachery iii the fourth Legitimate objection may be taken to both on artistic grounds, as exciting unnecessary horror in the mind of the spectator, though, as a matter of fact, when Sarah Bernhardt plays the part of Tiona, Sardou s intention has so pbuidy been fixed upon an intensely dramatic effect, and the success is so evident, that his method becomes apparently vindicated We are by no means prepared to go the length of M bartON, who condemned the piece as he fin de tout art, et la mott du theatre" buds stricture could only be justified when proof was forthcoming that the vitality of the drama depends wholly and solely upon the great actress who is now " staining " in it If there is no reason to think this the case, the " death of the theatre " is not likely to result from the production of similar works by the French dramatist, and the end of all art is indefinitely far distant However, as throwing some light upon the question, we shall have placed before us at Her Majesty's theatre during the next fortnight three more (ham is ov olved under the conditions which led to the production of last night's tragedy) The quartet of plays written especially for Mme Bernhardt were produced in Paris in the following order " Fedora," on December 11,82, at the flutters du A'audovilio, " Theodore," on December 26, 1884, "La Tosca," on November 21, 1887, and Cleo prices," on October 23, 1890 the three last at the Porte St Martin The avowed intention of the dramatist to "fit the French actress with a new port in each case has naturally given rise to fresh consideration of the influence upon an author's style and upon the stage in general, of such inventions as are involved in the process of thus writing up to" a particular actor or actress It has been said again and again that onyiiahty or novelty of treatment is impossible under such circumstances, that the probabilities of the plot are too often sacrificed to the peculiarities of the individual, and that, speaking generally), no drama of first-rate value, from the artistic standpoint has been thus produced 1 bore is naturally a great deal of truth in this-how much depends chiefly upon the ability of the author and upon the range of the netorstalont for whom he writes When Mr H J Byron " took the measure" of Mr J L took for "Dearer Than Life" some 20 years ago, it was obvious that the character of Michael Gardner had to be confined within the boundary of genuine pathos or broad humour lins restric- tion may at first appear far from narrow, but those who know Mr Fookes, method and we quote "Dearer than Life" as having been made lately familiar hole-will not fail to have observed that it excludes the portrayal of the stronger passion- Not to multiply instances, we find, us in the case of several widoly-ilifforiiig characters written for Mr Henry Irving, that this long established custom, though always more honoured in the breach than the observance" by no means necessarily implies bad w York or, at any rate, not in those cases in which the actor aimed at is of first-rate power Sardou, in one respect, has been popularly exempt from the trammels of the situation in his dealings with Sarah Bernhardt Her infinite variety is going - ally recognised as her greatest charm, and if we speak. only of those of Sardou s dramas which have already been performed in Sydney, it may be said at once that there is no monotony of idea apparent in the conception of Fedora, the Russian Princess whose powers of wealth and inherited authority oroouiplovcdin the quest for vengeance, and of 1 Iona La Tosca, the successful artist and Bohemian to the very tips of her lingers, who fails into the clutches of the Chief of Police It has to be remembered, however, that baldon has been more than usually bound by the necessity of providing a long part for his favoured and favourite actress He has himself boosted that those plays one intended for export," so to speak, and that as they are w atten for performance in foreign countries, the. must provide for the continuous appearance upon the scene of the great "star," whom, and whom alone, foreign audiences crowd to see When. this additional shackle upon the author's genius is considered, it is impossible to avoid the reflection that the artistic ensemble of of fliioly-couceivod drama such an ensemble, tor of ample, us the same writer furnishes iii "La Patric," with its three great characters must be, and in fact is, sacrificed in order to meet the many connecting conditions under which it has had to be produced But if this is to an obvious extent the case in " La I loved)" and loss perceptibly m " Fedora," yot Sardou's slaU still continues to minimise the evil effects of the system by the masterly nature of his construction " Fedora" may have been written for Born - hardt, but it has become popular in Australia though placed in the hands of artists whose talent has been doomed inferior to her own, whilst in the Hollow Potter production of "La Tosca," it became evident that an actress quite wanting in the tragic strength required for the part was so moved by the polished force and vitality of the second character, that the drama, so rendered, was yet able to achieve lasting popularity amongst our playgoers When we find as in "La Tosca," written for Sarah Bernhardt, as an "Adrieuiio Locouvrour," do Hyrnod for Rachel, as in "Frou Frou," intended for Dosoleo and as in Camille," associated with the name of Mdlle Docho, that the character can be transferred from one famous actress to another, and that the plays themselves endure, we are forced to admit that they have stood well the only test by which they could have been condemned It is possible that Sardou might have written better ploys thon "Fedora" and "La Tosca" without reference to Mme Bernhardt, yet the plays themselves are of enthralling interest Whether as much can be said of "Theodora" and "Cleopatra" Sydney playgoers have yet to learn It must be admitted, however, that the Bernhardt environment proved too much for the author when he sketched the scenario of Theodora The motive of revenge, and the treachery in woman's love by which the passion is satisfied, are the mainsprings of action both in " Fedora " and in the historical tragedy, and the recollection of this may have coloured the view of M Searcey, the famous critic of Le Temps, when he summed up "La Tosca " in the scathing sentence we have quoted above In Sydney both the plays last named have been reviewed and generally accepted upon their merits, and through the medium, in the case of "Fedora" at least, of more than one interpretation Now, at last, one of the nerves has been placed before us exactly u the author intended, or at least as he intended so far as his door character in concerned The verdict passed upon the drama by last night's audience was that it was one of unexampled horror, and, in the hands of Mine Bernhardt, of extraordinary fascination we may shrink from the smell of blood and the taint of cruel loveless line with which " La Tosca " is infected, but we must acknowledge the grandeur of the great artist's impersonation, and, whilst we shudder, how before the genius which can so DU us with emotion. Lost night's crowded house was on the tiptoe of expectation when Floria Tones, after the long dialogue between Mario and Angelo in the opening scene, was heard knocking at the gate of the chapel, and the sound of the now familiar voice heralded her approach In another instant she was upon the stage, dressed in the gay, fantastic style of the Empire, the robes of Bau do Nile green colour, the huge hat with green and rose coloured feathers, and the character, a sure cruteh-handlod rt t, "25 to go Until Madame's appearance the house had appeared listless, though patiently quiet.

It is to the young artist that Angoloth applies for aid on his escape from the Castle of St Angelo, where his Republican sympathies had made him a political prisoner Events must move rapidly on the stage, and Marie passes quickly through the phase of pity to that of friendship on discover- ing that the escapee is the brother of the lovely Marquise whose head he is painting. He hides him in the chapel, and assists him to escape in a foul in disguise, of which, unfortunately, he leaves behind his sister's fan emblazoned with a tell- tale coroner Here, then, we have the dramatic elements of the tragedy which the jealousy of La Tosca is to put in motion Mme Bernhardt hero was especially charming, The childish petulance with which she takes Monro with a penchant for the Madonna, w horn who spitefully describes us " red-haired," was a delicious piece of corned), and the lovers formed a pretty picture there on the raised platform, sho cooing in his our like a gentle affectionate love, and he toying with the pretty hand that rests m how I Quickly the story brings us to the darling salon of the Public Purpose, where the costumes were all singularly nell and the colours well contrasted more jealousy is still the keynote to the situation, and we see Scarpia playing upon the strings of that foolish heart with a master hand, and have opportunity of riding mg the great variety of expression by which M.
