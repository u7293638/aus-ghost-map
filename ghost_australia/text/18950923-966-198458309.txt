(Ertckct. SENIOR CI.UBS uurnsa INTO FOEM. [By FOIST.J All the seven clubs whica comprise the South Australian i^ricketiujt Association, hue held their annu il meet.iigo, and jcVtral u. ttieiu have airsa<iy indulged lu their preliminary iiipe.opener*. The cuiniug se-.s»n is antii itiated witu iw little interest. 1 liere will be 110 Kiiglloll c.l >ven t < distract e-iiliuaiastn, ai.d ttie matches which will take place ou tbe Adelaide *nd Kensingtuu Ov&Uoughituereft;>.e to attract mure notice .han thev did last -e&fcou;, whan, owing te pressure or iutera&tiuDal; anil intercolonial matches, the senior teami atone purioil ot the 6easen «ere not engaged fur over a j.ontM. Many new fac»K will appear amongst the se tiur>, alltheciub b ^ecreta r ieshaving bonatwurk during the winter cr>ing to pick up new uiec, with a apeuiaily keen eye >H>en .->11 the while for hungers, i'riais of tho new mea »re uuw beinj; ma-le in matches agaitttt the leading junior ciub?. Several games Mere plared on muroay afierno.m, and strolling almost from one end it the riouth Park Linda to the other I was aDle to see a good ileal of ciieket. Tht cold wind which blew was none too pleasmt for cricket, yet 'be vast green field »ii siiDuly alive with men and lads in white flannels. Uiie turned with special interest to the nam* between the Noith Adelaidtts aud the Kainhlers, because Oariacber, tbe much taleed-of bowl, r from the Scnth-)•:asi, was participatijin. Cet'iuger, wuen h- won tb« tosa, put the Kamblers in, su that ha might see (ftrracher trundle. The iiouthbasiernxr is fine, wel-set-up young fellow. Ue buwls left arm, wiib a nice easy delivery. I had understood that his pace was no more than medium, but on Saturday he bowled at ab <ve in- iuin pace—perhaps it was the extra pare which caused his length to ba too short—anyhow ho bowled better when bs sent down olowar halls. Bnt there is pleii'y of lime "efore the sexaon start- f>«r him to get his arm into its proper swing, which he could not expect t<> do on his becond (lay out. Tbe Oambem exhibits<l some cipitai batting. After seeing the lit he K. G. Phiilius set full sail snd picturesquely catch a man (who, by-the-way, g t.ve up the ghost when he saw to whom tha ball w»s going), I wanilored westward* until ( reached' the ground where the ."South Adelaides worn playi.ig i hf South ITuiteds, just in tiina to ' <-ee Jones root out the leg-stump with an irresistible yorter. It was with feelings of regrat thai one s<iw the brothers Hack—B. J. aud F. T.— playi'iiii wi'h the ju lor team, and the ret!ograde utep they have taken must be recrc>ted by ovary one who is anxious to senior cricket progress, l'be cider brother, Bart, altliooah somewtiat unsuccens- 'uliasneasoii,ha-g'»fn ample prom seofdsve.oping into a top lawyer mnougHr. batsmen, while a lid who can play Jones as his young brother did ou Saturday is worth a place iu any t>val team. A c-iu'ile of hundred yar.N \?ay the Norwoods made inincemr-at of a we^kish Middles.x. tea^u. 'i'be gams was remarkable only for the low scoring of tbe junior team, the really first-cass citching, aod the excellent bow ins averages of tba Norwoods, Holt's fUures readme 60 balls, 7 m idens, S runs, and 3 «eicke m. At rsturt <he previous weak 5 >lt secured 4 wickats for 4 runs, so that he has taken fuil advantage of the ear.y lorm of batsmen. Of course I was unable to get to Sturt to se« the Adelaide^ olaying, but uae is gl&d; to he-ir that fleoree Giffe i obuiued an excellent bowling avara.ee. Tne tittle finger of his tight hand, which Lockwond maimed early in tne last lest match, is aii 1 of abnormal size, anti the crat-k f K t h a t the joint may never ba quue right again, but ha anticipates uo serious inconvanienceto hii bowline.
