THE BLOOD-STAINED RING. Sir,— The prize ringwithall its barbar ous, filthy and depraved associations has again been filled with combatants fight ing almost to death for money, and for the delight of a demoralised section of the people. News that Gladstone had given up the ghost, or that the Irish had gained Homerule, or tllat Queen Victoria had determined to withhold the Royal Assent to the Slavery Bill in Queens land would not have caused a tenth, or perhaps, even a fiftieth of the interest that was shown this morning by depraved white youths, when information reached them that a big, burly and blood-thirsty blackfellow had, after a fierce battle, beaten another burly man of blows— a ' white ' fellow — into an unconscious mass of bruised humanity. .That foul and fcetid taste of depraved whites which cannot be roused to feel inspiration on any worthy and unselfish cause was stirred to the depths this morning when it became known that one man had taken advantage of the strength given him by an abnormally healthy parentage to batter almost to death a fellow man of nearly equally ' fortunate ' extraction, and in their hearts these beasts in human shape doubtless felt all the fierceness of the gory delight of the savage brute that has seen blood and tasted it. ' The infamous prize ring would be sufficient in itself to stamp the laws of a country permitting it, as barbarous, demoralising, and devilish. The man who fiehts to a finish for money is a full-blooded black guard, and he who takes sufficient interest in such vile ' sport ' to look upon his pet . champion as a demi god — and many do— very little better. — I am, &c.;, REFORMER.
