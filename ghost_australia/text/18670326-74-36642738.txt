The 'British Quarterly opens with an his torical resum6 of " Froudo's Reign of Eliza beth." The next article is on "TThe Chinese Classics," which are in course of translation and publication at Hong Kong, by Dr. Legge. Of the 7 vols. to be published, 3 have appeared. The first of these contains the Confucian Dialects, the Great Mein, and the Doctrine of the Mean; the second the Works of Mencius; the third, in two parts, the Shoo King, Se. "The. Shoo King," or Book Classic, is a collection of historical documents said "to lia'e' ben airranged by 'Confucius. There is a narrative portion prefixed to most of 'the books of which. it is composed; but this generally consists of only a few words, rarely of more than a single sentence, and Di.' Legge thinks these short preflatory no tices may have been the work of the com piler.. The vastly;largerportion of thie classic is made up of speeches addressed by emperors to'their ministers, and vice versa, and some times by an emperor to' his people. Dr. Legge doubts the statement generally assumed to be correct as to Confucius being the com piler, and lie discusses the question of author sliip,, 'nd that of chronology, with a pains taking research which extends along the whole course ,of' Chinese. literature. This classic is the great fountain whence Confucius and' Mencius drew many of their favorite thoughts and most of those examples which they maintained all should seek' to imitate, if they wished to attain to high intellectual and moral excellence. The lofty pretensions made 'by his disciples on behalf of Confucius were never put forward by himself; hie always disclaimed originality as a teacher. "I was not, born with knowledge : I loved the ancients, and seek it in their books." "I am a transmitter, and not a maker; I believe in and 'love the ancients."' Confucius was very. far , from being of an enthu siastio temperament; but his admiration of the ancients was intense. Mencius, too, wiMl unsparing in his praises of these paragons lof wisdom and virtue; none but Confucius could hope to equal them; and nothing remained for other men but a distant .and heemble imitation. In Chinese estimation SMendis comes nearest to these realised ideals . of. exceilence. .' . . . Of these two celebrated men Dr. Legge has given as minute 'accounts as' we amt well'hole to' ob tain..... ....Dr. Legge' view of the character of Confucius is not a very flatter ing one: "I hope I have not done hint in justice; . but after a long study of his character and opinions, I am unable to re gard him as a great man. He throw no light on any of the questions which have a world wide , interest. He gave no impulse to religion. He had no sympathy with progress. His influence has been wonderful, but it will henceforth wane. My opinion of him is that the faith of the nation will speedily and ex tensively pass away." . Mencius sways no such sceptre is that wielded by Confucius. Dr. Legge's estimate of himn is higher than that generally adopted among the Chinese. Ho compares him with the mightysmen of ancient Greece; with his con temporaries, Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, Demosthenes, and thinks his in tollectual stature is not inferior to those glorious . representatives of the most in tellectual and civilized communities in Western antiquity.'! Of the general character of Dr. Legge's work, the reviewer remarks: "It will thus be seen how amply the student of Chininse ihtraturti is furnished at once with valuable instruments, aind with instructions how to }sse them. We need scarcely say that the translation is a trustworthy one. The version as a whole is admirable, both for its faithfulness, its perspicuity and for the manly and vigorous English which is em ployed throughout the volumes. If missionaries andotherswho wish to acquire the Chinese language do not make far greater and quicker progress than their predecessors, the blame will certainly not lie at Dr: Loggo's door." Als article of "Ritualism, Past and Present," deals far more with the present than the past. A claim is put in for the in terference of the bishops with the ritualists; but on the other hand it is ahlirned that men should not be restrained from free action in the worship of. God. The law is shown to be against the ritualists ; so also are the Scrip tures. "Persons who wish its to believe that it is religious reverence which prompts them to this folly,` deceive themselves. True rever once for Jesus Christ would show itself in quite another manner. " The New Testament is the will of our Lord-Ilis testamsent ; and how do men show their reverence for the will of the dead I Clearly by doing their best to ascertain what that will really is, and then by carrying it faithfully into effect, adding nothing to it, taking nothing from it. But in place of this; ritualists call our attention away from the last supper as .dispensed by Christ, and pointing to the stage-play of popish mass, they say-' There, that substantially is how the thing should be done.' Reverence ! reverence for the will of the dead I But the proceedings of such me11 betray as much want of reverence for the truth of Christ 11s for his will in other respects. What but a low up prehension of the great facts which constitute the doctrines of the Gospel could allow men to suppose that it is in their power to make those doctrines more clear and impressive by the tawdry milliuiery and the theatrical in ventions which many are now bringing to them ? True reverence, on. the contrary, would compel them to shrink from anything of the sort as from so much proflueation. To expect more devoutness from gazing on a crucifixion than from asacnding imagination the real Calvary, and seeing with the mind's eye the true cross and the living suffvrer, is to concede greater potency to fiction than to fact, to act at the command of men, than to the truth as used by God. In reality there is a childish weakness indulging all such de vices which may lead the feeble into super stition, but which must often drive the strong into scepticism. Hence the scepticism so common, among intelligent men in all Catholic countries." " Shakespeare's Sonnets, never before interpreted; his private friends identi fied; together with a recovered likeness of himself," by Gerald.Massey, is the text book of an interesting article on " Shakespear in Domestic Life." It closes thus : " We have little information respecting the last years of Sllakespeare's life, save that they were prospered and honored. Although no longer personally connected with the stage, 11e still continued to write for it; and11 his fine plays on Roman History, and his "Timon of Athens" belong to this his latest penned. It were greatly to be wished that some additionel information respecting our chief poet might be found; meanwhile, re joiced should we be if these remarks might do some service in resoruing his me11ory front tile unmerited charges so recklessly cast upon it, and aid in proving .that in his domestic relations, the ' gentle Shakespeare,' like the knight of chivalrous romance, was not only above reproach, but beyond suspicion." Miss Whately's " Life lid Correspondence of the Archbishop" forms the subject of another paper. , Her work "is at least a profile, though 'a deeply interesting one." "George Eliot" is next reviewed; her literary charac teristics are described. "Adam Beds" is estiimated as not ranking as a work of art, with such novels as the Antiquary, or Guy Manuering. ' The Mill on the Floss' is the most wonderful literary workmanship we have hall fronl the hand of George Eliot. ' Silas Marner' possesses consummate excel lence as an effort of genius and i1 work of art. ' Romola' is the most unsatisfactory. The judgment of ' Felix Holt' is unfavorable. There is ai long article on "The United States since the war ;" a short touching one on " Bishop Cotton," and another on "Re form." (2o be continued).
