GUNNING. " (From our Correspondent.) TiE sporting part of our community mustered in force on Monday, on the racecourse, to witness the match between Mr. J. Newman's horse Goodenough and Mr. D. Murray's mare Jane. While waiting for the principal event, a race for a bridle was got off, the distance being about half-a-mile; this resulted in a win for Mr. C. Bush's chesnut mare. After a time all preliminaries being settled, the horses matched came to the post; a go'd start was effected, the mare soon taking pride of place. The first mile did not alter matters, and before the second half was run it was plainly seen that the horse was in difliculties; his rider tried at the falling ground to get up, but never had a ghost of a chance. The mare won almost in a canter. After the match some more racing for bridles came off. The first was won by Mr. Thorn's Miss Kingston; the next race fell to Mr. Best's horse Chester; and the last to Mr. Newman's horse Goodenough, who was only just " good enough" to win the bridle, Mr. Grovenor's Kingston coming at the finish and running him for hislife, making a grand race. While Mr. and Mrs. Collet were absent from their house on Monday some fellow made his way there, and, representing that he wanted some meat, gave an order, and then managed to borrow a few shillings from Mrs; Collet's mother, from whom he also got a good dinner on the strength of being whom he represented himself to be. Not satisfied with this he found his way into the kitchen and began pulling the girl about. Mr. Collet came home, and the loafer cleared through the back yard at a run. It is a pity he did not get what he so richly deserved-a good licking or a swim through the creek with a rope round his carcase. We have had a thunder-storm to-day (Monday), with a nice shower of rain, but nothing more than enough to cool the air and lay the dust. Rain is badly wanted. January 24th.
