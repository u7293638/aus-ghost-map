Correnti, Secretary of the elm of rous orders of the States carrying on a black velvet cushion the iron crown of Theodohnd, brought here purposely from the Cathedral of Monza, a diadem enclosing the iron circlet supposed to have been forged with the rails of the crucifixion, first used by the Lombard kings for their coronation, and subsequently usurped by many foreign kings and emperors jet never worn by a king of United Italy before it was produced on the present mournful occasion After the crown followed the Kings war-horse, pacing slowly under the encumbrance of his sable trappings This was followed by a large display of weather heaton Rugs, all bearing traces of the battles in which they had been engaged Then followed a long line of provincial and municipal deputations, of members and trade unions, with mourning fits and eagles and she wolves and other devices and inscriptions, all democratic institutions showing the utmost eager- ness to honour in death the high descended Citizen King, who promoted their interests and befriended their development On the convoy followed the state carriages of the Syndic of Home and other conveyances pressed round by a packed mass of human beings to which there was no end for hours Turning from the Corso, the procession passed through the Piazza of the Collegio jîomano-crammed, like every other portion of the route, to its utmost limits and entered the narrow defile of the street of the Marble Foot Beyond this point the crowd was not allowed to penetrate In the Piazza della Minerva all was silent The windows, the roofs of the houses, every available spot was crowded with eager solemn faces , even the dome of the Pantheon, seen now through the opening it the further corner, had occupants on the summit and on the ledge of the cornice , but the Piazza itself was empty, with the exception of the soldiers lining the route A few moments more it was now 1 o'clock-and the procession came in front of that relic of nobler days and noblest art, despoiled, yet perfect," once part of the Tlhcnio of Agrippa, then the Temple of Love the Avenger and all the gods , later, and still the Basilica of Santa Maria ad Martyres, and now also to become the tomb of Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy, and first King of Limted Italy We move on between the great columns of the portico, strewn thick with box and laurel, except along the carpeted path, and pass from the cool grey of a January morning into what seemed, as it were, a great sphere, where at first nothing was distinguishable but thousands of glittering golden lights In the midst of the glare of lights, an atmosphere of gloom, and beneath " the serious dome," whose "circle spreads a holiness appealing to all hearts," rises the catafalque On a rectangular estrada some 40ft square, and two steps in height, are ranged on pedestals six gigantic candelabra along each side Upon the Estrada and within the lines of the candelabra stands a lofty platform, with slightly inclined sides, and upon it other pedestals with candelabra like those below, their double range of spreading branches carrying on each candelabra a pyramidal group of some 50 candles, and, finally, upon the platform rise from each Bills three great steps, on to the summit of which the coffin will be carried up a flight of 18 steps, forming the ascent on the front, and flanked by a double range of pedestals one above the other, on which he couchant lions But there is one speck of white, clear light in all the golden glare It is from the great circular opening in the summit of the dome, across which a transparency representing the Sill er Star of Italy is seen on an azure field or firmament The edge of the opening-the eye, as it is called, of the dome-is lined with gold bordered black velvet, and from around it hangs a great ermine, or What is intended, and very successfully, to represent ermine, canopy lined with black and edged with gold, and which, opening as it descends, is looped, tent fashion, in eight broad strips up to the higher cornice from which the dome springs, and through the divisions of the ermine the sunk coffers of the great v ault are seen vanishing high aloft, a dream- like vault, for the vapour from the candles makes it all unreal The ends of the broad strips of ermine hang down upon the entablature between the upper cornice and that lower one the columns support, and form, with the equi-distant spaces of will between, a series of panels, on each of which is a shield bearing the arms of one of the great Italian cities, each set out by two of the national flags placed crosswise behind These are illumined by flattened pyramids of candles in regular series around the full circuit of the cornice, and behind them, on that giddy height, there stand, like statues, at equal distances apart along the ledge, men of the Romantics brigade the Visit which dates its institution from Augustus, their uniform and blight brass helmets harmonising perfectly with the gold edges of the h hangings and the colours on the shields I may mention here that the Vigils have claimed the right, which has been theirs for centuries, of closing the dead Sov reign s tomb The WIVIIB of the six great recesses-chapels they are now tailed-which open from the circular area of the building are covered throughout with black velvet divided into panels by lands of gold lace Between the columns of Phrygia and Nunndian marble which supPort the cornice above each of these recesses lang great lamps of bronze-three before each recess lighted with spiritless, their ghostly flames being alternately red and green on each of the altars, alternating with the recesses, are many candles burning ; sach altar is flanked by pedestals bearing lofty candelabra, like those around the catafalque, and the great niche of the Tribune and the opening of the doorway are festooned with hangings of black velvet edged with Cold and cloth of gold edged with black, draped as only the church decorators of Home know how to arrange them. in the recess on the Gospel side of the high altar a spacious orchestra has been erected for the voices of the St. Cecilia and Phil harmonic

Upon the pavement on the Epistle side, but, out on the area. of the floor, and to the right of the upper end of the catafalque, looking at it from the door, are 114 gilt Beats of state without backs, with kneeling cushions of crimson velvet edged with gold lace placed before them', bandstand was ?_____Rplendid carpet of the same material as with two broad gold bands. .

the late severe action at Unuitaiui, in which Cape town, Grahamstown and Port Elizabeth volunteers fought side by side with the ateadmcssofoldsoldiersaganistoverwhehmng odds It seems that our second detachment, with the Grahamstown and Capetown guns and a small number of Capetown rifles, was ordered to patrol eastward of The ka After a toilsome march, diversified by missing their waggons, which

was driven in, a dismounted policeman cut to pieces by the enemy's asse guns, and the Grahamstown gun handled with admirable steadiness, covered the retreat of the cavalry The infantry expected an attack, but a shot or two from the Capetown gun stopped the enemy's advance The main body retired to camp, and began to make things snug during the Sunday afternoon, hardly expecting an attack in the open It was thought well, however, to be ready, but our poor tired fellow a hoped for great long enough to allow of lations being served out and cooking fires to be lighted At half-past 6 that evening, as the oxen and horses were being brought into the camp, the dark forms of the enemy's horsemen began to debouch over the hills. and deploying into line, steadily advanced to Wards our little camp Over the heads of our horses and cattle, which were being driven in, whuMcd Stignrts first shot, which bowled over some six or seven on the extreme right of the enemy s line Startled by the

but still works away till positively forced to the rear Lieutenant Wells (an old Royal Artil Peryman), in command of this gun, a brass nine pounder, issues his orders with a cool judgment that fills his volunteer gunners with confidence, and they fire round after round of canister with deadly effect Near the Grahamstown gun, just as the action commenced in earnest, Sergeant Stahlschimdt, of Prince Alfred s Guards, fell severely wounded, and was carried under the waggon in the centre of the squire A little later Mr Pickering, of the same corps, received his wound as he stood to take a snap shot at one of the enemy within 30 paces The Kaffir and the volunteer fired simultaneously, and the Kaffir fell dead, while the wounded volunteer, unable to handle his rifle, had to seek shelter under the waggon As he passed to the rear he saw poor young Barron lying dead on his face, with hands outstretched He and a great friend of his both of Prince Alfred's Guards, were skirmishing next to one another, when a bullet from the direct rear struck him at the back of the head, going out under the left eye Death was almost instantaneous, and his comrades carried the body under cover of the waggon This was about 7 o'clock, and the fire was as heavy as ever The Capetown gun was a hot action all the time, doing splendid service Captain Bayley (late adjutant of the 9th Foot), who was attached to the column as Commandant of Infantry Volunteers, was ( ulm courage itself There he was conspicuous in w Into helmet and scarlet jacket, walking revolver in hand, behind his line of skirmishers, giving a cheery word here or a prompt order there, filling the volunteers with thorough confidence in themselves and their officers Nor was Captain Gordon, of our volunteers, one whit

cross the square for more ammunition in the hottest of the fire Eyes were turned upon him, expecting every moment to see him fall, but he returned without a scratch Soon a private of police and three more of Prince Alfreda Guards were wounded Darkness came on, and ammunition began to run short Captain Bayley ordered the men to be chary of ammunition, and not to fire unless absolutely necessary This reserving of our fire seemed to weary the enemy , their fire slackened, and at about 11 p in the last dropping shots ceased, and our weaned handful of men had a little breathing space A derisive voice from the enemy s ranks called out in English, " You can go to sleep now till to morrow, ' but the savage foe had little cause for his sarcasm occupied is he was in carrying off his wounded and securing the arms and ammunition of his numerous dead The men lay on their arms all night, mo mentally expecting a second attack Cant and Bayley resolved to husband his scanty store of ammunition till daylight, and ordered the men to use their bayonets in case of a night attack At 2 o'clock in the morning leisure was found to carry a little water to the wounded men, and after the arrival of a welcome reinforcement of mounted police from The a, the next morning showed the enemy retiring, carrying off his wounded and the arms left on the scene of the action. AT the enemy left 100 dead close to our camp The I mgoes traced many more afterwards in the bush, and besides this, the Kaffirs always carry off their mortally wounded whilst there is any sign of life in them Their loss may be reckoned roughly at some 200 killed and wounded as an estimate well within the mark During the action and through the night the wounded under the waggon had a bad time of it Bullets struck the waggon perpetually, and the horrible inaction of lying helplessly under fire, with stiffening limbs and bleeding wounds, was ten thousand fold worse than any amount of fatigue and expo i sure in action i CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE I (FROM THE DAILY TELEGRAPH, JAN 22 ) In the teeth of some very adverse prognos- i tications, and in spite of one most serious and deplorable contretemps, the cylinder ship to which the celebrated Egyptian obelisk was entrusted some months ago has at last arrived in London The abandonment of the Needle in the Bay of Biscay on October 14 and the unfortunate loss of life by which the circumstance was accompanied, must still be fresh in every memory Equally notorious is the fact that the queer shaped ship was discovered shortly after its supposed loss in an almost unimpaired condition, and towed into the harbour of Ferrol, a seaport town on the north western coast of Spain in the haven where she had found such on portune shelter the Cleopatra remained until the 13th of January, when, in accordance with an agreement entered into between Mr John Dixon and Mr VVm VV Atkins owner of the Channel tug Angha she left these shores in the wake of the last named vessel The two crafts, under the direction of Captain Carter and Navigating Captain John Tracey, appear to have been very fortunate with regard to weather, and yesterday they both arrived in the Thames in as good condition as when they quitted 1 error The whole space of time between the departure and the arrival of the ships, speaks of nothing but cloudless skies and smooth seas The vessels started at 35 minutes past 7 on Tuesday, and at 10 o'clock yesterday morning they arrived at Gravesend, where the Cleopatra was moored to a buoy and boarded by Mr Dixon the enterprising contractor to whose ingenuity the safe arrival of the mono hth is mainly due On one occasion during the transit it blew freshly from the east, and then the Cleopatra pitched heal try It was also sometimes found difficult to steer her property, especially when in smooth water At 1 yesterday the Anglia with the obelisk in tow left Gravesend for Blackwall In the meantime Mr Dixon had received a gracious message from Her Majesty the Queen, expressing her great gratification at the safe as by all of the Needle On their way up the river the steamer and her strange looking consort attracted a good deal of attention By 5 o'clock the Cleopatra was moored in the East India Dock, where a large number of people were anxiously awaiting her arrival in this harbour of refuge the Needle will probably remain for some time for up to the present, no decision has been come to as to the spot to be definitely selected for its erection, and the question of salvage raised by the owners of the Fitzmaurice, the ship that picked up the Cleopatra in the Bay of Biscay, has not yet been settled MISCELLANEOUS The dinner given to Mr H M Stanley by the Geographical Society of France was a signal success The gold medal of the society was presented by the president, Admiral La Rosiere le Noir Mr Stanley, in the course of his address, urged the society to associate the memory of the illustrious explorer and patient missionary Livingstone with the river he discovered He said - " At present the river is nameless There is no such stream as the Congo or the Zaire I want it to be associated for ever with the name of him who stated the conquest of the dismal barbarism of Africa in the basin of the Lualaba The geographical societies of Italy, of the Khedive, and of Marseilles have consented to my proposition I, therefore, in the name of the science you profess, for the sake of the enormous sacrifice he made in its cause, ask you once more to commemo- rate that unhappy death on the shores of Lake Bemba, to honour those long and sad years, that final exhaustion of a noble life by giving to that great artery of commerce in Central Africa the name of the champion of the dark races he loved so well-' Livingstone " The Belgian Minister of the Interior had asked for a grant of l,230,000f for fortifica- tions along the Scheldt Mr Foley s statue of the Prince Consort at Cambridge was unveiled by the Prince of Wales on January 22.

They were provided with axes, saws, hammers, and other tools necessary for the work Burney marshalled them into three gangs, and the fences fell before them with extraordinary rapidity The total damage is laid at about £2,000 Several police officers watched the proceedings, but did not interfere beyond taking the names of the chief actors The work of demolition was conducted in a very quiet and orderly manner. Mr Burney made a formal proclamation setting forth that the master of the rolls had declared the forest lands to be illegally enclosed, but that fences still remained round 700 acres, to the damage of the commoners and great injury of the natural beauty of the forest "
