Gold-fields Regulations No. IV. MODE OF TAKING POSSESSION OF CLAIM. Cl Busi 0 - Any party of miners my take pos- session of her iimfexCLptvvhereothcrivieospecially provided) by fixing firmly in the ground at each corner of the claim a peg or post, projecting at least two feet above the surface, and sit in L trenches, three feet long and six inches deep, along each boundary line, provided that no other miner m miners is, or are then, in possession 01 occupation thereof In the event of any other runner 01 Hillier being in possession of the chum, the p i ty desiring to take possession shall apply to the W in den to enquire into the matter, mci In case any winner shall take forcible possession of, or commence to work in, any claim after his right to take possession thereof has been dw pitted he shall forfeit all light and title which he may is no acquired therein the finding to this clause leads one to believe that the cause is general The exception in eluded within parenthesis shows that it has not a general application, but the clause itself does not show to what sort of chum it refers Thin in order to as certain to what sort of mining it nears, wo and examine the Regulations for the exception, when we find that clause 2 regulates the marking of all protection areas, clause 47 regulates the marking of " all quartz claims though a protection area may be a quartz claim, 1 tuse 09 of tunnelling protection area, and claude 70 of puddling claims, and the only other claims at specially provided for, with respect to marking, are the different descriptions of illegal, alluvial pro- tection in case excepted This is rather a round about way of showing how alluvial claims also to be marked If a miner, unacquainted with the Gold fields Regulations of Queensland, went to peg out an invalid claim he must, in order to ascertain what dun option of claims are included in the exception, ' except where offer toast specially pi ox ruled, examine the w hole of the Regulations If the clause were headed "Mode of taking possession of alluvial claims, and the latter half of the clause left out, all this trouble and uncertainty would be avoided This time, therefore, in as far as marking is concerned, refers to the different descriptions of allow of ordinary chum, and is so far p irregular in its application The first half of the other sentence of this clause appears al of to be paid to the ir ' In the event of any other miner or miners being in possession of the claim (that is the claim worked off by four pegs or posts, which, as before shown must be an till a x in claim), the party desiring to take possession shall apply to the Warden to enquire into the matter, that is the matter to enquire as to who is entitled to the possession of this claim in a ked as above I, and which must be an alluvial third Then again the following "In case any man shall take forcible possession of or commend to work in any claim would lead us to believe that this portion of the clause was general It is hardly reasonable to suppose that the Legislature would fat at, as in this clause, with a particular application to alluvial claims and wind up with a general application to all sorts of claims Again, it is only in alle nal claims that any serious damage could be done the owners by others commencing to work before being legally put in possession In quartz reef claims very little injury can be done If we will take such a long time to get out a crushing that the original shareholder will have plenty of time to apply to a Warden to remove the trespassers, whereas in alluvial claims, five or six trespassers may work out a small claim in a week I have known several claims on the Palmer which could be worked out in half that time by six men this could not happen in quaiLs claims If it were in tended that the latter portion of this clause should refer to quality, it should have been made a clause by itself It would then be very easy to make its application either general or particular I shall pass by clause 7 for the present, until dealing with clause 15, and come to Clause 8 -"All claims must he continuously worked within forty eight hours after they have been in a kid oil, with the requisite number of men, otherwise such claim or claims shall be liable to for feature, and thereafter any claim or share in a claim remaining unveiled or unrepresented for three ordinary working days shall be liable to forfeiture Provided that no miner shall forfeit his interest in my claim if employed at any necessary work in connection with it, or if his absence be caused through attendance at a Court of Justice or through a general cessation from work through floods of min, or on any public holiday, or on holidays proclaimed by Walden This clause throws a doubt on the meaning of the world claim there is no interpretation clause to the Regulations, but there is to the Act, and as the Regulations are framed under an that ity of the Act, it is reasonable to suppose that the interpretation el case of the one would be applicable to the other the meaning of the world' claim, then, is the position, of Crown land which any person, or number of persons, shall lawfully line taken possession of and be enabled to occupy for mining purposes or any number of such portions lawfully amalgamated by the holders Prov idea that no land compel laid in any lease grand for milling purposes shall be deemed to be a claim According to this interpretation, "protection area ' is a claim because it is a piece of land taken up for mining purposes, and is not held under lease, and therefore under clause 8 it need not be worked forty eight hours after being marked all but clause 3 requires that it must be winked within twenty four hours after milking, and here the two clauses contradict each other I make these remarks to show how loosely avoided the Regulations are After the words all claims should come the words protection areas excepted,' or "except where otherwise specially provided, and that these clauses would not clash Again, this clause requires that all claims must be continuously worked within forty eight hours after marking lins reads as if it should be worked every hour for the first forty eight hours after marking, or from the time it was marked!, because it says immediately after, and thereafter any claim or share a claim remaining unworked or more presented for three ordinary working days, shall be liable to forfeiture The first quotation declares forfeiture if not worked " continuously within forty eight hours after milking If this means what it really was intended to mean, that work should be commenced immediately after the expiration of forty eight hours from the time of mm king, how can it be continuously worked when the next portion of the clause allows that it may be heavy orkedfot two days because it is notfoifeitable until it lstiniiothed for three days Again, as fat as I am aware, one miner may hold under this clause three claims Suppose he worked in No 1911 Monday, No 2 on Tuesday, and of 3 on Wednesday, and then went back again to Noon Thursday, No 2 on Friday, and No 3 on Satura ly Neither of these claims is unworked for more than two days, and neither under this clause is forfeitable until it is the ice days unworked and unrepresented, and as far as I am away of there is no clause in the Regulations under which either could be declared forfeited , of course the common sense of any Warden and two assessors would very soon put a stop to this practice even though they had no authority in law Wardens must, no matter how closely they adhere to may, be sometimes themselves the law Clause 9 is a very necessary one Clause 10 -"All claims of any description, except quartz claims, must be marked oil at each corner by a peg standing at least two feet above the ground, the same to be kept visible during the working of the claim, and the owners of every claim shall be entitled to all auriferous deposits within the perpendicular of the pegs (that is within the vertical planes passing through the boundaries thereof as denoted by the pegs), and no person shall remove or destroy the pegs or boundaries of any claim or authorised holding" This clause applies to all sorts of claims except " quartz claims " It must, therefore, apply to alluvial of every description What the necessity for the first part of this was is rather difficult to make out. As I have shown before, it applies only to alluvial, and even in its application to that it is wrong Clause G also applies to the working of allen land claims, and is far and away more particular than this Any person who would mark off an allow no claim or any other claim as directed by this clause would be marking it off wrong the other clause for the marking of alluvial claims requires the pegs to be set in L trenches Again, it contradicts. clause 75 Puddling 1 time are alluv ml claims, and not quite the claims, and are therefore within the meaning of the first part of this clause, but the last part of this clause does not require the peg to be more than two feet high, whereas clause 70, applicable to puddling claims, which as I have said before are also alluvial claims, requires the pegs to be three feet high Fins of use would be a very useful clause if all that part of it before the words and the owners of were struck out Claiisell - The Warden may issue a certificate of exemption from work for any period not more than thirty days (renewable from time to time for a like period at his discretion) in cases whole he is satisfied either that the person claiming exemption is inc in returned from working through tendent or sickness, or that the breaking down or the absence of machinery, or superabundance or want of water, justifies such exemption, and the W tilden shall hear and determine any objection to granting or renewing such certificate The last sentence of this clause states "And the vi aided shall hear and determine any objection to granting or renewing such certificate But there is no way of ascertaining that the application is to be made No notice is required and, as a matter of course, there will be no opposition where there is no knowledge of the api Illation A great deal of mischief may be done under this clause Suppose three chime on a line of reef, and that these are very wet claims Let us suppose a shareholder or two from the middle claim to apply for exemption and get it-and unopposed the could show very good grounds for getting it without any on cealment of facts, and b) answering truly every question asked them by the Warden - the consequence would be, in many instances the other two claims would be throw a idle Their remedy, under such circumstances, would be towaitpitientlyforthirtydays and oppose the renewal And, of course, this month would be lost to them this could not happen if the applicants were compelled by this 1 rise to point a notice of their intention to apply) for exemption on the claims and another on the Court house or W arden s office Clause 12 - 'An) person as he shall by false representation, or fraudulent concealment of facts obtain registration of any mining or other interest or who shall by such means obtain a certificate of exemption from work, shall be liable to fur felt the property in respect of which such registration or certificate of exemption shall have been so obtained This clause in as far as registration is concerned, is a very useful and necessary clause On the principle that a man has a right to dispose of his own pt open by without being obliged to con suit his neighbors wishes on the matter, no notice is now required for transfer of mining property But was far as obtaining a certificate for exemption from work is concerned, it would appear that the principle adopted is "prevention is not better than cure If the police were required there could then be no concealment of facts, because the application would be a public one, and any miner who thought he had reason to complain could oppose the application In cases of application for certificates of exemption of mi work, it would, in the majority of cases, be just as difficult to prove firmament concealment of facts as it would be to prove wilful perjury If a notice were required by clause 11, it would prevent further litigation in as far as certificates of exemption was also concerned Clauses -" Auvbolderof ammer sighting holiday) number of claims or shares in claims, provided that such claims or shires in claims are duly worked and represented by holders of miners rights 'This clause is a very useful, and at the time these Regulations were framed was a very necessary one Under the old Regulations there was no guide as to how many shares could be taken up under one name slight and some very absurd rules were made by some commissioners Some ruled that one miners right would hold only one share 11 the same line of reef, and others ruled two shares In fact, the rules were different on different gold fields This clause appears to be a very simple one Any one leading it would come to the conclusion that not alone may a miner hold, but that he may also take up, under one miners light, any number of shares , but the ruling in some gold fields, at any ten on one is that in order to hold any number of shares, these shares unit he first taken up under separate miners right, and then may be transferred over and held under one miners right This interpretation will entail a cost of five shillings per share and will also place a man at the mercy of those whose miners' rights he honors in order to take up more than in one shale Had the first sentence read as follows no ndv range could be taken - "Any holder of a miners right may take up and hold under one miner s right It would be well if Mr King interpreted this clause in the shape of instructions for all the W ardens Clause 14 -" Possession of a claim by any numbers being holders of miners' lights shall be pi list face evidence of title to such claim I should think possession of anything ought to Xmpinna gave evidence of title to it The author mix just nsw oil have said, Possession is nine points of the his Clause 7 -
