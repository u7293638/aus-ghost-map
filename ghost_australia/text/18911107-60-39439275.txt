Echoes. I Royalist expected in Cairns shortly. Fitzroy 11 ip on Monday. All should go. Don't forget the canvassers are round in connection with the regatta. The ghost is still at large, although the chase is becoming fast and furious. Everyone is determine 1 to make the re- gatta a success. Canvassers are now on the tapis. A Russian financier has offered the Servian Government twenty million frauks on easy terms. What for ?

Visitor: "Can I see Mrs. Whitelie ?" Slavey : " No, ma'am, you can't, for she's out." "Out ! Why I saw herat the window." " Yes. raa'iim ; but there's different sorts of * outs,' and mi=sis is out at elbows, and hasn't got a dress fit to receive company in." Our friend Prince Billy has just given us his opinion of J. G. Gribble from a gastro- nomic point of view. He says: '' Too much long feller; too much talky; too rauch tellum white feller no good. Suppose killum, no good cat um-all same eat um cassowary." This is the way in which a London paper mentions a piece of Society news :-George Kangeris expected to shoot at SixMile-Bottom I thc close of the month. Does this awful intelligence refer to a place or a-person P í Is I Mr. Six Mile-Bottom- evidently a nick- name in this eventuality-going to stand up and be potted by His Royal Highness ? or is it the name of the ¡ocas in quo where the Royal Duke is going to " kill something ?" We trust the latter is the true reading of the text.
