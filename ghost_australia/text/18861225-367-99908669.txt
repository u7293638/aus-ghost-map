The village inhabited by the workpeopl-- at the " shops"-as the enllint factory was ealled--belonged to him. 110 had institutcd a church and forbade anyone to go to clhapel in pain of his high displeasu-o, but many went all the tuumec. Ito had i a lost- ollico, a school, a publiclouse--onlv one--a reading room, and a rccreation roomu, wit all mcdern inmusemilenils laid on for the lUisiuro hours of the tenaOtry who voted for him ill the election to a nilan -or nearly so-for Sir. Walter never lirilibd anyone, nor would he per rtil any apparent inlterference witil a voter. Iut it was goineially undersatood that Sir Waltcr ought to be sopported tas a Literal nemller, and he was, Suntil hl wavs olfendtd at osinme Parliamentary inter fercnce, and then Ie changed his politics and gained a baronctcy. S ThIlis gtive rise to somo little discuIssion, and wheni the nost goueral elcltiou came, Sir Walter put up it It t Conservatie, anlld wast duly returned. A petilion was lodged, but not a tittle of evidence was forthlcominig rtespettclin any touit of intimidation o, Sb-iibery, and the conumissionecr returned a "el' an bill *t "f healtht" to th new moembeor.

" So she is, and we'll go down to the < Maid' and drink her eileth, and confusion to to the man that reio'ed lucy iRaymond. Come along, nimate," said Bill. " Wait a minute," Said Collier; "I'm not quite ready. I must be in at tou, and I've only an hour. 1It ieo'll go across." III a few minutes the pair quitted the house, and made for the inn which had for its sign the head of n girl, and was call 1 the " Villhige Maid." The evening was rather dark, and the road, shel lered by trees, was gloomy. As they proceeded, their conversation turned ipon the never-failing theme that had served them when no other topic would have drawn forth an answer-Lucy. They met a few people, and exchanged a " Good night" with some women and children, and now and then ca man mlono, and not quite able to take care of himself. "A tidy lass" was Collier's comment upon a woman carrying a child whom they passed near the inn. " Rather late for her to be trampin' it just now. Couldn't take her in, I suppose, oh? Good night," he cried to her. She made no answer, but when the men had got on a little she halted, and after a moment's consi deration, sat down in the gloom under the trees. ', ople passed and re-passed, hut no notice was taken of her, and there she remained for nearly an hour until Collier passed on his way to the signal boa, and then she lose and followed him, but she was evidently weary. "Not a penny," she muttered. "Not a penny to get ia night's lodging or a bit to eat. Io'll never refuse m as little. And yet he can be criel, and he ilay be harsh lut I must try, or die !" Shie "'hushed" the child kindly erough as she transferred the burthen to her right arm, aniid pro cer ded on her way. Collier, unconscious that he was being followed, went on leisurely, and enteted the signal-box in the cutting to relieve his mate, Dick. "l'unctuality is the thief of time, George,' remarked the man in the box ; "and)ou ialways are up to him, I must say." "I wish you were," retorted (ollier. " Why, you kop' me waitin' ten lminutes only yesterday, and it was near to cnty the time afore." Collier was not in the beat of tempers; that much was evident to Dick, who replied, for he was fond of prow rbs, as he thought them: "' loft answers is like the running of water e,olin' and pleasant.' So I'll not contradict ye, (George, more than sa; in' that lies is no argumont.'" " Comei, clear out wihi your llies,' or you'll lie here on the floor for a while," returned Collier, angrily. "If you're late iiin the morinr' I'll report you." "ireport away," retorted Dick. "It's a pity ye ran't ceep sober, George. '\\\ ino is a mocker and beer is ragim',' as Mr. Rlobinson tells me. So good night, and I'll relieve you early ias you like. Good night !" SGood-night," replied Collier, half sulkily. Beer is ragin', is it? Well, then, 1 hadn't any worth speaklin' about. Only spirits. What's that ?" lie listened intently, but the sound, whatever it was, was not inmmediately repealted, and he was too busy to attend to anything but his duties for some minutes. At length, what appeared to him to be a trip at the door, roused him, and lihe tunoed towards it. T'lhe door slowly opened and a female form came into the full hlazo of the gars-light. Collier involuntarily retreated. Ilis hand pressed I:c.n lhis forehead as if he looked upon a ghost. I-s hair almoot stood up in his terror, and he could not uitter a word. " Don't yoe know me, George?" lie knew her now. The voice was enough. But he put oit his aniu iis if to thrust her out. "LGo, go-leave me in peace. IKnow ye-yes, I 10io- only too well.

Georgo look id at her as she spoke, and sho per. coived she had moade an impression upon him. She was pretty and neat, and lear figure, more rounded andl maitroly t1han sf yore, would have been con sidered good by competent judges. There was a earewssing look in her eyes is they met his, and hIis stern gazo softened as it rested upon her, for had hie not loved- did lie not still love, this woman, rind here she was again by his side, almost touching h;im.

She had played upon the old strings--his devotion and his former passion. She hI ol reated ssymplathy for herself, and might yet obtain his assItiance in her views and plans.

What if she wser free, she might in time ie his wife, so pretty as she was and so mllch better in her manner qulite a lade. Lucy made no resistance. She was ,pa..Sive in his clasp, but her pretty head just--as it were 'snconseiously-droplscd a little to his broad shouilders, asd her eyes met his pleadingly. So pleading were they, that George understood lthem at oncer. They aippeared to ask him not to take ; dvar:,itge of her repentance, but to treat her well beriausse he might win her if lihe chose. Ile was (orely tempted to kiss her, and made as if to do so s. 'neveor'preventing him ; but he did not venture, and he let her go. She was disappoitced, and a shade of annoyance crossed her face. She had counted on that, for she lknow George Collier's nature, and felt that she might win him by permitting a caress, for which she did not care the least, except inasmuch as he mnight be attracted by, it, and do as she required hlim to do. A pupil.of the Syron Vivien was Lucy Layton. Collier released her with a jerk; and, as a man of his temperament might be expected to do, he kept at a distanconow. He would not trust himself within reach of the woman he still loved, for he felt hlie might offend. But he did not know how much ebo wished he would offend, so that he might be made esubissive; butall of course within most proper boeunsd'. " I suppose I'd better go. I don't know what peiople ill say if they knew I was here. I can, perhIps, get at bed at the inn, though it is late." "tYes, the house is pretty well closed up by now," replied George, standing helplessly aloof, wishing to be, Ibut not daring to go, near her. "Yo can't reaulllin hero, Lucy." "lNo, and the child wants looking after," she answered. Th child- Laton's ildI-Liston's child. George had quite firgttten that.

P T'lih mention of the child brought all his manhood Ibck I its iproper channel, and George Collier was ihin?elf tugihl. ie had been very nearly carried iswasy, but the old lore had been put iaside, Ii'ey perceived what was passing in his mind, and her l a tee instincts recognised the restraint which 1,e u1t pan.

" Whore am I to go, then ?" she aslked simply. "Of course I can't go to your house,but father-" "No, I suppose not," he answered, scarcely heeding what he said, as his attention was taken up by his duties. "No, ye can't go to my house," he added, more steadily ",there would be fine gossip." "What do I care for gossip," she said. " And now, George Collier, I've something to ask of you; , nobody tells me truth about it. Where's father '" "Your father? Jack Raymond, dye mean? Why, don't ye know, 3Irs. Layton ?" " Knowe-what? Don't call mo Mrs. Layton, George. I don't know anything. I went to find him, and he wasn't at home." " Yes; he is at home," replied George: solemnly. "He is at home. He'll never come back hero again. He's dead." "Dead! Dead! Oh, George Collier, yo don't mean that? Tell me now-at once?" She was greatly excited and perplexed. He remained silent, and in the few moments which elapsed, the whirring noise of the blazing gas was distinctly heard by both. "Yes, he was killed, on the railway the very night you ran away with that soldier." "Yes. Go on; go on. God help me!" "Well, that night-threo years ago, nearly, I supposo it is--he saw a ghost-an appearance." "A ghost!" gaspedthowoman. " Goon." "Yes, two ghosts," he said. "One was a female figuro; the other a man, or the appearance of a man; and they passed the line yonder by the tunnel. What's the matter ?" Lucy had turned as white as a sheet, and sank down upon the bench in terrified silence. After a minute or two she again looked up. Her face was ashy pale; her eyes were staring into vacancy. The child she hold in her arms uttered a plaintive cry, and she roused herself to quiet it. " Well ?," she said, hoarsely. "Yo frightened me, that ye did," said the signalman. "I never thought yo holievedinghosts any more than me. HIowsomdever, poor old Jack he sees them, and ho makes across the line to find out whether they were the appearances he had seen before, ye remember?" " Yes, yes, I see it all now. Oh, father, father, I've keilled you! It's a judgment on me." "You're off your hecad a bit to-night, I believe," rem?arked the signalman, not very sympathetically. "What had you to do with it. lie never know yeo ranned away. Bill told me. I1o saw ye. Ah, he did." "And told fathor? It killed him. Oh, father -poor father !" "Killed him! No. The train killed him,. HIe was huntin' for these 'appearances' amn the 'fast goods'-that very one as is a comin' up presently Joe Brown was drivin' it-come out of the tunnel and knocked poor Jack over. Ile didn't suffer, poor chap. It was all done in a wink like. It wasn't your fault, Lucy." The honest guileless man even then attempted to console the woman who had so ruthlessly wrecked his life, and who had caused her father's death. "Don't touch me," she almost screamed. "I tell you I killed him. There was no ghost. Frank and I crossed the line many a time, and we did it that night too." This fact took time to penetrate to George's brain. Stubborn things, like facts did, as a rule, take time to reach his mind if they were unconnected vith the railway and its signals. But in a moment or two he perceived that the "ll,ppearances" were due to llluy and her lover. George Collier turned away, and looked out at the door of the signal-box. lie was not in a mood for love now. It was a lovely night, ncaring tihe witching hour. Thse stars glitterod overlicead, anld winked through the gathering moisture. The moon was setting slrac:dy, and only a faint gleam was in the sky. All was bluoe-a beautiful eapphire blue-and not a breath of air was stirring. 'I here was sa noise of some kind lorno to the signalman upon the air. It came from the direction of tho"e hops" some distan'e away, and had not Col icr been cerlain that nobody was likely to bring out a locomotive at that hour, he would have fancied that an engine was slowly coming, up the inoe. lie lists n?d for 'a second or two longer, and the noise increased in ever-rising loudness. Do hurried down tihe steps to the metals, and lay down upon the permanent way, with his car sulon the rail. "(Good God!" he muttrresd, "theto's something colling up, and I've had no walning. It's not a specis !; it isn't fast enough. It ain't i' goods;' it's not isheavy enough. It's an empty engine, i'll be An empty engine! There was nothing vosy alarming in an engine without a train; such esgines are known on the railway as " empty," but the tinlm and the myosteriotus manner of its slow approach, quite unanneounced, puzrled the man. " ' ts curious, by .lingo,!" he said,, as he rose and ascended tile steps. 'l'hen talting his lampi he left his signal at danger, arnd leaned out as far as he could to get a look an the intruder, and hail the driver. There was no mistake abret it.

A sudden thought occurred to him., He was sure that the goods had two ongines attached, and the pilot, as ihe know, went no farther tllan N- . If he could get it detached, the runaway mlight be caught beforo any mischlref was done. Ito blocked tile line at once and called I.uc. " Can ye stand by tihe instruments for a bit t" he askoed. "Ye used to know them." - " I remember them well," shie answered, seeling that something wits wrong aiud she might help. "Yes, I can signal well enough." S'lhon wait there till I come back," he said. "fiind the child ; put him on the flour." "It's a girl, George," she iaid, ias she laid the infant in the corner, well wrapped in a ihawl. " Sho's fiast asleep now." Scarcely had she turned when the fast " goods " drew out of the tunnel, and pulled tiup in ieeponser to George's signal. " here we are, stopped againi," shouted the man who was driving the folerslt engine or " pilt." " What' the stntter tosright? I believe this cuttling's bewitched." "Did ye pass an enigine ," inquired George. " A big one, tender first, gain' slow." "Aye, and eias I to my mate, I says, that's the Watson.' Didln't I, Fret1 ? " " Yes, we both says it," assented Fred, who did 0ot wish to be left out of the question and discovery. "Wo've no time for talking," replied Collier; "uncouple your ' pilot' and lot's follow him upi; the governor's son is aboard of it. I saw tile gold hind on his cap." "Young Masteor Ed'ard on that big engin', why sho'll drag his arms off if he tries to run her. Lord A'mnighty Fred, tarte up." " All right," replied the active Fred. " Hero's a pretty row. Stop the trains behind us, and we'll pick him up. Ready, mato? " "Aye, aye. Stand clear, Georgo." "I'm gorn' with yo. I've got a inato in the bIox nll right. Now, run to the cross-over, and I'll put ye across to the up.line." The engine rapidly reached the points, and with the hand.lamp Georgeo ignalled to the box, and Luoy rapidly changed the points from the box. " They've got pretty bit o' start," remarked the d:iver. is he put on the steam and pulled up his lever. "These goods engines ain't as speedy as thoe uIdl to L:e." ~Li'ccly were tho words spoken when the tunnel was gainedl, and in two minutes the engino had cnwrged -*t tho other side, and pulled up to inquire whether any warning had come from the next box ahead at the station two miles away. " No," replied the man; " I heard nothing pass. I suspect ye're all on a wild goose chaso-a phantom engine like the old story my grandfather told about at ship--" "Tell it to your grandmaother," retorted Collier. " I saw it with young iMaster on it." " Go on, then; yo're all clear. I'll protect ye," said the old man, not meaning to usurp the fune tions of Providence, but intending to stop all fol lowing trains. Again the chase was renewed and this time con finued. The small wheels of the goods engine were revolving at a tremendous pace-a rate they had never been intended to run- along the level, rattling and roaring; along the embankment, catch ing es glimpse of the dawn, and then plunging into a cutting in which the fire wasreflected, and seemed to surround the engine as in a conflagration. Then again emerging as the banks on each side sank down with a rapid roar, and gave place to fields, the furrows in which leaped across from side to side, and the fence raced the engine to the end of the field, till it came to a sudden stop, and held its breath ase the rapid locomotive disappeared again. It was a terrible ride, and none of the men on the pursuing engine mknw how far or how fast the run away might have run. A curve was rapidly turned after about fifteen minutes' racing, and a long piece of straight line, terminating in a steepish gradient, led into the Great Hamble Station-a busy place, with chimneys and furnaces roaring, wheels whirring, and much clanking of great hammers day and night. " We shall got a glimpse of her now," said the engine- driver. "If we can't catch her up on the level, sheo'll kill somebody sure as d, ath." " Is the mail duo, George?" asked the fireman. " What has the dcown mail to do with it," he replied. " WT're on the up line." "This much," continued the fireman. "Ther's cross over points near here- . By Jove there's the mail, and we can, perhaps, race the ' Watson.' " "There she is," exclaimed George, unheeding the fireman. " Now let us wire in and catch her up." "I say no," interposed the fireman. " Look here, mate, you knows as well as me that we can't catch up the runawayon the down grade. We must catch her before that and keep her fast, else she'll run ahead oven at her present speed." "What do you mean then--beo quick i" " Let us hurry to the points ahead. where she is about now. Cross over, get the line blocked, and run in on the down line and pull her up. There's a iWhistle, listen!" " Good for you, Fred," was the driver'r reply, and, with a rush of steam, the "goods" engine soon covered the interveningground. Thorunawa) engine was nearing the top of the incline on the up lino. The men proposed to cross to the other metals, and run alongside them to catch the loose enginc. George Collier ran up into the box, and told the signalman. Altering the points, and blocking the line between them, theose two men waited the result. The engine sped on now at a furious pace, and a regular chase began. The huge locomotive had all this time been going leisurely, but, just as it had passed the long curve, a somewhat rude shock had released the break, till then partly on the tender wheels, and had awaked the lad lying upon the footplate. He rose staggering to his feet, and gazed dreamily around. What did it mean? His first ideawas that it was a terrible dream, but the increasing pace, the regular beat of the pistons, the rattle of the tender, soon aroused him to a sense of his position. The engine had got loose. It was running away with him! "What's that! A whistle behind him. The shrill sound thoroughly awoke him to his danger. lie had no idea where he was, and expected almost instant death. But the lad had presence of mind enough to blow the whistle and to try to shut off the steam. But the regulator was new and stiff. It would not move. Lie could not close the valve! The whistle was heard, however, both by the pursuing engineers and by the men near the Great Hamble Station, where some consternation was felt at the already signalled approach of the Phantom. Proparations had already been madoe for turing the engine into a siding, but the news from the last box that a boy was on the footplate, changed these ideas, and the line was clearcd, while an engine was already moving upon the other line ready to start at speed and grapple it. However, all these precautions were happily in necessary. The boy was surprised and de'ighted to hear the goods engine gaining upon him, and though he could not shut the regulator valve, he was able by tremendous effort to pull back the lover and so reduce the steam a little in the cylinders. This effort was almost more than lie could accom plish, but fortunately practice stood him in good stead, and in a few miles more the engines ran side by side. The driver of the "goods " engine then went for ward, and, biding his time, leaped upon the broad plate and buffer-beam over the front wheels of the new engine. In a moment he bad gained the foot plate, and, with a powerful arm, had wrenched back the regulator valve, and all danger was over. ... "Thank you," said the lad, firmly enough. "I will not forgot you. What's your name ?" The driver told him, and then as the two engines were brought to Great IIamblo as quietly as if nothing had happened, the boy inquired how they had ascertained he had booeen adrift on the loco motive. "It was George Collier as saw you, sir. lie noticed it and stopped our train, and then my mate, Fred, here, he said we had better run across and alongside of ye, and then-" " You risked your life to stop my runaway horse," interrupted the lad. "Give me your hands, friends; I think I can promise you something handsome for your bravery. Where is Collier ?" They told him, and then the young engineer insisted upon taking the engine back again, piloted by the goods to the shops. They had run fll thirty miles in about thirty-live minutes. "Pretty smart going," remarked the young man; the last bit was speedy, eh '" "Yes, sir. Ye went easy at first, but when we got on the grade it was a mercy as we caught yo up," replied the driver. "But how could you leave your signals, Collier? Won't any harm come of that ?" "I left a person in charge," replied the man, reddening. '"Quito accidentally an old friend, who's used to signals, came, and ho-she I mean-is in the box." As soon as the tunnel had been cleared and the familiar cutting regained, the signalman and the young man ascended the stops and found Lucy standing at the instrument quite self-possessed. The lovely little girl was sleeping peacefully beside the great signal levero. Young Watson advanced and thanked her, and then stood gazing at her and the little girl--a well grown babe, scarce one year old. As he looked tihe child awoke, and, opening her tinyarmcs, l'usghed stthe comely face of the boy, though now his skin sas not free from dust. "How curious !" he exclaimed. " There is quite a likeness to somebody I know. Who is it, I wonder? Thank you," he continued, turning to Lucy. "I am much obliged to you all. Good night. I will see you again. Good- night." Lucy's heart fell when she heard him speak of the likeness. The boy had seen it, too. The child was like leer father, Colonel Deane, and Edward Watson know it.
