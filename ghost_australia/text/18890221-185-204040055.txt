THE BALLARAT TRUSTEES AND EXECUIORS COMPANY AND MR CUTHBERT. TO THE ED ITOR. —Yours, &c.;, J NOBLE WILSON SIR, —Mr Cuthbert started his first letter to prove that his opposition to the Ballarat Trustees Bill was not “needless” and was not “vexatious.” His second letter takes quite new ground, but I prefer to keep him to the original contention, and to do so I will adopt the authority that Mr Cuthhert asserts la the only one recognised “in reference to everything doueln Parliament ” I will give him a few texts from his own text book — Hansard, and if, as Mr Cuth bert says, “it contains a true and faithful report of what occurs,” we will see how far it sustains the original charge In Hansard, page 1536, appears the virtuous, but somewhat specious, speech made by Mr Cuthbert m Committee of the House. After enumerating a host of evils which might ensue from this bill, and from the powers already given to one or two of the Trustees Companies, he s»ys in reference to the Ballarat bill, “Ido not want to see the bill rejected,” evidently he felt that his arguments all tended m that direction, os indeed they did, and Mr Simon Fraser interjected, “you are going the right way to get it rejected ” This remark fairly represented the feeling of the House, and this feeling was accentuated by Mr Zeal, who said that the Munster of Justice placed himself in a position of the gravest respon sibihty, by the views he had submitted that evening. Last session, when he (Mr Zeal) pertinaciously endcav ored to prevent certain companies from obtaining and vngerous powers, “ he received no support whatever from the Minister of Justice” He (Mr Zeal) failed to see that there was any reason for the dismal forbodmgs which the Minister had indulged in, and “ meanwhile it was unfair to throttle the company now in question,” meaning the Ballarat company. Mr Service said that “in face of the statements of the Minister of Justice it would be quite impossible for any honorable member to try to force a bill of this character through the House ” • • • “At the same tune he felt that the promoters of this and other similar bills had a good deal of reason to complain of the delay that bud taken place Although these bills had been before Parlia ment for months, and although they proposed nothing mure than had been previously passed by Parliament in lespect of other companies already in operation, serious ob jection vv as not raised until now. It would be a great pity if, after the trouble and money which had been expended, the bills were lost by delay ” Whatever may' have been Mr Guthbert’s designs, these quotations from Hansaid sound very much ns if the House thought he was opposing our bill And my directors thought so too. At list, after finding that the members in sisted upon his allaying the ghost he had raised, Mr Cuthbert brought iu his public bill, aud on the 30th October the House considered it in committee. Alas 1 it was theu discovered that the public bill was not intended to apply to the Ballarat bill at all Of course we now know from Mr Cuthbert himself that he considered it more proper that the Ballarat bill should be amended separately acd sent back to the Assembly, where to nil appearance it was certain to be wrecked. The House willed it otherwise, and in obedience to this will, Mr Cuthbert moved an amendment in his own measure, making it apply to all the companies alike. Mr Zeal then “expressed his surprise that the bill should have been so imperfectly drafted ns to require the amendments pro posed ” But indeed the bill was amended in every clause, so that when it came out of committee it was scarcely recogmsab'e even by its own pareut, so changed was it m every feature. It may fairly be said that this “ great restraining measure,” which was heralded by Mr Cuthbeit as the magna charta of the widow and orphan, contains little that was not already provided for, sav e aud except that it aims to restrain the improper powers grauted last session in spite of the “ pertinacious endeavors” of Mr Zeal Thus I conteud th vt out of Hansard , the one authority lecoguised “in reference to every thing done m Parliament,” I have pioved that in the opinion of membeis of the House, and of many outside of the House, Mr Cuth bert impeded the passage of our bill This was vexatious; and as the bill did not re quire alteration beyond the general altera tions which applied to all similar companies, 1 contend th it his opposition was also “ needless.” To deal with Mr Cuthbert’s last letter in detail will make this reply too long. I will simply say that there arc one or two very disingenuous remarks aud garbled quotations which should be ex posed, but I oau only refer to two of them here. Mr Cuthbert asserts that Mr Service said “ Mr Fraser hit the right nail on the head when he said that the bill now before the House (meaning thcßal larat bill) was really a deceptive bill.” In what part of Hansaid does this appear ’ If the words were ever used, I venture to say they are here severed from the context in such v w ay-as to giv ean impression that Mr Service never intended them to con vcy. Mi Cuthbert also says “Mr Wilson now abandons the positiou taken up ongi nally by him, th it legislation to restiam these companies was needless " I never took up any such position I said Mr Cuthbert’s opposition to on i bill was needless—not thvt it vv as needless to restrain certain compauies fiom exercising the powers gianted to them to buy and sell laud on their own account I said this pawei was “a daugerous lunova tion," and, in fact,]itis the very power which Mr Zeal says he pertinaciously eudeavored to prev eut when Mr Cuthbert refused to help him.-
