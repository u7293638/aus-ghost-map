: MACBETH. ' Mr. . Thonias . Kenny; a, clever essay- , ist, and ayho . has avritten most. ably, on ' the subject , ofC Macbeth," charact-.T- ' , jses it as " a drama , of gigantic crime.. I 'and terror relieved by the most mag- '..nihcent imaginative expression, ' yet ' marked with great simfilicity of general. . design. The date of the pio luction of the piece is set. by Furnival at 1665-6, I and " we may take it fi r grunted," says Kenny, " that it' was written in the lime of James the First, who f ascended the throne March, 1663, as it . contains an evident allusion to that monarch in act iv. scene I, and also . a i compjimcntary reference to him in an other part. The material for 'the play ' wa.s found by Shakespeare in Holin- ) shed's History of Scotland, where the' story of Macbeth is told at. page 168." ' The Macbeth and Duncan are.repre- sented to have been cousins-; the first , a valiant gentleman but of cruel dispo- ) silion, and the latter, "so- -soft and I gentle in his nature that the people wished the inclination and manners of I the two to have been so .tcmiered- a:-ul k intGrchaiigcably shared betwixt them- that where the one ' had. too much of I clemency and the'-other of cruelty, the. k main virtue be'lwe'eri these two extre- niitics might have reigned by indiffer- " ) ent iiartition in them both. The play J all along keejis clo'se ' to' the line of ' Holiiishecl, varying from it in scarcely ) any particular except in the 'hbh- . ' apiiearance in the banquet scene of the murdered Banquo's gliosf." ) This tragedy has been presented in Melbourne we believe ofteiier than any ' , other of Shakespeare's works. ' The ) .Late G.. V.
