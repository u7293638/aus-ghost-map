With' ''Vih'toh Arnold',' however, ; it was! very diflerent, ' and scarcely an hourj passed that' sh'e'. was not wondering where' he w;as,aiid again .questioning his pro-; Wnfe^\aletoel,r'MiOtt^.IliiB]B'beart','.lJeatj quick,i jas ' she ;., ipn agined ; she i caught a glimpse ?; of.-him in the street ; aiidi it must be admitted that she looked for him! constantly ?although-shevto'ok pains never! to;pass his residence. Could he be ill, or was he patiently waiting, like: -herself, secure in her good faith1?- 'She' longed to' see h\m/e'v(sn't\ipngh unseen .Herself,1 aiid one Supdiiy ea'riy'm.^oyembQrshe jieldeii to her strong desire to: look upon one in' reality .who; had become; an abiding pre sence in her /mind. She believed, that from a certainpart pf ;-,the gallery.in the church they-bo»,h 'had attended in former days she could look 'down 'upon--th( 'Arnold pew. If h- were not ill; she' :.fell| [quite i jure he;wpul|jh!e|.'in,hi|,dld placed j It was almost with a sense; of guiltj iutrusion;tb.at she crossed ,the threshold of her old churcb-home and stole to thg thinly occupied gallery. , She saw familiar .faces, but 'shrank/ from; recognition in ?almost' trembling apprehension,' scarcely Reeling secure ? behind her'thick'Veil;, Th-| ,plfice, once so familiar, ,' nbw^.s.eem'ei'las strange.as if it belonged: to uanothej1 world'j'and in a certain sense she felt that it was part of a world with 'which* she would never; willingly identify herself ?again. It was a place/where fashipn'was ;isqprem'e,,and not the spirit! of Christ, not ,even the spirit of/ajibroad, honest,' and ' earnest humani ty. The florid architecture' the hich-nriced and eWantlv rinh'olstflrp.d pews,; sparsely occupied by people who n-ey;ef -wJBhed to be crowded under any j possible circumstances, and preferred noj; ' to touch each, other except fn'a'ratn'er' \--distant^ ;;andn 'Conventional , way,' .l.: the ? elaborately, ritualistic, service, and the r cold, superficial religious 'philosophy taught, ,were,aU as fa^. removed, from thfe 'divine Sort'of Mary as the tinsel scenery ?!'of a: stage 'differs from a : natural lands '.' cape, j ,Mi)dred*s , d^epr [and Sorrowful' ex- perience made its unreality painfully . apparent, and unsatisfactory! She rej Bplye'd, however, to try to give the sacred ; .yords ^ha^ v^ould be uttereH, their true ' ^meaning; \\.ancl, in fact,', her sincere devotion was like a simple flower bloom ing' by' tli'e edge of a - glacier. She felt that tbe human lore she brought there and sought to gratify was pure and un selfish, and that in no sense could it be a desecration of thn place and hour. To a nature like hers, her half- pitying love for one so fortunate as Vinton Arnold was almost as sacred as her ;: faith, ^ therefore she had no scruple in watching for his appearance. ? j. .. Her quest -was' unrewarded, liovtever, for ho one entered the pew,r except 'Mr. Arnold and one of his. daughters. The absence of Mrs. Arnold arid: the invalid son filled her with' forebodings and the memory of the past i tlie'iufluence of the place [combined with her fears ; was so depressing that;by the ;time ! the service' ended her tears were' falling-fast1 'behind her 'veil. With liaturalapprension' that her emotion might, be observed she looked hastily around, and, with a start, en countered the' eyes of Rogers Atwoodi Her tears seemed to freeze on her cheeks', and she half shuddered in strong revul sion offeeling. ;' She had ? come to see the man she loved; ? after months' of patientKvaiting; she had at' last 'bo -far yielded to the cravings- of her heart as to seek but a glimpse of oiie who fed her dearest earthly Hope jibufci his ? place is vacant. ? ? In-his- stead i she- 'finds,7' almost at her side, one whom she ilii'ped- never io' see 'again ; and; she knewvhe was offering; 'through' bis darkeyes a^regard loathed in her inmost; soul; ''She was oppressed^ with 'a^ sudden, superstitious fear' that she'conld-notescaoe liim^-^-that he was endowed with such a ?remorseless will and. persistence that by some strange necessity she might yield1 in -spite of herself. ; Belle's1 words; -; He'll /win you yet,' seemed like it direful ? prophecy. How it could ever be fulfilled 'she could not ?'?imagine ; but;'his: ; mere i'ii presence caused a[ flutter of feaif(anditbe'con'sciouBi ness;thatish9 was folldvved^by -a man^re 'feminently gifted with thafc'sntitto power before which' most 6bstacles'rcr'umble made her shiver with an'' 'undefined iread. ' She believed her^veil had 'been no protection— that hejhad seen her emotion, and divined its cause, indeed that notliiag could escape his eyes. She also felt sure that he had come to the city to carry out the projects which he had vaguely outlined to her, and that henceforth she. could never be sure, wheh''away from! home, that his searching -eyes were1 not: upon. her.' ' Howeverwell intp'ntioned liis; motive might be, to her it would be an ndioiia system of Espionage. '^There was 'but'oueffay'in which she could resent !it— by'a^cold; and: steadily' maintained^ 'ihdifference,)'iand'shei'left!i';the' churchi without any- sign of recognitipn, feeling ,that-her lo'wered-.veil should ' have' tauglit' him that shewas ' shunning' observation j ''and'that'lbebad^no right1 to 'watch her.1 She went1 home' not ''only greaily de-! pressed,- but 'incensed, for' it\ was thu' same to her as ? if she' had been intruded ?upon at a'' moment1 of saored ; privacy, arid ;coldlyj scrutinized 'while she was giving way to -feelings that she would hide from all the 'world; ? 1'Hat he 'could not1 know 'this, and 'that!it was^nq' great breach of delicacy for 'a^'young 'mahli.to sit in;the: same ; Church' wilh' a lady1 of ;his ' acquaintance, ?'arid1 even to 'regard ber with sympathy, she did'not' consider. She; was in tiq'mood to do hini justice, 'and circumstan;ces: had imbued her mind witli'infense':'{jrejudice. ;;She'was by:'no means perfect, nor above'yieUlihg to very 'unjnst'prejudices when'tempted to them bv so unwelcome . an interest as that entertained by Koger Atwood.
