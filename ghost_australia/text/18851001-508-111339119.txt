Why Did He Wed Her ? ? BY MBS. SOUTHWOBTH. &UTHOB; OF ' THE HIDDEN HAND,1' 'SELF- MADE,' 'THEB&IDE; OP AS EVENING,' &c.; CHAPTER VIII— (Continued.) Then the table became an altar-, and the 'two women sat down to their devotions. The collect, the epistle, and the gospel were alL read with reverend and- devotional ? voioes. Then- the appropriate prayers were said. And, lastly, the liymn was sang: All ia o'er — the pain, the sorrow, ? Human taunt, and Satan's spite— Beafih shall b'e despoiled tomorrow Of the prey lie grasps to-tight. * Oh, Eoly,' said Palma, when the service 'was over, 'how small and poor and nn 'worjphy do seem all our earthly cares at such ci season as this. I am ashamed to be 'anxious about any earthly event.' 'Yes, sister; time; amen; hallelujah!' responded Mrs. Pole, in her sincerest canip . Jneeting spirit. ' Soon after this they went to bed ; bnt neither of the two to sleep. Palma was wakeful because she was vaguely troubled, she knew not why nor wherefore. Mrs. Pole was wakeful because she was Anxious about her charge. . In the middle of the night she heard Palma tossing on her bed and sighing pro foundly. . She listened for a few minutes, and then perceiving that the girl was still restless, «he spoke : . * Palma, child, what is the matter with you ? Canrt you go to sleep ?' ; * Oh, Poly,' are you also awake ? Have I disturbed you ? Oh, it was so selfish and thoughtless in me to disturb you. I am so ebrry, Poly,' said the girl, in sincere eontri-^ lion. * Kever mind me, deary. Keeping awake won't hurt me, once in a way — «ront hurt me much. But can't you go to sleep, honey ?' * No, I cannot — I cannot.' . ' But why can't you ?' * I am haunted.' 'Haunted?' ' Tes, haunted.' *J$y what, for goodness sake, child? iThere be no ghosts nor nothing in this pleasant house, so what should you be baunted by?' ' Oh, by dreams and visions so gloomy — ch 1 so gloomy, Poly. It seems to me as if Cleve were in some deep trouble or deadly danger. Oh! I wish it were morning — I ?wish it werejnorning,* replied the girl. Mrs. Pole got out of bed, turned up the light of the kerosene lamp, and went to her travelling 'physio box,' muttering to her self: ' I'll soon settle these dreams and visions. Pll give her a dose of chloral. It will make her look awful pale in the morning — it always does, blame it I — but it will give her a good night's rest, anyhow, whereas, if she don't get a good night's rest, she'll not only look pale, but haggard and torn down, whicli will be ever so much worse. So the nurse prepared the sleeping draught, and brought it to the bedside of the wakeful girl, saying : * Here, take this, child. It is Dr. Ames's own prescription for sleeplessness, you know, and it will give yon rest, so you will wake ?up well to-morrow.' Willingly enough Palma swallowed tbe sleeping draught, and was soon buried in repose. ' I think I want one about as much as she does; but I don't propose io weaken my heart. Ko, not if I know it, I don't. loan stand a night's loss of sleep, I reckon, though. I know she couldn't. Very strange, with all the arts, and sciences, aTid the cmleges and the universities, the learned doctors can't find any medicine to cure you in one place that don't kill you in another ! Row, there's laudanum. It will cure pain. Oh, yes, certain, sure, it will Cure pain; but, then, afterwards it allers gets up a little deviltry of its own in your stumntuck, or your liver, or sqine'ers. And so with all thd rest,' said Hr& Pole,-as she turned down the light, and Once more retired 'to bed, and afterwards/ tforfjunjffeBly, fell asleep, ..--* .-? \ : .

Now the sunshine was glinting through ike interstices of the slats in the shutters of the front windows, and showing glimpses of Wne sky and green earth. . „ . , . ..Mrs. Pole left her bed and went over 46 the other corner of iiho i-ooitt fe- Palmate side, and looked upon the sleeping girl* Palma was Pale and fair, as she lay, * smiling in delight,' at some happy dream or vision. Satisfied with the inspection, Mrs. Pole went back, made up her own bed, and then washed and dressed lierself and set the zoom xn order. There was light enough to seeio do all that. * Now the child has slept long enough for tier good, and I will waken her this way/ she said, and opened' the front shutters, Jetting in a flood ttf light.

Mrs. Pole assisted her to rise, and put on the little faded blue cambric wrapper in which she had lived since her illness, then guided her to (&& easy chair by the front window, left her sitting there, and went out and brought her a cup of coffee. 4 Only to begin with, child,' she said. ' Breakfast will be ready soon — fresh mack erel, tenderloin beefsteak, aad rice waffles. And I have got a ; good piece of news for you,.. my. dear. You'll have, your Easter service, after alL There is one of your sort of ministers here — a 'Piscppal — come last night. A very ageable old gentleman ;. too infirm to take a church ; but serves a pulpit once in a while. So the waiter girls say. Yes, honey, him, and his wife as old as him self. She is kin to the people in the house. So the gals told me.' * *. And is he going to hold an Easter ser vice here ?' inquired Palma, as she slowly sipped her coffee. , ' In the big parlor — yes, child.' 'Poly?' ' Did you bring my white lawn dress?' * DIdu't I, honey ? And sprinkle and press it as smooth as smooth could be.' ' Thank you, Poly. It was my confirma tion dress, given to'me two years ago by deai* Mrs. Barrn. Ah, Poly,' I have had to sell nearly all my good clothes to buy food and fuel. Brft that dress I never would pact with. And now I am glad, for I can wear it to the service this morning, and be married in it this afternoon. Poly, you will manage to help me i^ito the parlor and get me seated before the people come in, so that we need not dsetui'b anybody.' * Yes, my child.' 'Row, Poly, dear, bring the books, and wo will have our morning prayers before breakfast,' said the little ritualist. Mrs. Pole believed in impulse and inspira tion, not in rites and regulations; so she grunted, yet she did as she was requested to do. When this ceremony was over she put away the books and said : * I told the girls to set the table in here. It was well enough to use the Jittle sitting room when there was a gentleman with us. But you and me can be more comfortable here.' ? ? 'Yes, indeed, Poly.' A neat young waitress came in and laid the cloth j and arranged ? the table for the morning meal, and then brought it in. No one accustomed to good meals every day of their lives could appreciate the luxu ries of the table as did this poor child, who had been half starved ever since the death of her benefactress. She ate with satisfac tion and delight, and naively said to her attendant : **Oh, Poly, it seems as if every morsel gives me life.' JfThen. the breakfast service had been re moved, Mrs. Pole dressed her ch&rere; for church. 4 Why, Poly dear, you have put a ruffle on the bottom of my dress,' said the girl. 'Had to, my chile. You have growed Eome in height these last two years. And it was too short for.you. Likewise.it would have been too smallin the waist, onlyyou have dwindled so thin, poor dear. I bought that ruffle on Grand-street, Friday night, when I went out shopping. It was already pleated and bound, and it was twenty-five cents a yard, and took only four yards for your gown. I sewed it on^ after you were'asleep last night.* 4 1 ought to call you mother. You are a mother tq me,' said the girl. Palma looked very pretty in her soft white dress, with an early white rose, brought by one of the waiter girls, pinped on her bosom, and with no other ornament but her curling black hair, a lovely contrast to the pale, pure face. A young Saint Agnes she might have seemed to an ancient devotee. 4 Dearie, you are beautiful,' said Mrs. Pole, supporting her as she stood before the dressing lglass. A soft blush at this praise stole into the girl's delicate cheeks and made her prettier still, as she replied — ' Oh, I wish I might be, for Cleve's sake.; And now, how many hours before he will be here ?' * Let me see. It is 10 now, and he said he would be here by 6.' Eight tours to wait ! Oh, it seems so long-' ; 'But you will have the beautiful Easter service you love, bo ^ell. ^.tid then the eermon, and I'll warrant you the reverend doctor will bring ?out the best in his barrel ; and then dinner, arid then the afternoon sleep. r' Aid so the time will .soon pass; 4way .*:'?'??;; ^ ? - ...

'Sure Enough, so he is.* I wonder what have .brought him here half a day too soon, and no parson with him, nuther ?' said Mrs. Pole, with a sudden misgiving in regard, to the gentleman's intentions. But before she could give further expres sion to her doubts, Cleve Stuart had seen his betrothed through 1 the open French windows, and greeted her with a smile and wave of hand. * Oh, how glad I am to see yon so much sooner than I hoped. Come right in heret' exclaimed Palma, as she stood up support isg herself, by one hand on the arm of hei* ohair, while she fitretdhed the otnertowards him. iBpw lovely yon an looking, my child/ I iieFetssaw you JooidngrBo lovely a& tou do tbis^joinin^,' lie^aiafssjie stepped inrongii |ihe wjn3?w^tnd took her 5n his arms sad ^^fj^gs^jly^pn who have ^P%|| tfti&kiem; *5^.^0fttort%r^kflSl^aSi; worthy of your pose self,'- he said^ with a^ sigh- of eencriiion.

You are trembling all over,' said Gl«ve Stuarfc, as he placed her in her easy chair. . '«lt is with happiness, Cleve, with the full great happiness you' give me. , It is too much, you see, for this poor, little, fragile frame of mine,' she answered, with a smile. 4 Bat, sir, you hare not told us how you come so much sooner than we expected you,' said Mrs. Pole. . 4 Oh, good morning, ma'am ! Excuse me for not having seen you. before* The ex planation of my early arrival is easy enough. I saw in this morning's Te&mpetee; that the Rev. Dr. Shepherd was at the Pine Mountain house. It was but a single line in the re ligious intelligence column. But it was enough, to tell me that I need not wait until after tlie moming: services to hunt up a minister whom I might persuade to accom pany me here. So I took a hasty break fast, caught the 8.30 train, and here I am in good, time to attend the services at this house, and.marry my dear girl afterward.' (TO BE CONTINUED.)
