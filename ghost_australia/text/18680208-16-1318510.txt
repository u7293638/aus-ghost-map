AN HOUR AMONG THE REPTILES. AN ADVENTURE IN A LOUISIANA SWAMP. I had been some weeks in Louisiana, and camp life was growing monotonous. No signs of enemies, no little? alarms, no terrible rumors, that go to make up the life of excitement which is the only entertainment the soldier has. But, as I thought an adventure out of the question, I decided on the next best thing. I would explore the neighboring bayou. so I turned to one of my lieutenants, who was sitting lazily at the door of his tent, smoking one of a lot of fragrant Havana that he had just received from New Orleans, and said, Come, Perkins, let's go up the bayous, and see what This con- founded country is like. There are a couple of dug-outs ' down at the water's edge that are just fitted for a cruise among the swamps." "Too hot, captain," was the drawling answer. " Hot !" I reported. " Why, man, that is just the place to keep cool !" "But it will require so much exercise to paddle The canoe," he pleaded, taking his cigar out, and whistling the smoke into little rings above and around his head, I saw there was no use in talking ; so I took a cigar, lighted it, and started alone. The " dug-out " which I confiscated for my cause was a canoe of primitive fashion, hol- towed out from a log, and required dexterous management to keep from upsetting. But I was confident in my own powers, and pushed boldly off into the sluggish waters of thorny. Once fairly afloat, I balanced my treacherous craft as best I could, and paddled slowly along beneath the ghostly cypress limbs, and through the slimy growth of the species of woods known as the river sponge. The noonday gem of mid- summer shed but little boat, and the air was of a delicious temperature. The scenery was magnificent. Mighty ancient oaks were there, seen through openings on either side, trellised by a profusion of wild, luxuriant vines j while near at hand were the cypresses and holly trees and the clouds of grey Spanish moss, stocked with the bright red berries that hung in its midst, looking like coral beads almost smothered in a dream of rich lace. Dead and dying pines stood here and there and fire blasted cedars, whose trunks, grim and gaunt, and pallid, poured through the emerald wealth, and Stretched forth spectral limbs to give an imaginary command. I had placed several miles between myself and the camp, and had left the comparatively free waters of the bayou, nOAV steering here and there among the underbrush, and logs and cy- press balls that made it more like a morass or swamp, when suddenly an alligator's shiniiigerost appeared above the surface of the water, not more than two or three rods in advance of me. My first intimation of its presence was on seeing it appear before me for it swims so noiselessly that one can never detect its presence by our. An alligator, unless hungry, will not attack a human being, but will make great exertions to got out of the way ; but this one had not seen me yet, and I determined to have a shot. So I produced my revolver, and discharged it at him ; but the ball glanced from his scaly hide as though he had been protected by steel armour. In an instant, the whole morass was alive with saurianB, each frightened by the explosion, and each making frantic exertions to reach their familiar paths leading to more secluded waters. Their gleaming hides darted from every nook and cranny, and rose from all sides. One rose immediately at the side of my canoe, showing his black wrinkled head in such close proximity that I shuddered as I levelled my pistol at him, sighting his eye. Whiz event the bullet, hitting the mark, and the monster sunk instantly. I then discharged the remaining barrels of my revolver at the nearest of the score or more of fleeing monsters, and paddled towards a clump of cypresses to take an observation of affairs. But my eyes were not bent very closely upon my landing-place, and I run my canoe upon a ten-foot alligator that had Bought shelter and refuge by plunging his nose between the roots of the tree. Feeling my " dug-out " run so un- ceremoniously upon his back, he gave his huge tail a flap, and backed into deeper water, leaving me but an instant in which to spring on a log embedded near the shore as my craft upset. Hero, taking an observation, I found my position was not an enviable one. I retained the paddle of my canoe j but the canoe itself was half submerged some fifty feet distant. The log on which I stood was fast and firm, but some twenty feet of slimy, murky water separated it from the shore. Spying near me one of those curious vegetative freaks known as " cypress boil," I steadied myself with the paddle and planted my foot cautiously upon what proved to be a safe and friendly support. I Then I soon gained a ridge of spongy soil, which grow longingly about the roots of a cypress, whoBO gnarled trunk was thick with aged moss, which I had just grasped with one hand, while with the other I still held the paddle, when I heard a rustling overhead, and instantly felt that I had worse enemies than alligators to deal with. Glancing up, I spied the body of a large vario , gated snake, coiled around the tree not ten feet above me. Instantly glancing down again, to 1 see my chance for escape, my eyes settled upon another one, coiled up, and apparently asleep, upon the dark green turf. A glance showed me that it was a moccaBin-snake. Oh, the horrid, sickening feeling that came over me at that moment ! My harrow of snakes is most terribly acute, and I stood paralysed for a moment. Thought refused, for an instant, to act, and, when it did, I still stood motion leas. I seemed perfectly helpless. If I struck at the one asleep at my feet, the other would strike at me before I could reach him, and vice versa. I dared hardly move, I for fear the one at my feet should wake, and then I would have two pair of serpents' eyes, instead of one, glittering upon me. A faintness crept over me, and I grasped the mossy trunk of the tree. Then I felt strong again, and I knew there were but two ways of escape-one by retreating the way in which I had come the other, to load my revolver, and trust to luck to hit them both before one could strike. I felt for my ammunition, and heard a rustling again above me. I glanced up, and beheld the glistening head and forked tongue thrust downwards, while the eyes Seemed like a molten lava of emeralds. Then I felt a terrible instinct to return their gaze. I thought of stories of snake It charmers, and kept my eyes fixed on I proceeded silently to load my revolver. But I had not 1 made more than the first necessary motion before the serpent's tail was flung around a higher limb, and its crest curved angrily around a coil of spiral rings.. Mechanically I stopped to avoid the threatened spring ; and, as I did so, the body of the snake was suddenly depressed, and then it glided up the trunk and disap- poured Wondering as well as grateful, I proceeded dexterously to load my revolver, intending to kill the other, and then see what my chance of escape might he had taken aim at those cumbent head, and was about to slay or it with a ball when my quick eye detected a sound of paddies a little distance off I stopped and listened The sound was unmistakable And then suddenly a clear voice rang out on the stillness of the air, and I caught the words - 'Down upon do Sara Dixon Oh do gold and sliver mauser - l\ ay down on do barn, lent on Oil do good and silv ct amuses Day 1 went w id my own Iviuicv, Sailing in de " Oh, good Lord, what did?" the old darkey screeched, interrupting himself, as I shouted out a tennis ball I had no idea of having this person, whoever he was, after having come so closely to me, go off without assisting me, so I shouted again, after the echoes of the darkey s exclamation had died away " Who's dal, and what do debbil you want ?" he returned a little sharply " To go for lo skeer old ring in day at style ' ' By this time the canoe had come along pretty closely, and I recognised in its occupant old son, a slave o on a neighboring plantation Oh do mighty gracious" he shouted as soon as he spied an " O do good Lord, Mauasa Cap'n is that you ever dear ?

to Tyler, Texas, where, in consequence of of hard treatment, he became insane Meantime, news went home that he had been killed, and his regimental muster roll bore out the rumor His young bride

Children should be induced to practise the virtues which it is intended they shall possess, and by practice they should be endowed with good propensities and good habits If parents would but feel that it is as essential to teach a child to practise the virtues that are desirable as it is to cultivate the mind, and would give as much attention to the early development and proper exercise of the affections and passions, and take that pains to develop all the natural excellencies of his character they do to accelerate his progress in knowledge, we should soon see a great and pleasing change in the disposition and conduct of men But now, in very many families the greatest praise is not bestowed upon those children that are merely good, but upon those whose minds are most active and premature In Schools much of the praise and censure, reward and punishment, connected with early mental culture, is calculated to awaken rivalry, envy, and hatred Moral culture is sacrificed in early life to intellectual, and the bad passions are called forth to aid the mind's improvement, and then what originates from a faulty or neglected moral education is considered the fault of nature itself. But nature has not had fair play.
