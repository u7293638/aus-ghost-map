CEREMONY <?F SECUVg.G \- TORRE TOL A THE talant 1 theSisters ... first time in South' Australia qn Tuesday, August 5,. in the Convent of Mercy, Angafistreet, and was witnessed by number of people who attended in the pretty little Chapel lately added to the building. Thfe Sisters of Mercy have a world-wide fam& for deeds of chanty and tenderness, although the Order only dates back as far as 1828, when it was founded in Dublin by Catherine McAuley, who was the first Superior of the Institute of ReligiouB Sisters of Mercy, aha who fnlly acted up to the creed she professed when she said—''God knows I would rather be cold and hungry than that His poor should suffer want" Her memory, We are told, is still held in benediction by the poor of th& city in which she passed her short but full xebgious career, and her history shows that she was folly fitted by her piety and talents to accomplish the .great philanthropic work npon which she embarked with such well-directed zeal and energy. Catherine McAuley -was born on the Feast of St. Michael, September 29, 1787, .at Stormontftown House,- -County Dublin, and her parentsboth belonged to -ancient and respectable Catholic .families. The history of her career of benevolence •wonld fill pages. She inte^ rested herself in movements for the amelionty tion of the condition of the poor.. It ivai through her exertions that the public hosptr teds of the period were thrown open to all religious bodies that chose to visit them, and after having become prominent " in deeds of unassuming charity she founded the Order of Merey in Dublin, selecting that name'herj self, and henceforth she and her children were known aB Sisters of Mercy. An Order of Mercy had already existed in the Church, dating back indeed as far as 1223, when Peter Nolasco, a noble Spaniard, touched with the miseries of poor Christian slaves under the Moors, founded an Order for their relief^ and drew np the rules for the "Boyd Mfffc tary and Bieligions. Order pf -Gpir Lady or Mercy." The objects of thiB Order were works of mercy, especaally the^demption of captives, each member being'; bound to exchange biinself for a «aptive«h6sld therp be; no other means^of ransom. But we have to 1 deal with modern "heroines', not the heroes of the Middle The Sisters of Mercy of the present day do deeds of self-Bacrifice ually noble-arid from' as aB pure motives _ , as those performed by the Order referred tb. Their mission, is to renounpe "all' world vanities, cast aride all . consideration lor 1 Bel and. go forth to comforjt the despairing. suC- r mmi cour 1 * - the '41m • sick, MrtU , ^ bmd liivrA nD'tiie t ^Iib hcrts Uwl l ff of w rthe. 1 -f? wounded, te»:h thp" ignorant,and "perform generally 1 thbse acts of tendernesa for which '4ioly wbinen cure BQ>, 'fitted.

Chapel on Tuesday; The postulants were^ Miss Bodgers, from Kapunda .{now Sister ' Mary Agnes), and Miss O'Sullivan (ndwr , Sister Marv Agatha), sister of Father O^Snllivan.

They have been studying in 1 : the Convent of Mercy for some six months,. and after taking the white veil must remain-.' in novitiate for two years before they take ' the black veil and bind themselves byiTre- 1 vocable vows to the mission of mercy. When. : a youi^ lady wishes to . enter a convent shefint lays before her confessor the state of her mind; and he, aiffcer full deliberation and- 1 several interviews, decides as to whether she is actuated by a mere- passing devotional impulse or a true' call to a religious life. By ! his advice she speaks to her parents, ana ; next sees the Mother Superior ofthe convent^ from whom she.4khteins_all the requisite in- ' formation. "After" that, with the Bishop's^ sanction, she enters as. a postulant, viz., asone who entreatstplbe admitted to theOrder.
