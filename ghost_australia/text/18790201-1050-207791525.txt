As if this were not plain enough, it' is ' added— " It was not -jilting that Christ alone should give Himselt to the regeneration of men ; and' so it was necessary that a woman, Mary, like unto Him, should be given Him; that with her and by her all the regeneration and adoption of the sous of God- should take place." " She merited by congruity the salvation of the whole world;' not only because s/ie bore Christ, but because she gave to us Him whom : she had borne and who ivas truly hers, and for- us she offered him to. death.

Let us start with the Apostles Peter and Paul, when they went out to preacii the gospel of Jesus Christ; arid -to convert the Jews to the new and Reformed religion. -They were "apostates".themselves from, the religion; and-law of Moses ; . and tliey. laboured to multiply.'the..'.' apostates" oy einpiy.ing tne synagogue , anci tempie and bringing the' people over ! to ' the new Church of (Christ.7"lieVus see what the got from" the priests'of'Meses-the'des ants of, tH© Qbd'-lappoih'ted .

We don't believe such' monsters of . hard-heartedness are to be found among even- the most barbarous of people; yet this is precisely the hard- heartedness of the Church of Rome ! She pretends that her masses give the souls of the dead repose, and yet she measures out that repose according to the number of the masses that "rare,, said !

Is it because it is more difficult for rich men. to get repose than. „for poor men ?: , The answer; is obvious, and the - poor Catholics are beginning to see that there is a very plain' reason for the , difference.- The ..poor Catholics, die,; and they get; .some shabby, common, and obscure : priest to say "the prayers over them ; but when a big map dies, Dr. Yaughan sets agoing, all/the grandeur of his ; church to get repose? of- soul: for him. Is not the splendour- well paid for?
