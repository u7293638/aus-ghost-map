THE MEDICAL CLAIRVOYANT IMPOSTURE IN MELBOURNE. It Mahoell-S. IL During my first interview with a medical clairvoyant, I had naturally some doubt in my mind as to whether He would see through it or 1 through him As events unfolded themselves however, to try thing was clear to me if it was not to the practitioner Ah then I called up li the. professor in Jjiat Melbourne whom I had never seen before, I found him to be a middle aged nails 01 quiet manner and devoid of mu disposition to ei put me on the beauties of the art by the practice of which he does so w til There is us nothing about him to suggest the seer except that his eyes were slightly strained and blood-not as though accustomed to be hard worked in some mental short list was of unprofessional aspect and I have been told that some time ago he was employed as a photographic. colourist. lit told me that he saw a great many patients three were sitting in the ty must, room when I entered the house When my turn came I call ed into the Consulting room and stated to the man of science that I had a lock of Gladys hair which I wished him to own he to me in the clairvoyant, manner I did not contest the _. v. or the owner of the lock, because it was hue silly hair, and any person touching it would pronounce that it belonged to a fear nine head Besides, in the first interview both as regards his own case and that of the lock of hair, I wanted to give the professor every possible show for making a success well knowing that I could increase the severity of the tests afterwards 'the clairvoyant seated himself in an easy chair, and requested me to taken seat close by at a little table, on which there were writing materials ready for my use When he sat down he asked me to place the ball on a little table close to his right hand. He saw where I put it and he was afterwards able to pick it up without difficulty with his ties closed The first part of the business was for him to get himself into a ' trance A patient had felt the room as I entered it, and he had been in a france three minutes back, before I saw how easily the whole thing was accomplished, I felt some pity for a man who had to rack himself for the benefit of patients so frequently -he professor sighed heavily once or twice made a few rapid passes over his forehead with his hands which were made to tremble as though agitated by electrical currents emitted a sound like a choking sob and said he was ready to begin, it I was prepared in the language of his sect he had now passed the bounds of his own corporally, and entered into support or relation with object-inuniveisalnature Hisfacultjofintro vision had become excited into that of extra vision extending to and into objects and individualities near and remote in space and time And how simply it was all done I was amazed to find that a man could free his soul from his body at will by a few hand passes Seeing a pencil I endeavoured to recover my equanimity and prepared to write down the deliverance of the ghosts seen being an expert shorthand writer I was able to take down every word that was uttered, but the professor spoke slow!., like one remembering a lesson or describing objects imperfectly seen and I could have recorded his remarks with equal accuracy in long lines with the lady's hair (a substantial tress Gin or Um long) pressed close to his forehead, the ' clairvoyant having intimated that he was going to describe the internal organs of the owner of the hair beginning with the brain, proceeded in his ordinary tone of voice and with his eyes shut as follows - ' our brain IS healthy The lungs are sound and free from disease At the present time they are surrounded with mucous caused by cold the air cells, with the exception of the results of the cold, are healthy The bronchial tube is sound The heart is not very strong and at times you have pains around it it is not exactly diseased, but there is certainly a weakness (here the professor uneasily pressed his left waistcoat), and any great ex titementor lifting n eights might be danger i us the liver is fairly health) The bile and so keen are in good condition "_ on suffer a great deal with obstruction round the Kidneys, causing pain in the lower part of the back (The unfortunate professor showed indications of suffering severely in the region named ) The bladder is slightly contracted through the nervous irritation in the kidneys there appears to be a sympathetic relation with the kidneys and the heart. The times Union of the blood is uneven, and at times was asmodic Sometimes it is slow, some times it is quick, and it will cause cold feet and cold hands with sometimes in throbbing at the top of the head, I sometimes a throbbing at the back of the head and a ringing sound in the left ear I he nervous system is strong but as you are of a nervous temperament it is easily thrown out of order She has a good constitution, and if she could get the kidneys more active the heart stronger, and the circulation more active she would grow stronger There is no disease in the system The professor then said he would answer my questions I liked to put I asked him to state the lady stage He replied - ' I can only judge the age by the appearance of the ore is. She appears to be about 31 or 10 If her nerves are strong but very finely strung Mie may have nervous excitement at times In the foregoing deliverance I have omitted nothing but one sentence about a common place a tal ness of a kind u Inch is only fitted for a medical journal Non to compare the original with the description, the owner of the lock of hair is years of age, she has an excellent con- situation, and has not been under medical treatment since childhood But the foregoing diagnosis is so well confined to vague "moralities that it might fit a great many people and when I afterwards read over to her the portions which it was possible to discuss with her she seemed to be impressed with some of the statements She said she had had no cold for a very long time, and did not think there could be any matches in her lungs but He had often thought her heart was not strong and like every other woman, she occasionally had pain in the lower part of the back She never had any pains in the head, but she had often had a ringing sound in one of her ears, she could not remember which So that all the fact that could be seized upon in this list of v vague generalities is very small When it came to a specific thing like the use of the patient the clairvoyant was completely out On res ling over the diagnosis to an allopathic medical friend of high standing in the city, he informed me that this description might hardly be given of nine women out of ten in "case health without danger of making, any noticeable mistake and that ringing in the ears p mis in the back, and feeling of well as, round the heart, We, were every dm symptoms The professor while still in the supposed state of h matism, ordered the following inscription A poultice of camomile (low onto be placed round the heart Ino ounces of jumper berrie- 4oz. of princes pine log? of tanss 1 ozs of ragwort, put into "It parts of water simmer slowly for 10 minutes then strain them, and when cold take one wineglass full three times a day for II feel it added- The irregularities arise from want of proper exercise There is a withering crust round the 1 idea- As a matter of fact the lads and s three or four times every day and enjoys splendid health When r ton the professor that I had no more questions to ask he deliberately unwound himself by a few hand passes over the forehead and allowed his P. us to to enter the earthly house of its taber nick In answer to a question from mc after he had opened his eyes lit -and he never remembered a word of what he said in true Its run! me as a little curious how ever that the first observation he made to me in his waking state was Do you require a medicine which sounded too much like Wl|| you last tll0 nfscriptionmaileup' I declined to have any medicine. Before leaving the room I had my own physiological horoscope taken but lest anyone should be alarmed about the state of health of the lady I have spoken of, I will complete her case first, and state what happened in regard to her on two subsequent occasions Alter an interval of two days I called on the same professor again and presented the same lock of hour he had prouoUblj had under cr animate >n yes, of course, recognised me. He did not make any remark about former visit, and I do not think he looked at the hair When he had gone through the formula of putting himself into what he is pleased to call a trance he applied the lock in his forehead I should mention that since the previous visit I had cut down the tress to half its former length, and changed the silk with which it was tied -later he had applied the hair to his forehead for some seconds he said in a questioning hereof we), Diereis much the same influence about this lock is about the one you brought the other day I had I, " ! his is the sister of theotherlaJj His clairvoyance, however, did not enable him to detect the deceit and he went on with his description of the organs of the owner of the lock as follows -' The brain is in a fairly healthy state but through menial work it is often exhausted The causes depression and heavy mess in the head She must have suffered with a severe illness when about nine or ten years old It has left a weakness in the nervous system and often affects the brain 'His illness must have been some fever The lungs are sound but not very strong They are free from disease, and the air cells are free from mucous There is a weakness in the lower part of the lungs, and any cold and chill would be sure to settle there. She must guard against that The bronchial tube is not very strong There is an irritation in the lower part of the throat some times causing a dryness and hoarseness in the voice The heart is free from disease, but its action is weak at times causing the circulation of the blood to be sluggish The spleen and bile are in fair condition She must have been thrown out of a trap some time ago and hurt her left arm, for there is a weakness there (the professor pressed the upper part of his left arm about the shoulder, as though he had an uncomfortable feeling there ) 'I he digestive organs are in a fair condition. The kidneys are not strong, and in about the same condition as those of the lady we examined two days ago There is obstruction and sediment there, causing irritation and contraction in the bladder I recommend her to put a. hot compress over these parts at night, and to take the following prescription -log, of wood betony, lot of agrimony, lot of broom tops 4oz of tansy Put them into two pints of cold water, allow them to boil up, strain, and when cold take a wineglassful three times a day after meals 'These ingredients, I may mention, are common herbs, which used to be prescribed by old women in England and Scot- land 200 years ago A dose of the "thick and slab ' mixture from the witches cauldron in " Macbeth " would be just as serviceable The professor con timed -"'There is also a weakness in the spine, that would arise from the weak state of the nervous system The stomach is weak and not regular " In answer to my question as to the age of the lady, and if she were married or single, the professor made answer "Looking at the system I should say she is about '26 If married, I do not think she has been married long The back of her head is affected by the kidneys at times, and that will cause a weakness of the spine as well This account of the lady is in some respects directly contradictory of the other By accident the clear seeing man hit upon her right age this time though on the previous occasion he was wrong by 10 years He was also wrong in describing her as newly) married, she is single Allopathic medical acquaintances inform me that the spine and kidnejsnfeverj safe things to go upon as seats of weakness, especially in the case of women It is true that this lady had scarlet fever when about 4 years of age, but it was epidemic at the time, and nearly all children at that age have a lever of some kind just as most children at an earlier age have measles Whooping cough, measles, and scarlet fever are the diseases of childhood The lady was never thrown from a trap nor did she, as far as she can remember, ever suffer any injury to the left arm. She was thrown from a horse some years ago, and sustained a permanent injury to a small bone in the little finger of the left hand I fail to see any connexion between the two things, however There is one very striking contradiction between the two diagnoses The first says the lungs are surrounded with mucous caused by cold According to the second the air cells are free from mucous It is a very long time since the lady had any dry ness or hoarseness in the voice, though at this time of the year that would be a good guess to make in regard to most people This same lock of hair was submitted to the professor jet a third time by a friend of mine who visited him for the purpose, taking also a lock of my own hair My friend has supplied me with the following account of the interview - On seeing the 'Chair you and, I stated that I did not come on my own behalf, but that of two friends in the country I wished to know whether he could give information regarding them from locks of their hair' "The 'Clairvoyant said Certainly ' We then sat down at a small table he on one side and on the other I did not want to let him see either of the locks of hair until he had gone ' off, but as he asked me for one of them I could not refuse without showing some suspicion I then gave him the lad) a lock, and he placed it on a chair beside him A child could tell that it was in woman's hair from its appear- once and texture The clairvoyant in a minute or two went off,' and then do livered (or was delivered of the following - " The hair is that of a lady I will commence with the brain, and go through the different organs, and afterwards you can ask me any questions The brain is fairly healthy The cells of the brain are well nourished They have (sic) a depression at times on the top of the head, that arises more from the state of the internal organs than on the head. The lungs are sound but weak, and there appears to be a great deal of mucous round the air cells, causing tightness in the chest and an irritable cough The bronchial tube is sound, but not very si root, I he heart is sound and healthy, so are the arteries round it the digestive organs are weak, and often cause pains near the heart The liver 13 in a fairly healthy state, but is subject to attack s caused by the sluggish action. The kidneys are not very active and Ruder with pains across the back They are, however, free from disease the blood is weak, and the circulation is not very good The nervous system is fairly health) In answer to a question as to the lady stage and as to whether she is married or single he said Judging from her appearance I should say she is about 22 j ears of age and that she is married As I have already stated the lad) is 21 and unmarried The clairvoyant ordered her the following prescription this time -of lesson to, agrimony lo/ here bound for runs) Mix them all together and pour over the three pints of boiling water Allow them to stand for a time and then strain them, and take a w wineglassful three times a day when there is a tightness on the chest has now sufficiently familiar with the medical clairvoyant business to know that though the prescriptions differ there is strong family likeness between thediiUjiioses 01 feminine cases 1 nevertheless wanted to hear what another clairvoyant would say, so I took the same lock of hair to a pretty flower! this soil; who lives 111 a business street of the 1 it) Ihissccond clairvoyant scarcely deigned to make any pretence of mystery He did not put himself through in its! rate process of "going oil but simply made two or three passes, and pressed the lock of hair to his forehead When speaking his eyes were some times open and sometimes shut. When he had lifted the lock to his forehead he asked, ' She is about 30 years old or under middle age, is she not'' I said "Yes though her real age is 21 He remarked. "I want to be certain I have got the right person ' Then he asked, " She is not confined to her bed, is she I replied that she was not As he had now got very good data to go upon, I did not expect much from the deliverance. If you know the patient's age and that she is not ill enough to be confined to her bed it is tolerable plain sailing The 'ster then gave the following description of the patients organs bpeaknigaluwl), as though thinking it out Sometimes when he paused and seemed parted he pressed the lock closer to Ina forest id for renewed inspiration His he it appears to be strong, but it is not very strong in its action it is a little soft about the valves, due to the state of the nervous system The org sis are organically) of rong but the circulation is not good in the davit) of the chest lhtlivtrisaiittlelausuid therein want of tone in the middle part of the stomach The stomach recei v as food well enough but in passing it to the presenter) it is not properly mixed with the juice there is weakness about the sacrum the pelvis and the back of the abdominal cavity which affects the circulation of the uterine system The blood is wanting in tone and fluent) In the small veins the circulation is languid I do not notice any acute s) symptoms. but has no severe pain It does not seem a temporary de rangement but one which has continued for some little time It is a case that wants constitutional treatment She does not want pit) are, but medicine if you understand what I mean the glands of the liver and stomach must be sent!) stimulated to make more and better blood and she must have a uterine tonic. The spine should be rubbed with a soft warm hand, and perhaps a little cocoanut oil The diet should be of the stronger kinds of grain, such as oatmeal, wheatmeal, barley, added to tender juicy meat, and she must have regular walking exercise ' In conclusion, the clairvoyant wrote out a pre scription embodying the above, and adding a decoction of simple herbs, chiefly concern and even. If this diagnosis is closely examined, it will be found to consist of common places which might safely be guessed at in regard to any woman, and to contain not a few absurdities For instance, the circulation could not be different in the cavity of the chest from what it is elsewhere It is ridiculous to speak of want of tone being confined to the middle part of the stomach It must be the whole stomach or no part of it. The other weaknesses referred to are generalities, and safe things to say about any woman The statement that the circulation is languid in the small veins, as distinguished from the other veins has no physiological basis The diagnosis is largely occupied with feminine weaknesses because these are the sort of cases on which the medical clairvoyant is chiefly consulted We have now had this lock of hair examined three times The accounts given of the patient in each instance are grossly con tradictory, while largely confined to safe generalities A number of ailments are attributed to the lady which she never had. She has a very strong constitution, is in blooming health, and has not been under medical treatment since infancy But what would be her condition were she to take the three different prescriptions which two medical clairvoyants have now told her are necessary for her recovery from purely imaginary maladies The lad) herself showed symptoms of a little feminine credulity when I read over portions of the first diagnosis to her Now that she has seen the three different statements, she is fully satisfied that medical clairvoyance as practised in Melbourne is an utter sham
