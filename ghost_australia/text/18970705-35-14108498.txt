AMUSEMENTS. -.- I I HER MAJESTY'S." A NIGHT OUT. [ The French, to whom " A Night Out " is so obviously due, have invented several neatly dubious forms of compliment, two of the most familiar of which may be tendered in English as " a success of esteem " and " a success of curiosity " For the 2)arbculir form of riotous fared on the broadest possible lines typified by " A Night Out," and others of the Palms Royal echos, we should like to apply yet a third termed' a success of laughter " After the opening scene on Saturday the most trivial incidents served all the purposes of the highest mt, and the immense audience which crowded every part of Her Majesty's Theatre indulged in the most un- restrained hysterical laughter that we recollect hearing in any playhouse for a long time past Of course, to people who are touched by the influences of literary style, the descent from the grace of Ditmas' " Francillon " to the horse-play of " A Night Out "-which is like " Pink Dominoes," only more so-was in the nature of the " short, sharp shock" referred to by W S Gilbert But fortunately for theatrical managers the general taste is very far from fastidious and audiences which very properly enjoy the innocent mirth and genuine bit of such pieces as " Dandy Dick " or '. In liberal parties, are apparently even more delighted with the equivocal situations and broad fun of " A Night Out " to " popular " success on Saturday was quite beyond dispute-such a SUccess of laughter "* has not been seen for years The new play is a condensed version of " L'Hotel du Libre change," by MM Georges Feydeau and Maurice Dosvalhcrca, which was first produced in New York with emendations by Charles Prob m inn and is now enjoying a run in London that has already exceeded a period of 10 months In Sydney the piece will owe its vitality chiefly to the droll solemnity of Mr Harry Paulton The new actor, whose stage manner resembles that of Mr William Elton, makes many of his points by the absurd contrast both. cou what no says and his manner of saying it He is a first-rate comedian, and made himself perfectly at home with his now audience before he had been on the stage 10 minutes The central character of the French farce is Joseph Pinglet, ii. master builder, afflicted with a domineer- ing wife Angdiquo, and a fascinating neighbour, Marcelle, wife of his friend Paillard The boats of the multifarious complications of the story is Mar collo's confession to Pinglet that her husband " has the heart of an oyster," and systematically neglects her. The physical contrast between Marcelle and Pinglet is the prime cause of laughter Marcelle, in the person of Miss Alma Stanley, makes quite an Amazonian display of charms, whereas Mr Paul ton, as Pinglet, is made up as a mere caricature of a man, so that his declaration in a loud hard voice, " I am romantic, I am dashing, I am impassioned, I am a Romeo, the I don't look it proves irresistibly funny Piuglot, having arranged to take the fair Marcelle to a surreptitious supper at a restaurant, has the audacity to severely lecture her husband upon his neglect of so charming a spouse He even adds (with a droll look at the gallery), " Mind, if your wife plays you false, don't blame me I mean don't say I don t warn you'" Betwcou Pinglet and the meeting with Marcelle at the restaurant, however, he innumerable obstacles Laughter reaches its height when Pinglet, locked in by his wife during her absence for the evening, leaves his room by the fire escape, and so the first act closes The Hotel Mascotte, with a supper-room on the right, ascending and descending staircases in the middle, and a large bedroom with three beds and inner dressing rooms on the left, forms the scene of the laughable escapades which follow All the characters of the farce assemble at this reliving point in the most natural way possible Pinglet is in the supper-room with his lady love Paillard (the husband who is inspecting the hotel in his capacity of architect, enters after a while to throw himself in a half-intoxicated condition upon a bed, where he is concealed by a curtain , Victoime, Pinglot's maid, in supping with Minter Maxine, Pnillard's schoolboy nephew. and old Mathieu is on the premises with his four daughters Mathieu, a provincial bore with a dreadful station to which he is subject only when it came, has v. ordered to these fast Parisian supper-rooms under the impression that he is at a family hotel His girls " do their hair in the outer bedroom and then retire to rest The situations which follow may be readily imagined by any old playgoer The authors keep up the full the nature of which we have explained to the end of the third act, where the ingenious way in which Pinglet ser% as police summons! s for supplying after hours upon his innocent wife and the barnbODiled husband forms the most screaming situation of the whole piece Mr Harry Paulton, in his own peculiar way, scores all along the line in " A Night Out " He is seen in the supper-room with Marcelle struggling with flower) speeches uttered in the prosaic tones of a cattle salesman, which hardly conceal the fact that he is labouring under some disabling form of illness At last he lets the audience into the secret-" Why, oh why, did I make that cigar 9 " Even Marcelle has to be informed-" Oh, let me walk ' Oh, if it would only pass off ' Haven't they any balcony or place where they keep fresh air in this hotel p " His despairing moans and groans to the lovely woman at his side who is very hungry and wants her supper set the house in a roar At last, after having been completed in the back by an inquisitive waiter, who is making a hole in the wall to find out what all the fuss is about poor Pinglet goes upstairs Later Mr Paulton makes the most of the opportunity for desDairful tun afforded on Pinglat's return by the unexpected presence in the supper-room of old Mathieu and his four girls Even they are eventually got rid of, but still Pmglet's meditated gallantry has perforce to remain in abeyance Old Lothian returns to the room again and again, first for a candle, then for a hot-water bottle Pinglet would give away a fortune to got rid of the In trusts of bore Don't let me deprive you " is Mathieu's remark as honalks off with the hot bottle " so depravity, I assure you," was Ping of s answer at which point the audience again grow hysterical The apparition of the four girls in their nightgowns, of Paillard mad with fear at these ghosts of a haunted chamber, of Pinslet with his face blacked to avoid detection by Paillard, of Marcelle with a man's high hat drawn down to her chin, and of the police taking all and sundry into custody under false names closes the second act In the last act, where all the di hearts we who arrive home with black eyes, Mr Paulton is excruciatingly funny in his denunciation of the innocent Mme Pinglet, who somehow becomes implicated in his misdoings and kneels to him for pardon "Away, false woman, ' screams the actor , and then apos- trophies with the remmark " She is no longer young, she was never beautiful the rest of the speech being drowned in the daughter of the audience probably) owing to similar experiences Mr Paulton shouted a great deal, and the whole performance by all the actors was one of the noisiest we have Itcuid The are a number of comparatively subsidiary parts Miss Alma Stanley's handsome physique told well in the character of Marcelle which she plays in the French style, rather understanding than slumng over the difficult pieces, and by no means concealing the fact that Marcello intended to go the pace " Miss Stanley is evidently an actress of considerable experience Mr Ernest Shand, made up as old Mathieu, with fleecy white hair and whiskers, a red face and gleaming teeth, comically expressed the difficulties or a man who stammers lifting up his leg in the middle of a word and replacing it on the ground at the moment of completing the recalcitrant si liable Thus, to the porter with his box, What's the dam-dam-ríam-dainago °" caused a great explosion of merriment Mrs Edouin Brj er was admirably placed as the stern, formidable, and done neering Augebque Mr Cecil Ward played cleverly as Paillard, and Miss Louie Stafford proved a pretty and my actions I cretonne Mention may be made of an effective cast of minor parts as follows -H) a circle Violette, Rose (Mathieu'a daughters), Miss Joey Cassells, Miss Lila More, Miss E Horne M'Rao Marguerite, Miss Carrie Moore Maxime Park- and nephew), Mr C.
