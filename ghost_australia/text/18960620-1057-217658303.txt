8ELEOTED POETRY. ' Late Verse. A OHILLY NIGHT, 1 I roeo at Ifao dead of night, ' v And wont to tho lattlco alono To look for my mother's ghost Whoro tho ghostly moonlight shone. ' My friends had failed ono by ono, \- uiddlo aged, young ana old, \- Till tho ghosts wcro warmer to mo " : ' - Than my frlonds that had grown cold . : > I looked and I-saw tho ghosts V Dottin'g plain and mound They stood In tho blank moonlight, . , . . But no shadow lay on tho ground Thoy spofeo without a voloo , And thoy leaped without a sound. I called Oh my Mother dear,1 1>— ' I sobbod : " Oh my Mother kind, Make a lonely bed for tnd And shelter it from the wind." <( Toll tho others not to como To seo mo night or day ; 'But I need not tell my frionds To bo auro to keep away." ". My mother raised her oyes, ' Thoy woro blank and could not see . ' Tot thoy hold mo with their staro,. . ; Whilo thoy soomod to look at mo. \- She opened her mouthand spoko» . I oould not hear a word, WbUo my flesh oropt on my bones And ovory hair was stirrod. Sho know that I oould not hear ' Tho mossngo that sho told, v Wholher I had long to wait Or soon should sleep in tho mould ; I saw her toBs hor shadowless hair And wring hor hands in tho oold. A strained to catoh her words, ' ' And sho strained to mako mo hoar But novor a sound of words Fell on my straining car. From midnight to tho oookorow \- 1 kept my watoh In pain, Whilo tho subtlo ghosts grow subtler An tho snd night on tho wane. From midnight to tho cookorow .1 watchod till all were gone, Some to slcop in tho shifting sea And. some under turf and stone ; Living had failed and dead bad failed, ' ' And I was indeed alone. u> —-Christina Rosseixi.
