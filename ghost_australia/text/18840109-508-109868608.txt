'The -$e-Bple of the iclistiict-'fqr MiMk found 'do at' this moment most imnlieiiiv believe that the^ extraordinary manifestations -described ias-hkvlhg' taken place-Sat the'WdodTarin/West^ Lullingfield, a fortnight ago, are dueto super natural 'canses,-axLd probably many of them wfll cbntinae-to believe for -tJie rest of their natural; lives, this-full and minute explanation notwith standing. St-is already notorious that Farmer Hampson and his 'family -were, on .the morning of October 31 last, thrown into -a state of consternation 'at finding the furniture of 'their 'house 'to Tje ?suddenly 'Irafeued with powers t-f ^locomotion, .and 'their astonishv ment was nnbounded, when, on what . they believed to be ttie evidence 'of t3ieir own eyesight, 'the hands of the* eight^day clock in the kitchen sprang -through-its- glass ^front, and immediately returning whence-they came, slapped- that unof fending chronometer Sharply in the face. -Then, so it is said, the fire leaped out of the grate and burned the babyi and the chairs, : linking arms, dancedround and round -the table, and the firer irons, mounting upon the -dresser, cut a' series of nimble capers, as if determined to add to the general confusion by a private exhibition of gym nastic ironmongery. - All this and more was, until ye8terday,-jredited not only by Farmer Hampson and his 'wife, but by hundreds, and probably thousands, of ' folk who pride themselves upon their common flense. So Intense has beentheir condition -of credulity, that they do not appear to have doubted a story put about by a local wag to the effect _that on the afternoon of the reported initial disaster the farmer, ' going out into his yard, beheld a trio :'6f porcine choristers sitting 'np on their hams and singing ''God save the Queen,' under tike directorship of- a rlng^nosed -pig, -beating time with a dibble. Such nonsense would Beem too ridiculous to be credited- but for the fact that tiie wildest rumours concerning this affair have passed current hereabout as gospel truth. ' Even the rural police are said to have_been thrown off their balance, and to have 'failed to account for the affair, either- as the result of personal in quiries or from 'information received.' Shrews bury town, up to its eyes in- the business and pleasure of racing during the -past week, has yet found time to gossip under its 'breath about the haunted farm and the strange goings on' there. Shrewsbury, indeed,- bad a ghostly trouble of its own. For six whole months a'gentleman and his family residing in the Cherry Orchard have been kept awake at nights by rappings on the wainscots and continual nocturnal ringings 'of bells all 'over the house. They have, therefore, determined to ' change their habitation, hoping that the spirits may not be disposed to follow them into another parish. During an interview with Colonel Edgehill, chief of the county police, that -urbane official in formed me that, though he was cognisant of the 'Wood Farm scare, yet no one had instituted a criminal prosecution against any offender, assum ing any offence toiave been committed. It did not come within his province to interfere. Looked at from the spiritualistic point of view, he deemed the entire proceedings as beneath con tempt. The good people of Shropshire, on the other hand, while implicitly believing that the furniture at the farm danced to the piping1 of the Prince of the Powers of 'the Air, somehow— how is not even yet exactly explained— coupled the manifestations with the name 'of 'Emma Davies, nursegirl in -the rustic establishment of Mr. and Mrs. Sampson. This Emma Davis' iB thought to be a juvenile sorceress in league -with the Evil One. Serious folk are ready to testify that; they have seen her seated upon- a cane bottomed chair floating about ininid-air; that at her approach buckets and brooms take to capering and curvetting like the roan' horse ob served by Sir Launcelot at the-gates of ' the dim rock city' in 'The Idylls of the King;' and a well- known sectarian serial publication, in half calf, is reported to follow Emma about like a dog. Subsequent to my interview with Colonel Edgehill I visited- Emma Davies at the house of Dr. Cook, at Wein, whittier she was removed from the cottage of her parents, labouring-people at 'Wessen, in order that she might : be -under medical supervision. For it is a fact that the girl pretended to possess magical powers, and played all kinds of pranks with the chairs and -tables in the aforesaid cottage at Wesson. She made three-legged stools waltz round the room, and zinc pails hide in corners. Before describing what I saw and heard at Dr. Cook's, it will, how ever, be better to recount the evidence of Sir. and Mrs. Hampson, at -Wood Farm. After a pleasant drive of five -miles through-the &hropshire;~lanes, I arrived at the West Juullington homestead, situated in a well-woodedpastoral txrantry dotted with ancient half-timbered houses, many of them dating from the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The air was keen and bright, the ice lay .an inch thick upon the ponds, their dull grey contrasting with the shining leaves of the frequent holly bushes already bearing a grand crop of scarlet berries. ? If spirits Were about in that beautiful frosty air they lay concealed out of the glowing sunshine which flooded wood and meadow with cheery winter gladness. The Wood-3?arm con sists of about 55 acres, partly arable, partly pas ture, Mr. Hanipson's profits being principally derived from V»i« business of a maltster. J3[is house is small, the ground floor conEisting,of a kitchen or keeping room, -some 15ft square, lead ing directly into a smaller compartment used as a scullery. :Both he 'and his wife were young, of middle height, and fair complexion. They were willing, and, indeed, ' anxious to .afford me all the information they -possessed. Mrs. Hampson said that jibout a -fortnight ago, one ? day in . the morning, -tHe -fire leaped ont of the grate into the parlour, set light to the sofa, and severely burned, the -face pi hert-aby/ lying- in. its perambulator,. in -jharge.of the girl Emma Davies ; and she showed jcae the ,chijd, which -stalls ? retains a large «car .as from a burn, on the left cheek. ;Thereupo-n she ran to : fetch , a neighbour, who also witnessed the coal shoot, out from the grate 'all over ' the xoom, and who ..is .. supposed to have, wondered at ? thei^ urniture ^-dancing .about Jas if possessed- by 'Lucifer. —WhenfMr. ,J5ampson returned home iit the. ^afternoon he. was told of whatiadoMuiied^ -and attribute ;the,manifestai tion- to natural causes not unconnected with tiie coal in' the; grate.
