SOUTH AUSTRALIAN MEMS. The Government has been asked to supple* ment the funds raised lor the exploration of Central Australia. The dispute between the Governor and the Chief Justice of Western Australia has resulted in the suspension of the latter. The South Australian Border papers complain that their farmers are crossing over into Victorian territory, where the inducements offered to agriculturists are greater thau in the sister colony. It is alleged that a ghost haunts the Ade* lalde Exhibition. The uncanny thing has lost one of its limbs, as its p'aintive cry invariably is," Give me my leg; give me my leg." A policeman has been seriously frightened by the wandering spirit. A telegram received frooi Eoebourne, Western Australia, states that a large quantity of quartz is being sent from that port per s.s. Otway. Several shafts have been sunk, and many persons are prospecting within a radius of 20 miles of Roebourne. The yield is from 2oz. to 6oz. per ton. The vermin-proof fence has now been completed to about 60 miles north of Serviceton. Mr. Rice Hood states that the fence has proved an efficient barrier to wild dogs. They are so savage at meeting with the unaccustomed obstruction that they have been known to gnaw the wire net mesh on coming to the fence. A return laid before the Council (says the Register) gave particulars of the arrivals and departures to and from the colony during tbe years 1883 to 18B7. Daring 1883 there were 16,991 arrivals and 13,313 departures ; 1884. 14,768 arrived, 14,488 left; 1885, 12,088 arrived, 18,589 left; 1886, 15,837 arrived, 23,777 left; to October 31, 1887, 10,971 arrived, 13,654 left; making a total of 70,655 arrivals, and 83,821 departures.
