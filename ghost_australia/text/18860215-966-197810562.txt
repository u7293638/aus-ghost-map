VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. [By Telegraph.] [From our own Reporter.] Melbourne, February 14. The meeting at Caulfield on Saturday was successful in every way. The weather was fine, and the attendance nearly equal to the Guineas day, while the racing was quite worthy of Flemington. No less than sixteen numbers were hoisted for the Hurdle Race, but the strength of the field did not prevent backers taking very short price about Vanderbilt, who was supposed to be a good thing. Royal Maid was most in demand of the others, and she looked all over a winner entering the straight, but in the run home she tired under the weight, and after a desperate finish Vanderbilt pulled his backers through by a bare head. Aglaos was the first backed for the Criterion Stakes, but before they went out there was such a rush on Master John that he left off a hot favourite at € to 4. The Nun. was quickest on her legs, and getting a little the best of the luck all the way, she won cleverly from Mis trail. Master John was very unlucky, the boy who rode him trying to get up on the inside and getting jammed on the rails. Twenty-three weighed out for the Oakleigh Handicap, and The Israelite was at once enstalled favourite, while Breeze, Silver Mine, and Xantippe were all well backed. They were some time at the post, but eventually the word was given to a very fair start. Delamia and Breeze were the most prominent to the turn, The Israelite and Silver Mine following them, and as they swept into the straight the last-named pair looked like fighting it out, but directly they were fairly in a run for home William Tell cut the leaders down in the most hollow style, and striding away he won easily by nearly two lengths. The Israelite finished very strongly, and got second place, but William Tell won so easily that he was at once installed first favourite for the Newmarket Handicap. The winner is a country horse, but he is leased to Messrs, Miller, and ran in their colours. The time was very fast, and the result proved that the Lockleys party had every reason to think they had a good IhiDg in The Israelite. The Steeplechase was a chapter of accidents, six of the horses falling, and in the end Stud ley had no difficulty in beating the ancient Euchre. Some smart platers were in the Selling Race, but Goldtop scored very easily at the finish. Although Duration went very short in his preliminary, he was backed down to 5 to 2 for the Hawkesburn Handicap. The lightweights made the pace a cracker all the way, and Duration could never get neai the front, but Lesbia, Gipsy's Warning, and Ringmaster made a desperate race of it, and sheer gamenesB enabled Mr. Wilson's colt to win by a short neck. In the evening William Tell was heavily backed for the Newmarket Handicap, and Duration was driven to 100 to 6 for tne Australian Cup. The following are the results: — HANDICAP HUBDLE RACE, 0fl50sove. Second horse to receive 30 sovs. and the third 20 sovs. from the stake. N omination, 2 sevs. One mile and a half. Mr. M.

Richworth headed him at the bend, and Master John began to Bhow, but as they entered the straight Richworth lost her place through stumbling, and The Nun came on clear of Munwyrtina and Mistral, with Master John trying to get an opening on the rails. From this out The Nun WAS not caught, and won cleverly by a length from Mistral, .who was a neck in front of Munwyrtina, Master John, who could never get a clear ran, was beaten by a head for third place.
