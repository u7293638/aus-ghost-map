THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CEMETERY. TO THE EDITOR. birâ€” I see a letter in this morning's Register from Mr. J. B. Champion, complain ing of the state of the Roman Catholic Ceme tery, which, he says, is uulit to burv hodi*. in, ana at tne same time stating that the Pro testant Cemetery is all that can be desired. May 1 ask what is to prevent a Catholic being buried in any part of the Cemetery which he, before death, or his friends afterwards, may choose ? Surely our Government, who have nothing to do with religious beliefs while the people are alive, have no right to make any distinction when they are dead. I am, Sir, Ac, GHOST.
