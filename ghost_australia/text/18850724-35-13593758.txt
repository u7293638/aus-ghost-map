CRICKET. On Tuesday evening last the Oddfellows' Hall, Newtown, presented a gay and animated appearance, where a crowded audience assembled to assist at the second annual reunion and presentation of trophies to the successful winners of the Waratah C. C. for the seasons 1884 and 1885. The first part of the programme commenced with songs, &c.;, by the Sale Amateur Minah els, who kindly gave their valuable services to the club. During the intermission the trophies, which were very elegant in design, were presented by Mr. J. Goddard, Mayor of Macdonaldtown, the performance concluding with the of area of a " ghost in a Pawnshop," Mr. M'Beath keeping the house in rom s of laughter. The floors were then cleared, and dancing and refreshments were indulged in till the early hours of morning, the only regret being that the annual reunion of the Waratah C. fi did not come sooner. Great praise is due to Messrs Hamblin and Millard, secretary and treasurer, for the very satisfactory way in which the outer tainment was carried out
