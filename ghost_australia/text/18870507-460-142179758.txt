TURF GOSSIP. By Augur. This afternoon at Caul Geld lovers of racing will have an opportunity of discussing the ex cellent programme placed before them by the Victoria Amateur Turf Club. Although the foil of the leaves from the English trees denotes the approach of winter, a May day at Caul field is generally among the most enjoy able of the year. The bill of fare for the May meeting is an attractive one, con taining, as it does, six items. With a brilliant horse like William Tell in the Trial Handicap, Mr. Barnard had no alternative bnt to commence at a heavy weight with the flying chestnut, and Mr. Miller has more than a useful second string in Munwyrtina, j who has not been altogether a lucky horse, j for he has finished second and third oftener than any three- year-old in the country. I don't expect to see either Meteor or The Levite face Mr. Wateon.but if DonGiovan were in his old form, Morrison might find it worth his while to lethim have another trial at Caul field. Quintin Matsep more thanonce exhibited a rare tarn of speed, but he was a most dis appointing animal to Mr. \V. E. Dakin, who conld hardly have been sorry when he sot rid of him. With 7st 101b. he should have a show, and so should New Fashion, a real good cat of a racehorse. Sedition, Stafford, and Uncas have all displayed fair form over Caulfield, and seem to me to be nicely handi capped, Stafford perhaps being the best of the quartet Nor is Yascosa harshly used, while Bonnie Doon, St Leonard, Derision, and Dufferin have not received any more weight than they were entitled to. From these to the bottom of the handicap nothing is better treated than Gadfly, Damocles, and Dick Swiveller; but I've a fancy for STAFFORD, VASCOSA, and Dcffekin. In the Hurdle Race nothing is so well treated as Friction, who wa3 a real good performer in Queensland, where he won with 12ut. 101b. and 12st. 71b. upon his tiack, bat possibly he may not be in his best form just now, and the race may be fought out by GOODWOOD, SPARTAN-, and HUNTSMAN. THE GHOST or SORCERER ought to win the Selling Race. The Steeplechase will, I think, provide a most interesting con test Lady Aahtonshould have a show at 12st 41b., though possibly Mr. Pears&n; may prefer to stand upon, his aecond string Royal Oak. Raby has quite as much as she is entitled to, but she y a good little mare, and over Caullield seems all at home. The Irish man, Euchre, Marrnion, Atlas, and Pro motion 'bee not overburdened, and ATLAS, IIOTAL OAK,..and Pbomotion may provide the winner amongst them. In the Glen Hantly Handicap nothing looks so well upon taper as Rctguasibb, who won the Place Handicap with somepounds in hand. If he be not i' .the vein,' then THE LEVITE, Mekotti, and METEOR . may fight it out for places, For the Two-year-old Handicap I fancy Casdisiv Axsebt Loddow, and- JULIAN Gbat, Who Amongst sportsmen will not greet with pleasure 4he announcement 4hat the Right Hon. W. B. Dalley, most brilliant of Australian orators, has determined to enter into an active participation in the old sport of ..racing? English statesmen have shown the Example from the time that, racing was Tint established, and amongst the premiers whose colours have often flaunted in the breeze have been Lords Palmerston and Derby, ? while at die present ? time Lords llosebery and Randolph Churehill are to be' found in Kvff. In the list of A.J.C. entries which have been forwarded by Mr. Glib born, I; observe Mr. Dpi ley'f b or br c, by Epigram from . Wluto and blue, and every Australian, whether of a sporting turn ©I mind or not, will rejoice to see'Hie banner , of their gifted countryman hailed victorious "*<n some of the great turf contests of the yiear. The Richmond Stakes has sip entry!of 69, only seven of these being Vifctoriatt. ondnot a.sinsle one''of the seven trasi»rilini%isJc61bny; Indeed, in the whole list there are only three Victorian-bred yearlings^ la93 the* axe nominated by tesidepta of New South Wales.

I^njr is the largest con jtfJtHitdr with no less Eton -eight, and next to 'hiixi comra Mr. D. Cooper with five, while Mr. W». " Kelso has four in his name. The Hon, James White has nominated only three, all fillies, but none of them from the famous mares of the Kirkham Btud, and somehow or other the nominations of the leading turfite of New South Wales do not, in any instance, look so formidable as they did last year. Breeding to English time, with the view of contesting the English Derby, may have something to do with this. And this reminds me that there .is a rumour that Lord Carring ton accepted irom an English nobleman who was on a visit to Australia, a wager of 10,000 to 100 that Mr. White would win the English Derby within 10 years. If it be true, I sincerely hope the popular Governor of the sister colony will be fortunate enough to land the wager. Mr. J. Leek bos nominated the two colts he purchased in Sydney, and the other Victorian nominators ore Messrs. I. Foulsham, R. Donovan, and O. Baniett. Mr. T. Sampson has three engaged, all colts, and if one of them is as good as Matador, he will have no reason to grumble at the end of next eeason. Queensland is represented by Mr. W. H. Kent, who has nominated, two being fillies and one a colt One of the former is by Darebin from First Lady, the dam of Grand Flaneur, and the other is by Darebin from Stockdove, one of the most fashionably-bred mares ever im ported to Australia. The' appearance of the name of the lion. W. Robinson in the list gives us hope that tlie New Zealand sports man will visit us in the coming sprina, and he and the Hon. E. Mitchelson will be as welcome as the flowers that bloom in that delightful season of the year. Mr. Robin ton's pair are bred the right way, for one is eister to Thunderbolt, while the other is by Chester's brother St. George from that extra ordinarily successful brood mare Rupee. Fashionable breeding, too, is there in Mr. Mitchelson's two, which are both by Musket from imported mares of the very highest lineage, Kosette being nearly related to bend Or, the sire of Ormonde, while Pulchra is a daughter of two of the best animals England ever possessed. For the Derby of 1888 there are G7 entries, and I'm very mucli surprised to find that only 10 are from Victoria, and of this number Mr. S. Gardiner contributes four. New Zealand is very strongly represented, having three more than our colony, and most of them arc by the defunct sire Musket, whose stock have performed such wonderful things on the Australian turf. The lot includes a brother to Trenton, who is named Cuirassier, for whom a large sum has been offered on Aus tralian account. The lion, James White nomiuates four, and three of them are geldings. I notice that the Chrysolite colt appears in the Hon. John Eales's name, so I presume he was not sold when submitted to auction last month. Our half score includes1 the Lurline colt and a brother to Ring master. In the Oaks there are 35 engaged, and six of these are Victorian. The December Stakes has G7, but as this is run in December, Victorians Uave not entered largely, only iour hailing from this colony. To the 123 in the Foal Stakes of 1889 only one Victorian breeder lias contributed, and that is Mr. John Crozier, who has nominated 20, no less thau 16 of them bein? by St Albans, while two are by First King and two by Savanaka. The New Zealand Stud Company has a dozen nominated, eight by Musket and four by Ingomar ; and the Middle- park (N Z.) Com pany has four in the list Mr. Audrew Town bas 28 in his name, and curiously enough only one is by Moorthorpe, who is the sire of Moorhouae, while a couple only are by Grand Flaneur, two sires who are likely to receive more patronage in future. The Champague Stakes has an entry of CO, and this includes the brother to Hortense, who is also nomi nated for the St Leger, in die latter of which I also notice the entry of Mr. J. Rediearn's brother to Plunger. The other events have filled well, though I miss the names of such good sportsmen as the Hon. W. Pearson, \ Mr. D. S. Wallace, and Mr. J. Wililting- J ham from the list i Among the youngsters entered for the' A.J.O. Sires' Produce Stakes of 1888, and which were not eligible in consequence of their sires not being nominated, are the j Hon. J White's Martini-Henry-Lily Haw thorn filly, several of Mr. J. Lee's by Kings borough, and four of Mr. A. Town's by \ Sardonyx.' In referring to Hortense's dibul last week I confounded it with the CaulGeirl Foal Stakes, which she won. It was in the Two year-old Stakes at the M.H.C. Spring Meet ing that Mistletoe defeated her. Intending nominators foe the Melbourne Hunt Club meeting will bear in mind that the entries close at the V. It C. office at 4 p.m. on Monday. There are five events in the programme, the first being a Hurdle Race of lOOsova, one mile and a halt and a distance, which vrill6uU a great majority of the horses at present at this particular line of business. This is followed by a Selling Race of 103 sov&, half a mile, a sprint which a goodly number jrf platen are likely to enter for. A Steeplechase of 175 sovs. comes next, and this will be run over two miles. The Birth day Handicap of 230 so vs. will attract the fiat-racers, and as the distance is only six furlongs there is sure to be a liberal response from owners of horses. : The wind-up is a Selling Hurdle Baoe of 75 so vs., one mile and a quarter 1 When will the V.R.C. introduce a rule to put an end to this kind of race ? A mile and a -quarter hurdle race cannot have anything but a degrading effect upon the turf. Of course, it encourages the gambling element, but this should not be the object of men who profess to have the interests of the sport at beart, There am entries further afield which will require the attention . of racing men on Mon day, and none so important perhaps as those of the Syduey Ton Ciuh, which will be received at the S.T.CL office in Sydney, and the V.&C.; office in Melbourne. The Royal Stakes baa dosed with 82 nominations, and the Queen's Birthday Cup with 67-splendid results considering the lateness of the season. The events which dose on Monday are the Hurdle .Race of 200 so vs., two miles; Sove reign Plate of 150 sovs., seven furlongs; and SteepIecTiaae of tOObovs. Some of our turf men will surely try their luck in one or two these. Entries for the Sydney Turf Club Amateur; Meeting, which 'takes place on the following j Saturday, also close on Monday, and 1 hope to see sotne of our non-professionals enter the lists. Victorians who intend nominating for the jumping races orflat races of the Sidney Turf Club mOTt iiot lose sight of the eventsof Sydney Tattersall's Club, which are to lie inn; at Randwicfc, on Saturday, June i.

Elstem wick-park baa seven events m the May.programme, and this Detessihtei a com mencement at l o'clock. Entries close on Monday next at 4 p.m., and as the bill is a diversified one, there is sore to be a satis factory response to the call made by Mr. Haydon. First comes a Maiden Plate, in which the competitors will have to carry special weights, and tbis is followed by a Iiurdle Race of 75 sovg. Third comes thfl Victoria Handicap of 75 sovs., after which nre a Selling Steeplechase of 75 sovs.. Time Handicap Trot of 75 sovs., Selling Hnee of 75 sovs., and Elstern wick-park Handicap of 100' sovs. While on the snbjeetof nominations, I mat point out that the entries for Moonee Valley Races close at Mr. Cox's office, Kirk's Bazaar, at 4 p.m. on Monday. The bill of fare com prises a Maiden Selling Uace of 50 sovs., West Bourke Handicap ot' 50 60vs., Ilnrdle Ra.cs of 50 sovs., May Handicap of 50 sovs., Selling Race of 100 sovs., and Broadmeadowa Handi cap of 50 sovs. Owners of horses complain of the condition in the Caulfield Cup which provides that the winner of any tace shall carry 71b. extra, as this includes winners of weight-for age races. I pointed this out wlien the programme first appeared. It will also include the winner of any hurdle race or steeplechase of the value of 200 sovs., so that if Sheet Anchor, Blue Mountain, or Sir Launcelot were to win a good hurdle race after the declaration of the' weights a penalty of 71b. would be incurred.; Possibly the members ot the V.A.T.C. com mittee have not studied the meaning of the word " race " according to the lights of the V.R.C., under whose rules the V.A.T.C.. run. Various reasons have been advanced for Lindsay Gordon's departure from England., "Rapier," an English sporting writer, re- ferring to the matter, says : - " Gordon, when about 17, and while a pupil at the Cheltenham College, paid a man named Walker £5 for the distinction of riding a mare the next day at the Worcester Steeplechases. That night the mare was seized by the sheriff for a debt due from Walker. The bailiff locked her up in the stable of an hotel at Worcester, and went to his rest. Gordon, having taken counsel with an injudicious friend, came to the conclusion that the property in the mare had passed to him, and being very ambitious to sport his new silk jacket-made for the occasion-he broke open the door of the stable, and took her off. She was soon recovered by the myrmidons of the law, and a warrant was issued against the youthful burglar for his act; but the matter was adjusted by Tom Oliver, the true friend and judicious mentor of his guest and pupil-for Gordon was often at Oliver's, whose training stables were near Cheltenham, where Gordon, as a rule, resided, his father being professor of Hindoo stanee at the Cheltenham College. It was after his father's death that Gordon left Eng- land, and three years and more had elapsed since this little mistake of his, which, I may add, was altogether put in the shade by sub- sequent escapades. I doubt very much if supposing Gordon had been arrested-the magistrates would have sent the case for trial. There was no animus furandi. It was a blunder, and nothing more; but a blnnder founded on reason, for it was quite natural for the lad to think after payment of £5 for a lease of the mare, that the property in the animal became his pro tempore, and from what I am told by an actor in the comedy of errors, the warrant was used more as a 'screw' to extract golden corks than to avenge outraged justice." This reference to the departed poet reminds me that his grave in the Brighton Cemetery is said to need atten- tion. I'm sure the mention of this is only neces- sary for old friends to take steps to prevent it being neglected. The old steeplechase rider, Billy Trainor, who rode against Gordon in many a hard- fought contest, pays periodical visits to his grave, and has often provided the money necessary to keep it in order, but Trainor is not a rich man, and I hope other old friends of Gordon will see that his grave is kept green. His name can never die. Now that all donbts respecting Ormonde« roaring have been put nt rest, John Potter, his trainer, has resorted to galvanism in the hope that it will cure him. Every morning a battery ia applied to the Derby winner, one point to his chest, and the other to tris throat, and aa Professor Fleming states that he has cured affections of the wind in this way, hopes are entertained that the great son of Bend Or may be rendered sound enough to figure in some of the Cup races of the present season. Much as one may hope for a suc cessful result from the application of galvanic shocks, it is too much to cxpect a perfect care, and I'm afraid Ormonde's chances of victory in long races are very remote. As the Hon. James White's colt Paragon had been nominated for the A.J.C. events, the secretary has requested Mr. M 'Donald to alter the uame of his colt by Gang Forward from Josephine. I cannot understand why, seeing that Mr. White's colt is dead, unless the Kirkham studmaster intends to christen the brother Paragon. It would have saved all the trouble had Mr. H'Donuld chosen some other name. 7 Harper Thompson, who once created a sensation in Sydney, was sold at Farrell's sale yards, Ballarat, a short time ago for six sovereigns. This hor3e, it will lie remem bered, under the name of Hubbub, von the Steeplechase at die AJ.C. -Autumn Meeting in 1883, and was protested cgainst, on the ground that he was not the horse be was represented to be, but after taking a lot' of evidence the protest was dismissed. Freetrader, after his victory at Warrnam» bool, was sold for 200 sovereigns, and goes Into P. Hey wood's stable. The Duke of Beaufort has won the One Thousand Guineas with his filly Eeved'Or, who isby Hampton from Queen of thelloses.by Sun deelah from Goulenr de Rose, by West Aus tralia from Maria by Harkaway. Hampton, the site of the winner, is by Lord Clifden from Lady Langden, by Kettledrum .from Haricot* who was a daughter of Queen Mary, the dam of Kink Bonny. Sydney Galvayne, an Australian hoists tamer, has. been creating something of . a sensation throughout England, by exhibi* turns of his skill as a tamer of vicious hotses. The system which he &4opts in breaking-tn hones is said to be the most effective ever introduced into the old country. Among the foals dropped at Mr. J. B. Hoggin's Californian j&tud; in Much was a filly by Sir' Modred frotn a mare named Twilight; Matchless, one of (he mares purchased by Mr. Haggin at the Lorillard sale.
