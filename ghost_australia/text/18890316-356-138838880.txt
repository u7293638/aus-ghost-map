O lover mine, to thee I come ' Out of the wide world's whirr and hum The world that, ro-kless of woe and pain, On, rolls on to the goal and gain, And cares no wshit for theeo or me. Take me to the whirling soea' ' Into thy bosom my body I fling, For life is a wortliless, wbrthliss thing, Now my lover is lost to. me. Lover mine, I come to thee ! J, STv LEeRoaaRT?SO.e
