It waa for ihb reason that I bad boen eWa ib&t; mating to aUmnchJiXtejr than Mtial with Madeline on the moonlit porch. Tho flguro wn» certainly that -rf John Hiflckman in.ait ordinary flrafa, bat thero was & Taguenesa and;fndUUnot&ftsa; about it which presently assured mo that it waa a ghost.,- Had tho good old man been murdered? and heA his spirit coma to tell mo of tie de«cl,'and to obiiuW 'W'xM' tha protec tion of bis dear— — ?

'Wo do not expect him.' -.' I am glad of that,' said he, sinking into tho chair by which ho rtood. ?'During tho two yean and a half that I hara inhabited this house, that man has never before been sway for a aingle night Ton can't imagine tha relief it gires me.' \ And aa bo spoko ho stretched out bia legs and leaned hack in tho chair. - His form be camo low vogue, and the color of his garment* more distinct and evident, wbllo an oxnn**ioii of gratified, relief snecoodsd to the anxiety of hia countenance. '.-. - ^ 'Two ream and a half I' X exclaimed. 'I don't understand you.' V ? ' : 'Itisfullythat lengtb of tuso,'.iaud the ghost, ' sinca I first camo here. Miso ia not; an ordinary case. Bat before I say anything more about ii, Ict me ask yon again if you are tura Mr. Ilinckman Trill not return to-night ?' 'I am as sure of it as lean bo of anything,' I answered. ' He left to-day for Bristol, two hundred miles away.' . ' Then I will go on,' said tho ghost, ' for I am glad to have tho opportunity of talking to somo ono who will listen to me ; but if John Hinckroan sbonld como in and catch mo here, I should bo frightened out ot my WJtS.' .'...;..?? ' Tljifl fs all Tcry atrange,' I said, greatly puzzled by what I had heard. ' Arc yon the' ghost of Mr. Iiineiman V' ?'???' This was a bold question, but my mind was so full ot other emotions that thcro itccmed to be no room for that of fear. ' Yea, I am his ghost,' my companion re plied, ' and yes I hard no right to bo. And this is what mokes mo to uneasy, and so much afraid of him. It is & strange Btory, and, I truly believe, without precedent. Two ycara and a half ago, John liinckmon was daugar otuly ill in this very room. At ono time he was so far gono that ho was roally boliovod to be dead. I- was in consequence of too pre cipitate a report in regard to this matter that I was, at that time, appointed to bo his ghost. Imagino my surprise and horror, sir, when, after I bad accepted the position and assumed its responsibilitit*, tho old man mired, be came convalescent, and eventually regained hia usual health. My situation was now ono of extrano delicacy and embarrassment. I had no power to return to my original unem bwliment, end I had no right to be the ghojit of a man who was not- dead. '; I was advised ay my menus io qtucuy maintain my position, and was assured that, as John Hincltman was an cldcriv man, it could not bo long before I oould rightly assnmo tho position for which I had been delected. But I tell yon, sir,' ho continued with animation, ' tho old fellov nosms as Tigorotu as orer, and I hAvo no idea how much longer this annoying state of tilings will continue. I 'spend my timo trying to get out of that old man'« way. I must not lesvo this house, and ha accma to follow mo everywhere. I tell you, air, ho haunts me.' ' Tlwt is truly a queer stato ol things,' I remarked. 'Bui why aro you afraid of hhu ? Ho couldn't hurt you.' ' Of courjo ho couldn't,' said tho ghost. '? But his very prewnoo in a shock and terror to mo. Imaidno, sir, bow you would feel if my ca»o wcio yours.' I could not imagino such a thine at nU. I *tinply chuddorod. ' And if ona mart bo a wrongful ghojtt at aU, the apparition continued, ' it would bo much ploawantcr to bo tba ghost of some man other than John Hinckman. Tbcro is iu him an inucibiltjr of temper, accontpaniod by a faciUty of invoctivo, which i« seldom oiet with. And what would happen if ho were to sco me, ana find oat, m I am sure ho would, how long and why I had inhabited hia houise, I can ctarooly conceive. I have seen him in hi« burst* of pawton, and, although bo did not hurt tho people ho stormed at any more than he would hurt me, they seemed to shrink before him.' All this I knew to bo very true Had it not bwn for this ptcaliarity of Mr. Hinekroan, 1 might havo b«'jj more trilling to talk to him about hi* niece. ' I fod sory tor you,' I nnid, for I reaDy be gan to havo a ?ymnathetlc feeling toward tbw unfe-.rtunato apparition. ' Tour case u indeed a hard one. It reminds too o» tho*« pewon« who hav« had doubka, and I suppose a man would oft«j be very angry Indeed when lie ft,und that there was another being who waa personating hinumlf.'

' ' ' ''?'.?.' ? 'Oh, yes,'rcph'ed tho other, with a liftlo mvra. ' I could not be here bo much aa I have been without knowing all about that.' There was something horrible in the, idea of MadcUno and myself having been watched by a ghost, even, perhaps, when we wandered together in the most delightful and bosky places. But, then, this was quite an excep tional ghost,' and I could not hav» the objec tion to him which would ordinarily arise to regard to beings of his class. , ; ? ; 'I must go now,' said thojjhoflt, rising, 'but I win hoc you Bomewhtro to-morrow night. And remember — you help me, and 111 holp you.' I had doubU tho next morning as to tbo propriety of telling Madeline anything about this interview, and soon convinced myself that I most keep silent on the subject.' If abo know thcro was a ghost about the bouse ahc would probably leavo the place instantly. I did nots mention tho matter, and oo regulated my demeanor that I am qnita sure Madeline never suspected what had taken place. For Bomo timo I liad wished that Mr. Hinckman would abjent himself, for a day at least, from the premises. In such case I. thought I might more cosily nerve myself up to tbo point of speaking to Madeline on the subject of our future collateral existence, and, now that tho opportunity for nich speech bad really oc curred, I did not feel ready to avail myself of it. What would become of me if aba refused me? .. .;. ? '. ' . ..; .: ? .:.??*?'? vy- . , .? I had an idca,howovcr,that tho lady thought that, if I were going to speak at all, this was tho timo. She must havo known that oertain sentimenta were afloat within mo, and aho was not unreasonable! in her wish to eeo tho matter settled one way or tho other. But I did not feel like tatting a bold step In tho dork. If filie winhed iWo to osk Her to give herself to me, sho ought to offer mo some reason to suppose that she would mako the gift. If I saw no probability of such generosity, I would prefer that things should remain as they wero. 'fbat crtniny I was silting with Madeline* in tha moonlit porch. It was nearly ten o'clock, and ever since supper-timo I had boon working myself up to the point of making an arown! of my sentiments. ' I had not posi tively determined to do this, bat wished gradually to reach tho proper point, when, if tho prospect looked bright, I might speak. situation— at least, I imagined tbat tho nearer I come to a proposal the moro sho seemed to expect it. It was certainly a very critical and important epoch in my life. If I gpokc, I should mako myself happy or miserable for ever, and if I did not speak I had every reason to bolievo that tho. lady would not giro me another chance to do so. Sitting thus with Madeline, talking a little, and thinking very hard over these momentous matters, I looftd up and saw tha ghost, not a dozen feet away from us. Ho was sitting on tbo railing of tho porch, ono leg thrown up before him, Die other dangling down as ho leaned against a po.it. He was behind Made line, hut almost in front of me, as I sat faoing tho lady. It vraa fortunate that Madeline waa looking out over tho landscape, for I roust havo appeared very much Rtartlcd. Tho ghost bad told me that he would soo mo somo timo this night, but I did not think ho would make hix appearance when I was in tho company ot Madeline If (the should sea the spirit of her. undo I could not answer for the consequences. I niado no exclamation, but tho ghost evidently paw th&t; I w&a; troubled. ' Don't bo afraid,' ho said—' I shall not let her ftco mo ; and Kite cannot here me speak tinjw« I address myself to her, which I do not intend to do.' I Eupposo I looked grateful. ' So you need not trouble yonrneli about that,' the ghoul continued; ' but It Bcems to me Hint you aro not getting along very well with your affair. Ii I were you, I should fipcak out without waiting any longer. You vriJI never havo a better chance. Von aro not likiily to be interrupted ; and, bo far as I can judi-e, tho lady s.«mi disposed to listen to you favorably ; that is, it nho ever intends to do m.

If 1 were in your place I should never dare la mako lovo to Hinckman 'a niece if be wtrc anywhere about tho place. If he ahould catch any ono offering himself to Miaa Madeline, he would then bo a terriblo nun to encounter.' I agreed perfectly to all this. ' I cannot bear to think of him 1' I ejacu lated aloud. ' Think of whom V asked Madeline, turn ing quickly toward ma, Hero waa an awkward situation.

' Yea,' I nniworcd, after a little hesitation, ' it in, in a measure, connected with him,' She mndo no answer to this, and sat' look- ing at her book, but not reading. From iho expression of her face, I thought eho was somewhat softened toward me. Sho know her undo as well as I did, and nho may have been thinking that, if ho were the obstacle that prevented m^ speaking (and thcro wore many wayn in which he might bo that obsta cle), my position wonld be such a hard ono tbat it would exeuw «omo wildness of speech and eccentricity of manner. I saw, too, that tbo warmth of thj partial explanations had had somo effect on her, and I began to bo licvo that it might bo a good thing for me to speak my mind without delay. No matter how sho should recoivo my proposition, my relations with her could not bo worso than they hod been th6 previous night and day, and thcro was something in her face which encouraged mo to hope that aho might forget my foolish cxclamationn of tbo evening befora if I began to tell her my talo of love. I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and as I did so tho chost burst into the room from tho door-way behind, her. I say burst, although no door flow open nnd ho mado no noise. Ho was wildly excited, and waved his arnviabovo his head. The moment I saw him, my heart fell within me. With the en tranco of that impertinent apparition, every hope fled from me. I could not speak whila he wan in tho room. I must havo turned pale, nnd I gazed stead 'fastly at tho ghost, almost without seeing Madeline, who not between us. ' Do you know,' ho cried, ' that John Hinckman is coming up tho bill? Ho will bo here in fifteen minutes, and if yoa aro doing anything in the way of love-making, you hot better hurry it up. But this is not what I camo to tell you. I havo glorious news ? At last I ans transferred ! Not forty minutes ago a rtawiftn nobleman waa murdered by tno Nihilists. Nobody ever thought of. him in connection with an immedinto gno3tship. My friends iniuantly applied for the situation for me, and obtained rny transfer. I am off More that horrid Hinckman cornea up tho lull. The moment I reach my now position, I fthall put off this hated liemblance. Good by. You can't imagine how jjlad I am lo be, at lost, the real ghost of somebody.' ' ' Oh I' I cried, ruing to. my feet nnd stretching out my arms in utter wretchedness, ' I would to Hcavai you were mino !' ' I «m yours,' wid Madeline, rising to mo ht-r tearful eyes. frank II.
