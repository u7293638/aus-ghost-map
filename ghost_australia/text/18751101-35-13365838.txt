OUR MELBOURNE LETTER. ToBsnAT, OCTOBER 26, I 1 its new Ministry are now fairly at work in their several departments, but, as they have to stand the test of going before their constituents for re- election they will not be able to attend to more than routine business for a week or two The Premier, Sir James M'Culloch, will address his constituents at AVarrusm 1 wool on Saturday evening, and several of the others will follow on Monday. The consideration shown to the Berry Ministry in not offering any opposition to their re-election is more than they are deposed to reciprocate to displace the Kerferd Almistijnw't» the cases of the gentlemen who obtained their place a duty they owed their country, but their own day 1 lacement they regard as a disgrace to intervening who told be so base as to lend it the remotest assistance Hence we find one ex Minister taking the chair at " monster" meeting to start n candidates or)])ositii)ii to a member of the new Ministry and several others of the late Ministry supporting line in the pitt falls There has been some talk of Mr Henri resigning his seat at Geelong to oppose the State Premier it AA nnt ambool, and of Mayor Smith, the War Minister of Mines, resigning his sent for Ballarat to stand for re-election against the new Commissioner of Kailis us, who has for the same constituents 'line, however, is mere bounce ' Neither of the Maritime would be simple enough to risk the result, and so their utmost efforts are being directed to find others to step in and do battle instead c""' been told several times by the organs of the late Ministry that even one of the new men wouldn't o fight for his seat, but the probability is that more than half of them will be em alkali c The severest \- to urge will be in Ballarat, where a candidate of great local influence his been started in opposition to an Joseph Jones, the Commissioner of Railways, an » West Lemke, where Dr Madden, the Solicitor General, will be opposed by a gentleman who repr a cited the constituency for several years ^acnI'""> seems confident of success, but the Been Perth as the most boastful of their certain victory Inf was". however, may be found to belie all thcl?;Pre<i;c ,,,,. That every exertion of which the late Ministry weather party are capable will be put forth on thwocca sion is beyond doubt, and it may eventuate w the loss of one or even two or i seats, but even that is scarcely eM»Tu. Opposition organs are daily striving to meet the public by putting a false issue before the; conn or Mr Berry is lauded as the author of a land- tax so as to compel the wealthy classes to her then a share of the public burdens, while Sir James M E Inch is represented as the mouthpiece and regret"" of the great landowners, whose determination loch me to make the poor pay thebes ' This stiffs! that does not, of course, succeed with the stage reflecting portion of the public, but there is unfortunately, too large a portion of every constituency whom nothing will influence but claptrap. The smallest amount of reflection is sufficient to dispossess Mr. Berry of any special claim to the merit of introducing a land-tax, seeing that he only modified the proposal of his predecessors and the objection raised to his scheme by Sir James M'Culloch was not because be proposed to tax the wealthy landowners, but because he was unwilling to tax not only the great landowners, but the great house and other property holders. There can be no valid reason why a hundred thousand pounds worth of house property in Melbourne should be relieved from contributing' to the public necessities anymore than ten thousand pounds worth of grass land a hundred miles away in the bush. Mr. Richard Morton's splendid herd of Shorthorns, from which so many stocks in several of the colonies hoTcbcen improved, has now changed hands?, but, fortunately for the colonies, has not been dispersed. There were 37 head, and the whole have been bought with 10 young calves at foot, by Messrs. Robertson, of Colac, for £27,000. The imported Jersey bull Oxford Cherry Duke is amongst them, and the price put upon him was £2600. The Duke's progeny realised at Mr. Morton's last sale (reported in the Sydney Morning Hernia) an average of 1463. Messrs. Robertson's own heart was a good one, but it will now constitute one of the most splendid stocks in this hemisphere. Amongst the agencies which have been called into existence by the philanthropic spirit of the age for combating the multiform in evils of our social life is " Discharged Prisoners Aid Society," and it has accomplished much amongst the male portion of the criminal times in providing inducements to a return to honest industry, and an abandonment of the "road to ruin." The difficulties in the way of dealing with the reclamation of female criminals have hitherto prevented the committee from doing much for them, but the necessity which exists of extending the operations of the society to females has always been present in the minds of the more earnest members, and it has now been determined that some steps shall at once be taken in the direction required. The report of the sub-committee who have had this matter referred to them, says, "The difficulties attending the course to be pursued in the case of female discharged prisoners are much greater than those in connection with male prisoners. The latter can be received into a lodging-house, and from thence be distributed into the country districts, as there may be calls for labour, or assisted to proceed to other settlements where, their past career being unknown, they may have opportunity of returning to the paths of Teeth made and become honest and useful members of society. But female discharged prisoners cannot thus be dealt with. As the time draws near for the expiry of their sentence, their constant inquiry is-' What ' can I do ? Where can I go ? ' And although there are refuges for prostitutes desirous to reform, yet these, however excellent, are not altogether suitable for many of those who come out of prison." The report points out the difficulties of introducing females direct from prison to respectable houses, and' there can be no doubt that some place needs to be' provided in which the good resolutions of those who express a desire to return to virtuous and honest! courses may be tested and some guarantee obtained for their future good conduct. This has been done already with marked success in England and America", where "Refuges" have been established in which the inmates are trained in all branches of domestic service and in needlework, so that, if their conduct warrants it, they may be drafted off into respectable' situations. The Refuge, in fact, acts as a filter between the prison and the public June commence, therefore, say-" It seems, then, that steps should be taken, without delay, to provide an industrial home, under the superintendence of a suitable matron, for the discharged female prisoners, where the inmates would be required to remain for a certain time, and expected to engage in work of various kinds, not only to qualify themselves for future usefulness, but also as a test of their desire to reform, and to aid in defraying the expenses of such an establishment ' It is depressing enough to think about the statistics of crime amongst men, but when we come to con template the fearful effects of woman's degradation under the various forms of guilt ninth hung them under the power of the law, we must all de bil e to aid such efforts as are put forth for their reclamation from the last report of our Inspector General of Prisons we learn that during lbs there were 1290 females retened into our prisons It is quite time therefore that we set about the erection of this "Home of industry in which it may he hoped that many of them may be saved from life-long degradation and hopeless from 'the Sydney postal card having proved such a success, there can be little doubt that our Post Office authorities will soon live to introduce it At present on calms, and even open cards, are sent by post under the picket more general with a penny) stamp but the full benefit of the penny card can only he obtained by such a system as that just adopted in your colony, and which is also used to an enormous extent in England I mentioned in a previous letter that Mr. Coppin had a section on the parliamentary notice paper in reference to it, and yesterday the committee of the Chamber of Commerce determined to urge upon the Government its early adoption We lay not been particularly successful with our literary productions in the shape of magazines, but strenuous attempts at supplying the public with local literature seem to imply the existence of a diminish for it Some of these attempts did not de- sire to succeed, and the failure or success of each 1 as been generally in proportion to the quality of the production Whether Wehner amongst us the requi- rate talent for still higher flights in literature remains to be seen, but some of our writers appeal to think we live, and so a quarterly is to be brought out under the title of the Melbourne Review It is to be similar in size and appearance to the for nightly Since), and to be conducted somewhat on the principles of the latter and of the ( contemporary, and to combine some of the features of a magazine with those of agency There is a somewhat entertaining article in this morning's etc on the latent capabilities of the State cow The number and variety of the rate to whom the Lives constant listening is felt fully wonderful There is no Legislature, for example, every member of which draws his £30 per annum, besides the £14,000 extra which is divided amongst Ministers the extra salaries to President, Speaker, Chair men of Committees, and so forth and the result to the country this year, in subs until legislation, is as yet all But mother instructive feature of State officialdom in the number of those who are always enjoying leave of absence from some cause or other, many of them for several months together The article I am referring to the b " " At the present moment, the two highest esteem in HIL State with the largest Bal iriCB attached to them, are filled by deputy We have on Ailing Governor and an Acting Chief Justice We also other have now orhaiohad, during, the last twelve months, an Acting;

The total amount collected for the Melbourne charities, as far as at present reported is within a fraction of £500, and there will doubtless be some small further additions to the funds even yet. The prevalence of scarlet fever has had the effect of arousing the dormant energies of some of the suburban Councils, as well as the Health Committee of the City Corporation. Steps are being taken to cleanse the miserable dens in which the uncleanly people of our back slums drag out their existence. CeBspith are being closed, waterholes filled up, drain- age improved, and general cleanliness enforced as far as possible and it is hoped that the epidemic will not prove so fatal as was feared a week or two ago. In order that what is done shall be done intelligently and cheerfully, sanitary lectures are being delivered in some of the more populous neighbourhoods. The Central Board of Health are also demanding of the Government some increased powers and amendments of the Public Health Act. One provision, which is said to be in accordance with the Imperial Bill, is " Prevention of Infection The following acts to he punishable Letting infected houses or rooms before disinfected to the satisfaction of the local Board of Health. Owners of public vehicles which have conveyed persons with infectious disease letting the same for hire till disinfected. Persons suffering from infectious disease exposing themselves without precau- tion against the spread of the disease. Persons in whose dwellings infectious disease is present allowing any clothing, bedding, &c;, to be sent out without disinfection. Local Boards to have power to provide temporary hospitals." The Chief Secretary has promised to bring in a short bill to abolish cesspits ; but that is all that can be expected from Parliament in the present ghost of a session.
