A private telegram has been received stnting that the Hero, s.S., formerly employed in the Torres Straits moil service, is to leave Melbourne for Maryborough this morning, with passengers for Gympie. She is, we understand, to be run in the passenger trade between Melbourne and Queensland so long as the rush continues. It is expected her next voyage will be made to Brisbane. She is a full-powered steamer of 800 tons, and is under tho command of Captain Logan. Yesterday morning the schooner-yacht Ham- let's Ghost put to sea on a cruise to the northern parts of this colony. This vessel, which has quito a lillie history of her own, has recently been purchased from the Hon. G. Harris by Count Von Atten, for the sum of £500. Her new owner, we understand, intends taking a pleasure cruise down the coast as far as Cleve- land Bay. The Oamaru Times, of tho 16th Juno, de- scribes " the weather during Thursday, Friday, and Saturday as being perfectly fearful. It rained incessantly from Thursday morning until late on Saturday night, with n stiff breeze, oc- casionally increasiug to the force of a gale from the south and south-east. The barometer fell to 2S-, and the temperature was uncomfortably low ; the whole aspect of the elements being wintrj- and miserable in the extreme. There was a very heavy sea on in the roads, indeed nearly as bad a sea as during the disastrous February gales. Fortunately there were, from Iriday afternoon, no vessels in the bay except the Coomerang, which arrived on the morning ofthat day. The sea, although getting up, was not sufficiently high to prevent her discharging her cargo for this port, which consisted of only a few packages j but shortly afterwards tho heavy rollers which carno in rendered it impos- sible to take anything out to her. about 2 I3.ni. the blue-peter was hoisted as a signal to proceed tosca; and she got up steam and about 4 o'clock Btood out in the teeth of the wind, rolliug a good deal among the breakers. She was anxiously watched until she was seen to weather the point, and considerable uneasiness was felt as to how it might fare with her, seeing that she was very light in the water, and had, it was feared, but a small stock of coal. On Saturday morning two guns were heard, at an interval of about a quarter of an hour, shortly after midnight, and two moro between 9 and 10 a.m. This circumstance, added to tho finding of a pair of cabin doors on tho beach, brought up by the tide, led to gloomy anticipations as to the possibility of the steamer or some other vessel having foun- dered or gone ashore. Up to tho timo of writing this we have heard of no wreck any- where upon the coast, and the Coomerang arrived safely iu Dunedin. [Et ELECTBIC TELEGRAPH.] MARYBOROUGH.
