Spiritualistic Frauds, Mr Blaskelyne, in an interview which appears in the " English Illustrated Magazine," gives the following account of how he first began to suspect the bona fides of spiritualism : â€” " The first awaken- ing of my interest in the exposure of spiritualistic frauds arose in this way. It was during my apprenticeship. Adja cent to our place of business there resided a man and woman who professed to effect cures by mesmerism. About that time table turnirih became a fashionable amusement, and the- Fox family had startled America by a second edition of the - Cock-lane Ghost.' Well, these mesmerists commenced to hold spiritual istic seances, and one day the woman brought to our shop what she called a surgical appliance to be repaired. It con sisted of two levers, a long one and a short one, each mounted upon a pivot attached to a strap, and connected by a piece of catgut. As you may suppose, I en tirely failed to seewhatkind of surgicalap- piiance this thing could be, and wascurious to discover its real use. Raving re paired it, I devoted a few minutes to experimenting with it, and found that by buckling the strap of the short lever round the left ankle, and that cf the long lever round the leg just below the knee, by pressing the right heel upon a projec tion at the side of the short lever the long; one could be jerked up and made to strike" the under-side of the table. Accord ingly, I booked it as a table- rapping apparatus, and the bill was sent in: He- pairs to table-rapping apparatus. Is. fid.' This I considered very sharp on my part at the lime ; but it was about the worst thing I could have done, as it pre vented a complete exposure of these im postors being male. Although several . persons, at my suggestion, attended the seancss afterwards, with the object of catching the lady red-handed, no table- rapping was ever attempted. This was' a lesson by which I profited, greatly in my subsequent investigations."
