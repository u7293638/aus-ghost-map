Liquid Utterances. "I'm an old campaigner," said the man who prefers a corncob pipe to a briarwood "I've helped the boys hustle in pretty near overy State in the union, but the best poll- ucai speech i ever heard—that is, for win ning the crowd H was addressed to—was Up in Colorado. The speaker billed for the occasion was Duric Hudley, and he'd rather face half-a-dozen' guns -than a political audience. But there was nothing that could make Dune run, and when he was introduced by the chairman as one of the gamest men on earth and the next sheriff of the county, he came forward, wobbling and white as a ghost. He told me after wards that his mouth was dry as a load of hay, and that there were cracks in- his throat that you could lay a lead pencil in. Of course he had prepared his speech. "' Feller citizens,' he began In a voice that startled himself, ' when the old flag was shattered and torn—er, I mean when the old flag was tattered and shorn by tot and shell—er, rather,, whfen the fold lag was stattered and horn by stot and hell, boys, you know what I mean, and what I want. Jine me to Broken-nose Mike's place an' run a torch-light proceshlng down yer tbroata.' " The cheers that went up made the next town get ready for an Indian raid, Mike had a rush that cleaned out everything but his mild drinks, and Dune was elected with nothing but 'scattering* to count against him."—" Detroit Free Press."
