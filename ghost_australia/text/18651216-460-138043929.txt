I often thought my brother was mad, from the way hewentODi Mrs. Bettrand, on one occasion,i Sited that Mrs. Kinder was staying in the ouse hefore I came froth Melbourne.

She said that Bertrand and Mrs. Kinder had beev4reanently alone in bed.

It is not a fact that J he. at some lime, .whilst I was redding with him, refused to assist me In pecuniary mat ters. I have never quarrelled with him In consequence of his .refusal, to purchase 1 articles of wearing apparel for me. I do not. recollect saying to him, " You relate ' to; purchase things, for me, bat you spend money oh1 Mrs.' Kinder." I did not tell my brother, before I knew any-. thing of the death of Kinder,' that I had i dreamed of his death, or oif the way In which ' R waB brought about. No allosiou of the hind was made. After prisoner told me that he 1 bald shot Kinder, I might have related to him tbgt my sister in Melopome, on roadlng the report, had said how silly it was to lend 1 pistols to a man who had threatened to ehpot himself. Bertrand never told me that he bad lent Kinder the pistol; the remark arose out of the report , in the paper. I said that I often thought my brother wae mad from the way In whion he went on. I hays said to Mr. Denies that I thought my SfttSKMsnsr be a-tinrwiij -— ~ — -*■ haveriocS and mid what be had. When my ' brother mentioned the, drcumstanceftret, he said h* ^ad 'shot him. Mybjdttef wpi calm at the time he said to. He did not say that' Kinder idled. He merely said , that he had shot him. Ho often stated j that people believed that Kinder had died ; by his own hand. I had not a moment's J peace in the bouse since I heard of the merrier. My brother did not appear anxious to:get |ne out of the house, but quite the contrary, and when I wanted to go he always hindered me. Be always professed to be very fond of roe, and said I was his favourite meter. Although he professed fondness for me, he did not Bhow it by his manner. He Was often very eooentrlc. Even In gaping he would imitate the roar of a tiger, and 'had done It in the street He always professed to have ,an idea that he could mesmerise pcdpK Oil one occasion, when we were epdndlng the evening at Mr. Defiles', Ber trand acted In a very eccentric manner Ml the eight He, put fali flMgCrs np to his i bead to' make horns, and ne'eald he was tha devfl.'
