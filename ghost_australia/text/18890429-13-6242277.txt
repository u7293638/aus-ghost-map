HER MAJESTY'S OPERA HOUSE. "HAMLET." The unfading popularity of Hamlet, and the lively interest excited in the public mind by the appearance of a new exponent of the central character of the tragedy, were attested by the immense audience which as smiled at this theatre on Saturday evening His Excellency the Acting Governor, and a large party from Government house, occupied the central box, and not only was every seat filled in all parts of the theatre but every available inch of standing room was taken possession of, and retained from the rise of the curtain until the close of the performance How completely tins engrossed the attention of that large assemblage was de noted by the absolute silence maintained during the progress of the piece broken only when the gratification of the spectators tonics vent in a burst of enthusiastic in 1 fuse . preliminary objection may be taken to Mr Mdn s Hamlet, on the ground that it is more robust and resolute, stronger in will ml farmer of purpose, more resonant in speech and more energetic in action, more than, sell poised, and self assertive than the ideal Prince It is Goethe s oak tree, not planted, as he says, " in a costly vase, ' but in an iron cylinder, which is not shivered to pieces by the expansion of the roots The simulated insanity is drain ably portrayed, as often as Hamlet sees fit to put an antic disposition on but nowhere does it merge into that real and temporal v enlistment of which the Prince makes such a pathetic and magnanimous confession to Liertes when soliciting his pardon before the duel - ' The presence knows, and you must needs have i ear lie I am pleased 4th a sore distraction What I have done Train alight your nature honour and exception, Known by awake, There j decision was matinees.

Mr. Miln was called before the curtain at the end of every act. Mies Jordan at the close of the fourth and fifth, and Miss Douglas, Mr. Ireland, and Mr. Douglas at the end of the tragedies compliment to which Mr. Cathcart was also fully entitled. We may add that an original dirge, composed by Mr Plumpton, was sung at the burial of Ophelia, and that the tragedy was well placed on the stage throughout. The performance was an unequivocal success, and will be re- peated et ert evening, for a month to come, we should imagine, from its reception on the first night.
