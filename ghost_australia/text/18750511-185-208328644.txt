WHERE ARE THE POLICE ? TO THE EDITOR OF THE STAR. —Yours, &c.;, OBSERVER. SIR, —I was induced to make the above mental en quiry last Saturday evening when proceeding along the Creswick road. On the evening named, at about half- past ten o’clock, there was a mob of about six or eight members oE the larrikin class, whose ages ranged from twelve to eighteen or nineteen, loudly discussing some knotty point in a pugilistic encounter that was to take "place between two' rival members-of- the above mob, and making the night hideous with their oaths and . curses,, which would have done credit to the greatest ruffian ever' turned out o£ Billingsgate. All • this took place within the hearing -of passers-by, in ■fact-' the night was so clear their voices -could be heard for a very considerable distance, yet not so much as- a ghost of a policeman was to be seen. I have no doubt your higher-up contemporary will call this simply the natural and playful exuberance of his pets—the.Yie torian youths. I think, if it is absolutely necessary to the health and well-being of such youths that their playful exuberance should find vent occasionally,-there should be a place set apart solely for their use, where’ they could indulge in their pastime without polluting’ the ears of respectable passers-by, as was the case on Saturday; or, perhaps, the sympathising editor might; accommodate them with a rooin in his office, since he' takes such a delight in their performances.
