A FAMILY ? GHOST CLOCK. Of the fact that strange phenomena exist which people are obliged to accept without' being able to explain^them, says the ' Boh ton'Transcript' (U.S.), the quaint little town of Marblehead furniSheB an instanee in the shape of an old clock, or the almost empty..: case of ohe. bdlooi?ib£ to:MTB. Pitman, who lives on Reed's-hill^jiot far'iFrom the railway ? station. ?'*, Even the mosfc'Bp'cLptical haye been obliged ' to admit its extensive and myBterions work- ' ings and to confesitheir inability to explain the power thatcoirirols.it or to advance any' reasonable thepiy:jip.on the subject. It has been visited .-and' examined - .by thousands « during the past few years— by. clergymen, scientists, a ncfothers of learning arid experi ence — and they haye .all. come . away . satisfied ' ? that there wa?, no^.. delusion or trjckeiy. int what tliey witfnes^ed, and filled with wonder at what they hadiiBeen and heard. . _. . It is siuiply :the: wooden casp . of an ...old- j fasliipned eiriht-.day-clQck, entirely desliiti'te' of works, ana-containing nothing save the coiled wire that qncS formed a portion of tho striking apparatus.'
