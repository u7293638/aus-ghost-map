THE SIL¥ER ATOLL. ? You must allow an old seaman to spin a yarn in 15s own way. What I want to tell about is the story of a Atolls are those coral reefs, or extinct submarine craters, that appear suddenly or gradually above the sur- Mj^f^xKaVyfltd I in time get fringed with palm and cocoanut trees, often a nearly perfect circle of reef surrounding a large-lagoon, with pure white beach glistening in the sun, the calm transparent water inside, and all arojffi ojttidftteg idJtfrJLs^ ana dashing agSinsttne coral CarrieF?

Some forty years ago, there was fitted out in the West f_>[ndiaq. ; Docks; a lftrge, shiprigged craft, frigate build, of over 2500 tons, named the Nadir Shah. Her officers wore -the uniform coats and naval buttons (lion and unicorn) of H.E.I. Co.'s service.
