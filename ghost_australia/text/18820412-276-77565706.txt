THE HAUNTED CHAMBER. A room in the principal inn of a country town had the reputation of being haunted. Nobody would sleep in it, and it was therefore shut up; but it so hap pened that at an election the inn was choke full, and there was only the haunted room unoccupied. A gentle man's gamekeeper came to the inn, ex ceedingly fatigued by a long journey, and wanted a bed. He was informed that unless he chose to occupy the haunted room he must seek a bed else where. " Haunted !" exclaimed he ; "stuff and nonsense! I'll sleep in it. Ghost or demon, I'll have a look what haunts it." Accordingly, after fortify ing himself with, a pipe and tankard, he took up his quarters in the haunted chamber, and retired to rest. He had not lain down many minutes when the bed shook under him most fearfully. He sprang out of bed, struck a light (for he had taken the precaution to place a box of lucifer matches by his bedside) and made a careful examination of the room, but could discover nothing. The cour ageous fellow would not return to bed, but remained watching for some time. Presently he saw the bed shake violently; the floor was firm; nothing moved but the bed. Determined, if possible, to find out the cause of the bedquake, he looked in the bed, under the bed, and near the bed, and not seeing anything to account for the shaking, which every now and then seemed to seize on the bed, he at last pulled it from the wall. Then the " murder came out." The signboard of the inn was fastened to the outer wall by a nut and screw, which came through to the back of the bed, and when the wind swung the sign board to-and-fro the movement was communicated to the bed, causing it to shake in the most violent manner. The gamekeeper, delighted at having hunted up the ghost, informed the landlord the next morning of the real nature of his unearthly visitor, and was handsomely rewarded for rendering a room hitherto useless now quite service able.
