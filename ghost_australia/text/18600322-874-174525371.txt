AN EPISTLE TO PUNCH. By the Ghost of Burns. HOW ha'e ye been my scribblin' brither Since last we met with ane anither, Since last I wrote to ye, I've been Awa to see what could be seen; In touns big'd up wi' rags an' bricks, Renown'd for puddlin' mills an' picks. An' when I've nathin' else to do I'll scribble doun a line or two, To let ye know jist how I thrive there An' some account o' those wha live there; In brief—they're fond o' fun an' revels A lot o' harmless, drunken d-v-ls. While I frae Melbourne ha'e been rangin' I don't see there's been muckle changin'. To catch sma' rogues the law arouses, The big anes still keep countin'-houses; The first, through want may steal a poun' An' soon i' Wintle's he is foun'; The ithers, an' wha does them blame Get a' they can on their guide name, An' whin they find their credit short Like honest men gang through the court, An' offer those to tak' it willin' Twa 'r three bawbees for evra shillin'. O' a' the evils o' the toun I canna see there's ane put doun; The Social ane's nae yet supprest An' lawyers still with lawyers jest; The public-houses still are thrang An' woman's tongues nae slower gang; An' lassies still wi' crinoline Hide fauts they nae like to be seen; An' sportin' men ha'e nae been match'd Sin "Honesty" by thim's been scratch'd; An' wicked folk keep swearin' still While priests their pouch an' stomachs fill. In truth, I'm griev'd that I discover The toun is jist the same as ever. I ha'e foun' out sin I've been gone Wi' politics ye've had some fun. My.auld acquaintance John O'Bragger Na mair thro' William-street does swagger; Tho' Jock was bad, an' a' his force, I maistly think ye ha'e gat worse. As for the gang o' legislators Wha nightly cut sic curious capers; Wha meanly for their bill o' fare Fought, an' did evra thing but swear, There's some o' them wha wad disgrace A rat-pit or less decent place. There's him wha puts that glow'rin face on The blith'rin, legislatin' mason; Democracy in corduroys Renown'd for bosh an' bounce and noise. He undertook an expedition Through some well learn'd chiel's last edition O' Johnson, an' there spellin' out Some words he might hae heard about, Learn'd to pronounce; an'right or wrong, They're always tumblin' aff his tongue. His fu'some, stale, bombastic slang Is like the darkey's boomerang, Going, returning, without aim Always at han' an' aye the same. Tho' ye may think me nae owre nice Charles Jardine Don tak' my advice; To Session—if ye will gang there Before ye do, jist brush yer hair, Mak' fewer speeches an' thim shorter An' stick mair to ye'er stone and mortar. O' those wi whom the country's curst I'll nae jist say puir Don's the worst; To write about them a' the now Wad suit, dear Punch, na men or you, Sae maist o' them I will let pass An' soon's I've fill'd my pipe an' glass, I'll write a bit o' ane or twa, Wha sits where ye the "corner " ca'. I meant to tak' ye to the House Where mony a fool lets his tongue loose, Sketch him wha rides the lang-tailed pony An' his lang-shank'd profess'nal crony, An' Gray, an' Barton, an' a few more, But jist now I'm not in the humour.
