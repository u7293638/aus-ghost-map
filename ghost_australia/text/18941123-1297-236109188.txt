SERMON BY THE REV. THOMAS COOK. A united sendee of the East and West Sydney District Wesleyan Synods was held last night in the Centenary-hall. There was a very large attendance, aud the pre- sident of the conference, the Rev. Joseph Spence, presided, supported by the Revs. S. Wilkinson, J. E. Moulton, and J. Oram. After devotional exercises, conducted by the Revs. O. Stead and R. Bavin, the offi cial sermon was preached by tho Rev. Thomas Cook, the evangelist of the British Wesleyan Conference, who is at present conducting missions in this colony. Tak ing for his text Acts 1, vili. — "But ye shall receive power after that tho Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall bo witnesses unto me"— Mr. Cook said that the mistake Christians o: the present day were mak ing was in looking to Christ like the early disciples, whereas Christ was looking to them. They looked up, God looked down, and gave them power to do His work of evangelising the world. What God sent them us Christians to do in this respect could bo done. There was a sense in which God could not work apart from them; He placed His resources at their disposal. If Christianity was to be an all-conquering power in the world, Christians must be endowed with this Holy Ghost power. The tendency of the times was to resort to hu man agency, rather than to the supernatu- I ral when the work of God was not pro gressing—to cry out for a more cultured ministry and bettor choirs. The great lack to-day was the indispensable power of the IKdy Spirit. Ho had always believed that Pentecost was a specimen day, which God intended to 'repeat. At the close of the sermon the sacrament of the Lord's Sup per was administered to the members of Synod.
