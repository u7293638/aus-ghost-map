C A M P I N G OtU T BY " SPOOK.' On the Thursday before Easter, Waggs proposed that he and I should spend the )iolidays m a ''-campmg1out '' and fishing expedition, somewhere in the -country .v Now, of J ate. years, I • have not been very . partials ,to _,rthe "camping out" craze, holding it- folly • on the J pa.rt of man,. ta .sleep-;,ott-:. the ; ground in the bush, perhaps:: in the \- happy hunting grounds of snakes^aTid other creeping things, too JiumerJUS ito mention, when he might just as well spend the night comfortably :n bed, in the sanctity of a well appointed ..bedroom; I had; vivid :ro ollectious too, of a former" camping out" expedition, in winch I once took part, when it raiiied the whole tune j :ancb my enthusiasm in micli pleasure rcc.'ived a damver oil that occasion, from which I. had never quite recovered. I mildly pro-: tested to "Waggs .that the ..season-."was too far advanced, and that.it,was-possible to make a country excuvsiou and* fishing expedition' without indulging rathe inconveniences attendant upon "camping out." and he replied tha • - ..OrV I'.mip Y.C. toO IVrtM'lcial, and to pToperly -ci-iioy v. Oountvy excu-sion one must spend.; the nights 'neath the star-spalngle ' cauppy of heaven. Waggs has lately become poetically inclined, and spolfe. tbusly " Spook, my boy, let us leave the 7 busy turmoil and smoke and grime of town and study nature on her •• secluded haunches; let us s?et-a-breath of country air on to our lungs;; inhale God's glorious oxygen id some grassy dell, or on some woodland slope, stretch our weary limbs on some green and mossy sivard. Let us,, my boy, go and cool our feve ed brows and linger awhile in some peaceful sylvan glade and list to the sweet songs of birds, and the murmuring of the brook, aiid moralise." His eloquence overpowered me—jis it generally does—anil I consented We started that very day, taking With us a run each, a. billv, a tomahawk, implements to pursue the gentle art of, Izak Walton, and sundry other littl necessaries, and, lnte in the afternoon of that name day, we fmiud ourselves camped on the banks of tlie Upper Yarra, a considerable distance frimi any large centre of civilization. •- As, will be remembered, it was a-gloiious dav, and the scene which - met• our view, as we "called a halt," was indeed picturesque, and the objections to the expedition, which I had previously expressed, quickly vanished. Away down to the water's edge, stretched; a; densely wooded slope, on the top of which a modest^mansioh rose," still, while it rose, it seeuied to sleep in calm repose; as tho*'it had had/a 1 hard' strug-" g'.e to get up there, and having rgpt there had plumped itself down without any intention of budging. I drew Waggs's attention to the house onihe hill--which was budt m a Venetian, Grecian, Swiss, Italian or Home--other.- ioi-eign style. • Waggs said, with a -.. look. o£ vrxsdom-^ tKat xt-waa" a: :^-.cVvattO-" ,. : .X thought o£v the. i: n:vbl. cmd o n • Publisher oi. t,"u:\t Yirvme, :n\d-t^YivV. I didn't know "'twas thereabouts he dwelt." (You will notice h'nv catching poeticisms are, especially where there's romantic scenery to hatch the germs ) The banks of the river were lined-ail 1 canopied o'er with giant tree ferns; out of whose brown and massive columns gpew stag-horns and wild creepers: The river, at that place; is not a sewer. It is a crystal stream, flowing gently o'er sand and shingle, and /kissed at its, edge, on either side,; by countless varieties of small ferns and verdant beds of springy moss, equalling if not surpassing anything ever seen in a Collins st'eet flower -shop.! "Wild; blips also grew in gret).fc profusion there, and mingled, their suggestive odors with that of wild musk ; but the descriptive business, in such " 'prentice han's." as' mine; is apt to grow monotonous, so tl]e rest I must lea"ve to your imagination. Sufficient be it.to say,-that we dvank in the splendour: of -the scene eagerly 7 accompanied with copiouS:inps of some special blend of mountain-dew —appropriate to the; occasion, which ^aggs had ..taken, cave to .iiiclude 1 amongst tbe refeshmenls;' just by way of calming our. entljijsiasnv—as he remarked, but, sqmehow the beauiy of the sqene, refreshing. ; as it; seemed, ; gradually overpowered usj and slowly, but surely sank.we down ouour. sjiill un- . packed kits. The lmptessiveness of tlie situatiop was upon ...us; Silence, only broken by the music of birds, or a dis- ' tant cow b°ll, reigned supreme. Hot a word passed between us, tho' something-else in a glass bottle, may occasionally have done:. so ; and then we • >•' became further: overpowered, rand \- dozed. In -calm meditationon- this r-- circumstance,Intersil,.we unanimously -:• -ascribed it to the peculiar nature and ; \- quality of the oxy-g'in, about that par- \- ticular locality. Once, J awoke and gazed at Waggs; who snored loudly.
