AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN. By Peter 'Possum. "If you're waking, call me early call me early, Bridget dom, was my poetical appeal last night to my Hibernian handmaiden and Bridget, for a wonder, chancing to wake before 7,1 was called in time to see The sunlight sheathed and gently channell, Of all Its sparkling r lys disarmed, And as in slumber laid Calling to mind how often I had been " in slumber laid " at the unseating of his right, I hardly liked to look the sun in the face before his obscuration It seemed so ridiculous in ino, so rude to him, to be getting up at that un eensonsnblo hour not to see him An eclipse of the sun is a rare phenomenon, but so to most of us is his rising I am almost ashamed to say that, in the whole course of my life, I have only once witnessed his levee I was sleeping on the deck of the little Vii id-darting through the calm summer waters from Cairns to Dover, swift and graceful as a mackerel when I was roused by the gruff old steel small with a "Look at that, an It's a sight, I'm thinking, you don't often see " The eastern sky was mottled with a mantling red, recalling the sweet old world myth of the rose sprinkling hours The bridegroom was about to come forth from his chamber A segment of the golden disc was just above the waves, and as it ascended in kingly stateliness, " unhasting, unresting," majesty, Us dazzling glory, shooting horizontally along the sea, turned the water into blushing wine-as though in sacramental memory of the beginning of miracles" wrought by the trans Hunter s sacred Antitype, the Sun of Righteous news itself an emblem of the cargo mg change His mission was to work in the whole life of man The blush vanished but myriad spangles glittered on the gentle heaving waves, and the wheeling sea bird's wing, and here and there a streak of cloud-left, white and lonely as a lingering snow wreath, on the deep blue sky exchanged their spotless purity of line for our nished brilliance The cliffs on both sides of the channel-waking, as it seemed drew back their veils of lavender mist, and smiled a sisterly 1 good morrow " to each other across the mirror that reflected the fair forms And over all the sun glowed grandly beautiful, graciously Bubhmc, as though it were the visible, all see ing eye of God Like a Persian, I could have fallen down and worshipped And you a sight like this we might see almost every morning if washes " the scene of an untutored age," says corner, and the indolence of every age, add I, " passes by unheeded the ordinary appear mice of nature, but our interest is easily aroused, our attention is readily enchained, by such mysterious portents as the earthquake and too eclipse She is blind to the common and familiar phenomena of light, she is deaf to the common and familiar phenomena of sound , she has eyes only for the lightning , ears only for the thunder She asks with eager curiosity On o fulminis asset alike - Jupiter, au vent discusses nubotonaront' But she leaves unquestioned the normal or every day presentments of the senses and the universe , she pays the tribute of admiration to nature's exception far more promptly than to her majestic rule " However, it is " nature's exception or rather widely revolving rule, with which we are now concerned. The chimney tops and gables are brightening in the sunlight as I dress , its red beaten bronze the foliage above which they peas, and window panes flash out like laughing eyes But when I reach my post of observation-a promontory towering high above the harbor-the sky is muffled up in clouds A patch of watery orange in the cast, faintly decked with distant spars, alone points out the position of the sun A Bickly shimmer, a fading memory of light the very ghost of dawn plays on the leaden waters, wherein dark ships float motionless, circled with shadow the city on the opposite shore, as its coverlet of mist is slowly filled aside, has a law, dreary, half wakened look St James' steeple, for a moment tipped with gold, points like a finger to the heavens , but a huge chimney belched forth its smoke, and blots the momento of Bupeinul things, with an infernal eagerness, from the view-meet type of the influence of foul and busy city life Groups, silent and awe struck, like those Defoe has painted in his History of the Plague," stand looking up into the sky Suddenly a gloom spread, through the air like ink dropped into water The out cropping rocks beneath me put on a sterner frown The forge fire yonder blossoms into ruddy glow like a gigantic rhododendron flower The church bells ringing for morning prayers tolls dismal as a knell the workman ceases from his labor, and stops his laugh and song There is a wintry coldness in the whispering wind And then-" at one stride comes the dark " The Boa turns livid- ghastly blue as the face of a cholera victim Houses and trees dis- charge their color, and crouch unseen beneath the pall of blackness, with bead fringe of tawny dusk, that hangs over earth and hides the heaven Gradually, like the look of life returning to the face of one who has fainted, light steals again over land and sea , grows moment tardy brighter, and yet more bright Nature has recovered from her syncope, and scores of cocks with their shrill clarion trumpet the advent of the second dawn StfE Ol' TKK Stabs How large are the stars and are they alike, or do they differ in size p It used to be conjectured, that they are of somewhat similar magnitude, presumably about as great as our sun, and that the differences of apparent size are due to differences of distance ; but when astronomers came to discover that some of the smaller stars are the nearest to our system, this idea fell to the ground. A German computer has now, however, calculated the actual dimensions of one particular star, and finds that its mass is rather more than three times that of the sun. The star in question is of less than the fourth magnitude-a comparatively small one. What, then, must be the size of those of the Sirius and Aldebaran class The reason of its selection for this determination was, that it is one of the components of what is called a binary system-two years revolving about each other like sun and planet and the motions of the members of such a system afford data for the computation The stars distance from us is a million and a quarter times that of the earth from the sun, so that light takes twenty years to travel either from it - Once a Week As Inch of Rain -We often hear the question asked What is an inch of rain? A late weekly return of the Registrar General of England gives the following solution, combined with other information with regard to rainfall, which will be interesting at the present moment - Rain fell in London to the amount of 0 43 inches, which is equivalent to 43 tons of rain per acre. The rainfall during one week varied from 30 tons per acre in Edinburgh to 395 tons per acre in Glasgow. An English aero consists of 6,272,610 square inches, and an inch deep of rain on an acre yields 6,272,640 cubic inches of rain, which at 277,271 cubic inches to he gallon makes 226,322 gallons, and, as a gallon of distilled water weighs ten pounds, the rainfall on an acre is 225,225 pounds avoirdupois , but 2240 pounds are a ton, and consequently an inch deep of rain weighs 100,993 'one, or nearly 100 tons per acre If any agriculturist were to by the experiment of distributing artificially that which nature so bound Early supplies, he would soon feel inclined to rest and be thankful.'
