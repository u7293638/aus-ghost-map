Then his lordship rides into shops, hotel-halls, and such like, to collect his tribute, and ill f.W fn™ ™iJ refuse to pay it.' I ' Why, that is plainly from us, too,' said Griacomo ; 'those are precisely the sports of our Italian carnival. The difference is. that we have innumerable others, whereas you here seem to retain but that one of our Shrovetide sports.' j 'You can find no religious origin for that CRn you?' more archly than before. Well ! of course not, but still it is an old ^ciuionc custom, indicating the approach of the pemtential season, when all public amusements are suspended.' «lTJf\ is so true,' said Miss Ackland, tnat i believe it is only in one or two other towns or cities of Ireland that the custom is still observed ; these, of course, are the most thoroughly Catholic— in all the other locali ties the Shrovetide mummeries have lone ! since tallen into disuse, and been forgotten. But I see you have finished your tea, Gia como, had we not better set out at once, the sun will soon go down 1' , 'The very thing I was wishing for, we snail lose the finest of the evening, if we delay much longer.' | bometwenty minutes' walk broughtthem to I theromantic heights of Rathmullen, with the j road crossing the top of the bold bluff, wind ing away around the hill-side, disappearing even from Jthe view under the dense shade of overarching beeches, elms, and sycamores ? the sun streamed down all goldenly through the tangled branches, forming a net-wqrk of i yellow ;hght_ on the well- paved road be I ~v,«,uu, nj.nu. ius-gr«iso»uuugecj siaewaiics, and I its hawthorn hedges, all blooming then in | their summer garb of white, and filling the i air withtheir delicious fragrance. The sun i was setting in the crimson west far over the sea, and the waters far and near, the sea and the river, were tinged with the same roseate hue. j Never did Ariel's plume, At golden sunset hover, O'er scenes of richer bloom than those which lay beneath that evening sky from the storied heights of Oldbridge, and its graceful commemorative Obelisk, to the Boyne's mouth ai Bettystown, with the I ancient and picturesque town between, girt round, as it were, with mouldering relics of the past. ?' And this,' said Giacomo, 'is the Rath mullen Road,' as he turned to take a part- j ing glance at the near surroundings and the far prospects. ' What a lovely spot it is this green quiet nook, so hicrh abovo t.h* river, and commanding such a view ! Truly existence might glide smoothly away amid such scenes as these. How my father would I appreciate this ! But,' he added musingly, 'it is more than probable that he lias seen it.' ' ' I Has your lather, then, been here in Drogheda? asked Miss Ackland, stoopin* to pick up something from the grass at her teet. ' What have you got there, aunt T said Rose in her girlish way. 'A four-leaved shamrock, my dear !' _ 'Oh! give it to me, give it to me.' c.rieA ltose clapping her hands. | 'Nay,' said Miss Ackland, in a jesting OTJ-i Cann10fc afford t0 «ive away my luck. If I did you know I might foifeit the favour or some benignanttfairy.' Giacomo looked 'puzzled, whereupon Miss Ackland explained to him the popular super stition concerning the four -leaved shamrock promising that she or Rose would sing for him, perhaps^ that evening, Lover's beauti ful ballad of that name, one of the songs of the superstitions of Trplar-/i ? ° I ' I'll seek a fouHeaved shamrock In every fairy dell,' hummed Eose, -catching the word, and she would probably have continued the song be ing bent, it would seem, on showing just then the greatest amount of ease, but all a once she stopped short, and said— Melville^1 d?l00kI wh?- there is Major .ruiiu. .--u xv w-ia mo .major mmseit and alone walking slowly with his hands behind his' back, and his eyes fixed on the ground like one whose thonghts were of engrossing in terest. ? . He started on seeing the party, and con itraryto Miss Ackland's expectation, raised his cap as they passed. Tfis pvpg rocfn/i f^ a.moment on Miss Ackland with a sort of ?Ke#kS(?ufclny' then turned to the young man |O^hpse arm she leaned, and the one who ^$PM him understandinglyreither saw, or thought she saw, a strange intensity in that momentary glance, as though he would fain uavciuunDuwnger. u-iacomo Had caught the glance, and he said when the officer was out of hearing— 'And that is Major Melville ; I wonder why he looks so earnestly at me.' Then he ! thought of Eose, and her admiration of the Major, which, from all he had heard, -might well beymutual. ' 6 ' Because he sees vou are a fWio-nnn » ! suggested Miss Ackland, giving the only probable reason she could think of. Rose smiled but she said nothing ; whatever her thoughts were she kept them to herself. Miss Ackland's reason seemed to satisfy Giacomo m a matter of so little importance, and he dismissed, or appeared to dismiss the matter from his mind. Having accom panied the ladies home he bade them good bye at the door, declining Miss Ackland's invitation to so in. .'' I am leaving town early to-morrow,' | said he, il and I shall not see you for some [days.' said Ka'' y°U ^ g°inS;:i° ?' uertamiy ; i nave been often asked by | Mr. oallman to go with him the next time he visits his herring fishery on the coast of Scotland, and as he goes to-morrow I think of going with him ; not that I expect much I from the excursion, but, as I have never seem any part of Scotland, I may as well take this opportunity of having a glimpse of And I know you will be pleased that I you went, said Miss Ackland ; ' those fish eries are on the Lochaber coast in the wildest region of the Highlands, l know Mr. Calli- i nan usually starts early when he goes, so I shall not insist on your remaining this even ing, expecting, however, to see you verv quuu tii icr _yuur return. I He promised with all good will, and then commenced his descent of the lon» flight of steps with the lightness and agilityof youth ? the ladies watched him in silence till he turned at the gate below and waved a smiling farewell, then disappeared behind i the high walUhat skirted the road. uuut! aai-u- it^ac, iu a, way nair ]est, half earnest, as they walked to and fro on the esplanade in the darkening twilight, while the stars came peeping through the blue in the depths above, « Aunt, . did -you observe what a thoughtful anxious look; Major Mel ville had that time when we met him and' how sharply he looked at you and ?Gia'. como ? i j A.«ian * observe it,.' said Miss Ack Eose ?m g- y°U did» ma Me™ petite I ''And he saluted you verv eracionslv t t could scarce believe my eyes after what you told me of his manner of speaking to vou at ! your last meeting.' 'At our only meeting ; I had never seen Guy— I mean Major Melville— before that evening. ' It was- all along of the four leaved sham- I rock, aunt, said Eose with her arch smile 'Who knows what form vnm- in^L- «,„,! [ take ? Heigho 1 1 wish I could find a fou'r leaved shamrock, or some other token of good luck !' And she sighed with such a comical look of doleful despondency that her aunt could not help laughing. 'Never mind my dear, we shall at worst, find 'luck for you at Painstown with -.worthy Mr. Ledwich, or nearer home with our friend Harry Cusack.' ' Yes, by way of dernier ressort—mimy ' thanks,_ Aunt Lydia, but 1 could not think ot depriving you of either of two such con stant swains, who, to my knowledge, have been bowing full fifteen years before your £if hlft Hkf y,°,U1^ Edwin in Goldsmith's love'' they ' neV6r talk Of 'Pie, fie, ifose! you cannot, I am sure, longer mistake the nature or the obiecfc of Ousack s attentions. Harry has little taste lor ancient maidens of such very mature years as mine. Come, let us go in, it wears late, and the dew is falling.' A week or so had passed before Giacomo again made his appearance, and ; then- he was so tull of what he had seen and heard that for some days he could speak of nothing, but :he wild grandeur of the scenes amid which he had been sojourning, so different from anything he had ever seen before. He would said, and far her still, to. stand In one' of hose steep hill sides « Among the Highland heather, to inhale those mountain breeds, and look forth over the waste of waters froS the dizzy height where the eagle sheltered H? h^ lg^ ^ U^ f? -thf Voiqeless solitude. He had lodged with his friend in a cottage, of one of the^shermen, and had heard with: de light, by the evening fire, .the wild supersti .on or those Scottish Gael, there of a wilder character still, from .t.hp non-fo,.;,,,. i,-!-.-,-1 « ^people Marvellous tafefof ^cond.^h had he heard and ghost stories that m ,de the blood curdle m one's veins, and of shapes that fashioned themselves from, the gray mountain mists to warn those simple chil dren of the Gael of impending death or doom ? of maidens white and fair, . but with neither flesh, nor blood nor bone, who appeared at the prow of the lonely come, to apprize the nshermen of danger at hand. Th™ ,tkaM- were legends of faithful love, and dark re venge, and.wild adventure, and all, the many towns and that romance is likely to assume amongst seacoast mountaineers. ' And. then the ' bonnie Jeans' of Highland ? song, said Eose with her characteristic smile ; ?' who has not heard of Lochaber in connection with a^ertain rustic fair one,- the beloved of some 'Highland laddiV .!,« L^ like that other famed in Scottish song, tf to nght the French, or some foreign foe -f for King George upon his throne ?'' . ' 'I for one, never heard of either,' said Giacomo. . . . . ?lfl^haiV! ?°U! huTe. ncver heard ei««=r (To be contimied.)
