Does sigh among the oak leaves sere In eerie prophesy of fate. -The dead boughs groan and creak with pun] When their dry bones aside are swayed. Their sere leaves sing the old refrain Of life awaste and youth decayed. There range the ghosts of wasted days, 'Mid croak of ravens, wail of winds ; Still on they wend their tortured ways, Nor eaBe the torment of their minds. * - * * * * There is a garden, calm and bright. Where all the winds of heaven meet In zephyrs soft as morning light, And brooks in merry laughter greet, Clear are Che waters of the streams, And cool the shades of leafy 'bowers, The birds sing out their waking dreams. The air is sweet with soent of flowers. There rest the souls of rich and poor, The king, the peasant, and the pope ; Wide open always stands the door. The only passport— Faith and Hope.
