A GHOST'S VENGEANCE. The Ooek-Iane ghost is a very famous one, perhaps chiefly, from the fact that old Samuel Johnson was largely concerned in it. Here is the story in brief. In 1756 Mr. K., of Norfolk, married Miss E. L. In less than a year the wife died, and her sister Fanny came to keep bouse. Fanny and Mr. K. were married after a while, though at first Mr. K., not liking the match, ran away from hie ardent ai6ter-in-law. After their marriage ^hey went to Jive in Cock lane, m ttie house of Mr. Parsons, clerfc ^M of St. Sepulchre's. Duriuk Mt Kft -iil absence little Elizabeth Parsons, lWlan& 51 lord's daughter, slept -with Mrs. K. Both jm of them 'were disturbed by strange t 'M switchings and rappings' The Jatfl- *S§| lord a wife thought the cobbler nest door M was at the bottom of it. Having ouar- rM, relied with Parsons, Mr. K. and his wife Jl Fanny went to live in Clerkenwell, where ,4|| she died of smallpox, as the physician and -? s£ apothecary testified. After 18 months ^M (why was the ghost silent so long?) the M noises in the (Jock-lane house began * ^ again. - ^ A girl who was attending the medium— \ Mary Frazcr was her name — suggested that the ghost should be talked with by * means of raps, one rap meaning 'ye» ' two no. Shrewd girl that Mary i -azer. , Ihe ghost rapped out its message, lanhy ' had been poisoned by Mr. K. with retl - arsenic in a draught of purl, for wliict Fanny, it appeared, had a liking. The vin dictive ghost added that it— we mean she — wished to see K. hanged. Then followed public examinations of the child, at whieh Dr. Johnson, among other celebrities, was present; and the end of it was that Far sons, Mary Frazer, and several others were tried at the Guildhall and convicted of a conspiracy on July 10, 1762.
