TEINITY COLLEGE NOTES. (Fkom our own Correspondent.) Owik:i probably to the fact that our Honour students form an unusually large percentage of the whole, and that October is coming on apace, there is very little to chronicle from Trinity this month, as an atmosphere of steady work pervades the place. Early in June we met Ormond in the annual football match, but though for a very long time the game . was very even, our opponents at last proved too strong for us, and won by two goalsto none. However, this is an imm'ovement on last year, which again was an improvement on 1892, so that we are steadily creeping up, and hope next year to win one or both of the football and cricket contests. On Wednesday, June 27th, there was a pleasant break in the monotony of work in the periodical ' Ladies' Night' of the Dialectic Society. The subject was, ' That this Society believes in Ghosts ;' and after a long discussion, in which the majority of the speakers persistently refused to treat spooks seriously, it was resolved, on the casting vote of the Warden, that the Society didn't. We are looking forward with great interest to our Prselector's annual address, which is to be given in the Athenaeum on Monday evening, July 16th. The Prffilector (Mr. F. J. Lynch, B.A.) has chosen as his subject, ' Was Man Born to be Happy? or, the Hedonistic Theory of Ethics;' and we expect a most interesting and powerful speech.
