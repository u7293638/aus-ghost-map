Or.'Iaurens said .that-his .motion:' did' not argno the -propriety or-otherwise of annexation. The reason be jlesired. to know the tarms, was simply, that hs was familiar with an Act passod at the olose of last BBasion, half of iwhioh. was his own, and no;annexation could take place excopt in terms agreed: upon, by the council and tho city. -The question of terms was a moat important o^e au4 the lOih Bectjon of the >Act:he jreferrodito, .showod:of no. reason iwby, in the event of annexation,- the byelawe of the city abould not prevail: and theirs be . abrogated, although this need not' of -necessity: bs.

Special charges could be imposed outside tho city rata and it did'uot follow bBcause thoy joined the oity .that there::would bo only one imposad ron themi.': Referring to clause 8, he was glad iorsee that Or King, at the first publio meeting on the annexation- question,was assiduous to assure his hearers that the,Gonncil's, officers and men would not bo left in the lurchj nor would the town hall be interfered with, but if. this were-so. tbora would bo. littlo saving in the matter :nf administrates. They, must know-.officially,, if there knowledge was to. be worth anything, from the City '.Council...'what ithay would do in tha event of -annexation.: Or Barwise had said that lie hoped the North Melbourne Councillors would bo in tho Oity Conncil, but-he would ask :n as it possible for those nine gentleman:,or half of them to represent one ward!

An article in tile Argus pointed out the desirability for annexation,-and tho tendenoy of all the suburban: Councils,to seek re-union- with the city.This was-a laboured afiair of Or LaurenB'aud no doubt.the.matter .would require; a doal of consideration, but ,a .' ghost of a motion'like the one on the notice paper, :would have no effect. . It was'decidcd .to continue tho debate: : Cr fogarty seoonded Cr Laurena' motio 1 and said the Council should not go at 1 baldlieaded, but consider every line of it, as It was most important-and'the ratepayers ; should kuoiv what- tho effect of annexation would be if it .beoame .law. What guarantee had they that-if thoy wore represented asv a:ward ; among- 28 City Councillors, that - no special burdens wonld.be imposed on them.- Or Barwise said,the'Oity Oouncil would never look -at Cr Laurcne' queBtions, and the time had come when the annexationists would-have: something to say.
