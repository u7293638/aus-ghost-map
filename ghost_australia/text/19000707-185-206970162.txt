THE LADY FROM NOWHERE. A DETECTIVE STORY. CHAPTER XXV.— HOW THE DEED WAS DONE. BY FERGUS HUME. Author of "The Mystery of a Hansom Cab,” "The Lone Inn," "The Third. Volume,” "Ma'dame Midas." "The Nameless City,” "For the De fence,” etc. PUBLISHED BY SPECIAL' ARRANGE MENT. Gebb quite agreed with Parge, regard ing the guilt of Alder; and on looking back over the collective evidence, he wondered that he had not suspected him before. No wonder be had come forward to defend Ferris; for bad as he was, the. marr had some conscience, and did not wish to see a guiltless person hanged for his crime, even though that person was his rival in love.- What'Gebb could not understand was, why Alder had been so hind to Dean; and it was to ascertain this amongst other things that he left Parge as soon as he was able, and went off to Alder’s rooms. The man was dy ing ; and for the clearance of all persons concerned in the matter, it was abso lutely necessary that he should make a confession of his guilt, even at the eleventh hour. “ I could tell you much that I have dis covered,” said Gebb, slipping the incri minating letter into his pocket, “but as Alder is dying, there is ho time to he lost in getting him to confess.” “I agree with you,” replied Payge, promptly. “I knew that he was dying, as I saw an account of his accident in the papers. Get him to confess, and for that purpose take Air Basson with you as a witness; then come back to me, and tell me everything. I wish to write out all details concerning this very extras ordinary case, and put the report in my collection.” “It certainly merits it!” replied Gebb, putting on his hat, “and I daresay this confession .will be the most wonderful of all. By the Why did not the ser vant give up this letcer before?” “Because she is a cunning, artful, little minx,” burst out Parge in great wrath, “ and wished to make money over it. She found it, as I told you, while cleaning out the grate, when the room was Stripped by Alder. The letter was torn across, as Miss Gilmar evidently did not think it worth while to. adopt Alder’s advice and burn it. It was lucky she did not, or her death would have gone un avenged ; as it is ” “ As it is. the man will escape the law,” interrupted Gebb, “but I daresay he’ll be punished somehow. I’m sure he de serves to be. Did Airs Presk know of Tilda’s discovery?” - h “ No! Tilda kept the discovery to lier self; and intended to sell her informa tion to the highest bidder. It took me two hours to wring the truth and the letter out of her; but I did in the end, and for the evidence I paid- her five pounds.” “I’ve no doubt Aliss Wedderbum will pay you when she comes into the es tate.” “ Whalb, the five pounds!” exclaimed Parge, wrathfully. “ Why, I expect the reward.” “ But the reward was to be paid by Al der himself,” argued Gebb; “and al though it was a blind you can hardly ex pect tlie man to pay for his own detec tion.” “His next heir must pay for it!” said the ex-deteotive, doggedly. “Aliss Wedderbum is the next heir.” “ Then I’ll apply bo her,” cried Parge. “ I’m going to be paid for my trouble.” “ Seems to me, Simon, I’ve had all the trouble,” said Gebb, dryly. “You’ve sat in your arm-chair and done no thing.” “I’ve found out the truth, if'you call that nothing,” retorted Parge, growing red. “I’ve used my brains, which is more than you have done. - There is life in the old .dog yet-, Absalom!” “And temper also,” rejoined Gebb, who was rather sore about the -reward. - “Eh, Simon? Well, well! We’ll argue, the matter hereafter. I must go to Al- 1 der.” “Don’t forget to take Basson!” “No, I won’t. But if you are right about Alder you are wrong about Dean; : he did not till Kirkstone.” “Then who did?” grunted Parge, rac ther'displeased. - . : “ Miss Gilmar herself!” retorted Gebb, and departed swiftly, leaving to ; his' friend this—ibo.Mni: —indigestible mor sel. Parge raged a trifle after Gebb had gone, as he did not like to be'put in’ th* wrong, but when he recollected Ms' triumph in the new murder case, he was cjuite content to set it against his failure in the old one.: So he sat placidly, in his arm-chair, and enjoyed his success,-:-arid; the prospect of getting two hundred pounds with so - little' trouble. - \ All of ! which was satisfactory to his wife also ; as it kept Parge in a good temper for one; entire day, a state of things' which was i little less than miraculous in'-that fre-! quently disturbed household.. In the_ meantime Gebb, with a desper ate fear in his heart that he.might-betoo late, went as quick as a hansom could! travel .to Basson’s rooms. Keeping the. cab'at the door, , he ran dp the‘long stair case so quickly thAt!he; arrived at the top with failing breiatb:sand 'hearing-heart.' The perennial legend,Back in five mi-' . nutes,’’ was still on the barrister’s- door, and Gebb, on knocking, was again greet ed iby the boy. in -the small suit. This lat ter admitted that his master, was ait' home, hut stated; that . he could not ho seen.' “ ’Cos he ain’t well,” explained' Cerberus; “He’s.had a shock.” “ What kind of. a shock?

Perhaps, however, there is. the excuse that he did the-deed, in a fit of rage. From what-1 have heard of Miss Gilmar, she was a woman to irri tate an archangel.” . Basson shook his head. - “ There is not even that excuse,” he said-. “The crime was committed in cold blood.-.

Alder was desperately hard verge of' bankruptcy ;, and as his.cousin refused to Kelp him he killed her. .To gain her wealth was the motive of, the act. Well,” added Basson with a sigh,!“ he did not enjoy his ill-gotten gains long; for in the midst of his prosperity the -band of God struck him down.” . “ You have the confession', you sayp” - “Here it is!” " Basson unlocked the drawer of his desk, and took out a sheet, or, to. be precise; several sheets of 'paper, and handed them to Gebb. The detec tive turned.to the 'end, saw- the three-sig natures, then slipped the papers into Ms pocket. - - -y. “It will take -too long reading this just, now,” he said, apologetically, “and I have much to. do. Will you be so kind, Mr Basson, as to tell me the facts in your ■ own way? lam curious to know how so many people concerned in the case came to -he collected in -Grangebury on the night of the murder.” -. “Alder collected them,” said Basson, nodding; “he planned the. whole affair ■in a most wonderful manner, so as to throw suspicion of the crime .on everyone hut Mmself. Had he lived he would have escaped all suspicion.” “I tMnk not,” replied Gebb, feeling for the letter he had -received from Parge, “Ms own handwriting would have com mitted; him. This is one of those little accidents -which mar the plans of the most accomplished criminals. However, that is neither here nor there. Let me hear the confession.” y -■ Basson thought for a moment, then be gan. “It seems that Miss Wedderbum was not the only person Miss Gilmar., wrote to; she corresponded also with Al der about business matters;-.'for, as she had left her property to him 1 by will, she. did not think that he would betray her to Dean. Asa matter of fact, she was simply putting temptation in the man’s way; for Alder was desperately hard up,' and .was looking forward to. the time when he would come into possession of Miss Gilman’s . money. However, she did not know that, and kept him advised i of her changes of address.” ! “ Did he know that she was in Grange bury?” _ ' ; “ Oh, yes; but he did -not visit her ] there, for already he was thinking of get- 1 ting rid of her by violent means. The difficulty was how to do it .without in criminating Mmself. Then'-' two acci dents helped Mm. The first was that while .on a visit to' Earkstone.Edith.told Mm that she was bent on getting the necklace for Arthur Ferris, and.was go ing up to Grangebury on the evening of the 24th July to get it. Ferris; she said, was to. escort her. . Later-on, wMle Al der was still in the "Hall,-Dean' told how he had discovered Miss Gilmar’s confes sion, and wished to give it to: me. ; He was afraid, however, to. come to my of fice lest he should bo recognised. Aifiter warda' Alder induced me to lecture at- Grangebury, and wrote to Dean telling him to come upand seentehhere." %Tsieni he gave Ferris tickets for my lecture,' and told .Min he .could wait for .-Miss JWeader b,urn;, in; the Town "Ball,;. while, 'she .went, to see Miss .Gilmar.'; / So‘, now you see',; Mr Gebb, that on - the .

On the table there ■lay. a‘ cheque ; for" two hundred pounds,- made payable to Absalom Gebb, and sign \- ed by Edifch Wedderburh._ The conver nation was mostly about this cheque; and "how it should be divided between them so as to compensate each with duo fair ness. The matter was a delicate one, and could not be' settled without some sharp words on either side. ■ : ‘ \- “ After mil, Sirnibn,” remonstrated Gebb' in vexed tones j “ I" did most of the work; and deserve'the reward for. my pains:” • ’• • 1 “ You don’t deserve all of it,” retorted .Parge/captiously. .

And it was me who found out the mur derer. So in-justice I ought to have the whole two hundred pounds.” Gebb snatched up the cheque and slip ped it into his pocket; “ If you talk like that you won’t have a single penny;” he cried wnatMully, for he was disgusted with the avarice of his coadjutor.. “ In the goodness of her heart Miss Wedder ‘bum considered that she would pay the •reward out of the estate, and did so—to me; there was nor word, of 'von, M Parge, when she signed this cheque.” “ I daresay not,” growled.

The confes sion of Miss Gilmar shows that she killed. Kdrkstone, and the evidence of the hotel keeper of the Golden Hind proves that Dean slept there at the very hour of the murder.

Asa matter of fact, in the face of that confession, Miss : Wedderburn need not have paid the reward to any one. .However, she thought that I de served payment for all my work,, so she gave me this money.

Parge, fiercely, “you can take the best part of the reward if you choose, but you shan’t throw dis credit on my past work. I conducted the Kirkstone murder case to the best of my ability.” “rAnd punished the wrong man.” “That was the force of circum stances.” “ It was the want of getting the neces sary evidence,” retorted Gebb, .with some heat. “However, we have improved since then in detective matters, as in others.” “ Oh, have you!” growled Parge. “ Then why did you arrest the .wrong man in the person of Ferris ?” “Yon have ine there; S’imon 3 you have j me there,” laughed Gebb'; which admis sion put Parge into great good, humor, j “And criminals! nowadays are not as I stupid as they were in my youth,” he i said,, waving Ms pipe. “Fot instance, why did Alder kill Miss Gilmar?” “ Because he wanted her money.” “Well, by threatening her with Dean ! he could have got her to allow him a good income. There was no need for him i to strangle her.” \ . I i“ Perhaps not-, and especially in poor Mrs Presk’s front ’ parlor. . She hasn’t | been able to .let it since. And, to make matters worse, Matilda Crane has gone away with the five pounds yon gave her.” “Mrs Presk had better give up the house at once,” said Parge ; nodding. “No one .will occupy a room in .which a. murder'has taken place.' ’Taint nat’ral to live with ghosts.- What about that Yellow Boudoir at Kirkstone Hall ?” ' “ Oh, Mr ’ and Mrs Ferris are going to pull it down -when they come, back from their honeymoon.
