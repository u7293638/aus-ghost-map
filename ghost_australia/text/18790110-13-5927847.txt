THE AUSTRALIAN ABROAD. B.X A VICTORIAN. II. The Australian passengers bound liUrope change ships at Galle When we on board the s s Nepaul we find cursed in a new atmosphere. We have for hanson a lot of Indian officers going England on sick leave, and a number married ladies from India whose children have reached the age at which they obliged to take them to a cooler climate yond this we have passengers from Batav Japan China and in fact all parts of east so that there is a rare old mixture nationalities in the ships company different times we have heard a great d about the incivility of the Indians to Australians During the voyage from Mel bourne this was the sort of story that we the rounds The first day out from Galle you! are my face d Dick had secure 1 a 11 vice at 1 table by pinning his card to the clo but an Indian officer claimed the se having occupied it all the way do from Calcutta so what does he do but the Dick's card on the floor an 11 at his own its place Dick said he was an Australian gentleman and that he would not make by for the Ameer of Afghanistan so he order old Indigo to replace his car 1 on pain of a sound chastisement Old Ped perpot turn livid but seeing that Dick was not an to be trifled with eventually obeyed He is on a site spluttering and sobbing life apoplectic turkey cold then lay in" nea choked himself with his cure) he went the poop and cursed and ripped aw or no lie becalmed the spanker Upon an impartial review of the subject I think that the Indians have been son what maligned the fault is in the in service system The Indian passengers left Calcutta in a room) ship and at 6 Pile the arc incommoded by having 70 or 80 Aust; Iians thrust upon them. The Australia leave Melbourne in a roomy ship a at Galle they are irritated by have 50 or 60 Indians crowded on top of them imagine the state of affairs is something is what the Yankees call two fouls 1 fact is the Indians ought to travel over by rail from Calcutta to Bombay and have steamer of their own That orrongeme would be satisfactory to both parties As the ill temper of the Indian passengers it true that they are all more or less suffer from liver disease but although that is complaint calculated to pro Ince inhabit! the sufferers in such cases as a ri are too lymphatic to be actively d agreeable I never met a quieter not the our Indian fellow passengers and they are very well with the Australians the or real annoyance occasioned is by some e epicable people of our own number who order to curry favour with the aristocrat den) their country and i retend that they had only been to Australia on a visit an I had no sympathy either with its institutions its people denly the) have their reward 'They carry the well mented contempt of bo parties My cabin mate in the new ship is a your Indian captain i I find them very ideas mt n companionable only he has a habit of cann the black stewards frequently upon what consider insufficient provocation but the his liver is very large-I sometimes fans) can see it bulging out his waistcoat On the morning of the first day at sea from Gall he stood on the poop taking a critic survey of the Australians as they can on the deck for a constitutional before break fast They are a man looking lot they friends of yours said he to me but I suppose they have all got plenty of money suppose so I replied with airy grandeur "or they would not travel A you see the man with a red Crimean shirt pecan" about his paper collar for want of a state to keep it in its place When he gets Paris he will probably live at the rate of 5 C a week My cr bin mate looked at me with an expression of Best cat which I had not observed in him before I inwardly hope is will never discover that I have had to borrow money from a fellow passenger to cover an unexpected extravagances at Ceylon lala feel glad that I have on my best tweed sun which I have only worn one winter and on summer 'The new companionships give a fillip t our state shipboard amusements The plan is permanently) fixed on deck and UP hav grand concerts three nights aw eel People now Bint who would not sing before and w discover that we are strong in musical resources In singing as Jack pithily expressed it, we can knock spots out of the In hands but they have a pianiste whose talent we cannot approach Our music hall is as magnificent as ever prima donna sang; in It is bounded only by the far horizon which a bright moonlight night gives it sea it is canopied by the spacious firmament and it is illuminated by those glorious lam] : of heaven which no modern electric light will ever be able to outshine The Australians also get up an amateur theatrical performance which is full of wonderful surprises chiefly to the actors themselves The only people in the ship who have changed are the Indian punkahs both and stewards the boys used to be full of; life and fun and wink roughly as the Aus- tralians tossed them an occasional sixpence or shilling They have now the hard set look of a subject lace feel the iron heel of their masters They get nothing but the word of command from the Indian passengers and they obey silently We are all friendly but there is not sufficient affinity of cohesion among,, us to get up a dance The Royal Bengal tiger and the Australian kangaroo are on excellent terms but it is felt that it would not be well for them to embrace in the literal sense of the term It is too suggestive of the saying that when the limb lies down with the lion it will be inside the km" of beasts AMnle we in our little world are occupied with these trifles we are trading from the Indian Ocean into the Vi oil in Sea We pass the barren looking island of Sol over the Brothers and one or two others We also see Cape Guardafui the eastern point of Africa and the land of the Som idea which is notorious for its lockets AMicn we are in the middle of the Indian Ocean one of Her Majesty a ships of war splits us The captain beats down in order to get the latest news about the expected war with Russia He mounts the ladder at the steamer a side and is met on the top step by his sister who is one of the Indian passen ters It is an extraordinary accidental in lontic in aid ocean V lady resident in India and a brother with the sea for his profession cannot expect to meet each other more than about once in a lifetime That william i by captain has not been gone more than 20 minutes when we hear all about his love affairs He could led them to his sister who told it all to Mrs. Jones and Mrs. lies in son had it direct from Mrs J The worst of it is there are 10 different stories which To notaries the least The captain of the war ship stayed with us 10 minutes and we hear enough of his sayings to move a three of volume nov 1 Soon after this we are in the mail Co's coaling port of Aden which is situated at that corner of Arabia which is in the Strait of Babel Afaudeb just on a site to Abyssinia and at the entrance of the 1 ed Sea It is like what one in games the 1 plutonic regions to be Surely there is not another country on the face of the earth which is so scorched and chance as this is Broken hills with strange jat0edpenl s confusedly thrown together without a blade of grass or the slightest appearance of any kind of verdure rear their dark brown heads to a height of 1 700ft There are terrific decline tics and dark abjSBes suggestive of a great com union It is a w weird sight-a very night- mare of a landscape-a phantasmagoria of hill scenery, and the place is as hot as any where you life We see a couple of hotels and a few native houses | baking in the sun, and we feet Bore, for the English soldiers beyond who have to spend a, year here Some Arab Jews and Persians came off to the ship with carpets carved boxes, and ostrich feathers, c, for sale. About nine miles inland there are Bom famous tanks hew n out of the solid rock to the storage of water, which must be very necessary in a country which has the appearance of being visited by a shower about once in 10 years These tanks are very ancient They were projected b; Alexander the Great, and some of us was to go and see them. " What is the use, said Jack (who like most Australian natives has not a, particle of veneration for the antique), " of our visiting these tanks, which areas old as the hills, when we have seen the great basin of Malmsbury, and the famous Gong Gong of Ballarat, both of which are new ' His argument is unanswerable, but as we have nothing else to do, we go We ride through a desolate cinder her country, threading narrow mountain gorge: with forts on the spurs commanding the passes, and we travel by hills scarred am honeycombed and riven into all sorts of fantastical shapes , but no shrub or tree or: any green thing do we see We meet donkeys laden with leathern water bags filled at the tanks, and camels carrying dry grass and firewood from the more productive in tenor His camel comes along with a strangely silent ghost like mode of progression It is an excellent opportunity for our first ride on camel back But we soon tire of that Imagine yourself on the top of a pianoforte steel, screwed up to the highest point at which it will remain without falling off the support, the seat making periodical wrenching plunges of 5ft or 6ft, and an ever present feeling that your viscera is performing the evolution known in the modern ball room as " cheese and cross over,' and you will have some idea of the pleasures of a rule on a camel After crossing some three miles of an and and dusty country we come upon a native town The houses are white, flat roofed, and thoroughly eastern looking Then we reach the tanks, situated at the base of a mountain range, and within the walls of a vast crater. There are here a few green trees, kept alive by constant watering There were originally, or at the time of the second Persian invasion of Yemen, A D COO, about 50 cemented tanks, the aggregate capacity of which was nearly 30,00 000gal In the restoration 13 have been completed, with a capacity of 8,000 000gal The receptacles are of irregular shape, advan" stage having been taken of every feature of the rocks They are easily filled, as the hard (dry soil of the hills does not absorb the rain when it does come. Most of the cisterns were empty. On the way back to the ship we called at a French hotel and had omelette of ostrich eggs and hump of dromedary fncasseed- the latter barely eatable The day following we are in the Red Sea It is the hot season, though not at its worst However, the heat is stifling Every cabin window base wind sail to catch any vagrant breath of air that may pass its way, but existence in the cabins is out of the question, so nearly all sleep on deck One of the invalids has breakfast at 9 one morning, dies at 11, and is buried at 2 in the afternoon, the circumstance being kept as secret as possible so as not to discourage the other sick people. It is a cruel thing to send an invalid home by this route in the hot season the bottom of the Red Sea is said tube pins,] with the bones of Indians and Australians. Yee pass some desolate islands, and we see the barren sunbaked shore of Arabia on one side and that of Abyssinia and Nubia on the other Ye sight three of the ships with Indian troops on board bound for Malta, towed by powerful steamers, but making slow progress Nearing the Gulf of Suez, edible locusts, which have been blown into the sea, become very plentiful Yee should not care for them, however, even with the accompaniment of wild honey Mount Sinai is distant about 25 miles from the shore line Some people derive consolation from the fact that its locality is apparently indicated in the evening by one bright star After sunset these Arabian hills, so hideous by day, are bathed in a pale blue mist, and that is all the romance we can get out of them Our next experience is of old hushed Egypt and its sands "
