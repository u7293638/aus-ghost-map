The Au-ccoa arrived from Melbourne on Sunday morning, and called at Glenelg to land passengeis, and ticked up Mr. Searcy, the Customs boarding officer, who had been there to enter and clear the mail steamer. Captain McLean reports light westerly winds throughout the passage. The Julia, American barque, hiving a discharging terth aebcted, waa towed into harbour on Sunday altemoon's tide. XheLcBKA, s-s., was steamed to the North Arm on Saturday for swinging and adjustment of compasses. Since she was liit in commission she has been thoroughly Orel hauled, and will take the berth to Port Lincoln and Wallaroo in place of the Kaagtroo, which is to be provided with new cylinders and sub mitted to a general overhaul. The A&tracax;, frcm London, had a good tide on Saturday afternoon, and the tug being in attendance she was at once towed into harbour.

It U cot often thet the patient watchers whom duty it is to look oat for the mall steamer at Glenelg are caught tripplnj, but on Sunday morning they were found Iwfcgged if they were not discovered napping, fortheR.M.3. VenetU glided like a ghost out cf the haza between 3 and 4 o'clock on Sunday morning, and did it so quietly that she ni not noticed till hand/ at her berth. Consequently, she was not received with the nsnal honours, but was at anchor before the Mermaid woke to action. It was nobody's fault at Holdfast Bay, and probably not any one's error at Cape Borda She was not signalled from the Cape, although she passed about - quarter to 7 on Saturday night. As to the state ot the atmosphere opinions differ, nautical talent being notoriously variable — some said it was haiy 'as anything,' others that it was cleat as crystal, and that blue lights were burnt by the VenetU as she pimd the lighthouse. Then was a tine moon, but at Glcnelg there was a hue, or the s^anuhip would have been seen sooner. Mr. Harbour-Master D»gw«ll— who, by the way, hu bad his man re tranched fey Government exraomy, and now has to do double duty, working all day and watch itg all night— nw the steamer and roused all hands for boarding between 3 and 4 am. Tse M-nraid was soon waking the silence of the mora ing with her steam whistle, and when she approached the VenetU it looked as if all hands butths watch had turned in for the Sunday snooze, so quiet did everything seem. By the handy way ia which the steamship had been piloted into her berth near the craft doing duty for the expatriated hoik, it was evi dent that some one not new to Glenelg was on board, and it turned out that more than oae familiar form was there, some of tha ameers and the engineer having beta here in other P. & O. beats. There wen ever fifty mail bags, and these were soon put on board the Fairy and sent uy to town by a special engine Ifr. Allen, the Manager of the Railway Com pany, Lad a carriage waiting for passengers, but none showed np at that unseasonable hocr. The VenetU is a straight-stemmed barque-rigged vessel, not unlike the Cathay and Hvdaipes. She towered very Ugh out of |the water, isettsint; light In draught, aad aeen ttun oa appeared very lofty ia tha hull, and narrow for her length. Her tqnniga Is 2.725, and she was built about the year 1S73 by Denny Brothers, of Dumbarton. Her length U 351 feet, her beam SS fret, aod » be is 5tO horsepower. She has j oat had a com plete overhaul, aod has had new boileri pot in. bhe has been running In the India, China, and Venice Uses until recently, when she was sent hoaie for overhaul, aod put on the Australian trade. Her internal Stttsjs *re ?T'hrt-rti-I. p'*in, »n-1 suiuM-?, *e!n~ ia m respect Inferior to or much different boat the Hyda-p». flrr avenge nte of speed in the ran has been stxrat Hi knots, and the weather experienced has bean nee on the whole. The officers say the voyage has bees as uneventful as a month in gaol and as mild as a temperance lecture. The VenetU left Calcutta on June 14, and reached Point de Gills on tbe 23rd, sailing same day. When she got into the titrfes there was little of them to make available, aad it was not till the vessel was in lat. 27' 3. that she fell in with anything like a smart breeza. She got to King George's Scund on July 6, and left there aams day. The voyage to Glenelg was a pleasant one for the puteogen, the weather beicg &ae; with a be»m sea, bnt not rough. The VenetU signalized her arrival by losing her anchor for a tiaie, but it wu fortunately recovered. It appears that when she came up to her berth the order was given to let go the anchor, bnt the chain cable snapped as the anchor, which weighs two tons, plunged. Ansther anchor was let go at once, and the ship was delayed an hour recovering the truant one. Thi chief otSser and the Harbour-Master. Mr. DagwelL had two boats out, and after some tremble got a strong chain ova the flake, lilted the anchor, and got it to the bows, from whence It was soon hove np and stowed. The VenetU left for Melbourne at 11 a.m on Sunday. BRITISH AND FOREIGN SHIPPING. Akbitjllb fsom South Al-6tsl.ki.Ul. At Graresend-Jupiter, June 2 ; Letterawe. Jane 3 ; Loclinvar, June 2.
