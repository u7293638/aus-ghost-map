One means a Dirine attribnte, or essence born of, and of God; the otber having an existence for ever. The necessary qualification for immortality is purity. There are two modes of purification, tbe Holy Ghost and by fire, and purified souls put on immortality, and iboce *ouls that are not purified are cut off. These die the Becond death, and to such we may apply the words infernal souls, as second death meens death of the soul, such a death meaning extinction of hope, of light, existence in despair and torments. A soul dead in trespasses and sin is not immortal, inasmuch' ss It is not God-like. Hence the necessity of. salvation, which restores and quickens into life the dead past state of souls, and gives birth to new life,,which state is bom of Christ Jems.
