A WELSH GHOST STOEl'. A elratiqe ghost story (says the " Birmingham Gazette") comes from the Principality. There is a friendly society at Pontiirdawe, in the Swansea valley, among whose rules is one that tbe funeral allowance on account of a deceased member shall not be paid in cases of suicide. One of the members recently died by his own hand, and the club accordingly refused to pay the death money. For this reasonable and just refusal the members are now complaining that they are subjected to serious persecution from an unseen and presumably a ghostly agent. The manifestations began on a recent Sun day, when one of the officers, returning home over a lonely road, was assailed, as he asserts, b_" the spirit of the late member, who, tailing to obtain a satis factory reply to his demand lor the money, in a somewhat unspiritlike manner assailed the unfortunate man, and actually " tore his clothes to ribbons." Such, at least was the account be gave, in toneB of horror, j at tbe first public-house he came to after thtB terrible encounter. But the j ghost does not appear to have teen satisfied with this demonstration. On the following Tuesday evening, whilst the members were assembled in the lodgeroom, tbe usual knocks were heard at the door as of a brother seeking admittance. The door was opened, bot no one was to bo seen. ^|ie members, however, are all very certain that they heard the voice of the deceased utter the words: Pay my widow my funeral money, and then' I shall be at rest." The meeting pre cipitately broke up, and the members are now puzzled to know what to do with such a determined deceased brother.
