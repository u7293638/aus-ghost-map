) "Macbeth." ' ' . ( This tragedy was written by " the / immortal William Shakespeare, in \ the' year 1606. The late Thomas; ( Campbell, in his '" Remarks on the '/ Life and - Writings of -Villiam- \ Shakespeare," writes,.. " Enlightened .(. criticism and: universal opinion have / so completely set the seal of celebrity " V on this tragedy, tliat it will stand ( whilst our -language exists ,as a ). monument of English genius. Nay, \ it will outlast the present form of: our' ( language, and sjjeak to generations / unborn in parts of the earth that are y yet uninhabited. No drama, in any f National Theatre, taking even that of J Greece into account, has more wonder- \ fully amalgamated the natural and ( the supernatural — or made the sub- . ) stances of truth more awful by their \ superstitious shadows— than has the r tragedy, of ' Macbeth.-' The progress ) of " Macbeth ' in crime is an un- ,. ( paralleled lecture in ethical 'anatomy. ( The' heart of a man, naturally prone ) to goodness, is exposed so as to teach us ( clearly through what avenues of that r heart the black drop,- of guilt' found j its way to expel the more/ innocent , k blood. A aemhlahce of superstitious ' necessity is no doubt preserved in" S the actions of Macbeth'-, and a 'super- . fioial reader, might : say . that the v Witches not only tempted but necessi- ; ). tated Macbeth to murder Duncan. :'. ' But ' this is not the case, for ' Shakespeare has contrived to give at ) once the awful appearance of. preter- i natural; impulse on Macbeth's ' mind, ' and yet visibly : to leave him a free ) agent and a voluntary sinner". If we, could imagine Macbeth conjuring the ! I hags'- to re-appear on the eve of his.: ) inevitable . death, and accusihg' them of having caused' him to f murder ) Duncan, the might very well ) say, 'We did not oblige'you to ahyr such /'act, we only foretold what' > would have happened . even if . you had hot murdered .Duncan, namely, that you should be Scotland's. .King. > But you /'were' impatient.' ' You ' did. not consider ithat 'if .the prediction , was true it was; nonbusiness of yours )-to> bestir yourself in the business ; . but you had a wife, a fair wife, who 'goaded you .on to the murder.' If > the Witches .had .spoken thus, there . . would be matter in the tragedy ' itself to bear - them.: out ; for Macbeth ) absolutely says to himself, f If it be: thus decreed, it must be, and- there is ' no necessity for, me .to: stir, in the ) affair,'" f ' This tragedy had its first p erf or- ) mance in Melbourne, at the Queen- : street' Theatre, on July 10th, 1845. ' The play .was rendered by the ) Melbourne Company, as distinguished from Mr. Coppin's . "Launceston ) Company."

Mr. Ci W. Barry made ' \ the character of Macbeth the occasion ' of his first appearance on the Mel- ) bourne stage, on July 2, 1860, with \ Mr. Henry Edwards as Macbeth, and ' Mrs. Charles Poole as Lady Macbeth. ' Miss Goddard (Mrs. Caple), made ) her first entree on the Melbourne . stage, on Aug. 24, 1857, as Lady Macbeth ' to the Macbeth of the late ) lamented G. V. Brooke. . " An Australian Roscius," of some ) fourteen years of age, named Master . v Edward Pole, made his "first appear- ' ance on any stage as Macbeth at the ) Theatre Royal, Melbourne, Aug. 25, . 1858, to the Lady Macbeth of the. late ' Miss Ellen Mortyn. A revival of "Macbeth" took place at the Haymarket Theatre, Melbourne, Aug. 22, 1863. The notification on the bills of the period gave the reason of its re-productioh. "The greatest novelty yet produced, , thirteen . ghosts will appear in Shakespeare's sublime tragedy ' of 'Macbeth,', by the aid of Professor Pepper's wonderful effects and il lusions." Messrs. . Henry Edwards \- and Richard Younge played alterna- ' tely Macbeth and Macduff. Miss Annie.-Lockhart was, Lady , Macbeth . Mr. J.J. Bartlett was Malcolm, and Mr Richard Stewart was the Hecate. "One man in his time plays many parts " is a Shakesperian axiom. But it is very seldom the lot of an actor to -play ' second business to many -stars. Writing of "Macbeth," my mind reverts to Mr. H. R. Harwood, who has played , Macduff to the « Macbeth of Messrs. Walter Mont gomery, James Anderson, Daniel E. i Bandm'ann, - Charles Pope, Alfred Dampier,' and almost every star 1 that lias appeared on the Melbourne i stage. One of the greatest bits of real tragic acting was the "sleep walking < scene " which was given at a day . performance at the Opera House, Oct. 2, 1875. Lady Macbeth was I ; then sustained by ! the great Ristori. , Mr. H. R. Harwood was the Physician on the occasion. ( ' " Signor Verdi, . the great opera composer, took "Macbeth'" for his ( 'theme, and. after careful considera- j tion, 'produced the operaof "Maobeth" in Florence, Italy, , in 1847. It was Y subsequently played in London. , J The first production of the operatic J version of this tragedy in Melbourne, ( took place" at ' the Theatre Royal, / Sept.- 8, I860, when that house was ) leased for a short period to' Signor ( Bia.nchii .iThe Artists, then 'engaged / in the presentation were , . , j Maobeth . . ....
