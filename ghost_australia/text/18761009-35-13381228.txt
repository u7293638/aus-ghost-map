PICNIC TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND SYNOD. A VERY successful picnic and harbour excursion was given on Saturday, by the laity of the Church of England in Sydney, to the clergy and lay representative of the General Synod of the Church of England in Australia and Tasmania, now in session. Two steamers were engaged for the occasion-the Collaroy and the Bredalbane-the former of which took the major part of the guests, starting from the Circular Quay at about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock. There were between three and four hundred per- sons on board including most of the bishops and clerical and lay representatives of the Synod, many of the clergy from the metropolis and the suburbs and a large number of leading churchmen and ladies. The prelates present were the Bishops of Brisbane, Goulburn, Tasmania, Bathurst, and Ballarat. The other members of the Episcopal bench at the synod were unable to attend. The Collaroy, under the skilful guidance of Captain Harris took the party first up the harbour as far as Lane Cove, making a circuit round Cockatoo Island, thence down the harbour, and some distance up the North Harbour towards Manly Beach. She next proceeded up Middle Harbour for several miles past the spit, and then returning put in at Pearl Bay, where the party went on shore. The weather in the morn- ing, was delightfully fine so that the visitors had an oppor- tunity such as is seldom afforded of seeing the varied beauties of harbour scenery of which Sydney is so justly proud. On landing at Pearl Bay the guests dispersed in various directions about the grounds, enjoying the fresh breeze and the lovely views which are to be obtained from this picturesque locality. At about half oust 2 o'clock tho bugle sounded the nc<,,m iy_n sij-nal which was nchtlv ui derstood to mdi (iio that lunchern »i» reidy aid tbo ¡ arti vhih w is n JW reinforced by those n ho had not been able to lea e town hi tho ir t seninrr, lind lad c mo djnn in the BredilUino nd,o mci to tho ti Inn, n hero a rerast hid b en «prend ma stylo that did in mito credit even to the almo t illimitable resources of C mipspuoni « wrll known establishment, nnd which rr- ieiiol Iron tho gue ta thit justico nInch it deserved Mr 1 C Dangar occupied the chair After tho good cheer h id been Hell disposed of lhe CitAtUMAs, j roposed " Her Mnjealy the Queen, ' a tonst that was honoured with all tho enthusiasm of loyal subjoets and good churchmen.
