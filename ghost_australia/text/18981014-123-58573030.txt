NORTHCOTE ACCEPTS THE COLLING WOOD LINE. In the Northcote town council on Monday evening, Cr. Pearl moved the endorsement of the recommendation of the Preston municipal conference in favor of the Young-street line of rail way through Fitzroy. Cr. -Dinnis moved that the council disagree with the recommendation of the conference. There was a good chance of getting the Collingwood line, but the Fitzroy route. had not the ghost of a show. The Collingwood line would practically serve the people of Northcote, though a little longer than the other. Cr. Candy seconded, as it was hope less to oppose the Collingwood line further. Cr. M'Lean thought it hopeless to persevere in agitating for the Fitzroy route. Later they might secure Col lingwood support for a direct line through Fitzroy. Cr. Hooper was confident the Col lingwood line would go through this time. It would be suicidal to ask the Government to construct the Fitzroy line as it would never pay. He was opposed to a dog-in-the-manger policy. Other councillors held that the Col lingwood line should be accepted, since the Fitzroy route could not be secured. The mayor firmly believed that the Fitzroy line was the better, but did not believe a particle of good would be done by keeping up the agitation in its favor. Cr. Pearl replied forcibly, upholding the merits of the Fitzroy route, main taining that the Collingwood line would be a ghastly failure, and characterising the councillors who approved It as "craven cowards." The amendment rejecting the con ference's resolution in favor of the Fitzroy line was carried with only four. dissentients-Crs. Pearl, Harry, Mitchell and Bailey.
