'-Saclrhgal.tells'that'Oiicfewlien travellmg in Central Africa he was obliged to attach himself to an Arab slave gang, and that tlie drivers deliberately cut the throats, of those who -couia not -march; and Cardinal Iiavigerie informs -us. that ..his missionaries "jbave seen these monsters boiling willixage— .draw their.sworas, with -which they can cut off a head at a single blow, ana lop .off first an ahn and tlicn a foot of their victims, and seizing these limbs, throw them on the veige of some neighbouring forest, calling out to the terrified troop, ' there goes to attract the •leopard which Will come and teach you to mareil.'" Captain Elton, in his " Eastern and Central Africa," says:: " When hurrying through an •inhospitable and-- impoverished district, the •leaders of the slave caravan could, not stop to ..disengage -the iamting from -the cham-gang, hut lopping the head above the ring confining the neck, allowed it to roll out of the path, while the disengasea body was kickea On One side with a curse :oH its feebleness ; or, if rfobd failed,. babes were snatched &om; their wretchea mothers* arms alia flnng into the ad]a«ent jungle lest they should deprive the still liealt'hy slave of the strength to proceed." • In Livingstone's journals-we constantly come upon such:sentries as these: "Wherever wo took a walk, human .skeletons were to be seen inieverydirection." "Passed a slave woman, shot -or stabbed through the- body." " Bound a number of slaves with flave-sticks, abandoned by their master for want of iood." " It was wearisome to see the skulls and bones scattered about everywhere." "The number of skulls," says General Gordon, " along the road is appalling. I have ordered the skulls which lay about here in great numbers, to be piled m a heap as a •memento to the natives of what the slavedealers liavo done to their people." "The great roads of the Sahara." Cardinal Iiavigerie told his hearers, " are to be traced by the bones of slaves who have dropped out of -the ranks, or been, brutally slaughtered as. feeble and useless by the slave-drivers on their long marches down to the coast." It is moreover affirmed as a simple fact, that if a traveller were to lose his way by any of the • three great routes from the east or north of Africa -into the interior, he might find it by tracing the bones and skeletons of these miserable creatureE. But here these painful details must end. I wish I could say that none more painful could be furnished, iiven in connection with such atrocities and .sufferings as have been sketched more harrowing particulars are before me, and -there -are -besides .aspects of this infamous traffic which L. am: .debarred from unveiling by the recollection that this magazine is a publication, not one line of which may not be read in the family. It is eertain, however, that 310 imagination tan exaggerate tlie horrors which must-for the presentbe passed over without a word.
