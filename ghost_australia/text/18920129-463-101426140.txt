A GHOST THAT DID NOT 'FIZZ.* The London (Spectator publishes a letter from ' A Galloway Man,' who tells the following story : â€” A little knot of townsmen were wont to prolong their drinking-bouts, and when there was no law closing publtchouses at 11 p.m. in Scotland, these sedmwU extended not seldom far on into the morning hours. To try to check the doings of the topers on one occasion at the hour when the couple of candles had nearly expended {there was no gas in our town in these days) a spectreofhuman build, but robed in white and carrying a lantern under the enveloping sheet so as to produce a diffused red light, stalked solemnly into the gloomy room, and stopped in what was hoped would be a terror-stricken silence. As gravely as if he rose to meet some mourner, one of the tipsy crew stood up on his feet. Forming a bubble of saliva on his lip, he poised it on the tip of his middle finger, project ing it towards the supposed emissary of terror in a way that most boys under stand and occasionally practice when in vulgHrest mood. The swaying drunkard shot the moisture hard at the glimmer ing sheet and figure, with the one remark Scottice, *' Ye're a gude while oot or ye'd have fizzed.' . There is no use adding that the little plot was a failure. Waterproof coats which have become ?tiff may easily be softened by moving them before the fire for a few minute*. Agantle heat h etpugh, and the coat ?huuid be kept moving.
