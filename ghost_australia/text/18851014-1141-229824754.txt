BiCE 'EH. "Rice 'em, sir, into form," was the pithy remark of one of the shrewdest little turfites in the colonies during a chat last week on recent racing and uup probabilities. "Jinn em regular, ana keep running 'em ; they work them selves into form, and get accustomed to racing." These remarks were apropos of one or two wins of late, and the philosophy wrapped up- -in the idea struck me as worth reproducing. I have more than once called atten tion to the feet that it is good business to follow a winning animal,, whether he be hurdleracer, steeplechaser,1 or Cup candidate, and the theory that nothing gets a horse into such thorough sound condition as racing him with tae colours up has of late been very clearly exemplified. Most turfites must have frequently noticed that once a horse commences to ran well to the front in a race he generally improves on his position the more frequently (within., reason) he is raced; and that once a good 'un. commences to win he keens on winning, even -though his weight be slightly increased each time, until a certain limit is reached, or the nag " goes off." . According to the theory Of my training friend, a horse who is persistently raced in public soon runs himself into form if he be any good at all, and gets fitter in a mnch less space of time than' if prepared on the training ground. The probable explanation of this is to be found in the fact that a horse, who is given his lessons in tbe actual races, gets to know whai is I'Spcclod of him sooner than if prepared solely on the training ground. There is, 1 consider, a good deal in this, aud tho turfite to whom 1 am referring practises what he preaches. The idea, however, is a somewhat ex pensive one, entry, fees, forfeits, &c.;, swallowing up nearly all the stakes when a win -does come, but in the long run there isnothinglikc racing tbem into form, and then, once fit, keeping them in that con dition, and racing them in any event in which they have a ghost of a show.
