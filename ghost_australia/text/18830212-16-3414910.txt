MAGNETIC DREAMS. (St. James's Budget.) EDUCATED men have generally found some difficulty in believing that it is possible to give serious attention to the question whether there are such things as apparitions and such powers as those of second sight. The Society for Psychical Research are making strenuous efforts to overcome this incredulous spirit ; but they are by no means the first " researchers " who have professed to deal with the subject by scientific methods. Many eccentric philosophers have been disposed to think that there is something to be said for the popular faith in ghosts ¡ and among these philosophers perhaps the foremost place is due to Schopen- hauer, who took such high rank among the original thinkers of his age that he earned the right to be heard about any matter regarding which he chose to express decided opinions. As a rule he was by no means easily duped ; but when he approached the subject of " visions " he seemed almost to lose the faculty of testing evidence. Hardly any story relating to the border-land between the natural and the supernatural, whether recorded by ancient or by modern writers, was condemned by him as extravagant ; and in one of his essays he rebuked Englishmen (whom in other respects he considered to be far ahead of Germans and Frenchmen) for their scepticism as to the mysterious affinities and capacities of the human mind. Curiously enough, he attributed our backwardness in this department of philosophical inquiry to the malign influence of the clergy of the National Church, who, he thought, denounced animal magnetism and all other " isms" of a similar tendency because they perceived the perils to which these sciences would expose their superstitious religious beliefs. One of the fundamental doctrines of Schopenhauer's philosophy is that the world as we know it has not an independent existence. Like Berkeley, he held that it is merely an " appearance." The only real existence, he maintained, is " the thing in itself ; " and " the thing in itself," he identified with the will. In ordinary circumstances we know the will only as it manifests itself under the forms of space, time, and casualty ; but he contended that there are states of the brain in which we penetrate behind these forms, and come into contact with the will sit is in its own nature. At such times we escape from the system of intellectual illusions which it is the business of science to investigate ; we are in the realm of absolute truth, which constitutes the proper domain of philosophy. Even members of the Society for Psychical Research are not likely to take up higher ground than this and they will certainly not surpass Schopenhauer in the confidence with which he drew conclusions from his ultimate principles. The states of the brain which lead to such surprising results occur when we are in " a magnetic sleep," and a magnetic sloop may be produced when we are asleep in the ordinary way. It does not follow that if we fall into a magnetic sleep we shall have magnetic dreams and if we do dream magnetically, it does not follow that we shall remember what we have dreamt. A magnetic sleep is far deeper than ordinary sleep, and in the slow process of awaking from it we may forget the spectacle which it has enabled us to see. Sometimes, however, the impression which the vision has produced on our feeling remains and on these occasions, if the vision has been one of coming disaster (as it commonly is in the worst of possible worlds, according to Schopen- hauer), we have what is called a presenti- ment of evil, and our presentiment is sure to be realised sooner or later. At other times our magnetic dream-that is, our perception of realities may be transformed into a sort of allegory which is capable of different interpretations. Of this kind were the predictions of the Delphic oracle, which frequently could not be understood until they were fulfilled. Schopenhauer was not of opinion, however, that our mysterious visions in their original form invariably pass from the memory ; and he gives an example of one which he himself had an opportunity of ' studying. This instance seemed to him all the more remarkable because it related to a matter of little importance. One day he was writing a letter in great haste, and when he had finished the third page he intended to strew writing sand over what he had written. In his hurry he seized the inkstand instead of the vessel containing sand, and dashed the contents over his letter. As the ink poured from his desk he rang for the maid to wipe it from the floor When she was engaged in doing so, she said Last night I di emit that I should be wiping ink spots from the floor here "That is not tiue,"anssveied Schopenhauer "It is true," she replied, " and when I awoke I mentioned it to the other maid who sleeps with me " Just then the other maid hin pened to enter the room in order to cut away her fellow sers mt Schopenhauer advancing to meet her, at once asked' " What did this girl dream last night a I don't know ' " Yes, you do , she told you where she awoke" "Oh, to be sure the main then said, she dreamt that iliessould be wiping ink spots from the floor here Schopenhauer gravely points out that this anecdote is not only sufficient as Science for magnetic dreaming, but that it establishes the truth of the doctrine that everything happens in accordance with a fixed and necessary order He contended that those states of the brain Milich are essential for supermini ii visions may exist when we are not asleep in the 01 dinny sense Among the strange experiences which we may undergo when we seem to be wide awake Schopenhauer;! classes the visions which men are some time said to have of themselves is they will happen at some future time in this section of this he refers to the well known incident described by Goethe mtlietleseiith book of "Wilnheit und Dichtun Goethe had said farewell to Friederike md ss is riding in a sorrowful mood toss ads Diuseii here, when suddenl>,he says, he saw him self not with the eyes of the body, but with those of the mind -riding in the opposite direction on the same soul in a dress such is he had never seen' "pike gin), with a little gold "When I housed myself from this die an, Goethe adds, "the figure immediately s unshed ' Eight years afterwards, he asserts he found himself on horseback on this su> road on the way to visit Fnedeiikc again see it in the dress he had seen in his vision, author if he had put it on accidentally Schopui hotel, who was not averse from theological explanations after a fashion of his own figures that this Asking die in must have been granted to Goethe for the purpose of consoling him The fin demise of silken" dresses may be however, Schopenhauer" holds, to prepare us for defeat and so low, is in the case of the famous vision of Buitiis before the battle of Philippi The ultimate so ill behind phenomenon ly even streets stain men who, through some defect of constitution, are unable to apprehend its ninth tions At such times, ilthoiighseeuigiiotlim ', they in by head mysterious sounds, especially sounds of knocking and Schopenhauer s ms estigitions convinced him that these sounds are most frequently heard in the interval between night and morning Another set of facts to which he ran buted great importance are those connected with the influence which may be excited by persons in a waking dream over other persons, whether near or at a distinct this influence, he tells us, is often treated by persons who are dying A dying man who happens to be in a magnetic state thinks of some friend, and distinctly a vision of him, is distinct as surrounding objects, uses in his friends con decisive Schopenhauer cites man) with 61 ita-, for this belief, but also mentions a case known to himself "A short time ago, he was, at the Jewish Hospital, here in It effort, a sick woman died during, the night Early next morning her sister and her niece, one of ss from his es and Fi motor t the other about four English miles away, called at the hospital to inquire for her , during the night she had appealed to both of them.
