I Ulbteb its Arms.— The NcwYork.World's I London correspondent of ;May 81 says :— I ««, I have . discoyered thati the, organisation I of the army of Ulster has progressed to an I extraordinary degree, and I have, gathered I startling particulars which are in secret I circulation among the Orangemen .of ;this I city. The leading fact is that the organisa I tion of a Loyalist and Protestant body of I men pledged to resist any attempt to carry ? out Home Rule in Ireland by the Parnellite ? body has developed enormously without I anybody having the slightest suspicion of I its growth. The army is already practically I enrolled, and all the military details have I been arranged with the greatest precision. I A number of distinguished noblemen and I members of Parliament are enrolled among I theofficersiof; ' The Army/, andi arms Have I already been provided and arrangements I' made.' for securing cannon and, horses.' I This story is given for what it is worth.. I On May; 29 the police, seized at :Belfast a I quantity, of rifles, bayonets, and swords on ? board a steamer from Fleetwood, a seaport I of Lancashire,: and. consigned to. parties in I Armagh. The strength : of the Ulster I force 13- stated as, follows.: — Active army; I 38,470 ; reserve army, .29,900 ; not classed ? 7160; total, 74,630.
