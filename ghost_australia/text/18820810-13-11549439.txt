THE BOOK OF JOB. Yesterday afternoon the Bishop of M bsuroe delivered the fourth lecture of I -tries relating to the Book of Job, in . Paul's Pro-Cathedral, beforo a very largo u «rogation. The BISHOP said -The doctrine of a foti life in the Cbokmab literature waa m gene very vague and uncertain. After death m Tras SBid to depart into Sheol, and the Shi of this period bad closer affinities with t Greek than with the Christian conception the state after death. Sheol means " t T_8t hollow subterranean rt-Uag place whi ÍB the common receptacle of the deai Existence in this dark under world ia cc ceived of as drear and shadowy, Its life low and ineffectual. " In death," saya t Psalmist, " there ia no remembrance of the in Sheol who shall give thee thanks ' ' " W thou Bhow wonders unto tho dead'' cr another. " Shall the shades below arise a give thee thanks ! ' And even so lato as t period of the Ecclegiastes, the preacher cn " Whatsoever tby hand ûndeth to do, de ?with tby might, for there is no work, nor t vice, nor knowledge, nor wisdom m Sb< whither thon goestj' The representations the early part of the Book of Job agree ontir« with theBB views. Sheol, with the author, i land of darkness, of a deep darkness whi engulfs and encircles the shadowy specti of the dead, as the murky mantle of miduig enwraps and overahadows the earth In tt dreary abode he believes that hia life will as good as extinguished There ia hope, soya, in the 14th chapter, that if a tree be c down, ita stump will put forth new shoe and brancheB , but aa for mon, he dieth ai buddeth no more " He giveth up the gho: and where is he ' ' He IB like the hot bed a winter torrent in summer, when i ?waters are dried up-their muaic silence and their freahneBS exhausted. "So m: lieth down and riseth not again, till ti heavens be no more '-even for ever ni ever How strange a coutrast this seems the bright and hopeful fancies of such Greek poets as Homer, Hesiod, and Pindar , to the Elysian plain of the Odyssey, " where presided in judgement the golden-haired Rhadamanthus, where life is ever free from care and toil and again to those " Isles of the Blessed." where, according to Pindar, " the sun is ever shining, where tho souls of tho just spend tearless eternity, where flowers of gold at fruits immortal grow. ' We are sensible, it is true, of an almost total lack of moral and spiritual earnestness in such passages as these, but at least they are joyous and hope- lui, and even confident How ia it, then, th in spite of bright gleams and flashes here ui there, early Hebrow thought about a futu life is so darkened by dread and uncertainty? The ready answer is, because Moses altogether ignored the subject. The law said nothing and what then, without guidance of revel tion, could be affirmed by poet, or Beer, sage? This answer, however, provokea i evitably a fresh question. Why was Moses silent about the doctrine of a future life? Apart altogether from the question of special inspiration, this silence of the great prophet is one of the most astonishing facts in the whole course of man's spiritual history. Its full import was not even seen by Bishop Warburton, and could indeed be seen by no one before the publication of modern discoveries in Egyptology. Moses, we ai told, was the adopted son of Pharaoh daughter, and learned in all tho wisdom c the Egyptians , what then had he learnt froi them about a future life ' The Egyptians (i M. Benoni has remarked) " were among: the most religious of tho ancient nation! Religion m some form or other was dominar in every relation of their lives " The portio of their literature which haB been preserve to us IB almoBt entirely religious, BO that " we wish to keep clear of religion in Btudyin Egyptian literature, we shall havo to confin ourselveB to mathematics " Again, of all th doctrines of their creed, that relating to future life occupied the placo of greatest pre xnmence. It was said of old time tho it was easier to find a God m Athen than a man. It might havo been said with OB much truth, that it was easier t find a tomb in Egypt than a houao No occu p&tion; m life was so important to an Egyptiai -whether prince or peasant-as the proviaioi for himself of a last reBting place Upon hi Bepnlchre the rich man lavished all the re sources of art and architecture. Hia privat residence he called a hostelry, a place ii which he sojourned as be journeyed, but hu tomb he called his "eternal dwelling place' There the embalmed body would ho fo thousands of years, waiting for the time whei he should como back to claim it after havan Been the gods The soul, tbey believed, con Bia led of u subtler kind of matter it could ea and drink,and when the longseriesof conflict and transformations waB over, which led on t the final judgment, the blessed, whoso hoar turned the Beale against the image of pur truth, went to paradise "This bliaafu place is BUrrounded by a wall of steel " Ther the jnet soul lives aa he lived on earth, feediu; on the flesh of fowls and cattle, inhaling thi Bweet odoura of flowers, resting in the Bbadi of the ejeamore trees, or ploughing, eowmg and reaping the fields of Hotep, as ho ouc< mltivated the water meadows of the Nile Through all thia existence he keep3 up c kind of mjstenous connexion with his en- tombed body, visiting it from time to time, and using it for the purpose of intensifying his life You may eaBily perceive how Buch beliefs as theae would re act upon Egyptian hie and customB. Thoae we call " dead, the departed, wore cal'ed by the Egyptians the living, and their ' houses of eternity ' were among the grandest and vastest of the monu- ments of Epynt The pyramids are only royal tombs And to dav, when every palace ol bing and noble has disappeared, Egypt le filled with the dwelling places of the dead. Care, indeed, for the dead, buildings for the dead, prayera and aacnhces to the dead, met an Egyptian at every turn of his life These things were thrust upon his notice He could not bave escaped them if he would Moses,Jthen, knew all thia-knew all that is contained in the celebrated book of the de id -knew even the esoteric doctrine by which all ita strange weird riteB, conflicts and pil- grimages were philosophically explained. And yet of a future life he says never a word, not because he could not, obviously, but because he would not Now, how ia this ' It IB not enough to answer, God showed htm nothing and therefore ho Bald nothing For however true that may be, we naturally ask the question-why he waB bidden to ignore all this knowledge of hia, and to bury it in absolute oblivion ' Correction of the doctrine we could understand, but why is it ignored' Ia it because the doctrine in itself is worthless for moral and spiritual uses' because we need no anodyne for Borrow but thai nobility of soul which the sorrow produce» » because thiB life ia a completo and rounded whole, containing within itself all solutions of diffi- culty and retnbutiona for wrong' In calm and peaceful days men may possibly think BO, but how can they when life is one long g if fering or injustico ' Consider each cases as that of tho Scotch Covenanters, driven from moor to moor by a cruel and licentiouB soldiery, murdered on their own hearthetono, tortured by fiends in the shape of men till their involuntnry cries sickened even their executioners Consider the case of the poor Jews in Russia, who, because they are of another faith and prosper beyond their neighbours, are driven forth naked into the cold and rain by savages misnamed Chris- tians-the men murdered, tho women out- raged, and the whole race subjected to atroci- ties of cruelty utterly unspeakable. Consider the case of the poor Catholic pneats of Puns, in the hideouB saturnalia of the Commune, hunted from their homes, insulted, and finally murdered m prison by the hundred, becanse tbey belonged to a Christian Church, and would not join in the foul atheiBtic orgies of their tyrants Yea, consider a worse case than all theae-that of the Trench peasantry beforo the Revolution, when a whole people, through several generations wero gradually ground down in the merciless mill of oppression till they lost all the joyB, and almost all the attributes of human life Till one could write of them, " Certain savage looking bemgB male and female, are seen in the country, black, livid, and sunburnt, and be longing to the soil, which they dig and grub with invincible Btubbornneaa They seem capable of articulation, and when they stand erect they display human lineaments They nre, m fact, men. They retire at night into their dens, where they live on black bread, water, and roots " Yes, to this the gay peasants of sunny Trance had been reduced by an oppression incredible, unrelenting, and wholly faeaathke, because thoughtless and heartless ; an oppression which operated through agents like him who said of a rather moro prosperous neighbour- hood, " I have noticed that the peas- ants are stouter here than elsewhere, and that they have chicken feathers before their doors Their taxes must be in- creased. ' Great God in heaven, if such people as these have no deliverer -, if they are to drag on such man-mulcted Bufferings aa these for a whole life time, only to bury them in the grave-where is reason, where is justice, where ii God ? Can we cry aloud in Buch days, with the author of the Apocalypse, "Alleluia, Salvation ; glory and honour and power bo to tho Lord onr God, wlan A n _h,_ou" »re His lodgments, for He «it ?Jh¿5,eVihS *'Pb whote whi°n a»* ir- rupt the earth Can we Bay this and nan we whisper to the poor Bufferers-YoS have »rutbeim Heaven, and this life ia not° «JJ. Wait patiently a little while, and there sha be for yo« a place where they hunger n more neither thirst any more-for the Lam which IB in the midst of the throne Bball fee them and lead them to living fountains o waters, and God shall wipe away all tear from their eyes ? Can we Bay this, and be lieve it with all our heart and soul'-for i not, how can we help our brethren in BUCI days to resist the fell suggestion, "Cara God and die? ' Fine sentiment may do, pel hops, for timeB of peace and fulnesa c bread, but what can help UB, what can gtv ua hope and self controlling patience in BUC! days aa thoBe, but the undoubting faith in future righteous retribution ? Wo may not b permitted to Bay, then, that MOJOS was silou upon the doctnuo of a future life becaua that doctrine was practically useless Whj then, we ask again, did he totally suppress and not correct, a doctrine with which h was well acquainted' The reason is to b found, I believe, in the necessity of weamu Israel from a demoralising idea of a futur life in the interest of a hither truth Th temple of true religion reata on two foundo tiou stoneB-the belief in a personal relatio to God, and the belief in a future Ufo i which that relation shall be perfected an* developed But yon will seo from this ver method of stating the fact that the latte truth muBt be subordinate to the formel If a future life is providod in orde to perfect our relation to God, tha relation ia the very causo of ita exial t-nce A future life giveB apace am time for the development of our know ledgoofGod, of our effort to become lik God That knowledge, then, and that effor must constitute the one thing needful, mua furniBb tbe sole condition ou which a futur life can bo of any worth to us Suppose then, that there bo in any country a theory o a fnture life which obscures and corrupt muuB knowledge and love of God Thei that theory will do harm, and it may becom necessary to withdraw attention entirely fron the thought of a future existence, in order ti impress the first treat neglected truth of ou personal relation to God i hia is exact!; what Moses did and our recently aciuirei knowledge of the Egyptian religion show that what he did, however astonisluug a first Bight, was nothing less than necessary Some of you, perhaps, who know sonietkini of the Egyptian book of the dead ma; bo at first inclined to doubt this Coull anj thing you may think have a better effec on conduct than the searching moral tria which that book assured ever} Egyptian hi would have to undergo' So at brat sight i ma} seem But then we are met by thi startling fact that it produced no auch effec on conduct, that, on the contrary, tlu iuonu inents Bhovv UB a people of specially vicioui and lascivious life How IB this' The faul of the people, I answer, had been corrupted Their faith in God had taken a wrong direc tion, and had Bunk into a demoralising Pan theiem Their hope of acquittal at the grea judgment was thought to depend, not on vir tuouB obedience to a moral law, but 01 charms, amulets, magical formult? talismans incantations, and all the base machinery of c superstitious formalism. It naturally foi lowed that purification, which now mean! simply the doing of superstitious acts, was deferred to the next life, and men lived m the present justaa their passions drove them Thus the Egyptian theory of a future life became a positive instrument of immorality But you may ask, Could this great corruption of faith have taken place as early aB the time of Moses ' You must re- member that in the time of Moses, Lgyptian civilisation was more than 2 000 years old older than ia the Christian church to day A Btatue of an Egyptian king was sent to one of the international exhibitions at Pane which bad been hewn 3 SOO yeara before Christ This may give you Borne idea how very modern to an Egyptian would appeal the age of Moses Recently, however, we obtained a clearer proof than this that Moses lived in the days of Egyptian declension An Egyptian romance was found lately in the grave of a Christian monk It professed to tell the history of one of the sons of the great Rameses, a contemporary of Moses, and it is full of stories implying an implicit belief in the wildest magical superstitions The Israelites must have been well acquainted with this degenerate phase of Egyptian faith , and hence the absolute necessity of with drawing their attention from a misleading and debasing eschatology to fix it upon that great belief in a personal relation to God, under the inspiration of which true views of the future could alone be originated and de veloped This, it will be found, is a truth of universal application The moral effect of the belief in a future life depends always on the conception men form of their relation to God. It is so in Mohammedanism Its God has been described by Palgrave as a being dwelling " alone and sterile on his own inac cessible height, acknowledging no law but his own arbitrary will, and allowing no love "in his indifferent and unregarding despotism." What effect has this belief then, on the Mohammedan doctrine of immortality ' It leaves a sensuous life in the next world as possible as it was here Neither on earth nor in paradise could tho Moslem feel the force of St Paul's sublime appeal ' Know ye not that your body ia the temple of the Holy Ghost' ' Shall I take the members of Christ and make them members of a harlot?" Did time permit, it would be easy to show you how the same law prevails in the ancient Aryan faiths. Because in the pantheistic vedanta philosophy the world soul which was its god, flowed freely through all forms therefore was such a process pos sible to that spark of this soul, which was man But since to an Aryan, with his pro found ethical feeling man a moral o ta le must always govern hia life, therofore the stroke of conduct waa felt in all tboae viler trana migrations of being through which the sinner had to pasS Again the Brahman's thought of God degraded his thought of immortality Gautama, the Buddha horrified at this eternal round of misery and illusion, and determined to break what were called the ' bonds of action, enters upon the career of a reformer How shall he get rid of trans migration' How shall he purify the doctrine of a future life ' He finds at last there is only one way He must change the conception of God So he thinks away, not only the gods of the popular theology, but even Brahma himself, and arrives at that idea of Nirvana which gives him the sense of emancipation, and makes him the light of Asia As before the moral effect of the doctrine of a future life is seen to defend on the doctrine of man's relation to God Can you not see at once then, first, why Job began with so dreary a conception of Sheol, and, secondly, why be felt himself impelled gradually towards a larger hope? So long as he held the popular view about God, that he met every earthly virtue with an adequate reward, and every earthly sin with an adequate punishment, so making this life a rounded and self explanatory whole, it was possible to look no further than the end of this life But if our present existence did not present this imaginary moral completeness (and that it did not was to Job self evident), then the question might be started whether perhaps there might not be wider spaces of time and freer spiritual conditions of existence in which the tangled beginnings of our life might be worked out through a gradual un ravelling to more beautiful and compro hensible issues Job was impelled along this line of speculation by two forces—first by the felt need of a vindicator in the presence of unjust accusation, and, secondly, by his faith that the Eternal Justice so loved him that it would not leave him without vindica tion And what if this might not bo hero' What if, in bia preBont fleeting deciying life there was neither time nor apace for the do velopment of these grand isauea' Still, as jostice has the right to be, and God has the will and power to make it be, space and time will be found for my vindication-if not in this life, then in another. Driven on by this imperativo " must be of conscience, the thought of a future life gradually takes more and more definite shape It comes up in tho 14th chapter as a mere conception, in thi 10th as a demand, and at length in the 10th as a confident and triumphant belief Very suddenly does the celestial afflatus descend on the patriarch's spirit at last, but yet vvj can already discern, I think, in the sadden ing pleading tone of verse 21, that some grea' change IB at hand " Have pity on me, cneB the sufferer, " have pity on me, O yo roy friends, for the hand of Eloah bath touched me TheBO words seem to bespeak that Boftening of the heart, that sudden exaltation of the feelings into an exceedingly mobile sensitiveness which so Btrikingly precedes the ecstatic rapture of some con- versions One who knew anything of this condition of Bpint, and had narrowly watched the successive phases of Job's feeling might almost have anticipated that sudden check and sob BB it were, of exultation with which at length he bursts forth-" I know that my Vindicator livetb, ' and that He will Burely make plain my innocence Yea, not only BO, but I eball live to see it, not here, perhaps, in this frail tottering tabernacle, but yonder, " without my flesh aball I see God, whom mine eyes shall behold and not another," Here again, then, we see the noble uses o! adversity Aa it was soul-travail which nerved Abraham for his heroism of self sacrifico, aa it was soul travail which strengthened Jacob for his night-wrestle at Pt neil, eo it is soul travail now which, driving the spirit-tossed patriarch closer to God, carries him right beyond the limits of sense and time to find vindication in eternity. As with Job, so with Israel: he wins the knowledge of immortality through suffering. Good was it, no doubt, in happier daya to think of the glory on Zion and the living ilovo which dwelt beneath tho vine an ¡brooded over the homestead of every Bon o Israel But the thot'gbt was too big for it environment Such n God, such a Father o mankind '-how could Uo be restnotcd t the here and now ' Signs of the exiBtenc of such a feeling Bprmg to light m gleam and Hashes of presentiment, even in th earlier prophetic literature But out into th full light of consciousness it cannot com lill national affliction has discredited th here and now, till Israel fails in the secular conflict, till, cast forth like Job on the ash heap of contempt and captivity, she is left alone with her spirit and her God Then she first realises how great these are Then you hear the grand cry, " O Thou that m habiteat (not tho Temple the outward thing) but " the praises of Zion Then you hoar thi glorious chant of the Deutero Isaiah, " fhi Gentiles shall come to thy light and kin^i to the hntbtneas of thy rising There mud bo room for thia mighty kingdom-room a-. wide na the earth-yea, and time for it too -time, OB Daniel announces, vost as tin greater reachea of eternity, for then " minyoi them that Bleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some te slmnio and everlasting contempt ' All thie grandcertaintj ia theaflirmatiouof conscience driven on, for the most part, by the stress ol doubt and Buffering It ia not otherwise to day now deep IB the Buffering of many c man who fears that he baa parted for evei from the friend of his heart There lies all which remains of him, and it is earth and food for worms Hon dare I believe that he lives in tbo face of such evidence as that' Teeble reason ctuuot help me Oil tho utter most bound of her horizon there is not a cloud of certunty as big as a mau s hand Lay revelation aside, and what help can reason give UB in da}8 like these' The savage could thiuk that the BOUI left the body to range through the fantastic ecenery of tho dream Wa know that the dream ia onl} imperfect cerebration , that it means possibly nothing moro than tho too feeble contraction of u muscle The poet may let hirnaelf be carried av-ny by the «eductive analogiea of nature, by the app «eut resurrection of the spnug tide and now birth of tho butterfly, but rea Eon knows that this is nothing better than mere illusion-that in none of these caaes waa thero the reality of death Prove, crios Neville, that the man ia dead YOUBIIOW mo the ruins of his bodily tabernacle Jhat is nothing Prove that the strong spirit which wrestled with the problems of lifo, which could soar beyond the stars and find out God-prove that that ia dead I cannot, answers ecieuce, but aa little can I prove that the man waa more than you call taber nacle Alua ' alaa ' would that I could Do }Ou think, then, enea the impatient que^ tioner within, that such a nature could como to Buch au end, that all that pro nnce pointed to nothing, tint all thoae aspirations led no whither, that theae mighty beginnings, so pregnant with tlonoua posai bihties, are cut off abruptly by tho mere atoppngo of the breath' It IB hard to think it I would fain not, crus reason , but how can I know that every rudely cut block will come to be a perfect statue, that every lovely form will attain to the ideal which it ia Btriving after ' Naturo ia full of nnreiliaed ideale, and eo are tho history and the life of men I can but gueBS and show you possi- bilities Evidence I have none None?
