POETRY. . LETHE. Adown the slumberous land one river fbwe, Slow, silent, under light of stars or sun, Palling from a far land that no one knows, To agreat sea where ail the streams are one. A bloom of lilies lies upox his breast, Whose coia roots grasp tne sunless slime below, Never hath passion broken on their rest. Nor amorous tear dropfe on their loveless snow. What time the sun throws wide his golden doer Aad kindles peak on peak to amethyst, ' A sigh breathes o'er these w oods of sycamore. And through the twinkling tree-tops trails the mist. Rolling through glistening glens that stream shall glide. Weeping, those ghosts snail stand upon the shore. And serrow with oblivion shall abide. Till stream, and sea, and mountain be no more. â€” w All the Year Bound."
