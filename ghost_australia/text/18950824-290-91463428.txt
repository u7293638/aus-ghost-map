pttk JfoM LITTLE PITCHERS. [By John S. Adams.] Little pitchers whose cars are long Shall be the burden of iny song ; Frolicsome boys and laughing girls With rosy cheeks and clustering curls, With eyes of black and brown and blue, Who so worthv of sonir as vou. ? 'Little pitchers ?' Would father a secret of state confide To a chosen comrade, true and tried? Has mother something of moment deep Too weighty for her alone to keep ? — Of quiet nooks they may well beware, For without a doubt they are listening there — 'Little pitchers.' Little pitchers ask questions queer That sometimes cause us to quake with fear ; Little care they for hint or frown — Like Banquo's ghost they will not ' down ;' Words that are icy and looks that freeze Alike are wasted on rogues like these — 'Little pitchers.' 'Little pitchers' remember well, And their fearful tales they are sure to tell, Be it later or be it soon, ?. Always at moments inopportune. Frightful phantoms with twinkling feet, Beautiful, horrible, terrible, sweet ' Little pitchers ! '
