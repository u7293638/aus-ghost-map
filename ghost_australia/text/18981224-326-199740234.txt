MISFORTUNES NEVER COME ALONE. health better than wealth. DEATH HAKES A DOUBLE ATTACK BUT IS FOILED BY DODD'S KIDNEY PILLS. While in the best of health it is risky to explore the crazy and rotten workings of an abandoned mine. When the eyes are dimmed with disease and the muscles contracted with pain, it is indeed danger ous to grope amongst the murky drives and the subterranean chambers which the superstitious people with the phantoms of tliriir excited fancy. Many an old mine in this colony has the reputation of being haunted by the ghosts of its victims. The most likely wraith to meet in them, how ever, is a species of death, as the following will show : — " Orange Gardens, Maryborough, " 14th October, 1898. " The Dodds Medicine Co., — " Up till two months ago my health was very unsatisfactory. I had rheumatic pains in the hack and legs, which grew worse. While engaged with a mate ex ploring an abandoned mine at Mariners' Reef fur gold I caught cold, and had the misfortune to meet with an accident. 1 fell 30 feet down the shaft, narrowly escaping death and meeting with severe injuries to the back and head. This, coining on my former ill health, pros trated roe altogether. At this time a friend brought me two boxes of Dodd's Kidney Pills, which I took and continued. They have effected a wonderful change. -Am now in the best of health, and grateful for'the good done me. " Yours, ' Albert .Tonus." Had Mr. Jones taken Dodd's Kidney Pills before examining the old mine he might have been saved the accident. With braced muscles and alert eyes, which are the index of health, the slip which precipitated him down the shaft would not have happened. If he has not yet got the gold he sought he has obtained something infinitely better in the shape of good health. Dodd's Kidney Pills are sold by all chemists and storekeepers at ?s. fid. a box, six boxes, fourteen shillings and six pence or will be sent, (post paid) on re ceipt of price by The Dodds Medicine Co., Melbourne.
