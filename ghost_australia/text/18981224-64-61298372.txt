"ALONE." AN AUSTRALIAN POEM BY FRED. J. BROOMFIELD. From Brook's "Australian Christmas Annual." The mists pass wraith-like through the trees With trailing trains of wreathed white----- They glide, the bush ghosts of the night ; They fade before the rising breeze. " Ringed " monarchs, dying all too soon, Stand sapless, trembling in the cold, And groan and quiver---early old--- And point their fingers at the moon. The eldritch cry of startled bird, The dreaming watch-dog's plaintive sob, Attune them to the ceaseless throb Which through the livelong night is heard. Where ghostly gleams the toadstool's lamp, Amid moss-soddened, ti-tree bowers, The hoarse frog tallies off the hours, Down in the fetid, rush-grown swamp. From gullied gloom, where never strays Yon feeble moon's pale, sickly beam, Shrieks out the weird and eerie scream That never frights the sun-lit days. The bittern drums upon his log In muffled beat, suggesting death, And ever and anon the breath, Is caught when howls the native dog. The curlew pipes his wizard note And dances in the moonbeams white, The squirrel curdles all the night With screams that strangle in his throat. The stars an icy light ray down From out the cold, clear, midnight sky ; The pale moon, witch-like, rides on high, And knits her white brows in a frown. The tall trees shiver through the night ; They shake their tresses to and fro ; Then falls a palsied limb below ; They sigh-and shudder with affright.
