..PORTFOLIO. ! We are surrounded: on. very side by objects fitted by theirsvery constitution to :point us to spiritual realities,ibut sin.rha? blinded us to their significance ; seeing, e see and do not perceive them.t -By neglect. and:carelessness we have: made, ourselve's unable :to. discern hundreds of beautifuil things, which:,are well fitted to?farnish matterfor constant delightful' and devoe-' tional thought.;, ,WVe, see, only .truths:.of development land, creation in, nature, and! not those of love and redemption-=-of.morraf and spiritual.,life., The evidences .which it.affords ofrGod's existence are merely; mechanical demonstrations, proofsof design and of skilful workmanship--not symbolu' of spirit! and love-correspondences be tween the outward and the inward-theÂ· fleeting shadow and the eternal substance;' consequently our hearts are not touched with reverence, our spirits are not humbled and purified by the vision of God's holi ness. He who made man in the image of God, made earth in the similitude of heaven; and therefore the enlightening of the soul is the apocalypse of nature-the anointing of the eye with spiritual eyesalve is the discovery in whatsoever things are pure and lovely here-the type of brighter .things above. Let us seek, then, this true euphrasy-let us train our eye to truth and openness-so that we mai behold with open face the "open secret' of the uni verse; that since it is the law of Ileaven to confer spiritual gifts in the presence. of their material representatives-to baptize with water and with the Holy Ghost- to givo'the blessedness of Divine communion with the bread and wine of the sacrament we, as Christ's disciples, may have the ex planation of IIis heavenly parable spread. Ing around us, when like Isane we go out to meditate in the fields, and may hear HIlis voice saying to us, " Blessed are your eyes, for they see l"--.finrstry of Nature .
