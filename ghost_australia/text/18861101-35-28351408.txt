Z't'ik-'. < ßPOBTINQ .INTELLIGENCE. yiOTOBIA RACING CLUB SPRING MEETING. ' . ' FIRST (DERBY) DAY. [BY TMJEORAPH.] ;I (snoai COB SPECIAL RKPOBTBHII.) MELBOURNE, ST/NDAY. Although tho morning broko fino, the ginns bogan to fall ?bout 9 o'olock, and a strong westerly wind blew with \ great force, raising olouds of dust. The city was early astir, »nd from 10 to 2 trains continuously rattled away with crowds of the race- loving public. Tho road was well watored, but tho very strong wind rendered the drive to tho courso most unpleasant. Tho visitors wero astonished at tho wonderful improvements which havo boen mndo sineo i tho last meeting. The hill has boen extended, and now affords standing room for an additional 3000 jporsons. The ocoupants of tho hill have been further favoured by tho ercotion of a new stand, wlu'ch is 237 feet long, and is capable of accommodating 5000 spectators. On tho eastern sido of tho grand stand a now structure has found a place, lt is called tho Maribyrnong stand, and is '. nearly 240 feot long, providing sitting room for 2500 persons. It is fronted by a spacious lawn. Tho lawn in front of tho grand stand has been oxtonded so as to givo . additional room for noarly 10,000 people Tho scratching boards, and other improvements, aro completo in every detail, and Flemington can now fairly claim to bo tho niost 'porfect racecourse in tile world. The Vice-regal party arrived early, and tho box set apart for their accommodation contained Sir Henry Loch, Govornor of Victoria ; Lord Carrington, Governor of Now South AVnlos; Sir "Willinm Robinson, Governor of South Australia ; Sir George Strachan, Govnmor of Tasmania; Admiral Tryon, Lady Loch, Lady Carrington, and other distinguished personages. Fivorything was in tho bent possible order, nnd tho various stands wore clean and bright looking. Tho ^cont ruins havo made tho hill and Ant look fresh and green. 'Tho courto was in splendid condition, and tho racing was of » very high olnss order. Tho Australian Military Band per- formed on tho lnwn, and tho Imperial BrnssBnnd discoursed ?weet music on tho hill. Tho catering was of tho beftt descrip- tion, and far superior, in point of attendance, to Randwick, whoro many improvements nra needed. Tho attendance of ; the public was larger than on any previous Derby day, and there wore a great number of ladies present. In honour of Lord Carrington's visit, the race books in morocco bindings usod by tho Vice-regal party wore got Up in his riding colours-blue and buff-and tho Vice- regal reception and retiring rooina wero also decorated in tho same tinls. Lord Carrington gracefully acknowledged "tho compliment thus paid him by tho V. R. C. committco. Tho racing commenced willi tho Melbourne Stakes, for which Sheot Anchor was first elected favourite, but when tho horses assembled nt tho post, tho friends of Isonomy ..gave him such genuino support that ho started a hotter .'favourite than unything. Lord William cut out tho work !to tho homo turn, whoro Sheet Anchor appeared nt tho ¡front, but was outpaced by Isonomy, who would have won 'had ho not allowed Boolka to dash up on tho insido and : make a dead heat after a brilliant battle. Tho mn off took pince after tho Inst raco of thc day. Isonomy was itnost in favour, and lcd by a nock to tho distnnco, whoro .fter a pretty strugglo ho drew away and won comfortably !by four lengths in 2 minutes lOf seconds. A dozen horses .'»tarted for the Hotham Handicap, and Hexham was ro Igurded as a good thing. Salvo and Hexham rando most of !tho running, and at the last turn, soinothing colliding with 'tho former, Hexham carno away, looking like a winner, ,lut when fairly in tho straight Claptrap came 'Hp with a great rush und, cutting down ovory ¡thing, won very easily by five lengths from tho ifavourito, who was quito unnblo to paco with him. .The Maribyrnong Plato candida! os wore n rather ,poor lot compared with previous years. Hortense, a Ano »tripping filly, looked equal to carrying any weight, and the way in which eho sailed homo with hor heavy penalty proved hor to bo a downright good ono. Huntingtower 'revorsed the Btable notions by finishing before Miranda and Oceana, who lookod thoroughly well. Esperance stripped Ss well as anything in tho race, and is a'beautiful filly, but .extinguished her chauco of winning by bolting nt tho tan Grossing, where sho quito overpowered tho English .jockey, Whiting; and Lava only showed prominently St tho last furlong, when sho travelled ut a great taco. Her running was a groat disappointment. Hortonso von through sheer gameness, and so Bcorod a second win for Adelaide She was heavily hacked by her party. Sovon îneed tho ting- for tho Derby, and, notwithstanding tho pre- cious defeat of his stoblo companions, Trident was stanchly iunported to the last. Volcano cut out tho running at a Sosperato puce until ho was under tho hill, when, hueging fho rails too closoly, he struck them, and cut his shoulder and quarter, and hurt Ellis' knee. Chesham, pulling double, then wont to tho front, and Volcano in falling hack caused Trident to lose ground. As it wns seen that Hales was riding him for hislifo,Ithooxoitomentbocamo ¡Intense, and loud crios woro raised that tho favourite was beaton. At tho distanco Robertson still had a strong pull on Chosham, but, answering gallantly from every whip Itroko, Trident caught him at the half distance, and .Chesham tiring suddenly, tho favourite won tho Blue Kibbon by two lengths. Groat excitement ensuod, and tho horso and its rider wore recoivod with nhoora. Hats and handkerchiefs wero wavod in tho air, and the enthusiasm lastedforf ully five minutes. That Trident is wondorf ully gamo was proved by the faot that Holes was at him vigorously with tho spurs for five furlongs. Though tho raco looked faster than our Dorby, it was ono second slower, which was no doubt owing to the strong head wind that was encoun- tered on tho run homo. Tho gallop will benefit Tridont, and ho will run a groat raco for tho Cup. Many porsons think that, but for tho accidont, Volcano would havo won, but I boliovo tho last furlong would havo settlod him. Chesham ran n woudorful colt, and Lamond dosorvos credit, but ftobortson should havemadomorousoof himoftor entering tho straight. Tho othovs wero beaton a long way, and Wero quito outclassed. Maddolina mn a porfect jado, but j Agíaos will soe a bettor day. Tridont's win makes tho fourth Viotorinn Dorby won by tho Hon. James White. Tho Ghost was a groat favourito for tho Soiling Raco, but Huron won easily, and was bought in for £230. Alargo field started for tho Coburg Stakes. Tho Nun and Gold lake wore most fancied, but though the former ran well, »ho finished fourth. Tho latter was nover in it, and after William. Toll had mado tho most of tho running, he retired suddenly, and St. John was loft in command. At the half distanco Daystar, quito an outsider, who had boon in tho first flight always, carno through and won by a nook. Tho ring Won by tho results of tho Hotham Handicap and tho Coburg Stakes, but tho othor races went against thom, and tho victory of Trident was a heavy blow. Should ono of too favourites win the Cup tho bookmakers will havo a fcad time of it. With tho exception of tho Coburg Stakes ¡Mr. Goorga Watson's starting waa fuultless. Tho trains .Vero disgracefully crowded on tho rotura, journey, and the public woro put to great inoonvouience through tho crush- ing and crowding that took placo. Tho thanks of tb0 ItiprcBentativos of tho press aro duo to the club for tho excellent accommodation provided for them'. Tho numbers of tho horses corresponding with tho race-books .woro exhibited on tho Bnddle-oloths BB ut Caulfield and Rose- hill. This arrangement waa highly approved by tho public .Tho same idea should bo adopted at Randwick. Thero jroro a groat many visitors from Sydney, Adelaide, and Queensland, and all of them wero delighted with the im provemontB that have boen offoctod, and arrangements that have been made for tho convonionco and comfort of tho spectators.

Hero First Prince fell. Hexham just led Salvo along tho back of tho course, and Lesbia joining at tho abattoirs,, they came round the homo tum together, attended by The Pencil and Claptrap, whilst Ringmaster was Inst, apparently not troubling himself.

Hero Esperance lost her chunco by running oi'f, and in doing so somewhat interfered with Miranda. A little further on Hortense closed on Bedouin, and Oceana and HuntinL'lowor run into prominent places. .Aberdeen also improved bia position, whllo the others, including Lava, wero hopelessly out of it. Hortense disposed of Bedouin at tho distanco, and Huntingtower dashing up on tho insido a great race took pince, Hortense winning by a short half length.

They wero stint away in a lino, Chosliam jumping: off in front, but Volcano on tho outsjde at onco | took command and led past thc stand, attended by Chesham, Kingfish, Maddelino, and Aglnos, with First Connul last. Making the paco wonderfully fast. Volcano led along tho rivor bank by four lengths, with Chesham next, two j lengtliB in front of Kingfish, who was a length clear from Maddelinn and Trident, who were raokifc on terms, followed by Agíaos mid First Consul. When passing tho | bridgo Chesham was within two lengths of tho leader, and Maddelina having beaton a retreat Trident went up third, attendod by Kingfish. Carrying on the running at a great paco Volcano led hy four lengths ut tho back of tho course, with ; Chesham second, and Trident, Kingfish, and Maddelinn two lengths off on fenns. When passing tho abattoirs Chesham, who was pulling doublo, reduced Volcano's lead , to two lengths, cud Trident, leaving Kingfish and | Maddelina, settlod down to chase tho leaders, but although fully extended he gained but littlo. and at tho 6hcds Halos waa compelled to sit down und ride him. Volcano, still going strongly, led to tho half-mile post, when ho struck the rails, sñd falling back, Chesham full of running appeared at tho front. Hales now called upon Trident, but Volcano, in staggering from tho rails, interfered with him, and ho lost a few lengths. Chesham turned into tho straight with on advantage of four lengths, and ns Hales drew his whip, a roar from the stand proclaimed tho unmis- takeable fact that tho favourite was in trouble. Respond- t ing with Bearh- liko gameness from over)- cut, ho, with bia tembló stride, gradually gained on Chesham, but tho latter drew away again and looked all over a winner. Smuggling on lileo a racohorco, Trident caught him when loss than'half tho distance from homo, and, drawing away, won cleverly at tho end by threo lengths lunidst a sceno of great excitement. Agíaos was 30 lenrrtlis off, and was followed by Firet Consul, Kincriish, Maddelina, and Volcano. Time, 2 minutes 39 seconds.
