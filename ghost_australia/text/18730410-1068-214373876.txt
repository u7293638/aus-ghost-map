MID-DAY GAMP. RoAny I tho sun's duo north, and so, old liorso, As wo liavo fairly oarncd an hour of ease, Wo'll camp bosido this shallow watovoourso, Aud tako advanlago of thoso shady trcos. Tlioro's grass upon tho hank, if thoro you'll stay, And wator, where tho cattlo oonio to drink ; No need for yon to wandor far away, Old friond, you nro too staid for that I think. My mcnl dispatch od, I lie beneath tho shade, And list the curlew's inoliinoholy noto ; I hoar tho lowing of tho distnnt station cows, Tho luooking cry from jay's discordant throat. And now to othor times my thoughts will stray, Before I know lho stockman's rougher lifo ; For I, liko othor dogs, "have had my day," And borno mo fairly in tho world's strife. Thoro wns a timo when I had liiglior aims, Than thus to no among tho troos and liston To laughing birds, or wntoh tho sun's hot flames O'or tho broiul plain's surfaoo glow and gliston. There was a time, pcrhnps, when I'd tlioiiglit To mnko a mime, a hoiuo, a bright oxistonco ; Rut timo lias shown mo that iny dreams wore nought Savo a mirago that vanished with tho distanco. Woll, now it's gono, " so wags tho world away," With many ns high anil bottor aspiration. And so — I wondor whoro tho " scrubbors " stray — A herdsman's caro upon a cattlo station, Como on, old Iloaiiy, lot us start again, Memory's doad ghost in hasto I'll clinso away ; Its limiting shadows bring mo nought but pain, Or wistful rovorios of a hanpior dav.

A Yankee poot ami liis wifo wore walking out in tlio moonlight, 'l'lio lady wns also of nn exceedingly poctio nature, and suid to her mato, " Notieo that moon ; bow bright nnd calm, and bountiful !" "Oomln't think of noticing it," roturnod tho pool, " for nnything loss than tho usual rates— a dollar and li ft v cents for twelve lines." v
