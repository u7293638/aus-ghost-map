\ ; ( - " PAET II. ¡ Por some days after this conversation Godfrey noticed that Miss Burton was continually, trying to/arouse his interest about the' haunted house. So-and-so had seen and heard very stf anythings, but were too chiokeri-hearted. to follow|it'Up. A stranger was moBt ^likely to sée anything,>&c.; ? " Would you get up and investigate , if \ you heard'anything, Mr. Godfrey ?" . > ! " Yes/ pledge ' my> word that if >I:see 01 hear anything, Til find out what it "is at any cost." She laughed; a..Httle incredulous laugh as ahe turned away. "If I do sleep there," thought he, Vit; willi be when you know nothing about it, Ladye Fayre. You'd dearly like to make me ridiculous in Mary Oldham's eyes." ::V "> .^^/f] ''? :; ;;"; ";''"' ' ! About a week after this John Burton and God frey were returning after a couple pf days* absence. Hearing of a cattle cale which was coming off in the next town to the station, Bur ton decided to wait till the next morning for it, while Godfrey rode home that night.' . , ¡ The night was very dark and warm. He, could see. lights in the drawing-room ; but, instead of going up the front entrance, he dismounted at a hut near the Btone house: - , '. ' " Andy," Baid he to the blackfellow who Came to the door, " take my horse to the stable,^giying him half-a-crown. " Don't go near the,house, or say to anyone that I came back, mind." 11 "Yes, sah." . ;;; *,,,' .' " I'll sleep in one of the rooms here." , Andy grinned, whatever fun he anticipated,. " Now," thought Godfrey, as he entered one pf the rooms, and, striking a light lit tho candle which was on the table, " I'll turn in and laugh at Esther in the morning." . He looked at his watch. "Only .10 o'clock j but I'm tired." In a few minutes more! he was in bed and soon sound asleep. How long ho Blept he knew not, but he was suddenly broad awake with a consciousness of having been suddenly awakened. Sitting .up ho listened intently. All was silent. He was about to He down again when his hand touched some thing cold On the pillow. Striking a matoh he found a quantity of soft damp earth scattered about. " Ha, that's been thrown in through the door. That black wrotch has given ino away." He, looked round the room. Everything else was as he had left it. His clothes lay on ' a chair near tho door, great coat uppermost. " I'll foil you with your own woapons, Esther." .said ho lying down again,fully conscious that she had foiled him moro than onco when he had led up to the words which were to seal his fate with Mary Oldham, and Esther had always contrived, to interrupt them just at the wrong moment;. Suddenly he heard the handle of ' the door touched gently. Creak. The door opened; slightly^ and he heard a. low *deep/BÍgti!(;,'''^e^í)iíig regular breathing M. a, sleeper,, ^èr^|M^j^ tently and saw the.hand wCáw^^íhe^^e^o^ line of a whíte-rpbédfi^ '?

Springing; up Godfrey made for his clothes, intending, to drag something on as he gave chase. But he found to his dismay that, every article of them was gone. He had a moat impulsive disposition. " Let her take the consequences," said he darting out in his ono , garment. As he ;reaohed the end' of the verandah he saw ¡something move lin the garden. He vaulted over the, fence and landed in a gooseberry bush, Extricating, himself, he tore in a bee line! to the upper gate before it was possible , for, whoever ;was :in the garden to reach it. : ' V Whoever is ;,in. here, nuißt turn bapk- or face ; me. ,, If , they turnback, 'I can reach that-lower , gate n about as ' quickly, as ; any ghost on these premises."

A rush from óutsidé, "and twp'pf t^ went at the' gate,' jumping fiercely, with terrific clamor, against it. ."Such pf my_ mortal. remains as are left from the.caterpillars these ¡dogs ^illyfi over," said he, groping for a1 stick. Suddenly thé dogs ceased, and he heard an attempt made tç get them away, and a low sound he thought he recog- i nised.

Just then he heard rather than saw, some thing moving through the darkness toward the lower gate. .Forgetting his disgust in the eagerness of .'pursuit, he flung the ; despised rug round his waist, and with quick noiseless strides waa soon up with the object of his search., With a quick spring he had hold of some one who resisted fiercely for a minute, then collapsed with, a plaintive ?: " Oh, do lot mogo, Mr. Godfrey." , . . : "Good heavenë Miss Oldham, you-playing ghost!" ! .';. ; .;..'.' /:;;';' ; ";;;.;;!' .
