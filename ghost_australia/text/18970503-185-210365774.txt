THE ORIGIN OF HAMLET. Mr Arthur Lyttelton, in a paper entitled ‘A Guess at the Origin of Hamlet,’ maintains that the play, as it originally existed, before Shakepeare took it in hand, was ‘Hamlet’ without Hamlet, the character of the Prince of Denmark being the addition which Shaks peare made to the original drama:—' ‘ My theory of the construction of Hamlet is this —Shakepeare, taking up, like any other playwright and manager of the time, a play that had evidently struok the popnlar fancy, found it a very barren story of revenge, with a murder, a ghost, a good deal of bloodshed, and some striking lineß and phrases. There was apparently nothing much to be made nut of this. But the poet’s imagination, and his intense interest in char acter, seizsd on the one point in which there lay a possibility. He took the merely ex ternal causes of delay, as the old piece represented them, and transformed them into internal subjective motives, arising out of the natnre of ttie man himself.’
