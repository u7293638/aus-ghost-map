CURRENT LITERATURE. Mr Richard Holt Hutton is one of the best known critics, whose weekly excursions into many fields, theology, poetry, meta physics, history, biography, and general literature, have been for years the chief distinctive feature of that admirable journal, the Spectator In association with Mr Meredith Townsend, he had helped to give the bjKclalor the name it enjoys as being the fairest and most independent of weekly London newspapers, with a vogue and influence perhaps exceeding any other of its contemporaries now that the Saturday Review 13 but the ghost of its former brilliant self Mr Hutton has not been altogether well-advised in re- printing from the Sp< ctator, even after a process of selection, the papers which are included in the comprehensive title of G's incisors of Contemporary Thou In and Trainers (Mnomtllan) In their original place these were among the best and most valued of the articles in the Spectator. Detached from their setting they are seen to have some palpable defects, due to the conditions of their birth They are too short, too slight, and too discursive to do justice either to the subjects or to the writer Within the compass of two moderate sized volume, containing matter hardly III excess of three volume novel, we have nearly) eighty pieces of criticism. They embrace every con enable subject, from the evolution of theology) to insect conservatism From the Duty of Happiness to the future of Humour there is nothing which Mr, Hutton's universal genius has not comprehended Some of these papers, though marred by brevity-which 13 a condition not favourable to the development of Mr Hutton's genius-are admirable in spirit and in effect. Others had better have been left in the back numbers of the Spec, labor, for, though good enough for a weekly newspaper, they are scarcely good enough for a book Mr Hutton is very good on Ardent Agnosticism, on Cardinal Newman, on the new theologies of the new sociologist Mr Hutton is no better than fifty others when he reviews Edgar Poe or Thomas Carlyle He is d18 tinctly unhappy in his treatment of Dickens, for humour is not a strong point in Mr Hutton He is absurdly over partial to Matthew Arnold, as when he declares that Arnold has almost rendered Milton a postal lit) It into prose, while Arnold B own verse is far better than Miltons it is no great thing to admire in a prose style that it is poetical, and we must decline to admit that the quality of Mr Arnold's prose is at all like Miltons poetry) But Matthew Arnold was always one of the go Is of the Spectator, and it is clear that Mr Hutton himself is in no small degree indebted for his literary development to Arnold With all these drawbacks till he is a great deal to admire in these critical papers 'J they exhibit to us a whole some, manly, and vigorous intellect, which if somewhat deficient in the larger soul of humanity and on the religious side a little narrow and ascetic, still belongs to the highest and noblest journalism-journalism of a kind which has now become old fashioned South Sea Yann, by Basil 'I houison (Blackwood), partake something of the languor of their surroundings Mr Thomson seems to be intimately acquainted with him He is steeped 111 kannten lore and legend, but his new arc bring out a little thin The opening sketches are capital, and where Mr '1 houison describes actual life and manner The 13 good But some of the other stones are too long and not very Irish South Sea legends accept to repeat themselves, and to resolve themselves into details of man eating A new and enlarged edition of Mr Mackenzie Bill 8 Charles Whitehead-A tor Holten O'emw has just been published by Messrs Ward, Lock, and Bowden It is preceded) "An Appreciation, from the pen of Mr Hall Caine, the novelist, who praises the Jliclwril Same. of W Inte bend as containing episodes which are "as vivid and rial as adding ' as having written lyric poetry) which is "sometimes as impassioned as Byron, as having written one sonnet which is as chaste as Dante, ' and 113 having been the author of a tragedy which was com- pund 10 Miisainger in the combine I ease, variety, and strength of its blank verse dra logue The fraud of Dickens, the associate 01 Jarrold, and 'tor) cure the life and sum of the famous Shakespeare Club known as The Mullum, the carter of poor Whitehead constituted as sad a change r as is to he found in Jit calamity of Au'hom, and it could not be tion tenderly, com passionately), und H)!iipithcticit!ly linn lied _ than it has been both by Mr Hall Cm in. an 1 b) Mr Muckiii/ic Iel 'His surviving associates of Charles Whitehead in this city -01 writing, perhaps, not more than half a dozen now it summit turn for the first time, we bear ye that the " habit the) deplore 1 There had been an quired in London, and that one of has been free and there deprecated his emigration to) Australia, 119 "turn ing no (intention century mind to a twentieth century country with the ear unit) of collapse Mr Clive regards him as one of the strongest souls, and he verily) be beats on whom the world has yet turned its back has improved li does not, however, apply to poor Whitehill I s funds in Melbourne, would) certainly) did not turn their hands on him.
