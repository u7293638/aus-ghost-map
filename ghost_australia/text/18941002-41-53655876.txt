THE W.C.T.U. TO THB EDITOR Sir— Members of the woman a Christian Temperance Union are second to none in their appreciation of the frees. Tnntyour reporter should bo so aocuratu is surprising when re porting work that is carried on quietiy nnd only comes before the publio once a year ; bun kindly allow me to point out one mistake — un- intentional I am sure— which is no doubc re sponsible for tbe objection to methods used by our Colonial Superintendent of ' Heredity and Hygiene' in the article of September 22 already referred to by some of our leaders. In the Ittyixter of September 20 it is stated that signatures bad been obtained to an ' anti-corset petition.' Is it possible ttmany ona could think we intended to ' humbly pray, &u.;,' any person or persons with regard to this subject? Yet, what else could the word petition mean? I will give the exact words to whioh signatures were ob tained:— 'I hereby certify that I have dis continued the usti of stiff corsets, and will endeavour to recommend this course of action.' Those who signed, in addition to their own comfort, desire to help tho weaker sister who does not wear her dreas 'intelli- gently.' We believe in being temperate in all things, and consider any injury to the 'Temple of the lloly Ghost' intemperance. While I am always thankful for gnud udvice — it is varied aa it is plentiful — I rather think the task of pleasing 'every right-thinking person in the community' beyond us, as many men, and women too, have mauy minds. Our motto, ' For God and Hume and Humanitfjg covers a wider fiald than total abstinence from Btrong drink, or I, for one, should feel afraid of suffering from drink on the brain. I am, Sir. &c;, A MEMBER OF THB W.O.T.U.
