WHAT A GHOST STORY DID. [from bbmravia.] 'All in the dark !' Tho door opened, heavy steps were heard, and a voice said, ' All in tho dark!' , ; . ' ' Papa, how you startled ub I' said a girl's voice, almost from the floor— tho speaker sitting on tho hearth-rug, one knoo slightly raised, hor two bands clasped over it, and nothing visible in tho aomi-darkness of tho room, but a heap of white muslin, with tho moonlight streaming full upon it tnrougn tne large Day winnow ; a simitar patch of white a yard or two off; and a dark figure sitting on a low chair at tho other end of tho room, with two bright bars moving in front- - a pair of knitting-needles— showing tho busy mothor at her constant occupation. Ono of hor favorito maxims -was, 'Always be doing some thing.' She certainly carried it thoroughly out herself. The same could not be said of her daughter on the rug : she dearly loved what she called 'rest- ijjg ' (from what it was difficult to say) ; but being an only child, Bho got a good deal of her own way. So when, on leaving the dining-room, bIio and her cousin had begged for half on hour without lights, Mrs. Vernon had on this occasion givon up her maxim, and they were all thoroughly enjoying the darkness, which { as Ellen Vernon Baiu, ' makes ono f col bo sociable. . Tho gontlemon— the fathor, a bachelor undo, and a boy cousin home from Eton for the holidays — stayed some timo over their wine, adhering to tho old custom ; and it was on open that Colonel Vernon exclaimed, 'All in tho On heariDg his daughter answer ' Us;' he said, ' Who aro us? I can oee nobody. — Qeorgo,' as by tho sound he guessed hia brother was tumbling over the furniture, ' take care ; don't break your kDees, or my ehairs. It's this silly child's fancy, 1 know— dreaming in the moonlight, or gossiping— pulling your neighbors to pieces— eh, Nelly T . „ . '? What a shame J Fancy mamma talking scandal 1 What have you and uncle Qcoigo been discussing— Boraotbing very interesting ? You vo been such a loDg time ! Where's Ned ?' ' Gone to look after liis now ferrets. That bjy ia wild after any kind of aport. But thero, bo ib just what I was at hia age, so I oughtn't to grnmblo.

' Thank you, most polite of boys,' rejoined his cousin. Thoy were very fond or each other, bnt, cousin-like, wore alwayB chaffing. ' 0, I forgot, you're not a boy ; Eton fellowB are never boys, always nion. I won't offend again ; I beg the whole school's pardon, from the head-master to tho smallest fag. Don't annihilate me. Also, it in as well you should know, that white thing you aW so quietly walking upon is my dress— nn( ittr onv mRDnfi Tnnftnf; for von to mnko n. carpet of.' ' I'm bo sorry, Noll ; but why are you sitting in the dark '! Are you telling ghost-stories ? . I declare it would be a jolly time for a good atory ; that moonlightlooksghostined enough. I'll pro mise to scream or faint — which ia the correct thing 1— or I'll carry any of you out that do, and dip yon in the fonntain — warranted to ctrro any fainting ©r hysterics.— Doe3 any one know a story 1 Nell, you're always ready to talk, and you're first rate at odd bits of information ; can't you tell ono?1' ' ?? , ? - ' No, 1 can't ; ana wnac b more, i aon c tmnK I ever heard a real ghost-story ; I certainly don't remember it.— Mamma, you used to tell us lots of sterios ; did you ever tell us ghostly ones Tor can you think of one now ? I should like it of all things,— shouldn't you, Constance?' turning^to her cousin, who had' beon silent since the male addition to the party. 'Don't do anything; of the sort, Maria, I do beg.' And they were quite startled by the earnest, almost imploring, tone. ? . There was a movement in the darkest corner of tbo room, aB George Temple (Mrs. Vernon's brother) advanced to the fireplace, and felt for tho bell. 'I'll ring for lights.' '0, uncle, don't 1' exclaimed Nelly. ' I say. uncle, did you ever see a ghost '(' called out Ned at tho same moment. 'Don't talk nonsense,' George Temple replied. He rang the bell sharply, and then, groping his way to the door, left tbe room. ' Has ueorge gone? said Colonel Vernon. 'Poor fellow ! lie feels it, I do believe, as deeply as ever.' 'Yes,' replied his wife; 'George is not one to forget. I did not remember him when the children wore talking about ghosta ; I ought to have stopped them. No wonder he could not bear it.' ' Mamma, what is it? did uncle ever see a ghost ? What made him so odd ?' ' I don't boliovo in choatu: such, rubbish is only fit for silly old womon. I'm sure uncle Qeorgo is much too sensible,' said Ned. 'Dot*Uus,aunt!' gently entreated his sister Constance. 'Bven your curiosity roused, Constance !' re plied Mrs. Vercou, with an attempt at a laugh— a very poor attempt too. 'No, dears, I don't think I can tell you. It is a very sad story ; my poor brother has never got over it. You know how quiet,, almpat sad,, be, ifl. ;I remember him 'the 'brightest, mcrrienf fellow possible— always full of fun and high spirits. But no wonder. How1 I wish I had stopped the subject to-night ! I bu^ve ifr wjll bring tne whole Been© backhand quito prey upon him, thought it jbeo many year* ago.' ? ..- ' ' , ? .

' Papa, make mamma toll us ; thero can't bo any harm init : we'll iiever repeat it, I'll solemnly promise — won t you,, Connie, and Ned too 1' 'All right,' tbe Etonian said ; ' I don't mind hearing, though I am not ao curious as you girls.' ; ' No, I Bhould, think not— it looks like it' (Nelly's propensity to tease getting tho better of her curiosity.) 'But you are not compelled to stay ; you can rotiro into the garden, and show your manly disregard of our weakness ; only don't come to- morrow and try to got it out of me — I won't tell you a word. Mamma, dear, ycu will tell us, won't you? I hoar John bringing the lamp ; eo, if your story is vory horriblo, wo shan't bo so frightened. Was it a roal ghtnt} I didn't think tboro were such things.' ' My dear, it was tho consequences of a ghoofc story, not the story itself, or oven Booing a.-gboat, that affected your undo. I daresay, liko Ned, ho does not beliovo thero aro such things, though I confess I do.' Then, turning to her husband, ' I don't ace it will do any norm to tell thorn, as thoy wish it so much. What da you say? It may warn Nod never to do 'finch ft. thing.' . 'I bopo ho doesn't rcqulro such a torriblo warning : tho whole thing was most unpardon able. I have only heard your account : but ifl had bcon present. I think I should havo half: killed Major Gordon ; ho certainly would havo got a thrashing. Yes, you had bolter tollithom, if yon like ; only remember, all of you, tho Bub jeet is nover to bo mentioned again beforo your uncle — mind that. I'll goand flco after him. now z perhaps ho is in tho library.' ' Now, mamma* we aro all attention ; do begin.' - It in many years ago (began Mrs. Vernon)— I was a cirl of nixtnon — when mv fathor took a house for a year, two miles from a small watering place on the Yorkshire coast. It was a very quiot placo. Tho only house of any consequence near ours was a handsome ono, with largo park and boiiuUful gardens, belonging to, a Mr. Maatbrton,, whoso family only lived thero three months in tho year, Bpond'iDK tbo rost of their tirao in Lon- J don. or at a lorgor place he had in Northumber land. Our houBO — a sort of enlarged cottnge, with all kindB of odd windows in still oddor filoces, and covered with different creepers;— waa list outaido tho park gaton. We hod been living thoro about two inontha— my fath'.r and mother, your aunt Constance and myself '? George, boing tL-on in tho army, was with bis rogiment in Canada, but wo oxpected him homo, on lenvo, tho next mail — when wo heard tho MaatcrUniS. were 'coming to Holmo Pork for their annual visit. Wo were vory anxious to boo thorn ; they would bo our nearest — in fact, our only — nolghbora for tbrco months ; tho clergyman of the parish being an old bachelor, much liked by my father, but taking littlo nqtico of Constance and myself ; and we hoped to be great friouds with the family at the park. . ?--, There wore two sons and four daughters— tho two youngest boing girls, about our own ragos, sixteen and littcon. Tho Mastertons amveu, on a Friday. Our old Scotch nurso always said, ' No good caino of anything begun on u Friday ;' and this visit was ovor attor her i-ot illustration. Tho dining-room windows of the cottagoV com manded a capital viow of their gatoa ; and wo two girls spent that afternoon ono at eack win dow ; and wore rewarded af tor long watching by seeing the gardener's wifo at the lodge, in a great state of fuss, opening tho gatos and staring down the road at loaat half an hour before a close car riage, a_ private omnibus, and three cabs from t\«n bfrntm»« rl*-A*f a tin Irho nowlAnAva -mi Fa t% tt rl uijv ovavivu uiuvv **¥* 4uo i^iuuvuoi o ituq uuu tho servants wore the only pooplo we Baw that day. As the hones in the first carriage slackonod thoir pace, turning in. at the gate, a gentleman's voice called from tho window, 'How- are you, Mrs. Collins— flourishing, I hope ? I'll come and see you to- morrow ;' . avd that waa a'l. Not much roward for three hours' patient watch ing, i .' ? i The next day was thoroughly wet, and no one camo to the lodge, as we half hoped they would, in spito of the rain ; but at balf-past four a. dog cart driven by a groom camo from the house, clearly bound for the station. An hour paseoa and-twonty and a small buU-terrior occupying the- front Boat, a magnificent deer-hound lying at tho man's feot, the groom and two huge portmanteaus being at the back. The driver waa the eldest eon — then a lieutenant' in tho Guards — now Oolonol Masterton, the nian so well known in India, to whom your undo writes so froquontly. ....' We saw , tho Mastertons at church tho'noxt Sunday. After the second servico we wont, as wo visually did, to the vicarago for tea, whore the Holme Park party also came ; Mr. Mastorton— a thorough country squire, strong and active, fit, in spite of his sixty yearn, to hold his own across country aftor bounds, and a capital shot; hia wifo, palo and dqlicato- looking— tho sort of woman you feel assured loaves everything to be docidod bv her huBband when yountf. and by hor daughters when they grow up ; two daughters and a governess ; tho eldost daughter Margaret and her second brothor romainiog behind indcot land visiting some cousins. '?''?, Tho guardsman, considering afternoon service a work of supererogation, remained at home, Btrolling about tho stables smoking. [ I don it know how it waa, but I took a fancy to Charloy.Mast-orton immeaiatoly. Charley, i you muBt know,, wa3 not a boy, but a young lady o£ twenty. Her proper name was Charlotte; but her father, of whom she was tho especial i pot, had ro-chnstencd her Charley when a .very httle girl, because she was a rogulnr little l-icklo, more like a boy than a girl ; and tho name had stuck to her ever since. /£lho was not really handsome, still less -would you havo callod her pretty j' but she was easontial)y bright-looking— no other word suited her bo. well. I can .hardly describe her particularly; ypt aho stands as vividly beforo my mind's oyonow as she did in bodily presence inore than twenty years ago. She was &' general favorite, especially with gentlemen ; they called her ^' so fascinating' and seemed all of them moro or less in love with hor dark eyes, irregular features, and bright speaking face, sot off by quantities of brown liair always very fashionably dressed. 8ho wa3 proud of ?, this hair, often saying ifc was her only beauty, bo she must make the most of it. I romember think ing, that first Sunday, how I should like to have my hair done the same way, and to be a 'come- out' young lady like her. ,?,'?'; At first Charley talked principally to the vicar, inquiring after half the parish. Presently she turned w- me, asking about a peculiar Russian cat -we had. paying she ?waa, quite foolish about all kinds ot animals-— we must come and see her;col lection — and then she went on to other subjects. Sho must have found both ConBtance andmevmy stupid. Wo had seen very little of tho world, and were ahy ; but Mibs Masteiton did not aeem to mind that, and took such trouble to amuse us, and make U3 talk, that beforo shoroae to say ' Good-bye' we were quite charmed with her,-; in fact, we liked all the family, and tho .liking seemed mutual ; tho elders of both houses making out many common friends. So in. a short time we became very intimate ; hardly a day passed ?without our meeting ; and when my brother George came home, it continued just tho same. George was then thirty— tall , irith grey -. ejes, straight well-cut , features, golden brown bwr/ana w'hlskers— iri short, a very nico-loolang young fellow ; and very proud we were of him. The Mastortons had a party of gentlemen staying with them for shooting, ana George, being a groat sportsman, was at Holmo Park .-,.,- Jt/^9'?l-i,^ftKo- too.Jpng/,tQ.tollyou,liow^-3oqrge. '';.?'?
