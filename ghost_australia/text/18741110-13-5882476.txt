THE MAYORS INAUGURAL DINNER. The inaugural dinner given by the new mayor (Councillor Gatehouse), in celebration of his entering upon his term of office, was held last night in the Town-hall About 400 guests, comprising a large number of the most influential citizens of Melbourne, were present. Upon the right of the mayor were His Excellency the Governor, the Attorney-General, his Honour Mr Justice Fellows, the Hon W H F. Mitchell (President of the Legislative Council), Sir John O'Shanassy, the Treasurer, the Postmaster General, and a number of other gentlemen and upon his left were the late mayor (Councillor M H wraith), his Honour Mr Justice Barry (acting chief justice), his Honour Mr Justice Stephen the Hon. Captain M Mahon (Speaker of the Legislative Assembly), and the vice chancellor of the University (Dr. Brownless) Several members of the consular body were present. A band, under the direction of Mr B. Levy, played a number of selections during the evening After the usual interval, the toasts of the Queen, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and other members of the Royal family, were drunk with enthusiasm The Mayor then proposed the toast of "His Excellency the Governor." He remarked that he was sure the toast was one which would be well received, for Sir George Bowen during his term of office in this colony had rendered himself popular wherever he had visited He was a distinguished scholar and had a reputation alike for scholar- ship and good fellowship (Hear, hear ) On the occasion of the last mayoral banquet His Excellency had suggested the institution of a metropolitan board of works, and a practical result had been given to his recommendation Sir George Bowen was about to pay a visit to the old country from which he had been absent for 21 years, V> of which he had spent in Australia, so that his holiday could not be considered as other than well earned (Hear, hear.) The toast was drunk with enthusiasm Sir George Bowen, who was received with great applause, said Mr Mayor and Gentle- men I am sincerely grateful for the very kind and flattering terms, only too kind and flattering in which my health has just been proposed by his worship the mayor, and also for the enthusiastic manner in which the toast has been received by all present There has always been the most per feet harmony, and most cordial and mutual respect and esteem between the successive Governors of Victoria, as the representatives of the Queen, and the successive mayors of Melbourne, as the representatives of the inhabitants of this great city. (Hear, hear) Individual governors and mayors must pass away, like all things human, but I am sure all will agree with me that it is most desirable that those friendly relations to which I have alluded between the respective offices should endure for ever, and, indeed, should grow with the growth and strengthen with the strength of Melbourne (Applause ) I will not detain you with a long speech this evening. The mayor has just alluded to the fact that I made a long speech last year, and he also mentioned that, after 21 years' absence from the old country, I had obtained six months leave for the purpose of paying a visit there in order to bring back my wife and family. I am determined to be back in time for the mayor's dinner next year But I am afraid that if I made too long a speech on this occasion that you would rather wish that I stayed away a little longer ("No ) Besides, I confess that with regard to after dinner speeches generally I am inclined to the opinion of an old friend of my family an Irish bishop who once said to me, in the days of my youth, " My young friend beware of orations after dinner After dinner, men, to use the words of the apostle, see through a glass darkly " (Laughter ) We have met here to celebrate in our truly British and national manner, by a good dinner, the accession to his high office of the new mayor of Melbourne I am sure you will all agree with me in heartily con- gratulating him, in the confident hope and belief that he will equal, for few men could excel the dignity and hospitality with which his predecessor, Councillor M'Ilwraith, filled the high duties of his office (Hear, hear ) Within my own personal knowledge I am aware that the hospitality and courtesy exhibited by the late mayor were highly appreciated both by Commodore Goodenough and the officers of our own navy, and also by the officers of foreign vessels, and by all the distinguished visitors who have come to Melbourne during the past year. (Hear, hear I am sure from the sample we have had of the hospitality of the new mayor to day, that we may be quite certain that he will tread in the same footsteps He referred also with great satisfaction to the endeavour to establish a metropolitan board of works in Melbourne, and was kind enough to attribute to the suggestion made by me last year some portion of the praise due to the initiation of that work I certainly did express a hope last year that as Alderman O Grady had initiated Hospital Sunday, so Councillor M Ilwrnth would mark his term of office by the man non of a metropolitan board of works I know from my conversation with our new mayor, that you will find in him an able champion of sanitary reform The time has fully come, I believe, for energetic action in this most important matter I see from the last return furnished by the Government statist, that Melbourne and the suburbs now contain 233 000 inhabitants It is already, therefore, the eighth city of the British empire, though, as all of you Know, not 40 years have elapsed since the first white man set his foot here, and many present may remember having seen the blacks dance their wild corroborees on the very spot on which this fine town hall now stands You may ask, why enlarge on this topic, which must be familiar to most present I will tell you why in a very few words It is not only because of the well known and characteristic modesty of the people of Victoria in general, and of the city of Melbourne in particular (laughter), which leads them to hide their light under a bushel that I now refer to this fact, but my real motive is this that I deem it my duty to impress upon you, with all the authority of the office which I hold, that the great prosperity and progress which Melbourne enjoys entail with them very heavy responsibilities upon the citizens of Melbourne, and upon the members of the City Council and of the various suburban municipalities I think that all should strive, not only to make Melbourne-what indeed, it is already -the commercial metropolis, the London so to speak, of the Southern Hemisphere but also to make it the pleasing capital the Pans of the South When the French ambassador in England said to Lord Palmerston, " Paris is the capital of Europe," what was the rejoinder of the English states man ' " Yes," said Lord Palmerston, " Fans may be the capital of Europe, but London is the capital of the world " So I say that you should not only make Melbourne the London but the Paris of the Southern world-not only the commercial metropolis but the most healthy, the most pleasurable, and most be in tiful place to which people can come from all the neighbouring colonies (Hear, hear ) I am speaking as a thoroughly practical man, and all practical men know that holiday making and pleasure seeking of course in moderation, are very good for trade It would be difficult to estimate how large a sum will flow into the pockets of Melbourne tradesmen and artisans by the large influx of visitors from the country districts and the adjoining colonies during the past holiday week The may oratory his hospitality tonight must have contributed very largely to one important branch of trade I am afraid, however, that were I to continue my remarks much longer, the ghost of my old friend the Irish bishop would arise, like the ghost of Banquo to Macbeth, and bid me remember his warning. I will only in conclusion, propose the toast of " Prosperity to the city of Melbourne, coupled with the health of his Worship the Mayor " The Mayor, in responding, said he attributed the prosperity of Melbourne to its geographical position and to the pluck and intelligence of its inhabitants It was nothing more than the adaptability of the inhabitants to utilise what was here that had made Melbourne what it was, and had the legislature of the country entrusted the City Council with those powers with which they were entitled to be entrusted, to deal with the river channel, the harbour.andothermetropolitan requirements, the council would have brought the question of the sanitary reform of Melbourne to a satisfactory conclusion. With respect to himself, he had been a quarter of a century here, and now found himself mayor of the city - nothing more than any man might become in three years It was nothing more than an accident, and he would be glad to see many of the numerous men who had been much more benefited by their residence more than himself, but had neglected to do that for the city in which they had been enriched that they ought to have done, take a more active part in municipal matters (Applause ) He then briefly proposed "Her Majesty s Ministers in Victoria." Mr. KrniLitD,in responding, said, although politics were excluded on occasions of this kind, he could assure them that he and his colleagues, who happened for the time being to be Minister of the Crown, endeavoured to discharge their duties with honesty and ability, and a great deal could be done from that point of view. One of the most important duties the Executive of this country had to undertake was the pushing on of railways and other public works, and he know of nothing which would tend so much to our prosperity as their construction. His Excellency had alluded to the question of sanitary reform, and he hoped his worthy friend the mayor, and the council associated with him, would go in for it with all their hearts The establishment of a metropolitan board of works would do much in this direction With regard to harbour improvement a great deal had yet to be done by the Legislature, and he was sure when the matter was ripe for settlement it would be dealt with by the Parliament of Victoria in a liberal and comprehensive spirit (Applause ) Alderman Baines proposed, ' Their Honours the Judges " Sir Redmond Barry, who was received with prolonged applause, said that during the many years in which he had received the gracious hospitality of the mayors of Melbourne it had been his pleasure to return thanks for the Chief Justice and his brother judges Of those who had preceded his present colleagues he would not speak at length One was to return to them to fulfil his distinguished career, another had departed from them to his extreme regret, Mr. Justice Williams-(applause)-who for many years fulfilled with such ability the extremely important duties which he was called on to perform, and who had left an undying reputation for integrity and honour He (Sir Redmond Barry had now to fulfil his duties in connexion with two gentlemen who not only in their profession at the bar, but in their statesmanlike conduct in the Parliament, had made themselves thoroughly known to every individual in the state and long before their accession to the Bench must have established themselves and their reputations in places of confidence with the entire country Owing to their able assistance, he thought when the Chief Justice returned he should have the gratification of being able to say that the public had not suffered during his absence Cheers ) Mr. Justice Fellows who was loudly called for, said that he thought whilst they were cheering his friend Sir Redmond Barry not that it could be applied to them that there was no such fleeting thing as popular applause He had witnessed the time when he was hooted from one end of Collins street to the other (laughter and applause) but it seemed now that the decision of the public-to use a professional expression had been reversed (Laughter ) The reflec- tion caused him to make the suggestion that the Legislature of this colony had acted wisely in establishing the independence of the judges (Laughter and applause.) There was no doubt much to be apprehended on either side too much flattery on the one hand, and too much abuse on the other-but he could assure them most solemnly that if the occasion should arise which he trusted it would not-that he would show himself as utterly indifferent to one as to the other (Cheers ) Mr. Justice Stephen, who was also called on, observed that he felt all he could say was "I concur, which was the usual language of the third judge on the Bench when an able judgment was given by his predecessors He felt deeply grateful for the way Sir Redmond Barry had referred to him, and he felt the deepest gratitude to him for the assistance and encouragement he had given him during the last six months (Applause ). The Town Clerk, Mr rmGinnov proposed the toast of The Consuls his official duties had often brought him into contact with these gentlemen and he was sure all who had business with them would acknowledge the courtesy and consideration which they evinced in the discharge of their important functions Mr Abamsov, United States consul responded, and acknowledged the kindness with which the toast had been received He trusted that the present cordial relations which happily existed between the British empire and other countries would long continue, and that the prosperity and progress of this colony would advance unimpeded As the representatives of other nations the consuls did not feel any jealousy in watching the strides which the commerce of the colony was making for they felt assured that by the products of their countries being introduced here they, too, would benefit France would supply the silks of Lyons for the ladies and the finest wines of champagne for the gentlemen and for the children the wools of Berlin would be required from Spain would come the olives, and Holland could afford a supply of square gin (Laughter ) Their American cousins would enlighten their steps with kerosene, and would provide for their women the sewing machines He again thanked them for the manner in which the toast had been received Councillor M live it was proposed the toast of the Parliament of Victoria ' Like the municipal councils, the Legislative Council and Assembly were not entirely perfect, but he believed they were improving, and the remedy lay in the hands of the people themselves by whom the representatives were returned The Hon W H F Mitchell President of the Legislative Council, and the non Capt M'Mmion, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly very briefly responded The M vi on. proposed the health of the late Major It was impossible for him to express the exalted opinion he had of him and of the exemplary manner in which he had discharged the duties of his office for the past 3 ear If during the coming year he (the major) could only win some small portion of the praise Mr M Ilwraith was entitled to he should consider he had done well (Applause ) Councillor MIlwkvitu, who was greeted with loud cheers, said he did not think he deserved all the mayor had said of him During his term of office he had done the best he could to fulfil the duties pertaining to it, but he thought any man who used his own judgment, and with honesty of purpose could perfectly well perform them, and he had every confidence that his successor would be able to do so (Applause ) Councillor Mount va proposed "The Press, to which Mr Hugh Glokgl responded Councillor M live it and gave The officers of the Corporation and the Town Cr mil. returned thanks Alderman O Gavin proposed "The Ladies,' which was responded to by Mr. J. T. Smith, and the gathering then separated.
