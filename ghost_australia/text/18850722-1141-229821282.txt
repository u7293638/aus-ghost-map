V.B.c. GBA.1TD NATIONAL meeting. The annual winter gathering of tho Vio- toria Baaing Cinb oame off on Saturday last. The weather for some weeks past baa been the reverse of pleasant for raoing purposes, 4infc aatIv last week it oleared up. and there was every promise of a good, dry, springy course. Unfortunately, the rain desoended again on Friday night, and made the course heavy. It also had the effeot of limiting the BttendMM, bat a very nupBOtatte i oonoonrie of people, inolnding his Excellency the Governor and anile, put in an appearanoe, and they were rewarded with a good day e apart. Mr. Moore had made the reserves as attractive as possible, and during the after noon selections of music were played by the Australian military band, under the leader ship of Mr. Zelm&n.; Sport, as usual, opened with the Maidon Hurdle Race, for which a good field of fourteen started. Raven was heavily supported, and saw the shorteat price, bnt Hippogriff had a large number of admirers, whilst Insolvent, Duration, and Oonlist were not without friends. Eobo and Oculist alternately made the run ning, but at the home turn Hippogriff settled the obanoes of the lot, and won easily. The favourite, who finished fifth, only once looked dangerous. The Maiden Steeplechase followed, and attracted the moderate field of seven. Belioeot, who had been the favourite for some days past, continued so until the last. The race is easily described, as Lady Ajhton made the runoing at a great pace until approaching the home turn, where she tired, and the favourite passing her, won easily by a dozen lengths. The first of the two big erents of the meeting — the Grand National Hurdle Race — followed. Ten started, Sheet Anchor being the faronrite at 6 to 4, whilst The Agent, who wu freely taken in doubles, started at 4 to 1. Hants- man, GuardBsh, and Star had a fair share of support. Gu&rdGeh; led almost from the start, but the pace told on bim at the finish, aod he, although he finished very gamely, had not the brilliant run left in him like 1 The Agent, who won by a couple of lengths. The favourite was never dangerous, but he wos considerably put out by Omadhaun's fall. A few mishaps occurred, bat the only serious iojury was sustained by Oroker, the rider of Tantaliaer, who had to be taken to the hospital Buffering from conouasion of the brain. The Grand National Steeplechase followed, and brooght out the respectable field of fourteen. The saoceasaa of Bead caused Governor to be tho favourite at 4 to 1, but Morven had a very consistent support at 6 to 1, whilst Wymlet, Sailor, and Denmark had plenty of friebde. Native and Denmark made the moat of the running, but the former oame to grief at tho last fence, leav ing the top weight with the lead. The weight, however, told on him, and he could not pace with Wymlet, who, onoe over the iampe, had it all his own way and won easily. The spills wore numerous. Granville was the first to come to grief. Lib example being followed by Mtrader, Moonlight, Morven, Leo, Progress, and Native. Some of the apills were very nasty ones, Malone beiog zauoh shaken, and M'lyor bad his collar- booo broken. Leo received suoh severe injuries that he had to be destroyed. But little interest was taken in the Selling Hurdle Raoe, for which Flamborougb, with Gerri- gan np, was a hot favourite, but Student easily disposed of bim at tbe finish. The winner was bought iD for 140 guineas. The day's sport wound up with the Flat Raoe, for which Favour, Gardenia, and Fernlea wore heavily supported, but the winner turned op in The Ghost after a grand finish with Plausible.
