VICTORIA TTAT.T. The bioscope entertainments being given each night this week by Mr. E. H. Steven ion at the Victoria Hall hare been ihe sub iects of favourable criticism, and bhe eene ral opinion is that no better performances of the kind have been seen in the city. For two hours there is not the slightest flagging of interest. No fewer than 33 dina-eot films of moving pictures are shown, irajlÂ£t over 100 view* of 'various places of interest are described 'by Mr. Stevenson, who acts in the dual role ot lanternist and lecturer. Whilst all the bioscope pictures are especially good, and the flickering effect is absent, there are twv- which call lor special comment. That of the astronomer's dream, which is 300 ft. long, is a remarkable film, and being beauti fully coloured it produces a fine effect. Rider Haggard's 'she,' the pillar of fire, is also exquisitely tinted, and is enthu siastically received each evening. The longest film shown this week was 350 ft. in length and represented the employes of Messrs. Caiman & Sans, Norwich, to the number of 3,000, leaving work; bin Mr. Stevenson will to-night show ?'Cinderella,' a film no less than -MX) ft. lowi. 'Photo- graphing a Ghost' is an interesting and amusing picture, and other films include several train effects, ''The MUier and the Sweep,' war scenes, and various beautiful sea views. Mr. Virgo has mode arrange ments with Mr. Stevenson to remain till the close of the week, and three more en tertainments will be given, A change of programme is announced for this evening.
