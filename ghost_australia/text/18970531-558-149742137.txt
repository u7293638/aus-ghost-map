POPULATION OF VICTORIA. QUARTERLY RETURN. A return prepared by the Assistant Government (Statist, and published in Friday night's " Gazette," gives the estimated population of Victoria on 31st March as 1,109,807, comprising 590,910 males and 578,897 females. The births registered duriug the quarter numbered 7651, and the deaths 3673 ; the former having exceeded the latter by 397S, or 108 per cent. The recorded arrivals by sea numbered 25,59S, but the recorded departures by sea, together with and allowance for unrecorded depar tures (viz., 2793), numbered 31,057, re sulting in a loss to the colony by emi gration of 9059. This loss was greater than in the corrosrionding quarter of 1S9G by 1397, of 1895 by 1722, of 1891 by 3-129, and of 1893 by 50S1. Deducting the natural increase, viz., 397S, from the loss by emigration, there results a net decrease of population during the quarter amounting to 50S1, consisting of 5058 males and 23 females as shown in the table. Such a loss of population occur red on only live previous oc casions sinco the census, "'viz., one of 1862 in the first quarter of '1891, 71 in the first quartor of 1S95, -1010 in the first quarter of 1S96, and 297 and 25S5 respectively in the two subsequent quarters. The records of migration for the quarter show a balance in favor of immigrants of 3S11 from New South "Wales, 1212 from Tasmania, and 131 from foreign ports ; but a balance in favor of emigrants of 9235 to West Aus tralia, 1151 to the United Kingdom, 119 to South Seas, 3-15 to South Africa, 239 to New Zealand, 63 to Queensland, and 1 to South Australia. The net emigration to West Australia, viz., 9235—resulting from a total emigration of 13,300, less a total immigration of 1065—was lower by 527 than in thoxorresponding quarter of 1S96, when it was at a maximum ; whilst between the samo periods the next emi gration to South Africa fell off from 421" to 3i5. As previously pointed out in these returns, such emigrations may be regarded as the movement of population to the countries referred to, not only from Victorin, but from the whole of eastern Australasia. . Here is a story of Titiens, who always carried about a lot of superfluous lug gage and stage dresses which she neyer wore. " She always took a room at the hotel for exclusive use as a yarde-robe," says Signor Arditti in ■ his " " Ke miniscences," " and one of the gentloinen —I believe it was Willert Beale— obtained access to this apartment during her absence one day and promptly stuffed out all tho dresses, put heads with wigs,:; and pairitod faces on to the shoulders, and seated tho figures on chairs—there were 12 or 14—in a dim religious light around the rooms. Need 1 say:more: Titiens, on her return home, wanted to change her dress, and she proceeded to this room. A minute later she ciimo shrieking down the stairs, having been frightened out of her wits at the;strange Bight that met her; gaze. She thought she must' bayo suddeuly gone mad, and that the ghosts of ber different;; imper sonations had appeared to torture her.".
