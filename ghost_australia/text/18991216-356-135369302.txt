Servain had listened to.his nephew with.a preoccupied air. "She's still the same," lie said, talk ingi to himself, wihen Felix lid finislied his story ; " thoughtless, wilful, in perious, recognising no otlier law than that of her own good pleasure, and no other "rsiles thani her caprices. Like thlle savages that Monutesquieu talks abouti she would cut down the tree to get the fruit. 'What a pity !" The 'twso iimein"remained silent for a few minuites ; siildenly .it the end of -thel pltlh they weie followin'g, .they saw a" light which "was coming towards them.

THES "ATTACK ON 'Ti'E ) l ii IG'ENCE. i The next morning, before the break fast bell. rangi, Monsieur Irerbelin, whom the rain had prevented from taking Ihis daily walk in the park, was sittinig in his bedroom, trying to con sole hIilrself for tihe bad' weather by smoking a : long meerschaunm pipe. Two or three juick ta.ps at the dooir intcrrlupted this. agreeable occupation, and caused the colonel to jump up with the air of a trualnt schoolboy. With out takling tihe time to put' his pipe q.t lihe hill it iii one of the drawers of Ins desk, and then went to open tlhe door, outside of whliicih hle saw his daunghter, who was wearing a coquet tish molrning costnume. - , "I thought as imuch," said Madame Caussade; who began by opening :.the xvindows to let out tlhe smoke wliicl filled tle room ; "will you never cure :yourself of that horrid habit ? You deserve to be put under arrest." ' .:" Under arrest for smolking a poor little eigai- !" replied the colonel in the submissive voice, usual with fathers who: spoil theii children. " A cigar ! do you think I don't re coginise your horrid 'cmaporal ' tobacco? Tsn't, that: the name of the poiSonoulS stufl' ? Hut take care, if ever I lialage to lay liands on your, pipe." ' Witlh i. sxwift movemnnt 'Monsieur Iterbeliii took' the key out of tile drawer where the guilty pipie was hid den,.and sliplped it into his pocket. "Come, Estelle, .don't scold me." he said in. n. coaxing voice; "'T promise I ,will only ruse Monsieur Toniiayrion's cigars in future ; you can stand those ; so lct.me ofl' mly punishlment lnd come alnd iiss me." "I'll kiss you when you liv've off smoking," replied M[adame Caussade, with pouting pettishnesswhlicl, praic tised 10pon11 anyone but a. fai.ther.' would have appeared like flirting. " As you please, madame," replied the good colonel pretending to be vexed ; " but I don't suppose you caLme here solely to read me i lecture. May 1: nsk to what I owe the honour of your visit ?" : CITAPTEII TI.--(Continued.) ' . "I was going' to tell you" sa.id ]Estelle, heri charming face growing serious ; " T came to say good-bye." " What, is this nonsense !" intcrrupt edi Monsieur ITe.rbelin, looking at hlis dauiglit'er in astonishment. [Madanme Causslade took ail chair and wenti and sat down at her fateher's side. On seeing" this mnoouvreL-the usual iprelude to conlfidentiaul conversation tho hitter beenaum ierious in his turn and silently awshited -his daughliter's ex planattion. "TI will only ask your allentiohn for five minutes, father,' said .Estelle. " Eigfhteen months ago-when I became l 'widowx, man wlhoI- yo011 kiinew veryI' well and who had been very intimate witll my husband proposed to me." ' ".\Vithout my' knowledge ?" iluter rupltd tlihe colonel abruptly. t "Without :yoior klnowxledge .

" A great deal might be saiid about Se.rvinn's behaviour on this occasionl, and I nam certain that if you were not p'lejdicied against himn you wonuld see things in quite a different light. You see, a distinction must be malde betuween couralge and rashness. It is not givesn to everyone to keep Ihis head inl thle presesnce of a troop of high iwlnymsen who have e\very sort of advan inlge over a- mansl.

"You, fallhen !" cried iMadame Cans side, fixing her glistening eyes on the colonel. "If yo lu hd been there you would have takcen one of the pistols in your riglit huand and the other in yo'ur left; I can see you nlow. You would nhave blown out the brains .of .the first scoundrel who showed him self at tlhe door ; the others would have fled, and then away you would have galloped." " It's possible, I might htixe been foolish enough to do. it," replied the colonel, whos could not' help. smiling with satisfaction ; " but you must re member that Servinn is not, 'like ale, ilccestoImed to flreurnlis ; lie his never sersed in the 'army ; the only shots tlit lie has ever had occasion. to fire-" "Please dos't try to make excuses for hini,': interruptedc Estelle impatiently.
