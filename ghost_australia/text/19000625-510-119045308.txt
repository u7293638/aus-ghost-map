A SPECTRE HAND. The ghosts which are said to frequent the precincts of Hampton Court Palace are more or less known by reputation, but their ramblings have been promiscu us and uncer- tain. Great interest in their move- ment has, however, been newly aroused by the strange experience undergone by an artist who, during the month of May, has been visiting certain rooms of the palace for the purpese of sketching the old Glemish tapestry on the walls Whilst engaged in the Guard Watching Chamber in broad day- light—for the room is closed to the public at six o'clock—this gentle- man, Mr. Haynes, of Surbiton, positively asserts that a spectre hand, white and delicate and richly jewelled, has persistently intruded between him and the tapestry. At first he imagined the disturbing element must be one of the many hands so beautifully inscribed on the tapestry, but the limb, he says, moved slowly from one stage to another, and pointed downwards. Mr. Haynes was much agitated, and told several friends of this curious visitation. They, not un- naturally perhaps, advised him to dismiss the subject from his mind and return to the chamber and his work. But the hand reappeared before his startled eyes; and on the last appearance of the phantom the artist made a hurried sketch of the outstretched hand, the rough outline of which depicts a brilliant marquise ring on the forefinger. The effect of these continued visits of the supernatural on Mr. Haynes is very visible; he is unnerved, and he has suspended his sketching. These are the plain facts, but there is, it would seem, a weird and his- toric connection between this hand and the hand of the Queen Cathe- rine Howard, one of the wives of King Henry VIII.
