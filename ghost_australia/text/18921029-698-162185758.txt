Silvery Hippies, I tbmk we often bring the clouds That float around m shadows, And they, like ghosts revived, in shrouds Of memories enwrap us ; As daily down our path we onward wend, Ivor see the smiling sunbeams round us spend Their silvery ripples. I know that as through Life we tread, Engrossed in care and Borrow, We miss the brightness overhead, And seldom think to-morrow Could ever steal the darlings playing round, Could ever hush that laughing, merry sound Of silvery ripples. The summer shadows floating o'er, WLere the sand and waters meet, Enrich the beauty of the shore, And the wavelets at our feet; I'm sure that if we would more careful be, The rippling tide would bring to thee and me More silvery ripples. a g. b.
