ATHLETICS. A correspondent from Booleroo Centre has favored us with a list of awards for the Booleroo Centre Handicap to be run for on Easter Monday. This is the first intimation o! the hold ng or the sports made m this neighbourhood, and although the nomin ations are already large, we feel sure that had more extensive notice been given the list would have been greatly increased. Twenty-two have been dwelt with by the handicap-tiers, who are Messrs James Miller, P. H. Williams, and It. Bates, but from what we know of the gentlemen named'they certaiuly are novices in the art of handicap ping. Neither do we believe that the gentlemen lay claim to know even a little about it, and if they do their production is direct evidence to 'he contrary. As will be seen below the post of honor for the short distances is given to G. and W. Arthur. What these men have done that they should be so harshly treated is a mystery, and the odds are a pony to a monkey about either, even securing a place, or f:-r that matter facing the starter. Miller cannot catch either Slia non or McDona'd in the first event, and in this the latter two have nothing to complain, and should fill the positions with Ey, but after this there is a mixture, for neither Laottrff, Bambrick, Corney, McKenzie, Hobbs, Hocking, and others have a ghost of a chance for the first flutter, and will be chasing the shadaws of their fleeter brethern, when half the distance has been travelled. McD-mald is treated rather peculiarly. He has 5 yards in 150 yards from G. Arthur, and 3 yards in 250 yards ; now it must present itself to any unbiassed mind that if a person can beat another with a 3 yard start in 250 yards, his success is certain with a five yard start in 150 yards. However we will have a further opportunity or tipping the probable winners when the acceptances close, and we hope to see a long list of acceptors in spite of the erratic awards of the handieappers. The distances arc 150, 250 and 350 yards, and the nominators a'e : â€” G. Arthur, scr., ser., 4 ; W. Arthur, ser., 2, 4; G. Milier, 2,4, 6; M, Shannon, 3, 6, 9; D. McDonald, 5, 3, scr.; E. Lattorff, 5, 9, 14; T. Corney, 6, 11, 15; G. McKenzie, 6, 11,15; H. Bambrick, 7. 11, 16; S, Hobbs, 7, 10, 13; C. Stiitley, 8, 11, 15; F. W. Ey, S. 11. 16; 11. W. Lamb, 8, 13, 17; G. M. Hot kinu, 8, 13, 17; A Letts, 8, 13, 17; C. Brown, 9, 12, 17 ; W. Crew, 9, 13, 18; J. Hobbs 9. 12. 15; J. Guider, 9, 13, 17; J. Hicks, 10, 16. 25; S. Bennett, 10, 16 24; O. Horan, 10, 16, 24. In another column will be found the handicaps declared for the Gladstone Handi cap, and Hurdles, in connection with the Oddfellows and Foresters picnic and sports, to lie held on Easter Monday. It is to be regretted that the nominations are so few, for the prize-money offered is certainly deserving of larger fields. However those competing will have greater chance of success, and they will not be able to complain of illiberality on the part of the handicapper, for the starts given are certainly as much as anyone can reasonably expect. We expect to see every man face the starter, and good contests among the few.
