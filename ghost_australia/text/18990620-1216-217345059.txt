MINING NEWS. Cosgrove's Cleaning-up operations will commence at Cosgrove's Bayley's Sonth to-day. South Ealgurli The drive north on the western lode in the S-uth Kalgnrli shows values, to be steadily improving. About 120ft farther has to be traversed before the Hainault boundary is reached. Oroya Sulphide ore worth 7oz to the ton is being bigged from the workings at the 200ft level in the south block of the Oroya. So far about 60 tons of this quality of stone have been bagged, and negotiations are now pending for the shipment of the parcel to the smelters. Boyal Mint Sonth The western crosscut at the 300ft level in the Boyal Mint South has been run in about 70ft from the shaft. Progress is slow on account of the mine not being fully manned. Aboht another 50ft of driving haB to te done before the point will be reached where the anticipated continuation of the Imperial Bonlder lode will be picked np. Soulder Main Beef The drive north on the main eastern lode at the 500ft level in the Boulder Main Beef has been carried about 150ft along -towards where the formation is expected. Providing no unfavorable development oceurs in the meanwhile, the rich chute of ore met with in the upper levels will be reached in a few days. The crosscut west from this drive, which is being znn in to intersect the continuation of the Chaffer's eastern lode, has been driven 26ft. Euro The crushing from the Euro mine, British Flag^ ths result of which appears in another column, is more than satisfactory. The stone treated came from the 150ft drive at 50ft, and represented a fair sample of the reef at that level. The previous return, declared last month, was 95 tons, yielding 201oz. The Euro is one of the properties over which an option has recently been taken by Mr G. W. Hall, on behalf of the London and Westralian Mines and Finance Agency. Imperial Boulder The main shaft of the Imperial Boulder is being drained of water preparatory to resuming sinking operations. It is intended to carry down the pit from the present depth (325ft)'to 500ft, when after a 12ft well has been sunk a plat will be cut and a crosscut run in to the east to intersect the low grade sulphide lode opened up at the 260ft level, which it is thought will show an improvement in value at depth. The work of sinking the shaft will occupy about five moaths. CrosEcutting, -however, should be in progress about three months hence. The Ivanhoe Interviewed to-day the manager, of the Ivanhoe stated that the reported development in the east crosscut at the 500ft level was incorrect. A rich strike, however, had been made in the crosscut 4ft west of the shaft at the 400ft level, where two drills pierced an ore body for a distance of 6ft. The points are still in lode stuff, and borings from one of the drills assayed 3oi 5dwt, and *rom the other a return of 4oz 2dwt has been Obtained. No less than five other importantdevelopments are on the tapis in the lower levels of this mine. At the 400ft level crosscutting is proceeding to tap the middle and eastern lodes, and at the 500ft level the work of driving east and west TO pick up the above veins, and west to intersect the western lode, will shortly be in active operation.

Out of this it is proposed to writeoff £1,692, the adverse balance to December, 1897, carrying forward £10,832. This profit has been made with the old 10 stamps. Over £10,000 has been expended during the past year in providing a 20-Btamp battery and other machinery, the cost of which has been defrayed from the earnings of the mine, and it is proposed this year to add another 20 btamps, which will replace the old 10 head and make a total of 40 stamps. During 1898 6,631 tons of ore was treated for 6,'343oz of gold, bringing the total output to date up t» 10,819oz. The cost of mining and milling with the old balterv was about 25s, but since the starting of the new stamps ibis haB been reduced to about 20s. The company has also a valuable asset in its tailings reserve of 14,000 tons, which average about 8dwt per ton, and ou which a cyanide plant capable of treatin? 110 tons a day will start at the beginning of next month. g t P H . and B Junction A start has been made to drain the water from the nmn shaft of the Ivanhoe and Boulder Junction lease. As soon as the pit is dry it is intended to start sinking from the present depth of 50ft to 70ft, where a crosscut will be put in to tap the quartz lode passed through in the prospectors' shaft at a depth of 55ft. Sons of Gwalia The shareholders of the Sons of Gwalia Mine have every reason to be satisfied with the profit of £30,000, which has been made during the past 13 months; at the same time they will, in view of the heavy liability which has been incurred in-connection with the new plant and machinery designed for the mine by the consulting engineers, the total expenditure on which will probably be between £50,000 arid £60,000, practically the whole of which still remains to be discharged, endorse the prudent policy of the directors in not advising any division of the profits of the past year, but to husband the resources of the company in every way possible until the heavy initial expenditure necessary for the proper working of the mine has been more fully provided for, and the future revenue of the mine assured. When the new machinery has been got into working order, then the mine, judging from its proved richness, ought soon to be tnrning out ore in quantities sufficient to enable the board to make a sensible distribntion. < General Items The registered office of the Desirable Proprietary Gold Mines, Limited, ht-s been removed from Perth to the mine at Norseman. The State Mining. Bureau reports that the value of the total mineral production of California for 1898 was 27,180,070dol. In 1897 it was 25,142,441dol ; in 1896, 24,281,398dol; and in 1895, 22,844,664dol. The gold product is placed at 15,906,478dol, 1 a slight increase over 1S97. The Midas started crushing at the Mount Benson battery on Thursday. At least 100 tons will be put through. The ore is be'ng taken from the drives at the bottom of the winze, where the reef and formation give an average width of 3ft 6in. In the east drive a marked improvement has tsken place in the value of the ore. » Both the quarts and formation show gold freely. Despite internal troubles, mining is booming in Mexico. A correspondent forwards an extract from the speech of the President at the opening of Congress. In it he de clared that during the financial year with which he was dealing (1898) 1,040 title deeds had been issued, which covered between 11,000 and 12,000 hectares. One hectare equals 2,471 acres. He added that the Adventurer Tunnel, at Batopilas, had just struck the principal lodes of that district. According to the annual report of the assayer at Helena, Montana, the mineral production of that State for 1898 amounted to 253,868oz fine gold, valued at 5,247,912dol; 14 818,682oz silver, valued at 9,159,482dol; 216,979,354 fine pounds copper, valued at 26,102,616dol; and 21,403,592 fine poinds lead, valued at 809,055dol. As compared with 1897 a large gain is shown in the gold production and a falling off in silver and copper, the latter due to a big mine fire at Butte. The nineteenth century i3 providing u 1 with ('lenty of sensations before giving up the ghost. It seems now that we can have a highly successful colliery explosion in our own homes if . we cannot vary the tedium of life in any other way. One of Her Majesty's colliery inspectors has found it necessary to issue a warning to the colliery proprietors of his district on the subject of unexhausted sho's in the mines. One of theBe unex hausted shots was delivered in a piece of coal to a London householder, and when it was put in the grate and was ignited a first-clasi explosion followed. Possibly, being some distance from the coal-fields, we have not realised the horrors of a colliery explosion, but we do not require the horrors to be literally brought home to us in this way.
