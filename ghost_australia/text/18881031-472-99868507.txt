THEJPADED PHOTOGftJUPH. A picture looks at me throngh years Of thno j only a girlish head, Set in a frame of tawny hair, , With cheek and lips bo longer red, And sad sweet eyes, whence all the light And all the tenderness has fled. The pale face watches me through tears That are. my own ; those gentle eyes Have long since ceased to weep ; the lips Will no more part in sorrow 8 sighs j The broad calm of the faded brow Shines tn the glow of other skies. Ob, love, it is so long ago — The smart and sting of suffering Have yielded to the balm of time ,- Kind fate has joined the riven striug I deemed would have no music more, And thought* of thee no anguish bring. The flowers of many summers have BeeD bom and blown above thy tomb ; The fondest hearts forget to mourn The grief of a long-distant doom, AnS omy sorrow deep as mine, Can keep thy memory in bloom. Xuc wistful pictnre has not kept For me the beauties I recall, The charm of tender tones, aud hands That met iniue willingly, nor fall Of footstep blithely soft, no grace Of form, and free limbs lithe and tall. Nought but a ghost remains ; the glad Bright eyes of old are dimmed aud grey i The wraith of what was colouring and life Is seen in tresses where no ray Of youthful gold is left, and lips Whose joyous smiles have passed away. Dearest, from thee oh let me plead Forgiveness ; that the old fierce pain. Should ever have been cased, the old Wide void of misery again Been bridged by time, the silenced song Known cadence in another strain. The darkest hour must have some dawn Tlie weariest winter melt at lost To spring — one cannot always weep ; Thus do I lay thy picture past, A memory-sheaf from yesteryears Upon the quiet present cast. -—Australasian.
