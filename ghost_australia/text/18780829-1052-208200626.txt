After our eveiyday's f work, you may be sure we. were tired, enough ; but w.e were J every night disturbed in our rest by the clink, clink, clink \ of a pick, about fifty yards from our canvas home. This / confounded noise always commenced at midnight, and did I not cease until the break of day. One night we were \ determined to see who it was ; so we sallied forth in the ( bright moonlight, and saw a figure in a coarse red flannel ) shirt, high boots, and slouched hat, hard "at work by an \ old claim which had been deserted for many years. I was r chosen spokesman, to expostulate with this noisy digger; ) but when I was within twenty yards of him, I stood still, \ transfixed with horror, — for the'hvearer of the digger's / clothes \va,s no living iiMii, hut a liJieletoii !'' f " Uncle Ned 1" we a,ll pried,." how fearful." k " One night, our teni was visited by "a handsome, well- / to-do .looking man, of .about fifty" years of age, who f enquired for a digger of whom we knew nothing about.
