AMUSEMENTS. THE THEATRES.' Tho Theatre Royal, last night, contained as largo an audience aa it was possiblo to hring together within its walls, and aa audience, moreover, that appeared thoroughly to appreciate tho entertainment they had como to witness. Gilbert and Sullivan's oporu "H. M. S. Pinafore'" was sparkling!}'sung, and the immy humourous poiuts contained in it took with the audience immensely, while thu music olicited tho warmest approval. The same work will bo repeated to-night. Tho popularity of " Hermes and the AlcUymist," and tho amusing farce tho " lied Lion Inn; or, the "Missing Ghosts," at tho Victoria Theatro is still unabated, and a very fair number of spectators was present in that theatre to enjoy the en- tertainment last night. Both these pieces will be again produced to-night. Buckstone's old drama "Luke the Labourer," was reproduced ut tho Queen's Theatre last night with Mr. Emery in tho leading r√¥le. This represen- tation of that lugubrious character waa effective as a piece of acting, but uninteresting if viewed from any other standpoint. The other characters were allotted as hereto- fore, the only alterations of any contsoquence being decidedly for tho hotter. Mr. Lachlnu M'Gownn has joined this company, nnd appeared in the first piece as Michael, and in the secondas Sterling, and. performed both parts with commendable oiliciency. Tho "' Irish Immigrant," in which Mr. Fuvron is so extremely nmusing as Pat O'Brien, concluded tho programme. Tho attendance was not largo. Tho samo pieces will ba produced to-night again.
