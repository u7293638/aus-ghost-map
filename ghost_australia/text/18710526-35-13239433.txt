The question, as u presents itself to that eminent writer, is one of A National or a Standing Army and as British leaders are more apt to be influenced by facts and figures than by mere sentiment, he begins by placing a few startling data side by side In France before the present war, the Army Estimates for last year amounted in round numbers to £11,000 000 representing the total available effective strength of the army on a peace establishment The Army Estimates of Prussia at the same period amounted in round numbers to 17,000 000 representing a total available effective strength of 500 600 men time of peace the Army Estimates of England amounted at the 'arno pt ried to an average total of £11 000 000, repre senting a total available effective strength of 10 000 men The total annual cost of each German soldier was £29 of each French soldier, £11, of each Dug Irish soldier ClOO So much for relative cost, budget tot budget, and man for man Professor Cairnes then takes a survey of the leading types of military organ s ation presented by the principal countries of Europe He divides these into three categories, viz , standing minus (recruited by voluntary enlistment), as in 1 England national armies, is in Prussia and Sister fund names of a mixed kind as in 1 place in land, the Militia and A volunteers represent rather matt mail for reserves than actual reserves were, being thrown upon the labour market for recruits, and the solder s trade declining constantly in general estimation with the progress of industry and the growth of prosperity the Government is compelled repeatedly to raise its terms, and yet to obtain recruits from the lowest and least reputable classes of the community Huts the system becomes more and more costly, and the class of recruits tends more and more to deterioration A voluntary enlistment licecssuntcs long service, recruits expect a permanent location hence large force of effectives in the character of pensioners It results that the British army, as at present constituted, is the cost best in the world, and becomes more and more costly at each stage of social progress, and more and more a rosie apart from civil his but Prussia, where the foundation of the military force is not contract but status combines the bulk of the whole able to dud population The term of service is thirty-three years to the Trench five and the II gil h twelve-with a reserve strength in proportion of three to one to the active force in the time of peace The idea] ness of this establishment just hill the Lngh h estimate'-unses from its very nature and constitution There me no defectives the soldier returns to civil life and productive industry thus that economic waste and that social mischief (against which we are providing by Contagious Diseases., Act-), are altogether avoided It is true, as Professor Comes, with characteristic fairness and accuracy, remarks, that to the direct cost of such a force must be added the aggregate of private losses furn inadequate payment of the troops actually under arms but the fact remains that such an inn v must be a representation of the whole seem rain river in other words, ' essentially a national and pop star army If indeed the Prussian army, owing to the immense force kept on foot in peace time, possesses not a few of the attributes of a stand n g; anna, and appears to be capable of acting as a powerful sister event of aggression, it is not the wide popular basis but the aristocratic organisation of the high cr junks that creates this danger, and the source of the danger is to be sought less in the military system than in the political constitution of the State As Professor Cairnes goes on to say " the remedy lies, not in abandoning the popular organisation of the soil but in bringing the government under Parliamentary control DiAvtoM) Titian or SouTH AvuicA -Accounts come home by every mail of a wonderful diamonds that have been picked up, and the temptation to go out, on the chance of finding one worth some £1000 lying about "view here, is very strong Pniel, the locality where the disease as are found, is about eight hundred miles from Cape Town, and tnuusU at ,. fmK between three and four hundred from Natal, the shorter sea voyage to the former port seems to make it the most popular of the various way s of getting to Parel From Cape Town, there are nearly a hundred miles of rail, and after this the adventurer has about thirty days of bullock-waggon, up the country, before he gets to his destination Of course, it is possible to got over the ground in less time by and of horses and of light cart, but the well-known Cape waggon is the usual means of convex once adopted, and tins one the emigrant is pretty certain to have to use Armed at the diggings, the work is very hard True, diamonds are occasionally picked up in the most accidental manner It is said that one man on his first annual clearing a place for his fire, turned up a stone of five carats xv north on the spot from fifteen to twenty pounds, but in the long run the only manner in which they can he found in sufficient quantity to repay the trouble and expense of the search is by systematic and regular work The usual way of setting to work is much as follows A done is marked out, the top gravel and earth (amongst which the diamonds are mostly found is dug out and heaped up ; the larger stones BTc raked off, and the remainder put through a sieve, by which the sand is got rid of The next pro- tests is that of vi asking for though, where water is scarce, dry sifting is had recourse to, this is a very laborious and tedious process, inasmuch as all the earth has to be carefully rubbed through a sieve with the hand until only the pebbles remain The wash- ing takes place in a circle with two sieves, the top one having holes about half on inch in diameter the lew cr much smaller holes, which would not permit a dinner el to pass After a thorough washing, the residue that remains between the two sieves is emptied on to a table and examined This examination is the most laborious process of all, the earth or Hiller the pebbles, for the w slung has cleared away every thing else is taken up a shovelful at a time thrown on a table, and looked at Practice enables the diggers to do this with great rapidity for even amongst the garnets and other dear pebbles amongst which the diamond lies the brightness of these latter is so remarkable, that they catch the eye at once , still it is a dull and tedious work, even though each movement of the scraper may show a stone sufficient to repay all the toil and labour the long journey has my oh ed This sort of work goes on from morning to night, except on Sunday, which is, by common consent, a day' of rest As to the question whether it really pays" there Skeat doUbt On the whole, it seems a lottery , some men make a fortune, others do nothing Perhaps for those who have everything to gain, and nothing to lose, diamond digging may be a hue thing, if only they can get to the place, but lessening more than risky for anybody else It is a curious question also as to the effect the increased number of diamonds will have on the market For years diamonds have been steadily increasing in value, especially since the discovery of gold in California and Australia, now it seems not impossible they may rather fall in public estimation There are however, several uses to which diamond is put in the arts, the latest being that of tipping boring tools for the Mont Cenis tunnel, and the cheaper this precious stone gets the more useful it will probably become At all events, it seems impossible that our dowagers diamonds should not fall a little in value, however little their owners may like the prospect 'for PAWS PIGEON POST SYSTEM -The correspondent of the Daily Telegraph at Paris gives the following interesting item with reference to the pigeon post -'I was much interested yesterday in an explanation of the pigeon system kindly given to me at the Central Telegraph Office The microscopic telegrams sent from louis were at first printed on the paper by the ordinary system of photographic reduction ; but the paper was too heavy-a pigeon could carry only feel the little sheets, though they measure no more than three inches long and two inches broad. To get over this difficulty the despatches were photographed on pieces of collection of the same size as the paper, each little bit containing thirty columns, and a roaring 20,000 words-that is to say, about the contents of thirteen leaded columns of a London newspaper from fourteen to eighteen of these tiny leaves were put into a quill and tied to a pigeons tail, several copies of the same leaves being sent by different pigeons, so as to diminish the risk of loss When the bird reached Pans the quill was immediately forwarded to the telegraph station where the leaves were read through a microscope to a clerk, who wrote out the despatches for each person But this was a terrible slow pro- test it permitted the employ most of only one reader pick] only one writer, which was insufficient for copying some 10 000 telegrams of ten words each. So, after a few days, the leaves were successively placed in a large microscope, to which electric light was adapted and the magnified image of each leaf was projected on a white board, from which it was copied by as many clerks, taking a column each, as could manage to get sight of it from the writing table lines, however, was still too slow, and the final improvement was invented. Instead of throwing the image on the white board, it was photographed straight off upon a large sheet of collodion, direct positive proofs being obtained, without any intervention of a negative, by the substitution of black for white, and vice versa 'The col- lodion sheets were cut up, and the pieces were distributed to a hundred clerks, so that all the cargo of a pigeon was copied and sent out in a single day. the explanation which I received was accompanied by a practical illustration of the working of the process, and when I left I was presented, to my very great satisfaction, with an original pigeon despatch of the 11th i November I shall carefully preserve that strange little memorial of the siege The St rcTitORCoi i ix born MAXUrAcnniF The science of astronomy is not alone to be benefited by this marvellous instrument, for we learn that during the past few months, almost simultaneously in England and in America, it has been brought into use in the manufacture of Bessemer steel to and in deter- mining the right moment at which the fusion of the metal is complete and it is ready for casting By means of this instrument the flame issuing from the furnace containing the steel is analysed, and the spectrum is watched until it is seen to change its colour to a deep crimson-a change which indicates, with invariable accuracy, that the precise moment has arrived for shutting off the blast and for commencing to cast the metal It was, however, for some time found impossible to determine with accuracy the state of the molten metal when manganese was present in the iron, but science 1 is at length triumphed over this difficulty, and an instrument called a ceremony cemetery has been devised, consisting of a combination of coloured glasses, two being ultramarine blue and one dark yellow, which so accurately indicates the state of the metal that it is said an ordinary workman may be entrusted with its use This is a remarkable and unique application of an instrument which has already proved of inestimable value to the scientist, and we hail with pleasure its introduction in the important branch of our manufactures, believing that it is but the opening of a held of scientific investiga- tion which may be attended with important results in the manufacture of steel IFMIMIAXCE Axn WoRK the late Mr Doxat, who had been for more than fifty years editor of the Observer, furnished an instance of the manner in which temperance and regular habits of life can enable a man to successfully withstand the heavy wear and tear of active literary life He was ninety six when he died, but is supposed to have been much older If our journalists were as careful in respecting the rules of health as was the late Mr Doxat, we should hear less of the ravages occasioned by intense mental activity ' Is rw si Al Em STATISTICS -From the A newspaper Press, Directory for 1871 we extract the following on the present position of the newspaper press -There are now published in the United Kingdom 1-150 newspapers, distributed as follows -England I andon, 261, provinces, Skahill , Wales, 63, Se Island, 111, Ireland, 135 British Isles, 20 Of these there are 88 daily papers published in England, 1 in AValcs, 1 in Scotland, 19 in Ireland, and 1 in the Channel isles On reference to the edition of the Directory for 1851 we find the following interesting of acts viz that in that year there were published in the United Kingdom 665 journals , of these 18 papers were issued daily vi/ , 13 in England, 2 in Scotland, and 3 in Ireland, but in 1871 there are now established and circulated 116 pages, of which no less than 120 are issued daily, showing that the Press of the country has very greatly extended during the last 20 years, and more especially so in daily papers, the daily issues standing 120 against 18 in 1851 The machines now in course of publication, including the quarterly) reviews, number 038, of which 200 are of a decidedly religious character, representing the Church of England, Wesleyans, Methodists, Baptists, Independents, and other Christian communities THE ROYAL AAumrso-IHK DEPARTMENT OF THE MAiiotisoi NOUMEA English journal observes - In after years, when posterity refers to the files of the daily papers of the present time for information as to the marriage of Princess Louise to Lord Lorne, it will have some difficulty in arriving at any definite conclusion with regard to the demeanour of his Lordship on the happy occasion The accounts of the wedding, which are for the most part clothed in very beautiful language, slightly differ on this point. According to the frailty After, the bridegroom comported himself with a modest gallantry which proved him to be fully equal to the somewhat trying position he filled" the Morning Advertiser informs us that " the Marquis did not shrink from the scrutiny of the many eyes directed toward him He stood erect, proudly erect, gazing about him with what, if not gratified pride, was certainly entire self possession " On the other hand, the Daily Telegraph states that "although not in the least unequal to this crisis of his brilliant fortunes," the bridegroom was " pale and plainly emu. ' He stood before the service commenced " looking towards the door by which so very soon his Princess was to enter, nor did he ever take his gaze from the choir gave ThereaBonfor this anxiety is, however, explained, and fully accounts for his lordship s suppressed emotion it was natural, says the Telegraph, that he should look so steadfastly at the door, for suppose it to have been a fairy story after all A charming di cam and the princess to have been spirited away by enchantments while the lost bouquet of orange-blossoms was being fixed, and all the gorgeous marriage pageant was melting away But no' Shine out fair sun, for she is coming, the Princess Bride," Sec , c There seems to be no doubt that Lord Lorne really did entertain the disagreeable apprehension referred to, for it is again mentioned by the Telegraph farther on in its account of the proceedings. When the ceremony was concluded, and her Majesty, " draw up the Princess to her bosom, had kissed her with motherly fervour upon the face cheek, the thrice and four times fortunate Marquis, no longer having any cause to fear that the chancel door would never open or that his Princess would be washed away by envious enchanters,' was, it appears, at this moment just a little in the clouds,' until Gold Stick in Waiting whispered a word in his ear what that word was is not stated, but the account is correct, it produced a magical effect, and completely destroyed the hallucination under which Lord Lorne had been labouring He turned with quick glad gesture, and bending low till his knee touched the ground, reverently kissed the extended hand of he Queen Fortunately for his lordship, the attention of the Feleoiajih was here diverted by the presence of the Duke of Saxe Coburg, which reminded us of the war and affected it profoundly What a different scene was this splendid pageant of English peace and concord to those blood-won triumphs from which the German Pruwe had just come and how different from the battle which he had been hearing the sweet and holy music "Friday With which the skilful organist melody of a. sim, i s t Js satisfactory to feel concludes the ceren e s Uo little clouds that with the exception c p '2 the bridegroom namely, the mistaken impression o. gift suitable that the ceremony was unreal and a '. tog at admonition" which the Telegraph felt it was the duty to address to the Duke of Saxo-Cobu nothing occurred to interfere with the success of tan ceremonial.
