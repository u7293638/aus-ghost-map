It was wonderful what' really r good feliows some very bad fellows turned out to be when they thus left their bad nauies behind them ; and, on the other; baud, it was equally wonderful how very poorly some famously good J fellows came out when there was nothing to . live for but duty during four-andtwenty hours of every dny. There was a vague impression that Lieutenant Mouraneff bad got into-his trouble about a woman, which naturally those who had fallen into' theirs for other reasons allirmed to be a matter of course, so that they .also might have a chance of a similar impeachment when, their backs were turned. This was not to his discredit: especially as he was better off than most of his comrades, and was found not wholly incapable of lending small sums on their exceedingly unsatisfactory security. What did tell against him was an idna that he was not so brave.a man as a soldier ought to be. How such a notion got about I know not: how do such notions get a beginning 1 For no body has a chance of showing cowardice in battle, and a n a b Lieutenant ilouraneff's manners and appearance were certainly not such as to warrant any such scandal. He was exceptionally big and stroug ; and, if he was somewhat given to bluster, thai, is no more a sign of want of courage nowadays than it was iu the Homeric age. " All the same," growled .Major: Gref, a veteran who had come-, to'look upon human life as composed ,of; two elements — fighting Circassians and drinking brandy —" that big fellow has the heart of a chicken. I've not studied mankind forty years without knowing the signs." "Mankind ! \ As if one learns mankindin .the Caucasus, or womankind either,"; said' the subaltern witii Whom" 'ne was arguing, and who "had spent bis • infancy in' i,!:e Service in St: Petersburg itself to such purpose . that, he .had come to be here. . " I'll lay you twenty roubles to five, and that's'more than L can afford, that a fellow like " that will charge as well '' "Yes;7as we':] as anybody. -That's no test a^; tilj,'. Piithini up facet), face witli'a single enemy at twelve paces, one pistol loaded, and lieither knowing which lias the other's life in his hands: 1 Can a man 'do '-that, and keep ; bi^ forehead cool and dry ?

" The major here^vants to .bet that you won't fight at twelve paces unless you kiiow; that' you've got the only loaded • pistol between the two of you." Mouraiieff stared heavily. "Does either of you want to try 1". asked he, in a voice Which showed'thatlie was, at any. rate, not afraid' of the bottlb, and in the manner of one who takes his drink, unkindly. ' " Not"" 1," 1 laughed/,the mischief maker. There was nobody present in-the: .rough vpow ot the posthouse but these three and a traveller, obviously -a civilian—a very - qiiiet, ,: even - gentlelookiug \- young - man,, whose' very presence in that savage and idi^erbus region. :gave ground, for speculation, especially as Ijc had made no attempt . tp make aqquaiiitaiice. •Avithviiis'.phan^ecompar.ions. .•''•.-./. Mouraneff glanced from the young office]- to the major, .anil, after a - slight skirmish of eyes with the latter, turnedhis upon the young civilian, who seemed, too. occupied, with ' his.: dwar thoughts even to feel the prolonged stare. A sober man, conscious of his own couiage, would have thought however, had obviously . taken the chaff as he had taken his liquor—that is to say, souily though whether that meant that he was simply not sobei, or whether that he' was not- too conscious of courage of a better sort than the. bully's, one cannot venture to say. Atany rate, after a full minute of silence, he rose, and swaggeied to the table where the mildljo'imr tiaveller wa isiftingmbsqfbed ".What's \ out n me' he a ked i n a sudden voice ti at t tiled the window panes.

You will kindly convey "the cartel of Paul Arenz ;to- Lieutenant Dmitri Ivanovitch Mou- - ranefi." But a wonderful change had been wrought upon Mouraneff. It seemed as if by the traveller^ eard all the fierceness had gone' out of him. He positively looked scared. But he recovered himself, ; and broke - into rough, :straiige daughter, as if be were trying to ba geniali and failing. ; ":Bah 1 "; s^d .he, holding o.ut; liis hand to -Paul Arenz. "As if you three fellows didn't see I was joking, to punish .'their wager and to try your, mettle. Let's send for some brandy." " Good-night, again, messieurs," said Arenz, with a bow. " And this time I will say au revoir / " ; He left the room, followed by the. major,-: while Luboff and .
