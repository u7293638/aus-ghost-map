AMUSEMENTS. \--2 THEATRE ROYAL.-" HAMLET There was a fairly large audience last night at the Theatre Royal to witness the production, for the first time during the present season, of " Hamlet," but there might and ought to have been a better attendance in the dress or to Mr Warner's Coupeau in " Drink " Is an artistic impersonation, but those who had not seen him in anything rising above the level of ordinary drama must have been agreeably surprised to find that Mr Warner's talents were equal even to the classics of the stage His Hamlet was fully criticised when he first appeared in Sydney, and nothing need be added save that be strengthened the opinion then formed as to his conception of the part HIS acting throughout was masterly, and in the course of of the evening he received the compliment of several genuine and hearty recalls As a whole he was excellently sup ported Mr Herbert Flemming's Horatio gave evil once of careful and intelligent study of the character, and he thoroughly conveyed the idea of the stanch and prudent friend to whom Hamlet confided his sorrows The Laertes of Mr Richard Stewart is also entitled to equal praise Mr Stewart's name was favourably associated with the character not very long ago, and it is therefore only necessary to say theme proved fully equal to the requirements of the part Mr Albert Marsh as Claudius, King of Denmark, was painstaking and dignified, and, what is very much to the purpose, he dressed the cart well Mr H H Vincent had a double responsibility as the Ghost and the First Player, and in each he acquitted himself as only an actor of his attainments can Mr Deering was rather heavily weighted as Polonius, and appeared to convey to the minds of the audience the conviction that he was the funny man of the play, which is hardly what Polonius was intended to be He was, however, very much better as the first gravedigger, and evidently appreciated and understood the moral philosophy of which Shakespeare made that character the exponent Mr Alfred Phillips was also good as the second Gravedigger Miss Gracie Warner had an unusually responsible task in Ophelia, and though the part may be said to be at present somewhat beyond her, she looked the character, and in the mad scene displayed considerable power. Miss Ada Ward, as the Queen, infused into the part an amount of fervour which earned her well through it, and her well-known dramatic talent was admirably brought out in the closet scene with Hamlet. The audience were evidently deeply interested in the performance, and it seems a pity that Hamlet cannot be repeated before Mr Warner leaves Sydney It is hardly necessary to remind the theatre-going public that to-night Mr H H Vincent is to take his benefit Indeed, as far as the dress circle and reserved seats are concerned, further publicity as to the fact seems superfluous, because all the accommodation in these portions of the Theatre Royal have already been taken up, and there cannot be the least doubt that a large demand for seats in the popular parts of the house will be made It may be mentioned that "Captain Swift" will be presented for the last time at any rate for the present
