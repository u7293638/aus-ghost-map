The secret of the great hold fiction has is that it. brings some touch of the romance"" xve all demand inf o our lives. The k have iii our everyday round the more we denial land froim books. Have you nevei been sin-prised at the seeming contradictions by. which people enjoy the very opposite style, one would expect? ' The quiet hoy in the humdrum office who gloats o.vcr hat-tic, murder, and sudden death, over daring crimes and wholesale ca tastrophes, the girl whose days are given (o sewing or household work—a round that grows so very common—but who likes to read of dukes, duchesses, despair, and ro mantic love scenes. I 'imagine that real dukes and duchesses (this is only fancy, J. do not know any to ask), real dukes and duchesses, I fancy, will prefer to read tales of poo/f folk—of slum life, or country life, with a tortch of sordid tragedy. It is always what, we have not that Kjnwlw to us for romance; diamonds and titles to the workgirl, povoily and fliicon ventio'tvality to those of higher . rank. There used to he a lady of title who wrote 'lor the magazines, and her stories were always of poor 1 it-lie milliners—not very real, but nearer the mark, perhaps,. than the duchesses that real milliners would read of after workhours. ._ , _ It is delightful magic, that fairy wand'of fiction that takes. us out of ojU'fit'ivcs and makes tip the broken music V»f life. .And so long as we reineiybc-'r' tint the little touch of romance that'gilds every day life is fairy gold all is'•well, it is when we mistake it for the* real'thing that it does harm, and by "false glitter makes things ahout us seem poor and sp'iialid and dingy, and our own 1-ot dull and hard—makes us> even overlook the real gold of life. We all delight in love stories, and romantic situations are just the tiling to read'of by the lire—but in the real world we shall wake in to-mor row other things hold an important place, dirties and interests and .-.pleasures in plenty. Life is not planned like a magazine story. A handsome and impassioned hero will nor, turn up just wlien you want help. You will as a rule find it best: to help yourself. Iticii uncles do not, I find, appear'just when one Wants them. He often amuses me, that rich uncle of the short story, and Christmas number type. He always conies from Aus tralia, but one never meets hiln here. f. suppose he.liveg in the hack of beyond, and that is why he is so unused to polite so cietv, and is taken for a pauper and cut by all his relations except the heroine.' Fairy gold, too, are most lireliglrt dreams, they vanish before the crude glare of day light; hut they are very pleasant, and help sometimes towards courage for the working da v to conic. \GPfK.
