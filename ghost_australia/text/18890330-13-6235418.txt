REVIEW. THE PACIFIC LANGUAGES These two little works are the scientific first fruits of the Rev. D MacDonald. long and honourable career as a missionary in the New Hebrides Mr. MacDonald has recently made himself known as a determined opponent of the French claims, and an ardent champion of Australia dominion in the Pacific we have now to congratulate him on the ability and the diligence with which he has prosecuted his studies in the languages and customs of the Pacific people, Two interesting problems occur in connec- non with the subject The first is to discover a complete explanation of their mythology, religious ideas, and social' customs, as has been done at great length in the case of the North American Indians, and by critical deductions in the case of the primitive Aryan tribes, in order that these may be compared with rest groups ideas among other inferior races The second task is to trace the origin of this people or peoples who are scattered over the Pacific Islands. x e can tell with certainty that they have been a wandering race, drift nigin their canoes across miles of ocean for the similarities of the languages spoken in the Sandwich Islands, in 1 at, Tonga, Samoa, in part of the New Hebrides, and among the New Zealand Maoris, can only be accounted for on the supposition that all the speakers of these tongues belong to the same race, and have at no distant date derived their speech from a common source We can further infer that this group of associated languages, which Mr MacDonald calls the Maori Hawaiian, is closely connected with the Malayan But, on the other hand, there are hundreds of dialects in the South Seas, which, at first sight, it seems impossible to reduce to any sort of unity in these illiterate lands a language alters with amazing rapidity A word is shunned, perhaps on account of its association with some calamity, or it is pushed into disuse by a new phrase and in that case is at once forgotten. No standard exists, and b) dropping old words or changing them capriciously, each tribe, each village, creates a dialect of its own Hence, except in the case of the Maori Hawaiian which has been comparatively well preserved, it is hard to pronounce whether the languages have been drawn from some part of the continent of Vam, or whether they are the natural speech of an indigenous people of Into the maze of these innUtfieraEih did It its Mr MacDonald boldly plunges, with a theOry to serve him for a clue Attempts have previously been made to connect them with the Aryan tongues Mr MacDonald contends that they are degraded and dam tegrated loans of an ancient Semitic speech that their kinship to Hebrew and Arabic can still be discerned, in spite of the mutilations which have been cut-off by centuries of ignorance and want of communication with the outside world, and that the people themselves are descended from curly Arab emigrants According to this theory, the Oceanic languages are divided into four classes-the I'ayalan, theMaluyan, the Papuan, and the Maori Hawaiian All these branches of speech are further assumed to spring from one original stem, which has now been lost sight of Adopting this premises, Mr MacDonald speaks of the Oceanic language as embracing all the dialects spoken from the Indian Sea, through the Indian Archipelago, to the Western Pacific He even conjectures that what he calls Oceanic may have been at one time spoken in Ceylon before the island was captured by hordes from India Assuming, then, that the Oceanic tongues and peoples are really one, what Mr. Macdonald asks, must be their parentage ' mi he replies without doubt or hesitation that their ancestors must have migrated from Arabia. Everyone is aware, of course, that the ancient Arabs carried on a considerable trade with India and Africa, and that they had settlements on the coast of the Dark Continent and the islands III its vicinity There they came into contact with a negro population, and Mr McDonald be hoped that this accounts for the negro or negroid element among the inhabitants of the South Seas 'These people, he asserts and undertakes to prove, are descended from a mixed Arab race, which has spread, in the course of time, over all the islands of the East, ' We may conjecture, he writes, that the Oceanic fathers from Arabia or neighbourhood immigrated into Oceania nearly 4,000 years ago, carrying their speech the mother tongue of the Oceanic-with them As they became separated and sent tered, their dialects multiplied, and while the analytic process prevailed universally, it naturally went forward more rapidly in some dialects than in others. Such a theory necessarily requires a most convincing proof Nothing short of a most convincing demonstration, drawn from the radical forms of the languages themselves will ever induce scholars to believe that the petty Oceanic dialects are derived from the polished and comprehensive Semitic tongues. Mr MacDonald is aware of this, and essays the task with great spirit, bringing to his aid a large acquaintance with many of the Oceanic languages. Whatever we may think of his deductions, we must give him every credit for his scholarship and industry, and for the scientific zeal with which he has pursued the study of languages but little known This, however, is hardly the place to estimate how far he has been successful in his contention The judgment upon his theory, and the reasons by which it is supported, must be left to experts Of more interest to the general reader are Mr Mac. Donald's notes on the religious ideas and customs of the people 'Die guns are called in states interstate, which literally means the spirits of the dead ' Further, we find that the word ate, which is translated " spirit, ' also means ' man ', and Mr MacDonald explains that the " spirit or ghost of a dead man was supposed to resemble the living man as his notice in water or a looking glass With this notion of the shadow surviving after death is associated the superstition that the spirit of the living man may leave him for a time during sleep and appear to others. "The Presse sometimes declare that they see both ' forms of spirits Similar super stations still linger among much more civilised races, and there may still be people in remote parts of the United Kingdom whose belief in " wraiths" is not yet extinct But taking those facts, the religion of the Pacific tribes would seem to be a form of ancestor worship Such an inference might be strengthened by a curious fact in the Pacific mythology In the New Hebrides and in many of the other groups, the entrance to the spirit world is supposed to be situated on the westernmost point of land Apparently the ancestors had come, from that direction, and Outlier their descendants go to rejoin them The New Hebrides my th ology, however, makes the journey long for in the Hades of the islanders are seven stages, and the spirit dies six times, and then, like the body itself, passes finally out of existence. The main principle of family relationship among the people Mr MacDonald asserts to be the sense of kinship through the mother rather than through the father of the family, and he naturally dwells upon the similarity between this and the social conditions which prevailed in the earlier history of the Hebrews. 'I he similarity, however, does not prove that the inhabitants of the New Hebrides are degenerate Semites, As a matter of fact, the constitution of early) Hebrew Society was tribal like that of the Pacific islanders, and the similarities may be accounted for without accepting Mr MacDonald's theory One of Mr. MacDonald treatises, the Pfatese Grammar has been written under great tits advantages, the work bellin ordered for the Melbourne Public 1 ii mr. while Mr. MacDonald, expecting no such event, had left many of his notes of Havannah Harbour He Illinois regards the present publication is only a prelude m annie larger and more exhaustive work W t trust that he will believe came out his helium As a missionary, in IIUH upp nannie, of stud) in native 1 uiuUiitcs which are afforded to no one else, and if he tints not settle the anth.ru_Kiloi.icul press, in which he or sports to himself, he will at le lit supply silence with much unit but in it out and with a mass of interesting facts, accurately) within d and honestly stated It is but too seldom that missionaries enters) s fanatically upon this scientific work.
