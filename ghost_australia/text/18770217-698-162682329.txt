SP0RT IN ENGLAND. t by our own coekbspondent.J The recess is upon us at last, the turf year of 1876 has come to an end, and for four months we have nothing more exciting on hand than the conning over of racing statistics, which, alas! bring to the minds of so many the ' morals ' of which, though advised by friends, and those ' in the swim,' they neglected to tike ad vantage. True, there is a ' cross-country season,' and we are now approaching some important events in steeplechasing ; but, though their popularity has greatly increased of late years, there are none but the Grand National of really general interest. Bnt the recess is a relief after all. We live in an age of strain. ana t'veryuii uf; u*'i'iuuhc, y*. nu.i half the number of meetings and the stakes were^doubled in value, we should have a better class of horses running, less rosuery, and in all probability a better stamp of animal forthcoming foe hunters and cavalry horses. This is a fact generally admitted by those in authority, and the revised rules of racing are a step in the rightdirection. .The minor gate-money meetings wiU now go to the wall or be elevated into a higher position. Shrewsbury races, which were being brought off when I last wrote, were as successful as usual. There were close upon twi» hundred horses on the spot, and no one could complain of 6mall fields; but the weather was thorough Shrewsbury weither, foggy, cold, and wet. Floods were out in all directions, and the pros pects were by no means invigorating ; and ytt all went fairly well, and, bar iosing backers and those who caught colds, no one had much cause for complaint. The four days' sport, however, may be briefly reviewed. Shrewsbury is not Ascot or Goodwood or Doncaster or Epsom ; it is not even comparable to the least interesting of the seven meetings at Newmarket. Lovers of racing in New South Wrales will be satisfied with a short resume. Trappist was brought out for the five-furlong Cleveland Handi cap on the opening day; but, even with F. Archer in the saddle, he could hardly be expccted to give 4 st 7 lbs to Rose water, a decidedly good three-year-old, or 4 et to a fast horse like Slander. Thefe two last finished first and second, the former winning very easily by half-a-dozen lengths. Fog overhung the course to such an extent that the Autumn Steeplechase was only seen with difficulty. It brought out a decidedly good field of thirteen. We are not particularly well off for steeplechasers just now, and these were above the average. Last year's Grand National winner. Regal, 12 st. 7 lbs., was the top weight and favourite as well ; but tbe ground was against him, and, besides, he was hardly wound up. However, he finished fourth, jumping well as usual, Batcatcher, a horse by Young Monarque, 10 st. 11 lbs., winning iu a canter by throe lengths from the light-weight Craven. The second day was actually sunny and enjoyable, and also boasted the most interesting race of the week for the lovers of the well-tned and 6peedy thoroughbred. The Newport Cup of 200 sovereigns, five furlongs, brought out four of the fastest horses in training over the distance, and a capital finish was the result. Lowlander, 6 years, 10 st., was top weight: Trappist, 4 years, 9 st 9 lbs ; Ecossais, S years, 9 st 6 lbs ; and Speranza, 4 years, 7 st 11 lbs, his three opponents. Ecossais was wonderfully fit, and favourite at 3 to 1 ; Lowlander being next in demand, whilst 4 to I was laid against each of the others. The four ran in a bunch to the distance, when Ecossais drew to the front, apparently having the race in hand ; but C. Archer kept Speranza going with whip and steel, and getting on level terms just below the chair, she won a grand race by a short head. Ecossais has a temper of his own, and when he was fairly collared all Goater's exertions failed to induce him to make the (inil effort. Trappist, three lengths off, was third. The Great Shrop shire Handicap is a very popular back- end mile race ; but there was but little betting on it before the day. Cteruleus was the public fancy; but, easily as he won this race last year, he has since proved himself a vei-y uncertain performer. As soon as racing began, a decided move in favour of Tetrarch, a Mog&dor; coit, said to be nearly the equal of Speranza for speed, brought bim with a rush to the head of the poll, in spite of his small credentials. His trainer said that he had only to stand up to win, but trainers of most favourites arc fond of expressions of this kind before a great race. However, Humphreys was right this time, for Macdonald, riding his hardest from the distance, got home a length before the despised Lina, and Lord Gowran, Catecye, Hop bloom, ami Pageant, all good performers, were quite out of the hunt. The Great Shropshire Handicap of 500 sovereizns in specie, added to a sweepstakes of 25 sovereigns each, 15 forfeit ; winners extra; the second saves stake; 117 subscribers, 78 of whoai declared forfeit; the New Straight Mile.

The horses were at the post upwards of twenty minutes before time, and the signal being given without a failure tbe colours of Hopbloom and Lord Gowran caught the eye for a couple of hun dred yards, when Tetrarch and The Ghost, who laid next to Hopbloom on the inside, drew out in joint command. They were followed in the centre by Catseye and Lina, with Lord Gowran, Water Lily, and Cocruleus settling down in their heels, and Clare mont, prominent o n the right, in the company of Newport. No time was loBt on the way, and before reaching the bend the favourite had drawn himself nearly clear of The Ghost, and their successors were Catseye, Lina, Lerd Gowran, Newport, Clarcmont, and Hopbloom, almost in tne order given, until the commencement of the paddock. The last-named quartette were then in trouble, and Tetrarch was challenged -on his left by The Ghost, and on the other side by. Lina and Catseye, but in a close and interesting finish the light weight held his advantage to the end, and won cleverly by a length from Lina, who saved stakes by a held from Tie Ghost. From the latter Catseye was beaten another held, with Lord Gowran. clear of them, fifth, Newport sixth, Clarcmont seventh, Euxine eighth, Hopbloom ninth, Roehampton tenth, and Pageant eleventh. Water Lily did not pass the post. Time by Benson's chronograph, 1 minute 35 seconds ; value of the stakes, £1890. Rain fell in sheets all night, and the course was in a frightful state on the Thursday. The going was so holding that but few horses were able to act at all, and the fields were much smaller than they wouldotherwise have been. There were no less than tea events, for the Messrs. Frail arc liberal caterers, but one only need be alluded to here. The 10-Sovereigns Battlefield Handicap, with 150 sovereigns added, six furlongs, found Ecossais, with 9 st 12 lbs, bold enough to try his luck through the mud. As was expected, he failed to show prominently, and Catseye, with 7 st, won a good race from Rosewater, 6 st IS lbs, and Templar. The closing day aeain favoured us with sunshine, and there was an attendance worthy of the Cup Day. The race, however, was disappointing, as the ground was in* such a state, owing ti the continued rain and racing combined, that the heavy weights never stood a chance. Scamp, one of the last representatives of Sir John Astley, who now retires from the turf, looked well, but the money went on him chiefly because he was the mount of the lucky Fred Archer. The Shrewsbury Cup (handicap) of 500 sovereigns, in specie, ' added to a sweepstakes of 20 sovereigns each, half forfeit ; win ners extra ; second saved his stake ; about 2 miles.

The flag fell punctually to the time appointed, and Lady Maiden, Bugle March, Miss Lizzie, and Brotae to Royal George formed the iront rank to tbe ?-eaa: As they turned ont of the straight the field began to spread, ana at the commencement of tbe back stretch Lady Maiden had in creased her command from Brother to Royal George, while Sli»» Lizzie and Scamp alternately laid third. Thus early Archer wa driving tbe old horse, but he at the same time had lost the coin' pany of Talisman. The Malton stable companions, Agglethorpe and Clearwell, were hopelessly tailed off five furlongs from home, and with Scamp dropping back stride by stride round the oena. the issue was now confined to the three bottom weights. Of these Brother to Royal George had no sooner drawn up to the heels oi Lady Maiden than she shot away again, and coming a little wiae into the straight, enabled the favourite to take to the rails, wi.a Miss Lizzie steering to the whip hand of Lady Maiden. If air thing the latter seemed to possess the best chance to the distanc -, when the stood still to tbe challenge of Brother to Royal George, and although Miss Lizzie simultaneously came out and contested . very inch of ground, Mr. Crawford's colt heli his ova, aal who 5 . r'v by half a lenzth ; a bad third. Bugle March struggled tit the end and tini?h-d fourth, with Pageant fifth, Polonaise * th Aeglithorpe seventh, Scamp eighth, Common Sense ninth, n^lisn an teeth, Whitebait eleventh. La Coureuse twelfth, and .r-a-wel! last, earing i'scort, who did not pass the post. The mile Severn Cup brought out a very speedy field, Hopbloom, m-ruleuf. Dalbam, Lina, and Speranza amongst others, Oalliaiu, _ ' ars 9 fct 8 lbs. being the most fancied. Bat, wonder of wonders the second in the Derby of 1875, the despised Glaremont, about whom offers of S5 to 1 went begging, made nearly all the Tmin ng. and, answering gamely at the finish, won his first race Jz . neck from an unnamed two-year-old by Kin? John, with the Others beaten any distance. What hatfuls of money have beeu los' over 1 laremont space fails me to tell. Well do 1 remember ? looking °ver him '''ben he was sold as a yearling, and admiring his eood limbs and throughly compact shape, but 1 had before thi* autumn given him up in despair. The Warwick Meeting, which always winds up the year, had a rival this autumn in Manchester, but neither of them soared much above plating form, except in one or two items. Mr. Merry gives us plfDi.v of racing; but he sacrifices quality for quantity. He .considers, I presume, that every owner wants to win a £50 plate in order to pay the hay and com bill during the winter— a good theory for the owner, may be, but a most unsatisfactory one for tlie racing analyst. The first two days' racing need no comment. On the third there ?was a fine finish between Clarcmont (F. Archer), 4 years, 10 st 11 lbs, and Empress (Cannon), 4 years, 9 st II lbs, in the Great Autumn Welter Cup, the pair running locked together from the half- distance, and the judge's fiat being a dead heat. Claremont Aas redeemed his character, and ran as gamely as could be wished by any one. He subsequently walked over, and the stakes were ?dividtd. Empress, three events later, won the Studley Castle ?Cup, IK mile, after a capital race . Lord Dupplin won two races on the Friday with Telescope and Le Prorneneur, but thfe chief event was the Great Midland Counties Handicap ?of 25 sovereigns each, with 250 added; 2 miles; 57 sub scribers, of whom nine came to the post. The Shrewsbury Cup winner, now named Prince George, was favourite ; but there were rumours that Pageant, 5 years, 7 st 4 lbs, was likely to show 'better than at Mr. Frail's meeting, and rumour for once proved ?true. He held a good position from the start, and, staying well, .as in last year's Cesarewitch, won with consummate ease by three lengths from Prince George and Scamp, Freeman, Clarionet, and Xnnisbowen being amongst the unplaced. Pageant has at last done something towards compensating Mr. Gretton for a score of disappointments. The Grand Annual Steeplechase on the last ?day brought out five runners only, and Little Tom (Mr. E. P. Wilson), 11 st 10 lbs, won easily by ten lengths from Gamebird sndWtrlin. Turf statistics of 1876 will follow by next mail; but I may as well here set out the performances of the leading jockeys. The immense number of meetings ' now render it no matter for surprise that Fordhatu's great year of winning mounts — 166— has at last been surpassed Bythe bro, 'the Demon' has never donned silk this year. He has ibeen very far from well, but is now much improved in health, :and hopes to be in tbe saddle again next season in the great ittiree-year-old races. Fred. Archer heads the poll with no less -than 206 wins out of 662 mounts, an excellent average, indeed ! He has, however, not been in luck in the classic races — the City and Suburban Handicap on Thunder, the Ebor ilandieap on 'Lilian, and the Cesarewitch on Eosebery, being his principil victories. Including retainers and presents, he has netted between £5000 and £6000 in the season. Pretty good this, for a i toy not yet of age ! Fortunately, lie is honest, truthful, and j .steady. Long may he remain so. Constable and Bruckshaw are second and third, but beaten a long way. The former won the Lincolnshire Handicap on Controversy, and the Cambridgeshire ?on Roscfcery. The Derby, with Kisber, was won by Maidment; the Two Thousand Guineas by Luke, and the St. Leger by Goater, Tetrarch being the hero of both these events.

It will take Archer a long time to beat this. We have biy steeplechase meetings at Croydon and Bandown Park. The Grand National Hurdle Race at the former scene of ?action was won pretty easily by Woodcock, who was rather fancied for Galopin's Derby, and has been in reserve since. The Irish division scored a genuine triumph in the Great Metropoli ' tan, Pride of Kildarc being little thought of, and all the money fiom the public going on the well-known performer over Wood side, Congress, who was overweighted, the ground being too holding.

Martha, and 20 to 1 v. Jupiter. Martha at once went ^to the front with a slight lead of Wild Monarch, Bavola, and -Jupiter, then at a clear interval came Zero just in advance of 'Congress, with Lancet in the rear. As they raccd to the water iump, Wild Monarch, Martha, Jupiter, and Bavola were still in alofe company showing the way, and Congress drew into fourth place, and Bavola retired from the front, being unable to go the T&ce;, which now was extremely good. As they went to the Woodsicie the lot closed up, with the exception of Palm, who was now some twenty lengths in the rear of all, and Pride of Kildare took fourth place, Jupiter now showing in clear command of Wild Monarch and Martha, and passing the half-mile starting-post -Home ten lengths ahead. This lead he increased as they came to the hurdles, taking the water for the last time some thirty yards in front of Martha and Pride of Kildare. Congress being next, with Wild Monarch ; while Zero, Lancet, and Palm were in the rear. In the farm-house field Zero showed Eigns of distress, but, being sent along, gained ground, in company with Lancet and Palm, as they went down the hill to the fence leading to the Woodside. Over this Jupiter was still in command, with Pride of Kildare and Congress at his girths, Wild Monarch coming next in advance ?of Lancet and Palm, Zero Tieing beaten. Jupiter was done with going by tbe Woodside, and Wild Monarch took second place to Pride of Kildare, Palm now being close up fifth. The Frenchman was the firet over the last fence, with Pride of Kildare now heating Martha a retreat, and the two leaders had a clear advar.taee of Congress, Palm, and Lancet. By the time the hurdles were reached Jewitt was hard on Congress, and -at the top of the hill Pride of Kildare had Wild' Monarch beaten, and though Congress made a bold effort, it was fruit less, and Lancet passed him near the post, Pride of Kildare cleverly holding her own, and winning by three lengths; five between second and third. Congress was fourth, Martha -fifth, s'xth, Jupiter seventh, Zero eighth, and Havola walked in. Tune, by Benson's chronograph, 9 minutes 25 seconds. Value of the stakes, £660. Congress had but little tetter luck at Sandown Park, where, as usual, ihe weather was abominable, though the ground is never Jery holding. Palm showed in his proper form, and, being 'favoured by the weights, had the better of Captain Machell's horfe when it came to, racing home on the flat.

Little Tom and ncet cut out the work up the hill clear of -Chimney Sweep, Palm, and Congress, with Jupiter and Sultana in the rear. Coming down the hill Congress, fencing slowly, fell into the rear, and Palm took third place, until nearing the water, where he drew up within a lengta or tiro, Little Tom dropping into third place, while here Chimney Sweep was fourth and Congress last. Passing the stand Liucet was slio^ing the way, but the field had closed up, and the pace was increased by Chimney Sweep racing up to the Ic.der. The leader at the next fence but one unseated his rider, and galloped | away by himself, and Chimney 8 weep and Sultana assume 1 the command, coming over the water for the second time in advance | of Palm, Congress now being very handy, and leaping better than in the earlier stages of tbe contest, whilst Little Tom was last. Coming down the hill for the last time, Chimney Sweep fell back I into third place, and Palm raced with Sultana to the fence at the i foot, where the n.aiv overjumped herself, Palm thus being left in ! command, but being soon joined by Chimney Sweep aud Congress, with Jupiter fourth. Along tlie far side there was no change, but at the water. Lord M. Beresford's horse was beaten, and was not further persevered with. Congress, when over, closed with Palm, and at the last hurdles was slieh'tly in advance, going apparently the sti onger, but I' Anson riding vigorously, l'alm again got in front, and won a good race by a length. Jupiter was a bad third, and Little Tom walked past the post fourth. Time, by Benson's chronograph, 9 minutes 8 seconds. Value of the stakes, £640. The statistics of the yacht- racing season arc appended, and will furnish an interesting subject for study by members of the Koyal Sydney and other lovers of the pleasure navy. The season was undoubtedly a trifle dull, owing to the fact that many well-known vessels were not in commission, and there is the samecomphint in yachting as in the highest racing circles, that the sport is over oor.e. . Regattas arc far too many, and a rage for pot-hunting has set in which has by no means improved the tone of the sport. The seamanship has not in any way deteriorated, and most of the racing vessels are splendidly sailed, but every one has compUined of the weather, calms and light airs having been the rule, and finking having prevailed to an abominable extent in consequence. Fyfe's 60-ton cutter, Neva, is the queen of the season, having earned off eleven first prizes, and close upon £100i. The Kriemhilda found it a difficult matter to save her time from the Clyde crack in 1875, and as neither Kriemhilda nor Cythera has hoisted a racing flag this last season, the Neva has had things much her own way. The Vol-au-Vcnt proved very weatherly in light weather, and the Fiona and Cuckoo maintained their repu tations as good vessels in any weather. Of the forty-tonners j Norman has the best average, and on one or two occasions she wa« only prevented from winning by mere mischances. Myosotis and B oodhound run ber very closely. \ Of the schooners, the Olga has done the most work, and the Egeria has been the most successful, though Corinne's average is j by far the best, she not having raced in the early summer. The Gwcndolin has not raced, nor has the weatherly Sea Belle, whilst the Pantomime did but little to recall her wonderfulform in 1873, when she won nineteen prizes in twenty-six races. ] Of the yawls, Florinda the Beautiful is, as usual, at the head of the class, though the newly-bui't Baven ran her a close race, and the one-day-cutter-next-day-yawl-rigged Neptune has proved herself a fine model in any weather. Fyfe of Fairlie, Ratsey, and Ilatcher have the best builder's averages. ** tt 2 ® Name of Yacht. Tons. Owner. |&|s % ? M Avcyron ... ... 15 Mr. F. W. C. Read ... 1 „. £30 Arrow ... ... 5 W. A.

Lumsden, Trickctt's shuffling opponent, rowed a dead lieat with Nicholson in a mile match on the Tyne, but won the deciding bout after a pood struggle. Otherwise theie have been many challenges, but nothing lurther. Trial eights have been rowed at Oxl'ord and. Cambridge, and the latter promise again to have a capital crew. Hun tirg and courting are in full swing in spite of the floods beine out in most districts. The North of England have beaten the South at Rupby football, Mr. Albert Hornby, the celebrated cricketer, playing very finely for the winners. Weston is again attempting a tOS-mile wa k in six days, but it does not excite much interest. ANGLICANUS. | London, 22nd December.
