And when number five arrived before number four was firm on his legs, they advised .Seth to look alive, for the undertow'was getting dangerous.

And for Seth's client, his; appreciatioa of the effort made in his behalf , was pronounced:, even in the fade of the verdiot. ' They hadn't nary fellow whar fit in the war 0J1 the jury/ he explained to the sheriff, on their 'way back to jail. ' Just a lot of riff-raff whar was brought out or scared out by them Hungarian devils.

' And there is no use slanging Alabama about it.' ° His appreciation of bis counsel's efforts, interplaying with. a oertain. sturdy independence inherent m the man, set Joe thinking bow, -as he himself expressed it, to set ' Seth up and trim him off right,' in requital of bis championship.. The result of bis deliberations was that, <i few days before his execution, -he, sent for Jessup. to come and see him, ' jus' rooisfele, for the sake of old tun^s,' and during the visit put him in possesion of Oertam information which aroused in the lawyer the most consuming interest.
