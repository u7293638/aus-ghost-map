TALK ON THE FLAGS. BT AN iDLEB. The talk is that the Government have kept their premise to call the Parliament together on July 5; that His Excellency has given the usual note of framing in the Gazette; that the Ministry have not a bed of roses in prospect; that they have some knotty points to deal with, which will require pru dent management on their part; that they have shuvMi courage in resolving to deal with the Boothby difficulty before the meeting of Parlia-, mciu; that this ought to be'regarded as a point in their favour; that the Treasurer will he able to lay the Estimates on the table immediately on the House assembling, and will make his statement within a week; that this shows a praiseworthy anxiety to get on with the work without delay; that the sooner the Legislature grapple with the real business of the session, the better it will be in the present state of the colony. The talk is that the holiday commemorating the Queen's accession was rather a quiet one; that the Torrens was one of the principal sources of attraction during the day; that many persons are taking i indly to boating on the fine sheet of water; that on Thursday the demand for boats far ex ceeded the supply; that some discretion should be exercised in letting boats to small boys who do not know how to manage them; that the four lads who, boat and ail, .went over the dam with a run had a narrow escape; that tills should act as a caution to others. The talk is that the upward tendency of the whtat market is rejoicing the hearts of the fanners; that the news of the good price which our cargoes have sold for in hngland before their arrival shows that the attempt to ship wheat there, even when prices are much lower, is not so Utopian as it has been thought to be; that one resu't of the upward tendency of the market is an enlarged area of land being sown; that the weather has been favourable so far; that the rains in the North have been heavy, and have done a large amount of good. The talk is that Adelaide has been favoured with the presence of a ghost, genuine or spurious; that he, she, or it evidently belongs to the mis chievous order of sprites, who fiud fun in prac tising silly larks; that there seems to be butlittie fan m rapping at people's doors in the middle of the night, and waking them out of a geod sleep; that it is more than a joke to stand shivering in the doorway, somewhat lightly attired, and peering into the datkness after that which is invisible; that it is strongly suspected some persons are creating this disturbance to serve a purpose of their ®wn, which so far remains hidden. The talk is that deputations to His Excellency are becoming a new and popular feature in our political institutions; that the frequency with which they are repeated will lessen the weight and importance which they ought to carry with them; that a personal appeal to the Governor should be reserved only for cases of extreme gravity and moment; that however pleasant it may be to wait on Sir Dominick, and to be received with that courtesy which he shows to all who have business with him, he ought not to be bothered with matters which more properly belong to the heads el the various departments. The talk is that no small surprise was occasioned on ISaturday by the placards calling for tenders for the conveyance of goods to and from the various railway stations; that it was at once surmised that McCulloch & Co., or Patterson & Co., had thrown up their tender, and that Hill & Co. would now be without a competitor. The further talk is that the Government refused to recognise the transfer of interest made by Patterson & Co., and are dis satisfied with the small prospect of having the work performed satisfactorily; that they have made several important alterations in the terms of the contract and in the management of the goods department generally. The talk is that the proposed discontinuance of landing the English mails at Glenelg is too absurd to be seriously entertained; that the mercantile community are not likely tamely to submit to the alteration of a plan that has worked so advan tageously in the past; that the matter is one which neither the Chamber of Commerce, the interest it specially represents, nor the public at large, will be silent upon; that the colony pays too dearly for early intelligence by way of King George's Sound to forego any of the advantages it is able secure by that service; that it is not the fault of Glenelg that a better light to guide the mail steamers is not piovided; that it would be far more reasonable to add a few feet to the height of the tower at the end of the jetty, and to supply lights that will be of some use, than to make the whole colony submit to two or three hours' needless delay in the receipt of home news. The farther talk is that the present Treasurer, so felicitously termed the Lord High Admiral of the province, will not consent to a change so adverse to the course he has pursued in the past. The talk is that the draining lof the Torrens by the removal of the planks at the dam has been unnecessarily precipitate; that it has left a score or two of boats high and dry on the verdant and picturesque mudbanks of our noble river, and has suddenly deprived hundreds of aquatic citizens of a pleasurable source of recreation. The further talk is that the water will probably be again thrown hack for a few weeks, or until such time as the workmen commence the foundations of the Mor phett-street bridge. The talk is that some interesting and amusing revelations respecting proceedings before the Governor and Executive Council in the Boothby case will by-and-by be published; that the public will wait with impatience until the knowledge, now confined to a favoured few, is communicated to the world; that a few highly entertaining passages in the records have b:en contributed by Mr. Justice Boothby; that it was quite characteristic of His Honor to take the introductory objection imputed to him of refusing to "herd with attorneys," and that if Mr. Parker, as alleged, did retort to His Honor's offensive query, "Who is that person?"—"I am ten years your Honor's senior at the English Bar," the answer was as neat and conclusive a one as the friends of either party could desire; that every alvantage was offered to the Judge in con mjction with his appearing before the Council bad he chosen to do so, and that His Honor, on bis part, has shown a most liberal desire to give prompt publicity to the line of procedure he has decided on adopting; that the current of the evi dence runs mnch smoother in the Judge's absence from the Council, and that very important testi mony has been given hearing on the investigation. The further talk is that the Council might with propriety have acceded to His Honor's request for delaying the proceedings for a week. The talk is that the disagreement between the Judges seems to have suggested a plan of settling the difficulty now existing in the way of the ad mistration of justice; that if Mr. Justice Boothby would systematically choose his own day for oc cupying the Bench, the other Judges might leave him to be sole monarch when he sat, and have independent days of meeting for themselves. The talk is that the exports'of wheat and flour since the commencement of the year have already been equal to two and three quarter millions of bushels; that market prices have considerably advanced, and that the agriculturists, with the enterprise and energy wkich have always charac terized our yeomamy, have been busily engaged in extending their operations, and in putting larger areas under crop. The talk is that the Boothby business is engross ing the whole attention of the Executive; that this is an unfortunate circumstance for them in view of the fact that they have to meet Parliament so early; that it has also operated as a serious check to the stream of deputations to His Excellency and Ministers which has now £et in so strongly; that this will enable such applicants for Government consideration to fortify themselves with evidence and arguments in support of their claims: that the Ministry will have a difficult task to discriminate which of the many works now being asked for should have priority.
