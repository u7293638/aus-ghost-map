LECTURE. to-. Mr P. J Edmunds gave a lecture on "Light, in the hall of the School of Arts, Pitt-street, on Thursday even ing last, in connection with the Board of Technical Education The lecturer stated that light was one kind of that i radiant energy which could pass through the vast realms of space There was every reason to believe that a medium was, never theless, essential for its cony tv sauce, and that medium was called the ether Light and radiant he it were the undue] actions of the ether, started by the limitations of the molecules of matter under the influence of 15 at The velocity of light in this medium which was supposed to be exceedingly thin and to possess pie it elasticity, was 10,000 miles per second, which number could be proved either by issue gallon of Jupiter's satellites 01 by pupils old assaults involving, minor within the space of an ordinary form The collection of light followed the same laws a. that of the or dimity billiard bill the two days lay in the same plane and formed equal angles with the council to the surface Willi piano minors the naming of an object was hence found it unequalled pendicular dist inco behind the silvered surface Reflection from unrelieved play- was illustrated by the delusion of ' Pi paper's Ghost and by the multiple images of a candle flame trained by the two surfaces of a piece of pho glass The selection of a beam of light as it passed from an into water, and the contend of don of light to a focus by an ordinary line, were then shown The mine fanned by one line 01 inn lot could be indentified by a second lens, there i ination of secondary and higher images being the principle of the microscope and of many other optical instruments- Dispersion always accompanied reflection On the king a beam of yy Info burst with a prism, the speed um 61 the different kinds of light appeared on the screen, the violet light being bent most from its path, that led least A disc closed with the various shades in proper poseidon when located quickly, appealed union only white lace white light was really a hired sensation due to all the colour of the spot t uni The solar speed-up exhibited dark bands knowing Iiuenholci's lines These were due to the presence in the solar atmosphere of certainly spurs which absorbed the particulars rags that were found wanting in the sun's first Hence the presence of sodium, non, high gear, and other plains rats was certainly interred in the sun in d s cars Luncheons solids gave continuous speed a of all kinds of light, mc adolescent (81-91 gave out particular kinds of light only, peculiar to their molecular constitution The speeds of s uno stars showed all the hands slightly displaced from which it followed that those buih.Bweic either approaching or receding for 11 the earth Double left auction was illustrated by a civ said of Iceland spar The point is given of light was shown on the screen with the birds 111 and two Nicol's prisms A piece of quartz pi 1 cod between the Mort's pi isms, showed the beautiful colours due to the rotation of the piano of pol motion in equity in the different colours The lecturer concluded by stating that the minute study of optic in science was a branch of higher mathematics, but that the great generations could be well under blood and illustrated by very interesting c.ponnicuts_
