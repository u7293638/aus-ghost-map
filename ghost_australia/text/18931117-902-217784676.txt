ROBERT BURNS. I see amid the fields of Ayr A ploughman, who in foul or fair Sihgs at his task ; So clear, we know not if it is The laverock's song we hear, or his, Nor care to ask. For him the ploughing of those fields A more ethereal harvest yields. Than sheaves of grain.: Songs flush with purple bloom the rye ; The plover's call, the curlew's cry . Sing in his brain. Touched by his haud, the wayside seed Becomes a flower ; the lowliest reed Beside the stream Is clothed with beauty ; gorse and grass And heather where his footsteps pass, The brighter seem. He sings of love, whose flame illumes The darkness of loue cottago rooms. He feels the force, The treacherous under-tow and stress Of wayward passions, and do less The keen remorse. At moments wrestling with his fate. His voice is harsh — but not with hate. The brush- wood hung Above the tavern door, let fall. Its bitter leaf, its drop of gall Upon his tongue. But still the burden of his song Is love of right, disdain of wrong- Its master chords Are Manhood, Freedom, Brotherhood ; Its discords but an interlude Between the words. And then to die so young, and leave Unfinished what he might achieve — . Yet better sure Is this, than wandering up and down An old man in a country town, Infirm and poor. For now he haunts his native laud As an immortal youth ; his hand Guides every plough. He sits beside each ingle- nook, His voice is in each rushiug brook, Each rustling bough. His presence haunts this room to-night, A form of mingled mist and light From that far coast. Welcome beneath this roof ot mine. Welcome ! this vacant chair is thine Dear guest and ghost. .
