THE BENAMBKA. SHOW. To the Editor of the Herald, Sir,—I see by your last week’s paper that the committee of the Eenambra A. and P. Society intend to break up, sell off property, Scc.

There is no 'wonder that people refused to have anything to do with a Society which whs managed liko this one. Every body knows it was no use for a farmer or selector to compete against the big land holders, who mostly comprised the committee. The management made rules which they mnde others abido by, but which they rode and drove through themselves with impunity. If a poor man Avon a prize, and there avhs the slightest irregularity about his exhibit, lie avas immediately pounced on, protested against and called on to sw'ear on the book that his answers to tliocommittee Avere gospel truth; if his spirit rebelled against this, he had to disgorge his prize-money. The big man, however, could “ scoop the pool” Avjth out any of his tricks being called into question. Look at the shameful Avay com mitteemen broko through Regulation 2G, debarring exhibitors from being present during adjudication of the judges. ^ Is it any wonder that people don’t tako any iuterest in a sIioav conducted liko this ? If the present committee intend to give up business,^ I would suggest that the farmers of the district combine aud form a Tanners’ Society, and got up a show on their own account- In a district liko this, there is no reason Avhy a decently-conducted show should not ho a success. I hope my fellowtfurmers Avill con sider the suggestion and act upon it when tho present Society gives up the ghost. The | sooner this is done, tlio better —lours, &c.;, agiucola,
