A public meeting in connexion with the inaugural meeting of tho new Presbytery of Hanaro was held on Thursday evening, in the Presby terian Church, the Rev. W. Bakcrin the chair. On the platform were a number of Ministers, including the Rev. J. E. Carruthcrs, Wcsleyan.and Mr.OHver, of Gcgedzerick,' represented the Ses sion of the Cooma Church. After a hymn by the Choir, tho Rev. Mr. Gardner, of Bombala, de livered a stirring address in the ne cessity of ministers and people being instant in supplication for the out pouring of the Holy Ghost to enable them to do the work entrusted to them as ministers and people. Ho confess-oi fehat the salvation of souls 4- , was much nearer his heart than a ?' H desire toexalt his church above other denomin'ationsof Christians, although the Presbyterian Church, he thought, in its government an 1 discipline were much nearer the true typo of the Apostolic Church than some who made a greartcr claim on apostolicity than they did, and he trusted that in whatever form of church government the pure and unadulterated truths of the gospel of our Lord found a home, that it would also find zealous Christian men and women to herald abroad its soul- saving truths. The Rev. Mr. Archibald, of Cooma, gave an interesting outline of tho introduction' of Christianity to the Sandwich Islanders, the manner of its introduction being an unniistake able result of Christian wrestling in prayer with God for the Spirits in fluence and help in that Vork at its first inception. Rev. Mr. CarrutViers said that to be present at this meeting was a pleasure indeed. The inauguration of the new Prespytery was indeed a new departure in the. work of God in this district and evidenced the fact that the work r-f God was ad vancing. Ho believed, in the di vision of the Church into various de nominations, and hoped that, as it was a distinguishing characteristic of the Christian religion toilovo those who were of the household of faith, the members of the various churches would love one another and forget their, sectional dogmas, and unite in ' prayer to' God rlpftf Weeing on the ?ii- work of each.] ^ .''' ?
