VEN. AROHDEAON. HALES'S. LECTURJS. ONTHE BIBLE, S TO THE. EDITOn. "Si,-Tho reporter of Arohdeaeon Haleos's leoture on the Bible in your, contemporary of the 9th inst. says, "The looturer eoncoluded with an assortion of his readiness to admit the existonce of orrors in the edhoeption of its writers as to morality and as to the attributes of God," Now, Sir, if the roy. gentleman really made such an assertion, we are bound to believe that he did it in good faith and per. foot sincority; but.the question arisos, "Was he, as a minister of the Gospol, justified in making that assertion ?" If ;we ,acopt the New Testament as divinely inspired, and believe the statement of Paul that', all Soripturo is given -by inspiration of God, there can be no errors as to morals or as to tko attributes of God-in the conception of the writors, simply because they were inespired'by, God; and if such errors do exist.in the Bible, thouen the writers, could. not have boon so inspired; or if they were, then the Holy Ghost does not possess -the attributes of Deity; or. if He doess, thoun Deity is not Omniscient, end if not Omniscient, then Deity is no Deity-a moro; idea and a deluslon-and we are cast loose upon a sea of. unbolief and infidelity without hope, and of all men most misorable. Trusting that the rev.: gentleman is misreported, or that he may be induced to re.consider the subject-Yours, etc., - J. A. GAOELL. Don, Sept. 11.
