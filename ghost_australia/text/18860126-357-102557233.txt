THE BLUE HERON. Where water-grass grows overgroon, SOn damp, cool flats by gentlo streams, Still as a ghost and sad of main, 'With half-closed eyes the huron dreams. Abovo him, in the sycamore,, The flicker hobeats a dull tattoo; Through papaw groves the soft aica pour Gold dust of blooms and fragrance now. Anid, from the thorn it lovrs so well, ' The oriolo flings out its strong Sharp lay, wrought in the crucible Of its flamoe-oircled soul of song. The heron nods. The charming runoes Of Naturoe's music thrill his dreams; The joys of many Iays and Junes Wash past him like cool summer streams. What tranquil life, what joyful rest, To foeel the touch of fragrant grass, And dose like him,while tendurest SDream-waves across my sloop would pass. -MAnAURICE G. TrOEiPSON, in "Songs of Fair Weather."
