[?] ?'NINETY- EIGHT.' By Dr. Campion. In the old marble town of Kilkenny, With its abbeys, cathedrals, and halls, Where the Norman bell rings out at night-fall, And the relics of gray crumbling walls Show traces of Celt and of Saxon, In bastions, and towers, and keeps, And graveyards and tombs tell the living Where glory or holiness sleeps ; Where the Nuncio brought the Pope's blessing, And money and weapons to boot, Whilst Owen was wild to be plucking The English clan up by the root. Where regicide Oliver revelled, With his Puritan ironside horde, And cut down both marble and monarchy, Grimly and grave — with the sword, There, in that old town of history, England, in famed Ninety-Eight, Was busy with gallows and yeomen, Propounding the laws of the State. They were hanging a yoang lad — a rebel — On a gibbet before the old jail, And they marked his weak spirit to falter, And his white face to quiver and quail ; And he spoke of his mother, whose dwelling Was but a short distance away — A poor, lorn, heart-broken widow — And he her sole solace and stay. 'Bring her here,' cried the chief of the yeomen, ' A lingering chance let us give, To this spawn of a rebel to babble, And by her sage counsel to live.' And quick a red trooper went trotting From the town to the poor cabin door, And he found the old lone woman sitting And spinning upon the bare floor. ' Your son is in trouble old damsel! They have him within in the town, And he wishes to see you ; so bustle, And put on your tucker and gown.' The old womau stopped from the spinning, With a frown on her deep wrinkled brow : ' I know how it is— cursed yeoman .! I am ready — I'll go with you now.' He seized her, enraged, by the shoulder, And lifting her up on his steed, Struck the spurs, and they rode to the -city, Eight ahead and with clattering speed. They stopped at the foot of the gallows, And the mother confronted the son — And she hugged his young heart to her bosom, And kissed his face, pallid and wan — And, as the rope dandled before her, She held the loop fast in her hand— For, though her proud soul was unblendhing, Her frail limbs were failing to stand. And whilst the raw yeomen came crowding To witness the harrowing scene, The brave mother flushed to the forehead, And spoke with the air of a queen — ' My son. they are going to hang you, For loving your faith and your home, And they called me to urge you, and save you — And, in God's name, I've answered andoome; They murdered your father before you, And 1 knelt on the red, reeking sod — And I watched his hot blood steaming upward, To call down the vengeance of God. No traitor was he to his country — No blot did he leave on his name — And I always could pray at his cold grave, Oh ! the priest could kneel there without shame.' ?'To h — 1 with your priests and your rebels,'* The captain cried out with a yell, Whilst, from the tall tower in the temple, . Rang out the sweet Angelus bell. ' Blessed Mother !' appealed the poor widow, 'Look down on my child and on me !' 'Blessed Mother,' sneered out the vile yeo maa-— ' Tell vour son to confess — and be free ?' 'Never, never ! — he'll die like his father — My boy, give your life to the Lord ; But, of treason to Ireland, ma vournccn, Never breathe one dishonouring word.' His white cheek flushed up at her speaking, His heart bounded up at her call — And his hushed spirit seemed at awaking, To scorn death, yeomen, and all. ' I'll die, and I'll be no informer — My kin 1 will never disgrace, And when God lets me see my poor father I can lovingly look in his face.' .'You'll see him in hell !' cried the yeoman, As he flung the sad widow away— Anrl +.V10 irnvi4-V- !n o rvi/%r«oT-4: waa Hf.rannrlinty f, i»«*v» UUV ¥ VUVU AU tM LUV/IX1VUW vr wsiw ?*— »^m f^mt^mmff^ \ In the broad eye of shuddering day.
