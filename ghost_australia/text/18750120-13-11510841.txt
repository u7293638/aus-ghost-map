WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1873. It will be remembered that some time ago a Mr. EATON, employed as a clerk of works in connexion with the Public Works department, published a pamphlet containing a number of charges against Mr. WARDELL, the inspector-general. A board was appointed by the Governor in Council, consisting of Messrs. PATTERSON, MACPHERSON, SULLIVAN, LANGRIDGE, and Dr. MADDEN, to inquire into the truth of the accusations, and its report, dated 25th November, 1874, was forwarded to His EXCELLENCY in due course. Its general purport was to completely exonerates Mr. WARDELL from blame in connexion with the several specific points mentioned. As regards the counter charges brought against Mr. EATON, the finding was not very clear or distinct The report wound up with the following part graph -"The board find that Mr " EATON has been virtually relieved " from duty although continuing to " draw a high salary But there " is such a lack of memoranda in " the Public Works department that " they are not in a position to say " whether or not Mr WARDELL C in be " held to have been relieved of the re " sponsibility which attaches to so grave " an act as that of allowing a public " officer whose services he declined to " use to draw his salary without giving " an adequate return to the state ' This document has been under the consideration of the Government for some time, but, owing to Mr WARDELL s absence in Western Australia, no decision was come to until last Monday But when it became known that the inspector general it would not return so soon as expected, the matter was at once dealt with We may remark, in passing, that this course of procedure seems rather strange Either fairness to "Mr W R riLLL required that judgment should be suspended until he could be heard or it did not If the former, then the extension of his leave should not have been followed by the perpetration of an injustice, if the latter then we would ask what has caused all this unnecessary delay in coming to a decision 1 In a minute addressed to the Premier, Mr ANDERSON reviews the finding of the board, and points out the course which he thinks should be adopted The Commissioner deals with Mr EATON in a very summary manner, but no one, we think, can qu travel with the justice of his decision - In view of the finding of the board upon the very grave charges preferred by Mr Triton against Mr W Wardell charges which if proved would have necessitated the retirement of Mr Wardell from the public service but we Inch Mr Eaton failed to substantiate and taking into consideration the career of Mr Eaton extends-, over a long series of cars in this department it is essential for the efficiency of the public service that he be dismissed and I accordingly recommend that he be dismissed AU discipline would be at an end if every subordinate in a department, who was not treated in exactly the manner which pleased him, was allowed to trump up and publish all sorts of charges against his superior officer with out incurring severe punishment A perusal of Mr ANDERSON S minute will show that not only was Mr EATON guilty of gross misconduct in bringing a number of charges against the permanent head of his department, which he must have known, had he reflected for a moment, he could not substantiate, but he also exhibited the basest ingratitude A board which sat on him in 1865, reported as follows concerning some of his former doings - Throughout the progress of the contract and at the final adjustment of the accounts he has SO evidently favoured the contractor is to raise a strong- presumption of collusion between them and although there is no direct evidence of corruption on the part of Mr Eaton we are unable to arrive at any other conclusion than that he has exhibited troBS partiality to the contractors and a total disregard of the public interest Mr W WARDELL confessed that he was unable to dissent from this verdict, but, nevertheless, suggested that Mr E ITO\ should be dealt with by the Government with all the leniency it could show In whatever way, then, we view this gentleman case we are constrained to acknowledge that he got no more than his deserts when the officer administer in the Government in Council directed his dismissal from the public service It is difficult to understand the motives which actuated Mr WIKDILL m recommending that an officer who had so grossly mismanaged the in taters confided to his care should still be retained on the staff The Inspector General admits that it was in consequence of his suggestion that Mr RAIÖN was not sent adrift, but states that the report which he minute has influenced him ever ' since, and that subsequently he never felt justified in giving Air Eirov the superintendence of any important work He deliberately recommended the retention of a man of whose services he could not avail himself, owing to the doubts he entertained concerning the rectitude of his conduct Under the circumstances, we think everyone must agree with Mr ANDERSON, that Mr " A\ ARDLLL cannot be held to have been " relieved of the responsibility which " attaches to so grave an act as that of " allowing a public officer whose services he declined to use, to " draw his salary as usual, without " giving an adequate return to the " state, and such being the case, the Government could not do less than visit him with its censure We must confess that his conduct in this matter is to us perfectly inexplicable, unless we adopt the hypothesis that pressure was brought to bear upon him at the time by his official superior, in order that matters might be so managed as to avoid the necessity of dismissing an officer who was understood to wield considerable political influence It is rumoured that Mr E ITO\ ia an Orange man of note, and that he has relied on the assistance of that powerful organisa- tion to pull him through his difficulties with the inspector general If there is any truth in these reports, we beg to compliment the Government on the moral courage it has exhibited in send ing him to the rightabout, without any regard to his political allies It is not often now a days that we can speak in commendation of Ministerial acts, and therefore it is with all the more pleasure that we seize the opportunity of acknowledging the good service done to the state in this instance It is evident, however, that while the pressure of which we have spoken would go some way to explain Mr WARDLLL'S enigmatical conduct in the matter, it would not divest him of one particle of the responsibility properly attaching to his recommendation The permanent heads of departments have been placed by the Civil Service Act in a position of great security, and they are bound to resent any improper attempts to influence their decisions If jobs must be worked, let the Minister for the time being take the responsibility, but do not let the civil servants aid and abet him by playing into his hands. We regret to say, then, that looking at the affair in every light that suggests itself to us, we must regard the censure passed on Mr WARDELL'S conduct as well merited It is evident that he has erred through w darkness or want of judgment-, and it matters little which alternative we adopt, as his conduct in either case is equally open to blame. The public cannot afford to have its works superintended by incompetent or careless inspectors, nor to pay officers under a cloud £485 a year for doing nothing. The International Exhibition at Philadelphia, which is to be held to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, pro- mises to be a "big thing." Nothing less would satisfy the American people and the edifice in which it is to be held is designed on a scale of commensurate vastness. The covered space will embrace an area of 18 acres, and the central avenue will be 1,640. in length and 120ft. in width. In this immense structure in itself a city of iron and glass-the managers of the Exhibition have arranged for a, display of the natural products, the scientific inventions, the artistic achieve- ments, and the manufactures of the whole world. Invitations to that end have been addressed to every foreign power, and there seems to be every probability that the great show of 1876 will be even more cosmopolitan in its character than the Hyde-park Exhibition of 1851 or the French one of 1867. We do not know that the Americans could have hit upon a better device for celebrating the close of the first century of their national existence, although it was a method which was assuredly never contemplated by ROBERT BURNS when he made his now memorable prediction in 1788 "I will not, I " cannot enter into the merits of the " cause," said he, " but I dare say " that the American Congress in 1776 " will be allowed to be as able and " enlightened as the English Convention '. was in 1888 and that their posterity " will celebrate the centenary of their " deliverance from us as duly and sin " careless we do ours from the oppressive " measures of the house of STUART." In the interval between the two dates the progress of the United States has literally been accomplished " by leaps " and bounds." When the first census was taken in 1790, the population was under 4,000,000. It is now in excess of 40,000,000. In 1860 the total value of the imports and exports did not exceed 102,000,000 dollars, but for 20 year ending the 30th of June. 1872, they were of the aggregate value of 1,212,328,833 dollars. And the same extraordinary progress is exhibited by consulting all the recognised tests of a nation's advancement in material prosperity. We need not now stop to examine the other side of the medal, or to prove how utterly astray JOHN ADAMS was in his forecast, when writing to THOMAS JEITEKSON in November, 1893 he observed: "Many " hundred years must roll away before " we shall be corrupted. Our pure, " virtuous, public-spirited, federative " republic will last for ever, govern the " globe, and introduce the perfection of " man." Spread-eagleism, it will be seen, had begun to assert itself in the United States upwards of 60 years ago. It is contemplated, as our readers are aware, to secure the representation of the arts, manufactures, products, scientific inventions, and new discoveries of Victoria at the Exhibition in Philadelphia and the commissioners appointed to promote this object have issued their preliminary announcement with respect to an intercolonial exhibition to be opened in this city about the commencement of August next. A twelvemonth ago such a project would have deserved to be severely discouraged, as altogether repugnant to what the Legislatures of the United States and of this colony have declared to be the true policy of their respective countries. For the chief object of such exhibitions is to make known the industrial products of one nation in order that a demand may arise for them in another, and thus stimulate that interchange of commodities which it is the very purpose of protection to prohibit and suppress. This, in fact, is based on the assump- tion that each community ought to be self-contained and self-sustained, and that the fewer the transactions it has with its neighbours, and the more numerous and embarrassing the artificial obstacles which are raised to the execution of such transactions, the better it will be for all parties concerned. Now, international exhibitions are established on the theory, that every nation produces many commodities in excess which are desirable in the estimation of all other peoples, and that the free exchange of these is not only agreeable and beneficial to the persons who effect the barter, but extremely advantageous to large classes of persons, such as merchants, shipowners, shipbuilders, sea- men, carriers, wharfingers, draymen, porters, and others who are the inter- mediaries in the business. All such exhibitions, therefore, are the outgrowth of and the auxiliaries to free trade, and as such ought to be frowned upon and discountenanced by protectionists. Happily, however, the people of the United States are rapidly becoming alive to the calamitous consequences of the fiscal burdens under which they have groaned for the last fourteen years, and are setting their faces steadily in the direction of free-trade. In this colony, also, we have good reason for believing that the protectionist craze is dying out, like other forms of fanaticism and that the reaction in America will have a salutary effect in assisting to kill the deplorable delusion here. Under these circumstances, the people of ^ le- tons may be fairly invited to seize opportunity which is about to be afforded them of making their natural products, arts, and manufactures known, not merely to the millions of Americans, who will make it a matter of national pride to visit the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia next year, but also to the concourse of visitors from all parts of Europe who will be attracted to the United States by the novelty of the event and the magnitude of the show. When wiser counsels prevail in the Congress at Washington] and in out own Legislature, we may look forward to an extension of commerce between America and Australia; more especially as increased facilities of communication will be opened up between the Pacific coast of that continent and these colonies, by the improvements which are being constantly affected steam navigation. With these prospects before them, we hope the producing interests of the whole group will recog make it as tending to their ultimate advantage to make this " a complete and " representative exhibition, so as to display in the most favourable light the industries, products, and resources of Australia. The contract with the City of Melbourne Gas and Coke Company for lighting the public lamps will expire as the one of this year, and the Public ?y^-M-S Committee has been authorised to ii,*->^ae" tenders for the service for either three or five years from the 31st December next. With a view to induce competition, the specification will provide that the contractors may right part! of the city wherein their mains may not be laid with other material than gas for such portion of the contract time as shall be deemed sufficient to allow of the necessary extensions being made. This we think is a judicious arrangement, but we question whether the time is long enough to induce either the Collingwood or the South Melbourne Gas Company to incur the heavy outlay which the complete i circulation of the city would involve. Some reduction in the cost of lighting is very desirable, not with a view as much of lessening the expenditure as of increasing the number of lamps. Although Melbourne is not badly off in this respect at present, there is still room for improvement. We trust that amongst other alterations the desirability of making some fresh agreement about lighting the lamps at the time of full moon will not be lost sight of. It froexuontly .nippons that the sky is overcast at these seasons, and then the city is left in absolute darkness. We have drawn attention to this fact frequently, and it says little for the business qualifications of the council that a remedy for this disgraceful condition of things was not found long ago. Now, however, that a new contract is about to be entered into, there can be no excuse for the continuance of a system which is fraught with numerous dangers and in- conveniences to the public. We pointed out on a previous occasion how provision might be made for lighting on cloudy nights' during the period of full moon without incurring any additional expense, and we strongly recommend the civic authorities to give our suggestions a trial. A good many years ago there was erected in Queen-street, a structure which was dignified with the title of Building Museum. Its purpose, internally, was not very clearly understood, but there was no doubt whatever as to the ends its outer walls were to fulfil. For it was constructed of all sorts of building materials, and to anyone not aware of the purpose of its ingenious designer, Mr. J. G. KNIGHT, it looked as if it had been put up by a very mad architect. The object of it was to test the relative durability of a great many bricks and stones, and, as a matter of course, the value of the experiment was a matter to be determined by time. It may be fourteen or fifteen years ago since it was put up, and now, we believe, it is about to be pulled down. It has lately served for the office of patents, and this department has just removed into the buildings lately occupied as gaol warders' quarters until the new buildings for the patent office, presently -to be built upon the site still occupied by the quaint-looking Building Museum. are completed. We are, therefore, desirous of calling attention to the original purpose of this structure, and of inquiring if any record has been kept of what has been observed in the materials it was designed to test. Opinion is yet a good deal divided on the question of whether we have any durable building stone in Victoria. A good many structures in which Victorian stone has been used represent a chronic condition of exfoliation, so that architects and builders together have persuaded most people to put up their houses of brick, and to smear them with that most villanous of shams, stucco. The common excuse for this architectural sophistication is that the stone is bad, and that good brick and what they are pleased to call " cement, " are better than bad stone. It is therefore really very desirable that before Mr. KNIGHT'S test building is destroyed, some report on it should be made. It was of no value at first, but it should be of considerable value now. Indeed, if it could be carefully rebuilt on some other less valuable site, its value might be still further increased by additions to its material, so that when a man had made up his mind to build, and, "Very naturally, desired to put up a structure which should not fail to pieces he wore it had ceased to be new, he should have nothing to do but to go and examine for himself, and select his materials accordingly. Or, if the Government have no mind to preserve what is so obviously useful which is likely enough, seeing that utility is not generally a recommendation with Governments perhaps some enterprising builder might purchase it and remove it carefully. Or the City Council might like to show how much more regardful of the public interests -they are than the Government. Or may be, the Technological authorities might think it at least of as much practical use as several cartloads in their collection of odds and ends which amaze folk by a singular valuolesanoBS. But if it is really to be doomed, and must go into inevitable debris, at least let us have some of the value of it represents, in the shape of a catalogue of its materials, with suitable comments, say by Mr. COSMO NEWBERY, upon the chemical effects of the at -mosphere upon them. Mr. KNIGHT'S Hellenics, though always ingenious, were not invariably of a practically useful kind, but this building museum was an exception, and we ought to do him the credit of acknowledging his foresight by avail- ing ourselves of all the benefits its result now holds out. Mr. Service, the secretary to the Omnibus Company, is a specious but somewhat injudicious champion of the association with which he is connected. In reply to a suggestion we throw out concerning the advisability of measuring the interior accommodation of the various omnibuses in use, he points out that the cabmen are petitioning to be allowed to continue their infraction of the city by-law, which requires that each passenger shall be allotted 10in. of space, and intimates that if it be granted his company will claim " in all fairness to have the advantage " of similar measurement." In other words, Mr. SPRIGG contends that if the cabman be allowed to defraud the pub -9-10 lay" ttV-Vying a larger number of passev.-TjjiFB than their vehicles can properly curry, the highly respectable company which has the honour of calling him -ecstasy should likewise be permitted to charge people for accommodation it is not able to afford, and to outrage decency by cramming fourteen men and women into a space barely calculated to hold twelve comfortably. When the cabman obtained leave to carry " four, including the driver, in the " front of cabs measuring 4ft. 6in. ' or 13in, each, this company asked " that when the weather prevented pas sengers from riding outside, it might 41 carry seven on each seat inside, giving to each within a small fraction of loin." Just as ; the convenience and the rights of the public go for nothing. The cabs have been allowed to cheat passengers out of the regulation space, and Bothe secretary does not see why the Omnibus Company should not likewise be in the swindle Surely this is very curious reasoning, and not exactly creditable to those who employ it This modest request, it appears, was refused, and " thereafter, ' we are assured, "allowing " buses have been constructed with more " than the regulation lGin for 14 inside We cannot compliment Mr SPRIGG on his ingenuousness in making this statement We do not dispute its verbal accuracy, but it is calculated to mislead Perhaps this gentleman would kindly in form us how many omnibuses are running, and what proportion of them are of the new description And in making up the return, it would be well for him to bear in mind that people, as a rule do not go about with their eyes shut Perhaps he will also explain how it comes to pass that many of the smaLler cars buses are licensed to carry la niBido What division can be made of this number to give every one his fair share of room ' lies is a matter to which we would draw the attention of the hackney carriage inspector Mr Siuioa may likewise feel inclined to explain why it is that the di lv 918, not content with getting Ilma vehicle made for 12 stop to take up additional passengers without any regard to the possibility of accommodating them or the comfort of those already " on board. It appears to us that the company would do better if it exhibited a little more consideration for the public, and a little loss craving for illicit threepenny bits Owing to the absence of the Premier and several other members of the Ministry from town the report of the board on Dr MGaurans case cannot be dealt with for several days the weather yesterday was very warm and oppressive The Government astronomer reports that it was the hottest day experienced this season the temperature in the shade reaching 100 8 and in the Bun 146 and according to the weather telegrams the heat extends over the whole of this and also the neighbouring colonies The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne Since 19-8 is 111 2 on January 14th 1882 in the shade , 100 in the sun. From a notice which appears in our advertising columns it will be seen that to day and until further notice the supply of water will be intermittent The districts north of the Yarra and Sandridge. will be supplied between the hours of 7 a.m and 5 p m and the districts south of the Yarra except Sand ridge between pm and 7am The origin of the fires recently seen burn ing on one of the islands belonging to Kent's Group boa at length been discovered Late last night information was received that the Oberlin of Adelaide ) had been totally wrecked on the north eastern end of Hogan's Island The captain and a portion of the crew first made for the lighthouse on Kent's Group but eventually they were all rescued and taken to Port Albert. In another column will be found the account of a destructive fire which occurred at Emerald hill at about 3 o'clock yesterday morning. The fire commenced in a small grocer's shop near the corner of York and Clarendon streets and spread to Thomas s drapery store and also to a boot and shoe shop and a barbers shop adjoining The total damage is estimated at I between £3 000 and £6 000 The commissioners appointed to rev resent Victoria at the Philadelphia exhibition propose to hold a preliminary exhibition at Melbourne early in August next The co-operation of New South Wales and South Australia has been secured and negotiations are pending not only with each of the other Australian colonies but with the Cape of Good Hope Mauritius Reunion Ceylon Java Singapore Hong Kong, Manila Jai an Tiji 'Vow Cue doma Hawaii and Tahiti 8vo Victorian exhibits can be forwarded to Phil delphia unless they have been previously exhibited at Melbourne but exhibits can be sent in for Melbourne only All entries must be made by the 1st July and all exhibits must be in Melbourne by the 15th July Exhibits will be forwarded free by all the lines of railway by the steamers at about one half the usual rates and the commissioners will do fray all expenses connected with forwarding, exhibits from Melbourne to Philadelphia. An application was made to the Postmaster General yesterday by residents on Mount Macedon for increased postal facilities U present residents on the mount are unable to relate letters within the 21 hours Mr Ramsay promised that the grievance should be remedied It may be remembered that some years ago a talented and engaging French nobleman the Marquis of Beauvoir while on a voyage round the world paid a visit to Melbourne and took great interest in examining our various institutions Among others he was greatly struck with the Botanic gardens and no doubt also with its talented curator Dr (now Baron von Mueller It is to be feared however that the doctor rather took advantage of the marquis s credulity if the account of Dr Mueller s achievement- as related by the noble visitor is to be traced to our Gov eminent botanist The subjoined letter was recently received by the Lands department here from an official source in South Australia - Sir -I have the honour to enclose an extract from a work published in London in 1870 entitled A ] voyage Round the World by the Marquis of Beauvoir and to request that you will be kind enough to inform me whether the statements therein contained are reliable in point of fact With equal bold ness and perseverance Dr Mueller has set up beacons. for adventurous spirits of the min-, generation He is enthusiastic for every noble end He encourages the now Squatters and tells them beyond the white stormy desert the granite and sand you will find pastures for thousands of borda But the misfortune of Australia is want of water. He wishes to remedy this and to this end consecrated almost all the funds of the Botanical gardens and he is succeeding He distributes over the interior of the country thousands of shrubs reared in his nurseries Little streams form rapidly round the young woods is of results are splendid already and each year confirms them On barren plains he has created woods and streams in more than a hundred places This astonishing statement was rather unnecessarily one would think submitted to an official for report and of course was returned with the observation that there was no truth whatever in the Marquis s extraordinary account which the officer said rather resembled an extract from the Arabian Nights E ita tainment than any thing which might be supposed to be written in the 10th century At a meeting of magistrates for the city of Melbourne held yesterday Messrs Thomas O'Grady J P and George Wragge J P were elected to act in conjunction with Mr Sturt P was the Licensing Bench for the city of Melbourne during the current year An application was made yesterday to his Honour Mr Justice Stephen in the case of Hoare v Robinson for leave to appeal to the Privy Council. The suit was in reference to an alleged breach of contract in connexion with the execution of certain works at the Turkish Baths of which the plaintiff is the pro actor and at the trial the jury found a verdict for the defendant. The application was made on behalf of the plaintiff by Dr Dobson and was granted on condition of security to the amount of ioQO being provided for payment of costs The council of the Zoological and Acclimatisation Society held a meeting at the Royal park on Monday and had acted the gardens and the zoological collection The following members were present Mr Purchas (president) Mr Venables Mr Sprigg Mr Moule Mr Hammond and ProfeSSor Strong Two beautiful crown yours I pigeons arrived a few days ago from Java a present to the society from Mr James M Lachlan now of Cheltenham The birds were brought over in excellent condition of the Swedish barque Hoidi per favour of Captain Dannberg Several landed proprietors have expressed a wish, that the society shortly introduce a number of song birds from England such as the blackbird thrush finches: 46 deliberate on their respective pre parties and have offered to subscribe a sum of money for the purpose The council will gladly expend the amount for this special object and the hon secretary of the collector will receive Sums of not less than £5 from gentlemen who may wish t participate When a sufficient sum has been subscribed the money will be sent home am the birds on arrival will be fairly divided among the subscribers The following story has been received at the gardens since the last meeting -A native dog from Mr Charles Bucknill of Morton Plains a pair of copper pheasants from Mr Charles Lyal Grant of Shanghai a porcupine anteater from the Hon Mr Sumner one do from Mr Deacon and one do from Mr V Daws of Hotham a sea eagle from Captain Stanley three emus from Mr Fletcher town clerk of Sandhurst a mopoke from Mr Flower of Toorak a black swan from Mr Brough Smyth and a tantalising from Mr J Robertson of Lonsdale street. A number of gentlemen connected with the insurance companies of Melbourne assembled yesterday afternoon at the Fire Brigade Station Little Collins street to witness a trial of a new fire escape ladder which has just been imported by the City Corporation at a cost of £180 The invention is an Italian one the patentee being Signor Porta of Milan his agent in Australia being Signora Palmieri These ladders have been in use it the chief cities of Europe and America for some years post and have been found of great service not only for fire escape purposes but also for builders and contractors as by means of them a considerable amount of exterior work can be done to lofty buildings without the erection of costly scaffold mg The ladder is 75ft long there are some in use 125ft thousand is in seven lengths These are rapidly fitted together in a horizontal position by means of wooden keys and iron guys which latter can be used as handrails by those ascending or descending By means of a small which attached to the carriage of the ladder and heavy counterpoise weights the ladder is next raised to a vertical position and can then be ascended It is so weighted that without leaning against any support it will allow seven men to ascend it at the same time. The trial yesterday afternoon was very successful and it is intended to have another and more public one in Collins street near the Town hall at 4 p.m. on Friday The 21st annual meeting of the Melbourne Philharmonic Society was held at the Atho farm last evening There was a large attendance of members about half of those present being ladies The report which was considered very satisfactory stated that five subscription concerts had been given during the year besides a concert in conjunction with Madame Goddard and a complimentary concert at which the society assisted to Mr W S Lyster Thomemberswerecongratulated upon the steady improvement made in their choral singing as shown in the concerts referred to. The financial results of the concerts had been on the whole satisfactory A hope was expressed that efforts would be made to increase the subscription list during the ensuing year so as to place the leading musical society of Australasia in a position to study the convenience of its subscribers more fully The treasurer's statement showed that the receipts for the year had been 119 17s 8d and the expenditure £9.38 15s 9d leaving a balance to the credit of the society of £192 2s 7d The liabilities of the society were stated at £10 10s and the assets at £618 8s 10d The report and balance sheet were unanimously adopted.
