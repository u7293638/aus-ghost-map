What RJLmit has done Charter? Tpwers can do if the wretched crpwd of batchers and ignora Phases who nqy le^d the town ate pat aside and let the intelligence of the field /»me to the front aoij take its natural jp.ace. The Miners' Association has #3*&inits; ranks the right material for effecting this rrfonn| and we trust thejr will not gpt lost iff. mere squabbles abOat hot will rise to a due comprehen sio11 of *Mr real work-to ratae, educate and consolidate thar class. Thin is work I? yhieh all enlightened citizens can heanjUy co-operate. T?e Chamber of Commerce has proved 1 it is cf some use. The Minister for j Works, owing to the representations made by that b^dy consented to open the railway at the Bardekln contrary to'his Brat intentions. Tie Chamber will be called on again to ^tddiess the Minister' and in connection with Oris railway. Messrs. BASHFORD and .Go., intend, we arp informed, to strip the Bridge In less' than a month. Hie traffic most as a ,consequence be diverted to some other route. It will not be possible for any y heele^ vehicles to pass the Bridge whilst undergoing the repairs necessary P° #fc it to; cai-iy the eailway. The only W*y open to the traffic will be the old crossing known as Hamilton's crossing. This will involve a detonr of four miles, and the road (being long disused is out ftp repair, and since the late rains is cut ap into deep trenches and caverns. To pat that four miles of road into repair now wpnld cost some thousands of ponnds. It is clear that expedient for traffic cannot be entertained. The con tractois, Messrs. BASHFORD and Co., asked the Divisional Board to co-operate with them in providing for the traffic they are willing to open the station at this side of the Bridge, though Mr. Mac eossax said they were not If 'they could undertake to cross the traffic on tl^> Bridge at the same time the difficulty vpuld be met. The Board are to «rfr the Government to open the line at this side, and to inform %m of the wi'ling&ess; of the contractors to consent to that ar rangenjent. Tke co-operation of the Mayor is also invited, If the Govern ment should deqliip to accede to this ,'eV$?!: Hne?*iott will remain Hor '? % to be crossed t There is auqtijer alternative, which, in the event P? the ^ejection of the proposal of the Divisional Board by the Government, the Chamber of Commerce should take op.

Whatever arrangements; aie made for the Bridge, whether the; contmc^ wUl iww die lsaffic by the Dtvifljouiil Board should undertake at once. The Bavenswood Board can Ue day. There should be afpenal meeting of die Oifiocnd Board called, and a sum of money dioald be voted lor making that crossing. The. Ckmrndpnt should also tie afskfed to suppte^ytmt tlMi vote, for they have no lor stop~the traffic on a S'lO'cHia where it pltaifej 'wilUit supplying p substitate of some kind. let them help to make Mhe&tfkq;&ijg.; aboveor below die bridge, and Aey will act ^rly by the district We understand Mr. Mac ROSSAS premised Mr, Dkank £300 for this pucpofe. Why was not this said opecJyt It is all of a piMe Miiir tbe hole-and-corner work of the MACROB SAH faction here. Nothing open, tutt< ing above board, he sneaka in here like " a thief In the night," and vanishes at cock crow like a ghost. He whispers to l ie faitbfnl few what he, ftg mighty engineer is going to do, how he is going to give Baolabd fits if those Baldwin's consolidated engines do uiit jo inp the Demon's Pinch to his satisfaction, for having been trained in the first engineer's office in Donegal, the member for ToWnsrille in a high authority on all railway matters, from a bag of Wl^ from the Grent Wosteiji to die carves and grades at the Demon's Slide on the Bordektn -Range, He may pope before the yokefoas a railway gmmt, and tipll it to the "marines* from Ttppeeary or Donegal, bat he outnofe lie to stop oar traffic^ great man as he -«£ with impunity. He is subject to a good deal of pressure. His "Irishtail" at the Jonetion is sqooexing him" to let the line stop there * while longer, there is another <'tul " at tbe Bardeidn> how the Huoliob u4 DEAS e " tail'*' wags is not easy to tell, but that it does wag Ib beyond question. The carriers with whom Mr. MackossaK is intimately connected are anothet " tail/' and thfey pray to Macbmbah to blast the railway to the moon. The people of Charters Towers have nothing to do with MAC BOSSAS's tails, loi^g or short They want their . goods here without vexations delays, or exorbitant rates. This can be done if the Minister show the same willingness to oblige the people o* Charters Towers as the contraction Messrs. Bashpord and Co. show. Mr. Macrossak took over the section to the J unction from Messrs. MCSHARRT 0'Pog8KK long beloretheir time wJ op. Why did he assume that Mean. BASHFORD and Co. would he unwilling to give any accommodation to the public {hiring the repairs of the Bridge 1 Was it to depredate them by comparison with Messrs. MCSHARBY and O'KoukkeI The offer of the former to open at this side, and to carry the traffic whilst the works are in progress, proves how augenerons and unfounded was the supposition. The people of Chartera Towers can appteciate the accommodation which the contrac tors are offering. The bodies who are entrusted with the money of the rate payers, should show they deserve the trust by voting the public money for an object which all most commend-the speedy transit of the tnffib Whether it is given to Messrs Bashford and CO.. or spent on a new crossing above the fa 00 consequence to tlm general public. The main thiog is the . traffic should be kept open, ftnj at ordin ary rates. ' The Chamber of Cotnmerae can help in this matter, and shoald at onoe Cor the purpose.
