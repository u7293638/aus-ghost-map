THE TEMPTED SISTEES. BY THE AUTHOR 01' ' NOIIA,' ?:' SUE ?WOULD BE AN ACTJIESS,' &C.; (From the Penny Miscellany.) Chapter XT. THE REMOVAL— -TUB. WEDDING— THE BANKRUPTCY ? THE STEWARDSHIP — THE PARTING. Gilbert Bertram, after his .passionate and hasty rejection of the band of Blanche, returned home in no very en viable state of mind. He certainly lelt that he bad reason able grounds for acting as he bud done,' but still his heart was ill at ease. - ' He had loved her fondly and deeply, and he could not iii.a moment, shake off a tie so firmly rivetted. His mother ' made no comment on, what had passed, though in her heart she was not surprised, for she had so bad an opinion of Hugh do Cressey and his eldest daughter that she could hot believe that any good thing could be connected with .thorn. , ? She saw her son's 'daily increasing dejection witli alarm ; his pursuits were one by one abandoned ; his name became a rarity in the literary world, and he was fast sinking into the aimless, idle life which tends more than any other to Keep open .tno --,.: wounus given , to we heart, by, blows such as he had received. Mrs Bertram proposed their leaving London. In listless apathy he consented. She asked him where he would like ? to go. ? ?,. v ? ... ' He did not care. All places were - alike to him,' he said. 'His mother rejoiced at this, for she had a plan in her heat), and this docility went a long way in i(s furtherance. Gilbert's native place was a little town on the borders of- Scotland, and be fore he became known as an author he had often visited it, for Scorwick ahd its rugged beauty were, very dear to ? him, until his mother's failing health rendered warmer air necessary, and they went into Cornwall, where he met Blanche de Cressey, when, of course, he . imme diately considered Stonphurst, with its ? . blue sea and fairy-like scenery, the most, lovely place in the known world. Now, however, when his mother pro posed his retiring with her to Scorwick for a time, she met with no opposition. He would have gone anywhere so that Already ho was feeling .the full force of her uncle's words — ' For every bit ter pang you have made her 'Suffer your own heart shall be wrung tenfold ;' and he felt that death would be preferable to the. utter desolation of mind and pros tration of body he was then enduring. Mrs Bertram had a motive in her se lection of a residence. She had made a match for her aon in her own mind years ago, and the object ox Her cnoice lived in his native place. Marian Morton was the orphan daughter of a clergyman in the neigh bourhood, who was distantly related to, the Bertrams. Marian lost both her parents when' she was but very young, and Mrs Ber tram had taken charge of her till she was able to earn her own living, which she commenced doing at the early , age of seventeen, as a governess. She was a gentle, affectionate girl,, and warmly loved her benefactress, who exerted herself to procure a comfortable situation, and was rewarded by seeing her installed in the house of the; lady of the manse with whom she had remained ever since. Mrs Bertram had in her own ., mind fixed upon Marian as her son's wife, and it was very evident to her motherly eyes that the young girl loved Gilbert dearly. She ventured once to hint to him how. much she would like her foster child for a daughter in reality. 'Nonsense, mother,' he said. ' Marian is my little sister ; she would not have me if I asked her ; and besides, she is not the wife fo'r me.' ' Ah, my boy, I am afraid you will be looking too high,' his mother said. t SJUe would make you a good wife/' ? ' Yes, mother, I know all that.,: Ac cording to your creed she would lie ,the best of wives. That is to say, I should always have a' dutiful, obedient wife ; should never know when washing-day came round, or ever see a shirt without a button, or a dirty fire-side. All very nice, mother mine, but I want more than that.' , ' . ? ,? His mother, good, matt'er-of-fact soul, wondered what' on earth a man could want more ; and there the matter rested. ' - '? Now, however, there was an oppor tunity for her to resume her favourite theme, and she accordingly did so a very short time after they were settled at' Scovwick. Miss Morion had been spending the evening with them and Mrs Bertram took occasion' to advert' to, her improvement both mental and bodily since they had la£t seen. her, and again hinted to her son that she thought Alaiiim loved him. 'j Oh, mother ! let me hear no more about it,' he said at length. ' I have no heart for any one. , I could not make any womanjiappy with the remembrance of another constantly between us. Were she dead,1' he was going to add, ' it would be a different case,' but his mo ther suddenly interrupted him.. ' Look upon her as dead ! For she is dead to you. l'alse ! , Wicked ! ? ' ' Stop, mother,' her son interposed. ' Say' not another word. Wo will speak of this again.' ? And hastily bidding her good-night, he retired to his room. Long1' and bitterly he reflected upon his mother's words. 'Does .Marian love me ??' he asked himself. ' I want nothing now but duty in a wife, and if ? ' lie pau sed, for the image of Blanche in all her loveliness' rose to his mind, aud the very thought, of another seemed a sin ; but with the remembrance of her came the thought of her falsehood and all she had made, him suffer,, and his heart hardened. ' I will marry Marian, ' he said to himself, ' Twill have a quiet home, if, I cannot have happiness. I'shall please my mother ; and as for her — well, hea ven helping me, I will be a good and a true husband to her. ' No sooner was his mind made up than he was all anxiety to put his design in execution, or to find himself in some way for its fulfilment, as if he feared his resolution might give way. He did not go to bed but paced his room till 1UUI 1U1IJ£. His mother remarked it, and he said shortly— '_' I was thinking of what you said to me. I will marry Miss Morton. ' Mrs Bertram would have expressed her pleasure at the announcement in a flood of small talk, but her son stopped her with — 'If you have any love for me, mother, you will not speak of it again. ' She nevnr did speak of it, but she wondered and rejoiced at his sudden determination. - *i. He lost no time in addressing Marian, whose happiness in the fulfil ment of her secret wishes,' which she had long considered hopeless, blinded her to the fact that no heart went with the hand so suddenly offered. She came to her future mother-in-law in the evening, all smiles and joyful tears ; and Gilbert was kind— very kind — and his mother so loving and gentle, and she thought no woman ever had so bright a future. She little thought that another's image stood between her and her be trothed husband, and knew nothing of the bitter agony that wrung his heart as he sat listening to her loving words. She was not the wife for him, and he knew it, but she had given him her whole heart, and he would not trifle with it. Gilbert Bertram was an ( honourable man, and not for worlds would he have his future wife know what a fragment of a heart he brought her. The wedding was fixed for a very early day, for Marian had no need for delay. Sho had but to give notice to her kind mistress. n.nrl mrao to her, now home, for they were to reside with Mrs Bertram, who remained at the request of both ; the young bride begging it be cause she was deeply attached to her, and her son from a feeling of dread at his future life, which he felt his mother's presence would render more endurable. The wedding day came at last, after a month of busy preparation to tho widow, of joyful anticipation to the happy bride elect, and of maddening re collections to Gilbert, who contrived during tho greater part of tho tiiho to absent himself on the plea of business. The sun was shining cheerily' on a bright morning in the early spring, when, the simple bridal party passed down tho qine' street of Scorwick. It was a primitive little town,' and people walked to their weddings there.' A carriage and pair would have thrown ,the good people into a, fever of 'excite-'! mont, and caused a sensation it .would have taken a week to subdue. , , , A friend of Mrs Bortrarn's was to give the bride away, and they had ,no other company. ._ , ' She was' very simply dressed ; a.ficli dove- coloured &ilk;, with a white bonnet', and delicate lace shawl — all the gifts 'of the lady with whom she had lived 'so long-1— became her well ; and with the flush of happy excitement giving colour to her usually pale- face, and lighting up her soft , brown eyes, Mai ian ' looked really handsome, and many pcoplo thought, as they saw them togothor, that they had seldom seen a bettor .ma ted couple, as far as looks went. They were soon at the little church, followed by a great many of their neigh bours, who, like all country folk, invari ably attended ' weddings, christenings, and funerals, from' sheer Inck of excite ment from the world without. They reach the altar, and the service commences. ' And, forsaking all other, cleave thon only unto her as long as ye both shall live.' How these solemn. words in our beau tiful marriage service ring in. Gilbert's euii-, iwju ruuftu u.1'11 u» Ji Hum it , uii-uuj. Forsaking all other ! How hollow they sound ; and even now, there, before the altar, rises a vision of a fair head, with its' coronal of golden,. curls, and blue eyes, looking ' lovingly into his. How often had be pictured to himself his wedding-day, and in fancy- adorned., that fair head with a bridoUwrejth. '*? * ' Too late ! too late !''be' murmured to himself, and for'one wild moment he felt as if lie must rush from the chirrch and hide himself anywhere; go he cared not whither, to escape this hated mar riagc. One glance at the trembling- girl be side him restored him to himself. ' Heaven help me !' he murmured ; and he vowed inwardly to be to her all a husband should. . „ . A few. moments more and the service is over, and he turns from the altar a married man ; aud Marian, all smiles and blushes, is receiving the congratula tions of those about her as Mrs Ber tram. They adjourn to the vestry to sign their names, while the bells in the old fashioned tower strike up a merry peal, each tone of which falls , like molten lead on Gilbert's heart. Marian remembered afterwards that the lips which touched hers were as cold' as ice ! Chapter XII.1 ' , THE RECOGNITION— THE .CONSPIRACY ? THE STORY. Time rolled on, and the stirring world of London' wondered what had become of the gifted author, whose hand had wielded the pen so skilfully — who day by day had touched the heart with some trouthful picture or pleased the laucy with some witty sketch. They would scarce have known- 'their idol could they see Gilbert Bertram now.' The pale grave man, in that tiny cottage, in yonder little town, is surely not the lively, witty, clever writer, who so electrified the fashionable world. 'Tis even so ; all thought of ambition seems to have' died within him, perished with his crushed hopes. Rumour, with its hundred tongues, is busy in Scorwick about the family, who receive no com pany and seldom go out. Marian feels there is something want in-r in linr husband. Ho is verv; kind and gentle, but her home is not what 'she pictured it in her young dreams; and her cheek grows pale and her step heavy, and busy tongues begin to talk, and officious friends begin to whisper . that — ' Surely young Mr Bertram is not kind to his wife. ' That was not true, however ; he was very kind. He faithfully kept the vow he had made,, 'to be to her alia hus band should be ; ' but there lacked something. Marian could feel what, though she could not express it,' and she shed many bitter tears over her dis appointment.' v^SS^.iEE≫ The. first year of their married life passed slowly away, and the returning . spring brought with it a* lovely babo to cheer her drooping spirits. With what joy and pride she looked upon her boy, who had his father's fea-' lures, and she rejoiced to' sec that Gil bert seemed to turn with great affection to the child, who parly learned to know his voice and smile in his face. , When tho little Honry was nearly a year old, a grent misfortune fell upon his parents. His father's savings, to gether with a- smnll annuity of his grandmother's, were all swept away by the breaking' of a bank — one of those monstrous swindles which from timo to time astonish the world, and'cnrich two or three scoundrels by the ruin' or hun dreds of honest folk. '' ' It happened at a snd time for ' the .Bertrams, for Gilbert's long failing health had at last given way, and ho was prostrated by a low -fover, which the shock of the news aggravated to such an extent that for many days Marian and her mother watched by what they thought his dying bed. He recovered slowly to find himself a mined man ; and though a -kind : letter from a.publisbing firm 'with whom he had been connected awaited ? him, ex pressing sorrow for his misfortune, and offering half the money down for a se ,rialvnovel, to bo completed at an easy rate of work, hs found his overwrought mind quite unequal to tho task. Many times he took up his pen to write in vain ; the thoughts would1 not come ;. and he seriously retarded his recovery by his grief aud anxiety at tho him fur support. It was at this time that lie felt the full 'value of his. devoted wife. , All that woman could do she did to lessen liis trials. She cheered, encouraged, and helped him on, till at length the book was commenced, and his name once more before the world. From that time he roused himself, ? nnd became again by degrees .strong and energetic. He found, however, that they were in very straightened circumstances, and hearing of a gentleman in the south of England who was in want' of a steward, lie applied for the office, and through the ??influence of some of his former friends he obtained it. There was a time when his pride would have, revolted against taking such a situation. lie cared no more for mixing with the gay world, and he had a : wife and: child' to support. Their preparations for leaving Scor wick were soon made, and the new, year following the birth of their child, saw them settled in their new home. It was a prcttv spot. Their cottage with its cheerful garden, overlooked the whole of Plymouth Bay, than which no lovelier sea view can be found in England. Little did he think that the splendid mansion whose gleaming turrets caught the earliest rays of the sun, which lit up his little study so cheerily, held her who had been at once the hope and the blight of his existence — for whose dear sake he would once have laid down his life, and who, '.when, be thought himself most blessed, bad turned and stung him to madness. Littlo did Blanche' think, in her almost princely home, that from the very windows of her boudoir she could overlook the home of him she loved and mourned with all a woman's passionate devotion. It was better for all parties that they did not know it. Tboname of Hilton was not. uncom- mon in; that part of the country,: and Gilbert had never heard of the ^purchase of lleardon. - The only person who sus pected the real state of the case was Marian, and with a woman's instinct she at once divined that the beautiful ! heir- ess she had often heard of but; never met, was the same Blanche de Cressey whose treachery had made her husband the wreck of his former self. Sho had heard the story, but she never told him she knew it, and now that she bad made this fresh discovery, like a wise woman she held her tongue. ,She was a generous, warm-hearted creature, ? and she loved her. husband devotedly ; and in their quiet home they were very happy. The soft air of the south, however, did not agree with Marian — she drooped and faded daily, aud Gilbert was . con triving in his own mind the means of procuring for her change of air, when a. succession of circumstances prevented it.' , The property of which he had charge belonged 'to a gentleman, who seldom visited it, as he preferred residing on - the continent — and tho new steward found liis ollica no sinecuro'. Poachers and gipsies infested the grounds ; and as one part of the estate abutted on the sea, there was a good opportunity for smugglers/or thoso who bore that character, to carry on their nefarious practice unchecked. 'News way daily brought to tho cot Inge of depredations committed in some portion or other of the domains', and as Gilbert had strict injunctions about the preservation ' of game, ho had to keep up a' strong force of keepers. Shots were frequently heard at the house, aud on one occasion when they hod been there scarce a month, a man was seriously wounded close by, and brought in, and the fright and agitation had such an effect on Marian as to ren der her seriously ill, and she was obliged to keep her bed. Tho doctor who was called did not diaguise from her husband that the case was serious ; he told him thero wns a strong tendency to consumption, and that unless site were removed where she could havo perfect quiet of mind and bodjr, it would become too deeply rooted to admit of remedy, Gilbert heard the news with dismay. Just as he was beginning to feel a tranquility' ho never hoped for, a now trouble seemed to be hovering over him'. Was he never to know happiness again ? Was his wife to be Fnatched from him just as ho was learning her worth ? It ?'? seemed so, and he resolved, to move her without delay, even if it cost him his situation. He told her of his plan that evening as they sat by her bedroom fire, and' they indulged in many happy anticipa tions of the future: Marian had so many plans of what she should do ' when she was well again,'1 and Gilbert, though he looked at her with a pang at his heart, joined , cheerily in 'her' lively expectations. -'; : They talked on, till fearful of weary ing her too much, he was leaving her to retire to rest, when a hurried knock came to the door, and William, the head- hooper, presented himself; with the intelligence that smugglers were known to be on shore, and that suspiciouslook ing characters had been seen about the park. ' Two have just passed me,' the man said. ' I will go and look at them,' replied Gilbert. ' They look harmless enough,'1 Wil - liain said, ' but I am sure they are here for no good.' Gilbert desired the man to wait a minute, and. running upstairs, told his wife and mother not to sit' up for him. Marian and Mrs Bertram joined in entreaties .that he would remain at home, but to no purpose. ' ' Duty called him,' he- said, 'and theve would be no danger.'' He gaily told his wife not to spoil her beauty by waiting for him, and his laugh1 was the last sound she heard, a3 the door closed after him. Little did the loving wife think that the farewell so lightly spoken would be' for ever, that never more in this .world would she look upontheface she loved with such deep affection, that the light step would return to her no more; or the loving smile greet her till the last eter nal meeting. Gilbert and the keeper turned away from the little garden of the cottage, and walked slowly into the park. ' 1 The moonlight was shining full upon the many windows of Reardon, and he pointed it out to William. ' A fine specimen of a thoroughly English country seat,' said he. ' Ay,' was the reply. ' The poor gentleman did not live long to enjoy it, though. He has only been thero three years, and now he is dead. It seems a pity for a man to spend such a heap o' money for so short a time.' ' Who is the heir? ' asked Gilbert. ' Oh, there's no heir. It all goes to a young lady, his niece — such a beauty. Sho will be a match for any lord in the land, though they do say she will have nought to say to any of them. ? Mr Hilton was a careful man, and he had a power o' money by all accounts.' 3Ir Hilton! — a young lady! Alight was beginning to break in upon his mind. ?
