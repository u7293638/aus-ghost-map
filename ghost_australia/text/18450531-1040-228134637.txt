SONNET. Self-vindicatory, and by way of Appendix to the "Sonnets dedicated to Senators." Fat Fudge, the Publican (and sinner), o'er His counter swears, I'm told, that I, the present Writer of these particularly pleasant Squib Sonnets, for some by-gone private sore Hate patriot Wentworth; and that therefore And therfore only, have in verse his public Character trounced so,—till 't is like a cub sick!— And more I learn, that some believe this lie. To purge even these then, of such "perilous stuff," (As Boys are disabused 'mongst whom a fuss Is started about bugbears, ghosts, or other lies,) It is, or ought to be, methinks, enough For me to simply state the matter thus;-- I only hate all Rogues, political or otherwise! AUSTRALICUS.
