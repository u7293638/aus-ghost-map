a lay of an ancient hen. Yes. I am a lazy, fat old lien, The pet of (lie fanner's wife; I've never reared a family Or laid -but one ore in my life. I never get up in the morning till ten. And I go to roost at four. With a crop chuck-full of the finest corn- New, what could a hen want moreV There's some of my Bisters get up with the dawn, While the grass with tho dew is still wet, And 'conic home with some very marvellous talcs Of the wonderful worms they get; But once when I tried the plan myself ' (It was foolish to be so hold), Wliv all that I got for three hours', work Whs a horrible nasty cold. But now I wait till the air is warm, And the ground nil nice and dry, So if you notice an early bird. You can bet that it is not I. They may call me a lazy, fat old lien. But 1 know when I give up the ghost, They will bury my body decently, For I am fur too tough to roast. So take my advice, young hens and old, And don't get up too soon, Just lollow my plan— eat all you can. Ami go to roost at noon. . II is only a common, ignorant hen That is scraping about all day! Just eat like me, and you'll very soon see Why keeping old liens don't pay. —"Feathered World."
