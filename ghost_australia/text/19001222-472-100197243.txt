A Ghost Story. A sweop had been employed by a farmer, who lived in an extremely lonely spot. It was late when his work was finished, and he asked permission to sleep in the barn. This was readily granted. In tho night the Bweop was aroused from his peaceful slumbers by hearing the barn door cautiously open. He looked up and saw two men enter, who at onoe set down proceeded to fill two sacks with the farmer's best malting barley. ' If,' said one of tho thieves, ' wo ha-l someone to hold the lantern up, we shouldn't be long.' ' No,' agreed the other j ' wish we bad someone.' ' I'll hold tho light for you,' offered the sweep, coming forward politoly. The men turned. Thoir hair rose on end at the supposed apparition. With a blood curdling yell, they both rushed from the barn. Not till next morning did it dawn on the sweep that the two men had mistaken him for his Satanic Majesty, or one of his angel?. ' No more barley was taken from that barn.
