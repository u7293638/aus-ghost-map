? bales' & ^ketfelicp^; THE GUINEA BOX. B | In Two Chaptebs. Pi |- Chapter 1. i'' i Nothing is more common jn:these;' daya^ than to see advertisements at the libraries^ ,of ' a guinea box' to hire at this or that theatre for the evening. They probably belong to shareholders who : have agreed to take a portion:* of their dividends in that shape, or_to families who have got iireQ.of going - to the play sooner than they thought they should, and are glad to get back some portion of their luxurious if as young such things were less common, and there was a certain ?' guinea box'.' at, Covent Garden for which three or four guineas were sometimes given by reason of the would-be hirers applying for it contemporaneously on . some popular night ; for the box 'though holding only six, was an excellent box in the grand, tier, with a little withdrawing-room at tached to it, where you. could have re freshments .' in ; private, and those who were, acquainted with such matters know that Box J.6 at a guinea was a great bar gain. Yet it was always advertised to, te lo£ at* that price,-'and never by any chance occupied by ica legitimate owners.. The matter was openly discussed in- play going society at that time, .but it had never reached my ears: when I was at school at Blackheath, at, never mind what date, but during a certain December, in - which my father's lawyer, Mr Tredgold, sent me an invitation, to spend Saturday and Sunday with him. in tovvp,. and accompany his. family to. the theatre. .'..?';: „.. . : : , ; My undo and guardian, Mr Ralph Tressillian, lived in, , the far north of England, and I had no connections nor any friends in London, so. that the proposition was even a greater treat than it' would have been to m'oBt school boy's. Moreover, it waa enhanced by the1 fact that Lucy Tredgold- waB : a very 'pretty girl, whom I thought most'charming, and' whom I believe was! created to be my bride — though. in that case, she had. been created a little too early, for I was but sixteen at the time I speak, and she .was twenty-one. .That; 'however,' was the only ' difference (though^ of course;' it ' had' always' ' existed); that -had ' ever h&pV; period between us; moreover, I was till, and tolerably' mature-looking ' ; for ' my years, with quite a' distinct line of fluff on my upper lip,arid in my new tail-coat, which I was to near that evening 'for ? the firstrtime, might 'have been taken,,.! d&t;^red myself,' for' ah/ undergraduate of inW rTniversity,' or,' a gentleni^n .'

My guardian,' as it' happened, had1 an', especial objection to theatrical exhibitions of. all ?sorts ; so that, though I would not have had it known to Lucy for millions, ? this waa the 'first occasion of my. introduction to a theatre. To hear me talk,; /however, Irflatter myself you would have thought I had. a seat in the 'omnibus box' for years ;, and,' after all* it is far more reason able' that 'a young; fellow .should wish to represent himself a little .older than he is, than an old man should. ,iapej, being young. 'In the7fprmer;caseit;iB;a sor.t. of natural defence, since inexperience and simplicity are always looked down upon, j t' The, play wtuch.we -were about;, to! wit-; ness 'Hamlet,' I was perhapsjbetter ac-. quaintedftith than any of the party. . They ? consisted, (.wholly of MrTredgold's family — ; namely, his wife,....,thr.ee,i daughters (of: ?whom my charmer. wag. the' youngest), and' a son, Gilbert Tredgold, of about :,twenty! years of age. They were not giving to j reading, and (with ,ono exception, which I need hot indicate), struck me as common place ; but they were ?.very kind, as was' the host himself, and 1 enjoyed their! hospitality very much. 'Mr Tredgold did '. not go to the play, having, certain papers, ' he said, to look over; These were repor- j ted, however, by his offsprings to be only newspapers. Papa could never by any chance, they said ; be induced to move after dinner, and he only made business i an excuse for stopping ' at home. Good- ; ness knows I didn't want him to go, and ' should have been very wellcontent to have corted Lucy alone. Yet, for all my ttndresse for her, I looked forward to the , play itself, I remember, with quite as much pleasure as to her companionship, . , which showed what a mere hobbledehoy X was after all. W,e dined early ' and arrived at the theatre in good time, which gave us an opportunity of admiring the box with its drawing-room. So far as I knew, every box had this addition to it, but I learned from what was said that this was not so, and that No 16 was a great bargain. It was next but one to the grand tier, and held four chairs on front and two behind very comfortably. At firBt the ladies occupied- the former, but G ilbert Tred gold ?was very near-sighted, and, presently to my delight, Lucy changed 'places with him, so that I had her all to myself. The dear creature was sublimely ignorant of the plot of the piece (a - rare thing in those days, when Shakespeare' was much more acted, if not read, than he is at .present), so. that I had .plenty to tell her, :,andi(f was told (Sia-,aa itigt to^disturb @a ;'auaiencerfiv'a wiry low fone/^he ghost jpf Hamlet's father had f in; tore'stod^me limme.riaetyTdn his brst appear jmceV but, as, soon as this change of poaition. w^s effected; mylintereat ih,the, drama began to fail. -.;,'?'' ' The- touch' of Lucy's hand— for *?'! ven tured to place my own upon.it occasionally, to emphasise my ? explanations— Bent,, a thrill through me such as a spectre could not compass. ; and ' as to Ophelia, I felt that I had an Ophelia .of. my own, worth two i xof ?; her^ arid that there would cer tainly be no necessity, bo far as I was concerned, for her to go: out of - her mind or drown herself. :, ? -?;?;. ...'?'., \ The play had not proceeded far when, ?to my great surprise, . the door between ,our. box and the ..retiring : room ' was suddenly opened without noise, and in walked a lady of great beauty. She was tall and very dark ; her dress : was much more splendid than that of any of the Tredgold young ladies, and I par ticularly noticed that on her jot-black hair, which was arranged in a manner I : had. never before seen, there, was a circlet of diamonds on which the rays from the. I chandelier sparkled like fiie. . She looked neither to the left or; right, but moved straight on with a majestic ,8 weep of her white satin train to the chair on which I sat. I rose at once (for politeneas was not among the extras at our Blackheath Semi nary), and made room for her. . : . . ? : . She took the proffered seat rather coolly, a3 1 thought (butlwas totally unacquainted with the manners of fine ladies), and with out even the acknowledgment of a bow. What was still stranger, she took no notica of the Tredgolds, nor they of her. ? They retained their seats and gazed on the stage just as though there had been no increase in the. number of the occupants of the box. 'Vyith regard to those in the front ? row, I thought it quite possible ! that they were, unaware of her presence, though the trail of her satin dress upon the carpet had been quite distinct to my ear ; but the wonder was that Lucy herself seemed unconscious , of having a new companiqn beside her. ' She knew, however, I had risen, for she inquired softly , so as not to interfere with the tones of the actors^— !;. },^, What's, the matter, Frank? Can't you see';?'..-',' ',,.:.'?'.,', '??

I knew thatshewas talking about me, and not very pleasantly, but , my ] whole, attention was absorbed by the lady. in white satin. She 'did, not 'take the, least notice of the movement in the boxj nor of the. perfor- mers on the stage ; but . gazed straight before her into a vacancy with a most sad and, as it seemed.tb me, the most self-! reproachful1 face. I had, heard of the.' impassive frigidity of the aristocracy, bat, if that was their manner/:I: preferred :thatj of the middle classes ; her mute indiffer ence seemed to l freeze . my 'very blood. ! Then some one took me by,, the arm and whispered roughly : ' ' 'What the deuce is the matter with you, ' Frank ? You have quite frightened my sister.'' . ' ' ' ' . -: ; 'V:i, '? ?''; ??'' : , ? It was Gilbert Tredgold, who had been civil enough up to this time; though I fan ciedlie had once or twice given himself airs over me on the strength of his four years' . seniority. . He spoke to me now as a man ; would speak to a foolish boy who had been playing, some prank, and' I felt very indiahant. . ''Ihave frightened nobody,' I replied, : .'but I think it is strange — and rather ,rude — that no one has introduced me to this lady ; though , indeed she has much more to complain of it, if it comes to that, than I have.' , ? 'What lady1? You are dreaming Frank. There's no one here except ourselves.' 'Hush,'~said I ; . 'she must hear every! word we say, though she appears so ah-, stracted.

I went straight back. to Mr Tredgold, and found the. old gantleman still over his papers— the evening ones; ,, . ' Good gracious ! are you all come back already?',', he, exclaimed, peevishly. It was, perhaps, excusable, since the old gentleman had hoped to have a quiet even ing to himself ; but I began to think that the family rudeness was hereditary. 'No, sir,' I answered, 'no one has come back except me. I have been grossly insulted by, your son Gilbert.' ' Stuff and nonsense !' he said ; 'Gil- bert never insults anyone. Whatever his faults, he is a most good-natured young fellow, though a little hasty in his temper. Now tell me what has happened. You look excited. 1 am afraid you took a glass of wine or so at dinner more: than you have been accustomed to.' That wa3 very true, for at my Black heath school, wine was an extra, though politeness was not ; but I certainly had not taken too much wine.

I didn't care about it myself, I told her, so much,' as I thought it unkind ; but that they should have all agreed to ignore; the presence of their.lady visitor showed, I thought, bad feeling. '_'My dear Mr Garrard,' she said, with quite unwonted severity, 'I had hoped -you - had made up your mind to say nothing about that unpleasant subject ; let bygones be bygones, I do beg.' s ' I had no idea (at that time) that a -young woman could speak so sharply.

'Agnes was very much shocked, at him,' shecontinu'ed, with a smile ; 'but after wards,' you' know, upon expressing hia sorrow, she forgave him.' ' I think she even gave him a kiss,?' said .1 boldly,' but in a very tender voice. ;: ??=? ' ' I don't remember that,' she answered, looking at her toes. ' Agnes was rather ?prudish in that way.' ;? :-':: ?,,??'?? ' ? Which, of course, wa3 ah invitation j and_ so ended very pleasantly my ex perience of the Guinea Box for that time.' Chapter II. ' . ' If it is true that there is 'no such thing as forgetting,' it is certain that ? we so often mislay the remembrance of things that it is almost aa bad (or good) as though we did forget. : ? ? \, '. ? My adventure with the lady in satin was .certainly noteworthy enough, yet week by week, month by month, it faded as her satin itself would havedone, till in a few years after the thing had happened, I could not have sworn to the details as when they were fresh in my memory. : I met the Tredgolds from time to time, and when a 'sly allusion, as sometimes happened, was made to the. circumstance, I found, myself replying to their asper sions with less' and Ies3 vigour. I knew I had not been drunk ; I knew I had not been unreasonably excited by the play, and yet that muoh- wronged lady in white became in a certain degree unreal even to myself/ ? It was ' still one of those ex periences that one cannot explain (and which happen to more of us than care to confess to them) ; but I no longer oudgled my brains for an explanation of it. The circumstance was still very strange, but (which had not struck me so forcibly in my boyhood) it was almost as much so that a respectable family like the Tred golds should have treated a ' lady visitor with such rudeness, and that they should make ajestofit. ;: ;: .. : Seven years afterward^ arid whet* I had just taken my degree at the University, I was dining with some friends at the Oxford and Cambridge Club, one of whom happened to propose a -visit'.' to Covent Garden Theatre. As the office was closed, he sent out to the librarian's for' a box, and when it caaie he observed1— -JiT 'By Jove, this is : a cheap Business j we.havegot the'Guinea Boxj' ,, :,rrA/ ?«!?? jiiHp iiwaflj a man about town; i'andknewi No. 16 ; but upon the rest of us it ; made no impression ? -.-?,:'. h /?.

'?','?'- Aa I spoke the words the whble ; scene of severiyears before recurredto me with vivid distinctness. I saw the Tredgolds unconscious, wilfully as I had thought, of the intruder's presence. I saw Lucy touch her brother, and heard him whisper in that quick, remonstranfrvoice, ??? What the duce is the matter with you ?',- Only this time it was somebody else said it. One of my companions, had taken hold of my arm, and. the rest were staring at me while I stared at thelady.

He led me unresistingly into the street, and we walked around Covent Garden together, discussing, the matter. I told my Mend what had happened on the! previous occasion, and he pretended to explain my present hallucination, as he termed it, by the association of ideas. ' You recognised the box, and then the scene recurred to you.' There was something in that (for tho scene had recurred to me), but riot enough to shake the evidence of my own senses a second, time.
