CHAPTER III. :. JJhown contin,uod, to creop, throjugli life; every day sorvlng him. to accumulate justifyingreasons for present and future inactivity, lie had, fortunately, fallen intot honest hands ; for shortly after the accident narrated ia our last, chapter, no was rocci veil into tho family or a smalj tradesman, who, relieving our helpless hero of his new perplexity— that of laying out his own money on his own wants — gave him board and bed for tho interest of liis inheritance, he slumbering through twenty years of his existence, with no more thought of the world around him — of its cares and its delights, than the counter of Jeremy Quick, his indefatigable lundlonl. Brown, according t.- tho theory of philosophers, was already wearing his third noso from tlio ditto of tho assault by Butcherly and his friends, that ia, upwards of twenty years had clupse.d sinco that memorahhi catas trophe, when Jeremy Quick, with his shiiu'ng, prosperous face, and his blithe, chirping voice, entered the room of pur hero with a gay 'Good-morning.' , 'Good-morning, Mr. Quick;!' said Brown laying down a morning paper — a journal that had twenty limes performed tho noisome feat of devouring his own words, but which was still the oracle of Brown, for the bent of Reasons — he never had read any other paper. -. . Mr. Quick drow a chair opposite to Brown, and seat ing himself, with his clupsed fingers in his lap, and a more than usually lustrous smile on his smooth countenance ho looked benignantly in the face of his lodger, cleared his throat, and said, ' Mr, Brown, we havo now been together in this house upwards pf twenty years.' ' . ''.Twenty yours, Mr. Quick. It quite seems to mo that 1 havo never lived in any othor,' said Brown. 'A charming house !' ' Tolerably well,' said Quick ; ' but tho fact is, I came to tell you that I am about to givo up the house/' Brown started and looked gravo at this piece of.iiitpllir gonce— for it threatened his repose. Could a spider comprehend tho mischief of a hair-broom, it- would viovy that instrument with a dread akin to that which Brown contemplated the face of Quick. , '. 'Give up the, house J explain yourself, JMr. Quick,' said Brown.' . , '.,,'-. .
