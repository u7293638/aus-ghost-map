WHEN FATHOMS DEEP. A sailor tells a story of a diver who saw two ghosts. He had gone down to the wreck of a large etaam.gr and was crossing the main saloon whfn two qray shapes of enormous size came ambling towards him. He did not wait to make notes, but gaVe the danger signal and was pulled up. ioid in thecbeertui light ot tbe day, it seemed rather a lame story, so an other diver went down to see what he could make of it. Towards him also came the ghostly gray shapes. He stood irresolute fora moment and then, going boldly for ward, struck hiB hatchet throngh â€” a mirror ! The ghosts were only a dim reflec tion of bis own legs , much enlarged, of course, as everything is that a diver sees through the frontal eye of his helmet.
