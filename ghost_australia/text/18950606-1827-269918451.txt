" As Mei'e"Criffi6e'a%d Boute-en-train pushed towards the brook in-, the -waning* day, at-was plain to them that .their iriends-had suffered a repulse, but that-repulse was 110 flight.

All wounded men are tormented by. thirst, and to the brook, those who could, bad "crawled to "bathe their limbs or to drink. .But it was. no longer a limpid purl of water, but a puddle, 'mud-stained- -and . crimsonstreaked; They waded :;.througlrit and paused on the other-. side -for rest and to concert what had -best be done.; ?:J3oute-en-train : \vould-like:to cool his injured: foot, in the -stream; and Mere Orimee was anxious to "bandage it more done, unt.il such time as. they would meet a. surgeon. -But, no:-surgeon •was neai\' • She presumed tliey: had more urgent.cases to minister-to. elser: •where. • ;•• " I do not understand: this," she said - "-our men fought well, but I fancy we must have been cheated into action.

That may "be 1 only scandal." "It is truth," said -Mere Orimee, "for I know it. There's no smoke: •without fire." ; " I wish we were near a fire now, .for I am beginning to feel joliy cold." "Yes, my poor lad, you are; you Were hot a while agone.- You are feverish. Does the wound.pain ?" ; " Smarts a little, but 1 don't mind that." Have a drop out of my keg ; you are faint. You had better rest here: until I get some assistance," and she looked around on the undulating soil for .some turfy, bank, -ivhereon she could set the boy-soldier in an easy position. It must not be supposed that they: were alone. The - ground bore all the traces of recent events in trampled grass* split trees, prostrate bop- poles, strewn knapsacks and Tifepis, dead bodies of men or horses, shell- craters, blood-pools, and that most" painful of all sights of tlio battlefield, those who^ were jnortally • wounded, and to -whom it was considered waste of time and labour to pay attention. Some who were less severely..hit'hadVdragged themselves to remote spots under bushes or in the hop-fields, where they were out of the line of . .moving troops, . War 1 brings out many noble qualiti es, but it is only too true that it' dcrelops the selfishness of human natnand * a strange callousness , to the sn.iV : ri.^s of others.

But our pair had now reached a portion-of the ground to •winch few of the . Prussians had, penetrated. The scene of closer struggle in the woods lay behind them; the fire had dropped, and. they were m comparative safety. At last, Mfcre Crmiee discovered a cosy spot, and helped to free Bouteen-train of -his knapsack, which: she had arranged as. a pillow, under, his head, when she: caught, sight of .a .bare-:: he^ed"- 1 -figure^ stretched, •.-at . a^cfew yards' distance, m the lee of a drum. " You must not be disturbed by ugly neighbours," she said,.- " you'll get accustomed to them before the campaign is over." " All right, mother, don't -bother about me," said the boy, turning to : look whither he had noticed her gazing, and starting " Hola ' " he cried, " It is one of the enemy; he's in Prussian uniform." . ••-,-.; Tiie keen sight of tlio sharp-shooter had'*detected -what had .escaped the ; cursory glance of the cantiniere.. " Hum, I believe: you -are; right: JJo must have ..been brave to-have gotso far," and she moved ;overvto aeceitain if he were really dead—peihaps to search ;lns-poeke.ts,; that is Jewomanly motive. He "lay on'lns back, a flaxen-haired b»ardless youlli with relinedifeatures, sunburnt, 'but bloodless.

A surgeon examined them, Boute-en-train's wound was pronounced slight; but repose: for. some days would be .imperative. The i Grerman's was worse, the bullet had lodged, as i ; the ; man of science soori' tbsted by Nekton's probe 5' there was a 1 cart going into M.etz, both had ijetter be conveyed there. ••-• Excessive' sitrain had not yet come upon the hospital accommodation at the fortress, although the day was near when there were mora wounded than ambulances. Elsewhere, at Paris for example,.there \tfere more ambulances than wounded. The two boys were laid in beds side by side- in a , well-windowed room; aggressively .white in the bare walls, ; and with floors worn.. :almost. as thm as an old sixpence by perpetual scrubbing. \- Their clothes were put in a:box at the foot of their beds, and they were furnished-with- long nightgowns and night-caps.. A stand for their medicines was beside them,. and one of the nursing sisters, who belonged to. a i-eligious order;. providedthem with dominoes and draughtboard. At the head of their beds there was a card, on which their names, date of entrance, and the nature 1 of their infirmities;: were written, and aislate at the top, on which the a3- sifetant who went round with the doctor on his morning-visits chalked the. scale of dietary. The bullet in Wolff's knee was • extracted -with a forceps, aid he and his companion - having the blessed privilege of youth, were getting on nicely. They had long chats.! Wolff gave ,Boute-erttrain,L. a .. ctenl^of. lriformation about the country. from which he came, and awoke his mind to tlie surprise thatmenwerepretty much the same in Germany as in France, and were moved by similar feelings. The family and the flag were.as potent spell-words by the Spree asby the Seine- He belonged to the 53rd regiment, of which von Gorstein-Hohenstem was colonel. He was a very brave officer; .knew, not fear, the .dear olii colonel; a horse was shot, under him as he paced :in front of the regim'ent the other-day; as coolly as^if he were on a parade. i" Was he hurt ? " asked Leloup anxiously. "ITo; bruised slightly hy the fall, but lie escaped from under the-horse." i The 53rd, which was incomparably • the finest: regiment m the Grerman army, was in the corps commanded by von Zastrow, and was recruited -from ; tlie district of. Wesel, which was a strong fortress on the north-west frontier ofrPrussia, ;where :the,;:Lippe: flows into the Rhine. It did a big trade with the Dutch. -The French -had been there in -the beginning of the century. [ " Oh, then," said Leloup, " it is true'what our Emperor said in his proclamation.to the-army, - that,what-, ever the road might bo that we took : hfeyondour frontiers •w.e^^shbuldeomeacross the glorious:; tracks of our s fathers.'" •" You will find their tracks at Wesel, hutnot all of the m are glorious.

" Silence," interposed Mere Grimde. '.' Do you want to renew the battle on your own account ?

"I shall leave you, and trust me to he back with aid the moment I fetch up with those rascals of the 81st, and that plague of my life, Marengo." : But the campaigner of the Crimea and Italy was a woman of resource; and before she quitted them she • gathered watch-coats and horse- cloths' \- tocoverthem, and gomg.farther. a-field, • was lucky enough to find a bottle of red wine and some.food ,in the courier' bag of a slam officer.
