Pepew on Superstition. "I am not superstitious," said Chaun cey M. Depow the other day. "I no not believe in witches, spirits, elves, vam pires, ghouls, or ghosts. Nor do I be lieve in an evil genius, the evil eye, a bottomless pit, or a deilt with horns and a cloven- foot. I would not pass a night in a church or graveyard with a corpse, because that would be an un pleasant and unprofitble way to spend a night. I would w ar nothing in the nature of a talisman or mascot and never carried a lucky coin. As to sit ting down with thireen at a table, that is one thing I wou~l not do. But I re spect the superstition, not because I an superstitious, but because Ido not want to feel uncomfortable. A good dinner consists in someth?ing more than thhing to eat'and drink. Its pleasure depends more on the sub tler elements of good company, minds;at ease and attuned to harmony with thee spirit of the occasion. If your dinner is to be made uncomfort able by a mournful or unpleasantfeature of this kind you might better stop at a restaurant and: swallow a dozen oysters. You could at Bleast then have a pleasant chat with the man behind the counter while he opena your oysters."
