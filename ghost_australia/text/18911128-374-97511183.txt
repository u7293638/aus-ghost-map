Looking for the Ghost. FOB some time past the populous dis trict of New Kent road has been a mystery all to itself, which, like many others of the same kind, has now been rudely scattered to the winds by the magistrate of'Lambeth Police Court. A house was supposed to be haunted, and hundreds of persons assembled around it nightly in the hope of seeing the ghost. No one succeeded in catching a glimpse at it; the phantom waaas vague as a Mahatma, and quite as shy at exhibiting itself. Some daring young men became irritated at the dilatory babies of the perturbed spirit, and in order to arouse it to a sense of its duty to the public, they kn ocked at the door, and rang the bell with a vigour sufficient to arouse the drowsiest shade in the deepest cellar of habitation. Mr. Drazany, the occupant, objected to these proceedings, as he did to the nocturnal crowds who made his evenings miserable, fie therefore summoned two of the in dividuals before Mr. Hopkins at Lambeth. In reply to that gentleman he declared that the ghost was all a farce. He had lived in the houBe for 'eighteen months, and not the shadow of one, of any form or color, had he Been all the time. Mr. Hopkins discharged one of the accused, but fined the other- William Johnson twenty shillings, with the alternative of fourteen days1 imprisonment, adding that the next person brought before him for knocking at the door in the hope of see ing the prodigy would receive a much heavier punishment. It is now reason able to assume that the ghost of the New Kent-road will take rank with his brother fraud who used to live in Cock-lane.
