A CHOST AT PENRITH. Qaite a commotion has been caused in town especially among the youug folks, owing to a report having gained currency that a ghost had been seen in different partB of the town, and had interfered with several people (reports the Penrith paper) We have made nightly visits to the supposed haunts of this being, but so far we have no resnlts to report, although someone or other drops across whatever it is nightly. The peculiar pÂ»rt of this ghost is that it is a black one dressed as a woman, and on being spoken to it generally clears oat. Only a few nights ago someone gave chase, and very nearly caught it at the fence leading into tbe Agriculiural Saciety'e ground beyond tbe bridge in Station-street, where, however, it jumped the fence, took eff its head, and cleared across by Ridley. This is pretty tell, the wonder is that it did rot throw back its head at its pnrsuer. Mrs. Charles Byrnes, of High-' street, bad a peculiar experience a few nights ago. Hearing someone in tbe adjoining room, and imagining it was her husband, she called oat to him " not to be trying to frighten her." She got no reply, and at a later stage, something that she thonght was " the ghost," or a man, entered tbe room on all fours. She screamed, jumped on the table, and later on swooned off. Several of the neighbors rushed in, only to find Mrs. Byrnes in a swoon and Mr. E lBterbrook's black pig leaving the premises. No one has yet captured the real ghost, and for the last night or two be has I een very quiet, probably owing to the moonlizht nights. When it gets a bit darker, perhaps his ghoBtship will deign to walk.
