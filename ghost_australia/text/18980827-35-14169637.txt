I STUDIES OF A BIOGRAPHER. Though we regret that ill health compelled Mr Leslie Stephen to relinquish his work on the Dictionary of National Biography, yet we are grateful that he has been afforded an opportunity of returning to a place of work that reminds us of the charm of his delightful " Hours in a Library" In the present work, " Studies of a Biographer, 2 vols (Duckworth and Co we have a number of interesting Studies" or Lesna s In speaking of his labours on N National Biography, Mr Stephen recalls CoÂ» poet's lines A fond attempt to give a d nthloss lot To mines ignoble buln to be forest and says that when he was looking at his old treadmill, now Mr Lee's he sometimes thought that it were better oblivion than a permanent admission that you were IhoAmghly and hope less commonplace In the chapter on " The Evolu- tion of Editors " we get an instructive piece of news "The political atmosphere under Walpole was favourable to another direction of literary development Dofoc found time for the multitudinous activities which entitle him to be a great grandfather of all modern JOHn alarm He helped to start newspapers, he published Secret documents , he interviewed Jack Sheppard at the foot of the gallows , he collected ghost stories , he wrote accounts of worthy dissenting divines recently deceased he wrote ed if rag essay s upon the dull and things in general, he described tours in the colony by ; he passed Robinson Crusoe through a journal like a " fontllotou^ " and, in short, he opened almost every vein of periodical literature that has been worked by his successors " So that some of what are thought to be the most up to-date points of modern journalism are not now at all Striking chapters are those devoted to Matthew Arnold and Oowott Of the first he says " Though I was once oven The Editor and forced in that capacity to decline certain articles, on grounds, of course, quite apart from literary mint, yet he was always not only courteous but cordial, and I may almost say affectionate in manner He had that obvious bW canons of nature which it is impossible not to recognise and not to love " Commenting on Arnold's significant references to Terry son in his essays, Mr Leslie Stephen says " Though Arnold does not cleanse the poetry, he evidently felt what, to say the truth, I think must be adam ted-that Tennyson interpreted the vengo shall I say, the Philistine or the com- monplace English sentiment a little too faith- fully , but it may be inferred-though Arnold does not draw the mfereme-that the extraordinary popularity of Penny bon was partly owing to the fact that he could express what occurred to everybody's language that could be approached by nobody Arnold, on the contrary, is, in all his poems, writing for the cultivated, and even for a small class of cultivated people " In the chapter on Jowett, after an examination of the man, his ideas and its surroundings, he propounds the question, " Is any phase of speculation marked by Jowett's personal stamp of That is the question which one naturally asks about a man who is a well-known writer upon philosophy, and one can hardly deny that the answer must be unequivocally in the negative " Here, again, is another drink criticism that will not be palatable to warm admirers of the late Master of Balliol -" Jowett sincerely hold Christianity to be in some shape the great force on the side of the moral elevation of mankind When removing what seems to others the very OBSOUCO of the creed, he really supposed himself to be only remove mg incrustations that he could hold that position sincerely implies, is I fancy, be in tellectual weakness admitted by his biographers " There is abundance of line criticism and graceful writing in these two volumes that will well repay inspection Copies of this work reach us from Messrs Angus and Robertson and Messrs George Robertson and Co
