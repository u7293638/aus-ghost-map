^THEATRE ilCiYAL. . , v.'rasi A^KEABANOB OP MR. BUCIIAKAJT. Tlio great Ainerican tragedian, Mr M'Kean Buchanan, made his first appearance at the Theatre Royal on Mon day evening, and as wo expected, drew a great house. Hamlet, the character by which he first became known to a London audience, was also that by which ho sought to win the sympathies of the metropolis of the Southern j hemisphere. Most successful has he been in tho attempt. From first to last, the enthusiastic applause of the 1 audience proved that Mr Buchanan's conception of the character met with the entire approval of the crowd which liad assembled to witness it. It was at once a spirited and graceful impersonation of tho philosophic; Prince, and struck us as one of tho ino3t successful pieces of acting which we had witnessed for somo time. The fine fiaure, eait, and voice of the artiste, were emi nently adapted to tho effective representation of the character, and wo aro bound to say that we do not think Mr Buclianan's reading coilld readily bo surpassed. The King was ably rendered by Mr Gordon, and Gertrude by Mrs C. Young. The Ghost found an able represen tative in Mr Richard Youngo, and Polonius in Mi Leslie. The Ophelia of Mis3 C. Nelson, was a careful piece of acting and singing, but scarcely up to the standard. The audience gave tho most marked mani festation' of their satisfaction, and at tho closo of the pieee vociferously summoned Mr Buchanan before the curtain, whero in a fow words, ho expressed his grati tude for his enthusiastic recaption.
