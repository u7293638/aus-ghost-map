A Ghost in Katoomba As Jim the Manager, with a friend, was walking home on Wednesday night a little after 11, just when the church was closed, he experienced a terrible shook as he passed by the Katoomba Post Office. He declares he saw an apparition clad in white cross the street and walk over the railway line, where it vanished in blue flame, in the sparks of which numbers of snakes wriggled about. An affidavit to this effect has been sent to he Penrith print, with a sketch of the ghastly visitant to be tomahawked for illustration. What adds to the marvel and causes some people to give ear to it is the fact of Jim being a total abstainer. It is common for people who have "got 'em bad" to see snakes and other creations of a disordered brain, but here is the fact that two thoroughly sober villagers stake their reputation that it was a ghost and snakes they beheld. One of the sighteers was so frightened that he dropped and left in the street a leg of mutton that he bought of Mr O'Brien for the morrow's dinner.
