A Mrs Eoberfcs gave a seance before the Spiritualistic Society, which wag not considered satisfac tory. -j She offered to give another if a wire cage was provided, from which she under took to make her escape by supernatural means. The cage was duly to hand on May 3,. and a committee duly locked Mrs Eoberts-in the cage. It was an hour before anything was seen to .emerge from the cabinet, and then, a white, form flitted \ around in front of the audience, which sat in almost total darknesr, and floated back behind the curtains. The form had Ecarcely disappeared behind the curtain when one of the committee, who had crawled to the rear of the cabinet, seized an arm and yelled, ' Turn up the lights !' Another member, who had his hand covered with fresh ink, patted the ghost on the cheek, leaving a beauty spot that was easy to recognised There was a general scramble and pandemonium reigned in the hall. The lights were turned up and Mrs Roberts stood in the midst of the audience in a costume so unconventional as to excite pity. A woman in the audienoe loaned her a cloak, and the medium's dress was found! after 15 minutes and the woman wag left alone long enough to dress. She then acknowledged that she had been practising the fraud nine year3, but declined to give any details. ??-..-..? ? â€” o ? ? ' ' ? '
