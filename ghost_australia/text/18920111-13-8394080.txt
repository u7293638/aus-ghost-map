THE HOLY (MOST COLLEGE, is ALL A li AT. IO till EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir,-In your Issue of Saturday a letter appears from your Ballarat correspondent confirming this statement - It is probable that the Holy Ghost College at Wendouree will shortly be disestablished, owing to the teaching staff being insufficient, ' Allow me to say, In the first place that the college is not to be shortly disestablished * It has been actually disestablished for more than a week Secondly, the cause was never an insufficiency of the teaching staff, but a withdrawal of the members of the order by the superior in France owing to private reasons of a serious nature, -Yours, c" Jim. 10.
