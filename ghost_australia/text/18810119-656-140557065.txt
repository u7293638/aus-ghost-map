... ' A IiASnNQ- BiEMOEY. I . Tbe night of my return I went 'to the' Haymarket Theatre. After m^ long wander-; inga my arrival had disappointed me. lt waa a dull November Saturday,1 London wbb not full, 'and' I- found aoaroely any of tbe' greetidga' I had longed for arid expeoted. My - lew relatives were absent; in the Clubs I belonged to I only found strangers. Time bung-heavy on my handa aiter ^the strange' soenes ot the -past five yeara. '- So I Vent to' tbe Haymarket.' . ;? Tbe little -theatre, had always 'been my fancy. X. remembered it'from very early yontb — Farren, WebBter, Buckstone, Howe,' Holl, Mrs.- Nisbit, -Mrs. Glover, Jul'® Bonbet, and MisB P.' Horton. I iiave nevor1 been- a peat, theatre goer- or 'devotee '.bf the'1 drama, aud my knowledge of tbe tribal hiatory is pretty well oonfined to the Hay market, - : ' . - '. . '. OHAPrERI. ' Theeb was rather a long entr' acte, and my | mind, by instinct, but miBtlly went over lifierent occaaions of play-going. -Here I bad been witb A, and B, and C, in days when th* end of the play was the beginning, of the avening. Nearly opposite once existed a kind -of bell upon eaith called Bob Oroft's, whitheryoung men went merely beoauwitwaB diareputable. , '. Once or twice in early youth I had . been' taken there, qnd I had not fanoied it, for rough amusements - hid never. been to my liking. At Mr. Crofbfi an ordinary evening generally/ended in a iighc, and a not very, extraordinary, one in j. pojice invasion. Here 1 had been kept from harm's way by Jook Campbell I—slnoe dead. Once— the, retoem bra'noa, followed qaick— I .had com* to the theatre in a box with 'Jook Campbell .. and others. Among th*m waB Lydia Mainwear-, ing. The' play was; the flame as that now being acted — the ' School for Scandal.' . I glanced at. tb* box we' had ocoupled. .It waa' empty. The curtain again rung up, ... Another ' entr'acte.. The . box waB still empty,. I :aighed. My longed-for return had , beei» such , ,'a ' disappointment. , I bad almost expeoted to ate some friend in the. box. Curious— In a 'bbx near it two hands in black; gloveB are , holding an opera glass, directed toward '.mo. The wrists Beem familiar, small, but with .hard wlrey sinews expressing; ppwer and atrengtb.: ; The next, time I looked np, the hands and the glass are there no longer, and their owner has retired to the back of the box. The play. waB over, and a. well-known farce, was about to. commence. The stalls were half- emptied, when, a well-known face cam* and greeted me. It. was, Sir Eime.Egerton, once a sohoolfellow, then a clergyman— a vocation be had renounced on. succeeding to a . baronetcy and a property. He was a kindly, dull man. ; ?; Westerham,' he said; '.I had no idea you were in London.'. - . ; ' . ... ? f I have only just returned after nearly' five yeara, wandering in 'the two. Americas.' . ' I knew yon wer* travellbig'. somewher*, bat no one ever.heard from.you.' .. *'I wrote to so few people,' I answered; 'and no. one wrote' to me. I have been beyond .the range of all news, publlo or private.' ' Then, I daresay, -you never heard of my marriage? .Come up and make the acquaint-' anoe of my wife.' , , He took me- totbe-box:in whlch I had seen the black gloves. . ' My'deir,'! idon't think you ?ever' knew my {old friend Lord,, Weiterham, though I believe you. come from'' the same country and bare the same nahie. He has jiist re turned from South America.' Lady 'Egerton bowed for a moment with out a word. Then, as' though' to make r*-. paration, she said: 'I am always glad, Esme, to see.any: «f your friepdi. .' ' Welcome h'omp, I should Bay, Lord' Westeiham^ I know you already from Eaine arid others.' ' It,' was' the' same*'y6Ice ' and the'' same g'estur.e.aa before— a mixture of defiance and' submission, of' reientment and' fear.. To Bsme her hearing was affectionate and' cares-' sing, almost' compassionate *'nd fall of grati tude.' , ' ButLto me Ly^'a . Malnwearing showed no slgii ofreioanitlbn. ' I was'surprised to bear of Sir Eame's marriage 'juat now. I have had no letters' for months, and' baVe aeeni no newspapsrs except -in'the lakMeW weeks.' ?

' Wheri slone aha said no word of recogni tion or reminiscence. ' you muse nave -seen tne piay Duore, Lord Westerham.' ' Onoe,' I replied, ' ' a . long time ago, from the box next to ithla one.' 'Then you will remember tomorrow,', ! she 'said as she entered' the carriage. ' I know your promises are sacred. .Good night.' ? ? ' ? i ? ? ! ? . '..*? CHAPTER Hv j ' Mt youth was most unbappy. My mother ihad married a second time a Welsh olergy jman, who had-:sp8bulate'd' on her. family; ! She wlas the sfster, arid later the' heir geheHl, ' bf Lord ' W eiterham, who, having twoVboys! 'and an encutaKe-ed e8tite,coi4d do littlo for 'ber, .even if , so inclined. Th* -deatb of his two boys made but little cbange in hia lp«Hnattnr.,' as . it aismed to i embitter -bis wlfe^ a .hard Sootoh -Poritan, toward .thwe wbo wero.to subeesd; to tb* Inheritance. of her sons... Nor. did it improve tb0 disposi tion toward me pf jmy. step-father, Small as. were; my: iproflpects,. . they; stood, in -the way of bis son, my step-brothcr—an impulsive, choleric; sickly boy, who died ,before;his fathers.: But my ewly .lifeiand home.were, unhappy. ? . My small patrimony , was; seized-;, on ,. by., -my .stop-father, ; . whp. grudged ma tbe food and abetter He gave me for myown money. Things .could .not. last thus.' At j.aUT early , age X therefore found;- myself 'living in London witli- a distant cousin, a i conveyaiicer, who gave me a latctkey,' and : allowed ? mo to have I my own way, under - the ;,. guidance of another distant ' relative, , sport-, ing man , and . a soapegraoe. ,'It was under his patronage that I [became acquainted with the establishment of Mr.. Robert Croft. It is. a wonder to me;, now that I was riot, rqined in ptirBe and reputa tion before I reached the; age o( ninotpeq. Fo'rtunately, I dialiked the aooiety into whioh1 I . was initiated; acd after tbe' first flattering : aasuranoe that I waa ' soeing life,' I baoWd out of Mr. Cfbft'8 intimate oirole.' Indeedl [never entered into hia establishment above ! two or three times— once with ndy cousim who, having aeonred me the- entree, allowed; me alone to improve the oooaslon. - It- was On my tbird'andleiat a^pearanoe tbatl made; ' the acabalntance of Jock Campbell, V; 'After dining alone wltb'the' oonveyanoer,' I, left htm. to 'do his work, went to the 1 theatre, Brid sat in the stalla nest 'Jock. '; I ' looked m'noh youriger-'thari' 'my - age; Whioh was npt mot'e thanisevonteeri. ' vyhett l lilt thb;thai»tre' I- brosaed 'the- Hajtaarket an4 | passed op U» ' littte'? wail'! whlofc: ted: to Croft's. Ihad engaged to meet my scape- ( grace conein there. He had dazzled me with the promise of taking me to a soene of even greater bliss. At the door of' Bob Croit'a, waiting for it to be opened a^the necessary signal, stood the tall, heavy, but well proportioned form that bad sat next me at the theatre. Looking at me- aa. we entered, he aaid in a tone of oompaBsion : ' Hillo i young man, yon' are beginning1 early.' I half-resented bis remarks, and with ah air of superiority, I asked the waiter if Mr. Alan M'Tavish had arrived. 'Alan M'Tavlshl' Jock Campbell mur mured .: to himself as, ou learning that my couain. bad not: arrived, I walked into the first room. ' The rooms wer* small and crowded. The gas flamed, but the floors were sanded. The space was divided into boxes, of which only two sides were fenced off. The atmos phere was thick with smoke ; and there was to be found the. refuse of race-oonrees and Binglng-halla, with a . large, sprinkling - ot young, men of the upper and; middle olasses, guardsmen, , and others .who, like .myself, Imagined they were enjoying life. Jook Campbell .entered as a king, and wiui rapturously greeted by all the assembly. Ho was a splendid fellow, tall, at least six feet four, muscular, with great breadth of shoulders, powerful arms, and a handsome high- bred, falr-complexloned faoe, on which he: wore a. moustache — an ornament only known in those days, to man who, like him self, weie in the cavalry. ' '.Good-night, Jock,' tbe mob orled out. ' Good-night,' he responded cheerily '; and notwlthatandlng the vile surroundings, bis presence and bis voice showld the' good there was in the man. He was -,nob more than four-and-twenty, and the days had not died out, now almost forgotten, when debauohery was deemed the extreme of ;wlt and .good company. Spring-heeled. Jacks wrenohlng off door I knockers, midnight surprises, fights in the j street, attacks.on the police— these were the pleasur*s of many yopng men of tbe world, now staid grandfathers and lighta in their generation... Jock Campbell had fallen into these waya from high spirits, rather than from depravity.. He was full of energy, strong, handsome and beloved— beaming with sympathy, which was. enlisted by . hU oompamonB for the moment, .whether these were innocent or the' reverse. .'' Belonging tb a regiment in which such pursuits ware the vogue, he . plunged, readily into them. But he was, equally popular In ball- rooms with; maiden aunts, or even little children, for he' ! was only pleased with giving pleasure. Waiting for my cousin', I called ostentati ously for a glass ot ' pale white,' the synonym for braridy and water in an un licensed institution. Ah inner feeling seamed, to tell me that Jook Campbell had. hia eye on me; and half-resentful, yet half-faaclnated, I followed him npstalra with iriy brandy and' wiat'er in 'my hand. .'The room waa much ? larger, as 'supper' could ' bs obtained, there/ and. a table stood .very nearly, tbe whole length of the -room, covered' with a cloth spotted with gravy, beer, and strong drink, I sat' down at aa ocoupied , corner of thia, alpplng my braridy and water, and am'okirig a cigar, a inewly-acqulred acbompllshment. A man with a broken nose; named Shepherd, a .betting man, sat rft the other end. The test of the room was crowded; for it waa known Jock Campbell, who had a; beautiful volc*- would be asked to sing a song. , / ' , , ' Come, . Jock — a aorig ?' they all cried ; , and he trolled forth, in a rich, strong .tenor, an' .Irish .aong' with a rolicking Uchbrua, in which the whole room joined. 'Encore ! encore 1' shouted the crowd. ' I 'ope the aong won't' be so noisy, oap-. tain,' Baid Mr. Bob Croft, ' acba of the' peelera.' . ' All' right;' aaid Jook .Campbell, as 'he' took a puff of his' cigar, looking, me straight in' the face ; arid leaning his ;chin oh his . hand, be aang in a minor key, and in a low. tone, a pathetic Scotch aong. , The effect^ waa extraordinary; The crowd waa ljuaheel while he aang ; 'and when he'ended. the lost, hardened women preieht were crying and aobblng like children. . . , , On myaelf the effect waa eleotridaL' I had often heard the aong in my home,' arid had always 'been told that it was. uhpublisbed, and related to an event in our family history. ' It set me musing.
