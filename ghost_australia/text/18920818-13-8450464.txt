The state of the House at the beginning of the session was evidence that the Casterton proposals were generally accepted, and these substantially were-a stock tax, moderately increased duties on such articles of luxury as beer and spirits, and such few simple taxes as might be necessary to make up the deficiency. Not a hint was given of a tariff revision, coupled with a heavy advance in duties imposed for other than revenue purposes. It can be affirmed with confidence that, from the beginning of the recent elections until they closed, not one word was spoken by a Minister to indicate that M'Kinleyism would be introduced-that M'Kinleyism against which there appears to be a revolt in America. And it may be submitted that it is not fair to put one particular fiscal programme before the country, and then immediately that the elections are over to substitute another and a different proposal. And it must be remembered that if we adopt the 50 per cent, standard in half a dozen cases, we must adopt it in half a hundred. * The new standard becomes the general standard, because you cannot logically or equitably con- cede to one person and deny to another who has equal claims. Yet the issue whether we should resort to semi-prohibition is so important that it should not be rushed upon the community as a surprise. The great producing interests which may be affected by it have a right to be specifically consulted-and if they were consulted the probability is that they would affirm by an overwhelming majority that protection must be reasonable, and that the 50 percent, standard is too high. If the advocates of M'Kinleyism desire to consult the country, well and good. They can either wait for two years and a half, until the next appeal occurs, or they can take their chance of an election a little later on. But, remembering the Casterton programme, it may be urged that it is the duty of the Assembly to keep the tariff substantially as it is, the stock tax excepted, until the subject has been discussed and the producers' vote has been taken. If any country member can stand up in his place and say, " I put this issue to my " constituents, they cheered me on " when I talked of further imposts " upon everything they wear, every " thing they use in their homes, and " every tool they employ in their " trades," that member has yet to make himself known. We do not believe that there is such a member. And the probability is that those country members who vote for such imposts will vote as much against the wishes of their constituents as they will against their interests. The general idea when the House met was, we are sure, that the Government would adopt as representing its policy the words " Encourage exports." Most thinkers and observers have noted with regret, and even with alarm, the steady shrinkage in the exports of the colony, and as-the subject has attracted marked attention here and in Great Britain, the expectation was that Ministers would strive in some way to repair the fault. How great the shrinkage is may be seen from the following figures : Exports Per Head. 1881 £18 12 G 1890.11 17 2 Now, these ' lines do not disclose a healthy state of things, especially when we contrast them with the sister states. The return is for the year 1890 : Exports Per Head. I South Australia. £28 2 i) New South Wales ... 200 2 New Zealand . 15 to 11 Victoria. 11 17 2 It must be tolerably apparent to one and all that our exports have fallen off far too much, and hence much of the depression of the day. In the decade under notice we have invested enormously in reproductive works. But where is the increased production 1 Millions have been spent in railways to bring produce down to the port for shipment. But where is the produce 1 The fact seems to be I that we have been building and un- building at one and the same time. True, we have constructed country lines, but by forcing up prices we have so cut into the profits of the producer as to paralyse his efforts. Unless fair profits can be made by agriculture and' by the industries connected with agriculture, no heart will ever be put in those occupations; they will necessarily flag ; while on the other hand, to secure substantial gains is to stimulate enterprise and to make sure of vigorous growth. If there is money and much money to be made out of agriculture, we shall not need to resort to artificial inducements to attract people to the lands. They will flock to them on their own account. On the land there is room for all. Our bright sunshine and our fertile soil constitute our inexhaustible capital. We can export meat, fruit, corn, and wine, and obtain tens of millions per annum in return, and we can thus end any strain in the situation. And the prosperous country will easily and willingly support a busy city. The one naturally creates the other. Only the essential condition is that the export should be profitable to the producer, who will assuredly not labour unless he sees a prospect of gain. We one and all admit the importance of stimulating production, and yet no one can say that there is one new item in the Budget that tends to " encourage " exports." Tried by this test the Budget is utterly wanting. . Mr. DOWNES CARTER had many things to say yesterday that were to the point, and he said them well. As a commercial member he sees the absurdities of the Treasurer's balance-sheet (with its exaggerated deficit), and he recognises that the proper financial policy is to make both ends meet to-day, and to make merely moderate provision for the reduction of the deficit-which with improved times would disappear. As he indicates, all the M'Kinley duties can be dropped, and still the Treasurer if his figures are at all to be depended upon-will have ample to pay his way and to gradually pay off the debt also. But perhaps the truest words spoken by Mr. CARTER were those in which he declared that the best thing for the colony at the present moment would be for a Government formed by the country party to come into power. Such a Government might have its own foibles and errors, but it would not be guilty of the folly-the extreme folly of handicapping production, of checking exports of sending prices up by leaps and bounds at the order and to obtain the support of the Trades-hall. When it was suggested to Ministers yesterday to adhere to the Casterton programme, it was a Trades- hall member who made the quick reply, " They will be a good " deal worse off if they do so." One remark made by the member for Melbourne, yesterday was well received by both sides of the House. Sir GRAHAMÚ.JÍEKRY, he says, was giving satisfaction as a public servant in London when he was recalled. He was unjustly removed, added Mr. DOWNES CARTER, by a bit of political jugglery, in order that Mr. SHIELS might become Premier and Mr. MONRO might leave the colony. This dictum was loudly applauded. It is amusing at this juncture to remember the wretched plea put in to justify the " political juggle." Sir GRAHAM BERRY, it was said, was out of touch with the colony, and yet the men who recalled him have appointed him their Treasurer, as their best available man to meet an emergency ! The juggling and the bungling still go on. A pleasant fiction is put about that Mr. MUNRO'S friends are anxious that he should visit Melbourne to reply to " serious charges, and if he can clear himself the hon. gentleman, it is said, is to go back. A more awkward way of dealing with the situation can scarcely be imagined. If Mr. MUNRO leaves his post it will be practically impossible for him to return in the face of a strong public opinion, and yet if he does not return the Government action may imply that he has failed to clear himself from some particular imputation. Thus another false position is created. The position is really not affected by anything Mr. MUNRO can say or do either in London or in Melbourne. It is not possible for the hon. gentleman to dis- turb the plain and uncontested facts that the Real Estate Bank has gone with a crash, that he was the director who managed the Real Estate Bank, and that the institution in question was actually insolvent while the chairman's addresses were assuring depositors and shareholders that the bank was solvent and sound-the result of these assurances being that many persons have been deceived and have suffered grievous wrong. So far as Mr. MUNRO himself is concerned, his situation may possibly be explained by a tendency to recklessness in talk and in action, and his friends may think little worse of him after the bank failure than before ; but after every allowance is made, we still have the circumstances that as chairman of the Real Estate Bank, as the founder of that institution, and, so to speak, its perpetual guarantor in season and out of season, he is the central figure in a grave national misfortune. This £2,000,000 wreck means wide-spread ruin among individuals, and is a blow at the national credit. We all of us know that a man placed in so unfortunate and unhappy a position could not possibly' be selected to fill a high and confidential and representative position in the Imperial service, and we necessarily sink to a lower level than the English level by such an appointment in connection with ourselves. Such is the position, simply stated. Mr. MUNRO is not the only man whom private circumstances have disqualified perhaps only temporarily -for a public position of a particular kind He could resign the Agency General without casting any slur upon his character, but his re- tention of the position casts a slur upon Victoria by showing that the colony is insensible to those considerations of propriety which obtain elsewhere. Under such circumstances the Government ought to have ended the situation by allowing Mr. MUNRO to understand that his resigna- tion would be accepted. If the Government really mean to investigate, accusations against Mr. MUNRO, the reference presumably is to the so-called La Rose transaction. The allegation is that Mr. MUNRO, as executor of an estate, sold the land to Mr. JOHN WOODS, who was his agent or dummy, and that as chairman of the Real Estate Bank he bought the land from his agent at a heavily advanced I price. With the alleged facts before him an employer would naturally ask for explanations from any confidential a servant affected by the scandal, and so Mr. SHIELS was justified in calling attention to the matter. But it would be a great mistake to suppose that the objection to the appointment is based upon the La Pose incident. It is natural to believe that Mr. MUNRO will be able to clear himself of that imputation by conclusively showing that he had no connection whatever with Mr. WOODS in the matter, and that as executor he obtained the highest price possible for the La Rose estate, and that as chair- a man of the bank he purchased at the cheapest rate for the institution. So much is to be anticipated, as a matter of course, but after La Hose is disposed of the general scandal remains no less and no more than before. The connection of Mr. MUNRO with the Real Estate Bank, and the inability of Mr. MUNRO to meet his liabilities in connection with that institution, are misfortunes, but it is only a blunted sensibility that will not recognise that such misfortunes are also a disqualification. The backing and the filling which are taking place" \ the half-truths told here and the half'. ! contradictions received from London are far from edifying, and a Government with the credit of the colony at its heart would not care about pro- longing the agony. The directors of the associated mines at Broken Hill have now announced the terms on which they intend to I re-open the mines and have fixed a * date for resuming work. The offer is one that could honourably be accepted by many of the miners, who were originally forced into the strike, not through any fear that an alteration in the system of working would be prejudicial to their interests, but through the impetuosity of Mr! SLEATH and his immediate followers That the directors are not attempt- ing to reduce the rate of wages is shown by the fact that, in spite of the rapid and constant fall in the price of silver, they are still willing to pay in accordance with the former schedule of prices, if this is possible. On the other hand, they propose that the stoping of ore should be done under contract at the discretion of the managers, and that the managers should be allowed to make private agreements with the men as to the terms of the contract. This is a perfectly fair stipulation. The strike leaders have informed us that it is impossible to fix at Broken Hill a general hewing rate, such as exists in the coal mines at Newcastle, and they have also declared that they object not so much to contract work as to some imaginary y system of competitive tendering, which He SLEATH and Mr. FERGUSON have been in the habit of depicting daily to the meetings on the Central-reserve. The directors evidently agree with the opinion that no fixed rate can be determined, and that a competitive system, pure and simple, is inadvisable. They _ have consequently left it to the 1 managers, who ought to know 1 exactly the value of every work 3 that is undertaken either above ground ' 9 or below, to decide upon the terms of 1 each contract, and they have also 9 stipulated that the men who are employed in the mines are to he kept at work continuously if they are willing to accept the employment. This proposal, coupled as it is with the statement that the companies have no objection to labour unions, cannot be held to involve any system of extreme competition among the miners. It is only natural to find that the stipulations made by the directors are regarded with mingled scorn and horror by Mr. SLEATH, whose temporary popularity and power would be completely gone if the men abandoned his profitless business of meeting on a dusty and barren reserve for the more lucrative business of working in the mines. But Mr. SLEATH has so often altered his reasons for prolonging the strike that it is only reasonable to infer that, if every demand made by the agitators were conceded, he would discover some new grievance. At first he objected wholly to the contract system ; then he m discovered that the directors were attempting to crush unionism. At one time he declared that the sole object of the companies was to reduce the rate of wages and now he complains that the rate of wages offered by the directors is too high. It is simply amusing to hear the peevish yelps from the labour agitators that the directors have only , published the maximum scale of wages. Why, there was not a single word of complaint about the seals of wages before the strike began. If in some cases it was lower than that which has been published, it was at least eminently satisfactory to the men and to Mr. SLEATH. The main reason for declaring the strike was the cry that the comfortable wages which the men had been earning easily would be reduced. It is only at this late moment that Mr. SLEATH tries to insinuate that the rate which was always supposed to be paid to the miners was only a maximum rate. But there must be many miners at Broken Hill who are tired and sick of such methods of perpetuating strife, and injuring a great industry and destroying the business of a large town. It is true that a very considerable number of the best and most rapablewoikmen-an impartial estimate makes the number about 1,000 left the field soon after the strike began and have found work elsewhere. But of those who remain there is a fair proportion who were formerly working under the contract system and who have never had the slightest grievance or cause of complaint, and there must also be some who are perfectly willing to work on the terms now offered by the directors. The one thing wanted is an assurance from the Government of New South Wales that every man who is prepared to go to work when the mines are again opened will be thoroughly protected from any personal violence that may be threatened by the more extreme section of the strikers and by the bands of larrikins, who are to be found in Broken Hill as in other towns. " , , If this protection is not afforded matters will only be made worse for the bulk of the Broken Hill population. Its stoppage of the mines, the interruption to business, and the fall in the price of silver, have brought things to this pass' that none of the mines will be able to employ the same number of men again unless better work is done. Time "ss . the depletion of the rich deposits of ore have made an end to the old system of working At broken Hill, is in older mining? settlements, the management must he i America, and the work must be done by contract or by some system which will ensure that every man whose name is on the wages sheet earns the money that is paid to him. The conditions of the climate ought, of course, to be considered in the heat of summer, when it is almost impossible to sleep during the day at Broken Hill,"" even good workmen may be unfitted for arduous toil during the night, and a correspondent in these columns may have been right when he suggested that the shut from midnight to eight o'clock should be abolished But this is a matter of detail The main thing is that the shareholders must have some guarantee that a fair day's work is given for the liberal rate of wages offered by the directors, and such . guarantee is best afforded by the contract system. The industrious miner his nothing to fear, and if he earns higher wages than have hitherto been made nobody will grudge a penny that he recent as But the old method of working the mines cannot be maintained In all probability it would never have been adopted had it not been for the extraordinary wealth of one mine, and for the sudden demand for labour to develop it But that mine has been simply one of those lucky exceptions to the rule which tempt people every now and then to put money into mining investments If he simply look at the other properties at Broken Hill, at the amount of money that has been spent upon them, and the sum that has been paid in divi deads, it is obvious that they must be worked for the future and more economical conditions The men have chosen a bad time to strike At the present price of silver it is less desirable than before to maintain the output, and whatever the labour leaders may say, they will find that the mines must be worked to suit the market, that fewer men will probably be employed, and that greater industry is required among those who are engaged in the mines The silver "boom" is over, and the miners, like the shareholder, will have to face the altered condition of affairs The RMS Ballaarat, from London, armed at Adelaide at 12 30 p m yesterday Her mails should be delivered in Melbourne this morning. The Government has not received any official intimation from Mr Munro as to when he will leave London for Melbourne, though it is admitted that he has been granted leave of absence from the position of Agent General for a few months should he deem it necessary to visit the colony low progress is being made with the Budget debate in the Legislative Assembly yesterday) the subject was taken up early, but Mr Downes Carter, Mr levers and Mr Campbell only were afforded an opportunity of speaking and the lastnamed had not concluded when the time arrived for private business At half post 8 a ghost appeared Mr Trenwith moved for a select committee to inquire into the grievances of certain men turned Kitchen, Robottom, and Bishop who alleged that upwards of 20 years ago they were wrongfully deprived of a gold mine at Guildford by the Bank of Aus trains.

been made by a gentleman over 70 years of age to whom we all cordially say we wish you very many happy returns of the day Sir Graham Berry bowed acknowledgement Mr Campbell exposed the fallacy of the arguments directed against the Public Service Board That board had been attacked because it had allowed the service to grow and because the expenditure had in creased But it was a fact said the hon gentleman that the board could not add a man to the service excepting at the request of a permanent head of a department As for salaries the House had the reduction in its own hands but had any member the pluck to propose alterations * He thought that the attacks on the board covered ulterior designs in the system and that the real desire was for a return to the old patronage days An idol fell with a crash in the Legislative Assembly last evening and the House can no longer look to Mr Graves as a dispassionate impartial and trustworthy critic of the Public Service Board Last week he averred that the chairman of the board wished to appoint a certain Mr Ramsay to be secretary of the Defence department but the board refused to do so because Sir ] Frederick Sargood wanted the present secretary appointed and he informed the House that he had proof in writing for what he had said The allegations formed the subject of two letters addressed to Mr Campbell one from Colonel Templeton the then chairman of the board and the other from Sir Frederick Sargood Mr Campbell read those letters to the Assembly last evening and members followed the sentences with great interest Colonel Templeton denied that he had ever proposed Mr Ramsay for the appointment and added the damaging remark that Mr Graves must have known that the board was not to be moved by personal influence because he had tried in vain to induce it to further the interests of a near relative engaged at the Custom-house Sir Frederick Sargood s letter simply consisted of the statement that he was not Minister of Defence when the present secre- tory was appointed So much for Mr Graves as a critic of the board A\ hat made the matter more interesting than it would other wise have been was that Mr Graves was acting for Mr Mason as Chairman of Com- mittees while Mr Campbell was speaking He had to suffer the pain of self repression for an interjection from the chair would have been a novelty Still he was given an opportunity to retire by Mr Campbell before the point was touched He elected to remain where he was The Select Committee appointed by the legislative Assembly to inquire into the Royal Insurance Companies Bill met at Par Marnent House yesterday There were present -Mr Zox (chairman) Mr M Intyre Mr J Smith Mr levers and Mr Patterson the object of the bill being to enable the Royal Company to take over the local business of the Queen Insurance Company the committee was careful to inquire into the stability of the companies It was found that they were strong Liverpool companies the shares of the Royal paid up to £3 being worth 500 and those of the Queen Company paid up to £1 bringingJ37mtliemarket Being fully satisfied on that point and having the assurance that a similar bill had passed the House of Commons the committee considered the preamble proved and passed the schedules of the measure the work of the committee was facilitated by the excellent manner in which all necessary information was put before it Mr J Warrington Rogers Q C appeared before the committee on behalf of the Royal Company and (Mr i Grant M Int} re for the Queen Company The Postmaster General

for having submitted to them a draft copy which they refused to adopt he invited the contributories to meet him yesterday afternoon and to hear it rehad Nearly 100 gentlemen assembled accordingly in the board room at Broken Hill Chaml era Mr Simpson thought it unnecessary to explain the matters upon which he and his colleagues had disagreed but was of opinion that the facts embodied in his report should be made known before the other meeting was held Several of those present at once raised the question as to whether Mr Simpson ought not to wait till the committee had submitted its report and for the next 10 minutes the room was in an uproar The Rev W H Fitchett warmly contended that Mr Simpson was acting dishonourably and he wanted to move that the report should not be heard Others seemed to think that as Mr Simpson had engaged the room he had a right to read what he please 1 Mr Simpson declined to say whether he had pledged himself not to divulge any information until the meeting of the following day All he proposed to do was to give a statement of facts, all of which he was prepared to substantiate in a court of law. " It isdiBhonourableeven to listen to such a statement,' said Mr Hatchett 'If}OU think that,' was the reply, "You had better leave the room But Mr Fitchett elected to remain The report proved to be a long one, and many of the statements it contained were startling according to Mr Simpson's report the assets of the Mercantile Bank under the heading of ' Bills receivable and other ad- vance ' are valued by the liquidators at £015 000, or £835 000 less than the value placed upon them by the directors in Feb- ruary last, 14 business days before the bank closed its doors The committee of investigation were of opinion that these assets were worth at the outside £800,000 'His liabilities are estimated at close upon £1,GOO,000 the funds in hand amount to £199,000, or about sufficient to pay a dividend of 2s 6d in the £ When the accounts are closed the committee believe that the shareholders will be called upon to meet a liability of at least £475 ;000, and as there are less than 100 000 shares are minding good on the books, a call of £3 per share will be needed to pay the creditors Large sums for interest, said Mr Simpson have been added from time to time to the debit balances, treated as profit, but never received, and distributed as dividends either out of the creditors money or out of capital The moneys owing to the bank by what Mr Simpson termed I " the Davies companies and their tentacles amounted to £bo9,000, or over two fifths of the total liabilities and the loss to the shareholders on these amounts was estimated at £512,000- a closer examination I would probably add to the sum of the relations between the ' Davies con 'J James and the Mercantile Bank were exhibited very clearly in the report prepared by Mr Simpson There were half a dozen or more of these companies, and large sums of money were advanced to them, usually upon the security of each others shares At the present time the two ' Gascoigne [ companies, in which Sir Matthew Davies I holds the great bulk of the shares, are debtors to the extent of EGG 000, upon which the loss is estimated it £39,000 Another Company, now called the Victoria trust and Agency Company, has a subscribed capital of j£20,800, of which Sir Matthew Davies holds nearly £18,000, and tins company is in debt to the bank to the extent of £3.5,145, upon which the estimated loss is £22,'k>2 As late as March, bill, £25,000 was advanced to one of the Gascoigne companies and the manager, being instructed to find ' some other satisfactory company to take another £25,000, gave it to the Victoria Trust and Agency Company In December, 1891, £18,000 was advanced to the Australian Mortgage and 1 mines Company, and the money was paid to the credit of the Colonial Investment Company, ' so that at the meeting in Feb- mary last Sir Matthew Davies was able to say that "the Colonial Investment Company does not owe a penny to the bank ' But at the same moment the Australian Mortgage and finance Company owed the bank £27,000, and part of the security was the guarantee of the Colonial Investment Com- , pany The manufacturers of silk hats waited on the treasurer yesterday and asked that the present duty of 5s per but should be in creased, as the cheapness of labour and material in England as compared with the prices paid in this colony in reality nulli bed the duty It was represented that about half the silk hat makers in Melbourne were on not work at present, but that if the local market were secured to the manufacturers here they would all be employed About half the hats used in the colony were imported, notwithstanding that the local makers claimed to be able to turn out an article equal to that imported Sir Graham Berry, in replying, said that the Government did not intend to revise the tariff thoroughly this session The problem would, however, have to be faced as to whether the Legislature was prepared to see local manufactures wiped out by having to compete with articles made by cheap labour, or to afford them sufficient protection against foreign manufactures so as to enable them to secure the home market. The application of the deputation would not be forgotten, and if it did not receive consideration this session it would be dealt with next session, when a general revision of the tariff would be undertaken A deputation from the importing and manufacturing booksellers and stationers waited on the 'I Treasurer yesterday, and submitted resolutions arrived at at a meeting of the trade held on Monday evening regarding certain alterations in the tariff It was asked that there should be a duty of 45 per cent, on document and waste paper baskets, one of 35 per cent on blotters writing pads, billheads, account, cheque, and copy books, letter clips, bill files, labels, purses, and pocket books, and a duty of 20 per cent on albums cards, envelopes, inkstands, memo slates tablets writing and stationery cases, and fancy baskets 'The deputation also asked that copy books without head lines, calendars in book form, or with pictures, with spaces left blank for printing thereon, porch ments, and bottles of any kind containing ink should be admitted free Sir Graham Berry promised to consider the application, and said that it the manufacturers were agreed that certain articles should be admitted free in order to assist trade there was no reason why that should not be done The agitation which recently arose in connection with the Hamilton Rabbit Factory for a reduction of the railway freight on rabbits has led the Acting Railway Commis- sioners to make an important concession to the industry For the last few weeks the district traffic superintendents of the department have been inquiring into the scope, importance, and merits of the rabbit preserving industry in all parts of the colony, and, whatever may be the nature of their reports, the commissioners have decided that the freight on all lines shall be reduced one half, that is from 4d per ton per mile to 2d the commissioners are endeavouring to enter into a special arrangement with the proprietors of the Hamilton rabbit preserving works, the element of water competition h owing, it is said, to be taken into consideration in this case the Minister of Public Works has decided that rails a} passes will in future only be issued to the unemployed under the following conditions that the applicant must produce satisfactory evidence of having obtained employment, and be able to give the name and address of the employer, that a certificate from some well known person must be produced to the effect that the applicant is in destitute circumstances and not able to pay his railway fare and that the persons receiving passes must refund the cost of them when they are in a position to do so The Acting Railway Commissioners propose to make further retrenchment amongst the locomotive enginedrivers by rearranging the basis on which they shall be paid. They have had a report prepared showing the principle on which payment is now mode On the south suburban lines the drivers are paid on the basis of nine hours a day, and on the south suburban lines, owing to the intermittent character of the work, the drivers are paid from day to day, for example, a man who worked 10 hours one day would be credited with one day, and the next day if he worked only 70 hours it would count as a day also-the 17 hours thus counting as two days Drivers of the Geelong passenger trains are paid on the mileage basis, one day being allowed for 100 miles I or two trips occupying 144 hours payment is made for 189 day on the mileage basis, but if paid on the nine hours basis the payment would only be for 149 day The drivers of Geelong goods trains are paid for the actual time on duty Dm ers of the Seymour passenger trains rum 122 miles and are paid on the mileage basis for 13 day, the working time being 66 hours The driver of the Bendigo passenger train runs from Melbourne to Bendigo and back in one day, or 20 miles, which occupies 12 hours The next day would be what is called a " shed day and the drive would be engaged for only two hours, but he would receive two days' pay for the 14 hours A driver on the Lancefield line would be on duty for 16 hours in one day, including 99 hours'' standing time, and he would be paid for 13 day It is these "sheds says " and " standing time that the commissioners do not like, and they propose to make such a change as will considerably reduce the weekly earnings of the day ers The Melbourne Telephone Exchange, which is now regarded as one of the ' sights of the city, was visited yesterday by the members of the Chamber of Commerce. The interest taken in the visit was shown by the large number who attended In addition to the president, vice- president, and secretary there were about 50 other members present 'They were received by the Postmaster General accompanied by the Deputy Post master General, and the telegraph engineer was also present to explain all the technical! ties of the switchboards the visitors evinced great interest in the exchange, and expressed themselves well pleased with the visit At the conclusion the president of the chamber thanked the Postmaster General and his officers for their courtesy and kind news to-day at 10 a in the annual sale of Victorian pure merino and longwool rams and ewes and Tasmanian long woolled sheep will be commenced by Messrs I Fisken, Valentine, and Co. , at the wool warehouses of the Australasian Mortgage and Agency Company Limited, Collins street west The entries this year are larger than in previous years, and all the most noted breeders in Victoria and Tasmania are 1 largely represented The long woolled sheep are of excellent quality, and all breeds are entered for sale At a special meeting of the committee of the Melbourne Hospital for Sick Children, yesterday, the following gentlemen were elected members of the honorary medical staff, viz - Drs W G A'Beckett W Snowball, Charles Ryan, and P B Bennie, who retired by effluxion of time, and were re Selected and Drs.

The mummy of the woman is swathed in a kind of antique been, somewhat resembling fine canvas, and appears as generally represented in Eg) plan drawings The sarcophagus is in each case covered with hieroglyphics, the translation of which will be attempted with the help of the key furnished in the famous Rosetta stone The trustees of the Exhibition are anxious to hear from anyone who can give assistance in the transla- tion of the r characters to Greek, but already sufficient is known of the hieroglyphics to learn that the man was someone in high authority-this being indicated in extended wings, while other signs tell his name and history, the weighing of the deeds of good or evil done in life, and finally the judgment The mummies were obtained with some difficulty from layout, which is some 40 or 50 miles S E from Cairo Both are said to be mummies in a good state of preservation The intention is to place them in the museum in their present con- ditton for a time, and afterwards when the story of both has been deciphered to remove the wrappings Mr E J Lonnen, the leading member of the London Gaiety Burlesque Company, was tendered a complimentary benefit by the management and the members of the company at the Opera house yesterday afternoon The house was crowded in every part, and from his first appearance to the fall of the curtain Mr Lonnen was applauded with enthusiasm The programme included the first act and the first scene of the second act of " Carmen up to Data and musical missed James by individual members of the com- pany Prior to the finale, and at the termination of a humorous song, Mr Lonnen addressed the audience Custom, he said, imposed upon him the duty of saying a few words For years he had been speaking the words of others (with a few of his own inter pointed occasionally ) and he approached his task with diffidence, more particularly as there was no stage manager Of an) one else upon whom he could lay the blame if any, thing went wrong with the works ' It was a popular fallacy that actors were free from nervousness Many of them were martyrs to the affliction, and he himself was amongst the martyrs 1 allowing such artists as Fred Leslie, he was doubtful of his reception, but from his first appearance that doubt had been dispelled, and the spontaneous outburst of welcome, and the warmth of the support he had received, had shown him that all he had previously heard as to the cordiality of the reception he was likely to meet with in the colonies had been thoroughly well deserved He could not retire without testify as to the ability and spirit of Mr George Musgrove, and his pluck in bringing out at the period of depression an expensive organisation like that of mounting and dressing the burlesques the same as in London, and playing at popular prices He also had to particularly thank the press for its kindness.
