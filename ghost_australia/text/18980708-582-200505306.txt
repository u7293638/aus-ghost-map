APOSTOLIC CHRISTIANITY. In tho Independent Church, Melbourne, on Monday, tho Rev J. Watsford, in the course of a forvent address on Apostolic Christianity, said he was ashamed of the city of Molbourno whon every Saturday I10 road in tho newspapers an nouncements that certain great preachers would delivor addresses at some of tho churches, and that prominent singers wore onpagod to contri bute to the attractiveness of tho services. Christian worship was different now to what it was on the day of Pentecost, and had too little of tho Spirit of tho Holy Ghost. " How many people were converted in Melbourne yester day ?" ho asked. "Thank God some wore, hut were not the conversions at the present tirao too much like angels' visits, 'few and far be tween V " Ho had heard people say conversion was for the Fijians and other heathen races, and not for respectable people who had their car riages. But he folb there was much occasion hero for conversion. If a man cried out, " What must I do to be saved V' now in the churches someone would probably call in the polico, and havo him removed as a lunatic.
