:'..'?? ^jiiticat^^ THE INSOLVENCIES Hf MELBQTJEIifE. The bad. news of the continuance of heavy insolvencies in Melbourne is having the effect of laying another- of those ghosts of prosperity which the protectionists at the time of the Mel bourne Exhibition were careful to hold up to the views of unthinking men in this country. Crash upon crash is now the order of the day in the protectionist p&radiss;, and by far the worst is to come. Of coutsr the disaTmointed ehadowiets iu Sydney ascribe all this to the land boom; but at the exhibition time they ascribed the booming prosperity to protection. Freetraders ascribe the crash and the insolvencies entirely to protection, as it 'was owing to business men in Melbourne being hopelessly involved under protection that they flew recklessly into the land boom. It is the same- way that the spendthrift, taking a loan of his employer's money intending to return it, speculates on the Melbourne Cup and is ''struck/3 The large insolvencies are beginning to be followed by the smaller ones, and on to the masses the crash must eventually fall heaviest. Hundreds or thousands of working inen are once more on the tramp from the protec tionist paradise to the f reetrade desert, Sydney, and what faces our working men is the difficulty of keeping up their wage-rate against the incom ing outcasts from the protectionist paradise. It would be a great lift to freetrade if special train facilities were again offered for a visit to Mel bourna.for our shadowists to see it as it is, with* out a land boom and an exhibition.
