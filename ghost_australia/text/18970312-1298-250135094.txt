Five Years Aga. Five years ago, in this city inn, We passed a pleasant day ; Four merry friends, who ate and drank And were blythe as birds in May. We scratched our names on this window* pane; There they stand in the sheen, And prove to me, if to nobody else,' What foolB we must have been. One of them borrowed my cash (a dove That never returned to the ark); The second was jealous of my lame, And stabbed it in the dark; The third made love to a bonny we* maid, Dearer to me than life— Wooed her and won her behind my baek, And made her his wretched wife. And here I sit in the cosy inn, While the bright wood-splinters blase, And drink my pint of claret alone, And think of the bygone days, And wonder which of my three false friends I hate or despise the most, Surely not him who borrowed my cash, 'Ti« gone—'tis a bodiless ghost 1 Surely not him who stole my wife, That was not my wife, God wot 1 But might have been to my dire distress Had she fallen to my lot, I think I hate with thivleadliest hate, The fellow who slurred my name— Shaking my hand, eating my bread. And. murdering my fame. / —Sidney Carton.
