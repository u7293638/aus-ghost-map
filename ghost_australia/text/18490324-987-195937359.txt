" THE NORTH ARM, INTJERE^T." Wm have, the: exclusive authority of the South jfusl.aliun for " stating that on : Thursday the' •• North Arm Interest " composed of the following "land and ship-owners,", MessreSt*a4gw*iys Gilles, Shepherd,Fitjnis, R. L; Milne, -and Taylor presented no less than '' five memorials," and " one or two relative statements," to the Gfoveritor, on t&e; subject or tjhe, N?r& Ann, signed by 2055 residenjts ia Adelaide, 76 captains. and owners of vessels, and 209 " persons in the country." - " •< Now, it is no joke for six gentlemen to attack a. Governor sit ! once with nearly a memorial each and " one .or two relative statenjeats," bringing «p tke ?m' maarel M the superior magnanimity of ..his Excellency, notonly iti't&istiug; such close firing, bat in coolly, dropping tfte affoir, precisely as we stated some tendays ago he'^duldtio—the Port jSr*t-rtht North-Atm ^ within a ra&ba;&eS; > tben, after tH^fce iftatt^ ««ste ' viuereit was-^ thegraod«i! voof" gnns ^iwhich was" to ^have- td^ipolisl ^ Imt a ^ ^ ^ne 4o4he ^(>rtb A'rm interest^^Jiiii pnpTOd^o be lmt hlani: otherwise by officially demonstrating the fact tha£ reaching the North Arm was/as weTOaintaiaed,4o h^ held coaatdetation seco/uiary to a railway cpmmnni<;»tion to the Actual Port. 1 _ i &U;, the #o?emor takes the common-sense viewof the matter—namely, that if the accommodation for shipping at-the present spot Continues inadequate, aud cannot at a less cost than a railway through some five miles of swamp be sufficiently enlarged, then the North Aitoi, naturally more commodious and accessible, must be resorted to. Herein the whole pith of the question lies; and we want np "ghosts from Denmark"—no long-winded dysentery of words—to tell us what everybody has known for years. The North Arm Interest has now nothing for it but to transfer its shilling deposits, accompanied by an additional twelve-pence, to the existing Kail way Company, and to feel assured that the sooner a railway to the present Port is achieved the sooner its real interests will be promoted. The following is the Governor's response to the " Interest" .— The opening of a road from the present shipping place to the North Arm, and the erection there of war res and warehouses.,would, in my opinion, be highly conducive to the convenience of all importers and exporters—to every class of the shipping interest—and to the general trade and commerce of the colony. It is not, however, a work to which I see the slightest prospect of the public funds being ever applied. Concurring generally in the opinions «f Captain Frome, of the Royal Engineers, the Colonial Engineer and Surveyor-General, of the inadequate accommodation afforded to shipping, and to the public at large, at the present shaping place, I shall recommend that such concessions or privileges as may be exclusively within the power of, and which may be expedient for the Crown to grant, in order to facilitate.railway communication between the city and the creek, shall be conferred on that company which shall, among other stipulations, consent to be bouud by law to supply a traffic and passenger railway, not only in the first instance to the present place of shipment, but also, within a reasonable time, to the more commodious and accessible port at the North Arm.
