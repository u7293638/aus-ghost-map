A QUEER STORY, About three o’clock in ihe morning, as a man was passing down Athol-road, Sunderland, in the'Henddn district, he saw a complete outfit of ..clothing hanging on some railings. He thought it' a father strange circumstance, and, being an honest man, he informed.the .police at the Hendon Police Station, and they fetched the clothes. It was a good suit, and in the pockets wa,s discqvered a vratch and other articles, but in .money there was only one half- pbnny. The suit was brought'td the Central Police Station, and during, the1 mofning"d young ’ man, 19 of® 20 years of "age; oame 'up and claimed them, and they were handed over to him. He could give no account of how the clothes came to be in Athol-street. All he knows is that the only article of attire he brought , home was ms walking- stick. There is nb doubt, however, that owing to the heat or some other oause he undressed himself in Athol-street, and hung his clothes, as he thought, on the pegs in his bedroom. Then he must have walked home. The wonder is that he was not seen, by someone, because a man attired in a walking-stiok is not usually seen in the. street. Perhaps he was .noticed by some .belated individual, for he had to walk nearly half a mile to his house. If so, they would .probably have .mistaken him for a ghost, or thought that it was Venus—or, more correctly, Adonis—out for a transit, and there is just the possi bility that if anyone did see him the ob server’s condition did not permit him to be dogmatic on anything connected with vision. Anyhow, it is surely one of the funniest things that has occurred in Sun derland lately._'__
