Great Traffic in Fowls-— Speaking of the immense number of fowls received weekly at Marseilles, France, a London journal says : The fowls arrived from Italy in railway vans of the ordinary size, but Bpeoially constructed for this traffic. The Bides are of lattice-work, and internally the van is divided into nine tiers, or shelves. On each tier there are twelve cages, and each cage is calculated to contain thirty birds. In this way the prodigious number ol three thousand,two hundred and fifty fowls is con veyed in a single waggon. The' cages are provided with tins for water on one. side and for com on-the other, and tbere is a door in each through which any fowl that is injured or sickly can be at once removed. The birds are said not to suffer at all to deteriorate on their jonrney, though they oome from MilAn or even from Venice, and in many cases are sent through direot as far as the Spanish frontier. We often thank Heaven that we a.e not as the Italians in the matter of the treatment of animals (and no donbt as a rule we ' do so with justice), hnkcif tbe Irish poultry consigned to the matkeSof London or. Glasgow could Bee the arrangB^T*) that are made for the acobmodation '(g, *' heir Italian brethren, they would surely'- ~| ? to be delivered from the careless tJndhear.ed nesB ofthe English, and handed over to the calculating mercies ofthe Italian. Beggars Supported by Gamblers — Per- haps the gamblers are the best BUpport of beggars. If yon k~now where a poker game, or a faro bank is located— of course you don't ; you never saw anything of that kind, and I know . will be quite a surprise to youto learn that they exist, if, indeed, you know what they are— you'll always find beggars and loafers around. c~ \ ; Gamblers are superstitious, and they will not upon any consideration pass a~ beggar by without giving him a [small contribution. It would be bad luck. Perhaps there's a trifle of conscience about it, and they have, alter all, a sense of some power above them to be ap peased by their helpiig the needy. A' gambler will borrow to give to; a beggar. I have known aotors imbued with the same sentiment. I only knew one dramatist who owned tbe superstition. He bad a play com ing out, and the night it was to be produced, just before the curtain went up, a beggar tackled him. He gave him a penny. ' There,' raid he, ?- that's good luok. My play will be a go.' ? It was a terrific failure. ' I wish I'd given him a florin ! ' he said. The superstition was all right. The amount hadn't been enough to appease the goddess Fortune. i . His Costumes.— Bichard Wagner gener ally received his visitors in mediaeval costumes such as he always wore when composing. Alexandra Dumas, calling 'on him one day, was highly amused at the masquerade. ' You are all dressed np to play IGessler,' eh?' said Sonus, with his good-natured laugh, which rather'hurt tbe feelings of the author of ' Tannhatiser,' who nevertheless returned M. Dumas', viait when next he went to Paris. After eiame delay M. Dumas appeared at last, arrayed in a magnificent dressing-gown with large flower pattern, a helmet with flying plnmes, a life-belt .round his waist, and enormous riding boots.' 'Pardon me,' said be majestically, ' lor airoearin? in mv workins cOBtnme. - 1 R&n; Hn* nothing without being dressed in this marine.-' ??
