A STINGY GHOST. Dr Boyd (‘A.K.H.B.’) tells us in his Reminiscences that at Glamis Castle, the seat of the Earl of Strath more, there is a haunted room. Some years ago an excellent dig nitary, who was always collecting money for church building, had just gone to bed, when on a sudden tlie ghost appeared—apparently a Strath more of some centuries back. With great presence of mind the clergyman took the first word. Ad dressing the ghost, he said lie was most anxious to raise money for a church he was erecting; that ho had a bad cold and could not well get out of lied; but that his collecting hook was on his dressing table, and he would be extremely obliged if his visitor would give him a subscription. Upon this the ghost vanished, and has never come back since.
