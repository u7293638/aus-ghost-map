. to the Race ol Tragi o Actors Dead'/ -With one-or two notable exceptions, tho emotional and tho sentimental have entirely superseded that lofty dramatic expression of tho human passiond which onoo gained world wido famo for tho aotor. Man's taste has altered in tho years that lmvo elapsed since Macready and tho Booths, father and aon, froze tho marrow in his bones. Tho influence of those soul Btirring memories, however, has not wholly vanished^ and. tradition still commands rcspeot for tho genius that inspired them. But tho race of great tragio players is < dead. Only ghosts of what have beon now rccall out fading interest in tho drama of tho poets. And it is as though they, too, were woary of that higher piano and longed to descend to otfr grosser and more material sympathies. With inimitable, stage craft ai his hand, tho accomplished student vainly tries to perform the miracle of raising tho dead, but, af cor all, it is only a tinselled glow that rewards his efforts. Tho age is strangoly out of joint. A malady that might almost bo classed as paresisetio, but which it is the fashion to term decadent, seems to have attacked the world. Its viotims crave a tonic that pierces thoir nerves, that rather, tickles than stabs thoir overstrung imaginations. Thoy desire the horriblo attired in cap and bells, the clown with a crown of thorns on his head. The majeBtio simplicity of dramatio heart must give way to sensational, theatrical situations of"contemporaneous interest," with Euripides and Sbakespiearo tucked snugly away in the background* Fate, after knocking at the door, must bo received in modern drawing room stylo, or tho public will have nothing to do with tho jade; And then? If tho "star" be of the first degree a great success is chronicled in tho box office.
