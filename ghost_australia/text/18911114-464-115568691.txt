Bulliwrag keeps a diary, too, and one of the lateit entries in it runs thus— 'Dined with Hor3emg in the evening. Cleared the whole company out at poker and made myself Equate for losses at whist with Blue bag on previous night.' My own ideas on judicial innocence were started by one of our Supreme Court Judges leaning over his Eoost a few days ago and innocently observing, ' What does this witness say he is ?' ' A pedes trian, y'r Honor/' replied an obliging counsel ' A pedestrian !' excla.imed the dear old simple minded party on the Bench,' and what sort of a trade might that be, Me. O'Connor ?' Even thi3 was topped by another of our judicial innocents who during the hearing o? a recent case looked down at the counsel for the defence with a sweet angelic smile and a^ked, 'Am I supposed to know what a 'tote' is?' I happen to know that in his Honor's youuger days he was one of tbe best amateur jocks out West, and when it came to a matter of sneaking the inside running, or legiti mately working off one of the uiany clever moves that the jockey craft demands, his Honor was just about as suiu-b as tuifmen were made at that perioi. And now ho naively a;ka if he h sup posed to know what a ' tote ' is ! In the way of tall notions d.merici is still first —the rest oE the world nowhere. This is proved by the fact that Dr. John Aitken, o£ Chicago, on behalf of an American syndicate representing many millions of hard cash, has coolly offered to purchase from the Italian Government tbe Coli seum at Rome in order to transport it to Chicago for exhibition at the Great World's Pair. This is no Yankee yarn, but a solemn fact, aid the most careful calculations have been lnaie as to the probable cost and tbe bast mode in which this colossal contract could be carried out. An emi nent American engineer is now in Rome on behalf of the syndicate, and he proposes that tbe re mains of the tims-honoured building shall be divided into twelve section?, the stones carefully numbered, and the whole conveyed to the New World by speciil steamar3. Thesyndicita bases its hopes of making this -c almighty dicker' upon the financial difficulties of the Italian Govern ment, which we are tald 'will not allow them to disregard the offer of a large sum in ready cash.' Just here I conceive a brilliant idea of my own. Our Government is pretty considerably straitened by financial difficulties also, and by way^ of removing them I would suggest that Ms: Oscar Meyer be empowered to take^jg-3-iovely harbour over to Chicago and_ssii it for 50 millions ' spot cash' to the-'syndicate as a fib companion ex hibit jfor-'fche Coliseum. The water could ba d^STVn off by means of gigantic squirts and tanked, while the bed of the ocean, the rocks, &c;, could be divided into twelve sections and chalked so that no mistake would be made during their re erection. This is a happy thought and it should save Mr. Dibbs a heap of trouble and vexation. Dr. John Aitken is a Scotchman and therefore nothing jocular can possibly be contained in his offer to convey the immortal Coliseum to the ? greatest hog-butchering and porksausagebuild ing city on the face of the earth. To mate the Coliseum a ' big draw' gladiatorial contests should be introduced with Slavin, Sullivan, and Jackson as Spartacus, Sporus, and Niger, but as Chicago is short of lions the wild beast contests would have to be confined to the pork butchers and the piga. Our lovely harbour would be par ticularly useful if another ' Naumachia,' or sea fight, after the early Chars' style, was placed on the programme, as the water could be turned on and the place flooded with very little trouble. If the harbour sale is a success we might then trade off the Zig-Zag, and the Post Office carvings and the Kiama Ghost and other luxuries, and so pro vide ourselves with life's necessaries for quite a number of years.
