Miscellliii6oiis. 'Dark Hair Add Fabe « BUib.— Iti the new number — the second — of The jintAro' pohgiral Review, and Journal of the Anthropological Society of , London, there is a very, interesting paper* by JJr. »fobn Oeddoe, which seems to show that tljepTe^ ference which English poets- -and EngKsh nainttrs have alwavs manifested for fair hair rather' than for dark is not shared: by the mass of English people, : and that fair hair is consequently becoming every, .clajf less and less prevalent in England.. The increase of dark hair in this country was first noticed by Mrs Somerville, who, in her book on *? Physical Geogr»pby,' mentions her strong impression that, at the time eha was writing that book, fair hair was much less common . among _ her -country men and countrywomen: than she remembered it jtit have been in her youth. Since, then',' at various time, many other persons, have expressed a similar opinion ; aud now, in the article referred to, Dr. J6tiu Befldoe pub lishes fact's which seem to -prove pretty conclusively that.. such witnesses have not been mistaken with reference to this matter. In the paper in question^ T-r. Beddpe gives particulars respecting the eo four of the hair and the social condition of 737 women who have come under r£is bb^ervatioa in his capacity of physician to the Bristol Rpjal Iufirmary. . Of these 737 women - the hair of. 22 was 'red,'* that of 95 *i(s 'fair,' that of 240 was 'Jbr^wp,'*. ihat'ot 336 was ' dark brown,'' jand thai of 3$Vas ' black/'.

There ^as some time ago, if'I jfemember right, a little rdiscus^ion on the above subject in jrour very: ti&efal; paper. The -point . in dispute was as to whether a lady was at liberty to refuse acharacter to her late servant, and, if a», h:owr, ibis; was to be done. Now; it has iaJtfeiy' been brought Ao my knowledge that the law ? in this matter is far more in favour -of- employers than is generally known; aind I think that all ladies should know whatis the real state of the case, because I have often heard them say (ae was' said by^ one or more in the discussion referred- to- above) that1 they feared to tell the whole iruih About their late servant, lest they might be /called upon to prove it io a court of justice or to be indicted for slander. We^aU%n^\ha£circuostances are brought to our' knowledge in various, ways, and especially \ through fellow- servants and others, which wo find, on investigation, to be quite true, and yet our' informants would no£ jike to l-e br.oughtinto a' coogi to: prove their statements and perhaps to be' brow-' beaten there tiy a deter attorney.' The result of this want of knowledge oi the law,; on the part of ladies, is ^1 speak from' repeated instances that have come to my own knowledge) that they either jgi re a character to the servant wbieh, nine times' ouitof ten^.he is not entitled to, from real fear of tilling the truth5, or else they abstain from answering' the letter asking for the character; being, afraid even to decline giving one. By ituis. conduct undeserving servants. ' often fare as well as., deserving ones, and Taini lies get undesirable inmaies whoie i bad qualities they only find out by bitter experience^ and theh many an expla naUohls heard as to' the uii truthfulness of the character received. Let :us be just to each other and to good servants hy telling ' the trutb, and the whole truth,' and we shall encourage tbe good, and prevent the bad from doing any further mischief. The answer to a letter demanding the character of ;a BerVsnt is looked^ upon in the eye of the law as a privileged conibiunic(Biti6ri,'and the person wi-iting is only 'required to tell the truth to the best of his knowledge. A letter to a third person, giving an opinion/ or stating facts disadvantageous to ' a servant's character, may be considered a libel, and you may be .called upon to prove it;but.if jou are formally written to for So-and So's character, by a person desiring to engage him or her, you* are only required to tell the truth to the bestofyour knowledge. The information is considered, as* above' as a privileged communication, and you cannot' be called upon as if for slander. Since obtaining the above opinion, I have -met with a confirmation of it in « very useful work Which I strongly recom mend to all your readers — ' Walsh's Domestic Economy/ published by Routledge. ' A master is ..not bound to give a servant a character; but if be do give a character, he must tak« care ho-, give a true one, though, if the character be yiven with out malice,* ttnd to the best of his knowledge, no acdon Ues.' - .
