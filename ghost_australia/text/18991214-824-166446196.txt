MEMORY. It lies on our life, like the stars on the sea, Like the dew on the face of the flower, Like the shade on the sun-dazzled stretch of the lea, Like the snow on the storm-beaten boughs of the tree, Like the light on the wings of the shower. From the sunset-hued realm of the shadowy past Its wonderful light comes winging, Bearing odours of blossoms that dropped in the blast, With starbeams that vanished when skies were o'ercast, And music that hushed in the singing. And scars of old sorrows, ghosts of dead pain That left us all faint and weak- hearted, With droppings of tears that were once as hot rain, These too doth it bring us, and bringing again, Keveals that their sting is departed.
