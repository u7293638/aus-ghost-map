THE^DRAifc. ?-?;}?; ?' » ? ; Mr Talbot's Hamlet exhibited a marked ira-' provement ' on his previous efforts. ! He con- ! iirinod our opinion of his intelligence^ A rough hewn student of acting, rather than ah actor, he has the power and the will to improve with time. -? Creditable were hie' efforts to refrain from those servile imitations of (J. Jiean that pain us ; we trust he will ; 'reform it' altogether.' Mr Talbot excludes frdnv the character of Hamlet1 all trace, nay all doubt', ' as' to madness ; sane, intelligent/ reasoning' throughout, his Danish Prince is less impulsive than that of Montgomery; leas boisterous than that of Anderson, and less self-involved thiui that of Brooke, or of Macready. '? Yet, uS a whole, it is inferior to the Hamlet of Arider-' son; to mention other names, were to outrage them, and to trifle with the reader. His 'scene with Horatio and tho sentinels was marked by intelligence. ' Addressing all his words to; his fellow student exclusively, he shows' the art :of the poet in making Horatio to have1 seen the ghost, for Hamlet would soarcely have' listened to the report of Maroellus and Bernard. 'Did you not speak to it?' yoV Horatis, my fellow student, whom I esteem1 nnd trust. Horatio was~at first sceptical. He; said 'it was but fantasy.'' Yet when they deaoribo the tradition, 'The cook that is the1 herald of the morn, &o.;' Horatio'fl comment is ' So have I heard, and do in part believe it.' Why? Beoause,. in' bis studies, he had met' with a hymn of St. Ambrose, commencing , Prseco dioi J8m Bouat , - ...?;...- Kootlsprofundraporyigil. , ,- of which tho words are almost a Literal trans lation, and tho student of Wittenberg dare not question a tradition sanctioned; by, one of tbo,; fathers. They who note the Latin words in Shakapeare'a text ; ' the extravagant and erring spirit hies to hio confine,' will pause before , they deny to him a fair, amount^ ol , scholar,-,, ship. During tbowholo of the econo with O£-lielin,$Mr /falbot adhered to hia conception (with which we heartily agree) that Hamlet is free thoughout from the slightest taint of madness.

But we have 'said' before,'aad beg to repeat,' every actor hath a perfect 'right to his own. ooriceptipn of Sbakspeare's oharacterp, and Bhould be judged accordingly.. On , the . whole, this meritorious piece of noting appears to us rather a? the rudiments of good acting; than the perfection of finished talent, ' and ' when he considers that for twenty years - it wa3 ' stoutly denied that Macready oould- ever play aught but molodrama, or Bnlwer succeed in writing' a '? play, Mr ..Talbot will not blohph from that disci-' plin'e whose effeots made bo henrt-oheering the words of Disraeli on Jiis first failure,, 'the day will come when yoa sn.viiii hear me,'. ,,Mr Eogers'a, Poionius is genuine and ;priginai, sinking thOibuffoonj retaining the conceited yet sagaoious Jhumofist. :????'?? !.«.??'
