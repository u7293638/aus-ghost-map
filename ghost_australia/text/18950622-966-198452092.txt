NEMESIS. [By P.] "Let them stew in their own gravy." Thus spoke Mr. Playford of the Cookburn Ministry some years ago, and it seems chat the same remark would be applicable to-day. There is an inevitable day of reckoning rapidly approaohing, when the funny little waysofoertain politicians will require explanation, and apparently their enemies are oontent to allow the punishment so justly merited to come in the form of "consequenoes,"as the Yankees would say. In short, the following verseB probably oontain the eentiment, or at least the earnest wish, of the majority of South Australians :— L»t them remain, not to remove tbem seek. Their own misdeeds will vengeance on tbem wreak, AndNemesii through "consequences"speak. And so condemn, leave them their own undoing to achieve, Their practice 'tis to shuffle and deceive, And soon or laiethe lash which now they weave Will fall on them. When Parliamentary day is done, and night Of dark election comes, when members' sight Sees but by dim conjecture's flickering light, Ghosts will arise— The ghosts of promises made bnt to break. Of a meanness which would servants' earnings take, The thirst of sarplus ; Uturingio slake, That thev might show A semblance of that statemanahip, which we In any of their actions fail to fee. And hide again their own deficiency, That men may know Only the good—if Any good there be- In muddling, ahnffiins, and autocracy, And prejudicial reciprocity. Such good, I fear. Serves but bad purposes, and dees not tend Our present time of stagnant trade to mend, And should but serve to hasten on their end, Which must be sear.
