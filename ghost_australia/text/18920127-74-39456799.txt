SPORTS ON TTIE CRITCKET GROUND. '. The Launceston Cricket Ground is situated in an extremely picturesque spot, C and yesterday, through the energies of Mr C. Wsthen and his confreres on tl:e sports committee, fit presented a very R. pleasing appearance. Flags of every hue It were arranged at intervals in all dire tions, and these and the bright dresses of Tir the ladies, who attended in large numbers, added considerably to the beauty of the J scene. The procession reached the ground shortly after It o'clock, but the majority Ou of the public did not put in an appearance until after lunch. The attendance during dos the afternoon was very lruge, prob tbly ex cacding 2000. There was no lack of amuse- W menut for all classes. Bleckford's Punch r?nd d July show and shooting ezhibition drew 1 large numrbers of patrons, and a couple of St' swiniuing boats were kept going through- 0. oet tho dry. The music provided by the s e City and St. Joseph's Bands was listened O to with extreme pleasure, and a rather F. novel feature was introduced in the shape off of an amalgamation of the members of St. on Joseph's, the City, the Ulverstone, and in Longford Bands, who, under the leadership at( of Mr C. Trussell, conductor of the Latrobe Federal Band, who is spending a short holiday here, rendered several marches in such a manner as to call forth hearty and ac genuine applause. Among the most ad- ch mired pieces rendered by this combination Ih of talent were the " Eureker" and " Pun- co joub" marchces, but all were heard with much pleasure, and the manifestations of 21 approval must have been very gratifying. A As farms the racing was concerned, there is nothing to be said except by way of ur praise. " Still" running was, or appeared TI to be, entirely absent, and there was an air ta of gonuineness about the whole sports, wi which must have been very pleasing to the wl committee and others who desired to make hit a success of the initial gathering. Under la these csnditions it need hardly be said the that the various competitions attracted considcrable interest, and many of the 13 winners were rewarded by hearty cheers as 40 they breaeted the tape. The best per formance of the many good ones of theday II was undoubtedly that of F. Markham, who ov won the Mile Handicap in 4min 39sec--a remarkably good tine, notwitlstanding T the fact that he had a handicap of 10 yards. D The races were, however, on the whole o good, and were started with punctualirty. I, The members of the sports couprgitte, were hr Messrs Robinson, C. ?yathen, W. Carnie, W. Mills, E. Denton, J. Copstantine, W. I Thelwell, Burke, W. Chick, II. Weston, and T. L. Murphy, and they are certainly deserving of praise for the energy which they threw into their work. Mr J. B:rr- or wick ofieiated as starter, Messrs P. G. A Monaghan and D. Davis as judges, and Mr ti H; Weston as referee, and these gentle- b; men performed their duties satisfactorily, al though there w re one or two complaints er legarding the judging. As this work re. di quires a considerable amount of skill and t strict atentio? , this is not surprising; hi but it may be said that the ju'ges of did their best to give satisfac. ol tion. Messrs T. Bagley, II. Ma:thews, ti A. Mills and C. Wathen were the handi- it cappers, and except in the bicycle races the results evidenced that they were well up to their work. In regard to the latter, the Hobart men were practically put out g of a chance, though if Golding and Hallam d liad not met witli accidents they would o hniro made things very lively. Mr T. L. C iturphy, 'hed secretary, worked with lhi ti usual energy, and as ihe has acquired much n experienoe in this directon.' it is only c p?ceosary to day that he did his best, Theo result was that his labours gave sasisfaotion to all concerned.
