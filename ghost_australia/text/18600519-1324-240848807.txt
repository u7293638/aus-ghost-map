[ Next comes Brice Frederick J5anoy, Esq., banisters i -5aw, who seems more anxious to advertise himself es an equity lawyer in good practice tlum to gain the confidence and support of the coatótueocy. He candidly BWM that he is more soliciiioiis about the interests of bis «dieata in Temple Court than those of tbe electors ia the country. No doubt he think it enough that a gentleman by law, with the aristocratic stamp of the metropolis freeh upon him, should condescend to offer his sendees to represent a lot of plebeian proriBciak. Before this, bowerer, he has found bis mistake, and if hi« common sense or practical acumen be at all equal to his black-letter learning, he feel® ere now (that is supposing he was ever in earnest in his Candida tare) how mnch he has reckoned without bis host in foolishly imaeinine dial the electors, whom he has treated with snch hauteur and indiffiff-T ence, wodld tender "htm their support. Is it possible he conld expect to win, without even walking the course. It is needless to criticise either die first, or the improved edition of his published address, as he has not the ghost of a chance. Every vote given him is so much thrown away, and mnst he a positive loss towards promoSnfj the re torn of the best man. Before bidding adieu to Mr. Bunny, it is hot justice to add that his conduct throughout has been straightforward and gentlemanly, and that he had the good taste to present himself face to face with the electors at the hustings. His retirement to Melbourne, however, is not much to be ignited, as thie North-Western Province does not afford the proper sphere in which soch a man should enter upoa his political noviciate. Mri Nathaniel Harris, the third candidate on the list, requires more especial notice sit our hands than other of tbe j preceding ones. In truth tbe issue of the f election is narrowed down to a choice be-.' tween this gentleman and Mr. Robertson.
