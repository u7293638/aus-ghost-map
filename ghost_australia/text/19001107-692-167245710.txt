INTO THE STRAIGHT. Everybody knows the Melbourne Cup is one of the best run races in Australia, if not in tho whole world, and is always won by a trier and a rattling good horse. But what everybody does not know is : that the clement of cronk running in theCnp— cronk as regaixLs blocking and jambing on the rail tactics — is niijrbtv 6trone, though not any thing like so badas it used to be. It was the- custom to send out certain horses, with out n ghost, of a show of properly covering two miles, to block the favorite or favorites atthetumintothostraight,andthisdisrcput ablc game was practised forallitwaa worth a comparatively few years ago. The re measurement of the straight run from the bend to the winning post, and the diagonal line drawn from the judges box to the sighting post. minimised the 'blocking' business considerably, as the horse on the extreme outside has to traverse no more ground than the one on the inside. If a jockey on a. likely winner sees the probabil ity on approaching the turn of being jostled, bumped and squeezed on to the rails, he is aUo to pull out and run with the same chances of success as the leader on tho in side. Somehow or other jockeys have a fascination for hugging the rails, not only in the Melbourne Cup, but. in all big races, and tins weakness frequently throws away the race. .
