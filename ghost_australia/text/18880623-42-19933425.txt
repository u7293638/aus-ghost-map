Flotsam and Jetsam. This Should Have Been a Great Crow Roost Story. A despatch from North Jersey a day or two ago announced that crows had settled near Deckertown in unprecedented numbers, and that farmers were destroying them by thousands. The raids upon them were chiefly made at night, it was related, the farmers lighting up the rooat with torches, while they used clubs as well as shotguns as implements of warfare. The description fired the imagination of a reporter of the Sun, and he resolved to see the novel sport for himself. Visions of dark fields backed by rugged Sussex mountains, of hard-visaged farmers in blood-spattered boots, of banging guns and whirring hickory clubs, of blazing pine knots darkly reddening the scene, filled the reporter's mind as he Bat in the long-winded Susquehanna express bound northward. The shrieks and screams of the frightened and dying birds rung in fancy in his ears, and a number of ghoulish phrases occurred to him which might prove effective in the story of the night. These he jotted down. When he arrived at Deokertown at 7 o'clock at night ho buttonholed the station-master and asked : • • Where's that crow's roost ? Haw far ia it ? Do you think I can get out there in time for the raidP" " Grows' roost!" replied tho station-master deliberately. " What orows' roost? Where's a oro ws' roost ? What raid ?'' The reporter left the ignorant railway official and tackled a farmer, who was chewing a straw on top of a load of hay: "Say, there, Undo, whore'll I find that orows' roost?" " Crows' roost ? There ain't been no orows' roost * roun' here these ten year." The reporter's manner Bof tenod when he asked the next native " Have you got a crows' roost in or near this city?" " We ain't got no orows' roost here as I knows on." The next man questioned said: "Thishere's a great town, stranger, but we ain't got no orows to speak on. Barrin' crows they's more darned sights here'n any plaoe nigh to Haokensaok." Two hours later Editor John J. Stanton crossed his legs in the comfortable bar-room of toe De Oamp Hotel, and, to the reporter's plaint that there didn't seom to be any orows around, said: " If anyone knows about a crows' roost it's Dr. Van Gaasbeek, who is just coming in." " Thanks," said Dr. Van Gaasbeek. " Happy to meet you. " Don't oare if I do. Yes, make it applejack. Crows, you said? No, I don't know anything about orows, but I oan tell you about the blizzard." " Hang tho blizzard!" said the reporter. "Pretty bad up this way," continued the Doctor. " Why, when I started out to Bee my patients I took four horses to a sleigh and four men with ahovela. Then I genorally got in through a second-story window. Why, old Elisha B. Cortwright, out here on the Fort Jervis turnpike-road, had his house snowed clean over. He used candles to seo by for four days. We've got drifts here yot 20ft. deep." " Jonathan Corkondall's orchard," said Edi tor Stanton, " was snowed up so you couldn't see the top of the trees. It's a fact, sir. It's a big orchard, and it was level right over above the tree tops. Ain't that so, Sam ?" "Faot, sir," said white-haired Samuel D. Harrison. "Do you know any about a orow'fl roost?" put in the reporter quiokly. "Crow's roost? Naw. But you ought to have seen tho Bcemersvillc Cemetery. They've got a two- story house by the gate. Why, sir, that house was snowed right plumb over, and the snow kind o' let down in a slant each Bide, bo that when it paokod they drove into the cemetery over the ridgepole of the house. Fact. They took a funeral over that way. Ain't that so, John ?" "Hallo, Ike!" said Editor Stanton. " Hallo!" said the new comer. " Thanks, I don't oare. Make it apple." " Undertakers had a hard time," said Dr. Van Gaasbeck. "Why, one of them had to keep a corpse ten days after the day set for the funeral, on account of the snow." " The queerest thing, though," said Editor Stanton, " was Zephania Swartz's horse. Wasn't that a go though, Doc ?" "It was, indeed. Apple, ploaee." " Why, Zeph," continued the editor, " couldn't get out to tho barn for two days, because there was a 20ft. drift between the house and the barn. At last he got a ladder and climbed over the drift that way. He found the horse with his back clear up to the ceiling, and had to climb on tho manger to feed him.' P "What was he standing on?" gasped the reporter. " Snow, of course. It had drifted in under the door, and the horse kopt tramping it down hard under him, till when Zeph got thero ho found the home standing on 4ft. of solid packed enow. Isn't that bo, Doc?" "That's nothing, though, said tho Doctor, "to the house on the Faternon road. It was unoooupied. The snow drifted in'the cracks, and filled every room cleaa up to the ceiling. It's out there, yet. I can show it to you. Tact, isn't it, John I-" "Faot," said the editor "Why there's that drift on Manly Hough's place. It reached to the top of his hickory nut tree*. When the snow packed he walked out on the oruat and picked hickory nuts. Lsn't thut so, Dj Camp !■"' "That's bo," eaiil the hotel man, entering tho rooai. "I had Bome of tho nuts. This time on :ue, gontlemou. What is it ?" "Applejaok." " Oh, thia is a great country," Baid a new comer. _ . " Hallo, LouiK," said the Dootor. " This is Louis Solomon, our olothing dealer, Mr. Sun What'll you have, Louis?" " Apple," said Mr. Solomon. " Do you know anything of a orow roost 'round here?" ashed the reporter. Mr. Solomon didn't. "Great country?" Baid Mr. Harrison. " Well, I should say so. Wo had a man here who oould lift a rook that four oxen couldn't move." " No- o-o," said the reporter. "Faot, I saw him do it, myself. They hitohed the oxen to the rook afterward, and they couldn't budge it. Ain't that so, John ?" "That'B so. Another thing about this country is that people live long here, too," said the editor. " There's old John Lott." "Yee," interrupted Mr. Harrison, "he's 134 years old." " No, no," said tho editor; " we're telling strict truth now—have been all along. John Lott is known to bo 104 years old. He's had five wives and thirty-two children. Old Sol Lott, ono of his sons, it 75 years old, and living near here. Another son is a dominie over the mountain. ] John's a cooper, and;up to last autumn worked every day at hi* trade. ' " He smokes, chews, and drinks applejaok up to the handle," interposed Mr. Harrison. "I hear he wants to get married again," said a bystander. "I'm not surprised," said the Doctor. "Two years ago he walked over from his house at Pochunk to Unionville, six miles, had a painful surgical operation performed, and walked baok the same night. He oan remember ninety years ago. He used to fight along with Tom Quirk, the Pike county Indian killer, and tells great stories about those old times—stories we can verify, too, and have verified by history. Ho was a great rifle shot, and oould bring down a redskin in the prettiest way in the world. He's no mean shot now, old as he is." " Last year he fetched a boatload of wood down the Wallkill all by himself," said a bystander. " Water -wasjpretty high, too, and it was no easy steering, I oan tell you." " Why, it ain't so long ago he walked over here six miles to pay me a dollar he owed me," said another. " Somebody offered him a ride back, but he said he wasn't no boy and walked it." " Well, I must admit," said the roportor, " that this is a wonderful country, only you den't have orows." " But we've got ghosts," put in the editor. " The sensation of the county up to the blizzard was the Liberty ville ghost. No one ever saw it, but hundreds heard it. It haunted the Quick House at Libertyville, two miles and a half out. The house was built thirty years or more ago by Mrs. Prisoilla D. Quiok. There was some trouble there years ago, I forget just what, but it was predioted then that the house would, some day be haunted. Young John Russell has lived there lately with his wife. The first mysterious occurrences were soon after Christmas, when a load rapping was heard at the door. Nobody appeared when the door was opened, but a heavy tread soon afterwards was hoard on the stairs. The tread followed the stairs to the top, but nobody oould be seen. After that strange rustlings like the crumpling of paper were heard in the chimneys, and noises on the roof like the tearing off of shingles. Mrs. Russell was nearly scared to death. Neighbours were called in and heard the same sounds. Not long afterward the same occur rences were repeated and kept up at more ox less distant intervals for a long while. The townspeople got alarmed, and as the news spread over tho country people came from distant parts to see for thomsolves. At last they deoidod to lay the ghost. Will Van Gor den, the blacksmith, led the movement, and everybody began to sharpen old weapons and polish up pistols and muskets. But suddenly the noises all ceased. They began to oome back again after a while, and new prepara tions to lay tho ghost were made. Then the blizzard came on. The next morning at the railroad station a stout young man with a wearied look bought a tioket to Now York. To the reporter's greeting he said: "I am an artist from Frank Leslie*t. I came up here last night to draw a picture of a orow roost which was said to exist nereabouts." The artist and the reporter shook hands.— New York Sun.
