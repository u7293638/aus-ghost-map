EDUCATIONAL BLADDER- SKITES. (Vide Cartoon.) Yonder pic Lure dotli disclose Dibbs and Stuart dealing blows — Blindly fighting — and their wrath Bubbles up like ocean froth ; Mounted on their sorry screws uracil defends his special views. Mr. Stuart calmly swears By the ghost of Thomas Sayers, By that wig with glistening hairs (That which Mr. Speaker wears), By the eye of Parkes, which glares, By his hand which never spares, By the garish light which flares, By the gallery and stairs, . By the newest Yankee stove, By all things beneath, above, That, uphold each member shall Views "Denominational." Dibbs comes on with glaring eye, " Education' !" is his cry; What's your slogan, Mr. D. ? " Non-sectarian and free !" Mounted on his hobby " League," Dibbs can never feel fatigue. Knights of old were wont to vent Passion in the tournament — Bravely fighting — cheered the while By the light of beauty's smile ; They were champions grim and fierce, They believed in " carte " and "tierce." Our colonial Thomas Cribbs — (Mr. S. and Mr. Dibbs) — Up to the attack advance, Scorning pomp and circumstance. Very little thought of care Have the angry warlike pair ! For the rules respecting tierce, If each other's hide they pierce ; The only " carte " for which they pray Is carte blanche from Mr. A. j This one boon they would beseech, ! Perfect liberty of speech. j Give them, this. and they, 'tis seen, j Need no smile from beauty's queen ; I Need no gleam of radiance rare j From the glance of woman fair ; i In their eyes it never shone Like a smile from Robertson. Come not, queen of Beauty, back ! Thou must yield thy place to Jack.
