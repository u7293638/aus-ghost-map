This was a most com forting reflection, and I recollect sprinirinir out through the ' lazaretto hatch with m spirited a enper nsevcr I had out at any timo: in my life. J I, roplaoed tho hatch-covor, and having rpsolvod upon the nftmost of the four cabins as my bedroom, entered it to see what kind of accommodation it would yield me. I hung up the lantern and looked into tho cot, that woa slung athwartships, and spied a couple' of rugs or blankets, which I pulled out' having no fancy to lio under them.- The deck was like an old clothes' shop, or the wimlroho of a travelling, troop af actors. X-'rom tho confusion m this and the ndjoiniug cabins I concluded that there had been a Misli at the last, a ivild ovcrhanlhig and lungmp' about of clothes for ftrticlon of moro value hidden amongst them. But just as likely ns. not the disorder merely indicated tlio slovenly indifference of plunderers to tho fnuts ;of a. pillage tiiat had overstocked them. 1 ' . .The first garment I picked iip was ri'cloak v ,,L.80r-, -inatciiil, . richly ftirred aud lined ' all thctbntfcofis but one had been cut on, and tbat which remained was silver I sprcud it in the coti as it wks a sbft thing to he .upon.

Tlio -lantern diffused . but a small light) aud tho flickering of tho fire- made a inovomeqt of shadows about mo. I .was separated from tho great cabin where the fijpircs. wero by the little, arms-room only, and the passage to it ran thero in blackness. \ : - -- .

Putrefaction is a natural law, but it isbanlkod by, frost, and just as'docay Is hiudorod by cold; might not the proporty of life ho -left linaifeoted in a body;- though it should bo numbed1 in a marble form for fifty years ?. This was a tcrriblo fancy - to possess a man situated as I was. nnd it so worked in mo that again and again I caught mysolf lookiiig first forward, then aft, as though, Heaven holp mo ! my secret instincts foreboded that at any moment I should bohold somo form from , tho forecastle, or one of thoso figures ill tho cabin, Btalking in, aud coming to my" side Rilontly seating hiinsolf.

' . " I durst not look at tho figures, but, setting, tho light down at tlio foot of , tlio ladder, squeezed through tho companion-door on to thodeok. My fear was afover inits wny, and I did not feci tlio oold. Thoro was no star to ho seen, but tlio whiteness of tho tho ioo was flung out in a wild strango glare by. tho blackness of tho sky, and mado a light of its own. It wus tho most savago aud torriblo picture of solitude the invention of mnn could l-eacli to, yet X blc6sod it for the relief it gavo to my ghost-enkindled imagiuatiou. No squall was then passing ; tho rocltH roso up ou either hand iu a gbastly glimmer to tho olrany of tho lieavcus ; thb galo swopt over head iu a wild, mad -blending of .whistlings, roarings, and cryings in many, kovs; falhug on a sudden into a dolefnl wailing, thou w brt"al>'tkefun furv "of its ricW 5? .und®rcd-fikd tlio cannon- ftomg of. an doctno fitonn, ond j-ou woiild rirai rending and cracklbg WhnlS18 »00itW0?re wses to tho crash- big blows of the balls of shaddow-hidden orananco. But tho soone, the uproar, tho voices of tho wind were real-a bettor oordinl to my spmts than a gallon of tho mellowest vintogo below ; and presontly, when the cold wtts boginmng to.pieroo me, my oourigo .W?H « ""oh the. hotter for tliis excuraon mto tho hoarse and black and gloaming realities of tho night, that my heart best at its usual measure as I passed through the hatch and went again to tho cook-room. Iwas, however, sure that if I satliere long , bstomng and thinking, fear, would return. A small fire still burned; I put a saucepan on it, and popped in a piece of the fresh water ioo, bnt on handling tho brandy I found rt hard set. The heat of tlio oven was .not sufficiently great to thaw me a dram: so' to save furtlior troulfio in tliis way I took tno cnopper and at one Wow split open tho F,.and there then hy before me tho solid' body of tbo brandy, from which I chipped off as much as I needed, and thus procured a hot- and animating draught. : i _ Baking out tho fire, X picked up the lantern, and was; about to go,- then hfdtod' considering whether I should not stow the- flx>zon provisions away.:; , Xt was a natural thought, ; seeing how -precious food wus' to: mo.
