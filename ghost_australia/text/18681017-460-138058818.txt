Robertson, and Edward BelL Judge: Mr. Richard Tattersall. Starter: Mr.S. Waldock. Clerk of the course: Mr. Geo. Savory. Satpsdat, OCT. 10. One of the beat days* sport ever held by the Melbonme Hunt Club came off to- day, over the flemington racecourse. In the morning a northerly wind, raising clouds of dust, with a glaring son above, portended uncom fortable weather, bat shortly after noon Boreas veered to the southward, and the day became delightfully cool and pleasant. The railway the management of which was conducted with great regularity and despatch-was the prin cipal means by which people locomot^d themselves to the course, and by two o'clock then was a fashionable attendance on the ground. The grand stand and lawn were well patronised hy the H upper ten," especially by tbe lady portion, and several thousands per* ambulated the hill, where the little games of chance and other amusement* whQed away the time between the acts. The ground was in excellent order, and the surrounding hills looked verdant with herbage. The catering osder tbe stand was undertaken on this occa sion by Mr. Stafford, and we must compliment him on the excellent quality of the viands provided for lonch; his liquor and beer wars also of the best. We mart take credit to our selves for beisgthe moans of bmqpog about the reduced charge 8s. a bead; and, from tbe number who partook^ of the good things, ire imagine thaVtb'e jpubhc are thankful toMr Bagot for takingthe hint. ^Oieprograinme maided three itftplechsiaes and two %urdle races, far which,thaw* waie TWMF->&T;«ntrids.

Doubt ful, *itb her white Cue and legs, look ing all over a Zing Alfred, was not so forward in her preparation as the time she has been in training would bare led ns to expect, yet there was a jumping look about her that took the eye, and the Adelaide horse, Sir Dominic, walked oat of the paddock seemingly in capital buckle, and quite the catof a gentle 1 man who Ought to be master of the art. j Standard Bearer and Brunette bad no friends , daring their toilets, as it was supposed neither ; bad the ghost of a show. "Tbe nee Is jem* ' always to the swift, nor the battle to the | strong," is extremely applicable to the jumping I line of business, and a chapter of accidenta l | the ferouritss gave the victory to die ^Trifj Standard Bearer. Tbe favourite showed a fine tern of speed, bat striking one of die hurdles ; half a mile from home, brought him to grief, end Blue jacket got blown before he had gone ; half the journey, and made a sad example of himself over the sticks accordingly. Standard Bearer and Brunette were so tor behind at least 200 yards, the first round, that their ohanoe was thought to be totally extinguished* but "blood will tell," and the Mr/MwSn horse, oat of Flying Colour*, kept on striding, when fiie others, owing to the severity of the pa«% came gradually back to him. Wakefield on. Valentine, had to none the old hoiae'e W and took a pull before he got over the last flight of hurdles, which enabled him %o it a close shave for Mr. GoyderV hone at the finish, and had be not done so, Mr. TnMiirssH's maiden decision would have been considerably j more than half a neck. It was remarked | aa eomewhat strange, tint the opening I event of the season should be to closelr [ contested for by the two bookmakers, Messrs. Goyder and Coker, and that Mr. G. have again upset the calculations of the cele brated Boker. Harlequin was on the card aa one of the starters for the Cup, but he, like j Expedition for (be former race, ought not to have been there, having been struck out the evening before. The great Babbler and Mali of the Wannon had most admirers, audi although the former carried the craabcr i of 13et. 41b., he was freely backed at 2 , to I, more especially when it was seen tint Mr. Gordon had donned the straw and for the occasion. Maid of the Wannon looked [ bandy «,d well, but her supporters had manr l misgivings as to her plucky owner's maiden | effort in the pigskin. Mr. Wafaon's Acrobat was next in demand, and great confi fidence was placed in Mr. Pender's well- known abilities over post and rule. Stockings vti a men pony, and the ancient Cigar looked more ancient UiBh ever, and one could hardly but rqgret to eee the " light of other days" in tbe paddock. Vatbek was considered in eome quarters rather " a good thing," but hisannear. ancequite beliedtbe assumption. a good one between Babbler, Ogar,aod Acrobat, as Stockings made tracks' shortly after ?tart «ng, Tathek kept up a series of baulks, and Mr. Pyke came over the Maid of Wannon's heed rather ingloriouely opposite the stand, and had another purler at the back of tbe course, which quite extinguished his , Mr. Pender rode Acrobat with great plucky and when became down at the distance post the first round, hie rapid reeoveij end vault into « ® .*". universally acknowledged as really wonderful."

He refused twice, bat Mr. Q, forced "bun over the third time of ask* ing, and he took it so slovenly that he came down on his nose, but his rider's fine horse manship soon had him on bis leg* «g«in Cigar would have been a good second, bat the old horse's strength failed h«ni at M" hurdles, where he came down all of a heeifcaad gave Mr. Bullen a veiy ugly fall, which fo*ro*te!y resulted in a severe squeeze only. Bach us was made a great firourite for the Metropolitan, for which five started, and ft vety neat cut of* nag be is, but he etxuigied a great deal too stout for the chase. Old Laverton Lad looked well, and eo did Yikia*. who had the advantage of Mr. Gordon's steer ing, and who rode him very patiently through out, and w® the race with ease at last* {hue* «>ck hooked it at the fiat go off, and came down twice, and gave Chifbey a pyVr crusher opposite the abattoirs, hot he tamed up ell rigbt agam in the evening, with the ex ception of a black eye.
