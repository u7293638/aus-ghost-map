[?] ROMANCE OF THREE LIVES. [By Gebtettde 'Warden,] CHAPTEE XXV II.— -Truth at ? ' ?.''.-; : ^' , 'Last. ' , '? \ ,'' . \ As^in. a dream Felice heard tlie re mainder of Grierly's story. ; ' The brie- 'great, 'fact, of Maurice's .....innocence drove all lesser details from her mind. She listened, trying to fix her attention while the old lodge keeper recounted his adventures after he bad found the body of Eobert in the Arches, and had satisfied himself that life was extinct. ; ?I left him there, dead, just as he stood, propped up against t' wooden bridge close by t' river. I got back to t' entrance o' t' Arches in quick time, for I were in a mortal bad state with ..'. what I'd seen. ? There I waits, think r ; ing over what to do next, when Mr Maurice comes in aDd passes \ne in t' darkness without seeing me.' 'Did you' follow him in?' asked Felice- eagerly. , 'Noj I didn't. Where would ha' been t' good o' that? I knew t' man inside were dead, and says to mysen 'a dead man can't be hurt, and can't hurt anybody.' Well, after a little time Mr Maurice comes out agen, still passing me without seeing me. ' Had he seen t' body ?'.'.. I. says to myself. I was puzzled like, and tried to figure it allout i', my head. So I creeps in ;agen, and lights my bit 0' candle, and goes back t' where I'd left t' body o' Mr Eobert, and when I gets theer, danged if it wasn't gone J' a jV '?-,:??-': /Gone?' ? . ; '? ; ? '' ?-? -; ? ''?;; ; : ' 'Every trace on it. I couldn't tell / reeV whether it 'ud been blown into t' 0 water by t' wind, or whether Mr Maurice he'd shoved it in for t' honour ? of t' family, thinkin' another murder ? might be bad for its credit like, if it wur known. It wur. none o' my business to question him, an' I wur a bit sick wi' what I'd seen in. that fearflome.place, so I got out o'itas fast as my owd legs would carry me. I got .a cab to tak' me back to Stoneroyd, an' I sees' Marcus creep through t' lodg'e gatfs soon after, dreksed a bit different from usual, 'an' slinkin' so, close to the shadow :of-jt' hedge, that if- 1 hadn't been lookiiJ' out double sharp I shouldn't ba? eeen hi in, v It w er en' 1 1 ong 'aft e r th at I sees . you; mum, passin' out down ''':? to. t' town looking skeered like. I. could na saved, you t trouble, tori knowed you'd find nowt when ye got theer.. Then ye coom back and asks me,' .'Has my husband)passed through t' gates ??'? you says.; '''No, an' he never will,' I says,an' you looked at me curious like; but you says nowt, nor I didn't neither then nor later. If t' wrong man had_ been accused I'd ha*' up an' spoke, maybe. But you an ft- me, mum, and t' crowner and t': jury, we; made things allsmooth an' easy like for. Mr Marcu?, who has the devil's own luck- — beggin' your pardon, my lady. And I'd ha' said now t' now, but fair's fair, I've kep't my part o1 t' con tract, an* you must keep yours. . If t' Fenfcons leave Stoneroyd how am I to be sure o' my brass ? A hundred a-year is all very fine, but I may be fast for a shilling in a few years' time if my hundred a-year is away in ?Dublin, or France, or some other heathen country. Stoneroyd suits me, an' t'. lodge is comfortable, an' t' Fentons suit me— I'm used to theer ways — I'm too owd to tak' up w ' strangers. Puttin' all things together my lady, I reckon you'd better, bide where you are. I don't wish to turn against t' family, but fair's . fair. Arid as young Mrs Eobert here seems a' just and honourable young woman, I thowt she'd better know|t' truth, an' gi' you,my lady, abit o'good advice; onf subject. Happen you'll talk things over wi' Mr Marcus, while I go round to t' kitchen for a drink o' water. ? Ma' throat feels a bit raw after such a spell o'talkih', an' Louisa she'll do all the talkin' theer, an' gi' ma' tongues rest.' ' . : : : ' Felice ! 'exclaimed Lady Fenton, as soon as the sound of Grierly's foot steps across the hall died away, ? don't judge me or my poor boy, Marcus, too harshly !.'. 'I judge no one! -Who am I that I should judge ?' Felice said, coming and kneeling by the elder woman's chair. c But why have you let others bear the blame when you knew so well who the real culprit was all the time? ' 'If you marry/ and have a son whom you love better than anything eke in the world, cherie,' said the poor lady, as she stroked Felice's soft, dark hair, 'you will, perhaps, understand. For ^nearly thirty years I hare kept my own secret. Think of that, child ! Think what I have suffered. How I have feared, and watched, and dreaded all these years ! Marcus was the most' beautiful, the most brilliant childr destined, I thought, to fulfil all my unsatisfied. ambitions. When a boy of eight he was thrown violently from a restive horse. . His life and reason were . in turn despaired of, but after more than a year's, illness he v&s; pronounced well. Only. I knew that he was not the same. Though still ex traordinarily clever and bright, he was at times subject to delusions, and the most fatal of these was his hatred for \is step-brother Eobert-, who was, as you know, Seven years his junior, Marcus has always kept a diary, .and, it was by abstracting the key of the desk in which he kept this ;book from bis pocket while he slept that I learned how, at the age of fifteen, he had planned to poison his brother, and two years later to strangle him in Bundhoe : Park during a walk | they werer, to have taken together. Indirectly/ T let him know what I suspected and watched him. But to me Marcus Has never been other than you have seen —gentle, tender, arid;; devoted. .! His tears, his broken- hearted end reproach ful protests, moved me deeply, but did not throw me off my guard. My great aim/was always io keep my 'sons apart, to prevent the .^lightest differ ence of opinion between thietri [ But Eobert was headstrong and obstinate, and you know the.resulfc. Every word, of Grierly's story is true. Only the scene in the Arches was new to me, although I guessed the truth, and felt convinced that Marcus was the guilty one, and that Maurice had no hand in his cousin's murder. I had never warned Marcus against Grierly, or let him know that our terrible secret was shared by another. 'I dreaded'the effect of such an avowal upon my poor, doomed .boy. We tacitly avoided all subjects that could pain him. Only after .Ned Grierly's murder did I openly accuse my son Marcus of the deed. At first he denied all knowledge of it ; and then, kneeling at my feet in a' paroxysm of remorse ful weeping, he confessed the crime, and declared that he had been prompted by an overmastering impulse which he UUU1U U\J\I 1CB1C31., JL.LIO lUZiUl V»U£3 [JUt into my hands,' he said; .' my eyes saw nothing but red, as though the air before me had been turned into blood,, and the .word p, ' Kill him ! kill him !' rang in my ears.' Marcus then implored me to continue with him always — to be his guardian angel, and to ward off his terrible fits of melancholy and frenzied rage. And that is what all these years I have striven to do. It has been a hard and an anxious task,' said Lady Fenton, rising from her seat, and moving restlessly about the room, ' and it has failed. I have done my best.' . :... ; Felice's heart was full of pity for. her.; but the young are necessarily a, little selfish, and long before her mother-in-law had finished speaking Felice's thoughts were far away in a little shabby parlour in the north of London. M may tell Maurice, may I not ?'..- she said, at last, softly, while she pressed one of Lady Fenton's hands sympathetically between her own. Lady Fenton started from a reverie into which she had fallen. '??? Mfl.riTMOfi P 'Yftsr von nWi'l/l ? foil him. He is a good lad, arid he, , and you together almost make Stoneroyd. happy and like other houses. I know* Maurice well. He is as tender, and pitiful as he is strong and manly. He will never betray our miserable secret. He alone of all of them has never given me a moment's uneasiness. You do well to love him, and you will be happy with him some day as you de-' serve to be. Why should the haunting shadows of this house fall upon him or upon you ? You are both of you made to live in the sunlight. Enjoy it together while you can.' 'And you?' 'I — oh, I am a shadow living, among shadows — a ghost of somethirig that was once beautiful, and brilliant, and beloved. The sunlight would shine through me — I must live in the shade.' Felice's tears fell fast on Lady Fenton's hand as she pressed against her cheek. 'And— he?' , \ She asked it almost in a whisper, in clining her head in the direction of Marcus's study. 'Oh, he will be safe with me, I think. Now that Grierly threatens,1 it may perhaps be safer to stay here. ? Or else we must pay him a sum of money 'down. I must consult Marcus, Lady Fenton said with a weary * sigh as she crossed the room towards , the dcor.. ;?'.,,: Felico did not attempt to follow her. Her horror of Marcus was at that tnument.so intense that she dared- not \ (riist ...herself in 'his presence. For his mother's sake ; she was bound to control her feelings, and she .could only do this by avoiding him. From tho drawiug-room she heard Lady Fenton's taps against the study door, and her voice, calling to her son, and entreating him to open it. Then a pause came. Ladv Fonton must be listening with her ear- close to the door, Felice guessed. A moment later old Grierly was hastily, summoned from the kitchen, from whence Louisa ani. Margaret came hurrying, too, alarmed by some thing in'their mistress's tones. f . Felice heard the strokes oil a ham mer—thud — thud — as it fell upon the woodwork. Trembling she advanced to the drawing-room doorway, and saw the frightened women grouped together, as Grierly's blows ? re sounded upon the panels of the stuiy door, which was securely locked on the inside. -. It cracked, shivered, and gave way at last. Through the aperture, all who looked could see Marcus i. seated in his arm- chair at his desk, with his head bent forward, and his back to the door. .,?? /:.';. ; .. ?;., . ?, ;„; , .' He seemed asleep, but Felice knew that the end hai eome eveu before Lady Fenton stepped into the room, and laid her hand over his motionless heart. ' 'Poor boy ! My poor boy !' And, as if he had been a child again she drew her dead Bon's-head against her shoulder, rocking him to and fro, while she tenderly smoothed his hair with her fingers. ' '- .?« Look' Felice, and all of you. Ho frill give no more trouble now. My boy is dead.' ' ', . But little more scandal concerning Stoneroyd and its inmates reached the ears of the dwellers in Olofield. The news that Mr Marcus Gilmore, the gentle- mannered and . poetical little ;gentleman of well known literary taste and reputed genius, son to Lady Fenton, of Stoneroy, had been discovered! dead at his study-table from an accidentalat over dose of chloral, which he had been n the habit of taking for sleeplessness did not leak out for some days, and when heard was quite devoid of startling- details. All that night Lady Fenton sat up with her dead son's diary, portions of which, confirmatory in every detail of Grierly'a evidence, she laid in Felice's hands the next morning. ?Show them to Maurice,' she said, ' and then destroy them.' Already, as early as the office opened, a telegraphic message had been, des patched by Lady Fenton to her nephew Maurice, at his address in St. Mary's Grove. The telegram was worded ' C/o Mrs Whately,' and soon after ten that same morning an answer came. Mrs Whuteley.had opened^the des patch in her lodger's absence, and wired aa follows : — ? ' Mr Maurice left for- Liverpool yes terday. . He sails to America on board the Gallia this afternoon.1 - ' Within a quarter of an hour of receiving this message, Felice was out of the house and on her wav to the etation. , . .,',.-.'. Mrs Whately had said 'this after noon,' but had not specified the time^ of the ship's sailing, and ifeliee spent the journey in an agony of nervous ? apprehension/ / v rS If she should be too late; dnd if Maurice, failing to let his friend '£; know his address, should wear' ou^ more years in in iserable remorse i^'-for-: a v crime which hpv had never ?cdin-( .'?'?.- ? mitted ! ? ? ;:\ ;;-£f? -;';/::?' .'.'. : V'; '^^^ ,.\ At'v every station Felicb compared her -Watch with the clocks, arid teazed ?-? tfieJgua'rd^with.re^3eated'.eDquirie8;as..tp . the time when) the train was ^clue at ? ? ?'?'?
