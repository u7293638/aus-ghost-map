Daddy." In memory of F. J. HaUowell. These linos, by ouc of Attstralit's foremost poets, should bo read with interest by the majority of our readers, amongst whom the late Mr. F. J. Hkllewell was a great favourite He grew weary of the strife, Bode us swift farewell, In his Afternoon of Life, Ere the twilight fell. Nevermore—in any year — " Daddy" we shall meet, Like the Genius of Good Cheer Marching down the street: Nevermore, by happy chanoe, See his eyes that gleamed through their glasses with a glance ■> That like eunlight seemed. We shall hear bis voice no more, That, like gold, rang true— But the loss that 1 deplore Is the Man I knew. I shall miss his olasp of hand Hearty, frank, and free God His ways may understand ; Tboy arc dark to me. Earth with gladness shall be life While the roses blow, But the joy goes out of life As our old friouds go. , Let them keepdheir comfort cold Who of dear friends say— 41 We shall them again behold On a future day. II Meet them op a brighter shoro, In some brighter star"— Ah, they've gone loo long before, And have flown too far. Sure, the vanity Iransoeuds Faith, which thinks that wo Have a lion on our frionds, And their dc6liuy! But the heart of man is fond, And his eyes are dim. And he thinks, in worlds beyond, They remember liiin. Eastward, wheu the day grows old, Shades of things once bright, Dusky arms of welcome hold Forth to comiug night . One by one the faces kind, Pale, tuid fade, and pass; And the world they leave behind Is not what it was. Shall the Banqueter sit ou When iho merry din Hushed is, dead tbo lights, and Dawn Like a ghost creeps in ? Song no more thy joy shall bo In thy silent cell— May the rain fall, soft on thee, " Daddy" Hallewell! —Viotor J. Daley, in ' Tho Bulletin.'
