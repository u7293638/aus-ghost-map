ME. A. S. HAMILTON'S MEETING. Lust evening, Mr A S Hamilton, who is contesting the election for a member of the Assembly to serve in the room of Mr B Lee, addressed a meeline of electors ia the Albert Hail Thero was ft full attendance The chair was taken by Mr W Hiles, who briefly introduced the speaker to the meeting, and demanded for bim a fair hearlDg Mr A S Hamilton, who was received with applause, com- menced his address by asking the electors to recall the appear- ance of Mr Levy on the previous evening, and the manner of his address. They would look on the Levy picture, present it clearly to then* minds aqd then judge for themselves. Mr Levy's claims, as contrasted with his own seemed to be a fitting subject for the commencement of his address Mr Levy had told thein that he he had resided among them for thirty five sears, hod gained their respect and received their patronage in the way of business Heolaimed some indulgence on the Bcore of being a goodman of business for what he had done for the district, for his disregard of all creeds in the way of business Now, he (Mr HamiltOD) had not been thirty-five years amongst them he was known to them for fifteen years, both personally and in the public prints, he had contested four elections had nearly beat Mr. Darvall in East Maitland, - Mr Darvall, who bad deceived them by promising the Roman Catholics to have the State aid to religion restored-he had given largely by the labour of his brain to their schools of arts, hospitals and mechanics institutes. But these matters were beside the question at issue They were unworthy of their attention when considering who should be their repre sentative Mr Levy had a good deal to say about local candidature But it did not follow that because a man was a local man that other men superior to him should be overlooked in their choteo of a representative A local candidate might have all his views centred, as Mr Levy a were, in making money, and that was not what was wanted. A repre- sentative should have a full knowledge of the merits and dements of every part of the colony, he should know all the requirements of every part, and then when the claims of any of them were being discussed, he could tell the Assembly whether the demand was just or not, whether his own electorate had not greater claims, or whether its interests would not auder unduly if the demand were granted This was true local representation - a different thing to Mr Levy's idea of »t In dealing with the Gar- diner question, Mr Levy bad found it necessary to apologize for the Government and for the Governor He had spoken of the possibility of Gardiner having been reformed, and had supported his opinion by reference to some of his own Customers, m whom he had every confidence, notwithstand- ing that they had done a little service (laughter and applause ) But what had that to do with the question Had Mr Levy forgotten that Gardiner was the head of an organized gang of ruffians prepared to shed blood? Had the rea Spectable men Mr Levy had known and done business with, murderedorshotanybody* Had they bailed np an escort" But all this was irrevelant, and showed how much beside the ques- tion Mr Levy's remarks were. He had shown clearly that he hod no conception of the vast importance of the question The country would take the question up pretty Boon, and if this country did not. other countries would It would come to what he had been preaching for twenty years in his lectures, that no man who goeaout on the highway with the intention of shooting although he doesfcot kill, should expect or claim a Bingle hour's liberty-he is a murderer in his heart, if not in act-in his own mind he was a mnrderer (applause) It was a horrible doctrine to teach that a man who had placed himself at the head of a gang to murder and rob, should be let loose, that twenty four others should be let loose, and not among us No, they were too good or too bad for us, and we left other nations to be maltreated by men whom we were obliged to escort to Newcastle in the charge of police- men That being the true state of matters and the principle to apply to them, how could they listen to such twaddle as they had heard on the previous night, A great deal had been said by Mr Levy about the land question, and he was dreadfully afraid of the Increased sale of the lands He deplored their passing out of the bands of the Government, but he forgot to state the glorious fact that they were being taken up andsetfled upon, and that the revenue was largely increased by the settlement upon them He did not tell them of the many hundred industries which must necessarily rise in consequence of the occupation of the lands Was it compatible with ordinary patience that they should listen to a man who could talk as Mr Levy talked It Mr Levy, after that, was thought fit to bo their representative, he did not care to represent them (laughter and applause ) Mr Levy had bewailed the national debt He waa evidently quite ignorant of the first principles of política economy He had overlooked the fact that every new country with a view to making great improvements, mast go deeply into debt, and has a right to tax the future » They should look to have these political questions treated in a broad and compre- hensive way, better have the ghost of a statesman than such a contemptible exhibition as they had had on the even I Ing before. On hiB own Incapacity Mr Levy had been very eloqnent He hod told them why he could not continue to serve Liverpool Plains, nnd why he came to West Maitland to be elected He had acknowledged his incapacity He had come {Lo West Maitland forgetting that no place in the colony required a representative more courageous, energetic per- tinacious persevering, and more clearly conscious of large ability and Btatemansblp, and he bad acknowledged his incapacity The place had for twenty years been mis- represented. Mr Lee had been faithful M ¡far as he went, but he and all the representatives of Maitland had over- looked the subject of subjects-the necessity of compelling the Government to cease constructing expensive harbour works at Wollongong and Kiama till the nest engraeeM in the country bad been consulted as to the métns of preventing floods la tbe Hunter and the consequent Injury and devastation Where such a subjeot required attention, lor a man to come before them to plead his incapacity was a piece of pre sumption they would not easily excus- This was no new subject with him (Mr Hamilton) he had always insisted upon the necessity for something to be done They might perhaps be satisfied with Mr Levy but ii not, and they chose bim they would find him posted up on every question and if at the close of ins address they questioned bim hU replies would be candid and prompt-somewhat diflercnt to Mr Levy s Wlieu Mr Levy began to talk about education and religion it beoatne too serious for a joke Mr Levy told then that some one had called bim a Christianised Jew and that all denoan nationB fraternised with him-that he bad never askid a man what his religion waa Was it because he belonged to that remnant of a glorious people that he was to talk liki that' But if a sensible man put in a man like that lie was bound lo say it said very little tor either his education or his manhood Don t let a man be all things for all things He saw before him men whose countenance* showed an earnest deene to carry ont their own beliefs lue speaker then proceeded to contrast his own views on the subject with those of Mr Levy who he considered depreciated his con sistency as a man in making tbe statements he had on religion They would remember that Mr Levy did not know when the question was asked whether he was in favour oi de nonunalional or public education But what had Mr Levy s remarks about religion to do with the great question of Public Schools He (Mr Hamilton) ap proved of the Public school system as a great advance ment in this colony to anything that had been in existence beiore but still he believed they were yet iar from an> thing 1 ke perfection In the way of education He (Mr Hamilton) had in tho coarse oi his travels in diflerent parts of the country ectured in aid oi Fnblio schools' lately at times when he had scarcely a pound in his pocket He merely mentioned this to show bis sincerity in the cause. If he were returned he would endeavour to show the fact that the public school system had much In it that required to be amended. He would have large schools in the centres ofpopu lation and have them so constituted ti at boys would be able to proceed from the common iel ools tu the highest honors in the University and would make no distinction as to any child s religion The BPeaker next dealt with Mr Levy on the Parkes Ministry and also on the Opposition He said he condemned the Ministry in one part of his speech and applauded them in another But he (Mr Hamilton) delied anyone to gather trom his speech what his views were on the subject He then proceeded to speak of the small Opposition and the strength of the Ministry It became Mr Levy be said to give a distinct idea not only of the policy of the Ministry in power but ot the Ministry be would like to see in power He (the speaker) questioned very much whether they bad one man m the colony fit to cope with Mr 1 arkes He (Mr Hamilton) would be tue last man to give Mr Parkes hi» vote unless upon certain questions of clearly defined policy He knew the value of the power that he had in ins hands in the present House Did the electors want a man to represent a local want or interest or did they want a man who would go in and repre sent the united intelligence of his electorate One of the greatest questions of the day was that of education It was the vexed qnestion at home and in the colony He held this view at the risk of losing their votes that in regard to education and religion no public school should be established wherein religion was not taught-he mtant re ligiou not sectarianism [At this point we are unwillingly compelled tocea9e leaving much of the speech still on our reporters notes-ja order that we might go to press in time to catch the steamer for Baymond Terrace 1
