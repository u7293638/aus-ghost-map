WOMAN'S RIGHTS. To the Editor of ihe Geelonp Adcerliser. Dear Mb Editor,â€”You may call me a strong ! minded woman for daring to cail in question the 1 right and might laws made by the lords of creation! 1 t really Mr Editor when I read your leading ar ticle in this morning's paper, "that I have do indivi dual being, and that I am not a living creatnre, being a mimed woman with a live hnshand. I have heard that the Romans pnnisbed their malefactors by tying the dead body of their victim to the said malefactor ; but jast fancy a quiet man in the I9th century pun ished all his life for the simple crime of taking unto himself a wife. Jt is no wonder that there are so few marriages in Geelong. And as to us dead bodies why tre are in a worse state than the slaves in South America, they are allowed to be alive. Oh that I bad the judge that propounded so horrible a lie, I *oold make him know whether I was dead or no. Bat really MrfEditor, plead for us poor creatnres, and maintain that if we are dead we he not japisbed for any wrong our dead bodies may com ttit; vfe ought to have the same privileges a* ghosts ind play our pranks, and cut enpers, and frighten Jon living men as we please. I intend to do so. And if yon, dear, venerable, Sir EditOT, should bring fiieinto the Supreme Court, or any "oder" court, that being dead 1 am not responsible, and will not he annoyed, bnt have the privileges of my proper a Kite. Jane 7th, J863.
