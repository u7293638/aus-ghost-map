There was an old toU-house j tlie Overton-road, and as a rale Porter^ : passed through the gateway ol tins, on their way to the training - grounds. On Hie night before the trial, of which; (hev had by some means Jot the "office,* ; the touts obtained temporary possession j 0I- this habitation. Providing themselves ^ With liquid and other refreshments, and gome packs of cards, they arranged to make a jolly vet wideawake night of it. Bnt it happened that the other and principal par ties to this extraordinary trial were equally wideawake. The Kingsclere watch-, dog had the touts under liia eye. Said he to John Porter, " If you like, sir, I can, make everyone of them safe. There's a ; chain and staple outside the door, and «| padlock would do the job." The job" j was done, the horses taken to the scene of ] the gallop by another way, and not a tout saw the trial. Sir Joseph and Porter re turned by way of the toll-house, and found the touts engaged in removing a window- frame. Their language when they saw the owner and concluded that the trial was over was "frequent and free.' Xext year Pero Gomes lost the Derby by j a short head, and many thought Jud^ j Clark had made a mistake in hoisting Pre tender's number. Porter says the race was lost through careless riding, and thinks if | ^Vells had been in his usual form he .could j have won by lengths. This was proved , subsequently in the Leger. Pero Gomez j was tried twice.,-- The- first Tj«^tion he] answered mo^t' satisfactorily, bitt^ second time /lie was badly beaten, neither ownCiv trainer, ever understand bote- cafee Jt Jlosicrucian vkced-on with his final effortjv Tdi^~^l& 7^4*?

Summing him up, John Porter says: "He was a fine judge of racing, the very best hand at putting horses together I ever met with, and one of the straightest X ever knew. He played the game-snail blame to him!-like a sportsman. As he himsdf used to say, " He was not going to take 3 toj 1 about any of his horses when he oqght fairly to have had 10 to L" Full particulars of the libel on Sir Joseph I in Dr. Shorthouse's paper are given. Tlie j doctor did not write the article himself,. but he insisted on taking the responsib:lity,' and as it was utterly unjustifiable, he went to prison for three months. After Sir \ Joseph's time, Ieonomy, the. property of llr. F. Gretton, was the nest crack trained at Kingsclere. He was a wonderful horse, inasmuch as all sorts of going came (dike to him. He was "saved" as a three^ear-old for tlie Cambridgeshire, but owing to a; bungle in his final trial, he wait to the post without the stable knowing what aj certainty they had. A rough gallop pre-] vouslv was good, however, and Mr. Grettcn won £40,000 on the race. Mr. Porter thinks one of the gre&test; blespings a trainer can hare is a thoroughly reliable trial horse. In Sir Joseph's Hmp he possessed a treasure in XL At a later period Wliipper In was, he thinks, even better, j For five yeara "he tried everything, every j distance up to a mile and a and never j made the ghost of a mifiiplk." In 1882 Shotover won the Two Thousand Derby, while Geheimniss took the Oaks. Kext year St. Blaise won the Derby, and it has been said that this was a fluke, and that Lord Falmouth left the tarf in oonse quecec of Galliard's defeat. Mr. Porter cites several trials to prove St. Blaise was quite good enough to win nine Derbys "o«t °f ten. Shotover, flrtwnmtw, ar»f others were in the last gallop, and St. Blaise * on easily, with a disadvantage in the weights.

When Orate lost the Leger which La.

Lord Marcus liereaford, and ibe trainer. The' chapters on training, breeding, Ac., ere very interesting, and ere "well worth the attention of those they may concern. . Full particnlars are also given of how the boys ave managed at Kingsclere, and when he reads them many a trainer in Australia will wish lie could get boys on the nune terms. Mr. Porter thinks roar ing would be obviated by doing away with early foaling; be hates early two-year-old - racing, bat he holds a poor opinion of the average jockey, and doubts whether any good has come of raising the minimum weight. Altogether "Kingsclere" is one of the most interesting books on racing we have read, and it should meet with a ready sale. The copy sent to us for review has been received through Messrs. Melville, Mullen, and Slade.
