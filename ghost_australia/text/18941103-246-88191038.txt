BLACKWOOD. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) THERE appears to be some doubt whether the small whip snakes that are common in this locality are poisonous or not; but nevertheless Mrs. Saunders, of Simmons' Reef, who got bitten by one when gather ing chips on Tuesday week had a consider- able fright. The circumstances seem to favour the opinion that these snakes are not sufficiently venomous to affect an adult; as, although a neighbour cut and scarified the bitten finger with a razor, yet something like a quarter of an hour had passed before it was done. None of the usual symptons of snake poisining appear to have developed. The juvenile Star Minstrels from Trent ham visited Blackwood on the 24th ult., and although there was a very scanty audience, the entertainment proved to be much better one than was generally antici- pated. The Blackwood Athletic Club purchased some £5 or £6 worth of apparatus a few months ago, but have had a difficulty in hiring a suitable building in which to erect it. They have now got the use of the building lately in use as a Salvation Army barracks, at Red Hill, and the business of muscle development has now commenced in earnest. Messrs. Nelson and Burgess are making good progress with the erection of their battery at Golden Point, as they have already got the stamper box in position. The Blackwood cricketers are rather late in making a start this season. The Secretary (Mr. M. J. Croker) has made up the list of batting and bowling averages for season 1893-94, which I give below: BATTING. J. Byres 9 170 0 81 18.88 T. Vigor 6 73 1 49 14.60 A. Aston 5 55 0 9 11.09 B. H.

The present is an exciting time with the school teachers and children of the locality, as the usual round of annual inspections are now being made. The following is copy of the report for the Golden Point school, at which 72 children were present on the day of inspection, Tuesday, 30th October :--Percentage, 98. Building in very good order as regards neatness and tidiness. Furniture, &c.;, a good supply. Organization good. The timetables are drawn up with neatness and care. The classificaticn is correct. The school has again passed a very creditable examination in all respects. In subjects of class ex- amination the children show good know- ledge, but the answering should be smarter. Recitation of poetry good; but rather too much attention paid to metre. Singing very good. Drawing very good. Drill very good. Discipline excellent. The children are very well behaved, and the tone of the school is very good. Records very carefully kept. J. HOLLAND. At the meeting of the Blackwood Debat- ing Society on Tuesday, 30th October, the President (Mr. A. Byres) read an interest- ing paper upon "John Bunyan, his life and times, with a few notes on his remarkable book "The Pilgrim's progress." The rest of the evening was filled up by "impromptu speeches" upon such subjects as "procras- tination," " personal influence." " ghosts," &c.; The quartz mine at Barry's Reef known as the "Faugh a Ballagh" has been worked, off and on, for the last 30 years, and in the earlier years gave some remarkably rich yields; but, like many others in this dis- trict, the track of the gold seemed to be lost at the depth of 70 or 80 feet. Messrs. Walters and party have, however, now re- opened the mine at a depth of 90 feet, and last week got out a trial crushing of 38 tons, which yielded at the rate of over 3½dwts. to the ton. This average pays well, and as the reef is about 5 feet in width the party have every appearance of being remuneratively employed for a long time to come. The usual Court of Petty Sessions at Blackwood was held before Messrs. J. J. O'Meara, P.M., and R. Cameron, J.P., on Wednesday, 31st October. I. Bloom- field v. M. Lenehan, two day's plumbing work, £1. Complaint deposed that he was a licensed plumber, and that Mrs. Lenehan had engaged him to do certain work, but when he went with his tools to the place to do the work Mrs. Lenehan would not have it done. P.M.: Then you have done no work? Complainant: No. This practically closed the case, but at com- plainant's request, with a view to further proceedings, it was simply discontinued. Crown Lands Bailiff v. J. Pascoe. Unlaw- fully cutting timber in the Wombat State forest. Similar charges against W. Pas- coe, C. Hunt, and another, were taken together. M. O'Callaghan, Crown Lands Bailiff, gave evidence on the charges, but as it appeared that ihe defendants had reasonable grounds for supposing that they were not cutting within the State forest a fine of 1s. only was imposed in each case. The annual general meeting of the Blackwood Cricket Club was held on Saturday, 27th ult. The report and balance sheet, showing a small credit balance, were received and adopted, and officers as fol- lows elected for the ensuing season: Patrons, Mr. S. T. Staughton, M.L.A., and Messrs. J. Cann, J. Graham and L. Hay- den Shire Councillors; President, Mr. A. Byres; Vice- Presidents, Messrs. D. M'Far- lane, W. Hayden and W. Roach; Secretary and Treasurer, Mr. M. J. Croker; Com- mittee, Messrs. H. Cann, W. L. Croker, A. Mackie, J. Byres, and B. H. Speary; Captain, Mr. J. Byres; match committee Messrs. J. Byres, H. Cann, and A. Mackie. After the Secretary had been given in- structions to arrange for a series of matches for the first half season, the meeting closed. The Black Hill co-operative party have finished sinking their shaft to a depth of 63 feet, and in opening out have passed through a highly mineralized body of stone between four and five feet thick, but it is expected that they will have to drive a short distance to the north before reaching the shoot of stone from which previous crushings have been taken.
