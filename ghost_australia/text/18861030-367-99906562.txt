"Don't ask me, dear lady," she said, weeping ; "I cannot bear to think of it.

IMr. Talhot Ifalthaway arrived at Itelston only asout ten dans after lord Iteclton and his wife arrived there.

I loved him dearly, my dear, though I seemed cold and dis tant to him sometimes." "lie never thought so," Minnie said, wondering is she remembered how little Arthur had l1 ooken of this lovable old man who had been so good to him. 1'erhaps he felt it though he did not speak,' Mr. Ifathaway said, with a little sigh. "I was not used to the ways of lads, and I dare say I was a stern gcardian to a lively boy, but I loved him dearly. lie was my dead sister's eon, and very like her very likl her." "'lHn was very handsome," Mlinnie said, feeling that she must spealk,or the old man would think ther silence odd; "th o handsomet man 1 ever saw, I think." " Ah, you loved him, child," was the grave re sponse. " IIe was well enough, but no Apollo: bulint perhaps he changed. lHave you his portrait'" "SNot here," ady Ilelstonl riplied. feeling as if every qoretion of the uneonscious old nan were, a sharji stab.

I ot the dead past bury its dead, I ray; the ashes of bygone sorrows are always best let alone. Perhaps he will never resumn tIe subject." It was two days after this that Minnie was sitting in hier fao'ourite corner of the private garden with her boy in her arms. Charlotto Sydney was in the villtgo spending an hour or two with her own child, which grow and throveo apace in the sweet country air. Already the little fellow wias quite iat homeo ith the kind motherly soul who had been selected by I adv IIclston for his nurse. She would not have hesitated to trust her own child to the goaod oeman's keeping, if it had, been neoessary, she told MIr. Sydney, and Charlotte was well content. . . .. ... SAnnio, the undoer-nureo, was hovering ni.r, rerdy to take tho baby if he should cry. lut INinnio liked nothing better than to have her Loy all to lherself for a little while now and then, and to :foidla him and play with him in a fashion that would have horrifed many an aristocratic mother.

If the tears would only come and relieve this horrib!e pressure on her brain, she would know thatit w.s all a dream. She would wake, and this nightmare would go away and leave her herself again. Ah! no; it was all real. She was in the garden, under her favourite tree, and there was the first dinner bell, and she had promised to we t this man-this ghost from the grave again-at'ttn that night. " My lady, mry lady." The voice of her maid rouseod her from her trance of wretchedness and misery, and she answered mechanically, " Yes, easton. Do you want me'?" " Yes, my lady, I was to find you and tell you that his lordship and IMr. iGreyson have gone oat, and dinner is not to be kept for thems. It is some justice business about the poaching at Five Acres; and they may dine there,-if not they-oh, my lady, what is the matter? Has anything happened?"' Sho caught sight of her lady's face,'ss she spoke, and started back appalled. at its whiteness 'and rigidlity. " No," Miinnio said, in a harsh strained voi e, that she hardly rczognised as her own. " Nothing has happened. I have a horrible head. ache, that is all. I am rather glad the gentlemen are out, for I can get to bed soon. Don't look so Ecared at ie W\eston, I am nut ill." Weston could hardly believe it, for she totteredas she rose from her seat and tried to walk, and the maid had to give her an arm for the first few steps towards the house ; then she roused herself by a mighty effort, and except that she was pale, and seemed to have lost her spirits, she was herself agatin to all outward seeming. "I must thide it, I must hide it," she kept saving to herself. " No one must know till-ah, I disr not think yet- I must have time to consider." She succeeded so well in concealing that any thing had happened that her excuse of a sudden and violent headache was taken as su3:cient Iyv 1t ae II&cston; at least. Mliss Esther's quick eyes detrctct something more, and she was on thorns, gero.l od lady, till she could gethernieco aloneand talktoi lecr. "It is really only a heada- he, auntie dear ?"

"I wmrit to tell St-phen that it is paid when I tell him anything sat all about it, and i feel quite guilty when I think of it. If I get rid of it by the l..st post to-night it will do." " You shall have it, dear," Miss Grayson said, wondlering a little, for she knew tIlat hier niece was denied nothing bIy her husbanl.

IHer Inrain was almost turning, hut she went about whelt slo was doing with a calmness th.t was in its, l inl!i, ative of mischief. It seemed as the Iiateo were p:opitious to whatever shie had iu her head to do that night; for ai messenger calmie aga'n from the gentlemen, saying that they should be very late, and no one was to sit up for them. Ch'lar lotte cydney was in the roomn when her lady was told of this, and Minnie turned to her and aidu that in that case she ? ould have baby. She often lad her chldl with her at night if anything kept Lord Hlellon away, and there was only her pale face and evir'eot lie el:fahe mo make the nurse demur. " Won't he fatigue you, my lady ?" she naked, and Minnio said no. She should like to have him, andl nh would be slre and ring if he was restless, or she found he disturbol her in any way. " And let mo bs quitf by myself for a couple of hours,'she said to Weston and the nurse. " lThere's nothing elso for it when I have a nervous headIache. By bed time I shall be able to talk and take some thing." Lady Illston cameno in to see her, and her nont would have stayed with her, but she kew of old that when Mlinnio had one of her had headaches she liked nothing better than to be let alone; so she gained the coveted two hours, and was lottin silenco and darkness. At ten n'clock sab was at the place where she had seen Arthur Clifford, and he stepped from the bushes and stood before her. " You are punctual," he said ; "I hardly thought you would be.

"It imight be had for me to be caught, cerlainly," tie said, looking at her with malevolent eyes; " but it woull be worse for you, I fancy. lHavo you brought the money ?"

I should have courage to end it that way if in no ofemr." i " Secret for cecret then," he said, <oolly. " 1 ou shall be I aly lioloton os long as you consent to paV for it. I know what your fathor was fool enough to do on your birthday; I have heard a thing ot two, though I have bcon out of sight myself, and I knollo tloit you are independent of oveorybody, and can afford to pay for your little fancies. Look hero, my most loving wife, that would rather die than lire with me, pay me one thousand pounds a year and you shall keep your coronet, and I will never ilterfero with the right anl titlo of that squalling vouiugter in the house yonder. 11u shall be Lord l7llolln when his time comas for aught I will do to prevent him, and you shall be at peaco as long as you p.ay for it." " tou ask more than I possess," Minnio said in a quiet, hard voice that ounded noas if comeo from a distanei , so tchained and unnatural was it. "I cannot give you ati answer to-night. I must have limoe to think." "h ! talo time by all means," he replied. "Ileeus on ;ia the ginls say. I will give you till twelve o'clock to-morrow, and then, if you do not come to terms with me, I will take measures for my own safety, and I will blow the whole affair, and humble your lordly husband to the overy dust. Who is he that he should flaunt it about with another man's wife, and palm off on the world as his heir a--, ",Stop!" Minnie said sharply. "I will make terms with you, but not now. As you say, I will sleep on it. You shall know to-morrow. Do not come here; be content to wait for me in the park. by the big oak with the fence round it. You shall know what I will do then." " Very well;" he returned. "And you shall know, too, in case of your playing me any trick, but I'll trust you for that," he added looking her in the face. " I have you under my thumb, my I ndy He?ton, and for your own sake you will not fail me. " Yes, you may trust me. .et me go now, please. I can bear no more to-night. Give me till to-morrow evening before dinner, sic o'clock." " Very well, six o'clock. I shall look for you, my lady-my wife. Kiss me, Minnie, and let us be friends:" She lifted her hand'and struck the face he bent towards her with all her might, leaving a stinging red mark on his false cheek, and then turned and walked away without another word. She could bear no more -her strength and courage were going, and in another moment she felt that she should have shrie?ed out her misery in wild screams to all who might be within hearing. " Will she come ?" he said to himself as he rubbed his face and looked after her. "Yes I think she will, and if she does not I can still make a living out of this business. Lord HIIolston will pay to have the manner of his disgrace kept secret; MIr. Grayson will pay to keep me from his daughter, and neither of them will have me rearrested because of the scandal: it would cause. Anyway, whichocer way it turns I shall fall on myfeet. She is more plucky than I thought her, my pretty little Minnie;: and how she is improved. She was as milk-and-water a girl as I ever came near; dropped into my mouth, as it were, without the trouble of plucking. She seems to have seen something of the world since then, and to be a woman of spirit and forethouoghbt. To-morrow at six under the old oak, my future arranged from that time and forty pouinds in my pocket nose-not so had after the taste of Frenrh prison life I have 'had lately." TTe laughed disagreeably as lie made his way o:t of the garden and towards the vill:ge- tuhroneh shichl he walked, taking the road to the nearest twvn, leaving Helston Grange wrapped in dalrkess and peace and all unconscious of the tempest that was about to break over its ancient roof, orthe agony that its young mistress was oven then enduring. Minnie was better, she said, when Weston came to undress her, and she went to bcd'with her boy by her side, after wishing every one good night. Not to sleep; she softly turned thie key in the lock of her door when she was left alone, and veiled erery cranny through which the light of her Inamp could be seen, and set about preparations for leaving her home for ever. She would tike her l ov and ':v away where no one could find her, and hille he-sell and her shame where she could harm no one by her nnlucky presence. She put all the money she had in a little purse in the bosom of her dress, and put on her cwatch and chain, and a few rings that she had had before mr'r riage with Lord Helston. A great deal of her jewellery was in London-all the most costly part of it; but there were some valuable trinltetl here, and these she put up in her bag, togelther with a change of clothes for herself, and as much as she could carry for her baby. ' She did not dar. to dress him-l-e would awakes; but she would wrap him in'n fur-lined mantle that hung in her wardroboe :nd dress him at the first hotel she came to. When she had finished her preparations, she sat edown and wrote two notes-one to her father and one t 1 or-d Ilelston. Her heart was almost brea'sing. but she was wonrerfully calms- the calmness of despair it was--the horrible stillness than can find no vent in words or weeping. 1" I. is not. dead," wore the words she adndresed to her hsehand. " I am not your wife, St ephrn. I have never been: foregive me, if you cam, for the misery I have broueht upon o on, and forget me. I shalt soon die, I think,-I ame turning to stone now, but" you will see me no more." The few lines she addres=ed to her fsther acre wildly incoherent-she could not command her thoughts any longer. HIer pen would not obey her will, and she scrawled a few broken ,enltees and sealed them up with her cheeks burniem and her eyes glittering like one in a fever. Then she wrapped hlerself in'the plainest clotting she possessed, and with her boy asueep in her arms. and a h,:rs in her hand as well, she crept doa:nstaire and out into the darkness of the night. oso shel got along she never Insew; in after time she could never tell any thing about the events of that night But she managed to reach a little wayside station where she was not recognised, and catch anl early morning train swhichboro her up to London, and out of the ken of all who knew and loved her. "VWhat is it, Mrs. Sydneyo? Is thero anything the matter ?" 't was Lord Helston who spobo. Coming suddenly upon Charlotte Sydney in the early morn ing listening at his wife's door. Heo andl r. Gray-on had accepted beds at the house ihero lther had con detained the night lofore, and had ridden osrr in the first hours of the morning, reaching IHelston Grance before eight o'clock. "I hope not, my lord," she said, st:rting up from her .stooping posture. " tut my lady was nit veryv well last night--a violent headache she said it v as, and she lookod very ill: and, knowing you were likely to be out, she insisted on having the bhahy with her. She has not rung for him to 1 fetched away, and he generally wakes long before this. I was listening for him ; but I can hear nothing." "'they are both asleep most likely," lord Helston said with an uncomfortablo sense that something was wrong, and stooping as Clmrlotto had done to listen "I do not hear a sound." "Nor I, my lord. It is very unusual. I should have gone in, but her lalyship has locked the door on the insido- and that is a thing f never know her do lefort."' " Nor I," SPtehen Voreker said, shi 'king the door and calling, " Minnie! Minnio, my dear! Are yoll awake?" Thero was no answer; all was as still as tihe grave in the room beyond the lockol door. Minnio was far out of reach of the loving voice that was ca'?ng upon her,and Lod delslon ws asserio':sly alarmed now. " I vo you tried the dressing-room door ?" he oasked. . " Yes," answered Charlotte. "I tried th it first. It is loikted, too." Actti In Lrd HielsLon called, and after a moment's waiting mnl silence, lie put his shoulder to the door and tricdto burst it open. For awhile it retstled his efforts, and then with a crash that i nought his mother and Miss Grayson out in their dressing gowns, and Mr. Grayson and the servants from doonsl'airs to seeo what was the matter, it yielded and he entered the silent and empty room.
