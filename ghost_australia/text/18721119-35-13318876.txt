My brothers, To our grand Old England stands, With weapons gleaming in her ready hands, Onteido the tumult ' Let us watch, and trust that she will never darken in the dust And drift of wild contention, but remain The hope and stay of many troubled leads, YA here so the waits the issue of the fight Aloof , but praying " God defend the right < " L'Arrivce," b) Mr, George Gordon McCrae, is also well worth quotation for its freshness and beauty L'AltlUVEE Like a pale tower of cloud) grey she stood, Est in the pale grey distance of the morn, And as I gaze d she grew, advancing swift Like some fair ship that leaves old horizons And paths o'er watery wastes to seek for new On ever on in buoyancy of youth On clad in joyous garments like the spring, With rosy blushes like the glad young day, And smiles ineffable, and eyes sun bright Forth from her neck a silver ribbon dew That shimmered faintly like a kite's long train Against the blue expense of cloudless sky, Or like the rippling cobweb line that floats, Half animate, in wavering fathoms from Some cannoned frigate a lofty royal masts. On on she glided still- felt the breeze That whispered of her as her arching foot That glinted like a sun kissed ouring wave Tossed up the snowdrift of her kirtle s them, like the swift clouds of driving feels that fly Chased from their slumbers by a dancing prove. One of the best tales in the book is that of Hanson Schloggenbochs, a legend of Prague, by Mr Harold W H Stephen. The writing is vigorous and terse and the story, which is at the same time humorous and sensational, is well told The ghost is more given to 'a rollicking " than ghosts are usually represented to be, and his interview with Schloggen- books is thus described - On a tombstone in the ancient Jewish burial ground (stated to have been in use for one thousand years) sat Huns Vcn Fchloggenboobs in his hand he held a tooth pick with which he daintily extracted the remnants of a raw herring which had lodged between his teeth He was in a meditative humour. The hearing before mentioned had made him sad It was the last of the barrel, and no knew not when he should taste its like again. He was, for a time at least, his own master, as Sol was engaged at his evening's repast. Hans thought of many things his wasted fortune-of his clamorous creditors, and he cursed the Jews Arrived at this stage, his attention was attracted by the inscription on a neighbouring tomb It set forth the virtues of a deceased Hebrew, who in his day had been the leading usurer in Prague. The tomb was quite covered with pebbles, placed there in memory of the departed Cyprins, relatives and friends of his own persuasion " Darnerwetter," said Hans bitterly, " here's a scoundrel who, living, was never contented with less than sixty per cent, and is made a little hero of when dead. It is an insult to a Christian to look at his tomb " Thus muttering, he gazed around cautiously, and satisfied that he was entirely unobserved, proceeded to brush away the pests memorials which had excited his are Suddenly be heard a short of defiance behind him, and on turning round his blood curdled at the eight which met his gaze, Robed in a long black gaberdine, and wearing the flat barrel cap-the distinctive badges of his race- stood the ghost of the gentleman whose tomb he had just desecrated a anne knew who it was at once, not being never wholly at I a loss, murmured, in somewhat trembling accents, " Now, I what's your little game ?" I " Hans Von Scbloggenbochs," began the ghost, " thou hast perpetrated a vile act Respect the ashes of the dead, and restore those pebbles to the place where they were put by the hands of the faithful " " And what if I don t ? ' asked Hans "Thou shalt have my curse," retorted the angered ghost, "Is that all old flick" said Hans, " that won't hurt much I should think." " Trifler ' Beware ' ' ' thundered the ghost. '. If I can do thee no other harm, I can at least haunt thee '" " Ah ' ' said Hans, " I dare say we shall meet on pretty well together. I'm often hard up for a mate May I ask you can you play ' Sechs und itchsztg ? This was too much for the ghost, and with a howl of baffled rage he descended into the earth, leaving behind him a strong smell of sulphur and garlic Hans was laughing over his discomfiture when he suddenly appeared again, holding in his hand a leather bottle. " Here we are again," and the ghost, gravely. " So I perceive," Bald Hans "Mayl inquire is that BohnappB you've brought with you 2 The ghost groaned at this irreverence, and proceeded to inform Hans that it was not He could not rest, he said, in his grave. He was dishonoured and an outcast amongst ghoBls, until such time as the injury done him had been repaired. Would Hans, in mercy, replace the pebbles ? A sudden thought struck Hans all of a heap He reflected that this ghost had once possessed enormous wealth What more likely than that he had concealed some portion of it. The hiding of treasure was a custom of the ago, as the Jews were always in fear of being despoiled by the authorities Hans offered to comply with the ghost s request for a reasonable sum in ready money or ewes. The ghost sighed and shook his head. " Gold audibly or have I none," said he " but take this bottle It contains a wonderful elixir, which will cure every disease under the sun, save one It will always remain full, and by a judicious use of its contents thou mayest attain to greater wealth than I ever enjoyed " Hans perceived the truth of this remark at once, and eagerÃ­) snatched the bottle, promising compliance with the ghost's request " Whilst thou retainers that bottle," said the ghost, " thou wilt be free From all diseases and disorders save one alone But remember, thou canst not refuse to use it for the benefit of any one who demands it of the thrice " " All right, old boy," says Hans, " but tell us what the one disease is I have to fear ' " I cannot," laid the ghost, " thou wilt thyself find out before long "couldst thou ever attempt the cure of this unknown disease it will at once attack thee, and all thy worldly career will soon be over. With these words he again vanished, but this time a keen observer might have discovered a malicious grin of satisfaction on his bony face. Hans did not notice it, however, and, after carefully gathering up the pebbles as he had promised, he went back to his 1 agings happy in the conscious possession of a fortune in the leather hotels " The succeeding chapters tell of the wonderful cures performed by Dr Von Schloggenbocka, and all the miseries he endured last ever) fresh disease for which he was called upon to prescribe should be the one which above all others he was to dread The story ends happily An agreement is drawn up between Schloggenbocka and the ghost, by which the former undertakes to preserve inviolate the tombs in the Hebrew cemetery, and the latter removes the spell under which he had fallen, and ensures him a perfect immunity from all diseases as long as he lives Mr Garnet Walch contributes a quaint poem, which reminds one of the writings of Bret Harte The first piece is a fragment of an unpublished review of Robert Browning's new poems, by the late Mr "W H Deniehy One of the last prose compositions is on the subject-" Men of Letters in New South Wales It consists of criticism and crudely formed opinions It states broadly that the reason genius "has never proved its presence here may be set down in half a dozen words ' Genius has never had the chance The writer assumes that " From what has been set down in this somewhat humid written paper, people hung beyond the colony may guess pretty accurately the experience of its literati, and the unenviable standing which the) hold The question will doubtless occur-who are to be held responsible for such a melancholy state of things Not the unsettled, ning community who, as hereinbefore stated, have to make their money before the) can rest and lead Not the illiterate wealth), because it is very clear that grapes are never found growl g on thistles Notices thinly not the Press , because it consists entirely of newspapers dependent upon men who discover more music in the clink of coin than in the grandest Symphony) Beethoven ever composed, and who rarely look inside a book It 13 at other doors that the fault lies and the day will come when those who are really culpable in the matter will be judged severely enough for their shortcomings I have been alluding, and I say it fearlessly-to that influential class in our midst who are lettered as well as leisured and from whom accredited colonial writers naturally expect countenance A justrecog rition on the part of these men-these scholars Unncisit) professors, judges, barristers, le , a just rtctgmttvn at d nothing more, would help the cause of Australian police letters to a degree that they themselves appear to have no conception of the facts cited do not appear to furnish sufficient evidence, and it is not very clear how lettered and leisured people are to show a just recognition in such a manner as to advance the cause of Australian police letters the authors of the "Punch Staff Papers may, however, expect that their effort to supply of volume of light reading will be rewarded by a substantial recognition, and that their work will be acceptable to the public The illustrations are most of them well drawn, and in ether respects meritorious The book is smart)) hour it and very neatly printed It contains 16 pages dear octave
