THR BOROUGH CUP. Stn,-AR? many of your readers an anxious to.know something abnhout the dirk horse, Friday, coming out for the BoroI Cup, I went down to tle training cnanl this morning to 'see him shape and lear somnething about his pedigree, &c.; He is bl Sambo, from Lucyanna, and is a great big strapping horse with grand shoulders, but dcficient in propelling power, nnd therelS too much day.light under him. He se.m' a lazy horse, and required a lot of shaking up before he extended himself, bht he heas grand long sweeping stride and might electrify some of the old ones ii he accepts, which "is doubtful, as I think the catmpaot will he a little too good for him. Perhap a Criterion Cup or an Evans Steak lro suit him better. However, whenthe accep" tances come out you will receive the pOdiree and performance of all the candidate' from NIMROD'S GHOST.
