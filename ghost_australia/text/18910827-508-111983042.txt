' . * There is probably no more £ni-9VGBting city in all Italy than Verona, where Shakspere's ' Two Gentlemen' took their -walks abroad, and Borneo and Juliet lived, loved, and died. Whether the tomb they show you is Juliet's or not, the town is that of the Capulets and the Montagues, and the air pulsates with romantic possi bilities. ? To begin with, the place is delightfully situated on a rapid river ; it is within the mighty shadows of the Alps.; it has a Roman amphitheatre, more complete and beautiful than the Colosseum at Home; it is a city of palaces, amd balconies, of frescoed houses, and narrow, picturesque streets. *?'?.? ' .? ?' Standing in the Piazza del Signori, you feel that not only is that story. of Borneo and Juliet possible, but. true. At: night, meeting there t#oor three groups pf noiffy young citizens coming home from some local festival, you may feel assured they will bite their thumbs at «aoh other. English travellers bound to Milan, on the one hand, or to Venice on the other, rarely make Verona more than a resting place for the night ; . hut it is well worth the sojourn of a week. Tour hotel is one of the fine old Scaligeri palaces. It was the Saturday market on one of the days of the. Milbankes' stay- there, and they found the courtyard, of the Palace of the Capulets full of market-parts and tethered horses ; the adjacent and sur rounding buildings evidently humble icfdgings-houBes, but even these had' bal* conies, and 'were artistic in decay. ** Murray ' says there are more balconies in Verona than in any other city of Italy. Walter was very happy in his present allu sions to modern Bomeos and Juliets, .and to those who flirted in the balconies of old. Sam was delighted at any re ference to his engagement with Dolly, who had some little difficulty up w and then in restraining what Jenny had in formed her was a too jubilant view of her position. ?'-;.*? 'The fact is, my dear,' said Polly to Jenny, t( I feel as if I had an awful escape. If I had been rescued frpm a fire or ;* shipwreck, and had got well over it-j -, or, to be more prosaic, had been very ill, in, crossing from Calais to Dover, had quite recovered and had a good dinner, I couldn't have felt more contended tfean I do now.' ' But ypu mustn't let S&m; see i^' ?« Why not?' said Dolly. He is under the impression that I gave up Philip, not Philip me, and I really don't care whether he knows the entire truth or not. I have told him I am very happy, that ef en when I seemed to hpld him at a distance J always loved: him. Tt-u know, dear,' y-j^ gave pie a lot of advice before about Philip, Don*t you think it would be juet as well to let me alone now to go my own way?'? * . ? . ? v\\.}':' *♦ Well, perhaps—,perhapg,' said Jenny. *«I own I was not very wise about the Forsyth business. But what is this? Why, this is the market-place. Walter,,^ not this the marketplace ?' .=U ?' Yes, dear,' said Walter. ' Don't you remember we saw a picture of it in the Walker Gallery at Manchester P' ' No,' said -Jenny, ' I never eaw a picture half so beautiful anywhfere,' And the present chronicler is almost inclined to agree with this admiring exclamation. ,_ Imagine the market-place at Nottingham or Yarmouth, the houses tall, some fres coed, one a palace, all -with balconies ; at tke north end- a pillar bearing aloft the marble effigy of the lion of St. Mark ; on the south a temple ; in the centre an ancient fountain with a statue pf the Virgin. Above this imagine a blue, far away sky.; and on the floor of the market numberless stalls, protected by great white umbrellas ; at the base ef St. Mark s pillar a group of Italian men and women from the country, looking exactly like a peasant chorus. Out . of a grand: opera, so much so that you expect them every now and then to burst forth 4nto song, Then imagine the market itself full of vege tables and flowers, and cattle and poultry, mostly presided over by Italian women, -with handkerchiefs about their heads, (and occasionally a mantilla) not unlike the head-dress of Manchester factory-girls ; and all round the market busy shops; whenever you get a peep out of the square down some side street you catch glimpses of the facades, ancient palaces, or narrow gabled thoroughfares. Add to all this Italian soldiers, .policemen (in tall hats', with, silver-tipped walking-sticks), jarieStfe in solemn costume^ wrinkled old men with equally wrinkled umbrellas, blue-eyed Italian girls, -and Btately housewives max keting.

In all bright, scenes, however sunny, the shadow always comes.

The ofiicers in charge--rin-new coek«d-hats and bright swordB-^were chat ting, with, the driver, a peasant, who was calmly smoking a cigarette. Beggary does not excite your 'sympathy as 'it does in London. The Italian mendicant is dirty perhaps 9 unaffectedly lazy, but he looks warm in his rags. There is a terrible reality about most of the London beggars } and the professionals, whom Mr. Kibton Turner, in his hook on vagrancy, has im mortalised, can ' assume a wretchedness ' so keen that they compel your pity. Never theless, no Verona beggar made an un availing appeal to Sam Swynford during this happy time at Verona j and, full of his romantic 'success with Doily and the realisation of his dearest hopes, the poetic city; now and then, seemed to stimulate S^rn into unexpected flashes of intel lectuality. i 'Onithe last night of their visit to Verona j the- Milbanke party 'were favored -with special permission to visit, by moonlight, the - arena wkere the Christian martyrs were driven from their prisons out among the wild heasts, to audiences of captains, senators, ladies, priests, and the populace. He would have heeia indeed insensible to goetry or liumaif-. sympathy who could have 'seen the moonbeams falling upon the marble seats and the broken arches without a pitying sigh for the past, and a grateful reflection upon the privileges of liberty and toleration in the present. Sam Swynford felt, as they wandered through the jgreat solemn place, a strong inspiration of protection towards Dolly, which she reciprocated in a more or less comfortable nestle under the wing, or to put. it without metaphor, under the strong arih of her prosperous young London fever, ????.i ~ ?'?? ; ' ? ;-' ? ' When they. were most inclined to linger over sentimental reflections about the scenes in the arena, Walter Milbanke was, busy with thoughts of Ms final sliow, which was the tomb of Juliet in the moon light. 'Not,' he eaid, as he led the way with the guide to the carriage which awaited them at the entrance to the Co losseum,' Juliet's Tomb as ordinary visitors see it, but all to ourselves with this glorious moon.' ' Driving through the pleasant streets, and saluted here and there by the music o£ evidently social evenings which gave occasional light a&d; merriment to sundry, houses en route, they presently came to a quieter part of Verona, lighted only by the great white moon. They approached the pleasant corner selected for Juliet's apocryphal tomb through an old- fashioned garden, with patches of green turf and blooming gilliflowers, rows of peas in blossom that rivalled the white Marguerite daisies in the moonlight, and a licb. per fume irom_ beans in flower, and the scent of niany herbs. It was . a mixed garden of the English, kind, that seemed uncon sciously to lend itself to the Juliet illusion of the English ??poet. Even Walter was subdued by its unostentatious beauty, and the little party followed the old lady who opened the 'garden gate upon the narrow way that led to the great stpne coffin, which, as a matter of sentiment and imagination, the world is willing to accept as a relic of the Shaksperean story, Itwafc somewhat out of keeping with the romanee bf the scene to find the great etone sarcophagus halfc-full of visiting cards, the prosaic character of which was not quite redeemed by the one or two faded wreaths that hung about the tomb. But it was all, nevertheless, very lovely and impressive in the moonlight, and with out the presence of other sightseers, and the Milbankes, with their newly-engaged companions, drove to their hotel, being generally more or less under the impres sion that they possessed a far higher and poetic appreciation of the beautiful than any of them imagined. That same sjlvery moon, however — which seemed to look down with especial approval upon Verona- — cast only fitful and furtive beam? upon a weird ghost-like figure, that appeared to a party of Venetian fishermen sailing their picturesque vessel through the water-gateway of the Adriatic into the shimmering lagoons of the City in-tlife-Sea.
