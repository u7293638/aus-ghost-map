STATS! COAL MINES. Mr. Edden, M.L.A., has again tabled his notice of motion in favour of the State having m ¡hes of its own for supplying all the coal it requires in connection with the railways, etc. When he first submitted this motion there was not the ghost of a chance of its being carried ; but socialistic doctrines have increased in popularity since then,' and I shall not be surprised if the present motion is carried in the Legislative Assembly. After all, there is nothing very dangerous in it. State socialism is already In operation in the colony on a somewhat extensive scale, and is highly beneficial. The railways,. tram- ways, post and telegraphic services are State socialistic enterprises, and lt must be . ad- mitted they are very successful. A Btike amongst the railway men is, an almost incon- ceivable contingency ¡-"tber great majority of these workers are so well oil that the idea of striking never enters .their heads. If the railways and tramways were in the hands of private capitalists, the wages would prob- ably be much lower than they are ; but mainly for that reason there ÍB an almost unanimous feeling in Sydney against their passing out of the hands of the State. The people io general are not desirous that the wages of railway and tramway men should be lowered. Therefore they would not com- plain if, supposing the State had coal mines, it paid its miners slightly higher wages than are paid by the present colliery pro- prietors. Some capitalists and others might make a fuss if it were decided that the Gov- ernment should work coal mines to supply its own requirements; but the feeling would soon die out, and the State coal mines would come to be regarded with no more apprehen- sion than the State railways. This at least .is my opinion.
