Then off bo went at racing speed, His coat-tails (lying in tho wind, Tho phantom following, doso behind. Ho heard a shout, and turned to see. When, bang lie wont against a tree. And fell with violence 10 the ground ; But up ho jumped and looked around, First, on ahead, then buck. Behind On came the spectre like the wind. Slick stood thero looking rather glum, His'Iega both shook with fear and rum. ' Keep off,' ho cried, ' what havo I done, I 'm Mickey Stubbs, tho splitter's son. Keep off old Nick, I want no strife.' 'Shut up,' cried ghosty, ' I'm your wife, All night I've boon upon yonr track, While you've been drinking cognno; I got this horso from Charley Crow, ? And rode straight oS to look for you. And when I thought I'd got you right, Away you galloped in a fright.' ' Good Saints,' cried Mick, ' is that you Kate ? Yon know tho hour is very late, And when I saw your dress so whito It rathor put mo in a fright ; But I am glad its only you. Bod luck to that vile Charloy Drew, Who lent his horse this very night 1 ' To give poor Mickey such u fright. ? ?'. . But never mind, here take a pull, Tho rum is good, the bottle's full. : You wont ! Well, there now, don't bo cross, I'll drink myself, then mount my horse, And homo together we will go. Now cheer up Kate a glass you know, ; Will never hurt a man, they say ; But I've drunk rather much to-day. I met a friend wlnse company Unthinking got me on the spree.' : '.Now that will do.' replied his wife, * I'm nearly weary of my life. Talking to you ia little use, You always have got some excuse, The way you act has made me vexed : One minute vow, anil break the next.' ' There Katie darling, that will do We need not quarrel, I and you ; And from this hour with might and main I'll try to never drink ngain.' — E. Thosias.
