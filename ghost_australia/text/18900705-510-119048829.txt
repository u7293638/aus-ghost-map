To a general adaptability to the science of medicine he added a cool ness and nerve in the use of the kinfa in surgical operations that made him the pride of tlife faculty nnd the envy of his fellow students. In 'course of time Tiernay gradua ted, receiving his ^ploma, and iu a com petitive examination which followed won an appointment as assistant surgeon at one of the smaller Dublin hospitals. He filled this pofiilion|wi(h much success, his one faplt being an^atUble'thirst for scientific in vestigation, ^hteii 'led to a' proneness to rperate upon a patient upon the slightest provocation.

He repaired to the morgue, took his seat beside th'e^orpsa) wjflch la^i«Uye-e^^yja^ sheet, and iu the dim'light' began reading a newspaper. At last the big hospital clock was heard tolling out the midnight hour. Tiernay rose ffjjm. his .chair,* and, Jarue to' ' the conditions of the wager, atood over the .?' corpse. ' I : command yon to arise.'' What was that! Really he could have, sworn' that -the body had moved. Non sense. Was he a man of science, or an old-woman with weak nerves ! Once more his voice rang out louder than before. '?' I command '? you to arise!' 5 Horror upon horrors. 'There could bfe1 no doubt of it this time. The corpse had plainly, stirred. With blanched face he tore back the'Bheet. TSro^no- ntjcould'not have been. ' I command you to wise.'- As the words rang through the narrow . apartment the corpse sprang bolt upright, the eyes dis tended, the- long black hair falling in matted streams about the ghostly face. With a convulsive movement the arms shot out, as if to .encircle 4iinv who summoned' ? ' the victim 'back to life. Two minutes later, while Tiernay's friends burst into the room, they found hiin babbling Ind'chudk . ling at the feet of the' corpse. His- reaspn was gone ; he was,, an idiot I !

His .guest* Jia,d contriied to con nect'ftjjalvanjcbat^erj with the' corpse, and had thus at the critical moment galvanized i: 4nto life. Owing to severe study, Tier nay's nerves were unstrung, and the awful results described .followed., 'A letter received at New York from the -Sandwich Islands sayet'.iat Sister Rose Gertrude ifl 42?^!?. d sappointad at not being allowed (b labour aniong, the ' lepers at Molo:-ia because.fhebc^D^ to jEk'different -ojt&ef; ofeiljers to;thoW; ii^^ charge of the hospital at that place, and because the finds matters far better there than hod ban represent -d.
