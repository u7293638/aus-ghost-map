SPRING IN LONDON. It is Sunday morning (writes Mr George Moore in the ii Vail Ga rise), and as I sit at my window partly watching the surmises stress black dots that haunt the old time which stands at the corner of King s Bench walk always the in st in he is, always the first to witness seem to be able to distinguish 111 at I we of the en in the branches I look again fine warm night had filled the old time with leaves I wish mv window, and the sweet to tempt" me forth Thom is elastic by many stop and my heart rejoices in the spectacle of the spring London can only be seen on Sunday then the streets are empty I am going to the Regent s Park and shall trace the progress of spring I remember a split, behind St Clement's Danes the quality of the ¿r en is exquisite on the small" brick wall The cab turns into "W veil street a narrow licent ous street, but the spring sky is blue and white hat and a seventeenth century "table, from which the yellow pi i tor is peeling The builder is at work in Drill > into its li tiresome squalor will soon disappear but the fine weather has drawn its population out of s issue courts and alleys Skipping ropes are whaling every where, and the children hardly escape being run over The fine weather has resolved a truce in its accustomed state, and coster girls sit wrapped in shawls, contentedly, like rabbits at the edge of a burrow the men smoke their pipes in sullen groups, their eyes on the closed doors of the public-house At the corner of the arrest theatre a vendor of cheap ices is rapidly absorbing the few spare pennies of the neighbourhood In Drury-lane there is no spring but the children. The hansom turns out of the lane into the great thoroughfare And though the day is yet early, a bright glow fills the road way behind the golden radiance a triangular block of masonry and St Giles Church show aloft, blue and delicate And in all the squares the almond trees are in bloom-that one growing in an area spreads its Japanese decoration fan like upon the wall The hedges are lighting up, and in the time worn streets of rifc^roy-iquaro the spring is more winsome than in a pastoral land scape Wherever nature can find scant root-hold a spray of gentle green gi cots the eye In the suburban retreats of St John's Wood the sun have coquette with the sun, aw showing rich colour and romantic shadow in the deciduous neighbourhood The mr is strangely sweet it has lingered in the gardens and has robbed the hyacinths of their breath It meets on the lips in fluid kisses, instilling delicate gluttony of life About the old canal the trees are bare, but the black earth is loosened somehow every grain is an idea of spring IVY hat beauty what decorative line in the curve of the daffodil when the flower is seen in profile, what starry yellow when the flower is seen full face ' Those daffodils remind me of the grace of bygone time The eighteenth century clings to this flat, dreary park and this old o mal is a stream of sad memories, of dead hopes The lake in St James 's Park is full of pleasant enjoyment-a sort of masquerade But the Regent s Park dreams and nowhere so drearily as along the banks of this old canal A river is never pathetic like a canal A river rushes or it flows strongly it is doing something, it is notion, but a canal is inaction And how evocative of life is the toiling horse, the stretching and the tightening of the long rope, the great black mass with a ripple at the prow the figure herring against the rudder in the stern If a woman sits at the door of the cabin nursing a child the impression is perfect A canal is a symbol I remember the first I saw and how I stood by the window of a railway ay carriage and watched the dead winding water, the lonely house, and the man in the prow and when my father asked me why I liked the canal hotter than the rushing whirl of the railway I could not tell him I could only say " I love the canal " Now I 1 now why a canal appeals to my sympathies, to my love of fatalism and absorbed in the poetry of the stagnant water I stand on the little badge and watch this poor canal most pathetic of all canals useless and forgotten in modern London Half-past sa in the declining light the cab rolls through the old brick streets that croTid found Golden-square- streets whose names you meet in old novels streets full o' studios where IlajQon, himself, and others of the rank historical tube used to walk and punt and drink and wonder why the world did not recognise their genius Children are scrambling round a neglected archway striving to reach a lantern of old time Those dry find d streets are beautiful in my eyes I recognise their smell as peculiar to London that smell in which there is something of the odour of the original marsh It seems to rise through the p movement like a ghost, and mingling with the smoke, produces that smell which I recognised as being indigenous to London Every turn of the cab brings some change into the vision that I know and love so well Imago succeeds image, but it is always fabulous enigmatic London the same idea in different lights and lines I look on the picture striving to understand it, but I cannot read the idea hidden in the mysterious London face-that earnest distressful look which vo c itch cool evening- on the face of London. The last rays of spr in j sunlight fa Io and London wraps herself in blue draperies the mist falls like a scarf from a pensive arm like a fold from the girdle of some make silent Oriental and London lsso be united at this moment that I dismiss my cab and stay to admire the whiteness of the arch and the fairy like vision of the long Bayswater-road its tall houses now towering like palaces in a dream and my soul is filled it with all the magnetism of the porsccctiTo and the romance of great trees fading into blue oblivion The dusk) sunset lingers low down in the west, hidden behind the trees in a far western corner and the jars, full of mist and people eTloiids grey, dim and inexpressibly mournful to the pallid lights of Kensington Gardens The crowds are formless they seem like strips of blank tape scattered here and there By the railings the tape has been wound up into a black ball and no doubt the peg on which it is wound is some democratic orator promising poor human nature deliverance from evil Strangely red are the soldiers' coats-rod waters on a sheet of dark grey paper on which someone has upset the ink But beneath the trees there is only the instinct 01 spring the branches are all swelling with leaf the sparrows are chittering and dreaming of love and stronger than over is the deep sweet scent of the hyacinths It uses solely, exciting the hands and lips of the low ers Lovers sit with their arms about each other on every sea"- Short, thick-set shop boys, dressed in ill- fitting suits of broad- cloth, a geranium in the buttonhole, an eager spring face thrust forward thick lips, thick stumpy fingers clasping the coarse hands of servant girls The girls are hardly less coarse creatures made for work, now escaped from the thraldom of the kitchen but in the soft evening air, in the hollow mg sunset and moonrise, they feel womanhood bursting upon them Outside I hear the vulgar clank of the omnibus, the bpmiMn,r single trot of the hansom, the light aristocratic roll of the brougham And Park June., with its fashion leads me out of the past, and it Gros\cnor-O'ito I stand and look again on my beloved London The eighteenth century lingers in Park lane as in St James's Park and the Regent s Park pillars and pilasters and on inspect little gardens and there a house Greek as an eighteenth century engravings Low balconies with iron railings leave our the roadway, and pendant flower baskets Being in the areas These wilful little houses were built for pleasure, and in them the in egotism of the original intention still survives Those who live in Park-lane must hold on to the old world's faith, that it w are well for man to live his little day in laughter and contempt of life So that elegant woman, dressed so " smartly " in a close-fitting- green cloth dress, nell for hanging over her shoulders, almost con- cealing the pleasant waist Park lane supper parties and divorce are written in her eyes and upon her whole manner and bearing The old beau walking swiftly lest he should catch cold, his moustache clearly dyed, his waist certainly pinched by a bolt, he too is Park-lane in GDitomc, and he represents its ideas and its pleasures And watch those two young men, talk- ing joyously admirable specimens of young Anglo-Saxons Slender feet, varnished boots, health, and abundant youth They, too, are characteristic of Park-lane How full they are of their youth, how tremulous they are with life, how beautiful their slim figures ' I turn my eyes to the west, looking for a last time upon the mottled sky-blue clouds upon a background of dusky gold and on this wild decoration dark, bare branches are drawn in astonishing detail I turn my eyes again to the east, and the last block of houses by which Pork lane dips and narrows in old-fashioned way as it enters Piccadilly, riceB like a faint blue shadow upon a lowering sky, the colour of slate Piccadilly has not yet grown vulgar, but it is modern, and out of keeping with the beauty of the Green Park, artificial as the comedy of the Restoration There is certainly an old-time me about the Green Park which would harmonise well with Pur!
