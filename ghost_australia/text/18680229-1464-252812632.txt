ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS. A.S.S. — You have no right to jump at the conclusion that our Anglican Bishop is naturally lazy because he lies longer in bed than most men. If you refer to the subject again, we shall tell him what you say. Green. — Can you graft a pumpkin on a rhododendron ? Certainly, as far as we are concerned. We never interfere in such matters. Shaksperian. — Hamlet's remark," " By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me," obviously means that he will do nothing of the sort if they won't, and as they don't, the natural sequence is that you see Ham-let aJLone with the ghost in the next scene. Louisa. — There is no law against throwing a rum bottle at an actor's head when he is looking out for his "father's spirit," but it is a thing not generally done by ladies in the dress circle. Buskin. — Shakspere did write a one act farce. It is entitled " The Mousetrap, or Marry How Tropically," and was acted before the whole Court of Denmark, at the Prince of Wales Theatre. We forget who "How" is, and how he marries tropically, but we are sure of our facts.
