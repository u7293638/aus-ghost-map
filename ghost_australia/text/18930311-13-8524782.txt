¡ PARIS UNDER A CLOUD. j -? - (1 iron As OCCASIONAL CORRESPONDENT Hotel Windsor, Rue de Rivoli, PARIS Surely the strangest spectacle for gods and men on this earth at the present moment is the military rivalry between France and German) Here we are twenty two years since the close of the war which was certainly not of Germany's seeking, but was simply a gamblers throw of Napoleon the 'Hurd, a chance of one to a hundred to maintain his d) nasty on their throne of paste board and tinsel. Napoleon has years have gone gibbering and squeaking into that limbo of the ghosts of foiled ambition, which Carlyle depicted for us with his sulphurous pen in one of the most memorable passages of the French Revolution The very name and odour of him and his seem to have evaporated from this wonderful, unaccountable city, where for nearly twenty years they were all pervading I strolled yesterday into Notre Dune, drawn thither by a strong curiosity of reminiscence It was some funereal occasion, some tele der MIOXS, I know not what, and the whole body of this church was draped with black and silver hangings, excluding all light save what came through the stained glass windows of the transept and the chancel Two veil priests were chanting a dolorous service, whilst a choir of boyish voices sang the responses from some unseen spot A. few score of people were scattered about the aisle, paying little attention to what was going on, and a bevy of noisy workmen, in blue blouses and long peaked caps, were chatting loudly among themselves as they hauled up the draperies and fixed the banners and emblems in their places, I stood apart in one of the side aisles to recall a si euc I witnessed there three and thirty years ago Notre Dame was then crammed to the doors with the beauty and elm air) and fashion of France, and before the 11th nlUr knelt the Empress Ki gent Eugenie with the little Prince Imperial by her side, assisting in the " Te Deum for the % victor) of Solferino Paris was on fete, but suspicion and terror and incredulity brooded over all 'I went) thousand troops had been marched quietly into Paris during the three preceding nights, ostensibly to make a spectacle, but really to guard against a. too probable finale, the Emperor being at the head of the army in the, and the impress rule being desperately) unpopular HIP very personages who took part in the show shook their heads, and said under their breath that it was too fine to last It lasted, with steadily diminishing splendour, for just ten years longer, and then it tumbled all to pieces 'The Communists danced their ra; magazine on its bedraggled ruins amid the glare of its flaming palaces, and to this day the city is disfigured by the blackened left nants of the wreck the) made 1 ageing is a desolate widow, lingering out her old title over the bones of her husband and her son in a foreign land Of all the numerous regime that France has undergone, that of the Second Empire hits the most completely passed away he French have had their revenge on the causes of their treat humiliation yet the seem determined to inflict upon themselves a worse evil than the Empire a worse evil even than the war itself It was always said of Napoleon that his military system was a heavier burden than any country could 1 em an interference with the civic life of a nation which was altogether out of keeping with modern ideas in all the Republic has been established for twenty one years and more It has come of age which no French lie but he did before Yet France is more milk more than it ever was under the Empire the firm has reached its highest point in numbers in armaments an 1 it is said in efficiency The country never was so crammed with soldiers as it is now It seems to exist only to keep up a bigger be of armed men than Germany and the people seem to be contented that it should 1 ans is more like a camp than a centre of industry commerce art and pleasure It you take a wall in the early morning in time of the out lying parts of the city the roads are one monotonous panorama of blue and red Foot soldiers tramping wearily through the snow and slush CuAiilrj trolling along in end less lines splashed to their helmets with mud Artillery cloaked to the ears dragging their heavy guns and waggons over the ruined stones Iroopsshovelhng snow from the quins into the river tioopspusl mc, hand carts full of rations or military clothing, troops firing over the bridges apparently for no other reason but to keep the public of the troops troops sentries sentries the army the army everywhere in the streets almost every other man you meet wears uniform and carries a sword If you go to the circus or any popular place of amusement the helmets with their long, tails of horse hair and the kepis with their scarlet and white plumes and the braided colts and epaulets of many colours and the baggy scarlet trousers and the boots and spurs and sabres make quite a theatrical display by themselves I dined a day or two ago at a favourite restaurant in the Boulevard des Italians where you get as much as you can eat and very well cooked for 4rûf un moments I went there as much for the gaiety of the scene as for the cheapness of the dinner And it was fear enough as 1 in as colour went for more than half the men in the three or four large rooms were either soldiers or military) students from Sutnt Gjr, the future officers of the French army) A waiter politely asked 1 me to charge me table in order to accommodate a large party of gentlemen who were coming I readily consented 1 only to receive the profuse use nowie Igments of eight young, fellows in gorgeous panoply) of gold lace and feathers who found the greatest difficulty in disposing of their swords within the narrow space available I went to Versailles to see De Neuville masterpiece now being exhibited in the Salle des \ Victoires It seemed to me that half-dozen regiments hiiilsentascic,eants guard to report upon it I could not get near it for the crush of soldiers 1 thou art it was the particular subject one of the most thrilling episodes in the 1 runco 1 rossi in war which attracts 1 them but I found on speaking to some of them that they knew very little about the war It was long before their time ' is not to at a startling reflection that the vast host of I Frenchmen the very flower of the nation who are now berne, trame 1 to arms to avenge Sedan either were not torn when Sedan was fought or were little more than babies ' Common sense would suggest that it is no affair of theirs But if you go to Gambetta's monument facing the 1 rose du Lurrousel-one of the most astounding things in France to an 1 englishman s mind-and read the inscriptions on it extracts from Gambetta s passionate harangues delivered during the very agony of the war when all 1 ounce was mad with grief an 1 shame you get some idea of what all this soldiers. means and why TA rib in the Second 1 and his cool headed Chancellor are risking" the Imperial crown it self in their determination to make the German and) stronger and still stronger and ever stronger than the i rench If ever historical events cast their sim lows before them there is war to the knife between France and German) 1 refuse five years are over But for the moment Paris is under a cloud which obscures even the German Army Bill and all other subjects of patriotic interest, The Panama scandal overshadows everything like a shower of volcanic mud Of course the Parisians laugh at it because there is nothing they do not laugh at But it is a very bitter laugh The Figaro this morning 8 lys wittily enough that while the universal catchword in I onion is Narara bourn de he the corresponding, one in Paris is Panama bourn de la Hage M de la Hose buying had more to do with stirring up the mess than anybody) else A very popular curvature was circulated yesterday representing the tin ditional figure of 1 a Republique in garments covered with filth whilst other figures representing all the other Governments which 1 ounce has had back to the old price Revolution monarch) also besmeared with filth congratulate her on having abun doned her mock modesty and shown herself just as corrupt as they) were! There is not another country in the world, I should say, where such a squib hornbl) degrading in its very truthfulness, would have found it responsible publisher or been tolerated by the populace Yet here it is regarded, as an excellent satire, and is eagerly) purchased and loudly) praised in all places of public resort The most respectable newspapers do not hesitate, day after day, to give up half their space to articles, reports, and mere scandalous canards, all conceived in the same strain of national defamation, while the comic prints art actualy living-and making good living,too-on the fun to be got out of the alleged bribery of the Deputies, the imbecility of the Commission of Inquiry, and the suspicion that rest on the honour of the foremost public men in 1 mnce As I was rate, under the colonnade of the Rue de Rivoli, men are passing every minute or) ing a pamphlet just issued, called Les Millions the Panama-a shameless attempt to excite public feeling against de Lesseps and the others awaiting trial with him, and the purchasers at five centimes seem as numerous as the vendors could wish in any other country, any) one publishing or selling such a paper, under the circumstances, would be committed for contempt of court in half an hour but in France, where the press laws are supposed to be very st vere and have recently) been strengthened its) stick is deemed good enough to beat an unpopular dog with I have been lately in several European countries, and have found every) where a great deal of 8)ini)ath) with de Lesseps in the crushing sorrow of his 81 years Hut here in I area the name and fame of the greatest living Frenchman art not considered worth a pinch of snuff compared with the revenge and the excitement which the prosecution seems likely to gratify) the Ministry of M Ribot is not yet a week old, and has made a good impression in the Chamber But already) time people out of ten are quite willing to believe the newspapers which openly accuse M. Ribot and his colleagues of being in league with the Panama conspirators and v violating the laws to hush up the facts of Baron de Remach's death Yet, incredible as it may seem, it is the truth that at this moment when the one certain thing about Panama is the utter and hopeless failure of the scheme, Panama bonds are being public!) raffled, or sold by loiter), in little banks brothes opened for that purpose in some of the poorest quarters Not only do the authorities allow this barefaced way nude, but the chances are being pretty brisk) taken up by ragged wretches who have been persuaded that the commission of inquiry or the prosecution of the " conspirators may in some was) given values the bonds Whilst all this is going on, and nobody cares, the anarchists, who really constitute a serious danger to every form of government in France, and who, just before the Panama scandal arose, were receiving a great deal of attention owing to their success with dynamite are having things all their own way forbidden just now to hold avowedly) political meetings, they held last night what they called a " soup) meeting '-that is a political meeting under the pretence of charity Their leaflets and posters an mounted that 5,000 basins of soup would be given away to the starving poor by the anarchist committee, and the result was one of the most extraordinary sights I ever saw The gathering took place in a huge, dismal tmpt) warehouse, under the very nose of the police, and, though the 5,000 starving poor were conspicuous by their all hence, there must have been quite two thousand men and women of the worst class in Paris The distribution of soup was little more than a sham, for, though there were several immense cauldrons of some sort of smoking brother, there were not more than 200 basins, and if these had been handed round all night they would never have reached the lower end of the hall. The committee and their assistants indeed had no easy task to get them back at all, or to prevent those who had had the first turn from talunga second and a third 'The real business of the evening, however, was not soup, but speeches And such speeches 1 1 head was practically) but one string that all the speakers charged upon-the open and unrestrained advocacy of robbery as a remedy for poverty, and of anarchy as a substitute for " the oppression of law and the tyranny of society. The meeting was perfectly orderly, for one reason because even the lowest dregs of the French have a any of behaving themselves nfore folk, and, for another, because there was no occasion for disorder, everybody being allowed to say exactly what he pleased, and the numerous evens d annes, w he stood about the doorways, showing no more signs of activity than it they had been graven images In England, America, or Australia such a scene, if it were possible, would have little or no significance, because the whole body of the people are against anarchy, and those who advocate it are looked upon us little worse than harmless lunatics Hut here in Paris it is quite another thing. The placards depicting the horrors of the explosion in the Rue des Lions Unfauts are hardly covered by those connected with the Panama scandal and, as I have said, the grim skeleton of the Treasury), destroyed. by the Communists of 1871, still frowns across the Seine No one denies that anarchy in France is a terrible reality But Paris is under a cloud at present, and no French Government nowadays professes to be able to attend to more than one thing at a time
