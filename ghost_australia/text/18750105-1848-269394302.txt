THE CORONEHSHIP. SOMEWHERE about nine or ten. ls jigo—in the moaths of March "" "oflast QelleYep'etitipa ^|Ls!c|rcumed. throughout shis dis®ict ^oV-signatib^ Hhe object of which was the appointment of .coroner for this district resident in the neighborhood of Camperdown. The petition in question was both numerously and influentially signed by residents in the counties of Hampden and Heytesbury, and it was initiated at a time when public opinion in the matter of the cororiership had been very considerably, aroused. In point of fact, the memorial to which we now refer had its origin in the township of Cobdfen, the inhabitants of which had been incensed and their ideas of decency outraged by the delay in the holding of an inquest at that place, and which delay was occasioned by the necessity of sending' for and awaiting the arrival of the only coroner in the district, and who happened then, as now, to fix his residence at Mortlake There were some features connected with that inquiry -* that at the time attracted special attention, and afforded most unmistakable evidence of the absolute necessity for the immediate appointment of a coroner for this large and important district, who should be more accessible when necessity de manded his attendance. In Camper down, the inconvenience of depending upon the services of a public official who was located some twenty-seven miles from the principal centre of population had on more than one pre vious occasion been felt to be a very serious public inconvenience and direct source of much personal annoyance and loss of time on the part of those who occasionally might have been called upon to assist the coroner in the discharge of his duties. Such being the case, the movement set foot by the people of Cobden was not only fully sympathised with by the inhabitants of Camperdown and district but met with the most cordial operation and encouragement, and the petition was accordingly signed by all who had an opportunity of doing- so In pursuance of the request ot the petitioners and, as a matter of course in furtherance of their views, the .memorial in question was forwarded to the lion..the Attorney-General some time during the month of April, and in answer to a second communication from the petitioners, a reply was during- the month of May, received from the Crown Law Offices, stating that the prayer of the petition would receive due consideration. Shortly after that the petition was forwarded to the police magistrate of this district for his opinion and report, and we have reason to understand that the g'entleman in question considered the request of the petitioners to be one that could very advantageously be complied with. Next the document found its way into the hands of the coroner resident at Mortlake, also for his consideration and report, and we have, in this particular, reason to believe that the report was an unfavorable one, and that an attempt was made on the part of the coroner to combat the arguments put forth in the petition, and to prove to the head of his department that the whole of this large district was fully and sufficiently supplied with all the requirements for the proper conduct of post mortem inquiries, and that, m point of fact, there was no necessity whatever for the appointment sought. Such, we say, we understand to have been the tenor of the information supplied by the coroner at Mortlake, who, instead of comprehending that the people ol Camperdown objected to him only as a non-resident officer;' took the whole petition as a reflection upon himself and the manner m which he had performed the duties devolving upon him. That such was the case, and that such was the information supplied to the Crown Law Office by : the gentleman m question, may be m*- ferred from the continued silence of the department with reference to the petition and the request that it, m the most, respectful manner, put forward. Prom May last, when m the most curt manner the receipt of the petition was acknowledged,. not one single word has been heard concerning that document or the intentions of the Attorney-General respecting it, and neither that 3fmister nor any of Ms subordinates have exhibited sufficient ordinary .courtesy to communicate with the petitioners and forward some answer to^ the application which, in the most proper manner, had been uiade^Jilai-ly last month, one of the petitioners^ actings on behalf of the res% applied by letter to the Department, -asking -that some sort of an answ^r inight vouchsafed, but not ghost jef a reply wjuld be drawn , O^the'isiknt oljfeiats. The ques-"' very contemptuous manner in which ] he has- treated a large number of respectable people-. Had the request made by the petitioners been-oneHhafc •would have entailed expense ^ipon the State and extra troubled the ^ " service, we can understand that it' might have been refused, though Hot why it should have been- passed over; 'without the common civility of a reply. But, as the matter stands, the proposal of the petitioners would, ?.f earned into effect, cause an actual saving m the annual expenditure of the coroner for this district, and would, at the same time prpye a great public bbon and conveniehcev 'All this has, m so many plain wo *ds, been already stated to the Minister, who, it would seem, prefers to listen to his own official, and perpetuate;, a....most undesirable stato o£ amirs, directly in opposition to the clearly expressed opinion of the public upon the subject. Under the circumstances/ we* think it would .have .been more gracefol on the part of the Mortlake coroner to'have assisted the views of the petitioners instead of opposing them, for none better than himself can'know the e actual delay and extra expense in-, curred when he is called upon to hold inquests at a great distance from his piacB of residence. If the facts put forward in the petition are not strong enough to induce the Minister to accede to its prayer, others, and those of a stronger nature must be forthcoming, and the people of this district should take action at once in order to force their complaints upon the attention of the Government.
