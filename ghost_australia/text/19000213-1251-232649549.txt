THE MEMBER FOB LYELL. (TO TOR EDITOE.) Sin,—Our member (Mr Gaffney) is lucky in having a Boswell like " Toiler," who is sagacious enough to know that to class himself with the Horny Handed is the way to win votes. Judging by the sack falls of promises Mr Gaffney left at North Lyell his transport arrangements must be equal to those of the Dutch. Amongst other things he promised a school. There were 30 children in Lyell when we returned Mr Gaffney. There are 86 now, but we bare not yet got a school. During all this time Mr Gaffney bas maintained a masterly inactivity, and not until Mr Mulcaby oame here a short time ago did we hare a ghost of a show of getting our rights. We will .now get a school without the help of our. member, although we fondly hoped be would have bad all tbe honor and credit for shaking the Education DepartmenVap and poshing things on. It pains as to Gad Mr GalTney has not been more energetic in regard to our school, and we are saddened to know that wben ont of bis sight wc are quite out of his mind. We could pardon him'if he had only dissembled bis love—" But why did be kick us down stairs."—Yours, etc., N. Lyell, Feb. 10,1900. W. E. MARTIN.
