THE SLEIGH DRIVE. SBr ERnA. " TRANSSLATgD EOR THE SYDSEY MAIL. (from- the Polish.) Christmas was at hand. A fertile east Galician.lain that .a few .months before'had presenited to the eye a sea of corn, was now covered with a mantle of snow. The villages, sur rounded by high walls of-snow, looked like winter fortifications. Here and there there might be seen a solitary mansion house, covered with bright coloured icicles. In the Kaiser Strasse, which led through the land to the east, lay the. low thatched cottages of the Kaieritz propeity. A ldii avenue led to the mansion. The high poplarabeing leafless, stood out like giant brooms against the sky, and were peopled by numerous crows; the hungry sparrows sat despondingly: bh the hedges: .The. mansion- hoseits- elf, a l;nng,highlstoried: building, was destitute of architectural beauty--it lay perfectly free from any protecting wall or surrounding hedge. Any curious passer-by had only to look I in at the window on the ground floor, I and there he would, see.in. the servants' i hall, the walls stuck over with picture, treating of sacred subjects. The servants, mostly clad in the pretty Russia-minor costume, sitting together; the coachman and valet at cards, and t the old nurse of, the, present .mistress telling the young women of Twardoski the necromancer, the Faust of Poland. t He who would be at the trouble of 1 lemblngone of the highl trees tn ffront of Kamientz.

The young mistress; sa however, was so engrossed in her book, tl that she neither heard the barking of w the dog, the crackling of the firewood yr the chirping of the cricket, nor the foot or step of the genitlemari just entering: cc He was a man so perfectly suited ti cl the beautiful woman who reclined there before him, as if he' had been made foi st her. Still, he was not handsome, nor sa had he that aristocratic bearing' that so in distinguished her; but, his appearance, like his inanner, wias of that stamp t' which constitutes realal:d true nobility. se An intellectual free mind along with cif an inflexible character.

She rose, came to forward, and put her small hand into 'II have disturbed you 1 fear,' said cit Igor ' foive me ! To redeemni my lou fault -I.will sit down in that corner yo there, and amunse myself with Nero till you have finished reading.' Nero was a laige,.black cat, that, until now, had, uiobserved by its miis- ter tress, heen lying at her feet enjoying spi the warmth of the fire, but awakened vic by Igor's friendly voice, she s retched j.r3 her limbs and purringly apiproached the visitor. su 'Mly-reading,' sidil Aldona ; ' I have arc not been really reding.'

But Aldona would not listen further to the 0 old man. She waved her long whip over the heads ,f her Itlack horses, and the' handsome wild pair rushed on with li her. Thai was an extraordinary drive through what seemed a boundless oceau and at the same time depressingly sh moiotonous plain of snow; the white be sleigh,. ornamented by a swan's head, in the' fiery black horses, and the beautiful' a proud .womanenvelopedinfurs, befitting a pripeess, As she flew over thebrook; whose mnurmur had long since been vs silenced bya covering of ice,the willows ut came in sight, their anow-severed id branches hung down like white arms, p- and looked -to .Aldona .like so many re ghosts"wrapped i? :their shrouds, :who e in long' procession, swept through the ce winter nightmotioning and threatening au'her; but she turned away lier 'head, r: and iracked her' whipf to' dispel' the a_ illusion: ,y The horses snorted, their'littler bells. ,r. tinkled louder than usual,- and the sleigh ad groaned on its way. Now they pass a e- villago lwhose 0oofs the snow threitens e- to bury;the o'smoke clouds ascend, and . in the clear moonlightseemned changed , inito silvery air; now and then the bark of a dog'mightbe heard, 0r the peasant's n slow 'monotonous hymn,' at evcning worship ;;little nervous lights, flickel:ed " in' thei windows, and the heavy icicles, a with their diamond-like glitter, hung t- from the smoky beams - like costly ornaments constructed by the hand of man. Again, deep. solitude, :the silence of d the night and of buried nature. The sleigh hilint its: restless burden '. past a tavern hialf biuried'.in the snow; the violins. sounded joyous,'the bass .fiddle did its part heavily; as if to tone down tlheo exuberance of the first, the cymbal wapt.: The bacchanalian sound seemed to invite Aldona to love, joy, pleaisure. Long after she had turned her back on them these sounds haunted her like the goblin voices: now like children crying;, now like the jeeringlauglsof coidemned souls: SAlready the forest stbod on the right a group of old oaks seemed place.dthere r knocking, the snow from tli branches wd with their-black wings.' â¢ They turned, r and dii iajiareed ias'uddenlyas they liid come. SAlidona never thought of turning home; she drove straight on without a purpose, urging on the horses without the least necesaity for doing so. She grew too warm with this mad chase, openid out her furs,' and found the cold t sharp aii a real; benefit. All at once her horses stood still .and shook with terror. On both sides appeared l buinrning lights, fire-like eyes, and then a werll known howl. struck Aldona's t ear. t It was wolves. The bold,fearless U wominn never:.i for a . moment._ost.. hr courage she lashed on the horses and. the sleigh sped along swift as an arrow. But not for long. From the long madl race,anid the erroi theywere inder, b the poor half lamed 'hormes" could not proceedt: so fist, and the .;wolves en- o countging each other by 'an occasional k howl, came nearer and nearer. :' Aldona, saw the whole pack advariciiig- felt for' a :moment at a loss to know what to .do h, and remembering how others'had acted when in a similar position," she' seized the cushions on which she:was :sitting, and threw them one after the othert out a, ofthle sleigh, then the rug which had been covering her feet, and lashed' on as the horses with all her mright: As each T of these was thrown out the wolves b' stopped, threw themselves on the object, smelt it,' aid tore it to atoms thus giv ing Aldona a temliorarv advaintaige. Now' with coaxing to?'es, now -with violent blows she urged on the steaming horses, so:that for a'miuute the raven ous monsters were lost to. :sight: only too soon, did she hear their aiwful 'lhowl -saw again their glaring eyes. 'withi out furthei- reflection she took> off her costly cloak and threw it to " hlcr grim followers. Once ;aniore' the '. olvries ' stpped,-and again:Aladouia succeededi', speed. The beitiztiful heiress now stood upright iinthe sleigh, the reins Ain oiie hand, her'whip in the other; She was deadly pale, but fiim as a irock. " The horses were ailways' getting more' ex hausted. She looked back, anid sav the wolves rushing on as if to make up for lost time.. Throwing down her whip; she drew her pistol from the girdle of her velvet dress and itnied it the first of the pack. He. w.as just going to make a spring. There was a. shot and the inonstrous wolf lay weltering in his blood. STlieothe rs, iiie ravenous by hunger,. rushed:upon him and tore him in pieces. In her extremitn;y Aldona suiddenily saw in the disttilnce it wooden lbiihilihg" used iw as a shepde,!d' a hut, in summ'er; sihe? directed .her dispairing horses to this,. but anew the wolves threatened to foil' her.': A a list resobirce' she shot' the weaker `of th'etwo horses; 'id cut the traces aith thedagger sheialwiays ecariaried about .with- her?? !

"There she is, do you see hler 1" cried a well known voice..Torches came nearer, then nzen's voices were learld. She recognised her servants as they raised the ladulder. Fast very fast 'did slahiecome down, and was rejoiced over by her people. As she was on the last step, Igor stoud before her; hie covered hdr hand with kisses. Not long after hbiving left. Aldona hie had turned back to the mansion house, and was horrified when told by the servants of Aldona's adventurous drive. He had ordered her servants to follow him on horseback immediately. To him the proud beauty owed her salv:tion ; she knew it at the mbment, she asked him no questions, her heart was to full to speak. .She silently threw her arms round his neck, and leant her head against his breast. At-last she found words. "Now, I know the value of life, Igor," she stammered, " At your sile I will begin a new life, you dear, good, forgiv ing nmai. Here is iiy hand, lead me and I will follow yoa." Aldona has kept her word. She fol lows the man who teaches her the true value of life in caring and working for others.
