I POKTItY. I j YESTEttDAY. Yesterday Is dead, And lies al rest. No breathing stirs The Tfhlte-robed breast ( The groans and sobbing Are hushed at lost. Thanks be to Heaven ! Bush pains are past. Seek not to rouse Its unquiet ghost ; Conjure no phantom Of what is loBt ; Come away softly. And make no moan. Leaving thy perished hope Dead and alone.
