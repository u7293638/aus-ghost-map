THE BALLARAT “GHOSTS."- A DENIAL. TO THE EDITOR. SIR,—A most absurd report having got about that one of my sons had been personating the ghost, allow me through the medium of your paper to give it a most emphatic denial.— Yours, &c.;, DAVID THOMAS. 37 Lyons street south, Ballarat. The friends of a young lady residing in Soldiers’ Hill, whose name has been freely used in rumors concerning the "ghost" there, desire us to state that during part of the time when the “ghost" was walking there she was absent from Ballarat, and that she is in no way connected with the senseless and cruel trick.
