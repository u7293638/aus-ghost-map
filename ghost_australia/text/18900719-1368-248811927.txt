OLD SONGS. Over and over again, In every time and tongae, In every style and strain Have the world's old songs been sung: Since the sigh from the soul was stirred, Since the heart of a man was broken, Have the notes of despair been heard And the rhythm of pain been spoken. Tho song that you sing to-day, Sweet on the printed pages, Was sung in the far away. In the yonth of the worn-oat ages; The charm of your love-born tune. The gems that your lines uncover, Were set in some savage rune By the heart of some pagan lover. The fancies that fill yotir rhymes, The visions that haunt your lays, Are the spectres of olden times \- And tbe ghosts of forgotten days; Yeplayera on notes of woe, Ye dreamers of love and sorrow, They aang in the yean ago The songs you will sing to-morrow. But what i* the rhymes are new, And what if the thoughts are old, If the touch of the chord be true And the flight of the singer bold; Let them come to us still again, To-morrow and yet hereafter, Fresh as a morning's rain, Old as the seb and the laughter. 1ST BAKU Bros.'
