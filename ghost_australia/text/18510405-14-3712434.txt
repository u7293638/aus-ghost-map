The Magistrates at Brentwood have held a second investigation into a charge! of 'felony preferred by a servant girl, aged fifteen against the "Rev; R. A. Johnstone, who is rector of a parish adjoins ing the town. The preliminary depositions of the girl and her mother would leave no doubt of the rev. gentleman's guilt, but they were not forthcoming on his appeal ance before the magistrate. It was stated that the family, who are very poor, had left for London, and the police had "I been fruitlessly searching iWtliem. The rev gentleman was held to bail'; himself in £500, and two sureties of £230 each', to appear again before the magistrates. Magnet, Nov. 19.
