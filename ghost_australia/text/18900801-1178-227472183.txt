MYSTERIOUS DEATH. At the South Sydney Morgue yesterday an inquest was initiated on the body of the man who on Tuesday last was discovered lying in an unconscious condition on the La Porouse-road. The testimony of Dr. Mil- ford, who made a post-mortem examination, disclosed that death was due to syncope, but in order to ascertain the primary cause of death it was decided to submit the contents of the stomach to the Government Analyse for chemical analysis. The inquiry was, therefore, postponed for a week. A child named Jamcs Griffiths, 2 years of ago, was found dead in its bed at the Bene volent Asylum yesterday morning. A surprise party was given to Mr. Fletcher Watson at his residence, Hillside, Watson's Bay on Wednesday evening, by a party of friends. After refreshments had been partaken of general harmony was indulged in, the principal vocalists being Miss Eisie Watson, who sang "This is my dream"; Mr. Cork, "Way down by tbe Swanee River" ; Mr. James Sibley, "Sister Mary"; Mr. Holdsworths, " Free Lance.'' Master Oliver Watson delighted the com pany with " The ghost of Benjamin Binns." A very pleasant evening was spent; the party dispersing at midnight.
