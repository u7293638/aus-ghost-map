Dowlin'g, and brother of the late Henry Dowling, who died recently in Launceston, was born in England on July 4, 1827, came to Tasmania at an early age, and with his parents settled in Launceston. He re mained here for many years, and early developed a taste for painting. This he cultivated, and finally went to England to study that art, and since then he acquired considerable celebrity. Amongst his best known pictures are the group of aboriginals of Tasmania now in tho Lannceston Mechanics' Institute, whore also are his admirable pictures of Queen Victoria and his Eoyal Highness the late Prince Albert, Prince and Princess of Wales, and Duke of Edinburgh. ' His other most noticeable paintings aro ' Breakfasting Out,' a very fine picture ; 'The Baptism,' 'ThePil: griius' return to Cairo,' and many other excellent paintings were the work of his fertile brush.' In addition to the above mentioned 'works of art, when Mr.Dnwlirig recently ; came 'to ' Tasmania 'frouv England he exhibited in. the Launceston1 Tow^i Hall two splendid paintings of the Eight Horii W.'E.

The Late Abchbishop Goold. — The Melbourno Herald states that Dr. Goold, tho late Eoman Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, made a will some time ago' appointing the Vicar - General, Dr. Fitzpatrick, his private secre tary, Dr. Corbett, and Archpriest A. O'Meiira, as his executors. The reverend gentlemen are now engaged in going through tho deceased's papers, aud without betraying confidence it may be mentioned that 'they have already come across numerous ? evidences of his Grace's liberality. For instance, some timo ago the nuns of che Presentation Convent, at Windsor, received a sum of ^Bl-XOO, but never knew who was the donor, and it was only this week that it was discovered that the money came from Dr. Goold. For years past Dr. Goold made donations in the same secret manner, besides presenting cheques towards new churches, sohools.otc.i in the most unpretentious manner. When ever his Graco had a sum of money by him, without any particularly urgent call upon him, he would hand it over to. the Cathedral building fund. The will of the late Archbishop has been awaited with some interest, as before it became known that ho. was a member of the1 order of ' St; Augustine, it was anticipated that it would bp found ho had distributed his property before death...1 ' Tlie property is not expected to, realise ..more than J310;000;i and'the furniture, : h'orses; carriages,'etc'.i are ^'be queathed ' to 'the' - Archbishop's ] 'successor, but'the 'geherar'impressiori ''seems ifo ' have ?yri'iiJ* j Ji.f'iii ...!.'. .-iIiliMj^-H, ?.??in, il-.ijj.yoj I ,bcon-that itho late -Archbishop Goold was a jvery wealthy man.

'Brutal' Murder in Zultjland. — ;Tho Natal Witness 'publishes particulars of a briital murder and execution in Zululaud. A native was suspected of witchcraft by his chief, an idea which was supported by tho native's first wife, who was jealous because the man had just re-married.

Charge op Defrauding the E.ulwat. — At tho Launceston Police Court, Tues day morning, before Mr. G. A. Kemp, Acting Poliue Magistrate, and Mr. H. Weedon, J.V., two cases connected with the Government Enilway Department wero heard. In tho first case, tho defendant, Henry Devlin, was charged with having, on June 25, wilfully paid for travelling in a railway carriage ? from Launceston to St. Loonards and neglecting to leave the train at that station. In tho second place he was charged : with having paid his faro from Launceston to St. Leonards and wil fully iprocoeded on to Forinby without first having. paid- tho . additional faro. Mr. G. T. Collins appeared, for tho prosecution, and- Mr. K. Byron, Miller for tho defence. !. in: From; :tho! evidence of Leonard i . J. ?. Dowling, ' Daniel Hart nett,. Samuel J. ' Padinan,. and Ephraitn Ford, it appeared that on the day named in the: information defendant was a passen ger . by ? the;; 8 .a;m. train on the Western line; and hen purchased, a second class tickebi to .St. Leonards, proceeding to Forinby without .paying anything addi tional.; On .alighting from the twin at Formbyy defendant: handed his ticket to tho guard; ;:faco. downwards,, when the fraud .was discovered. The ticket col loctor told him to see tho station master and settle , tho ; matter,- bub defendant only walked up to tho office, and throw tho ticket in. the window, alleging that ho hod ''paid 11s 4d at the Launcestou station, and then he walked oil. For the defenco Mr. Miller contended that a mistake had been made by tho booking clerk, and the defendant had put down 11s 4d for a Forinby ticket, and thu clerk in the hurry had mado a mistake, and given him a ticket for St. Leonards, instead of for Forinby. Tho Bench said thorn was no reason whatever to doubt tho evidence for the prosoction, it being so very distinct. Had defendant paid lls 'Mat tho Launces. ton station, the mistake would have been found '? out when the booking clerk was making up his cash, but such was not the case. They considered defendant Kiiilty, and fined him IO3 and costs. Mr. Collins applied for professional costs, which woro allowed, whiln an application for witnesses' expenses was refused. The second chavgo was withdrawn, on tho understanding that Mr. Collins was paid £1 Is in that ease for professional attendance.

'.. , , Pbince Albert 'Victob's Futube Title. —According to Londpn papers, the time is approaching when Prince Alberi 'Victor, of Wales is to be made a peer,, anj- the ques: tion of selecting a : title for him is being discussed in several quarters; It has been suggested inter alia that H.E.H. the Duke of Australia, H.E.H. the Duke of Canada, H.E.H. the Duke of Ontario, or H.E.H. the Duke of Bengal -would sound remark ably well j or they might be combined as H.E.H. the Duke of Australia and Ontario, or H.E.H. the Duke of Canada and Bengal, as York, and Albany formerly were and Connaught and Strathearn still are. The St. James's Budget gives prominence to the following suggestion on the subject from a correspondent : — 'Viscount Melbourne was the earliest of her Majesty's Ministers ; Melbourne, in Victoria, is the greatest of British colonial cities. What more appro priate and graceful title is there for Prince Albert Victor than Duke of Melbourne? It might very suitably be. conferred upon him, before the close of the present Exhi bition at South Kensington.' We fear this last suggestion, if acted upon, would only provoke jealousy. ... .,;,.,. . . . Entrapping Publicans.— The disguise which two constables named W.est and Neal assutnedajew Sundays ago at^i.Uiamstqwn to catch unwary publicans must (observes the florald), according to tho evidence given at the Melbourne Licensing Court, have' been very comical. Tho men dressed up as fishermen and carried a basket and) rod. One was minus a vest, had a billy cock hat, Bhort trousers and a coat that a' Ghinauian would have refused ; to pick up for old rags, while the other was not much more of a ' masher.' One witness,1 who refused to give his name when the constables asked for it, said he thought the couple were larrikins trying to got a 'cheap booze.' The constables, notwith standing their got upi were very unsuccess ful in' getting convictions1 against 'the publicans of Williamstownj ??,'?' i! AlTEBATIONS/IN ?'.

The news' is im portant, for on the 25th ult./. we pub lished, it will be remembered, two Eeuter's telegrams ' containing an. account of the wholesale massacre of the, party, consisting of four Italian officers and four Italians of a lower grade, by the Emir of Harrar. It is strange that Eeuter's agent should mt also have telegraphed the fact of 'their safety. A slip of that kind in7 variably leads to a great deal of imagina tive display, and one of the Indian papers actually gave a detailed account of the massacre. But in spite of this interesting narrative the whole party are alive, though close prisoners in Harrar, a little state in the Somali country, some hundred miles from the coast, chiefly noted for the fact that two-thirds of the population are females. Their rescue' from this unpleasant position should not be difficult. It is believed that the presence amongst them of one Effehdi made the Emir suspicious, and led to their incarceration. Effendi was -the officer placed by us in command of the troops raised for the Emir. He was flogged be cause his men refused to fight against the Gallas, and bolted to Zaila, on i the Somali coast, where he joined the ? Italian : party which ' started on the 27th March. The Emir thought he was coming to take his revenge. Hence his mistake.' ? : Geeves Town. — We understand that theEev. E. W.

Police-constable 45 M stated that he saw the dog wander ing at large without a muzzle in Barford strect, Berinondaey, and found that ho be longed to tho defendant, who had no license :f or the animal. — In answer to the, magistrate, the defendant, who burst out' crying, said : I've had this little , dog 18 years, and have paid the license for it as long as I could.1 -I have lately had' an attocklof ' paralysis/ and have riot earned any money, so I have not been! abld to' pay for; the license. — Mr. Sheil: Why don't you, part with the dpg? — Defendant': I don't like to part with it after having it so. long. The little dog does nobody: any harm. — Mr. Sheil:— You can't- be' allowed1 to keep a dog without lpaying the1 duty,1 however long you may have had' it.; 'You; are fined 7s 6d, or seven days.— The! old man was locked up in default/'; We' are not told what became of the dog; likely] enough it was destroyed, with probably a similar result to the old man.,. Seven days' imprisonment for' being too poor; to pay the license fee for a dog implies' that after all their amendment and amelioration British laws have1 not yet' lost their' Draconic character. ' ? ' ?:,'[' '. Poor Doa Tra. .— ^That human sympathy, and. confidence are long . ,-suffering; is abundantly proved by the fact that, in spite of- ever recurring' imposture,.' any apparently 'hard case' reported' in a Lon don paper is sure (says the Scottish News) toevoke from all parts of tho country such a. shower of cheques, post-office orders, and postage stamps' as frequently to necessitate judicious magisterial interference. The latest case of the kind is that of an old man who was sent to prison the other day in de fault of paying a fine for keeping a dog with out a license (the facts of which appeared in a recent issue). In his defence the culprit stated that he had had the animal —which! ;he. originally rescued from starva tion— iri. his possession for a number. of years;, arid that - he had regularly paid for the license till illness ! and want of: work rendered - him . incapable of doing so. any longer.1 No' sooner was the case reported thari letters; from''far and near began to pour iri, arid in the eourBe of one day ??up- wards of ;30 ladies arid. gentlemen attended the,' Court , with the object of. paying, the fine, X76 in all being tendered.. Ambrigi those kind- hearted applicarits were several persons, of ;i title, one of* whom, took -the trouble-' !of- himself i- restoring1 'poor, dog -Tray'-' to his owner after, paying; for, th'e. license for tho .ensuing' year. -'? It' argues, no, maudlin sentimentality to note ; \Tith pleasure the occurrence of such 'an iricidentjin a some what, cynical age..
