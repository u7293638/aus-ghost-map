Photographing the Unseen. Don't be so matter-of-fact, writes a correspon dent. You give us a delightful Halesowen photographic ghoBt story, and then you destroy the romance of it all by telling us that, after all, the whole thing is but " the result of unaocount able reflections produced upon photographing glnBS?" Rubbish! One of our best known London photographers the other day showed me a photograph which had been taken a few weeks previously, which represented an elderly gentle man, minus bis legs, poor dear, seated in his own arm-chair, in his own house iu his own country. Now, there is nothing extraordinary in this you will say. Wait a moment. The photographer went to the house during the absence of the family and took a photograph of the empty study. When the photograph wbb developed to, his astonishment there sat the master of the house in. the arm chair as I have described, but minus his legs. Two days after there came a letter to say that the old gentlemau had died that very hour in a far-off watering-place of dropsy in the legs, I think it was. I well re member Mr. Stead telling me of someone— it may have been be himself — photographing iu an ancient church, and when the plate was devel oped there distinctly was the figure of a medi aeval monk hooded and cowled.
