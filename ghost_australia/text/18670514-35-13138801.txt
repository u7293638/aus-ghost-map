" I have been content to sit under the tree, must um burnt red by the sun, far I have been there all the afternoon, now surely you will let me speak, and then I will go again to mv seat " A blind woman thus laid At hat a mere) that the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ saves an old blind woman like me, into my eyes are blind, to the eyes of Hi) soul are clear, clear as they can be, lean see the Saviour here, and everlasting life above" An old brother, full of fire, said, " As to my spiritual life I have no doubt about it, I know in whom I have believed, and Christ said, and I feel it true, ' None shall pluck you out of my father's hands ' My life is all right, as it has been for a long time Glory be to God it is there" pointing upwards-" it is there, It's all safe, hid with Christ in the oil " Your missionary adds that for half an hour he stood, hymn book in hand, waiting to close the meeting Of this people li Is just to say that they love not in word only, but in deed and in truth, for, In addition to upwards of £2000 worth of cocoanut oil, they sent In cash subscriptions for 1866 upwards of £300 BAMOV DISTRICT From the reports of your missionaries labouring in this district we gather that the spiritual work of God is in a low and unsatisfactory state Many who name the name of Christ are resting in the form of godliness without its power The piety and intelligence of many of those employed as leaders is but that of " babes in Christ " Political and their quarrels contribute largely to this lamentable state of things Old offences are remembered, and they do not forgive one another, hence there is among them envying, and strife, and divisions In a few places there are indications of improvement, and the labourers are not left without tokens of the Master a presence and favour Con versions have taken place during the year, and some have passed through death triumphant home Of an old teacher named Daniel, Mr Brown writes to his relations who travelled a distance of sixty miles that they might remove him when near his end, to die in his native e v stage, in accordance with their custom, he said, "If you have an) loreto me let me die at my) post, I will make an end of mv appointment [finish my) work), here at Neiafu " He often expressed his perfect peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and said, "it is good to die" To his children his dying charge was If you love me follow me, and meet me above keep fast hold of the word of God," and so pitted away old Tanks to meet his friend Slvasi, whose death we noticed last year Mr and Mrs Osborne are on the eve of sailing for Samoa, and expect to occupy the Monono station, for which h missionary his long been promised ruin DISTRICT.

H. H. Gaud (President of the Conference) said he could not command the powers of utterance he would like to employ in advocating such a case as the one now brought before them. He was pleased, however, to have the opportunity of saying something, however feeble, in its behalf. A greater or more glorious cause could not engage their attention, enlist the sympathies, or call forth their aid.

It was a work which reflected honouruDon the highest of human beings, and thrown splendour around talents the most brilliant and valuable, The directors and agents of this missioner) ponies) aimed at (ho accomplish most of this end by the simple preaching of the Gospel in accordance with the direction of thoSovnur that they should go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature Other means had been tried.

U bo yer) failure of those schemes was enough to force upon them the conviction that the Gospel and the Gospel only well adapted to ameliorate the condition of man , to meet his necessities, and to accomplish the end Iho) nil desired. They) did not depend upon more theory It was not fifty years since the first missionaries went to the Friendly) Isles The people of these islands were then physically and morally) degraded Their wars more frequent. Their cannibalism was revolting Their idolatry seemed to blast them. Idolatr) did blast them while they lived, and damned them when they died for it w viz written that no idolaters should enter the kingdom of God, They appeared to exemplify the truth of Holy!)

Many thousands had Ik on convicted, and many thousands had entered heaven, the incipient civilisation in these islands was the result of missionary enterprise And what had been accomplished showed clearly that the same instrumentality) must be brought to bear upon the world to effect the great object they had In view the salvation of the human race He regretted much that commercial depression had prevented them from raising during the past twelve months the sum they had been wont to raise towards this society, and he hoped they would not have a similar deficiency at the end of the present 5 oar. A falling off was to be specially regretted at this time when men were losing faith in their sjBlomB, and there was so much pro mlEO of Success He hoped the missionary) spirit would be inflamed, that they would all possess missionary real and do their part in the great work, so that when they stood before the Judge the) might be welcomed with the words "well and faithfully done ' He had much pleasure in moving the first resolution, "That the report now read be approved and adopted.

He was struck with the changes which had taken place since that time, especially by) the removal of cover! and honoured men, and the number of young men Prov dance had raised up to follow in their steps. While death had inflicted a heavy blow upon the Australasian connection, affliction and death had also invaded their mission ranks. There were but two brethren now stationed on the Friendly Isles whom they found in that district in 1861. Not only had allliotion fallen heavily upon Huropoon agents of the mission, but also upon several of the most esteemed evan- gelist among the native agents Three well known, to the older missionaries, were removed in less than to solve months But though cost down they were not in despair The Tonga mission was one of the most successful and least expensive in connection with the Australasian Wesleyan Missionary Society Some of their friends had an impression that missionaries got rich He would, therefore, tell them the remuneration they) received In order at once to remove such an idea A missionary got £140 a year for himself and his wife Nativ 0 assistant missionaries got £15 per annum. The time was at hand, however, when an advance must be made to those worthy labourers. They were the best men in the Friendly) Islands Some of them were of considerable rank and talent, and the Government would like to employ them. The native teachers got free the, society £10 per annum catechists To, and day teachers and schoolmasters sixteen shillings. He referred particularly to the Friendly Islands front which he and his reverend brother, Mr. Baker, came. There was a time when no mission in connexion with the society was so popular as that to the Friendly Isles, and he was at a loss to understand how it had retrograded in the affections and liberality of many of their friends. In connection with the Friendly Isles they had ISO chapels built free of expense to the society. When the) opened them there was not a farthing of debt attaching to them. It was the same with their school houses and vestries, Not only had the Friendly Islands district raised a large amount in 01!, but it had given much labour. Nearly half the chapels in that district had been renewed within the last few years The Tongs mission was the parent of the Wesleyan missions in Polynesia, and a most wonderful work had been accomplished, to use the language of a capture, "A nation had been born in a day " lungs had become their nursing fathers, and queens their nursing mothers, Like Paul at Athens, the first missionaries looked upon a people given to idolatry) , but they had now t cast their idols to the moles and to the bats and it would be scarcely possible to pick up in the Friendly) Islands such a curiosity) as on old gold the heathen fortresses had been levelled, and excellent roads had been made. This was especially the case at Tonga The A avan Group had not been so thoroughly centred in this respect as the other groups King George had a carriage and two horses. He had also a dra). (Laughter ) The Governor of Apia had also a small carriage. The G governor of Vavau had a buggy. There was also another buggy and a dogcart on the island, and several draw s There had been recently an importation of cotton gins, and a w indmill. Ho mo- tioned those Small incidents to show how civilisation was progressing in the sister dominions of King George (Cheers) Pt are now prevailed throughout the islands it was refreshing to witness in this respect the change which had taken place. Several celebrated rebel warriors were now the first and foremost friends of King George, their conqueror, and the Tonga Islands had been the scene of some of the most blessed revivals ever witnessed by the Christian Church from 1859 to look was a tr) ing period The question of liberty occupied much of the time of King George, the leading chiefs, and the natives generally The object was to free the natives from certain tolls imposed upon them It had entered into the mind of the King to form a Parliament. Its meetings were held every year, and there was in connection with them much dissipation. The demoralisation was terrific. Pigs, game, and kangaroos were consumed in large quantities, as well as gin, rum, brandy), and champagne, to defray the cost of which the natives had to make oil when the meetings were over. The liquor trade was established and patronised by the Government Liquor was sold at the Government stores, and drain (hopes were also opened to the natives, The Church during that time was in 11 storm The waves ran high, and the barque pitched terribly, but still they had confidence, knowing that their Master was at the helm. God visited the Southern islands and sent a gracious answer to their prayers A few months afterwards the! 0 was also a revival in the Northern group. Queen Charlotte was converted, and possessed in a remarkable degree the gift of prayer. King George also became concerned for his soul, and sought the advice and instruction of the missionaries. He attended a glorious revival meeting, the chiefs and people being with him and when he was about to heavenly little schooner the Vavau said they must make him a present. When their hearts were touched with the grace of God they were full of love the) brought pigs, figs, kava, etc as a love token, King George also visited the Haapai Group to prepare for another meeting, and there was a great improvement visible in this class of assemblages from that time. On his return he set his heart upon at once in I airing the chapel, Mr. Baker acting as his chief painter, in connection with the Parliament then about to assemble he might state that a law was made greatly to the interest of our missions, to the effect that the chapels and mission houses should be made over to the Australian Wesleyan Connection on a lease of ninety-nine years There was co buying land in Tonga, and it had been impossible to obtain a lease until within the last few years. The chiefs were not willing that the mission property should be made over to the connection, but the ruling mind of the king prevailed, and a few leases were ofl\\)Ctod. This would prove a very great boon. And the result experienced from the good work was, that an educational grant was made of 100 dollars, or £10, to each group, in order to assist the schoolmasters, who recovery badly paid, receiving only 100 a year from the society, and a few months) contributions in produce from the pupils, such as fowls, yams, pigs, At The king or government thought it would help the cause of education. if the) made this grant, and as education and commercial interests advanced they would mere Is it. Another result was the extensive circulation of the co photo Biolo at that time, the number of appertains for them day after day when they arrived, was really astonishing. Another result of the good work commenced in late years was that they had established in various parts of their district circuit lEMilutions, from which were drafted their superior men to a district institution in order that those called for the ministry might be trained. The district institution was to be constituted a college, not confined to those destined for the ministry) (though that was the main object) but also intended to provide a good secular education for others who might avail themselves of it. The course embraced secular, religious, and theological studies, and some had already begun Euclid. They had not less than eighteen men in course of training in connection with the circuit and district institutions, and they were thankful to the general committee and friends In Sydney) for the sacrifice they made for sending their esteemed and most indefatigable brother Moulton to the Island Another result was the intense interest taken in their annual missionary meetings, which were anniversaries of great good.

The resolution assumed that Jesus Christ died for our sakes too for our justification, and sitting at the right hand of God had all power in heaven and earth. The Apostles endeavoured to obey his injunction to preach the Gospel to every creature, and the Saviour according to his promise was with them and gave effect to Iholrefforts The Church had had her season of declensions, feebleness, and prostration, but had never been entirely unmindful of the command of our Lord About 130 years ago God favoured our father- land with a remarkable revival of pure, practice religion he apostles Whitfield, Wesley, and others went through the land like living flames proclaiming the truth as it was Jesus Christ, and raising men to a saving knowledge of God. This produced a most extensive change in the manners and morals of the people Most of the British Churches, to a greater or less extent, felt the influence of that revival, and darted into renewed and more vigorous life i tom that period The various Protestant Churches had carried the Gospel to many nations and peoples, who before were sitting in darkness and in the region and shadow of death Missionary Societies had done great good in the translation and circulation of the Holy Scriptures, in the creation of a Christian literature among heathen people, in the education of their children in the principles of Divine truth, andinthocivilitation, spiritual illumination, and moral elevation of hundreds of thousands of barbarous and savage men The Methodist Church carried its doctrinal teachings to the United States of America, and there had one of the most numerous and flourishing evangelical churches in the world (Cheers) Her various branches contained more than 1000,000 church members, and at this moment that church was carrying the Gospel to Palestine, Turkey, China, Armenia, and India British Methodism had successfully proclaimed the Gospel in Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick, Nova colin, The Vi West Indian Islands, Southern and Western Africa, Ceylon, Continental India, the vast empire of China, and some of the most fruitful and flourishing Christian missions had been committed to our special care in the Island of the Pacific Ocean (Cheers J In this view of the case we had great reason to thank God and take courage It was said that much remained to be done, but we were encouraged by the gracious promise of the Saviour, ' Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world " Whatever remained to be accomplished in this matter would, be was convinced, be ultimately realised, and he confidently asserted that that part of this great work which God, in the order of His Providence, might commit to us we would try to perform We would never relax our efforts, by the help of God until the nations of this world should acknowledge God and his Christ in the resolution certain difficulties were contemplated, but whatever obstacles were in the way of the final triumph of the Redeemer would all be removed, for the Lord had spoken it That Christ should have the "heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession " In heaven there was no difficulty, there the grand scheme of human redemption was devised and the mission principle had Gods approbation The Father had proclaimed in accents of everlasting love and mercy that he had no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that he should return and live, and then the second person in the ever blessed Trinity, Ho who laid down His life for us exclaimed on Calvary, " It is finished , the world is redeemed , my Father is reconciled to man We ought then to know that Heaven was engaged with us in this noble work Thcrowasno difficulty for us in the provi- dence of God He had opened our way into some of the places adjacent to these colonies and it was gratifying to near from Mr Davis that in the entire Tongan group there were not in the present day more than one or two heathen people.
