It spoke poorly for the enterprise of hunting men and amateur horsemen that a ifield of only four horses should go to the post to run for the handsome trophy known as,, the Victoria Gold.

Referee) recently to consider the queation of. the maintenance of the chari table, institutions of the city, the Mayor intimated that Sir Julius Vogel had sug gested to him that a tax of 1 per cent, of all the money that passed through the tptalisators could be devoted to charitable purposes. The suggestion is at least practical, and I scarcely think the racing institutions would miss the sum so devoted, as oyor half a. million went through the totalisators in New Zealand during the past season. At 1 per cent charity would have benefited to the extent of something like .£5000. While on the subject of de voting part of the proceeds of the totalisa? tor to charitable purposes, disabled jockeys should be bornu in mind.
