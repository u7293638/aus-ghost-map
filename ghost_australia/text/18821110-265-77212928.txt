The Hon. William Forster. (Crowded out of last isisuc.) Tins gentleman died in Sydnoy on Monday la*t. He was born at Madras, in 181-, came to Australia when liii was about eleven yeai> <if age. Like many uf the public men of this colony, lie was a "pupil of Mr. W. T. Cape. At an early ape he entered into squatting pur-nits. Whdsi so tuxupied ho did not neglect literature. About the time that Mr. Hoberlson w«< nctiiajr as the delegate of the squatters. ami n)>)>oalitig to the Governor for redrew, Mr. Former wrote a satin? having the same end in view, which he published ill the Alia* newspaper. umicr the title of ''The Devil ami the <«ovoriwr." In thi*> speech he displayed his power of using stinging words. Mr. FoMi.t also wrote a *a!ire eMiiled " The Genius and ihe Ghost"-a dialogue between the gi.-nin»> of Sydney and the ghost of trans* puliation. I lut ing tiic Crimean war he wmlc a sonnet in mo*c tfolcinn strain, on national 1 grandeur and decay. Stuf his genius for Mitire has been more allied with the logie and eloquence of public oral ions than with the art of veoificftlion, in which he has shown that he can excel. Shortly after the intro duction of lietponsihlc Government, Mr. Fotster made himself known to the people of ! this country as a leader in parliamentary conflicts. At diflcreDt times he represented Kiwi Sydney. St. Leonards, the Mattings, Quennlrcyan. IHawsuia, and Murrumbidgee. j From the time of his entering Parliament | Mr. Former was a keen critic of the Cowjwr j administration. Agreeing with that adminiK-! tralion in political principles, he was ever on j the alert to detoct inconsistency in their | practices. When the Education question j uunic on. the denominational tendencies of Mr. Cowper's «chcme offered an opportunity for fittJiek. That Government was defeated, and Mr. Monster wasentnibted with the work of forming a ministry. He associated with liitusclf Mr. John Black (as Minister of Lands). Mr. Haul Samuel (as Treasurer), Mr. G. Ksgar (on Minister for Works), Mr. K. Wise, (afterwards Judge of the Supreme Court (as Attorney- General), and Mr. J. P. Margrave, now Mr. Justice Hargravc (as Holieitor- Gencral). This ministry was de feated on their Upper House Electoral Bill, and retired in March, 1808. Mr. Forster has not since that time lwcn at the head of an j administration, Although the opportunity of ; taking that position was offered to him in i May. 1P72, when the Martin ministry was | defeated on the Border Duties question, lie ; was Colonial Secretary in Mr. Martini first | ministry, and Secretary for Lands in Mr. j Uobcrlbon'hticcomi ministry. From February | fl. 1H7,", to February 7, 1870, ho was Colonic! ; Treasurer in the Robertson ministry, and on i llmt date was appointed A gent-General for tlic Colony «»f Now South Wale*. resident in London. Mr. Former's 1 nlcnIs have been chiefly displays! in opposition. In the strength anil culture of his logical powers he wax foremost ih l*;irliaitieiil. During his re-idenee in Ivngland he published two or 111 ret1 poetic works, notably " The Weirwolf,*' -a tragedy. Altout two years ago in con sequence of some misunderstanding with Sir Henry Parke*. the two old friends came to A serious disagreement. Mr. Former resigned hi* oilice in London, ami returned to New South \Valcv. When it wrvs known that h«' wa- <m hi* way out his nl«l constituents pre vailed upon their representative to resign, and eleeied Mr. Forster in his place, so that when ilic popular politician landrd in Sydney ho found that a neat in Parliament was already securei for him. Ho immediately placed himself in opposition to the Govern ment. and has since led the lilieral party. : An eloquent debater, a waiter of the art of polite but pungent sal ire he ha^lieen dreaded . by the party in power and politically his death n> them will bp a happy release.
