The Factory Girl, (Commenced in the Evening Nkwb, Sept. 3.) ?' Weel, weel, tliat's tlie end V puir Wullie, said Hugh., wiping away a tear that was stealing down Ms cheek. ' He's gone, and there's hardly onything tae show that ne ance Had been.' ? ' TMs is all the memorial tliat we liave of liim,' observed Sal, taking up. the ribbon with the china ornameut attached. Hardly had Mr. Glanworth's eye fallen on the latter object, than he started up, and, clutching it wildly from her hand, looked at it with intense eagerness. ' Guid gracious! what's the matter, sir?' asked Hugh, who, with the others, was re garding him with astonishment. ' It is — it is. 0, merciful heaven, it is!' exclaimed the minister. ' Where, tell me where you got this ?' ' Willie has always worn it about his neck,' replied Sal, to whom the question was more particularly addressed. ' Oh ! a light breaks in upon me.. This boy- — he was an orphan you say. WJio were his parents ?' ~ 'That is more than we can tellj and when we called him an orphan, it was not because we had proof of the fact, but. be cause we never had any clue to his birth or parentage. But you seem strangely moved. Does that little ornament lead you to suspect or guess anything ?' ' It does — it does. It — -it has always been about Willie's neck. Then lie is ^my brother's child — the child which so unac countably disappeared when an infant, and of whom.no trace £ould.Bver be had. Tell me — for mercy's sake, tell me — all you know about Willie? Willie, too-^the very name. Mine, also— he 'was named after me. Oh 1 quick, tell me all you . know?' These words threw the party into a state of excitement as £reat almost as that of Mr. Clanworth himself. Hugh had started up, and lay on his elbow, looking with intense expectation alternately at the minister and Sal j while Billy and. his wife, and Mr. Hay had also started forward, and were eagerly examining the China ornament which Mr. Clanworth heldtightly in his hand. Sal hesitated when the minister put his . question bo urgently, for she foresaw that her past history and de gradation would be disclosed; but her hesitation continued only for a minute or two. The importance of the result iax outweighed her own private feelings, and Bte resolved to narrate what was necessary to be known. Mr. and Mrs. Barton, and the npvelistj judging that their presence would be felt anno j ing, were quietly leaving the room, but Sal prevented them. ' Do not go,' she said, ' I have that to tell which may sufEu.se my cheek with, shame — but from you, I know, I shall receive sympathy rather than condem nation.'' Thus requested they stood, and Sal, ?without minutely relating her- connection with, and betrayal by, Dexter, or hinting at the true relationship of Lucy, gave I her hearers to understand that she tad been seduced and basely for saken ; that, in her extremity, she [ had allowed herself to be lured into the I haunt of the., gang of th.e Tontine Close, I where she had remained for a long time, I and knew how Begging Jessie had brought I Willie in one day, when quite an infant, I and refused to say where or how she had I got him, or whether he had any I relations. 1 ' The time — can you tell me the time I Tvhen this was?' cried Mr. Clanworth, with; ? breathless eagerness. \ B Sal paused to reflect, and, in the silence,, ? the short, quick breathing of the Agitated ? minister could be heard, while ne stood ? -'With fixed eyes piercing her countenance ? as if ^ -rvould Imn-w 'h*vr. h.tirwat nr» 1iot» I tongue uttered it. E ' It must be near twelve years ago. It I Was the winter time. I think the month I of November.' I m'1* k'^1* must be 8o!' gasJPed Ml I Clanworth. ' One thing crowds in upon I . another to show that Willie wasindeed the B long lost child bf my brother. Ob.! in I Bcrutable are the ways of Providence. For I 12 years my brother has mourned for Ms I boy, and would not be comforted. And I doubly was he bereaved, for the J3hoek I caused to hisyoung. wife by the loss of her I babe was tod much for her to bear, and I she, too, was taken from him. But let n& I be a little more minute. He is my only I brother, some years older than me, and tfce - I possessor o£ pur fathers estate— my por ? tion as younger son, consisting of a sum of money which, enables me -fed devote'ijJajH time to visiting the poor, and sIbo of ; &*pr] plying a few of the ma,ny Wants; .w%ach. daily come before me, my ©wn7£ur|-|us-: being liberally augmented by xnyvbrother's* generosity. I was never' married Wii-*and here Mr. Clanworth sighed, for the w6*ds opened an old wound* which time had. jxot; fully healed. ' ify, brother, however-,; married early in lSEe, and had one soa^--;; aiery, impetuous bo^,,who could not brook1 Ms father's control, and finally abandoned '. hij' childhood's home, never being, 1(Jai&#* heard of.

'; At length he married again, and a iSoy^was ' born unto 'him. How his heart was bound up in the babe. Perhaps God saw fit to chastise him for his idolatry by removing tke idol from Ms sight. The family came to Glasgow to spend the winter, and one day, the nurse, having taken out the child, returned distracted, saying she had lost it — how she could hardly say. The only coherent account she could give was that, While looking into a milliner's window in Buchanan-street, the child had left her ere §he knew, and when she. sought, him he '. could not be found. JJe.;Urore rotund', his neck that china ornament; y I^tntj^ it well.

' ?.: ;,... - .-.' . Mr. Clan worth hurriedly ? shook' hands with' them alii and departed, leaving them full of wonder. He carried with; him, the \- circular /China ornament. ? 1 -« The like o' that,'' ejaculated jHugJi,ifas they remained silently gazing at one; another. ' Puir 'Wullie ! He has missed his f ai^her on .eatth, but he iias gane taext ^better PaitJierTin neaven.' .--J The d&y; on r which Willie was buried was, as .we have said, a bright, balmy -day in early -spring, but, as frequently happens at. thait Beason b£ the year, a sudden change took place ere night. The sky, so clear and_ serene, .became overcast a little before .sunset, ,anS . gusts of a sharp, cold wind -came at intervals along the street, with a quick, rustling sound, which wasiirst heard in the distance, then it struck chilly against the form, arid 'passed on with, the sound of , a distinct motion, . till 'it ?-- died away. As the twilight deepened, these gusts grew stronger and jnbre frequent, while banks of black clouds rose in the north, and out of them came fitfully, and. borne ron the im pulsive wind, large, snbwflakes, -which cltEng tenaciously totheolijectii oniwMch they chanced to fall. Intense darkness 'now came quickly on, for the gloomy clouds scudded swiftly up from the horizon, till they o'erspread the sky, and filled the air with dense black masses. As they rushed along, the wind, increased in fury, and finally brought Vith it millions of. flying flakes, which flew madly along the streets, and soon coated /the lamp-posts and passengers with patches of white. How the flying flakes whirled into the entries, and doorways, and close mouths,. and; flew against the window panes, till the.^ gaslight, shining -from within, was obscured, and the articles ex hibited were made indistinct, and almbit invisible. Out j from thte dense, ovot-; hanging clouds they came, till they rushed: alonfi^ the streets, as: it were, wMtewaves, faintly discernible by 'the flickering light from the lamps. It /was a -dismal, dTeary sight, for soon &e; pedestrians, became ^fe.w, and the veMcles -vanished, ? ? and many of the , lamps went = out, and- the shivering forms of half-^clad beggars, crept into the dark doorways, 6r^ huddled' in twos and threes under the -arches, whi§i& they were., still exposed to the piercing wind, and' where not a few of the largejflat flakes reached them. When the storm was xaging in all' its. fury, three men and a boy issued from a close near /the foot of the High-street, and, facing the blast, began to -take their way up that ancient thoroughfare. 'My eyes, Bill, what -&*nigb±,' anuttered the foremost, as neiialfe-cjoncealed a spade below Ms arm, and \\-ent Ms liead against the blinding ^nowflaies. r ' Blest if ever I saw Its match,*' saidthe second^ who had been tints' addiesBed, as he also tried to shield Ms face from the severity of the night. } ' All the better for our job,' growled the third, in the gruffest aad deepest of ?voices. *' Nobody wall be moving about tb annoy us.'

' Well, keep up your heart. Ben has got a flask with him. Haven't you, Ben ?' ?« To be sur^^t h.avg,' replied- the latter personage, slapping |iia immense, nand on .that part., of his shaggy coat wMch con tained a pocket. ' I heard the wind howl ingjn the closje,. and guessed we'd need a ^rno^t^fi^l to kdep i^ie cold out.' 'Pm4 blest but that's jolly,' said the Swaggerer^ with -great satisfaction. 'Let us bear ||p hfere, ^ind have a pull at it.' 'Nay, not here,' remonstrated Bill. 'Wait till we- get to the lee side t)f the ,Mgn wall, and we can swig a bit before fixing the ladder.' 'I say, I don't half like this job,' wMs pefed the Swaggerer, who in truth had secret misgivings about it ever since ne and Ms coauadesi had received the coin mission, though he enfdeavo'red to conceal them hitherto. « I don't half, like it,' Ke continued. '^1 can face living flesh and :blood with any man,' but I!ye no notion bf going among -dead men and. ghosts. What doyouthinki Bill?^--!;' s ' V Bill honestly confejsgd_thaii he, top, would rath!er hiaVe wanted, the job. ' To break into a house,' he remarked, *' is quite in our way, but to break into a churchyard is a different matter. Ghosts can't be shot ©r gagged, and -there's no saying what they might do to a fellow.' 'Bah! what, are you frightened for? Ain't these four of us??' growled Ben, in. a tone of contempt. * ' What's four mortals, against a legion \--i fiends^ backed by the devil Mmself ?' cried Bill, querulously. 'What do you need to care for fiends?' said Ben. ' Flesh and blood might do us harm, but there's precious little fear of anybody bothering us on such $, night as this.' ' Fd rather meet flesh and blood than spirits, though/' muttered the Swaggerer, ' andthis is just a night for the latter to be abroad..' They were now approaching tlie high wall which enclosed the Necropolis, and, when they came close to it, were some what sheltered from the bitter wind and the drifting snow. The latter had, indeed, decreased somewhat. It did not come down .in such slanting sheets, and the sky io the north was fast lightening— -the blast was almost expended. ,They gathered into a gr6up close to the wall,' and Ben, diving Ms hand into the capacious pocket of .Ms coat, brought out a large black flask, and putting it to Ms head, took a hearty pull. ;?; 'Ha, that's the stuff,' he remarked, prhacMng Ms lips with great satisfaction, and at the same time handing the vessel to the Swaggerer. 'Drink at that, man,: and you'll find your courage come back,' Bob .needed no second .invitation ; but lifitingtlie flask.to Ms lips, he held it there so long^ and sucked bo ardeniiy, that Bill began to 'get alarmed for Ms sharev ,..- « TTilVoa!' he exclartned, putting out Ms hand, *'-d6n'.t run it dry.. Pve g^pt a heart to be warmed as well as you* .. Stop, I eay. Nay,. then, I shan't stand on ceremony.' And with a jerk, lie snatched it from Bob's' head, and applied it io his own. - ' Leave a drop for me, Bill/?, exclaimed a faint voice, and Little Tip crept forward, sMvering, and laid Ms hand on Bill's arm. ' Oh, Tip, I'm blest if I minded on you,' said Ben. ' You hear Mm, Bill? Don't drain it, man, don't drain it. The boy has more need of it than any of us.' \ **_It's all very well you talking when you. liave got your pull,' remarked Bill* taking the flask from his mouth, neverthe less, and handing it to Tip, witib. a saga cious remark not ,quite, original, about ' the dregs' falling %o the wicked.' Tip drained- 4he:bottle, and declared him self satisfied. ' « if dw* to wibrk,' quoth Ben. « ghaff we go over at this part of the wall,' Little Tip haVing 3wen appealed to as to the |iact hocaHliy of Willie's grave, it was ieemed that the place -at wMch they were was ?about,^he best for -getting into the Nfce-o|)61iB, There %ereno adueeB very near, and that part of |he wall was a little -lower than on either side of them. ? From another pocket, Benr produced a coil of ropes, with iron graplings at one , end, and the coilj wiie'n unwound, turned i out to be a rope ladder j all complete. . , 'Just you throw it up, will you?' lie . said, giving it to Bill, ' and I'll -go first, for I'm. heaviest.' i Bill threw the rope many times before i it would hold, but at length it did catch ?on the .other side, and Ben prepared' to » afccendy'^ie ©thetfi holding: thtf1 ladder '? siasady? below. Slowly and with nmch^ !. difliculty Bea AountoeM^ifee'^pr.and, getting himself astride on the copestone, ; looked * deliberately over among the i tombs. ? .?-?*. ft Devilish^ cold up. theire^-BBn^. isn't . it?' said Boo. ,^ ' ' Rather fancy it is,' answered Ben, ... very composedly. : « Oh, he doesn't feel it,'. remarked Bill^ . 'A Greenland snowsttfrm wouldn't touch Ms heart. ^But I say, Ben, do you see i anything in particular —^ anything in , white?' - ' Yes j I see ever ao many things in white,' replied Ben. 'Bless my sotdrt 'and are theymov : ing?' - .-.??:?..?? ::.;? i . *!Noj they are -pretty still just at pre 'sent. -? ? . ?'..?..-., ? - ? . « Ah, of course,*' faltered Bob. ' They are waiting till we' get over, and then they'll play their cantrips. What size are ,' they^Ben?' ?'-,' -. . - - 'All sizes,' returced the latter, whe still sat very composedly on the top of the wall. ** But don't - be alarmed, the wMte things are only the tombstones covered with snow.' 'Oh, he's larking us,' Baid Bill, in a tone of reproach. . . - - ? ' Hand me up my spade, and I'll jump,' remarked Ben, reaching down Ms hand. Bob handfedU Mm: :up the article men tioned. 'Now,' cried Ben, preparing to make his way down on the inside, 'the last that comes mustn't forget to draw up the ladder.' . - ,' ' , - *' Thafs Little Tip^S business,' remarked Bill. 'Do you hear, Tip?' **Let me alone for that,.' returned the ' sliarp iad, whonx the brandy had now warmed. Ben, glancing again up the slope among *the monuments, .made a spring, and came down on the with, a force wMcn made it shake on- the ether side. 'He's felled,'-' ejaculated Bob, looking . at^Bill in dismay. .. . -? . --,?'??- '*' All right,' was heard in a growl from . the interior. ' Come on quickly 1' With rapid steps Bill ascended, but the moment Ms head rose above the wall, the keen wind struck him with a' force that brought a most decided oath from his lips. It now bore no snow on its wings, but cut through the frosty air with a severity un paralleled— at least Bill thought he had never felt its match. For a moment he held down his head and hesitated, but the next he boldly raised it again, and got upon the wall. Ben had sat down upon a flat stone im mediately below, and,, with folded arms, was looking silently up at him. ' I would advise you to slow yourself down that wall,' he remarked, ' for its rather a hard jump.' , ' . . Bill took his advice, and half -slid to the ground, where he alighted in safety. Bob came over next, and; finally, Little Tip ? the latter fastening the rope on the out side, as a ready way of exit when their task was done. 'Now, iny covey, show us the way,' said Ben^ rising and shouldering Ms spade. ... . . ./ Little Tip now took the lead, andguided them by winding paths towards the corner where Willie had been laid. In silence they went, for, now that they were fairly among the graves, they felt the loneliness of the place. Bob, who was last, . kept close at the heels of the others, and was continually ' glancing from side to side, half-expecting, yet fearing to see some object moving- among the stones, wMch. were now ghostly enough in appearance themselves, with their sheets of snow. How melancholy the sound of the,wind was, as it rushed through the open -spaces between the pillars and columns, ' or soughed in iron-bounded aisles and vaults. It was like many weird voices* whispering together f in fact. Bob ''thought it strangely resembled a congregation ©i spirits con versing with each other, and he looked to see them moving about and coming to do them barm. But for the brandy, we are not sure that Bob would have had courage, enough, to sustain Mm in the undertaking. (to be continued.)
