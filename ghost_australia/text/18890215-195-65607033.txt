CAUGHT IN A STORM. The storm-cloud with the, west wind gale Had nursed their mad devotion, ill flush'd with rage they mad'ning got, As they traversed the ocean. They mark'd their course o'er hill, o'er dale, Illumed the scene around them, And loud their chant in accents wild, Re-echoed most astounding. SThe pigmies of this rotund earth Were seized with death-like terror, Though all ahoused in castle lair, And hidfrom nature's mirror So thought Int this midnight hour, But ahl I was mistaken For maidens three, and youth hut one, Gave me a sad awaking. They sealed my garden gate with fear, And beg'd for rest and shelter, So out I got, and oped the way, As they came helter skelter. Then to relate their storm caught tale,. .They each and all recounted The danger of that midnight hour, Of difficulties surmounted. Howthat a hcrse, or ghost, or diel, Had crossed their tr:cks adveinture,:; Bereft them of their wits with fear, Nor father dare they veiiture. Till "shoo" they cried, away it hied, Be't horse, or ghost or devil. They reckoned not, they shelter sough", Most humble and most civil. Nor would they venture out again, Till storm it had abated, Till wind and flash most civil got, And then they were elated. \- Now whates e-they foc wind or rain,' ..TWhen wind ani ihHas slumbered, When stillness reigned the scene, And stars shine forth unnumbered. What heroes are we one and all, When peace and plenty reigneth, When war clouds banners but a dream, And mirrored peace remaineth.
