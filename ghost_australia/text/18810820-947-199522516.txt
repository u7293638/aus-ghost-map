' But I don't feel quite easy with: re-.: gard to our teat,' I answered. '.This half.-' crazy f alow .takes queer notions 'into his head, and lnightfancy that if : he. could: destroy our belongings he could throw. us. off the scent.' ''.-?.? ,:..:..''? ''True, yet I do not, feel ? anxious :';; somehow I think he will leave this' part, : if here it is that he has hitherto lived.'' j '' It cannot be always here that he has lived, because, look at the distance I was: from here when I first encountered him.' 'Oh, .well, we will chance it for to-day at any rate. Let us trace the creek to its ? source, and wash occasionally. If we find the colour wo shall be justified in con cluding that the body is to be found.' ' Acting upon the philosopher's resolution we followed the creek to where it became only a little trickling, slimy ooze. We re turned, marking our track carefu lly un till we came in sight?of our tent. As we passed the spot where I had met Scotty, /. I saw that his tin dish was still . there, and I concluded that he would return when the suspicious fit had -been over come. Arming ourselves with such ap pliances as answered our purpose, we con tinued the search up the creek several days, finding two other smaller ones that ' seemed to ooze out of the same rock. The precious metal was present in all these oreeks in very small quantities, and ceased in the ooze at about the same level in each. But it is needless for me to tell yon all that we did during the succeed ing days of our stay at the amphitheatre, as . .we termed it. The philosopher justified his few friend's admiration and confidence by the calm, careful, yet zealous search that he kepe up during the long summer days, never kindling into, enthusiasm nor . sinking into despair.' With regard to my self I cannot speak so -favourably. I confess to feeling ''-'a'1 positive; hunger and ,thirst after the discovery .There, ;. so' close to us, ' yet : eluding his — there, as assuredly as we r were, . yet mocking us with specks and; colours and indications. The stock* of '-'provisions .was exhausted, we must return,', and we had not found the great' object' of our search, the reward of our, toils, our endurance, our privations.1 r '; Which .Of ;usj should remain ?

The second night after I had left home I had .to encounter the. moat terrific thunderstorm that ever I remember to have experienced.. My situation was anything but pleasant. .It was not impossible that the huge tree .which had served me on my former journey as a resting place might become the. object of the forked lightning's particular regard, and even if it did not ithe storm of wind which accompanied .: the thunder threatened to wrench it from its, mother earth, and crush me beneath its. tremendous weight. Hpw.it cracked arid groaned ! How wild was the: riot of swaying trunks and crashing branches! The heavy rain beat in upon me, the incessant lightning flashes almost blinded me, but there I was compelled to remain, not knowing from one minute to another whether. I should not be hurried into eternity, or left there (more frightful thought) mangled and helpless, slowly to die. Although^ after as it seemed at the time an interminable period, the storm ceased, the thunder clouds travelled on, the stars again looked down upon the soaked earth. ' Wet and too much excited to sleep, I was stirring aa soon as day broke, and reached the tent without any other occurrence worthy of note. I found the philosopher sitting thoughtfully by the ?:'' fire, and his kind, noble face brightened .at my welcome. .': ?'?'? 'Not a moment too soon, Mr Harrowby;' he said ; ' I' was beginning to feel'hungry.' i ' I suppose you have not had anything to eat since morning.'

I remember — old Rowland Hill said j ust before he gave u p the ghost ?' Ah '! we do not like to die !' But I have been very near to death, and he did not seem the king of horrors to me. It is our habit of thought to separate our existence into two parts, this life, a^we callod it, and the next ; but I look upon it'only as one :— we all have our work to do, and if we work hard during our week in the world we shall earn the rest of tho grave, arid have a glorious vacation somewhere else.' 'I wonder,' I said, smiling, ''what there will be for geologists to do there'.'' ??* The philosopher laughed quietly, ' ' There is any amount of room, for inves tigation in the universe,' he replied!;' ' ';' ' Nor think Thee Lord of this alone, ?'': When thousand worlds are rouud.' ? ,?

If I fail to grasp the wealth 1 am seeking; and for. which I left England, I shall have to live on alone, without aim or purpose.' . ? ' Alone ?' said the philosopher, ' Ah ! you foolish fellow. I see how it is. Science is not so dear to you as some one of those Delilahs who shear our philoso phical locks and bind us with green withes of domesticity. ! Well, Harrowby, you can go back to her— the mine is found?' . , ',' ;. .'.,;. , I have heard wild stories of the- dig- gings — of the effects that sudden and unexpected good fortune produced upon poor fellows who had never known what' comfort or competence meant — of one . whose weak brain was turned and who went mad in the consciousness of success! I have read of another who when the huge lump of gold was raised to the sur face dashed it into fragments with his pick in a frenzy of delight, and allowed th» coaler lufaani around him to rob him of it I Now, I did not feel likve!j these — but ^oh_ !

He told me afterwards {that he saw immediate action was neces ;sary to ,, relieve !Cmy ? feelings,' for: 1 had jturned pale and trembled. I strode on after him— ii'p the creek that I mentioned formerly as the scene of 7my: encounter :with'poor Scott. ?', Onwards, without a .word we went— tlie philosopher striding' on a' well defined track that he had cut, and keeping rrie at my best pace. At last we reached the head of the creek, our course being much impeded by trees that had succumbed to the violence of the storm . A few yards further on a large tree had been torn up by the roots, and huge pieces of rock had , rolled. down the hillside. My friend sprang1 over one of the, roots of the fallen tree, and I heard his hammer click — click! In another, moment he was at my side , again with the soft pinkish stone in his hand, and his finger pointing triumphantly to two little yellow specks ! . It was all we needed. I will not trouble you with details 'of our after proceedings. We worked diligently day after day, returning to our home and bringing with us again such implements as were neces sary to assure us of the value of our discovery. . So. days and weeks .passed away, and nothing occurred to'? interrupt our labors ortochange the current of our; thoughts. In me a deep feeling of gratitude prevailed over all -other emotions, and I found myself constantly questioning why I above all others should be so happy and fortunate. Occasionally/ doubts would intrude, some such utter ances as 'Thy sex is fickle' would mar my deep joy. But I thrust them aside, Hetty, for if you are not true then truth exists not in this sorrowful world of ours. But one day we made a discovery that saddened both of us, and brought forcibly to our minds the recollection that life is but an empty thing after all, whether it be what men call successful or otherwise. We had been exploring the range of hills that formed the amphitheatre, and were . following 'the course of a creek' that flowed from a considerable elevation between the hills. ' In several places the sandstone was hollowed out into minia ture caves large enough for shelter in emergencies. At the head of the creek, to our astonishment, we found traces of fires and some cooking utensils, arid con tinuing bur search, came upon a much larger cave than the :6thers, the entrance being 'cunningly concealed; by a huge bouider^whicn, however, rolled-: easily aside.; Stooping /.'..low; ,.- we, entered ..this: . natural abode,, but an overpowering effluvia compelled us'' 'to; retire for 'a'^few minutes. With/the aid of: an |impromptu torch we again essayed to enter, and this time found ' : what we dreaded jyet sdm'eho w expected— the corpse of poor maddened Scotty. With difficulty, for it was in an advanced stage of decomposition, we con jvoyed it to the outside, and looked ' mournfully upon it. The tall, once powerful/1/ frame was'^ 'there, but ''the wronged, outraged 'spirit— where was - it?? r We'dug'a grave, and laid the poor';. body'1 there to-rest:uri'til the last! great ;conyul-: sibn ;shall level the hills and upheave -the ? valleys.;- :-?/.:-'? :- ' ; '?''?'!

We were sadder and wiser men after this episode, and having completed 'our labours returned1 to my friend's home, there to: make the best of- our discovery of -what the philosopher had resolved upon terming 'The Great Golconda Mine.'1 So now, dearest Hetty, you may' live.in daily expectation of seeing me, of again listening to 'that infidel fellow who had wormed himself into your confi dence.'
