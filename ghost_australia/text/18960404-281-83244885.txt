NOVICES IN THE MINISTEY, Pni>-CJi'AL FuASEit, oE C.imden Col lego, was Boiuewlint sovoro on what lio wag pleased to lerin novice in the Christian ministry, in his ? charge delivered at .Loichhardt on Tuesday night in connection with the ordina tion oE Mr W. X>. Pntison, who, he reminded tho congregation, was no novice, though young.' No student who left their college was 'a novice, and no Church hud a right to elect a novice as their pastor. Wrecked and ruined, and often disgraced, churches were often tho result of electing novices ns pastors. A novico might bo an ovangolist, but to be the pastor of a Christina Church, to be tho guide of young and old, to bo apt to teach ns well as to to learn, were not tho gifts ofauovico. Some had great gifts as evangelists, but the gifts of a pastor. Ho was called to work in which a novico should not be ongagod. As it happend, Mr Patison had for 13 years been engaged iu Christian work. Kvery etudeiit in their college had at least six years of oxperienco and un blemished character to recommend him. Youth was not a barrior in tho ministry; being a novico was. Mr Pntison was giving up prospects in business' which most young men in Sydney would onvy, and tho world's judgment oE him would bo that ho was a fool. Thoy did not profess to make ministers. Mr Patison's college train ing did not mako him a minister. He had gifts.from God, and tho confidence of his brethren ; but theso did not make him a minister. A church had cnllcd him to be their pastor; that only outwardly inado him a minister. ISveu though all the archangels in Heaven Inid their hande on his head, and tho hosts oE Ilcavcn joined in siuging his ordination hymn, theso would not mako him a minister unless the Holy Ghost act him npart and fittod him for the ministry. Thoy believed, however, that it was in the grace oE that Spirit that ho bad con secrated himsclc to work.
