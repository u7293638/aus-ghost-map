Original Correepondence. [We do not hold ourselvci responslble for the oplnlonl expressed by our orrespoandents.] THE RECENT EISTEDDFOD. To the Editr of the Queensland Tim s. mBr-May I ask the favour of a small apsoe in reply to a letter, and copy of protest seot to committee of Blacketone Eisteddfod, Re the decision of the adjudioator, in the ohoros ' Thanks be to God," which appeared in last Saturday's issue of your paper, as I consider it to be untruthful and misleading. The Brisbane Cambrian Choir Committee look upon it as be ing in very had taste, emanating as it does from the choir who had not a ghost of a chance, anod wa so far removed in the contest IA not to be taken into consideration, even for the eecond prise. More especially it releots upon the jostioe and ability of a very able gentleman, who by virtue of cultured taste and thorough knowledge of the art, was able and did give a fair and impartial verdict. The statement made that we .oompletely broke down is utterly false, it was simply a softening off that our friends, The United, do not seem to understand, but would do well to cultivate. The Brisbane committee consider it a grave charge, and desire me to say (as the wives and sweethearts of the Ipswich United Choir comi posed that part of the audience who are not satisfied) that we will put down £25 and they shall do the same, and we willaing them for the £50 at any early date they shall name, the con dition being that noethsr singers on either side shall be admitted to assist but those who sang on Good Friday in eaob chboir. I am, sir, yours faithfully, : 8. MARRBIOTT. Hon. Secretary Brisbane Cambrian Choir.
