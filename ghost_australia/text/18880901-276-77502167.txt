I XaMes' Column. Bachelor's Sail. j i By H'. 0. DODGE. Hurrah! hurrah for Bachelor's Hall; The Queen's away and I'm monarch of all; I don't have to hang up my coat or my hat, And when I get lonely I talk to the cat. I come when I like, and I go when I choose. The finest cigars help me scatter the blue3; No bundles 1 carry, and nothing I buy ; There's no one to care about-only " big I." I revel in wildest confusion around ; There isn't a thing in its place to be found ; My books and newspapers, they litter tha room That hasn't for weeks seen the sight of a broom. There's clothing or something on every chair; My bed's never made, but it's little I care; I sleep like a top, for therc'9 no one to call 1 take solid comfort in Bachelor's Hall. I've used all the dishes and now it's my fate To eat, when I'm home, on the back of a plate; I'm learning to cook, but, iilas, I confess I choose .to go hungry than swallow the mess. But, Bachelor's Hall with its comfort and quiet, Is almost too spooky for regular diet; No children live in it to welcome their dad, .No supper is waiting, no wife-0, so glad. No! Nothing but ghosts of the loved ones away Inhabit this tomb where alone I must stay, Compelled to break silence by having a chat With my woful companion, the strange act ing cat. O, gladly I'll yield (my crown sceptre and all The Kingly delights of a Bachelor's Hall To the Qneen of the Home when she cornea with lier train . To wisely and lovingly over me reign.
