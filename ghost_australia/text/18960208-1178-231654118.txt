"was' "putting temptation in the w iy of the "poor, and,, trifling with the feelings of it he criminal classes. I had my dinner at a 'restaurant, and afterwards spent- most of the evening atu cafe in the Piazza, where I used ; to go'io read the papers. About nine o'clock ' IP heard thunder, and, not : . having "any umbrella, Btarted .in a hurry for'my rooui. 1 ' " The storm came up more slowly than I had 'expected, but soon after I had . gone to bed it arrived, and . gave- a first- class exhibition of what VonicB can do in the -lino of 'thunderstorms when- she gives her- 'whole inirid to it. It rained as if the water. had' been emptied out of a thou sand washtubs ; the lightning . was so .sharp that it half blinded me, and the 'thunder shook the whole housefrom top ' to bottom. As for the wind, it howled .worse than a London milkman ; and 'as there was too muoli noise for sleep- 'ing, :T just lay in bed and amused my- ;se)f: watching the lightning. All at , once I .saw. something that I don't -mind admitting gavo me a start. I Uold- you that King! Arthur, as I "Used to call my suit of armour, always ' stodd . in a corner , of the . room. iWell, L happened to. bo lookiug ,in, that' direction,' when a flash of ightnihg'alidwed me that King Arthur had iiuoved about two feet away from the corner,, and. was' standing perfectly still in,- liis , new position. I don't \- mind ' .ordinary ghosts ; but when ' it : came -; to. a suit of armour ' ' waltzing around a room by itself I ' didn't like, tho look of- it. I lay there ' in the dark, trying to persuade myse.f j that I had been mistuken in' thinking | that I had seen the armour standing I in the corner when I went to bed, . I and saying to myself that the woman .who' took' cai;e ot the I room; must have moved it. / 1 knew 1 all tho time that this wasn't - true ; but when a man is fool enough to be frightoned at a ghost, he is always fool enough to believe any moderate lie. But by-and.Pby there came another flash, and ' I , saw" that the figure, had moved a couple cf feet farther along the .wall, and bad one hand stretched out,.; as - if it was feeling its wny in tho darkness. . - Now I knew what wus the matter. 'Some,ghpst. had. got into , that , suit of ufmour and Yvus walking around in it. .

The door was locked as. usual, and tlio koy was under m'y pillow. ;It was clear" that King Artliur must have gone out by way of .ilie window, Janid then I noticed that onejof the front win/' dows that looked out on the lagoon was"; partly open. I went and looked-, out of it, but there was no figure or -ar mour in sight. The tide '\yas un,usu'-r ally high — higher, in ' "fact, than !l; had" over seen ; it before. , Not-.q. soul ./-.was stirring at that early hour, and after wondering what could -possibly have become of ray suit' of "ardour and, its wearer, I: wont biok to; bqd-for another nap." . A-v' ; Simnions paused for; a moment-;. qnd we'all : 'thought that lio . liad 'finished his story.

" " Theji," said, he, taking a nows- papor cutting from his pocket- book, " I'll translatb a little para graph tiiat appeared . in the Adriatico — the Venetian paper—ten days or so . after niy experience with King Arthur. Listen to this Yestorday morning two fishermen, Carlo Fabris and Antonio Scamozzi, made a discovery of the most horrible in the Canal of Bui-ano. Soeing some- thingshiningunderthe waterutlow.i le, tHe'y arrived to bring it to the sur face. It was a complete suit of armour of tlie fifteenth century. In addition to being fustenod in the usual way," the armour was soldered to gether, and when the fishermen had prized the visor of the helmet open they were filled with horror to find that the corpse of a man, in an advanced state of decomposition, was enclosed in the armour. Evidently one treats of an atrocious murder, aud the police are soon to mako an important arrest.' "We all agreed that. Simmons' ad venture was a remarkable one, and nobody ventured to exprqss any doubts as to its literal truth.; Simmons was- hardly the sort of man with whom to discuss a question of veracity. But after Simmons had gone, home, and left us still at the dicnar-.tabie, the man who had been sitting next to him picked up from the floor the news paper cutting which Simmons had translated.' It had been cut from Galigmini's Messenger, and not from an Italiun- paper ; and instoad of re ferring to a gruesomo discovery by Venetian fishermen, it simply con- ' tained the hours of the departure of ' trains from Paris for London. — W.
