DRAWN DOWN BY AN ALLlGAT„ | "Yes, rrejskofcanynumber of all;gi i The swamp immediately in the rear 0f j quarters at Belize abounded with tbeu I often popped off one in the early from my veranda.

You know that I was station"! • «t Orange Walk, British Honduras, several months. The name of the pv&fl; sounds pretty enough, but that's all th»rt Jjt pretty about it- It is, in fac$, nothing a wretched Spanish Indian, village,«, ^ we had no outside associates and dp ei»n excepting hunting and riding. f| "In connection with thelatter pur^,<,jju£ were in the habit of riding -occasionally village called San Estevan, situated tweip:fl miles distant on the New River, but on raiSE far side of Orange Walk, so that we had ^ cross the river in order to get there. 1-^1 we did sometimes on Orauge Walk, > times at San Estevan, just as the seized os. There was no bridge or reojL ferry at either place, so that, our raetliod^H crossing was by means of a canoe, while, horses swam behind. As the canoe not hold more thai; two at a time, thefts man and passenger, this crossing wag a ^ . of time, more especially when any horses elected to be fractious. ^ "On the occasion of which lam about speak we,had decided to ride down on i " own'side of the river and cross over at i Estevan, as the rainy season was not ] over and the track in question was dec the better of the two. After a few enjoyable riding through the forest's p!»| ant shade we arrired at the crossing tjL shouted for the negro to take us ovei\ Vv";; soon put in an appearance, and we were 1,'i' soon safely landed ion the opposite shoji the horses seemingly enjoying tl»- • .."v* cool swim after the journey. W't saddling oar ■horses, preparatory remounting, when . we saw ai native sugar planter, or rai<chero, come tret ting down to the opposite shore. He pi. sen ted quite,a contrast to us in his picter. esque and splendid costume. It is needles to describe it. Everyone knows the velvet garments trimmed with gold lace and buttons, the beautiful -embroidered linen [ huge silver .spurs and broad sombrero oitihi j typical Mexican. . He was mounted od »I ,spirited Jifctle white horse, -which coatntialj favourably with; his black costume.

His, rider, with blanched face ana staring -eyeballs, -seemed to be struggling tol disengage himself from his sinking steetbj but- he, too, suddenly, gave a fearful screarjl and 'slowly sank from view. For a momerft no one moved or spoke, but *11 stood gazif&i; spellbound at the spot where so lately h»: been a human being full of life and gaiei&j; while his sombrero floated s-Iowly down tig sullen stream.
