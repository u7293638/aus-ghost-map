Mutton, Wattle Grove, near Oberon. All the members of the family were from home in the forenoon, with the exception of Mrs. Mutton, and that lady at the commencement of the fire was away from the house, enitaged in some of the duties pertaining to the form. In the morning, it. appears, the kitchen chim iney caught fire, but Mrs. Mutton sae. ceeded, as she thonght, in extinguishing the fire hefore shie left the house. It insthought ihowever, that some fire still remained in the chimney, for on Mrs. Mutton's return sie discovered that the kitchen and store house-one building- werein flames, The wind was blowing fiercely, it the time, in the direction of the dwelling house, whielI was only i' short distance from the kitchen, and beiforo Mrs. Mutton could save anything but a pair of blankets, the whole of the buildings were enveloped in a sheet of flame. Iii the attempt to save someof the propirty Mrs. Mutton's dress caught fire, and betbre she could extinguish it her back was severely scorched. The nearest assistance was three miles away, and so rapidly did the flames spread that the whole plaone was gutted in a very short time. The 'seaoson's :supplies' lihad only just been Iaid in the store-room,'and thus theloses is heavier than it would have beoon, In the store-room was an unopened can of koerosone, sand the re port made by its butirsting was heard at.a distance of three miles; a quantity of pow der and a double-barrel gun, loaded, were also in the house, and facilitated,the work of destruction, exploding with loud, report. The loss to Mr. Mutton is very great, and considerable sympathy, which no doubt will take a practical turn, is felt for him and his family in their afilietion, A PRISONERn SHoT.-The Wee Wan cor respondent of the Narrabri Herald, writing aon. the 71h, says :-Yesterday constablek Girling, lromi information received, at abn?iout 2 pm;, w?tit to Whitton's residence, about six miles from Wee Wan, to arrest a man for a criminal. attempt on one Emma Jauno Whitton (daughter of the min Whitton condeinned to deith at the Northern Assizes for'shaootingy at' the manu Smita, who;iad run away with his wife;) iHe overtook the maan about a mile on the Nurnahri side of Whitton's house; the man in question ias riding along, the road; the constable rode up to him, elarged him with the offence and arrested'him ; he (prisoner) was riding at the timne it 'low conditioned 'old horse, heavily encumbered with a large swag, nearly touching the ground on either side of the horse, consequently he could not travel above the rate of two mileo per hour, Constable Garling, thinikig it would be dark before reaching Wet, Wan, proenured a liorsniat shitton's to take himi on. They rodo'etloug together for ia mile or so8, whoam seemingly the prisoner's horse took 'it start; it was soon seen to be an in. tentional bolt, for the pace became a racing onie, Police called on him to stop, but hei was Iheedless to the call, mill still fbrged ahoad. Police again called on him, and threatened to slihoet liim if hodid not stand. iHe continued his puato to the river's banl.k; reached it about 150 yards in front; he immediately dismounted, plunged ii, and swarn across; Police called onihim to turn hask or he would shoot him; he still refused. Garlingthen fired over him tiveishots, and, having only one left,, found that, in the strict sense of his duty, he must fire at hism, which he did, hitting him in the neck. Subsequently arrested him, and confined him in the lockrup, 'ihe chase from start to inidlh was about five miles. tlirough, the HOnL owtAY's OINT-nupe, AND PILLs.
