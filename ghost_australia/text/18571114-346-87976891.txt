ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. THE LATE LOCAL COURT. the Editor of the Bendigo Advertiser. ' Sir,—In your issue of the 22nd of August, 1855, something better than two years and two months ago, a correspondent signing himself a " Pick and Shovel Man," on the occasion of the first sitting of the Sandhurst Local Court—the first debut, as it were, of the late judiciary-like institu tion—ventured through the columns of the Advertiser (then a tri-weekly), and after a careful perusal of the then new Goldlields Act, and a quiet reading of the Goldlields Commission Report, to express his conviction, auguring unfavorably of the operations of the newly-fledged Local Court, ■which held its first sittings in the Chambers of the Resident YVarden on the I Ith of the abovenamed month and year, predicting it an abortion, and ■unsuited to the exigencies of the times and the then condition of tho goldlields, and calculated to soon die out of itself, and in all probability by a natural death too. How far the prediction of "Piok and Shovel Man" has come to pass in the recent melancholy suicide of the late Local Court your readers and the public may decide; certainly the prediction is not verified so far as a natural death is concerned, for the recent suicide must be pronounced in every sense of the word an " un natural death,"—at least a coroner and jury would put it down as such. The arguments employed by " Pick and Shovel Man" were to the effect that the measure was radically defective, not only as it applied to tho constitution of Local Courts, but to all the leading points of the new Goldflelds Bill itself, which has been constructed evidently by persons totally ignorant of the real wants and requirements of the goldlields, and who had more or less misconstrued and misapplied many important (depositional, exceptional, and suggestive) portions of the Goldfields Commission Report, in carrying . out the anomalous details of what might be termed their obstructive bill; but as the arguments on which these comments have been grounded are probably of too abstruse and polemical a nature to enter into in detail, in the columns of a newspaper, I shall merely remark that the prediction then entertained has in little better than two years come to pass nearly to the letter, and the Local Court is now no mote. Only two short yeiirs has it figured on the stage of life, and then passed away by a deliberate apt of sui cide on the part of its late members, to be num bered with the slwdowB of futurity, to be aaaflaita recorded on the page of history among the things " that were." Alas ! tempera mutantvr. How far the gentlemen forming the late Local Court have been justifiedintlie step they have taken, and in thus recklessly deserting their posts and their constituents in the hour of need, is a question on -which a great diversity of opinion exists, and presents many grave and important considerations. If Local Courts/' and all such similar institutions, are to be mere vehicles of flippancy, and a sort of rostrum or theatre as iL were for men to exhibit both the vanity and weakness of their nature, and without any duo regard or proper respect for the interests of their constituents, and the public at large, in a moment of caprice to put hand to'thcir own life, and fling their resignations in tlve face of the Government, their abolition is a benefit to the community, and their existence should never have been tolerated on such a basis, and presents a practical and instructive illustration of the blun- | dcrings of legislations and legislators, and the torpor of mining communities and their represen tatives. The late Local Court members have been going about since their resignation, advocating the course they have pursued, in voluntarily resigning the important trusts confided to their keeping bj' the people—(in other words, blowing their own trumpets),—and also in advocating the claims of the Local Court as an institution. Now, if the Local Court, as a public institution, be all they represent it, it seems a piece of gross inconsistency, and superlative folly on their part, to have taken the course they have thought proper to pursue. It is like unto a man being provided with a good and trusty sword to dofend himself and household against all injustice and aggression, yet, when an enemy appears before him, he turns on his heel, throws away his good and trusty sword, and retreats into the innermost chamber of liis house hold, and calls his people together and informs them that the enemy is at the gate ; and that lie has thrown away his sword (his only defence), and is consequently unable to fight ; and then odifies them with a description of its virtues. The Local Court members have been respec tively returned by miningjconstituencies/ the same as members of Parliament or Municipal Town Councils, and duties equally as arduous and honorary have devolved on them to perform. That thoy have been recently placed in a somewhat critical position, it must be confessed, through the tergiversation of the Resident Warden on the one hand, and the " knock me down" stunningrlike assumption of Jpower of Chinese Protector qn the other hand,—not to speak of the threatened invasion on the part of the Government and their new Goldfields Bill,—and no doubt between the fires of these two' official great guns, and the destroying angel in the dis tance, the seats of the Local Court members were beginning to get hot enough, and doubtless they considered it better to die by their own hands, than to give up the ghost in a fair stand up " heel to toe" fight, though it is generally believed had they shown a little more pluck and possessed the requisite courage to have only shaped themselves, and put away the white feather altogether, they would in all probability have won the day,—who can tell ? They might and they might hot have won, for in all local machinery there are often in visible wheels, and wheels within wheels, that are the prime movers of the machine, and at the same time invisible to superficial eyes. Some of the quidnunc's infer that this invisible agency would have in any case given the Local Courtites a coup de grace, and made it next to impossible for them to have won the battle. Be this as it may, the prestige is certainly not in favour of the Local Court members or the course pursued by them on the present occasion. Like a city besieged, and at the first summons of surrender from the besie gers, they have cowardly capitulated and deserted their colors on the ramparts, and thrown them selves on the clemency of the enemy, when they should have stood out to the last man and even fired the very button? off their coats, in defence ef their liberties and of the trust confided ..to their keepipof by their brother diggers and mining, constituents t how they will manage to reconcile their conduct before the more intelli gent portion of their constituents remains to be seen. Of course, there are at all times "flats" and " asses" in abundanoe, to bp had for the drawing together, aud, like herrings in a barrel or onions on a string, you have only to stoop down and pick them up by dozens, or take hold of them by the tails or the end of tho string and draw them after you in scores and by hundreds, and subserve them I for every purpose you wish, and which they may seem best adaptable and suited to apply to. These "flats" and " asses," too, would give )'ou three times three for the livelong diurnal hours if .you were only to tell them off a table or a chair that the moon was made pf green cheese, and that the late Solomon Lobb's uncle was a member of the (uscd-to-be) Local Court. The ex-Local Court members, however, have promptly appeared to render an account of their stewardship, and, heaven help them) how they have managed to. stand uncovered in the presence even of the herrings and the onions, and to bay forth unto the moon their tale of a naughty Warden and a pig-tail Pro tector, is more than their best friends can tell j and now that they have received the applause and approbation o? (the herrings and onions- like por tion of) their constituents, and whatever maybe the ultimate intentions of tho said fish and vegetable like constituents to present their Local Court ex members, wjio have so nobly represented them and their interests in tho councils of the Court—-whether with a banquet fitting the occasion, or a piece or service of plate, or even a nugget itself, let every loyal subject of our dearty-beloved Queen and every patriotic man on Bcndigo say with a sincere heart to every individual member ivho committed suicide on the recent occasion in the Local Court, Re.quiescat in pace, and una voce let the epitaph be inscribed over the tomb of all collectively, " Here Cnnnt mnrhmm t>i vnr p.t nraetp.rp.n nihil.'' A PICK AND SHOVEL MAN.
