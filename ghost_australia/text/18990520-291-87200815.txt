A boyish, yoice came waging dorm the mountain, aide, and abovidh &nire.; lcadinc tw-x ponies, presently ceeame visiWe. de ^pending the i-adih to Gruntec'e Gufleh. .. ? 'Why, «r'ett, 'what brings you along here?' cried Tod, for the moment lifted free -of 'his gloomy thoughts by the sigfcit of his friends.. He hurried to meetihun, and the pjdr shook hands kearfcflly. 'Tve ihad leave to ask you over to the ranch for a day or two— that is, if you can be spared. How's fluek?' ? 'Prebty bad.' Jeff Hudson looked more closely at his' chum's face.. 'Anything like matter? Where's the dad?' 'Gone to— SaulviUe, I believe.' 'You believe! . Come, teliT me the trouble.' ' . ????.. Tod golphed down the lump fhat had risen ia his 'tlhroat, and the -words cams rushing from. hie. Sips in a. torren*. . . ? 'Old man Harvey was ifeiUed last night — stalblbed to death— and robbed of a bag. of gold, and those men yond-er beh'eye dad did it. They spoke of having heard eome tlhing from Pedro Ramarez, a scoundrel my father tthrashed one day for insulting /a. woman over a£ Pine Tree Gap.' . / 'Surely they don't stand on his word!' 'Father's knife, bloodstained, was ioun4 by i(3ie dead body. He was at Harvey's shanty last night, and came home ?saying he had to go to baulviHe for the old man (who was taken bad),,?n, particular private business. He seemed excited, and left immediately to catch the coach. But Tie would jnever have done so awful & thing as to -commit ? ' 'I aim sure -of it, Tod.' 'Those fools have started out to finid Him, and, when .they find him, theyHl lynch him!' 'Don't say that. We . must stop ' it. (Some, I brought a pony for you fco ride back to the ranch. Jump up; we'll see your dad first, and warn him.' In a second the boys were in 'the saddlle, and soon had the ponies going at top speed. Tod and his chum knew the country well enough to make their way through the forest. On and on they flew, till at length they deemed it advisable to strike the trail. This had scarcely been agreed upon, how ever, when Jeff, who was taking the lead, heard a cry and a thud, and turning saw Tod and his pony on the ground, the animal struggling to get up, the boy mo tionless. 'Tod! -Tod, old man! can't you speak?' The pale face was still, and down it a stream of blood ran fiohi a wound in the head. 'What am I to do?' cried Jeff in agony. 'I can't leave him here. And yet — what about Mr. Bowers?' Oh, for some way out of this awful di lemma. 'No good!' he exclaimed at last. 'Tod must be seen to. Heaven help tbe. other matter. Thank goodness the ranch isn't far.' II. When Tod returned to full consciousness, two days later, he found his faithful chum by his bedside. 'Now, you've got to keep quiet, old man, and get well as comfortably as you can,' said Jeff. 'Dad?' 'All right, as far as I know.' 'What do you mean?' 'Well, it seems Shooter Sam and the boys collared him. As the tale goes, he looked guilty; surprise, nd'doubt. It was dark, so the- gang made camp for the night. Next time they came to look for your father, he was gone.' 'Escaped them?' 'That's so.' 'And no one knows where he is?' 'Apparently not. The boys had been scouring the country; but the rains have commenced, so I suppose the best scour ing now will be done by the floods.' Tod smiled; but he was, nevertheless, very anxious about his father. The infu riated men of the Gulch might capture him again, and, incensed by his having once eluded them, show him no mercy. 'By the way, this Harvey was an old eccentric, wasn't he?' asked Jeff. 'Yes; but all right. We didn't have, much to say to him, nor he to us. His' claim was near ours. He was a bit of a mystery, and kept pretty much to him self; but on the whole he was well liked by the miners.' 'Wonder what that business was he got your father to do for him.' .'Ah! to know that would clear up the whole affair.' It was on the evening of the day follow ing that Tod was awakened from a refresh ing sleep by the sound of someone leaving his room. ? A moment later he heard heavy footsteps entering the house, and knew them to be those of Jeff's father. 'How's Tod?' 'Fast asleep, dad. I've just Jseen to have a look at him. An v news?' - 'The river's in flood and twice the size: it was.' ~~ ? ... 'Heard nothing of Mr. Bowers?. 'He's given himself up.' ^. : 'Given himself up?— where?' 'At Saulville^ : 'I didn't hear anything beyond that he'd .surrendered to the authorities. ,- At' least,1 there was something more.' 3 % 'Yes?' :'-'i; ? ? ? ' ' ' . ?

The river bor.« swiftly on ite besom Jeff Hudson's stout little craft. ? Darkness was f ailing, and the ' tall pines by the -water's edge stood up like lank ghosts- in the ga thering gloom, the sound of the rain among their ' branches* mingled with the thunder of. rushing waters, raising 'uncanny thoughts. ^ . . ' 'Pull in here/', at length, cried Jeff. Above the hiss of the rain and the eough of the wind, the. roar of the river, as it -crashed over rocks, was plainly audible. In midstream lay a long, low island, now . partly submerged. They had run the canoe ashore and were carrying it through the trees. Presently Jeff, who was leading, stopped. 'See, yonder,' he said. 'Isn't that a fire?' The boys set down their load, and crept cautiously forward. When within a few yards of the blaze, Tod drew up. 'It's Pedro Rainarez,' he whispered. Near the fire beside Pedro stood a mule. 1 Pedro himself at the moment; of 'the boys' ' arrival on the scene was undressing. Hav ing divested himself of - his clothing, he walked to the water's edge. The boys, Keeping at a safe distance, made for the same place. . _. . At the spot where -the Mexican stood was the Btump of a tree protruding from a : large mound, and round it was fastened the 1 end of a long hide rope. The other end of this Ramarez tied about Ms waist, and then, without_f urther hesitation, leaped in to tne water.' With powerful strokes he worked his way across -the swollen 'river, the rope gradually paying out from the coils on the mound. ?.'?'?.:. . - , ; 'There's something -yver there he's anxious to get at before the island's flooded,' said JefL ' : . Dangerously near the roeks at the head of the rapids Pedro Ramarez was taken be fore he reached the other side. For some minutes he disappeared, and in those minutes the rain seemed to fall with in-, creased fury. At length he again came into view, and in the dimness the boys were able to see that he had secured a bag about iris neck. ?Once -more the Mexican plunged into the water, ithis time hauling on the line. Be fore long, however, it became evident that he was in difficulties. The waves washed over him, the rushing tide seemed eager to. seize ajftd dash him against those deaxlly rocks.' At last, when half-way across, he he iflirew up 'his arms and uttered a 'fearful shriek. 'He's drowning! Look,\he?s trying to loosen the bag from his throat! «He'll be over the rocks in a lnimite! Pull on the, line — quick !' Five- minutes later they landed Pedro's body, apparently. (lifeless, among the pines. 'He's not dead,' said Jeff. 'His lieart beats, and, see, his eyes are opening.' Those eyes rested first upon Tod Bowers,1 and instantly the naked, wet 'form writhed as if in agony. -^ — 'You!' he moaned. 'Curse you!' That you should catch me thus. For the lov«. of heaven, get me a priest; I am dying.' In the sLence that followed, the sound of feet and 'tramping through the under-, growth wae heard. 'Hullo, there!' cried Jeff. 'Help!' Giniff voices answered. 'They're the menvfrom the Gulch!' de clared Tod. , 'From the Gu'lch!' shrieked Pedro, striv ing to rise. 'Don't let -them 4abe me. Save me! and I will confess. _ You can have the gold — loo-sen it from 'my neck; and there is more on the island yond'er, where I hid: this/' 'What would you confess?' demanded Tod; on a sudden inspiration. 'You will save me?' ? 'Confess! it was you who killed- -Old' Man Harvey.' 'Ah! you know.' 'With my father's knife.' . 'YeSTT stole it.' . 'To revenge yourself for ' the thrashing he gave you.' 'It is true. Oh, don't let those men take me.' '. The Mexican fell back. . Tod looked up. Shooter Sam and one or two more of the Gulch miners stood near. 'You heard?' asked the boy. ? 'I did.' 'You were on your- way to SaulviJle to break open the gaoJ and lynch my father.' No one answered for a moment; then Sam replied— . 'That's so.' 'Are you smart enough to see how things stand now?'- . . 'Don't kick us when we're down, young 'un. We'll make goodrbv hanging tho' greaser to this yer .tree.' 'You're too late,1 he's dead.' ' 'The reason I went to Saulville so mys teriously,' said. Mr. iJbwers, when he was \- free once jnore and explanations were asked for, 'was to see a lawyer for Old Man Harvey. He had heard that he. was sole heir to a large estate in England left bv his brother, and, as he was ill and likely, to die- and had\neitber chick nor' child, he sent for me.' .V ' . \\-«Why.?'-, ? ?
