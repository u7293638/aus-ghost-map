Mining Notes and Tips. [By Gnome.] I have little to report for this week beyond the fact that the system of letting prospecting areas on the Queen property has already led to a good find of galena. Quite a number of these areas have been applied for. The work of constructing the race at the Lymington gold area is progressing steadily, and results will be anxiously looked for. The galena at the Junction is improving in width, and Mr. Weisch, the new manager, has charge. At the Sylvester arrangements are being made to deal with the water. When the tributors get to work they will be well rewarded for their enterprise. The rumor regarding gold being found at Maria Island should not be taken notice of. Mr. Armstiong is sending pearls from river mussels to Streeter, of London, to test their value. There will be no Queen trophy at the Exhibition. The mineral committee that has charge of mineral exhibits for the Exhibition are acting ion the 'penny wise and pound foolish' principle. At Lefroy the mines are still looking well, and gold is still to the fore. The output of minerals for the month show a steady iucrease.
