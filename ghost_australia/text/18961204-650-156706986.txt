'In the drawing-room Lady Franklin drew the :l&wyer;: apart, and so it happened thiit Sir Philip found himself ..virtually alone with vTSosalie, at one; end of the long ' room. She was seated on a fashioned window soat, a very Julietj|ike figure, for the curtkin bad' been thrown back, and, with dreamy ey&, she was watbh the great, red harvest moon* v'tbat hang low in the heavenB lik a ball 6f burnished copper above the datk outline of the. shadow, trees;. , ? ? 'Yofa are thinking very deeply, Btisie,' Sir Philip said, as he joined her ' What is it—are you going to becoode iamons as a ijoetess ?, ,;You- look, as if ^ou were co&ilemplatin;^ an ode fo tlie moon.' She made;a;i;pas9wnate ; gesture, then tore the string of pearls from her throat as if their loose* band stifled her. ' You laugh, at me, Philip, yet I — -I wos thinking of the past. Do you know 'what thbt meaiis for me 7' 'Some happy memories and a good many. regrets, I expect., That is what thoughts of the past, bring to most of. as.' ' ' Happy memories ! Yes, I had then, fori was thinking of my old home. Fhilip, and how you .came there to read iwith my father. How happy we were in that dingy , old London ... suburb ! Not even tliris moonlighted landscape is so fair to me now as thosc dull streets were then.v - 'The.song is' rightj Phi|ip,: there iisi no tiling t;?half ,^0, sweet in; life' as Love's young dream.' 'Tho dreanii was - sweet enough;'? Philip retort'eli, rather bitterly, ' but the ^awakening was a sharp one.' She looked into his face again with 4ono'of jljerjpjvift,: ( sidelong glances, then her 'eyes drooped as she whispered, very low— The awakening has, never come for me, for, Philip, that dream js with me still, will be with me always- — » Miss Mainwaring, I hope I don't intrude, a9 'Pttul Pry say3' in the play, but: Lady Franklin has been! telling me how beautifully you sing, and I've come to ask you. Let' me hear you, if it is not too much trouble.' It was Harvey Dent who interrupted tho tete-a-tete He had approached softly,, his footfall makjng no sound upon tho thick carpet, and ' Philip Franklin thought it was the first time be had ever been glad to hear the little lawyer's voice. CHAPTER III. . Rosalie went to - the piano under Mr. Deiit'd e'scOH; b\it- as h^ fingers touched the keys she looked back at Philip. and then broke- into a mournful song, lull of passion and /pain — a ery that seemed to come,from her .yery, heart, as the yearl ing words rang out that told that ' 0)d love was waking— should it wake in vainr?,' ij- v-; ;:n; ; /?..-? | Perhaps she would have been wiser hadu she: ohOsen.i a different song.
