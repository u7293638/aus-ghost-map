A GHOSTLY GAME. The new number of Longman's Magazine contains the following note from Mr. Andrew Lang:—The Japanese have invented ghostly game, which may be commended to people tired of the monotony of thoughtreading. It is the Game of a Hundred Wicks. A lamp with 100 small wicks (fewer will do) is set in a darkling obscure corner of a house, just the sort of place which M. Pierre Loti's Madame Chrysantheme would have avoided. Then, in the pleasant light of lanterns in the drawing-room, the company begia to tell ghost-stories. Each, as he has told his tale, goes forth, and blows out one of the wicks in the lamp. At first it is all very well—who's afraid? But when it comes to blowing out the last wicks after hearing about 90 ghost stories, ah, then it is a very different affair. Finally, the last pilgrim sees " the spectre that appears when the lamp is going out;" no common or garden spectre this, but a bogie of the most appalling character. Now, is this not a pleasant drawing-room game and well worth introducing? Probably the lamps can be bought at any of Japanese shops. The spectre is shrouded, it is green, it has eyeB that drop blood—" white-eyed phantoms weeping tears of blood "—and it is provided with horns and a grin. Its lone hair hangs about it like a black windingsheet. Children's parties attended.
