CHAPTER IV IN THE SOLENT. The dinner was exquisitely cooked, and as perfectly ordered a repast as the most fastidious could devise or desire; but very little was said, mainly, I suspect, because our thoughts were filled with the one subject we could not refer to whilst the attendants hung about us. What fell was the merest commonplace, but I noticed that whilst Wilfrid ate little he offered no objection to the frequent replenishing of his glass with champagne by the melancholy chap who stood behind him. By and by we found ourselves alone. ♦'That is very honest port; you need not be afraid of it, Charles," said my cousin. "Do you understand gunneiy ? " " I believe I could load a piece and point it," said I, smiling, "but beyond that—" " Have you seen the gun on the forecastle ? " " Just the outline of a cannon," I answered, "under a smother of tarpaulin. What is called a long Tom, I think." " You will have guessed the object of my mounting it t" said he, with a frown darkening liis face to one of those angiy moods which would sweep athwart his mind like the deep but flitting shadows of squall clouds over a gloomy sky sullen with the complexion of storm. " Yes ; Miss Jennings explained." I answered, glancing at her and meeting her eye, in which I seemed to find the faintest hint of rebuke, as though she feared I might be laughing in my sleeve. " What's the calibre, Wilfrid i " " Eighteen pounds," he answered. " An eighteen pounder, eh ! That should bring the Shark's spars about then\x=req-\ ears, though. Let me think: the range of an eighteen pounder will be, at an elevation of five degrees, a little over a " If," cried my cousin—lifting his hand as though to smite the table, then bringing his clenched fist softly down, manifestly checked in some hot impetuous impulse by the sense of the presence of the girl, who regarded him with a face as serious as though she were listening to a favourite preacher—"if," he repeated, sobering his voice with the drooping of his arms, " we succeed in overhauling the Shark, and they refuse to heave her to, my purpose is to wreck her aloft, and then, should they show fight, to continue firing at her until I sink her." There was a vicious expression in his eyes as he said this, to which the peculiar indescribable trembling or quivering of the lids imparted a singular air of cunning. " Is the Shark armed, do you know I" said I. "She carries a couple of small brass pieces, I believe, for purposes of signalling. Fop-guns," said he, contemptuously. " But I fancy she has an armoury of her own. Lord Winterton was constantly cruising north on shooting excursions, and it is quite likely that he let the weapons which belong to him with the yacht." " If Colonel Hope - Kennedy's programme," said I, " includes a ramble amongst the South Sea Islands, you may reckon upon his having equipped himself nidi small arms and powder enough, if only with an eye to man-eating rogues. But to revert to your long Tom, Wilfrid. It should not be hard to sink a yacht with such a piece ; but yo.u are not for murdering your wife, my dear fellow ? " "No, no,"said he slowly, and speaking to me, though he kept his eyes fixed upon his sister-in-law, "have no fear of i that. It is I that am the murdered man." ; He pressed his hand to his heart. ; "Rather put it thus: that when they find their vessel hulled and sinking they will get their boats over and be very willing to be picked up by us." " But your round shot may knock their boats into staves," said I, "and what then ? " " Our own boats will be at hand to rescue them," said he, now looking at me full with an expression of relish of the argument. "But, my dear Wilfrid," said I, "don't you know tliat wheh a craft founders she has a trick of drowning most of the people aboard lier, and amongst the few survivors, d'ye see, who contrived to support themselves by whatever lay floating might not be Lady Monson!" He took a deep breath, and said, so slowly that he seemed to articulate with difficulty, "Be it so. I have made up my mind. If we overhaul the Shark and she declines to heave to, I shall fire into her. The blood of -whatever follows will be upon their heads. This has been forced upon me ; it is none of my seeking. I do not mean that Colonel Hope Kennedy shall posses my wife, and I will take her from him alive if possible ; but rest assured I am not to be hindered from separating them though her death should be the consequence." Miss Jennings clasped her fingers upon her forehead and sat motionless, looking down. For a little I was both startled and bewildered; one moment he talked as though his wish was that his wife should not be harmed, and the next, in some concealed convulsion of wrath, he betrayed a far blacker resolution than ever I could have imagined him capable of. Yet in the brief silence that followed I had time to rid myself of my little fit ot consternation by considering, first of all, that he was now talking just as, according to my notion, he was acting—insanely; next, that it was a thousand to one against our falling in with the yacht; and again, supposing we came up with her, it was not very probable that the crew of the Bride could be tempted, even by heavy bribes, into a measure that might put them in jeopardy of their necks or their liberty. It was now dark, and the cabin lamps had been for some time lighted. The evening looked black against the portholes and the skylight, but the cheerfulness and beauty of the cabin was greatly heightened by the sparkling of the oil-flames in the mirrors, the swing-trayB, the glass- like surface of the bulkheads, and so on. Miss Laura's golden loveliness—do not laugh at my poor nautical attempts to put this amber-coloured, violet-eyed woman before you—showed, as one may well suppose of such a complexion and tints, incomparably, perfect, I thought, in the soft though rich' radiance diffused by the burning sperm. I wondered that she should listen so passively to Wilfrid's confession of his in ten-, tions should we overhaul the Shark. My gaze went to her as he concluded that little speech I have just set down ; but I witnessed no alteration in as much of her . face as was visible, nor any stir, as of one startled or shocked, in her posture. Possibly she did not master all the significance of his words ; for how should a girl realise the full meaning of plumping round shot out of an eighteen-pounder into a vessel till she was made a sieve of ? Or it might be that she was of my mind in regarding the expedition as a lunatic undertaking, and in suspecting that a few weeks of this ocean hunt would sicken Wilfrid of his determination to chase the Shark round the world. Or mingled with these fancies, besides, their might be enough of violent resentment against her sister, of grief, pain, shame, to enable her to listen with an unmoved countenance to fiercer and wilder menaces than Wilfrid had as yet delivered himself of. These thoughts occupied my mind during the short spell of silence that followed my cousin's speech. He suddenly rang a little handbell, and his melancholy servant came sliding up to him out of the after cabin. " Tell Captain Finn I wish to see him — that is, if he can leave the deck." The fellow mounted the steps. " What is the name of that gloomy\x=req-\ looking man of yours, Wilfrid ? " ■■ jyiumn, * ne answered. " Have I not seen somebody wonderfully like him," said I, " holding on with drunken gravity to the top of a hearse trotting home from the last public-house along the road from the graveyard ?" Miss Laura laughed; and there was a girlish freshness and arch cordiality in her laughter that must have put me into a good humour, I think, had it been my wife instead of "Wilfrid's that Colonel Hope\x=req-\ Kennedy was sailing away with. "Maybe, Charles, maybe," he answered, with a dull smile; " he may Lave been an undertaker's man for all I know ; though I doubt it, because I had him from Lord with a five years' character, every word of which has proved true. But I knew you would have your joke. The fellow fits my temper to a hair; he has a hearse-like face I admit ; but then he is the quietest mail in the world—a veiy ghost; summon him, and if he shaped himself out of thin air he couldn't appear at your elbow more noiselessly. That's his main recommendation to me. Any kind of noise now 1 find distracting ; even music—Laura will tell you that I'll run a mile to escape the sound of a piano." At this moment a pair of pilot breeches showed themselves in the companion- way, and down came Captain Finn. As he stood, hat in hand, soberly clothed with nothing more jimcrack in the way of finery upon him than a row of brass waistcoat\x=req-\ buttons, I thought he looked a very proper, sailorly sort of man. There was no lack of intelligence in his eyes, which protruded, as from a long habit of staring too eagerly to windward and trying to see into the inside of gales of wind. He was remarkable, however, for a face that was out of all proportion too long, not for the width of Ins head only, but for his body ; whilst Ills legs, on the other hand, were as much too short, so that he submitted himself as a person whose capacity of growth had been experimentally distributed, insomuch that his legs appeared to have come to a full stop when he was still a youth, whilst in his face the active principles of elongation had continued laborious until long after the term when nature should have made an end. " A glass of wine, captain ? " said Sir Wilfrid. "Thank your honour. Meed makes the old wife trot, they say, and I feel a-dry—I feel a-diy." " Put your hat down and sit, Finn. I want you to give my cousin, Mr. Monson, your views respecting this—this voyage. But first, where are we ? " " Why," answered the captain, balancing the wine-glass awkwardly betwixt a thumb and a forefinger, that resembled nothing so much as a brace of stumpy carrots, whilst he directed a nervous look from Wilfred to me and on to Miss Laura, as though he would have us observe that lie addressed us generally; " there's Yarmouth lights opening down over the port bow, and I reckon to be clear of the Solent by about three bells—half-past nine o'clock." "The navigation hereabouts," said I, "needs a bright look-out. Tlio captain may not thank ua for call'ng him below." " Lord love 'ee, Mr. Monson, sir," he answered, " the mate, Jacob Crimp, him with the one eye slewed—if so be as you've noticed the man, sir—he's at the helm, and I'd trust him for any inshore navigation, from the Good'ens to the Start, blindfolded. Why, he knows his soundings by the smell of the mud." "How is the weather 1" inquired my cousin. " Fine, clear night, sir; the stars plentiful and the moon arising ; the wind's drawed a bit norradly, and's briskening at that; yet it keeps a draught, with nothing noticeable in the shape of weight in it. Well, your honour, and you, Mr. Monson, sir, and you, my lady, all I'm sure I can Bay, is, here's luck," and down went the wine. " Captain," said Sir "Wilfrid, " oblige me by giving Mr. Mouson your views of the chase we have started upon." Finn put down the wine-glass and dried his lips on a pocket handkerchief of the size of a small ensign. " Well," he began with a nervous uneasy twisting about of his legs and feet, " my view's this : Fidler isn't likely to take any other road to the Cape than the one that's followed by the Xndiemen. Now," said he laying a forefinger in the palm of his big hand, yellow still with ancient stains of tar, whilst Wilfrid watched him in liie near-sighted way, leaning forward in the posture of one absorbed by what is said; "you may take that there road as ^skirting the Say o' Biscay and striking the latitude of forty at about fifteen degrees east; then a south by west half west course for the Canaries ; the Equator to be cut at twenty- five degrees west, and a straight course for Trinidad to follow with a clean brace up to the South EaBt trades. What d'ye think, sir ? " "Oh, 'tis about the road, no doubt," said I, for whatever might have been my thoughts, I had no intention to drop a discouraging syllable then before Finn in my cousin's hearing. "But," said the captain, eyeing me nervously and anxiously, " if so be as we should have the luck to fall into that there Shark's wake, you know, we shan't need to trouble ourselves with the course to the Cape south of the equator." " Of course not," exclaimed Sir Wilfrid. "By which I mean to say continued the captain, giving his back hair a pull as though it were some bell-rope with which he desired to ring up the invention or imagination that lay drowsy in his brain, " that if we aren't on to the Shark this side the Line it'll be better for us to tarn to and make up our mind to crack on all for Table Bay to be there afore her, without further troubling ourselves about her heaving in sight, though, of course, the same bright look-out '11 be kept." "Good," said Wilfrid with a heavy emphatic nod; " that's not to be bettered, I think, Charles." " I suppose," said I, addressing Finn, "that, though your hope will be to pick up the Shark any day after a given period, and though you'll follow the scent of her as closely as your conjecture of Fidler's navigation will admit, you will still go ou sweating—pray pardon this word in its sea sense, Miss Jennings—your craft as though the one business of the expedition was to make the swiftest possible passage to the cape of Good Hope ?" "Ay, never sparing a cloth, sir, and she's something to jockey, Mr. Monson. You don't know her yet, sir." " The Shark's & fore-and-aft schooner]" "Yes," he answered. " She carries a square sail, no doubt? " "Ay, a big 'un, but good only for running, and we ain't without that canvas, too, you must know," he added with the twinkle of humour in his gaze that I had observed in him when "Wilfrid had first made him known to me. "Enough of it, Mr. Monson, to hold wind to serve a Dutchman for a week, not to mention a torps'l and t'gallants'l fit for a line-o'\x=req-\ battle ship to ratch under." This was vague talk, but it pleased Wilfrid. " Square yards are very well," said I; " bat surely they don't allow a vessel to look up to it as though her canvas was fore and aft only ? I merely ask for information. My marine experiences were limited to square rigs." " There's nothen to prevent the Bride from looking up to it as close as the Shark," answered Finn. "The yards '11 lie fore and aft; what's to hinder them ? There ain't no spread, sir, like what you get in ships with your futtock rigging and backstays and shrouds in the road of the slings elbowing their way to channels big enough for a ball-room. Besides," he added, " suppose it slwidd be a matter of a quarter of a pint's difference, we need but stow the square cloths, and then we ain't no worse off than the Shark." "True," said.I, thinking more of Miss Jennings than of what Finn was saying : bo perfect a picture of girlish beauty did she happen to be at tliat instant as she leaned on her elbow, supporting her chin with a small white hand, her form in a posture that left one side of her face in shadow, whilst the other side lay bright, golden, and soft in the lamplight over the table. She was listening with charming gravity, and a countenance of sympathy whose tenderness was unimpaired by an appearance of attention that I could not doubt was just a little forced, since our sailor talk could not but be Greek to her. Besides, at intervals, there was a lift of the white lid, a gleam of the violet eye, which was like assuring one that thought was kept in the direction of our conversation only by constraint. I was beginning to feel the want ot a cigar, and I had been sitting long enough now to make me pine for a few turns on deck, but I durst not be abrupt in the face of my cousin's devouring stare at his skipper and the pathetic spectacle of the contending passions in him as he hearkened, now nodding, now gloomily smiling, now lying back on a sudden with a frown which he made as if to smooth out by pressing his hand to his brow. "The Shark" said I, "lias five days' start of us. Give her hundred miles a day, for the mere sake of argument; she should be, at that, well in the heart of the bay." " By heaven! within arm's length of us, when you put it so!" cried Wilfrid, extending his hand in a wild, darting, irrelevant gesture, and closing his fingers with a snap as though upon some phantom throat he had seen and thought to clutch. " Five hundred miles," exclaimed Finn, apparently giving no heed to the baronet's action. " Well, sir, as a bit of suppos\x=req-\ ing^, there's no harm in it. It might be more. I should allow less. There's been no weight of wind down Channel. What's happened, then, to blow her along ? But there's no telling Anyhow," said lie, picking up his cap and rising, " there's nothing in five hundred miles, no, nor in a thousand, to make us anxious with such a race-course as lies afore us. 'Tain't as if we'd got to to catch the craft before ehe'd made Madeira." fie paused, looking a little irresolute, and then said, addressing Wilfrid, "I don't know if-there's anything more your honour would like to ask of me 1" "No, not for the moment," answered my cousin dully, with the air of a man languid with a sudden sense of weariness or exhaustion following some internal fiery perturbation ; "it is just this, Finn. Mr. Monson served in the Royal Navy for a few years, and I was anxious that he should be at once made acquainted with your .views so that he and you could combine your experiences. You have chased in your time, Charles, no doubt ? " "Not very often, and then always something that was iii sight," I answered with a s&ght; glance at Finn, whose gaze instantly fell whilst he exclaimed: "Well, sir, any suggestion you can ] make I'll be mighty thankful to receive, j But it'll be all plain sailing, I don't doubt; it'll be all plain sailing," he repeated, rumbling out the words in a stifled hurri- ' cane note, and, giving us a bow, lie went up the steps. Wilfrid gazed at me vacantly when I proposed a cigar on deck. "What do you think of Finn?" he aslr<*H. "He seems as honest a man and as practical a seaman as needs be. But lie has had command of this yacht since you bought her ? " nodded. "Well, then, of course you know all about him. He has clearly been a merchant Jack in his day, and has all necessary experience, I daresay, to qualify him for this charge. But, I say, Wilfrid, let us go on deck, my dear fellow. Miss Jennings, I am sure, will not object to the scent of a cigar in the open air." "Nor down here either," she exclaimed. " I shall remember that," said I gratefully. " Now, Wilfrid, won't you—? " " No," he interrupted; " I am drowsy, and thank Heaven for a sensation that threatens to become a novelty. If I get no rest to-night it will be my eighth of sleeplessness, and I must humour myself; yes, I must humour myself," he repeated, talking in a sort of muttering way, and rising. I advised him by all means to withdraw if he really felt tired, and further recommended a boatswain's caulker of whiskey to top off the champagne and port he had been swallowing. "How will you amuse yourself, Laura?" he exclaimed, turning to her. " It will be dull work for you, I fear." " No, no," cried I blithely, " why need Miss Jennings be dull 7 It must be our business to keep her lively." " I can sit and read here," said she, " till it is time to go to bed. What is the hour, Mr. Monson ? " " Just on the stroke of eight," said I. She made a pretty little grimace, and then burst into one of her refreshing cordial laughs. " A little early for bed, Wilfrid," she exclaimed. He smothered a yawn and responded : " I will leave you to Charles. Would to heaven I had his spirits. God bless you both—good night. He rang for his valet and stalked with hanging arms and drooping head, in the most melancholic manner picturable, to his cabin. I asked Miss Jennings to accompany me on deck. "There is a moon in the air," said I; " you may see the haze of it through this porthole ; but I must not forget that it is an autumn night, so let me beg you to wrap yourself up warmly whilst I slip on a pea-coat." I fancied she hung in the wind an instant, as a girl might who could not promptly see her way to walking the deck of a yacht alone with a young man on a moonlight or any other night, but she assented so quickly in reality that I daresay mysuspicionwas an idle and groundless bit of sensitiveness. Five minutes later w« wftre on rlop.V hwetWr. The yacht was floating through the dusk —that was tinctured into glimmering pearl by the broad face of silver moon which had already climbed several degrees above the black sky-line of the Isle of Wight—without the least perceptible stir or tremor in her frame. The wind was well abaft the starboard beam; the great main boom overhung the port quarter; the white Bail rose wan to the moonshine with a large gaff topsail above it—for those were the days of gaffe—dim\x=req-\ ming into a space of airy faintness to the masthead, above the white button of whose truck you caught the icy gleam of a metal vane as though it was a piece of meteoric scoring under the dust of the stars that hovered in the velvet gloom like a sheet of undulating silver glooming out into hollows in places. Light as the breeze was, and following us besides, it held the canvas asleep ; but that every cloud-like cloth was doing its work, too, the ear quickly noted in the pleasant fountain-like sounds of running waters over the side, with a cool seething noise in the wake and a fairy tinkling of exploding foam-bells. The land to port loomed black against the moonshine, save where some slope or other catching the slanting beam showed the faint green of its herbage or wooded growths in a very phantasm of hue, like some verdant stretch of land dyeing an attenuated veil of vapour witnessed afar upon the ocean. Over the port bow I caught sight of a light or two a long way down the dusky reach, as it seemed, with a brighter gleam to starboard where the land, catching the moonlight, came in visionary streaks and breaks to abeam and on passed the quarter where it seemed to melt out into some twinkling beacon — off Calshot Castle, maybe, so far astern it looked. I spied the sturdy figure of the mate standing beside the wheel, no longer steering, but manifestly conning the yacht. The skipper was abreast of the skylight, leaning over the rail with his arm round a backstay; there were figures moving forward tipping the gloom there with the scarlet points of glowing bowls of tobacco, but if they conversed it was in whispers. The stillness was scarce imaginable. It was heightened yet even to my fancy presently when, growing used to the light I spied the phantom figure of what was apparently a large brig clouded to her royals with pale canvas stemming the Solent outward bound some half a mile distant. " There is no dew," said I; " the moon sliines purely, and is full of promise so far as fine weather goes. Well! here we are fairly started indeed. It is almost a dream to mo, Miss Jennings, d'ye know?" I continued, staring about me. "Three days ago I had no notice of anything having gone wrong with my cousin, and therefore little dreamt, as you will suppose, of what I was to enter upon this blessed afternoon. Three days ago ! And how here am I heading into God knows what part of this mighty globe of oceans as empty of all theory of destination as though I were bound in a balloon to the part the poets call intersteller space. How Is it all to end, I wonder ? " She was pacing quietly by my side. "You think the pursuit a silly one, Mr. Monson ? " " Yes,. I do, and Wilfrid knows that I do. If he were not— he is my cousin, Miss Jennings, and a dear Mend, and you are his sister-in-law and deaf to him, too, I am sure, and so I dare to be candid with you—if it were not that he—" I touched my forehead : " would he embark on such a quest as this ? " " Yes," she replied, with just enough of heat or temper, or whatever you like to call it, in her voice to render her utterance distinct with unconscious emphasis. " He adored his wife. Can a man tear his lore into pieces in a day, as though it were no more than a tedious old letter f He; thinks he hates her; he does so in a sense, no doubt; but in a sense, too, he~still worships her. Mad! that is what you mean." I was beginning to protest. " Yes, it is what you mean, and you arc right and wrong. If he does not pursue her, if he does not recover her, she is lost for ever ; she is lost now, you will tell me. Ay," she cried with a little stamp, "lost so far as her husband's heart goes, so far as her honour is concerned; but not so utterly lost as she will later be if she is not rescued from that—that man, who must be so served, Mr. Monson, as to render it impossible for him ever again to trouble the peace of another home, to break the heart of a noble-minded creature and rob a little infant of its mother. Hate him! Oh, girl as I amJ X declare before my Maker i would shoot him with my own hand 1" There was nothing in the least degree theatrical in her way of speaking. Tlje words came in a hurry to her lips from her indignant heart, and I heard the sincerity of them so clearly in the mere utterance, I did not doubt for an instant that, put a pistol in her hand and set up the figure of the colonel in front of her, she would have sought for his heart, if he had one, with the barrel of the weapon without so much as a sigh at having to kill him. 1 felt abashed; her sincerity and resentment were overwhelming; her strength of feeling, too, won a peculiar accentuation from the character of airy delicacy, of tender fragility, the moon\x=req-\ light.gave to her fair and golden beauty. It was like listening to a volume of sounds poured forth by a singing bird, and wondering that such far-reaching melody should be produced by so small a creature. "I fear," said I, "you don't think me very sincere in my sympathy with Wilfrid—" "Oil, yes, Mr. Monson," she interrupted ; " do not suppose each a thing. It is not to be imagined that you should take this cruel and miserable affair to heart as he does, or feel it as I do, who am her sister." " The truth is," said I, "it is impossible for a bachelor not to take a cynical view of troubles of this sort. A m«.n was charged with the murder of his sweetheart. The judge said to him, 'Had the woman been your wife, your guilt would not hare been so great, because you would have no other means of getting rid of her save by frilling her ; but the unhappy creature whose throat you cut you could have sent adrift without trouble.' What I mean to say is, Miss Jennings, that a husband does not merit half the pity that is felt for him if his wife elopes. He is easily quit of a woman who is his wife only by name. I am for pitying her. The inevitable sequel, the disgrace, desertion, and the rest of it is as punctual as the indications of the hand of a clock. ... But see how nimbly the Bride floats through all this darkness and quietude. We snail be passing that vessel shortly, and yet for canvas she might really be one of the pyramids of Egypt towing down Channel." We went to the rail to look, I, for one, glad enough to change the subject, for it was nothing less than profanity to be aijguing with so sweet a little woman as this—in the pure white shining of the moon, too, and with something of an ocean freshness of atmosphere all about us —on such a gangrenous subject as the elopement of Lady Monson with Colonel Hope-Kennedy. Out of all my sea- going experiences I could not pick a fairer picture than was made by the brig we were passing, clad as she was in moonlight, and rising in steam-coloured spaces to mere films of royals motionless under the stars. She was a man-of- war; the white of her broad band, that was broken by black ports, gleamed like the ivory of pianoforte keys; her canvas was exquisitely cut and set, and trimmed as naval men know how—one yardarm looking backwards a little over another, the rounded silent cloths, faint in the radiance with a gleam as of alabaster showing through a delicate haze, and high aloft the tremor of a pennant like the expiring trail of a shooting star. All was as hushed as death upon her; her high bulwarks concealed her decks ; nothing was to be seen stirring along the whole length of the shapely, beautiful, visionary fabric that, as we left her slowly veering away upon our quarter, looked to lose the substance of her form, as though through the gradual absorption of the light her own white canvas made by the clear and icy radiance of the soaring moon. "To think now," said I, "of the thunder of adamantine lips concealed within the silence of that heap of swimming fainfcness! How amazing the change from the exquisite repose she suggests to the fierce crimson blaze and headlong detonations of a broadside flashing up the dark land and dying out miles away in a sullen roar. But d'ye know, Miss Jennings, I shall grow poetical if I do not light another cigar. Women should encourage men to smoke. Nothing keeps them quieter." We exchanged a few -words with Captain Finn, who, together with the mate, was keeping a bright look-out, and then resumed our walk, and, in a quiet chat that was ended only by a small bell on the forecastle announcing the hour oi ten by four chimes, Miss Laura gave me the story of my cousin's introduction into her family, described the marriage, talked to me about Melbourne apd her home there, with more to the same purpose, all very interesting to me, though it -would make the merest parish gossip in print. Her mother was dead; her father was a hearty man of sixty who had emigrated years before in dire poverty, " as you will Bap\x=req-\ pose," said she, " when I tell you that he -was the son of a dissenting minister who had a family of twelve children, and who died without leaving money enough to pay for his funeral." Mr. Jennings had made a fortune by squatting, but he had lost a considerable sum within the past few years by stupid speculation, and as Mis3 Laura said this I could see, by hearing her (to use a Paddyism), the pout of her lip ; for, bright as the moonlight was, the silver of it blended with the golden tint of her hair without defining any feature of her clearly, saving her eyes, in which the beam of the planet would sparkle like a diamond -whenever she raised them to my face. She told me her father -was very proud that his daughter should become a lady of title, and yet he opposed Hie marriage, too. In short, he saw that Wilfrid's mind wets not as sound as it should be, though he never could point to any act or speech. to justify his migivingB. But this was intelligible enough; for, to apeak of my cousin as I rememt>ered him in earlier times, the notion you got that he was-not straight\x=req-\ headed, as I have-before said, was from his face, and the suspicion lay hut dully in one, so rational was Mb behaviour, so polished and often intellectual his talk, till on a sudden it was sharpened into conviction on your hearing that there was insanity in mother's family "What had Lady Monson to say to your father's misgivings 1" 1 inquired\x=req-\ "She accepted him, and insisted upon marrying him. He was wonderfully fond of her, Mr. Monson." "And she?" I saw her give her head a little shake, but she made no reply. Perhaps she considered 'that this trip we had started ,on sufficiently answered the question. She said, after a brief pause, "I myself thought my father agreat deal too critical in his estimate of Sir Wilfrid. No one talked more delightfully than your cousin. He was a favourite with everybody whom he met at Melbourne. He was fresh from Ilia travels, and was full of entertaining stories and shrewd observations; and then, again, he had much to say about European capitals, of English university life, of English society—you will not need me to tell you that we colonials have little weaknesses in regard to lords and ladies and to the doings of high life, from which people in England are quite exempt, and for the having which I fear we are slightly sneered at and a good deal wondered at. I caught the sparkle of her lifted eye. "And pray, Miss Jennings," said I, " what would your papa ttiinV if lie -were to know that you had embarked on what, I must still take the liberty of calling, a very queer voyage ? " "Oh, she cried quickly and almost hysterically, "don't ask me what he would think of what I am doing! What will be his thoughts when he gets the news of what Henrietta has done f" She turned her head away from me, and kept it averted long enough to make me suspect that there was a tear in her eye. It was then that a sailor forward struck the forecastle bell four times. '' Ten o'clock 1" she exclaimed, knowing as an ocean traveller how to interpret sea time. " Good night, Mr. Monson." I handed her down the companion-steps, and went to my own cabin, and was presently in my bunk. But it was after seven bells, half-past eleven, before I fell asleep.
