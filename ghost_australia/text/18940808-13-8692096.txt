On the gold-fields were to be seen all manner of men Professional men. clerks, and mechanics. The accounts which appeared in The Argus allowed what struggles were made by men in Coolgardie, and if the same enterprise was shown on our own gold-fields the development would be something wonderful. The Government thought they made an offer to the milly ay employer., that had good feeling in it, but if it was not accepted in that spirit The Government did nothing more to about it. What the Government asked hon. members to do, having decided this motion, was to proceed to business as quickly as possible, to adjust matters to the satisfaction of the people, that the Government might be able to give encouragement to the great industries of the country, that they might help prospectors, the village settlers, and others, deal with legislation to give the holders of the mallee 1 proper title, and pass through the other House the bill to give cheap money to the people. He believed (he rising generation would set a good example and would not for (he school indolent enjoyment under their honour and integrity to be challenged in any direction whatever The great question was the adjustment of the Imnncea, not the life of a Government. It was not worth while prolonging this debate. The simple object of the Government was to make the two sides of the ledger balance The Government had no particular Hanns on this House-, which was elected under the auspices of the leader of the Opposition, but they had to acknowledge the loyalty and splendid support they have received from hon. members on the Government side of the House and from many on the other side, the, Government would not give up the recommendations of the Lands Commission, though they were not indisposed to give up the 10 per cent duties. He thought he had now made the position of the Government very dear. (Opposition laughter.) All that the Government desired was to run me on these benches to carry out their promises to the country, and for the rest he left the matter to the committee. (Cheers ) Mr. DIXON wished to know when he could move his amendment that some items only of the Budget proposals were unsatisfactory. The CHAIRMAN said the hon. member could propose lela amendment on the amendment of the leader of the Opposition, in the former would have to be disposal of first Sir GRAHAM BERRY, who was received with Opposition cheers, thought the committee had never listened to a more extraordinary speech than that of the Premier. If the Brenner concluded with a cundill with dr peal of the Budget the business might be gone on with in a more satisfactory manner. The leader of the Opposition allowed to what extent the Budget was objectionable, but the Premier dealt with only one point.

When he said that the hon. member for Normanby had never informed him, there was a cry of " wild Irishman " (Laughter ) Well, he might be a wild Irishman, but once, when the wild Irishman became Treasurer, on July 11, there was a debut of £10,000, and before February 14, without borrowing one shilling, he had paid off every penny.

According to the protectionist doctrine, however, printing paper would become a helper if a duty were placed upon it. It had been urged that the Government should try to throw as few persons as possible out of work, and the Minister of Lands had enabled many people to earn a living on the land, while many others had been employed in mining The Government had no desire to press hard upon any cause whatever, and it was for the House to decide what duties should be imposed 'The largest sources of a venue m nil Budgets were wines, spirits. and tobacco, but the increased duties placed upon these articles by the previous Government had defeated their own ends, and greatly lessened the revenue In three years from 600,000 to £300,000 had been lost to the revenue through those increased duties The increase in duties had also greatly increased the illicit distillation and the production of spirits injurious to health and also to the interests of the revenue One illicit distillery alone which was discovered was estimated to have caused a loss or £30,000 to the Customs revenue The hon. member for Normanby) thought that he was going to put the Government into a hole and compel them to stand to the Budget, but he had defeated his own object through his over anxiety.

Mr. THEN WITH The Government had not carried out the proposals of the Tariff Board in regard to the duty on glassware. That ned) reported in favour of a duty of 20 per cent. ad valorem on glassware that could not be made here, but the Ministry had made the reduction applicable to the one hundred and one articles of glassware that were manufactured in the colony. If the Government venn ted money to make both ends meet it should tax the wealthy by I increasing the income tax. In New Zealand the wealthy classes had been taxed and the engines of the public servants i increased, with the result that last year there was a surplus instead of a lifebelt. He congratulated the Government upon the carding any assumption of backbone. It was always believed that this backbone had an existence, but the Premier had given it up tonight.
