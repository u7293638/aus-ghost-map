THE SPIRITS' MOUNTAIN. ! (FROM THE SPANISH OF GUSTAVE ADOLPH BECHER. "Fasten the dogs, blow the horn to call the huntsmen together, and let us take a turn around the city." "Night is approaching; it is All Souls' Day, and we are on the Spirits' Mountain." "So soon !" " If it were any other day but this I would not give up hunting that pack of wolves, which the snows of Moncayo have driven from their dens, but it is impossible to-day. They will soon call to prayers at the monastery of the Knights Templar, and the bells will commence to toll for the dead in the chapel of the mountain." " In that ruined chapel ? Bah, you wish to frighten me ! " " No, my lovely cousin ; but you are not aware of all that has occurred in this country, for it is only a year since you came back. Slacken your horse's pace, and I will tell you a story." The pages were gathered in merry groups ; the Counts of Borges and Ahirdiel were mounted on magnificent steeds, and they rode behind their son and daughter, Alonso and Beatriz, who kept on at some distance ahead of the cavalcade. Alonso went on as follows - "This mountain, which is now called the Spirits' Mountain, formerly belonged to the Knights Templar, who were warlike monks After bona had been conquered from the Moors, the king sent for the Templary to come from a distant land to defend the city on the side next to the bridge, thus wound ing the feelings of the nobility of Castile, who, as they had conquered the city, were capable of defending it without any outside help Therefore the knights of that new and powerful religious order and the noblemen of the city were on bad terms for several years, and finally) this feeling deepened to a pro- found hatred "The Templars had this part of the moon rain set aside as a preserve for game to satisfy their wants and contribute to their pleasure , while the nobles determined to organise a grand hunt in the inclosure, in spite of the severe prohibitions of the monks with spurs -as the) at) led their enemies The news spread fast, but the noblemen determined to carry out their purpose, though they knew that the Knights 'Templar intended, if no. sible, to put a stop to their sport The e . pedition was carried out, and they did not once think of the game, for the) fought with one another, and man a poor mother had to mourn the loss of her son Instead of a hunt, there was a frightful battle , the mountain was strewn with corpses, and the wolves they had desired to exterminate enjoyed a bloody feast "II mall) the king interfered, and commanded that the mountain, the cause of so much misfortune, should be abandoned So the monks chapel situated on the mountain, and wherein friends and enemies were buried together, gradually) fell into ruins But ever since, on All Souls' Eve, the chapel bell tolls for the dead and the ghosts, enveloped in their shrouds, roam around through the woods and bushes, as though engaged in a fantastic hunting expedition The deer II) before them bleating with fear, the serpents hiss fearful!), and on the following day the footprints of the fleshless ghosts are seen on the snow Therefore in Soria we call it the Spirits Mountain, and for that reason I have thought best to leave it before night soul ' Alonso finished his story) just as the two by camp people reached the end of the bridge i which extends to the city on the other side They waited for the rest of the cavalcade to join them, and all entered together the warm dark streets of Sofia The servants had just cleared the table, and a bright fire was playing in the Gothic fireplace, shedding its glow on several groups of ladies and gentlemen who were talking around the hearth, while the wind beat against the windows Only two persons did not take part in the general conversation, Beatriz and Alonso Beatriz was watching the flickering flames, absorbed in her own thoughts, while Alonso was gazing admir- ingly at her blue eyes. Both have been silent for some time. The old women are telling blood curdling stories about ghosts and spirits, while the church bells of bona I were waiting for the dead with a sad and doleful sound "My lovely cousin" finally exclaimed Alonzo, breaking the deep silence, "we are soon to separate, perhaps for ever you do not like the and placing of Castile, its severe and warlike customs, its simple, patriarchal habits, I know full well I have heard you sigh set evil times, and perhaps it is for some lover you have left in your far off home ' Beatriz made a gesture of indifference, and her disposition was revealed in the scornful curl of her lip Perhaps by du are sighing for the pomps of the French court, where you have lived up to the present time, the young master hastened to say. -"-Anyway I foresee that I shall soon lose you and when we separate, I would like to have you carry away a remembrance of me Do you remember when we went to church to give thanks to God for having restored your health, which you came to seek here The jewel that fastened the plume in my cap attracted ) our attention How well it would look in your dark hair, confining your veil It has already been used for that purpose by a bride for my father gave it to my mother, and she wore it to the altar would like to have it" " I do not know how it is in your country, but in mine, if one receives a present, it 13 binding Only on a holiday can one receive a present from a relative less he can even go to Rome, without coming back with empty hands the scornful tone in which Beatriz pronounced these words disturbed the young man a little, but finally recovering himself, he said in a sad tone -" I am aware of it, cousin , but to day is All Saints Day, and your name day as well as that of others so it is a fitting time to receive gifts, I assure you Will you accept this from me' ' Beatm slightly bit her lip and extended her hand to take the jewel, without say mg a word The two young people again remained silent, though the old women's voices could be heard as they went on talking about witches and ghosts, while the howling of the wind as it shook the easements and the tolling of the bells still continued After a few minutes Alonso proceeded - " Before the and on All Saints Day, which is my name day as well as yours, you may give me a present without compromising yourself Will you not do so urgedAlonao, fixing Ina I eyes on his cousin's, winch gleamed brightly as a diabolical thought flashed through her mind "Why not' she exclaimed, carrying her hand to her right shoulder, us though seek- ing for something amid the folds of her wide vclvetsleeve embroidered with cold Then, with a childish air of disappointment, she added " " Do you recollect the blue ribbon I were to day) on the hunting expedition, and which you said was the emblem of your soul on account of its colour '" "Yea I do Well, I have lost it I have lost it, and I wanted to give it to you as a souvenir " " Where was it lost?' inquired Alonso, raising himself in his seat, with an in- describable expression of mingled fear and hope " I do not know , perhaps on the mountain " " On the Spirits' Mountain ' ' he murmured, turning pale, and throwing himself back in his chair, on the spirits' Mountain ' " Then he went on in a harsh, trembling tone "You know, for you have heard everybody say so Emu s without number that are called the king of huntsmen throughout Castile As I have not yet been able to try my strength in battle, as my ancestors have done, I have exerted, in that pastime of war like sport, all the hereditary ardour of in) race and all the strength of which I am possessed The mat under your feet is the skin of a wild animal I slew with my own hands I know its haunts and its habits, I have fought against them day and night, on foot and on horse back, alone and together with other hunts men and nobody can say never shrank from danger at any time On any other night I would fly to bring you that ribbon, and would do so joyfully but tonight, is, to night-w h) should I hide it from you '-I am afraid Do you not hear the bells tolled-'' the hour for evening prayer has struck at San 1 min del Due to the ghosts begin to emerge from their graves, curdling the blood of anyone who beholds them turning his hair (is), or dragging him off in the whirl of then fantastic dance, as a leaf is swept along by the breen An almost imperceptible smile curled Beira? s lips while the young; man was talking and she exclaimed in an indifferent tone after he ceased, meanwhile stirring the fire so that the bright sparks flew out, ' Oh, no indeed How silly ' Dont think of going to the mountain after such a trifle I On such a dark night too when the ghosts are ubrou 1 and the road is full of wolvi s ' As she spoke these last words, she emphasised think so that Alonso could not fail to understand her bitter iron) As though mechanically he rose passed his hand over his forehead as though to dispel the fear he felt mentally), but not in his heart, and in a firm tone he said, addressing the beautiful girl who was still amusing herself by stirring the fire on the hearth, ' Farewell, Beating, farewell li I return it will be soon " Alonso, Alonso,' she said, turning around rapidly , but when she desired to detain him or appeared to do so, the young man had already disappeared Soon after the sound of his horse's hoofs was heard as he galloped off The proud beauty, with a radiant look of gratified vanity lighting up her face, listened attentively) to the sound until died away, though the church bells kept on their lugubrious telling. An hour, two, and three elapsed and mid- night struck as Beatm retired! to her oratory ; but Alonso had not returned yet, though he had had plenty of time to go and come back. " Perhaps he was afraid the young girl exclaimed, closing her prayer book offer family endeavouring to murmur some of the prayers the Church dedicates to All Souls' Day for the spirits of those that have passed away. After putting out the lump, and drawing the silk curtains around her bed, Bite fell asleep. But her sleep was restless and uneasy. The postern clock struck 12, and Beatriz could hear its slow, sod strokes and half opened her eyes She thought that she heard someone call her at the same time in a faint, suffering accent. The wind still married and shook the casement " It must be the wind," she said, putting her hand to her heart and trying to calm her self. But her heart kept on beating wildly. The doors of the oratory creaked noisily on their hinges First one and then all the doors that opened into her apartment were opened, and closed with a harsh, sad sound, like a deep groan, setting her nerves on edge. Then a silence ensued, a silence full of strange sounds, the silence of mid night. There was a dull murmur of dis that water, the barking of dogs in the distance, confused tones, unintelligible words, and echoes of footsteps coming and going. Then followed the rustling of_tr_-hiiR garments, hall suppressed sighs, and the laboured breathing which one feels, with in- voluntary shudders, announces the presence of something that cannot he seen, though its approach is felt in the darkness The Uru, trembling, thrust her head out from the curtains and listened for a moment. She could hear man) strange sounds, but passing her hand over her brow, she listened again, out all was now still and quiet Her pupils were dilated, and she seemed to see shapes moving around all over the room; but as she fixed her eyes more closely she perceived that the darkness was impenetrable and it was due to her imagination "Bah she said, resting her lovely) head again upon the pillow, ' can I be as timid as those poor BOUIS whose hearts beat with terror under their armour on hearing some ghost story *"' So, closing her eyes, she tried to go to sleep, but in vain did she endeavour to calm herself She again started up, pale, uneasy, and more terrified than ever This time it was no illusion the brocade portions over the door had rushed as they were pushed aside, and she could hear heavy footsteps on the carpet. 'His sound they made was dull and almost imperceptible, but continuous, and as they moved along she could hear something croaking, like dr) wood or bones The footfalls drew nearer and nearer, and the prayer desk near her bed moved Beitn. uttered a sharp cry, and burying herself under the clothes, had her head and held her breath The wind beat against the casement, while the monotonous flow of the mountain could be heard from afar, and the barking of dogs, as well as the church bells of bona, some near, some further off, while they sadly tolled for the dead 'J bus the night passed on, and to Beatriz it seemed as though it would never come to an end I made), the first faint rays of dawn lighted up the sky, and she opened her eyes and recovered her self possession After a sleepless night of terror, how beautiful seems tim bright, clear morning light She drew back the curtains of her bed, and was about to laugh at her terror of the previous night, when suddenly a cold. perspiration broke out on her forehead, her eyes seemed starting from their sockets, and a deadly pallor overspread her cheeks for of her prayer desk she beheld the blue ribbon stained with blood, the blue ribbon Alonso had gone in quest of When the frightened attendants rushed in to inform her of the death of Alonso- the first-born of the Count of Alardicl-whose body, partly devoured by the wolves, had been found on the Spirits' Mountain, they found Beatriz motionless and rigid, clinging with both hands to the ebony bed- posts, her eyes starting from their sockets, her mouth half opened, her lips ye bite, and her body cold and still, for she was dead. Beatriz had died of fright They say that some time after this event took place a huntsman who had lost his way, and been obliged to pass All Souls'] «e on the Spirits' Mountain, told on the day before ne me of some of the Horrible sights he had seen there. Among other things he said that he had seen the fleshless bodies of the ancient Knights Templar and the bona noblemen that were buried in the chapel, on the stroke of twelve, arise from their graves with a terrible clamour, and, mounted on their skelPtou steeds, w still pursue a beautiful woman, who-pale, with dishevelled locks, and her feet bare and bleeding was roaming around the unfortunate Alonsos tomb with wild and fearful ones
