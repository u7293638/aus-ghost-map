Although the weather was much more inviting; than on Thursdny, there was a con- siderable falling-off to witness the wind-up of two days' excellent coursing. With the addi- tion of a couple ot made-up stakes, a total of 30 courses was provided ior the commence- ment nt 1 o'clock, and the card was run through without any hitch by 4 o'clock. Tho trials were perhups a shade inferior to the opening day, but on the whole this must be ranked as the best meeting ever held at Moonee Valley. Mr. Mon- tague Smith's Mny Flower, another of the irrepressible Rebellion-Westeria family, fairly romped through the Victoria Stakes, whilst Glitter went very smartly to the end of the Plumpton Stakes. The task set Waiwcra II. to win the Xgurveno Stakes was a very easy one. as she exhibited marked superiority of pace over euch of her op- ponents. Melfort Shade, the winner of the Winter Stakes, is a vastly improved puppy, and will yet be successful in a more pieten tious stake. Dundie Dinmont was fully de- serving of the ltailway Stakes, though a good word should be given to the veteran Helene, who ran us gamely and as truly as she did in her first season, lleport, the declared winner 'of the Vineyard Stakes, fell in for a stroke of luck, through lloxelana disabling herself in ' the previous round. Hallucination and Home won the two udded stakes with no trouble, both making one-sided shows of their oppo- nents. Mr. Woods got through his judicial labours to-day" in a generally satisfactory mnnner, whilst the slipping of Bignell was a creditable feature of the meeting, the con- cluding details of which are appended : VICTORIA STARKS.-Second Ties.-Solon having been drawn, Chevy Chaso ran a short bye, in vvhloh bo was led and decisively beaten. May Flower toole a lorn? lead Irom Glcndubb, and only once allowed him to roora lu a trial of averago length. Deciding Course.-May Flower outpaced Cliovy Chaso from end to end ol a pretty long trial. _ sUTO.v SrAkna.-Second Tica.-Glitter and Governess made a splendid race to tho hare, and tho latter, through alight favour, gained tbe first point Very soon tbo haro cut behind the canvas, vvboro Glitter must havo been vory busy to win, as Go- verness bad tho best of tbo last fow jioints outside. Panic and Ta Ta raced ucck-and-ncek together, till tbo former shot up on the outside for a moiitorious open- ing, but subsequently ho took very little jurt-in tbo spin, and waa well beaten. DcoliUnjc Courso.-Glitter just secured tho turn ifroill Ta Ta, and hailjonly a baro majority, when a short ruutiing baro waa chopped bctwocn them. No.vuvkM) STAKKS.-First Tlos-Princess Beattico secured lint honours from Welcome on tbo inside, but was outworked in a civc-and-tako courso. Wal wera li. drew past Ada in a long raco to tbo baro, and bad a good bolauco in hand wben the baro escaped. Deciding Courso.-Waiwera II. drew out from Web come, timed, oxcbangcü, and cut tho spiu short with a wrench and kill. WiKTim STAKES.-First Tics.-Ethel drew away irom Gratitude, and was also a bit tilo clovcrcr. Mot fort Shado ran round about Miss O'Conuor, and wound up with a good kill, the latter being incapable of any effort, so It sccincd. I Deciding Course.-Mcllort Sitado led Ethel four or flvo lengths, and wound up a very ono-sided afluir by racing Into her game. lt.vn.vv.vY STAMM.-First Tlos_Pencil tool: n long lead from Helene; but after tbo turn looked on, leaving tho old bitch to do pretty well everything in a trial of uuusual severity. Dandla Dinmont made a great example ot Silver King, who scarcely ever tried. Dociding Course-Dandio Dinmont led Helene for a long acoro, which a capital finish and smart kill on tbo part of tho old ono was a long way Irom balancing. Vi.MiY.vriD STAKES.-First Tic».-lleport outpaced Lulu, and scored a very easy win to covert, lloxe- lana led Hoffnung thrco lengths, and bad a good majority when thoy cannoned, and tho first-naniod being completely Bottled, Hoffnung was lett to drive tbp haro to covort Dookling Uound.-Roxclana having been drawn disabled, Report waa declared tbo winner.
