The Governor in Danger, Tho poor (-lovoruor is no sooner out of tho frying-pan than ho is into tho fire, BooauBo ho did nob invlto tho Moderator of tho Prea.\ bytorlan Aosombly and tho President of tho Methodists to tho table on Queen's Birth day, tho mombors of Uioho bodies aro in open robollion, Talk of bho troiiHon and dis loyalty of tho',' Irish, it is roally doplorablo wo know, bub tho Irish novor showed dis rospoab to tho Quoon'fl roprosontativo, If tho ProflbytorlanH and Wosloyans aro nob guilty of rank troaaon wo don't know what to nay, A telegram from Maoloan In Wed* noaday'a papers says i 'It transpires that tho Presbyterians nncl Woslayans of tho town have doaldod to abstain from ontor baining' bhe Governor as a protest against his rooenb insult to the Moderator of tho Presbyterian Assembly and the President of the Wesleyan Conference As moat of the prominent oitizens belong to the above bodies, it was deoided to abandon the idea of any demonstration of welcome, and ar rangements were accordingly canoollod. The mattor has given rise to muoh oon broversy, this being the only oooasion bhab a visit of the Queon's reprosen babive has boon ignored by bho disbriob.' If the Irish had behaved in this way why bho Kiama ghost would walk ovor tho land, and tho Minister for Education would seo that Irishmen in tho Oivil Service were closely watched. The Governor, too, would be aooompaniod by troops, It is question able if his life will be safe during tho northern trip, for when the Woaleyans and Preabyteriana turn they may be muoh worse than the terrible Fenians or the Italian anarohists, Ib may bo some consolation to tbo Governor to know that even if he hus to fall at tho hand of a Wosleyan Nihilist he will not bo asked to eat an indigestible dinner and drink oheap champagne at Maoloan,
