SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB. CUP DAY. Saturday. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT) The second day’s raciag at Flemington, in con nection with the South Australian, jockey Club, passed off with marked success The attendance must have proved gratifying to the committee, and those. present were, contrary toexpeota*’ tions, favored with fine weather. The. racing was good,' especially in the Cap, which -was won by Lord Wilton in fine style, who, notwithstand ing that Conjecture, Britisher, and Lantern wore such warm favorites, carried a good' -deal' of pnhlio' money. Thera is something uncanny about rape dreams,’ especially as they are aS a rule first .related aftertha event, bat one came.under my notice a few days since out.; of the general, run. A racing patron during the . week dreamt that Lord Wilton -won the Cup. and on the strength of this backed him. This be made known. before the race was known, and ‘- therefore may be- accepted as correct. - The’ Selling Hurdle- Race was a failure, as-it only resulted' in a.walk over for Fusilier.
