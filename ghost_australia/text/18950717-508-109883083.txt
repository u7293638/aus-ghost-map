Political Flour Bags. A CASE IN COURT. A lad named Edward Stanley was brought -up at the Central Police Court this morning on a charge of riotous behavior. It appeared from the evidence of Travers, the arresting constable, that his attention was at tracted to Stanley last night by seeing Mm running down Albion-street, and presenting an almost ghost-like ap pearance. On apprehension and ex amination it was found that tlie boy was covered with flour, two paper bags of which he was also carrying. Two political meetings (Dr. Graham's and another) were going on in. Al bion-street about this time, and the police, inference was that the youth 'had been getting up a flour demon stration at one or other of the gather ings. Stanley, however, denied to the constable and the court having any political convictions. He ac counted for his appearance by saying other boys had thrown flour over him, and that he had picked up the bags of flour in the street The beneh ob served that no doubt there -would be plenty of flour thrown about next week. Meanwhile the lad was cau tioned to keep away from political meetings till he could become a can didate, and the case against' him was dismissed.
