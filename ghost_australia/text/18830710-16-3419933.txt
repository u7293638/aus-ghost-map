¿». THE HOUSE OF WHITE SHADOWS* BY B. L. FARJEON, Author of " Blade-o-grass." " Joshua Marvel," "Bread and Cheese and Kisses, "Grif" "Lon- don's Heart," &c.; CHATER I. THE ARRIVAL OF THE ADVOCATE. GENEVA was in a state of feverish excitement. Not in the memory of living man had a trial taken place in which the interest manifested had been so absorbing. " What news from the Court House?" "How many days more is it likely to last?" " What will the verdict bo ?'' Were questions which men and women asked freely of each other. In every grade of society, from the highest to the lowest, in fashionable assemblies, and in the cafés where the people drank their lager and red wine, in clubs and workshops, on steamboats and diligences, in the fields aud vineyards, the trial of Gautran was the foremost subject in every person's mind, and formed the principal topic of con- versation and debate. So animated were the discussions that the girl lying in her grave might have been supposed to be closely related to half the inhabitants of Geneva instead of having been, as she was, a comparative stranger in the town, with no claim upon any living Genevese on the score of kinship. The evidence against the prisoner was overwhelming, and it appeared as if a spirit of personal hatred had guided its preparation. With deadly patience and skill the prosecuting counsel blocked up every loophole of escape ; Gautran was fast in the meshes ; and it was observed that the Advo- cate, in his examination of the witnesses brought forward by the prosecution, elicited precisely the kind of evidence that to the minds of those who listened to him now for the first time strengthened the case against the man he was defending. It was to those obser- vers as though he shared the general horror of Gautran's crime, and lind undertaken tho defence for the solo purpose of ensuring a con- viction. But in the minds of others, who had some knowledge of the Advocate's marvellous resources, this very circumstance inspired tho gravest doubts as to the result of the trial. Instances wore cited in which this remarkable mau had seemed to play so directly into tho hands of kis antagonists that they regarded defeat as impossible, and in which by the exorcise of his inscrutable powers he had led them craftily into an ambush whore, by a start- ling and wholly unexpected movement, ho had as it were by a miracle-at thesuprome moment snatched victory from their grasp. And it galled them to discover, when it was too late to repair their error, that ho had so blinded their judgment as to compel them to contribute largely to their own discomfiture. It was in the acknowledgment of those extraordinary powers that the doubt arose whether, in the case of Gautran, the prisoner would slip through the hands of justice. . The owitcment had become so intense that it had spread from the ancient and ordinarily peaceful toual to other and greater towns and cities, all the world over, the columns of whose newspapers teemed with telegraphic despatches of the pro- gress of the trial. Special correspondents and artists were busily employed in noting and sketching every picturesque feature of tho pro- ceedings that alfordod a subject for illustration by pen or pencil. It was impossible, with⁢ favour or influence, to obtain admission to the court ; and could scats have boen purchased, a higher price would willingly have been paid for them than the most celebrated actress orjjWmu donna could have commanded. Murders are common enough, but this crime had feverishly stirred the heart of the community, and the unwonted excitement it caused was duo, strangely enough, not so much to the murder itself as to an accidental connection which im- parted to it an extraordinary interest. The victim was a young girl named Made- line, seventeen years of age. Until a few months before her cruel and untimely und she had boen a stranger in the neighbourhood, and nothing was known of tho story of her life. When she first appeared in the suburbs of Geneva she was accompanied by a woman older than herself, and «two facts became immedi diately apparent-that a strong attachment existed between the new-comers, and that they . wore very poor. This last circumstance was in itself a sufficient indication that they belonged to the lower classes. The name of the elder of the women was Pauline. That they chose to be known by those names, Madeline and Pauline, was not considered singular by those with whom they consorted ; as they presented themselves so they wore accepted ; and, although at first a natural curi- osity was evinced concerning their history, nothing was gathered from thom which threw light upon it. Some said tho women came from the mountains, somo from the plains; but this was guesswork. Their dress did not proclaim their canton, and they brought nothing with thom to betray thom. They hired a room in a poor cottage for three francs a month, and paid the first month's rent in advance, and the woman who received the money was correct in her surmise-that it constituted nearly the whole of their wealth. For three or four days they did nothing, and then their choice of avo- cation was made. They sold Howers in the streets and cafés of Geneva, and gained a scanty living thereby, but poor as it was they ap- peared contented with it. The woman with whom they lived said she never heard a dis- satisfied word from either of thom, and that she was surprised they did not make a deal of money because of Madeline's beauty. Had Pauline traded alone it is more than likely that failure would have attended her, for, although she was both comely and straight made, there was always in the streets a cloud upon ker face, and she did not either have the power, or would not take the trouble, to make herself agreeable. It was otherwise with Madeline, in whose young life nature's fairest season was opening, and it would have been strange indeed if her smiling face and winning manner had not attracted custom. Admiration pursued her not only from those in her own station but from some who occupied * higher, and many an insidious proposal was whispered in her car whose poisonous flattery would have beguiled her to ker ruin. If she had not had in Pauline a staunch and devoted protector it is hard to say whether she could have resisted temptation, for her nature was singularly gentío and confiding; but her faithful companion, upon whom compliments and flattery were alike wasted, was ever on the alert, and no man could deal with Madeline without reckoning with Pauline. She guarded Madeline as a mother guards her young, and their affection for each other had grown almost into a proverb. Certainly no harm could befal the young flower girl while Pauline was near. But a day arrived when the elder woman was called away for a while ; and they parted with tears and kisses-never to meet again. Among those whom Madeline's beauty had attracted, was a man in her own station in life-Gautran, a woodman, who by some means had obtaiued an influence over her, and who assumed a license, permitted to no other, to associate with her. That his companionship was distasteful to her could not be doubted, but lie was not to bo shaken oif, and his known ferocity of character deterred others from approaching the girl when he was present. Many times had ho been heard to say, "Made- line belongs to mo ; let me see who is bold enough to dispute it." And, again and again, that it would be an evil hour for the man who «topped between him and the woman he loved. Even Pauline was loth to anger him, tkougk when he and Madeline were seen together people would say, "There go the wolf and the lamb. . This wretch it was who stood accused of the murder of the pretty flower girl. Her body had been found in the river .Rhone, with marks of violence upon it, and a handkerchief tightly twisted round its neck. The proofs of a cruel murder were incon tcstible, and suspicion fell immediately upon Gautran, who was the last person known to be in Madeline's company. Evidence of the guilt was soon forthcoming. After Pauline's depar- ture Madeline had expressed to companions her fears that, in consequence of her refusal to marry him, he would one day do her a mischief. According to their statement he had urged her to go to the priest with him while Pauline was absent. He was madly, brutally, in love with her; and niadly, brutally, jealous of her. On the night of the murder they had been seen walking together on tho bank of the river ; high words were heard to pass between them; the man's exclamation, "I will kill you! I will kill you!" was sworn to by wit- nesses ; and the handkerchief round her neck f ÏÎÎP sole l''S"t of publication in Queensland 1 the House of White Shadows" has been jUrchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company, belonged to lum A thousand damning details wcie swiftly accumulated, all pointing to tho wi etch's guilt, and tho ov ldcnce was so com plete and ciushing that ho was doomed by the public voico before hewastned It was will tot lum that he did not fill into the hands ui the populate So incensed wcio thej against linn that thej would have torn lum to piecia But, while he lay in pnson awaiting tlio daj ofNtu 1, theie ai lived m Geneva au adv o cato of unown, who had tiavellcd thithei with his witc in sundi of much needed íepose fiom yeais of mental toil His plijsieums, fcairn' that he would bleak down in health, ana knowing tint he would notspaio himself, had impel ativ ely insisted that he should letne awhile fioin Ina pi ofcosional duties, and lie had reluetantlj consented to obey them lins in in was famous in uianj couutues, he was an mdc fatigablc mid eai neat u oikci, and so nupoitant woie Ins sen tecs deemed that phenomenal fees vve.i ficqucntlv pud to seeuie thom But, iiofciutlist aiding that his time was moie v ilu ible th in that of anj othei mumbel of Ins proftisiou, lie hid boon know n to i of u elaine sums of money in cases offered to him so that he nii¿ht devote himself to those which hold out no prospect of peeuniaiy low u d We ilthj, and held in almost exnggciatul ia"eem, it » ia conhdentlj piedicted that tin highest lionoiu» of the State wcio in .store foi lum in I it vi is ungi iidgiiigly admitted that tin loutit it oihee would bo dignified by association w lth his name The position he had attained was duo as much to his intense enthusiasm in the cuise he championed as to bia vvondious capacity foi leading it to vietoij As leider of i foiloin hope ho was unrivalled Ho had in nisitiable appetite for obstacles, ci munni iiiscs of gi e it moment, in which life was m imminent pel ii, and m which theie was a dukiujsterj tobe solved possessed an mosistiblefaseinition for him The moie mtricato the task, the closer his studv, of it j tho deepei tho mjstcij, the gieater his patience in the unravelling of it, the more powerful the odds against lum, the lughci Ins comale and thokeinci his desire to win the buttle His micioscopic penetrating mind ditected the minutest llaw, seued the smallest detail likelj to be of advantage to lura, and frequently fiom the moat ti mai tin ead hi had spun a stiond so stiongasto diagthe skiff that w is falling to piecca to a safe and sonne haven His satisfaction it these aelnevcmciits was unbounded, but ho rarelj llloiicd an cxpiession of exultation to escupe lum His outwaid tianquillitv, oven in supiemc cusca, wis astonishing His nene was of iron, and to his most nitininte associates his lnnir life w as a sealed book Accompanied by his w lfe, the Adv ocate en teied Geneva, and alighted at the Hotel de la Metí opole, foui d13 a befoie that on which the trial of Gautian was to commence CIIAPILH II J\COB 11 un mau, TUL BIMO.II, on ES HIS 1U VsONs 10K Bl-LILA INO UlUIKAJ», Till AVOOint VA, GU1L11 OF 1UC UU1UM.H "I JHOiosi,' saul the Advocate to Ins wife, when thej weio shown into a pnvite 100m, " unless jou wish to staj 111 Geneva for a day 01 two to stai t foi Petit Saiconnox tina after noon ' lucie is nothing new to ho seen heie," said the beautiful vi oin 111 who stood before lum, his lunioi by moie til 111 tw enty j eai s, " and I am dyin¿ to take possession of Mi Baloombc's v illa I Inv e been thinking of nothing else for the hist wick " C iptiv it d bj the strange name it bears " "l'eiliap'- liie Houso of White Shadows!
