BRANCHES FROM THE MAIL ? . ROUTES. AMONG ITALIAN " LIONS." BT j. if. I had reached Italy too late for the Carnival It it as saddening thus to miss that great night of absurdities so well seen at Naples, better at Rome, but best at Florence That much I learn from Bartolo, my zealous guide, who comes to take me on a fine Sunday morning from Naples to Portia, to see there the great religious fete of St Cyrus He tells me, for comfort, that it will be nearly as big a show as the Carnival It had this additional attraction to that end, and to making it a crowded and extra grand affair it was the hat of the religious rites of which the Government intended to allow the celebra- tion in this quarter of Italy There is a sad satisfaction of seeing the list of any thing Such is chief of the interest found in reading the Last of the Mohicans, or Campbell s " Last Man I otherwise er penenced the feeling in looking at a caged bird I once sow exhibited and labelled as the last aptcrjx-which, on a visit afterwards to New Zealand I found it was not I had in past days seen the last London Bartholomew Tur and should probably take similar interest in this last of the sides of St Cyrus The Government of united and reformed Italy would it was thought, abolish the Carnival next It has long since set all the clocks to 12 in place of 24 hours time, and there is no limit to reform Portici lies four miles or so from Naples, over a lay a paved road flanked with houses on either side for the whole way Beyond it lies the half buried Herculaneum, and it is the nearest road by which to reach Vesuvius to the righthand the backs of the houses look towards the bay, but no water views are to be had on the thickly built road, advt in which a tramway is now being laid-a satisfactory thing indeed to of those who dislike the it cruelty to animals for which Italians are very blame able 'they have a two wheeled street car drawn by one horse, on to and about which fifteen or more people are often crowded Other part of such brutality is to be seen in their fish markets-the way they cut steaks off a live turtle being a particularly sickening sight, and as bad as the Japanese side dish of slices of live fish 'life houses all along this road to Portia are built of lava blocks I read 'villa on one side of their doorways, and " Garcia or " Cardom, or some other vowel finished name, on the other Such, I believe, designate the proprietors The Montagues and the Capulets so named their houses, and there is many a waiting Juliet to be seen here in the ever present balconies, which on this occa- Biou are all garlanded with flowers for the vi whole distance of this four mile long road there are triumphal arches well built up, thickly festooned with floral offerings, and hung with oil lamps for evening lighting Paintings and transparencies are set lavishly on a great many of these arches Of such erections I counted, from Naples to Portici, no less than two hundred from arch to arch ran strings of lamps on crescent shaped wires, all alike thickly covered with flowers Everything was well done, and in good taste There was nothing about it of gingerbread gliding and tinsel, and it differed from all theatrical shorts in looking as well by daylight as by lamplight At equal distances between each triumphal arch stood what I may call a firework trophy wooden poles, with cross-pieces on the top, upon which the pyrotechnics had hung his best efforts in wonderful variety I failed to see two that were decorated alike It was vexing to observe so much that had to be passed in its present state of that there was no chance of seeing when the time of its transformation came There was no point of view from which the whole four miles of pretty fantastical fancies could be seen at a glance Carriage travelling on this road was restricted to a very narrow part The rest of it was denied oil and the stone like paving decorated with chalked devices like a ball room floor As Portici was neared the railway decoration is varied by such devices being laid down in flowers in place of child and it Portici itself all these preparations ran to i held that little suburb was smothered in decorations 'The church of St Cyrus in whose honour this he ttas_iven,was covered inside and out with flowers transparencies and illuminating lamps of all colours How so much was done so quickly as to allow of all the flowers looking so fresh was not readily understandable All illuminations and all preparations for such seen by me in various places at different times were as nothing to those it this he of St Cyrus Bartolo explains some why this sort is so honoured He is the patron aunt of Portion the Pimlico of Naples Ilia prayers, while he lived, saved the place once from the plague, and always from the eruption of Vesuvius He is supposed, Birtolo says, to continue such intercessions in another place, and to propitiate his good offices, he is, once a year, honoured in the manner now shown The Sidewalks are lined thickly with onlookers all the way from Naples, who was as I do to see the procession pass It comes at last muchmtheBtyloof arresters or Oddfellows celebration, or still more like that of the combined eight hour artisans out for their anniversary holiday Hundreds of priests and other ecclesiastics are in full canonicals interspersed with choir boys all in white and in full chant intermixed with these are those who carry church emblems emblazoned on banners in old accustomed procession fashion Priestly scouts are everywhere about with the plate, by which one is reminded strongly that a clerical and not a lay business is afoot Midway in this procession, which took more than two hours to pass me, came six priests who carried platforms their shoulders surmounted by a canopy of black velvet In the centre stood Saint Cyrus in effigy and wax- work His arms are crossed on his breast and a gilded metal disc of large size stands out around his head to represent that aureole with which even such a modern painter as Port still surrounds saintly heads At every tenth house on the long journey this figure is brought to a standstill, and then saluted with handfuls and basketful of flowers from out the balconies To that end the platform was every now and then turned from side to side that the devotees might look upon the face of the figure Such fervour did this exhibition create that many of the fair occupants of the balconies were in an by stencil state of sobbing over it I called Bartolo s attention to that but found him differently affected, and that he vented his feeling only in jocularity to give it no harsher term He is one of the unruly song of the church Vesuvius may well be the terror of Naples That Herculaneum and neighbouring Pompeii that are just handy to me here testify to its power Portici, that IS partly built over Herculaneum may well pray St Cyrus or any other Bart to protect it from like fate On the bridge I crossed coming hither from Naples stands a stone figure of St Januarius, who is believed to protect that capital from the fiery monster of a mountain, similarly as St Cyrus preserved Portici January, is represented with an arm and hand stretched out towards Vesuvius, forbidding its lava and cinders to come that way But few that pass believe but what he so says destruction from the city Bartolo remembers apropos of this that it is May, and one of the eight days of that month on which the miracle of the liquefaction of the blood of this saint is to be seen. To fill up time until the lamps shall be lighted for the grand illumination hereabout we drive back to the city, and find our way to the finest of its cathedrals that of St Gennaro, as the name of St Januarius is here modernised On the way thither I cell with my spokes manataamall chapelmabjostreets radar to some of the old churches hidden away in the back streets of the city of London In this old building are to be seen some veritable wonders of Italian sculptor workmanship The chapel contains the tombs of two princely families Bartolo has well calculated on the surprise in store for the visitor, for here in marble lies a female figure, completely en- vi loped in a richly worked veil, that one might swear was of finest lace I try in vain to raise it to convince my bewildered eyes that it is not part of the marble of the figure that it entries which it is so very difficult to believe If it cost a lifetime to perfect such a work the result here shown looks worth such labour Here also is to be seen in marble the figure of one as lately deceased, covered by a sheet apparently adhering to it by the damp sweets of death I find myself w ordering back next day, when supposed to be dining, to have a long look all alone at these two figures So to express it, they get hold of one, and in that sense I bring them away with me, and with them also much enlarged ideas of the sculptors at the cathedral of the great Neapolitan saint is found to be greatly crowded, and has been so since early morning. It is now high noon, and the miracle is expected to take place momentarily The majority of those in the stilling crowd are women, whose eyes are mostly red with weeping Each one has bet particular need for which she his prayed to the expected spirit of the saint that by its coming is believed to cause the liquefaction of the blood But those special prayers are not the ones which I now hear all of the crowd repeating These are those of the ritual, and the buzz? of the multitude thus praying fills one's ears 'The murmur of such an assemblage so heard was something novel I have heard the charity children of London singing at St Pauls, but a quite different effect was produced by the praying of this mass of the people At that other miracle of the appearance every Easter of the fire from out of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem the fanatical crowd crush each other in their endeavours to light their candles at the flame In this Neapolitan miracle the object of believers is to kiss one of the two points in which the liquefied blood is carried around by the priests That takes place inside the balustrades to which the devotees have been crowding since early morning, thereby securing all the benefit of those who get front seats at shows It is easy to see that those now here in such crowds are of the lower orders, and though Italians, are not more successful in repressing the expression of their feelings than are those of their class elsewhere A loud buzz, like to a suppressed about, fills the church as announcing that the miracle has taken place The phials are 111 time brought round, and are turned continually to show the thoroughly liquid state of their contents After that follows the procession of the statue of the saint, and the exhibition of the holy relics pertaining to him Following thereon comes that collection to which I subscribe as readily as any of the crow d It has been to me a sight well worth paying for, and one that I could not have otherwise believed as possible in the nine teenth century I turn to the only one with whom, for want of language, I can exchange a word " You took no part in this, and made no offering Birtolo' As he was that " Oh, I have been here before , it was new to you, but I come every time expecting it may be the last How do you mean me to understand that "Well, you will see the last of Naples re ligious ties to day, and next year this exhibition may perhaps be suppressed A many good Catholics think that it ought to be, and I am one of them Returning to Portici while there is yet time to get through the crowd, I go with my day nurse for much needed refreshment to a neighbouring restaurant, that has, I find, a sort of tea gardens at the back running down to the bay side LTidden behind the clumps of buildings facing the road, it was quite a pleasant surprise in this suburban resort folks were taking coffee or wine in the harbours all round Wine has here the general call as being light and cheap I think that I here had the finest fish that I ever tasted, also some of the nicest of bread and bottle of very palatable drink, which with butter, sauces, and attendance were in- cluded all for the equivalent of a shilling and threepence And then the attendants ' What shall I say of these nice Italian girls who are all trace, and seem to move only to music When I had looked all the thanks I could to them, I began to understand some of the trouble of any departed Scotch New Zealander It was impossible to BIJ anything to a girl through a guide least to say any of the pretty things that one should say I don't think that I had before sy sympathised sufficiently with my friends trouble, but had been too busy to think of this particular phase of it. The confusion of tongues has stopped more things than the building of Babel It stopped my northern friends further travel and all little intended flirtations I could understand now how he chafed at having, as he phrased it, to filter and funnel out his meanings through others lips Here were Juliet's in plenty if one could only play Romeo by proxy It was evening when we got again through the thickened crowd into Portici M orders had been since done in the way of rapidly lighting the lamps That seemingly impossible work had been effected as quickly as the equally impossible looking one of sorting in two hours the mountain of letters that appears every evening at six p m in the large hall of St Martin 's le Grand It is really astounding what can be done when it must be done Portici and its Church of St Cyrus were a sight in the way of illumination never to be forgotten' The long road thence into Naples, far as the eye could follow it, looked as the road to a world of light it could be seen also to all the better effect from the hill on which Portici stands The interior of the Church of St Cyrus, in which the waxen figure of the saint was now prominently elevated and illuminated, was too giddy, too crowded, and far too hot with thousands of lamps, to be stayed in for long, though it took up a good half hour to squeeze through to its centre We are often quickly satisfied in this way with other things to which we take great trouble to get Plea sure consists mostly in the struggle to attain that which is found to be little worth the toil Moralising is quite proper in a church, but hardly in this blazing one of fat Cyrus, and in an atmosphere of over 100deg From seven to twelve p.m. we stayed about here in the grandest of shows of fire and fire w Greta The latter began to fix, sparkle, and explode at about nine o clock, and with their commencement all the other grandeur appeared to be wound up and to pass away as a scroll The bright lamps were dimmed in the brighter splendour, and the troops rencieaseemedbutmere daubs-which.indeed, they were not for the art of the firework maker I never had till now proper respect, but here, where fireworks are an aid and illustrator to faith, the artist becomes, as he should be, sublime' In coloured fires the Italian pj rotechnist stands first Their effect illuminated, in many colours, all the houses around and the upturned faces of the immense crowd The profane Bartolo look? J. yellow, blue, pink, green and white by turns, and etseemedall through asunedifiedasever To be religiously coloured all over in many tints does some folks no more good than being "brayed a mortar,' of the inefficacy of which singular mode of dealing with fools we are told by Solomon No carnival show could well have presented a more novel sight than did that long road of lighted lamps, illuminated pictures, flowers, and fireworks, all the long four miles from Portici to Naples The stillness of the atmosphere and the beauty of the evening had much to do with it, but the master hand of the practical artist and manager was visible in every thing The ability of the church to manage temporal affairs, as until lately the case at Rome, was here well illustrated As manager of fetes, pro cub lions, and illuminations it had shown nothing wanting in this one I did not remember until afterwards, that the exciting influence of music had been omitted There were artistic reasons for that omission, no doubt, in this land of music and song 11 at it was not wanted was well shown, perhaps, in my not missing it. On this bright at tiling the assemblages of fair Italians that crowded the balconies added every) thing was ting to a scene that I fear I shall never see the like of, perhaps, all the better if I should not, as this last fete of St Cyrus will remain as a choice reme distance of something not to be duplicated The next of the Italian " lions visited is old Palestrina Baalbec of a place, famous for its ruins, as likewise for its double roses It lies some little distance from Naples, but has the advantage of a railway to Salerno and Battipngha, or three fourths of the way to it. The rest is but a short journey by road in the form of grand rains Paestum is more Egyptian than Italian, regarding the massive character of that which is here to be seen Bartolo provides some sandwiches and Ltchrjma Christi, as refreshments are not procurable at Paestum as they are at Baalbec It has another likeness to Baalbec beyond its ruins, in this-that but little or nothing is correctly known of its early history, and also in its having passed through the hands of many owners Saracens, Lombards, Greeks, Romans, and Normans are known one after the other to have found Paestum to be a mistake, and as such to have deserted it The blunder was one not to be repaired, as the site chosen for this city had been a radically unhealthy) one In that way it proved a poisonous possession, and killed its conquerors A malarious atmosphere, similar to that of the Campagna, or country surrounding Home has so done its pestilent work that Paestum has been left, as it now is, to the owl, the jackal, and the bat that, with tarantulaBpfdcrs, vipers, and scorpions, infest the brushwood that grows around, and will some day grow over the old ruins It is not worth while to the mere visitor, not an antiquarian, to make long stay at Paestum An hour or so by sunset among its stones gives the idea of it required, and leaves impressions quite vivid enough for the traveller who has, like to my self, come to it from eastward, and therefore seen its prototypes elsewhere Beached, as it is by most of its visitors, from the westward, it would appear as a much grander show of ruins-the grandest that, up to this part, a traveller through Europe could see Paestum has been going to ruins for some two thousand years A few cultivators of the soil have endeavoured to live about the place, but the malarious nature of it is visible in their appearance Their sickly faces tell one that they are vainly struggling against the laws of nature that have doomed Paestum to desola- tion as they are similarly doing to Rome The remains of walls, as at Baalbec, are here existing, and the city seems to have been of simUarsmallsize Gatewajsfaced the four points of the compass, dividing the city, life Jerusalem, into four quarters-that one to the east being a standing gateway still The Temple of Neptune takes here the place that the Temple of the Sun does at Baalbec A good model of it has been placed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham It is some two hundred feet in length, and seen by the evening sun, its thirty six mas- sue Doric columns have a yellowish red tint, and the whole building an impressive, memorable appearance These columns, as also sixteen interior ones, have not been disturbed, like to those at old Baalbec, by earthquakes, and until thrown down by such influence seem likely to stand here until that dispersion of all things called the cr tck of doom There is another ruined temple known, Bartolo says, as the Basilica, that is second only to that of Neptune It is not so massive in its character but more striking in architecture, showing many novelties not seen elsewhere Its fifty columns have capitals that are not copied from others That one lingers longer at this building than at the others is because that we act only as we are influenced, and that there is something here that detains one-w rich something was the secret of the architect We might often wonder what it is that keeps our gaze at the picture that is before us, turns one back to look again at the figure that has just passed, or of the face of which but a glance was to be had It is of this indefinable something that is in us that the best of nature s works and those of the highest art, and they come very near each other, take hold, and when they do so they hold one at their will. The spirit that is in things without, breathed into them by nature or genius, speaks to the spirit that is within us If there be nothing within that understands the language, then are we soul less indeed, and the heavens and the earth and all that is within them have been for us created in vain A good glance at the whole of these ruins of Paestum can be had from the remains of the ramparts, especially from a tower that is still standing on one eminence The traveller will there look on the blackening stones, to which the Betting sun gives darker shadows, with a weird effect The earlier history of the scene can be made for himself by each one that looks upon it Nothing of it can be told us, and as nothing I call those names that give one no ideas, such as Pelasgiana and Lucanions, which are mixed up with its beginning Why this little malarious city on the banks of the shallow Sat so was such a favourite with the great nations of the past we will never be known to very runs were up visited and unheard of until the middle of the last century To look at its remains among the jungle in which they are is to get sad impressions, and to come away in thoughtful mood In a forgetful one also, for I forgot to inquire about the double roses for which Paestum had a name There is no place that is less suggestive of roses or mere likely to put their thought out of one s mind than are these blackening bones now remain- ing of the skeleton that was once Paestum It is smoothest water next day in the Bay of Naples, and Bartolo suggests taking advantage of it by visiting Capri, a picturesque rock, conspicuous as a cloud only far away in the entrance to the bay This Capri has many curios of grottos that can be only entered in such smooth water as that of this afternoon, and of its ruins are to be seen something of the many villas of Tiberius One of the steam launches that are always darting about the bay takes us according to the Piccola Manner, one of the two land- ing places to the mountain, environed by limestone cliffs, that constitutes Capri It is, I am told, so named after the goods, that are the only things gifted with legs and endowed with jumping power that can get over all its rocky intricacies Over two thousand people, however, manage to live at Capri-the larger part by fishing, and others by cultivating olives, and growing the grapes that make the wine by which Capri, aided by its coloured grottos, has got a name in the story The place is a sort of Jersey in its way, and has many permanent residents who choose it for its quietude, sunny situation, and sea breezes Such are excuses only for its greater attraction of cheap living for the more transitory traveller there are several small hotels and a seaside boardinghouse kept by an Englishwoman whose name sounds strangely place among its Italian surroundings Names, however, are like faces, and cannot be all pretty. As a romance of the story of this rock Bar- told tells me that early in the century Capri belonged to England, and that under the governorship of Sir Hudson Lowe, afterwards Bonaparte's gaoler at St Helena, it was made a minor Gibraltar Such was all to no purpose, however, for Bartolo has the bad taste to add that the French general Lamarque, by a bravery imitated from the British, took it by assault from England s hands That little mishap of 1803 and some other matters were, however, rectified and accounts afterwards squared with the French in the events of 1815 The charm of Capri culminates in its caves of all colours, the most attractive of which is that known as the Blue Grotto To that I now go, after a long look from the heights at a view that embraces all that can be seen of distant Naples and the surroundings of its day In that view the eye fingers for a long look at sunny Sorrento, and is loth to leave a sight of far stretching beauty that makes one wish to be a bird, and so to see such delights at will Among perpendicular and most picturesque cliffs the boatmen find the entrance to the Blue Grotto So near to the water is it, that I have to lie back in the boat to pass through it Inside I find myself in one of the Sea Kings finest halls, with a vaulted roof to which no cathedral can show the equal Although it is neave There is no want of that light which here shows what wonders it can do The water that was green outside has here a frosted alla cr surface that makes the finest of flooring All above and around is of that most heavenly blue print from which this cavern has taken its name If Venus ever rose from the sea tiny island, and not Cyprus, was the likeliest spot for her landing place On a pearly throne, centrally situated in this grotto, she would have appeared quite in place, surrounded by a few sirens and maiden mermaids-by which expression youthful ones will be understood All that I see here is of nature s magic The little daylight visible at the low arched door way of this Gothic cathedral of the sea seems to be a yellowish colour One of our boat men IIOB a great surprise in store For a small fee he dives beneath the water of the interior, and while beneath it appears of the whiteness supposed to be worn by sheeted ghosts On his head emerging and remaining above the water, it looks as quite black He seems to be a white man with a negro s face One not unnaturally, after all this novelty, expects next to see Undine, Lurline or other spirit of the waters, come upon the scene to inquire why we have thus paddled into her parlour-for such might be the Blue Grotto of Capri Other reason for connecting this island of Capri and its grottos with the sea bom Venus is the prettiness of its girls These fishermen's daughters look nice indeed, for their dark eyes, olive complexions and fine figures, though they work as men labourers do elsewhere I see them carrying loads, and a party of four engaged in building a rubble wall I would talk with the one mixing mortar, a charming creature, but as Language fails we make up for it by shaking hands Hers is a hard hand, certainly, but yet small and with the neatest of fingers, all finished off with Gilbert nails Adding the fine feathers, here was a belief that would have graced any ballroom, working, barefooted, at brick laying '
