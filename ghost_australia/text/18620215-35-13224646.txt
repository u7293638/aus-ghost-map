THE BARBER'S GHOST. BY DUDLEY COSTELLO. THERE had so long been a succession of English families at the Chateau de Fleunal, that the old gardener, who was a fixture there had managed to pick up a good deal of the language he so constantly heard, and was able to speak it intelligibly He did not, accordingly, negleU his acquirements, but whenever he had an opportunity, which was often enough, would talk with the servants, and tell them strange stones of the place, till at length he succeeded in fairly convincing them that the house was haunted It may readily be believed that those who heard these stones did not keep them to themselves secret keeping is not the habit of their class The children learnt them new whispers, and the w whispers spread till they reached the ears of Mr. and Mrs M'Granite, strong minded persons both, but not altogether inaccessible to superstition They, of course, dis- couraged all such "idle slavers,' but say what they pleased, they could not prevent an uncomfortable feeling, a sense of something " uncanny from prevailing, of which they had their share Nothing, however, in the shape of personal experience had chanced to confirm the rumoured ghostly visitation, and Mr M'Granite had far too much worldly wisdom to think, like his predecessors, of shifting his ground before he was actually invaded "Let's has nee mair of' this nonsense," he said, somewhat angrily, when the subject was broached by the fireside, one dark October evening, b> Sandy," the eldest of the red-haired tribe, "let have nee mair of this daft nonsense about long bearded spasms, and Turks, and Calmucks, and Scotch barbers, and the Lord knows what ' Gang till yer beds every one o' ye, and mud that I dunno come round with' a birch twig to fright ye in good earnest'" Let no one say that that was at the bottom of this abrupt dismissal, though Mr. M'Granite fully appreciated the advantage of not wasting fire and candle let us rather set it to the right accounts laudable desire to keep the courage of his family, by throwing contempt upon all supernatural manifestations Domestic affairs, into which it is not necessary to enter, had so arrange the internal economy of the Chateau de Fleurval, that Mr M'Granite slept alone, aloof from the partner of his bosom. His bedchamber, a large oblong room, was situated on the first floor, at the foot of the turret that flanked the western extremity of the building mention of which has already been made there was a door of communication between this room and the turret, but it had not been opened since the M'Eranttes came to the chateau, and was generally supposed to be barred; outside, as well as bolted and locked within Mr M'Granite, therefore, always went to look as calmly as the old white owl Hulot, he was called-that occupied the dilapidated tenement over- head. Mr M'Gramte's bedchamber, though large and lofty, was not a cheerful looking place The windows, of which there were two at each end, were curtainless and bare, the posie of blue china, with its long tubular chimney that ran up to the ceiling and disappeared through the wall, was suggestive of cold rather than heat for it never held a fire The parquet consisted, not of polished wood, but of dull red ties, and not an inch of carpet kept the feet from their chilly contact, as to the bed, it was high and broad, and asked of aspect, hangings having been thought a superfluity The furniture of the room corresponded with the rest of the apartment-an old Auteuil of faded yellow velvet, and three or four chairs to match, being all it contained I forget, there was also by the bed- head a small table de main, on which Mr M'Granite set his candle while he prepared for his couch, on the night that witnessed the stem ejectment of his offspring from the salon, but three or four hours later, Mr M'Granite withdrew to rest as usual He had previously OLCU pied himself with a book, selecting one from his scanty library that treated of the topography and antiquities of his own part of Scotland, partly for the entertainment are always found it it often as he had read it through and partly to distract his thoughts from local objects The book was in his hand even after he went to bed, but he did not read long ; the cold made him shiver He put out the light, buried his head beneath the clothes, and very soon was fast asleep, making quite as much noise as old Hulot, but in a different key. It is all very well to pull the bed- clothes over your head, but the thing is to keep them there This apparently, Mr M Granite was not able to do, for, cold as he was when he lay down, he woke up absolutely starved, with not a particle of covering over him save the garment he slept in It was no accidental displacement, the counterpane, blanket, and sheet had been literally stripped off, and were tossed in a heap over the foot of the bed To his astonishment, the light, which he had put out, was burning, and, to his greater astonishment, there stood at his bedside a figure at least six feet high, with small blue eyes, that glared like those of a hyena, and a long white beard that reached to its middle The costume of the figure was also remarkable On its head it were a flat velvet cap of some dark colour, a loose white linen jacket attired its upper half, black cashmere breeches and grey stockings arrayed its mother extremities, its feet were thrust into heelless slippers and at its waist dangled a long white apron, with an enormous pocket in front, from which projected the handles of various instruments In its larger bony hands it held in the left a soap dish, in the right a shaving brush, Mr M'Granite took in all these objects at a glance , indeed, he had not time for more, as the moment he opened his eyes the figure addressed him in words which, though smacking of this native tongue, had in them something of a foreign accent " Ye'll be wanting a shave in the morn," said the figure, with a flourish of the brush towards him, " Get up, man, and set yersel doon in yon chair. I'se handle yes Mr M'Granite was, for a few seconds, utterly bewildered Was the legend true, then, which Sandy had poured into his brothers and sisters ears, about the Scotch barber s ghost, and all the rest of it Was be to be the phantom's victim, to be shaved against his will, and beaten afterwards The figure seemed capable of exercising both functions He looked a master of his craft, and his stature and length of limb were formidable Was what he saw a reality, or only a disagreeable dreams Further con- jecture was not permitted him, for the figure, in a voice of thunder, and in Lowland Scotch of the broadest and most profane, bade him " bunker doors " in the arm-chair, and tuck the napkin about him, which he drew from his capacious pocket and flung in Mr. M'Granite'B face. "Her waters scarce in these parts," said the figure, gathering Mr M'Gramte's countenance with fearful velocity. "It's ave letter what I can frae mair's the piece'" The application seemed, in fact, as cold as ice, and Mr M'Gramte's jaws rattled like a pair of nutcrackers. Bide Hill," said the figure, "I'll get ye street before as done !" Out came the garnering steel, hastily it was dropped on one horny hand, the next moment Mr M'Granite's nose was wrung with a vigorous weak, and then, with lightning flashes, the razor skin med his cheeks-up.strokes, down-strokes, side strokes, back strokes, all were executed with a ex tent that Mr M'Granite might have dwelt upon as marvellous, if the whole affair had not been the most marvellous thing that had ever befallen him It seemed less like the ordinary process of shaving than an effect of electricity, done, as it were, in the twink- ling of aneje Mr M'Granite, it must be owned, would gladly have prolonged this part of the transac- tion, for he gave a shrewd guess at what was to for few He trembled in every limb, and when the figure told him to stand up, he could hardly keep his legs But, instead of committing the fell assault he dreaded, the figure glided into the chair which he had just quitted, and diving again into the large pocket, drew forth an enormous pair of scissors, which he held out towards Mr M'Granite " Can we have a body - ' demanded the figure Luckily Mr. M'Granite was a Scotchman, and interpreted the vernacular correctly "The muckle devil himself could not do it better," he replied " My certe," said the figure, but ye're a j bauld and Clip away, and spare not and with a nod of its head, the Figure jerked its head into Mr M'Granite s hand He set to in good earnest last as snow flakes fell the long, white, waving hairs, till nothing but a close-set stubble was left Then he ground in the soap like a housemaid scouring a door- step deep amidst the furrows ploughed the shaving brush, and, with all the muscular action he could command, sawed away amongst the bristles as if he were a backwoodsmen making a clearing " Deil hBe me'' said the figure, " but that's past praying for-ye re a case) could be handle a razor waist as well as I do my self You'll no belong to the profession r" Mr M'Granite replied in the negative " It 's an ancient and an honourable one," said the Figure, thoughtfully. "We were aje called barber surgeons in my time- not sheers . What are ye, morir' "A Scotsman," returned Mr. M'Gtanite "I kept that by your tongue," said the Figure "From what part of Scotland " " My native place is Dunfermline," said Mr M Granite " And mine," said the Figure, " is Juicau'dy ' Dell's in me, but we're members ' Are any of the Family o' Pickup still live' r " "My wife, Janet Kickuo, is the last of her race" "Ye dinner say save ' Gives your hand, mon include s tmcKcr man was , just in me by the -ss" for this, I'm thinkin' " The 1 igureseized Mr M'Granite's hand, and squcezeditull the bones cracked again When it was at length released, the figure stroked its own chin, apparently with great satisfaction I never thocht, it said, " that the day will come when I should be free o' my beardie ' Lang, lang, has I I watched and waited morn) is the card I have shaved miser, but devil a one till now has had the courage to tackle wi me A wheen daft bodies, staring' and goggles when I speak to them, as if they could not understand But I raddled their bones for em . Ech, sirs, but 1 keck je about like soothe s , ye cannot see he did not get your farm' .' The Figure laughed loudly, as it recalled the punishment inflicted on the previous occupants of the chamber, and Mr J M Granite began to quake again there is the need for j e to shiver, mon ' A ve broken the spell I'm clean shaved, recht through wit, and now in going back to my grave, and sleep in peace ' But I ve aye a story to tell so set yerself down and listen" Mr, M'Granite did as he was commanded, and the Figure proceeded -" My name, when I lived the flesh, was Dsvie Pickup. I was first valet and barber to thearle committee We were out in the Teftecn, and said had been in the Forty five, but my lord he believed to have a bad he or' the gout the di) the Chevalier left for Scotland, and he could as follow him The Fort) five's an auld tale noo, and je 11 may be had heardaneuch o't, moreover, it has aspirin' to do so huz Well, my lord Tommietool he lived in great state here in this Chateau de Fleur - Val Ech, sirs, but there were rare doings in those days ' the rules of Bordeaux and Nantz we emptied might have floated the English navy And the womankind, and the dancing', and feasting' and pleasure \- but as John Knox, the worthy man, used to say of a sic like vanities, it could not last Whiles it did, the we d a gay time o't, and Madame Esme, she was a Turkish lady, sat in' my lord, ye ken, what ye queen it away like Madame Pompeydoor herself The precious stones that glittered on Madame Lsme's dress were worth a king's ransom, but their glitter was just darkness to the light that shone in heree But my lord's green, and she's gone, and a the abbe's, and markisses, and officers, and fine ladies, they're a' gaen-and what they're going to 1 needn't to say ' Madame Esme, she died of a fever, and the Earl o' Tommie- tool, he died of drink, grieving' for her loss The night my lord went, I sat by his bedside, and received his latest breath But a little before the last gasp hed been silent for some time he raised lam- bell up, and said -"Dixie, my man he aye ca done Davie-" ye've shave me hundreds of times" "Yes, my lord, says I, "and I hope to shave je hundreds mair " " \e 11 not do that, Davie," says he, " ye 11 never shave me but ance, and that will be when a cold and dead " "Ye manna speak o' deem', my lord," says I " Ay, Davie, but I mann, ' says he. And then my lord gave a deep groan. Presently he spoke again-" Davis." says my lord, "you and I have been great sinners I'm thinkin' we'll burn for't " " Speak for yersel, my lord," says I, " I've had great fancy for burning' '" " then ye 11 freeze," says he " May be no' that either my lord," says I, rather settled to think that a deem' man, as he was, should dispose of my soul as if it had been his am " Then I'll tell ye what, Davie," cries he in a passion, " if it s the last word I have to say, yes- hear it, if ye winna burn nor freeze, ye shall stay here, barber as ye are, shaving' folks to all eternity, till your beards as long as my arm, and never a quiet night shall ye see in your grave till we meet wi somebody bauld speech to take je by the snout and mark ye look like a Christian, Davie <" " And HI' this, in a huff, my lord turned his face to the w a and never turned it back again. It was a fair thing, that the words of a man who had led sic a life as the art of 1 committees should come true, but so it was and here, for a hundred years and many, have I been shaving', shaving', shave and if it had na been for a on, Mr M Granite,-I ken your name by twly, here I should have stayed, as my lord said, to all eternity But I've a grateful mind, Mr. M'Granite, and I have the means of recompensing your kindness I made a pretty penny in the service of the Earl o' louimietoul I was a saving' body, and put by the waist o't Draw nigh, Mr M'Granite, till I whisper in your lug " What the figure said to Mr M'Granite, nobody ever knew, save him to whom it was told , but in moments of conviviality, when the whisky toddy had gone its rounds- after is return to Dun furniture, with all his affairs happily settled-Mr. M'Granite has often told the story of how he once shaved a ghost, though nobody could ever make out whether he was in jest or earnest THE COI»FEPEIU.TK COMMISSIONERS AT FISH MONOPIIS' HALL Mr Dudley Mann and Mr W L Y once, two of the Southern Commissioners now in England, attended the dinner of the Fishmongers' Company) on Saturday Mr "Lance, in answer to a complimentary toast, said -The justice and the sense of right of this great Government, promptly coincided in by France and Spain, speedily wiped out the stigma of rebellion from our brows, and my countrymen are acknowledged here, at least, to be belligerents (Cheers ) No matter what they may have been, one thing is clear, and that is, that the contest now going on is upon the part of the people of the Confederate States for the right to govern themselves, and to resist subjugation by the North (Hear, hear ) They occupy a territory as large as England, France, Spain, and Austria together they are ten millions in number they are chiefly producers of important raw materials, and buyers of all kinds of manufactured goods Their pursuits, soil, climate, and productions are totally different from those of the North They think it their interest to buy where the can buy cheapest, and to sell where they can sell dearest In all this the North differs, Mo collo, from them, and now makes war upon us to enforce the supremacy of their mistaken ideas and selfish interest (" Hear, hear," and cheers ) Why should there not be peace a Simply because the North, in its pride, will not admit that to be a fact as fast accompli-which Old England, followed by the first Powers of Europe, has recognised, and which the Confederate Government and armies have repeatedly demonstrated to be a stern and bloody fact the fact that we are a belligerent Power. There can be no basis for negotiation, or for peace proposals, or consultations, so long as the Confederates are deemed to be and are treated as rebels (Hear ) But when our adversary shall become sufficiently calm to treat us as a belligerent power, the morning of peace will dawn in the home When the hour shall arrive, I think I may say the Confederate Government will be in- flexible upon one point only-its honour and its independence For the great interests of peace and humanity it will yield much that is merely material or of secondary importance.
