Sonnet. CALIGULA. (THE BASALT BUST AT THE CAPITOL.) Being in torment how should he be still ? The slim neck twists; the eyes beneath the wide Bent Claudian brows shrink proud and terrified; Alone the beardless cheek the muscles thrill Like smitten lute-strings. Cau no strength of will Silence this presence ever at his side, This hateful voice, that will not be denied, That talks with him, and matters 'kill,' and 'kill'? O dust and shade, O dazed and fighting brain, O dead old world that shuddered on his nod, Only this iron stone endures; and thence Looks forth a soul in everlasting pain, The ghost of Ctesar, maniac and god, And loathes the weakness of omnipotence. J. B. B. Nichols in ' Love's Looking Gloss.'
