MR. MONCURE CONWAYS LECTURES. '-Yesterday evening Mr Moncure Conw took as his subject Thomas Carlyle 1 audience, like those which assembled years back in "H Ellis s rooms to listen to t discourses of Curl j to himself, WItH Belo and intelligent, and found "any deficiency in-the mere mechanism of oratory more tin counterbalanced by the lecturer's mastery his subject his genuine power of expression and his sympathetic grasp ' It may. 1 added that Mr Conway was much better heard on this occasion, so that it may I supposed either that he has become accustomed to the properties of the Athenaeum hall, or that the new arrangements made of his behalf are an acoustic success Apart from Mr Conway s striking powers as a literal artiste, the charm of such a discourse i yesterday s is the lecturer's personal acquaintance with the men and women he deserves His anecdotes are original his side touch Sympathetic, and are felt instinctively to 1 really illustrativoofcharactcr IMargarotrull declared it to be pleasant to sit and listen i Carl j le, though she complained that he never would allow any one to interrupt him and is also pleasant to hear Mr Conway repeat ( describe Carlyle s talk, and there seems to 1 no desire to interrupt him except to apply some finely expressed sentiment, or to land at some good story. the lecture was not only a sketch c Carlyle, but also a reply to Troudcs no notorious v volumes Mr Conway commence by describing a profile seen afar off in a American mountain The jutting brow, the strong underfoot, the delicate mouth, pathetic expression of pain , the gaze from earth into the far on heaven, all recalls Carlyle 'The face was named after him But it required a long perspective to b appreciated Those who drew near found only a few acres of rugged and bleak desert tion So with Carlyle His death arouse a sympathetic enthusiasm rare in this work but so great was the reaction after the publication of Troudos t volumes that though statue of him-a magnificent work c art-had been cast, yet it was to li seen put it will in a shed in a back lane because the money was uotforthconuni for the pedestal The man who had thundered as from Sinai to the modern generation w a misunderstood, humiliated and even hated Something, of the sort had happened to him before His attitude in the American via disappointed the most sincere of his admirers As one of them said, "Abraham Lincoln was exactly the kind of hero Carl)! taught me in early life to admire but when his hero was actually before him he had only invective and abuse He could prostrate himself before great heroes in the past, but he could not recognise the hero who was delivering America from slavery But his early friends came back they remembered his aspirations and his teachings, and the venerable firm was transformed into that of a hero His belief in slavery and kingship was BO impracticable that people gave him credit for the courage of his convictions The masses who had an abundance of flatterers, honoured this man who never flattered them, and at his death there was a wonderful outburst of feeling His Reminiscences were published, and all was changed the public drew near to the grand old man of the mountain, and found an irritable, nervous begins., with the common passions of humanity His idol was shattered And yet Mr Conway is a chance to endorse the remark made to him by Matthew Arnold, ' I merson is the man to whom love the greatest debt, but Carlyle was the more striking figure He believes that a glorious halo will yet surround that brow, but yet that Carl) less ultimate reputa- tion will not be the one attached to him at his death That was based upon an erroneous idea of the man. He never was what the public desired he should be the real man will prove to be as little like the distorted image as he was the " idealised Bamt Mr Conway's allusions to the Remains cences were introduced by an anecdote of how Carlyle s most popular portrait was produced At his request, Car) he agreed to sit to a photographer When the morning came he had a severe toothache One side of the face was greatly swollen, but Mrs Carlyle turned the good side to the camera, kept the distorted side in shadow, posed the head gently, rested the chin on the one hand, and thus the most picturesque of his likenesses was obtained the same tender care was not displayed by his biographer who gave prominence to the diseased side of the face and not to the sound side Carlyle told Tennyson that he had selected I roude because of his reticence Mr Conway believes that I rode was afraid that he would be further given, that he rushed the book through the press without reading much of it and was just as much astonished by the contents of the volumes thus carelessly edited as the rest of the World was Mr 1 roude s idea that Carlyle and his wife lived in a. chronic state of dissatisfaction and unhappiness is declared to be a delusion Mrs Carlyle had much sorrow Their early life was one of poverty and was passed in a desolate region without the joy and a nicety which youth requires Even in London Carlyle was. unable to obtain work for years, and lived on the money 1 merson sent from America- the proceeds of the books which he both published for Carlyle and bold But Carlyle s anxiety in those days was to give his wife his all, and there was st something pathetic in the desire he showed that she should visit the aristocracy when great doors were thrown open to him He despised those hints himself but his wife had taken a step downward in the eyes of the world when she married the peasant of I screeches, and he had a keen desire that she should be placed in the eyes of the world in a position as Ililli as she left for his sake Without the depth of her husband, Mrs Carlyle had a lively wit and true feeling and Mr Conw aj say she never saw her flush with anger except when censure of Cuiljle reached her car Those who read the letters between her and her husband without the explana- tions and comments of 1 roude will find no evidence of unhappiness The niece who lived with them for years is now married and her husband says "My wife never knew of the unhappiness She is sure her uncle and aunt never knew of it, the original discoverer is Mr L roude The charm of her letters is easily seen to be derived from the (good things Carlyle was ever pouring into her ears During the last years of her life nothing could induce him to leave her, and his evenings were spent not with his books but with her, entertaining her and the friends who called with his conversation Mr Con way gave an interesting and vivid account of the delicate wife on the sofa, and the philosopher with his clay pipe the bowl in the chimney so that no whiff of smoke should enter the room, and he declared that whatever her sorrows, yet Mrs Carlyle-and her letters sbowifc-enjoycd to the full the love and the society and the wonderful conversation of one of the richest intellects that over lived cm this planet The opinion of no personal friend has been changed by the biography, Mr. Conway himself regards Carlyle as a man to be loved, an intellect to be admired, but not a here to be worshipped The lecturer quoted a forcible passage from Schopenhauer, of how genius is concentrated, and bow when it turns its attention to trifles it may in les liens into elephants in its solar microscope," and this is the explana- tion of why, m Carlyle s letters, trivialities which would seem to be unworthy theatres tion of a philosopher, matters of fans and toothpicks and personal peculiarities, assume abnormal dimensions Mr Conway once in my line take exception to a nose '1 line nose assumed abysmal importance, it swelled and swelled until it seemed to be some " great fore smell of infinitude Blake painted the ghost of a Hen, and dreamed that he heard that ghost speak and say, ' If I had but power us I am bloodthirsty I would do instance the universe, and in his daily intercourse Carlyle often saw the vast in the minute in the same manner, and considered not the men but the potentialities it represented in his imagination the concluding part of the lecture was devoted to an analysis of Carlyle s doctrine of hero worship, with which Mr Conway has no sympathy w

are the result of the slow experiences of society, and we might as well attribute to Queen Victoria the law s passed in her name as ascribe to Solon and to Moses all the glories of their systems In this iconoclastic spirit Mr Conway proceeded to deal with a will with some of Curly le 8 heroes, arguing that here w worship had worked infinite harm in these and other cases by placing mens faults upon a level with their virtues Because Luther imagined he once saw the devil millions of Germans are afraid to go in the dark His tory and the Scriptures furnished examples, and the final conclusion of the lecturer was 'that the greatest man who has lived IB Shale spence the man of whom the world knows the least, who shrouds himself in his characters, whom noone carr worship, and who in the verse inscribed upon his tomb begs for Jesus' sake to be left alone Shakspeare has been spared a biographer On Monday Mr Conway lectures in the Atheneum on "the law of Development and Arrest in Religion,
