Ghosts in the Kitchen. ' There are ehosts in the kitchen, sir,9' was ihe extraordinary announcement made by a cook last night to her master, just as he was sitting down to dinner. The woman, pale with fright, nearly dropped the soup which she was bnoging to the table. Her master, a tradesman in the Rue du Bac, wondering what was the matter, walked with his cowering cook to the kitchen, and there saw to his astonishment that the chairs and tables were violently oscillating, the cupboards were also shaking, until it seemed as . if the spirits had really taken possession of the kitchen in order to hold a seance there. The tradesman then returned to the dining-room amazed, and hardly had he resumed his seat when the chairs, tables, sideboard, and in fact all the furniture began to vibrate around him. He immediately surmised that tbe whole house was coming' down, so he rushed out to consult one of hi» neighbor*, who is an architect. The latter returned with him to the dwelling-, and found that it wa-s gradually coming down. _ The police irareJjiegjcotninunicated with, and _ th=» totteriug habitation~w*?c1eared-of -ait'TXS' ? : inmates.
