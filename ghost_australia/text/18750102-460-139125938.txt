There are some ; words which are frequently usedwithout' especial applicabUity, and the term fashing is one' Of these. But there are, on the other hand, occasions which not only justify, hut imperatively- require, this word to be used. And the pre sent is one of them. • Miss Winston was dashing, in the completest sense in which you can employ this word. Y-ou might: use a dozen other words to corroborate its meaning or to emphasise the de scription. Thus, you might say she was elastic,' 'bounding, airy, buoyant, jaunty, sprightly, sportive, overflowing with Spirits; that she illustrated practically what is meant by abandon; that her good humour never flagged; that she sang like a lark, and moved liked chhrhditL 'She would deserve te have all, and more than all this B&id; of her; but if you will regard, the single' word' which I began as a term of compound-and compre hensive meaning; and- apply it libe rally, you will describe .pretty, accurately the effect sbe produced oh the audience. Ik is hardly' ~ necessary to say that she dressed so as to set off the natural advantages of-herhandsome figure. - " *' > 1 . . ' "Keit of BBSs' Carey.

Of the principle of, this aerial sua* pension there is probably no sort of doubt, but at the skilful, deft mode in which it is applied, therei can be nothing but admira tion. In addition to the delicate mechanism by means of which it is produced, however, I think the young lady is put into the cata leptic state; or, if not, then is she a wonderful actress, and possesses a remarkable power .ever het tnuBcles. . The 'whole process offers a Very curious study of what can be done by practised manipulation. The forlorn Princess's has been opened for Christmas time by a . company of mjnstrels, calling themselves the Queen's Minstrels. I went to see them'on Monday night. It was yery hot, and I counted 98 peoplein the house. Anybody going away and not counting the audience w<juld very likely have said there was alg>ut a dozen. Bat even 98 is not i aa inspiriting number to play to. Conse quently, you will-not he surprised to be told that thp performance was languid. They .•sang as if their hearts were heavy. They told old jokes in a melancholy fashion. The centre-man seemed as if he- would have liked to go.ont and cry. The bones had a silent Sorrow somewhere, and the- tambourine,'had a sorrow which was not silent, bat which'was nevertheless equally obvious as a sorrow. He was oppressed with the obligation to be funny, end- he was, in feci* .about as funny as a yopng -gentleman with the toothache waiting" in a .-dentist's outer room fori bis tnta.te borne. Also ,the audience werejin a sadframe of mind. Their applause appeared to cOiqe from compassion, not enthusiasm. They were sorry for the minstrels, landi wishful to be gqed to them, but what qoold.,' 98 persons doin a house big enough to ihold, 2,000*! Considering the temperature, and the place, apd the settled melancholy of the, ( : performers, the audience were wonderfully determined in their approval. It was a. funereal determination, but it was as good as could be - expected under the circum stances. Ag a matter of course, I also am sorry for the <Jueen'sMinstrels, hut corrow will not fill their bouse. If something else should fill it, and they should grow lively, I shall be glad to yaenMon it , Meantime, if they could; get m altogether fresh stock of jokes, ] and' bury all the old onesr it might make both them and ttair. patrons less melan choly.. . :■* V .
