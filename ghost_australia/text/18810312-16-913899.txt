Her girlish figure and innocent child-like ways almost entirely concealed^ a strength of will aud latent passion of which none but Heiniers had as yet a suspicion. He stood by her side, while his eyea wandered over that scene-the tranquil flashing waters stretched out before them, the glories of cloud land around and above, and the long range of scarped cliffs rising above the sea line to right and le'ft. And then they were fixed upon her face, lit up also with that ethereal biightuess fiom the weat, and softly and slowly ho spoke again : "Agnes, I've made up my mind to speak it out, como what may I I'm going to tell a bit o' my troubles that p'raps thee never guessed at, It's only ten years since I came here, and beforo that -well, never miud, it's all over and dono for now. Things had beeu different with ma before. I spoke different, lived different from what I do now. All at once I found myself ruined, with my name blackened for ever, and I chose men should think mo dead. 1 went to the pit and worked thore. Tom, thy brother, was the first that showed mo any kindues?, theu thy mother, and then-Agnes, there was a bit of kindness in thy voice and ways, and I began to hope a little. And I carno o' nights to tho toll-bar, and the more I carne the moro I hoped and louged for theo. And now it's out. Agues, canst thou caro a bit for a poor rough fellow like I am 1" " Oh, George ! I never thought-oi that," she faltered out. " Never thought !" said he, laying hold of her hand with passionate grasp. " Never thought, when I used to guide these little finden o' winter nights iu our schooling, how I louged to Beize them and tell theo all, or that when we wandered about on these cliffs mid talked o' all strange thiugs iu the big world, I was any- thing more than the stern old school-master 1 Well, I was a fool. Curse it all !" and he stamped with sudden rage and impatience. Her head was bent low, and tho teara wero fast ailing again. " AgneB, dear, look up," he went on, with a sudden change in his voice ; " I seo it's no use ; I was a fool to think any woman could care for me again. Well, never miud. I won't trouble you iu this way auy more. But, oh, if you could only love me, child !" he broke out with another burst of passion. " I would make you so happy -happier far than any of the poor fools about here could do !" " Oh, George, didn't I say it was all a mistake the way thiugs go !" she said, looking appealingly into hie face1. "You were so good, George, I never thought of that, and theu-thore waa another, and he used to court me, though neither you nor mother knew ; und I lovo bim, oh, George, so much I But I don't know how it ia, things have gone wrong, and I don t know whether he care» f >r ino now, and I m so wretched ' Heimers w13 too generous to ask tho name Still, he thought ho might watch over aud help her, and there was no knowing but she might leam to love him it last So, with some hope yet loft, he talked of other matters the fair at Sixby, the nevv steimer anchored iu Snutby harbour, and so on, till it waB time to return to the cottage Hu would not go in that night, but wa dered instead for miuj hours by the sea shore vv ith the geutly murmuring waves aud the couutless gleaming st na for company Then he roturi ed to the mine in vv Inch ho waa ov erlookmg, and did not leave it till again the sun was setting on the following day A week went past, when one night George, weary and disheartoned (for things were (,omg on very badly iu tho miuo), strolled along the beach till he came to hoiuo seaweed covered rocks Lyiug down and resting bia head upon his hand, he remained there motimless for a long time with bia ejea fl\od upon the waves that iu restless mood were beating upon tho rocks before him It was about 9 o clock, and the night was now very dark All at once he heard footsteps approaching by the narrow path which wouud along the side of the cliff at a little distance above his head He looked up, though the darkness was too great to see anyono but at tho samo time ho heard voices, and evidently the speakers lind stopped just above whare he waa Ijing At the Bamo instant ho recognised their voices They were AgneE Benson and her cousin Jim Massey, agood looking hard woikiog follow, lgnonutnnd thoughtleBB, and too foud of Bpeudiug his money in public houses, with no ambition to bo any- thing higher in life than a. working collier, but with no worse faults that Heimers know of It was bitter tortuie for him to liston, but he could not move from where he waB without being discovered, and ho did not w ish that 1 he lovers quarrel hld evidently boen undo up their talk was half bauter and half iu earnest of a happy future in winch none but thomselves should have a part and George detected 111 the soft tones of Agnes s voice a joyous ring that be had not before heard in it Then carno t! e eouud of kisses interchanged, and still Geor¡,o had to listen lhen they pi«ted away up the hillside, in the direction of Agnes s home George Heimera stiod erect, his back against tho cliff All was still save for the long melan- choly cry of a sea gull that chanced to fly past him, and the hoarse sound of the waves beating at bia feet with tho grating rattle of tho pebbles as each Bpent wave drew back fiom tho shore Ihe thick darkness was about bim aud within his soul Terrible to him was the clamour of thoso waves as they rushed up the boach, and then retiring dragged with them then pi ey from the shore The sound was in b13 ears like the dirge of his hopea overthrown his life drawn downward, dowuward, by tho waves of pitiless fate to the depths of that ocean of despair that never moro gives up its dead Chimeh II A 8TIUI.0E Bight is a coal mine Wonderfully picturesque with its streets and lanes and alleys, its unending corridors and countless chambers ot the dead The men there, with blackened fices and scanty attire, seem of another race from those above ground, and the feeble lights gloaming in the midst of the darkness yi\e a weird unreal aspect to the scene The only sounds heard are those of the coal vvaggouB Blowly pushed aloug by boys towards the mouth of the pit, and in tbe narrow pass- ages, where the men are at work, the clang of their pickaxea as they cleave their way through the great rockB of coal Men are not the only beings here There are horses, that bavo not seen the daylight for many a year, to draw the waggons in the broador passages, and sometimea, if the light of the lamp ia turned toward the ground, the bright little eye3 of rata (how they came to that under world I don t know) may be seen peering out of nooka among the walla There is an almost fearful sombreness about the place Thoughti thit the daylight would at once dispel seem to haunt the an, and the voices of the men aa they wander about, each one, Oideon like, with his lamp and pickaxe, have a deeper hollower tone than above ground Iwo days had passed, and duung that time a Btorm, long remembered on the eoa3t, h id been ragiug , but the men in the mine, iccustomed as they were to hearing the roar of the waves above their heads, paid little heed to the in creased noise George Heimers alone had noticed it, and each day h id spent more time than usual iu examining the supports of the roof It was now nighttime, and he had been super intending some rather dangerous work in the lower levels, of blasting with gunpowder, which, much against bis advice, the owner had ordered This being done leaving further orders for work with the men, George turned away and walked alone in the direction of the pit b mouth, carry- ing ia one hand a large canister containing the gunpowder , in the other bia lamp and the heavy stick that, on account of hia lameneps, was his constant companion Even in that imperfect light it might have been seen that a great change had passed over his face , it was Suggard and pinched looking , there was a strange restless glitter in his eyes, and now and then hia lips parted with an involuntary quivering movement, quickly preased together a¿ain with that stern aet expreaaion that was now habitual to them Instead of leaving the mine, a sudden thought seemed to strike him half way, and he turned aside and entered a part of the mine long de serted on account of the danger of working too near the bottom of the sea, but which recently had been opened again , and, though George bad many times warned the owner of the daugei of weakening the supports of the roof, large quanti ties' of coal had been taken from it AU was still as be advanced through the narrow passage«, but soon the^e widened into a 1 mere open space, and ob he entered the noise of the tumultuous waters overhead was fearfully loud A cold draught of air smote ou him and made him shiver Tho place was known to the colliers as tho " Boggart s Hole, or the "Ghost a Hole ' It ia an immenee low roofed hall, one of thoso natural caverns th it exist beneath the bch and land, and in the centre was an abyss, mt j whose doptliB no humau being had ovei peuo trited The workings had been earned on along the sides, and a rude pathvviy led halt w ly round, abruptly stopping above the great cb ism The poor light wbieh George held illumined only a narrow cncle round him, but ho kuow the place well, and cautiously atepi mg along reaehed the part where the last vv orkiugs had been m i le, and which wa3 so low that ho could touch with his baud the blick Binny îoof, to which gigautic loatboomc fungi clung As he stood thete wild fancies stole over him Loud above sounded the thunderous boom ot the suif, and beneath bim lav, wrapped in eternal darkness, the great mine, Bti etching for miles into the depths of the eaith Ho ae ited himself on a projecting rock, the canister of powder ou the grouudat hi« side, and the lump held betweeu his knees M hat were his thoughts just then ' I know not all-but thore was one, fiercer than tho clamour of the waves above, moie temblé than the abyss beueith bim-he had lost all, all ! Ho looked bick upon his life-all had gone wione, fiom the begiuuiug, and now, wheu at list the cup of sweetuesa had seemed to be so near h s lips he had seen it dashed away lie ground his teeth with rage, aud then bia passion took another form-bia breast heaved, and a ¡.rent sobbiug cry ro=e to his lips " If she only knew how I love her ! Ile love ! A incinOut vi tue love 1 could give Der ?woum uu ino-e than a lifetime of his But I know that never, never-let me make an end of it " Ah, aud Jim Massey, too , a light to this powder, and there d be no victory to auy one - the sea would cover us too close for that ! But the others 1 " Pooh . it s only dying a little sooner, and what ia life to stupid toiling drudges like them? A terrible smile parsed ov el hia face, he placed the lamp by b13 side aud bent over the canister Ouly a light to the powder, and tho rocks above would be riven, aud with 1 mighty burst the sea would rush iu and whelm tnem all ' ne took out his knife and proceeded to open the lid of the canister, which by bouib means had been fastened down too tightly But, hark' Close besido him, just beyond the ending of the path, ha heard a ruttluig cracking sound, then a cr ish and a huge frag mont of rock rolled down, and he wns only just in time to leap aaide before tho place where he had stood waa covered with shivered portions f it aa it descended, ind, leaping from led¿e to ledge, at last, with sullen roar, was lost in the depth below Still he listened for another mid more dreadful souud c night his ear-the low swishing sound of falling water Ho crept as near is he could doug the narrow pathwav, ind as he did so his face wns sprinkled vv ith the cold Bpray of the torrent Ho hi Id out his hand, und then, touching his lips, tasted the water It was salt ' Still and breathless as a statue he stood for a moment, the next, holding the lamp before lum, he was rushing with wild speed dowu the broken pathway away from the place As ho approached the entrance he Btopped, and for a moment looked around in bevvildermeut-ho had mistaken the road, and instead ot tiking that by which he had come, had followed another, whieh abruptly stopped-a miiBa of coal had fallen aud broken it oil He bad no tim« to turn back He threw his lamp down, und, ai fortuno would hive it, it was not biokon, but only fallen on one side about ten feot below , theu, drawing m hu bieatb, ho prepared foi the lea]) He did not know the ground-the lamp lind gouo out If he leaped ho might fall into sotno deep fissure , but there was no time to hesi'ate He took the leap and fell , the firm ground was beneath him His arm was bruised and his ankle sprained, but he hardly felt it Relighting his lamp ho dashed along through tho narrow passages toward tho main where the men were at woik Atlast ho met a boy slowly dragging along a small coal waggon Ho caught the lad by the shoulder and shouted to him " Can you run, Willi" " Ay, 01 can," answered tho boy " Then run your hardest, Will Tell them u the lower mum tho waters coming in, and in an hour it 11 all be flooded " " Pay ther s there ' ' the boy cried, and without auothei word lushed oil Other boys were sent to the other puts of the mine, forced by Geoigo s stern voice to obey, as ho told them ho would not let one mau leav u the pit till they were all theio Theu he waited And if any one had seen his face as he stood alono a strange chango woul 1 have been noticed in it Thero vv is now a look of such tnumphaut gladucss aB foi mnuyayear had not rested there Ho stretched out Ins aims like one who had just ended soma weary 1 iboui Theu his head sunk on hia boram, lud ho mut tered - " 0 God ! Saved . saved ! 1 hou hast kept ma from it, and I may yet Bave them all " Quickly he recovered himself aud went tuto a small ofhce where he kept his books and mstru menta Ho took from a bo\ a sin ill re olver and some matches and went out again He then set light to a heap of shavings and dr wood lying near the door, and this soon blu/ed up, illuminating the whole place And again he waited S ion iroop after troop of the men, flying at their utmost speed, reached the pit s mouth, and a fearful sight it was to see the struggling mass of men, each one, with maddened shouts and blows, Btrivmg to come lieaier to the basket But George Hoimers s voice was heard loud ubov o it all - "The first that touches that basket before I tell hun 111 shoot that man ! ' They saw the levelled barrel of the revolver ana drew back "Those that are married, stand here " And in silence the men obeyed him He theu signalled to a certain number of them to enter the basket Not au instant was lost, and they were hoisted out of sight The others Btrainad their eyes to watch tho ascending mass, calculating how soon it would return to rescue thom Some of the men who had their sons with them clasped them tight m their arms, whispering messagea to bo given if they were loaf, for in nearly every caBe tho fathers chose that the boys should go in their place , some Bank to the ground muttering prayers that they had never spoken since child hood, and others listened to George Heimera as ho told them there was still hope if they would obey him Jim MaBaey had been m one of the most dis tant workings, and was one of the last to reach the pit's mouth, and now be stood by the wall apart, with eyes bent down on something he held in his hand-a lock of Agnes s hair that she bud given him the night before More than half the number of men wero now safe , and the basket, whirled up by those who knew just how much depended upon their work, had just left when George, in the calm voice with which ho had spoken before, said " Men, who's to go next ' ' There veie ouly about twenty left, men and boys, whom George had many a time helped by words and deeds they remembered this, and all cried at once " Next turn's thine, master-we'll come after '" " Thank you, my lads,' he i nswered quietly " I'm not going this time but I want to send some ono in my place Will you let me ! ' Not so eagerly this time-but still the answer, " Ay master ' ' was given " Jim, come here 1 ' Georgo shouted " You take my place when it comos again Nay, lad, you. must I Remember, Agnes wants you, Jim, you'll be goo 1 to her, won't you * And tell her sometimes the last words I tried to say were, ' God bless both of you ' . ' Once more the basket descended, tne few that were chosen leaped into it, the rope was shaken as the signal to hoist up, and with one tight hand grip Georgo sent Jim on his way And aa they parted Jim looked at the other s face, and never to his dying day did he forget what bo saw there-the bitterness of death bad passed awav, and a strango peace was shining forth from his eyes It was the last freight George already bad heard the distant thunder of the waters bursting in full flood into the mine He knew the end was come, and when the basket was ascending he turned away doTn a side passage that he might not seo the agony of the poor men when they found it was too late JuBt as the basket reached the level of the upper ground, where hundreds were waiting anxiously to watch the arrival of each company that was saved, a tremendous black cloud rolled up the pit's mouth, bursting up with a fearful roar high into mid air, and when it had cleared away and the men peered down the shaft, far away in tbe darkness beneath they could hear tho dash of the waves, and sometimes thought they couki discern their white gleam .as they leaped uj> the sides of the shaft. Jim Massey and several others volunteered to go dowu uud seek for .any who might be still struggling in the water. It was too late when they reached the place, and only a few or the elend bodies were over recovered. The mine ia now deserted, and its buildings aro in ruins. Some time after the disaster a part of the cliff above it, piob.ably undermined by the action of the waves, fell dowu one stormy night, and now there ia a great cavern wandering away iu datk passages uuder the cliff where part of the coal mine bad been. It is easy to penetrate beneath those gloomy niches in a boat during fine weather, and many times iu after days Agues-then a happy wife aud mother-would como there with her children on summer days, aud tell them tho story of how their father's life had beeu Biived. And wheu sho had endsd, and leaned back in the boat as they floated on through that silent gloom as of twilight, the large tears would gather in her eyes for bim who lay in that uukiiowu tomb of his fur below iu some dark cavern of the sea.-Temple liar.
