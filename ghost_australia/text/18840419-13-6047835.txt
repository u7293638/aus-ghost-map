FRANCE. (FROM OUR OWN tXHlRESrOKDIiNT.) PARIS, March 7. M de Nothomb who, one of the first in syncope, foresaw the high destinies of Prince Bismarck, used to say of him, "He is neither a high minded nor a generous minded man He is not guided by the interests of humanity or even of Europe, he is a German statesman Politics are for him only a force, he despises men, and has only two objects in view the maintaining of his work and of himself , the greatness of German and his own To this portrait of the illustrious Chancellor, drawn by the Minister of Leopold of Belgium, there is still wanting a most important feature, to wit, the marvellous ease with which, when necessary), he overthrows man instant his own combinations and the species of moral insensibility which raises him above those rules of conduct by which other men this allow themselves to be guided A few months since, or even a few weeks the honeymoon of the Austro-German alliance was still at its full, while the relations between Germany and Russia seemed to be growing more and more sour every day Russia was concentrating troops in Poland, and people had some cause to think or rather did think, we were on the eve of a nr Herr v on Bismarck, it was said, desired it, and had already reckoned up the fruits of success This difficult and alarming state of things has changed all of a sudden M de Bismarck has turned off his steam, as we say toda) The relations between Berlin and St Petersburg have once more become friendly, and, almost affectionate By what has this change been brought about i Has M de Bismarck at the last moment met with an invincible resistance to his plans of w or in the sole will before which his own is obliged to bow down ' Has the 3 Emperor William, whose 87th birthday will be cele- brutcdafew days have, brought to beat his great age, his wish to conclude without any further adventures a reign that has already risked so many, and the family attachment which binds him to the Czar' But so it is, and the Austro-German treaty of alliance has given way, for the moment at least, to new home combinations At Vienna the change seems to have made a great stir Here, we have remained calm, even the in formation given by the standard of a secret treaty made at the interview of 1 nedprichsuhe, which has roused the whole Austrian press, has been received in Paris with far more incredulity than alarm to-day the tidings given by the Standard have met with a formal denial na), more, it is said that no treaty of any kind exists between Germany and Russia, and, sooth to say, the reconciliation of the two powers may be brought about without the help of any written document, or even of any verbal agreement In all this there is no cause of alarm or even of disquiet, for France the situation remaining precisely what it was before "We are still alone, but we are threatened by a body at least, not for the present We all know how long alliances last, and what they are worth, and per dv enture this close union of Germany and Russia may be more in our favour than a war between the two empires would have been for such a war would have been to us a cause of sore perplexity We have at present business enough on our hands in Tonquin, and are impatiently awaiting news of the attack of Bacmnth' It would now seem to be a question of a few days, perhaps of a few hours only That matter once decided, we shall know whether or not we shall have to go to war with China Concerning the difficulties which have arisen between our Government and the Australian colonies concerning the transportation of our convicts, I am able to give YOU Information from an official source which rectified in some degree that given by the St James s Gazette. It is perfectly true that no reply has been made as yet to ike postulates transmitted by Lord Lyons, as our Government is of opinion that it is useless to open a debate upon a bill which has not yet re- ceivcd the sanction of the legislature, and the vote of which no wise implies the adoption of the measure against which the colonies have deemed it necessary to protest beforehand. M Jules Ferry has not, however, awaited the vote of the Senate, but has already studied the question He has con terred with his colleagues of the Home department and the Admiralty, and it has been decided that, in the present case, the objections on the postulates cannot be at tended to the motives of this decision have been verbally explained to Lord Lyons, who, without expressing any opinion of his own, has declared it to be the intention of the British Government not to interfere in the matter as Government M lerryndded, more over, that should it really be decided, a thing which is as yet still uncertain, to transport ourneii/ieiito to New Caledonia, every precaution would be taken to avert from Austral i an) annoyance that such an unpleasant neighbourhood might be supposed to the use to As to the reprisals which, according to the St James s OaMte, Australia purposed to take such is to forbid the entrance of her harbours to the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes M Jules 1 trry did not seem inclined to look on them as being really serious, the more so as such a measure would be contrary to international law Everyone seems anxious, both in Paris and London, to avoid whatever is calculated, I will not say to disturb, but even to cool in anyway the friendly relations which exist between the two Governments The 3 English agents, formstanci, sent to Paris with view to search out the authors of the infamous crimes and criminal attempts committed at London by the mains of d) nannie and block work, have no communication what it is with the British imbubS) Hut, on the other hand, Mr Maurice Mauser, the chief commissary of Scotland Hird, who is in trusted with this most distant mission, has several times conferred on the subject with M Camescasse, ourpitlittotpoint, who has promised him every) help and assistance from news agents in order to facilitate success Mr Mauser is assisted by Sergeant Forest and Inspector Williamson, who uri ed secretes Reid I), and the Prefecture has placed at his disposal a whole brigade of agents An m Lissant weather is 1 set up in all the ports on our coasts, and um passengers for New York on carefully) watched and questioned Gatum signs have already cropped up, showing eli i iv that that are or have been in Paris Irishmen or Amiriiun Irish who are agents of this propaganda by means of d) nannie Paris is the undoubted that of a committee of consultation composed of a head centre and a certain number of members and it would seem to be in ascertained fact that the most mint orders for the elia tribution of the spirit animals of this proof ganda wire sent from land Him still remains to he discovered the place of destination and of the manufacturer of the dying out, but it is thought that the strict watch kept over the French ports will soon lead to the clearing" up of those points Of course these measures nowise concern those Irishmen who have long been resident in France and who though belonging to the ultra nationalists have never had any thing to do with the disciples of Mr O Donovan Rossa, such as John O Lear) J P Leonard, Mr James Stephen, certain Irish merchants of the highest respectability), the director and professor of the College des Francais, near the Pantheon, Le Notwithstanding the prevalence in tins latter establishment of nationalistic ideas, masters and scholars all agree in stigmatising all violent measures, and more especially those which have in view such useless, unmeaning, and indiscriminate slaughter The strikes in the north continue, to the great prejudice both of mine owners and men Up to the present moment good order and quiet have been preserved The men persist in their refusal to work, but have no recourse to violence One act of violence, is, however, to be noted, a fruitless attempt to blow up the cottages of a miner, who had declared that nothing should prevent him from continuing to work, and. this, indeed, is the most sacred and the most undeniable of the rights of man An inter- pellation has been addressed to the Minister? of Public Works by two deputies of the department in which the mining districts are comprised, but was replied to by an order of the day our yet simple The Home Minister has, however, addressed a circular to the prefects, Laying down the rules they are to observe, which are, on the one hand, to do their best to bring about an agreement between the company and the workmen, without taking any share in the conflict, and, on the other, to take strict heed that no attempt be made to infringe upon the liberty of those who refuse to join the strike, without, at the same time, in any way interfering with the right of coalition as it is allowed by law At home, the Monarchical parties continue to make is stir among themselves, but are thoroughly) powerless the loyalists by the absence of all encour cement from their ac- know lodged leaders , the Imperialists by their intestine strife The latter are incessant!) complaining either of Prince Jerome or of his son Prince V ictor-the former huffing the Count of Paris The Count who has been compared to a modern Hamlet who, in the silence of the night and amidst the groves of the Chateau di u, ia peradventure visited by the ghost of his father-has n soul almost evidently to immelled down by hesitation and a heart as Shakspeare has it full of scorpions ' He would fain do something and yet he would not 'the legitimate traditions, the usurp action of 1830, his liberal education, Ina hatred of the Empire Ina and) in the American Republic (on which he has written a book marked by good sense and rectitude of judgment), have sown the seeds of uncertainty deep in his mind Add to that a Bluttishness of character He lived from his German mother, and the tendency common to all the Orleans family to be ready enough to fish in troubled w here, but, like the cat to be unwilling to wet his feet The leaders of his party in vain din with his cars that, after all, " all roads lead to Lu,' he is not ignorant that fromEuthere are many roads leading out of France, and the prospect offers but little charm to his imagination, and caused him to take thought Prince Jerome Napoleon, also, is fain to take thought Urged thereto by II now not what morne, unless it is to withdraw him from the clutches and baneful influence of M.
