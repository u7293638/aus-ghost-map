Sackville Amateur Dramatic Club. The Sackville Amateur Dramatic Club have given several good renditions of popular comedies lately, and are making good progress in educating the members for better work. The entertainment given in the local hall on 23th March consisted of two farces, dialogues, and readings. The programme opened with " Easy ! Shaving," a farce that met with a warm reception when first produced in London. The dialogue " William Tell," in which Mr. A. D. Wright and his little boy Reginald were assisted by Messrs F. and A. Stubbs, was without doubt the gem of the evening. A scene from "The Poor Gentleman," a reading by Mr. Geo. Hast well from " Peck's Bad Boy," " A litttle comedy of Marriage," j brought us to the closing item on the programme, j " That Boy Pete." This farce was first produced at the Royal Agricultural Hall, London, and ran well for one hundred nights. The main character was taken by Mr. Leslie White. Mr. A. Stubbs represented Sambo, and Mr. Geo. Hastwell the Ghost. The other characters were taken by Messrs Wright, Woodhouse, A. Watkins, Jas. Bell, F. Cockerill, and the ladies. The farce met with unlimited applause from the audience. The members are anticipating a great success on the Queen's Birthday as they are preparing-Eh ? All right, I will not tell.
