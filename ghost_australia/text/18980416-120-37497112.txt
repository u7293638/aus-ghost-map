HAUNTED. One day, alas, I lost my youth, I know not when or how ; I only know I had it once, And cannot find it now. But sometimes in the winter I feel it in the air, And when the snowflakes kiss my face It seems to touch me there. Then in the spring the breezes That wander from the South, With warm caresses laden, Seek youth upon my mouth. And, oh, the summer sunbeams That make the roses blush They stir my blood and linger To bid my wan ceeks flush. My youth? I lost it long ago, But of this fact I boast- It may be dead, but surely, I Am haunted by its ghost. -EDWARD VAN ZILE.
