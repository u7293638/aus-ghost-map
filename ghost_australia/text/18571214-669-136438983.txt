ULLADULLA. [FROM OUR COUnESl'ONDENT.] John Taylor's Letter. — Such a letter as this is scarcely worth noticing as there is not one sentence true, not even the signature, there being no such individual here. Another individual, nt a public meeting, held here recently, took the opportunity of defaming me ns your correspondent. I have no desire to bring any one into tho public print, but, if the offence be repeated, I will at once throw off tho incog, nnd put on the armor of con troversy. I know something of the inhabitants of Ulladulla for the last twenty years, and as nn honest correspondent my veracity can be depended on, ns I have not, nor intend to, administer to the whims or prejudices of any party, but give such true and faithful accounts of what- transpires ns becomes the columus of your journal, nnd aro creditable to myself. Tim Ghost Again. — The ghost I mentioned a short time back, still continues to send forth its strange and tremendous sounds. On tho evening of the 1st inst., nine persons went out to endeavor to dispel the mystery which surrounds this matter. For this purpose, three entered the swamp, the other six stopping outside to see that the monstet did not make its escape. Not many moments had elapsed ' after the three had entered the scrub, when the dreaded stranger gavo forth a bellow which made the six outsiders fancy their legs were their best friends, and they made off as quick as they could, leaving the three in the Bcrub to get out the best way they might. Tho three stnut-heai ted explorers, said they got. so near as to hear the breathing of tho monster. Some still affirm it is a bird, others a crocodile, another says it is a hippocentaur, hut Mr. Berry says he saw it, and it is a bird. Be this as it may, many still stick to the belief that it is something supernatural, as no known animal has such a powerful voice. 1 trust I will be able to tell you of its capture in my next report.
