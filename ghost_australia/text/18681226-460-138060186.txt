As soon as this Bad event ' was annotmoed, alT the cardinals assembled in solemn : conclave in the Quirinal Falaoe, where they were to re main until they bad elected* new Pope. .

' Then loud acclamations filled the GbapeL liartai . 'Ferreti heeded them not. He sank upon his knees, and in fervent prayer seemed to invoke divine promo tion in this hour of his grandest responsibility.' So saint-like was tbe expression of hie noble faoe, so holy the light of his beautiful eyes, so meek and humble his attitude, that all bowed before bim in reverenbe, convinoed that in him tbey had chosen, as their |upreme Ponti^ a true and faithful suooeseor of Saint ; HAVING Onb's POETEAIT Taebk,-There is one disadvantage in giving w«r to this piece of personal vanity.
