TO CORRESPONDENTS. Duckponds. — It is rather too late now for verses on the wreck of the Admella. Justice.— We are quite willing to allow you to explain and vindicate your own opinions, but the imaginary colloquy would cause needless offence. 'Mabsabet'sGhost' puts a series of questions to us relative to the manner in which Government funerals are conducted. We do not wish to be uncivil to a Ghost, but, really it is quite heterodox for ghosts to put questions to the denizens of this lower world. The orthodox practice is lor spirits to impart information, not seek it. If, however, Margaret 6 spirit is anquiet, we think it should haunt the government offices, and particularly the office of the Chief mctadeT' m Wh°Be department' we believe, the Cemetery is P. L. HinsraR.— Our correspondent writes denying that he wrote a letter tp the Central Road Board as reported in thelMt meeting of that Board. We will enquire into the origin of the mistake.
