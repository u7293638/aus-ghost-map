The man— it was a man—had on a top hat which-was'battered and bruised out of all semblance of its . original shape. His overcoat, w^cli was trimmed witL imitation astrabhan, was torn in half a dozen places and coveted with mud, as if it hall been rolled in the gutter with its owner inside it, but it was buttoned light ap to his chin in a manner which suggested .a not unnatural anxiety to conceal.material deficiencies in the rest of his attjre.. HIb ^cpnntenapce bore evidence of having been recently subjected to serious illusage. • One eye'wis ornamehted by a purple patch, the skin of his right cheek was bruised and broken as by a blowfrom a. fist, and his iiout^kwas so badly-cutas to say, the least, to -en tier it highly inconvenient for him to be jompeUed to .open his lips. The'sorry spectacle was Stewart Trevannion, alios Alexander Taunton, alias Mr. Arthur Stewart,' ViZias a dozen other names— the immaculate Mr. Tomtsend's brother. A striking contrast the twobrothers presented as they ^tood there. • Alexander was rubbing his hands over each •titer. He seemed to experience a difficulty in holding himself straight up.

I bell eve most of them do, in their youth, manv things which they ought not to" do—and for which, in .their; age, they are sorry. I take this for granted." And'I believe that, in spite of this being so, some of them make good husbands.and good fathers. I think it possible that your temptations have been greater than is the case, with the average man, and that, therefore,- four misdoings have been more.. But I am convinced that, as regards real 'strength, you are stronger than the average -man, and that you can, if you like, put these things behind you for ever—and, on the stepping-stones of your dead self, rise to higher things. And I believe that you will Iiko, because you love me—and, because, also, I love you." ' "Unfortunately, Miss Jardine " \- She made- aa : imperious gesture with her hind.. "Call me Dora.

They meet us at Pliilippi." " If in your, life there.are such ghosts, why did you ask me to marry you?" " I ought not to have done.

He seemed to hesitate. .-She .went on with, in her voice, a sudden tremor. "Consider! Think well before you speak ! Reggie, I wonder if you know how much the spoiling of your life will mean the spoiling of mine':" Her voice, or her manner, or her words—or all these combined—affected Mr. Townsend strangely. There seemed to be somctliinc iu her glance which lie found himsolf unable to encounter. He turned aiviv. (ioiag to him, she touched him softly on the arm. A shudder went all over him. The muscles of his face seemed to stiffen: his expression became a little set. His voice also became, as it were, a little rigid. "There may be hope." "There may be? .Reggie;" She paused asif breathless. *'Of laving the ghosts—for ever?" "For ever." She was still asain. Her articulation seemed to be actually impeded. " When will you know—for sure?" " This afternoon, at "Regeie!" His words appeared to take her by surprise. Do you mean it—really?" "ldo." He turned and looked at her. Their glances met.' She shrank a*av from him.
