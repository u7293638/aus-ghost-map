A SUPERSTITION THE CHINESE HOLD. The strange unwillingness Â«f the Chinese to afford help ts a drowning man, or anyone in absolute peril of hiB life, or otherwise, is based upon the belief that the ghOBt of the laEt man killed always acts as watchmaa ' of tbe hades, or pargatorv,' into which, accord ing to Chinees belief, the spirit of tho depar ted first enters, and from which he can only be relieved by the arrival of a frcBh ghost. If, therefore, a man's life be Baved from accidental death, the spirit of the per son who died immediately before him is in a manner cheated out of his relief, and will assuredly haunt the person whose misplaced humanity hae condemned it to a tresh term of servitude.
