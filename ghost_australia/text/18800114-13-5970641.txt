A tissue of misrepresentations has been put before the public with regard to the new mail contract by the old advocates of the now discarded Cape route. Their failure Yvith regard to the Cape service has in no way taught these self-satisfied persons modesty, nor has it in any way enlightened them. If we had not been successful in resisting their in- trigues and their crazes, the colony would have been committed to the support of a second-rate line by a second-rate route, and wo should be absolutely paying money to drive away the magnificent vessels which the Orient line and Messrs. MONEY WIGRAM and Sons are now run- ning with brilliant success via the Suez Canal. The Cape of Good Hope contract would havo established a mono- poly, and would have shut these modern vessels out. Our policy of giving the mails to the lowest tenderers, and-of leaving the carrying trade free to be competed for by the world, has been justified by results; for this year a magnificent ocean steamship, of a size, power, and speed undreamed of before, will leave Melbourne, and will go via the canal, in 1 stead of crawling via the Cape ; and all this without the colony being a shilling out of pocket, and with an active competition which must result iu i further improvement still going on. This is most satisfactory. But the dis 1 comfited Cape route ring must still alternately snarl and romance. Three allegations were madeyesterday-1. That Mr. BERRY has adopted Tlie Argus policy of a " hook-on" service, and of removing the terminus from Melbourne. 2. That the result of this arrangement is that all the ocean steamers now ignore Melbourne, 3\. That our farmers have been deprived of the advantage of shipping dead- weight at a nominal freight. We shall dispose of these mendacious absurdities seriatim. With regard to the first assertion, wo may remark that Tlie Argus has no policy in favour of a hook-on service, nor 1 of making Melbourne merely a port of call. We have favoured open competi- tion as against proposed private arrange- ments to bo made by individual Minis- ters with friendly firms. Our systematic advice has been to accept the lowest trust- worthy offer, to take the tender which gave the most for the money, whether the tenderers were the P. and 0. Com- pany or the Orient line, or Messrs MONEY WIGRAM and Sons or Messrs. GREEN and Co., or any new firm. And as to making Melbourne the terminus, we supported Mr. FR VNCIS in achieving that end in 1873 as against Mr. BERRY, who (vide Hansa?d, vol. IG, page 188) argued against the plan on the ground that the arrangement cost .£50,000 per annum, and that wo had no right to incur such an expenditure for any such purpose. Circumstances havo changed since then. The railway to Sydney \\\ill bo completed in a few months, and Melbourne will then be the natural entrepot as regards mails and passengers. Both tvill embark here, and whether we should insist upon the steamer remaining in Melbourne under such circumstances, or should allow bol- to go for her coals instead of having her coals brought to her, is a mere matter of £ s. d. Under the circumstances, the wisest courso would have been to call for alternative tenders, in older that wo might see the cost, and decide with our eyes open, and it is no fault of ours that this common-sense step was not taken, And so far from Mr. BERRY having willingly accepted the P. and 0. service, owing to the wiles of The Argus, it is notorious that tho service in question was forced upon him under the conditions of tender which wore submitted to Parliament, which we criticised, but which were warmly ap- proved of by the Ministerial party and the Ministerial press. Schedule A was for a direct service to Melbourne, and to Melbourne alone, and it was well under- stood to be framed in the interests of a particular company. At any rate, it is well-known that the intention of Minis- ters was to accept a contract under schedule A. But Mr. BERRY could not obtain a single offer. Ile could get no English firm to entertain the idea of limiting its operations to the protec- tionist port. Every effort was made to induce the orient line to come to tho front. Mr. BERRY had repeated inter- views with the directors, and ho could get no definite proposals from them, and the directors put on record that they " refrained from tendering . . " . . because they knew that the " amount of tho subsidy which would " be necessary to maintain the service " wouldbemorothantherewasanychance " of the colony agreeing to pay." On the other hand, the P. and 0. Company put in a tender for " a three-port" service at a price so low that it took evoryone by surprise, and the agent-general for South Australia wrote to the Govern- ment, " In the event of the P. and 0. " offer not being accepted by the Vic- torian Government, they will at once '" make a contract with us." Thus, wo are under no obligation to Mr. BERRY, nor is ho under any to us. Ho did not conclude a contract for a direct line of steamers with Melbourne as the solo port of call, bccauso he could get no firm to um such a line at any price. He accepted the P. and O. offer, because if he liad not done so South Austialia would, and Victoria would havo been left in the cold. The second assertion, that the conse- quence of allowing the P. and 0. boats to go on to Sydney is " that all our " ocean steamers now ignore Mel " bourne except as a port of call," has only to be stated to bo laughed at. Tho Orient liners commenced tho " three-port service " two years ago, when Melbourno Svas the terminus of the mail service, as it is to this day. Their tactics proved successful. They established at once a now trade because a fast steamer seeks for first-class freights (on which a special rato is paid in con- sideration of expedition) and also for a full passenger list, and tho three ports filled up a vessel which could not obtain a paying cargo if it confined itself to one. The Orient example of using the Suez Canal has been followed, and so has the Orient plan of going the rounds of the ports, but as this system was initiated two years ago, when Melbourne was the mail terminus, how can it bo attributed to an event Yvhich has yet to come to passl So with the third allegation, that if Melbourne had been made the terminus of a direct lino tho farmers could havo obtained cheap freight for their Yvheat. The obvious reply is that wo could not get a direct line. It must also be pointed out that the quantity of wheat which fast ocean steamers aro likely to carry homo will always be very small, and will never affect tho freight market ono Yvay or the other. The farmers will also see that if wo paid one line of vessels to load I here, we should simply drive away another line, and a tendency to monopoly can never benefit them. What they require ' is that Melbourno should be a contre of commerce, ships coining in with cargoes and loading with produce, wo exchang I ing our Yvheat and wool for the goods ef 'the world. The more shipping the I lower tho freights, and, therefore, what tho .farmers need is a Government Yvhich will not try to stamp out com- merce as this Government tries, and i which Yvill not obstinately stand in the way of the harbour improvements necessary to enable ships to load cheaply in Melbourne as this Govern- ment stands. To drive away the , merchant vessels which could help the farmer, and to whine about an un i attainable direct lino of steamers which would not help him to any appreciable extent, is simply to insult once more the intelligence of that long-suffering indi- vidual. Probably the belief is- to alter slightly the words of a democratic .authority-" What can a man fol i " lowing the plough know about ship . " ping matters 1" In duo course, we believe it will bo found that , the fanner doe3 know a great deal. Ho is quite shrewd enough to realise that the best way to obtain low freights is to open the poits to all ships and all line3, and not to make an effort to restrict tlio carrying trado to ono. The missing of 350,000 men on tho Polish f ion tier of Germany by Russia is certainly a very ominous fact, especially when taken in conjunction with a despatch from Bellin published in the Standard about two months ago, according to which Prince BISMARCK. asked the Russian Goveinment to Yvith diaw from the German border 20,000 [cavalry which were being manoeuvred there For it will not bo forgotten that the quarrel Yvith Austria originated m a somewhat similar proceeduig He asked the Court at Vienna what it meant by making military preparations'! The reply was that nono were in pro gress BISM\RCK refused to accept the assurance He had already secured tho neutrality of Trance and Russia, and 'on the 8th of April, 18G6, had con eluded a secret alliance with Italy Therefore he was in no mood to listen to pacific protestations But Austria went further As a test of its sincenty it proposed a simultaneous disarma ment This was out of tho question So was the confeienco proposed by the Emperor of theliiENCH It would havo upset all Punco BISYI VRCK'S projects Ile was afiaid, as BENI DrTTi tells ih>, that if heY\ent to Paris an interview mitait take place between the King of PRUSSIA and the Emperor of Ausiitu, and that i reconciliation would take place "His fears in this respect are so " keen, ' said the 1 ronch ambxssador, " that he intends to follow the KIM in " the campaij.li in case war should be " declaied, which ho did Having completely isolated Austua in 18CC, Punco BISMIPCK fell upon her, and administered the crushing defeat of Sadowa, aftei a seven weeks' campaign In 1870 ho isolated Tiance, after fooling NUOLLON III to the top of his bent, and tho Empito fell, and with it the military supremacy of the Tiench nation on tho Continent, at Sedan According to what his been lifehtlj called " a lemail aMe aiticle in the last number of the Ldmbuigh lie via , Prince BISMARCKS îeceiit policy has been to isolate Russia also having fust of all goaded hei on to embuk in the Ru«so Turkish wai, in which it was me\ itablo that she mutt sacrifico hun di eds ol thousands of men and millions of treasuie It seems that theie was one stage of the negotiations prior to tho crossing of tho Pruth, when peaco was possible At this juncture, tho astute diplomatist sent foi tlio Russian Ambassadoi in Berlin, M D OUBRIL, and said to lum, "I heat that your Emperor is wavering " I know Russia He is lost if he draws "back Theie is no other chance left " to him but war " And as Russia bad earned tho gratitude of Germany by standing sentinel ovei her bad door while she was engaged m tin ashing Tranco at tho front, the C¿AR may have conceived that this was the advice of a grateful and sinceie fueiw At any rate, it was acted upon, and a war was enteied into, necessitating the emplojment of two vast armies, the one m Asia Minor and tho other on tho Danube, at an immense distance from the chief sources of supply, and tllS result was tho imposition of a severo and protracted stiain upon tho resources of tho Russian empire After the fa'1 of Plevna, remarks the reviewer, Prince BI&MABCI..; "could not over *' look the fact that, if Russia was *' left to dictate the terms of peace, " she would be mistress of the East ; " that the creation of Slav principalities " under a Russian protectorate would " exert upon the kindred nationalities " of Austria a disintegrating influence ; " that tho aggrandisement of Russia "threatens the mteiests of Germany, " and makes hor a still moie desirable " allyt for Franco." " Ho could not, " however, openly thwart the results of " the Russian policy, his master being " scarcely less Russian than the Km " peror ALEXANDER.'' Accoidingly the German Chancellor lent his assist- ance to the lcpresontitives of the other great poweis in getting up the Berlin Congress, at which the conclusions anived at are known to havo been so distasteful to Russia, while they have seemed to Austria most of tho advantages aimed at by the CZAR, and have placed the Austrian KAISER at the -head of the Slavonic nationalities in tho south of Europe. Since then, the Austro-German alliance has been entered into, and, as we may reasonably infer that Prince BISMARCK has not neglected to take the necessary steps either ,for propitiating or for checkmating France, Russia may bo regarded as standing piactically alone in Europe. Of late a strong anti-Russian feeling has been per- mitted, if not encouraged, in the Ger- man press, and the great Minister's sudden conversion to protection was brought about by his determination to inflict a heavy blow on Russian indus tiies and to render himself independent of the Legislature for supplies. He is so now, as the customs revenue of the empire is at the disposal of the Executive, and the Executive is Prince BISMARCK. Then, too, the purchase of the German rail- ways by the state, which has just been sanctioned by tho Legislature at his instigation, will enable the Government to mobilise the army, and to move it upon any particular point or points with the utmost celerity, and in total disiegard of public convenience and of the requirements of the ordinary traffic. All these things point to war, and Russia probably anticipates that the stoim will burst next time over her own tenitories, and that the events of 18GG and 1870 may bo repeated upon Rus- sian soil in 1880. Hence the massing -of such a large army on the Polish frontier, which may be equivalent to the announcement, "We are ready." In what light it may be regarded by Piince BISMARCK remains to bo seen. The most serious obstacle to a rupture between Germany and Russia is the Emperor WILLIAM'S affection for his nephew. On the other hand, the Geiman EMPEROR is old and super- stitious, and his great Minister has expeiienced no difficulty on former occasions in persuading his Imperial master that he was fulfilling a great mission of PROVIDENCE, and that tho success of his arms was partly the result of Divine favour. Noi must we lose sight of the fact that Germany is honeycombed by socialism, and that the political and social dis- content of which this is the expression is certain to be greatly intensified by tlie scarcity and misery which protec- tion will inflict upon the working classes. " A policy of aggression and a " foreign war," romarked a distinguished diplomat at Vienna, a few years ago, " will become a necessity or a safety " valve for the German Government, " when, menaced internally by passions " it cannot repress, it must, at any " price, divert the ardour of its popu " íations towards another object in " order to escape from ruin." For to " busy giddy minds with foreign " quarrels," as SUAKSPEARE puts it, is a device of statecraft as old as policy itself.

It is not intended as a plan- tation to display a variety of trees, but lather as tlio Bhado of one description " long drawn out." Its component parts should therefore bo as nearly as poasiblo of one size and foliage, so that there may bo nothing to disturb or break tho aenso of continuity. As our correspondent points out, " Collins-street and Drum " mond- stroet aro most conspicuous for " want of uniformity." Thon, again, it is said, with obvious propriety-" All " dead trees should bo replaced by live "ones of equal growth." This require- ment is, as a ralo, overlooked. Out of tlio number of troca planted a certain perccntago inevitably die, but in htoad of being at once changed-i.e., within the same planting season-they aro allowed to remain cumbering tho ground. When after a timo tlioy aro replaced no caro appears to bo takon to próvido substitutes as far forward in growth ns tho rest of tho plantation. Tlio consequence hereafter in such cases must bo an unsightly irregu- larity. As a general rule, our correspon- dent considers that trees should not bo nearer than 40ft. togothor. Wo think this is rathol' an excessive distance, if wo want that uninterrupted shade which is auch a groat desideratum during our floreo Australian summerp. However, this is a point on which prac- tical arboriculturists could bost give an opinion. Tho advocates of sparso plant- ing must remember that it is vory easy to " thin out " trees when they get too largo for such close proximity as may be at first given them. As regards tho trees near tho Town-hall, " Avenue " says thoy " aro planted too near each othor, and as " one or two aro doad, every alternate " troo might bo taken up and roplaco " thoBO that are doad." That they aro too close is evident oven already, but our correspondent is in error in supposing that any aro doad. Tho two or throo which ho imagines have given up the ghost aro fresh plantations- of a sort, however, differing entirely from the elms into tho midst of which thoy havo been introduced. Wo montion this because it exemplifies the careless way in - wihich tlio work of planting is boing carried on. It is a great pity that care- lessness of this or any sort should bo displayed. Trees cannot bo grown in a day, and it would bo very mortifying if, after waiting for years to produce tho effect wo covot, we should find it marred in any way by faults arising from negli- gence or want of judgment. Mr. CARTER lias taken a great interest in street-plant- ing, and wo commend the foregoing ro inarks to his consideration. If tho thing is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.
