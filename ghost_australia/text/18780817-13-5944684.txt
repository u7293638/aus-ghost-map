THE MINISTER OF LANDS AGAIN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARCHES. Sir-Your lately exposed the grossly unjust action of our Minister of Lands in the matter , of a selection by the son of a once squatter, Whittaker Perhaps you will allow me to draw your attention to another case wherein it seems to me, our Minister of Lands has degraded the office he holds, and committed a gross injustice to upwards of one hundred persons I can the more readily express my opinions and state the case because I am unacquainted with any of the parties An allotment of land in the parish of Toorak was open for selection ¡ upwards of one hundred persons pegged this one lot A land board was appointed, of one of Mr Long more's officials from Melbourne, the local receiver of revenue and the president of the shire After an interesting examination of the applications, a man named Mulhern was indicated by the land board as the one to got the allotment The Minister of Lands gave it to a different person altogether, a man named Munro Hero comes a most interesting part of the case why should Munro get it, the land, when he already owns land' Why don't you see? Munro canvassed for Dwyer in the late election, and the learned Jeremiah went to the Minister with Munro, Longmore j fielded where Woods would have not From this you may clearly see that the land board was a sham, and so was the proclamation, but the state benefited to the tune of upwards of £100, as each applicant deposited his £1, for which they had not the ghost of a chance What a comfortable feeling to those unfortunates-the trouble, expense, and now to see they were sold Common honesty demands that this money should be returned The honourable Minister of Lands ought Burel j, now he receives the pay of the state, to do a little justice to those who have to raise that money He ought, if he can, to rise above him Belt and up to the impartiality his office de mains What a nice pair we have in the Minster and in Mr Dwyer the latter gentleman failed when he tried to influence Woods for Kelly, but he succeeds with Long- more for Munro He must be a splendid representative Mr Dwyer knows how to work the oracle What a mortal pity there are not many good allotments of land to select m Villiers and Heytesbury We can now see what made him so anxious to be a member Oh, yes , just nothing I Onlj little acts of kindness A little time ago Mr Berry was going to annual how large landed estates were put together He may now turn his attention to small estates and he will find that Mr Longmore can tell him nearly as much on that question as Smith and Grant can about large estates 'The people of the colony can now place at its just estimate Mr Longmore s indignation at land swindles -I am, etc , THOMAS SHAW.
