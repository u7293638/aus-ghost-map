PROFESSOR RICE'S MYSTERI OUS AND SCIENTIFIC EN TERTAINMENTS. Professor Rice gave two of his really wonderful mind-reading entertainments in the Town Hall, Beechworth, on Tues day and Wednesday evenings to large -and appreciative audiences. His tests were so marvellous and thoroughly successful, that at the request of a number of our lead ing citizens he has consented to give another entertainment in the Oddfellows' Hall this (Thursday) evening, when new features will be introduced in a starting programme. This being the last appearance of the professor in Aus tralia, before proceeding to India, be will present some astonishing novelties â€” among others reading the mind by means of a common fiiece of copper wire some thirty feet in length, objects being caused to float in the air for several minutes over the heads of the audience, and the triumph of mind over matter will be fully demonstrated. The raising of the ghost is very startling and inexplicable and is alone well worth the price of admission to see. Aliss Alartineau will also appear in some of her specialties.
