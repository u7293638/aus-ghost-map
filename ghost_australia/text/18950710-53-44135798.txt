THE EDUCATION OF NERVOUS CHILDREN. IT ia difficult to exaggerate the evil that may be worked upon a nervous child by the tales of ghosts, robbers, bogiea, or policemen, with which many children are continuously indulged. The inculcation of the precepts of'religion also too often becomes the means by which terrifying ideas are implanted in the infant mind, much td the disturbance of that peacefulness during the hours of rest which is essential to its normal development It is pitifnl to think of the number of children who instead of dropping into dreamless slumber look forward to bedtime asa time of terror, bury their faces in the bedclothes, and only when exhausted fall asleep, haunted by visions of a constant all seeing eye, by dread of unending torments for each unforgiven, maybe forgotten, little fault, and by fear of lightning and other natural phenomena which they have been taught are instruments of wrath. From all such thoughts the developing brain should be protected. But later cn, when education, as it is now understood, begins, the child among whose ancestors neuroses have pre vailed requires evenmore protection, for every influence is often brought to bear to disturb, his mental equilibrium. If he is dull and backward he is punished ; if he is bright, intelligent, and precocious he becomes the pride of his. teachers, and is set to win scholarships for the glory of his Behool. In either case he is exposed to the very turmoil of mind. from which he should be"most protected!-The Hospital.
