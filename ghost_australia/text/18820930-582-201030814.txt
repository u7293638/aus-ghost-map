< MELBOURNE. (prom our own correspondent.) Fridav evening. On medical authority I observe the statement I made yesterday ob to Sir John O'Shanassy's : dangerous but not desporato condition, is denied. I sincerely . trust . the medical authority may prove correct, though my information ; is do- rived from ,a. source more nearly rolatod, and ; more likely to be accurato than oven tho attend ant surgeon. . The caretaker of: the publio buildings; Mr O Mearn, has been suspended along with his ac cuser, Mr John Barry, an offico-clcaner, and a departmental .board will shortly report upon them. Mr O'Meara is an old Civil Bervant, liav- entered into State work in 1859. His hand was shattered years ago, and since then other duties nave been found for him. I confess it Booms to me unlikely that the charges made against him will ever be sustained. They are, briefly,' tljht he anpliqd Gqyernment property to. his'own pur- poees, that' lie ush'd Staro "paid "te&6ur''' to" make' the furniture of his dwellingiSoiisef arid tiiftt he 'cpiivettbd Goveinmont materials to his' own' use; But all the charges are frivolous; andinvolvo no offence oft whioh d'pulioe court1 could take cog- nisanoe, - . - . 7 ,1/ Dr. Youl' lias reported on '- the' Hamilton case, bi)t?hi8..statoment is feeble in thpi extremq;- and oply coptajns .tho, ono. point; thalj popular ppqfu. lar vesicular eruptions ware present on the patient Wright at one time, ;qnd that no aureola marked the base of the populro. Beyond this there is little worth communicating. . ; : Tlie annual meeting of the shareholders in tho Australian Allinnoe Assurance Company was hold to-day.
