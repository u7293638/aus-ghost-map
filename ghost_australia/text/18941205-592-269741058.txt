In tho Straggle For X,lfe» In tropical countries, where the strug gle for life seems to rage even fiercer than in the temperate regions, a vast number of animals have been driven by want to seek their livelihood in the dark through stress of competition. There are the howler monkeys, for example, who make night hideous in large tracts of South American forest, beginning their dismal music as soon ns evening sets in and only retiring for the day as dawn purples the hornon. . There are the lemurs of Madagascar, so called because, like ghosts, they walk by night and withdraw at cockcrow— strange, stealthy, noiseless creatures, with great, wistful, poetical eyes and en larged pupils; monkeys that prey on birds and insects in the gloomy depths of their native forests. There is the slen der loris, a graceful and beautiful beast, with eyes like a gazelle's, but treacher ous manners, who pounces upon birds as they sleep in their little nests, creeping silently upon them from behind like an Indian upon the warpath, and affording no indication of his hateful presence till he is within arm’s reach of his slumber ing victim. These are but a few of the nocturnal mammals of the monkey and lemur type, ancient ancestors of bur own, gone wrong through keeping such very late hours, and^now stranded for the most part in islands or peninsulas of extreme antiqui ty.—Comhill Magazine.
