MICHIE AND MOORE IN HOTHAM WARD. TO THE EDITOR OF THE AGE. Sir, â€” "Junius Secundus" of to-days Argus is to be taken as an example and specimen of North Melbournites, delirium tremens must be the pre vailing malady amongst us. Read his effusion : a trembling pen, which can only be caused by a shaking hand ; a vision the ghosts of Pym, Hampden, and Hamlet ; O'Shanassy the villain, Duffy the humbug, all gloriously huddled together, must convince every reader that the writer left the bar of the "George" in a state of high nervous excitement, and passed the night in seeing visions and lighting with ghosts. His letter is altogether visionary. Whatever may have happened to Messrs Michie and Moore after leaving North Melbourne, nothing was at tempted against their persons when there and when leaving the place of meeting. If any person whatsoever had intended per sonal violence, although the majority of the meeting were opponents to Michie and Moore, he would have been secured on the spot, and given into custody. The present cowardly out cry is most probably nothing but a dodge, and an attempt to represent Hotham Ward as a locality inhabited by rowdies, which should not be allowed to pass unnoticed. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, JUNIUS NON- TREMENS. May 11th, 1857.
