LONDON TOWN HALL. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, Nov. 3. The most excellent news often reaches n from the most distant places, but unhappily it is not always true The City of New York, in its last week a edition supplied us with a piece of information about our own affairs, not only novel, but satisfactory to me in the highest degree It seems if the Court is to be believed, that after a long and obstinate resistance against the growing custom of printing serial stones in newspapers The Times at last has given in town "Messrs Lippincott,' says that admirable journal have in the press a new novel called Portion of Bar Passions Backed, now running as a aerial in the London Times I read my Tunes carefully, but I have never read in it one word of " By Passions Backed ' There is, indeed, a novel of that name appearing in the magazine called Time Is it possible that the scribe of the Critic has confused it withthegreatorganofPrinting house square' A publisher in the Athenaeum once more bewails the miserable condition in which both his own time and authors are placed through the new registration of the titles of books, so that no one knows, or can possibly know, in publishing a work whether he is infringing some unknown person a copyright or not He pleads for " compulsory registration of titles at Stationers hall, an institution which only registers authors names, and B, therefore, useless, but that would only remedy matters in the future for the next 40 years writers would find themselves exposed to the same perils as at present What would be much more efficacious would be to form a fund for the defence of the nett author or publisher who falls into the pitfall If such a one had the pluck or the money to stand to his guns and fight the case, I believe no judge would given against him The suggestion. of the law It of course, that A takes B s title of malice prepense, hoping to steal some popularity for his own book through its being mistaken for By book, but no such case has ever happened The confusion always arises by accident, Boroo totally unknown title of some totally unknown book is mad vertently borrowed, and B, its unknown author, or still more likely its unknown but enterprising publisher, exacts black mail i c , compensation for nothing He has not lost a halfpenny by the coincidence of names on the contrary, he very likely given by it since the only chance his book bas is to be mistaken for some other, but nevertheless the idea of an injunction in Chancery 13 so terrifying, from its cost, that the robbery is almost always effected The most recent hardship of this kind has happened, I hear in the case of the novel Thick a than Water commencing in Messrs Longmans new magazine It appears that some story 111 the family JNoiekt'e was published under this title, and Messrs Long mann have accordingly paid forfeit for the permission to use it in this case the ransom is understood to have been moderate but that there should have been any necessity for ransom at all is surely outrageous Can it he seriously contended that a popular author would have stolen his title from a story in the family NoiektU, with the object of advantage' A churchwarden in Leicestershire has" been complaining to his bishop of the custom of certain churchgoers who, " conside in their religious duties the over when they have joined in the service walk out when the sermon begins He appeals to his lordship as to whether he cannot detain these in patient and imperfect worshippers by force and whether the offence does not come under the head of brawling One can imagine the biShop for it is ho of Peterborough having a humorous twinkle in his eye as he reply to, ' Well, my dear sir, abstention or even withdrawal is scarcely brawling li can only say that it is very wrong Dis cussing this matter in the club smoking room the other night I was very strong on the churchWarden e side " If the offence is not brawling,, he argued it is infamous taste and a positive insult to the preacher " But if, urge 1 another, the clergyman is known to be dull and wearisome - "That is no excuse fire broke in a indignantly , ' when I go to church it is my duty to conform to all the asses of the sacred edifice, and not to make an invi brue exception, calculated to wound the feelings of the officiating minister "But do you ever go to church asked his opponent persistently " Well no, sir, admitted A, "I can t say I ever do ' Long ago in Cambridge University there was a society formed for the investigation of Spiritual Phenomena, popularly known as " The Ghost Club, and some very strange stones were elicited by its operations In these later days it has again started into being under a still finer name The Society for Psychical Research Unfortunately, the investigations are to include spirit rapping, which is not only a delusion, but a very vulgar and mercenary form of delusion, not worth the attention of any sensible or even honest person If the society would stick to ghosts, and cut out all knockings, and trappings, and moving of furniture from their programme, it might once more be the means of giving us some interesting narratives It ought, however, to be a sine (qua non that they should be told at first hand Even then, it is well to prepare them with I would not have believed they had I not seen it with my own eyes 1 Inch Vlacea overs reader in a comfortable position, and does away with antago made, for my part I delight 111 ghost stories, but there is one thing which is always an obstacle to my belief in them I have a very large acquaintance but I have only met with two persons, not habitual liars, who lay claim to having seen a ghost And the experience has not made any serious impression upon either of them Now, if a man, no matter how frivolous and unthinking he knew he, did really believe that he had been a messenger from the other world, he would be very seriously impressed He would think about it a great deal and talk about it very little Whereas, I find the exact contrary to be the case with these gentlemen They have told their stories indeed so often that they have really got to believe them, and are no more open to censure upon the ground of false hood than a man in the habit of using strong language IS morally guilty for saving-well " dear me ' An Australian lady, of whom I am sure you are proud, Mrs Campbell, has added her name, as it seems to us in England, to the true glory roll of humanity Being on the deck of a Queensland steamer, she saw a little boy carried overboard through a lurch of the vessel, and without waiting for a life buoy, or to divest herself of any clothing, she plunged into the sea and saved him She did, however, before making her plunge, Bay Something which considering the circumstances was as fine a thing as ever was said by a Nelson or a Lcomdaa "Do not tell his mother Conceive the tender thoughtfulness that dictated such a speech at such a time An excellent lady has died at Peters Gold, who, while leaving all her property to her husband for life, had afterwards 'taken thought of the dumb creation She has bequeathed £6 000 to the Society for the Pre ^fP*,îon of Cruelty to Animals, and £1,000 to the Home for Lost and Starving Dogs Of course the good lady loved a cat and a black cat, but what is very curious alle leaves directions that this favourite animal is to be destroyed under chloroform immediately after her death, Could she not trust those who survived her to take due care of it, I wonder ? or was it some vague association of feeling with that which prompts the dying Indian to sacrifice his dog, and the Hindoo his widow ? My own impression is, that she expected to find that cat again, though probably under other circumstances It need to be a sort of social problem with I budding mathematicians at Cambridge how the sale of The Times newspapers under esr tam circumstances might become a lost through its very magnitude Such a state of affairs' now that the paper duty has been repealed, is probably impossible with any news paper, no matter how large it circula- tion But it is still possible with magazines I know a case where £800 was lost by the advertisements of a first number A certain circulation was calculated upon, and the rats of charges suited to it, but the success was so much greater than was expected, that the expense of the paper on which the advertisements were printed vastly exceeded the sum paid for them It is said that something of this kind has happened with Longman's Magazine, the sale of which has largely surpassed the modest 60,000 anticipated by its proprietors and on which their scale of charges was based This, however, is an evil that is soon remedied It is generally acknowledged to be a marvellous Sixpennyworth. The Spectator, in a very interesting article upon the popularity of certain writers, essays to show how much better would have chosen than Messrs Longman It would have had an article against the Government by Sir Michael Hicks Beach, and one in its favour by Professor Bryce, it would have had a long poem upon Egypt by Mr Edwin Arnold, and a paper on the Apocalypse by Canon Farrar The S; dictator IS an honest and able paper, but I don't think it under stands the sixpenny public In my opinion the magazine is much more suitable to its purpose as it stands, though I have my views about its improvement I don't think the Burenny public cares much about " More cured, and I am certain it does not care about Lexington, USA Without wishing to wound the feelings of the many eminent writers who have contributed to this famous first number, I he is on the best authority that its principal attraction was the story by Mr. Anstey Everyone was curious to see how the young author of Vice Versa would acquit himself - in my judgment a very promising storyteller his extreme vivacity and brightness are apt to blind the reader to the carefulness of his style Note for example in Kic-" Ferai how, when Mr Bultitude escaped to the railway station, he creeps " under the Roman noses of the mild cab horses which might well be taken for The true Dickens I have, often insisted in these columns upon the plagiarism which is constantly taVtng I luce in nature, or the course of human events, from Viction In Mrs Oliphant's Canon the heroine, or some important female character, feeling herself about to perish slowly from a cruel disease, persuades her child to get her a bottle of poison from the medicine chest In Chester last week, a sergeant of militia shot himself with a rule placed on the floor, the trigger of which he gets his unconscious son of four years old to pull It was a selfish act on the I part of the suicide, since sooner or later the little fellow will probably come to know what he did, but so far as the, pit Mariam goes Iehould doubt it being wilful Though Mrs Oliphant s books are BE popular with respectable novel readers as Ouida with the loose ones I don't believe the sixpenny public (which includes the militia) read her A gentleman in the city who having met with commercial misfortunes 12 years ago had to ask for time to pay his creditors has done so in a very honest manner they have given him a steam launch and his wife a bracelet set with dia moi 38 in consequence I confess I think this rather a reflection upon city men Is it so very unusual for a man who has failed in business, and afterwards succeeds to pay his old debts' It is of course quite right to do it, but would it not also be very queer not to do it' I am not a man of business myself, but looking at the matter as one would look at any transaction of ordinary life, such abstinence would surely be very like sheer roguery ' Is it possible that honour in the city means keeping clear of disgrace' 1 A strange but well authenticated Story, says a scientific journal, comes from Szeged This is very cunningly put I would be just as easy to add where Szeged wiB (and even while they are about it, how to pronounce it), but editors of scientific journals know better than that They say ' from Szeged, as they would say from Bath or Bristol, and leave the general public in a rapture at their geographical knowledge when it comes to the story itself, however, the scientific organ is not so very well in formed It tells how one Muller bought four cigars and while in the middle of the second, it exploded, having a tube within it filled with nitro-glycerine This is an outrage it seems absolutely unparalleled in the records of science Very likely, yet nothing used to be more common among schoolboys than " surprise cigars cigars filled, not, indeed, with nitro glycerine, but with a little gunpowder stuck in the middle of them Mr Muller a experience was however a much more serious one, and what makes it worse is that " tobacco is a monopoly of Government in the place in question It is therefore obviously most important not to buy cigars imported from the country in which Szeged is situated and the scientific editor has not the common sense to tell us where it is If there is one thing I dislike more than science it is pretence It is curious how some people will stick to the delusion that all men ought to be governed till e-that the Inch and the captains and the Chinese, for example, have the same liiMligenco Mid sense of right that the nabob have Of the two former we have lately had some pretty specimens Here a one which I have just had from an eye witness culled from China Sir John Bowring, was as every one knows, British Consul in those parts and a man of eminently British views [To thought a Chinaman as good as an 1 englishman, and better too and that the nation only required a little French mi to appreciate the ballot and a reform Bill He had also advanced views oven for a Briton, and was vehemently opposed to the punishment of death One day he met a young Englishman (Jones) dragging into the consulate a Chinese by his pigtail, who in his turn was dragging a dog by a string " What are you doing with that poor Chinaman' inquired Sir John He has stolen my dog, meaning to make him into a puppy pie, see, he was tied him to his wrist ' And what are you going to do with him, Jones' "I am going to give him fits, returned the young gentleman "You will do nothing of the kind, sir give him to me So the Chinaman was given up, and Sir John sent him with a neat note to the Teepo (native governor), explaining that the man had stolen a dog, and that, unwilling to take the law into his own hand, he delivered him up to the proper authorities We This was at 10 o'clock in the morning. At 1, while Sir John and Jones, my informant were sitting at lunch in the consulate, a messenger arrived from the Teepo " Show him in, cried Sir John " we shall now hear how your dogatealer has been dealt with, Jones, by those who alone have any jurisdiction over here The messenger entered with a bucket " thereupon compliments, and justice has been done, he said And he turned over the bucket and the dog stealer a head rolled upon the Door. A STRANGE report comes from Szeged, in Austria An engineer named Muller, employed in the works of reconstruction, bought four cigars When be had smoked about one half of the second he laid it on his writing table, when it exploded, throwing him off his chair, and wounding him on the cheek, the ears, the lips, and the left hand Inquiry showed that there had been a glass tube inside filled with nitro-glycerine As tobacco is a monopoly, and all articles supplied by the Government are manufactured and sold by dealers licensed by them, the mystery seems still greater
