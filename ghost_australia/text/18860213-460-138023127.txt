The cause of liis early death was lved to be a caustic review of his poems, as such was accepted both by the Hip cynicism of Byron and by the generous tion of Shelley— ohu Keats who was hilled off by one critique, u„t as bo really promised something great. traiVc that the mind, tiiat very fiery particle, hould lot itself bo snuff'd out by an article," ley thus addresses the reviewer— o thou whoso infamy is not thy Fame, jvc, fear no heavier chastisement from me, ou noteless blot on a rcmcmbcr'd name, tcmorsc and dread shall ever cling to thee, t Shanic shall bum upon thy worthless brow, d, like a beaten hound, tremble tbou ehalt as iow." lie friends of the poet claim that he died of ,rcle, independently of the critic, and had high an estimate of and too well-founded ist in posterity to quail beneath this stab ie love of fame. Still, no thanks to the tarla-ly, Savage, and Tartarly." [unnot recall without emotion the abid grief of Lambe at losing Coleridge, iths after the death of his friend, Lambe overheard muttering to himself, "Cole e—is—dead," "dead." L. died of cry las brought on by an accident. He was a man of large imagination or of exten sympathies, and such a friend as the oeopher of liighgate was not easily to be aced. 'hen the Lucknow atrocities reached Eng | a spirited poem appeared in London if//, urging Lord Clyde to Retribution, •y verse ending with the Scriptural re n— at thy foot- may be dipt In the blood ot thy foe, Ainl the tongue of thy dogs may be red through the same." i bard's muse bade him to " Rage, and not 3p." Iy gratitude to Mr. Stead for his "dis tures " is about as scant as is my pity for [ imprisonment, which I do not deem fere or unmerited. He told to the educated [experienced nought that they were unin ped of, and to the ignorant and weak Ight that it profited them to learn. Of I the public has now before it a Bad and ieuing proof in the Coburg tragedy. I el no scruple in avowing my deep com Bion for these poor invalid patients,whom B impossible to regard as criminals. At it they have punished more than sufli itly both themselves and each other, ere is the man that would not share last coin to contribute to their nation, if cure be hopeless? The d idea of contingent danger, worse than .tli, sank into the weak mind of the ubling mother. No friendly adviser was f' to pour corrective ana consoling pre 9, to point out how easily the dreaded can be eluded, or even combated, to urge It anything is a less evil than despair. For |h God aud man are ho less severe in visit weakness than in punishing guilt. The [g prophet was spared to say of his trust crcuulous dupe (whose only fault was i iplaccd trust), "Alas, my brother! Layl beside him." The " weak brother" was ] led by a lion (1 Kings xiiL, v. 18). |elter had the poor creatures remained in lorauce of past and distant perils, as yet jtc vincible in our adopted home. Nature lot so poor. I firmly believe that it is in i power of a sensible young girl, well' >ught up, to take effectual care ot herself, 3 to defy all the insidious euarcs of mer-1 nry depravity and coid-blooded Vice. 0 much care cannot be bestowed on the litary requisites of a crowded city. The amp should be drained. It diffuses the ■ma of typhoid fever. I would gladly see > establishment of cheap baths aud wash Dees for the very poor. Many vegetable i "tactions are unwisely neglected, as laver sloak), Bea kail, and others. Wc all eat too much of animal food, which we cook (skilfully. And what shall I say of adul ated beverages? The art of preserving 1th is apparently contemned, and the irlatan's harvest is our grossncss in self lulgencc and porcine sensuality, ill madness is partly hereditary and partly 1 growth of germs purely physical. When ireaks forth it is formidable aud difficult cure. Our rulers, while they pity these qc victims of delusion, should take to j imselves repentance and shame that such ngB should be possible in a land so ] ■cured as ours, so tree, and witii so many lilities tor the expression of l'ubiic opinion | d the prompt blazoning of Public wants. Whatever opinion may be ultimately ar edat of the secondary causes or the real J ture of this deplorable heredity, and the palling state of ignorance—nay, of mental [d moral rfai /.ness it supposes—two truths \w vividly demonstrated will be henceforth aiu-nrinted on every sound mind. The Bt, that our rulers have much to lcam; the coud, that our public has much to unlearn, ho can read without wonder, contempt, and rning indignation, the proposal of men liming the nnme of moral and religious tags to send a large sum of money to the uly-punislied misdemeanant, who has thus lutonly polluted and perverted the moral use of the weak? Who can hesitate to enounce on Stead sentence of lteapon Jility to God and to Man for the sufferings, ® ruin, aud the possible impending deaths ihe poor wretched creatures, whose pangs d wnose mental darkness now shake our rves and nppal our souls? I was struck by |e question of a pious, good, and hard fcrfeiug woman, "Is it possible, sir, that ^cm Freethinkers ore collecting money to hd to Stead?" "No," was my answer, pe not unjust even to Freethinkers. It "of they who are guilty of this impro xety, but baptised persons who profess ptlier than adorn) the name of Christian, pen are at variance with St Paul, who liorts ub to consider the weak brother. For lOugh many tilings are lawful, all things are |t expedient," which words 1 interpret thus pse— Hany things we know; some things we tmly believe—however incomplete to others By be our proofB; some things we are in 'tmed of, but suspend our belief; some we Prmise, or suspect, but cannot verify even to Irselves. but very many of each and all of these, it not kind, wise, or expedient to disclose in-!

Truth is like Rut, not bearable by weak eyes ; aud when rung iorward too suddenly is dazzling to c strongest Nature teaches us this lesson tne dawning of every day.
