A True Ghost Story. This is a true English ghost story of an unconventional kind. A young lady ar rived late at night on a visit to a friend. She awoke in the darkness, to find a white figure at the foot of the bed. While she -watched, the bed-clothes were suddenly whisked off and the apparition vanished. After an anxious, not to say chilly, night, the visitor went down, with little appetite, to breakfast. At the table she was intro duced to a gentleman, a very old friend of the family, who had, she learned, also been sleeping in the house. He complained of the cold. " I hope you will excuse me," he said to the hostess, " bat I found it so Cold during the night that, knowing the room next mine was unoccupied, I took the liberty of going in and carrying off the bed-clothes to supplement my own." The room, as it happened, was not unoccupied, but he never learned his mistake.
