LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT ) LONDON, JULY 22 If deception has its limits, the suspicion of deception seems to have none whatever Two eggs of the Great Auk, I read, " declared to be genuine, and to have been discovered in an old private collection in Edinburgh, were sold by auction in King street, Covent garden, last week, for 100 guineas each Of course such eggs are rare, but surely not of so priceless a character as to induce the human mind and body to expend its energies in simulating Great Auk s eggs ' If the articles in question are not what they pretend to be, what, in the name of fortune, is of the It is not as though there are no other Great Auk s eggs in the world with which they can be compared nor, again, is it the case of a bank note which may or may not be a forgery I don't believe Messrs Maskelyne and Cooke themselves, though they do supply we whatever is in demand with such promptitude, could turn out Great Auk s eggs on the spur of the moment or even at considerable notice Upon the whole I am gold these birds are becoming extinct, for pronounce their names as we will the most correctly speaking man in Britain is sure to be suspected of dropping his h a Either the Hawk or the Auk, in common justice to one another, was bound to disappear It is sheer malice, as I conclude, which causes certain persons to destroy the carriage cushions who lever they travel on railways Not a week goes by without people being convicted of such offences, and they certainly get very lightly off The idea of citizenship and "the greatest happiness of the greatest number, is almost entirely absent from the minds of our magistrates , they do not understand that the deliberate attempt to diminish the sum of human comfort is an immorality of the gravest kind, or these men chievous apes would get their deserts The sympathy of the Bench with humour is not generally remarkable, but at Rochdale a mechanic convicted of a murderous attack upon his wife gets only six months imprisonment, on account (or at least there appears no other reason for mitigation) of the drollery with which his crime was committed After assaulting the poor woman so that " she was unconscious and streaming with blood, he besmeared her face with soot, set her up in a chair, and called in the neighbours to look at a Zulu If I had been on that bench of magistrates I might perhaps have been tickled as they were with the excessive fun of this performance, but (by way of carrying on the joke I would most certainly have introduced the humourist to the Cat of nine tails The Dunmow Flitch was given away as usual on the 26th of this month, to any married couple who are willing to swear before a jury that they have lived together in unbroken amity for a year and a day The mistake of this admirable institution seems to me to be its having s". 2s- Tin. posed of euuiJciio star Laclielors How should t/iei/knowunytlungabout the disputes of Talford life On fare contrary, it should consist of the longest (and oftenest) married couples procurable, in which case the cross examination (under the head of by a juror ) would be really worth hearing On what admirably good behaviour, by the bye, intending candidates must be as they near the period of probation One can imagine on the slightest cloud appearing on the brow of the husband, the lady saying, "My dear, the 1 htch on which it instantly vanishes On the 27th, however, human nature probably asserts itself, and he beats her about the head with a poker Achormins thing in railway frauds has just been discovered, and one which really does great credit to human ingenuity Five passengers have to come every day, Bay from York to London [I am of course taking a tie curious case], and they pick up a friend of theirs at Peterborough Then take no tickets at all, but he takes six from Peterborough, thereby saving the five fares from that place to York The whole affair sounds like an arithmetical problem of quite a high class and commends itself to every economical traveller who can command the services of a friend and intermediary It is quite sad to think that the terminus eventually reached by this ingenious band of passengers was the Mid diesel Sessions Quite as clever (and with no drawback in the way of immorality in Mr Cowell Brown a invention for saving folks from drowning A chemical preparation is inserted in the coat, waistcoat, and dress, which, directly the wearer falls into the water, causes the clothes to inflate, and their wearer to float like a buoy, or in case of a lady, let us say, like a waterlily Arrangements are made by which a mere shower of rain shall not suddenly distend one s garments to the surprise of all beholders If this invention, as seems likely from experiments, proves practicable, one would only have to add a little asbestos to the prepara- tion in order to treat both fire and flood with equal contempt There would then be positively no element to fear but earth-winch I am afraid must have us at last in spite of all precautions The newspaper prizes offered for competition are getting very various in character. The Weekly Dispatch offered its two guineas last week for the most appropriate inscription for the proposed monument of the Prince Imperial in the Abbey, and this is the winner, motto and all " His 1 honour rooted in dishonour stood This Monument is Erected To the Memory of Prince Eugene Louis Napoleon Bonaparte Against the express desire of The Br1 sh. sure in In deference to the wishes of a small faction of Sj ropathlscrs with the crimes of an infamous Empire, The imbecile propagator of the AJC Ivopolconlc Ideas Which, rooted In Selfishness had for thclraiiuTjrannj, And for their weapons Perjury and Bloodshed ' OstcnBlblj erected in honour of the deceased Prince, This Monument reflects Dishonour on all concerned Dishonour on the nemo it professes to commemorate, By recalling the worst episode in an otherwise blameless and amiable career, Dishonour on Its Promoters, Dishonour on the Nation which allowed it to be raised, And, above all, Dishonour on the Illustrious Dead Whose precincts It profanes If this is not very pretty, it is on the whole pretty true The poet informs us (no doubt truly, though my own experience of the fact is limited), " Tis always morning somewhere in the world, which he addresses by way of comfort to those in darkness and similarly it ought perhaps to be a great consolation to very poor people that there are some persons immensely rich. The proof of this latter fact could hardly be deduced more forcibly than to the sale of Mr Cartwright names the other day, which probably fetch the highest prices ever known, even in the gold diggings among those very KO' years relict the miners, " Bnatol milk,' as the very deep gold sherry supplied by Harvey and Son, of Bristol, used to be called, was sold for 13 guineas a dozen, Perrier Jouet's Carte d Or champagne (1870) realised 15, and the choicest cure (1865) no less than £18 a dozen 1 A little Baa] Made a ('362) was within the reach of moderate incomes, i e , under £10,000 a year, at £8 a dozen parts Such prices do not prove perfection in the liquor so much as the wealth of the buyers They were resolved to have the most expensive wines in their cellar procurable, and they have got them But if liquor at a third, or even a fourth, of the price was set before them, with the information that it was "Cart wrights, the gratification of their palates would be the same It is a fact well known to wine merchants, but which if revealed to gourmets would curtail a good deal of conversation about " the vintages that, though many people know good wine from bad, not one in a thousand can distinguish good from very good All talk about wine, you may take for granted, is founded on purse pride, and only developes a certain obscure and peculiar talent for lying A rich man, who sets moderately good wine before his guests may always persuade them (and almost himself) that they are drinking "Cartrights own If those who "drink like a fish are thus credulous, it is not surprising that fish themselves are easily taken in At the Brighton Aquarium some experiments have been made with young salmon that really go beyond merely " trifling with the intelligence As is well known, those creatures leave the river and make their was to the sea every year, returning to spawn The difficulty was, therefore, to substitute by artificial means the changes of water through which the fish would pass if at large In short, to persuade them that they had been to the sea And tina deception has been successfully carried out At this season of the year the British paterfamilias devoutly wished that the members of his family were equally gullible How delightful it would be, if without taking them from their home tank, we could persuade our wives and children that they had been to Scarborough or the Isle of Wight, and did not want any chance of air or dipping I don't know whether that delightful answer of the French lady to the mayor of her arrondissement, who requested her to subscribe to the illumination for the national side of the Republic, is true or not "Sir, the manes of my ancestors would execrate me were I to comply with your request, but it ought to be true, the grandfather of the countess being a village weaver, whom the Revolution emancipated and her father a clothier, who made his for tune by an army contract ' For my part I highly approve of the lady's use of the word "manes A deceased, but presumably not extinct clothier, has as much right to be appealed to as a shade as a dead duke It is after all, only a question of time and money (for I observe that for poor people there is no such privilege as to when even an ancestral ghost is permitted to walk in his own grounds After three generations, and with £5,000 a year in land, one has a right, I should imagine, to claim a banshee Yet it is not to be denied that in the notion of the manes of a radical weaver execrating his grand daughter for subscribing to Mags and fire- works, there is something that tickles one for the eventual disappearance of Swelldom and Snobbism (however far off) I have the greatest confidence in the folly of the ladies, and especially the newly rich ones I never used to have much sympathy with the anger of millionaires and employers of labour against Mr Ruskin, and his objection to their getting interest for their money when they said, "Why, confound the fellow, his own father was a wine merchant, and how does he suppose he left his money behind him' I only used to laugh But really Mr Ruskin is a little too fond of teaching other people their own trades I happened to glance over "Tiction fair and foul in a-" Nineteenth e<.,it*,u, the other day, and his audacity amazed me He stands on the apex of his art pyramid, by no means at his ease, though between our selves there is no sort of danger in the altitude, and scolds at Scott and Dickens as if they were on a lower level In the matter of novel writing his mind is peculiarly fitted for that operation, for it is a perfect blank He is evidently discoursing upon a subject he does not understand The fact is this gentleman, to use a vulgar expression, knows too much He writes on " War or " Political Economy, on the Colour of the Water in the home, and on " The Instances of Twisted Strata observable in Switzerland ' And all this has slightly twisted the strata of his own intelligence For my own part, I know very little, but what I know I do know, and when I hear the people who know everything talk to me about the things I do know, I am sometimes tempted to wonder whether they know anything Relations are sometimes dreadful things, notwithstanding our chivalrous attempts to persuade folks to the contrary, but I never knew how dreadful they could be till I read last week of the domestic trouble of an old gentleman at Plumstead He had loved not wisely but too well, that is to say, when advanced in years he had espoused a young woman, and on his wedding day his three married daughters came to congratulate him This they did by knocking at his door for 20 minutes apiece all night, and eventually throwing a large stone through the window of his nuptial chamber The magistrate before whom the case was brought endeavoured to convince them that their papa had a right to many if he liked, to which they replied they rather pitied than blamed him In the end the good Cash expressed his hope that " they would shortly be at peace and harmony not only with their father, but their stepmother also I have heard all sorts of epithets applied to police magistrates, the term for this gentleman ra, " Banguine In America it seems there are lady dramatic critics, which enables dramatic criticism to be more exact and particular upon certain matters One of them has discovered lately that a pretty and popular actress has not such good legs as she would have the public be here "I have," Baya theatre, "seen her legs within three weeks in Cymbeline,' ' As You Like It, and Twelfth Night, and have satin fied myself that they are larger in Action Like It' than in Cymbeline,' and larger yet in Twelfth Night ' Legs, like other cylindrical forms, look smaller when covered with black Supposing, for arguments sake, the white lights of the first play are genuinely called out, I judge the brown ones of the second to contain about two quarts of sawdust, and the black ones of the third not less than a peck Such is my conscientious estimate It will be a very shocking thing if critics on this side of the Atlantic become so conscientious as this The telephone is getting to be pretty generally laid between " churches and chapels and the houses of the well to do bedridden Chants, hymns, and lessons are distinctly heard, but only a very little of the sermon. This, I fear, will prove a great temptation to some churchgoers to stop at home, when we consider too, that the collection plate cannot be sent by telephone-but there, I will impute no motives In the Live Stock Journal (of all sources to supply a romanticmcident) there is an account of a very sober retriever-lot us hope of a mourning colour-who always attends the funerals of the household in which he is located If attacked by another dog during the solemn ceremony he takes no notice, treats him with contemptuous silence and when the service is concluded begins to howl as if at an Irish wake Except the howling this is surely most exemplary conduct I am very staid at funerals myself, but if attacked by a dog-well, I am afraid I should exhibit emotion I i
