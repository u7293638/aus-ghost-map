SELECT POETRY. i THE FORSAKEN FARMHOUSE. Against the wooded hills it stands, Ghost of a dead home, staring through â€¢ Its broken lights on wasted lands, Whare old time harvest grew. Unploughod, unsown, by scytheunahorn, The poor forsaken farm-fields lie, Once rich and rife with golden corn And pale green breadths of rye. Of healthful herb'and flower benefit, The garden plot no housewife keeps; Throngh weeds and tangle only left,, The snake, its tenant, creeps. A lilac spray, oice blossom clad, Sways bare before the empty rooms ; Beside the'roofless porch a sad, Pathetic red rose blooms. His track, in mbnld of dust and drouth, On floor and-hearth the squirrel leaves, And in the fireless'chimney's mouth His web the spider weaves. The leanidgbharn about to fall Resounds no inore on husking eves: No cattle low in yard or stall,, No thresher beats his sheaves.
