■SATURDAY, D EC . 18, -1880. T h -G P-ublic W orks D epartm ent has had-some rough handlin g o f late.

W e shall g o higher, and lay-all-the burden bn th e shoulders 7bf Mr. O ’Reilly, the responsible, M inister of L ands and W orks.

' I t so happens, however^' th a t thie vague charges against th e d ep a rtm en t w ere laid before a ju r y — th e m ost su p rem e. ju ry attain ab le under th e B ritish C onstitu tio n — a Select C om m ittee of P arliam ent ; and th e verdict is—not proven. O ne m ig h t have 'n a tu ra lly supposed th a t tin s excellent system of protecting the rig h ts o f Englishm en, a n d redressing th e ir w rongs, would, w hen brought into operation, have p u t a stop to th e antagonism -displayed in certain quarters, and silenced those who had been m isled by, Boating ru ­ mors, and th e unsupported statem ents of anonym ous letter^ w riters. B u t no ; th e charge is renew ed w ith as much anim ation as th ough n o thing had been done. T he charge i s . now : re ­ n ew ed w ith e s m uch anim ation as. though nothing b ad been done.' T he P arliam entary C om m ittee is -.said to have been a packed one, -and its report unreliable. W h a t a ■strange th in g th a t Parliam ent, in a full house, should deliberately com bine to bamboozle d ie public- w ho are .th e ir'-c o n stitu e n ts W hen we saw th e com plaints reiterated w ith so m uch vehem ence, we took th e trouble to refresh o ur memory: a s t o th e nam es on th e com m ittee, and find they are as mixed a lo t as could be found in th e H ouse, w ith one exception, and th a t is, th a t they ate all m en o f unexceptional honor pn-I I n ­ teg rity , void o f th a t.s tio n g party bias which is so undesirable in members of an inquisitorial com m ittee. They were th e H on. th e M inister of -Lands and W orks, who held a seat ex o ffic io ; the Hon. N . J . B row n, ex-M inister of L a n d s; Messrs. R iddoch and Cox, the members for N ew N orfolk -and Morven, both w ealthy a n d independent gentlem en; the late Mr. M itohell,than whom a more honest a n d p ain stak in g m an n e v e r breathed ; Mr. Lamb, the respected lepresentative for Clarence ; and Mr. Braddon, whose independence and la th e r extrem e independence of p arty are well know n. Thus it ivill be seen th a t th e com m ittee was ju d i­ ciously chosen o f m en w ho reside in all parts of the colony, and who were therefore enabled to concentrate the local experience' th a t each possessed, sifting o u t evidence from a ll quartern dow n to th e m ost m in u te details. ‘fW e have-not sp a c e to go fu lly into, die evidence of th e fifteen . w itnesses, who w ere ex am in ed ;. .but w e m a y state th a t.th e y m ost,distinctly refute, s ta te ­ m ents which were, m ade in th e new s­ papers, and w hich C ontinue to b e made w ith E xtraordinary .pertinacity.

A cco rd in g to M r.

H e m ight have gone further and said th a t contractors took th e work so low th e y have been nearly all ruined.

Men w ith o u t an y knowledge of roadm aking frequently tender for sm all patches by w a y of speculation. T hey have noth in g to lose, and if they chauce to get a coni tra c t, they m ight possibly m ake som e­ th in g out of it.

The Ghost.-The latest faitelligenbe withi regard to “ the ghost" (says “ Lynx” hi the Tasmanian Mail) has made things look very black indeed for some people The apprehension of the man Nevin has not, unfortunately, afforded any cine to the personality -of:.;the invisible spirit Rumours ‘are, however, in circulation which, if krue, reflect in a very serious manner tpon a certain Government official and -even a former Municipal magnate. I cat hafiilj imagine it possible that those individuals would so tar forget themselves and the positions they occupy qb to have -any edmplicity in the ghost scare. I t is a Strange thing that nothing further has been heard or seen trf the sceptre since the ■apprehension of the fellow Nevin, who, by the way, ought t» have been ‘‘ cart-tailed” round the town, if only for concealing what he does know. Other circumstances connected ,wuk Nevrus' apprehension can hardly he passed over by Government and the Superintendent o! Police. There are more evils, evidently, to get rid of than the scab in sheep. . ......
