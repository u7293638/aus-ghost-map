j Cleverness in Conversation. j A man well known in society says that : to be clever at conversation one mast have a good memory. He must keep j in mind so much as he knows of the , tastes and prejudices of those present?. \ " As you said the other day," is a good way to introduce a pungent remark ; or, " As your favourite author has it,3' 1 which shows a flattering regard for ■ one's references. All these tricks, if you call them so, must he studied. ■ Don't try to make a man think how i clever you are. Make him think how j clever he is. Brighten him up. Dead ; him on to say witty things. You may j even coax him up to a joke, be he as j glum as Pharaoh's ghost. Remind him of clever things he said " the other day." Never mind if they are inven tions of your own. Never mind if he knows they are, so long as he does not imagine that you know if they are all right. Tell bright things about him. It won't take long to make hi™ feel, especially if he is a really dull fellow, that he is a great deal smarter than even he thought himself. A man is apt to frizzle under the fire of your own humous, and wit, and brightness, and of course a man is never comfortable when be frizzles.
