TWO WELLS. JulrSS. On Wednesday evening an entertainment took place in the schoolroom in connection with the Improvement and Musical Society. TheRedbanks /?hnir asutUt.Rfl ? Mr.' H. Warren lirpjridfd anil then? was a fioou actenuance. iunongsi oiner pieces on the programme were glees by the choir, a reading by_Mr. Corden, 'Alike Murphy and the Ghost;' recitation. 'The Light Brigade.' by Mr. James Cowan, effectively given; and other contributions by the Chairman, Messrs. J. Strongman, and Temby. A lengthy programme was gone through with credit The whole wound up with the laugh able piece, 'Hungerford Market' giving imita tion of costermongers' street cries. ..This was highly amusing and ludicrous, but more practice was required. A common error was ob servable in the readings and recitations— the too free selection of comical pieces. As monthly entertainments are contemplated, this error can be remedied, and there is abundance of latent talent, only requiring cultivation. The district ploughing match promises to be successful. There are in all, as advertised in the Observer, 33 prizes for competition, amounting to about £90. The champion prize is subscribed for by ladies. We sincerely hope to have pleasant weather, and a brass band will be present. We had a few showers jesterday and to-day, which were much wanted. A pctitition to Government is being numerously signed to have a sandbank at the mouth of Port Uawler Harbour removed; it is very detrimental to shipping.— Communicated.
