The Adbertiser FRIDAY, AUGUST 15,1879. On the motion for going into Committee on Supply, Mr. Ross called attention to In-<*> stances in which the Government had, he-<*> asserted, thought proper to suspend Acts of -the LegislatnM or parts'of titem wiAodt authority from. Parliament. The bon. pismfcer bad given notice of a special motion "on. ttjs "subject, but preferred to bring ij forward in accor dance with 4 veil-known parliamentary practice. Be * admitted that in grave emergenciefl it was often necessary for a jGovernmi?nt to suspend laws or act arbi trarily; In suck a case he would not hesi tate to do so, but he would at the earliest t moment after the meeting of Parliament ask for a Bill of indemnity. This is going (to an extreme.' Should the Government by its necessary action have laid itself open tp (actions at law by private individuals un ( doubtedly a Bill of indemnity would be re quired, bnt not simply on account of sus '.pendisgthe operation of a law in such a way jthat no individual rights could be infringed. JThat the approval of Parliament should be jsoughtevenin these cases is, however, beyond jquestion, and tbe principle is decidedly {vicious that when an enactment is passed jany Minister of the Crown may, not simply in an emergency, but as long as be thinks proper, enforce just so touch xrt the law land ignore., jast so tench as he thinks fit. This is what has Ibeen done Jy yaefao? ferbvemmente'in IhiiTcolony. Witi; regard to the Land Act to-which Mr. &oss; re ferred, the action of the CommiMpner of CrowbXimdB toned upon bia iaterpreta jtioa at -thcrifltwi w&Mm; iraltog?ftar *<if f etent questios from taking apian ttcafcelf ■to suspend or administer it-as. he jnay con- _ inder proper. JliM a B^.tore^yfijonbis respecting thelimd Act was pronn?edm the Governor's opening epeechfStndTjiie' inatter has been referred te^a Select pom?- Jnittee. ; :. -. •. *" "" jOf course erery one knows ihat &vn; many statutes that have fallen into jdesuetnde, bat thia has generally comfl jto pass gradually, and not through malice prepetue on the part of any one in par jficular. It is one thing to find by degrees that a law cannot be carried out, and & very different thing for a Minister avowedly to undertake to suspend a law. If a statute is mischievous or useless it phould be repealed; if comply defective, amended. It seems to be a .special weak bees on the part of Commissioners of Grown do with laws as to them jpeeins advisable. Mr. HavforS!? defence -with respect to his interference with, the Brands Act consisted of .the exense that it was ex tremely small. The working of that Act is new referred to a Select Committee, so that he is relieveH from responobility with Regard to delaying the operations of portions of the measure, but it must be remembered that it was not at the instance of any-mem ber of the Ministry that this course wae taken. The Treasurer says that the Act was not suspended; that Mr. Playford simply xEstracted his officers not to enforce ihe waybills clause except under certain conditions, -and that any private person could, 4&L;''an't.^armjttion against any perso?infnnging the Act. The clausepxo vidW that every person driving catd?jnore than five mSleB witiumt a wayJuTl is ibbb to a penalty; the Comimsriflner of Crown Lands instructs the Inspectors not to en tone ti^danse anleap the cattle have been driven more than twenty miles. Now, whaliroul4*?*aiaif the Chief Secretary ies^ in|ibnction? to tie police not to en foice^pcJ?«Act unless in case of poblic bonse? baxog «pen after 9 o'clock on Simday eveniisj!BP ft would be nrged with great and indigiuuY^ariieatness by the Nockytes, and admttted by their *¥&**&&,&**■ the6gTeranja4.?bj?nldit, possible carry out the jkw^horoqgbj^ toid not just bo far as aoUed Ikeir ideas or wbit |a proper and just It x*s clearly ehown by the Gommiaaifl?er-of Crown Lands that his predecessor, Mr. Can, and a former Treasurer, Mr. Boss, bad taken very much greater liberties with the laws than he has, but this it not a good defence for his action* because two wrongs cannot make aright. \- Tnisquestionharingbeen discussed and a few [other matters ventilated, Mr. Boas resumed the debate on the Budget in an <laborate, energetic, and well-delivered speech, in which he made a carefully-studied attack upon the Treasurer's financial policy, \- wbkfciiesaidwasat vaf^ncewiththespand judgment of the majority o? members of firliarnent. The fact is that the extrava gant outlay ag«n«t. "*&& H** Eo3S declaims is caused by pressure from Parlia ment and from without. Members of the AesemUy talk about; the derfrabifity of retrenchment, but with few exceptions will not support the government in effecting that object They know it is needed, and believe it is practicable, but are afraid of offending their constituents. The Govern ment of which Mr. Boas was a member in creasea the expenditure at a great rate, , but.ajlopted the expedient of not spending Joie money -voted, and thai trailing nnex .pended balances as •omething to be revoted, bo that ia tlfia' way the votes for expenditure were no em barrassment to Uie Ministry. Members an constituents who depended upon the decisions of Parliament with respect to public works in which they were interested Leing carried into effect found that the Ministry knew how toJ " keep the word of I jromuse to the ear and break it to the hope." Of course the Iftte loan occupied a prominent position a .Mr." Eaes'e epeecav and, as hitherto, the effect of his remarks upon this head was to cast upon the present South Australian Government the blame of the Afghan war, the fall in the copper market, and the commercial depression that has taken place all over the world. The Associated Banks have, according to Mr.lloss, been moderate in the agreement just concluded with them, but will make some thousands by it. Well, it is usual for Banjks to, make money by their advances, anjf no on&_ yet ias ventured to say their charges in this case are exorbj(aob- It is easy to-prophesy disaster when the next loan is floated, bnt^the Government has secured plenty of time for condncfingthai operatMn. - . The .contention .that the estimated ex" pehditiire'"jof a year should be limited by th6.revenae is^ reasonable enottgh, but it is not always practicable to carry that prin ciple out, and Mr. Boss Vhen Treasurer iiid not" act upon ic fb iaid, « Here is the estimated expenditure, but we shall •not be able to spend so much, though Parliament has instructed us to do so;'' >ence the unexpended balances. There was mneh in^Mr v Eqss's speech that ooe: cou}d not reasonably disagree with. It is detuabtM^^brppfital and telegraph ofiices should yieldajievenue; that the rail way? ahpuM pay a fa* percentage on the coat of construction; and that' generally in the construction and management of public tised; but it can hardry be shown that the Treasurer of 1876 hu done much to senre these objects. Impatience of taxation was a prominent feature in the speeches of Thursday afternoon, and without doubt if the different Ministries and Parliaments bad worked together with one aim daring i he last four years, without any injury to the interestfijot the. colony* economy might have been accomplished to such an extent as te render taxation ■unnecessary for mere purposes of additional revenue, though it Would fltillhave been needed to render it practicable to adjust the incidence of tax ation. Now it is required to extinguish a deficit, and for work? that the Parliament has directed to be carried out. - When the people's representatives choose to exercise reasonable care in the matter of outlay the deficit will be -changed into a surplus, and then some of the Customs duties that press so hardly-upon the poorer-classes may be aboli?bed.- The inebriate Retreat at^Belair lias lately been brought rather prominently under public notice, through one of its inmates hav ing been charged at the Police Court with escaping from. the. institution. From the gtatgmenta jnade in Court- daring, the hearingjof ibis case it-may beipiet.tjr safely inferred iLsi we shall irot near or any gfbst amount" of good being done among the class of people it is intended to benefit,) to.: long as the establishment is conducted as it. baa hitherto been. Even those who are sent there for de tention are, it eeema, not subject to any very strict supervision, for it was shown that they go and come much as they please. Now if 3 man can, when tie craving for drink is on him, go out, indulge his appe tite, and return without having to submit to any punishment for breaking the rules, what permanent good will ever be.accomplished by the Retreat P We believe it is not the practice usually in Inebriate Betreats to apply any «ur?tiyepracejs .beyond the en forcement of total abstinence from liquor and the use' of such. diet and medicines as .the patient? may needpri their (tntadmission while suffering from'the-excesses they are desirous of abandoning* eleven! specific cures fordlpsomania'are,however,said to nave been resorted to wittTeuccess, and we wish to bring -specially under; notice the newest method, whlchTias recently excited some interest in Europe and and according to report has pro duced results which are truly wonderf uL A recent number of the Aberdeen Evening Exprett giY?s'some account of what has been done by the adoption of this treat msntin several cases by Dr. Stewart, of the Heathcot Hydropathic Establishment. The discovery is that of a physician re adings at phfcajjo, in America, najned D3Jsger r and is a, preparation of the red Peruvian bark (Cinchona rubraj, known among druggists as "qnOl bark," a name which it has acquired through being taken from hmnchft? about the sue of a quilL The mode of prepmtimi and &e; method of applying it are simplicity itself, and its cost certainty seed not stand in tie way of it? being adopted. Hie bark is reduced to « powder, and then soaked in diluted alcohol, after which ita bulk is lessened by «ne-lialf being «trained off or «vapo&ated.; This is the whole <rf the wark involved U itopreparation. l^h?TingbBen-done,there ?BOtbing Temaining Vot to adminieter tiie medicine to the patient. On the first and second days a teaspoonful is giren every three hours, tin tongue being moistened occasionally between the administering of the doses. On the third day the dose is reduced to half a teaspoon!ul, then to a quarter of a teaspoonful, and subsequently to fifteen, ten, and five drops. On an average eight days is sufficient to effect a cure, but in extreme cases it has been found necessary to continue the treatment for as much as thirty days. The preparation re sembles another derived from the same source in being a powerful tonic, but unlike quinine, it inspires those who take it with a to the discovery of thfexemedy, andstating that many «imnlntr«|ah'"^ bees cured through its influence. Throtign'^fne efforts of Dr Stewart and other#entiem<m of Aberdeen, who had .read a similar paragraph in the Aberdeen Ezprets, we are now enabled to enow what has actually been,- accomplished in individual cases by the aid of Peroriatf bark. *" The benevolent gentlemen who associated themselves with Dr. fitewart with* qur of testing the value of the American remedy for drunkenness^the erpgfife of which they agreed to share betwee* them, had little difficulty in finding a suitable patient to operate upon. A. ran ?T ctmsiderabfe.^ complishments, who .bad * bean for years indulging in drunken. Jiabits, which were leading him rapidly to Tain, sod who, pre sented the appearance of a wreck, both mentally and physically/was taken in hand. This poor wretch was in. each a deplorable iondition that he was a subject of jiity to ell who saw bin wandering sbciut the streets. He. jsas the .treatment referred to above, and the result was even more- satisfactory than coald have been; hoped. "After the first few doses tinf intense craving for drink, became less, and gradually disappeared; while in place of it there was mamTiifed ano less marked aversion to the alpnlifrl, which shortly grew into positive disgust. The treatment was continued for ihree months, after which the patient<retumed to Aberdeen with 1 a color in his cheeks that for yean bad been absent, and such health and vigor in his movements as oofiloVaqt fail to cany con viction regarding the result of the work. The once decrepit-^md maudlin drunkard has been furnished with employment; physically the .man has been retrieved from utter ruin." The soccea achieved in this instance induced a" flecaadTtmT, and the results here were-equally satisfactory. The subject was ~a; t?aimeruial % man whose vitiated tastes were rapidly min ing him physically financially, and threateninglhe destruction df tito faappinaa of hia/arnfly. .The case was not, however., such, .a hopeless one* as die first that was" undertaken. The man was taken to Heath cot when he was dead drank, aad after ib* first craving for drink had passed away ths same aversion to spiritous liquors whicE had characterised the first case was observ able. In a month' be was allowed to visit Aberdeen during the day to attend to his business, returning, at nighty and once be has gone back to bis family lie has had no longing for drink; in fact be ia said to hate^ the very sight of it This cure is the mote surprising, as his wife, while efforts were being made for bis care, wrote to the got* tlemen engaged in tbejwgrkthankingr^hem for what they were doing, bat stating that the quite despaired of any beneficial result, eb from her knowledge of her husband she was convinced that he would find some means of procuring stimulants in some shape, whether it were whisky chloral, opium, or chloroform. - So far this predic tion has not been realiaad, and the taste for strong drink appears to have been com pletely eradicated. A third case was of a milder form. A young man whose love of alcohol threatened to-drag him with de?~. traction morally and physically, but who had not -yet become so degraded as thoser who had been" prgriongy- treated,. was. placed nndeUhe care of; Dr. Steward aa£ after only a fortnightis detention "returned to the town freed^rom t& incuboswlnch; hfld iw***ll Tpn^i^ir him P —~- - * !—L ~2 |Sp ftrihese arpjfce onl/cases that ha* teeoi de^lt whh by Dr. Stewart, tml in each, ose^jeinlt basi^n ol t a moat aatasfacr tory cnsCTJctffifTKejtwiedy, baa, however, been used with mcoaatlafsauif prirate in dividuals who have |>rocared it from the druggist who prepared it for Dr. The discoverdr Af the remedy icLoms for it that its effects will be p^na nent; tfv* tin antipathy to nfrtafciiftr stimulants which, as we have seen, is very soon est&blishea;' through Its mfliuMjiroi? of a lasting cfrfrractrr. £o-Jar as the cases we h&veJ3;£ferredlQ_ate£onc6rn£d > it wonUbf co^fcetoo^sobn soasi^ tb^lfce ave|-" eion to tpiriiutras liquors is a firmly roojtti one, bat that men do shattered and debased by indnlgeTO $n drinlt as to be a nmsance; aot only^ijgegadm but to all with whom they" come in contact, can beifor a time restored to society jind to health, a placed beyond the region of doubt, and theaV is great hope that the effects of^netreat ment adopted wig be--of a lasting charac ter.

A Bill to amend the University Act of 1874 was introduced in the Assembly on "Thursday by the Minister of Education. At tWssent pa TTniWsrty authorities hare greater lowers than are 'possessed either in the MaT oourn> ov Sydney tlnlversitisa,and"it is with ft vfawlio limit these that this measure fe sub mitted. The University here has the power to grant the degrees of Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Science. This is to be taken from them, to as to reduce their status to that of the Universities of the cities above mentioned. The step is necessary, we believe, because other wise the degrees ot the University would not recognised by the English University authori ties. Messrs. Joseph Stilling' &. Co. have re «en-«d a cablegram from Sues, advising them that the Aconcagua^ w*«jl«^ which fcsft lure on 17th July, were in time for the Brindisi mail leaving Alexandria 12th August, and would be ia Condon on 18th August—that is, S> days from Adelaide. The P. ft O. maQ, which left neteon'Uih July, would not reach London until 45th August. .In connection with ocean mails we may mention a fact which is of special inte rest now that our arrangements for a postal service between the oniony and Europe ?re under consideration. Daring the last home ward trip of the Ohimboraso the purser posted at Alexandria for London a letter which wai seat by the first steamer, and reached Bagland four days earlier than the Chimboraxo's mails that were forwarded by way of Briadisi. It is naturally suggested that if we -desire quick dispstrii of our mails they should be forwarded, as this letter warn, by the first fcaat, whether it is to call at Brindisi, KapUs, or Marseilles. The Treasurer aroused Mr. Bray's ire in the Assembly on Thursday, aad got the rough edge of the boo, geatlemairt tongue in con- Hwgnanoe. Mr Bray was very anxious to have a alight amendment made in the searioual order motion, but was told by Mr. Mam that the """^t** as drawn had met with the approval of Mr. Speaker, and it was delicately hinted that Mr.Bray would have shown better taste if he bad been content with it in its original form.

Memorials to the above effect ware signed by those present. " A case was heard bv the local Justices ■ atStrathalbynon Tuesday, "the 12th inst. which" (says the Southern Argtu) * points to a state of *hjng.?W bofle little good to the pastoral in terests not only of this district bnt the whole colony. It appears from the evidence of the prosecutor in the case alluded to (Mr. lospeator Wells, of Wellington) that two head of diseased cattle were found on the travelling stock reserve near Bast Wellington; and the «""??'■ having the same marks upon them as those des cribed in the defendant's * waybill* or 'delivery note' shown to the Inspector at the time ot" crossing at the ferry, action was very properly taken against the drover. According to Mr. Wells's statement an Inspector can only deat with the actual disease itself under the eristiug regulations; and consequently infecUd cattle are allowed to pass on and be sold and re-sold, and thus become the medium of spreading infection through the whole colony. We have no wish to take the initiative in the?e matters or become alarmiste, bat think at tbe same tune we should be failing in oar duty u public journalists were we to remain apathetic and allow so serious a matter to pass without notice. The Orders in Council under whioh the Inspectors act are severe in tbe extreme with regard to cattle imported from abroad, aad we are at a loss to know why more stringent measures should not be adopted with regard to. cattle imported by land, or even cattle within the province, known to be affected with any contagious disease. The question, no doubt, is a difficult one to deal witb, and unless some method of quarantining diseased cattle from other places for a certain time on or near the Border could be carried oat, or compulsory in oculation made general by legislative enact ment throughout the colonies, we fear the future prospectsof the cattle-owners of South Austra lia will be anything bat cheering." The last of a aeries of twelve lectures was given in the City Mission-Hall on Thursday evening, August 14, me lecturer being Dr. Joyce, and his subject," Happy Homes, and bow to make them." Then was a large at tendance. Mr. J. Darling, M J*., who occupied the chair, referred to the sueee?i which had at tended the series of lectures which ended that evening, and mentioned that they had been much better attended than the last, especially by that portion of the community for which they were more particularly intended. He added that an additional entertainment to the aeries of concerts already carried out would be shortly given. The lecturer was then introduced. He dealt with his snbjeet in an easy con versational manner, and snoeeeded in se caring «fae doae attention of his audience for nearly two hours. It might haw been expected that Dr.'Sbyee would trees hifl subject from a medical or scientific point of view, but instead of adopting that coarse he gave prominence to what may be called tbe moral aspects of the question. He commenced by pointing oat the causes of unhappy homes, and showed how by their removal a considerable degree of domestic felicity might be obtained. The mistakes nude daring the period of courtship by couples who disguise their real character, and enter into the important state of married life with misconcep tions as to each other's tastes and views of life were adverted to as one of the most important causes of domestic onhappiness. The want of domestic tact and economy on the part of the wife was referred to as another evil, and in this connection the lecturer attacked toe vicious habit among mothers of training their daughters- - to become "fine ladies" instead of teaching them bow to properly petloim the domestic duties that every good wife should be equal to. Dr. Joyce also condemned tbe idle aad dissolute habits of some husbands, and showed how the want of proper appreciation of the solemn duties of married life makes the home onhappy both for wife and husband. The lecturer received a hearty vote of thanks at the dose of his ad dress. During the evening a number of musical selections-were given in good style by the choir. Mr. G. State acting as conductor.

Xhe performance was muoh enjoyed Owing to the fact that the New Zealand horse Fishhook was entered for the Melbourne Cup as an aged horse instead of a six-year-old, bis entry was informal, and consequently he will not be allowed to start. A fancy dress ball was given at Govern ment House. en Thursday evening. A large innmber of invitations had been issued, and .the ball was a great success. Some of the costumes were remarkable for the orginality and taste displayed in their selection. ; At tbe annual meeting of the V.R.C. in Melbourne, on August 4, Mr. L. L.
