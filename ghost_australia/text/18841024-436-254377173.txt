VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB SPRING MEETING. The attendance at Caulfield on Saturday to witness the running for the second day's events of the above meeting plainly indicated the growing popularity of the Caulfield course among racegoers, the spectators numbering over 12,000, and including His Excellency the Governor and suite. For the principal event of the day—the Caulfield Cup—the melancholy story of the favorite being beaten was once more repeated, and nothing could have shown how little to the advantage of the public was Blink Bonny's success than the fact that some of the bookmakers broke through their usual phlegmatic reserve, and danced on the eward, waving theirnotebooke and hats on high. The following are the results of the racing :— BELLING RACE, Of 100 so vs. The winner to be sold for £150. Five furlongs. Mr. A. Saqui's b h Mistake, by DantO—Stockdove, S yrs, nil, 7st I Mr. J. R.

Privateer was quickest on his legs as they wentawav, and behind him were Lavington, Blink Bonny, Yately, Claptrap, and Colstoun, Flying Jib was last off. Astheynearedthe stand, Lavington had laken the lead, with Yately for a closcattendant. Behind themfollowed the field in aclosebody, Battailous, Vernet; Vergy, Privateer, and Ironhand being conspicuous. Passing the stand Lavington. was in tront. Yately, Battailous, Helene, Vergy, Vernet, and Privateer were next in that order. Signor stumbled and got rid of his jockey in the centre of the main body, but luckily did not bring down ainy of the others. Lavington led round the turn past the stand, Yately, Battailous, Bapid, Norfolk, Vergy, Vernet, Fryingpan, Ironhand, Colstoun, and Capri being next. Very little change took place in the run along the back stretch, save that Yately passed Lavington and Vergy dropped back suddenly, one of the horses having interfered with him. The Agent was acting as whipper-in. Yately was clear in front as they rounded the far turn. Lavington was very handy. Lord Wilton and Battailous were next, followed by Fryingpan, Vergy, Norfolk, and Blink Bonny. Yately led down the hill, apparently full of running, but near the sod wall he was challenged by Blink Bonny, who went up to him with a flue spurt. FryiDgpan here improved his position, and for a short time his backers were hopeful. Vergy was running close behind the leaders. Approaching the turn for home, Blink Bonny took the lead. Yately, Lord Wilton, and Vergy were running in that order, close behind her, the quartette being clear away from the second division. Blink Bonny entered the straight with a clear lead, Lord Wilton had passed Yately, Vergy was close up, Hastings, Claptrap, Norfolk, Malua, Colstoun, and Helene were following in that order, and pretty close together. Blink Bonny led home a good winner by a little over a couple of lengths. Lord Wilton was second, a length and a half in front of Vergy. Then followed Malua, Fryingpan, Claptrap, Yately, Helene, Norfolk, and Colstoun, iu that order. Bend Or was last.

The last-named ran off at the log fence, and Moolpa .fell at the sod wall. These constituted the only contretemps during the race, all the other horses negotiating their jumps safely. Entering the straight the last time round Echo was leading, with Struggler pressing him closely, the pair drawing away from the others. A fine finish ensued, Straggler gaining the victory by a good head ; Denmark was third 10 lengths off; Deceiver was fourth fully as far away ; Fame, Taxaraxacum, Marquis of Waterford, and Chester were next.
