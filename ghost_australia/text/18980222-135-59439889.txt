TIUE IWO DI)IEAYItIES. Two Irishmen travelling, came to a very poorly supplied inn. ' What can you give us for supper? said they to the lean and shivering landlord. 'I've naught in the house but one pigeon,' replied he; ' soyoumust make the most of it between ye.' ' All right,' replied the shrewder of the two; 'bring up your bird and we'll divide him.' The dish was accordingly produced when Paddy turning to his companion said, 'now Mike, Pre been thinking this ghost of a bird won't bear dividing ; what do you say for tossing up for it in this way-we'll go to bed, and to-mor row morning, whoever has had the finest drame shall have the pigeon for his breakfast.' The proposal was accepted, and next morning, when the fellow travellers met Paddy took the word and inquired of his companion how he had slept, and what he had dreamed. ' Bedad !' replied Mike, 'and didn't I just drame, and wasn't it a drame that'll bate hollow every other drame that iver was drained. There I was in the very midst of the sivinth heaven, with all the powers of glory round me, and clouds of angels and archangels and a bewilderment of saints and pattiarchs, all making much of me, and hoisting me up, and up, and up, till I couldn't go any higher and then I awoke.' ' Och, well,' said the other ; ' its a strange thing ; but I had exactly the self same drame meself, and I knows what you says thrue, for I saw ye flying up and up, and I says to meself, ' sure, now, Mike's got up as high as that he'll never be sich a fool as to come down any more,' so I got up and ate the pigeon.' Two men did business side by side: For getting trade the first relied On advertising far and wide, The while the second trusted To other methods to obtain The golden prize he sought to gain. Upon the first the dollars rain The other merchant busted.
