Id tbe centre of the floor stood a young fellow, with white hiir end ioag,j lanky legs, who was telling, with great earneat aets, of how be bad passed a care, shoot a ®ife from the village, culled tbe " Obost'e Cave m to i tbe inhabitants of Lawton, who fimlf believed that a spirit bad taken up bis abode ia the | gloomy carern " The gbost made a leap," tbe fellow wii saying if I'eDtered, •• and 'gave an twful/rind of tdping scream, and then ran baek into the ca*o bowling and moaning fearfully. 1 «u so scared that ( just picked up actd mux—ton all tbe way to the village bete. Tell you, nothing oould get me to go back there again •* Of oourse, be was the hero of the occasion, and at the ciowd pressed around him, I turned to a man sitting uear metomake»ume inquiries. It seemed that tbe young fellow,' wbeee name was Waters, had been over lo see an uncle, who lived two miles away, and being de layed in getting off fee was overtaken bj dark* Mas wtiile yet some distance from tbe village. His path led by tbe fhoat'* cave, aol, although be had half a notion to go around by | another Nad, he at last '* braced op," as the i man expressed it, and moved on. As be ueared | tbe cave be saw the gbort sitting in the en trance, its two red eyes glaring down at bim in , a frightful manner. Waters wai almost dead i with fright, but he managed to pick op a stone i and fling it at the white object. Whether hu | bit it or not he oould not tell* but, at any rate, tbe object gave an " awful soream," and dia- J appeared. " 1 ttckon you dou't wut to go baA-tberel tg'in to*nigbt," said one of the men* with ■ J *rin. | ** No, air, 1 ion't," replied the jauog DM de* cidofir.

Tbe out rooming 1 met the landlord la tbe ball, and anked bun about tbe man who bad gone to visit tbe ghoatfa cave—if be bad dit covered anything. ** Yes " aaid tbe landlord as be led the way loto tbe diniug»rootn « "this man went out to tbe eave—seem* ^e knew pretty near where U w»b— and s»t.doj*o on a log to rest and look about a bit. Directly tbe gbeet came out, and. eealiog itself uear tbe catranoe of tbe cave, began to bowl. The ■»*—wboee same, by tbe way, u Samuel Fleming—*afo4 bis gun at Ibis moment aod fired.
