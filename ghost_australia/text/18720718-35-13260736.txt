CHRISTIANITY ON THE CONTINENT. By Bishop A. Etoxny, from the Contemporary Review. forMny-) " Tiiritp is one consequence which flows from a belief which rests on authority, so different from that which in this country is supposed to II lay from it, so different and opposite that we must not pass it by because its influence in this country is increasingly dangerous It is that va Inch c receives that a belief va Inch rests upon authority and not on illumination, on faith, and on light-on ignorance and not on know- ledge is productive of a higher awe and reverence "What is called the "Catholic Revival' in England finds many supporters on this ground Now this is far from being the case, and the a suit in the long run is entirely the reverse of that which is supposed, Experience has long shown that it is not so in Roman Catholic countries, it cannot have eventually a different result in this At first, mystery may have this effect All that has a relation of fear has it But when that which is expected sick apprehended from the supposed cause does not follow, and nothing alarming takes place, a reaction sets in, and reverence and awe are supplanted by freedom and even pro- family , a freedom, and (as we should deem it) pro faint) as to sacred things, va Inch we see exhibited in Roman Catholic countries, of which we have no son captain in this " We should not venture to allude to this subject, painful as it is to ourselves, and likely to pass many near and dear unto ourselves, who hold the principles, and are members of the communion to which we allude, but we are so impressed with the terrible consequences which ever follow mistaken grounds of belief, that under the risked doing violence to the red sings of some va c esteem as him as the highest and best of men and friends we cannot but mention what we know, and use the knowledge in the hopes of preventing what may become with the spread of such principles a larger manifested in and sadder experience of their results We allude to the character of thought as to sacred things, which a religion received apart from reason and conscience must produce, and the travesty it cannot fail to make of the subjects with which it is familiar when handled in ignorance of their real meaning and force Such handling, of course, is guiltless of the profanity which would attend it under other circumstances, as for example in Protestant and Bible reading countries, where Christianity is reversed its a revelation to be apprehended and approached by its own light, but still the effect is due pi j injuries, while it is evident that suchuppreheiisioii of the subject is entirely alien 11 and remove from their use and object as communicated to us by a revulsion from above. But what is meant may be most muslin gathered from an hills tration, however painful it may be to give or even to read it among ourselves Sunday instances will occur to man), especially to those conversant with the state of the Roman Church in Southern Italy, but something of the same chnrictA' "18 to be witnessed are three home, and is to be heard if not seen in the oaths in use, for example, among the men in Irish Roman Catholic residents The instance I shall quote occurred in Calabria, and was given by an eminent and pious Roman Catholic priest as an example of the hint of relied in there produced by the principle of accepting religion merely on authority, vaithoutanv n quiry into, or experience of its real and spiritual nature " The Clarence parish priest) had been preaching and making a collection va Inch had not been successful, in aid of the building fund of his church, and he thought he would do better by enforcing his argument by an illustration The church was dedicated to St. Joseph An inh sitting of the parish had just ducks bad and notorious character, distinguished, however, by some offerings he had been in the habit of a king to St Joseph s Do you know,' asked the preacher in his sermon, that So and so m dead - Of course you do, and also what kind of man he was, no doubt Do you know then as here he has gone too I ki ova what you would say , you are wrong He has gone to heaven You are astonished You do not believe it You do not believe it because you do not know the power of St Joseph And very few do It was all owing to be Joseph Hear ." you say I shall tell you When he got to the door, St Peter would not aching him he kept the key fast in the lock "Your old sequitur tance knocked and waited, but the suit was obdurate " impossible,' he stud " impossible ' said the man, " send for St. Joseph," by Peter would not listen At his, wearied by but linpmtmnties, he called St Joseph St Josephson. see nig who it was, and considers g, said, Peter, you must let him in St Peter would not At last Jotephgot angry, and said, "]) > you know who I am "Yes, and St Pott r ' but it is all the same, he cannot get in " So all St Joseph goes to the Virgin Mary Susie at 61 ec, "Are you not my wife'' "Ttce," hold the "N lrtjiii " Then follow me to the door She did so "Now," said St Joseph, " get that man in " Peter was afraid of the Virgin, but still he we could not, and did not let him in "Oo then for your Son," sold fat Joseph And she went the Saviour followed her to the door, and after hua crowded all the host of heaven At last the Pcre Eternal seeing he was as left alone with the Holy Ghost, went to see, but even then St Peter had admitted the man Nova, the preacher concluded, you are able to see something of the power of St Joseph' " Leaving alone the fearful profanity to our ears of such a rule as this, it is not only impossible that such conceptions of revelation could arise where re- velation is seen by its own light, and the Bible is at all known, but it is impossible to doubt that such a system as this, irrespective of its inherent error and evil, leaves really unknown and unapplied all that revelation and Christianity) were intended to give It is not too much to say, therefore, that where such knowledge or rather ignorance of revelation is the rule, Chns transit), properly so called, has scarce had entrance. And vate must not be surprised at the low civilization and moral condition of such countries, or at the opposition of so many of the more intelligent among them to what they suppose to be religion, for this wall the) know at least of revelation and Christianity as contained in it Perhaps it will be thought that this example is unprecedentedly extravagant, and cannot be considered fair, the occurrence took place, as we have said, in Southern Italy) and such a character of thought will scarcely be found in the Roman Catholicism of the North of Europe But then this is to be ascribed to the juxtaposition and intrusion of other principles, and not to any change in the principle itself, nor alteration in the character of its working. In the neighbourhood of Germany, and 'in Germany itself, this no doubt is the case in France it a less visible, as since the expulsion of the Protestant element from that country all the religion of France, and especially of late years, has been of the ultra- montane character. Yet so great an absence of perception of the spiritual nature of revelation could scarce take place there, were it only because of the light such as it, which their scientific and social acquisitions have infused into the nation, and the real religion of France, the outcome, that is, of her spiritual nature, is but to be found at present in the outcome of those things " A.
