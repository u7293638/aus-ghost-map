Easter Monday. Tattersall's Easter Meeting. Fecond Day — Eabtee Monday. Soon after the close of tho racing' on Satire day, rain began to fall, and continued, almost withont intermission and moro or less heavily, all Saturday night, Suiiduy, great part of Sunday night, and Monday morning, but in the smalUiourstho clouds lifted a littlo, shortly after a gleam^fennshine lighted upthelandsoapo now UDQ Ugttlll^ UUU lUUU^U uicn uguv ouu n u.o uutuu down, on -and off, up to tea o'clock, the day .gave promise of sufficiently fine weather to draw a big attendance i o Eagle. Fai m. Tho paddock waa full enough, and between it and outside thero must have been somo eoven thousand people on tho ground during ,the day. The totalisator investments amounted to about £fi000, and tho man at tho gate must have made up his lossos of tho first day. Tho starting was bb bad as on Satarday, worse if possible ; and in tho laat race- littlo Ascot and Bosella went round, racing, under tho im presBion that the etarter, who dropped his iUg right enough, had despatched hia Reid: tie popular idol came in first, but on learning i was ' no go,' Trihey very prudently withdrew him, and [the horse went baok to the paddock Bowers, who has lately been giving a lot of trouble to the several starters at and about Eagle farm, was Bent hack .to Jtho weighing yard, on Fairy, but tho stewards allowed Mr. 'Whitman to put up another jockey, Archer, and tho mare was sent down to tho post again. The courEe, considering tto unfavourable weather, wbb in really very fair order, though tho records wero necessarily Blow, nnd but fow of tho horsoB retuiaed tt tho top of tho telegraph board, after t^e fc-everal races, would have been whnre th(y were, had the going been hard and Bound. ; Lttton Handicap of 100 sova. ; a handicap for two and three- year olds ; . second hpraq 13 eovb. from the prize ; 7 furlongs. i L.

H Kent. Neither Bbaped very well, nor d- they seem likely just at present to foil v in tho footsteps. of their respective brothe ', though a better day, I am convinced, is in st. o for them. Tho two-year-old is a beauti il filly, built on better lines than either of lr elder relatives, and must race pome day. 1 e Peer's Bister is aifine raking sort, but a tit hi h on the leg, and Bomewhat unfurnished as y ;. Abacus got away well on the inside, witlia good lead, which he held for a furlong or t-, when Turtha Maid headed him, and the thro year-old was judiciously pulled till reachic the three furlong post, when ho ran up to tjo daughter of Epigram, and got level, raoig alongside her for nearly a distance, their nea cst foJlower — the orjly near one, inied, being the two-year-old Stamboul. D BideB these, tliere was nothing n It, for Ssndy Greavc3 never loohd dangerous, Silver F'ag seemed I'nuble to uctn the heavy go;ug, and nothing else had ay show at all; bofore reaching tho diatanB, Abacus had the filly's measure, and.cotnig clean away from her in the straight, won will conBummate ease by four lengths. Wtambal a poor third ; but. this brother to Goldstm wants moro time, and a greater ecodo of groud to be Ecen at his best ; brside, bis action !s pecularly .unsuitable to heavy ground, ad under tho oircumstances ho ran very well ; t all events sufficiently so to give reasonable hob of his tuning out a mote than average thro year-old.

The Selling Plate ended in an ont-ar out bui prise — the;victory of Culloden, one- : the best bred horses in tho world, and a vc ? gocd looking, but heretoforo an unauocosa: one. Ho is by Chandos (imp. son of Oxfoi out of Sweet William dam, Lady Hooto (imp.) by Stoekwell, a pedigree good enou for a Melbourne Cup winner.

(Broad man) ; and Rosella, 6 at. 7 lb. Betting : 2 to 1 v. Daybreak and Fairy, 3 to 1 Quicksilver, 4 to 1 Lionol and Embers. The Bniis Handicap, as shown above, resulted in tho well-earned victory of Fairy, with Austin up, ;n place of Bow.-.rs, and no one grudged Mr. Whit man the win, after the cruel -way ho was deprived of the fruits of tie mare's victory in the Dalveen Handicap on Saturday. Daybreak ran a good second, and Lionel third. It was in the gloaming vihen the race was run, and it must havo beon quito dark beforo tho visitors got homo. But for the starting, which was about the worst and certainly the most aggravating on record, the meeting was a success, and the corrmittee, stewards, and other officials aro to be congratulated on. bringing it to so happy an issue, out of all the troubles that beset it.
