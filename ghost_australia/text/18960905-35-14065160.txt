BACON AND THE BIBLE. The recent publication of select passages from the poetical books of the Old Testament, arranged and annotated without any theological or doctrinal reference, but solely from a literary stand point, has had the effect of directing attention to the influence of the Bible upon English literature, m Influence so subtle and so immense that it is difficult to say w hollier the Hebrew or the Hellenes element has been the more potent C lest we Jhblc, value qui lost mile In le, said a distinguished French critic, 9111 afnOHitt le gimpo iHjurilc Jffiiu, en far distant in for the si could If this was true of the great German pool, in whose veins ran some drops of that nth Oriental blood which the t dented author of ' Trilby" thinks he can to see in the composition of genius, it is still more true of our J nglHi masters of style, who, from Bunj in mid Milton down to Suakin and stevenson, acknowledge or betray the dominating influence of the sonorous language and stately imagery of the Authorised Version But perhaps no prose writer, not dealing with distinctively theological topics, has made more beautiful 01 more ingenious application of the words and the incidents of the Bible to modern ideas than the author of the " Advancement of Leaning Not only in the racy vernacular of Oovordnle or the Genevan translators, but in the quaint monkish Litm of the Vulgate, he uses passages of scrip turn to explain an 01 illustrate his meaning with an origin jht ; and an insight that my best familial texts with fresh be city and force and with such exquisite modulation of rhythm that henceforth they haunt the memory like the music of some solemn oratorio What a subtle charm, for instance, both of sound and of association is there in that pathetic sentence, with its quaint mediaeval Litinity and its pensive melancholy cadence, as of one who had seen, with the Preacher, all the works that are done under the sun, and behold all are v vanity and vexation of spirit " But above all, before it, the sweetest centre is white Dwnttu, when a man hath obtained worth j cars and expecta- tions " Or again, that wistful beatitude of toil, which links the worker with the heavenly De- large both in the labour and in the Sabbath rest which follows "If a man can be a partaker of God's theatre, he shall show so be a partaker of God's rest it coinciding year, it appeared opera, quite stealing minus vase, of Ut quod opium event bona minis and then the Sabbath" Or that sublime climax of light, rising from the light of heaven through the light of reason, till it cullin flutes in the illusion at ion of the Spirit with its threefold counterpart in the order of creation " " The first creatures God in the works of the days was the light of the house the last was the light of reason and his bubb ith work, ever since, is the illumination of his Spirit First he breathed light upon the face of the matter 01 < In os then he breathed light into the face of man and still he breathes and inspired light into the face of his chosen ' One more example vermin take from the Essays to illustrate the freshness of thought and the felicity of expression with which he applies Scriptural figures to the treatment of familiar themes Spent ing of the sweet uses of adversity , he says with equal beauty and force " Prosperity is the blessing of the Old testament , adversity is the blessing of the New, which carries the greater benediction, and the clearer revelation of God's favour Yet, even in the Old Testament, if you listen to David's harp, bushell heal us many horserake airs as carols and the pool of the Holy Ghost hath laboured more in describing the afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon " In many passages, now over, it is perhaps rather the ingenuity of the application, the novel way of looking at well-worn texts, which through their very familiarity are in danger of losing their full significance, that attracts our attention Thus, to illustrate the in< compatibility of truth and false hood, who May s they are like the iron and clay in the toes of jvebuelmdiie/?ar s dingo they may leave but they will not incorporate Dealing with the question of unity in religion, he says that to certain zealots all speech of pacification is odious, and attributes to them the words of John " Is it peace, Jehu ." "What hast thou to do with peace Turn their behind me " and ends with the trenchant remark " Peace is not the matter, but following party " in support of his view that a nation which is crushed by excessive o taxation will never become silent and martial, he refers to the patriarchal benediction of the tubes of Israel, saying that the blessing of Judah and Issachar will never meet, that the same people should be both the lion's whelp and the ass heavy cen two burdens ' With equal ingenuity, when discussing the proper attitude of the judicature towards the royal prerogative, he derives a gi value illustration from the supporters of Solomon's throne " Let judges also remember that Solomon's throne was supported by lions on both sides , let them be lions but yet lions under the throne , being circumspect that they do not check or oppose my points of sovereignty " in the u Advancement of Learning" he advocates the endow- men of research by an appeal to David's regulation as to the adequate remuneration of those who guarded the baggage "So, if you will have sciences flourish you must observe Divid's military law, which was that those which stayed with the carriage should have equal part with those which were in the action ' cKo will the carriages be ill attended to i riders m messes are, indeed, the gun from me, of the states and pro- visions of sciences, whence men in active courses are furnished, and therefore ought to have equal entertainment with their " A counsel of perfection which fell and still falls on deaf ears, when the pittance of the s holds, even the most successful as the world counts success, v ance from a tithe to the hundredth part of the no one of a popular music-hall singer or an astir o Chicago pork butcher Well no, not the great philosopher, in the petition to the last part of his brilliant apology for learning, exclaim with despondency at the inevitable faithlessness of his appeal, pass dug into exultation at the thought of the exceed- ing great reward of wisdom herself, which cannot be "often for gold, and whose price is above o rubies " for these things must continue as they have been, but so will the it also continue where- upon learning hath over robed, and which faileth not Justtjicita as a picnic i a/tins sim His in the pie melon of Biblical precepts is often very judicious, reading as he does discreet limita- tions into words which fancies sometimes press Iona lnjuiiouH excess Observing how the self Â«iicrihrcof unselfishness tends unconsciously to become selfish self-destruction, he warns us against the folly of morbid altruism " Beware how in making the portraiture thou breakest the pattern for divinity maketh the love of ourselves the pattern, the love of our neighbours but the portraiture ' Set all that thou hast, and give it to the poor, and follow Me , ' but sell not all thou hast, except thou come and follow me that is, except thou have a v season we hereby thou mayest do as much good with little means as with great for otherwise, in feeding the streams thou divest the fountains " Similarly, when dealing with the navy idea of indiscriminate charity, he employs an impressive analogy from the method of Providence The example of God teacheth the lesson truly He serveth his rain and maketh his male shine upon the just and unjust ' but He doth not run wealth, nor same honours and virtues, upon more oqu ally Common benefits are to be communicate with tall, but peculiar benefits with choice " He regards the attempt to eradicate anger from the heart of man as a mere piece of philosophic idealism, unattainable in this imperfect state " We have better oracles-be angry, but sin not, let not the sun go down upon your anger anger must be limited, and confined both in race and in time The inherent antagonism of the old and the now, the progressive and the c servative tendencies in human nature, the Radical and the Tory theories of politics, he attempts to harmonise in the words of Jeremiah "Surely the day love of the prophet is the true direction in this matter state super liar, antiques, at riders quarters at uni recta 1 bona, et ambulate in an Antiquity deserveth that reverence that men should make a stand there upon, and discover what is the best way , but when the discovery is well taken, then to make progression " in his enthusiasm for science he often imagines he detected prophetic allusions to the discoveries of modern times, which, however ingenious, it must be confessed are sometimes rather fanciful Thus he quaintly interprets the text, "Thou glory of God is to com- call a thing, but the glory of the King is to find it cut," " as if according to the innocent play of children, the Divine Majesty took delight to hide His works, to the end to turn They found out and as if kings could not obtain a greater honour than to be God's playfellows in that came " Ti in a passage in Daniel he infers that " proficiency in navigation and discoveries was ordained by God to be corral with proficiency and augmentation of all sciences For so the prophet Daniel, speaking of the latter times, fortieth I'lmiiiupeitiaiisiiuul, tt multiplex cut militia , as if the openness and through-passage of the world I and the increase of knowledge were appointed to be in the same ages."
