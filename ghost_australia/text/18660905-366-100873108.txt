When the horses drew up- for the start Tim Whilllor became very restless, and broke away from the rest, causing some delay. At length a tolerable line was formed, the flag fell, and the lot dashed off, Ludia and Varrovillo getting the worst of it. Bo fore a hundred yards had been travelled over, Gul maro was in front, with Little Robin second, the favourite third, lluccaneer fourth, and the two fillies fifth and sixth. This order was maintained up to Derby corner, and into 'the straight running. In passing the stand Gulnaro had a strong lead, Tim Whiffler lying second, Little Robin third, Varro villo fourth, Buccaneer fifth, and Ludia last. After passing the rocks turn, the favourite shook off the horses that had up to that point been in close attend ance, and at the back of the course the gap between him and the rock widened at every stride. He now essayed to reach Gulnaro, whom he wds overhauling fast; he reached her girths as they passed the trainers' stand, but could not get in front, as the filly was well in hand and had lots of running loft. At the distance post Stone pulled out his whip and plied it vigorously in vain; the 22 lbs. difference in the woights told its tale, and the little mare came home an easy winner by two lengths, untouched by wmip or spur. Luaui wao notweon twenty anu thirty lengths behind Tim Whifiler, Buccaneer was fourth, Little Robin fifth, and Varrovillo last. Time, .3 minutos 415 seconds.

Betting: Even on'Fieshhoolk, to p . against The Barb, 6 to 1 against Bylong, 10 to 1. against any other. - The flag fell to an excellent start, and so close wore they for the first hundred yards that it was im possiblo to see which was lending. When they passed the distance-post the first time, thoy. had settled down into their paces, and in plassing the stand The Barb was leading, with Blhir Athol second, Sir Jothn third, Bylong fourth, the favourite fifth, and Buds light last. In this order they passed the roeks turn, and raeood towards the Donison turn,, where Bylong ran into the third place, Sir John falling off. Fishhook now began to mako play, and he very soon improved hii position, having passed Sir John, and immediately afterwards Bylong. When opposite the now stand, and approaching the Derby corner, The Barb had a lead of a length, Blair Athol still lying second; and the Hook close up. So they came on into the straight running, when the favourite made a futile effort to reacn Mr. Tait's colt. He passed Blair Athol, however, but was immediately afterwards collared by Bylong, who boat him by:a length for second placo, The Barb being about three lengths in front of Bylong. Blair Athol was fourth, Budolight fifth, and Sir John last. The Barb pulled off tho great prize without being asked to race from start to finish; indeed the mile and a half spin was but a canter for him. Time, 2 niinutes 48 e seconds. FOUr R nACe;-Tho Innkeepers' Stakes of 7 sovereigns oacl, with 70 sovereigns added; for three years and upward, which have not won a prize ex ccoding 100 sovereigns in value up to the time of entranco; a winner of such a prizo thereafter to carry Ilbs. extra: maidens at starting allowed 6 Ibs.; 1S mile; ssaond horse to ireceiveo14 sovereigns out 61 the prize.

Theire was a good deal of diffculty in gotting the horses together for the start in this raco. At the first attempt Marcuas and Iamlet brokeo away, and tho former ran a coosiderablo distance beforo ahe eould be induced to talo his place at tho starting point. At length something like a lino was formed, and the horses were soent away, but the start was a very bad one. The loading horses wore lengths away before the remainder started, Albert, who was supposed to Iave a good chance for it, being the most nnfortunato of all. Voare informed, however, that his bad start was owing in a great moeasro to the man who hold him holding him after the flag was lowered. Hamlet got the best of it at the start, and lae madea tho most of it for the first couplq of hundred yards. Bracolet was second, Dundoee third, and the ruck immediately in the rear. ]raeolet gradually overhauled HIamlet, and Dundeeo losed lup also, so that in passing the Derby corner the three were altogether. Bracelet eventually showed in front, and he camo up the straight running with at leoad ofa length; at the distance post at rush was made by the whole of tho horses immediately behind, and before Cano could put on the steam, boeing ovi dently aunder the impression that he had the raco in hand, Rapidan, Dundee, and several others were upon him, the former and Bracelet finishing with a dead heat. Dundoo was third by half a loength, and Orphan was so close upon him that it was impossible to seo from the stand which had the advantage. It was the finest finish that we have soon at Imandwicle for many a day, and it may be long before we look uopon its liteo again. The dead teat was run off about half-an-holr after wards. Rnapjdan led all the way from the post, and won by a head, both jockoys using the whip fromn the distance post. This terminated the day's sports, and immo diatoly afterwards there was a rush mado homo wards.
