THE CABLE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. - | Sir., Although the Conference on the Duplication of the Cable between Australasia and Europe, held in January February of this year, ended without any practical result, there was one matter brought before the notice of its members up in which I think some definite action might have been, but at least should now be taken allude to the offer of the Netherlands-India Steam Navigation Company to enter into a contract by which, in the event of a break in the cable between Port Darwin and Banjoewangie, they would at once provide a steamer to run with despatches bctucuthos-eports ToeCompant askediornoiemureiatiou until such a unions mentionedshouldhe found necessary, to the colonies would be at no expense unless communic to be interrupted.
