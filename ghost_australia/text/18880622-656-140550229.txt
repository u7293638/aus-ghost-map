A Russian Ghost Story. When llu Winter Valaca was llnishf/i the cm press- appointed a day for taking posses sion of it j and tho elite of the guards, find a corps which was composed entirely of noble men, mounted guard iu the new castle. A long, dark corridor lead to tlio middle door of the white or throne-room. In tbe corridor two young noblemen wero posted. It was approaching ten o'clock and tho arrival of ? the empress was momentarily expected. Sud. .-. ilenly tiie attention of tho young men wero - attracted by a bright streak of light which seemed to Elide between them in tho dark passage. Their eyes followed the light, and they saw that it streamed through tho Uey-: i hole of the throne-room. Who could ha-yo' any business Jat such anvmnsua'. hour 'in' n ? room flrl'ich was designated only for tho re ception of foreign ambassadors? Ono oi the young men considered it his duty to investi-1 gate tho matter, and approached the door for that purpose, but as soon as ho hail glanced through tho keyhole ho called to his companion in a whisper to come nearer. -. ' The cmpres3 has already arrived,' whifp.' sred he ; she is seated on the throno.dircctiy opposite to tho door.' ? - The other also looked through tho aperture and soon verified this to be a fact. The em press -was seated in a tranquil dignityon an elevated golden stool under the red velvet-, canopy, .richly adorned with the imperial' arms of Russia, n double eagle. Tbo room' was brilliantly lighted; but it wa3 irnpbs' aible to ascertain if any other peroous wero: present, as tho thickness of tlio door-lock allowed no side view of tho apartment' The' young men returned to their po'sla^ and waited. Not long after one of tho higher officers appeared and said,— .-??;'??:?? ' You can all now retire : tho empress will not como to-night.' ' . ?-. ' ??;,! ' But her majesty is already hero.' ' :': .' 'What? Who?' : - ' ' ' Her majesty is in the throne-room.' ' 'Impossible!' ? ? ??[?'??? ' Yon can see for yourself.' ? :'??-.:-?: '? The officer looked, immediately :rcn6eV nised tho empress, and said wonderiugly,--^'' ''I cannot understand what tho inarsha-' means. Ho has just arrived, and ordered' that all tho guards bo withdrawn ? tha empress has changed her mind1,1 and will not arrive to-night. NcYcrtbe less, I see .that she is here. Could she have come secretly ? At all events I will ascer tain whut new order the marshal has issued. Meanwhile do you remain here as the em press may pass this way,' The marshal, Prince Kuratin, was f-irtn- nntely in the palace, and as soon as he hoard of the mysterious report hastened to tho cor-' ridor, an;': peeped in his turn through tho keyhole, ' My God, it is the empress ' Her majesty herself ! What can it mean ?' exclaimed he. ' How can this bo possible, when I havn just left her presence ? She was dressed in hor usual every-day attire, and I sco her iu her own royal robes and jewels. There must be ? some mystery behind this: Let all entrances to the throne-room ha guarded! Let no one go in or out! I will hasten to report at once.' Tbe distance between tho two houses beiu5- quite short, the marshal soon reached the small palace,temporarily occupied by tho empress. ' Where is the empress ?' ; ' In her sleeping apartment.' . ? ' The prince looked at the lady of honor with suspicion, and said sharply. — ' Aro you sure that the empress is here ?' ' OE couise j she is preparing to retire.' ' Inform her instantly that I am here.' In a few minutes Prince Kuratin,: much excited, was eondncted into the empress' chamber. The empress stood- before him in in night negligee. ? Kuratin turned pale. ' Well,' said the empress, ' you look' as i£ you had seen a ghost. What in' Heaven's name is the matter with you 1 Is there any news from the army?' .-' : Kuratin hurriedly related what ho bud seen. .. ? ?'???.- . ' It is a knavish trick,' cried Elizabeth. ?' We will take a nearer look' at theso dome diaus. .1 -frill go in your sleigh, Kuratin ;' you can mount-behind. Hurry.' Arrived at the Winter Palace, tho cjh leliun was ordered to bring the key of ths throne room j six grenadiers wero com manded to load -their guns, and led by tho' -.empress the little troop betook themselves to the corridor. .1 ?-.', The light shone as boforo through the key hole. Tho door was cautiously opened and a Hood of light filled the corridor. The lerapress stepped within tho room', followed ,by her guard, who placed themselves around her. The room was brilliantly illuminated, but empty. On the throne was seated a 'suapc, tin; counterpart or JJlizabeth arrayed ? in purple and ermine, covered with : ?diamonds, and crowned with ;the royal dia dem. One instant Elizabeth ; gazed steadfastly at hor double, then. moved ior i ward a few steps.
