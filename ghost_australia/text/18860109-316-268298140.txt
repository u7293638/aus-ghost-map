"You are a very young lawyer," replied-; the.ghoBt withia sort of a post mortem sneer.:; " If you examine the teeth of that skeleton you will find the oneon the left lower-side, rnext the hack filled with silver, and, 'if neces-; sary, I;can tell your intelligent, jury the sort of cap that is under the silver to cover the, nerve tbat onco waa there." All the young men looked at J. W., who, aa if enjoying the point made by its -other self,' suddenly clickea down its jaw and beamed on; Fulmcr with its "eilent laugh. Wcntworth took-up the lamp and looked at the loweE law. " Yes, Fulmer," he said, " that's so." : .

" See'here;" said Wentworth, " you-ara not • tha man we dissected; I believe you're a, fraud." '---•'-•.; " Do you ?•' returned the ghost. " I'll convmce yoti in order to save myself further trouble. I can : take r any one's form. For instance, that ot a rising lawyer." And with that the figure before them was an exact counterpart of young Fulmer. T ". The next instant the ghost was himself agam. " By jove," aaid Smilie, " what a splendid bghtnmg change artist he would make;-' . " Say, 1 ' said l?ulmer, " what would you take for a night at> tue -big hall? :You could pereonc,te the head of the University and sing," I I - want to- -be an As gel' with .splendid effect." " I em m so mood for ohaffj" said the specter, severely. " Finally, will you give up my skeleton ?' " Let h:m have hia old bones,",said Smilie, " I .certainly will not," cried Wentworth. " V/hy, Smilie, I had to drill 150 holes in that Bkeleton. No, sir I J.

" What are you going to do, Wentworth ? It's you and the ghost, it aeems." 1 • • : • " Do ? Why, keep J. W., of course." : Next day -there was-an. aetonnding charge against Wentworth. v A passenger commg up •from'Detroit by the early tram had been met on the road from the station by a student exactly-answering'Went-worth's description,; who demanded money at rthe point of a pistol,- and the passenger-would -have undoubtedly been robbed if two others coming along had •not frightened the culprit, who escaped. •Nothing but Smilie s solemn oath that Wentworth was asleep at the time—it was Saturday morning; saved Wentworth. On Sunday all Ann Arbor was soandahsed aa ifc eama from church by seeuig, Wentworth staggering along the street m a state of heaatly intoxication.- The professors hauled him over the coals, and it was m vam that he protested he had spent the day worthily, trying to catch fish up the river. He went home mad and, as J. W. grinned at jhini as he came m; he seized the ruler and "smashed-iu the trap door jaw. The ruler did not pass through the bony part-of J. W., as it did through its spectral counterpart. ' Next day Wentworth was too ill to attend eclass; Smilie left lum and wended his way to college He had just taken hia Beat while the Professor was jotting down names prepare' tory to a'' quiz.'.when an.unearthly yell attracted all ea ±o the top tier of - seats that, descended' one by one down to the operating table.. There stood Wentworth on the back 1 o£-the highest eeat :" One, two, three, look out for me," he shouted, and with that he ran swiftly down ihe backs of the seats,- jumping over the stu-; dents' heads, hopping:hghtly on-the " subject" that lay covered up on the revolvmg plank, then sprang among the lady students who, Bcattered'Ecreaming, and thence up to the top of tha-oppoait-e tier.
