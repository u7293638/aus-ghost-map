DIOCESE OF BALLAEAT. (Jr/om cur Own Correspondent)i At the Cathedral on Sunday, it -Wag announced by .'the Eev. G.Doyle, thatâ€žthe blessing of the stations by thie Bishop would take place about the third Sunday in July. 'There is a Catholic Society of Ladies in our midst,"which has been doing good work in an unostentatious manner for several years past. I refer to the St. Yinceht de Paul's Society in connection with the Loretto Convent. A number of the Catholic ladies of Ballarat belong to this admirable society. These good ladies pay regular visits to the Catholio sick poor of the city, and supply them with clothing and other necessaries, as far as their funds will allow, besides affording them advice and consolation. The newly established College of the Holy Ghost, which was opened only a few months Bince, is making fcre&tprogress; under the* presidency of Fr. Reffe, and will, I have no doubt, when the time comes, sustain the. great reputation of the College at Blackrock, Dublin. The Fathers are assisted by a staff of lay professors!: On Sunday, ,the 23rd ult., a procession of the Children of Mary took place at St. Joseph's Convent School, on which. occasion the Eev. J. J. Cleary received 30 members. The rev. gentleman addressed a few words to them on the devotion of the Sacred Heart.
