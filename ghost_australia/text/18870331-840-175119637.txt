A GHOST STOUT. A conitEBroxDEirr from Coppabella writes : 'Allow mo to- trespass on your valuablo space to give an account of a curious sight that was sten in this locality. It made its first appear ance on the 14th February, when it came to a iiouso ana mado a cuoaatiu noise m the dead hour of the night, when everything was quiet, and frightened all the occupants. It was not heard of again until the night of the 21st of February, when the same dreadful noise was heard, and the inmates of tho house got up, when they saw walking around the room an object which they took to bo the devil. Find ing (hat talking to it was of- no use, they tried what result a little ammunition would do, and after firing throe shots it disappeared, and has not been seen since. Tlio figure was between G and 7 feet in height, with a head the shape of a. pig, and when broadside on it appeared to be nearly 3 feet across the chest. Our correspon dent further adds that he has never scon such a sight before, and if any person could describe the animnl to him he would bo extremely obliged, as he is anxious to know what it is.' â€” Yams Courier.
