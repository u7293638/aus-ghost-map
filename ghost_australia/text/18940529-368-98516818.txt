A Liar ofa Ghost. WE (Cootamundra Herald) have received from an old friend a copy of a paper in which is given a description of mysterious visitations to a family named Stein, frugal German settlers in the Braidwood district- periodical visits of an invisible man, who talks with the family, sometimes agreeably, sometimes dis agreeably, who throws the domestic utensils about, and who drives the dogs bowling crazy. In answer to inquiries (giving the name of George William Herbert) he has stated, among other things, that " his father died in the Cootamundra hospital eighteen years ago." Our friend marks this "crammer," or freak of ghostly memory, with crimson ink to a'tract our notice. Well he might, as the Cootamundra Hospital had no existence eighteen years ago-not even the gaol hos hospital; Cootamundra itself was then only in its first stage of infancy If this "Coal baggie Invisible Being" will come along this way we will be happy to interview him.
