LABOUR AND TAXATION. TO THE EDITOR. Sir — If Mr. Liston thinks to beguile me into a discussion about land monopoly, single tax, &.c, he makes a great mistake. He enquires if I deny the accuracy of certain calculations proving something which he has demonstrated on the public platform. No, I don't deny it. Why should 1? I might as well deny the existence of a ghost after having pointed out to me the very house which the spectre haunted. On the contrary, I am ready to drink Mr. Liston 's health (at his expense) with musical honours. He thinks I should perhaps be astonished were I told that land is neither capital, wealth, norproperty ; but I should not be astonished at anything told me by a single tax man, and Mr. L. is quite welcome to call it anything he likes. Old Squeers said .that -a man may call his noose an island if he _ chooses, and though Squeers' was not a nice fellow I endorse the sentiment. All I want Mr. Liston to do is to tell me whether he thinks that a man obtaining a revenue of £100 per annum from land valued at £1,000 ought to pay a tax of £12 10s., and if so, why? The question is simply enough, and I don't want to be bothered with calculations that I could not understand, especially as this is just the time to be clearing off weeds and sowing, cucumbers, melons, anc marrows. I am pleased to learn that old Nebuchadnezzar displayed a decided change for the better in his conduct, for that there was room for improvement his best friends must allow, and so with kind regards to all who, are adopting a grass or thistle diet with a view to reformation, lam, Sir, &a;, M.H.FURNISS.
