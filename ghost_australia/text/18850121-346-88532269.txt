EilPIIiE. Sandhurst, 15th Jan. A Gh'.sti.y Jok~..—The Christian World says :—'"The ghastly joke," as the sending of a dead body 10 the Home Secretary was so forcibly characterised. has found its way into Parliament, and the Eev. John Zdirehouse, vicar of Colsierivorth, comes very badly out of it. The. story, r.s told by -Sir Willi.m Barceurt, reveals the most revolting protest against giving NoncsHformsts decent sepul ture that a clergyman has yet been able to invent. The church yard at Colsterworth having been closed, a buriil bvard was con stituted in which the vicar had the principal voice. It was proposed to make t'.vo burial grounds, one for the Church people, and the other for Dissenters. The portion of gr und allotted to the Nonconformists was a disused quarry. The arran'.'Otaent vras most distasteful to the Dissenters, who objected to a second burial-ground being con temptuously provided for them in the very teeth of the Act, and seeing thai they were largely in the majority. They accordingly carried their complaint to the Home secre tary, who remonstrated with the vicar. As an act of revenge the clergyman became possessed of the body of a stii!-born infant, and forwarded it in a box to the Home Secretary. When changed with the dis graceful proceeding, .Mr. Mirehouse denied all knowledge of it, but afterwards confessed that he sent the box to the Home Oiiice. Sir Wiiliam Harcourt will very rightly try to bring about a prosecution of the vicar for hi3 offence against decency : and failing in this direction, he will place the conduct of Mr. Mirehouse before his Bishop. A Fatal Rixie.—AnEnglish paper says :— The excessive coldness of the weather which we are experiencing even in En gland has been sur passed in Central Europe, if we may judge by the reports that reach us. It is said that in Hungary the wolves have been driven by the heavy snowstorms from the Carpathian mountains into the cultivated districts, and in one case a pack of 120 wolves entered a village while the inhabitants were at church a id had to be driven out by troops. A very horrible story is told of the fate that befel a priest, who, with hir wife and child, went lately on a sledge to Lonka. On the -.vay they were pursued by wolves, the horses bolted from fright, and in the confusion the the priest's ivife dropped her child among the pack. The father immediately jumped out to save the infant, but both he and it were torn to pieces. Whe.i the sledge arrived in Lonka it bore into the village only tho corpses of a mother and the babe which had entered tile world during the mad flight over the snow. A;.* old gentleman having been invited by an acquaintance to yo out and see his coun try seat, went, and found the country feat to be a stump in a large meadow. Mil. Cl-T, of " Cist's Cincinr.atti Adver tiser," requests correspondents imt to append E.vj. to his name. lie says—" It is inapplic able to me. Ksijuire is derived from the French, "Eucyer," a stableboy or ostler. I have not cleaned a stable for over 40 years." A Ghost Story.—A farmer, who had lately become a widower, was aroused at midnight by the loud barking of his dog. On going to it the animal displayed extreme terror, where upon the farmer took his gun and proceeded to an inspection (says the Launctston Ex'-r,nb\r-r). All at once he saw a phantom clothed in a white shc-ei rise behind the hedge. The farmer turned deadly pale, and his limbs shook with dismay. He, however, contrived to ejaculate, "If you come from heaven, speak; if from the evil one, vanish!" " Wretch," exclaimed the phantom, " I am your deceased wife, come from the grave to warn you not to marry iMarion A , to whom you are making love. The only woman to succeed mcs is Henrietta B , marry her or persecution aud eternal torment shall be your doom." This strange address front the goblin, instead of dismaying the fanner, re stored his courage. He accordingly rushed the ghostly visitor, and stripping oil'the sheet discovered the fair Henrietta herself, looking extremely foolish. It is'said that the farmer, admiring the girl's trick, had the banns pub lished for his marriage with her. " Good-bye.—Did you ever hear two women take leave of each other at the front door ? This is how they do it: "Good-bye." " Good-bye. Come down and see us soon." " I will, Good-bye." " Good-bye, don't for get to come soon." " No, I won't. Don't you forget to corae up." " I won't. Be sure to bring Sarah Jane with you next time." " I will. I'd have brought he)5 this time, but she wasn't very well. She wanted to come awfully." " Did she now 1 That was too bad. Be sure and bring her nest time." " I will ; and you be sure to bring baby." " I will. 1 forgot to tell you that he's cut another tooth." " You don't say so ? How many has he no-.v V' " Five. It makes him awfully cross !". " I dare say it does, this hot weather." "Well, good-bye, don't for get to come down." " Xo, I won't. Don't you forget to come up. Good-bye." And they separate. Duiun'g the sermon one of the quartett fell asleep. " Now's your chants," said tho organist to the soprano. "See if you can ticle the tenor." "You wouldn't dare duet," said the contralto. " You'll wake hymn up," suggested the bass. "I could make a better , pun than that, as sure as my name is Psalm." remarked the boy that pumped the organ ; but he said it nolo that no one quartett.
