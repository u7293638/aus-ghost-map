THE LADIES' COLUMN The Old Path. The same old path! Lon year have flown Since last I trod itsway; I scarcely thought-such change I've known--. To fiud its marks to day. But still its lovely course I trace, Unchanged, by fence and rill, Through meadow, wood acd briery place, Ando'er the verdant hill. And in the valey, far ahead, The evening shadows hold The house to which my footsteps led In twilight hours of old. Who treads the path ?-who dwells there now?' SI neither know nor care; I only know no tender brow And voice await me there.. And that to walk that quito trail * Would give me such deep pain As all my soul could not avail To drive from me again. Alas I knor not where thou art, What time has done with thee 'Tis hut the ghost of my young heart Which haunts this place and me. But I would give my life'sebest pride, Cohld this old path once more But lead me, dearest, to thy side. And to the love of yore ! Tnoi 1I.
