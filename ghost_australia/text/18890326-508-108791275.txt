ANOTHEB GHOST GONE. The shadowists are losing their bogies or ] ghosts one by one. A most serviceable ghost has i just disappeared at the appearance of the returns of trade between freetrade New South Wales and protectionist- America. Last year we imported from the States goods of the value of .Â£967.528, but we exported to the States goods to the value of ^1,044,144: It is to be hoped the Protection 'Union' of Sydney will immediately point out to the United States people how under protection their money is going out of the country.
