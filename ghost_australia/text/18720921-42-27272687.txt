ODD NOTES.—BY A BOHEMIAN. THE" Education Quettion" is gettiug a tolerably complete overhaul by one or other of late. You see it's a very catching subject to people who have the slightest inclination to write to the papers at aIL Like the land que*, tion, everybody it interested in it, everybody nnderatanda it, and hat a brand new theory of hit own about>4^|^entilato whioh afford* ex quisite pleasure aSktatitfaction to the ven tilator. The only fault I have to fiud with th* newspaper controversy so far it, that it haa been confined exclusively to the exposition of the view* of adultt upon the tubjeot, whereat tho opiniont of that more numerou* half of the community moit directly affected—the ■' rising generation," at the Rev. Jeremiah Choker calls them—have been utterly ignored. What do you •ay—they don't know anything about it f Don't they. Make no mistake, my dear Sir* They bold very clear and definite aentiment* on the aubject, if you will take the trouble to ascer tain them. It it easily done. Juat oat oh • youn i* school- boy, and requett hia aatiatance to put out of sight a bag of Camm'a " beat tottey," a bunch of bananas, a dozen apple*, aome ]-— tart**, cheese caket, and any other toothsome fruit* or confection* you can oolleot. While yonr young friend it busy with th* provender, you pretending to help, atart a conversation about parsons, schoolmasters, pupil teachers, monitors, school lessons, the relative value <jf different kinda of lessons, the manner in whioh they are imparted, and the apirit in which they are received. Don't use bard words, or Ist v appearthatyou are trying to draw out your guest, otherwiae he will ourl up and silently concentrate hi* effort* upon the eatable*, or indulge only in comment* upon their relative merit* aa artiolei of food. Don't put " leading" questions, •* the lawyer* call th«m, or you will only get the antwert the infant thinka you would like to get —for a schoolboy, under such circumstances, ig very accommodating. So, all you have to do is to volunteer certnin general opinion* on the a bject of schools, with the air of a man who don't expect an anawer, or at least don't oar* whether he get* one or not—and that boy will give you the result of his experience end medi tation on the whole queation—with th.> most charming candor. It makes no matter whether he attendt a National or Denominational •ohool, hit reverence for all thote in authority over him it about tbe same, and in terse, idiomatic, and vigorous rchoolboy English—, you will bo informed of teveral brings, tbat even the National School Board would be none the worse for knowing. If the boy belongs to one of the Church of England schools, you will be astonished, among other things, at the small progress he bas made toward* becoming a proselyte to that Cbureh, and <he very low estimation in which he holds the Bishop and clergy of thia diocese. He hat nickname* for them, sp aks disparagingly of their mental powers, and evidently regards them as fair subjects for any amount of humbug ging. lam not at all surprised that the Bishop is anxious to secure a more complete control over the schools, for it must be very clear to him that unless this it done, the ohanoe of recruiting the Churchet from the schools is very slight indeed, and the prospect of ettablitbing a dominant Church supported by the State is as good as lost. It is very gratifying to learn that the Hospital Committee have ay erted, fur a time at least, the ' calamity with whioh they were threatened by the Government, thanke to the exertion* of Dr. O'Doherty and hi* friend*. Tbe committee have mauuged ao well hitherto that it would be a thousand pities to see them displaced by a board aj. pointed by tho Government, with no power or patron., ge in their handa worth apeaking of. How, under auoh circum stances, could a committee-man serve hia friends or punish his ene-j ie*; how oould he maintain his di nity as a committee-man; or, in fact, what would be I he use of being oa the committee at allP Supposing, tor instance,a nominee board had been in office the other week, do you think Dr. Mul len would havo been asked to accept a cheque for £20 " in recognition of his services aa anting house-surgeon for time weeks," when the di* penter did mnst of the work" and got nothing extra? Would it be likely that a nominee board of management could keep the. resi dent house- surgeon under proper tubjeotion and control, and *cc that tbe dispenser did not lavish away the epsom salt* and senna upon convalescents P Is it at all within the bounds of probability that auoh a committee or board would trouble themselves about the cockroaches in the cooking kitchen, or the silverfish in the storerooms P Not they. Tbey would be so completely under subjection to tbe Colonial Secretary, that tbey would be' afraid to do anything except direct the manage ment and ace that the money waa expended in auch a manner aa would satisfy the Govern ment. They would not insist upon it that ** pauper" funerals should be conduoted " with despatch," and the contracting undertaker would be allowed to go at a walking pace when be wa* taking pauper* to tbeir last resting place* or he might be required even to provide a minister of religion to conduot some burial servioe at the grave. There is no telling bow iur the demorali sation might exte.d. And what would be more humiliating than everything else, certain active and zealoun men who now always manage to get on the committee, and have thing* pretty much their own way, would not stand the ghost of % A chance of ever getting a) pointed then. It is not to be supposed for one moment that the outside publio would continue to subscribe te the fundi of the institution a ben this wus the case; and to at last the hospital would have to be closed or supported entirely by Government money. I aui glad Bramston took tbe thing in the right light and left the old oommittee intact. I don't believe it centralisation, but rather wish to)tee tbe principle of local government extended. That is why I grew anxious this lsst week about the Municipal election. 1 thought the ratepayers were going to let another " licensed victualler" in. I like licensed victualler* very well indeed, but seeing thut one-third of the aldermen already belong to this class I think we have enough of that sort for the present as rulers »f the > uy. If all our uldermen were pub* lioant the Good Templars might growl. Already there hare t c n symptoms of di»:«aU«f*otion among thete people at tome of the lute proceeding* *of the Council. Certain cantunkerou* water drink. r«, for instanoe, complain of one of the "victualler" aldermen for getting a contract increased twenty-five per cent, without calling for fresh tenders first; end the only exouse they 'nave fur complaining it—thut the contrac tor! are good cuatomers ol the alderman in ques tion. B<>n:c people are so evil minded ar d aus picious that they iiieeowr jobbery and corrup tion in the most simple und straightforward business transaction, or the purert act of bene volence. I have ii > doubt whatever that the ul.lei-m .n in question propo.Lil the addition to tliut contract from tho highest and purest oi motives, and if, from a st-nxo of gratitude, the contractors spend the extra money at bis house—what i« that to 'anybody, I ahould like to know ? Jbti't gratitude a commendable and becoming quality in a man? Would it have been a proper thing for those contractors to gO past their benefactor's door, aud spend the 26 per cent. at eoinobody else's house P What n*xt, I »hould hkn to know.
