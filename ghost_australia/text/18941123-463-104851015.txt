Register ;— ' There are two tricks by which these apparently- -wonderful ghost piclures'CMi be produced su as ti- presfent a realistic effect.- One is to give to the photographic negative half an expnstire in front of some person masquerading in a white sheet, and afterwards to complete the exposure in front of soir.e ordinary sitter. -The effect is somewhat fltartlins, for the form of the .seo^nd .sitter can be distinctly seen through the figure of the first. The second- trick is to insert in the camera .a piece of , glans on vhich hai been marked- ^beforehand the outline of the gliojnly figure, not in visible paint, but in bi-sulphate of quinine or some otlifir-fluoreacent invisibje.solutjon.
