ADDLTEHATKÂ» LIQUOR. SEVERAL Sydney publicans have recently been fined pretty heavily for selling bad liquor. In every case tho accused pleaded guilty, but declared that the liquor was exactly as they hud received it troin the wholesale merchants, with tho exception that it had been mixed with the usual quantity of pure water. The excuse, how- ever, did not avail with the magistrates, who were assured that the publicans only were guilty in connection with the matter. Or it may be, that they considered that if they accepted the explanation, it would be impos- sible to punish any retail vendor of doctored Fjrog. It is quite possible that some of the iquor supplied by wholesale merchants to publicans Is bnd, in which case the latter are to be pitied when they come within the grasp of the btw for selling the same ; but it would not follow from that that the wholesale men were also culpable, for I understand that they do not analyse the spirits which they import. They take it for granted that they are of standard quality. Government inspection and analysis at the bonded stores is, I think, the only effective way of prevent- ing bad liquor from getting into the whole- sale establishments. If that were done, no publican would have the ghost of a defence when charged with the crime of selling a mixture of white spirit, fusal oil, etc., for good brandy. But I fear it will be a long; time before the Government takes any action in this direction ; its time is pretty fully occupied in obeying the commands of its masters, the Labour party.
