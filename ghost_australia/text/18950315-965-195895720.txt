A CHURCH 1 VISITED LAST SUNDAY. [Br THE UNOBSERVED OBSERVER.] "Nothingis certain but surprises," mi the surprising remark of a certain French* man. I certainly felt the truth of the remark on Sunday evening. On that occasion I marched complacently into a Little Bethel on the corner of Cannon-street^ expecting to behold that irrepressible little gentleman* the Rev. John Lightfoot, occupying the little rostrum, but I was disappointed. Some guardian angel must have apprised the reve* rend gentleman of my approach, perhaps like the witches in Macbeth, John Lightfoofc mentally exclaimed, By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes, and accordingly he eloped. We are all humbugs, and none the less 80 because we persuade ourselves that we are not, and I must confess that I was humbug enough to expect very little from the humbfe looking individual who occupied the rostram aforementioned. I had another surprise ia store. It has become a generally accepted idea that it requires a man of education and culture to preach the Gospel of the Nazarene carpenter, and that the successors of the fishermen apoBtles must study at college*, and graduate at universities. This is equialent to saying that the Holy Ghost require! an educated subject to work upon. Si* preacher on this occasion was a layman of the humbler sort—he looked like a bootmaker, bat he gave a capital address, COKtabling sound practical Gospel teaching. Sirange to say, the subject he chose was the statement of St. Paul that "We preach Ch ist ci'ucificd, to tbc Jews a stumbling* i lout, to the Grieks foolishness." Well, that bootmaker whose grammar was somewhat defioit'^, and wh^so manner was a trifle u'li-ov^, undeis ood what he WM talking abor.,, and struck right into the heart of thejmatter. He did preach " Christ ucified,' which is what many an educated man faiis to do. I am not errii^ to enter into details abi ut li s pennon, but though illarranged it might have been, strange as itl delivery was, it ii-d the real grit in it—It was no spuriuus article—it was a rough diamond. Now, education could have polished that homely discourse wonderfully, bat education, cannot make the genuine article, all it can do is to give it the fiuishing touches. There is.no leceint fur wuninenps"- »*• belnnga fo * man simply because it is given to him. The preacher's sarcastic touches on the respect paid to worldly position were very refresh* ing. The little mission chapel in which ihto. homely address was given is used by tliS Primitive Methodists, and as their natnt implies, they belong to a former generation* They are primitive—there can be no mistake about that. The singing is primitive—very* There were about a score of persons present, but strength does not always lie in numbers. Since I have been visiting the churches, I have been forced to arrive at the conclusion that, although every church fills its own particular place, the lower you get in the social scale, the more genuine theartiole becomes. RECEIVED.—The latest addition of the Life Saving Society Handbook. The in* structions contained therein for the rescue of the drowning, and the restoration of the apparently drowned, are invaluable, and should be retained in every household. YACHTING DEMONSTRATION.—A fine day, with a &ood; sea breeze, enabled the yachts* men of the R.S.A. and H.B. Yacht Clabs to make their combined demonstration *% Glenelg on Saturday last a huge success. Each clab was fiirly well represented, and the evolutions performed at the signals of the two commodores made a very pretty sight indeed. Afternoon tea in the Town Hall, under the patronage of His Worship the Mayor (Mr. R. Smith) was a fitting con* c u~ion to the demonstration, and was heartily enjoyed by the large number of people present. In the evening the mem* bers of the two clubs were entertained in the Ciub-house by the vocal and elocutionaxy taieni of each club. \WCAI.
