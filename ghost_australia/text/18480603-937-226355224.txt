HOW MANY MORE? We trust that the Government will now edmit the necessity of taking steirs to diminish (if not to prevent) the facilities for shipwreclc, which the nresent " tin. protected" state of the Port Phillip Heads so greatly increase. Upon every principle of humanity and self-interest it behoves the public to urge upon the Government the imperative necessity of adopting measures to prevent further sacrifices, by the establishment of the required lights at the ' entrance oi the Heads. Within a few days two successive instances of shipwreck, one with the loss of four lives, and both with the total destruction of the ves sels, have originated from the same cause and in the same locality ; these instances we know of? how many may have shared their fate of which we know nothing, and how many may yet swell the list? Our Town Council not un- frequently shews a disposition to meddle with matters foreign to its jurisdiction ; here (tn the absence of any other re monstrance) they have ample induce ments for the exercise of their preroga tive ; they should, without loss of time, petition the Sydney Government upon the point. To expect any move ment front Mr. LA THOilE in the affair, would be to expect honey from hemlock. Unhappy man ! no ghosts ever rose with more jtislico before Gloster's couch, than those which should fright the conscience of the " withering curse" of Port Phillip. At Mr. LA TROPE'S door lies the moral guilt the sad catastrophies we have chronicled.
