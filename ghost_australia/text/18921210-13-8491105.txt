CURRENT LITERATURE. -a As we have already pointed out, there is a pathetic interest in the last little volume in green which comes out, like the tender branching from the sullen oak, with the name of Alfred Tennyson, Poet Laureate, inscribed upon it Before the Death of Gnome, Akbar Dream, and Other Poems (Macmillan) the crimes voice is almost silenced It is impossible to listen to these last notes from the tongue that is for ever still without the feeling has never more will it sing for us again It is " the touch of a vanished hand, the " sound of a voice that is still ' For six) years line the Using bah world been mmihurwith the note and it is surely a marvel that it should retain nearly all its sweetness and its strength 'to say that these last poems heir no mark of age or of taking powers, would be to pretend that the mortal can know no decay Yet, while there is nothing in this volume quite as good as " Crossing the Bar, ' there is much that will give delight to that large circle of Tennyson's admirers which his death may be said to have widened 'the "Death of CEnone" is the complement and sequel of the beautiful poem written in the poets youth, taken from the story in " Quintus Colaber, ' how that they brought the dying Pana " P iris, no longer beauteous as a god, struck) a poisoned arrow in the tight, Lame, crooked, reeling livid - to be cured by his cart) love, the nymph (Ltione She hears a w ruling cry) from her old lover -"'Saverne Thou knowest, taught by some god whatever hLrb or balm May clear the blood from poison, and thy fame Is blown through all the hotel and to the the shepherd brings his ladder bitten lamb, The wounded warrior climbs from Troy to thee (Lone, in the) love which once was mine, Help, heal me I am poisoned to the heart * And 1 to mine she said!

Mr. Joseph Pennell has with pen and pencil taken off The Jew at Home (Heine many, in a series of sketches done in Russia, and Austria The pictures are most in lovely, and are calculated to deepen the prejudice against the foreign immigrants who go in shoals, with dirt and cholera in their train, to swell the seething mass 01 | poverty in England If Mr Pennell is to be believed, there is no creature on earth so revolting as the Russian Jew, except the Austrian The Jew of Brody (which is a large town on the Galician border) seems to be a particular") mission.) specimen of the race Mr Pennell sums him up by declaring that " the Austro-Hungarian Jew produces nothing lives on nothing, and apparently wants nothing His home is cheerless his costume is disreputable, and he stands around doing nothing with his hands in a country where everyone else of his class is at work takes a pride in his home, and dresses like a picture The Jew of Brod), as here depicted, is dirt) unkempt vicious, degraded, mean, and lazy According to Mr Pennell, his morals are no better than his looks Though in his own circle he is virtuous, he cultivates vicarious.

It was Marshal Bugeaud who said this On the whole the spirit of the book is as commendable as the execution, and it is curious to see how the authors native good sense and patriotism are for ever struggling with his prejudices and his priggishness Intheoeldl) named "PseudonymLibrar) ' (Fisher Unwin), which contains some good reading, there has been no better book than Gentleman Upcott's Daughter. As a study of Somersetshire life, it may take rank with almost the best of Mr Hardy's Dorsetshire sketches. The characters in the story are all of them in tng t) pes of Western folk with their language, their humour, and their strange commingling of the sentimental with the practical. Whoever the author may be, we cannot think that he or she can be a new hand at this business. But why should he elect to be pseudonymous' Told in the Verandah (Laurence and But len), purporting to be Passages in the Life of Colonel Bowlers, is a capital book of Indian stories, which we may praise without being suspected of a design to discover a new Kipling. Colonel Bowling is an Indian Munchausen, who tells his rodomontade and extravagant adventures with all the wit necessary to make them laughable. His lies here at least well invented, and made to be humorous. Moat lies are dull and tire home. And through all the lying, the truth of life and colour is well preserved, which is not always the case, even with the great writer who narrated the Tremendous Adventures of Major G alagan. Miss Jane Harrison has done good service by introducing to us a really good manual of classical mythology one which is correct in the double sense embodying all the most recent science as well as calculated to give no offence to the young person or her mother. The Gods of Olympus (Fisher Unwin) is translated into English from the well-known German work of Petiscus, by Katherine Raleigh, to which liberal additions have been made in the shape of illustrations and references, while passages from English poets have been substituted for the German quotations. Miss Harrison contributes a genial preface, pointing out the objects and excellences of the work, which, while specially intended for the elementary learner, " offers itself also to the more advanced student of classical art and literature, and humbly us a guide post to the intending specialist." For this purpose the book, which is well illustrated with portraits of the classic divinities taken from antique statues, is well fitted. The want of a good manual of Greek and Latin mythology, free from that element in which Lempriere revels, which has made the lives of the Greek gods but in- differently well adapted to the edification of youth, has long been manifest. The only fault we have to find with Miss Harrison's book is in respect of the over-straining at correctness in the etymology. We do not know that anything in gained by calling it "Olympos." It is true that the gods were Greek before they were Roman, but as there is every reason to suppose that they were not first nor exclusively Greek by origin, why should we ignore their latter and better known names, and talk of Zetvt, Heslin, and Poseidon? Nor is the book consistent to the rule it I preaches, for in the same breath in which the Cyclones are spoken of wethers Plato and Aristotle "the not Platoon and Amtoleles The Greek J'eus was, of course, not identical with the Koninn Jupiter, but surely it should be enough, in an elementary work, to indicate their differences without dropping altogether the i lore modem and familiar names Amidst a fresh batch of gift books for the coming season is In Greek.
