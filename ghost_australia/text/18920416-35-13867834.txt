i LEAF-LORE. In the days of our youth, when we went in a tasselled cap and nankeen pantaloons) with papa and mamma to see the Queen open the exhibition in Hyde Park, and when Pepper was terrifying the juvenile town with his ghosts at the Old Boy at Polytechnic before cheap prices and the popu- larisation of knowledge, the dry as dust science that was doled out to us a la Mr Barlow was always primly put, and often made curate One of the chief articles in the science credo of that period! classified ill bodies into three kingdoms animal, vegetable, and mineral and the aphorism of Luinncus, ' Stones grow, plants grow and live, animals grow, live, and feel," was considered a very neat and satisfactory summary Now we know that there are in reality only two kingdoms in Nature the 1 ving or organic, the arriving 01 inorganic-also that no such sharp distraction clubs drawn between plants and animals "Vast numbers of animals," says a scientist, are destitute of the power of locomotion, so that, for instance, corals were unhesitatingly referred to the vegetable kingdom until about a century ago, while dates, and many embryonic stage and fungi, which possess marked pow ers of locomotion, would thus require to be ranked as animas Nor is sensibility a purely animal characteristic, the well known sensitive plant, the sundew and Venus's fly-trap, exhibiting it in the most marked degree " Microscopic analysis has taught us that " the physical basis of life " is the nucleated first substance protoplasm, the laboratory of tissue into which streams of food matter and energy pass, becoming incorporated in the lix ing capital, by which work is done and from which waste is given off, the organism continuing throughout this balanced process relatively intact Huxley believes uU living forms to be fundamentally of one character and all motion to be the result of molecular changes, and it would seem that the distinction butw cou vegetable and animal protoplasm is that plants manufacture it from mineral compounds, whereas animals procure it ready made from plants, which are the accumulators of the power distributed and dispersed by animals Midway between plants and animals is what has been described as a "biological no-man's-land," inhabited by forms of life which, in their defiance of formal classification, have so stimulated investi- gation that we probably o we to them the discovery that vegetable shares with animal protoplasm the property of contractility Familiar as we are with the contraction character of the muscle of men and other animals, which we see moving freely about, it is travelling a x ory long way from Mr Barlow to realise that plants, which seem so helplessly rooted to one place, also have activities-breathing, growing, of reproduction, definite movements, sometimes even those of loco- motion executed by what may conveniently be termed vegetable muscle, which contracts under exciting stimuli, and further to realise that, if protoplasm is the structural unit of every living body, such a body being in its earliest state merely a multiple of such units, and in a more highly organised condition a multiple of such units x variously modified, that the physical basis of the life of a microscopic fungus is identical with that of a Huxley or a Darn in What then becomes of our three kingdoms ? It is somewhat diverting to look back on the comp as an manner in which man, swelling with proprietary pride, has ignorantly assumed that his follow tenants of the earth were created" to minister to his pleasure and convenience fruits for his delectation, bright flowers and plumage to please his lordly eye, song-birds for promenade concerts in his woodland, and soforth It has been the duty of evolutionary science to shatter this illusion to ridicule the usurpations of the poet, painter, and divine, and show that the humblest worm, the faintest trace of lichen on a rock has as definite a place and purpose in the great scheme as man himself In an introduction to the study of elementary physiology, Mrs Fou wick Mdler explains "bssuo"-tho word whose varied use is so puzzling to young students as the stuff of which an organ is made, and in the observation of any leaf we have not only an example of the development of cellular tissue, 01 protoplasm, but an opportunity of xv finishing, under the more scope, the inherent movement which is the basis of the organised motive lies of insectivorous and con- tain other plants Li ery part of a plant that is not stem is leaf - flowers are only dix crted leaves, in which the green colouring matter, di lorophyll, ia replaced by the more conspicuous pigments required for the attraction of fertilising insects-and leaf form modifies in correspondence with now functions necessitated by altered circumstances Thus, the leaves of ferns are highly compound, in order to catch all the broken sunbeams w here have not been intercepted by tailor plants, and to cast as little shadow as possible upon one another The leaves of aqua he plants, such as the water-lily, float largely expanded, so as to maintain their position, and absorb the maximum of light, while plants which grow in dry sandy regions become succulent, storing up water and protecting it from evaporation by a thickened skin Where the plant is a climber, the leaf, or part of it, may be modified into a tendon, in legumes into a pond, in insect devourers it may be converted into fly-trap, or " in the very highly specialised nopenthos we may have the base of the leaf of ordinary form and function, the middle training as a tendril, and the tip hollowed and enlarged into a complicated pitcher " No less interesting are the modifications required for protection, as when herbivorous mammals are warned off by the conversion of longings into thorns, by the pi Odin son of stinging has on the development of bitter or acid secretions, or when nuts have to be guarded against by a hairy or glandular epidermis In a section of plant tissue, the ncoiUo of a bottle, a joint of grass, or the blade of a leaf proper-under the lena may be watched the local circulation of the protoplasm, the movement and progression of the cells, or "fibre v Nothing bundles," which incessantly pursue a definite course The powerful current of this match uni circulation of plant life has been vividly pictured by Huxley who adds, "the wonderful noonday silence of a tropical forest is, after all, due only to the dulness of our hearing and could our ears catch the murmur of those tiny maelstroms, as they whirl in the innumerable myriads of living cells which constitute each tree, I we should be stunned as with the roar of a great city " The existence of this inherent force once comprehended wo cease to be surprised that in the struggle for survival plants should evolve special applications of contractile energy, of which some of the most striking examples yet remarked are the sensitive pi lot, whose familial shrinking is the effect of either light deprivation or contact, and which after Is so good an illustra- tion of the sleeping and waking of plants, the tenaciously turning stem of the hop , the ministers, the rancho of whose stigma close together upon irritation the barberry, whose stamens move in ward boasts dust the insect visitor with pollen the root stock trains tions of some glasses were found, the spreading rhe_:onieB of bulbous buds and those among the nearly 500 species of in- sectivorous plants which exhibit, in addition to sensitiveness and digestive power, distinct move mounts in helping to secure the mucous The common butterworth, which grows, slightly rooted, on marshy ground, attracts its prey, midges, by its beautiful violet colour and by a fungus ho odour Its leaves are covered with a copious, acid, acrid secretion, which acts as " inset t lime," and not only holds fast the victim, but helps to digest him Drops of rain or particles of gut fall unheeded on the loaf, but directly the smallest insect nights the fatal secretion flows, and the margins of the loaves slowly call inwards, imprisoning the booty, exposing it to more glands and moving it nearer the centre " After digesting the results and the surplus exudation are absorbed, leaving finally the undigested skin of the insect on the more or less dry leaf surface " The attractive little s ra- dow, whose red hairs glutton with moisture, is another carnivorous weed, which first bespeaks its victim, and then closed its hundred tentacles in upon him, looking like a closed fist If the prey be too big for one To if, as a dragon- fly would be, Several adjacent leaves climbing to capture him The sensitiveness of sundew hair is such that it will respond to a millionth of a grain of stimulat- ing nitrogenous matter, although a drop of rain or any irrit mt particle merely produces increased secretion But Venus's fly-trap called by Lin areas the miracle of Nature, exhibits a still more elaborately planned snare, and is the climax of the order Drosoracoio to which the shadow belongs Its loaf, about 4 m in length, and divided into two halves by the middle, possesses a power resembling that of an automatic closing spring Round the outer margin of each half are from 12 to 20 long tooth and when the hall was close upward and inward from the midrib, the teeth interlock in rat-trap fashion Down the centre of the leaf are a number of rose-coloured digestive glands, and on each half of the Made -uses highly sensitive hain, pro j co ting obliquely, which bend flat on a basal-joint when a leaf closes When one of these hairs is excited by contact with an insect, the blade shuts up in about 10 seconds, and if the prey is enclosed the glands secrete profusely Digestion goes on for a length of time determined by the size of the booty, pest is a week or a fortnight and not until it is completed does the leaf re open In this process, so much more divided and complex than in the sundew, tho tÂ» eth the hairs, and the glands have separate functions, the muscular notion is rapid and definite, and Burdon Sanderson claims to have detected electric currents similar to those observed in the House muscular nerve ity of animals, a new point of departure in I rt v min r at a line from which we may look for remarkable developments in the future.
