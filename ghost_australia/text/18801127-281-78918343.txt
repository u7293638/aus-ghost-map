I Laycock oh Biaokman. The following extract from a letter by E. Laycock to a friend in Sydney will bo road with interest. Tho letter was datod London,- October. 7 :--" Your papers considerably underrate Blaokman. , He is as tall ns myself, 26 years of. ago, and neighs over 12 stono; and ns to his pace from Putnoy to Hammersmith Bridge, dno and three-quarter mile, wo did tho fastest time on record in any raceâ€”nine minutes and. four seconds; ?nd he was thon only a length astom. My 7 first.attempt on the Thames has been a win. As I told you before, Trickott and myself do all our. work, nnd get on well togother. Ho piloted mo through the race in'a cutter. The day was very wet nnd windy, and in about two miles I rowed Blackman to a standstill; I have two more races on, and fancy I can win both. 'I have seen Hanlan out often; in. fact, have rowed over tho course alongside ,of him". I see very little in him, and can only con clude that he will not have tho ghost of a ohanco with Trickett; so, bar acci dents, he is not in it. His bump of selfre?teem is exceedingly well-deve loped. ' He rows open-banded, so I need tell yon no more. I expect we'shall have more races on before long. So far we havo had fine weather. vWe are going to row first and second for the Hop Bittors, if it comes off." > 7 I
