Hard Times in New Zealand. The following is an extract from an amusing lettar written by a gentleman well known on the Gecloug Press to a resident of this town, dated New Zealand. 22nd May: — " I promised when I left GeeloBE that when I had an opportunity I should writ': to M you, and that promise it is now my intention to keep. Kince my ||j arrival at Port Chalmers my career has Eg been a somewhat chequered one ; dull, <Us- Eg mal clouds lowerings, but I suppose the bril- l|| liaut sunshine lurks behind, Dunediu, the E| commercial metropolis of New Zealand, Eg proved a disappointment ; its press belonged H to a charmed circle ; it was the exclusive p property of a Press Clnb, and there was no ||| opening, not the ghost of a loop-hole, for a B Victoria.: interloper like me. I; sought H other employment — behind the conhter and HI the bar — but was doomed to disappointment. K One of the reliable (?) orgaus - of- public 6| opinion trumptcted forth tbe praises of a ij| labor agent, and declared there was lots of K: woik ror tnose wno wouta - auaps sr. themselves to circumstances. I. paid my F;j fee, and hung about the stops of tbo agent's office until my. toes were cramped aud my patience exhausted. ' A few j|| days before Xmas, with half-a- crown— fa the remains of my ample fortune — I started l|j on tho wallaby track. I deposited my tnc- j|| morablc black bell-topper under & manuka tree, abandoned my paper collar, and dressed M myself as a new chum. For about a week I || encountered the most delighiful privations imaginable 1 Travelling on scant fare, aud || roosling at night where I could find shelter, | At the end of that period — one of the hap- j|j piest in my life — I found myself over a hun- S| drcd mile3 on my way, at a place called jM Paprika1:, with a skinned nose and" blistered || toes, nnd my elastic-sides worn to the ji verge of desperation. The Provincial |i Government of Ocago were at this place S engaged rectifying the absurdities of S- a tramway made some months pre- g; viously by a pet contractor nnd passed as $' perfect by the obsequious officers of the de- |i. partment, I 'applied for employment and two days afterwards commenced a brief || career with pick nnd shovel on tho Awmuoka railway, To tell you all my experiences in |9 my new capacity would be a long, eveu if jm interesting, tale. You will probably conceive m Borne of my pleasures, how I manufactured W " pnlm " oil and patent blisters. I boarded | at an hotel nnd slept in the "dead-house," M a place fitted np with, bunks, a just na on board of a steamer. B For some timo I havo been engaged with a j survey party, and I am just beginning to get on my legs, and save a little money. I never was in better health or .condition ; but, as usual, I am not at all contented, I f have lots of exercise, travelling on tbe f average twenty miles daily over rough | ground and hilly country. There are three g of us and a cook. Wc live well, and have g lots of fresh air I By.and-bye I suppose I p shall be a Jack.of-all-trados. Same of these | odd days I will write yon more fully, and g will give you n better account ef this highly | taxed and much indobted country,"— Gaolong | Advertiser. |
