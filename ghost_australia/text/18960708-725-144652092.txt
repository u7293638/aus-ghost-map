' ; NOYJfiL.'-.:' A Bachelor's Bridal ' By Mrs. H. Lovett Cameron. CHAPTER IV.— (Continued.) Bryant had never spoken quite bo seriously about it before, and when he patted 'with the. Challengers next morning at Charing Gross, Marion vent _off on -her journey -with the most untroubled serenity of mind on his ac count. No dreadfnl strange, wife/ whom she could regard only as an, interloper, would, she felt assured, come between herself and ber friend daring her absence. The earnest words oe had eaid on the subject last night hadoompletely lolled her anxieties to rest. -Her only regret was at leaving liim for so long, bereft of her- society, and of her good dinners Ttfaat he would miss so dreadfully, fihei thought, with a sigh. _ ; - . * You ought to have come with up, ! old *nnn V said Tom, as lie wrung Bryant's hand in farewell before jumping into the railway carriage. 1 How on earth am i to manage the Prinoess without your assistance, I should like to knowP You really are an ass not toiiLye ohacked up your work,. and oome too.*' It was not very long before Valentine wished that lie -had doneeofrom the Tery. bottomof hisrheart. ;; .

Behind this delightful room, curtained -off by a heavy portiere from the rest of the prem ises, were Valentine's bedroom and bath room, so that the portion of bis residence in whioh he lived waa divided completely from the boeiness department in whioh hia clerks worked, but *here was a passage of communi cation between the two. It may be added that there was a Beparatedoorfromabaokatalrcaee of the house, giving access to the larger offioe, so that no noise of the arrival or departure of his employees could penetrate to the solicitor's ears or disturb bui when he waefet 'work. Peiera: only, came and went by thb door he tised himself. ; ? '' ' 'v It has been necessary to give a somewhat detailed description of fllr. Bryant's Cham bers iu order that the events tiiat happened onacertun evening, now about to be re lated, may be folly understood. Valentine had -been dining at the Oxford and Cambridge Club witb a small p^rty of. ?friends. It happened to 'be one of tbMa wet nights to whlon the variable climate of England ifl pronQj and on whidi the getting home after-dinner with a dry skin is a matter of -serious difficulty. The rain es he^left Pall Stall descended in torrents, and he bad' great trouble in getting a cab at all. There were; indeed, scarcely any to be seen in the streets, even in tlie vioinity of tKb clubs, and none at all io the neighborhood of Lincoln's Inn. When he dismissed his hansom at bis own door, be had to ' give the man an extra shilling, ior, as hegrnmblioglf ^aid, it wa? j^tynfeht for a 4og Jo bevnt'in; ; \ tte ^bt^ve^Jwiet evoi ^rttrinlag across 4he pavement into the Shelter the open door way, and a long stream of drippings from bis overooat marked bis track up the draughty stone staircase to the landing :of bis own ohambera. - ' - ^ It was bariey half -past eleven, for Bryant, ttirdfoi of his next day's work, never eared to sit up late'; be came'briskly up the stair oase, thankful to.be 'borne, out of 'the in clemenoy of the weather, and throat bis latch -key infco^the 'door. As he did ao, however, the dote was opened simultaneou&y; from within, and be found that Peters was ^sittiogupforhiui/ . Now, Peters did not sleep on the premises; be usually went away to his borne .after bis inaster had gone out to his dinner, as soon as ! be bad made the rooms tidy; for he combined : as has been ^kid,^the offioe of valek 'an3 ' servant with his other vooations. * Halloo, Peters ! here still P' cried Bryant, in some surprise, and then, seeing a queer look of trouble and mystery 4n the old man's faoe, he added, qoioKly . * Has anything gone wrongP ' ' Well, sir,' and Peters closed die door softly behind Mm, and lowered. his voice al most to a whisper, 1 1 'thought perhaps I had better wait -up and tell you mvflall, in case it should be an unpleasant ahock for .you—-* \- 4 Why, wbat the devil is the matter ?* -'Well, sir, I am sure £ hope you won't blame me—but lb ere is a lady waiting to see you* ! ' CHAPTER V. I * A lady!' repeated' Bryant.inthe blankest I dismay, 1 at this bour of night ! Good God, I Peters, why did you let her inf Wby | didn't yoa say that I can't attend to business at night P' r I did say bo, sir, over aud over again, but it made .no sort of difference to her ; she said ber business was most important, and that she must 'wait till you caine in. . I begged of htor to call again to- morrow,butfihe wouldn't bo mucli as listen to mej ahe aaid you would not ininfl ber stopping, and that she didn't care bow long she waited, so long as she Baw you. She, £aa been -hera ever since nine o'clock,1* added Petere, almost piteously . : I ^ryint Was diF^Bta^ bii^elf of bis ^jjiat overooat. ^ He was very much annoyed with Peten for allowing any oUent, Tnore espec ially a woman, jfco go into bis rooms at mght, and-he froxmed heavily, whilst theoorners of bis lips assumed a certain stern deflection witb«ficbPetcrfi was familiar. . 'You are oerfcainly very Tiauob, to 4-lame/ ha said, w-th displeasure, * and I trust you will never lot auob a thing happen again on any pretext whatever. However^ dare eay it is only -my aunt, Mrs. Conway.' Peters was the soul- of discretion, but at these words he put up hia hand to his 4ace, and the ghost of a smile which he respect fully endeavored to 'conceal flitted aoross bis ^Iraau'featoeeB.- * ? 1 X don't itink it is your aunt, sir,* he said, 'dryly.:-!- . \- Va^entane.was In no hurry to encounter the unknown invader.
