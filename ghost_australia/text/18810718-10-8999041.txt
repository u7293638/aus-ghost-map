THE REV, MR. GEISS AND MR. CLARKE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY. Sir,-I have waited perhaps too long to see if any one would pen a few lines about the subject which has lately been before the public, regarding the grand old Church of England. I allude to a sermon preached by the Church of England minister, and commented upon by Mr. Clarke. Mr. Geiss' letter was a disappointment, at least to me, as I should have liked to have soon the rev. gentleman state boldly whether the Church of England taught that her ministers could forgive sins, or could not. In the Book of Common Prayer, in the service of the ordering of priests, the Bishop lays his hands on the head of the receiver, and Buys a Re- ceive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a priest in the Church of God, now committed unto thee by the imposition of our hands. Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven and whose sins thou dost retain, they are retained." Will some of our clergy state what this means, as anything in connection with that Church, which is endeared to so many hearts, should not remain obscure Yours, etc, July 16. POLEMICS.
