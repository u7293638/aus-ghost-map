BAPTEF CHURCH MEMBERSHIP QUESTION. To the Editor. Sir,— '-'Close Baptist' painfully misre presents the import of a verse of Scrip tare in his letter appearing in your is sue of tKe 8th inst., and for his enlight enment I subjoin a few words from one of Guthrie's sermons, for which I trust you will kindly grant space: — ' . . . . 'Except a. man. be born of water and the Spirit he cannot see the king dom, of God : According to the common understanding of the words, they, refer only to the renewing of the Holy Spirit. It is generally thought that . the water tier* is but an emblem of the Spirit, and that our Lard just meant to say : ^Except a raan's sou! is purified by the Spirifs regeoarating iiuluence as his body is by water he o&naot; be a recipient of grace and an i«ir of heaven.' We venture to think that on this occasion our Lord preached the Gospel more fully. ... If tie -water! in his address meant only the Hoty Spirit, he told the truth, but not the* whole troth. Are not more than regenerating influences needed that a man may enter the kingdom of heaven! For that end, is not the blood of the Saviour as necessary as the renewing of the Holy Ghost? Now, let our Lord, in addressing Nioodemus — -who, as a Jew, would at once catch the allusion — have an eye to the clean water of the cere monial law; letthewaterthere refer like this to an atoning sacrifice, and from that celebrated passage the Gospel Our Lord tells this ruler what I preach, and pray you to ponder on, that, ex cept you are -washed in His blood, as well as renewed by His Spirit, you can not see the kingdom of God. . . . I, not my ordinances, nor baptism, nor the supper, nor preaching, nor prayer ; not these, but I, says Jesus, am the Way.' — Yours, etc, ? PEDOBAPTD5T. Perth, September 10. ,
