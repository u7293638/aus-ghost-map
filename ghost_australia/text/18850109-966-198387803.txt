That life was restored but for afew months, but long enough fcr me to dispossess the Bartons of their fictitious rights, and to bring Simon's granddaughter to nurse him. 1 Best of all, when the old rfnner discovered bow nearly he had been given over to one of flie moat horrible forms of death, and when he was freed fiom the thraldom which his servants had exercised over him, he manifested a late repentance. He had not known that his daughter had been married to ~ jphen Blair, and had allowed Cqptain wart to persuade him into the hatching of > of the vilest of plots withtheidea of scaring faer into breaking her engagement. His subsequent angry demeanour, as he wanted as to think, was partly caused by fals sorrow at Mysie's sudden death. And after ' his first Tenement declaration that he woold never Own the infant, his pride had forbidden him to remedy his mistake.
