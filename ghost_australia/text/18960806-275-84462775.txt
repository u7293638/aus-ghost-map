A GHOST ? IN HOBARTi PAELIAMENTAEY EEFEE ENCE TO THE VISITOR For the first time on record a ghost has got mentioned in Parlia ment. We have heard in that place many tales of a ghost of an argument, of a ghost of a surplus, and even of a mere ghost of prin ciple,' but now we have a real live ghost — if ghosts are alive — and the Ministry has been asked what it means to do about him, or her, or it, as the case may be. There seems to be no doubt as to the fact that some ruffian goes about the city waving his arms at girls and women, for he carefully avoids men, and that he has caused several cases of nervous shock. He does not appear to be very terrible in appearance, but he frightens the women, and ought to be put down. But the member who moved in the matter got no satisfaction from the Ministry, for he was merely told that the Hobart police were under the control of the city council, and there is an end of the matter. Cer tainly, the police ought to take active measures to put a stop to the pranks played, as they are unplea sant to say the least, but, then, no one can say where to have himk in which respect he is the reverse of Mrs. Quickly. Hobart is rather a ghostly place. There are houses said to be haunted on absolutely no evidence at all, and there is a readi ness to believe in tales of ghosts, beyond what is generally found in the other colonies.
