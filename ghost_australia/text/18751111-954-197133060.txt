: HAPPINESS. Take an illustration from Sir Thomas More, in prison in the Tower before his death. To his daughter, who visited him there, he said — 'You fancy these four walls lonesome; how oft, dost thou suppose, I here receive Plato and Socrates, and this and that holy saint and martyr 1 My gaolers can no more keep them out than they can exclude the sunbeams. Thou knowest Jesus stood amongst His disciples when the doors were shut. I have a divine light even here, whereby to con the lesson ' God is love.' The futility of our enemies' efforts to make us miserable was never more strongly proved to me than when I was a mere boy in Cardinal Morton's service. Having unwittingly angered one of his chaplains, a choleric and even a malignant -spirited man, he did of his own authority shut me up for some hours in a certain damp vault, which, to a lad afeard of ghosts and devilish apparitions, would have been fearsome enough. Howbeit, I there cast myself on the ground, with my back set against the wall and mine arm behind my head — this fashion — and. did then and there, by reason of a young heart, quiet conscience, and quick fancy, conjure up such a lively picture of the Queen o' the Fairies' Court and all the sayings and doings therein, that never was I more sorry than when my gaoler let me go free, and bade me rise up and be doing. In place, therefore, my daughter, of thinking of me in thy night-watches as beating my wings against my cage bars, trust that God comes to look in upon me without knocking or bell-ringing. Keep dry eyes and a hopeful heart, and reflect that nought but unpardoned sin shotdd make tis weep for ever.'.
