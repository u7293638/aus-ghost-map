Hocal $ General fietoa. IN our notice of the Amateur Dramatic performance yesterday, we omitted when mentioning the names of those ffhose acting pleased us, to give the credit (certainly due) to Mr. S. Solomon junr., for his very able rendering of Nicodemus, the dolorousgentlcman who is mistaken by the other characters for the ghost. Mr. Solomon's acting of this part, was quite equal to anything we have seen him do. These performances were repeated again last evening, and we think went even better than on the farmer occasion. WE hear that another cricket match between Perth and Fremantle is on the tapis, and will probably take place, if the Fremantle eleven are agreeable, on or about the 17th proximo. The Perth - ites are evidently not satisfied with the result of the last contest, and therefore wish to regain their lost laurels. They intend mustering a Btrong eleven, and mean winning if they can. Could not something be arranged about having a lunch on the ground^for the two elevens? it would be so much more sociable and agreeable. We think the Fremantleites ought to take the initiative as these matches always takes place on their own ground, and the Pertbites have hitherto always been to considerable expense in coming to Fremantle to play.
