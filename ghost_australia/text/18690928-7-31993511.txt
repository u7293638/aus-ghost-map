"WITH JUST ENOUGH OF LEARNING. TO MISQUOTE." To Southey's Ghost in Handes, per Express and Telegraph. De-rOid Coii—You __>ouM try to exchange newspapers with some other gfao-*ts down below, and then you would see frou. the " Haas-id ** report in last Wednesday's Register that I did not quote the vene in question as from the "Devil <m Two Sticks," bat from Pom's ? Devil's Walk;" and yon reslly mnstnot scold me for the mistakes of iqwitm or printers. I know there is a. friendly dispute nun Pcxmb Mid Coleridge nad yea aa to which of yon U the author of the line*, and if yon win kindly show this note to the other two ghosts, you on settle it among yourselves; bit my private opinion ia that yon and Coleridge both cribbed the idea, from Ponon originally. I fear tbe ? excessive heat" of Hadesbas had "an injurious effect upon yoor brains" and memory, or yon would not have forgotten that the second line of the vene is printed among yoor own poems as " A cottage of gen tility.''and not "Anemblem of gentility." ao that it is unfortunate that yam •houM say that the lint expression is " utterly ntfamnglfw, and I do not think your taste can hare improved since you left us. I am aorry that I did not give the thitd line as I believe it ought to be. "And the devil did grin, for his darling sin," &c;, as it might have pleased the Treason? better, but we dont "go in" for poetry in the House of Assembly. Toms fraternally, LAVTNGTON GLYDE. Saturday. P.S.—By the way. Bob, you head your note "With just sufficient learning to misquote;" asd that is smother proof of the effect of the heat down below, for the proper quotation from Byron is—" With just enough of learning to misquote." And really. Bob, yon know those who live in glass houses should not throw stones, especially when their own panes are ao vary large.
