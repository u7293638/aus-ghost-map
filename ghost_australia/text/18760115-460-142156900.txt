Wehave seen .to what a degree of beajity of form and colour he has brought his fountain, and- he now Bhows us what he can do with moving water m other shapes. Nor ip it in any sense an illusion, for a large body of water falls from a height over rocks (painted, it is true), and produces* rattle and a roar which are very suggestive of a real cataract, i The lime-light oolours thrown upon i it, of ; necessity, add to its picturesque effect, and as the fountain is allowed to play in a Bu^jdued manner at the same time, the pictur^ alto, > gether is a very impressive one. Now that the weather has begun to be of a genuinely I summer kind, a visit to St. George's-hkll, of an evening, ought to be agreeably cooling after a perspiring day1. The Fakir has also added to his ghost-illusion, in the shape of | an episode representing a miser gloating over bis gains, and seeing the ghosts of ' those whom his avarice has killed. One of the ghosts sings. Now, I do not object to singing ghoflta, but I think if they sing at all, they should ring well, and tins ghost sings other than well, and so spoils that very effective eong, " Pray for those at cea" one of those dramatictUy-ooloured oompoai-1 tions, of which a great deal may be made by proper vocal treatment, but winch ill,vocal treatment ruins. It is true that I have had no means of knowing vhow disembodied beings acquit themselves when they are en. trueted with the execution of vocal per* formances, but, according to such authoritiej as I have been aide to consult, they sing with discernment. So l should be glad if tbiB representative of a spirit, like Caleb piummer's barking-dogs, could come as near to nature as die can for the money. The Apollo-hall is again to be tenanted with a minstrel company. As it includes Mr. La Feuillade, Mr. Buckley, and otherf well and favourably known, it is likely the com p&ny; will have a long tenancy. Messrs. Burton and Taylor's circus pained thiougb Melbourne on Tuesday. Thqy had come southward, and were en route to <Gipp3 Land, but hearing that the flood waters were a good deal out In that region, they decided to spend a week in the Buburbp, and commenced on Tuesday night at Prabran. They have now an excellent company, |whi6h is being continually supplemented by fresh additions. Their next move will be weet waid, overland to Adelaide. 1 M. and Madame Simonsen have arrived, and aTe, I believe, organising an' opera bouffe company, who will probably Com mence their performances in Melbourne, and thenmake a long Australian iota. j I hear it is eomething more than probable that a new theatre is shortly to be built in Melbourne. The pame of a gentleman 'well ( known both in commercial and the^rical' circles has been mentioned to me; as a principal in the project, land his connexion is a guarantee for its proper condacL, ; i A communication from jGipps Land, informs me that the little company, consisting of Mr. andMrs. CofctereUaud Mr. Yal Vose, have visi^aUthe" possible plaoes" in that neighbourhood, including the " abnoet impossible Walhalla.f' and have been kindly wd profitably redeived. They are ebeiat returning to Melboucne, to make arrangements for a north-western journey. j Jflrom Queensland I have receiye4 * copy " Prfnoe Darling orthe FairySnowdrop, wdthePagewhptrufpe40vera,N?*T I*af. .a original fairy.
