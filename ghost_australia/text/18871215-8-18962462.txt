POETRY. A SONG OF TUB SUNSET LAND. j Ia the far-off lilli« oribe sunset land ; Io the land where the Ion/; «au benda and qnlvers. Where the ghoMs ol night and morning stand By the gleam? and dreams of the lonely rivers, "Where the brown sedge waving, stoops aad shivera At the water's edge in the aunaet land. Through the trackless parts ot the Binnet land; Where the altino» brooda In a dream unbrokea. And the day« clip by like grains of sand. Where the nong unsung and the word unspoken, Seem like a part ol a uamelers token Of the wild gray wastea of the sunset land. On the snow-oUd peaka 0/ the sunset land ; As they rite In the dodds so mar to heaven In shadowy vastni-m1. strm and grand; Whi re gaunt old pine«, by the lightning rives, Moan in the wind, through their branche, driven, On the crags and cliffs ol tbe sunset land. 'Mid the rolling plains ol the sunset land, Wlitre the eoboes drift on the tufted heather In the wake of breezes sweet and bland ; Where the shadows go In a troop together J Aoross the haze of the fair June weather In the grassy dells of the sunset land. By the wand'ring «reams of the Bunset land. Where the ripi-lee rise 'm'd the tall reeds bending And float away to an unknown strand ; Aud the shade and the nunlight slow detoending Falls where the voice of the waters blendiog Sings of the sunset land
