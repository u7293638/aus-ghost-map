POETRY. TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYBODY. One rendor cries your strain s too grave, Too much morality you have, Too much about religion ; Givo me some witch and wizard talcs. Of Blip-shod ghosts with fius and scales, And feathers like a pigeon. . I love to read, another cries, Thoso monstrous fashiouablo lies — lu other words thoso novols, Composed of kings, and priosts, and lords, Of border wars, and Gothic hordes, That used to live in hovels. No, no, cries one, we've had enough Of such unpleasant love-sick stuff, To craze the fair creation ; Givo us somo recent foreign news, Of Russians, Turks, tho Poles, or Jews, Or aiiy othor nation. , Tho man of dull scholastic lore Would liko to sco a little moro Of first-rato scraps of Latin ; Tho grocer fain would learn the price Of lea and sugar, fruit and vice ; The draper silk and satin. Another cries, I want more fun, A witty anecdote or pun, A rebus or a riddle ; Somo wish for parliamentary nows, And some, perhaps, of wiser views, Would rather hear a fiddle. The critio, too, of classic skill, Must dip in gall his gander quill, And scrawl against tho paper ; Of ull the literary fools Bred in our colleges and schools, lie cuts tho greatest caper. Another cries, I want to see A jumbled up variety, Variety in all things — A miscellaneous hodge-podge priut, Composed (I only givo tho hint) Uf multifarious small things. I want some marriage nows, snys miss, It constitutes the highest bliss To hear of weddings plenty ; . For in a lime of gonornl rain, Nono suffer from a drought, 'tis plain, At least not one in twenty. Some signify a secret wish For now and then a favourite dish Of politics to suit them ; . But hero wo rost at perfect oaso, .For Bhould they swear the moon was chcose, Wo never should confute them. Or grave or humorous, wild or tamo, Lofty or low, 'tis all the same, Too haughty or too humblo; So, brother editors pursue The path that seems the best to you,. And lot the grumblers grumble.
