De Foe's genius and audacity devised a plan which, for assurance and ingenuity, defied | evtn the powers of Mr. Puffin, the critic*! for who but himself would have thought of summoning up a ghost from the grave to bear witness in favour of a halting body of divinity ? There is a matter-of-fact, buai ne*6-like style in the whole account* of the transaction whicli bef*»e#ke ineffable powers of eolf^poteefctiion. The apparition of Mrs. Vreal is represented as appearing to a Mrs. Uargravo, her intimate friend, as she Bat in her own house in deep contemplation of certain distresses oL her own. After the ghostly visitor Uad announced herself as prepared for a distant journey, her friend and she began to talk in the bomelr style of middle*aged ladies. Her very recent ex perience probably led Mrs* Veal to talk of death and the book* written on the sob' I jectt, and she pronounced es cathedra, as I a dead person was best entitled to do, that i " Urelincoart'g book on death was the best) I book on the subject ever written." Brelin* court, she said, bad the clearest notions ot de<tth, and the future state of any who had handled that subject. She then asked for the work, and lectured on it. with great eloquence and affection. l)r. Ke&rick;'s " Ascetick " was also mentioned with ap probation by this critical spectre. The effect was* most wonderful. Drelin court upon Death, attested by one who could speak from experience, book an tin equalled run. The copies had hung on the bookeellerV hand? a» heavy m a pile of bullets. They now traversed the tono in every direction, like the fame balls dis charged from a tield-piece. In short, the object of Mrs. Veal's apparition was per fectly attained.
