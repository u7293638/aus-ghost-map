poetry The Sin of Omission. It isn't the tliir.g you do, dear, It's lh . thing you leave undone, Wiiicli gives you a hit of heartache At (.lie setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, Tho lettrr you did not write, Tlx; flower you might have sent, dear, Aicyour haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of lieartsouic counsel You were harried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, X'he gentle and winsome tone That 301 had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily -tut of mind, These chances to he angels, Which even mortals find They come in night and silence, Each chill, reproachfal wraith, Who) hope is faint and flagging _ And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late; And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone. Which gives you the bitter licartaclie, At the setting of the sun. -MARGARET E. SAXÂ«STEE.
