The most accurate accounts from the wreck give K> persons as the number who were on board at the time of the disaster, 38 of whom were saved The last man to leave the wreck alive was a man named Burke Captain Mann did everything that could be done to save the vessel after she struck. The chief officer and) she steered the proper course, and the vessel was lost owing to there being an in sufficient depth of water on the bar. The president of the Marine Board has ordered an inquiry into the loss of the steamer to take place e as soon as possible in L'Estrange the Australian Blondín, made an attempt to cross a portion of the Middle Harbour with 1 Ino era on a tight rope, but he had much dilatory in balancing himself on the bicycle, and had scarcely gone a hundred feet when he fell into the water L'Estrange fell clear of the bicycle, and was promptly rescued by some boats without having sustained any injury, SOUTH AUSTRALIA Returns have been prepared showing the progress of the colony.

The chairman, in proposing the adoption of the report and balance sheet, said they were highly satisfactory A glance at the balance sheets of this year and last would show that 3 '123 proposals for £879, 825 were received by the society this year, as against 2,070 pro locale for £431,077 last year. This year 490 proposals were declined, as against 500 last year. The number of policies issued this year was 2 808 for £600 250, as against 1 361 for £282107 last year. The interest realised this year was £8 230 8s 5d , while last year it was £6,90 6s 4d. It was most gratifying to know that all the claims which had arisen during the past year had been paid out of the interest which had accrued, the claims being only £5 450, and the interest £8,230 8s 5d The accumulated funds now amounted to £128 312 17s 4d and had been increased during the past year by 2"5,000 1 he figures generally showed that the Society was very prosperous, and the directors were anxious if it were possible, to make it even more so A branch had been opened in Tasmania during the past few weeks, from which a good business was expected.
