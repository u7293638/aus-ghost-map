The Charge against the Rev. John Osborne. THE "special district meeting" to inquire into charges against the Rev. J. Osborne of teaching erroneous doctrine, concluded yesterday afternoon. A sub- committee having been appointed in the morning to prepare a "finding," after a short absence submitted one for the approval of the meeting. It was debated at great length, and ultimately the meeting agreed to the following :— Resolutions of special district meeting, July 20, 1883—"After a long and careful consideration of certain complaints affecting the Rev. John Osborne's ministerial conduct, and his fidelity to the Methodist doctrine, it is agreed, (1.) That after hearing Mr. Osborne's frank declaration of his belief in the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His atonement for sin by His death, in the Deity of the Holy Ghost, in the plenary inspiration of the Holy Scripture, and in the efficacy of prayer ; having heard also his declaration of sincere attachment to Methodist doctrines generally as embodied in our acknowledged standard, we cor- dially accept his statements as full and satisfactory ; at the same time we regret that his method of pre- senting these truths is at times so inexact as to produce the impression on the minds of some that he is erroneous in doctrine. (2.) In reference to the sermon delivered in the York-street church on Sunday evening, April 26, 1883, on Roman Catholicism, we are convinced that Mr. Osborne is sound in the doctrines of Protestantism as held by the Methodist Church ; yet, by the evidence we are satisfied that, in the formal part of his discourse he was so unguarded in his statements as to appear to advance doctrines not in harmony with our standards. (3.) That the president communicate the foregoing resolutions to Mr. Osborne."— "D. Telegragh."
