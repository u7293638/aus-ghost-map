i I THE PAST RACING SEASON IN I NEW SOUTH WALES. B [ar KANGAROO.] I THE season of 1847 has draw a to a close, I and must be looked upon as one of the I most brilliant the colony has ever wit I nessed, both as regards the number of I meetings, the value of the prizes, and the i -character of the running. Not a single I «rasure has been made in the calendar of I the previous year, whilst the list has been I signally augmented by the meeting es tab I lished under the auspices of the Cumber I land Turf Club. Parramatta brought to I gether some of the best horses in the I country, and excellent sport was the re I suit. But I question whether the Stewards i will net this year find it more advanta ; geous to arrange matters earlier, as even ) the mild winter of Australia becomes 1 ever and anon unsuited to racing purposes, j a statement fully borne out by the wet, ; bleak, and uncomfortable weather expe \ rienced in the month of July last. Of } the principal nags, old Jorrocks has main : tained his pre-eminence, and for aught I [i see, will continue to hold it, in opposition to the never-ending halloo which has echoed and re-echoed, far and wide, for the * last four years, u he can't last much-lon- ger." Pshaw-what have we to meet him in '48--unless provided for by those who cut otj^»%,v'arious programmés,'he'will, as 4mM|^|?j>>aweep Plate, and" Cup,''and 'IÇ^pl^itTipùt. let or hindrance, into the .1^ij|^'o£ his.owner^-but with thaÇsubject I^^ll^ot fâitherj at present, intérfèrç. mWHA.iÉBdSStósr j)roved himself-àa^oodj, agí expectepijÉg^K^e is a Sunday horse> : aadKev.ry-^)|!yf,wS$ is consequea^f(qn sotted to P^^tawèr^de his second^ d^äy p^ormançA^w^^^enrith' a&^0*äjraf mjitta; ^||Bthj¿J fought to^yé^vbn his race,^^ahe'T^a^r place againifctJor rocks, but^Giftts, Ms sjdekey, was ill, and wlïçn the old*<horsl ¿foliengeti, fell quite abroad. Thejfed ' i^i|^reat favourite of i minf, and his merit, as far as concerns my ! predilection, centres solely in his capa- bilities'in the saödle. CASSANPRA has, I find from the table ^blished in the last issue of this journa^wj^ "eight times ; but,.had she been iniproperiands as far as appertains vto training; a^d'had she further been piloted.by an adepiin the art, how different would Jiave been^'fjae, stim ing up of the year's account. Through- out the whole season she never had a chance of showing herself in, .her, ,real character. I have watched her through most of her work, and reflection but. strengthens the opinion already expressed as to the wretched condition in which she has invariably been brought to the post ; had it been otherwise, she would have proved herself the best mare out. Little need be said of BLUE BONNET her last DEAD-heat having been run-she heat JORROCKS at Homebush, as some think, through the bad judgment of his rider. 1 saw her beat him at Maitland, a year or two ago, in a race of two-mile heats-'thc mare took the lead in both heats, was never headed, and won easy. The horses were both in good fettle, Mars- den on the mare, and Mickey Brian on the gelding. : . She could always beat him in one event, if she was right, but that I admit was seldom, owing to the difBculty of bringing her out well. Few, perhaps, will agree with me in yielding superiority of pace to the mare ; but from well-established conviction, I shall ever place her. before him in point of speed. -FOIG-A- BALLAGH has, by his per- formances, astonished many.- pity that his owner should be so blind to his own interests,, as to persist in misplacing him. Every meeting has one or more races adapted to his powers. Why not be satisfied with half a loaf, instead of vainly struggling with the baker for hisother customers bread. -TALLY Ho ! it is rumoured is queer ;-a game little horse, but has not foot enough to rise above mediocrity..--PLOVER, the test weight carrier of the day, often shows in the front rank, and is likely to run on in the same style, because weight does not hurt him.: I regret that the present ar- rangements of his stable will' not allow of his contesting the palm with the old horsed--DONNIZETTE is lame; and no one .can feel surprised at it : his own weight is sufficient at'any time to , break him down, so loaded is he about his fore hand.' -Every genuine lover of the turf must regret the fate of Mr. Wilshire's EVA. I sincerely, trust this gentleman's lot will he more fortunate during the campaign of '48, as he is one of the few on the local turf whose views are directed less to profit than amusement. The prospects of the ensuing season are cheering in the extreme. The Bathurst and-Windsor districts are already on the QUI - VIVE, and money is plentiful ; but something must be done to induce breeders to bring out their young stock. Our aged horses, too,-must he put more on equality; and as Cassandra is gone into the stud, and Blue Bonnet dead, the only thing to go against Jorrocks with the ghost of a chance, is Whalebone ; but next week I will en- deavour to show the readers of BELL'S LIFE how to remedy these existing evils.
