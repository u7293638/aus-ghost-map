MISS 3LINXE3 SCORED. , " That Blinker girl is hateful," said the girl with the sunburnt nose. "She is,"aisented the girl in the Alpine hat; " but how" "How did I find it out?" said the girl with the sunburnt nose. "Well, the way I came to grief with : her was this:—Wedecided to give J"host partv at our last birthday kicicup." "Some Some olc old sheet-and-pillow-case aifair, I suppose?" "Nothing of the kind. You all sit in dark room and . tell ghost stories in turn. The person who tells the most blood-curdiing one gets the prize. Of course, ths incidents are all supposed to have happened to you personally." " Os course, T wanied to create a good impression. especially as Harry was there that week, and that Blinker girl was fairly haunting his footsteps. Somehow, I couldn't manage to think or even dream of a good one, though I ate a supner of Welsh rarebit on purpose. Finally, the very day of the party, I went to see my laundress about my dress— we were all to wear white, you know. To my joy, I found on her mantelpieces an old, dog-eared book of ghost stories. I borrowed it at once and took it home in triumph." •' Well, you were in luck." "I thought so then. Well, that evening I told one of the stories—of course, making myself the heroine. " It was a creat success, and I felt that the prize was mine, when that Blinker girl stopped talking to Harry, and began to applaud. "Then she said— 'Oh, how delightful. And did it really happen to yon?" "Of course it did," I said. "' How perfectly charming,' she cried. "Mv old nurse used to tell ma thai story when I was a very little girl, and I shall always enjoy it so much more now that I know you are the heroine.'"
