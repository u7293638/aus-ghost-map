A Disagreement Did somebody say the sunshine Was fl-iodim; the world to-day F Did somebody say the-o were roses Abloom on the world's highway ? Did somebody ting of the gltdnesj Filling this eiirth of ours . . In the timo if summer and sweotnecsâ€” The ti-ne of tho birds and flowers ? It was all a mislnko, my darling ; Tbe Bunshino had gono away. There id thunder off in tho dintance, There ure clouds on tho wretched day. Not evon tho ghost of pleasure Survoys the withered flowers ; The. gloomiest place uudei- heaven Is this weary earth of ouw. Did somobody whisper ' Patience, Tho clouds will bo lilted soon ' t Did toratbody hint of raunio ? Why, tho hoarts nro out of tune, Yet thoro nro pipers cnlling That the c-loudn will papj away ; l'or love than wrath is strongor, And lovo is king to-day.
