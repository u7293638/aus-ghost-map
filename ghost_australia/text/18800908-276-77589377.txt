A GHOST STORY. A ghost story comes from Nagambie, in Victoria, and is thus_ told by the local paper:-" Persons visiting the railway station, and those who hare had occasion to visit that locality at night, have been greatly frightened by seeing a ' ghost.' A few evenings ago it appeared near the end of the railway platform, and was that of a figure 7 or 8 feet in height, arrayed in pure white. The form was that of a female with, as far as could be discerned, a deathlike face. It was noiseless in its movements, but glided with wonderful rapidity. One of the porters, who has a considerable amount of courage, proceeded in the direction of the apparition, and when within easy range fired at it; but to his astonishment after the smoke had cleared away he found the apparition was close to him. He was perfectly terrified, and, dropping his gun, made for his friends at lightning speed. One night as the half-past 9 cab, filled with ladies and gentlemen, was travelling along the railway road towards the town, a short distance from the station, the spectre again appeared on the hillside about fifty yards from the cab, and as the conveyance proceeded so did the figure. This frightened the pas sengers, and especially the driver, BO that he drove his horses at a furious pace, soon losing sight of the apparition. It is currently reported that the station master has applied to be removed."
