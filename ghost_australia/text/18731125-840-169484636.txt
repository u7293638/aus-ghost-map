CITY POLICE COURT. This Day. DRUNKENNESS — Thomas Jones was charged with being drunk and with using obscene , language. From the evidence of a constable it appeared that prisoner, was drunk in Albert- street last night, and when arrested by the constable he used very bad language. The Police Magistrate sentenced prisoner to a fine of 20s. or 48 hours in the lock-up, remarking that if it had not been his first offence the punishment would have been more severe. LARCENY— Kate Collins was charged with stealing clothes. Prosecutor not being able to attend, prisoner was remanded until Thursday next. It appears that the information against Dr. Emelhainz has been withdrawn on account of informality. ______________________________________ RAMPANT DUMMYSM— We take the following from the Inverell Dispatch of 15th. instant.. — . Mr. District-Surveyor Greaves passed through Inverell last wook, instructed, as we understand, to proceed to Myall Creek and investigate the genuineness of the numerous free- selections lately taken up on that run. His task wo fear, '' will be attended with some difficulty in accom- . plishing. 'The inquiry has boon forced upon the ' .Government owing to the extraordinary interest . .' manifested on tho part of the publio to learn whother tho ominent personages in whose names the land has boon applied , for, comprising Wellington , Sir Robort Pool, Jack Sheppard, Diok Turpin, Pitt, and Lanky Rufferty, and , a host' of other colebrities supposed to bo' long- ; defunct, ore still in existanoo, and have a local ' '? habitation on Myall Station, or otherwise. If. ? ' Mr. Greaves is a believer in spiritualism, his ? courao will be a simple one. Failing in discover- ' ing the coporoal esietanee of the individuals i ) ia in search of, the noxt best thing we can . recommend him to do well be to hold ft ? sethbe ' - on the ground, and invoke their spirits ' from tho vasty deop,' who if they wish to maintiiin' a character for being considered respectable disembodied spirits will appear to his summons, ^]~ and notify thoir tlmnko to those who' have, so \ ?» ??¥ munificently provided them with a stake in tho ; ? ' % country. From tho well known partiality evinced by tho Premier for ghosts we1 may1' reasonably expect that ho will be content with - ' tho apparitions of Buch groat men subscribing simply to the residence clause, without troubling them about improvements. As a rule, however, in dealing with free selectors, we think the Government would be dispose to : award a ' preference to a corporeal boing ' as a more' conclusive evidence of oxi9tance 'than any' ' spiritual presence. If Mr. Greaves should ; -: prove not to be a believer in spiritualism — '«8 wn: ? : more than suBpect ho ia not — why then it: will ' '! devolve upon him to expose the deception 'by'1'1' elion-ing the' end and purpose for' whioh! the ' Myall Creek ghosts were made.”
