'Yea, and ££gndt' said a rubicund faced old bachelor, 'what a figure, and what arms — if I were twenty years younger ? ' The remainder of thia eulogy on the somewhat questionable beauty ef Miss Seacombe was met with peals of laughter from the rest of the company who tiattercd the speaker by telling him that hischanee was aa good as ever. When Eric laid his head on tho pillow that night, the thoughts of tho next days doings kept him awake for a time. Erie had entered himself and his horse for the a- Squatters' Cup,' a race of three miles over some of the stiflVst fences that the heart of any sportsman could wish for. Hia final orders to Tipao were to call him at seven in the morning, from . which tune thero remained hut scarce six houn. With all the coming exciteinont of the morrow Eric was eonn wrapped in sleep, dreaming of great yawning crtra^fs over. K^hich he and his tru»ty hunter were yiag with the utmost ntio- ncerii. CHAPTER V. TUB ,sqi;a.ttkii.s' cup. The day of the Fmb mrne rac ? meeting wasushored in with sll tho app 'urance of wet weather, hut aftvr a aUglrt shower or two which was just enou.'h to lay the dust, the sun which had been hiding be hind a thick bank of cloudcs iasucd forth, making nil Bright again. Everyone was up betimes; aouio were to ride te tbe course and others drive. Amongst those who rode were young D.ilryuiple and Miss Seacombe, the latter atiired iu a dark greeu habit, than which, per haps, nothing could have suited iior better. Eric, of coorso, was to drive his team, and great was the anguish amongst the remaining ladies when they saw Ida Fordyce assisted on to the box seat. These little attentions, which, perhaps, may seem nothing, are not thought lightly of amongst single girls who faucy them selves slighted when perhaps, as often happens, a marriod woman usurps what they regard as their right. In this case, hewever, Eric did not wish to give of fence. He felt himself privileged, being an engaged man, to choose whotueover he pleased, and with that in view chose the beat looking to ornament the front seat of his drag. It could not be denied either that Mrs. Fordyce was very sweet to look upon. She had when analysed no very groat re deeming features in her face, yet witbai, there wasau indescribablebeauty of expres sion which lent a charm to her eyes, and a mouth jost s thought too Isrge, per* haps. The recent showers hod drawn a sweet smelling fragrance from the pine and I eucalypti treea which lined the track that led. to^tha coarse orer- which the drag and four -bowled. Rabbits, these pests of tho squatter, ssudded across the road in hundreds, as the noise of approaching hoofa startled them firom their ambush. Cockatoos, magpies, and the irrepressible jackass wi& ita mockiuff laugh greeted the party from tho neighboring clumps of wattle and gam. The morning was just such a one as makes the hoart of man rejoice, and now vhat the little Fordyce episode had been forgotten, the party under Eric's charge was laughing and talking merrily. I 'I must really lay claim to munh honor in being favored wRh this sest when so many girls are proaent,' ex; claimed Mrs. FordycSj in her most win ning war. 'You must not forget, however,' a i\»wercd Eric, ' thst you are the right .perspn in the right place, seeing that you are acting the part of cha perone.' At this speech an amused little smilo playedjround the corners of -her mouth, knowing that if that term could be ap plied to her in-^heory, ..practically her chaperonage was a farce. 41 Talking of chaperons; .Mr. firmans .court,' aho continued, 'do you believe tho company would behave thoigpelFes auy thp less -were I not prosent. Is it net in Qiese days, w)\en girls are allowed so .mtieh independence, just a trifle abturd? We liaro not the eyea of Argus to watch thorn everywhere.' ' Well, rpalJy now, yon come to put it in that way,' touching up the near side leader, 'ii docs strike mo aa being sneb,' more especially when tho chaperone iu .question- receives as much, if not moro Attention, . than thoso under her charge.' At th:a remark the large black sunshade of Mrs. Fordyce tras gently lowered in o'der to conceal from Eric tho mischievous | smile on her face. j ''Very neatly . put, Mr. Rymans court, it wouldn't do to aay that such a ' tfpeech coming from an engaged man it' jout of place. You are a privileged being, and cxercise.that ri^ht te -perfection ; were you otherwise I should order you to tarn jthe horses' hoads.' Eric knew just how much of this last, apparently withering retort, to believe. .Hers was the kind of . disposition tbat he ;aneicd he ^oould fathom so easily. To: pnt her out o£ temper wss impossible, so whatever else people might hare a&ijl; IllM'il HlQ.pvt:y Mr*. fc...j .i.» tJ-\ I at least, could not be laid to, her charje, lljrt fenshnjid fh? toj|tod s£- tl.o bncl: or ihe vehicle, (Hiring over a raco . *rn' in hei cyos or as litllb import* « !.*?-? a«. tho loMV.-a which strewed tho f nftk'jjfthi'id of ;iIr.hi.

Scenes of all' descriptions were lur positive aversion, and she avoided them. She was without children, and rather congratulated hrraelf ujwn the fart, be lieving as she di(l that it' there had been any they would most certainly have taken after tbeir father. Whatever faults Mrs. Fordyce now ?possessed were duo to the result of this unhappy alliance. H-r marriage, like many auother, had start* d under the most favorable autpicet, only to grow as time wore on, utterly into)* r .ftble. That trust which she had ko im plicitly placed in her husband had bocn ruthlessly betrayed. All her. pcuu I nature re vol rod at the treatment nhe had revived from her partner, and unablr to slu-w proof of his baaemont, was contcat to suffer in silence. 14 What about your chance of winning to-day, Mr. Rymanscourt?' she exclauued, as scarcely-more than -wo or three utiles 1 separated them from tho course. 'Ah, that is morn than I oan say, hut | , if training can do anything and 'Tear- away' doesn't show temper at tho post I'll be bound to aay we'll uiaku a good race of it.' 4* Why are all these exciting pleasures reserved for men,' continued Mrs. For dyce, 14 whilst we poor enormia itching for something of the kind can only look on. It makes me far more ucrvoua to watch a steeplechase than if 1 really rode in it.' 44 Come,' now, Mrs. Fordyce, plucky as | you are, no one would care to see you risking your life in that fashion. Imagine your head not perhaps an eighth of an inch off strolling hoofs. It makes one ehudder to think of it.' Mrs. Foidycc hal norer regarded the situation from this point of view. 44 Well* 1 cati aa«ure you thore will be no pleasure for me to-d«y until Ihe Cup* is over. My heart, will be in my mouth at every jump your horse comca to.' Thia last was said wit ^almost a pathetic tone in her voice, to which Eric, not un flattered by the remark, replied : 44 Nonsense, it will bo tho most glorious fun out, and remember from your hands an'd no other will 1 take the ribbuu of honor if my horse wins/' Mcs. Fordyce would havo wished for nothing better than to hnve been able to crown Erie Rymanscourt with vie tory'i reward. In many ways and by c.uml lit tie speeches let drop, she hud alio wit h r cards to this sptutc young man, v\ im how 'milled on to the course iti ll:e im i«t -.f a varied assortment of people wtio had flocked to the Finhoome meeting. Iu front of what was general] v known as the *' Grand-btand ' ilie 'Knnuuu* mah drag aud its living froi^lir came to a halt. Hod the day been made to order, none better could hnve be«n provided. Tbe course was alive with life;. Bookmakers, louJ-ton^ocd, .*md ar rayed in garments of w'ondciful and fenr- j ful make, shouted the odds in one's cars. Grotesque ce^ro minstrels wandered about from carriago to carriage, govin^ through the usual buffoonery. Aunt Sallies^ three-card trick men, thimble riggers, and the thousand and one houe«t and dishonest disttMUions of a raco course were here in abundance. Within the saddling paddock, whoro Eric, accumpamcd by Rouald Gregory ai-d others of the party were, walked the hones, swathed from head to foot in warm rugs. Jockcys and traimra stood about in knofe here and there, deep iu consultation as to the likelihood of the ; patient training bestowed on their re spective horeea at length resulting in success. Around a dark iron-grey hunter, ckvl from head to foot in a thick navy blue : ; rug with tho initials 41 E.R.' forked in | the corners, stood Eric, Dalryutple aud ! others. I 4' Strip him,' said the former to the I 6table-boy, whose onus were neatly pulled out of their sockets from the cpu a'ant habit - which Tearaway had of throwiug his head up. Presently was revealed to their gaze the. Batin-like coat of the - grey, whose veins, standing out like thick cords, aod bold eyes, clear to crystal, denoted this picture of equine grace and strength to be in tho pink of condition. 44 What do you think of him ?M en quired Eric of Konald. 44 Couldn't be better/' remarked the latter, .wfeose judgment in matters of horse-flesh was much respected. 41 How about that off fore-leg, looka to me a trifle puffy. Has he had bandages on ?' enquired the manager of Tiinboora, walking up to examine the limb iuo.o closely. 41 You've a sharp eye indeed, Mr. Gregory,' Answored Eric. 44 That is the only queer-looking point about him ; there is nothing really wrong, however. I've hunted him twice s fortnight regu larly with the Melbourpe hounds without his showing the slightest sign* of weak ness.'
