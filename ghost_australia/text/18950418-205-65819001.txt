IRISiH FAIRIES. Ghosts and gnblins still live and rule la the imaginations of innumerable Irish men and women, and not merely in remote places, but close evenito big eities It is down West ward amopg the deep -a s d ad. mountsi varfers of 8iign that jlave 'asard the, baes tales and foqad thil nii'ot ardent belief. There, many a pe'sant dreams of growing rich by finding aairy'e crock of gold, and many a peasant's daughter trembles as she passes some tamnns haunted hillside, and goes over in her mind the names of men and women carried off, as tradition will have it, to the dim kingdom. Only very recently one of these fabled robberies was reported to have been attempted. A little girl, who was at service with a farmer in the: village of Grange, suddenly disappeared. There was at once great excitement in the neighbour hood, because it was rumoured that the fai ries had taken her. A villager was said to have long struggled to hold her from them, but at last they prevailed, and he found no thing in his hand but a broomstick. The local constable was applied to, and he at once instituted a house-to-house search, and at the same time advised the people to burn all the becalauns (ragweed) on the field she vanished from, because bucalauns are sacred to the fairies. They spent the whole night burning them, the constable repeating spells the while. In the morning the little girl was found, the story goes, wandering in the field. She said the fairies had taken her away a great distance, riding on a fairy horse. At last she saw a big river, and the man who tried to keep her from being car ried off was drifting down it-such are the topsyturvydoms of fairy glamour - in a cockleshell. Brides and new-born children are especially in danger. Peasant mothers, too, are sometimes carried off to nurse the chiidren of the fairies. At the end of seven years they have a chance of returning, and if they do not escape then are always prisoners. A woman, said still to be living, was taken from near a village called Dallisodare, and when she came home after seven years she had no toes-she had danced them off.-IV. B. Yeats, in the Leisure Hour.
