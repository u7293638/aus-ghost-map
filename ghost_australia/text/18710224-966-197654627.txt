BIBLE CHRISTIAN DISTRICT MEETING. A public service in connection with this District Meeting was held in Young- street Chapel on Wednesday evening, when the Rev. J. Hancock .preached the official sermon. His discourse wad founded on a part of Acts xix. 2, " Have ye received the Holy Ghost?" The different titles of Holy Spirit were first referred to, and His attributes were dwelt upon. Appropriate passages of Scripture were pointed out in which His omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence were clearly proved. -It was urged that there was needed more of the Spirit, as experimental godliness was impossible apart from His presence. There would be no lack of earnest labourers in the service of God if they got more'power and a richer baptism from on high. After the sermon the ordinance of the Lord's Supper was administered to a large number of communicants. - On the following morning the sittings were resumed. A resolution was passed sympathizing with the Rev. J. Way in his failing health, amd expressing a high appreciation of his past labours. The greater part of the_ day was occupied in discussing the desirability of dividing the circuits which are considered too large to be satisfactorily worked. • PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY.—The next quarterly concert of the Philharmonic Society is advertised for Thursday evening, March 30.
