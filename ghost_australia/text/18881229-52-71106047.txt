For the New Year. \- I buried tho old year sighing ; I laid it away with tears, With the pitiful faded blossoms Of the unforgotten years : And I turn'd'to my lonely fireside ; For I thought what the New would bo, With only the ghosts of gladness To walk through tho world with mo. I woko when the bells wore ringing ;. Brightly the morning smil'd; And there ! in the sunny doorway There stood a gold-hair'd ohild.. And she sang, as af ar she pointed, And her eyes to heaven woro cast, " Be ever the roads so weary, They lead to peace at last !"
