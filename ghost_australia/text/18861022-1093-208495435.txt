CAULFIELD TRAINING NOTES. [By Telegraph.] Melbourne, October 21, Owing to yesterday's downpour the course proper was closed, so that the Cup horses were compelled to work on the Band and tan tracks, which were rather heavy. Silvermine, accom panied by Faithful, finished a useful working gallop, the Cup horse going well. Kohai was given an extender over six furlongs on the tan, going especially well, Havelock put in a couple of turns on the tan, while his Btable companions, Elling ton and Toronto, were allotted a couple of rounds, the pair finishing strong. Blondin and Highland Chief were moving along on the tan. The two-year-olds, Julian Gray, Nec tarine, and Carnival, were spurting over 3 and 4 furlongs. Little John and his stable friend, Jim Cain, finished two useful rounds on the tan in a very workmanlike manner. The former, who is greatly fancied for the Cup, going in his usual lazy style. Walter Victor, Guculus and Urius, Mormon Jack, King of the West, and a colt by Hamlet were working at intervals. Phoebe Walton, Alexandria, and Isabel were treated to a nice pace exercise on the sand. Ben Bolt put in three turns, the last being at a good working pace. Bohemian went for serviceable work, The Metropolitan winner is in rare fettle at present. The Ghost after working yesterday, and while being dried, lashed out with both heels against ant iron fence and cut his fetlock a bit.
