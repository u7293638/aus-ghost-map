BV THE AUTHOB OF ' STANFIEU) HAIX,' 'M1NNIGRKY,' &c.; The city of Chcritz Khan — in Russia they give very magnificent names to places which in more civilised countries would scarcely be honoured by a notice on tho maps — is little more than a long straggling village, with tbe Greek, or national, -chur-ib. at one cm), and tho re sidence of the governor at (he other ; public buildings, properly speaking, it can scarcely he said to po-w8— u-'l^ss, indeed, 'tho prison and a low wooden edifice, in which the traders in fur are occasionally lodged, be worthy of the appellation. As for tin? guard of Cossacks — at'out eighty in number — stationed at the place, they either quarter themselves without ocremony on the in habitants, or lodge in the upper part of the town, flunk ing the only two entrances to the place, which is surrounded by walls \\}f wood ami stone, cemented together by the mod mi slime collected in summcriry the exiles on the banks of -he Obi. The chief entrance to tbe town, natned after the Czar, Nkolai Thwr, faced the north, and commanded a vast view over the desolate snow stoop, whose undulating surface re 6embled a sea suddenly changed -te marble, the edges caused fey She drifting of ihe sand being as regular as though the plough had traced them. About fifty yards from the gates stood a clumj- of solitary pine trees, the lower brandies bent even to the earth toy the weight of snow accntnaikted upon them. The moon was shining with that intense brightness seen only in northern latitudes ; so powerful was tho lif- ht she gave that not a sable could have crossed the ground within shot without being perceived as distinctly as by daylight, when four men, clothed in sheepskin dresses, and wearing the usual mask as a protection to the face, approached the spot we have attempted to describe, a fifth drove- offvrilh the sledge from which they had alighted, bat speedily rejoined his companions after having concealed the vehicle in a hut at a ehort distance : he led a hound by a strong cord. Tbe party consisted of our hero, Henri de la Tour, the Poll1, and Alexis Troubetekoi. All four were armed with their rifles — a precaution rendered necessary on account of the wolves. ' Here we are, at Cheritz Khan at last,' observed the young Frenchman : ' and, if the qnestion be not indiscreet, may I aBk wby are we here ?' This wee addressed to Julian. 'The hour of vengeance has arrived,' was the reply. ' The innocent blood which has so long cried to Heaven for justice has been heard at last, lshmael is within the walls.' The brother of the murdered Oscar examined the priming of his weojKm Wtb an air of determination which announced that he for one was resolved that this time the Jew should not escape Hie penalty due to his crime. ' Patience ! ' continued the speaker.' ' Patience ! ' repeated the young man; 'every moment that die mur derer walka the. earth is a reproach 'to me, envh hivnth be .draws a delay of justice. In the still hour of the night I see the eyos of his victim tnmed'to wnrds me, as if to nsk for vengeance on bis cowardly assassin. I cannot rest till it is fulfilled ! ' ' Fear not,' observed the Pole calmly ; ' thts debt shall be paid in full. It is haTd, I know, to preach patience when the heart is on fire, and the brain maddened by the sense of injury ; but precipitation would defeat our purpose. Ishniacl has contrived to secure the protection of the Governor --f Ch'ritz Khan.' ' By bribery, of course,' said Charles Vavassenr; 'that man would soil his very soul for a handful of rubles.' ' And make no bad, bargain cither,' exclaimed Henri. '? considering the ilnmngfvl Tmdilvm of i]ip article. How did you obtain the information ? ' ' By the same moans as ihp assassin his protection,' answered Jnlinn ; ' for if the governor is mercenary, his subor dinates are even more corrupt. I posses (he clue to the intentions of lslnniiel, and, at the very moment of his triumph, will defeat them.' ' But bow are we to obtain entrance to the town,' demanded Charles Vava«s enr, ' without our presence being knowu. The gates are shut ? ' ' That, too, is arranged. Tbe officer is bribed.' By this time Jack Curling had joined then) with tbe hound, it was settled amongst tbe speakers that the faithful fellow should remain outside the gate, in order to be rendy with the sledge in case of their being discovered, . and an immediate flight rendered necessary. The difficulty was to provide a place of concealment for him, where he. might remain for several hours without the risk of finding him on their return frozen to death. I After some search a fissure wjis found j in the will of the town close to the I gates, sufficiently large for Jack to squeeze himself into. It had been caused by the intense frost acting upon the mud, which served 'to biud Vt . unhewn stones and timbers together, and was bo near the gate and the solitary clump of trres we hare described ns to enable him to see everything that passed. ' Be careful,' said our hero, who insisted upon Jack's taking bis own sheepskin cloak to assist in keeping him warm, ' and on no account remove your ma*k.' ' Never fear, Mastor Charley,' re plied the honest lad, ' I have no wish to return Ui Harleyford without a nose.' ? At the name of Harieyford his master sighed. ' If you feel your limbs cramped — or nnmbrcss Rpronding ovi-r them — or in cliued to sleep,' he aildrd, ' quit, your hiding-place, and run as fast as your legs will carry yon to the sledge ; re member,' lie added, ' that half the pleasure of my return to England— if ever [escape — wi-nld be destroyed unless you accompanied me.' ' Don't ee, Master Charley, don't ee speak so,' replied Jack, at tho same time raising his hand, which, in its sheep skin glove, rest'tiiMeil the paw of a huge bear, to his eyes to brush aside, a tear, ' this he a bad counr ry to cry in. They do say at home that salt water won't fieeze; let 'em come to Rooshia and try it.' Having seen the Epcaker as com fortaMe as under the circumstances it was possible to make him, the four friends marched boldly towards the gates of the town ; on renching which Jnlian uttered a shrill whistle — the. signal agreed upon between himself and the officer he had bribed. The small wicket at the side was opened, and Jack saw them disappear, with a secret fore boding that many dangers would have to be encountered before they met again. ' Well,' he exclaimed, for since Charles Vavasseur had reduced him— uuless on very particular occasions, like the present — to act the part of the mute, he had contracted the habit of talking to himself when alone ; ' this be the strangest thing of all ! What nonld they say at, home conld they see me sconced like, a rat in a hole, built up in a'#o0sftfdri;w'oJ!;' J}y the time''! get back Nat won't have much the better of me. He may know the tricks of L\m non better than I do, bnt not more of tbe .world.' It was enough that his master bud told him they shonld return. Hove or when never troubled him. He placed iruplivit confidence in his word. The promise was the only thing which sus tained him in the midst of the privations which he daily endured. The poor fellow had been about half an hour in his not very comfortable position, when be heard n kind of scratching noise just over his bend, while ho instinctively drew into his hiding-place, wondering what it conld po«sihly mean. Presently a rope was let down, and a few minutes afterwards a man descended. The un known passel so near him that he could have touched him. ' It be no ghost at any rate,' thonght Jack, at the Fame time holding his breath ; ' they don't require ropes to climb by.' As the mysterious personage reached the irrouud, he muttered something, which he thought sounded very much like an oath. In nil probability he was not mistaken. The man looked carefully round him as if to ascertain whether he was observed or not ; and satisfied to all appearance with the scrutiny that such was not the case, walked leisurely towards the clump of trues. Jack, who had ample time to observe his features, recognised the assassin ; lshmael, and bitterly regretted that he j was unarmed, or that the hound had not been left with him. As tbe Israelite j had a brace of pistols in bis belt, the ' lad thonght it most prudent to remain \- where he was, but if discovered he resolved to sell his life dearly. With some difficulty lie contrived to draw the long clasp-knife from his pocket — the only weapon he possessed. Once or twice he felt strongly tempted to cut the cord, which still dangled in front of his place, of concealment. lshmael jnean while .began to dig at the root of the tbir,d pine-tree ; and hav ing with much lafcour, for tbe grqtm was as hard as stone, succeeded in mdt ing a hole of considerable depth, he drew from his belt a leathern bag, which hr dropped into it, and immediately began replacing the earth and snow, tmS terminated his labour hy drawing bis wolf-skin cap several times as lightly as possible over the latter, so as to prevent the appearance of its having been dfe turbed. ' That be a cunning trick,' muttered' Jack; 'but 1 know one as cute. It beant always those who hide that find1 again.' After this observation, which suffi ciently indicated his purpose, he carefollj drew his head as far as possible into tfi*' hole, and held his breath, lest thfc* ? murderer, whom he doubted notwoold return by the way he canoe, sbbuld perceive that his actions had benr watche i. Jack decidedly had far more presence of mind than when Sir Edward Challoner sent him- to London' to find out his yotmg master.' Not even his cousin Nat conld have acted more prudently. With that terrier-like patience for which he was most dis tinguished, the lad remained' for more than an hour after the. Jew had returned and drawff the rope up after him, in Ms* place of concealment, scarce?}' venturing to breathe. At last he descended, and proceeded at Me fa 'Wiia,i 'i'nterred so carefully. Hy means of his~ c!nsp- kuife, he quickly removed' the earth, and drew forth tbe bag. It was filled with silver roubles. There mnsthave been a thousand, at tbe very least. Doubtless they were IshmaePs share in the profits of the illicit trade which, with the assistance of the Bights, he had ?-VJ IVilt *-tll i IVU Vl|, ' No bad night's work,' thought Jack, as ho coolly placed the treasure in his girdle. ' I dare say the rascal stole them. May be, they'll help Master Charley and I back to.. England again.' The idea that there was any thing wrong in appropriating them never entered his imagina tion. He considered every thing legitimate spoil which was taken from a Rooehian, It had been settled between him and his master that he shonld wait till daybreak for the Teturn of the party, and in the event of tlieir nonappear ance, to return with the sledge' to the Cossack station in the ? wood alone. Anxiously did the faithful fellow watcii the break of morning. At every rustling of the wind he fancied that he hear.l the footstep of his master. In his anxiety for bis safety be delayed obeying the orders which had been given him; nor was it till the gates were opened by the guard that, with a heavy, heart he retraced his steps to the hut where he had concealed the vehicle. For the first time since his sojourn in Siberia, he felt how utterly dependent he was upon the intelligence of others to direct him. Whilst he is driving over the frozen enow the eight or ten versts between. Chcritz Khan and the station, we will, follow the friends in their seaTch after lshmael. No sooner had they entered the town than Julian, after paying the officer his stipulated bribe, took the lead, and was followed by his companions in silence;, even the hound appeared to comprehend that the adventure they were engaged1 in , was a dangerous one, for he never once gave tongue, or attempted to stray from their side. The sagacity of the animal . was only equalled by his docility and fidelity. After marching through the prineijwiL 6A1U1I MOHT, THE JF.WEKS, MCIlhtvIlEl) llV IMIMAKI., TO WHOM SHE WAS BETROTHED, AND HEB DEATH AVENGED JHT JDL1AN, THE POLE. streets, they turned to the email square in wl»ch*U»e Imilding appropriated to the use of traders, who at stated periods yisited the -district, was situated. As we before stated,' it was a low, irregular edifice, intersected by. long corridors and partitions, which divided it ou either side into separate thsmbers. : ;,?' These partitions, which were of wood, did not extend -quite to the roof; on the contrary, there was sufficient -space to enable auy one,' provided iie were^uffir cicntly curious, and aotiva enough, to climb them, to observe everything that passed in the aiijoining-apartrucmt. In order to enable our readers per fectly to comprehend the scene we are ?bout to describe, it is necessary' they should understand the locality. On entering the building, they found s rcmgh-loofcing Tartar, evidently, from the keys at his^irdle, one of the officials of the place, waiting to receive -them. At the sight of the Pole, his flat, un meaning countenance relaxed into a smile ; and his little dark eyes twinklct with avarice and cunning. .Aarleajmrt, Eeuri^efiretllf. jvpudfifed. lhBt their conjpiiiiivui, b^oura pm- inrny reliance 6n4nd fidelity' of such a beiug.

There was & terrible' resolution In the deerj-fiet. tlionrrtitfiir eye, as' h6 fixed it on the murderer,! irprti whom, till the moment of action' arrived, he never once removed it. 'At last,' murmured Ishmael, as a sound _ of approaching footsteps was . heard in the eonider, 'the moment of my triuipph is at hand.' . With a. smile of satisfaction, he un barred the door of the chamber, in which , everything, by the connivance of the \ governor, had been arranged for his marriage, and where for the last three days he had remained concealed. Reuben Bight, followed by his two sons, \ who led Sarah 'between them, and the rabbi, entered the room. The expect ant bridegroom carefully drew the heavy wooden bar after them.

' : Before he could draw a second weapon; the fangs of the hound were buried in his throat, and he lay strug gling with him on the floor, which was slippery with his own1 blood; as well ae that of Sarah. The report of the riistol had evidently alarmed the guardians of the place. Cries were heard, and the tramp of approaching footsteps. The countenance of Julian became almost sublime as he p'aced his foot on the writhing form of the assassin, and discharged the contents of his rifle in his chest. All this passed bo rapidly Uiat neither Reuben Bight nor his 60ns had time or presence of mind sufficient to interfere.: The act of justice was no sooner accotn- ? pli6hed than the avenger turned coolly from the murderer, and knelt by the side of his expiring victim, who fer vently pronounced his name. The next instant the . apartment was filled with the ' guard of Cossacks and the officials of the place, whose first care was to disengage Ishmael from the fangs of ' the hound. 'There, therp Vf. muttered ,the He brew, pointing to ihe' Pole, ' there is my ssassin !' Tie raised himself ?with difficulty on his elbow, and glared with a look of deadly- hate on Julian. Henrj, Charles,- and Alexis were sur rounded i-y the guard, -and a message was 'despatched to inform the governor what had occurred. - 'Too late 1' murmured Julian, bond ing-over the murdered girl. Sarah looked up into his countenance, which bore (he impress of grief and self-reproach, and a faint 6mile rested on h°r features.

' You hear her,' said Ishmael, whose wound . was not immediately mortal, although it vras impossible he could re cover, for the ball had broken his spine. This was addressed to the Rabbi, who bpgan to suspect that he had acted an unworthy part in the attempt to force the maiden to a marriage which her soul abhorred, when he heard the Nazarene, as be styled the noble-hearted Julian, confirm the assertion of the maiden, that she had remained firm to the religion of her race. ' Pray for me,' she said, ' that I may receive a blessing out of Zion.'' ' Dost thou die in the faith of thy fathers ?' he demanded. 'IxHeasI have lived,' replied the girl ; ' a true daughter ol Israel. Isaac Baltar raised his hands, and extended them over her.

'Can such a soul be lost ?' thought Julian, as h-\ gazed upon her with admiration and sorrow.

A glance, of triumphant joy illumi nated for an instant the features of the Hebrew girl ; much that had been dark to her understanding in her own faith became clear ; love dispersed the mists which shrouded the future ; her heart comprehended a heaven which promised to unite her eternally with those she loved. ' I am happy !' she replied ; ' death has lost its terrors.' .It was evident that the poor girl was sinking fast; as her eyes were closing,, the Pole pressed his lips to hers. ] ' The first and last kiss of love I shall, ever know,' he murmured in her ear. .. . ?

' I'll sell his life cheaply ; he has no friends to interest themselves in his fate. Besides, he has committed a murder, and absented himself from bis station without leave.' ' The knout !' groaned Ishmael, ' the knout 5' ' Certainly,' said the governor, ' he deserves it ; and the price ?' ' All I possess,' replied the mur derer ; ' you shall be my heir.' He whispered in the ear of the un pricipled wreteh who thus consented to prostitute his authority, and minister to his vengeance, a 6um bo large, that the avaricious functionary could scarcolv believe he was serious ; he could not comprehend how an. exile could be the possessor of 60 much money. Certainly not by trading in furs. ' Are you serious ?' he asked, ' Perfectly.' ' And where and when am I to re ceive it. ?' ?

This was a mere ruso ; all that the villian possessed had been concealed by him in the bag buried at the foot of the fir tree, and removed by Jack Curling. 'He chnckleS secretly af th''o* idea of dis appointing the avaricious instrument at his hatred of a portion of the,prom^ ised recompense. ' Better tell me at once,' observed his excellency in an insinuating tone ; ' consider, my good friend Ishmael, how frail is the thread of existence ; you have not many hours to live. Fhould you go off suddenly without informing me, it would be-a -robbery, and you would never expect to be happy, dying with a debt of honor unpaid.' The Hebreiv remained firm, and for the best of all possible reasons ; he had nothing more to confess. His intention was, after the execution of Julian, to name a place so distant that his own fleeting life would have passed away before the governor discovered the trick he had put upon him. ' Were I on the brink of eternity,' he said, ' and thegates of paradise open to receive me, I Bhould pause and turn back mv eves to earth for such a foy. 'T feel,1' he added, grinding his teeth, 'that I cannot-die while that man lives. Hasten, possess yourself of the first half ,of the inheritance I have promised yon, and doubt not the rest.' His confederate took him at his word, and quitted the apartment, renewing his promise that ou his return he would fulfil the terrible promise be had given of subjecting Julian to the torture of. the knout. 'Before quitting the place he gave strict orders that everything which the skill of the surgeon could accomplish, to prolong .the life of Ishmael should be done — every hour of his existence was 6f value to him. He then entered his carriage/ . and drove to the city gate, calling on his way at the prison, 1o give the necessary orders. On entering the cell of th6 captives, even the cold un imaginative heart of the governor was struck by the dignified manner of Julian, whose features were as calm as those of the avenging angel a(ter sheathing the sword ivith which he had punished crime. The Pole was perfectly aware of his danger — knew that it was no longer in his power to offer a bribe to his judge, the only key to whose com passion was gold. With his high sense of honor, he bad given tho last ruble he possessed to the Tartar, who guided him and his companions to the place of Ishmael's concealment. It was a promise, and he kept it re ligiously. 'So,' said the great man, the mo mentary feelinff nf mimirnt.mn nuiVlrlir subsiding, 'you have quitted the station assigned to you without permission.' ' Even so,' auswered Julian, calmly. ' And taken the life of a fellow prisoner, who — ' ' Say rather, of a murderer, a double assassin,' interrupted the exile, ' whose hands were stained with thfi blood of Oscar Troubotskoi and Sarah the Jewess.' ' And who authorised you to interfere with the course of justice I — if the man really committed the crimes you charge him with, it was your duty to have de nounced him.' ' To whom ?' ' To me.' 'This is a mockery, sir,' exclaimed tne prisoner, ' l'ou knew, as well as I did, of his presence at Cheritz Khan.' ' Then you are doubly guilty,' re torted the governor, with a scowl, 'in. shedding the blood of a man who was under my protection. If you imagine that such an offence can pass unpun ished, you will be quickly undeceived — justice will be speedy !' 'Your justice!' repeated Julian; ' the Jew must be richer than I im agined ; or perhaps you are a partner in his illicit trade.' ' What trade ?' eagerly demanded the great man. ' I am hereto suffer, not to denounce,' answered the noble youth, with a look of resignation, for he remembered that Eeuben Bight, the grandfather of Sarah, must be involved in his accusation, and badly as the old man had acted' towards tie defenceless girl, be could not endure ? ~ ? ^^~^— i merSKa °/ de'0Uncill& Li'» to the tende. mercies of sucli a man.
