Strange Doings at Dubbo. INVISIBLE STONE-TfiEOWEBS. MYSTERIOUS MISCHIEF-MAKING. Considerable interest has been aroused by the report that missiles, such as brickbats, nieces of wood and iron, scraps of- mortar, &c;, were being thrown by unpeen hands at and around a newly erected residence in our pleasant suburb, New town, Dubbo. Tour correspondent, on inquiry. found that in addition to these reckless proceed ings strange tappings at the windows, and per formances on the bell and knocker had varied the source of alarm, no signs of human agency being visible. The disturbance commenced on Tuesday night last, and occurred on each of the following three evenings. Flying pieces of brick were also seen in broad daylight, at 11 o'clock in the forenoon, and early in the afternoon. On several occasions the knockings also occurred in the daytime. The owner removed the bell, but has replaced it, hoping to have an opportunity of detecting the source of trouble. The disturbances have been witnessed in some phase or another by 15 or 16 people, including members of the police force. On Sunday numbers visited the spot and held consultations over the scattered missiles, but so abnormal manifestations took place. Around the enclosure are several patches of shrubby under growth, which, would afford shelter to any evilly-disposed persons ; but there appears to ba a total absence of motive, and the phenomena have net abated in con sequence of the efforts to ensure detection. The explanations and suggestions of visitors have bfien numerous and combined with the worry of the aflair prove embarrassing to the proprietor of the premises, who is not quite sure whether he would not rather have the ghost alone to contend with. No one has been actually struck by the missiles although narrow escapes have occurred.
