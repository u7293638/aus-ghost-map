NEWS BY CABLE. ? A, ? (From the Evening News Correspondents.) Amy Robsart's Ghost. SALE OF CUMNOR PLACE. THE PURCHASER DISCONTENTED. ALLEGED UNHISTORIC CLAIMS. London, April 17. — Mr. Hall, a gentle man who purchased Cumnor Place from the Earl of Abingdon, believing it to be the Cumnor Place celebrated for the murder of Amy Robsart, and reported to be haunted by her ghost, is now suing for a rescinding of the purchase, owing to the unhistoric nature of the Place's claim to be considered the scene of the occurrence. The trial concluded to-day. The jury returned a verdict for the Eaxl of Abingdon. [Cttmnor, about three miles west of Oxford, has an old manor house, formerly belonging to the Abbots of Abingdon, and after the Reformation granted to Anthony Forster, believed to be one of the murderers of Amy or Anne, first wife of Lord Robert Dudley, afterwards Earl of Leicester. Thie lady is known to lovers of romance as Amy Bobsart, and her story is best told by Sir Walter Scott in ' Keirilworth.** The general theory is that Leicester, as he is best known, being of belief that if single again he would be able to espouse Queen Elizabeth, get Anthony Forster and Sir Richard Varney to put her out of the way. They got her to Cumnor Place and she never left it alive, 'being found at the foot of the stairs irith. her neck broken. It has, of course, been part of the story that her ghost walks at certain times, and this it appears added a charm to the many others possessed by a building purchased by Mr. Hall ac ihe genuine old manor iMjnse, but the claims of which to be so considered he is n«w more than doubtful' about.
