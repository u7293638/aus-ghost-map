? A letter in another column,, under the signature of' JPjste/i,' conveys a picture -of the Laiinceston side, which, if true, Js really frightful; and there seems, by our ?extracts' from The In dependent, to be ?but too much reason to fear' its accuracy. This arises from that unfortunate selfse ourity, in which His Excellency Lieute nant Governor Arthur has sufferedhitn- self to be lulled by the flattery of those who have so besmattered his system of JP.rison Discipline, with empty nnd un merited praise. But for such a servile line of .conduct,. His, Excellency .would have been awakened to a sense ofimpend ing^danger, and thereby been enabled^ to avert the evil, instead of letting it fall up on the Colony , and afterwards taking plea sures to remedy it., ' It cannot, however, be denied, that, if the local Government chooses, to exert its energies, bushrang ing cannot again. , flourish asjt has done ; '? but'unless : the extraordinary apathy which now prevails be removed, and that soon} thecouritrv will of bourse beover-runwith these fellows.

Free and conditional, par dons to convicts for life, is the tbirig to ex terminate bush-ranging, and, coupled ?with unrestricted grants of land to free peo ple, as leaders, would rid the Colony in a short time of these lawless band. ~ But so long as only a. few ill-paid constables are allowed to each district, so long; as volunteers are returned to their Road Parties, bush-rangers will bo rathersup ported than otherwise ; and, so long as .gangs are left without free and efficient; overseers, prisoners will abscond, and re : niaiii at large. ; ?-. ... ,-.'U :??'??.; ..These statements.- however,' are liable to be misunderstood .j'on the other side of ^giobe, .'Unless accompanied by- the expla nation, that these disturbances are confinr «d to one particular district, which, from ? . peculiar circumstances, is 'peculiarly ex posed to such attacks.

But Vila's Miow truly are these improvements .the token of our state. Where we see a fine building, it Has' now become almost. proyerbialto exclaim, 'That splendid edifice must soon fall into the hands of the Usurers.' Yes, we repeat it, that the Colony has out- grown herself- — her merchants have, over traded — -.the Usurers, with their accursed traffic' le-' galised, -have , been called, upon, to keep up the' bubble— desperation has.induced,contracts which' in nine cases out of ten. can .never be. fulfilled; and: the result is, non-payment of bills, jaw costs, im-; prison ment, and riiin. The days of foreclosure arej ' at hand, and we tremble at the crash which must then take place, unless averted by some financial scheme.. The year thirty-three has' passed; may ?our friends never experience such another year of 'depression. A. new year opens upon us under ?no very promising auspices, to be sure; but 'hope' :Sti 11 brightens days to come,' even when memory cannot. ' gild the past.' Heartily, therefore, do we wish our friends and the Colony at- large, a ibappy new year,; and shall refrain from a recapitu lation of the affairs of the old one, as we have no desire to tear open newly- cicatrized wounds. Our subscribers and advertising friends are-, requested particularly to attend to their several accounts with us ; for our expenses are so exceed ingly heavy that extended credit we can no longer afford. A glance at our ledger shews us many in arrear since the Colonist first commenced, and to such we must say that an early adjustment is now indispensable. Individually, the sums are small, and can therefore be easily spared ; but if all were collected together in our possession we should be enabled greatly to augment and improve our Journal. We feel convinced that thoughtlessness alone is the cause of the neglect, and therefore we should be extremely sorry to be driven to pursue such other courses to obtain our own as would be the most ready and t]ie most certain. .With the new year considerable improvements will be made in the Colonist ; and by die use of smaller type, nearly one-third more matter vyill be condensed into :our columns. To advertisers, this will be an immense saving; as.it will cause a reduction of full fifteen per cent, in, the charge of ?advertisements — in consequence of which, a- slight alteration will take place in our terms— single, numbers, and subscriptions paid quarterly will continue as heretofore ; but persons paying in advance will be charged 7s. 6d. per quarter whether one quarter or one year's advance be paid. At such a season it may be expected we should say a few words of ourselves : we shall, therefore, say a very few. . Since toe have held the helm. 'of this Journal,' it has been.our endeavour to make it ! useful, and to avoid,' as far as might be consistent with' public'. justice, personal censure. The i Acts of the Authorities we , have jealously watched, and shall continue, to do so. Such an un derstanding we shall endeavour to maintain, by a. steady and unflinching adherence to those prin ciples which we consider right.' ?

It would be just as equitable to say, that all Gentlemen without a pass should he apprehended, because convicts have escaped under the garb of Gentlemen, as to make the application to sailors. The Public is,.however, the best judge of the case; the arguments of which, both pro and ?con, we now lay before them in another column. , With reference to ?' Appendix, No. 3,' which is' a Minute, explanatory of the Duties Confirma tion Act, as altered, we have a few words to offer. On perusal of the Minute in question, our readers will perceive, that it is the intention of the Government to add some fifteen per cent, to the present Customs' Duties, by imposing a new scale adjusted to the Imperial /Weights and. Measures. On this subject, we have, at the. opening of -.die ''Session, expressed bur opinions ; ahd we did hope after' what h'ad been' said, that such an idea would liave' been abandoned. It ?vfill.be. argued -of course, that as tliti Imperial 'Gallon exceeds in'cap'acity ' the- Wine' Gallon, so 'the duty 'imposed :upon spirits per .Mmrjerial' Gallon should. exceed, thejduty imposed' .uponjthe same article's per wine gallon, tb confirm :the ex istingj rate of .duties.:, ,Let, us. briefly examine ?.tins plausible tale ; and in the '.first place enquire'what necessity exists for altering1 tlie 'settle at' all? .Is the. revenue' diificierit 'V - No. Is1 the Colony in so -flourishing a condition' as tb require blood-letting to prevent repletion T 'N0.1 'Is the additional-tax;' for, sucli.it is, required for; any. /ocaZ... purpose.?

Such then is the rtiotive of the act. Now let us prove that it; is nothing: more than an ih-' crease of Taxes, disguised under ,the .specious pretext of an adjustment of. rales, with the new measures. Admitted 'that \ the ', Imperial Gallon exceeds the Wine- Gallon iii capacity, and also that as a. matter of. course a greater qu'antily of ? spirits will pass;, under the .denomination of- a gallon, nevertheless a gallon Imperial is but. a gallon still.

This is the love of morality, felt by th upper classes; and depend upon it, that the projector of the new scale of duties had as much an idea of repressing immorulity, and drunkenness, by what he pro- posed, as he had of being translated to heaven like Elijah in a chariot of fire ! No, no. —— Revenue, ways and means, money, is the object of the meaasure; and we sincerely trust, that our mercantile Councillors will manfully protest against such a monstrous infraction of their rights and the rights of the people. Taxes when im- posed for purposes, not LOCAL are illegal; and as we have already more money in the Treasury, than is consumed for such purposes, it is manifest that the imposition of any additional burden is at once unnecessary and illegal. _____________________________________________________ ON Saturday evening Mr. E. C. GREEN had an assembly of his pupils at Mr. Deane's long room in Elizabeth-street. Between thirty and forty young ladies and gentlemen were present, besides a numerous assemblage, composed princi- pally of their parents. Dancing commenced at eight o'clock, and continued until eleven. It was really gratifying to see the progress the young folks have made in this useful and necessary accomplishment ; and the manner in which they have been brought forward by Mr. Green reflects the greatest credit on him, and promises considera- ble advantages to the rising generation of the Colony. . The following vessels were at the Bay of Islands, when the Brazil Packet sailed, viz:— the Eliza, Francis Lauton, of London, out 20 months, with 1200 barrels of oil had sprung her main mast, and detained for a new one; the Mon- tano, Edwards from America, with 50 barrels, hadput back in quest of a boat and men, who had absconded, and were ultimately been given up by the natives.
