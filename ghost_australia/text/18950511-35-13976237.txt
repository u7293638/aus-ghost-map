CURRENT LITERATURE, j History of the Catholic Church in Australia, By PATRICK FRANCIS CARDINAL, MORAN, Arch -bishop of Sydney. The Oceanic Publishing Company Sydney, 189-. in the two quarto volumes his Eminence Cardinal Moran has- undertaken to tell the story of the Church of which he is the Australian Road The writer's command of material and his interest in his subject singularly qualify him to discharge the historian's office in this respect, in a mirror interesting not alone to the members of the Church of which the progress is described above, but to those who will view the volumes as a contribution to general Australian history We are informed on the title-page that the work contains " in mr original and official documents in cannon tion with the Church in Australasia bo- nnies others from the archives of Rome, Westminster, and Dublin, which are here presented to the public for the first time " From the publishers presence n o learn that the writer's attention has been to make his history a, popular and readable book The author's doll section describes the volumes to those *' Bishops and Priests, past and present, of Australasia, who by their -cal, pilot, and self sacrifice beneath the Southern Cross, have laid sheep -and broad the foundations and are steadily building up the stately edifices of a glorious Church " The scope of these two volumes is certainly comprehensive Beginning with some i references to early discovers, the convict period, and the early days of the colony, it connects these phases of our history with the work of early clergy mr it like Ihetrv, M'Lnoroo, and others Then comes the order of Dr Ullathorne, followed by that of Dr Polding, the first Australian in archbishop The progress of Catholicism in all the colonies is then described in separate chapters and more are chapters on the education question and the work of the con- vents at 21 a collection of Dr landing's letters J The wider interest this book will command Bill doubtless depend on the author's expression of his news on matters suggested by the story he has to tell We find Cardinal Nor in in one place, for example, among his remarks on oath Austrnhtsinn exploration featuring the theory that De (Quiros was the actual discoverer of the Australian continent By extracts from Anas, Torres, and the n motor's own petitions to the lung he seeks to show that the discovery of Do Cjuiros cannot be referred merely to one of the New Hebrides or one of the Solomon Islands None of those islands that any place to fit t! o descriptions, says Cardinal Moran, will all the details corro Ifipond with Port Cutts on the Queensland coast, in about the same latitude as that in which the Spaniard sailed The theory is an interesting one, but it is doubtful if the known facts of the case will allow of its over being more than a oonjootmo Passing from this subject, the Cardinal's pen paints a squalid picture of Mio early days of Sydney in the convict period, and this part of the work is not pleasant i eadine Much care is taken to set forth the difficulties and opposition met with by the Cardinal's produces more in missionary work, and some curious incidents of the old colonial days was brought to light Among them may be classed a formal communication from Sir George Gipps the then Go vernor, inviting Dr Polding to consider the a li is about so of adopting some designa- tion other than that of " Roman Catholic " for the community the bishop represented Some pleasant personal anecdotes of that prelate, whose name was held in respect of his day by all classes, relieve the sombre colouring of this part of the work. It is curious to read hero how Dr Polding, in petitioning the Holy See for the appointment of a coadjutor and successor prayed ' your Holi- ness to grant that the said coadjutor be an Englishman ," not, goes on the position, " that I desire national favours or sentiments, for an Archbishop of my arm should have lived such a matter of nationality," but because " in an Areluep scopes Soo like this where 'there are such bitter And- mosities between the Irish and Orange societies, a man superior to all party spirit and exalted by mental accomplishments and social virtues above, the ordinary level would be more acceptable " The appointment of Dr. Vaughan however, instead of cash ring this satisfactory i gentiment, called forth an " uncontrollable Irancour" among the Protestant body, says Cardinal Moran Ono journ ii he quotes as rai ing (that the worst cargo of human woe and wicked n«>6S unshipped in bydno'-Coio" was preferable to the landing of the Coadj utor-Archbishop The chapter on the Education question covers the whole history of that controversy, and the steps taken in the direction of popular education since the foundation of the colony The subject is looked at, of course, from the writer's own point of view, and the Cardinal quotes with evident astonishment a remark by Sir Henry Parked to come school children to the effect that a " a now of a profusion of green plants and of expanded fields of blue other, and other similar catholics objects, would sustain them in the hour of trial and temptation " This he regards as a nothing more than a modified revival of paganism It is no wonder, we road, that the IKcliool inspectors would take their tone from their masters, and that the Catholic schools would be hampered in a thousand ways I In 1867 Dr Polding expressed his dissatisfaction with the way in which the Act of 1886 was administered, and in reading this part of the Cardinals story, we find the history of the events that led up to the passing of the Public Instruction Act of 1886 from the point of view of his denomination The Act of 1866 might have allowed Catholics to hold their own, we road, though under considerable disad vant ages But complaint had to be made of the spirit in which it has administered "the Government," stud Dr Polding, while pledged to administer fairly and honourably the system of education, worse every day giving proof of a deadly hostility to the Catholic schools " In June, 1872 appeared the famous joint Pastoral of the bishops who in that document condemn the principle of secularist education with all the weight of our authority," refer to "the steady so remote way in which our denominational schools are being weakened and extinguished," and describe a system of national training from which education is finished as a system of practical paganism, which leads to corruption of morals and the loss of faith, to national forerunner and to national dishonour " Cardinal Moran tells how Dr Vaughan was denounced as a firebrand and the Bishops' words as a libel on every free Australian citizen He gives a vivid sketch of the excited feeling of the time, going on to say that the result may be summed up in a few words " In the political arena the secularists achieved an easy triumph," but " the political defeat was soon changed into an abiding moral victory which none can gainsay. Sir Henry Parkes has proved to be false prophet 'The Public Instruction Act has now been in operation for 13 years, it has not brought death to the priest's sacred calling " The Cardinal quotes Sir Henry's " Fifty Years of Australian History" against himself on the subject There is a passage in that book which says that before the Act of 1886 worn out servants were appointed by priests to the offices of teacher " JlCoidaeem reported este mernot ci i," says his Eminence, with that dexterous use of an old Latin I saw which comes BO handily to controversialists for daring 11 years before that Act came into operation, he reminds Sir Henry, all appointments were made by the Council of Education The progress of the question in the other colonies is also described in these papers. It would, however, be impossible to follow his Eminence over the whole of the fields these two volumes cover They are anoo critical, biographical, historical, and con- troversial by turns, and written in a style that is nothing if not popular, so far as the character of the subject treated will admit in the chapters relating to native missions some close observations of the manners and habits of the blacks are given in such a way as to be interesting to ethnologists, while the writer of Australian history will find here materials! to aid him in his work If some of the pages may seem calculated to revive bitter feeling which we would fain think are so rapidly disappearing as to make even comparatively recent incidents seem distant and remote until this account calls their ghosts up again, so much is perhaps a necessity of the subject As to the way in which those results of Cardinal Moran" literary labours are presented, it must be said that the bookrofloots credit on the Oceanic Publishing Company, which sends it out Clear type, gilt- edged pages of good paper, rich morocco binding, and other accessories have been employed to make the volumes presentable The whole of the work in connection with the public cation has been done in Australia, and the Jlluat-rtiion«, crawls are numerous and well' executed, reproduce many places and scenes of Roman Catholic interest, and many faces of men of the past whose names have become historic in the records of their denomination.
