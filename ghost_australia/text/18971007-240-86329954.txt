OUR ORBOST LETTER. (FnROM OUR OWN OOalRERPONDRNT.) Monday, October 4. The great question with us for the past few weeks has been that of the election for Gippsland East and who is best entitled. to the suffrage of the electors 4 There can, we think, be only one answer to that question, namely, Mr Foster, who, for the past 9 years has proved himself to be the right man in the right place. If Mr Foster stands half as high in the opinions of other portions of the electorate as he does hero there will not be the ghost of a show for Mr Conant being re turned to Parliament; this was evinced very clearly last Saturday. The business folk and other leading men of the place drove a long way on the Cuninghame road to meet the Minister of Mines, who was greeted with hearty cheers. Thie public meeting, which was held in the Orbost Mechanics' Institute, was crowded. The chair was taken by Mr J. Cameron, J.P. Councillor Cameron expressed his pleasureoat seeing Mr Foster again in our midst, and paid a high tribute to the services rendered by the heon, gentleman during his tenure of office, and said there was not a doubt in. his (chairman's) mind but what Mr Foster would be re turned. Mr Foster, on rising, was re ceived with applause. He said that it afforded him great plasure to he present that evening, and to give an account of the measures which he has been instru mental in placing on the statue book. The speech was on the same lines as that already reported in The Advertiser. At the close of the address, several questions were put and satisfactorily answered. A vote of confidence was moved by ex-Councillor J. E. Pardew, and after being seconded by Mr Jos. Forsyth, was carried unanimously. After a vote of thanks to the chairman the meeting closed. For a seat in the central riding of the Orbost shire, Mr J. Hocking has been re. elected.
