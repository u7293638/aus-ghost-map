WHAT IS PUSESYISM? The Question answered 'by Puseyites.-It is to " utterly reject and anathematize the principle of protestantism as a heresy, with all its forms, sects, or denominations. (1).;" "to hate the reformation and the reformers more and more (2) ;'" the re formation was a limb badly set, it must be broken in order to be righted (8)';" to " desire the re storation of unity with the church of Rome(4) 4" to " regard Rome as our mother, .through whom we were born to CHRIST (5)." It is to denounce the church 'of England as being "In bondage, as working in chains, and as teaching with the stammering lips of ambiguous formularies.(0);" it is to enlogise the church of Rome, as giving " free scope to the feelings of awe, mystery, tenderness, reverence, amid devoted ness'(7)," and as " having high gifts, and strong claims on our admiration, love and gratitntle(8)," and that " Rome has .been, even in her worst times, on most points, a firm and consistent wit ness, in act and word for orthodox doctrine (9)." It is to declare " Your trumpery principle about scripture being the sole rule of faith in fundamentals (I nauseate the word) is but a muti lated edition without the breadth and axiomatic character of the original (10) ;" it is to ".teach that the Romish ritual was a precious possession (11)," and that the mass-book is " a sacred and most precious monument of the apostles '(12)" It is to assert that " scripture is -not the' rule of faith (13) ;" that " the tradition of the church catholic is the legitimate interpreter of scripture (14) ;" that the bible, " placed without note or comment in the hands of uninstructed persons, is not calculated in ordinary cases, to make them wise unto salvation (15);" and that only persons "disclaiming the right of private judgment in things pertaining to God " are members of the church of Christ (16). It is to teach that " baptism, and not faith, is the primary instrument of justification (17) ;" that we ,ere not to " neglect the doctrine of justification . by works (18) ;" and that " the prevailing notion -of bringing forward thile doctrine of the atone ment, explicitly and prominently on all occasions, is evidently quite opposed to the: teaching .of scripture (19)." It is to assert that, in the Lord's supper, " the bread and wine are changed by the consecration of the priest, and tie operation of the Holy Ghost, and become the very body and very blood of our Lord (20);" that " the power of making tihe body and blood of Christ is vested in the suc cessors of the apostles (21);" and to affirm the cleansing efficacy of suffering (22). It is to declare that " she [RoM?E has in her monastic institutions, a refuge fromn the weariness and vanities of the world, and a means of higher perfection to individuals, which many sigh after, and which might be revived in a primitive form, but which as yet we have not (23)." It is to maintain the lawfulness of the prayers for the dead (24); and to assert that a person may believe that there is a purgatory ; that relies may be venerated; that saints may be invoked; that there are seven sacraments ; that the mass is an offering for the quick and dead, for the remis sion of sins; and that he may yet, with a good conscience, subscribe to the thirty-nine articles of the church of England (25) ! !! It is to put the visible church 'in the place of Christ, by teaching that " she alone is that true 'hiding- place into which the servants of God -may flee for refiuge, and be safe (26); it is to put the sacraments in the place of God, by declaring that they are" the SOURCES of divine grace (37)." 1\.

If the above principles be generally' adopted .by those who hold office in the church, and who iprofess to be the successors of suchlmen as Cran mer, Ridley, Latimer, Jewell, Kepnett, Tillotson, Burnett, Leighton, Taylor, Portems, and Heber, does it not become the duty of every enquirer after truthfor himqe~f to try those principles by the word of God? . ""To the law and to the testimony, if they speak not according to this word, it is because there ih Sno light in them."-Ianiahl viii. 20. " Take huaeds shpt ye hear,'?---Mark iv, 24.. Puseyism paving, the way to Popery, The in tolerant spirit, and cruel persecutions of the' Romish church; have for many ages filled the world with lamentation and horror ; and tho 'his tory of almost every age and every country, is stained and disfigured with the black and hideous catalogue of her infamous crimes."-Life of Claude, jrn0a II. What fbllows is extracled from the Monthly Review, February, 1816, pIage 222.-" Pope Julius in seven years was the occasion of the slaughter 'of 900,000 christians. The massacre in France cut off 100,000 in three months. P. Personias avers 'that in the persecution of the Albigenses and Waldenses, 1,000,000 lost their lives. From the beginning of the Jesuits till 1580, that is in 40 years, 900,000 perished says Balduinus. The Duke of Alva, by the hangman, put 30,000 to death. Vergerius affirms that the inquisition, in 90 years destroyed 150,000. To all this may he added the Irish rebellion, in which 300,000 were destroyed, as the Lord Ossery reports in a paper printed in the reign of Charles the 2nd. Besides all these, vast nambers have been destroyed in the subsequent persecutions in France and Piedmont, in the Palatinate and Hungary. Can this be the religion of Jesus Christ, the messenger of glad tidings? "Peace on earth, and good will to men."
