GHOSTS. Our friends from Blayney are complaining of the presence of a ghost, or some such supernatural being in thenchief mine. The men, we are told, hear strange noises, bells ringing, singing, groaning, etc. ; miners going below have their candles blown out by supernatural beings, and they feel something brush past them. Ever since the world began there have been ghosts and rumours of ghosts, but their actual existence has never been proved in a court of law. There is an old saying that where there is much smoke, there is sure to be some fire, and Hamlet, who was himself the son of a ghost, is reported to have said to a friend "There are more things in Heaven and earth, than are dreamt of in your philosophy." Very few of us believe in ghosts, but most of us have some sort of mysterious awe of the unknown possibility, and the unfortunate part of it is that it is impossible to catch ghosts, you can put a bullet through them but it does not hurt, and when grabbiug at its throat you only grab air. Some of the most reasonable and clear headed people declare they have seen ghosts, but undoubtedly the general tendency nowadays is to ridicule the whole matter, as being in existence only in a troubled mind. V\ bethel- the Full Court will ever be in a position to give a ruling on the question is doubtful, and in the meantime the ghost will remain with us.
