Madame Mirion was pacified at once. 1 We must't i'org-et,' she said, * that I*Iar jm cxite is to decide for herself.

Mirion as he patted Joseph on the beat'. ? Xolrel never speaks without (rood cause. Hi's both grateful and dis creet.' Madame Mirion wont into the garden to look for ber daughter; she found her ar ranging a basket of flowers for the dining room. Margue-ritc was not ignorant of the fact that the secret agent had returned, and I should not dare to say that she was not agitated a, little. However that might be, she turned toward her mother, saying in a sprightly way, *? Well, what news ?' Hor mother made her si^down beside h-*r t r. .-. Wnch. ' My dear child,' she said in a tr.-ir.bliug voice, ' Joseph, has returned fj\j:n \\*-i-:i is, where he iias -talked with a great 1 - y people, among others with the boitcs -? of the White Horse, a very respect able wo:iian, who is far superior -to her position. The report which he has jus: given your father and myself surpasses our expectations. In the first place, not withstanding all the tirades of your uncle Benjamin, there is an Ornis. I knew well enough tbere was, It's a beautiful village, situate in a very fertile valley, and in habited by excellent people. There you will find magnificent trees, delightful scenery, mountains, sparkling streams, a clear sky — ' ' Except when it rains,' interposed Mar guerite. ' Don't pick me up so,' answered Madame Mirion, a little nettled, ' I don't deny that it occasionally rains at Ornis. Did I say it never rained there? As regards the count, he is a real count 5 the origin of his family is lost in the night of time. His park is full of statues of Ms ancestors. One of them, James D'Ornis. was a com mander of the order of the Holy Ghost. Do you., understand, a commander ? He covered himself with glory in the crusades. He died somewhere^ — I don't remember the place, in 1693.' ' According to that,' said Marguerite, * if if; my books tell the truth, he must Lave covered herself with glory under LauiB xrv.' ' That's exactly what I told you. He was, it seems, the king's favorite, his most intimate friend. Near his statue, there's a lake, my dear, a love of a lake, surrounded by weeping willows, whose forms are mir rored in the water. It's very nice to be able to say, ' my lake.' ' ' My laleo is not mine yet.' * The caslle is superb, monumental, I may «ay,' continued Madame Mirion. ' You could make ten castles of it, if you wished.1 -&/ How about the owner of it ? Tell me somothing about him. In the first place, is he an old bachelor or a, widower ?' ' Ob '. don't think because he's a few years older tban you — ' ' A few ! a. good many it seems to me. .HI believe he's twice my age' ? What if he is ? As long as a. man is not fifty, he isn't old. What difference ?Iocs his age make, if he's young at heart ? No, my dear, be isn't a widower. A wid ower ! how ridiculous. He has been wait ing to find the wife of his dreams. He had sworn that he would never marry un less he found this idaal being ; fate caused him to meet her at Geneva.' ? ' Did the hostess of the White Horse tell Joseph all this? You frighten me. I am no such ideal being ; I don't f eellike one — but tell me, what did you hear, about Vns character P 'Oh! he's such a man. How can I describe him. The whole village is full of I116 goodness and generosity. This very year he gave the people a fountain and a laundry. Some of the stories told about him would bring tears to your eyes. He had a friend, the Mar quis de BaouXjWho was accidentally killed. He fell from a bridge. How can. I tell you about Count D'Ornis — He couldn't rest until the murderer 'was caught and punished.' * What murderer r I thought the marquis fell from a bridge.' ' How you confuse me with your inter ruptions ! I meant, until he had destroyed the bridge that caused his friend's death. At any rate, that's -what Noirel told. -us. But that's nothing to what followed. He shut himself up in the house for eighteen months, and -wouldn't eat or drink ? ' 'Eighteen months without eating,' in-' terrupted Marguerite again. ' I dont be lieve that the commander of the Holy Ghost even: — ' c Oh ! how you pick me up ! I didn't say thai he age nothing at all ; but|that he ate bo little that any one else in his place would have starved. I want to know if a man who loves hie friends like that, wouldn's love his wife and make her happy.' ' Perhaps so,' answered Marguerite ; * only, it he waited for her fall from a bridge — ' ' You must stop this trifling ; it's en tirely out of place.' ' Please don't cet angry- I only iudee, from what little I know of Count d'Ornis, that he is not as tender-hearted as you think.' c The ' idea of a young girl like you knowing anything about such matters ! At your age yau can't understand how the 'warmest hearts hide their feelings by an appearance of coldness and indifference. Count D'Ornis takes after his mother. She is a very respectable lady, but it seems that she, too, is cold and sedate. What do you suppose she was doing when Noirel saw her ? She -was preparing a surprise for her son. She had noticed that the hang- ? ings of their drawing-room were a little faded, so she had sent for an upholsterer, and -was having new ones put up. Nothing was good enough for her dear son. Just imagine this countess, this real countess, doing this ! That's the way the] D'Ornis understand domestic life ! There ! I've told you everything I could think of, both for and against this proposition ; now you must decide.' ? * What ! this moment ?' cried Marguerite, ?who was becoming frightened. * Yes, this very moment. There isn't a minute to lose ; your father must sent an answer to-night.' ' Please let me talk with Joseph about it first.' „ ' What ! talk with Joseph !' interrupted Madame Mirion, growing red with indigna tion. , During the last half hour she had taken a spite against Noirel. * Talk with Joseph! your father's ?workman! — If I thought that 'you would presume to ask ..;'-.- - that he would give it you, he — ? ., i' r'lis Chouse another four and-twenty lir-.iv.--.1 Marguerite w^.e silent for a moment. She was twisting- a jasmine branch in her hands, and the poor flower was suf£ering sadly. ' What would you think if I should say no ?' she replied at last in a low voice. Madame Mirion started to her feet as though pushed up by a spring. ' If you should say no,' she cried, giving her daughter a terrible look, ' you would be guilty of ingratitude toward God. Have you not seen the workings of bis hand in what has happened here during the last fortnight ? Have you not seen that pro vidence, by an atonishiag and miraculous dsspensation, has wished to make us all happy, to recompense us for all the care we have taken with your education, and for your poor father's forty years of honest; toil ? If you should say no, you would no longer be my daughter, and God -would1 no longer keep you under his protecting care.' }£ Like King William of Prussia, Madame Mirion had a. bad habit of mixing God up ?with matters that he eared nothing for ; it is true it was her particular God, and not the God of commonsense. Sho also resembled the King of Prussia in being exceedingly obstinate 5 she never raised a siege until the place surrendered. At last Marguerite, tired of war, said to her, * Well, you can decide for me 5 I'll do ?whatever you wish. .~. Then she threw herself upon her daugh ter's neck, and pressed her to her heart, calling . her her treasure, her angel, her darling child 5 after which she hurried away to find M. Mirion, whom she also embraced, saving to Mm, ' I've left her free, entirely free, to decide for herself. She says yes, but the poor child is so agi tated, that it's best not to speak to her. Don't eay a word, but run your letter over ia your head. You can't take too much pains with it.1 , £,. (TO BE COSTrNTTED.)
