INSCRIPTION FOR THE CELLAR OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, Where William Smith O'Brien, the Martyr, was im- mured four months. [BY SOUTHEY'S GHOST.] For many days, secluded from the House, Here Smith O'Brien lingered. Oft these walls Echoed his groans; as with his heavy chain He clanked about the Cellar. Not to him Did Bentic's eloquence, or Sibthorpe's wit, Or Dublin's Bay, or Allen's Bog exist; Save when yon door, ajar, for some half minute, Reveal'd it passing. Dost thou ask his crime? He kicked at the Committee, and refused To sit upon the Railways. For his mind Shap'd a bright scheme of happiness to Celts, And death to all the Saxons. Fairy dream! Yet such as Head Pacificators love: Such as, with pure, disinterested zeal, DANIEL pretends to worship. Blessed hope! Awhile denied us; but, ere long, shall come Repeal, the Saxon Heptarchy, and all!
