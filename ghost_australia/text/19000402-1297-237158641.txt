CHAMBERLAIN ON TIIE BRAIN. Addressing a meeting in Manchester on Wed nesday night, Mr. Augustino BIrrell counselled tho people not to get Mr. Chamberlain too much on tbe brain. "Politics," tho lion, member ob served. "aro not mad© out cf personalities, and this 'Chamberlain on the brain' in my opinion, is not only a disease, but it is what I should call I a childish disease — one of the di eascs of child- j hood, rather than of mature old age. I wish there j were any means of Inoculating the Liberal popu lation against it. Do not let us exaggerate either j the good or the had In Mr. Chamberlain. He j caunot dotnlnato the policy of this country. No i man can do that. And after all, lu a few short j years, Mr. Chamberlain, like Alexander the Great, I Xerxes, and Darius, will' have disappeared, even j as we shall all of us, into tho world of ghosts. But South Africa will remain and the English in j South Africa and the Dutch and the Kaffirs will j remain. Therefore the problem we are called \ upon to settle ought to be lookqd nt wholly irro- j spective of Mr. Chamberlain. He Is but a licet inff i shadow, tho Incident cf the hour. Let us look ! the facts in tbo face for ourselves, make up our minds, not animated by personal likes or dislikes. There is too much of that in politics."
