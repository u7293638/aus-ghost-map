AN AWFUL GRIME, JUA3TS SLAYER. An awful crime had been committed at Ortiz. The wealthy Juan Perea, he whom everybody liked, had bean found dead at his own door. Where was the murderer, and who could he be that would kill such a good old man and rob him too? That was the worst of it. There was no clue by which they could work, and the officers who came up from Guaymas went home again at the end of the week, weary of their useless task. The good padre, who buried the mur dered man out in the desolate grave yard of sand and cactus, where the sun was so hot it cracked all the wooden crosses, said a prayer that the villain might be brought to justice. But he had little hope that he would be. 'He has disappeared so completely the devil must be protecting him,' said the old woman, as they filed out through a broken space in the crumbling wall that did duty as a gate. ' Poor old Juan is dead, and he who murdered htm is en joying the blood stained gold he took from his pockets,' is what they thought as they slowly walked home after the last sad words had been said. They passed the house where the dead man had lived for so many years, and shuddered when they saw the dark spot on the ground— stained with toe blood of Juan that flowed from the ghastly knife-wound hi his back. Far away from. Ortiz, in a beautiful village of the Sierra Madre, a young man had bean trying for weeks to forget something — trying to convince himself that he had not committed a great crime. He had plenty of gold and the love of a beautiful maiden if he could only for get — yes, forget that he had killed his father. He could forget it if it was not for that strange whirring sound like the flapping- of wings that constantly haunted him. He first heard it just as he struck the f atel blow, and since then it has never ceased day or night. What was that? Surely not the wind. And, if it was not, why should Leon-urd Perea be afraid of a sound he who had faced wild beasts and fought Indians ? But he turned over in bed and pulled the clothes over his head to keep away the sound — that awful sound that first whirred like a fiock of pigeons, and then died away like an infant's waiL ' I'm sure it has nothing to do with the killing of the old man/' said Leon ard to himself , but somehow the whole scene would come up before him. Again he was riding along the road to see the father he had deserted years ago. He was not going because he wanted'tosee the good old man, but because he wanted money. Money he must have at any cost. It was long past midnight when he knocked at the door, and his father came out to greet him. Leonard remembers distinctly, and when lie asked for money took out a bag and gave him a good quantity of gold. Bat it was not enough— he must have it all. It was such an easy thing to do. Only a thrust with the knife as the old man turned to go into the house after bidding him farewell, and the gold was his. But what was that whirling sound ? The village was in darkness, bnt it followed I»im as he sped down the street to his horse, and kept near him as he flew over the coun try, farther and farther away from his crime. No, he never got away from it. The sound was always with him. Ugh! There it was again, and Leonard pulled the blankets over his head. Morning came but the whirring sound came with it. At night it was nearer than in the day-time, but it never ceased. 'I won't pay any attention to it to day,' said Leonard to himself as he went for his breakfast. ' I am sure it nothing, and has nothing to do with me.' It was a beautiful day, and the sun had nearly reached the zenith. Leonard threw himself down on the ground in the shade of a tree to get a little sleep that he had been deprived of in the night, bat had scarcely closed his eyes — 'Whir— flap, flap — whir.' 'Ugh.' 'Whir. Flap.' Leonard felt a cold breeze fan his cheek as he jumped to his feet, but there was nothing near him. He was alone. By night Leonard's brain was in a whirL The sound was everywhere. Surely it was bis father's ghost. Angels had wings, and the old man's spirit must be passing through the room. 'Let me out of this. I don't want the gold,' and Leonard flung the yellow bag of coin out of the window. Over the hills and mountains he sped, he knew not where. But the sound was with him. Again he was in the street before his father's house. Oh, if the old man were only alive, he could surelyprevent the terrible sound ! Somebody was coming, bat Leonard hid in a Bhadow until they passed. ' Anyhow, they don't know I did it,' he thought. ' Whir, -whir-flap, flap.' This time it was closer than it had been before. Sorely that was a dark form flying through the air. ' I'm not a bit f tightened,' the murderer thought, trembling in every limb. The dark form in the air drew nearer and nearer, and the flapping, whirring sound was fast and furious. 'Keep away, fiends!'' yelled Leonard, and he thought he saw a dark, wicked form with cloven foot and spiked taiL He covered his face with his hands and screamed in agony. Tha dark form came nearer. ' Mercy, mercy!'' he howled. 'Awful forms of darkness keep away! It was not I who killed him!' The flap, ping and whirring were close to him, and Leonard could see a pair of dark wings spread as if to enfold him. Be struck out with his hand and struggled wildly, but the wings came closer and closer. He felt claws scratching- his face and heard wings beating the air. Surely the devil had him. A pain shot through his eyes, every thing grew black, and it seemed as if the flames of hell were seething round him. He ceased struggling, and lay still in death. The next morning the people of Ortiz fonnk him lying in the same spot where his father's dead body had been discovered. The people were almost crazy with fear. The old padre shook his head and crossed himself. It was while they were carrying the body into the house that old Manuel noticed poor Julian's pet black eagle, that had been missing ^ince he was killed, sitting on a wall near by. His feathers were torn and ragged, and he seemed interested in what was going on. But of course the eagle had nothing to do with the death of Leonard — at least; that is what the padre said.
