ALBURY TO MELBOURNE. (BF " TELEMACHUS " IN THE ABGUS) It was here at Albury that the very earliest overlanders crossed to Australia Felix, having travelled from Lake George to the Murrnmbidgee, and thence to the impracticable Alps, along whose northern spurs they made west till the fairly open country was reached, and it seemed possible to make some progress through the country beyond the big river. On a grassy flat not far down from the railway bridge is—or was, for surely bo precious a relic has been well gasrded—the explorers' marked tree. Marked but 64 years ago, well within the period of memory of any man of patrlaichal age, yet the farthest point then reached in the great Australian wilderness, the first Murray station on the great overland line. It seems now almost an act ot cruelty to have robbed the first explorer and overland carrier of his right ol nomenclature here, to have taken his name from the great river, as the escutcheon of an unworthy knight from a castle port. The great river might well have been the Hume for ever, for 'tis a name of many noble associations, new and old. It was here that the spirit of prophecy used to descend on Sir Hercules Robinson in the days before he did so much to consolidate South Africa, and then went home with hazy views, or it may be views hazily expressed, about the unity and integrity of the Empire. This was the federal city of that masterful old Governor, wherein he expected some day to see an Australian Parliament assemble. Is it all proven a drsam 1 Who can say ? At least we do not hear of the laying of tbe foundation of any federal hall. And be does not look like federation, that gold-banded official who stands amongst the baggage yonder. But we shail see him soon enough. Let us, if we have but two hours, take a look at Albury as she is, ringed in by her h'lls, belted with her river, overshadowed with her trees, and garlanded with her innumerable flowers. There seems indeed to be a green bill at every street end, and a garden about every house, and the flowers are choicer and richer and earlier and later than in ordinary gardens of Melbourne. For in the bijou et< closure of tbe curator of the Athenreum were camellias just come to perfection, and it was in October ; rhododendrons juBt bursting the leafy sheaths of their budB, azaleas in full display, all standing side by side. The wistaria and tbe lilac were abundant and rich, Bnd the roses were opening their hearts. But the vines on the hills were aot yet in leaf. And it is only when tbe vines are all aleaf and abloom that Albury it at her best. The Albary country was made for the vine. A little way above the town the mountain's feet Iobb their rugged character, braes and breasts take the place of cliffs and scaurs, and bosky dells and grassy glades of wild gorges and ravines. The face of nature becomes gentie, her temperature genial, her retnrn to human effort prolific and kind. By hundreds of acres the vineyards about the town and district may be counted now, and yet through how many years did they languish ! What effort was required to force their prodace on the market, and what an mple meed of fame is due to those who gave the labour of their lives not to prodace wine only but to force it on the world. The name of Fallon occurs to us all in connection with Albury, and I remember a very well aged representative of that name yielding up the ghost in peace and quietness at tbe little watering place of Manly Beach, by Sydney, some seven or eight years ago. He had lived quiet life there for some years, and seemed to have but little interest in anything beyond tbe vines. Of tbem and their products he was lull of memories. I remember when the first talk of phylloxera occarred his description of true phylloxera-smitten vineyard in France. It was like the mallee scrub just recovering from a great fire—a puny Bboot here and there, perhaps, but not a sign of a grape." His conclusion also, was hopeful as reason' able. " If it is phylloxera we have got here, then phylloxera does not like Australia." Others co-operated with and followed the Fa lions. The industry is all too vast to be managed by any one man or one firm now. The green hill yonder is tunnelled with cellarage, where the crushed juice matures and mellows in tbe long tiers of gigantic vats, wherein is re-born, and with rarer delicacy, the aroma which every breeze wafts into the city when all the vines on tbe hills are abloom. Who can say how far these tunnels may or may not be bored? Australia is brorder than France. Albury has a site at least equal to Rheims, and may yet give direct and accepted contradiction to the old German quatrain— " At Bacberteh on the Bheln, At Hochelm on tbe Haln, And at Wurzburg on the Stein, Grow tbe three best kinds ot wine.'* Foolish Deutsche, why each hurry ? Albary lies on Murray. Yarra won the Raiser's prize, Goulburn juice with Neckar vies. Wurzbare, cease thy impious boast Of tbe blessed wine of the Holy Ghost " Anstral M spirit purely drawn Blcsseth all it breathes upon. Yet not for its wines only should Albury be famed. Rich and broad down the river lie many fertile areas, and broadening away on either bank are plains and wolds which have bred farmers at times of a Caliiornian or Canadian breadth of ambition. It was but a three hours' ridt-, I think, from the greatest farm I ever saw in Australia—that of tbe Messrs. Burrows, of Bnrrumbuttock—into Albury. Thousands ot acres of green wheat were waving then on one estate seven or eight years ago. I do not_ know if they were sent back into sheep again by the foolish menace of protection in Victoria, but I do think that in this momentary glimpse, as in more extended travel years ago, one traces the effects of that Victorian blight all over this fair country—every grape and grain and fleece and hoof of which would come to our stores, markets, factories, if we had but the wisdom to clear the way. And now not even a grape can cross. I once saw a lady despoiled of philling bag of froit she was taking into a Victorian railway carriage. Let us get away for a moment, however, from all these littlenesses. This Albury is, and is destined to be, the first (the furthest up, I mean) commercial town on the Murray. Away below will roll the vineyards and the •oliveyards, the orchards and the mulberry gardens. (Yes, it waR not very far below that the late Mrs. Bladen-Neil ventured on her illtimed and not very well supported enterprise.) And with, or intermingled with them, the rich pastures and the waving corn-Gelds, which byand-by will be permanently typical of Australia. But above, the scene changes abruptly, becomes grandly, boldly, wildly picturesque. The feet of the mountains begin to tread close, and more closely, on the banks of the river. Little jutting promontories appear, and islands in the stream's centre. Mr. Piguenit—a Tasinanian artist not so well known in Victoria as he onght to be—painted a grand picture of "The Murray Above Albury." But it is higher up still that the great picture*, the magnificent scenes appear—when the Father of Australian Waters, gathering the forces of bis fountain-heads of almost eternal snows, thunders down to his mountain gates through a ravine which has well been described as one of the great gorges of the world. There is vented the great voice ot the flood, whose mightier volume rolls almost in silence past the Federal City, and in timep to come, in and about those mountain heights will be bred a race of men who will be to our Albury folk as the mountaineers of the Tyrol to the dwellers in the valley of the Po. Do you doubt that these characteristics will form by-and-by t If so, j ust look for a moment at the well-formed characteristics of the peoples of the two colonies meeting at the federal station. Note them as they pass the baggage heap in charge of the Customs man. The New South Welsher drops his head with a look of quiet scorn and disgust, aB well he may. The Victorian (ot the average) uptilts his nasal organ and strokes his chin as with the air of one who should say—" But I do not perceive the offence of it at all." If the people of the two colonies should travel much, and the fiscal policies should remain unaltered, these rival attitudes would affect permanently the shape of the nasal organs, and of the general bodily carriage. A story is told in the days of the rival Premiers of New South Wales, Sir John and Sir Henry to wit, there grew in political eircles two very distinct and well-marked sets of noses; you might, indeed, tell a man's party leanings by his noBe. For the nose of Sir John was aquiline, and his habit and manner were such as to render it ever more so. If he walked by the Circular Quay and inbaled the odours which arose from the sewage discharges, he bent down for a yet deeper and stronger sniff, and greeted it with deeper and stronger language. But if such a presence in the air was remarked to Sir Henry his back arched, and his nose elevated still more while he answered—"To some people such an odour might arise, but not to toe." And in the House, when some member blasphemed against the gospel according to St. John, be bent his nose, and hie body, and his soul to the inhalation of that blasphemy, and then, in true aquiline fashion, came down ,tn the body and the soul of the vile blasphemer. But Sir Henry, just the other way, drew .Mmself up, and let it pass by. " If it is not for m<*, it is against me, and therefore contemptib'e." So the noses grew, and the parties, and the parties' noses. And here we are with our baggage. " Open that!" is the order ; and immediately it is opened. " That'll do." Nine-tenths of it a farce, and the whole rude and uncouth. But we get used to it. A little matter, however, somewhat new end strange, vexed me on that homeward journey. Going down my ticket had passed the vhflto journey right enough. Stepping out at Albury returning, the guard mulcted me of a portion, so that now unconsciously I possessed but that remnant which guaranteed transit from Wodonga to Melbourne— the Victorian portion, in short. And this, after the bell had rung, the porter refused to accept. " You must get a separate ticket from ALbury to Wodonga." But I can't. I shall miss the train." " I tell you, you can't travel without it." "But I will." "Then you'll be under a penalty. Trouble you for name and address." " Oh, hang it Can't you get it ?" "Yes; certainly." How much ?" " Dunno." IITwo shillings dot" 'Yes. Give you the change next time. There she goes. You're off. Good-bye." It was the first time I had ecjoyed that little experience, but I have heard ot it from others, 8nd do not know whether to qualify it as fraudulent or inane. Probably the average porter, however, would describe it as an excuttingly sensible and weU- coatidered arrange' ment. "Fine gettin' 'em on the hop, you know." And yet another matter about which I heard a little growling, though to me it was fair cause for thanksgiving, was the long delay at Albury of the morning ordinary or mail train. We waited two hours and a quarter, which certainly is far too long for the convenience or the patience of the ordinary traveller. The exigencies of the department may require it. I said eo to a fellow-traveller who had walked the platform and tried all its resting-places whik I ranged about the town. I regret to say his reply was illogical as rude—" Exigencies of the department be ." I myself thought that way about my border ticket, and lost two shillings. But we must live in hope of a change for the better in these as in other mate-s. Hope deferred, however, makes the heart sick, and indigestible food tbe stomacb, and most of us who have fed frequently at Seymour are familiar with both pangs. The natural gate of another of the great gardens of Australia, into which should be for ever flowing all that is signified by the metaphorical milk and honey, and yet a place where the soup is of the thinnest, the meat of the coarsest, the butter oily or rancid, tbe salad stale, and the charge eighteenpence. Tbat eighteenpence if tbe secret of the whole matter, probably. It is a foolish, unreasonable, levelling, communistic charge. Why should a man expect to dine on a railway station for less than in town ? Why should you charge tbe second-class man more and the first-class man less than his average; and why should all be forced to " grub together ?" We will not press this matter, as it is understood that " the Commis- sioners contemplate new arrangements in connection with the refreshment rooms." On this, however, as on mauy previous occasions, the one gentleman ot all others on tbe Victorian railways who seemed to me to require "sorting" (in the Doric sense) is the luggage-room clerk. I promised to put a bag away for a man who had to catch a train. At the counter were five people already waiting, one attendant writing at a desk, two others fooling around. " Say, stranger," said a gentleman with an accent, to one of these, " I've spelled five minutes, and am gettin' fresh." Well, take yer time." " I've took it all, and gettin' into debt." "Oh, well, that'll keep." And he fooled along as heretofore. I waited eight minutes for the fifth turn.
