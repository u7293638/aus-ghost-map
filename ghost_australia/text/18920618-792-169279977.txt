The fairies—"the good people," as they were gfenially Milled—do not live in the mind of the Irish peasant &s; thev did in the days when I %as a boy. but still the Irish i peasant finds the kii tigdotn of the ghosts easily ripped open 1 for him—I am adapting a phrase of Schiller's in the " Maid of Orleans." The old-fashioned wake is disappearing from most parts of Ireland. Ttie wake was still a great popular institution in my time. When a man or woman died, all the friends of the family were expected to KKOF INTO THE WAKE. It would have b««n thought a terrible thing if either the dead or the bereaved family had been left alone through the dreary watches of the night. So the friends and neighbours gathered in, and endeavoured to keep up the spirits of the family with consoling words to begin with, and then with encouraging anecdotes intended to divert attention away from the sad conditions, and finally with jokes and comic songs. I remember beie$ pcese&t; at oae of those ceremonials, wheat a visitor, s woman, accosted the mother of a girl who was lying dead in the room and offered her congratulations, no dottbt perfectly sincere, on the cross ^ t T ^ T h t r S ^ S was asked and consented to favour the company with a comic song. Xet by any means inoredible to ^ the story of the attendant at a wake who begged to be allowed to call nron the gentleman sitting next to the coShx for a comic song. I have seen love-mikiag. courtship, and a very harmless kind of romping going on at soate of these country wakes when I was a hoy. The feeling of grief for the loss of the dead was sincere and intense, but it seemed CW»KSU1 WITH TBS IRISH NiTCBE to endeavour to shake it off, to put a hold front npon it, and to show as much attention ana civility to the guests as though nothing particular had happened. * My son is dead, my daughter is dead, tm*. bat my guest is entitled to my hospitality all the same." The Irish peasant seems to me to give many proofs of his southern origin. He loves the open air in a country where rain » almost habitual; he seems to have carried into the new home, whatever its differences of climate, all the habitudes of the home of his ancestors. He finds the riv«rs and the hills and the woods still peopled with graeefal or gruesome phantom foms. He hears voices in the mur» msriags of _ the streams, and in the sigh of tfeTa^ht wind—voices distinct and articulate, — — thoagh v they speak » in tones tkat cocaefrom the vague land "east of the s*a and west of the moon." The sottthera love of music dings to hiaa. "When foe any purpose he and his Sweats are organised, he is nothing withwtt a hand. £ can remember well how ia the farveff days Fr.

He rose and smiled his sweet, winning smile, and deolared that he liked so much the air they had just been listening to that, for his part, he would prefer to hear that, and nothing but that, for the whole e V DhsrPr. j£athew! How lie won the hearts of that orchestra; how he softened away all difficulties and relieved all distressed minds! The band was made up of verj young men; it had been practising but a short time, and rose to the performance of only one single air. Fr. Mathew had guessed this almost from the first) and made things pleasant for everyone; In the O'Connell movement! too, the band played an important part j and in the days of Young Ireland, days which I remember tnore clearly, all the towns and villages of Ireland btoke into " The Wearing of the Green," and "Who Fears to Speak of Ninety-eight P' I do not think the Irish villagers have so much music now—although, of oourse, there is no National meeting held which is not attended and played to by all the bands from every part of the surrounding country. What I meant was that I doubt whether the ordinary Irish village echoes of summer evenings so much to the music of the flute ana the clarionet as it used to do in the dear, romantic days of 184$. The bagpipe, I fear, has nearly gone—the instrument of which Irish skill loved to assert itself as much as on the national harp. Nothing can be a greater mistake than the idea common in England and other countries that the Irish peasant is a tremendous drinker of whisky. Poor fellow! I wonder where be would get the money to pay for very frequent drinks of the national beverage, as it is called. Of course, the neighbourhood faction fights have long since oeased to rage. They were going on still in various parts of the country in my earliest days, just as the duel was still not altogether unknown among the gentry of the time. I knew when I was a boy two or three men still not old who had fought duels, one of them had killed his man. In the same way the faction fights were still a sort of reality. One never hears of them now. THERE ARE MANY BEA8OK8 given for this improvement in the ways of the modern Irish peasant. He is growing civilised, people say. No doubt he is, but civilisation works through various channels and by means of various influences. I venture to suggest that (me civilising influenoe on the Irish peasant has been the influence of politics. No doubt to some people this will seem a paradox. I am convinced that it is a truth. Since the days of O'Connell, the Irish asant has been an ardent politician. S e has taken the deepest interest in all that concerns the legislation for Ireland. He is eager about eleotions and public meetings; he walks miles and miles to attend some out-of-door demonstration on Sunday. He has no time to trouble himself about parochial and family feuds. Now at last he has his vote, as well as his landlord, and he can give it in perfect freedom and security; and he throws his soul into whatever popular struggle is going on. I do not say that under the exciting stimulus of an eleotion he does not THE occasionally BLACKTHORN use A8 AN AHGTJAIENT. I wish he never did, but I have sometimes seen him do it. Still, elections are exciting things everywhere, and I for myself have seen far worse rioting in England than I ever saw in Ireland. That, however, is not the point to which I wish to direot attention. My object is to show that the National oanse has killed off the paroohial or family quarrels. I do not believe there is a man in the civilised world who takes a deeper and more impassioned interest in politics than the Irish peasant of the present day. Perhaps this is one reason why he is so unlike the man of the same class whom Lever and Lover drew. In those days the Irish peasant had little more to do with political affairs than the cow or the pig. Political affairs were the business of his betters, and not of him. He had to throw his energies into the faction fight, and he had nothing to turn his national humour into seriousness. He was free to be merry with the thoughtless merriment of the slave on a South Carolina estate in the plantation days. At the time of the Clare eleotion the great Sir Robert Peel himself acknowledged that the fervour of poUtical exeitemettt" inspired the serf of Qare with the resolution and energy of a freeman" The days of Micky Free were gone from that nour.
