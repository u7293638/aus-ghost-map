HOW OUR ANCESTORS OUTWITTED^ THE GHOSTS s " PHIMITIVE men knew bow to outW/t tb'e jhost. For example, a ghost can only find his way..back to tbe bouse bytthe way bv which he left it. This little weakne'sir did: net escape the vigilance of our ancestors/ end they took tbeir, measure accordingly: Xfte coftn was csrried out ol tbe bouse, not' by the door, bu>. by a bole made f'>r tho purpose in the wall, and khisi. hole was caroful ^y stopped up as soon aslthe hody had beeli passed through it; so that when the ghost strolled quietly back from the grave, he found to his surprise that."there -was *lo.. througbfa'P. The 'credit ^f this irjjgeniouB device is ehared equsiily" by Gf<" onlBndeW, Hottentots, BecbuanaS,S^qjoieds, Oj'bwayB, A'gouquins, Lioeiaos, Hindoos, TbibHtnns, Siamese, Chinese, and F«ej-oanp., Tbrsf special openings, or" duora *of- the jdead," are still to be seen in a vi'lage near Amsterdam, and they "were common to some towns of central Ttalyi'aVPerugal and Afaiei. A trace of the same custom survive in 'Ihu ingen, where it was 'bought that the ghoet of a man who bad been haognd wonld return to the house if the body bu.not^Hkeb out by u window instead nfthn d mr. The SiameBe, not content with carrjing tbe dead man out by a special opening endeavour to make assurancedouhly surety htirKying+iim' three times round the bSuse 1it*all speed 1 —E" proceeding well calculated to ,bewilder the poor soul in 'he coffin The Araucanixns adopt th - plan of strewing asbeB behind the coffin as it is being b iron to the grave, in.hope tbat tbe gboBt may not be able "to .find' bis way bock. Tlis very general "practice r of closing 11,e eyes uf the dead nppoars tu have originated with a nitnilar otject; it was a mode of blindfolding the dead, tbat ho 'might not see tbo way by which he was carried to bis last bmne.
