Pment Stay of-SoeiattsHPartte in Europe. Bv L. ABGHIL0TTE. Could the Socialist electoral forces which have already been brought into action in Europe be maaeed in Germany and the three Scandioftvian TfingdoroB, replacing their camvalent of anti-Socialists, they would form the majority of voters in a dominion extending from the Arctic Ocean to the Alps and the Rhine to the Vistula. A minimum t»lt of rather mote than four and ft-quarter millions would be required for this purpo *b, and the following votes (in round numbers) have ftlreaTJjrbeefc ob tained :— Germany, 1,787,000} France, 1,200,000; Austria, 780,009; Belgium, 470,000 ; Italy, 134,S00 ; Britain, !-5,000 (strictly Socialist) ; Servia, 45,000 ; Switzer land, 36,503; Denmark, 26,000; Spain, 15,000. Total, 4,519,000. U addition to which Sweden, Greece, Roumania, and Bulgaria have-xontiibuted — substantial . figures to our recdrds. la four reepactB our total of male adults is most inadequately shown by the above statistics: ___/ 1\. Restricted suffrage. 2\. tTncontestecl seats. c&k;, L%pse of time 6ince last elections. 4\. Government pressure. The latter, a moslFpofcent anti-Sooialisb agency in France, Ausfcria,__Italy, and the smaller southern countries, represents a ? latent Socialist vote which there are no means of dealing with mathematically, but the number involved in the other three depreciati ve circumstances can be estimated on very trustworthy principles. , ? As to the franchise, male adults number, roughly speaking, 1 in 4 of the general population. There are about 4 persons to every elector in France and Switzerland, and the following numbers elsewhere: Germany from 4^ to 5 ; Britain 6 1/10 ; Denmark, 6g ; Austria, from 4^ to 5 (Urn versa! Suffrage College); Belgium, ^ to 5 £Italy, 12. If these countries had their franchise levelled up to the 1 in 4 ratio, the ] following increased Socialist votes should I reasonably be expected; Germany 2 120,000, Auetria 890,000, Belgium 5G8.000, Italy 403,000, Britain 84,000, Denmark 43,000. Tim total tor the ten countries enumerated above then becomes 5,400,000 Taking the corrected figures &fi; the new basis, the Socialist Parsy should w-xt be credited wifch*& niiuitnum estimate of the polling strength in constituencies not yot ejntested. lo 1895 a g«neraHf»tion w«5 made from the British XX.P, votes ; the unpulled seats Haeing—astsifnard » tduoed figures proportionate to their population engaged in manufacturing and distributive industries. 'Ifo was held that the average poll would have been at least half of fcbat obtained in toe tested, on *-. Oo the Coa tiuent it may be assumed that tho big centres have been actually attached to a much larger extent than in Britain, and also that the manufacturing claseea are not so numerous, proportionately to population, as in the latter cmxnity, \ Oa the other hand, increasing kindness is being tshowa to phe mpveiaeno by the agricultural popu lation. Tofiisarai criticism, ho wover, let 4heuncon tested -Continental .places be reckoned at one-fifth of the-- S-^cialbt- strength which their neighbours have at tained to. Germany and the Universal Suffrage College of Austria are the on'y two fields in which practically complete candidatures have been set up. Theot^er countries require the following infreaaes on the basis just stated : Italy out-Bovenih -57,OO0), BJgtam one-twentyfifth (22 000), Fmnee about one-fourth (300,000), Ssvi' mx* laud four-fifths (29,000), Spain a fourfold a-idifciou (00,000) British Socialism, on the BRpftirate frasia already ivxplainftri Phnnlri tw multiplied ten times -800,O90), In this manner our general total has w* reached 6,325,000. The most fascinating stage of this invests gatiou is, without a doubt, thecoiieidtra tionof thVprogress made by ihTmoyement in ©very country. Up to this print the calculations have been made ou the !a?6 general elections, the chief pair of which t-30k place go long ago m 1893. Asthere is no iudiestion of a slump in Socialism in any region of Europe, and almost every by election improves on its antecedents, a oonaWerable allowance to the good must be mWULtlDU *V VUO f?***-WJ *»* WI9S1D UMVUVkUUl Same portion -rf the growth shown by the following figures is due to increased candi datures, a factthat r witt be taken into account. Oo the ettar baud Socialists have rarely as yet ftppmached a unanimous vote, so fchat there is no serious population barrier to the ra^e of progress being main tained. Grerm»ny.~The Socialist poll increased from 311,981 in 1881 to l,7«i,738 in 1893. The average annual Increases shown by the four general electione were 20, 11, 20, And l0 per ©eat respectively, II we reckon the later prtgrees at oaly 5 per cent, the Crer«iaQ hoe* *h*ild now be 2,170,000 strong, or with an improved suffrage tMm ^ .,... ? ? .. Fm»ee,--Here tbo party epracg from 00,000 Id 1889 to something like a million in 1893} but it should be remembered that Boulangism scored 730,000 tm the former year, It would be unsafe to tnake a$aneral percentage addition; therefore, although welcome news is constantly arriving from isolated seats of war j and the estimate shall b& left «ft 1,500,000. Tk& Austrian party »*__«& ii» maiden Parliament and otters no previous com parisonimts gigantic first general battle ^ 830*000 votes will be sufficient to go on with for the present. Alter the Belgian general election of 1894 { 850,000 votee) half of tho people were record. Alter deducting fre^blsHfought) divisions the annual increase shown was about 40 per cent. ^Vtth a general adult male suffrage 1,000,000 votes should be obtained by i-he parry. ? The Italian progress was from 70V350 in 1895 to t34,S02 tb 1S97. Of the 140 divi sions contested in both years thrcequarters gave splendid increases, Italian Socialist male adults should number at least 460,000. start made in 1895, two of our by 'Contests have~occurred oa untried ground and the third was in » double-vote constituency, so that the rate of progress cannot be told. -The- decline of the Xiberal Party must certainly assist our advance. Switzerland, which is a sort of Britain girt by mountaios instead of water and otherwise not unlike the island ghost- walk of Liberalietn, gave u« 13;600-in 1890, 29,822 in 1893, and 30,4(-S in 189G— the latter indicating about 10 per cent per annum increase, for candidatures were slightly fewer. Our probable strength here is quite 70,000. Denmark scored 5390 in 1884, 17,000 in 1892, and 26,000 in 1395, and should now be credited with 33,000 Socialist votes on the present suffrage basis ; or 55,000 on a goad one. Spain,. with 5000 in 1890, 7000 in 1893, 15,000 in 1896, may perhaps be credited with 80,000 Socialist votes for the whole country. The grand total, still for the ten countries only, now touches 7,516,000. How many men, Women, and children would be involved in an exodus such as, some time ago, the Kaiser invited his Socialist subjects to undertake is found by multiplication of the last figures above by 4, the result being more than 30,000,000. Holland's Socialist population, as yet uncounted, should be at least half a million ; Norway and Sweden, Greece, Portugal, Boumaoia, and Bulgaria must add quite as many again; and thus one arrives at a final estimate of mote than 31,000,000. The corresponding entire population being about 240.000,000 it may be asserted that Sacialum accounts fur at least one in eight of the people of constitutional Earope. This pro portion is largely increased if the voting ?part uf lh*s eifcc&orateis; alone considered. In Italy, for instance, rarely more than half tho electors make use of the vote. No attempt has been made at a valu^tnou of our Rasiiiau forces, the only data con sisting or partial strikes. If the fiaal Socialist total arrived at sounds exaggerated, let it be remembered that far more' than half the number has been vtrifiod by actual eieotione — for the four and a-balf million proven i.Sooiali^t voters cannot represent less than 18,000,000 people. The process of calciilaiiou has been explained, and the result will probably pass -unchallenged by^ any fi^ii w»t.fiorl nf computation. ;.Ji!|Hii!t r § ^. -* ? f— Bwesujj? § E 1 : **|| HI | ^1^ * r i ell^1 1 ? . „ _ _„. ?

Dickens. Okb night Sarah Bernhardt was playing ' Fedora ' to a crowded house. The poison scene, as usual, elicited a tempest of ap plause from the audience ; but ere the clapping of hands and the stamping of feet had completely died away, loud psals of laughter burst forth from the upper part of the theatre. The sober- minded people in the boxes and stalls gazed reproachfully at the boisteroue ' gods ' ; but in a moment they, too, began to laugh, for in the front row of the balcony, and in full view of all, stood two one-armed men, who, unconscious of the amusement which they caused, were energetically co- operating to prolong the applause by clapping their remaining hands together.
