The long waves wash the strand, the fog lieslow, A moaning wind soft croons along the coast, And, white and gleaming like anew-made ghost, The seagull flaps along, 'heavy and slow, Then fades in the grey mist.

I dream Dead days arise and hold me in their arms, And whisper me : All men are born to die, Arid dawn is naught save presage of the gleam That kills our clay, e'en ridiile it gilds her unarms. â€”All the Tear Bound.
