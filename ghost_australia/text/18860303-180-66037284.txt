POINTS. Br Keedle. Our overworked legislators are having a royal holiday. Is it that there is nothing to be done in the Legislative iirena f Possibly the idea prevails that our laws have reached a state of perfection; and y«t it is only tbe other day a prisoner was set at liberty OAving te a technical blunder in framing the punishment clause of aa. Act. A prisoner convicted under the Larrikin Act can be fined, or fined and im prisoned, but not imprisoned alone. Why this anomaly? The Government bare ample time at their disposal to sweep away the whole of the criminal laws now in force and introduce an Act consolidating the same, as has been lately done in England. It is a matter of astonishment that Magis trates on the Bench can tell what Acts are in force in the Colony, they arc in such a ' higgledy- piggledy ** state ; and it is not too much to assert that if tbe convictions of prisoners now undergoing sentence were carefully enquired into it would lie found that a large percentage have been made under Acts not in force in the Colony, and are consequently bad. * v * * * Typhoid fever is said to have made its appearance in our midst, and the fact does not seem to crea+e much surprise. It is a matter of surprise, though, how the Capi tal has hitherto escaped decimation. Our City Fathers will, ere long-, have a terrible account to meet and settle unless they introduce some system of dealing with for prompt and vigorous action on their part, and the Council would do a vast amount of good, and go along way to wards fulfilling the duties of their position, if they were to introduce some effective measure in this direction, instead of wast ing both their time and the ratepayers' money ia making alterations on the Town Hall— They may patch, they may tinker at Hie Hall it [they will. But the horrible look will stick to it still. * * # * The ' Twins ' is dead; his ghost is left — hope still flickers. * * * * England expects that the Colonies will contribute to the ' Unemployed Fund ' ' Cool? * * * * Macallum's Dramatic Troupe coming!

The 'Twins' sickened and died when their first effort appeared- I respect them for this indication of being human. The ghost has more brass. * * * * Gascoyaers object to the Reverend G. beeause he intends to organise a nigger eleven aud shear the present ' Northern ers ' of all cricketing honour and glorv. * * # * A Club called the Metro.

Fremantle Grammar School' is five years old, it has more scholars than the State-assisted High School, which is much older and for years had the field to itself ! Why is this thus ? *F * °* «? 'Bob-tail' has not joined the staff of the West Australian. He declined to J-e bought over. * * * * I hare found that it is not the most pleasant of our neighbours* characteristics that alone elicit our admiration ; there are traits which we cannot but admire for their intense earnestness, thongh we Buffer as we admire. Of tlie Herald's many virtues I admire none more than its won derful self-confidence. It appears to be a leading principle of that paper to load up its pages with stale, uninteresting extracts, numberless repetitions, and a large amount of wearisome news. Of late we have been inundated with extracts from Indian files recounting the military shows of every prince in that showy country, whilst Eng land aad the other portions of the Queen's dominions are never thought of, uuless occasionally we have an extract given some days or weeks after it has appeared in the Inquirer or West Australian. Often three or four paragraphs will appear in one issue containing almost the same words. and as for the 'twaddle' — Cela, ic. And all this is inflicted on its readers because the paper advocates Responsible Govern ment, and must be patronised by the believers of that political creed. m *? * * Bat these burdens are light when com pared with the cheap advertising style of literature which the Herald has so much affected of late. This last act of unkind ness almost nerves me to rebel and declare myself a reformer, though not a supporter of the Herald. Pray what could be of deeper and more absorbing interest to us than to have the important speeches of Mr. Stanley — worthy man though he be — and Host Fielder made at a little one-horse entertainment in a country pub ? It is perTiaps gratifying to know on Mr. Stan ley's authority that we have listened to future operatic stars, and to the cynical there may be the added pleasure of having listened to these constellations without very pleasurable emotions. It is undoubt edly satisfactory to hear that Host Fielder does give his customers ' living excellent and accommodation ditto,' and the testi mony is doubly strong because borne by creatures of so angelic a mould that their palates roust need something very first class before their tongues declare their gastronomic yearnings to be 'excellently ' satisfied. All this is of deep interest to our colonists, so also is the address with its full camttlament of sisnatures, its emotion al tenderness and chaste composition. I can quite imagine the touching scene, and hope to recognise the deep importance of this matter to the destiny of our commun ity. But in the meantime I could wish that such matters were relegated to their proper section of the paper, where such to indisputable testimonial might stand eide by side with many others, equally eloquent, bearing testimony to the worth of various pills, lotions, oib£ &«? ; better still to elim inate such matter or permit it to waste. I What a pregnant word when applied to the Herald t — a portion of that paper for which I am daily called upon to sacrifice a penny ! One good result of the Gribble contro versy will be, I trust, his alienation from a line of business for which he is egregiously unnt- rile reverena ana rasn geoiieiuiku usight direct his energies into more profit able channels. Rabbits have quite as much devotional feeling as most blacks; the prospect, therefore, would be as promising, spiritually and infinitely more promising in. all other respects if a mission were started to christianise the rabbits. This would be in each case the most effectual mode of extermination ; success, however, in the latter effort would entitle arid earn for the reverend exterminator as much respect as he now has opprobrium. ^^ * * ? * The Daily News should not be so hard on the Herald; the Fremantle rug has naTroly a-]:cowlodgcd that it has indented for new- iypi» and new ideas. In the meart thno do Eot ba hard on budding genius. * . * ?*..'*? T was pleased to witness so comparatively larg-e a number of spectators on the Recre ation Ground on Saturday. The impetus given to any game by an indication of pub lie interest is immense. It is only by the existence of this interest that outdoor sports will ever obtain a firm hold among our youth. At present these sports are lamentably neglected and afford our ** plain-spoken friends ' an opportunity of declaring our degeneration and inferiority.
