THE GHOST RACKET. To tie Editor of the IHerald. Mu. EDITon,b-I wonder that some of your usual correspondents have so far forgotten the cacotlhes scribendi with which they are generally afticted as to have omitted to write to you on the all-engrossing subject of the hour-tho Ghost ! 1'or my own part I am not very well up in ghost liness; but I am about to have a regular go into the realms of ghostdom, and when my studies are suffi ciently matured I will write again. In the meantime perhaps the followiog conversa tion between two well-known citizens, whom I may be permitted to call Brown and Smith, may be con siderod worth publishing: Brown: Have you seen Rogers' ghost? Smith: No; but I'vo soon iogers gobbling (goblin). Yours truly, SUPEIRNATURELLOGRAM.
