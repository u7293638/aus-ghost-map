Another Old'Valsehood. Tho posaiblo olevation of tho Duke of Con- naught to u very high command, hna raised tho ghost of an old falsehood. That tho. duke's merits havo raised him to whero ho now is, or will over mako him . commaudor-in-ahiof of tho army, no ono believes. His olevation is duo to his hirtli. But that ho is not tolerably equal to - tlio uflico cannot ho truo. Still, on tho supposed ovo of his olevation tlioro stalks forth tho ghost of tho rumour that when the duke wont to Egypt strict ovdora woro givon to take euro of him. Mr. Childors, who .was Minister of War during tho Egyptian cam paign, writes to tho Manchester Guardian, stating, in referonco to a paragraph which recently appeared in that journal to tho offeet -that Lord Wolteloy reooivd an injunction from 'u very lijgh : quarter that tho Duko of Con- naught should not ho exposed to duiiger, arid that iu consqquonco tho order of battle wus_ changed at Tel-el-KebTr, that' tbo .allega tion is without foundation. . Tiioro is not a, traco of any such instruotjon or BUggcstku\reln- , tivo to thcDulcc of Connaught or to. anyone clse.i To this is added u. lotter from Lord WoIboIov, who Bays that tho story told that ho received a communication when in Egypt in 1882 to tho above eifoet is absolutely untrue ; tluituo onoevcr Huggested that bo should in any way deal with hiB Royal HiglmoBB differently from other general officers in command of brigudes, and that ho did not do so. Ho took his chance liko ovcrypno else, and as Wolselny reported ufc the i time, ho had no hotter brigadier in the forco then undor his command. But thut Did falsehood will novcr die. /
