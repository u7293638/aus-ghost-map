The Storyteller. The Christian. THIRD BOOK.-THE DEVIL'S ACRE. V. BY HALL CAINS, Author of "The Manxman." Glory sang that night with extraordinary vivacity and charm, and was called back again and again. Going home in the cab she tried to live through the day afresh, every step, every act, every word, down to that triumphant *' I will!"• Her thoughts swayed p& •with the swaying of the hansom, but sometimes the thunderous applause of the audience broke In, and then she had to remember where she had left off. She could feel that beating against her breast still and even smell the violets that grew by the pool. He had toid her to give up everything, and when at length this occurred to her a» a separate idea there was an exquisite thrill in the thought that perhaps some day she would annihilate herself and all, lier ambitions and . . . " who knows what then ?" ThJ* mood lasted until Monday moi'tt ing, when She was sitting 1n her room dressing very elowly-and smiling at her self in the glass, when the Cockney maid came in with a newspaper which 3ier master had sent up on account of a long Teport of the wedding. Thcie were two long columns of the event of Saturday, and she read it in snatches moments when other remem brance* of that day stole in— " The church of All Saints was crowd ed by a fashionable congregation, among jphom were many notable persons in the world of jwUtice .-and society, in cluding the father of the bridegroom, • the Duke of — r , andhiis elder brother, the Marquis of -—. An well of palu.B crossed the nave at the entrance to the diancel, and festoons of rare flow ers were suspended from the raite of the handsome screen. The altar and the table of the coinniandnients were almost obscured by the wreaths of er otics that hung over them and tiie columns of the colonnade, the font ana .offertory boxes were similarly buried in rich and lovely blossom. . #• . " Thanks to an informal rehearsal some day a before, the ceremony went off without a hitch. The officiating clergy were^fche Venerable Archdeacon Wealthy, D.D., assisted by the Rev. Joslab Golightly and other members of the numerous staff of All Saints. The service, whldh was full choral, was under the able direction of the well known organist an<l choirmaster, Mr. Carl Koenig, F.R.C.0., and the choin* consisted j>t twenty adult and forty boy voices. On the arrival of the 'bride a procession was formed at the west entrance and proceeded up to the chan cel, singing 'The voice that breath'd o'er Eden' . . ." "Poor Polly!" thought Glory. " The bride wore a duchess satin gown,-trimmed with chiffon and Brus sels lace, and having a long train hung from the shoulders. Her tulle veil was fastened with a ruby Ixroooh of twenty carats and with sprays of real orange .blossom sent specially from the Riviera, "and her necklace consisted of a rope of graduated pearls fully a yard long, and understood to have belonged to the jewel case of Catherine of Russia. She carried a bouquet of flowers (the gift of the bridegroom) brought from 'Florida, the American home of her fam ily. The bride's mother wore . « « " The bridesmaids were dressed . « . " Mr. Horatio Drake acted as best man. ..." Glory drew her breath as with a spaf.m and threw down the newspapei*. How blind she had been, how vain, how fool ish ! She had told John Storm that. Drake was only a good friend to her, •meaning him to understand that thus far she allowed him to go and no farther. But there was a whole realm of his life into which he did not «sk fcer to enter. The M notable persons in politics and society," " the bridesmald6 r " these made up his real sphere, his seri ous scene. Other women were his friends, companions, equals, intimate*, and when he stood In the eye of the world it was they who stood beside him. And she ? She was his hobby. He came to her in hds off-hours. She filled up the under aide of his life. With a crushing sense of humiliation she was folding up the newspaper to send it downstairs when her eye was arrested by a paragraph in small type in the corner headed oc currence at a. fashionable* marriage." " Oh, good gracious I" A glance had *hown her what it was. It was a re port of Polly's suicide. " At a fashionable marriage at a West End church on Saturday" (ix>. names) -" a young woman who had been sitting In the nave was seen to rise and at tempt to step into the aisle, as if with, the intentlon^of crushing her way out, .when she fell brrek in convulsions, and on being removed was found to be dead. Happily the attention of the congrega tion was at the moment directed to the "bride and bridegroom, who were returning from the vestry with the bridal party behittcTtilssv and thus, the painful incident made Oft sensation among the crowded congregation. The body was removed to the mortuary, and from subsequent inquiries it transpired that death had been due to poison self administered, and that the deceased was Elizabeth Anne Love (24), of no occupation, but formerly a nurse—a cir cumstance which had enabled her to procure half-a-grain of liquor strychnlae on her own signature at a chemist's where she had been known." " O God ! O God !" Glory under stood everything now. "'l've a great mind to go to All Saints and shame them.' . . . ,'Oh. it isn't the police I'm afraid of.'" Polly's purpose was clear. She had intended to fall dead at the feet of the bride and bridegroom and make them walk over her body. Poor, foolish, ineffectual Polly 1 Her very ghost must be ashamed of the failure of her revenge. Not a ripple of sensation on Saturday, and this morn ing only a few obscure lines in little letters ! Oh, it Tvas hideous! The poor thing's vengeance was theatrical and paltry, but what of the man, wherever he was ? What did he to Ink of hiinseif new, with his millions and hU murder V yes, his murder, for what else was it ? An hour later Glory was ringing the bell of a little house in St. John's Wood whereof the upper blinds were drawn. The grating of the garden door slid back and an untidy head looked out. " Well, ma'am T' " Don't you remember me, Liza ?" "Law, yes, miss P'-and the door was opened ; " but I was a feared you weTe one o' them reporrin' people, and my orders Is not to answer no questions." -" Has he been here, then T' " Blew ye, no, miss ! 'E's on '!» way to tlie Contlnente. But 'is frterid *a», and 'e'B settled everything liamlsoine— I will say that for the gentleman." Glory felt her gull rising as Ahe pasted .into the house ; tlhei'e was eoinethiug degrading, almost disreputable, even in the loyalty of Drake's frieud&hiip.; " Fancy Liz.i not knowing you, uiibS, and me at the inoosie 'all a Tuesday uighH I 'ope you'll excuse the liberty, but I did laugh, and I won't say but I shed a few tears too. Arranged ? Yes, the jury and the coroner and every thing. It's to be at 12 o'clock, so you may think I've 'ad my 'ands full. Bat you'll want to look at 'er, pore thing ! Go up, niLss, and mind yer fead. There's nobody but 'er friends with 'er." The friends proved to be Betty Bel mont and -her dressing-room companions. When Glory entered they showed no surprise. "The pore child told us all about you," eaid Betty, and the little one said, " It'a your nyine that's caught on, dear. The minute I heard it I said what a top-line for a bill!" It was the same little bandbox of a bedroom, only now it was darkened. Polly's troubles were over. There was a. slightly convulsed look about Lhe mouth, but the features were, otherwSe calm and childlike, for all the dead are Innocent. It was impossible to for get they had been friends. Glory's teard fell on the upturned face, and Polly carried them with her. The three women with demure faces were tipping benedlctine and talkiug among themselves, and Polly's pugdog was coiled up on the- bare bolster and snoring audibly. " Pore thing ! I don't know 'ow she could 'a done it. But there, that's the worst of this life. It's all in the present, aod leads to nothilug, and ain't got no future." " What could the pore thing do V She wasn't go wonderfully pretty ; and then jnen like . « ." " She was str'ight with 'lm, say what yer like. Only she ought to been more patlenter, and she needn't 'a been so 'ard on the laldy neither." " She 'ad everything the 'cart could wish. Look at 'er room* ! I wonder who'll " Carriages were 'heard outside, and two • or three men came in to do the last offices. Glory had turned her face away, but behind her the women were *>UH tailing. "What a lovely riug ! ♦ . , I wish I 'ad a keepsake to re member 'er by." "Well, and why not ? She won't want " Glory felt as if s-lie was choking, but Polly's pugdog !had been awakened by the commotion and was beginning to liowl, so she took up the little mourner and carried It out. An organ man somewhere near was playing " Sweet •Marie." The rtraernl was at Kensal Green, and the four girls were the only follow ers. The coroner's verdict being felo de-se, the body was not taken into the chapel, but a clergyman met It at the gate and led the way to the grave. Walking with her head down, and the dog under her arm, Glory had not seen him at first, but when he began with the tremendous words, " I am the resur rection and the life," she caught her breath and looked up. It was John Storm ! While they were in the carriage the clouds had been gathering, and now some spots of rain were falling. When the bearers had laid down their burden the spots were large and frequent, and all save one of the men turned and went back to the shelter of the porch. The three women looked at each other, and one of them muttered something about '* the dead and the living/ and then the little Jady stole away. After a moment the tali one followed her, and from shame of beias ashamed the third one went off also. By this time the rain was falling In a sharp shower, and John Storm, who was bareheaded, had opened his ijCQk and begun to read: " Forasmuch as It hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear sister here departed. . ." Then he saw that Glory was alone by the grave side, and his voice faltered, and almost failed him. It faltered again, and he halted when he came to the " sure and certain hope," but after a moment it quivered and filled out, and seemed to say, " Which of us can sound the depths of God's design V" After the •* maimed rites" were over John Storm ■went back to the church to remove his surplice, and when he returned to the grave Glory was gone. She sang as usual at the music hall that njght, but with a heavy heart. The difference communicated itself to the audience, and the unanimous applause which had greeted her before frayed off at length into separate hand-claps. Crossing the stage to her dressing-room she met Koenig, who came to conduct for her, and he said : "Not quite yourself to-night, meifl dear, eh ?" Going home In the hansom Polly's dog coddled up with the old sympathy to the new mistress, and seemed to be making the best of things. The house hold was asleep and Glory let herself In with a latch-key. Her cold supper was laid ready, and a letter was lying under the turned-down lamp, it was from her grandfather, and had beea written after church o» Sunday night. " It is now so long—more than a yea* —since I saw my rnnaway and truant that, notwithstanding the protests of Aunt Anna and the forebodings of Aunt Rachel, I have determined to give my old legs a journey and my old eyes a treat. Therefore take warning that I Intend to come up to London forthwith, that I may see the great city for the first time in my life, and—which is better—my, little granddaughter among all her new. friends, and In the midst of her great prosperity." At the foot of this there was a post script from Aunt Rachel, hastily scrawl ed in pencil " Take no notice of this. He Is far too weak to travel, and indeed he is really failing; but your letter, whic* reached us last night, has bo troubled him ever Bince that he can't take rest for thinking of it, and " It was the last straw. Before finish ing the letter or taking off her hat Glory took up a telegraph form and wrote : *' Postpone journey—am returning home to-morrow." Then she heard KoenJg letting himself into the house, and going downstairs she said : " Will you take this message to the telegraph office for me, please?" " Vhy, of course I vill, and den ve'U have supper togeder—look !" and" he laughed and opened a paper and drew, out a string of sausages. " Mr. Koenig," she said, " you were Tight. I was not myself to-night. I want a rest, and I propose to take one." As Glory returned upstairs ahe heard stammerings, sputtering®, and swear ings behind her about managers, en gagements, announcements, geniuses, children, and oruer matters. Back in her room, she lay down on the floor with her face in her hands and fobbed. Then Koenig appeared, panting and saying, " Dere ! I knew That vould happen ! Here's a pretty ting ! And dats vhy Mr. Drake told me to dewy you to de man. De brute ! de beast! de dirty eon of monk !" But Glory had leapt up with eyes of fire and was crying, "How dare you, (?ir ? OUt of my room thte instant!" " Mem Gott! It's a divil!" Koenlg wos muttering like a servant as he went downstairs. He went out to the tele graph office and came back, and then Glory heard him frying hL* sausage* on the dining-room fire. The Bight was far gone when she pushed aside her untouched supper, end wiping her eyes that she might see pro perly, sat down to write a letter— "Dear John Storm (monik, monster, or whatever it is!),—l trust it will be counted to me for righteousness that I am doing your bidding and giving up. •my profession—for the present. Between a woman's 'yes* and 'no' There Isn't room for a pin to go ! which is very foolish of her in this in stance, considering that ehe is earn ing various pounds a night And has no thing but Providence to fall back upon. I have told ray jailer I must have ray, liberty, and, being a man of like pas slow with yourself, he has been busy, blaspheming in the parlour downstairs; I trust virtue will be its own reward, for I dare say it is all I shall ever get. If I were Narcissus I should fall la love with myself to-day, having shown an obedience to tyranny which U beau tiful and worthy of the heroic age. But to-morrow moraing I go back to tho 'oilau,' and It wifll be so nice up there without anybody and all alone." She was laughing softly to herself as she wrote and catching her breath with a little sob at intervals. " A letter now and then Is profitable to the soul of man—and woman—but you must not expect to hear from me, and as for you, though you have resur rected yourself, I suppose a tyrant of your opinion* will continue the Bene dictine rule which compels you to hold your jpeace—and oilier things. lem en gaged to breakfast wiffh 4 nice girl named Glory Quayle to^moiTowTnoniing —that to to say, this morning—at Eus-** ton Station at a quarter to 7, but hap pily this letter wan't^reach you until 7.30, so I'll just escape' interruption." The house was still and the streets Were quiet, not even a cab going along. " Good-bye ! ' I've realisedr-a dog! IVa a pug, and therefore, like some body else, it always looks black at me, though 1 suspect Its father married be-, neath him, for it talks a good deal and! evidently ■hasn't been brought up hi a brotherhood. Therefore, being a * female,'. I Intend to call it Aunt Anna' —except when the original is about Aunt Anna has been hopping up and) down the room at my heels for the last hour, evidently thinking that a rational ■woman would behave better if she went to bed. Perhaps I shall take a leaf out of your book and ' comb her hair* when I get her all alone in the train to-nior-; row, that she may be prepared for the, new Sphere to which it has pleased; Providence to call her. " Good-bye again ! 1 see the lamps of Euston running after each other, only, it's the other way this time.

At 7 next morn lag, on the platform at Eiwton, Glory waa standing with ;melanQholy eyes at the door of a flr«t -<4a&B; compartment watching the people sauntering up , *uid down, talking Jn groups and hurrying to." aul fro, when Drake stepped up -to her. She did not ask what -Shad -brought liim, *he knew. He .looked frenli and 'handfioiiie, and wna fauUlessly dressed. . " You are doing quite right, my deal1, Ihe said- iv a cheerful yoiee. , " Kocuig telegraphed, and I came, to see yon off. Don't bofher about the theatre; leave cvoryfiilng to vac ; take a rest after your groat excitement and come back •bright and well." The locomotive whistled and .began to puut, the smoke rose to the roof, the ■train started, and before Glory knew she was going she wae gone. Then Drake walked to his club and wrote this postscript to a letter to Lord •Robert Ure at the Grand Hotel, Paris : " The Parson has drawn fir»t Wood, audv Cloi'la. has gone liome."
