An Ocean Tragedy. Bv W. CLARK RUSSELL. CHAPTER XIX.—continued. A MTSTEKIOUS VOICE. 1 LED her to the starboard quarter, where I had stood witli Crimp, and repeated the story. Tlie darkness gave my rccital of the iucident the complexion it -wanted ; a tremor passed through her liand into my arm. It was enough to make a very nightmare of the gloom, warm as it was with the dew- laden southerly breathing, and delicate too with the small fine light trembled into it by the stars, to think of a hail sounding out of it from a phantasm as shapeless as any dye of gloom upon the canvas of the night. Ten minutes passed ; I then discerned the figures of Wilfrid and Finn coining aft. My cousin's deep fireathing was audible when lie was still at a distance. " Well, what news ? " I called cheerily. Wilfrid drew close and exclaimed, "It is true. I have heard it." " Ha!" said I, turning upon Finn. "'Brail that is blue, then, Sir. Monson, sir," exclaimed the worthy fellow, " there is somewhat a-talking below." " What docs it say ?" asked Miss Jennings, showing herself all on a sudden thoroughly frightened. " What I heard," said Wilfrid in his most raven note, " was this, ' The yacht is cmttil. S*il her home! Sail har home.'"' " Twas as plain, Sir. Monson, as his honour's own voice," said Finn, in a profoundly despondent way. " D'ye think, Finn," said I, " that it iB a t rick played off upon the crew by some skylarking son of a gun forward ?" His head wagged against the stars. " I wish I could believe it, sir. The woice was underfoot. There's nobody belonging to the ship there. There's no man a missing. 'Sides 'tain't a human woice. Never could ha' believed it." He pulled out his pocket-handkerchief and polished his brow. " Well," I exclaimed, "so long as the thing, whatever it be, keeps forward—the deuce of it is, I\e heard such sounds myself twice. It can't be fancy then. Yet, confound it all, Wilf, there can be nothing supernatural about it either. What is it ? Shall 1 explore the yacht forward I Give mc a lantern, and I'll overhaul her to my own satisfaction anyway." " You may set us on fire," said Wilfrid; "let the matter rest for to-night. Tomorrow, Finn, you can rummage the yacht" Be started violently: "What can it be though." Are we veritably haunted by the ghost of the Portuguese ?" Ho tried to laugh, but the dryness of the utterance seemed to half choke him. " Well, let us wait for daylight, as you ov,' 1 cried I. " I am going below for some seltzer and brandy," said Wilfrid. "Finn, you may tell the steward to give the men a glass of grog apiece. Wliat can it be?" be muttered, and his long figure then flitted to the companion, through which lie vanished. It was evident the tiling had not yet had time to work in him. He was more astonished than terrified, but I guessed that superstition would soon be active in niin, and that there was a bad night before lum of feverish imagining and restless wandering. I could not have guessed how frightened Jliss Jennings was until I conducted her below, shortly after Wilfrid had left the deck, where I was able to observe her scared wliite face, the bewildered expression in her eyes and a "lryneEs of her cherry under-lip, that kept her biting upon it. Her maid ™ared her berth, and I was mighty thankful to feel that the sweet creature had a companion. Indeed, had she been alone, one might have wagered she would not have gone to bed that night. My cousin drank freely, but for all that a gloom of spirits settled upon him as slowly and surely as a fog thickens out the atmosphere and darkens down upon the view. He talked with heat and excitement of the strange voice at the first going but alter a little he grew morose, absentminded, with symptoms of temper that jnade me extremely weary, and I fetched a breath with a positive sigh of relief when he abruptly rose, bade us brusquely good- "ight, and went in long, melodramatic strides to his cabin. I did my best to inspirit Miss Jennings, uut I was not veiy successful. It may be 1 w »* more half-hearted in my manner of going to work than I was conscious «t. It never could come to my telling nor more than that we might be quite sure If we could only solve the mj^teiy , ™ c sounds which had frightened all hands forward, and aft, too, for the matw-rof that, TO should bo heartily ashamed the face of the abject « ttu^^ a? you say," she said, "but ^ecd, gJ^JT^econtinues to be heard, 11 rpeak again snfl yet remain unriddled, what shall we think ? I am frightened, 1 own it. I do not believe in spirits, Mr. Monson, in haunting shadows, and other inventions of old nurses ; but I cannot forget that you have heard sucli a voice as this twice—you who " Stupid," said L " Matter of fact, Mr. Monson." But talking about the thing was not going to help her nerves. She went to bed at ten o'clock, and feeling too sleepy for a yarn with Finn I withdrew to my cabin. I found myself a bit restless, however; when I came to put my head upon the pillow, and would catch myself listening, and sometimes I fancied I could hear a faint sound as of a person talking in a low voice. Tlien it was I would curse myself for a fool and turn angrily in my bed. Yet for all that, I would fall a-listening again. It was quiet weather still, as it had hfien -&ixxcc; -sundown. ' III tliti blackness of my cabin I bould see a bright star .sliding up and dowii the ebony of the glass of the scuttle, with a pause at intervals, when it would beam steadfastly and intelligently upon me as though it were a human eye. Now and again the water went away from the side in a stifled sob. I could have prayed for such another squall as I have described to burst upon us for the life that would come to the spirit out of the lightning flash, the roar of thunder, the shriek of wind, the fierce blow of the black surge, and the tempestuous hiss of its dissolving spume. I cudgelled my wits for a solution of the voice, but to no purpose. It was ridiculous to suppose that a man lay hidden below. For what sailor of the crew but would not be quickly missed ? And then again I had but to consider, to understand what I had not thought of on deck, I mean that even if a pair of hurricane lungs were secreted in the hold it was scarcely conceivable that their utmost volume of sound could penetrate through the thick, wellcaulked planking of the forecastle deck. At last I fell asleep. CHAPTER XX. MUM' is TOKISHBD. IT was seven o'clock when I awoke. I at once rose, bathed, and went on deck, thinking as I passed through the cabin and observed the brilliant effect of the sunshine streaming through porthole and skylight in rippling silver upon the shining bulkheads, the radiant lamps, the mirrors, rich carpet and elegant draperies of the cabin, what a veiy insignificant figure a night-fear cuts by daylight. The wind was north-east, a merry morning with a wide blue heaven full of liquid lustre softened by many small white clouds blowing into the south-west, and rich as prisms with the rainbow lights that kindled in their skirts as they sailed past the sun. The firm line of the ocean went round the sky tenantless. The yacht was mn.l-iTijT good way, running smoothly over the crisping and crackling waters under an airy spread of studdingsail which trembled a light into the water far beyond her tide. Finn was on deck standing aft with his back upon the companion. I walked leisurely over to him with vitality in the veiy last recesses of my being stirred by the exquisite sweetness and freshness of the long, pure sunlit gushing of the wind. "Good morning, Captain Finn." He turned and touched his cap. " How long is this delicious weather going to last, 1 wonder? Nothing in sight, eh I Bless us, captain, when are we going to tun the Shark into view ? " He looked at me with a curious expression which his smile, that was always in the middle of his face, Tendered exceedingly odd, and said, "Did ye hear anything like a mysterious woice, sir, last night after you'd turned in ? " '' I was for fancying," I answered, "that the atmosphere crawled with indistinguishable whispers. But I suppose without imagination there would be no lunatic asylums." He said, still preserving his odd look, " The sperrit's discovered, dr." " Gammon !" I exclaimed. " Ay ! we've got hold of the woice 1" lie cried gleefully. " Did ye ever see a ghost, Mr. Monson, sir ? Look ! There's the corpse as belonged to the wreck, and there's the liapparibon aewas a-cursing of this yacht last night in die forepeak, and your honour may take it that there is the invisible shape whose hail from off yon quarter has given old Jacob the blues ;" and all the time that ho spoke he was pointing to the fore-rigging just under the cross-trees. I had before lightly glanced ataman up there, but had given him no heed Whatever, as I supposed him to be a sailor at work.. Bid; now I looked again, shading my eyes. "Muffin!" I cried with a gasp of astonishment. '' Do you mean to say—1" • and I veritably staggered as the foil truth and absurdity of the thing rushed upon me. He hung in the rigging facing seawards, and there was turn upon turn of rope round liis arms and legs ; indeed he was aa enugly secured to the shrouds as if lie had been a sample of fifing gear. The sailors had teompdssionately jammed his hat down on his head, and in the shadow of the brim of it his face looked of the sickly yellow hue of tallow. But he was too high to enable me to witness the expression he wore. He had nothing on but his shirt and a pair of grimy duck trousers rolled to above his knees. " What do you think of him as a sperrit, sir ? " cried Finn, with a loud hoarse laugh which caused the sailors at work forward to look up grinning at Muffin, who hung as motionless in the shrouds as if he lay in a feint there. " How long has he been seized aloft ? " said I, with something of a pang coming to me out of.the sight of. him, for there followed close on my first emotion of astonishment a sort of admiration for the outlandish genius of the creature that "worked in me like a feeling of pity. "'Since dawn," answered. Finn. "The men put him where he is. I iet 'em have -their .way..—I- was afeercd they -mighthave used him in an uglier fashion, sir. Jack don't like to be made a fool of, your honour. Old Jacob, I'm told, fell bloodthirsty. Ye see, ye can't take a view of them sailors, especially such a chap as Cutbill, and think of 'em as lambs." " He must be an amazingly clever ventriloquist; though," said I, "Of course]! All's as clear as daylight now. He was leaning over the rail when Crimp and I were talking on that night we heard the voice. I caught sight of him in the cabin a minute after the cry had sounded. The dexterous rogue 1 he must have sneaked with amazing swiftness below. A consummate actor, indeed! Qow was he discovered ? " "Why," answered Finn, with a slow Bhakc of laughter, " there's a chap named Harry Blake as occupies the bunk just over him. Blake like O'Connor, is an Irishman, with a skin as curdles to the thoughtofaghost. Hewasmorefrightened than any other man forrards, and lay awake listening. Time passed : all the watch was snoring saving this here Blake. On a sudden he hears the woice. He sits up, all of a muck o' sweat. Why, think's he, it's the mute as lies under me a-talking in his sleep ! He drops on to the deck and looks at Muffin, who presently fell a- talking again in his sleep, using the hidentical words that Sir Wilfrid had heard, and the tone o' woice was the same, sort o' muffled and dim-like; but it wasn't pitched fit to make a scare, steing, of course, that the hartist was unconscious. On this Blake sings out, kicks up a regular hullabaloo, tells the men that the woice was a trick of Muffin's. Muffin being half-dazed and terrified by the sailors crowding round his berth, threatening of him, confesses, and says that he did it with the notion of terrifying Sir Wilfrid into returning home as his life had growed a burden. Hie men then called a council to settle what should be done with him, and it ended when daybreak come in their seizing him up aloft as ye see there, where they mean to keep him until I've consulted with Sir Wilfrid as to die sort of punishment the chap merits." "What shall you propose, Captain Finn?" said I, with a glance at the tiound figure, whose motionlessness made him seem lifeless, and whose posture, therefore, was not a little appealing. "Sir," answered Finn, "I shall recommend his honour to leave it to the men." " But they may hang him ? " " No ; Til see they stop short of that. But, Mr. Monson, sir, begging your pardon, Fm sure you'll allow with me that Muffin 'II desarve all he's likely to get. Speaking as master of this wessel, I say that if he hadn't been found out in good time it might have gone blazing hard with all of us. The men were saucy enough last night, growling, indeed, as if it was next idoor to a mutiny being under way ; and yet it was the first time of the woice speaking in the hold.' Imagine it going on for several nights ! It was bound to end in all hands giving up unless we shifted our helm for home, which Sir Wilfrid -would never have consented to; so there ye'd have had a quandary as bad as if the sailors had been laid low with pison, "or as if the Bride had tamed to and leaked at every butt end. Then think of "his. nn"i"fc'' l c his honour's cabin with flaming letters; all to sarve his own measly wish to g$t out of an undertaking that he don't nelish. . . . Mr. Monson, sir, he wants a lesson, something arter the whipping- and pickling business o* my fathers day, and sooner than that he should miss one of his desarta by striving to get to windward of the soft side of his honour's nature, I'm damned," said he, striking Ids open hand with his clenched fist, "if 1 wouldn't tip and tell Sir Wilfrid myself that it was that there Muffin as 'wrote the chining words about his honour's baby.".. \- "Bestnotdothat," said I. " We want no tragedies aboard us, Finn. However,.you maycount upon iny not interfering; but for'God's rake let there l>e no brutality-" "That 'J1 be all right, sir," answered the skipper, with such a look, however, at the helpless and stirless figure in the rigging as satisfied me that his inclination at present at all events, was not towards mercy. It was not a sort of sifjht to make the deck a pleasant lounge till breakfast time. I was moved by some compassion for the unfortunate creature, mainly due, I believe, to a secret admira^im for his remarkable skill and dramatic cunning ; and understanding that the sooner Wilfrid was apprised of this, business the sooner would Muffin be brought down out of the shrouds, I stepped below. The head steward came out of my cousin's cabin as I approached the door. " Is Sir Wilfrid getting up ? " said I. " I've just taken him his hot water, sir. He isn't out of bed yet. He's very heavy; had a bad night, I've been told, I passed on and knocked. "What is it?" cried Wilfrid, in a drowsy irritable voice. I entered, and said, " Sorry to disturb you, Wilf, but there's news that will interest you." He started up; " The Shark? " he cried. "No," I answered, "they've found out who talked like a ghost last night; who it was that whispered off the ocean to Crimp and me that this yacht was cursed; and who it was that made the corpse on the wreck hail us." He sat bolt, upright with eyes and nostrils large with excitement. " Who ? " " Muffin," said I. "Muffin!" he shouted; "what d'ye mean, Charles?" "Why, the fellow's a ventriloquist, an incomparable artist, I should say, to deceive us all so atrociously well." He stared at me with a face of dumb astonishment. "What was his motive, think you ? " he asked presently. " He's pining to get home," I replied ; " he's capable of any tricks to acliieve that end. The men mean to punish liim, and Finn is waiting to confer with you on the subject. They've had him lashed to the rigging aloft since daybreak." " The scoundrel!" he oried, springing on to the deck with a dark look of rage, yet with an indescribable note of relief as of a mind suddenly eased, softening the first harshness and temper of hiB voice. "I have to thank him for a frightful night. What a fool 1 am," he cried, vehemently striking his forehead, "to suffer myself to be terrified by things which I ought to know—which I ought to know," he repeated with passionate emphasis, " cannot be as they seem." "Well, Wilf," said I, "you will find Finn on deck. He will tell you all about it, and you will leave the fellow's punishment to the men, or settle with Finn the sort of discipline the man deserves as you shall think proper. I wash my hands of the affair, satisfied with Finn's promise that there shall be no brutality," with which I left him and returned to my cabin, where I lay reading till the breakfast. bell rang. \- Miss JeimiiigB was alone in the cabin. She stood with head inclined over some flowers which still bloomed in the mould in which they had been brought from England. The sunshine of her hair blended with the pinks and whites of the petals, and the gems on her hands trembled like dewdrops on the leaves of the plants as she lightly touched them with fingers half caressing, half adjusting. Her look of astonishment when I told her that the voice we had heard was a trick of Muffin's was like a view of her beauty in a new light; amazement with a sparkle as of laughter behind it to throw out the expression, rounded her eyes and deepened their hue. Then the little creature clasped her hands with gratitude that the thing should have been discovered. "Muffin is quite a rascal," she said, "and so clever as to be a real danger." She could scarcely credit that be had skill enough to deceive the ear as he had. Wilfrid was slow in coming; I could see him through the skylight walking with Finn, gesticulating much, with a frequent look in the direction where, as I might, gather, Muster Muffin still hong. He kept Miss Laura and I waiting for neatly a quarter of an hour, during which I explained how Muffin had been discovered, how Wilfrid had gone on deck to arrange a punishment for bim| and the like. Presently my cousin arrived, and on catching sight of Miss Jennings, cried out in his most boyish manner, " Only think, my dear, that our superstitious alarms last night should be owing to a trick, but a deuced clever trick, of that illiterate, yellow-faced, tearful, half-cracked son of a greengrocer — Muffin. I never could have believed he had it in him. Eh, Charles ? Mad of course ; 1 don't say dangerously so, but warped, you know, or is it likely that he would practise so cruel and dangerous a deceit merely because he wants to get home ? Why, d'ye know, Gharles, Finn gravely swears that, had the rascal persisted successfully for two or three nights, the yacht would have been in an uproar of mutiny, perhaps seized, ay, actually seized, through the terror of the crew, and sailed home—ending all my hopes." " How is he to be served J " "Finnproposes," he answered, " that the men should form a court—a judge and jury. Their decision will be brought aft fur our approval. If the sentence be a reasonable one, the fellows will be allowed to execute it." Miss Jennings looked scared. " They won't hurt him much," said I " Finn has pledged his word to me. "Tis the fright that will do liim good. Is he out of the rigging, Wilf ? " " Probably by this time," he answered. " I told Finn to get him sent down and fed. The sun is hot up there, and the poor devil faced it." Whilst wo breakfasted I had much to say about the fellow's singular accomplishment as a ventriloquist; suggested that by-and-bye he should be brought aft to entertain us, and expressed wonder that a man so gifted, qualified by nature, moreover, to dress up his singular and special faculty with the airs of as theatrical a countenance as ever I had heard of, should be satisfied with the mean offices oi a valet. But my flow of speech was presently checked by a change of mood in Wilfrid. TTi« face darkened; he ushed his plate from him, and let fly at luffin in language which would not have been wanting in profanity probably had Miss Jennings been absent. "Do you remember those strange warnings that I received about' my little one}" heeded, turning a wild eye upon c me. < After the gross deception of last night, who's to tell me that I might not have been made-a fool of in that too 1" I shot a hurried glance of meaning and i wanungat Miss Jennings, and said carelessly, " Depend upon jt, we can never bo the victims of more than our senses in this life." : • Why should the creature have left me togoforwaid? he •shouted. I touched my forehead with a smile. "When you engaged this.fellow," said I, " you supposed Ms brain healthy anyway. Vow, my dear Wilf, the motive of this voyage supplies plenty of occupation to the mind, and there is excitement enough to be got out of it without the obligation of a lunatic to wait upon ycu." He burst into a laugh, without however a hint of merriment m It, and then fell silent and most uncomfortably moody. Shortly afterwards he went on deck. '' WhatH they do to Muffin, Mr. Mon-^ son, do you think ? " Miss Lama asked. ~ g "1 cannot imagine," said i ; may duck him from the yard-^rJ;, ; the® may spreadeagle and refresh, him 'with -A few dozens; punish him they will. Finn is hot against. him. He is quite right in suggesting that a few such experiences as that of last night might— indeed must—have ended in a perilous mutiny. Are you coming on deck ? "No." " But it is a beautiful morning. The breeze is as sweet aI milk, and the clouds as radiant as though the angels were blowing soap-bubbles." "I do not care ; I shall remain in the cabin. Do you think I could witness a man being ducked or whipped ? I should faint." "Well, I will go and view the spectacle, so as to be able to give you the story of it."- She pouted, and cried, "Wretched Mufin! Why did Wilfrid bring him? Lerd me one of Scott's novels, Mr. Monson: I cannot get on with that story aboitthe nobility." I was not a little surprised, on passing thrcugh the companion hatch, to find that the first act of the drama was about to begn. The whole of the ship's company, with the exception of the man who was at the wheel, were assembled on the forecastle. Crimp and Finn stood together near the forerigging, looking on. Ont of the sailors, who I afterwards leained was Cutbill, had pinned a blanket ova-his shoulders to serve him as a robe, whilst on his head he wore a contrivance thai; might have been a pudding-bag, though what it really was I could not distinguish. He had covered his chin and cheeks with a quantity of oakum, and prsented a very extraordinary appearance as he sat with a great air of dignity on the top of a small bread cask. Six sailors. stood wing-like on either hand him, constituting the jury, as I supposed. Confronting Cutbill was Muffin between two brawny salts, each of whom held him by the arm. The valet made a most melancholy figure, and even at the distance of the quarterdeck I could see his naked yellow shanks, his breeches being turned above the knees, quivering and yielding, till I began to think that the two sailors held him, not as a prisoner, but to prevent him from tumbling down. Wilfrid was swinging to and fro the quarterdeck with long flighty strides, taking an eager, probing, short-sighted stare at the crowd forward when he faced them, and then rounding to step aft with a grin on his face and his underlip working as "though Tie talked." " I'm glad to see Cutbill making a fool of himself,"said I. " Jack's jinks are seldom dangerous when he introduces skylarking after the pattern of that fellow's make up. Shall we step forward and hear the trial, Wilf ?" "No," said he, " it would be undignified. Every man to the end he belongs to aboard a ship. Finn is there to see all fair. Besides, Muffin might appeal to me or to you, and I mean that the sailors shall have their way with him, providing, of course, that they don't cany things too far." "Let's sit then," said I; "your sevenleague boots are too much for me this hot morning." He called to the steward to bring him his pipe, and we posted ourselves on the grating abaft the wheel. It was a very gem of a picture just then. The canvas rose spreading on high in clouds of soft whiteness so silver-like to the burning of the sun that viewed from a little distance I don't doubt they would have shone upon the eye with the sparkle of crystal or the richer gleam of a pearl-encrusted surface. The decks went forward pure as ivory, every shadow so sharp that it looked as though an artist had been at work upon theplankB, counterfeiting the rigging and every curve of stirless cloth and all delicate interlacery of ratline and gear running crosswise. The sea sloped in dark blue summer undulations, light as the rise and fall of the breast of a sleeping girl, into the liquid azure upon the starboard, bow, where the steam-white clouds were gathered in a huddle like a great flock of sheep waiting for the rest that were on their way there to join them. The crowd on the forecastle filled that part of the vessel with colour. It was the fuller of life for the coming and going of the shadows of the far-reaching studdings&ils; and the marble-like arch of the flowing squaresail on the many dyes of the tough, knotted, bearded groups of faces with heads of hair and wiry whiskers ranging from the blackness of the rook's plumes to a pale straw colour, most of the beards wagging to the excited gnawing upon junks of tobacco standing high in the cheek-bones, with here a wrinkled grin, there a sour cast, all combining to a picture that I have but to close my eyes to witness bright and vivid again as though it were of yesterday. The trial was very decorously conducted; there were no jeers, no cries, no noise of any kind. I could hear the rumble of Cutbill's deep-sea notes, and once or twice Muffin's response, faint as the squeak of a rat deep down. Crimp was called as a witness, and declaimed a bit, but nothing reached me savo the sulky rasp of his voice. The fooling did not last long. Cutbill got on top of his cask to address the jury, and I saw the fellow at the wheel near us shaking his sides at the preposterous figure of the man as he hugged his blanket to his heart, gravely nodding with his pudding-bag first to the six men on his left, then to the six men on his right, whilst he delivered his charge. . When this was ended Captain Finn, with a look aft, sang out at the top of his voice, evidently that we should hearhim: " Now, my lads, you who constitute the jury, what's your vardict? Is the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty ? " . "Guilty!" all twelve men roared out at once, on which Cutbill, still erect on his cask, passed judgment. I strained my ear, but to no purpose. It was a = monotonous rigmarole of a speech, and so long that I turned with a face of dismay to Wilfrid. "I say, what are they going to do with him ? Why, Cutbill has said enough to include whipping, ducking, roasting, hanging, and quartering." " They only mean to frighten him," he answered, looking anxious nevertheless. The two men who grasped Muffin walked him into the head, faced him round, and stood on either hand him still preserving their hold. Finn came aft, the men meanwhile hanging about in a body forward in a posture of waiting. "Well, what is decidcd on?" cried Wilfrid eagerly and nervously. Finn touched his cap. He tried to look grave, but secret enjoyment Was very visible in the twinkle of his eye, spite at the portentous curve of his mouth and the' long drop of his chops to his Chin end. "Your honour, the men's vardict is that the prisoner's to be cobbed and ducked." "Cobbed!" cried Wilfrid, whilst I exclaimed " Ducked !" with a look at the Ifore yaidarm that stood high above the 3P®®* fe." Every manll give him a blow with a •Tribe's end . as he walks forrard," exgynjped Firm; "and arterwards cool him with a bucket <f water apiece." Wilfrid's eyes came to mine. " It will depend upon how hard every man hits," said I; "the ducking is innocent enough. Yet I see nothing of cruelty in the sentence ; and really the fellow not only requires to be punished, but to be terrified as well." "The hands are waiting for me to tell 'em to begin, your honour," saidFinn with a glance forward. "It'll make the punishment too severe to keep the poor devil awaiting for it." "One moment," exclaimed Wilfrid; "did he offer any excuses ? " "Why, sir, he said he was egged on with the desire to return to his mother and get off the sea which disagrees with his insides and affects his hintellectuals. He says he meant no more harm than that. Don't believe he did, but it might have ended in some smothering trouble all the same ' 1 came as a walet,' says he 'and here now am I,' says he, 'broke— just a ship's dog, a filthy scullion,' says he, 'when my true calling,' says he, 'is that of gentleman's gentleman.'" " But, confound him ! " cried Wilfrid, " it was he who left me ; I did not dismiss him. He went foiward of his own wilL" "My dear Wilfrid, he is cracked," said I. " Get on, get on and make an end of thiB, now, Finn," exclaimed Wilfrid with a little colour of temper in each cheek. " I'm weary of the business, and want these decks cleared and quiet to the eye." The skipper promptly trudged forward, and sung out as he advanced. In a few moments most of the sailors had ranged themselves along the deck in a double line. Every man held a piece of rope in his hand—reef points they looked to me, though whether they had been cut for this special business or had been hunted for amidst raffle of the kind forward I cannot say. Meanwhile a couple of seamen handed buckets full of water along from a little pump in the head until every man had one at his feet. When these preparations were completed the brace of salts who had chaige of Muffin suddenly whipped off" his shut, and laid bare Ms back, so that he stood in nothing but a pair of breeches, a very radish of a figure—his yellow anatomy glancing dully in the sunshine, whilst the ghastly pallor of his face was heightened yet by his plaister of coal-black hair just m Tijn jpward terror was accentuated by the cort screw-like writhing of his lean legs, the convulsive twitching of his arms, and the dismal rolling of his dead, black, lustreless eyes. It was impossible not to feel sorry for the wretched creature. One felt that he was intitled, by virtue of the remarkable gift he had displayed, to a discipline of a more dignified sort than he was now to be subjected to. I laughed out, however, when Cutbill formed a procession. Absurdity could not have gone beyond the figure thegreat whiskered tarpaulin cut in Ins blanket and the canvas bag that served him as headgear as, making a sign, he tragically entered the double line of men, beating with his hands that Muffin and his two supporters should keep time with his strides. When Muffin was brought to the aftermost end of the rank of seamen Cutbill seized bim by the neck and forced him to give us a bow. The two sailors who had conducted him to this point then posted themselves with the others, each of them picking up a rope's end, whereupon Cutbill, twisting Muffin so as to force him to face the vessel's forecastle, took a couple of strides backwards, extending his arms under his blanket to hinder Muffin from running forwards. "Lay on now!" he hoarsely bawled, and then whack 1 whack ! whack ! whack! sounded upon the unhappy Muffin's spine as rythmically as the tapping of a landcrab's claws upon a polished floor. Every fellow administered his single blow with a will, one or two spitting on their hands before their turn came. The sufferer writhed pitifully to the very first stroke, and to the fourth howled out like a dog. The sight half sickened me, and yet I found myself laughing—though, I dare say, there was something of hysteric nervousness in my merriment—at the preposterous spectacle of the staggering, twitching, dodging, almost nude figure of Muffin, throwing out into strong relief the huge blanketed form of Cutbill, who, with arms distended, his head -with its adornment of oakum nodding gravely from side to side as if bestowing approbation on each man for the blow he dealt, strode backwards on majestic legs, carefully turning out his toes as* though he were giving Muffin a lesson in dancing, and sliding along the lines of knotted, hairy feces with the air of some court functionary marshalling the progress of royalty. As the echo of the last wliack rose hollowly off Muffin's back, the skin of which was unbroken, . though it was barred with white lines that resembled flakes of peeled onion, Cutbill whirled him round again, choking the yell he was in the act of delivering into a moan, and ran him back to where he had first started. The ropes' ends were now dropped ; every man seized his bucket, and as Muffin moved, slowly confronted as before by Cutbill, who barricaded the way with outstretched arms, striding backwards once again with Cape-Horn graces, he received a deluge full in his face one after another till I thought the very breath would have been washed out of his body. "Nowcutdownbelowanddryand clothe yourself," roared Finn, as the last bucket was emptied over the shivering creature, "and the next time, my lad, ye try any of your pranks upon e'er a man aboard this wessel, whether he lives forward or whether he lives aft, we'll send ye aloft to that yardarm there with a rope round your neck." Cutbill whipped off his blanket and tore the oakum and cap off his head. In a few brief moments the decks resounded with the slapping of sailors swabbing up the wet; buckets were stowed away in their places, the rope's-ends collected, and in an incredibly short space of time all was as though no such incident as I have related had happened, the planks drying fast, some seamen. aft spreading the awning, other fellows at their several jobs in the rigging or on deck, just a grin now and again passing amongst them, but no laughter and no talk, and the yacht softly pushing forwards under the increasing glory of the sun fast approaching his meridian. 4 1 We shall hear no more of Muffin, I think," stud Wilfrid, showing nothing of the excitment I had expected to find in him. " No," said I with a yawn and sickened somewhat by the business that had just ended, "but all this sort of business doesn't look like the errand that has brought us out on to the face of these broad waters." "Ay," said he, "but that errand was in Jeopardy until this morning." HjMrent to the rail and took a long thirsty look ahead. 1 waited thinking lie meant to return. Instead he folded his arms and continued gazinjt, motionless, with eyes so intently fixed that I took a look too, conceiving that he beheld something to fix his attention. A strange expression of surprise entered his face, his brow lightened, an air of eagerness sharpened his visage. 'Twas as likely as not that he saw with liis mind's eye what he craved to behold in reality, and that the vision a sudden craze had raised up before him was as actual to his tainted imagination as if it lay bright to all hands upon the sea-line. But I felt wearied to the heart, sick as from a sort of groundswell of emotion, worried with sharper longings to make an end of this idle quest than had ever before visited me. The mere sight of Wilfrid's posture and face was enough to increase the fit of the blues upon me just then, and I quietly slipped below for such sunny influence as was to be got out of the presence of the sweet little woman in the cabin. C H A P T E R XXI. HEAVY WEATHER. AJTEB this, for a good many days nothing in any degree noteworthy happened. It seemed, indeed, as though whatever little there was to alarm or divert during this extraordinary voyage had been packed into the beginning of it. Muffin lay ill of his back for two days in his bunk; but for Wilfrid, Finn would have had the poor devil up and about within an hour of drying and dressing himself. The skipper could not forgive that menace of mutiny which had been involved in the yellow-faced joker's effort to procure the shifting of the yacht's helm for home, and he would always refer privately to me with violent indignation to the vxdet's trick upon his master. But on Wilfrid's hearing that the man was in pain and that his nerves had been prostrated by the punishment, he ordered Finn to let him remain below until he was better or well. There was no more ventriloquism ; the midnight silence of the forecastle was left unvexed by muffled imprecations. The sailors, when -Muffin left his bunk, asked him to give them an entertainment, to which he replied by saying he would see them in a nameless place first. The request, indeed, maddened him. I gatherod from sullen Crimp'a suur version of. the incidentthatMuflin shrieked at the men, shook his fist at them, his eyes^started half ont of his head, the foam gathered upon his lips, and he heaped curses and oaths of a nature so novel, so unimaginable, indeed, upon them, that the stoutest shruuk back from the screaming creature, believing him to be raving mad. However, he behaved himself very quietly on deck. I never caught him looking our way nor speaking, nor heard him again singing in a dog-watch in his woman's voice. Life grew so tediouB that I should have been glad to see him aft again for the sake of his parts as a mimic and actor. I was certain the man would have contrived a very good entertainment for us night after night; but Wilfrid said no, angrily and obstinately once and for all, and so the subject dropped. The north-east traies blew a fresh breeze and bowled us hindsomely athwart the broad blue field of tlie Atlantic. The Bride waB a noble sailer when she had the chance, and some of our runs rose to three hundred miles in the twenty-four hours, with a bill of snow at either bow and the frothing surge of the trades chasing us, and a sensible increase of heat day after day in the loud and shrilling sweep of air and the glitter of flying-fisli sparkling on wings of gauze from the white and gold of our vessel's shearing passage. We had entered the tropics, but had met with no ship that we could speak. At times a sail shone, but always afar. The look-out aloft was as steadfast as the rising and the sinking of the sun. Day after day the polished tube up there was sweeping the glass-like sapphire of the ocean boundary, steadily circling the firm line of its steeping from either quarter to ahead. But the cry of "Sail ho!" delivered at long intervals, never resulted in more than the disclosure of a rig of a very different pattern from what we were in pursuit of. A settled gloom fell upon my cousin's spirits. He complained of sleeplessness; his appetite failed him, he talked but b'ttle, and his one subject was the Shark. I would sometimes long for a startling incident to shake him out of the melancholy that Eat darkly as the shadow of madness upon him. Miss Jennings tried hard to keep up her heart, but already I could see that the monotony of the voyage, coupled with an incessant strain of expectation, was proving too much for her. She had come to this strange quest taking my cousin's word for what was to happen. She had given Wilfrid's programme of hopes no consideration. We were bound to fall in with the Shark at sea, or, at the very worst, to arrive at the Cape before her, and there lay in wait. She was finding out now that the ocean was the prodigious plain I had represented it for a pursuit of this kind, and that the journey had already grown infinitely tedious, though Table Bay lay some thousands of miles distant yet. Still she stuck to her guns manfully. Her heart would show in her eyes when she thought herself unobserved ; but if ever I approached the subject, in conversing with her on the vagueness and vanity of this pursuit, she would tell me that it was idle to talk, that she had made up her mind, that she had cast in her lot with Wilfrid in this chase, and that whilst he continued to pursue his wife, no matter to what part of tlie world he might direct Finn to steer tlie vessel, she would remain at his side. "Should I ever forgive myself, do you think, Mr. Monson," she would argue, *' if after I had left him Wilfrid found Henrietta, and she refused to return with him for lack, perhaps, of the influence I should be able to exert? " "Ay. but do not you suppose too much f " I would answer. " PcHtapn Wilfrid might fall in with his wife ; perhaps she might decline to have anything to do with him; perhaps if you were presentshe might yield to your entreaties. As my sympathies are not so deeply concerned as yours, I am able possibly to take more practical views. . The one staggering consideration with me is this: vre arrive at Table Bay and find the Shark has sailed and there is nobody to tell us where she has gone. Figure our outlook then I" _ ' 'But vou are supposing too.. may arrive B CONFKONTUTQ CUTBILX. WAS HCTF1K BETWEEN TWO BHAWJTY SALTS. then ?" I might liave replied by another question: " If Lady Monson, at Table Bay, should decline to allow her husband to cany her home in his yacht, wKat ihcti ? " It must have fared hard \rit£"me, I* think, but for this girl; for had I liad during this journey no other companion than Wilfrid, likely as not it would hare: ended in my carrying "a bee in my bonnet" for the rest of my days. Between us we managed to ViH many tedious hours "witli cards, chess, chats, reading aloud •whilst Wilfrid lay hid in God knows what mysterious occupation in his cabin or paced tlie deck alone, austere, unapproachable, with an iron sneer on his lip and on his brow the scowl of a dark mood out of I which you might have looked to see him j burst into some wild, unreasoning piece of behaviour, some swearing fit, or insane soliloquy—one knew not what; only that the air of him held you restless with expectation of trouble in that way. The night-time was the fairest part of this queer trip when we got under the tropic heights, with, failing breezes, hot and moist, softly-running suites languidly gushing into a sheet-lightning of phosphoric froth, a full moon that at her meridian came near to the brilliance of sunrise, the planets large, trembling and of lieavchly beauty, a streak of dim fire in the dark water over the counter denoting the subtle, sneaking pursuit of some huge fish ; and reflections of white stars like dim water-lilies riding the polished ebony heave when it ran foamless. Even- ing after evening on such nights as these would Laura and I placidly step the deck together or sit watching the exquisite effects of moonlight on sail and cordage; ortherisingof the luminary above the black hm of ocean, with the tremble of the water in its light as though the deep thrilled to the first kiss of the moonbeams; gliding from one romantic fancy to another as tenderly as our keel floated over the long, drawn respirations of the deep. Indeed, •it"would come sometimes to my thinking that if the Bride were my yacht and Laura and 1 alone in her—with a crew to navigate the craft, to be sure—I should be veiy well satisfied to go on sailing about in- this fashion in these latitudes, under those glorious stars and upon these.warm and gentle seas, until she tired. In its serene moonlit moods the ocean possesses an incomparable aud amazing magic of spiritualising. The veriest common-place glows into poetic beauty under the mysterious, vitalising, enriching influence. I have seen a girl whom no exaggerated courtesy could have pronounced comely by daylight, show like an angel on the deck of a yacht on a hushed and radiant night -n-han-the air has been brimming to the stars with the soft haze of moonlight, and when the sea has resembled a carpet of . "black oik softly waving. The moon is a witch, and her pencils of light are charged -with magic qualities. In the soft golden effulgence my companion'^ - face would sometimes grow phantasmal, a "dream of girlish loveliness, the radiance 4>l her hair imdskinblendwgwitli the rich iHusivelight till. I would sometimes think if I should glance away from her and then look again, I should find her fairy countenance melted —a romantic confession that tells the-etory of my heart! Vcs, I was'far gone; no need to deny it. Our association was intimate to a degree that no companion- ship ashore could approach. Wilfrid left V? alone together for hour after hour, and there was nobody to intrude upon us. Finn clearly understood what was happening,'and sour old Crimp was always rarefol to leave us one side of the deck to ourselves. But there was now to happen a violent change—a transformation of peaceful, . amorous conditions of the right kind to affright romance and to drive the spirit of poetiy cowering out of sight. We were in latitude about eight degrees north; the longitude I do not remember. The night had been very quiet but thick; here and there a star that was a mere lustreless blur in the void, and the water black and sluggish as liquid pitch without a gleam in it. The atmosphere had been so sultry that I could get no rest. The yacht dipped drearily from side to side, shaking thunder out of her canvas and sending a«ound, like a low sobbing wail, off her sides into tlie midnight gloom. This prevented me from opening the scuttle, and 1 lay half stifled, occasionally • driven on deck by a sense of suffocation, though it was like passing from one hot room to another in a Turkish bath. There " was a barometer in the cabin just under the clock in the skylight; every time I quitted my berth I peeped at it, Mid every tame I looked I observed that the mercury had settled somewli.it. a very gradual but a'very steady fall. That foul weather was at hand I could not doubt, but it "was hard to imagine the character it would take down amongst these equatorial parallels, where one hardly looks for gales of wind or cyclonic outbursts, or the rushing tempest red with lightning -of ligh latitudes;, though every man who has crossed the Line will know that the ocean is as full of the unexpected thereabouts as in all other parts of the globe. I somehow have a clearer recollection of that night than of the time that followed, or, indeed, of any other passage of hours during this queer sea ramble I am writing about. It was first the intolerable heat, then the unendurably monotonous lifeless rolling of the yaclit, "with its regular accompaniment of the yearning wash of recoiling waters, the ceaseless and irritating clicking of cabin doors upon their hooks, the idle beating of canvas above hollowly penetrating the deck with a muffled echo as of constant sullen explo- \- sions, the creaking and straining to right and to left and above and below, a hot smell of paint and varnish and upholstery mingled with some sort of indefinable marine odour; a kind of faint- scent of rotting seaweed, such as will sometimes rise off the breast of the sluggish deep when stormy weather is at hand. I believe I drank not less tlm™ one dozen bottles of seltzer water in the small hours, I was half dead of thirst, and routed out -Hie steward and obliged him to supply me witfc a plentiful stock of this refreshment. ' Bjrt the more I drank the hotter I got, \- and no shipwrecked eye ever more gratefully saluted the grey of dawn than did mine when, wakening from a half-hour of feverish sleep, I beheld the light of morning, lying weak and lead-coloured on the glass of the porthole. An uglier jumble of sky I never beheld when I sent my first look up at it from the companion hatch. It was as though some - hundreds and thousands of factory chimneyB had been vomiting-- up their black fumes throughout the night, the bodies of vapour coming together over our mastheads and compacting there lumpishly amid the stagnant air with the livid tiiKkf^"^11 dimming into dusky browns ; and brae and there a sallow lump of gloom of the"k5ndt>fyellowish tinge to make one think of fire and thunder. The confines pf :this^hasl3y~«tonn-.laden pall drooped i"tfwffijjijjpnBMn Hiiw miles of the yacht, so t&aJttiieliorizon; seemed within cannon- Aot-^ poierging and minglingof stationary shadows whose stiHessness was rendered the more portentous by the sulky peasesoup oolduifeii ' welter of the ocean washing into the shrouded distance and \- M&nishing;^therTel All hands were Oil the alert. Whafwasto come, Finn told ihe, lie could not tell, "tout lie was ready for it.. His main topmast mas struck, that is, sent; down oil deck; he bid also sent down the copgallantyard. Every stitch of canvas was furled, saving the close reefed gaffforesail and the reefed stay foresail. . I&tra; lashings secured everything that was movable. Much to my satisfaction, r observed that he bad. struck the long gun forward downjtiolow. There was not a breath of wind as yet, and the yacht looked most forlorn and naked, as though, "indeed, she were fresh from s furious tussle" as she" roHed^buiying" tier sides upon the southerly swell t£at was growing s a t o w ^ Wc were at breaJSast VHSLI the first of ! w the wind took us. ^ It came ajoiig nioan- g Ing atfin^ sm^U dying away, and then a longer Trail as it poured hot as the breath of a furnace blast; between our masts. This was fpUoijraijbr^ 6ome five minutes of breathless calm, during which the yac^it fell off into ihetrpugli again; $hen, having my eye upotfa cabin window, I bawled ont, "There itjpomesy' seeing the flying wtufce line o|E it lifce aicloud of dusk, and before the Ifordii jw^^well^otS of my mouth the yacht was down to it, bowed to her bulwark rail, ereiy blessed article on the breakfast-table fetching away with a hideous crash upon the deck, with the figures of the two stewards reeling to leeward, myself gripping the table, Wilfrid depending wholly for support upon his fixed chair, and Miss Jennings buoying herself .off to-windward upon her outstretched arms with her face white with consternation. The uproar is not to be described. The voice of the gale bellowing through the gloom was a continuous note of thunder, and trembled npon the ear for all the "world as though it was the cannonading of some fierce electric storm. The boiling and hissing of the seas made one think of a sky full of water falling into the ocean. The yacht at the first going off was beaten down on to her broadside, and lay motionless, the froth washing over the rail; and the horror of that posture of seemingly drowning prostration, together with the fears it put into one, was prodigiously increased by the heavy blows of seas smiting the round of the hull to windward and bursting over her in vast bodies of snow. 33ut she was a noble sea boat, and was soon gallantly breasting the surge, but with a dance that rapidly grew wilder and wilder as the tempestuous music on high rang out more fiercely yet, until it became absolutely impossible to use one's legs. The sea rose as if by magic, and the slide of the hull down tile liquid heights, which came roaring at her from a very smother of scud and vapour and flying spray, gave her such a heel that every recovery of her for the next buoyant upwards flight was a miracle of resurrection in its way. The hatches were battened down, tarpaulins over the skylight, and as for some time the stewards were unable to light the lamp we remained seated in the cabin in a gloom so deep that we could scarcely discern one another's faces. Off the cabin deck rose a miserable jangling and clatter of broken crockery and glass and the like,. rolling to and fro with the violent movements of the yacht. For long while the stewards were rendered helpless. They swung by stanchions or held on grimly to seats, and it was indeed as much as their lives were worth to let go; for there were moments when the decks sloped like the steep roof of a house, promising a headlong fall to any one who relaxed his grip of a sort to break his neck or beat his brains out. At regular intervals the cabin portholes would turn blind to a thunderous rush of green sea, and those were moments, 1 vow, to drive a man on to his knees with full ctibviction that he would be giving up the ghost in a very little while ; for to these darkening, glimmering, green del agings the cabin interior turned a dead black as though it were midnight; down lay the yacht to the mighty sweeping curl of water; a shock as of the discharge of heavy artillery trembled with a stunning effect right through her to the blows of the tons upon tons of water which burst over the rail to the height of the crosstrees, falling upon the resounding deck from that elevation with a crash that made one think of the fabric having struck, followed on by a distracting sound of seething as the deluge, flung from side to side, boiled between the bulwarks. We had met with a few dustings before we fell in with this tempest, but nothing to zseaauii us for such an encounter as this. I made an effort after two hours of it tQ scramble on all-fours up the cabin ladder and te put my bead out through one or the companion doors. Such was the power of the wind that to the first protrusion of my nose I felt as if my face bad been cutoff as by a knife and swept overboard. The hurricane was as hot as though charged with fire; the clouds of foam blown off the sea, and whirling hoarily under the black vapour low down above our mastheads looked like steam boiling up off the hissing surface of the mighty ocean cauldron. I caught sight of a couple of fellows lashed to the wheel and the figure of Finn glittering black oilskins crouching aft under the lee of the bulwarks, swinging to a rope's end round his waist; but all forwards was haze, storms of foam, a glimpse of the yacht's bows soaring black and streaming, then striking down madly into a very hell of white waters which leapt upwards to the smiting of the structure in marble- like columns, round, firm, brilliant, like the stem of a waterspout, but with heads which instantly vanished in a smoke of crystals before tie shriek and thunder of the blast. The fragment of gaff foresail held bravely, dark with brine from peak to clew, with a furious salival draining of wet from the foot of it out of the hollow into which there was a ceaseless mad hurling of water. Heaven preserve me! Never could I have imagined such a sight as that sea presented. It might well have scared the heart of a far bolder man than ever I professed to be to witness the height and arching of the great liquid acclivities with their rage of boiling summits; the dusk of the atmosphere darkened yet by the flying rain of spume torn by the fingers of the storm out of ihe maddened waters; the ghastliness of the dissolving moimtains of whiteness glazing out into the wet and leaden shadow; the leaping of the near horizon against the thick gloom that looked to whirl like a teetotum, mingling scud and foam and hurtling billow into a sickening confusion of phantasmal shapes, a mad, chaotic blending of' vanishing and reappearing forms timed by the yell and hum of the gale sounding high abo7e the crash of the breaking surge and the shattering of wave by wave as though in very tram it fetched an echo of its own deafening roaring out of the dark sky rushing low over this tremendous scene of commotion. Whatever it might be that blew, whether a straight-lined hurricane or some wing of rotating storm, it lasted for three days; not, indeed, continuing the terrible severity with which it had set in, for we were all afterwards agreed that a few hours of the weight of tempest that had first sprung upon us must have beaten the yacht down to her grave by mere blows of green seas, let alone the addition of the incalculable pressure of the wind. The stay-foresail in one blast that caught the yacht when topping a sea was blown into rags, and whirled up into the dusk-like smoke. A fragment of headsail. was wanted, but whilst some men were clawing forwards to effect what was necessary the vessel shipped a sea that carried three of them' overboard like chips of wood, leaving the fourth stranded in the scuppers as far aft as Hie gangway with his neck aid both legs broken! We were but a small ship, and luxurious fittings counted for nothing in such a hellish tumblefication as that Wilfrid kept his berth neatly the whole time, having slightly sprained his ankle, which topped by the motion prohibited him from extending his leg by so much as a single stride. On tie other hand Miss Laura would not leave the cabin. 1 endeavoured to persuade her to take some rest in her bunk, but to no purpose. I did what I could to make her comfortable, crawled like a rat to ha berth, where I found her maid half dead with fright and nausea, procured a pillow, rugs and so forth, got her over, to the lee side, whore there was not much risk of her rolling off tie sofa, and snugged her to the best of my ability I sat with her constantly, said what I could to keep her np, procured food for her, fe& sleep at her side holding her hand, saw oller maid, and in a word acted the fort f a deroted lorcr. But heavenuLess^s^ hat a time .it was ! I would jsometimes onder whether if Ihe JSliark met with this ale, sfce had seawoithxnpss pnough tobut- live it. Occasionally Finn would arrive haggard, streaming, the completest figure imaginable of a tempest-beaten man and report of matters above; but I remember ishingjjiim aUthe deril when he told us j'tite.JpsS men;Sor a more dejwessingjjiieoe jK rows jsould not have' rented uskt suck's, time, and Miss Laura's Epifite seemed to jutbeSy bfiyfcdown imder,, it It was impossible to light tfee salley fire, and we had to subsist upon Se^remains of past cookery and on tinned food. However, Finn told us that on the evening of the first day of the gale the cook had fallen and broken two fingers of his right hand: so that could a fire have been kindled there was no one to prepare a hot meal for ns. .. But a little before eleven o'clock on.the night of the third day" the gale broke. I was sitting alongside of Miss Jennings in tiie cabin, with a plate of biscuit and ham on my knee, off which she and I . were making a lover's meal, I popping little picces into her mouth as she lay pillowed closeagainst my arm, then taking a snack myself, then applying a flask of sherry to her lips and finding the wine transformed into nectar by her kiss of the silver mouth of ihe flask. A steward sat crouching in the corner of the cabin; the lamp burned dimly, for there had been some difficulty in obtaining oil for it and the mesh was therefore kept low. Suddenly, I witnessed a flash of yellow moonshine upon the porthole directly-facing me, and with a shout of exultation I sprang to my feet, giving no heed to the plate that fell in a crash upon the deck, and crying 'out, '< Thawl.- God, here's fine weather coming at last!" I made a spring to the companionsteps, and hauled myself up through the hatch. It was a sight I would not have missed witnessing for much. The moon at that instant had swept into a clear space of indigo-black heaven; her light flashed fair upon the vast desolation of swollen waters; every foaming head of sea glanced with an ivory whiteness that by contrast with the black welter upon which it broke showed with something of the glory of crystalline snow beheld in sunlight; the clouds bad broken and were sailing across the sky in dense dark masses; it still blew violently, but there was a deep peculiar note in the roar of the wind aloft, which was assurance, positive to a nautical ear that the strength of the gale was exhausted, just as in a humming-top the tone lowers and lowers yet as the thing slackens its revolutions. By one o'clock that morning it was no more than a moderate breeze with a high angry swell, of which, however, Finn made nothing; for, after escorting Miss Jennings to her cabin, I heard them making sail on deck; and when, having had a short chat with Wilfrid, who lay in his bunk earnestly HianlHng God that the weather had mended, I went on deck to take a last look round before turning in, I found the wind shifted to west-north-west and the JBride swarming and plunging over the strong southerly swell under a whole mainsail, gaff foresail and jib, with hands sheeting home the square topsail, Crimp singing out in the waist, and Finn making a sailor's supper off a ship's biscuit in one hand and a cube of salt junk in the other by the light of the moon. (To be continued.)
