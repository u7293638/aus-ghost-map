? "HAMLET" AT THE THEATRE ROTAL.—There was a tolerably numerous and demonstrative audience last night at the Theatre, for Shakspeare's masterpiece generally attracts Adelaide playgoers. Mr. Leake's " Hamlet" is of the strictly conventional school, celebrated for its long-drawn portentous baBs- notes, scowls, and other unearthly vocal and facial spasms. The actirg of this gentleman's prototype was probably before Shakspearea mental vision when be wrote jHamlet's advice to the players, which, in the performance under review, sounded like a withering satire on Hamlet himself. Miss Mjra Kemble, who is a comely, gracefnl lady, to all appearance, has not yet been allotted any character calculated to display her capabilities. We trust that she will shortly have a better opportunity than was given her as Optelia. Mr. Sterling Wbyte in parts made a most acceptable Polonius, and fairly earned the lion's share ot the applause in the quibbling scenes with Hamlet. Mr. Vincent's ghost was in no way up to the standard of his generally excellent impersonations, and of those who filled up the remainder of the cut we can only say that they revelled in different degrees of badness. Bartley Campbell's successful drama, " My Partner," is to be produced this evening. GABMEB'S THBATBE.—There was an excellent attendance at this place of amusement on Friday evening to witness the views of the Zulu War. The recipient of the piano was Mrs. Ellis, of Bowden-on-the-Hill. There will be a matinee to-day.
