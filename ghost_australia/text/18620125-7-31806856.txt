OPENING OF BEAUMONT CONGRETATIONAL CHAPEL. On Tuesday evening, the last of the old year, the interesting ceremaony of opening a new Chapel at Beanmont took place. The building is situated in a most beautifull spot near Mr. Henry Giles house, on G-eeahiU, and not tar froo the _esid_?ce of the Hon. M. Daveaport. It ronmrtads a fine view of the sun-oonding aeeaery, sad else of the plain* aad the Gulf beyond. The Chapel-onuutes aboat 35 feet by 20, end 14 or 16 feet high, and is lighted by two lanriet-shaped windows oae__£h sat*. It a plastered and ceiled, and has a ____d_oo__> ventilator in the centre of the ceiling. Th__m is a convenient little vestry behind the chapd, sod the whole badding is very neatly finished. The opening was celebrated br a tea meeting, at which aboat 50 ar 60 persona wan present- A public meeting leUowad, and waa atte__led by nearly 90 persons The Key. T. Q Stow occupied the chair. The proceedings ware comineocel by the singing of the hymn "Jesus where'er thy people meet.** After which the Itev. C. W. Evan read put of the fijonh chapter of St. John's OauieL and o-fered prayer. The Chainaaa spoke of the kmd coaa- de-ation which had been shewn him by pla ing htm in a poaitioa where ha would have nothing to do. He mujh-, however, perhaps be allowed to glance hade a few years aa it was sometimes pleasant to keep alive the memory of old times. He them took a brief retrospect of bis visits to that i etghbotheod cou___9tic__g 22 years ago The chapel was sot intended to be brought at present in'o ! fgll use for regular services ou the Sabbath, b t pro bably there would be preaching, though tiie main ob ject at pmnnl oou'eniplated was the instruction ot tbe children of the neighborhood." already it might he said of that little place that it was like Mount Zion, for it waa truly " *-—-?*?s*?i for situation,*' even if it could not he called "the joy of the whole earth." He trusted that the _*?"S-g of God would rest upon it. Mr. Henry Giles being called on to make the *_*r*-~-* etattment, said that the want et a place for worship in that neighborhood had ]oog been felt, and it was desired to erect one. ; bot the weat of fends was a great difficulty. At last Mr. Alexander Hay, M.P., offix-d £10% and having > re^eifed some fi_rt___sr oSws of aw?Jstnnre ibey com SMoeed. The total coat of the building was aboat £339 ot which they had received £225 and £25 more had been i—-"??"?< which they expected noon to receive. Mr. 1 James Smith had kmdiy given the land. Tbe amount das ts the *___n___n_-er was £83 Ba, and to the contractor i £30. They had ao seats at present bet-aging to the ?bee; it was S-timated tbey would east £70. The ?cv. i W.

Thenoveliy i <_f t__eth__gh__dnot worn off and he waa very p'?v?ed to . be pit wit ea that occasion. The first opening of a Chapd at wbssh faaaasisted was at tint noUe edifice in Berth Adelaide where the Bey. James Jefiaris preached; Im was not aware ofthe exact cost of that building, bot be knew tit was a noble example of what oookl bo done by tbe *_-oh_D-__y principle. Tbe next place at the opening efwtneh be was present was that built for Mr. Howie at Me> area Vaie. Taathad cost £1,200 or £1,300. and in iia internal fittings it was the prettiest Chapel be had aeea in the eofeny ; the other Chapels to which ha re ferred were (Jawfer. Angsstna, each of which had coat aboat £l£oo, Aldinga, and now Beaumont. Besides tiaeao the foo___?__i_m atooea of two more had been laid, one where their excellent friend Mr. Coat waa te pn__li in Hiadaranh-afuare, aad the Other was at Port Elliot. Tbe Chairaiaa h-ul just re minded him of a third, that it Kadrna, which would abatt y be ooeaed. Daring the same period three Coo- HJHal_?ill ??_____?_? had arrived from England, him meat, Mr. Morgan WiHiaais of Kapunda, ani Mr. Hoar dee of Gawler, and there were now altogether net less than thirty Congregational ministers in the colony, so that oa the whole ne (taught it a very encouraging state of things. If ?-.?'*???"& more was done io that building thaa mali acting children ia the right way, that would he a good thing; but he thought that come of the dor mant talent fir preaching, which existed in many of their enugiegation-, sfaoaU be brought out. It was im portant in the eoloay that "all the Lord's people afcrnM be prophets," aad there need be no lade of persona ta conduct tlie services of his house, do Rev. C Manthorpe was reminded, when he saw tbat f h*p^. of a remark which waa recently made to bim by a frnui, tm reading in an EaeKsh paper the ?ceomit of a apkad-d chapel in the old country. "Ah, dr," be aaal, " it's a proof of the degeneracy of the people's feelings is the eaase of God when they baUd ti-Bse fae shapeb;" he thought that fault could not be ____ te the people of Be- iamout. He lik-d to be prac tical ia his remarks, and h^ would therefore urge oe them the Importance of opening tiie place free from debt, ____ to be regular in timr attendance in the preaching of the gospel there. He was glad also to hear a that tbe instruction of children was a great otjoct wfa_eh they bad ia view; he hoped they wouli be earnest in tbe good work. Mr. Barnes then spofc farieAy, aUudiag to the —ritea which had for come time part boon hdd ia tiie neighboring village of Burn sfcfe. He st.toJ tbey had tbere aboat 50 children assembled far inatmctioa oa tbe Sabbath, bot they now proposed to gi*reap their services in favor of the present movement, which be earnestly wished God speed- "Hie Bey.

Thoy felt loth to dreg Church matters into a Court of I .w, aad he hoped after speak ing of it as he had that the party be referred to would take the hint and pay that which he was leg Uy and moraUy bound to pay. Mr. Hancock had behaved in a very different way, having lest than £190 without interest. Mr. Bagot also had given them a iiberal donation, and lent them £S0 without interest. Other friends had helped them, and they hoped that those present would follow their good example and do what they could to reduce the debt that evening. The choir then sung **Before Jehovah's awful throne." The Bey. E. K.

He referred to the former state of tiie neighborhood, and said that sinoe he had Uved there no less than tea chapels had been erected. But as tbe time was advancing, aad he had no doubt many were carious to leave, and yet were unwilling to do so without contributing their mite to tiie collection, be would not detain them longer, but would caU on the choir to sing the anthem " Lord of aU power and might" while the collection was bring made. This heing don., votes of thanks were awarded to Mr. and Mrs. And-ewartha, for their fc-n-lness in granting the use of the section; to the ladies, for providing the tea; to Mr. Ind, for the loan of his harmouiu.u; and to Hr.

GERMAN EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH. —Tbe foundation stone of a church in connection with the German Evangelical Lutheran Church was laid in Pirie-street on thursday. the 26th December. The church is a smail one, nevertheless we are informed when completed will be quite large enough to accom modate those attending it. The proceedings com menced by the pastor of the church, the Rev. Chris tian Maschmidt giving out the 84th Psalm; after which tbe hymn "Come hither you Christians joyfully." Prayer being offered up by Mr. Bechtel, of North Ade laide, Mr. Gaedechens advanced, and placed beneath the foundation stone a bottle containing the daily papers and the following document. "This German Lutheran Community was founded in the year 1847 by the late Rev. Friedrich Barchelt. After having for nine years devotedly filled his office, be died 28th August, 1856. Aa his successor, Johann Christian Maschmidt was appointed 2nd June, 1857. The foun dation-stone was laid by Mr. A. Gaedechens on the -26th December, 1861. The clergyman of this community is Johann Christian Maschmidt. The Churchardens are Messrs. Conrad Bechtel and George Grosse. The Trus tees aro Messrs. Heinrich Gr gmann, August Baigelt, Wilhelm Bruggeman, Wilhelm Bresser, David Diedrich, George Klemland, George Grosse, Christian Maschwid, and Conrad Bechtel. The church was built by Messrs J. Baur and Chamnswood." The stone was then laid by Mr. Gaedechens, who, in doing so, said—" ln the faith of Jesus Christ we place the foundation stone of the Evangelic Lutheran Church, in the name of God the Father, the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. Amen." He said he bad been desired by their worthy clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Maschmidt and several members of their community, to lay the foundation stone of the German Lutheran Church; he had accepted that desire with plea sure, yet regretting that their choice had not fallen upon one more worthy than himself. He sincerely re gretted that, in consequence of the departure of the English mail, he had not been able to give the subject tbat attention which it deserved, aud must apologize for not being better prepared. He only hoped and trusted that the building just commenced would progress rapidly under God's blessing, and with the help of so many friends, both absent and present, aad that ere long that they might again assemble there for Divine service ; the young to be instructed, the afflicted to be comforted, and that in common prayer we may rise their hearts to God, and so give way to the more sacred feelings of friendship and love towards each other. He hoped that the erection of that church might be the means of his countrymen meeting more frequently together for religious purposes, and so strengthen the tie of brother hood. They aught to be pleased to see so many of their English friends amongst them, whether they took a put in the ceremony or not. In conclusion he would say might the erection of that | humble church prove a great blessing to the city, The above speech was given first in the German aad after ' wards in the English language by the speaker. The Rev Mr. Kean next addressed those assembled, and said for many years those who were instrumental in laying the foundarion-stone of that church had met for Divine Worship in the Bible Christian Chapel, Young-street, Adelaide. They professed the same doctrines as all the Evangelical Churches, and he was happy to see them commencing to build a church for themselves. It was smail no doubt compared to the other churches around it, yet when completed it would bo free from debt. Tbe Rev. Mr. Maschmidt next gave an address in the German language ; we were informed that he thanked his English friends for the accommodation they had given his congregation for many years, by permitting them to assemble in one of their churches. He thanked God for allowing them the opportunity of erecting a building for themselves, and concluded by saying that he hoped it would be the means of drawing many of his countrymen together, in order to return thanks for the many manifold blessings they constantly received at His hands, The Te Deum in German was next sung, after | which preyer was offered, and those assembled, about 200, dispersed.
