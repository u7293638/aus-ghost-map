THE JEWELLED SKULL A ROMANCE FROM A DETECTIVE'S CASEBOOK. BUSILY engaged one morning in my office in trying to solve some knotty problems that called for my earnest atten tion, I was suddenly disturbed by a knock at the door, and, in answer to my ' Come it ;' one of my assistants entered, although I had given strict orders that I was not to be disturbed for two hours. ' Excuse me, sir,' said my man, but a gentleman wishes to see you, and will take no denial.' ' I thought I told you not to disturb me under any circumstances,' I replied some what tartly. ' Yes, so you did. But the gentleman insists upon seeing you. He says his busi ness is most urgent.' ' Who is he?' ' Here is his card, sir.' I glanced at the card the assistant handed to me. It bore the name — Colonel Maurice Odell, The Star and Garter Club. Colonel Maurice Odell was an utter stranger to me. I never heard his name before; but I knew that the Star and Garter Club was a club of the highest rank, and that its members were men of position and eminence. I therefore considered it probable that the Colonel's business was likely, as he said, to be urgent, and I told my assistant to show him in. A few minutes later the door opened, and there entered a tall, thin, wiry-looking man, with an unmistakable military bearing. ' Pardon me for intruding upon you, Mr. Donovan,' he eaid, bowing stiffly and form ally, 'but I wish to consult you about a very important matter, and, as I leave for Egypt to-morrow, I have very little time at my disposal.' 'lam at your service, Colonel,' I replied, as I pointed to a seat. ' I will be as brief as possible,' he began, as he placed bis highly polished b*t and his umbrella on the the table. 'I am a military man. and have spent much of my time in India, but two years ago I returned home, and took up my residence at the Manor, Bsher. Twice since I went to live there the place has been robbed in a somewhat mj'sterious manner. The first occasion was a little over a year ago, when a number of antique silver cups were stolen. The Scot land Yard authorities endeavoured to traca the thieves, bus failed.' ' I think I remember hearing something about that robbery,' I remarked, as I tried to recall the details. ' But in what way was it a mysterious one ? ' ' Because it was impossible to determine how the thieves gained access to the house. Thf- place had not been broken into.' ' How about j*our servants ' I asked. ' Oh, I haven t a servant who is?nTt honesty it-self.' ' Pray proceed. What about the second robbery ? ' 'That is what I have come to you about. It is a very serious business indeed, and has been carried out in the mysterious way that characterised the first one.' ' ' You mean it is serious as regards the value of the property stolen ? ' ' In one sense, yes ; but ifc is some thing more than that. During- my stay in India I rendered very considerable service indeed to the Rajah of Mooltan, a man of great wealth. Before I left India he presented me with a souvenir of a very extraordinary character. It was nothing more nor less than the skull of one of his ancftstnrs '' ' Excuse me, Colonel, but you can hardly expect me to devote my energies to tracing this somewhat gruesome souvenir of yours, which probably the thief will hasten to bury as speedily as possible, unless he happens to be of a very morbid turn of mind.'' ' You are a little premature,' said the Colonel, with a. suspicion of sternness. ' That skull has been valued at upwards of £12,000. '* Twelve thousand pounds !' I echoed, as my interest in my visitor deepened. m' Yes, sir ; twelve thousand pounds. It is fashioned into a drinking goblet, bound with solid gold banrls, and encrusted with precious stones. In the bottom of the goblet, inside, is a diamond ot the purest water, and which alone is said to be worth two thousand pound?'. My friend the Rajah told me that if ever I parted with it, or it was stolen, ill fortune would ever after wards pursue me.' ' But you say you leave for Egypt to morrow ?' ' Yes. And shall probably be absent six months.' ' Then I had better travel down to Esher at once.' I retired to my sanctum and reap peared in a few minutes in the cha racter of a venerable parson. As it ?was important that none of the house hold should know that I was a detective, I begged that he would introduce nie as the Rev. John Marshall, and then we took the train down to Esher. I found that besides the eoblefc some antique rings and a few pieces of gold and silver had been carried oft'. The lost skull had been kept under a glass shade in what the Colonel called his ' Treasure Chamber.' It was a small room lighted by an oriel window. The walls were wainscoted half way up, and the upper part was hung with tapestry. The Colonel assured me that; the door of this room was always kept locked, and the key was never out of his possession. The lower part of the chimney of theold- fashioned fireplace I noticed was protected by iron bars let into the masonry, so that the thief, 1 was sure, did not come down the chimney ; nor did he come in at the windo , for it only opened at each side, and the apertures were so small that a child could not have squeezed through. Nevertheless the thief had suc ceeded in getting into the room. How did he manage it ? That was the problem I had to solve, :and that done I felt that I should be able to get a clue to the robber. I found the Colonel's family consisted of his wife — an Anglo-Indian lady — three charming daughters, his eldest son, Ronald Odell, a young man about 24, and a younger son, a. youth of .12. The family were waited upon at table by two parlourmaids, the butler, aud a page-boy. The butler was an elderly, sedate, gentlemanly-looking- man ; the boy had an open, frank face, and the same remark applied to the two girls. As I studied them 1 saw nothing calculated to raise my suspicions in any way. Indeed, I t'elt instinctively that I could safely pledge myself for their honesty. Ronald Odell was a most extraordinary looking young fellow. He had been born and brought up in India, and seemed to suffer from an unconquerable lassitude that gave him a lifeless, insipid appearance. He was very dark, with dreamy, languid eyes, and an expressionless face of a peculiar sallowness. He was tall and thin, with hands that were most noticeable, owing- to the length, flexibility, and thinness of the fingers. He sat in the chair with his body huddled up as it were ; his long legs stretched straight Out before him ; his pointed chin resting on his chest, while he' Eeemed to smoke his cigar as if unconscious of what he was doing. Having passed the household in review without result, I requested that I might be allowed to spend a short time alone in the room from whence the s^ull had been stolen. The floor was polished and immov able, but a part qf the wainscoting gaye back a hollow sound to my raps, and Iwis of opinion that the room had been entered byaBecretdoqr. Although convinced &jat; the panel which gave bac£ the hallow squ. ml was a door, I could detect no means of oneo^ ing it. ^ On rejoining the 0Qlon.el, t asked to be allowed carte. Wancie ia the matter, ana t^ he granted? - .-,'??? I told him that many, things necessarily ?eemed extraordinary wjjen the reasons for them wore na% Wiwierstood, and with th& teniatfc 1 took my departure, having pro mised the Colonel to do' every thine, mental mm gwuh «v to rmm &« lo§t «ksil% Three datf* 'later i ' went' down vo Uni, Manor disguised hs a working : vWbor, ? aw. ?was T admitted without any difficulty. A* n servant was showing we upstairs to the . to|, ading, where a trap-door in the ceiling -ave access to the leads, I passed BpnaM Odell on the stairs. He was attired m a long ressimr-gown, had Turkish slippers on his eet a fez on his head, and a cigar in his mouth, from which he was puffing great volumes of emoke. His face was almost ghastly in its pallor, and his eyes had the same dreamy look which I had noticed on my first visit. His hand* were thrust deep m his pockets, and his movements and manner were snggestive of a person walking in his sleep, rather than a waking conscious man. This suggestion was heightened by the fact that before I could avoid him he ran full butt againstme, That,however,seemedto partially arouse him from the lethargic condition, and turning round, with a fierceness of expression that I scarcely deemed him capable of, he exclaimed— ' You stupid fool, why don't you look where you are going to ? '' I muttered out an apology, and lie strode down the stairs growling to himself. My object in going on to the roof was to see if there was any communication between there and the ' Treasure Chamber.' I noticed a trap door between two chimney stalks, but found it fastened. So after a time I went back and inquired of the servant where the communication with the other trap door was. She conducted me to the lumber room, which she assuied me was haunted, and there left me at the door, sayinsr, 'There you are, but I amt a-going in. ? The room was in total darkness, but having procured a candle I commenced to explore. It was filled with a miscellaneous collection of lumber. A flight of steps led to the trap door I had noticed on the roof, but I found they had not been trodden on for a very long time. The walls of the room were wainscoted. Goi^sr down on my knees I examined the floor with a magnifying glass, and detected footmarks made by slippered feeb that led to one particular corner of the room. This was very suggestive, and on raDDinff the wainscot in that part found it was hollow. Unconsciously I touched s spring in the woodwork, and the door swung open. By the light of the candle I discerned the head of a flight of steps built in the thickness of the wall. I saw unmistakable traces of the slippered feet on the steps as I descended. I reached the bottom, and found further progress barred by a door that w;*s without handle or lock ; but. after some time. I dis covered a small wooden knob sunk in the woodwork at the side, and, pressing this, the door, -with almost absolute noir=ele.-?s?icss, slid back, and lo ! the ?' Treasure Chamber '? mtis revealed. In the face of this di-covery, I no longer entertained a doubt that- the thief had entered the room by means of this secret passage. And there was no one in the whole household upon whom my suspicion* fixed with the exception of Ronald Odell. If my assumption that he was the thiet w;i- correct, the mystery was so far explained : and my next step was to discover why he had robbed his father, and what he had done with the property. He was so strange and peculiar that somehow I could not imagine that* he had stolen the things merely for the sake of vulgar gain, my impression being that in carrying off the jewelled skull he was actuated by some extraordinary motive, quite apart from the mere question of theft, and this determined me to shadow him for a time in the hope that I should succeed in soon obtaining dis tinct evidence that my theor3' was correct. Before leaving t-he house. I sought an interview with Mr.*. Odell, who was anxious to know what the result was of my investi gation : but I considered it advisable, in trie then state of matters, to withhold from her the discovery I had made. Hut, as her curiosity to learn what Iliad been doing on the roof was very great, I informed her that my theory was at first that there was some connection between the roof and the 'Treasure Chamber'; but, though I had not proved that to be correct, I nevertheless was of opinion that the purloiner of the articles resided in the house. Whereupon she very naturally asked me if I suspected any particular person. I answered her candidly that I did ; but that, iu the absence of anything- like proof, I should not be justified in naming anyone. I assured her, however, that I would use the most strenuous efforts to obtain the proof I wanted. Before leaving her, I remarked in a casual sort of way — ' I suppose Mr. Ronald is at the head of affairs during: his father's absence ?' ' Well,' she began, with evident reluct ance to say anything aeainst her son, ' Ronald is of a very peculiar disposition. He seems to live quite within himself, as ic were, and takes no interest in anything. As a matter of fact, I see very little of him, for he usually spends his evenings from home, and does not return until late. The greater parG of the day .^je keeps no hi.-= rooms. I am sure I am quite concerned about him at times.' It fell to my lot to solve this mystery a week later. I shadowed, him to a bouse situated in' a cul de sac in the very heart of the city of London. I ascertained the house was in the occupation of a club consisting of Anglo Indians. The premises were in charge of a Hindoo and his wife, and the members of the club met on an average five nights a week. All this was so roach more mystery, but it was precisely in accord with the theory I had been working out in my own mind. The next afternoon I went to the house, and the door was opened to my knock by the Hindoo woman, who was a. mild-eyed, sad-looking little creature ; I asked her if she could give me some particulars of t-he club that was held there, and she informed me that it was known as ' The Indian Dreamers' Club.' But beyond that scrap of information she did not seem disjwjsed to go. ' iou had better come when my husband is here,' she said, thereby giving me to understand that her husbaud was absent. But as I deemed it- probable that she might prove more susceptible to my persuasive influences than her husband, I asked her if she would allow me to see over the premises. She declined to do this until I displayed before her greedy eyes certain gold coins of the realm, which proved too much for her cupidity, and she consented to let me go inside. The entrance - hall was carpeted with a thick, massive carpet, and the walla were hung with black velvet* A strange, sickening odour pervaded the air. I passed through a curtained doorway into an exten sive apartment that ran the whole depth of the building. Daylights being excluded, the light was obtained from a large lamp of blood-coloured glass, and which depended from the centre of the ceiling. There was also a niche at each end of the room, where a lamp of the old Roman pattern burnt. The walls of the room were hung with purple velvet curtains, and the ceiling was also draped with the same material, while the floor was covered with a rich Indian carpet into which the feet sank. In the cenfereof the room vras a table covered with velvet, and round the room were most luxurious couches. The same sickly odour pervaded this remarkable chamber, which was like a tomb in its silence, On the velvet on one side of .the room was inscribed in letters of gold tins sentence : ' T« Drsam is to Live ! Dream ok, for to Awaken b so Dik i While stilt engaged in examining the «oom « bell ratag, and instantly the Hindoo woman becamegreatly excited, for shesaid it was her husband, «nd tbkfe he would be so angry if he fpund me that she would nofc be responsible for the consequences. She therefore thrust me mtoj a recess. Is othtagr could have happened better, for I was tesofred to remain uxm? tSZSSESgp m l « !-** -* bera iof the club met at seven o'clock.
