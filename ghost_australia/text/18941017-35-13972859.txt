It will be to his gain in this, that it disarms, if it does not put out of the field, the loss of tenderers who make proposals which they cannot fulfil by honest work, and who calculate on saving themselves by putting in inferior work obtained at the hands of any unfortunates whom they may be able to find compelled by their necessities to work for anything they can get. And it will be further to his gain in that he can more exactly forecast what the work will actually cost him, without the likelihood of his being thrown out of his calculations, and stopped during the course of the work, by strikes. The only party that might seem to be placed at disadvantage is the public, which has to pay for under such conditions the lowest tender will not be as low as it might have been under the freer conditions of the past; and if it is so, of course the taxpayer must make good the difference. But even in this the disadvantage may be only apparent. For assuming always that the scale is fixed at current wages, true value is more likely to be obtained for the payments made, and an appreciable gain comes of the probability, amounting almost to a certainty, that the work will be carried out without obstruction and delay from difficulties with labour. It is true that, even though current wages are contracted for and paid, the workmen will still have it in their power to strike for an increase of wages. But the probabilities of such a convulsion in the labour market can generally be foreseen, and unless the course of the contract is a very prolonged one, the difficulty is more likely to show itself at the initiation of a public work, and to be provided for or adjusted before the contract is signed and the work begun. Of course it is impossible to absolutely provide against a future contingency, but the system is likely to give more steadiness to the standard rate of wages, and any question arising as to increase or decrease will be fought out in some other way rather than in an abrupt suspension of work. It is easy to understand that even so the question may crop up in an objectionable form, and it is among the disadvantages of this scheme that the rate of wages may be mixed up with politics, andthoMinistor for Works may be called on in his place in the House to meet motions of adjourn- ment, and in his Department to resist political and personal pressure, to induce him to overrule the board of reference and raise the rate of wages for Government contracts. This probably, is the greatest risk the scheme will have to encounter and while open tendering enabled the Minister to stand aloof as having nothing to do with the payments given by contractors, he may find it added to his embarrassments that he may have to face a vote of the House as to the prices which he is to put into his contract schedules. The reduction in the rate of wages, should it at any time necessary, will entail a greater difficulty still and though the Minister will probably shelter himself behind the board of. reference, it is doubtful if he fully realises the trouble in store for him arising out of the necessary fluctuations of the labour market. The schedule already submitted by the board we may assume to be intended for the immediate present. It wisely fixes a minimum based on the minimum ruling in the open market, so that a large class of what might be called inferior workmen may not be shut out of vom employment, but, working on that scale, may give as good value for the money as better workmen who are obtaining the higher rate of wages. But it remains to be seen how long political influence will be content with tolerating a scale of wages based on the wages current for the lowest class of workmen. So long as the current minimum is fixed, the best class of workmen will probably obtain much higher wages from the contractors, and in proportion to their value, otherwise they will seek employment outside of Government work. But the ghost of trouble looms up in the distance, when it will be asserted that this minimum scale puts it into the power of contractors to bring down good men to inferior men's wages, and a demand will be made to schedule a scale that will protect also the better class of workers. No doubt the Minister for Works has prepared himself for all these difficulties in the coming time, and the experiment can only be determined by results. That the scheme, if fairly carried out, will go a long way in preventing sweating, by sub-contracts or otherwise, is among its prospective advantages. It is, for the most part, inferior workers only that are sweated and as the conditions of contract, applying equally to sub-contracts, will prevent any work being done at below a minimum scale, even the unfortunates will be held from giving their drudgery below its worth. If the scheme of the Minister for Works, which is based on that of the London County Council, does so much, it will be worth a fair trial. But the fear is that it will be expected to do much more, and much that will be neither good for labour nor for the general interests of the State. In discussing the shearing troubles when they were at an acuib stage, we pointed out how much was to be expected from a waiting policy. The events of the intervening period, as they stand recorded in our columns by telegrams from the districts affected, and by the announcement of the Pastoralists' Union in Sydney, amply confirm this prognostication. What has happened is that except in very few instances violence has defeated itself, and that exhaustion is the penalty of misjudged exertion. It would be matter for regret if this defeat had come upon an endeavour to secure an equitable relation between the owners and the shearers of sheep ; but it cannot be held that the agreement of 1894 being an equitable relation. So much is proved by the fact that very many sheds have been worked under it to the end of the shearing without friction. And whether the matter in dispute was worthy of the combatants, it certainly must be said that many of the men made the industrial war a good deal like civil war. in more than a few instances they fought in such a way as to alienate public sympathy, or even public toler- ance. That is the blunder which is also a crime, for every strike to be even partially successful must in the last analysis rest upon public opinion. And now our news for some time past shows that the end has well-nigh come. Camp after camp has broken up, and these the most influential and if here and there a few dissatisfied men have made a centre for the non-contents, it does not seem to have attracted many. Park camp disbanded, leaving the Peak Hill trades- men £15 on the wrong side of the ledger. Nyngan camp was broken up for want of funds. At Inverell and later at Grenfell the shearers dispersed, it may be assumed, from the Uko cause. At yet another centre of the strike the camp consisted of one shearer amongst a dozen or more of nondescripts The result is that wherever there still remains shearing to be done so many men are offering that the Pastoralists' Union is no longer under the necessity of sending up labourers A message from the North said that throughout the Tamworth and the Upper Hunter districts local shearers offer freely Nay more, men who have been strongly unionist make no hesitation about signing the 1891 agreement That willingness to take work on the top ins offered by the sheepowners all along is not the note of the situation All this is satisfactory if it were only an assurance that the work still to be done will proceed in an orderly and quiet course The getting of the fleece of the sheep's back and away to market is of the first importance, and whatever interferes with that affects materially the chief interests, industrial and financial, of the country It may also be thought that the lesson of this season will not be thrown away, and that a better understanding will mark the opening of the shelling next year To this and the trial of strength now closing will not fail of effect It is also good to have the evidence that the terms proffered by the employers were not in equitable or unworkable, and that they might have been accepted by the shearers much earlier without harm A movement is observed in Victorian pastoral districts to repeat the resistance which has failed in New South Wales, but circumstances do not promise that the attempt will be any more successful Another impression to be derived from the course of this conflict is that industrial disputes can of ton be best left to themselves. The ordeal may be severe for those who plunge without hesitation into strikes, but that is inevitable There is no fund of altruism with which to prevent men suffering who go to warfare without counting the cost A notable feature of the present industrial situation is the abundance of schemes propounded on all sides for reconciling the conflicts between the employer and the employed Goodness of intention is not to be denied to those interesting themselves in those schemes, but the want of substantial success is not wholly a misfortune, seeing that the world of labour has more to gain by learning how to avoid conflict than how to modify its evils and shorten its duration once it has begun, through unwisdom on one side or on both sides The necessity for those panaceas, the rival claims of which begin to be confusing, would disappear in all but the very few cases, provided that people involved would take the pains to estimate forces and reckon not only the possible gains of success, but also the inevitable penalties, immediate and o\ ontual, of failure This is obvious , but in the confidence of discovering short and easy w n 3 with the opposite side there is a tendency to cross the industrial Rubicon and then seek legal machinery for extrication An industrial community like ours has a good deal to lose by anything that encourages a contentious disposition As for the office of legislative machinery in the labour world, some weighty words were recently addressed to the National Bar Association of the United States by a prominent American Judge Mr T M COOLEY, in doing ing his official address to that body of sailors, dwelt mainly upon the labour troubles of the country. Compulsory arbitration, he declared, had most serious obstacles After discussing chiefly such safeguards as contracts or specific stipulations in agreements (which he i (recommended, and which our shearers have), he convened that legislation must always fall far short of adequate provisions for the disagreements. between capital and labour It is true that he accompanies this admission with the remark that while legal difficulties in the way of a complete remedy will remain, and will be serious at almost every point, the very knowledge that they exist will emphasise the need of precautions to pre- sent a resort to violent measures when arbitration is inadequate, and to give additional force to the public opinion, winds vi ill look with emphatic disfavour upon any refusal of arbitration when that seems a suitable and sufficient remedy for alleged w songs the situation in Afghanistan promises to add to the political complications of the time, the precarious state of the Axil-it's health affording a prospect of another of those wars of succession which have so commonly kept the country in a state of turmoil and imperilled the real natures of greater powers ADam RIMAN KHAN, the present man, is supposed to be a faithful ally of England, his Lordship being stimulated by a pension of £160,000 a year, and the cordial reception given by him last year at Cabul to the British Envoy, Sir MouriMEL DURAND, has been regarded as evidence that he really regards the British Indian connection as a guarantee of his safety from Russian aggression Though he reigns over the most turbulent laces perhaps in the world, he has managed for some fourteen or fifteen years to hold his own against intrigues and revolts and his continuance of reign might fairly be regarded as a continuance of ot Afghanistan as a friendly State to India, and a buffer between it and the aggressive advances of the Russians in Asia Insecuio, however as his tenure must have been always over tubes that are only kept in obedience by 'operated suppression of their using, the cases would be reached by his death, which is certain to open the floodgates of civil strife, and restore the wild moan miners to their normal condition of internecine war Already two rival sons of the dying AWEEII have started for the throne, and appearances go to show that events will hardly wait for his death till Afghanistan is again convulsed with strife The excuse that this would give to Russia in the north forinteiforenoo over the border, and the necessity imposed on England to restore order in a State in which it has such a stir allege interest, make the position an anxious one, and as the ailment of the Afghan ruler appears to be of a fatal character, we may not improbably see the revival of the Afghan question shortly man aggravated form The necessity of a scientific and defensible frontier to India makes the condition of Afghanistan always of the first moment in England, and the events of the next few days or weeks in the sick "lam- ber in the palace at Cabul, and then consequences throughout the wild and turbulent State, may be watched with interest as involving issues of a momentous kind to the whole British Empire. The meeting at Government House in support of the fund for providing allowances to the families of firemen who may lose their lives whilst engaged in duty shows that the sympathy excited by the case of Pa oman By TOWN IS still keen That case proved that the emergency had not been duly considered, for no fund ousted out of which relief might have been devoted to the bereaved family. Accordingly there was an immediate endeavour to raise an amount sufficient for this regrettable charge A public meeting decided upon appealing to the people, subscriptions wore no calved, and a number of agencies for collecting money were set at work But even at an early stage a resolution was arrived at which may affect the progress of the fund That was to make the movement wide enough to embrace as well as BROWN'S case all similar cases in future Much can be said for this decision It is when the public heart and conscience are touched that large plans of Konoye hence become practicable, and the one instance that brings home to the community the perilous character of this service does more to help success than the chance of many like mishaps But there is something to be said for treating the present case as a special call upon the public, in the service of which BnoMTs died as fully as any soldier upon a field of battle This view, apparently, is the one which has most popular favour, and it may be feared that in a well-intended attempt to organise the larger scheme the more particular and an easing occasion runs some risk of missing support This should not be Whatever may be done ultimately for the ti solo class, nothing is more clear than that BRO WA's family has the first and chief claim upon the fund If the liberality of the public reaches far enough to endow a permanent fund, so much the better , but if not, then those who have taken up the matter may profitably learn a lesson from the National Shipwreck Relief Society, which, benefiting by the donations of the benevolent and the subscriptions of the seafaring class, manages to provide reasonably for all distressed seamen, those who have aided the society having the prior claim upon its relief Cannot something of that kind be organised for the firemen of New South Wales, a smaller body, but one of specialty meritorious claims ?
