the light that cast no shadow. Curious stories are told about the powers possessed by certain natives of India, who live up among the Himalaya mountains. These old men, it is said, have devoted scores of years to the study of natural laws and forces, which the rest of the world knows nothing about. Lately a German professor visited the "adepts," as these queer Hindus are called, for the pupose of finding out the secret of their remarkable performances. They treated him rather scurvlly, but interested him all the same. One day the professor wanted to ex amine some ancient Sanskrit manuscripts. An adept went with him to a cave wherein the books were kept. The place was dark as the bottom of a well. "I can't see to read here," said the visi tor. "Then we will have some light," was the reply, and immediately (the professor says) a soft, pearly light brightened the cave. He could not tell whence it came, but he noticed that it had one strange quality— it cast not the slightest shadow. This is a story hard to believe, yet its truth is affirmed by a man of vast learning and high character, and you who now read it have no reason for doubt except that all the lights you have seen have east shadows. Belief or unbelief commonly riius parallel Willi one's own experience. Dr Johnson sniffed at the ac count of the Lisbon earthquake, yet credited the tale of the Cock Lane ghost. A man who has been ill for years, and failed to find a cure, is sceptical when friends tell him of a medicine which they believe will make him well. What else but doubt could result from his experience? Take an ex ample: — "In Hie spring of 1888," writes our corres pondent. "1 fell into a low, weak, and languid slate. I felt low-spirited, and out of sorts. At first my stomach was deranged, my appe tite poor, and after eating I had' pain and weight at the chest.

There is a deal of difference between Mr Grif fith s candid letter, and the story about the liglit that cast no -shadow. Tlic latter may be true enough, but it cannot be verified without more trouble than it is worth. On the other hand, we have a trustworthy witness, who will answer letters of Inquiry, and can be found at ' his address. Finally, there is nothing mystic or magical about Mother Seigel's Curative Syrup. It acts on the theory that most ailments are but symp toms, forms, or phases of that universal dis- ease-mdigestion and dyspepsia; it cures that and throws the light of health and happiness over hearths and homes where illness and pain had cast such dark and terrifying sha dows. And that is why people believe all that is told of its success by eager witnesses.
