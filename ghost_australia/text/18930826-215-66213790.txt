Sonnet-Twilight. The primrose shades of twilight softly fall Upon the world, weaving strange mys teries Of ghostlike shadow all about the trees, Beneath the old high red brick garden wall, Like fair mute spirits, stand the lillies tall, E'en as they yearned for speech. No sound is heard Save the faint bleat of sheep, and one lone bird That o'er the moorland sends its plaintive "call Those faint, sweet echoes of the louder day ! From this hard world thou call'st us aye away Into the precincts of that shadow land, 'Where time rolls swiftly back at thy com' mand, And where, in the old likeness that they wore, Dear absent faces smile on us once more. -M.C.C.
