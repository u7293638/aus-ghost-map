By L. 0 The town was full Of this fact there were many evidences OH friends who had not seen one another for a sugar met in the street and exchanged hearty greetings, the hotels were all examined, and an air of bustle pervaded the place that witH strangely out of keeping with its wonted calm Mon from out back were making their annual holiday trip, bringing with them horses and cattle for exhibition, but all bringing with them money The most outstanding feature of the time was that money was about As a natural sequence conviviality was the order of the day-and of the night Over the friendly board experiences were interchanged, and hoary memories of the past retuld Much had happened since the last meeting, and the few nights available were all too short for the unwinding of the string of events The Show was wonderful in the excellence and multiplicity of its exhibits, and to those able to profit by such educational displays, not in interest Men hounded possessed of occult powers of reasoning from the curl of the hair on a dog's leg, a certain glint of colour in the eye of a horse, or the general look of solemnity about an ox Weird looking pieces of machinery that seemed to a stranger to ho cunningly devised objectS of torture, or the nightmare product of some uran brained inventor, were to them full of significance, and provided topics of warm controversy Each show day brought new objects of interest for these cognoscenti, and at night concerts and dances supplied a vent for the energies of the younger generation The week of excitement; and gaiety was fittingly brought to a close by the annual meeting of the Piorno Race Club The day was clear and warm, and towards noon most of the elect of the town made their way to the racecourse A pleasant drive through green fields brought us to the course that was to prove so full of surprises It contained no buildings and no barricades, and you felt at once that you were in for a novel utoTi shoe, and so it is as TI of first race was at half-past 12, but there was no rush or hurry as the same for starting approached The " jockeys," in this case gentlemen riding their own horses, mixed in amongst the throng of spectators, and steadily discussed the chances of the animals taking part All were thought to have some chance, and all were going to do their best to win It seemed odd, after an experience mother quarters, not to have to ask whether such and such a horse was true You felt how absurd it would be, and yet at other times how natural Hero all were " tnO's " Though grateful for the 1 knowledge, you yet had a vague feeling of incredulity It was so, however, and those most interested accepted the situation with equanimity. The horses filed out, and, without the aid of a starting machine, got away well together It was a spirited to test, and plenty of excitement was manifested The rider of the winner, after returning to sight in the orthodox manner, ncotvollho congrllnlitiojs of friends, and thus the sport came enced.

The hospitality extended to visitors was generous even to the point of embarrassment but the fault was a good one and characteristic of a large hearted people The trees in the town wore a suit of golden russet, the chocolate sides of the neighbouring b 11s fresh upturned by the plough presented a rich prospect, great teams of bullocks lazily lumbered along the road, and its normal torpor had settled on the countryside so late alum with busy life Show time had come and gone, and folks around returned to their steady, emotionless labours
