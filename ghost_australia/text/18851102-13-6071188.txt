THE DERBY DAY. Derby day was a day of clouds and rain It unfortunately was marked by a change of the weather after three scorching north wind days, and the change was violent when it came. The wished for southerly breeze brought with it a drenching downpour, like that of Assyrmn's long to be remembered Cup year at Flemington. But on Derby day people were awakened early by the rain storm beating on their window panes, they were able to go to the course prepared for the weather, and there were no delicate fabrics for a treacherous shower to spoil Those ladies who did not think the Derby worth witnessing while the grand stand presented little more than an array of sombre coloured sisters and macintosh! s had at least the consolation of being fore warned to stay away and save their new race dresses for a more propitious occasion There was nothing deceptive e about the gloomy for bidding morning, with the rain falling steadily, however earnestly booth holders and stewards might have wished for more cheerful weather, that the timorous might not have been kept away Derby day was to have shown the perfec- tion of the new railway arrangements, but they were not perfect There was not much to complain of in the transit of people to the course, but Some trams were very slow in leaving it The outlook was too in promising to give the staff any serious work on the outward journey), as their resources are supposed to be able to cope with five times the crush that took place. The earlier trains were filled in a straggling manner, as though intending visitors were waiting to see whether the day would clear up His closing of offices at 12 o'clock led to reinforcements, but more than one car load of excursionists turned back after driving to the booking office, and casting another look at the leaden sky, which changed their minds the train moved aw is) rapidly and pune tually each from its own first or second class platform, which was reached by the respective e classes of ticket holders by separate entrances The arrangements for allowing out) so many people as a tram would hold on the platform at one time prevented over crowding or confusion in a manner which was more noteworthy), as suggesting what is capable of being done on Cup Day, than for doing what Derby Day required. It was at the course that defect, were seen PasSengers had to alight upon and walk to the course upon soft newly laid gravel, which apparently had not been rolled, and in which the foot sank to the instep at every stride. The Railway department had apparently be lieved that as races area public amusement, they are only held in fine weather The gravel, after it had been walked over by a few thousands of people, was churned into a creamy slough, which was very destructive to shoe leather and ladies dresses The platforms Should be asphalted to make them decent footways On Saturday they were far more boggy than the saddling paddock There are abundant new gates to letpeoplefiomthe trains into the course, but ticket holders were much delay) ed in getting back again, and in some cases were kept still longer on the platform or in the train itself after they had secured a seat The Railway Commissioners can judge whether, with a comparatively small gathering like that of Derby Day the platform rates should have to be kept locked for 10 minutes at a time, but there will be no difference of opinion that people ought not to be kept from 20 minutes to half an hour in the carriages, waiting for a train to move, while three other trains which were not filled so early started and passed them by this occurred at least twice in the members' platform, the first time immediately after the Derby) was run, and the second after the last race Ticket holders were told to go to the platform in question, and occupy the train, but apparently it was only by an after thought that the train was run at all, and this notwithstanding that Mr Moore, district traffic superintendent occupied the signal box and personally directed the traffic It should be a subject for inquiry why the trams could not have been more prompt!, dispatched for with the Cup Day crowd Saturday s work would have led to nothing short of. notice The road on Saturday fell dismally short of the traditions of Derby Day It vi is almost deserted, but a few dauntless carriage folk were not to be discouraged from driving to the course two or three drag parties were even adventurous enough to persevere in their intention of going to the Derby, in true Derby style behind a four in hand but wrapped up like Greenlanders and covered with umbrellas, they looked anything but festive on the outside seats It would have been easy to beguile the vi n w nil a few satine I jokes at the secretary s expense anent his remarks in the correspondence of the Arum as to the fabulous number of water carts which he met the stewards of the H.C had heroically endeavoured to obtain for untiring the road to the course from 3 and. until the carters found themselves in the way of the crowded procession of vehicles running to the course The course when the rain, began looked very dreary for a Derby Day It had not even the life and colour of an oil due At a quarter to one when the bell rang for the horses to y to the post for the best men the signal had no cheery sound 'The guy colonise the riders flitted before an empty lawn a grandstand displaying large gipsies vacant seats and groups of ladies whose overalls were scarcely sures tile of holiday making, The Governor Lady Loch, and suite, were not to be deterred from being as punctual as His Excellency alw is is in keeping public appointments Sir William Robinson, Governor of South Australia, was also present Upon their 1 excel lencies arrival Zelman s military band played the-national Anthem and throughout the afternoon that band did much to enliven the proceedings But already there were signs that Derby Day would be a success after all the nun ceased at locked, the ak> frowned a little less blacks), the attendance began to thicken up wonderfully true the bright fresh turf was soiled and trodden, the hill was of a dirty brown colour, and the lawn was unapproachable except in shooting boots yet withal the layers and takers of odds busied themselves as briskly the grandstand was as animated and the close families were hailed with as much delight as if the day had favoure 1 the general joy Up to 9 o'clock the attendance kept on increasing as those who had at first stated away took heart of grace on finding the afternoon line, and came out to the course, until, at the time the Derby was run, there were about as many present to witness it as there were last year, that is to say, about 40 000 The most sanguine would not have foretold this result in the morning, when the weather wise were sure that the rain would not clear up after threatening so much at 4 of clock the turning point in so many days The racing was noticeable for some special events for first was the reappearance of Mr G Watson, the starter, after his illness, and when he rode down on a. stout grey back to send away the first field, he was cheered so heartily from the hill, grand stand, and flat that he had to bow his acknowledgments. Another feature of the racing of more mourn full significance was the tribute paid at this the first important meeting held after the lamentable Caulfield Cup accident to the memory of Donald Nicolson the jockey s in all the races wore a black band on the arm or around the body. The horse, Lord Exeter, which Nelson was riding when he was killed appeared in the Coburg Stakes, but he did not get a place in in chester one of the Derby horses and The Israelite, who ran in the Coburg Stakes, were also among those which fell at Caulfield The third incident which calls for mention was the open trespass of bookmakers upon the lawn near the judge B stand contrary to the rules of the V R C The official whose duty it is to check this encroachment was close by while the rule was being broken The rule restricting bookmakers to the saddling paddock is an excellent one, and it ought to be observed. 'The bookmakers had so bad a time of it in all the events except the Selling Race, which the outsider Albanus won, that probably they were zealous to make up the losses which they suffered over Mr White's double victory in the Maribyrnong Plate and Derby, The Agents success in the Hurdle Race, and 'trenton's in the Melbourne Stakes The Derby candidates were eagerly scanned before the Saddling- bell ran Would Uralla beat Nordenfelt was the ah sorbing question A thick ring gathered round both the mare and the colt, The Vice Regal party came down to look at Nordenfelt, who was stolidly indifferent to the operation of saddling as though calmly confident of his coming triumph Uralla, as if this liking the task set her, resisted the farrier in taking off her shoes, kicked savagely in every direction, and laid her ears back with a very vicious expression, as much as to say that she did mean to try Hales as he accompanied Mr Minta down the paddock with his saddle on his arm, was looked upon by everyone as the r der of Nor dentition the Derby His trainer, having carefully superintended Nordenfelt s trappings, lifted the jockey into the saddle but the rider wins Ellis not Miles It was evident that nordenfelt, a naturally sluggish horse, was meant to finish well if need be, and the more active horseman was selected to push him home It Mr White could his foreseen First Chester's struggle in the straight, he could not have done better His did push Nordenfelt home, and won the Derby by a head. As the horses passed the post a great cheer broke from the crowd, and when the horses returned to weigh the cheer was taken up in succession by Hat stand, and hill, and the enthusiasm was unbounded The victory was a most popular one, and affected the bookmakers Severely, for Nordenfelt stands in many doubles in the Derby and Cup After the Derby there was not a great exodus of visitors, a large majority remaining for the last race This came off at the exceptionally late hour of a quarter to 6 The returns of the railway traffic to and from the races show a slight falling off as compared with those for Derby Day of last year, the figures being as follows - breeze. THE DRESSES [By " QUEEN BEE," or "THE AUSTRALASIAN J On Saturday overalls and waterproofs were worn universally, and the few ladies, who for a time were able to dispense with such protectors, were those who had gone out in sombre costumes They contributed nothing to the usually brilliant display on Derby day Dulness in the skies, and dampness under foot kill a dress show None was so completely spoilt as that of Saturday afternoon There was no promenading and consequently very little to be seen but now and again some ladies would venture on to the terrace and give an opportunity for observation Lady Loch wore a gown of great merveilleux and velvet, picked out with black lace, bonnet of black net and great bows Lady Clarke's gown was of royal blue velvet the overdress was made polonaise fashion, with a border of beaver at its edge, princess bonnet of blue straw, sulphur leathers and blue velvet Mrs 1 itinerate i moss (green merveilleux w with a front of cream maltese lace Mrs Ind wore a frock of biscuit c in as with dr pen of brown velvet striped canvas small straw bonnet trimmed with oriental gauze Mrs H Power, black and blue striped satin petticoitwithblueSicilianbodice and draperies veiled in black lace, bonnet of black lace and blue velvet, Mrs D.

Nothing so quickly attracts the attention of the visitor to Victoria as the amazing energy of the people.

Luckily, though it showered at intervals throughout the day, it never actually rained during a race -I think though I must plead guilty to being moremterestcdinthepeople than in the races. Having secured an excellent seat in the grandstand, the first event to be seen from thence was the arrival of vice royalty The plain dress of the lady who reigns so graciously over Victorian society at present a dress suitable to the weather and the occasion, was a lesson on the fitness of things, 'the rain, clearing off for the first race left visible the pastoral beauty of the landscape Part of Melbourne softened by distance, the gentle hills rising beyond the Saltwater River, and encircling the racecourse the solitary gum tree on the flat, in the afternoon black with youthful humanity, and the freshness of grass and foliage, made the scene quite idyllic The first and second races over a move to the carriage paddock takes place for luncheon lins necessitates wading through the wet grass ruinous to thin shoes, if any have been so foolish us to come in anything but thick soled Balmer his Next to the energy of the people of Victoria what obtrudes itself on the notice of the stranger in their luxury, an eminent journalist notwithstanding There are as we know, people who, when they pray for their daily bread moon orleans and truffles Many of the tables under the long Shed are set out with flowers and crystal as after a bill supper and champagne flows like water What a marvellous colony it is Returning to the stand we find that the crowd has more than doubled, and that the clearer weather has enabled the ladies to dispense with ugly sisters and macintoshes, and display their pretty dresses A premium to him who shall male of the dust coat, the master, or the macintosh a thing of beauty I Hie gowns to day are generally quiet and many are very pretty A. few outrageous ones Hit hither and thither, like meteors and miniature suns several ladies wear fur A child on its nurses arra, dressed in its fathers racing colours rose pink frock with bright green sleeves and tartan cap presented an extraordinary appearance I was surprised to see such a plentiful sprinkling of children One tiny dot, in deep mourning, and so tame as to need the support of a crutch seemed to me to be very unsafe and absurdly out of place in such a guy scene There is a great deal of IK in by here today Lovely faces and slim and graceful figures abound lndjcttho youths of Melbourne are back ward in entering the matrimonial state, it is said Is ear in a young man and a maiden are engaged in the pastime of flirting In this case, the girl is very young indeed loved j, let somehow she reminds me of a frolicsome Clydesdale Is it possible that to their fire quently staking good looks, their many accomplishments and graces of manner and appearance, the ladies of Victoria do not add the finishing touches exact knowledge of scientific flirtation' In any gathering of Anglo Saxons there is a tendency to a separa turn of the sexes Here the ladies have the stand much to themselves, while the gentleness are ill along the asphalted path, and had the bank that slopes to the lawn, live racing is their chief attraction Let us transport this scene to Stuttgart, Lubeck, or Berlin, and straightway we should see hundreds of couples Swaying to the charming strains of the excellent handled by Signor Zelman Here a seemingly endless procession of people is all up and down with no more attention to the music than if they were sent From the number of close set pairs of eyes I would infer that the betting interest is largely represented to day Among ladies betting usually takes the milder form of sweeps I come across a ring of ladies, about a dozen in number, who are getting up a sweepstake of their own We may be sure that the most rigorous justice will be dealt out.

THE PARADE As the preliminary bell rang for preparing the horses for the great event of the day the twenty) seventh Victoria Derby there was a general movement among the large number who despite the unpleasant weather, thronged the saddling paddock Some of devoured to get a last look at the competitors going through their final toilette, while others hastened off to secure a seat in the stand from which to gain a good view of the contest The card showed a list of 14 competitors, butasGopenha-cn, Memento, and Yoon door were not coloured they were known to be non star team, and soon the red blot over their numbers showed that they were scratched Costal and Titi were also withdrawn, and soon after the Melbourne Stakes Ringmaster was struck out The field was thus reduced to eight starters, and of these not one was bred in Victoria. Nordenfelt, Winchester, and thunderbolt were bred in New Zealand, First Chester and Uralla come from New South Wales, while Remus, Dunlop, and Isonomy were raised on South Australian pasture. Such a thing as a Victoria Derby being run without a Victorian bred horse in the contest has never before been witnessed, There was no trouble in clearing the course. The spectators were so anxious to see the competitors do their preliminary can tors that the green strip of turf was left free before the mounted police started to clear the ground. The first to appear was Isonomy, a colt that for some weeks past has received a very strong support from the South Australian division, and his performances on the training ground have fully justified their good opinion from the dam of hardens and by the sire of Sandal, he was thought to be well enough bred and good enough to win a Derby) Remus came next, but though he has shown "good form in public, he did not take the eye like Isonomy) Ai'inchester gained much admira- tion as he came down the course He ran so well in the Caulfield Cup that his backers firmly believe he would have proved the winner but for the accident which spoilt the meeting Dunlop presented a very attractive appearance as he swept over the turf, but it was generally felt that he had not substance enough for a journey in such company and over such holding ground Nordenfelt was the next to appear, and to the surprise of every one it was 1 His and not wales who was in the saddle The colt is one that would take the fancy of a thorough horseman more than that of the general public He does not strike one at first sight as being a very handsome horse, but the more he is looked at the more he will be liked Well proportioned, and with remarkable muscular power particularly on the Roma and quarters, he is just the horse to toil through heavy ground and come out the finish Uralla, who followed, was ridden by Hales. She seemed rather fine drawn, and had a somewhat gaunt appearance. First Cheater at tracted much notice , a dashing looking upstanding colt, with great power, he was the sort one would select to win a race with Derby weight up and in heavy going Has preliminary gallop was very satisfactory for he threw himself into his work as if he revelled in it. The last to appear was thunderbolt, who did not gallop, but was led to the posts His RACE There was very little delay at the post, and after two or three attempts Mr W ation, catching the competitor in an almost perfect line gave the word to go Remus, Nordenfelt and first Chester were quickest on their legs, the first named drawing out and leading round the turn Uralla, who had the worst of the start, was first Remus was allowed to gain a slight advantage as the horses swept along by the river, where the field presented a more straggling appearance than at any other period in the race Isonomy) had gone up to the second place Nordenfelt and Thunderbolt were close together, and evidently watching the two in front of them First Chester was taking matters very easy!) and had joined Uralla in the rear Remus held his lead till reaching the far turn, where iBonomya colours were showing in the van , Nordenfelt and thunderbolt were hand and the them were all close up, and First Chester was still acting as whipped in The pace which up to this point had not been particularly fast, now improved iBonoray put on a spurt and cleared out from the others, having a strong lead as they passed the abattoirs The held drew up to him as they passed the sheds , First Cheater improved his position, and Dunlop dropped back to last place Remus was out of the contest before the home turn was reached Here bales brought Uralla well forward on the outside, but she soon dropped back again Isonomy led into the straight, and appeared to be going so strongly that his backers loudly proclaimed his victory But there was a change in their note ere long, for First Chester came forward with a splendid rush as the held entered the straight, and was soon on terms with the South Australian Meanwhile Nordenfelt had been steadily in proving his position, and First Chester had scarcely disposed of Isonomy ere he in turn was challenged by the Maori He came, not with a brilliant rush but with a steady, dogged determination, that was much more disheartening to his opponent Already his head was nearly level with First Chesters, when the latter swerved suddenly, to the right, carrjmgNordenfeltsevcralyards out of his line and seriously interfering with him Any other but a horse of great power and courage would have been put out of his stride, but Nordenfelt took the interference as a matter of course, and gamely answering Ellis's call, he passed First Chester and gained the victory by a neck But for the collision it was evident to all the onlookers that, had it been desired, he could have made the war a much more decided one. Winchester came well at the finish, and gained third place, Thunderbolt and Isonomy being close behind him On returning to scale the people on the Hat hooted Lclso, the rider of First Chester, most heartily, for what they evidently considered was a piece of foul riding on his part at the finish of the race It was generally anticipated that the stewards would call on Kelso for an explanation of his riding, and as the jockey remained in the room after weighing in, a considerable number of persons waited to learn the result It appears that Kelso waited on his own account to see if the stewards wanted an explanation, but as Mr White made no complaint, and the stewards did not move in the matter he left the room without a question being asked It was stated on the ground that the surcingle broke, and the loose end Hopping round the colts fore leg, was the cause of his swerving Nordenfelt was bred by the Auckland Stud Company, and was purchased by the Hon J White as a yearling for 1,200 guineas He was not trained as a two year old, and first carried his owner's colours, as a three-year old in the Hawkesbury Guineas, but lost so much ground, through turning the wrong way at the start, that he was not persevered with On the second day of the meeting he won the Produce Stall as very easily At the Randwick Spring Meeting he carried off the A J C Derby and on the second day appropriated the Spring Minden Stat es, one mile and a half, in a canter He won the Craven Plate, one mile and a quarter, Honeydew and lets mild filling the other places, and at the same meeting he won the Randwick Plate three miles, in a canter He is a rich brown colt, standing about 15 hands 2 inches, carries himself well but is not by any means a showy horse He is well proportioned very muscular, and has excellent fore legs The condition in which this colt was brought out for the Derby reflects the greatest credit on his trainer On being rubbed down in mediately after the race, he commenced cropping the grass as coolly as it nothing particular had happened VICTORIA DFllin, OI2ÜSOVS each, with CJO sovs added fOOsovs and all thosweepslakoslor the first horse lOOse for the second and HO sovs for the third For three year olds One mile and a half Hon J White's br- Nordenfelt by Musket Onyx, 8st 10lb (Ellis) ' 1 Mr W Kelso's bro- First Chester, by Chester Marie Stuart, 8st 10lb (leeUo) 2 Hon W Robinson s bro- W inchoster (late Man chester), by St score, Miss Hat, 8st 10lb (Power) 3 Mr A R Robertson she Dunlop by rieolicrsirat -Etta 8st 10lb (Robertson) 0 Mr S G Cook's ch of Thomas by Gaugiorvvard Romula 8st 10lb (Sanders) 0 Mr M Locke's b o Isonomy, by Winterlake Ruby, 8st 10lb.

The fact that the little horse had already shown himself a good one at getting through the mud was something in his favour and when the eight went out, he was first favourite, and the best price obtainable about him was 2 to 1 barely a point behind in the betting was Trenton, who had Robertson as his pilot for the race The New Zealander, square and muscular, and altogether a fine stamp of the thoroughbred, looked just the horse to win on such a day He was a bit lazy in his opening, gallops but it w as considered that so active a horseman as Robertson would not let any fault of this kind stand in the way of his will in the colours carried by Trenton were the familiar rose and black stripes an 1 black cap, associated in the mind of all old patrons, of Flemington with the victories of Mr Hurtle 1 Fisher's horses over the V R C course An old identity re appeared in Bosworth, but the little house was not so shapely as when he last raced here Amongst the other horses engaged, Ilonevdew excited most curiosity, people being anxious to see Mr Long's 1,500 guineas worth. To most people the horse was a disappointment, his great height giving him in his present condition the appearance of being leggy and angular Robertson was very anxious to get a few lengths advantageous the start, and set 'trenton going once or twice before the word was then Bosworth seemed to have concluded that he had had enough of racing, and was as anxious to stay) behind as Trenton was to go Ringmaster got best away when the word was given, while Bosworth lost lengths, but his rider, with doubtful judgment, at once started to make up lost ground, and rushed him along so last that he was in front at the back of the course Ringmaster was leading as they entered the straight, and was expected to stay there, but when Trenton was stirred up half way) down, all doubts about the result were sit at rest, for the New Zealand horse won in excellent style The surprise of the race was the style in which Sheet Anchor finished, his second to trenton being the more creditable as the Ballarat horse was last approaching the turn, and must have come remarkably list in the straight running In addition to this he was supposed to have been quite "knocked out" in the Cup betting some days before Hone) drew made one rush us the horses approached the turn, but it was ended almost as soon as commenced, and it this gallop was his best, his Cup chance should scarcely be worth purchase It was reported in the paddock after the race that Ringmaster, in the ing to come upon the inside, had struck his shoulder against the rails, and injured him self There was a rush to see the winner, Fenton, when he went back to the paddock, and his success increased the interest taken in the other New Zealand horses 1 untly a dozen came out for the Hotham Handicap, the favourite being the light wheat lesbia The mare, although still thin, and not at all impressionable, looked better than when she ran in the Caulfield Cup a fortnight since Of the others Mentmore, Agitation and Court were equal favourites In fact that Britisher was left in the race until the last moment was a matter for some comment, and much grumbling also For the greater put of the nice Agitation had a strong lead, and it seemed that the others would not catch her. She went very wide of the turn into the straight, but had lost the lead before losing ground him also 'He finish between Mont mon and Lesbia was by no means brilliant Mr W Whittingham s horse, as at Ciiulluld, declined tokccpatraight and was by no means cleverly ridden With Trahan in the saddle he might have won, but as it was, Lesbia, although she changed her legs in the last few strides, just got home the winner, with an partner) nothing in reserve Although only five horses remained in the weigh it for nine Hurdle Race, the meeting of four such cra< ks ns The Agnes, Royal Maid, Duration, and Gasalier with only a few pounds between them created an extraordinary interest, in spite of the fact that The Agent was looked upon as almost a certain winner Duration's recent performance, coupled with the fact that he is steadily) improving horse, induced the belief that it The Agent was to be beaten at all the stylish black horse might be the onctodoso. Duration, with M'Lean up, looked well enough to induce a fair to take the odds of late offered against him Royal Mind looked altogether more at Uah than when she first appeared on a metropolitan course The sporting wager of £100 to a sovereign was actually laid by a member of the ring against Molrovv's chance of winning, but as events showed that the other four must have fallen before Molrow could possibly have won, the wager was not so extravagant as at first sight it appeared 1 Ferguson rode the favourite as he has ridden him in all his Melbourne vic tones, letting the afters have their way through the greater part of the race, and merely attending them with dash in reserve for the finish Duration and Royal Maid both struck heavily during the race, but kept on their legs although losing ground Even The Agent was noticed to run a hurdle for the first time, but the fault was so slight that he lost nothing by it. The Agents wonderful power of gaining ground over hurdles was shown as the horses came round into the straight for the finish The wonderful little horse came over the jump with such a dash that he seemed to gain lengths upon the others, and he was in front almost in an instant Indeed his jumping all round was something worth witnessing As they entered the straight all close together, a hundred voices declared that 1' Ferguson was using his whip on The Agent, but the rider was merely threatening the horse, and never struck him once Gasahei kept to the little chesnut surprisingly well but even over the last hurdle He Agents superior method of jumping gained him some ground, and he won very comfortably, Gasalier beating Duration for second place At the finish Morrow. was some 300 yards behind the others, His rider had punished him so much with the spurs that the horse a flanks were covered with blood This exhibition of cruelty was altogether unnecessary) for Morrow. was one classes from the first and no amount of punishment could have kept him even within a respectable distance of the others.

The believers in winning families had very much to please them in this lot of youngsters, Buen Flemington winners as Chester, First King Grand 1 limeur, Goldsbrough and Dirnwell being amongst the sires while representatives of the equally reput ible Gang 1 Forward Neckersgat and St Albans were not wanting With Acme absent there would have been much speculation The race requires little description, for it was won immediately after the field had crossed the tan track Starting on the inside Hales brought the favourite along smartly until he had gained a lead of a length as they entered the course proper Here the rider sat down and, looking guardedly from rush to left to prevent an) Surprise, held his position without any trouble, and won by three lengths Madde lina, who ran very much better than was anticipated after her Caulfield trial, got second place by a length from the handsome Blairgowrie, and Louise Berta who a week ago was running Acme closely for the favour team in the betting carried her colours into fourth place There was considerable cheer me when Acme went to weigh in, a very large share of which was intended for the rider Hales Acme who is li) Chester from the imported mare Princess Maud has now started three times viz., at Randwick, Caulfield, and Flemington, and has won on every) occasion without being once troubled by her opponents fillies have always been dangerous in the great two) year old event and amongst those bracketed as winners, racing men will find it hard to recollect a better one than tins ) years winner The order of running the races was altered this year. an event being sandwiched between the Mario) among Plate and the Derby) which brought the latter race nearly an hour later than it is usually run The change was not regarded favourably by the visitors and it is generally considered that the club will do well to return to the old order of running There were a great many scratchings in the Selling Race so that a big field at the start was reduced to 10 at the post. Virago and both were equal favourites but they were both handsomely beaten by Albanus, who, taking the lead early in the race, kept it right through Hus was about the only winning turn that the layers of odds bad during the day, all other winners being heavily backed by James, on being put up for auction" was well lit in for £100 the club getting the whole amount there was confusion about the hoisting of numbers in this race Solo the third horse, being returned OF second, while no third horse was placed The mistake which was repeated in the Derby), where Uralla a number went up for Nordenfelt s was afterwards remedied A line field of 19 horse is saddled for the Coburg Stakes, the race being started at the inconveniently late hour of a quarter to 6 Bohemian, against whom the liberal odds of 5 to 1 were at first obtainable was backed down to 3 to 2 Tempa" and Mario 1 nurse being also a good deal fancied No mistake was made about Bohemian, for waiting. until half way up the straight, Flanagan brought him out and won by a length from Eastern it's the light weight Parody third.
