VARIETIES. A Haunted Gallery. IT IS VISITED BY THE GHOST OF A SCREAM- ING QUEEN. Here is the mysterious haunted gallery con- necting the old 'Queen's apartments' with the royal chapel. The gallery is haunted, it is said, by the shrieking ghost of Queen Catherine Howard. The Queen was a fasci- nating, deceitful, delightful little creature, who had been sadly neglected in her youth and corrupetd by debasing companionship, but full of delight of life and shrinking sen- sitively from every touch of pain. Yesterday she had been the petted toy of her cruel hus- band. To-day she was doomed to the fearful fate that awaited Harry's discarded wives. In the horror of her position, surrounded by rough and brutal soldiers of the King's guard, she found a momentary chance of es- cape, and rushing through the long gallery ran to seek her husband, who was at that mo- ment hearing mass in the chapel, to cling to knees, to soften with her tears that heart of adamant. The guards, at their utmost speed followed the poor destracted creature. Just as she reached the King's closet they over- took her and dragged her back, her frenzied screams resounding through the palace. The gallery is now used as a kind of lumber room, but still the shrieks of the agonized Queen are to be heard at times. Anyhow, in Earnest Law's interesting volume, 'Hampton Court in Tudor Times,' there is recent testimony to that effect. â€”All the Year Round.
