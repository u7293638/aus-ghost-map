THEATRE ROYAL. To a crowded house last evening the well known drama of the Corsican Bcotliovs was presented. Tlie picce is of a school more dependent upon scenic and mcchanical effects for success than giving tcopo for tl)9 display of good aeting in more than the two principal characters-the brothers and Chateau lienaud. Tbcso parts were fairly sus tains.'1 by Mr. CUrutics Holt and Mr. O'Brien respectively, although we certainly expucted more from the f ormer gentleman. Throughout the play there wis a flippancy and want of feeling oxliihitpri, totally at variance with tlio character of either Louis or Fabian tie Franthi. Jn no scene was this more noticeable than in tlio firs', where Fubiiin is describing to Dn Maynard tlu< sympathetic warning he had received of his brother's danger. Too much praise cannot be given to the way in which the piny was put on the stage in regard to scenic and mechanical effects ; the gontleman who did the ghost beinjj an exact counterpait of Mr Holt. The drama is to be repeated this evening, and in addition, " My Daughtar's Debut" will 1)Â« producod. This is a comedy eminently adapted to the talents of Mr O'Brien and Miss Nelson, who sustain the princi pal characters in it; so that there if? no doubt but that those who attend the lloyal will spend a very pleasant evening.
