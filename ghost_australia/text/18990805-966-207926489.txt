• REVERBERATIONS.

A contribution in shorthand from the -pen of R.- Jagoe, -"A 'Shipping 'Repocv ter'« Cruise; ' gives an : accouiit of a trip out- -under' oar and sail, after a sort of phantom vebsel in th'e darkness of the lught, which craft, when' boarded in a long ch^se, turned out . to be a French diip, but as,not.a soul aboard the boat could "parley vftus Francais/'onor any one on the Frenchman epeak English, no information could be «btamed, «o they left her to pick up a steamer, of Which they were original]v in search.' Tbev do not seem to have been able to make out her name, or else the "Sandhill Savage" did not know the phonetic equivalent for it. It is interesting t<-. . 'turn oyer the pages of this book, many of them'/VeHow with time, and some spotted ' wibh/kperm-from the candle by whose light " they were probably perused, 38 years ago or so„- and note the alterations and improvcrnjuits made in the outlines and grammalcgBes.' David Blair, _by-the-way, contributes -A Plea for-Ghosts," and an unknown writer tells "How I Became a Reporter," wbh "Sundrj' particulars as to iny state in life/' and probably the same sends another article- on-"Reporting-Blunders." There is a report of a phonetic meeting and presentation to Mr. Isaac Pitman in London. 'In'a country township within 30 miles of Adelaide dwells a -devotee of Bacchus-' His •wife, -good, thoughtful woman, when the popular idol kept the husband away from home until the arm of the law closed his •temple doors, was in the habit ot having a warm, fire and a good supper for the latereturning one when she retired to rest. On several occasions the. menu had included a tin of Sardines. One evening when in a heated-and unpacific mood, this item caused sr-eh jthnoyance that with a growl of ".Sardines'again!" lie threw' them, into the fire. Theii the fish had an innings. Their fervent j surroundings soon "developed latent energy . within the tin, which exploded, and CODsiflerably damaged the countenance of the! inebriate, who wis si* cdilv sobered; and an era : - of ,sticking-p!iister j- i • has i just i passed, . • , leaving him a wiser and more temperate man.
