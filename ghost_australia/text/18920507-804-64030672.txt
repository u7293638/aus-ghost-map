Â« THE IDLER.' EDITED BY JEROME K. JEROME AND ROBERT BARR. Taking it altogether, it must be con- fessed that the new magazine, so far, has been somewhat disappointing. Perhaps this arises partly from our expecting too much of the author of ' Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow,' perhaps from the fact of there being already so many m'agazines that one does not exactly see the raison d'etre of another. The opening article in the March number, on ' Variety Patter,' by Mr. Jerome, is amusingly written, as a matter of course, and Mr. Dudley Hardy's illustrations are good, but the rest of the contents do not reach a high average.
