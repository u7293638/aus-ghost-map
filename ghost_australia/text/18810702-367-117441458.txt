I must have fainted, na I hadl feared I should, from sheer weaklness and hunger. When I carne to myrself I was sitting in an easy-chair in a comfortable little room. A mild, solt-eyed, middle-aged lady was by my side. On the table there was wine and meat. I stammered out all sorts of apologiesa. The lady begged me to cat and drink, and I did so with an eagerness that I was asaarned of. This was at once one of the darkest and brighte?t hours of my life.

The shop was not so neat aet roal; but there oas the old smell of lussian leather, a perfume -which to this 'ia-s always conjures cc in my mind the pcure of that facmouE shop, itih a run wa ho peFsring in the door. From this point I went straight to Mrs. 2Ninon's. She came to the door herself -with a canile in her hand, the usual rainboeu in her Cap, the old pin in her eye lit repre sented a cleser ophthalmic operation, that cin) and her custo-may self-assertion of manner, which made her at once the teror and en., of her neIghbours. "Who is it?"' she said, after a short pause. "I knots the face." "Christopher Keurick," I said. If my fortunes had not bsen so lowr I should hate said M-fr. Kenric:, and effected an entrance at once. As it -was, I hesitated on the doorstep and said "Christopher Kenrich, and I hope yoe are well, Mrs. Nison." "Yea. Well as times go, thank yon. Come in. Don't stand there." In former days she wonld have said, " Come in, sir," and been as obsequious as a due sense of her own importance 'would have psrmi~tod; but she could see at once that I ias not a flourishing member of society, and ehe treated me accordingly. " W5hy, lor bleass you! how thin and pale you've got I ". she Easid, when wewere within that little back room which Tom Folgate and I called the epider's den. She ued to sit there and spin her wehs, we said, and dart out upon poor flies, who were attracted by the notice of "Gen~el apartments, with attrndance." " Can I have a bedroom, Mrs. Nizon," I said; "I am not very well off, but Icanpay for my lodgings. " You always did pay me," she said in a patronicing way; " and I will trust to your honour again, though it is more than I can say of come people as was grander in their ideas and stuck up. Where have you left your luggage ?" " I have none, at least none of any im portance; and I havoe walked some distance oni foot," I caid. " Have you got no change of things ? " I felt myself getting angry at these ques tions; but I controlled my feelings suf ficiently to reply calmly and courteously, "I have not. .If you object to let me j Lat·e roomM,tl; 3ina,~~J1anet 39 rt~ ianyP nan dowia; ZXd I a Act has been g s ___t d .rorw Lgivfngieril woliituas·re evaidepred he _gerguPisites but when you1 go Py ^4 T-nr oaxna 121hyr-~~ .am ase Shi~l~ a yo2an n hEE iiff ia 4 Th edy use zme ri-BE -id ings.- 1 -1 - m F; Ia-'and yeau;P Z r rn n a-' r -,-- -.

" ?-d to see the lady a-looking round, as if all the men in the church was envying the gentleman in the collars!

It was defily done, and clever of Mrs. lNixon, to call me " Mister Kenrick" a this juncture, though I was too much intereited in what she was telling me to care whether she put her news to me offensively or not. "It's been a great breaIk-up, I can assure you. Poor Ilitcihing I He was took ill, and he's gone quite silly, poor man!-quite imbecile; and he's in this very house, under my care, and a melancholy object to see; always a-waiting for his ;re, till it makes a body as has a heart fidt tocry, and long to kill that heartless woman. Iam not one as is given to weakness, having been so long obliged to make my own way in the world, and knowing what it is; but my heart bleeds for that old man, though it's true an old man shouldn't have married a young, flighty girl. He'd only jus~t gone to sleep when you came in, and he wakes up in the night like a child." "Terrible news l" I said, "terrible news !" and then I remembered a hundred little circumstnnees which indicated some thing more than mere friendship between that pretty, fascinating woman and Tom Folgate. Before I could ask a question about Emma Wilton, Mrs. Nixon, who seemed to relish her narrative, dashed on into forther details. The bearer of news, bad or ill, usually takes a portion of his tidings unto himself. Mrs. Nixon seemed to swell with oracular power. Her eyes flashed, her cheeks were red with excite ment, her ribbons were in a perpetual flutter; and she awed me with the vastness of her gossip. " Knowing as that affair between you and the youngest is put off, and as none of the others cares a button about you, it won't grieve you much to know as the Wiltons was not long in coming down from their stuck uppishism. Them two megs-poor squinchy things I with their noses up in the air and their gowns in the mud !--one on 'em is keeping a school, and the other is living on the bit and the sup as the mother has got ieft her.

What experiences I had hadn None so young, I thought, could have seen the was stre- wn with so many wrecked hoes. And yet the moon, "like a si?ver bo ben in heaven," shone out serenely asI stood at .,he window contemulating that sign of misery, "to let." I watched it sailmng on with bright sentinel star in company. I watchel it calmly pass over the spot where the riFver slipped away through the meadows. I watched it glimmer upon the red roofs of the High- street. I watched it shine on that white, ghost-like board over the way, and I spelt out the letters once more, "to let." Then I thought of the sad house st Stonyfield, and the church-yard; and a silent, prayerful hope escaped my lips that God would turn my father's heart towards me. I saw my mother's pale face in that Iarbourford dream, and heard her poor, broken voice. " 0 moon I " I said, "what a bitter lot is mine I " The "pale queen only sailed on with her attendant star; bet there was something hopeful, nevertheless, in the clear bright night. Perhaps Esther, I thought, is looking out into the moon light; and I stood in fancy by her side with the moonbeams tenderly clasping her dear lithe figure, the iry- of that old manor-housoe rustling in the low, murmuring breeze. "I will be true to thee, Esther," I1 said aloud; and I repeated over and over again those dear words in pencil, "they made me do it. I do love you." I closed the window at last. Soon after wards the moon shone into the room, as if it had heard my complaint and was sorry for me. (To be ontinued.. The Inventive Race.-An Irishman knows how to overcome all dificulties. " What shall I do with this unsightly heap of rubbish, Pat ?" "Dig a hole and bury it," answered the man of invention. "Ah, yes, Pat, but what am I to do with the dirt 1 dig out of the hole ?" " Well, sir, I would advise you to dig a hole big enough for the whole of it." A good nameis better than precious oint mnet-on the back of a note.
