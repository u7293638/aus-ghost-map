THE WILL-O'-THE-WISP. . Nobody nowadays entertains any super stitious ideas abont the . will-o'-the- wisp except, maybe, a few people in isolated localities where ignoranae of the .common natural laws still prevails. The advanoa of science has dissipated many of the old snperatrtions, and the mythical Jack with - hib lantern is one of the snbjeots of its rigid j investigations to the material world. jj The will-o'-the-wisp is a very simple affair when one knows abont it. Ib is a combination of phosphoretted hydrogen, a combustible gas generated from deoaying vegetable matter containing a considerable amount of phosphorus. A deposit of seeds may throw off enongh: of this gas to make a feeble tight, thongh this latter ooonrs but seldom, and it net tuifreqaenbly hovers over old wells, lending a weird ghostly Interest to the old ruins i toi; wtooh it most likely owes its origin. It is not unireqaently mixed with nitrogen and marsh gas. Both gases are combustible, bnt the will-o'-the-wisp is so heavily charged with phosphorus that it barns spontaneously. Oarbaretted hydrogen, always present to some degree, plays the part of lanternbearer to the phosphoretted hydrogen, being tighter than air.

The pur suer, to his ohase after. the phosphoric ourio- .sity, displaces the air more or leas, driving it before, thus constantly pushing this luminous gas away.
