Let us take some of the less ; familiar: cases : as recorded in the criminal his-: tory of other; countries. There was the murder of. ' the pretty cigar girl,' as she was,. called,.,.. Mary Rogers, of New York— the foundation, indeed, of Edgar Allen Pbe's. famous story, ' The Mystery of Marie Rpget,' although he placed the scene of the crime in Paris. Mary Rogers left her home one evening for a walk in Hobo. ken, on the Jersey side of tlie Hudson River, and was never afterwards seen, alive. -Some days. ..later her body, was found floating, in. North River ; she had been strangled . by. her own lace fichu.' By-and-by the traces of a fierce and mortal struggle were found hi a neigh bouring wood, and in due course several arrests were made, all of inch supposed to have been desperately in lo've with Mary Rogers. Every one was able, however, to establish his innocence, al though one.-rr by. named Payn. subse quently committed, suicide near where the crime was. perpetrated. This mysterious, murder agitated -the- whole of the United 'States to an extent-, unparalleled, except by the murders of, Presidents Lincoln aud'Garfield,' and no -misfactory clue was ever obtained. Not long ago, at the death of the to bacco, merchant who had been Mary Rogers's employer, and who as years passed. had become a very wealthy man, certain facts?,. were said to .have come out which. in a measure implicated him with the crime';' but these do not -seem to have been more than a vague story, of his beintr haunted on h!s de:iHiborl in Paris by the ghost of the --murdered girl. Other cases of a. similar kind have occurred in rhe United States. There was the,.imirdev,,pf. Sarah Cor nell, who was at first thought.Tto have, hanged herself, then said to. have been killed by a Methodist minister ; but he was acquitted, and the deed, now proved to be one of violence, was al ways a mystery. ? So was that of the girl fished iip from the bottom of Manhattan well, in the days when New. York wasa- smalliilace; but tlie murderer \yho; .had -first stran gled, then throjyn, ...!Gulie]nia. Sands down the well, was never discovered.— From ' Casseli's Family 'Magazine', for April. '; , .
