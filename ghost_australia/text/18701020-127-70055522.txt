SMAHBON'S ARMY AFTER THE, BATTLE OF W.~RTR. The Siecle, writing of the military situa tion, says :-" The defeat of M'Meaon. has been terrible-we must be outspoken--more disastrous than we. thought. se has told us officially that he brought off 18.000 Sup. pose de Failly had formed a junction. with him, our right wing would even them consist of only 50;00: This army seemed yesterday to be between Saverne and' 8arrebourg,. on the road from Stnasburg to Nancy. The army of the Crown Prince, notwithstanding itslosses, must still amount to 120,000, and we must not forget that they are flushed with victory. On, this.ide, therefbre,. the situation is serious-very serious, In the centre the evil is less the? we supposed. The defeat of Frossard at I'orbach has not been so disastrous as we thought. His corps has succeeded in effecting its retreat to Put telange, and probably by to day it will, have effected a junction with Basaine. The loke however,, must have been very severe. B~I sine has now under him 183,000 men almost intact. Well commanded,, wisely, directed, this army may form the rampart of France But we must not deceive ourselves; we must not rock ourselves in delusions. The task of 'this army is arduous The dilculties it has to overcome are formidable. The Prussians 'who fought at Forbach do not seem to have exceeded 64000, about the half of the first Prussian army, commanded by General Steinmetz.. The entire force of the second German army, that of Prince Frederick Charles, is, according to the smallest com putation, 160,00, who have not yet fixed a I shot. This army seems to have debouched I from Bliecastel on Saarguemines and -lohn I ba to effect a junction with that of Stein metg: This junction must hage alr.ady taken place. We'calpt eatimate at lessi than 240,000 the awsses of Germans who, have entered Lorraine, and who are.mnarching pro. bably on Nancy or Frouard, the junction of the railways from Paris to Metz and. StrasL burg, and who are maniuvring,i o doubt to pre'ent the jpnction of. M`'1ahon with Baz saine. Can battle ii, the open country be given to such enormous forces with ,any prospect of succeq ?.

When the news. arrived in, the latter place a panic seized the S.townpople. All the hoq~easwere closed ehotels, cafes, beer houses. I was scarcely e half, an hour in my chamber when the land' lord entered, and told me to leave as soon as eI could, for he was going to conceal himself in, the monuntaina of, the Vosges,.

CHLrsE,.- SWe are likely to have another trial for mur. Sder, seys the Pleasant Creek News, fully s equal to any of those laktely heard in, our ciircuit courts, in point of brutality and \- cowardice: The.facts are briefly these. Mr 1 Geary,.the inspector of schools, when.traveli I :ling in the. discharge of his otcial' duty, Ssomewhere in the neighborhood of; Eden I hope, had his. attention arrested by a low Smoaningesound, and looking in.the direction Sperceived the fornm. ofa, man. stretched., upon Ia sand bed, neaun some sparse scrub. Pulling Iup the buggy which he was driving,he. diss Smounted, and.found a Chinamen horribly 'mutilated, The roof of the. moifth and, a number of the. teeth, appeared to. be.licked in, There was.a large gash,on the forehead, a:s portion of one of, the hands was broken, Iwhile the face ofithe unfortunate cre ture appeared to be smashed to a mummy. With some diliculty, Mr Geany got a,little brandy down. the man's.throat, and carriedi him, to the buggy, where he fainted,. after vomiting !a large quantity of blcod. Mr Geany found it absolutely necessary to tie him in with,a :rope, which he fortunately had in. a trap, and in this manner he drove to Edenhope whicb was. some few miles distant from the spot. Dy virtue of the stimulant, which Mr Geary kept repeating in. small.doses, the Chinaman got suffcient strength to say, "'Me die, you, take money," producing at the same time a.,cheqpe for- a considerable amount from, some part of his clothing. When, somewhat relievedi by the aid of the doctor, the unfortunate man stated the cause of the attack to be somewhatas follows: -HE had been working for Mr Smith, the owner of a station, in that locality, as gar, dener;; bat lattealy a new cook had. been engaged, who refused to work for the Chi. naman,. The matter lkd to disseieions among the men, and resulted in the. Chinas manleaving. The owner. ofthe station was I so,annoyed that he. turned away some of the.hands, inclnding~ the sdok, and these followed the unfortunate man,, attacking and beating him in the savage minner described It seems,@owever, that they' were unable to find the cheque. The Chiiamana made his dying depositiones, and either one or two of the men inplicated sre bythi.time arrested as the police stated they were itre of being able to. Faptuoar them. The. life of the" China man is quite despaired of by the doctor, A young man named 'Wynn Hand met , w?ith arather serious" accident a few das a aigo at Bagshot.

He was conveyed to f the Sandhurst'HospitaL, Many readers will remember the cleverlyi written letters which. appeared in the i Madras Mail, one purporting to be from the. Duke of Edinburgh to his ellter brother, containing narrations. of, and comments on, Shis jpurneyings in India, and one from the L iPrince of Wales in. reply. The simulated ,authorship was so. well supported, that " in England it was thought necessary that 3 the letters should be publicly disavowed by. n .' tPrince of Wales on. behalf of himself and r his brother. The Madrab Mail, in a recent number, thus laughs. over the result of its ingenious hoar:-"-' A, member of the Indian 2 Council, writing to, a friend of ours by the n mail just received. from Europe, states that a Her 'hfajesty the Queen '.could with the greatest difficulty be persuaded that the let , tera from Alfred, to Alberti 1dward, and from e Albert Edward to Alfred. were not genuine :,and; authentic!'

's " A very serious charge is made by several of the New Zealand papers,. especially the Otago Daily Times,. against the General Y Government,.otf tampering in an upwarrant' " able manner with. the telegrams. which con e tained the news brought by the last Suez .mail. She.statement is that the telegrams sent from the. Bluf to. the various papers which have combined, their. telegraphic arr. rangements were transmitted- to Wellington, t and were there divulged by the Government. .to the Independent, a Ministerial organ. This jourral, although not one of, the tele graphic association, was still enabled to pubi, t lish telegrams which. were the legitimate property of the papers thus combined. It I seems. odd that the New Zoaland Govern, t ment, which,at ore time supplied telegraphic s aummaries of the news to the journals of tie colony, should now so far vary the former !system a .td appropriate the despatches. of , the newspaperain. so audacious a manner. It appears likely that in. the event of the Government failing to give satisfactory exn planation of the charges.made,, the associated journals will seek rediess'in the law courts. One paper, the Timaru Herald, suggests the ; meeting: at- some ceqtr.al place of reprerentar. of all the papers interested, for the- purpose of taking such steps as will effbetually pro. tict the press against conduct so inimical to 'its freedom, The action.of thae.overnment in the matter of. the late English, mail, teler, grams.it declares to.be dangerous,. despotic, and dishonest.. SA New ZIealand'chief, .Wi Take, Ngatata, in the course of an examination, before the Petitions Committee at Wellington,. delih vered himself as follows respecting the effect of the European. law on his. own people: "The law is defective. When.a Maort com mits.an, offence- against another Maori, no.1 notice is taken of it; and therefore I say, although the Government tells up that we M'aories are under the same laws. as: the Europeans, we, the Maories, receive nol benefit fromthe law. Ihe Europeanakeep the body ofi the law and give us: the ghost of it. I compare the present state of the law to a man looking into a mirror. The Euro. pean.isin front of the mirror, and;can see what is reflected in it;. the Maor is. behind it groping in the dark. Therefore when a Maori commits an. offence he is blamed for. it, and told that he is no good,.and-thab he should be obedient to the. laws of which he knows uothing,- -Another thing I want to. know is this--why are these Maori members allowed seats- in. the Hlouse ofl Represents. tives?- I have never heard them say a word, I suppose they sit there as ,arved images," In an.art~cicon -the Legislatie. blunders. of the late session of Parliament, the Weh lington Advertiser sEays :-" What makes all these errora.the less excusable is, that the Government have. lawyers. enoagh arouind. them,, one would think, to conduct matters properly.

Nolan was stopping, at Steward's Boarding house, Bourk' street. The laborer. at the Alfred Graving Dock, Wil liamstown, have again struck work. Owing. to the wet weather last week a good deal of time had been oat, end on Saturday forenoon the contractors in. timated to the men that it would be necessary for them to continue their work till 4 o'ol ok in the evening instead of leavin off at 4 which is. the uuaElhour. On hearing this request. the men sot only refused'to comply, bub stated that they, would not work st all unless they were paid 'a a day all round. For some time past the practice has, been to pay the dock laborers Os, Os d, and 7s a day, so. cording to their abilities. As the contractors refused to accede to this demand the laborers all left the works in the afternoon as soon as they were paid. There are now 68 men on stake. Those who got 7s is day also refused to work unlesthe.othe<men were 'paid the same rs'e of'wags. The masons, however, are still employed, and it is satisfactory to know that the works are not likely to be er onusly interrupted 'by these proceedings. The contractors informus 1that the excavation at the dock will be completed in another month, and that they will have no diffoiulty in obtaining. as many laborers as may be required for the remainder of the contraot.-Argus.
