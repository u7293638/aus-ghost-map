Do these old fogies exist in our church committees, our church organizations, or perchance, be of our City Fathers., or any similar ilk, we find them ever ready with their antediluvian advice and their insufferable insolence.

" It is this diversity in human nature that makes the world," said some old hunks years ago, whom I have forgotten ; and assureelly this diver i ty causes no end of squabbling-in sma'l communities at ani rate-as may be instanced in the many municipal counci's oí «mr beloved country. Theie .are happy families no doubt, in spite ed differences «>1 opinions and varied temperaments. The traveller to Europe has, probably, seen a " happy family," or two, in his perambula tiins ; I remember two in that quarter of the world ; one m the Champs Elysée, Paris, and one on Tower Hill, L »ndon. These were collections of birds and beasts-fishes were left out for chemical reasons-in which there were, dogs, hogs, monkeys, owls, weasels, hedgehogs, hawks, cats, rats, mice, and a variety of other small mammals. Now, you know, the great Lavator drew some remark- able comparisons between man and beasts, fowls, etc. Comparisons of a like nature might easily be traced in the members of a certain Council inthe " healthiest and loveliest village of Cumberland ;" sall they're a happy fkmily ; very much so! PHOTOGRAPHY EXTRAORDINARY. - Under this heading, an actinic collodian spoiler, in that remote village called Ipswich-some- where up Queensland way I believe, commu- nicates to the local paper a long rigmarole about taking photos by electricity. Well now, I have no end of belief in science-no matter what my unbeliefs may be ; and I have so much faith in the splendid capabilities of my fellow countrymen (of the word, I mean, for I am, naturally, cosmopolitan 1 that I am prepared to swallow a lot, without any great amount of lubricant. But when I peruse the " Extraordinary" affair, above spoken of, I have to use every conceivable oil, grease, and fat, known to man. and then I fall to get it down. I think the writer, is not unknown to me-having tried his 'prenticed. hand once before, in the littery line, about a blackfellow's eye having been photographed, thereby re vealing a battle scene of some thousands of years ago, when said darkie received his. quietas. The present yarn has more a sembl- ance of truth-but, I havn't told you yet ! Well, here goes, don't faint- anybody, before you read just a little bit! He-the operator \and writer, presumedly)-photographed some races that took place " twenty-three miles away" from his camera: the result was splendid, " the stitches in the bridle could be seen plainly, as well as the holes in the cheek straps, so sharp was the photo." Yes, that was sharp, undoubtedly so. The wonder doesn't stop at this, not by any means. He intends photographing people in Englamd, or America, by wire of course! some, in fact, have already been taken, finished off, and coloured naturally, in a few seconds, and for the small amount of £5 per dozen. He concludes thusly :-*' Truly, this is an age of wonders." It by—th—no, electricity ! I'll give this chap's name if he'll send the Chronicle five pounds worth of ads. ! AsMODEUS. j
