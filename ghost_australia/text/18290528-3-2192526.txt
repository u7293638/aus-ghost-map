Select Poetry. (FOR THE SYDNEY GAZETTE.) "Begone, Dull Rag!" A new glee to an old tune, as lately sung with universal applause, in praise of the Monitor, by the Ghost of an Empty Pew, removed by HÃ¦beas Corpus to the centre of Hyde Park. BEGONE, dull rag! I pr'ythee begone from me; Begone, dull rag! You and I can never agree. Long time thou hast been tarrying here, And fain wouldst tarry still, But I tell thee, vilest of rags, Thou never shalt have thy will. Too much of rags, We've had full many a day: By far too much of rags; There's never a man says nay. A Barrack companion thou long hast been, And a Barrack companion mays't be; But I tell thee for once and for all, dull rag, You and I can never agree. Begone, dull rag! I am very distressed for thee; It grieves my tender heart, Thy madman acts to see; Thy owner, with hanger and dirk by his side, Bulldogs in his belt,--one,-- two,--three, Cuts,--smashes,--and slashes, by left and by right, And he spares none of any degree. Begone, vile rag! I pray thee go far away, Thy prize is an acre of grass, Thy owner's a bundle of--hay: If virtue meets honor, if vice disregard, If that is caressed,--this is scared, " 'Twas I," quoth the fly, "with my little eye, "That did it, and none shall be spared." Begone, dull rag! I pray thee begone from me, Begone, vile rag! You and I can never agree, Then ------ shall dance, while ------ -------- sings, And we'll all of us cry Hurrah! For I hold it one of the wisest things, To drive dull rags away. (CHORUS of Ragamuffins, "Then -------", &c.;) Yours, P. A. X.
