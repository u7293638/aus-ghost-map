A TILLAGE GHOST STORY. A weid story is reported from a quiet little village on the slopes of the Mendips. Among the inhabitants rumours had been circulated (says the Daily Telegraph) that a ghostly appar ition was to be seen after nightfall in the footway leading to the rural grave yard, and so gruesome were the tales told concerning the spectre that the path in question became deserted. At length the village patriach started the theory that his grandfather had in formed him, when a boy, that it had taken "thirteen persons and a woman" to " lay the spirit" of an old squire for 150 years in the Bed Sea, that the time was expired, and that he had returned again. Matters had reached this crisis when a local rovsterer, after his daily peregrination, and having dined not wisely but too well, so far forgot himself as to endeavour to reach his home by the dreaded path. The following is the account he gave of his experience that night:â€”" I were a coom just to the churchyard, when from under the gert cbestnnt tree thur coo tned the most horrible site I ever seed. 'Twur a tall figgur, and his face and hauuds were a shining just like a bos of damp matches, and patches on him seemed to be all o'a-flame. It frightened I mainlee ; me hair was as stiff as brissels, and I should have bolted, only me legs! wouldn't run. I wur sober enuff now! and he coomed towards I, and not a sound did bur make, and when hur weer coomed quite close, he spoke in a terrible tone the words, 'Show me to my grave!' At that I found me feet, and hands too, and I went for'n, and I found he was a main solid speerit; and didn't he holler for mercy to be sure!" The victor of this mid night encounter is now the hero of the district around, and he carries in his pocket a rubber tenuis-shoe as a trophy of his victory. The ghost has been confined to his house with a seme attack of influenza,
