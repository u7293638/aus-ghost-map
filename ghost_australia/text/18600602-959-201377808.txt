MKLBODRSE t. VNIVEnSIXT. On Saturday afternoon a match took place between fifteen of tho Melbourne, and a similar number of the University Olub, on the ground of the former. The parent cluh had the first ' kick off;' and then away went the ball, here, there, and everywhere, with the usual number of -pills and knocks, until Mr. Baker, ot the Melbourne side, kicked a coal. After this, although the University men played well, the Melbourne had the game all to themselves, the others not having the ghost of a chance. Towards the end of the afternoon a shower of rain fell, and made the ground lomewhat slippery, but this only added to the fun, for then the downfalls became more frequent. Mr- Bird kicked the second coal for Melbourne. It weuld be as well, we think, if some distinguishing colour-ere adopted by the competing par ties. On Saturday, barring that the University men wore a tmall pink ribbon on the arm, do attention was paid to this important detail. Mkmiocrsic t.
