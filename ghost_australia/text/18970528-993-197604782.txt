Bollock? BUI. I'll sing you a song, boys, of Bullocky Bill, Who's honest aB daylight, and harder than nails, He's out in all weathers, yet never is ill, His pluck, or his patience ne'er jails; No barber he knows, no his bushy beard flows Far down on his dusly broad breast, And wags as its owner a flanker bestows On keeping old Ranger with zeast. CHOBOS— 'lis " Come hither Major" and " Come hither Mag," And " Come hither Boxer" and Bold ; JuBt hear his thong cracking, and see his team drag (Twelve pairs of big bullocks all told). When dingoes slink home, Bill is up and away From rug that he slept in at waggon wheel's side, By heavy, long stage, in fierce heat of the „. d «y. His team with late start would be tried ; Where Btorm water flows, there the mulga tree grows In thickets, his toilers love well; Each haunt of the cattle our bullocky knows, Can swear to the tongue of each bell. CHORDS— Tie " Woa back, you, Brandy" and " Stand up there, Sam 1" And " Wottl<? you, young fellow I Not quite 1" You'll soon be aB quiet, my boy, as a lamb, When work'd with and coupled to Bright. HiB bullocks all yoked, with strong teeth like a mill Bill worries his damper and drink6 his • black tea— On tucker for emus he's taken his fill, And ready for starting is he : O'er tableland track, where huge rocks his wheels rack, Through Bands where they sink felloe deep, He pilots his team with a driver's true knack, And, my word i at night he can sleep ! CHOBUS— 'Tis " Gee way there, Ledgard 1 Gee Tiger -and Tim I" If dreamland's queer team he should find, When stars from dark canopy, shino down on him And whispers the ghost living wind ! KOBT.
