A Floral Wonder of Panama. I THE Holy Ghost flower, or Flor del Espíritu Santo, is found in the region of the Isthmus ot'Panama. It seems to thrive in low, marshy spots, and springs up from decayed logs or from crevices in the rocks. The larger and older bulbs _ frequently send up the leaf stalks six or seven feet in height and from those, which are joined, broad lanceolated leaves are thrown out in pairs. The plant is an annual, and in June, July, and August the flower stalks start up from the base of the bulb, devoting all their energies to the formation or the buds. The buds are arranged on tho stalks much like those of the hyacinth, the usual number for a "Well-grown stalk to bear being from twelve to fifteen. The leaves are very pale green in colour, as though in harmony with the delicate purity of the blossom. The blossom is of alabaster whiteness, much like the old-style English pulpit. This, of itself, is strikingly curious, but it fades into insignificance when ono looks into the centre of that strange blossom, for there, nestling in its very heart, is the perfect image of a I dove.-,: ¡It requires no imaginationto seo it. No one could mistake it for anything else, for no human skill could fashion its shape more perfect- ly, no artist could adorn it with more elegant tints, and no perfumer could endow it with a more delicate fragrance. _ Bight in the cup of the blossom, with the snow white canopy about it, rests this wondrous image, its delicately moulding wings^ droop- ing, half, extended at its side, its gold-tinted head bent slightly for- ward, and its tiny,primson-tipped bill almost touching its snowy breast. An observer who saw it in its native home, says : " Just as the figure of the dove itself is there, beyond dis- pute, so does an expression pervade the image, an expression that even the mostcareless cannot fail to notice, the incarnation of humility and spiritual purity." .
