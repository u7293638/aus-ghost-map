TSisXUflllwcV the Go vomer and. Lady Loch and again present, and there was a moderately good attendance. The r&cing; commeboed With the Maiden Plate, which was reduced fcb three runners. Of this number Hamps fcead was most fancied, but he sadly disappointed his backers, and Capri scored a well deserved win for his owner. Remus appropriated the Nursery Handioap, after a fel$86 fiiiish with Honeycomb and Ulaluine, who rjan a dead heat for second place. The Adehads i Cup next came "on for decision, and. a general desire was manifested to have a peep at 4he ! candidates undergoing their tbilete. - A casnal | survey Sufficed ' in most -instances, ; but j rmihA a rovtnrr) amtVusivS " miinH who carried the confidence of a large and influential section. No fault could be found with the .condition of any of the ooi ipetitors save,, perhaps, , that Prometheus was noted. to b«/a "trifle oh the lu£y side. Conjecture commanded the position of choice in the wagering, but " backers were slightly 1 in favour of Britisher. Lord WSftpri and Lantern, however', were well supported; sbd a lot of money was invested oh Anchorite. After the lot had been paraded on th> latvn they were taken possession of, by Mr. Wafcspn, whose efforts to effect an equitabla1; jstflrt were greatly retarded by the persistent disobedience of Moore, the rider of Conjecturet Who wbb subsequently brought before the, stewards and disqualified for , three months for neglecting to obey the starter. ' . The seventeen horses were sent away to an excellent start, Lantern at once taking the initiative and leading past the stand. Approaching the turn Hobart stumbled and fell/ and an expression ; of alarm was uttered when his rider was thrown under the feet of the other horses. Fortunately, however/the boy escaped serious injury by ihe mishap. The race was full of variety1 through out, the lead for the early portion Jof xhe distance alternatinc hetween Lantern Wnd Conjecture. Along the back of the course, Prometheus displayed arare turn of speed, .but the effort was a fleeting one, and/at the sheds Hazard ' flashed like a meteor to the front, only to retire again, after a flicker of resistance with Britisher, who led into the straight. Below the carriage paddock Lord Wilton made his effort/ and' though he was stubbornly opposed by Aiichorite knd Sardius, he gained the judges fiat by a length. The Selling Race was reduced to a walkover for Fusilier ; and Middiemaroh carried off the Flying _ Handicap easily from the 'South Australian mare, Miss Merlin.

Proceedings com menced with the Hurdle Race, which was won by Echo, through a fine display of horseman ship on the part of Gorrigan. Remus appropriated the Ladies' Bracelet, after an interesting finish wi h East Lynne and Miles. Lady Robinson, of South Australia, in presenting the trophies to the lncky winners, expressed a hope tbat the next meeting of the South Australian Jockey Club would be run in Adelaide. Only three horses started for the Steeplechase, which was won easily by the favourite, Colebrook, with Songster second, and Blackthorn, who made most of the running next. When the horses were about to take their positions for the Charity Plate at the starting-post at the back of the course, Titania wheeled round in the wrong direction, and bolted f-.-r the saddling paddock, and in attempting to enter the enclosure she ran against the gates, and threw her rider, who was a good deal shaken by the fall be received. The race resulted in an easy win for First Pop. The winner, on being eubmitted to auction, was bought in at the upset price. The meeting terminated with the S. A J G. Handicap, which attracted a numerous field, and was ultimately won by St. John, with Britisher second, and St Lawrence third.
