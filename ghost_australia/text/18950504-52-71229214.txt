Cricket. Electorate Competition. FINAL ROUND. At the tívdnoy Cricket Ground on Saturday Paddington and South Sydney, tho two teams leading in tho Electo rate Premiership Com petition, continued and concluded their match in the final round. Tho weather was simply delightful, tho wiokot as near perfection as possible, and tho 700 j or SOO spoctators pre sent mo3t enthusiastic. The state of the game on. resuming -was ¡ j South Sydney, first innings, 171; Padding ton, first innings, two wickets for 31. Alec Bannerman, with 8 to his credit, was accompanied to tho wickets by Alf. Noble. The newcomer did net stay long with his captain, being clean bowled' by Robinson when he had only scored 4. With throe wickets down for 42 the chances of Pad dington seemed none too bright; but Banner man was still there, and, as subsequent events turned out, tho little stonewaller proved a fatal thorn in tho sido of tho opposing bowlers, and an effootivo stumbling block to the success of South Sydney. E. Noble took his brother's place, and opened with half-a-dozon runs in two hits. There was not. much certainty about those two stroker, but with a fow words of warning from Ina patient skipper the new comer settled down to steady and correct cricket. The.'combined efforts of Robinson and tho brothers Calinway ¿nd Donuan failed I to dislodge tho' batsmen, and slowly but I surely tho runs came, till at 3.15 a superb on-drive by Noblo brought tho century in I view amid much cheering. A fow minutes j later Noble, getting properly ou - to. a ball from Sjd. Callaway, lifted it .clean out of the , ground for 5. At 117 Syd. Gregory, tho South Sydney captain, relieved the elder Callaway, and an appoal to get rid of Noble off his first I delivery .was disallowed. Bannerman was I reaching well forward, a3 usual, mani festing all 1Ú9 old-timo dotormina j lion, confidence, and steadiness, and a peculiar, thou J h effcotive, leg glance by Noble off IL Donnan left Paddington just 50 to make to win. The same batsman soon af terwards took his individual score past GO, and tho innings total to 130, by banding H. Donnan twice in ono over fer 4 each time, amid,loud cheoring. Robinson now relieved Donnan, and began by tossing some very tempting balk down to 'Noble. The bats man could not restrain his inclination to "have a lash," and only a few' minutes elapsed before tho bowler had the satisfaction of seeing Noble ciught in the trap ho had laid. A curly well-pitched slow ball was sent down, and the batsman, not "getting properly on to it, was eaailv taken in tho long-field-on by Trumper. There was not ouo blemish on his invaluable innings of G4. Paddington still required 40 runs to win with six wickota to fall as J. J.'.Kelly emerged from the pavilion, - Tho wicket-keeper was distinctly uneasy for .a couple of ovors, and was once nearly bowled by Gregory. He only compiled '7, however, when the little South Sydney skipper got one past him, which not only boat the batsman, but smashed his ott' stump. 5 for 142. Joe Davis partnered Bannerman, and put to gether 5 in as many minutes, when ho hid to retiro leg before, to Robinson. 0 for. 147. Twenty- five were yet wanted by Piddington as E. Kelly came in, the excitement being intense. The bowling and fielding'were particularly keen, and run-getting was a matter of extreme difficulty. With' 160'on tho board, Grogory sent Kelly a beauty, which struck his pads; the fieldsmen unanimously shouted "How's that," tho umpire nodded assent, and the batsman had to retire. Sweetnam, who- fol lowed, began with a single and a brace ; and after a succession of maidens the stonewaller pulled . Robinson to fine leg for 3, Paddington now requiring 5 runs to win. Bannerman quickly pulled the matoh out of tho fire by banging Gregory twioe to the fence, and tho ball bounding up against the palings in front of members' stand, told that Paddington had won the 1895 premiership by three wiokots and 4 runs. Bannerman's display was a very fine ono.. He did not sive the ghost of a chance, and was cheered to the echo as he retired. The stonewaller is to be tostimonialised by the members of his club in recognition of his sterling performance. Next in importance was the match at the Domain between East Sydney and Central' Cumberland, tho latter scoring a most creditable win by 25 .runs on tho first innings. On tho openinsr day the Central Cumberland team made 96 in their first inn ings. On Saturday East Sydney, who batted one man short, were dismissed for 70, Pye aud Joe Wilsou badging four and three wiokots respectively at a cost of 24 runs each. Turner was absent and did not bat for East Sydney. The winnora' fielding was first class, and they thoroughly deservo tho position of runners-up for tho premiership. Glebe concluded their matoh at Wentworth Park against North Sydney, whom they de feated by 23 runs on the first innings. "Andy " Nowell obtained the very, fine bowling average: of eight for- 26. University administered a sound .drubbing to Manly at the 'Varsity Oval, the whole of the collegians, with one single exception, ob taining double- figures. On the previous Saturday Manly had scored 159, the University losing two wiokets for 73. The latter con tinued thoir innings, compiling no less than 376 before the last wicket foll. Leichhardt finished up a particularly poor season's work by being beaten by Redfern at the Redfern Oval. On tho first innings' scores thorp wa3 a difference of 37 runs in favor of Redfern, who knookod up 162 at their second attempt. Connell, Leiohhardt's craok bowler, was absent.

The following table shows tho number of ' points obtained by the different clubs taking j part in the electorate competition. Padding- I ton, who have won the premiership an d become holders of the Hordern Challenge Shield for one year at leaat, are one point better off than Central Cumberland who have every reason to be satisfied with their season's record. The Parrrmatta men owe a great deal to Franlr Iredale, whose batting average of 80 for eight completed innings is far above, any other similar average in the competition. Last season R. Brewster, with an average of 45*8 runs per innings, came out beat; but ms batting this season was not a success. H. Charlton, of North Sydney, secured the beat ! bowling average, viz., eighteen wiokete at a coat of a little over 7 runa each; whilo A. Newell, of the Glebe, comes second with forty eight wickets, at a cost of 7*35 each. With only one exception Nowell, who carried off last season's bowling average, bagged more wickets than any other trundler. Tho points scored are : Club, Paddington , C. Cumberland. South Sydney .
