The extreme publicity d>f life in those large rooms, ciaph • buying access to the other by many doors, which invariably stand open to admit free, currents of air. veiled only by heavy purdnhs (or curtains), frombehind which swift, silent, .barefooted attendants suddenly appear, and as: noiselessly vanish hgainj like white-robed; ghosts.
