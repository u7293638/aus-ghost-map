A CHARGE OF HERESY As reported in yesterday's issac, at a meeting-of the Victorian P[?]sbutery, held on Tuesday, the change of heresy preferred by the Rwv. Mr. McEchran assist the Rev. S. .Hector Feisoeaa, on account -of certain statements contained -in *Sn ruual Law Through tic Xaiural World" was dealt with, a committee .ieinc appointed t« report on tie TOit. The Bey. S. Hector Iwguson's book opens with lie daian tiat it is *'«n attempt i« miccon? ceptions and to expose errors in popular theology by hying them -open to the dear light of reason and ihe Word oS God." and that "if it sects to ondenmne die -fiimsy foundation on niiiA tome are resting, ft ? ■desires iikewise to substitute for that loon- * daiJon the •eternal rock of truth." The re- "i eepfrUm anticipated far it by the TOter M „ * hinted at in the remark, "It may sfirw ~J opposition from' the votanes of rdi£xous traditionalism andVrom (Siose vrlio build their fafth solely on creeds, bat it wi?

It is a permanent, organised spiritual body, and, in a spiritual -? world, it is independent of a material -en- CS swathement." The Scriptaires'substwilaa.te tbe assertion "that the lower animals base CJ| a souL" but as the beasts of the held ban no iiersonality or consciousness, death to >£ them is tbe extinction of their . being, -fpz "Their eoul or life will return to tie great,' J*j| reservoir of spiritual substanc* " "Tte* >J& human soul, bowerer, is a spiritual bo&y; f Jss related to the spiritual world as die ■>*]& natural body is related to this world, and -^ is ruled and controlled by spiritual laws a even while it inhabits a natural bodyjnad 'If dwells in a natural world. ~ *** The Westminster Confession of Faith do- ~ $ clares tiiat "at the last day ... «1I tiib I£* dead shall be raised tip with the wlfsamn f-m bodies, and none other, nltliou^i wifli dip ■**« ferent qualities, which shall be united Jt|j again to their souls for ever." Mr Per- ~*Bs| guson avers that "the Bible teaches that )M Christ Ilimself rose again, but to say that Jl His body -was material is unscientific, un-* jgl| Scriptural, and untrue," and he sivcs ~ |ig seven reasons for denying a material re- snrrcction, asking whether it is "not morp fis& satisfactory 2nd reasonable, and, to «ay f -*~M the least, equally Scriptural, to conclude ? _S that Jesus apneared in His pivineiumaii, SJB spiritual body." ■...•-..

Finally, as to the doctrine of joiLficatioa 4 by faith, Mr. Ferguson asks, "Can a nan fig be saved without doing or obejeng. the j J moral laws? .. .
