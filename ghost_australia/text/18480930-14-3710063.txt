Sir,-Lest others should be blamed for my crimes, allow me to lay claim to the following trifles, which, at various times, have appeared in this paper, viz.- " The Cabbage War," '' The Cleve- land Point Whale," and " The Ghost that appeared to the Editor." --as my exclusive pro- perty, "which nobody can deny," and permit me, in future, to call myself NEMO. Brisbane, Sept. 26th.
