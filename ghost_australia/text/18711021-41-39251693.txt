C— Invenias facile pnmum, nam Jucis origo est Ardorisque viris, sme qua moriantur et omnes; At si demittit radios e vertice coeli, Opprimit infaustos homines agit utque secundum, In qua conditione, tegit si lertius illos, Tegmen etabjiciunt,umbramquserunt et amatam Tola monebit eos; nam vite est umbra necesse, A primoque venit tantum intolerabilis ardor. 1.385. Charade, by Loyal True Blue.— i. 'Tis a word of four syllables — prithee begin With the first, that is ever embedded in sin ; You may seek it at home, and I have not a doubt Of your finding it there, for it never is out. n. But a Cockney pronouncing the second, I fear, Would appear to be talking of dances or beer; For their V's and their H's and hard W's All our City acquaintance omit or confuse. III. Or, instead of an ' H,' if you try with a 'T,' At the summit of all will that syllable be; But by adding to this the initial of 'salt,' You command in effect that we come to a halt. IV. And the same as to sound you would do, I confess, If the third you should finish by adding an ' S;' Though the syllable uninterfered with may stand In a jocular way for a foot or a hand. v. If the fourth from its noddle completely you wrench, It may signify 'one' in a sentence of French; Or its opposite end from the syllable rub, And you leave what is known as a very large tub. VI. But without any changes 'twere better by far For sweet Annie to play it on harp or guitar; And the exquisite melody, charming the soul, Will at all times be welcome, and never my whole. 1.386. Numbered Charade, by H. E. Cox. — My whole is composed of 16 letters, and refers to a branch of natural history. My 10 4 3 is a snare, 3 15 11 7 3 is an idea or 2)inion, the position of 3 7 2 5 6 should be ways well known to the captain of a ship, 10 13 14 15 13 3 5 is what every lover should be, 14 16 11 3 10 is a dishonest practice, 8 9 12 13 15 4 5 16 is a position in space. 1.387.
