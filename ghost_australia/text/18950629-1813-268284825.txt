DRESS REFORM. The Prussian Government is seriously considering the advisability' of issuing a decree forbidding women to wear trains on the public promenades. It is claimed that these street-sweeping appendages stir up the dust and scatter far and wide the germs of disease, with which it is alleged to be filled. The police of Meran, the fashionable watering place in the Tyrol, recently made such an order, with the result that the bacteria cranks and dress-refonn faddists in several localities are calling for its imitation. The Prussian House-iof Deputies enjoys the distinction of being the oniy legislative body to drop minor subjects, such as the budget, agricultural depression. etc., and to take up this momen tous one of |thc wearing of trains by women. From beginning to end, the Teutonic statesmen treated the subject with great seriousness, and not so much as the ghost of a joltc marred the debate. Soon we expect to hear from some learned crank that bacteria lodge in the hair, and that both males and females should be compelled by law to keep their heads shaved.
