PBOMOTED BY A CAT. It is not very often that is the means of getting a man promoted in the service, but this happened a few years ago in a northern force. There was a ghost scare in a village. Strange noises had been heard for two or three nights and days in an old disused barn. One night the villagers determined to hunt the ghost down. They nearly all turned out. Some had pitchforks, others epadeB, hammers, knives, or anything they could use as a weapon. But when they reaohed the barn and heard the rattliDg inside, none of them daro enter until the village constable came on the scene. He burst tl n doors open, and ran the ghi st into a coraer of the barn, when he found that it was not a ghost, but a oat. It bad got its head fast in an old salmon-tin, and, in trying to extrioate itself, had dragged tbe can over the stone floor, making the strange noises that had frightened all the village. The villagers got up a petition in favour of the constable, for having displayed to much courage in facing an unseen danger. It was sent to the proper quarter, with the result that ho was promoted to ' merit class.'
