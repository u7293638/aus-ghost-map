THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD. FRIDAY, JULY 22, 1892. YESTERDAY the Colonial Treasurer completed arrangements with the Now South Wales Savings Bank, whereby that institution took up Treasury bills to the value of half a million sterling, at 4¼ per cent, with a currency of four years. MR SEE considers that this percentage is equal to 4 per cent in London. He trusts that this amount, with the arrangements previously made, will carry him on to the end of the year.

Towards thin tho 10 per cent, ad valorem duty contributed £1243, and tbo 15 per cent. £174. Although some of the romnrlcs made by Mr. BEED at Arrnidalo on "Wednesday wore trite, aud some of tho niguments ho used wero well-worn and familiar, it should not be forgotten that the subjoot with which ho dealt throughout his address was tho controversy which separates the peoplo of tho colony into two camps, which provides the great dividing lino botweon party and part}' in the political world, which will bo raisod in the next session of Parliament, and will havo to be treated seriously, and if possible decisively, at tho next general olection. The loader of the Opposition appeared at Armidale, according to his owu explana- tion, not for the purpose of making attacks upon any member of the Government, but to opeu a fruotrado campaign. This pro- mise was, with one small exception, faithfully ndhored to, and it may bo hoped that the precedent will be followed. However entertaining personal attack and defence, accusation and re- crimination, may bo to audiences desirous of mmisementj thero is but little substan- tial gain to be derived on either side from sword-play or single-slick. Un tho other hand, any serious endeavour to throw new light upon quostiotts of public policy, or even to put lorth old arguments in a now way with the view of influencing or educating public opinion, may be expected to render some service, ac- cording to its worth. Controversy with too much of the personal element in it soon becomes flat, tis well as unprofitable. Wo do not know what tile viows of the Government upon the exact position of tho fiscal controversy may bo, but it would he n great mistako to assume that the adoption of tho new tariff, as the result of something like trouchery on the part of somo of the morabors who made iip the Government majority, has settled it. Notwithstanding minor anomalies and temporary interruptions, the fiscal policy of this colony has boon governed by the principles of Ircctrade. Principles and a policy that have been dominant and in force for so many years cannot bo sup- posed to have boen scattered to the wind and permanently lost through the moro or less accidental triumph of opposite principles; and the pursuit of the policy founded upon them, for u. few months. Tho free- traders of this colony would show a marked want of faithfulness to the cause they represont, and an equally obvious lack of oonfidence in the principles they profess, if thoy wore to ncoopt tho dofoat they have oncountored under such peculiar circumstaucos as conclusive. Thoy have to regard tho question as still open, and to keep it opou until tho couutry has formally, oxpressly, and dofinitoly pronounced judgtnont upon it. Thoro nro various considerations which rendor this a matter of duty. Tho Govern- ment forced the question boforo Parlia- ment whon on public grounds thoro was no olear necessity for doiug so, howovor expedient that courso may have appeared from tho point of view of party interost. But this action of the Government, in treating it us a mnttor of tho highest urgency and importance, served of itself to show how urgent and pressing aro the obligations of tho freetrado opposition. Besides this, it is to bo pointed out once moro that the constant and apparently in- evitable tondoncy of protection is to extend itself and gather accumulated weight ns time passes by. With protec- tion only a fow months old in this colony, that tendency is already beginning to devolop itself. If it bo not hold in check, its operation will create and strengthen those vested, interests upon which protection relies ns a defence against the attacks of freetrado. The true'policy of tho freetraders, there- fore, is to apply a continuous pressure of resistance to this tendency; and when protection has gained a footing by stratagem or by accident, or by a combination of the two, as in our caso, no fair opportunity for restraining this tondoncy and preventing tho throwing up of theso defensive works, should be allowed to pass bj' in neglect. But, judging from invitations offered some time ago, and from later hints, the Government will provide opportunities for such action in the coming session. If the Government had boon content with the ndvantngo gained in the last session, and lind decided to leave the tariff as it stands, the frootradors would havo had to mako an opportunity for themselves. This might be done, possibly in tho form of an amendment upon the Address. JBut if Mr. BARTON'Sforeshadowing8 are tobo realised, an opening for attack will be made by the Goveruiuont itself. It is to bo presumed thnt in deciding to moke tho tariff, fresh nnd raw as it is, a subject of renewed debuto, Ministers have weighed tho considerations for and nguiii6t tho taking of that stop. Some of the con- siderations in its favour are doubtless pressing on grounds of party interest. Mr. EEID remarked, the othor day, that in proclaiming the principles of frootrade ho was unablo to offer a 6inglo bribe. It is not so with protection. ? When the now Government was formed in reliance upon tho support of protectionists, it had, con- fessedly, to introduce protection ns a means of scouring and retaining that support. But this party uecessitj', which was acknowledged last session, will bo as palpablo in (iio next. The pro sumption is, that it has boen felt by tho Government all through the recess,. Something must be done to koop the party togpthor, to maintain confidence, to iullii expectations, and to keep faith. A Ministry relying on tho support of pro- tectionists must give thom protection, and that moans to endeavour to satisfy the in satiablo, and to fill up a fathomless void. Those who have some moasuro of pro- tection will strive in soason and out of season lo get more, and thoso who havo nono will put forth thoir claims witli a ciy for justice in thoir mouths. The Govern- ment would not fully admit all this in set terms, but that littlo intimation by the Acting Promior that one or two new duties would bo proposod is quite sufficient for the purpose of our argument. Wo do not say that it was a faint ory of distress. It is a plonsuro to a Government to com- ply as fur as posstblo with its supporters' demands. But who can doubt that this intimation was an indica- tion of pressure actually felt ? It is con- ceivable that the Govornmont might bo willing on general grounds to lol the tariff go for the time uutouohod ; but the point is, that a protectionist Government, rely- ing for support upon the maintenance of a policy which is supposed to promoto tho personal and pecuniary interests of its followers in or out of Parliament, can hardly bo considered as having a freo hand.. It is always under obligation to find tho pound of flesh. Without discussing furtbor tho reasons why it is likely that the tariff will again bo thrown down before the House in tho coming session, it is to be observed that to do thi%wi_ raise the whole fiscal con- troversy once more. The responsibility will rest with the Government should trouble or delay ensue. But tho free- traders would fall below the lovel of their \ responsibilities if they failed to toke the challenge up. What now duties may be proposed we cannot toll. Probably the question lias not yet been settlod by the Government. But, apart from considerations ns to the merits or demerits of particular duties, tho intro- duction of any now duty for the purposes of protection must raise the general con- troversy, because it will be a plain illus- tration of that fatal tondoncy of protection to extend itself, and with all its extensions to fall short of its onds, lo whioh we have referred above. Now that oircumstancos have -brought tho question of city improvement again under .notice, it is opportune to remind our- selves that this subject has other aspects besides that of the moro beautifying of the city. One of the things which make tho work of city improvement easier is the growing tendoncy of the population to live in the suburbs rather than in the city itself, which is consequently becoming moro and more given up to business purposes almost exclusively. But it is one thing to get the population out of the city, and quite another thing, ns somo of our suburban roadors know, to próvido it with an adequate moans of getting to and fro between its suburban homos and its places of business. Tho question, of course, is no now one with us, but it is interesting to see that certain theories on the subject thrown out by tho president of the architectural and engineering section at the last moetiug of tho Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science have just been receiving confirmation in aseries of papers uow appearing in an American magazine on the question of rapid transit in cities. Mr. SULMAN .spoke ou that occasion in favour of the adoption of the "spider's web" system of laying out towns in proferonce to the old " gridiron " arrange- ment, and the American writer has arrived I at the same conclusion, viewing the sub- ject from the standpoint of his own immédiate subject. It is unfortunately I a lit I lo late to think of recasting the plan on which Sydney is huile, but it certainly is not too late to tnko a hint from the results of inquiry and exporienco elsewhere ns to how our suburban traiflo maj' be best regulated. Nor is it too early ; for as everybody acquainted with the suburban expansion ot tho lust ton years is aware, ovory yoar has soon tho population flouk in increasing ratio from i the oity to tho surrounding suburbs, and ' nt ovory fresh advnnoo tho ono paramount quostiou has boon that of an ofiioiont passougor sorvico. The writer in Soribncr finds that tho tendency to live outside the city is n law of tho incroaso of population, and that as population grows tho habit of riding on cars increases out of all propor- tion to tho rato at which capital is able to supply the moans of transit. Ho is ablo to quoto an abundanco of examples of the result in Boston, Now ! York, Ohicngo, London, and othor centres. j In the last-named city tho regular evening ! congestion of traffic at Ludgate Hill stotiou I ÍB a familiar instanco of tho way this diffi- culty works ; and the practical question is how to nrrango tho traffic so that it may bo minimised. The circumstances of most cities havo suggested thoir own attempts at a solution. Tho stoop stroots of Sau Francisco led to the invention of lho cable tram, while it was found that the crookod and narrow stroots of Boston and the frequont curves and intersec- tions lent themselves best to elec- tric traction. But it is apparent that tho congestion of tra'ffio may and does occur whatever tho system in use, and it is only after a consideration of the question under all its conditions that the writer referred to comos to his conclusions. Brieflj' put, these are em- bodied in recommendations to tho effect that tho suburban passenger linos should radiate from tho busi- ness contre uko the spokes of a wheel, and follow as far as may bo the lines of tho business thoroughfares. Further than this it is suggested that the rate of spood should be oven, the system cnpablo of adjustment to changing conditions at the least cost, and that there should bo no changing of cars on the journey. Of course the difficulty of following the lines of the business thoroughfares is self apparent ; but this writer meets it with a suggestion that in the most crowded parts of the city the tram traffic should be conducted through sub- ways, while the less crowded routes should bo covered by an elevated railway, the surface system being reserved for tho suburbs. This system, to be car- ried out perfectly, must bo either in the hands of paid servants of the public or under the care of chartered companies ; but he is clear, as the result of his in- vestigation, that no haphazard and piece- meal system will ever succeed in satisfac- torily solving this growing question. We may bo able to troat this subject negligently and a little cavaliorly now, but thero can bo no doubt that it will bocouio a peremptory question that must bo answered in tho near future. Even if we could check tho tendoucy of the citj' population to fly to the suburbs it is not desirnblo that such a thing should bo dotjo, for we recog- nise tho influence of fresh air, open spaces, and chnngo of scone on tho health of tho peoplo and tho working usefulness of tho community. Besides, this movement is a tendency of the time that cannot be argued down. What the rural characteristic has been in the, past, and what tho urban characteristic is in tho present, the habit of suburban oxistonco will be in the coming time, according to the foreonst of an English writer who has been crystallising the results of his ob servations in the general remark, " Tho Englishman of tho future will bo a subui'b'dweller." The time has gone by whon the tradesman lived over his shop, as the writor in Scribmir has been pointing out to his roadors, and whon the lateral extension of cities was considered so undesirable a thing that Sir Cuius TOPHER WKES could be found seri- ously proposing to arrange all the London graveyards in a ring round the city vas a device for its prevention. All that remains to bo dono, therefore, is to recogniso the existenco of this law of suburban expansion, and to acknowledge the necessity of providing means to meet it. The problem of how this is to bo done is by no means confined to Sydney, for wherever tho business activity of a city is out of proportion to the spaco in which its business is transacted-and this is a sheer necessity of the caso in all busy oities-the question of how to give the public tho benefit of suburban residence and at the same timo easy access to the scenes of its daily avocations must always force itsolf on the attention of tho authorities. That city will be found to have had the best of the bargain whioh has takou early advantago of tho situation to adopt an elastic and woll-considered system which may grow with the city's growth, rather thau the one in which this important matter has boon loft to the eccentric morcios of chanco. The mooting of persons interested in the promotion of nioralitj' whioh was held yesterday, under the jiresidenoy of the Primato, represents a class of effort which must oommand the sympathies of all who realiso that of most of the evils and troubles which grieve and perplex society moral ovils of some kind or other lie at the root. Opinions differ, and probably will always diffor, as to the direction this effort should take and the measure of success likely to attend it. But these differences do not weaken the conviction that tho duty is one to whioh tho best forces of society aro imperatively summoned, to work at it unremittingly, uuweariodly, in the face of all kinds of failure and discouragement, if only for the ameliorating influence of the ." effort itself. " No one would wish to say a word to wonken such hu attempt. But, strongly holding these viows as we do, and crediting the promoters of tho move- ment with the best iutontions, we cannot ' but opprehend for them dangers and difficulties of a serious kind in connection with the Vigilance Association which they determined to ostablish. The very title is one whicli has unfortunate associations of moro kinds than one. .Any such movement ns this can only succeod by working in co- operation with the best elements of public sentiment, and one of thoso is a strong disliko of anything resembling an inquisitorial interference with matters of private and purely per- sonal lifo. The Bishop was cleurly con- scious of the danger, and recognised it in the words, "The vigilance tobe maintained by such an association as tho proposed one must be of a calm, grave character, and not rashly eager or inquisitive. It must be careful to observe rather than anxious to pry ; it must deal with facts, and not fancies." This is excellently j observed, and could the actiou of i the Association always be kept in accordance with the 'spirit of these words, the danger indicated would bo escaped, or at least minimised. But suoh an association has, lileo all others, to work with imperfect instruments, and with an inovitnblo margin of error. Its agents aro not always wiso and- dihcroot, mid sometimes sadly fail to conform to tho , duo conditions to shun danger and objec- | tlon, And it would only require a singlo , error of the kind the Bishop's words oautlouod the mooting; against to give riso I to a fooliug of public rosemont in the highost degree adverse to^bo success of tho association. With tho recollection in our minds of formor místales and thoir cousoquonoes, it is not desirailo to do inora than to point to tho poril ant to warn tho Association, in the intorost oftho cause it seeks to promoto, to neglect ni precaution against tho danger.

Scienco hai dono its part in the matter ; practical expirimont ana the uclual experience of the wirking experts in tho trade must do titi rest. It is in effecting practical adjustmnts of tho kind required that the experiuents such as that under notice aro most ueful, and it is to bo hoped that they w11 ba maintained as long ns there is auythiig to bo learned nnd anything wanting tuna giving lull effect to the method. No couutry is more interested than Austnlia in the full mastery and the exteaive utilisation of the capabilities of the freezing and chilling processes in he conveyance of porishablo articles of food from the point of prodi> tion to the consumer. Wo may sty that no place is moro interested than Üe colony of New South Wales. We havj made a beginning in tho application <* tho method to the transit of meat ; we havi now to apply it in a similar way to th( conveyance of fruit.
