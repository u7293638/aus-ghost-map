Mr Irving has certainly done that He has grown very much in favour, and his last sea son was more profitable than his first, with out the stimulus of novels I do not think the judgment of competent critics has changed must li as to his defects, or even his vices, but the positive qualities of his acting his vivid and vigorous imagination, his sensibility and in some phases of his art, his broad by pipe lines and great refinement have won their way. It was, however, a grateful surprise to me of those who heard his little speech to find how simple and forcible, how well balanced and musical, his elocution is when he does not feel constrained to be artificial Two things have done much one directly and the other indirect!., to make Mr Irving greatly liked in the United States the list is the liberality and judgment he has shown in giving to his audience at all times a first rate performance as to where his company has been us good in its way as be, his mounting of his pieces, his costumes, I I'm in ture, Keener, find all the details that go to please the eye and rest the mind, have been carefully and skilfully and generously managed This is in strong contrast to what we have been used to, for most of our " star ' actors and actresses have been content to rely on their own light, and, indeed, have tried to brighten it by contrast with the club ness of their surroundings, personal and material Of Mr Irving's company, Miss 1 Hen Terry has won quite as much appre cotton and regard as has he and Mr '1 crisis has been only second to them, while the whole company have been honest, intelligent, trained, and efficient The second point in Mr Irving's favour has been the kindly hospitality which he had shown to American actors in 1 England I hope he lost nothing at home by this, and I know he gained much here The last days of Mt Irving in the United States were saddened by the sudden death of the Scotch sculptor, Mr George 1 dwts 1 wing, to whom he was greatly attached, and of a horse he had made a pi out in Mr J wing, who made the statue of lions at Glasgow, and had done much excellent work abroad, had not met with great success in this country, whither he came late in life Mr living found dead with his fortune ula low ebb in Philadelphia, and promptly commissioned him to make two medallions of bronze in bus relief of himself in the character of Hamlet, at the moment of the appearance of the Ghost, and of Miss'lerij as Ophelia, before her madness 1 to enable Mr 1 wing the better to pursue his labours Mr living had installed him in rooms at his hotel he had completed the medallions, and was preparing other work when he was found dead in his bed Though there were circumstances that at first suggested suicide, it was found on investigation that death had been caused by heart disease Mr Irving had the remains interred, the unfortunate sculptor being without property '1 bete has been nothing very noteworthy in the proceedings of Congress for the past month The 'Tariff Hill has been under so called discussion, but with few exceptions the speakers have been threshing out old straw Of the exceptions the most notable were a careful speech by Mr Abram Hewitt, elaborating the ideas which have already been noted in The At tins, and a very brilliant and eloquent speech by Mr Frank Reid, who enjoys the distinction of being a Radical fice trailer, elected year after year from a mining district in Ohio, against the the opposition of the mineowners It is- till improbable that one thing can be done in Congress in this session, but it is certain that the downfall of protection is approaching The most significant fact in this connexion is the formation in Massachusetts, the former stronghold and hotbed of protection, of a powerful tariff reform league, of which the leaders are prominent and able men from each of the now principal parties This movement looks to the formation of a new party on the tariff reform basis, unless one or other of the parties should accept the programme of the league " Aviova'i'ennjson's miscellaneous poems,' writes a correspondent of the Pall Mall 0s Iii, "you will find one entitled'Dom,' and if you will then take the second series of Miss Slitlords stones 'Our Village,' and examine a tale there called 'Dora Cresswell,' and compare it with the poem you will find them almost identical Dom is the heroine in each Walter and Mars are two more personages in the poem William and Mary in the rule 'The plot, with the exception of the termination, which is somewhat altered in the poem, is exactly the same in each Altogether the singular coincidence may be worth noting To Cimr.
