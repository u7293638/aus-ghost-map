^®^»a^y Council and the Education Question. CONDEMNATION .OP THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE 00URIEE8 REPLY. The Coumeii has been favored with copies of the Pastoral letter of the Catholic Archbishops and Bishop Augtraha assembled in the second Plenary Council. It is aecesaarifc a very lengthy document. We quote the passages having reference to tho Education question, as coming from such a high authority they must more especially at the present time, b» ieB«uwi as ot supremo importance by Catholics and Protestants alike ;— ' Our Divine Redeemer has fore* yarned us that our loyalty to Him will be tested severely. To prove our discipleship we shall be called upon to take up the cross. If we are ?worthy of Him we must be prepared t6 face the scorn of the whole woria, and forego every comfort— houses ana lands, home and the love of friends. Hia commands have also proved prophetic. His Church has stood out through the ages, unique and unmis takable for her devotion to His cross. Hia enemies at one time strovn tn tear away from Him, or to leave her „ widowed of the children she had begofc- '* ten in the Gospel, by torments and death. They failed; they only brought discomfiture upon themselves and upon the powers of darkness. But the Prince of this world pursues his way unweariedly, and suits hia methods of attack to the genius of each age. He no longer incites to open attacks on account of religion _- nor counsels confiscation -d' foments? His aim, however, is not less deadly.'-' He seeks to poison the springs (*-' Catholic life, the home and the school! Herein the entire growth of each gen-V».-., eratton takes place. You cannot dis-f ^ Bociate them as agencies in the for^-fe mationand development of mind and f heart. Let but indifference to the -*\ claims of Christ upon our loyalty onca get established in the home and in the school, and the character of the new ecuoLu,Kiuuwiuueaecia6aiyuncnristian. ?&? We have spoken to you of the chief dangers that beset the home. Let qs-'1*' warn you of those which lark in. tne school. You, Catholic parents,' would not commit your children's education to teachers who made no seoret of - ? their wish to proselytise them. WdfS$-. canconceve of no Catholic parent so' 'V callous. But remember that there is such a thing as unintentional, unconscious proselytism, a pros elytism which is more likely to be effectual than when it is avowed. No child, no student will refuse deference and credit to the ' teaoher, if tha latter is at all qualified for his position. Instinctively the learner trusts at once to the authority '*' and the -competence of his teacher. And is it possible that two minds can remain in active communication, in friendly relationship with each other, for years nerhaus. the, nna endmi'mn'ra and receptive, the other authoritative, instructing and directing, without producing impressions far more pro found and lasting than what is ordin arily contemplated in the school course ? It ia only right and proper that the teacher should so influence the child. It is his duty to do so. But if the teacher knows the Catholic religion but imperfectly, which, unless he is a Catholic, will certainly be the case— if, consequently, he views life and its mahifol(iobiigations_from a standpoint which is not Catholic, howls rr^ssible'v' for his intercourse with his pupils, honest and conscientious as he may be, not to result in predisposing them against the faith of their baptfam? We_have always insisted, and we shall always insist, that religion must be positively taught at school as well as - m the home. Less than this will nofc^ suffice to secure the necessary insf— 'tt*^ tion in religious knowledge. jr ^n?f^[ exercises of school, like those -£, $£' - ougrtt to open with m*SfofJt ? ought; to he..-, leavened ^P^ticf ligious observances thtt^^h-^-,'; Tfcis is essential to a teft^^^s. \ oiic ?education, and Catholics ?v ^ ?aoi rest ccruo.nfc- with less.

But remove him from these salutary influences ; cast him ?with his plastic, unformed nature into the midst of companions, who at- all 'events do not review morals from the standpoint of Gatholic faith ; whose twmes have not a uniform stand ard of morals ; who belong to eaots and communities hold ng vetf diverse opinions on most prac tical life questions ; and all of whom feel that in the school religion, with its sanctions, is more or less a forbidden subject ; are we to expect that children of tender years, of immature judgment yet developing passions, will con tiane to observe stoical seli pestraiftt from the beggarly motives supplied them in the moral in structions approved by secularists ? They who think they will must be singularly ignorant of what passes : they who are satisfied to expose the .children to such a perilous experiment mfist set little store by the moral purity of. the rising generation. Henc*. Catholic parents are not justi fied by ordinary necessities in sending their children to such Echools. Under extraordinary difficulties their efforts to counteract the evil influences of such surroundings, as well as the special vigilance which the master may be supposed to exercise, will doubtless be seconded by special graces from heaven. The Holy Ghost measures His aids by the needs that cpj O'.it for them ; but such needs must ; Sot be of our own choosing ; when we ' ' unnecessarily expose ourselves or our i charge to danger, we forfeit our claim tells us thai ftiey who love the danger Sih≪ perish, in it. And hence, when ever it ia possible to maintain a Catholic school, there the pastor and the parents will be accountable to our Divine blaster, if through inertness they, suffej His little ones to be eeanda&'sed, to be seduced from that saving doctrine which He came on earth ho teach them, and from that ' holy conversation and that everlasting life which He died upon the cross to bestow on them. His words should ever nng in me ears 01 mose wno have charge of youth. To parents and pastors they are a dreadful warn ing : ' He that shall scandalise one of these little ones that believe in ile, it were hotter for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the gee.' (Matthew yriii., 6) ' But it 13 needless, we rejoice to know, to dwell upon the duty of pro viding Catholic education for our Catholic children. Surely Aus tralasia has by this learned that we Catholics ape of one mind on this patter, and that we are as resolute as we are unanimous. It is a singularly short-sighted policy in those who pro fess a patriotic concern for the future of this great land to encourage, at this critical Etage of its national de velopment, a system of administration which strikes at liberty of conscience, and is an- outrage upon justice. 'When Catholics protest against a form of iHstruction for their children which has been devised contrary to their wishes, and when they declare that they may not, without doing violence to their conscientious convictions, avail of it, are they not warranted in si- -assarting their political rights ? Who but Catholics shall be the judges of what are the religious convictions of Catholics '? Or has it come to this, that our age of progress and equality, and political freedom, is drifting rapidly towards an odious, hypo critical servitude ? Shall Catholics be told that they must not have religious convictions ; that they must \- ,it claim to save for their divine Vaster i-ue nine ones wno nave oeen 1 i^-ga they, who have been baptised \/$rae Catholic faith; that Catholic :X*rent3 shall be deprived of one of the 'O^^sacred rights inherent in them, j until they are able to sweep the polls by the brnte logic of numbers ?

The nation, in com mitting the supervision of its educa tional work exclusively to a paid department, and ousting the Church from its councils, is closing its ears to invaluable counsel. It is not by hostility and separateness that the forces of the commonwealth are com bined and directed to a common development, or that the various elements of power are knit and com paci^d together. It is unpatriotic to me lass degree k- aepnve sue oiate oi that influence which would result from inspecting the free spirit of a people who put conscience before wealth and eomfort. We are confident that the time is not far off when the intelligence and justice which distinguish our fellow country-men will enable them to look at this great question from a higher standpoint than they seem to regard it ai uresent : and we feel sure that ?r -»- ?- ? once they grasp its real significance no prejudice against the Catholic Church, no senseless apprehensions of Catholic ascendency, will prevent them doing justice to their fellow eitizens, and Irealing the open sore which is at present poisoning the national life. But in the meantime our course is clearly defined. We must push on the work which we took up ?ftith the inception of the secular system. We must extend the influence of our Catholic school work to the ntmmi lirrrft -nrffliin nnr rco/»h Wo took up the gage of battle more than twenty yeara ago, relying on God and on the sterling loyalty of our people to their conscientious convictions, and it is with profound gratitude and rene wed courage we now review what has been achiefed, and set our hands hi concert to prefect what has been so happily begun. * ♦ * Hence forward the people of these colonies can have no misgivings either as to the attitude of the Catholic Church towards the State on the place which the religion of Catholics must hold in any educational provision to which Catholics have a claim, or on the un doubted unanimity which prevails be tween priests and people on this im portant subject. .Nor is it any longer a mere matter of conjecture what the future of the Catholic schools will be. That future is determined by the loyalty of Catholics themselves to their faith, their solicitude for the spiritual safety of their children, and by the unique economies which the religious associations of the Church bring to bear upon the practical solution of the question. Our schools are assured. Whether our fellow-citizen3 wake up to a sense of national justice or not in treating this issue, we will go on as we have begun ; we will not suffer our children to drink at the poisonous founts of a godless system of know ledge.
