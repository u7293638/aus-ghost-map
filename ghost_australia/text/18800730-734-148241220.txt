All that was -'?'?left was the lamp-post and sign-board. About the last Act in- the -Kelly Drama, relating to the discovery and capture of that outlawed partjy'-i»\bi»« which we cannot resist Inserting for the benefit of our readers. We copy -that portion of the aceount where the Police had the party to all intenta secure in the hotel at Wangaratta. " We were watch ing the attack from the rear of the Station at the west end, when suddenly we noticed one or two of gthe men on the extreme righjfc, with their backs turned to the hotel, fifing at something in Jihe bjisli. Presently we noticed a very tall figure in white, stalking Blowly along in the direc tion of the hotel. There was* no head risible, and in the dim light of morning, withfthe steam rising from the ground, it looked, for all the world, like the ghost ot H-amlet'a father with no head, only a very long, thick neck. Those who were standing with me did not see it for some time, and I was too intent on watching its movepaeits to point it out to other*. The figure continued gradually to ad vance, stopping «very now sand then, and moving what looked like its headless neck slowly and mechaniely round, and then raising one foot on to a log, and Aiming and firing a revolver. Shot 'after ^skot was fired at it, but without ef fect, the figura"gemoraily replying by*tap ping the butt end of its revolver against its neok, the blows ringing <out with the .clearness and elistinctuefj* of a-bell ia the morning air.; It certainly was "the most extraordinary sight r I ever saw in my lifcj, and I fell fairly 6p.ell-bound with wonder, and 1 could, not stir or speak. Presently the fignre| moved towards a dip in the ground near to some white dead timber, and, more men coming up, $re 'firing got warmer. Still the. figure; kept erect, tapping its neck and using its ?weapons on its assailants. At this mo ment I lioftced a man Sri a small round twfcfed hat stealing up on the left of the figure, and when within about thirty paces of it firing low two ehot^in fquiclc succession. The figure staggered and reeled like a drunken man, and in a few mcHrtfents afterwards fell near. the dead timber. The spelLwas then broken, and we all rushed forward to see the end, and what our ghostly antagonist was. Quick er than 1 can write it, we were upon him, the iron mask was t-orn off, and there, in the.ibrpad light of day, were the features of the veritable bloodthirsty JNed Kelly himself I" Those of'our readers, who have opportunities of seting the Colonial | Papers will know what followed.
