CHAPTER II, — (CoNtraroiax) ' One Germain de Lagny tells the story in his account of Russia, translated by John Bridgman and published by Bogue. In 1760, Madame Lapukin, a rare beauty, the envy of the Czarina, said to have be trayed the secret of the empress's liaison with Prince Razpumowsky,was condemned, in spite of the privilege of the nobility never to suffer the punishment of the knout, to be publicly whipped and her tongue torn from the roots ! Think of it. This lovely woman, who had been feted and caressed by society, the beauty of a luxurious Court. She was stripped, sub mitted to other indignities, and her flesh cut into strips from her shoulders to her Mpg. Her tongue wag torn out, and then with a refinement of cruelty which is carried out to this day, ehe was sent into hospital and cured of her wounds suffi ciently to enable her to be marched to Siberia. She did not die by the way, but lived to be recalled by Peter the Third in 1762\. When I saw that face at the opera I eai4 to myself it might have been the face of Madame Lapukin, waiting for a opportunity of vengeance, aad when' the Academy announced their subject I thought of that terrible tragedy^ aiyl I saw the woman niiuieteiing to the dying on the road to Siberia, prayiiig for death as she must 'have done, and seeing more fortunate ones stumble and fall, to be left in the wind and the snow, that was not so cold and bleak as man's inhumanity. I saw her moved by the tender impulse of her sex in the nlidst of her own suftef ing to lay a gentle hand upon the shrinking arm of hfer fellow prisoner, and followed hy the Cossack's rough 'interposition, and then I saw that look of hate, of unavenged grief, of tiger-Ike defiance that fascinated me in the face draped by the opera * curtains^ Around this incident grew at once all the rest, and I have Written right across in my mihd*s eye, * Tragedy.* ' '¥du are a brave* wonderful fellow,' said Dick, rising and taking him by the hahdj 'if you were not a painter to have tbis outcome for your feelings, or a poet to put them into print, you would be a Nihilist, aiid possibly a victim to some mad plot to overtake the future by blow ing up the Winter Palace, and shouting 'Victory* as you fell under the crashing timbers.*' ** Do you thiak so ?' he said, with & sad smile, the ftblbr returning to his face, which had become* as pale as the imaginary Lapukin's, while he was telling the T*t)in.an.'e story. ' I do | but this saves you,' pointing to the sketch j ' and it is a greater power than dynamite, a bigger reformer than the' knife or the revolver. Put your heroism into your pictures, Philip, and I will forgive you for not being a politician.' ' That's all right,' said Philip j ' any how we shall always be friend©, and iS' I can salisy your critical opinion, I shall be Content to lose the JnedaL'?

'But I. don't make any sweeping criti cism fpr or against any cfpera or any composer,' Philip replied. ' * Carmen ' always appealed to nie somehow for its utter naturalhesa. I ma/ be wrong ; I dare say I am. 'Well,1t w^as at the scene whe^e Michavel tries to persuade the sol-iier lover to go home — the scene with the banditti in the .mountains, you know— when I wfcs suddenly conscious of a new presence in the house, not upon the stage, but in the theatre. I had glanced aside for a moment, and in the box immediately opposite — Lady Marchmbunt's box, in fact— -I saw a face partially hidden among the curtains, pale, earnest, with great black eyes, and a halo of dark red hair j the lipB were parted, the face all eager and wonderfully beau tiful, and it seemed tome as if the eloquent' eyes fell upon mine. I was fascinated ; as I gazed, the face gradually withdrew into the shadow of the box. When the act 'was at an end I visited Lady Marchmount. While I shook hands with her ladyship, I looked round her box.. * You expected Lord Maichmount ?' she said. ' He is obliged to be at the House j but I think he will come before the end of the last act. My girls are with their aunt j I am quite alone. Will you not sit ?' I thought she seemed to be talking and explaining why she was alone for the sake of putting me ofE my inquiry as to the lady who was in the box during the bandit scene; I d»n't know what made me think so. * But the lady,' I said, ' who was here a few minutes since ?' * What lady?' she asked. * She was at the. back of the box,' I said. ' I have had no visitor that I am aware of, except yourself.' * I beg your pardon, perhaps it was in the next box j I am sure you will forgive my curiosity, Lady Marchmount, but it was a very remarkable and beautiful face, and it went straight home to my imagination as j the very face I want for a picture I am ? going to paint.' ' That is a convenient excuse you artists make for introductions to' pretty women, but I have had no lady in nty box to-night. If, however, you are in searck of beauty, what say you to Madame Petronovitch?'. She indicated the royal box with, her fan, and handed me her glass. lt I looked over the way and saw a hand some, foreign-looking woman chatting1 with a distinctly Russian officer j both ani mated, the lady evidently happy, the officer somewhat constrained in his man ner, and with, as I thought* a cruel mouth and a cold, resolute eye. * General Petro novitch/ said Lady MaTchmount, ' the famous Russian diplomat aud soldier, making a tour of Europe by way of honeymoon, coupled with official business, is to honor the Italian Court during1 the coming festivities at Venice ; a compliment to Italy which troubles France and does not delight Gel tna&y.; Lord Marchmount was to have come to bring the General to my box, and no doubt will. Won't you stay?' 'Thank you, Lady Marchmount,' I said, ' I have a friend who is a stranger in town ' — whieh was perf ©atly true ; a young fellow to whom my mether was anxious 1 should pay attention. So I left the box, and iriade a survey of the house from various points, but my mysterious and beautiful vision was nowhere to be seen.' 'It was not a vision after all, eh ? not a dream face, incident and all?' *♦ No, it was a reality, and I cannot help thinking Lady Marchmount had some reason for saying she had no other visitor except myself.' '' But surely she would not have told a deliberate lie about it P' ' She might have done so with a reser vation/' 'But why?' *?* Ah, there you bring me to a dead atop.' *? Would it have been possible for the lady to have gone inte the box and Lady Marchmount not to have seen her f' ' Yes, if the door had been left open, and Lady Marchmount had been deeply in terested in the play; but she was not. Her interest was in the Russian party in the royal box.' ' Was the stranger long in the box ?'' ' About as long as it took me to tell you of her.' ' She was very much in earnest, you say ; was Bhe deeply interested in the operd, ?' ** On reflection it . seems t© me she must have been directing her gaze upon the Russian box 5 and jet also I fancied she looked at me as well. But the incident waB brief, and what struck me waB the wonderful, 6ad tragic beauty of the face.' ?c Madame Lapukin's ghost, Phil 1' ' No ghost,' e&id; the artist, his eyes upon the face he had drawn.
