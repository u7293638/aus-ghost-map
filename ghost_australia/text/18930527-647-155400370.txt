'Joy in the Holy Ghost.' This is a Scriptural phrase. It is I often on the lips of Christians. What is meant by i*j ? It means that it is such a joy as only the Holy Ghost can impart. Hence it is a unique joy. There is no other like it. It follows, therefore, that it cannot be imitated with any success. Without it, one may say joyful things and sing joyful songs and shout joyful hallelujahs ; but this is the mere clatter of externalism — a pious pedantry play ing with the paraphernalia of religion. Joy in the Holy Ghost is joy begotten by the Holy Ghost— by his indwelling, by his teachings, by his love, by his persuasions, by his buoyant comfort, bv his explicit directions, by his warnings, and by his reproofs. It is a joy which is according to the faith of its possessor. Little faith in him brings little joy, while great faith brings great joy. But great faith implies great obedience. For one to say that'lie has great faith in the Holy Ghost, and yet habitually disobeys him, is to contradict himself ; and, be sides, it pronounces the fact that he has no high or exuberent joy in him. Re member, too, that joy in the Holy Ghost means joy in the power of the Holy Ghost. It is not joy in one's faith in him, nor in one's obedience to him, nor yet in one's love to him ; but rather and especially in his power — the power of his character, his love, his wisdom, his sympathy and forbearance and tenderness and fidelity. Such a joy, thus bred and bounded and broad ened, makes mellow-hearted and mighty Christians.
