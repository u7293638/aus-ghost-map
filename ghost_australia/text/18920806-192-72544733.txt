HAWKESBURY ELECTION. Thus the " Australian Star" in a sub leader in Monday's issue : Owing to the candidature of Mr. Fitzpatrick the election for the Hawkesbury has resulted in the return of Mr. Burdekin. It is quite clear that if the contest bad been between Mr. Morgan and Mr. Burdekin the former would have re ceived a majority of the votes. Everybody knew that Mr. Fitzpatrick had not a ghost of a chance of gaining the vacant seat, and the general belief was that he would probably lose his deposit money. Consequently people were surprised at his decision to see the fight right through. Scores of persons have expressed the opinion that he stood in Mr. Burdekin's interest; in our judge ment, however, it was the man's vanity that im pelled him to take the course he did. He is a single-taxer, and it is notorious that single-taxers are the vainest of men. The wage-earners at Riverstone went pretty solidly for Mr. Fitz patrick, and in so doing played right into the hands of the candidate in whom they had least confidence. During the past week many ol the supporters of the latter have been laughing at their conduct; they never had a high opinion of the intelligence of the working-man, but it is lower now than ever it was. Numbers of the citizens are probably surprised that Mr. Burde kin did not nave a larger majority over the gentle man who was second on the poll; they thought that the money power at the back of the candi date would completely pulverise that opponent They are not sorry, we may suppose, to find they were mistaken. Mr. Burdekin has gained the seat for the Hawkesbury, but it is by no means a safe one for him: and the probability is that he will lose it at the next general election.
