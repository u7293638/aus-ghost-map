The amendment was negatived Dr HEARN said that the definition of "vermin" was as follows - "The word 'vermin' shall include kangaroos, wallabies and other marsupials, dingoes or native dogs, dogs run wild, dogs ut large, rabbits, and any other animal or any other bird which the Governor in Council may by proclamation in the Government Gazette declare to be vermin for the purposes of this act." Native bears were perfectly harmless and he moved that the words, "and other mar- supials be struck out. On the motion of Colonel Sargood, Dr Hearn was appointed Acting Chairman of Committees, in the absence of Dr Dobson. Colonel SARGOOD said he had no objec- tion to accepting the amendment and strik- mg out the words "and other marsupials" from that portion of the interpretation clause relating to vermin. The amendment was agreed to. Mr 1 UCUANAN moved that lo\es be in eluded in the definition ot vermin loxes were getting very troublesome Mr CUIH15LR1 opposed the amendment Foxes furnished _ood «pert and it would be useless to impose too many tusks upon the teuunts Mr MACBAIN supported the amendment Rabbits were once considered game, but they had proved a greater evil even than dry weather. Mr. MELVILLE said that foxes were very numerous in the Lancefield district. Mr BROMELL observed that foxes were first turned out on the Werribee Plains, and that they had spread very much. Foxes should not be protected for hunting purposes. This was not a hunting country. Mr HAM thought that a fine should be inflicted on hunting gentlemen who let loose such vermin. Mr /DAL said snails had been imported, and were proving a great nuisance in gardens 'i here were too many varieties of acclimatised nuisances here '1 he amendment was agreed to Mr CAMl'l 1 LL moved that hares be in eluded in the definition of vi mun Mr M'CULLOCil objected to this amend ment.

Tne SPEAKER.-I will take care that the lion, gentleman is not too lute on the next occasion (Laughter.) Mr. NIMMO.- The business of the country should not be interfered with every time races take place One night we have the Premier urging the House to get on with the business 01 tlie country, and very properly objecting to lion, members making second leading speeches on the various clauses of the Railway Hill, and now he proposes to ad- journ in order that we may give our counte- nance to a system ol gambling that is sapping the foundations ot socieey. Mr JAMES-Hear, hear. The SPEAKER.-'Hie lion member is not in order unleaa he proposes to move the uci journmeiit ot the House. (Laughter.) RAILWAYS CONSTRUCTION BILL. This bill was further considered in com- mittee. Mr. M'LEAN moved that a line be con- structed between Rosedale and Yarrum, lor a long time the line hod been advocated, because it would connect the old established districts ot North und South Gipps Land, but the principal reason was that it would open up a large area of lund between Roseda'e and Y in ram West. Tliei e were over 300 selectora in the district, who hud to expend £2 or J.3 per acre before the lund could be cleared for grazing, and tour or live times thoBe amounts belore it could be made lit for iigricultuie. They had settled on the land as soon as the Rnilvviiy Uni uf the late Government, which included this line, was passed by the Aa sembl), and ii the) were denied railway com- munication they would have to face a lite and-death struggle, und many would have to abandon their holdings. If the Government thought the cost too great, he would be satiBlied if the line were only carried as inr as the selections, and not to Yarram, and would be prepared to accept a very light and inexpensive one. Mr. A. HARRIS thought the committee would be guilty of a breuch ot faith if the line were not agreed to. Mr. GILLIES remarked that persons who lind settled in new distucts were entitled to every consideration, but he must repeut what he said to the lion, member for Stawell last night. He recognised the case winch hud been submitted, but must stop somewhere. He would remind lion, members that it was proposed to continue the Great Southern line to Alberton. Mr. M'LEAN.-They will not be able to get to the Great Southern line. Mr. GILLIES-Alter all, they would only be a few miles irom Rosedale, nnd there were thousands ot peraons in the colony who were not within 30 miles ot a railway. (Hear, hear.) The Government had done the best they possibly could lor both North and South Gipps Land, and he hoped the lion, members in luvonr ot the line would recognise that fact, and help the Government to pass the bill us soon us possible. The line was negatived. Mr GRAVES moved that a line bo con- structed from Moyhu to the North-eastern line between Benalla und Wangaratta.. The line passed thiough thickly settled dis- tricts, and would serve tour townships. It was a lertile country, growing tobacco, hops, und Indian corn, and the line would be ex- tremely proutable. It was possible, and indeed some bon. members thought it was probable, that if the evidence of the Railway Commissioners was taken at the bur-ot the House, some ot the lines which the Govern- ment hud included lu their bill would be struck out. But the Railway Commissioners weie placed in a very pecuhur position. Mr. GILLIES.-Is it necessary to discuss that now ! (Hear, hear. ) Mr. GRAVES-Distinctly so; for if the Railway Comtmssioueia are examined on the third reading ot the bill, their opinions ma) influence the House. Mr. WOODS -What do they know about the proposed lines more than we do Î The members oi tina Ilouse know more about them than all the commissioners put together. Vou might na well ask them to tianslute Sanscrit. (Laughter.)

Mi. MACKAY.-Was it fair for the Echuca people to try and prevent the pi oponed line V What right have they to prevent there being any crossing-place on the Murray for 200 miles! He did not* simpatlnse with tlie clieese-parimrnnd foolish policy of Echuca, for he thought that Echuca itself would benefit ultimately by the Swan-lull line, the trade on the river would so inciease. An accusa- tion waa made that an unholy combination existed between Sandhurst and Ballarat us to the Swan-lull line. Sandhuist concerned itself hut to a ver) small extent about the proposed extension The members had taken action from a sense of the lair claims of the district. Twenty )euis ago the Swan lull line was pointed out by stutesmen in the house as a grand trunk route to teeuie trnfhc Irom Riverina to Melbourne. The River Murray was oneil navigable as farasSwun-hiU, when not to Echuca. Weie the settlers to the north to receive no consideration?* Thov wanted u munis ot curry ing their pioduceto inurkct '1 he line was a cheap one , it would go through a line counti), well suited lor irrigation, and it would be ol national sei vue, commanding tlie trade to the noith, Irom the Murrumbidgee to the Mulray It the Govern- ment persisted in going against the line, they would do themselves no good Mr. OFFICER thought a gieat deal might have been said in tavour oi the Kerang to Swan lull line in regaid to seeuiing the Dur liug River trade*, mid lor mum other reasons he would have auppoiteil the Kerang to bwup- hill line, but ho euuld not support the Boort to Kelling line.

The motion was for a hue trom Keiang to Swan-hill, and the lion, member for Rodney got the Boort and Ballarat members to vote against it, telling them that if such a line wns passed it would ruin the trade ma Kchuc.i By that means he got them to negative the line trom Kerang to Swan lull. Mr. MOORI!-With a view of putting m Boort line alterwards (Laughter ) Dr. QUICK -When the Boort line was pro posed the bon. member for Rodney got the members tor S Midhurst to join in rejecting it iilso,andthiitwustheuntortunateehmnv which brought about a most ridiculous and absurd result (Laughter ) Although there were fil members-more than an absolute majority of the House-ni lavour ot the Swan lull line, and onl) 17 mombcig against it, hi the most skilful manipulation on the part of the lion, member for Echuca, pla)ing Ballarat against Sandhurst anti Sandhuist against Ballarat, the line was tlnown out. He men- tioned these melancholy facts not with the intention of lellecting upon bon. mem- bers, but in the hope ot getting them to reconsider the position. (Heal, hear.) It was clearly the intention ot the Legisla- ture when they passed the line to Kerang th.it the rail wat should be carried on to Swan bill. He regietted that anything he said should injure Echuca, but he must again point out that the Murray ottered gieater facilities for navigation below than above Swan-hill. He undersood that certain assertions made by liiinselt and other lion, members with íegnu' to the Swun-hnll line and Echuca wore senonsly and tiercel}-chal- lenged at a meeting held at Echuca on Satur- day last, nnd that he and other lion mem- bers weie strongly denounced. K'oi a reply to what was stated at that meeting, he would refer bon. members to the resolution passed at an indignation meeting held at Swan lull on Monda) last, which eleni ly set forth the ilvantiges Swan-hill olleied bevoud those ot Echue i, and stated that the opposition of the Echuca people was sellish and unjustifi- able. Mr WHEELER would very much like to vote foi the line from Kerang to Swan-hill, as he was tully persuaded it was one of the most important extensions thai, could be made ; but it the Government lesistcd the line, and were not going to inciense their borrowing powers, he could not ieel justified in supporting the railway. Mr. M'lNTYIlli -Oh, nobbled again. Mr. WHEELER was very pleased that the Government and House had adopted praeti- ] call)' the same lines as were included in the I tormei hill, which was so loudly denounced, and subjected to so much scurrilous enticism.
