EMU BAY. ( From our own Correspondent.) A congratulatory address is being pre- pared for presentation to the new Min- ister of Lands, by the residents of the Emu Bay district. A rival candidate would not stand the ghost of a chance. The "Telegraph to Circular Head" has vastly increased our local member's popu- larity, and will prove a nail in the coffin of an opponent, should one venture to enter the lists. Then there are many other improvements in prospective that are confidenily expected to follow, and which I am not inclined to make public at present for fear of exciting ridicule ; but natural consequences of the increased influence of a man directly interested in the welfare of the N. W. Coast. He has shown himself willing to give us some- thing for our money, and we are ready to show our gratitude by giving him our un- divided support. The prospects at Mount Bischoff bid fair to exceed the most sanguine expecta- tion. Some visitors just returned from a trip to the mines, inform me that there are mountains of tin, the nuggets that have been found varying in weight from Â½ cwt. to 4 cwt. are merely specimens that have become detached from the solid mass. A couple of these lumps are on their way down to be forwarded to Launceeton for inspection. Rain continues to fall daily, at about the rate of a couple of showers in the morning and one in the evening, with now and again a couple of wet days and then a faint glimpse of the sun just to take the chill off.
