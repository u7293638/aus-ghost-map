The courageous fellow would not return to bod, but remained watching for some time. Presently he nv the bed shake violently; the floor was firm; nothing moved but the bed. Determined, if possible, to find out the cause of this bed-quake, he looked in the bed, under the bed, and near the lied, and not seeing anything to account for the shaking, which every now and then seemed to seize on the bed, he at last pulled it from the wall. Then the " murder came out.' The signboard of the inn was fastened (o tin- outer wall by a nut and screw, which came through to the back of the bed, and when the wind swung the signboard to and fro the movemeat was communicated to the bed, causing it to shake in a most violent manner. The gamekeeper, delighted at having hunted up the ghost, informed the landlord the next morning of the real nature of his unearthly visitor, and was handsomely rewarded for rendering a room, hitherto useless, now quite serviceable.
