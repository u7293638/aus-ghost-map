THE MELBOURNE PRESBYTERY AND THE SCOTS OBLIGED. to THE laurel or the Aitaus. SIR-It would be as well, perhaps, if out siders, such as "A Member of the Church of England" and others, would leave the "Strong controversy alone Nothing that these gentlemen can say will in the slightest degree affect the settlement of the question and certainly their expressions of B) sympathy will in no way benefit the clergyman whom they are anxious to befriend Nor will it help him much to receive the public assurance that the Rev J R. Wardrop accords with his views," and has ceased to read the Southern Cross The question at its present stage is one which concerns PresbytcrtaiiB alone, and our church is quite capable of managing its own business Perhaps, however, you will permit me, as in interested party, to refer to some matters on which there seems to be misapprehension The Preabytenanchurches have an historical confession and constitution, in which the powers and duties of its various church courts are clearly defined So, too with the position and privileges of its office bearers Every minister, for instance, solemnly signs the formula of which the following is part - "Town and believe the whole doctrine contains In the standard (specified) of this church as an exhibition of the sense in which I understand the Holy) Scriptures and acknowledge it as a confession of my faith and I promise that through the grace of God I shall firmly and constantlj&adhcre; to the same and to the utmost of my power shall In my station, assert maintain, and defend the said doctrine, worship discipline and government of this church, by sessions presbyteries and general assemblies, and that I shall in my practice conform to the said worship and submit to the said discipline and gol ern mont and I promise that I shall follow no divisive course from the doctrine worship, discipline or government of this church There is no ambiguity here. It is the duty of the presbytery to superintend in all matters the congregations within their bounds ," and it is especially incumbent on them to see that the teaching given is in accordance with the standards In dealing with a minister that is the only question which the presbytery have to consider, and the opinion of his congregation can in now say influence their decision It would not, for instance, in the slightest degree affect the responsibility of the presbytery, if in present circumstances the Scots Church congregation should unanimously express confidence in the teaching of its minister But the presbytery owes a duty to the state as well as to the church The Scots Church does not belong to the congregation It is the property of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria. It enjoy s a large revenue derived from land granted by the state expressly for the maintenance of the principles of that church whose standards are specifically recited in the act of Parliament which secures the property The minister of the Scots Church has vowed to uphold the standards. The pulpit from which he preached, and the church in which his congregation worship, have been for the most part built from money raised on the security of land granted for the support of ordinances in conformity with their standards Both congregation and minister are in all things subject to the jurisdiction of the presbytery, and that body is bound in all honesty to see that faith is kept with the state as well as with itself If any party in the Scots Church _ dissatisfied with the standards it is of course open to them to take the ordinary constitutional means of giving expression to their views. Hitherto they have not done so. Neither in the Scots Church nor elsewhere have the faith taken any action in the matter. If as is assumed, the intelligent laymen in the Presbyterian Church are anxious for a change in the standards why they do not show themselves and formulate their wishes, so that the church may know exactly what they want Mere ignorant railing at the standards is puerile, and a vague cry for greater Christian liberty may mean a demand for permission to take a still greater liberty with Christianity By all means let them be reform where necessary, but it must be by constitutional methods and on Presbyterian lines Meantime, the position of matters is, as you state, that on impression prevails that the minister of the Scots Church does not teach the doctrine of the standards on points which you admit to be vital, and not on a mere trumpery question-such as the creation of the world in six days or the determination of what constituted works of necessity and mercy It is unnecessary to inquire how that susan ion has arisen It is sufficient for my present argument to state that it did not originate in any action taken by the pros bytery On the contrary, it preceded such action, and prevaded extensively, both amongst ministers and laymen, long before the appearance of the article on the stone mont, the publication of which led the presbytery, for the first time, to consider Mr Strong's views and to direct him to make certain doctrines more prominent in his teaching Two years have passed since that decision was given, but rightly or wrongly, the original impression of the drift of Mr Strong's teaching still remains It has, indeed, been intensified by recent events, notably by the reasons assigned for the lecture of Mr Higinbotham, a lawyer and rhetorician of the first rank, but one who has no claim to speak as a scientist or theologian, still less as both That lecture might well have been given in the Town hall, but its delivery in the Scots Church was, in my view, an unwarrantable insult to every loyal Presbyterian Passing from that, however, and reviewing the whole history of the case, I fail to see why the presbytery should be blamed for feeling and expressing any anxiety as to the general tendency of the teaching given in the Scots Church. The matter was forced on them, and they were bound to consider it They may have acted unwisely in their manner of dealing with the case and members of the court may have spoken ready sedan But the presbytery is responsible only for its final decisions, and, like other popular representa- five bodies cannot be held answerable for the vagaries of individuals to call their interference persecution seems to me alike silly and absurd, not less so than your mean ragless attempt to recall the ghosts of old Scottish ecclesiastical distinctions, whose funeral obsequies were celebrated well nigh a quarter of a century) ago But, whilst maintaining that the presby- ter) have all along acted strictly w within their rights, it does not follow that Mr Strong has fairly laid himself open to the suspicions which have undoubtedly been raised It is much more probable that his teaching and his actions have been misunderstood But, however, that may be, if, as you suggest, the matter must forthwith be settled, one way or another, I sincerely hope that the issue will be such that present doubts may be dissipated, and that Mr Strong ina) still remain where he is, beloved by his people, honoured by his church, and esteemed by all men I trust, however, that it will not be necessary to adopt your proposal, and proceed by libel Such a course practically means that Mr. Strong may for one, two, or even three a years de facto cease to be a minister of the church, for a process by libel implies immediate suspension from office It must not be forgotten that the issues at stake on both sides are serious in the extreme and if, indeed, a crisis has come, it the question must be dealt with, it becomes all sober minded men to use every earnest endeavour to secure its speedy and satisfactory settlement And to that end there is surely more need of calm counsel, cool judgment, and temperate language than of vulgar abuse of the presbytery, and the equally vulgar adulation of Mr Strong-I am, "c A SCO 18 CHURCH LAYMAN [Our correspondent has occupied a goodly allowance of space in re stating the old case against Mr Strong, but, as usual with the disputants who take up his side of the question, refrains from recommending any definite course in connexion with the matter Although Mr Strong is "suspected of unsoundness with regard to certain vital doctrines held by the Presbyterian Church, and it is " especially incumbent" on the presbytery to see that the teaching of its ministers is in accordance with the standards, ) at the idea of proceeding to libel 13 deprecated as an extreme step With specious ingenuity our correspondent endeavours to throw the responsibility of action on " an) party in the Scots Church that may be dissatisfied with the standards But this is an evasion of the real point at issue Mr Strong accepts the standards 111 all essential particulars, but claims for himself and his friends a certain degree of liberality in interpreting them His assailants, on the other hand, " suspect " him of serious doctrinal unsoundness, and it is for them, surely, to state their case The onus of proof rests, with them Whoever heard of an accused person being called upon toBtate the case against himself ? It is not for Mr Strong to show that in his teaching he keeps within the standards, it is for his assailants to prove that he contravenes there, There is no escape from this position It is has, ed on the first principles of justice as between man and man, and if the consequent action should be serious the responsibility must rest with Mr Strong s accusers En A E liiEiti are 2,000,000 hives of bees in the United States
