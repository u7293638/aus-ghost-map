GUYRA. Guyba, T*OV. 5. j (from; otte correspokdent. ) - J General Topics.—As I saw no hope in tilling the ground *this season, I determined to repose myself indefinitely, and wait like Mr. Micawber for Bomething to turn up. But being somewhat energetic in disposition I could not remain entirely inactive, and I find much wisdom in the couplet of Cowper— " Absence of occupation is not rest, A mind quite vacant is a mind distressed. So, with your permission, Mr. Editor, I shall send you periodically a little news from our little village, which Mr. Copeland predicts in twenty years hence, , with the fostering encouragement of a i protective policy, will be more important than the Cathedral City. Religious.—The old saw that there are no Sundays this side of the Moonbi, is partially verified in our midst, for the members of oar English Church have never [ seen aparsou from the city for many moons. | There has not been a service in our little i church for many months, with the excep\x=req-\ | tion of the service of Baptism, at the 1 christening of Mrs. George Baiter's two ! fine little babies, last Tuesday, 30th Oct., | at midday. The building stands like » > sheeted ghost, while the members groan I beneath an interdict greater than > that of ( John's reign. If .it were not irre\x=req-\ ! verent, I should > suggest that this eacred | edifice be transformed into a modern ex-1 ! change fox the money changers and Bellera I of doves. Should such a state of affairs , 1 exist ranch longer, we will be under the painful necessity of inviting the Salvation Army to assemble in. our midst, and res\x=req-\ | cue ua. J The Weather.—With the exception of j ' a Blight shower here last week, the weather continues very dry. The days are excessively hot, and the nights cloudy ; rain is much wanted for the grass, and growing crops. Ceicket.—On the Guyra ground last Saturday, our team met the Black Mountain cricketers, but were defeated in one innings and 18 runs. The day was gloriously fine 1 Just the day for leather j hunting. Black Mountain went to the wicket first, and totted up 98, W. You\x=req-\ mans 31, and R. Saunders 32, being the chief scores. Our boys then took the willow, but owing to the splendid trundling of A. Youraan and Saunders were unable to make any stand, and the innings closed for 42.—R. Youmans 14, and J. Edwards 10. Following their innings matters became worse, and in the second attempt the innings closed for 38. X 1 Starr 5, J. Pryer 6, J. Youman 8, and Lawman not out 7, were the only ones having made any stand. Appended are the scores:— Black Mountain—1st Innings. A. Youman, b. Lawman „ W. Youman, c. J. Starr, b. R. Youman 31 R.

Brevities.—The weather if not injurious would be glorious.—Our school is not centrally situated.—That the Guyra R.C. Church is an acquisition to our village.— Mr. Copeland will head the poll at the next election.—That our harbour is get- j ing beautifully low.
