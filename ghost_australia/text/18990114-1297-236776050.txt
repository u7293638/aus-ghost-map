AMUSEMENTS. "IIAMLET" AT THE CRITERION. Mr. Dumpier pleased his best friends at tho Criterion last night by the vigor and tho vivid ness of his representation of Hamlet. Frequently tho actor has been seen in this groat part, but never to such advantage; and his performance may lairiy do uescnocu us a vaiuauio lesson to players — oIho a most interesting ono to the audi ence — in llie Shakesperlan school. Mr. Dampior comes to Ills work with an experience that is not tainted with what Mr. Clement Scott calls tho ac tor's Gregorian. Ho can speak llie speech trip pingly, without cutting It Into formal lengths, and yet contrivo to make a classic impersona tion and its characteristics strikingly interesting. This ho does memorably as Hamlet. Last night Ills invocation to tho ghost was admirably and convMiolngly full of fear, sympathy, and determin ation. This proved to ho the keynote of a most excellent performance, and each "curtain" evok ed general applause. Indeed, it is questionable whether Mr. Dampler ever made a raoro palpable hit in Sydney than this. There wus a very largo audience, and scarcely a scat in the theatre was vacant. It should bo said that tho play was beautifully staged, tho scc-nery bolng unusually fine.' Owing to the success of tills revival, "Hamlet" will ho repeated next Friday night, and a mattneo Is to bo glvon on Saturday. To-night "His Natural Lifo" will bo produced
