Tho Melbourne ITunt Club held their autumn mooting ntKlemington on the Queen's Kirththy, and notwithstanding innumerable couu tor ntlr.'ic- tion3 tbo day's racing v.xs witnessed by a very fair number ol' speetiior?. During tho morning the sky presented a very threatening appoarancc, and just bofore tho start for tho Hc.r.llo Kaco a wet afternoon appeared almost certain 10 ensue. Tho rain, however, held oil' ; and although it. eunnot be euid' that absolute Queens weather prevailed (tie sky bing 07crca«?t at time.?), the atmosphere was cool and pleuiant. Ths recent rain hud not seriously affected the course, which v.a1; in remarkably good order Considerable Jute: est was shown by those present iu the gigantic excavations that Lave hoen mado Tor tho new stand, and general satisfaction expressed at t he increased accommodation beiotf provided by the club for visitors at the next Spring Meeting. Owitiu to tho volunteer review being held iu honor of her Majesty's birthday, his Excellency the Oiovcrnor was nnable to nttend. a circumstance much re gretted by the members of the 'dub, and all who know hovr genuine a sportsman Lord -N'orrnanby is. Punctually to time, proceedings opened with ' tho Hurdle Ilaco, froni which Jiyllus had bc?n Y/ilbdrawn, causing Wild Harry's ohimco to be so highly thought oE that only a slight shade of odds could bo got about the i'aliarut horse. Tbcfnvorilo wns well handled by Scobie, and ran with un flinching garaenuss, but could only get thipl to Stormhird and Merry AT aid. Tho Queen's ittrthduy Stakes was made the medium for a considerable amount of speculation, onr or Ave homes being backed. The winner turned up in Egcrtdh, a son of King Cole," who started at a comparatively outside price. Welcome .Tack, who finished a length behind the' winner, covered himself with glory by currying A si. 0 lb. into such a forward position in a fast run race, tho time boing three-quarters of a second quicker than tbe tot Kcwmarket Handicap. The Stecpieclmse produced a most interesting contest, although the favorite Alliambrn fell when half tbo journey had been accomplished, nnd wns never again in the hunt. Black Jacket, who made tho running from the fall of the flag, led his field hy several lengths until a quarlcr'oC .a mils from homo, when tho severity of the task told its accustomed tale, ' and the brilllnut Ynulier, whoso . fencing was ft treat to witness, collared him at the last fence, and having been most judiciously nursed by Scobie, had plenty left in him for the rnn home, which resulted in Black Jacket boing defeated by four lengths, but hy no means dis graced, his performance being highly .appreciated by the spectators, who cheered the little horse as heartily as tho winner. Stampede, who fell, and was remounted, was placed third, but barely es caped being distanced. The result of the Co rinthian Flat Race was not un altogether satis factory one, .most people -believW that King Charles had won. An unaccountable deluy took place bofore the numbers wero hoisted announcing .King Charles's victory, hut to the great astonish- icnt of those present the hoard was immediately Vweredand Liddiugton placed first, The Ghost 'second, and the previously announced winner ori£v third.
