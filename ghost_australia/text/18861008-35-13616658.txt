Sir HENRY PARKES Shall I now am o am ex- ploration Mr SPEAKER The hon member is perfectly in order in making any explanation he wishes Sir HENRY PARKES I used the words either "the brutal Ministry,"

to me as the best adapted to describe the tactics of the Ministry in forcing debates upon this House at such unseasonable hours In other w jrds, 1 desire in no way to shrink from the consequences of any act of mine, but I desire again to say that I did not use the words in the offensive sense in which they, are frequently used but simply as expressive of my sense of t o w in which the business of the House is now conducted view at the oppose to all my expert once of 1 ultramontane preceding (Oppose is in cheers 1 It in rapid warble to reason in the ordinal y course of sign- ment upon His bit

frequently Other members were lying flat on their backs behind in their seats , some of them making; strange noises when they were sleeping, very objectionable to most persons and altogether the appearances of things were such as I could only describe by the term I used (Hear hear ) I felt myself standing; here with a longer experience of Parliament the many man in this colony, or in any of

additional estimate of £200 000 through Parliament after midnight, when members were utterly is capable of dealing with it I felt that it was a crisis that must bring out the brute instincts of any of us It is calculated to subvert our constitutional rights and liberties with it day after day and night after night, when Ministers Irtngduj n ci day and night after night measure, that there is no chance of discussing and that there is evident j a design to force the GULLY the Houses rightly or wrongly Ihn hon member proceeded to say rrr explanation that it was not because he felt indignant only that he used this term but because he felt that the country had been betrayed and moved (Opposi- tion cheers ) It was because he felt that everyman hero had been converted into a brute He did not wish to shrink from the consequences of the words he used, but he said in conduct ing their business they had a brutal fo co brought into active i Notwithstand- ing that, he had the greatest respect for the Chair, and the greatest desire to obtain order in this House but order was impossible in this House, unless the House were led in a ration a way to the while system of Par harnessing Government was turned upside down if the rights of members were to be torn torn up by the roots, so to speak, and members were to press in various proposals before members at the dead of night till sooner he (sir Henry Parkes) was expelled from the House the greater would be his glory (Cheers Mr SirVKl R It is now for the House to decide whether the words used were in a rider or not Sir PATRICK JENNINGS said he had listened to the remarks of the hon. member for St Leonards, but had failed to destroy or that he had in any degree explained away the Itirm brutal Ministry " that had been used (china terra cheers ) It was all very well for him to come and talk about the conduct of the business of the House by the Government, but why should any organised system defeat the business of the Government'' (Cuts of Question and Order )| He was perfectly in order How could members hay for a moment that he had no right to reply to insulting and offensive expressions which were not correct-not

such a course as had been, pursued V me in offense insole it, or unworthy speech had Lev cr been made in this House than the speech of the member for St Leonards in explaining the words he had used (Ministerial cheers ) Mr SPE KER I must ask the hon. member not to apply the words Glennys and insolent to the remarks of any hon member of this House Sir PA 1 RICK JENNINGS If the hon member for St Leonards gets up and saving is justified in feeling indignant on account of certain acts of the Government, surely I am justified in feeling, indignant at the way in which he attributes improper motives to us However, I will bow to your ruling sir, and withdraw the words 'offensive, insulting, and unworthy," if they are out of order It seems to me that it is impossible for the House to accept the explan itton or the hon. gentleman If the hon gentleman had wanted to say that the measures of the Government were carried by physical force, he could have used the word physical His explanation seemed to imply that that was his meaning If he meant that measures were cr mod by brutal force when he said this brutal Ministry," the term could not admit of explaining away 1 be expression has not

WISDOM repeated that those proceedings were the most contemptible, miserable, and petty that on arrogant majority could be guilty of After several interruptions by members of the Ministry, in the course of which the nature of Mr L Baker was freely Ubtd Mr WISDOM said Some members of the present Gov- comment may refer to Mr Baker, but that has nothing to do with this question in any respect I say this is a most eoutcinpliblo proceeding I say that the leader of the Opposition was perfectly justified in using the word ' brutal," and I now apply the word brutal to them They me the most brutish Ministry I have over seen St PATRiCK JeNNINGS I more that the words "brutish Ministry" be taken down Mr SPEAKE R called the member for Morpeth to order, stating that there was nominal

said he thought that the ayes had it Mr WISDOM That is the way the majority act Mr SPEAKER The words taken down are, "This is a brutish Gov eminent " (No., no ). It is now open for the hon. member to state whether he made use of the words or not Mr WISDOM The words I made use of were " brutal Government, " but I used these words in the sense of mcrerless-tho dictionary sense of the form-and if that is out of order I am quite glad to be so Sir PATRICK JENNINGS In any case the words are highly unparliamentary and ought to be withdrawn Mr SHEPHERD I call for a division (Laughter ) Mr SPEAKER suggested that the hon member for Morpeth should withdraw the expression Mr WISDOM asked leave to expel an Mr SPEAKER desired that the words complained of be submitted, pro forma, in writing,; | Sir PATRICK JENNINGS submitted the expression in willing accordingly Mr SPEAKER It will be for the House now to door - mine whether these words were used, and whether they should be withdrawn Mr W C VOAKE It is not yet stud who used them I distinctly deny that the hon. member for Morpeth made use of the words " brutish Minister v " Mr NEILD stated that the word " British " was simply a rendering from the dictionary, and it was not a term of the hon members Mr "W AN I Oh ' of Mr N L H D added that he had not spoken in the House for a considerable time, but whenever he did he was met with the most unseemly interruption front Ministers (then hear, and laughter ) Hon. member might Iiiuka like any other jacks sea on the dates at early morning, but they were not going to laugh him down An Ho\ MEMBER His day light now 20 minutes to 6 and time that all good wool OSSCB went home to bed (Laughter ) Mr. SHEPHERD (bought that the words must be highly out of order (Loud laughter ) The Minister had co] "d them, and it was simply disgraceful that important business should be terminated at ghost-like and unearth.ly hours, when hint of the low members who took the trouble to remain in the Chamber were saying like rats in their seats, and while the Ministers were in (her own pin the room drinking and "shouting" champagne night and left the order ) Mr SP1 VKrR called the hon. member to order Mr SHEPHERD admitted that on some occasions one xv as went to be led into extreme expressions and at times is one was inclined to be ashamed of holding the position of a member of Parliament [An Hon Member such a one as you Mr MLLIIILF Htm, lient] Who was to v hon. gentleman who cheered? the subservient paid whip of the Government Mr MELVILLE rose to order 'that hon member had no right to address him otherwise than as the hon. member for Northumberland, or by his own name, in connection with his constituents Mr SPEAKER said that the words paid whip" might or might not be offensive The question depended upon the manner in which they were made use of Mr SHEPHERD disclaimed any intention of speaking discourteously, but it was a most remarkable fact that two members of the Ministry were most vociferous in their ejaculations and cheers "Such chief as were in violation and fired it on of the Jloust s solem i rt husband wor t J he Pi timer iv is Krupp sold to le e enacting- tire business on the country but he was was the conduct tig it hit the Speakrih had been sitting in the than for oOjenrshcwouldnothavebe.cn called upon to record the scene which had been enacted that night-or father morning.

If he were not allowed to take what he considered the proper course, he was quite content to remain outside Mr SPEAKER said that he would leave the chair, in order to allow hon members to obtain some refreshment, and non members might then consider the matter. The House, shortly after 8 a m , adjourned for breakfast The House resumed at 10.30 a in Mr SPEAKER said he was asked the question whether upon the motion before the House the hon. member for St. i Leonards could be heard I Sir HENRY PARKES (speaking from the bar of the House, said he had been slightly misunderstood What he desired was that he should be heard before the question was put to the House Mr SPEAKER said he was about to explain that undoubtedly the hon. member could come in and make a statement before the question was put The hon. member I was responsible for the question, and if he chose to make another statement he could conceive one reasonable objection to his doing so. The question was that the words were disorderly, and ought to be apologised for and withdrawn Mr GARRETT (who had left the House at 11 o'clock on the preceding evening said he was only partially aware of the course that was proposed to be taken by the leader of the Government there could be no doubt that if the majority of the House declared these words, or any other words, disorderly, they could be so declared, but he would leave it to the common sense of members opposite whether it was not straining the i sales of Parliamentary procedure to an unusual degree to declare such words disorderly in view of the circumstances under which they were used He (Mr Garrett) was not going to argue this matter in a contentious spirit, but he submitted that the words could not be taken exception to man assembly such as this He know that he had used, if not exactly the some words, words convey rag a similar meaning himself. He and other hon. members had said that the Government of the country was carried on by by into force, and he could appeal to facts to support the statement He was quite aware that one wrong did not justify another, but he submitted that the words were perfectly excusable He appealed to the hon gentlemen opposite to leave the matter where it stood The hon member for St Leonards used the words as rightly describing the tactics of the Government Mr WANT said the hon member who had just addressed the House laboured under the disadvantage of not having been present during the time the words to which objection has been taken were used It was not the mere question of using the word brutal, which was most off arrive in itself, but of the hon. member for St Leonards having endeavoured to explain the matter by delivering a speech more offensive than the vy words themselves He would ask hon. members whether, if these words had been used outside the House, they were not likely to provoke a quarrel? Surely), if that was likely to follow the use of them outside, hon members ought to be far more cautious about the use of them here than if they were used in any other place For the information of gentlemen who were not present during the debate, the hon. member described the circumstances under which the words were used and what followed afterwards, and concluded by urging the member for St Leonards to withdraw the offensive a words after the expressions of opinion that had been given regarding them by the Chairman of Committees, the Speaker, and the House itself in the case of Mr. Av'isdoni Mr ABIGAIL characterised the conduct of the leader of the Government in rising at 10 o'clock to make a statement of a very important character, describing the financial position of the Government and showing a deficit of 2,000,00, and speaking until midnight, when he might have said all he had to say in 30 minutes, as fully justifying the terms that had been used YA then asked by the hon. member for St Leonards how far he proposed to proceed with the additional Estimates, he could get no satisfactory reply. Sir P4.1 RICK JENNINGS said he was about to explain when the hon. member made the speech in which he used the objectionable phrase, that all the Government intended to do was to take the first item on the estimate Mr ABIGAIL contended that there was ample oppor- unit) for the leader of the Government making such an explanation, if he had been desirous of doing so Mr ABBOTT, at considerable length, urged that the hon member for St Leonards should withdraw the words which had been complained of to say the least of it, the hour and highly respected politician should say a better example honor of members of the House No Mimstnos ever since the establishment of responsible government had been treated with more contempt, disregard, and obstruction than had those in power subsequent to the date of the hon. member being displaced from office He maintained that it was only reasonable that the Government should seek to push on with the country's business more especially in view of the continued obstruction which had been carried out Mr O'CONNOR admitted, with sorrow, that the Parliament was losing its power, prestige, and dignity outside of the House very rapidly He characterised the whole affair as an attempt to make much ado about nothing. The words '. brutal Ministry" had been used and tolerated times without number in the Imperial Parliament Mr G A LLOYD, for the information of those now in the House who were not present when the circumstances leading up to the present position of affairs took place, gave a resume of them. He pointed out that compelling the House to go on with business at or d o'clock of the morning, was unreasonable, and if it were out of order to refer to the Government's brutal, it surely was not out of older to characterise the conduct of the Government that morning as brutal " The whole trouble was traceable to the Colonial Secretary. Sir PATRICK JENNINGS said that the notion in moving that the words be taken down was his, and he had taken that action as leader of the House, and distinctly denied that the Colonial Secretary had anything to do with the matter He was willing to take the whole responsibility r Mr G A LLOYD contended that if the Colonial Secretary were not responsible, at least he was urging the Premier to adhere to his resolution Mr S STEPHEN said that he understood the Government were willing to adjourn the debate after the first item of the Estimates had been passed it was quite evident that a debate prolonged beyond reasonably hours led to a feeling of irritation among mom- boT, and led perhaps to language being used that was to be regretted Certainly, in the present case, he thought the words which had been used, if accepted in their natural, ordinary sense, wore unparliamentary, but Sir Henry Parkes he understood, had explained that he had not used these words in their ordinary offensive sense and that being so, he thought the motion might well have been withdrawn It had, he believed, been ruled by the Speaker that words which in their ordinary senses would be unparliamentary) might not be so is used in some other than their ordinary sense If there was any question of facts in this case, that might surely easily be settled to Kfeíto13118 The Chairman of Committees is the person Mr GARRETT Refer to Jlaniatd centre STEPHEN thought the House might very well accept Sir Henry Parkes' assurance that head acts these words in their ordinary offensive moaning?

He had no desire to humiliate any man W li it he said was this That (he should approach the. question without a thought of pin to considerations He described how the scene had entered and said that he thought Sir Henry Parkes was too old a politician and too thoroughly acquainted as all the rules of debate, to say in his calmer moments any thing which would be objected to It was here also he (Mr Fletcher) thought that the whole House would be satisfied with M hint Sir Henry Parkes would say before the resolution or amendment was put that he made this suggestion He did not expect the hon. member to make an object of clogs or indeed any apology of any kind No one would say that he had uttered one word to the effect But be asked the hon member to say any Huns which would be derogatory to the greatest man in the colony His de ire was that there should not be a record of this matter in the affairs of the House and he believed that of Sir Henry Parkes were to be permitted to enter the chamber his sense of what was due to the House would enable him to say sufficient to Batrsfi hon. members Mr SPEAKER said, with regard to the question raised by the Minister for M wits, as to whether the rules of the House would pel But the hon. member for St Leonards to enter the chamber and make a further stn extent than he hudnlreadi made Hint if any bon in tuber desired to add any thing to was that he had already stiteilboforenrosolutionof this kind were put to the House, he would certainly be entitled to the support of the cb m in doing so Sir HENRY P VRKES, advancing to the bar of the House, sued, ""W whilst 1 begin this consumption of time on my account, and with a desire to have the proceedings closed as soon as possible I can accept nothing as a favour, or any thing which will be a departure from the common, ordinary course by which other members may be treated " Air SPE AKT R said that he did not intend to convey the impression that any addition which the hon member might wish to make to what he had the idea said would be a departure from P irliameut ary rule because soldiered that in any Parliament in the world such a course as he had stated would be the proper one to follow He believed that any Assembly in the w o Id would regard it as a right of an him member under such circumstances to add am - thing he is said to what he had already stated Mr CARRÍ II find that Sir Henry Parkes hndnlrendj done what it was no we traffic should be done The hon. member's words had a right to be taken and he had no idea his explanation J here were two doors for the Governor Lieut now to relieve the rosettes of the dilemma in which they were If this are tion were carried there must be same other action taken which would degrade Sir Henry Pin lets pel orally and in the hope of borne poisons mine line politically (Oppcsiti m she is) But how would it injure him go far ally in He min N of the people P Would it not rather it habilitate him, and in like him what it had been seen in di examined factor in the politics of the country P (Opposition cheers ) Mr. W AN T saul (1 at he had received the exact words uttered by Sir Henry Parkes from Jamaica If directly the hon. member for St I boards had been called to order, he had stated that he did not use the words in an offensive sense no one could then have complained of the explana- tion given, but hon. members would see that it was only after he had been called upon repeatedly to withdraw the words that he made the amemU honorably He then quoted the report of the proceedings is given by the Raiisani stiff The hon. member for St I cowards did not offer any explanation until he had been (twice called upon to withdraw his remarks The hen gentleman might have made his explanan n when first called upon to withdraw the remarks but he did not chose to do of It was after the hon. member had used the words, brutal majority and brutal Ministry," that he was called upon to withdraw his remarks At this stage an adjournment took place for lunch The House resumed at a quarter to 3 o'clock Mr S SMI 111 sill he was sure hon. members were anxious that the discussion should be brought to an end He was not present when the question of order arose, as he went home believe me that tire Gi merriment would not attempt to proceed with important matters at a into hour in the morning The hon member for St Leonards m refers.?

The question was not whether the words were an offence against the Government, but whether they were an offence against the House The hon. member for St Leonards had had two or three opportunities for withdrawing the words, and he had declined to withdraw them. The hon. member for Camden had asked what would happen if the resolution before the House were earned The result would be that the House having decided by carrying the resolution that the words were disorderly and should be withdrawn, the hon. member for St Leonards would hay eau opportunity for withdrawing them and apologising for having used them Then, if he did not withdraw the language and apologise, he would, as a natural sequence to the resolution earned, be held guilty of contempt, and a resolution similar to that earned in the case of Mr Wisdom would bay of to be moved Mr NEILD And the stone you set rolling will crush you Mr DIBBS If the hon. member believes what he now says he will only be too delighted at the crushing operations Mr NEILD Hear, hear Mr DIBBS said that if the House through its tender were unable to maintain its dignity, there was an end to all Piirlinmentiir) government (Hear, hear ) Even the withdrawal of the words would be sufficent the part of the an mail for St Leonards, without the necessity for his making an apology If he came forward and withdrew the words it would be sufficient Mr INGLIS considered that Sir Henry Parkes would be wanting in self-respect if he withdrew the words the explanation he had given was one that should be accepted by his opponents if they possessed (the slightest tincture of generosity An important financial statement had been made at his home last night, and if hon members and acted in accordance with their lights two or three days' delay before debating that statement would have been asked instead of the business being burned forward Mr J. H YOUNG said that much stronger language than that used by the member for St Leonards had been home in the House, and hon. members opposite ought to be satisfied with the explanation which had been made and not ask for a withdrawal of the words It seemed as if the Government wished to distinguish the closing scenes of the session by doing something extraordinary, and to do guide the hon member for St Leonards by putting him in a Iahe position below o (ho country If the resolution were carried, and the House went on to pass another motion such as the Colonial Secretary foreshadowed, all he could say was that, if members were not allowed to express their opinions in the House the opinion of an efficent people outside would be that there was no other way to decorate the-- action of the Government than by the very words taken exception to in the case of the hon. member for St Leonine bl into force and nothing else Persons musido would then call it a brutal Government and brutal majority Mr DIBBS But they must not say it inside the House (Ob') Mr GARRETT The) want to degrade him Mr J H YOUNG Exactly hon. members opposed to him seemed to want to degrade the hon. member for St Leonards But he was the wrong sort of man for them to degrade The sto id too high in the opinion of the country for men like they were to degrade him (Opposition cheers) He put aside altogether the servicess the bin member, and said that this action of the Government would fail in its object and would recoil on those who were endeavouring to degrade the hon. member Mr THOMPSON produced a dictionary from which he quoted the various synonyms given for "brutal" and ' brutish" Ihi so was, he said, not a single interpretation of these words which could be applied to any hon. member in the House or Ministry luoordiuaiy use of the word was such as would be applied to a man who bent his wifo"-(laughter)-or to such rascals as those who recently committed a terrible outrage If the conduct of the Go- I vernmetit could be described as brutal then it was "in- human" and " savage " In conclusion, he urged upon Sir Henry Parkes the advisableness of withdrawing the words he was sure if any thing like a fur opportune) were afforded them the Government would only be too glad to withdraw the motion Mr GARRETT said though not authorised to make the statement, he had good reason to believe that if the motion and amendment were withdrawn such a statement would be made by the hon. member for St Leonards as would perfectly satisfy both sides of the House Sir PATRICK 11 NNINGS said that until the words wire w withdraw n, of course the motion could not bow has- drawn Mr ARIO YIL said that the action of the Government would make it appear as though they were endeavouring to try and place an interpretation upon the words of Sir H. inn Parkes which he did not intend them to bear No doubt if the Government pressed the matter they would obtain a victory, but it would be a very sorry one Mr REID after referring to the damaging effect it would have upon the character of the House if the Cove ment persisted in the course it proposed to take, said that epithets of a violent character had throughout the session There used by hon. members, not only on one side of the House but on both sides (bent, hem) but it struck him with something like surprise that they were getting to suddenly) squeamish with refo lines to the expression made use of by the hem number for St Leonards, which, however, he did not attempt to justify but it was intimate]) milder than thousands of expressions hurled from all parts of the Chamber within the past six months without the slightest notice having been taken of them The expression was, no doubt, a most offensive one, and he would not attempt to justify it, but a subsequent explanation of these wearers was given in such a way that to his mind it was quite unnecessary to take the extreme course which the Premier had denied it his duty to take He did not wish in any way to reflect upon the action the Premier had taken in this matter, for he felt that he had always shown the greatest courtesy and consideration to the House (hear, hear)-and he honestly gave him credit for the gie nest patience and consideration in his management of the House But even his 1,1 cutest friends would admit I that ocasionally, though generally courteous, he put his foot down at the wrong., time. He thought that with the explanation which the hon. member for St Leonards had given the Premier should not have taken the course had He was sure his intention was vindicate the dignity of the House, but in face of the many expres- ions which had been passed over, the course adopted by the Premier might be construed into taking,, a course with regard to the leader of the Opposition which would not have been taken with reference to any other member If there was a member in the House with remind to whom the Government should be slow to take a course which would have the effect of removing him from his place at the top of the Opposition benches, it was the hon number for St Leonards, the leader of the Opposition It was of very great importance that the leader of the Opposition should always be in his place to such a one placed in that position every point of courtesy should be str lined, and it would have been well if some one else had been so lee ted rather than the hon. member at the headache Of position benches to make an example of Although having himself seriously attacked the hon. gentleman in the course of the public life of the colony, he hoped, yy bat- ever his opinion of the hon. gentleman might be it would not blind him to that gentleman's chums as an old and able public man upon the colony He thought it would be well if the Ministry) showed itself slow to resent such attacks The fact was that the words applied to the Ministry put (the members of it in a dilute position, because they were fully to some extent fighting their own battle the words complained of were an attack upon the Ministry, and if there were, a case in which I attitude should be given it ought to be when the leader of the Opposition was criticising the Minister in this case he thought the leader of the Government had put his foot down in the wrong place and on the wingman As to the dignity of the house, he thought the last thing hon members could do would be to stand upon their dignity (Laughter ) He did not know upon what they could Stand if they attempted it (Lau 'liter ) the dignity of the House and it was no subject for merriment, appeared during the present session to have completely disappeared Mr SPL YEt R said that he was there to uphold the dignity of the House, and on) imputation that the House was without disgust) ought not to be made by) an) hon. member Mr REID bowed to the decision of the Speaker There vi ere cent turn subjects upon which one had no right to express an opinion, and this was one of them. He had l mitted that the words he had used were wrong under the circumstances They would have been perfectly) in order, he supposed, outside of that House, but he admitted that they were out of order in the House. He might however, say that perhaps the House had not lost its dignity , but he thought they should try to prevent the House from incurring a more severe fate than that of loss of dignity, and that was the n pro test of acting in an iiuncecsRiiiily and conspicuously him so manner towards one of the oldest public man of the country in the midst of all the injuries which their enemies inflicted upon them they should try to treat them IIB generously and as com teams) as they could Unit was all he asked the hon number at the head of the Treasury) benches to do with the hon member for St Leonards on the present occasion He was willing to admit that the hon gentleman had often received yon) great provocation, and he know that the last thing"' the hon. member could be accused of was a disposition to act harshly or ungenerously with any member or the House. It was now 4 o'clock The whole matter had been fairly discussed, and he would ask the hon. member at the head of the Government, in view of the assurance given by the hon. member for Camden, to by withdraw the motion The Opposition could never hope to achieve a greater victory than that which would be gained at the hon. gentleman by any act of his expelled the hon member for St Leonards If the hon. member for St Leonards had done everything that was wrong the hon. member for 'the Bogan would, by this action of his, simply be setting him upon a pedestal of dignity before the country.

Mr. SPEAKER announced the receipt, of a Message from the Legislative Council, forwarding the Grape Vine Diseases Bill, with amendments. Sir PATRICK JENNINGS moved that the House agree with the Legislative Council's amendments in the bill. The mot ion was agreed to. COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY. Sir PATRICK JENNINGS moved that the House again resolve itself into Committee of Supply to consider the additional estimates. Mr. GARRETT asked (the Speaker if this were the same sitting as that which had been opened on Wednesday afternoon. Mr. SPEAKER said undoubtedly it was the same sitting. This had been determined by a ruling formerly given, which was now an order of the House. Mr. ABIGAIL hoped the Premier did not intend to proceed with the consideration of the estimates at such a time. Mr. ABBOTT thought it was the intention of the Government only to go into committee formally. The motion was agreed to, and the House then resolved itself into Committee of Supply. The first item was Executive and Legislative, £1216 6s. 4d. Sir PATRICK JENNINGS said that it had been already stated by his hon. friend that it was simply the intention of the Government to have proceeded with the additional estimates as far as the first item, but a certain occurrence took place which prevented them so doing. He thought that trailer the circumstances of the long sitting of the House hon. members would not feel inclined to proceed further. He would not therefore tax the patience of the House by proposing to go on with the estimates. He therefore moved that the Chairman leave the chair and report progress. The motion was agreed to. the Chairman left the chair, reported progress, and asked leave to sit again. The House at four minutes to 5 o'clock p.m., adjourned till 2! o'clock on Friday.
