QUEENSLAND PARLIAMENT. In the Council on the 23rd : — A petition was received from Maryborough, praying that facilities might be granted for the introduction of Coolie labourers as sanctioned by law in the Mauritius. A vote passed on the previous Wednesday, by which the Audit Bill had been thrown out, was rescinded, and the Bill was restored to the paper. The Benevolent Wards in Hospitals Bill was read a first time. Mr. Fitz moved a series of resolutions, again ad- verting upon the conduct of the Judge, among them was the following : — (6.) That this house, in agreeing to the foregoing resolutions, cannot refrain from strongly deprecating the course pur- sued by Mr. Justice Lutwyche in receiving ad- dresses adopted at various public meetings, in- tended as a censure upon the Executive govern- ment and both Houses of Parliament, thereby assuming a political partizanship, calculated to destroy all confidence in the administration of justice in this colony, and seriously to impair the sacred functions devolving upon the head of our Judicial Department. After some opposition, they were withdrawn until after the Supreme Court Bill should have been passed. The second reading of the Municipalities' Bill was passed, and in Committee upon it, the clause against plumping was expunged. The Fencing Bill was passed. On the 23rd:— A resolution was passed, pointing out to the Assembly the necessity for the appointment of a responsible minister to conduct the business of the government in the Council. The Audit Bill was passed. In Committee on the Supreme Court Bill, the President and others were strongly of opinion that the Judge ought not to hold two commis- sions. If his Honor accepted that of Queensland, he was bound to resign the other. In the Assembly on the 23rd : — A petition for a wharf at Maryborough was received. The Colonial Secretary intimated that it had been represented to him that at the time the wharf was put up for lease, it was knocked down far £5 per annum for five years, in consequence of a combination among the mer- chants not to bid higher, so that they might have importations free of wharf dues. A petition from Maryborough in favour of Coolie labour, and a petition from Brisbane in favour of the Tramway Bill, were received. The Benevolent Asylum Wards' Bill was passed. The Appropriation Bill was read a first time. The Government Loan Bill was passed. On the 24th :— A petition was received advocating the incor- poration of a Queensland Steam Navigation Com- pany. Warry asked the Colonial Secretary — whether it is his intention in this or tlie next session of Parliament, to introduce a Bill for the purpose of making illegal, printed pieces of paper called calabushes, which at present cause great inconvenience to the public, and particularly to the poor.' Tlie Colonial Secretary replied tliat the mat- er referred to nhould receive tlie careful con i-ideration\f the Government during the reee*s.'.

Though it was not stated in the report, he believed that great blame was attributable to the commandant for many of the proceedings of the last twelve or eighteen mouths, during six of which he had been entirely absent from duty. Another thing to which he felt it his duly to refer was the con- duct of the Secretary of the native police force, who was also a storekeeper. The statements made by him as to his own conduct were quite suffi- cient to justify him (Mr. Watts) in making severe comments when an increase was proposed to that gentleman's salary. In answer to questions 66 to 69 on the 141st page, Mr, McDonnell, after acknowledging that six months had been allowed to elapse without the customary supplies being dispatched, stated that he had not written to but spoken to Mr. Manning on the subject. Con sidering the position which he occupied, he (Mr. Watts) thought that Mr McDonnell should have written to the Under-Secretary and not have rested contented with merely speaking to him. His evidence also with respect to the supply of ammunition displayed such gross negilgence in he discharge of his duties that he trusted the Government would administer so severe a repre mand as would prevent their recurrence, if not to dismiss him altogether. He wished to draw attention to the fact that at the present time a meeting of various tribes was being held in the neighbourhood of Ipswich, whose sole object wan that of fighting, and of whom many were dying daily. Strange it was that no steps should have been taken by the philanthropic advocates of the aborigines to put a stop to the proceedings now taking place within five miles of Ipswich. He was himself convinced that far greater numbers of these people died from the effects of grog- drinking and attacks from their own race, than from the attacks of native police. Hundreds no doubt had been murdered in cold blood by giving them arsenic and strychnine in the food ; and, although the statement was denied, he still asserted it. The hon. gentleman then read the plan suggested by Mr. Zellman, as given in the following extract from his evidence : — "39. A suggestion had been thrown out that a num ber of these blacks should be collected and taken away to some island. Do you think such a thing could be done ?— No, it is too illiberal a plan altogether. I think some liberal scheme should be adopted—some system of feeding and clothing the blacks, and making them work. Educating the children would, I think, be the means of raising them from their present degraded state. "40 Suppose the blacks would not work ?— Then they would not be fed. "41. Then you would make a selection of those to be fed and clothed ?— Yes ; those who cboss to work. "42. And teach their children ?— Yes ; in my opinion that is the only liberal plan. I don't think exporting them would answer at all. If I had the means, say £10 000 to start such an establishment — and if cotton can be grown with profit in this climate, which I believe it can—I would make it self-supporting in the course of five years. "43. Then you think a sort of model industrial farm for cotton-growing, assisted partly by the Government, and under the management of the mission, or of a company, would be a good experiment ?— Yes; I think a company would answer the best." He thought this scheme more feasible than any that had yet been suggested. Its expense would not be great, and as perhaps great results might arise from it, it was their duty to do what good they could for this benighted race. He sincerely trusted that this recommendation would be carried out, and that the House would adopt the report made by the committee. Mr. COXEN would not detain the House long in the remarks he was about to make. The re port showed, and the evidence warranted no other conclusion, that there was a great want of confidence in the efficiency of the present officers of the force, and also that the force was not properly officered. With respect to tbe fourth recommendation — that monthly returns of all proceedings, and the state of the troopers should be forwarded by each officer in command of a detachment to the commandant of the force, who would furnish a general abstract thereof to the Colonial Secretary, or the head of the Exe cutive department under which he may be placed —I would suggest that these returns should be made in the form of a diary, as one great complaint against the officers was that weeks or months were frequently spent by them at the [page torn] mere idleness. By this [page torn] [page torn] ould also be kept against [page torn] [page torn] event of any charges [page torn] against them, there would become means of establishing the truth or [page torn]. A great deal has been [page torn] dity of catching blacks in the [page torn] admitted the existence of this diffi- cult, both on the part of white men and blacks, [page torn] never knew an instance in which the native police had caught blacks in scrubs or elsewhere, and brought them to justice. He thought that some check should be placed upon the proceed ings of the officers, and that a commissioner or inspector should be placed over them to keep a vigilant watch upon their conduct, as he was quite sure that a great deal of slaughter was committed upon innocent parties. He believed that some force was desirable, not only for the protection of the white settlers, but also for the blacks themselves. He (Mr. Coxen) did not agree with the proposition for the establishment of a missionary cotton company, because he was certain that it would prove a failure. The same thing had been tried in other places, and had proved an entire failure. It was im possible to educate the black children so long as they were allowed to associate with their parents or others of their tribe, in consequence of their superstitions and certain religious obser vances, of which they could not be divested, if allowed to associate with them. He flatly de nied the statement made by some witnesses that I the aborigines had a sense of a future state. In his younger days he took a great interest in the blacks on the Hunter and the Namoi, and learned from them that they had an indefinite idea of a future state, somewhat similar to the idea of hunting grounds believed in by the American Indians, and had given him accounts of what they believed respecting them. It was also said that an impression existed among them that when a blackfellow died, he would jump up white man ; but that such was not their belief he would shew in a few words. Long before the white man was seen by the blacks, they had the and wonda, or devil-devil, by which they un- derstood a ghost ; and he could easily under stand that on their seeing the first white man they imagined him to be the ghost of a departed black. It was doubtless from this circumstance, [page torn] the impression of the blacks' belief in this [page torn] originated. Mr. Watts had alluded to [page torn] murders on Captain Dumaresq's station on the Macintyre ; but before these Captain Duma- resq [page torn] a character for severity, and that per [page torn]servedly, for the murder of blacks in [page torn]England. He had lived many years among [page torn] on the frontiers, and had never had [page torn] speak an angry word to them. Be [page torn]ding he wished to allude to the [page torn]al witness having refused to give [page torn] also to a letter appearing in that morning's Courier, in which allusion was indi- rectly made to himself. The only reason why he had not given evidence was that he was not asked. He fully expected to be summoned, and would willingly have done so. Mr Gore regretted exceedingly that Mr. Coxen had not been called by the committee. That gentle- man had never occurred to him, or he would certainly have called him to be summoned.

The present etute of the^ountry was far better than it waa yo«ra ago. Twenty yean aiuoe be remembered that when riding to Briiliuun he dared not come tioept well armed.

They should never alter a state of things, until they could find a more effective substi tution. Dr. Challinor moved that the report be read that day [faded text]. The [faded text] fell to the ground for want of se- conder. Mr Fitzsimmons had hoped that the hon. gentleman who had last spoken would have made some recom- mendation wither for the better management of the native police, or for doing away with them. If he had considered that Mr. [page torn] or Lieutenant Wheeler had been guilty of [page torn] in a murder, why did not the hon. [page torn] his warrant for their appre hension [page torn] considered that the hon. gentle man [page torn] in favor of the native [page torn] that several cases had come [page torn] outrages by [page torn] offered no recommendation as to [page torn] were to be dealt with. He also distinctly statad that he had never been more than sixty miles beyond Ipswich. Truly, like Sam Weller, "his views are limited." In the case of a black who had been ill-treated, he said he had gone 19 miles to enquire, and had ascertained that he had been driven off his fishing ground, the Molly Molly ; but it appeared be had got his information from a demented shepherd. On such strong testimony, he came forward and asked them not to do away with the native police. Of course they all objected to an indiscriminate slaughter by the native police. He also thought they must agree with the recommendation of Mr Lowe and Captain O'Con nell, that the native police should never be stationed permanently in the neighbourhood of large towns. Mr. Macalister moved the adjournment of the debate till next day. The lengthy debate on the above report (which, we quote from the Courier), extended over the next day's proceedings. We will give a summary of the residue in nest issue.
