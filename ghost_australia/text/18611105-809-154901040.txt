PROFESSIONAL CRICKETERS. TO THE EDITOB. OF THE AGP.. Sir, — On perusing your paper of Wednesday last, I, was much pleased to see a letter signed 'A Colt,' referring to professional cricketers. I most cordially endorse his opinion, and I think if pro fessionals playing in club matches was made the exception and not the rule, we should have better cricketers, as then every player, both young and old would strive to take the place of their teachers. At present if a match is arranged with the Richmond or Melbourne clubs, excluding pro fessionals, it is looked upon as a second eleven match. Professional players in my opinion ought to be excluded from playing in challenge cup matches, in particular, because they cannot be considered bona fide members of the club, and only the Melbourne and Richmond clubs can in dulge in the luxury of paying their players. If professionals were excluded from cup matches, nearly all the suburban clubs would have a ' go in' at it, who have not a 'ghost of a chance' with paid men playing. I do not in any way wish to hurt the feelings of the profession, for I highly esteem them in their proper place, namely, on the practise ground and in the Victorian eleven where they are invaluable. — YourB truly, ? AMATEUR. The Government Reservoirs. — Government are at last taking steps to turn at least one of the Fryer's Creek Reservoirs to account. Pipes will be verysoon laid down from the Crocodile Reservoir, with the view of rendering its contents available for the inhabitants of Fryerstown. Arrange ments are also to be made for making the water subservient for mining purposes. Should the supply be at all adequate to the demand of the people of the township, the money spent on these works in this district, will not hare been entirely wasted. — M. A. Mail, 4th November.
