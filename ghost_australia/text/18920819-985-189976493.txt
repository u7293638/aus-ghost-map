German Wines. On the t Rhine or on its tributary riven, between Coblenz and Mayence, all the most celebrated wines of Germany are grown. The grape preferred for cultivation in this region is .the Riesling, a small white, harsh species. The reputed characteristics of German wines are generosity, dryness, fine flavour, < and endurance of age. | It is averred that even the strongest are never saturated with brandy. j The whole eastern bank of tbe Sbioe to Lorich—a traot called the Rheingaa, about fourteen miles in extent—has been■ famous for its wines for ages. ] Here is Schloss Johanuisberger, once 1 nearly destroyed by Gen. Hoche. To Steinberger is assigned the next rank. Gafehberg is thought to produce wine equal to Rudesheimer, which is a wine of the first Rhine growths. | Marcobrunner, Roth, and Kooisbach are highly esteemed, bat Cachacach has lost its former celebrity. We have thus far spoken only of the white wines of the Rhine country ; its red wines are deemed inferior. Red jSamanuehanaer is prouounoed the best. The most celebrated of the Moselle wines is the Brauneberger, of which there are numerous varieties. One of these, known as Gruerihauser, used to be styled the nectar of the Mo selle. In Whrtzberg is grown Steinwein, pro duced on a mountain so called j and named by tbe hospital to which it belongs, Wine of the Holy Ghost-— -New York Scn.
