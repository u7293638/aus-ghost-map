Thk unemIdiij'ea qiiesSw b 'iilie which demands ^^M WViairli-ration. That such* problem should urisc in densely peopled centres is not surprising under existing conditions ; but in these young communities, when there are thousands of men vainly seeking lor work in the cities, whilst tens of thorsMite of acres of land await MtHette^t Snows that there 5B Bot&ptMng; wanting in existing conditions, For instance, thc entire population of Australia is only a little over three millions, scattered at irregular and very unequal interrnls over a vast continent containing 8, 1G 1,157 sqnare miles, and Tasmania, with an area of 2G,L-I5 sqnare miles, *t&k;& about 150,000 peopled he p'orVulition of a small town in «M countries. To bring the subject fairly into .the lens of com parison, it is only .necessary *o point ont that Scotland — by no means a densely peopled country — contains 29,820 square acres, and carries a population of 4,083,103— nearly 27 times that of Tasmania. If we take thc upwards of 44,800 jjcople residing in the cities of Uol)»ft And tauhc^ston, there remain Only 107,006 rtSdi'ng in the remainder of the coldny. Of the entire population only 21,536 males are en gaged in agricultural pursuits, and we regret being compelled to admit that Tasmania does not nearly supply the local food market for our own people. Some months ago we pointed out that the abnormal borrowing of money for public works was, to a great extent, responsible for the unsatlsEaetofy condi tion of the working classes in !f atmania, nnd this is daily becoming more appurent For the year 18!) 1-2 the entire value of our agricultural produce was £l,2;)8,307, and our pastoral produce, including dairvingstock, wool, etc., was £1 ,371 ,G40, making a total of £2,«2y,'J47 ; whilst since 1880 we have borrowed, including the loan now awaiting flotation, for pub lic works construction nearly £4,000,000. The effect of this has been a totally abnormal dependence on the wage's system, creating an unnatural condition of life, which could not possibly last. Hundreds of our very best class of workers, sons of the pioneer farmers, were enticed from agricultural pursuits by the rates of wages obtainable on public works, thc result being that when these works ceased they were thrown out of work, and drifted into the cities and country towns to swell the list of unem ployed. Here, as elsewhere, it is the common cry that Die best of the land is held by monopolists. Admittedly there are fine estates, especially in the Mid lands and further South, which arc now sheeprmis. employing very few men, that would, if broken up into small holdings, afford splendid homes for scores of fanners : but there is also another side to the picture. A few years ngo the Oriental estate, near Sorell, one of the finest estates in the South, was offered for .sale in medium-sized farms, but pur chasers not being found, it was converted into n huge shoeprnn. Quite recently Mr .1. Clark offered to cut up the famous Lawrcuny estate — perhaps lite best rstaie in the colony — into farms, the maximum area being 100 nores, which be would lease or sell : but the offer was not accepted, and now he bus secured legislative enactment to con struct a railway from lie iena'mus o! the Dei- went Rnilway to the Oubo pre paratory to renewing his offer to con vert his existing sheep runs into home steads. Tlie question that arises is — Docs there really exist a desire to 6ettle on the land ? We believe that, under a proper system, such desire, if it does not at present exist to any ffrent extent, co'ild be very speedily and easily created. It is not true that the whole of thc good laud in Tasmania has been purchased. in ins recently issued report the Deputy Surveyor-General reports the discover? of 12,000 acres first-class, and (i000 acres second-clas.-, .-agricultural land in the Florentine Valley which jiosscsses every requirement for a fair test of (he Homestead Settlement system.

We would urge upou the Government the necessity of seriously considering tin- land ques tion, which we recognise us the only solution *;f (lie itneinplmdl problem. Them is room for tons of thousands of small fanners throughout Tasmania ? men who will Pottle on the land, pur chasing it on easy terms, and in a few years of admittedly Iiurd work winning a i-omfortabli- home for themselves and families from the forest. Mr \V. Lune, the founder of the New Australia (Ar ffftntinn'l scheme, has undoubtedly sbnet the kt-yuote when he lays the basis of his settlement on thc sound foundation of tin- p«-ple providing for thi-ir own re quirements. Burn's Scotch lassie, when suiting that they had little to sell, and less io buy, unfolded u secret mighty in power fur good if applied to these young countries. As we have already pointed out, our unem ployed do not want charity— they want work : and as it is impossible for Ihc (government to borrow at present for the construction of public works, we would commend to the serious consideration of the Cabinet the desirability of teBting the Homestead Settlement system. No great brain power, and very little expenditure, is required for such a trial being made in a practical manner, and a successful sun would remove the unemployed affording work aMSSras.«j,wii» a home' fot the workers and 'fliSfjEainilifeB— ana;' by converting unjiroSocfivo forest info thriving homesteads, would i-normouslv increase.thelfafio'nalwaiiii^yVe-Sttte.1 KvAKomaBTB: 'r.fiBBVioiffli*«-i-Mf -et?

BtBEET Accident.— At a'wut c o'clock yesterday evening an accident occurred in BaUour-street, resulting in considerable damage to a phaeton and serious injury lo tne pony that was drawing it. Thc ponv, which belongs to Colonel Whitelaw, of Wellington-road, was being driven down Balfour-street by the groom, and when neat io Wellington-street the pin of one of the shafts came out. The Bhaft fell, and the pony became restive and capeitad the vehicle, which was almost demolished by thc animal plunging. The pony was seriously hurt in liis struggles, and but for Ui-s pres ence of mini displayed l»y the groom, who stuck to hitr, he would have sustained greater injuries. Several bystanders lent their assistance, and matters were righted as well as circumstances would permit. ACCIDENT TO ftm W. ij. MAB8H. — We regret to record that an accident hotel Mr W. B. Marsh yesterday morning, which will render him incapable of moving from bis bed for some time. Mr Marsh was engaged in taking a hook from a book-case in his house in Lyttelton-street, and, stepping off thc side of the box upon which he was standing, missed his footing and fell to the floor, his right leg being doubled under him. Dr. Pike, who was called in, at once ordered Mr Marsh to bed. Upon examination it was found that he had sustained a severe rick of thc knee, which has swollen to a great Bizc. Thc pain is very considerable, and the acci dent has rendered the sutferer quite help Bcckeve B-ndee Tbial. — We are in formed that a most successful trial o£ the Buckej-e ' Low Down ' and the Framelees machines was held yepterday at Westbury, on Mrs M. Lamb'n paddock, in a crop of oats intermixed with rye grSBS. Both machines did splendid work, handling this most diffi cult crop without a fault, their cutting power being exemplified most satisfactorily. horses, and the large gathering of farmers who witnessed the trial were unanimous in praises of the machines. The expertshonred with what ease these binders are handled, he being able to manipulate the machines in any position without leaving his seat. We are informed that several binders were dis posed of at thc close of thc trial. Thc exhi bition was conducted by Mr ,T. Stuart Grange, assisted by J. Downic as expert. Tbe Payne Family.— a change of pro gramme was presented by tbe Payne Famil * at the Academy of Music last night. There was a very good audience who testified their approval of thc manner in which the items were rendered by rounds of applause and frequent demands for encoree.
