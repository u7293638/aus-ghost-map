HOME TOPICS AND EVENTS. (FCO)! 0 UB COEnESPOXDENT.) LONDON, Nov. 29. The great Liberator trial ended yesterday, and wo havo heard tho last for a good many years of Mr Jabe7 Balfour and his doings After the excitement of the first day or two tho proceedings arouted little interest, for the evidence given was of too technical and complicated a character to bo readily followed by anj body not versed in all tho details of company-mongenng But the close of tho trail was awaited with intense interest, and when tho prisoners wero sentenced yesterday not onlv was tho court itself densely packed, but tho passages outside were thronged with an expectant crowd Tho demeanour of Balfour himself showed somo slight chango from the lmpassiveness which he has manifested throughout the trial He had evidently paid less attention to his toilet than usual His hair and beard wero less well groomed, and ho fidgeted about from tamo to time, addressing brief remarks i* a whisper to lus counsel He heard the Judgo's final observations with apparent apathy, but twice I saw the corners of his mouth twitch-onco when tho Judgo referred to bia misuse of splendid abilities, and onco wh»n the full sentence of 14 years' penal servitude was pronounced The two other prisoners got off very lightly, for it is evident that the Jndgo regarded them as the mero tools of tho greater criminal They both looked so haggnrd and dejected that it was almost possible to feel pity for them-espe- cially for Theobald, who was a man of unques- tionable respectability until Balfour drew him into his not, and who has been ruined in health and fortune as well as in reputation through iv eaknesd of charaotcr perhaps rather than dishonest inten- tion The wholo trial has mado it quite clear indeed thnt Balfour himself was the central figure and the master-mind in this gigantic scheme of fraud, and bis punishment has been exemplary A sentenco of 14 years' penal servitudo means over 10 j cars of actual servitude, even if he secures his ticket of leave by good conduct, and that is a largo slico out of what remains of life to a man of 62 Mr Morloy's approaching return to polnVal lifo is naturally ono of the great topics of tho da) When ho was defeated at î> en castle and all sorts of rumours bcamo currcut as to his probable retirement into literary seclusion, I ex- pressed a very strong doubt as to whether thissclf effacoment would bo moro than temporary I have heard too many distinguished politicians do claro themselves heartily tired of Parliament and all its surroundings to take these declarations too seriously Thov aro meaut at tho time, for nothing can bo moro w oaryinj, moro disheartening and1 moro disillusionising than thq ups and downs of political life, but tho effect of the rebuffs soon wears off, while the pleasure of the fray seems to havo an abiding attraction Mr Gladstone afforded on oxnmpio of this nt one period of his career, and Sir George Trovcl) an and a good man) other men hav o dono tho same The great point about Mr Morloy's return if he should succeed m gaming the seat for tho Montrose Burghs, which everybody regards as certain, is that wo shall once more seo in the Hou o of Commons tho great champion of what may bo called orthodox Home Rulo Of conrso all the Liberal lcadeis, Sir William Hacourt nmong them, oro acknowledged to bo Homo Riders, hut the suspicion is pretty general that in not a few coses they havo other objects moro olosely at heart, and that certain of them, at all ev cuts, would not be at all unwilling to depart prett) widely from the principles of Mr Gladstone's bill if they could in any way bring about u settlement But Mr Morley is Mr Glad- stone's heir m this matter He puts the Irish question first, and will admit no thought of sur render His expected return to Parliament has therefore greatlv elated the Irishmen and the ardent Homo Killers, while it has somewhat de- pressed n certain section of tho Liberal pa-ty w ho aro pining for a reconstructed programme, and who are afraid that the "doctrinaire" views of tho ex Chiof Secretary may stand m tho way Speakmg generally, however, his return will certainly bo welcomed by his party friends and opponents alike, for his character is beyond reproach, and he is a distinguished as well as an original figure in debate The deaths of M Alexandre Dumas and of M Barthelemy St Hilaire within a few days of each other havo deprived France of two of her most gifted sons Of Dumas's work I need say nothing, for his more popular plays have a world wido reputation even among people who never dipped into French literature or learnt tho French language I have heard a couple of London cabmen vivaciously discussing tho merits of the " Dame aux Camelias " That, of course, m this country is by far tha liest known of his works, chiefly because every great foreign actress who has visited London, to say nothing of some of the lights of our own stage, has made a point of appearing in tho character of Marguerite, and tho newspapers have discussed the play ad nauseam But most of Dumas's other dramas are almost as wellknown to cultivated theatregoers in London as in Paris, and a premiere of one of them of late years has always had the effect of attracting a good many English enthusiasts to tbo French capital along with English managers having nn oye to future adaptations Personally Dumas was a man who shrank from lionising and publicity He was in many respeets far removed from the idea which would be naturally formod of tho inventor of tho kind of play on which his fame was founded Correct, polished, amiable, and a little reserved, he never had even in his youth a trace of that rollicking Bohemianism which was so marked m tho free and easygoing nature of the elder Dumas, of whom, as everybody knows, he was the natural son Indeed, ho had »o great a dread of that indebtedness which was part of the normal atmosphere of the author of " Monte Cristo" that he earned a name among his associates when ho was a young man for parsimony, and ho has throughout so carefully husbanded tho money ho made by his plays that ho has died worth a largo fortuno It is curious too that while he was nover happy as a writer unless he was deal- ing with the crimes and follies which break np homes and render marriage a failure in the worst .case, he was himself thrice married-once to a I divorcee, it IA trna-and very fond of his two daughters Ho was a neighbour of Lord Salis- bury's, at Dioppe, untiltho Pnmo Minstorsold tho Chalet Cecil a short timo ago, and thoy wore well acquainted Thero aro good cntics who think that Dumas's death wdl bo followed by a healthy revolution in tho drama which holds tho French stage There is no doubt that ho was sincere in his way of treating tho subjects for which he had such a curious predilection It is equally certain that in the shadow of his great fame a lot of pestilent work has flourished Anyone who at the present time went the round of the Parns theatres would get a vívid idea of the extent to which lesser men have exaggerated and abused tho fashion which he set The other great Frenchman to whom I have referred filled a smaller space in tho public view than Dumas, but ho was a man of whom his countrymen had a less qualified reason to bo proud Scholar, statesman, and patriot ho has often been spoken of in lato j ears as the Ti euch Gladstone, and indeed tho two mon had many points in common besides their advanccd age The Tfrench statesman was over 90 when ho diod, but to the end ho kept up his love of classi- cal literature and his passion for vigorous outdoor exercise He was a tall old gentleman, ith an ascetic but benevolent face, and an impressive manner-a hard worker, who was rarely m bed after sunnse As a stntesm in ho w ill bo remem- bered chiefly as tho collaborator of Thiers, whoso memorj ho no\ cr ceased to re\ orence dunng tho stormy early times of tho Third Republic, and for the fact that later on as Toreign Minister ho secured Turns for Trance It haB been said of lum that in all the frothy controversies which havo marked French politics of lato years ho was tho only public man in Trance w ho never lost Ins head A gi cat burdon has been removed from the minds of the poorer class of cyclists by an an- nouncement made by tho Chancellor of the Ex- chequer Sir Michael Hicks Beach has not so far decided to tax cj cles, at nil c\ ents, for. his next jear's Budget The county councils and \catnes und other local bodies havo been working \ery hard in the matter in the hopo of finding a con- siderable source of revenue in the taxation of tho " machines " which swarm upon the public roads, and which promise noxt spring to outdo anything which has jet boen known m their numbers But the cyclists in this countiy aro very well or- ganised, and a Chancellor of the Lxehequer who cares for populantj is naturally afiaid, however great the temptation may be, of dipping his hand into a hornets' nest bj offending them I do not say that cj clists aro unanimous themselves upon tho subject, as some of them think that licen- sing and numbering will havo the effect of keep- ing an objectionable class of boy riders and ncketty and dangerous machines off tho roads But after all it is the poor mun who can afford no other means of con\ ej ance who arns his bicyclo to tho most praotieal u»e, and he would bo hard hit by any tax worth imposing The numbenng, which has been adopted very largely on the Con- tinent, is certainly only a matter of time, for acci- dents in the streets are becoming painfully fre- quent, in spito of the fact that by general ad- mission there has been a great improvement of late in tho matter of caro and courtes) on tho part of the ai erage nder No ono book of any special interest has been published this w eek, but the flood of Chnstmns literature continues unabated The most assiduous reader would find it hard w ork to dip into e\ en a tenth of it, but so far as my experience has gone I should say that thero is littlo falling off in variety or in interest, or ns far as the pictures go in artistic mont There maj bo a certain lack of originality, but this was to be expected Smce our Christmas story-telling began to attract so much talent on the part of the author and the illustrator -to say nothing of the printer and tho book- binder, who have turned out some admirable work this season-every mine of romance has been worked to the utmost, and it is not easy for the writer slaving in the dog days to provide amuse- ment for ourselves and our children when the snow is on tho ground to hit upon a new vein As far as I have seen there is a dearth of good ghost stories—and I confess to loving a good ghost story—but on the other hand there are plenty of fairy legends, and healthy tales of adventure, and so forth, which come as a welcome relief after tho deluge of sex problem novels and other unwholesome productions, of which we have had more than enough this autumn. At the theatres the most interesting vent of tho past few days has been tho long talked of reception to Mrs Keeloy on her ninetieth birthday The veteran actress-tho " grand old lady of tho English stage," as somo of her admirers havo dnbbed her -seemed in remarkably good health and tho best of possible spirts, and her reception was enthusi- astic in the extreme Her voice quite filled the theatre when, standing m front of tho stage, elad in a plain ruby velvet dress, she reminded the audience that it was oxactly 70 years since, as a " trembling nonce," sho had first appeared on the boards of tho Lyceum, which was then known as tho Opera-houso The Queen, although of course not present in person, had taken soveral seats for the performance, and there was a great crowd of distinguished people in the better parts of tho house The interest shown bv tho general public in the event may bo judged from tho fact that some enthusiasts sat outside the pit doors for hours on camp stools, on a raw November after- noon ^_
