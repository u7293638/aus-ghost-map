The above club will hold a special meeting at the Metropole Hotel to-morrow night, to consider a proposal that overtures should be made to M Porta, with a view of inducing the Italian champion to remain in the colony until October, in which month the club's race meeting will take place, ARRIVAL OF THE ITALIAN CHAMPION, M. PORTA. The Italian champion cyclist, M. Porta, who arrived in Australia about twelve months ago, and who has been racing in the eastern colonies with varying success during his sojourn, arrived in Perth on Monday morning overland from Albany, having come around by the mail steamer Orizaba from Adelaide. For! a was met on his arrival by Mr. J. Hamley, hon. sec. to the W.A. Cycling Club, other officers of that I club, and a large number of local wheelmen, j who greeted the champion with cheers as he stepped from the train. The visitor was escorted to the Criterion Hotel, where he will stay while in Perth, and where a WEST AUSTRALIAN representative interviewed him yesterday afternoon. As the champion's knowledge of English is somewhat limited, the interview was not of great length, but Porta was found a willing responder to all the leading questions put to him. After volunteering the information that he was bom in Milan, M. Porta replied to a query as to the length of time he had been racing-" Not quite two years ; say twenty-two months.' "How many races did you start in, and. with what success, in your native country?" asked our reporter of the champion; to which Ports replied, " I won 27 races, was second 15 times, and third 16 times. I won the 100 kilometre championship of | Italy, a distance of about 62 English miles, in 2 hours 44 minutes fair time, because it was raining, which caused delay." Then, warming to the enthusiasm of his prof c; sion, the Italian continued, " I met Mr. Martin, ! the American champion, on the Continent, and he persuaded me to come to Australia on a racing tour. Since I have been here I the Australian people generally, besides | the cyclist community, have been most kind to me, and I thank them. Every- where in these colonies the people have welcomed me, and I try to do my best at all the race meetings to show thanks. I am only just a little over 23 years of age, and have ridden against the world's champions during my short career. hide the "Electra" bicycle, and gear the machine to either 88 inches or 78 inches, according to the condition of the track on which I race. If it is a good track 1 ride with high gear. I have brought with me to Perth one bicycle and two wheels extra, but no triplet or tandem. machine. I like the passing of a tandem for scratch races, and will be pleased to be paced by one here. I shall do my best to win the races I start in here, and if I break any records I will be more pleased." With the remark that he intended going in for active train- ing at once riding on the track at the Association Cricket Ground every evening, the interview closed. During yesterday afternoon the officers of the W.A. Cycling Club took Porta for a drive around Perth, showing him the lions of the city, and shortly after 4.30 o'clock the champion took a trial spin on the track at the Association Ground, riding five miles at a fair pace behind the tandem ridden by James and Dahlberg. Though no racing form was displayed by either the tandem or the Italian, the bitter sprinted at the finish and beat the pacing machine COMPLIMENTARY SOCIAL TO PORTA An impromptu social, arranged as a formal welcome to Porta was tendered the visiting Italian champion by the members of the W.A. Cycling Club on Monday evening, at the Criterion Hotel. Mr. S. H. Parker, M.L.C., president of the club, occupied the chair, and a large number of members were present. Mr: Parker, in a complimentary, withal witty, speech, proposed the health of the ghost of the evening, M. Porto. The chairman remarked upon the cosmopolitan character of the club he had the honour to be president of, observing that it embraced all nationalities, yet it tabooed Chinese. He welcomed the champion " from the classic shores of Italy" most warmly on the club's behalf and, in closing, touched upon the friendly diplomatic relations existing between Great Britain and M. Porta's mother country. Mr. Jas. Shaw, ex-mayor of Coolgardie supported, and after the toast had been drunk with musical honours, M. Porta responded in Italian, and Mr. L Ramaciotti interpreted I the sentiment in which the champion acknowledged the toast, Ports having said that he would ride to win and uphold the honour of Italy, and would gladly repay the many kindnesses shown him by Australians if ever he met many in his native country. 1 Other toasts followed, that of " Kindred ] Clubs," proposed by Mr. Law, being responded to by Messrs. Stuart (Northam), Elliott (Perth), Stotter (Fremantle), and Jas. Shaw (as patron of the Coolgardie Cycling Club. Mr. Shaw assured Porta of a hearty welcome from goldfields' cyclists. The remainder of the evening passed off pleasantly with songs from those present. ANGLING. WA. ANGLERS' CLUB. The newly-formed Anglers' Club held a meeting at the United Service Club Hotel last night, when the principal business transacted was the election of a provisional committee to draft rules and regulations for the governing of the club. About 40 members were enrolled. Mr. W. P. Pratt, hon. sec, proposes at an early date to call the provisional committee together. CRICKET. ANNUAL MEETING OF FREMANTLE CLUBS. The annual general meeting of the Port C.C. will be held at the Club Hotel, Fremantle, this evening, at 8 o'clock and the fragment meeting of the Fremantle club will be held to-morrow night at the same place ; and time. HOMING. PROPOSED CLUB FOR PERTH. Pigeon owners are requested to meet at the United Service Hotel at 8.30 to- night, when the question of the formation of a homing club will be considered. Mr. Longson, late honorary secretary to the South Australian Homing Association, has the matter in hand, and has been promised ^trong^snpportfrom local fanciers. BASEBALL. FREMANTLE V. PERTH. These clubs met for the third time on Saturday, and considerable interest was taken in the game. The first match was won by Perth and the second by Fre- mantle, and, as both clubs were very keen about winning two strong lines were picked. The game, which was played on the Esplanade, was delayed at the start, and later on interrupted for an hour by some footballers, who claimed the ground against the baseballers ; but, as the latter had the written authority of the City Council, the footballers were clearly in the wrong. Fremantle, batting first, scored heavily, making 6 runs, to which Perth responded with 3. Fremantle in their second scored 1 and Perth got home five times. Fremantle failed to score in their third and fourth innings, while Perth made victory assured by scoring 6 and 4. Fremantle then pulled themselves together and scored 5, 3, 2, while Perth answered with 3, 1, 1. The game was not seen at its best through the encroachment of the footballers, but on the play the Perth deserved to win, as generally, they fielded and batted better, Caldwell and O'Neild's batting being very fine, while the safety of Gardiner and Kelsey in the field, and each of whom scored 5 runs, the catch- ing of Brown, and who alone seemed to know how to slide was first-class. Howe at second base was very good, and had bad luck when at bat in being either left at base or out on a force. Seven innings were played, and. the scores are Fremantle B.C.-6,1,0,0,5,3,2 --- 17 PsrtliiB.C.-^M^M tHe 23 :, THE TURF. NOTES AND ANTICIPATIONS. [BY "PAYNATOB."] Nominations will be received to-morrow up till 5 p.m. by Mr. Stratford Strettle, secretary, for the following events, to be run at the meeting of the Canning Park Turf Club on Saturday, September 19 Hurdles, of 40sec" one mile and-a-half; 142 (and under) Galloway Handicap, of 15 sovs., five furlongs ; Canning Corinthian Handicap, of 35 sovs. (amateur riders), six furlongs 2 Maddington Stakes, of 15 sovs., for horses 14 2 and under, six furlongs ; Farewell Handicap, of 40 sovs., one mile. Weights for these races will be declared by the club handicapper, Mr. J. H. Smith, On or about Friday next, and entries for the selling race, the Auction Stakes, five furlongs, are due before 5 p.m. on Monday, September 14, when acceptances for the handicap events close. The Canning Park Turf Club has granted the use of its course to the Western Australian Polo Club, for the purpose of holding a race meeting on Saturday, October 10, and the committee of the Polo Club are preparing a programme of events for the occasion. A leading local sportsman yesterday booked a wager at evens for a substantial stake, taking Mr. W. B. Wilson's nominations against the field in the next V.R.C. Derby. Courage, Cydnus, Resolute, and Strathspey were nominated by the Squire of St. Albans for the Blue Riband event referred to, and while Newhaven and Coil are included in the field running against the supporter of Mr. Wilson's stable, I consider that the St. Alban's backer has a good bet. Applications for renewal of licenses from trainers and jockeys are being received by the secretary of the W.A. Turf Club, who reminds new arrivals from the eastern colonies, licensed by registered clubs, that until they have ridden a winner in this, colony they are not bound to apply for a local license. First Bolt, who fell in the Second Hurdles at the S.A.J.C. meeting at Morphetville on Saturday, is the identical gelded son of Thunderbolt who has hitherto performed only on the flat, winning over short courses when least expected to by his party, and paving sensational totalisator dividends. Eleusinian, Mr. David James's colt, who scored in the mile and a quarter Spring Handicap at Morphettville on Saturday, is the one colt that will represent South Australia in the next V.R.C. Derby. Trained at St. Leonard's, Glenelg, by the Hill Brothers, the son of Robinson Crusoe is in good hands, and is being given a sound preparation for the V.R.C. Blue Riband race. A correspondent writes suggesting that the Canning Park Turf Club should arrange with the railway authorities for a train to leave Perth for the racecourse at 1.15 p.m. on race days. At the present moment the club are negotiat- ing with the Railway Department to run a long train at 12.30 p.m., and a subsequent one at 1.15 p.m. to suit the convenience of race-goers who are unable, on account of business, to leave the city earlier on Saturdays.
