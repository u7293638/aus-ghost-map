Funny, ain't it, that , a hoy should be bigger than his pa ? \- Pa wanted a new suit of clothes, and ma said she would fix him, and so she took one ? of my old suits', and made it over, for pa, and he wore it a week before he knew it was an old suit made over. But one day lie found a handf ul of dried-up angle- worms in the pistolpocket that I had forgot when I was fishing, and pa laid the ' angle Trorms to ina, and ma had to explain that she made over one 'of my old suits ; for pa. He was mad, and took them off, and threw them, out the hack-window, and swore he ?would never humiliate himself by wearing. , his son's old clothes. Ma tried to' reason; with him1, tut he was awful worked up, and said lie was no old charity, hospital, ' arid he stormed around to find his old 'suit ; .of clothes, but ina had sold them to a plaster-of-Paris image-peddler, and pa hadn't anything to wear, and he wanted ma' to go out in the alley and pick up the Ysnit he threw out of the window, butarag- ?mari had picked them up, and. was going away, and pa he grabbed a linen duster/ and put it on, and went on after the rag picker, and he 'run and pa after him, and ? the rag-man told a policeman there was an ' escaped lunatic from the asylum, and he ; 'was chasing people all over the city, and' the policeman took pa by the linen ulster . ' and pulled it. off, and he was a sight when they to6k him to the police-station. Ma and me had to go down and bail him 'out, and the police lent us a tarpaulin to. put over pa, and we got him home, arid he is wearing his summer pants while the tailor makes him a new suit of clothes. I think pa is too 'excitable and too particular. I never kicked on wearing pa's old clothes, arid I think he ought to wear mine now.'— Peck's Sun. THE BAD BOY'S BICYCLE. .''??. ' I should think your pa would learn after a that he is too old to fool around as he did when he was a boy,' said the gror eery man, as he got away from the boy for fear he would be scalped. ' That's what I told him when he wanted to try my bioycle,' said the boy as he broke* out laughing. ' He saw me riding the ?bicycle, and said he could do it as well as I could, if he could once get on, but he couldn't spring up on it quite as spry as he used to, and he wanted me and my chum to hold it while he got on. I told him he would get hurt, but he said there, couldn't no hoy tell him anything about riding, and so we got the bicyle ;up against a 8hade-tree, and he put his feet on the 1 treadles and told us to turn her loose. Well, honest, I shut my eyes 'cause I didn't want to see pa get tied 'up in 'a knot. But he didl He pushed with one foot, and the bicycle, turned sideways ; then he \- pushed with the other foot and it began to wiggle, and then he pushed with both feet and pulled on the handles, and the front wheel struck an iron fence, and as pa -went on top of the . fence the hind wheel ) aeemed to rear up and kick him, and pa hung to the fence and the bicyole hung to him. and they both went down on the side walk, the big wheel on pa's stomach one handle up his trousers leg, the other handle down his coat collar, and the other wheel rolling around bach and forth ovea his fingers, and he yelling to us to take it off. I never saw people tangled up the way pa and the bicycle, was, arid we h&dtotakeitapartfand; take pa's coat off and roll up his pants to get him out. ' ;.. '{When he gotpu, arid shook himself to 8ee if he was all there and looked at as though he didn't know it was loaded, and looked at me and then at my chum in a 1 sort of nervous way, and looked around and scringed as though he expected the bioycle was going to sneak up behind him and kick him again j he wanted me to go and get the axe to break the bicycle up with, and when I laughed he was going to take me by the -. neck and maul the bicycle, butjl reasoned him out of it. I wasn't to blame for his trying to gallop over an iron picket fence with a bicycle, Jcause I told him he had better keep off of it. -I think if men would take advice from ; ? Doys of tener they wouldn't be so apt to get their suspenders caught on an iron picket fence and have to be picked up in a basket But there is no, ?use of us boys telling a grown, person anything, and by keeping still and letting them break their bones, we save getting kicked. It would da some men good to he boys all their lives, then they wouldn't have to imitate. Hello, there :?? goes the police wagon, and I am going to see how it rides on the back steps,' and the boy went out and jumped- on the hind ' end of the wagon, and then picked himself tip out of the mud and felt on |his head where the policeman club dropped on it.
