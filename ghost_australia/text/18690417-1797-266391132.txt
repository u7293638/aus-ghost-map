SONG OF THE SQUATTERS. (From the Ghost.) MACLEAY. Jack Robinson's the boy for us, No matter, right or wrong, He's still the best decoy for us,— Then, Squatters, muster strong! GORDON. 'Tis true, we can't feel proud, my boys, While sitting at his back; But none can gall the crowd, my boys, Like free Selection Jack. LLOYD. There's none can turn about like him, When baffled by a foe; Or brazen matters out like him, When plainly 'tis no go. ALL THREE. Then muster and be jolly, boys, Jack Robinson's our man; To lose the game were folly, boys,— We'll grab the most we can.
