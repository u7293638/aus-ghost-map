SELECTED POETRY. AN OLD MAID. She lived among the level lanes, In summer sweet with many flowers ; But, oh, she must have found them dull In wet November hours ! Her home was filled with dainty thing, Of boundless value in her eyes, And safe from thieves — for what's the worth Of ancient memories ? She had her house-mates — dog and bird, And pussy ; and her wordly care Wa3 to provide them with roof and food, AVhen she should not be there. She had dependants — little maids, I Who came unkempt, ill- willed, uncouth: She marked their linen, watched their ways, I And taught them thrift and truth. She had her friends, who came and went — | Alatrons who, bursting, claimed her aid — | The boy, his father judged a fool — The woeful, jilted maid. She had her pride ; she liked to. rear Choice flowers and dainty chicken brood j She held us bound to make the best Of all God makes so good. She had her letters — from afar They often came, through foreign posts ; And some seemed angels to her heart, And some I fear were ghosts. She had her prayers : we may not guess What yearnings rise when heads are bowed ; I think she whispered many a name She never breathed aloud ! She had her memories : had she loved, ! Or been beloved, she never told ; But on her thin left-hand she wore | A ring of Indian gold.
