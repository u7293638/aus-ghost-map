OCTOBER 4, 1884. Mr. ELLERY'S address to the mem- bers of the Royal Society at the annual conversazione last night was, as usual, full of matter, and the deliverance was as interesting as it was concise. The various scientific topics which have occupied attention during the year were passed in review, and no work of value that has been accomplished in the field of science was allowed to escape notice. It is gratifying to learn that the Royal Society itself is in a prosperous condi- tion and full of vitality. When such institutions flourish, it is a sign that the community is not given over altogether to the struggle for material advance- ment, but that some of its members, at all events, are directing their thoughts to intellectual pursuits. Mr. ELLERY was able to speak not only for the Royal Society, but for the numerous kindred associations which have grown up in our midst. It was not necessary to enter into details, but Mr. ELLERY was fully warranted by facts when he said that the progress of these societies had kept pace very fairly with that of the Royal Society. Of the public institu- tions resting upon a scientific basis, Mr. ELLERY spoke in high praise. He re- ferred with satisfaction to the con- tinued growth of the natural history museum, and to the numerous addi- tions with which its zoological col- lection has been enriched. Amongst these he was good enough to give a special place to the collection illustra- tive of the zoology of New Guinea, obtained by The Argus exploring expe- dition, and presented by the proprietors to the Museum. Turning to the In- dustrial Museum and School of Tech- nology, Mr. ELLERY spoke with commendation of the progress which is being made 'Iho valuo of this school of science is well attested by Mr Elleky, who says that, with tho know ledge gained in the institution, j oung men find that not only can they ontci manufactories where technical bkill is required, but that they can aloo obtain lmpoitant public positions Regarding astronomical progress in Australia, Mr ELLERY had a good deal to say At all the observatories steady work has been done, and in all the colo nies attention has been directed to the improvement of appliances, upon whIch no less than upon the skill and industry of the observers does the performance of satisfactory astronomical work de pend Brief reference was made to the hue transit cuelo recently erected at the Melbourne Obscrvato-*j, adescnp tion of which appeared in lhe Ar/tts a few weeks ago Attention was also directed to \anous impro\cmcnts in astronomical and physi' al instruments, made at tho Sjdney Observatory, by Mr Hdssei L, to the erection of a new transit circlo at the Adelaide Observa tory , and to the erection of a similar lnstiument at Hobart, where the Obser vatorj, which was originally erected chiefly foi meteorological observation, is being enlarged, so as to extend its scope to astronomical work Mentjon was also made of the interesting fact that a cential observatory is to be erected m Queensland, foi tho purpose of cairy mg out the geodetic survey of that colony We are further informed that in September next there will be a total eclipso of the sun, which, how ever,will bevi'-ibloon.y in New Zealand Astronomers from all patts of tho world will doubtless go thither, and Mr ELLERY speaks of the probability of a small observing party being sent from in own Observatory. The probability should be turned into a certainty. When we have tho instruments and ob sei voi s at command, it would be ne glccting an obvious duty it Victoua wore to be umoprescnted Mr ELLERY has brought together some noteworthy facts concerning the recent earthquakes and earthtremors in Tasmania. These have been re- markable, as everyone is aware, for their great frequency rather than for their severity. If any alarm has been felt on the subject, it has been occa- sioned by the thought of what may happen, rather than by what has actually occurred. But Mr. ELLERY directs attention to some features about these phenomena which appear to be not only singular but unprece- dented in the first place, the disturb- ances differed from ordinary earthquake shocks in being continuous, the perturba- tion of the earth's surface continuing in some cases for several hours. Then the tremors appeared to affect the sur- face only, and not the deeper strata. They were startlingly manifest on the surface, but quite unnotice- able in shafts 12ft. below. Again the tremors caused the ferns and small bushes to tumble and wave about rapidly, while moderate sized saplings and large trees were not affected at all. These facts are of much scientific interest. Australia and Tasmania have always been regarded, Mr. ELLERY says, as being far removed from any centres or lines of seismic activity, and these repeated tremblings, therefore, constitute a problem—and we might add a somewhat difficult one—for the geologist and physicist. Mr. ELLERY does not omit to notice the red sunsets, and to point out that the "Krakatoa "eruption theory," which for a time took a strong hold of the scientific mind —somewhat unaccountably we always thought—is going out of favour. It has been lound that led sunsets and bulhant afteiglows weio not uucpmmon bcfoie the Kiakatoa outbiust (notably in South Afuca, as we took occasion to point out somo months ago), and Mi ELLERY fancies it will be eventually discovered that " the great catastrophe of Sunda Strait directed special attention to peculiar atmospherical 'appearances, which, after all, were " not of any paiticular rautj " Mi Eui m s remaiks conceining ininfall and watci consenation aio ot pecuhai interest and importance A icfcicnco to the lainfall map, piopnred under Ins duection at the Obsenatoij, a/dc \inule of which it may be mentioned was ic contly issued with j /it Avstiatawm, bungs out, he sa\s, a \eiy prominent fact, \i/, that it is "only a fungo of " the gieat Australian continent that is blessed with suflicient rainfall to " make successful agucultmo possible, : while o\ci a -vast area the aveiage is " so small as to make it a matter of " surprise that such an and region can " havo maintained Aast ílocks ot shcci), " which return, in fa\ouiablo seasons, " enoimous wealth in tho shape of " wool " 'Iho ma\imum rainfall which can be expected in theso regions in tho most fa\oiuablo jcais is lum to lorn per annum Fa\ oin ablo jeais aro tho lew est, and Mr Lunn, cautions Hock ovvneis, thci"forp not to bo "tempted "bj i fa "Kid \ ears, when tho ian r ot onl) been ncai the : ma\ un, Dut also well timid, to in " cioaso their (locks bejond then powci " of mamtenaneo in the drier years " winch aie always found to follow ' It would bo well ii thoso vvoids of wain ing and advice weie boino in mind and acted upon There is only one portion of Mr. Ellery's address which will be read with dissatisfaction. It is that which announces his intention of retiring from the position of president of the Royal Society at the close of its present session. He has occupied the position by the unanimous will of the members for l8 consecu- tive years, and he thinks it would be advantageous to the society if a change were to take place. The members, we venture to think, will be of a dif- ferent mind. Mr lnmY possesses such a compichonsno grasp of matters pertaining to science, that it would bo difficult to lind any one so well fitted for the position of leader, and as long as he is ablo and willing to perfoim the ' functions which ho has so ndmnably dischaiged dmmg the best paît of two decades, wo fancy ho will please tho members most by continuing to presido over their dchbciat ons JohnStuart Mili,who contemplated all creeds loftily, pronounced that the Conservatncs of England were stupid and tho Liberals shallow The ono side gcnoially quote tho ono half of tho dictum and the other sido tho other half But tho taunt would seem to 1» becoming untiuo of tho English Con servative1-, so far as then electoial campaign is concerned Just now they havo inaugurated a new departure m politics When Mi Gr .dsionj- ap pealed for an agitation agunst tho Houso of Loids ho doubtless expected that precedent would bo followed, ana the demonstiations would bo confined to tho one side Gieatly has ho been mistaken Not a monster meeting at Birmingham, Leeds, oi m Midlothian but has been followed by a counter assembly 'Iho Maiquis ot !b.LiSBin.Y is as vigoious on tho platform as Cobdi n was a generation back But meetings, though novel for tho party, aio not onginal, and whcio the leaders have broken now ground is m organising the political picnic It is claimed that nearly all tho joung mon of tho daj belong to the Conseivn ti ves Without venturing to etpicss an opinion on this point, it is certain that all tho old castles do Those " stately homes of England," whoss praises the English delight to rehearse in \erso and prose, aie for the most part in their hands And on this ad vantage the Conservative'1 havo sei?cd In all directions tho noble owncri of historic piles, of magnificent mansions, and of w ide spreading paiks and do mains, aio naming days for the recep tion of tho masses from tho towns and cities to confer with them on the political situation in pleasant spots and under agreeable associations E\cnr sion tiains îun at cheap fares, the tickots include refreshments, aftei view ing feudal relics, startling the fallow deer fiOm under ancient oaks, or spending an horn at cricket, lawn tennis, oi bowls, the mon and their wives and families assemble on some lawn or terrace, to hear short addi esses from such star orators as can bo brought together.

W. Selby. The conversazione passed off most successfully. The president's address dealt in a full and interesting manner with the scientific pro- gress of the last year, which embraced such fruitful topics as recent earthquakes and earth tremors in Tasmania, the peculiar red sunsets observed some time ago, questions bearing on drought and rainfall, the work of kindred societies, and astronomical and general scientific developments.

As we are always anxious to correct any mistakes or mis- statements that may inadvertently appear in our columns we took steps, though not officially invited, to be represented at the meeting and to secure a full report of the proceedings. It will be observed however that though the speakers plentifully bespattered our contributor with abuse they confined themselves entirely to general denunciations, and we are still completely in the dark as to the particular statements in the article to which objection is taken. An amusing inc- dent of the meeting was the proposal to raise funds to pay a reporter from the staff of our radical contemporary to write a "fair and impartial account of Mooroopna. This Mooroopnian idea of how "impartial re- ports are to be obtained in certain quar- ters is not a little remarkable. The meeting, however, did not at all approve of this direct appeal to their pocketa, and de- cided to allow our contemporaries to furnish their "impartial accounts of Mooroopna at their own expense. A movement has been commenced w ith a view to the establishment of a corn trade association in Melbourne, and it lina so far assumed definite shape that a meeting of those interested m the grain trade has been called for 1 ucsdav next, to take steps to form the association 'Hie October sittings of the Supreme Court will commence on Monday, before Mr Jus tice Holroyd 'lhere are 20 cases for trial

decision of the Supreme Court was given jeaterday in the action of the Gat ibaldi Mining Company v the Craven's New Chum Company, Sandhurst The plaintiffs owned an allotment fronting Rose atreet

whole of the width of the street 'lhe lease authorised the defendants to mine for gold on the land comprised in the lease Latterly the plaintiffs have discovered that the defendants were undermining in that portion of Bosc street which was nearest the Garibaldi Company, and they Eought for an injunction to restrain the defendants from continuing the trespass The plaintiffs rested their case on a decision given by the Supreme Court m 18G9 in Davis 1 'I he Queen, to the effect that a person who hod obtained a grant from the Crown of an allot- ment fronting a atreet had the freehold in the soil

no right to the gold, aa the gold had been ex preaBly reserved to the Crown and its licensees by the Crown grant, and it was not shoivn that anything but the gold or auriferous earth had been taken lhe Court decided m favour of the defendants Mr Justice Higin botham and Mr Justico Williams wero of opinion that the half of the street did not belong to the plaintiffs at all , that the decision in Davis v 2 he Queen was wrong, and they therefore overruled it Mr Justice Holroyd also thought that the de cisión in Davis v lhe Queen was wrong, but he would not expressly overrule it, as the point had not been argued, but he agreed with Mr Justice Higinbotham that the plaintiffs had no right to the gold- He also said that, apart from the taking of the gold, it did not appear that any material portion of the soil had been removed The Court therefore decided to dismiss the application for an injunction against the defendants mining on the ground in dispute The following holidays were
