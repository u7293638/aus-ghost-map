ECHOES' OF MELBOURNE ., ? :'''. '. I' rBT'TiiBGuosTT ' ,. . ? : :' ! It .would alnibst seem,; from the readiness, displayed by 'honourable members! of- the i Assembly to .' shunt' -. the magnus opus :? of the session— the Licensing Bill — whenever they can find or make an opportunity, that' they are somewhat puzzled in regard to' the'. '' safest' attitude to asauuie in regard to the 'measure., Tuesday's' sitting, which was to be exclusively devotpd to. the con sideration of the bill, was entirely occupied in a fruitless discussion on the recent court-martial proceedings in connection Vith the mutinous -members of the ?Defence Force.' 'The question was raised :hy Mr Bent under cover of a motibn for adjourn ment, ]\ and -tlie1, pb^ectless talk 'was continued , jduring,, the , .^yhole /evening. Tlie speakers ivho in -the greatest degree distinguished ^.themselves by their utter ignorance of the subject they were dealing with, arid the ridiculous theories they pro pounded in respect to military discipline, were Professor Pearson, Mr. 'Qaunsori, Mr. Bent, arid last, but not least,' Lieut.-' Colonel Sinith, who availed himself of the (Bjrts of : parliamentary privilege to give, utterance ,to sentiments which, spoken elsewhere, .would assuredly have caused him to appear before !a court-martial charged1 with:' conduct unbecoming an officer jarid a gentleman, arid '. subversive of military discipline.'' ': . ? . V'::. That the Licensing AnienJuierifBill will, to borrow Mr^ Patterson's phrase,' go into Committee one bill, fand come out another' is ,a.' moral' certainty. ?: Petitions for arid against the' measure are being poured1 into ?the Assembly f rom allsides. So numerous and 'bulky wore the documents ?' placed on; the' table of the.Assemblyon Tuesday,that ' /a special messenger was fully employed in ; removing thopile of papers placed before, the Clerk i of the House. The majority,. of;( f.thej.petitioners consisted of those members of, the- .Wesleyan persuasion ?who 'are' against -any compensation1 being' paid to' dispossessed publicans, in favour of rlb,cal'. .option without liinitatiori, and strbrigly' averse to the employment' bf ^barmaids' aid' Sunday trading of any kindV ,'Mr.- -Beri,t,; : who. om this occasion has assumed ithe role\ of the publican's friend;- raised a 'laughvat' the expense of the chief opponents of Sunday :' Ayqrk,.bypqinting.outthat'all the petitions' against this olassof labour had :beerisig'ned; ; oh; the Sabbath. . , Itis'safeitfregardito.'thef bill to predict that if ever it.becqmes'.law, it will onlv be' after a -vast 'amount: of': dreary talk, and .as: the Government- have; handed it: over ta- the -Legislature.! to- be' ?dealt with. in a '. go-as-you-please' fashion, the last state ;bf the measure ;will ? iiidubi-'' tably.be worse than' the1' fijrst,J.and'!'

But their example has not been generally followed, and a3 the Company are rapidly engaging new drivers, the 'strikers' are hardly likely to be -much benefited by their combined action. In, a: few days the Vic torian metropolis will? have once irioro assumed its busy and 'bussy' appearance,; and no one but thq omnibus drivers be a bit the- worse off ? than; they now are. . , / !

A 'syndicato' was a few weelcfl. since formed in Melbourne for the purpose of 'taking, up' the Mt. Morgan . claims, and this has juetbeon done. Among, the gentlemen who, if successful in ousting the. present holders, will become the hew. propvietory, are, it is said, /an ex-mayor of Melbourne, a leading Ballarat solicitor, a Melbourne ditto, arid one: or two mining speculators. Shares. in the venture ate at a premium.
