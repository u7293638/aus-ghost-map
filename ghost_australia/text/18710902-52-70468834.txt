HOW IT HAPPENED. I pray you, pardon mo, Elsie, And smile that frown away That diras tho light «f your lovely face "' As a thunder-cloud tho day. I really could not help it, Before I thought 'twas dono, And those groat groy eyes flashed bright and cold, Liko an icicle in thc sun. I was thinking of the summors When wo were boya and girls, And -wandered in tho blossoming woods, And tho gay winds romped with your curls. And you seomecl to me the same little girl £ kissed in-thc aldor-path : I kissed tho littlo girl's lips, and alas ! I have roused a woman's wrath. There is not much to pardon, For why wero your lips so red? Tho blond hair folt in a shower of gold From the proud, provoking head. And the beauty that flashed from the splondid eyes, And played round tho tender mnuth, Rushed over my soul like a warm sweet wind That blows from tho fragrant south. And where, after all, lathe harm done? I helievo we wore made to'bo g*y ; And all of youth not given to lovo Is vainly squandered away. And strewn through life's low labours, Like gold il tho desert sands, Are love's swift kissos and sighs and vows And the clasp of clinging hands. And when you aro old and Ionoly, In Memory's magio shine You will see on your thin and wasting hands, Like goms, those hisses of mino. And when you muso at evening At the sound of some vanished name, The ghost of my kisses shall touch your lips And kindle your heact to flame.
