PASTORAL: STOCK MOVEMENTS AND MARKETS. DUBBO STOCK REPOBT.-July 28.-The weather, since our last, baa been fine. On Friday night it commenced raining, and continued to come down during the night. About half an inch of rain fell. Next day it looked clouded, and like a further fall, but the sky soon cleared off, and since then we have had it fine. We have had some heavy froBta-those on Sunday and Monday mornings were, perhaps, the severest this winter. The frosts were checking the growth of feed, and what we want now ia forty-eight houra steady rain, followed by drooping warm weather. If we are not thus favoured soon, there will be no spring, or anything worthy of the name. The country about here id looking very bare and dry, and stock are only the ghosts of their former selves. Cattle are dying near Dubbo, and we hear of several farmers losing many from sheer starvation. Down the Macquarie the country ia sadly in want of rain. In some parts things are as bad as they were in the drought. Preparations for shear ing are being made on all sides. At one or two sheds they have commenced already, and by the middle of August the mijorisy of sneds will be in full spring. We hear that some owners will put over shearing for a month or so, in the hope of a break in the weather and an addition to the feed. The Dubbo district stock items are as follow:-2400 fat sheep (Alisun and Sons) from Merula have gone on to the Orange Slaughtering Works, to be killed for export. 200 fat cattle (J. F. Egan's) have left the Marthaguy ; 40 are for the local market. The balance will be trucked to Sydney. 250 fat cattle (Cobb and Co.'s} are going to B.thurst. 200 fat cattle (Robinson's) bought from Mr. J. L Brown, are about leaving the Brigalows. Two lots of fat cattle (Morgan's) from the Castlereagh are on the road, coming this way. They ere either sold or under offer. Several other lots, bought on the stations, are being mustered. Fat Cattle are getting very scarce. -Dubbo Dispatch. HAY STOCK REPOBT.-27th July.-32 points of rain fell on Friday evening and Saturday last. The weather haB since been mild, though inclined to be frosty at night. Shearing commences generally in this district and on the Lachlan on 1st August, and judging from the number of shearers who have passed through Hay during the past three weeks, there will be no lack of hands.

According to a decision which has just been rendered in England, railroad, steamboat, omnibus, and street car passengers in that country have some rights which the corporations and companies owning these con- veyances are hound to respect. Suit was brought recently oy a passenger on a local tramwr.y car, against the company, on the ground that twelve more passengers than the car could comfortably accom- modate were admitted. This point was not denied by the defence, so that the only question to be deter- mined was whether any contract to the contrary existed between the company and its patrons. In passing upon this point the Judge held that the com- pany was bound by two contracts-one to carry passengers generally, and the other not to carry more than a given number in each conveyance. In other words, the passenger ia entitled not only to trans- portation, but to transportation with comfort and safety, and when any one of these conditions is violated the aggrieved party is entitled to damages. THE SWISS ELIXIE -Tonics are generally unpal- atable, but the famous cordial with which the moun- taineers of Switzerland have almost from time imme- morial recruited their physical strength when ex- hausted by fatigue, exposure, or sickness, is an ex- ception to the rule. The " Dew of the Alps," a pura vegetable stimulant and restorative, which for several centuries has been the standard remedy of the Swiss for indigestion, nervous debility, loss of appetite, and mental despondency, is indisputably one of the most delicious and genial preparations that ever tickled the taste of an epicure. The importation of the article into this market-for which we are in« debted to Messrs. M, Moss and Co., sole representa« tives nf the Geneva manufacturers in Australia-haa met with signal favour, and the "Dew of the Alps" is likely to take the place of all the nauseous and far less efficacious tonics hitherto in use. 3166 Mexico will make a serious blunder if she excludes citizens of foreign birth from Con- gress. . Our Congress attracts more immi- grants than our grainfields. A Washington free-and-easy is a great card with us. They now say that the romantic story about the recently wedded Princess Stephanie being hopelessly in love with an American. 1 gentleman is all moonshine.
