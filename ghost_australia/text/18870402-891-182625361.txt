> Do Not Be Alarmed..^ ' A Reutzh'S message says that a widespread conspiracy has been discovered in Spain; In Spain there ore persons who desire to overturn the present throne. If any other were set up thoy would cherish toward* it similar desires. Bat there is no need to be alarmed. The message brings its own. assurance. . It is said that the conspiracy is " widespread." That is a guarantee that it is harmless. Discontent may be widespread, and so may re volt ; but conspiracy seldom or never. The discontent breeds the conspiracy which is secret in its plans and movements until the hour comes, and then revolt, which promises to be successful may become popnlor. It appears to rait, the present Government of Spain to keep the ghost of conspiracy in the closet, and every, now and again to bring it out. No better pretence can bo thought of, because it is al ways likely to bo true, and it is always effec tive. The Government desire to remove some troublesomeporson, tho plea is a conspiracy; that is all, nothing more.
