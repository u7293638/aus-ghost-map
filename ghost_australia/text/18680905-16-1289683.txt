The fourth man at once gave the alarm, and the miners quickly removed the earth, when it was found that two out of the three men were comparatively uninjured. The third man, however, had been struck on the chest and killed by a piece of timber which fell with the soil. On the following day an inquiry was held by Captain Lambert, PM. Several witnesses were examined, and the evidence went to prove that no neglect was attributable to anyone. On Thursday after- noon the funeral took place. It was attended by a large number of the deceased's fellow workmen and other residents. He was an Odd- fellow, and the procession was preceded by nearly f¡fty members of various lodges, the body being carried by hand through the main streets of both townships, while hymns were sung by members of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, with which the deceased miner was connected. Before starting, a funeral service was held in the Wesleyan Church, and at the grave a second sevice was held, the Rev. Mr. Parkinson officiating. The rev. gentlemen was followed by the N G , who read an appropriate address The procession then re- formed, and each Odd- fellow in passing the grave threw into it a small green twig, according to custom. The deceased's name was Joseph Faull; he was a young man and much respected; he leaves a wife and one child in South Australia. The expense of inter ment was borne by the company, so that the whole of the lodge money-about £35-will be at the disposal of the bereaved widow. ON Aug. 15 a very unusual phenomenon was observed in Moreton Bay by the residents of Sandgate. As it was popularly described, there were five " tides" in the day. We were unable to obtain any very definite description of the rise and fall of the water, but from all we can gather it seems that the water came in like the ordinary tide, and rose somewhat above the level of the highest springs. They came in rapidly and almost immediately receded. We learn that Mr. Slaughter's sons were cleaning out their boat on the beach, at Humpy Bong, when sud- denly, to their astonishment, they found the boat was afloat. They pulled out towards the bay, but before they had got many yards the boat grounded, and was again left high and dry. This occurred several hours before the time the boat could have been floated by the tide under ordinary circumstances. The same phenomenon took place five times during the day, and created some alarm in the minds of the more timid. There are of course many conjectures as to cause of these extraordinary waves, and the most prevalent notion is that the eclipse had something to do with them. The most feasible theory, however, seems to be that they are the result of volcanic action, for though far inferior in volume and velocity they appear in some respects to have resembled the earthquake waves which did such damage at St. Thomas' about twelve months ago, and more recently at the Sandwich Islands. There can be no doubt also from these waves having swept over the bay simultaneously with those mentioned as having appeared in Port Jackson, that they resulted from the same cause in both places. Strange to say they did not affect the river at Brisbane. For the previous two or three nights, however, the tides had been unusually high even for springs. On Sunday night the water was within six inches of flowing into the shed on Harris' wharf. This great rise is remarkable, as the highest tide of the springs, or as it is called the " King tide," does not usually take place until a day or two after the full or change of the moon. The committee of the N. Brisbane School of Arts have completed a new arrangement by which they will procure about £5 worth of books monthly from England We understand that *' a list wdl be kept open for members to put "e down the names of any particular books they aot I wlBh to be added to the library.
