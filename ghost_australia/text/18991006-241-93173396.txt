THE TOWN OF BABYVILLE. It's the dearest town, the fairest town, the prettiest town to mie, Of all the towns In all the lands, this side or 'cross tile sea; It's sunshine there, and moonshine there, and starshine all the time, And it's never,cold, and none get old, in its lovely summer clime; There's never a ghost or goblin there, and sin was never known, And no one ever felt a pang or heard a neigh hour groan, And the birds sing alway, night and day-in fact, they're never still. In this airy. fairy, darling place, tile Town of Babyville. The shops are full of sweetmeats, and they're sold for just a song, The hobby horses in the streets are free the whole day long; The band plays every afternoon, there's fire worlts every night, And all the babies toddle- out to see the glorious elght. You kiss them as you meet them; and they kiss you whenlyou go, And clap their hands, and laugt ' with glee, to see you at their show; The doctor died last summer, and is resting o'er the hill. For none get sick, they haven't. time,, in' the Town of Babyvilte. -"Bradford Observer,"
