DALDY IN A QUANDARY, Dalby it the most unfortunate town in j Queensland (says " Quid Nunoo" in the Charle-' ville Timet). Everything seems to conspire to play it low down on the place, and its burghers are always in trouble. This time the Muni cipal Council in the difficulty. The corporation is in a "bung" oondition, and the local paper, voicing popular sentiment, suggests thai it " complacently give up the ghost end attend its own funeral." This it stoutly refuses to do so long as some one oan he found to run the show. The majority of the allotments within the suburban area have long since been re pudiated by their owners, and are consequently non-revenue-producing. The income from rates just about squares the expense of their collection; while the whole caboose only exists on the tolerance of the Government, to whom it is indebted to an amount for which the en tire town would be little mote than an adequate security-a yearly increasing liability. This is, indeed, a melancholy state of affairs. No wonder the Divisional Board declines to be saddled with the incubus.
