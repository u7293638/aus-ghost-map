MEMORY. (From a Weekly Magazine.) When the soft tear steals silently down from the eye, Take no note of its course, nor direct the slow tigh : ilrom some spring of soft sorrow its origin flows, Some tender remembrance that weeps as it goes. Ah ! it is not to say what will bring to the mind The joys that are fled, and the friends left behind ; A time, or a song, or the time of the year, j Strikes the key of reflection, and moans on the ear. i Thro' the gay scenes of youth, the remembrance strays, j Till Memory steps back on past pleasures to gaze ; Fleeting shades they now seem, that glide silent away, The remains of past hours, and the ghost of each day. Let the tear then drop silent, nor mark the full eye The soul's secret oft'ring no mortal should spy, Few souls are prepored for a rite so divine ; When the feelings alone sacrifice to the shrine.
