A BYGONE SPORTING NOTORIETY To begin from the beginning an admirable mode oof saving time, about the year 1818-19 there were few pugilists of the patrons of the P. R. fot that matter, that over went down to a “merry mill” in the custom counties who were unacqua- -inted—if they themselves were at all known in the spoiling world,if only by name — with a tallish, powerfully built, brown haired, somewhat beetle-browed, but by no means in other ways ill-looking young gentleman of fast tastes, who haled from Norwich, was tho son of a much respected alderman of that city, had some time served in the army as a subaltern in Spain, had by no means a bad notion of amateur theatricals, dearly loved a prize fight, and with youth, strongth high spirits, a little money, and at that time a decent business as a bombazine manifacturer at his back, preferred spending his days and nights in a sporting society to the following out of a career marked out for him by his stay at home parents. His name was Mr John Thurtell to his inferiors, his friends of the “fancy” behind his back called him the “swell yokel.” For somo six years previous to the dates above any one who might have cared to droop in at night for a friendly pipe and glass of grog with the red-faced old stage-coachman at any of the Charring Cross hostelries, might have heard singing songs of questionable propriety as the small hours wore on, a down looking, sallow, well featured. young man with big black whiskers and a remarkably good tenor voice. This person, whose profession was that of a tenth rate public singer to a superficial observer carried no worse expressions on his face than a slight look of good nature, leavened by a little sensuality and no end of silliness. As a lazy, public house vocalist who preferred the free and easy familiarity, drunken applause, and hail fellow well met friendship of a pot house to aught more enduring or lucrative, “Joe Hunt” was known in those years to most of the fast night birds of the metropolis as one whose song redeemed the stupidity of his company. In that capacity doubtless, about 1819 John Thurtell, the so called “swell yokel” from Norwich, on one of his many runs up to London on the spree, " became acquainted with this man, who, but for his complicity in a terrible crime, would long ago have been forgotten by all decent people. So much for two of our dramatis personna. Some years before John Thurtell learned to mix himself up in "ring barneys," and from a “fly flat” to become a “sharp,” with an ugly stain of murder in the long run attaching itself to his memory ; and before Joseph Hunt’s fine voice had grown none the better for late hours and much gin and water in public houses, a heavy fuccd man was acting as clerk to u wmo merchant named Bramwell, in a lui go way of buBinoBs at Pimlico Wo next find lum mar ned, and carrying on business on his own uo count by dint of much " cheek' and nocipilal in tho IToymarkot, residing privatoly at tho houso of Sir Lambert-we behove tho firm of I ambort and Co , silversmiths, existo still-ni Coventry strcot, Haymarket One fino day however, our soi disant prosporouB wmo mci chant, who was clover enough ou next to no thing, savo credit, to keep an elegant establish rocnt and " flash about " town in the neatest of tilburies, with the smallest of " tigers," went to smash, and into the " Bench" prison to the tune of £22,000 During his confinement there-ho was always at heart a sneaking roguo, who would have stolen a blind man's ttu-k, or a canary bird's sugar-ho actually robbed the till bolong ing to tlio prison cólico houso, and got six months for it " on the mill " ut Brixton Iho name of this gentleman was Mr William Pro bert, of whom the lato Mr Justice Park de clared that " a more infamous scoundrel novor presontod bimsolf in a court of jubIico" ona later and painfully memorable occasion to which we aro coming shortly-our prosont objoot being first to givo you the " nomos, weights, and colorB of the riders," as tho " o'rect card " mon say, and then, more nostio, to "report the running," ub best wo moy Como wo now to the last of our quartotto of " bad eggs," one William Woore, whose fearful end, howevor much it may excite our horror, hasnevcr, wo must confess, moved ub to anything like compassion About the time that delightful Mr. William Probert carno out of " quod," and from selling wine took to more general " picking up," Autolycus hko, of those " uncon Bidered trifles" that floated on the seething sur- face of fast and loose London society in his day, as in ours, a Mr William Weare lived in somo very nicely got up, but externally dork, dreary chambers m that abomination of brick aid mortar desolation, Lyon'a Inn, now, thank Pro- vidence and the innovating Strand Hotel Com- pany-if the two can decontly come into Buch close juxtaposition- pulled down Of this man all wo know is exactly about as much na wo know to day of scores of other freo and easy pleasant pcoplo «ho hvo by thotr wits on nothing m London, and fatton on that samo agrooablo nothing Ho was ono of tho numcr ous olaas that inodom civilisation foista for its folly upon society In tho mediroval ngos ho would havo boon a moro pettifogging tlnof whom somo feudal lord would havo Btrung up to a troo for filching n purao oi robbing a honrooat In our moro enlightened times ho was roputed to bo a woll to do " gentlomun of no occupation," fond of Bhootmg, with no objection to n quiet gamo nt clnokon hnrard and an houi 01 two oi cry night at hilliards 'lruo, his dour friends said that " no deader nail than William Woaro ovor queered n flat nt tho ' bonos,' cards, or bil hards" But, thon, fuonds, wo know, aro eo leiy hypocittical!
