CHURCH SERVICES. I ST. JAMES'S, SYDNEY. The Bishop of Bathurst preached on Sunday morning in St James's Church, taking for his text Acts II, 42, "And they continued steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and in prayer " The Bishop said that the past had been no common week in the history of the Church here The gathering of Australia's sons and daughters had been large, important subjects had been discussed, in most cases temperately and carefully, brave w tds spoken, and weighty ones too The one who had so ably presided over the varying fortunes of the Church for a period only too short had crowned his work in a manner worthy of his high reputation, and now he believed they might all turn back with much profit to the earliest book of Church history, and pray that the result of this great gathering, this earnest enthusiasm, this full deliberation, might be summed up in the words of the text, and that men of the future may be able to use such terms in speaking of the churchmen of to day, " and they continued " so He next spoke of the text as taking its stand upon the essential elements of a true Church, striking the very keynote of all right principles and action, and the first of these was " Apostolic doctrine " By doctrine was meant those truths which form the basis of the whole system of revealed religion As to the exact reference of the text there might be a difficulty, some thinking mention was mode of the teachings which our Lord ha] Himself given to His Apostles, and others to those based upon the story of His life The preacher then went on to show now doctrine gradually assumed a definite form, starting from the first simple creed, " In the name of the rather and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost" He said we never could be too thankful for the creed as safeguards against error, and one of the most important proofs that we have a right to our position as a true branch of Christ's Holy Catholic Church Speaking on the subject of Apostolic fellowship," he said that, whilst he adhered strongly to the teaching and practice of the church and, with American bishops, held the Episcopate to be an inherent part of the deposit of Christian faith and order committed by Christ and his apostles to the Church, and therefore incapable of compromise or surrender, yet at the same time no one recognised more fully than he did the evident tokens of the working of the Spirit of God in other religious bodies He would that not even a shadow should fall across a brother's faith who worshipped the same Lord, yet, at the same time, he never could give up what he held to be truth for the sake of peace The time had not yet come for the drawing together of all, but in God's good time it would come In the meantime, let us labour and pray for this in the words of our own Litany, " And grant that all they that do confess I by holy name may agree in the truth of Thy holy Word, and live in unity and Godly peace " He urged the more thorough recognition of the apostolic fellowship " among ourselves Parties there ore, and parties there must be his feeling is as old as Christianity itself, and so long as we are subject to human infirmity it must exist No Church has been without them, and the Church of England is no exception to the rule The red ice he gave was that h party should strive to fill the other more and more with the spirit of the Divine Master, and carefully guard against anything that assumes the form of any Christian error The " Church fellowship " is very wide and broad Ita far-reaching powers should be recognised, and yet at the same time it must not be forgotten that there are well-defined boundaries over which men must not pass without danger to themselves and the church of which they are members After referring to the other points of the text, the Bishop said that steadfastness was the great underlying principle, which should bind together all these other essentials-not one note of the apostolic harmony must be lost " Lord give all race above all things to live unto Christ to proclaim Him fearlessly to an unbelieving world, recognising the Church as His body, in all its largeness and comprehensiveness, in all its gentleness and Â»vnitiathy, in its many activities, carrying the Lamb in its bosom, bringing in the wanderer, uplifting the fallen in its utter and distinct refusal to be narrowed by the utterances of any school or sympathies of any party This is our position, the end of our prayers, our toils, to unfurl again the great banner of the Lord, and bind all together in evangelical truth and apo tells order against God's food and ours, waiting in all patience and confidence for the coming of the Lord.
