[?] Our : correspondent writes : â€” Our friends in the Paddington Circuit have had a week of special prayer. The in clement weather severely tried their faith, but encouraged and stimulated by the promises of God, and their own blessed experiences of former success, they went on. The meetings were sea sons of great spiritual power and 'their fellowship was with much love and joy in the Holy Ghost. At the consecration meeting, on the Saturday night, a gracious manifestation of the Spirit's power and presence was realised and the workers renewed their consecration vows with agonising and effectual prayers, for an abundant blessing on the Church, and School. The Sunday ser vices were all good, but it was reserved to the teachers and officers of the school, in the presence and with the able assist ance of their Pastor, in the afternoon to witness a thorough break- down among the scholars. Upwards of forty of the scholars went forward to the penitent torm. What an inspiring sight ! It re minded us of former days when the dear children came trooping up and with tears of repentance and joy sought and found the Saviour Christ. Who, shall say what answers to prayer, such a man ifestation of G-od's converting grace reveals ! What a blessed assurance of divine favour it proved and in the strength of that minister and people prosecuted more vigorously their God ordained mission to the lost and ruined race. We hope to have further reports of this hope inspiring and soul-saving effort to extend the Redeemers King dom.
