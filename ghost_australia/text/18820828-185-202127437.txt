AN OUTSPOKEN PREACHER. The Kyneton Guardian records some of the incidents of revival mission of the Rev. John M'Neill, B.A. IN. his messago last evening Mr M'Neill said that he was sometimes asked whether it was sinful to attend quadrille, assemblies or., dancing classes. He was not going to say whether It was wrong or not, but his text told him that they should be sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,”- and have 11 the earnest of their inheritance ” within. He would, give a cheque for £5O if they could produce anyone who was filled with the Holy Ghost and yet attended dancing assemblies, li ft m»n bad the earnest of the inheritance with him,-and was full up of the Holy Ghost, it would take a very strong rope and a power _ful locomotive to drag him into a danciogroom where people went spinning round and round like eo many idiots, and it*' would be bell to him .until he could get out again.. The preacher also indulged in parable.. He represented the Lord as haring lost some of His flock, and as saying to the angel Gabriel^-* 1 Gabriel, just go down {to the world and see if you C4Q hunt them up.” Gabriel started on hU • mission, and reported, **Lord,’l hear the shiifflmg of feet in here," when the Lord replied, “Oh ! none of my flock could be found*there; that is a hallTecm.”3lr 31‘NeiIl concluded this illustration by expressing the hope that the Lerd* Would never.send Gabriel to look for him in a 'ball-room.
