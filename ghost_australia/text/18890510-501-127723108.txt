The Faust Family. The above talented company visited Coraki on Tuesday evening last. Owing to the heavy rain which fell all day and night Bridge-street, near the hall, was a perfect sea of water, and it was thought that no entertainment would be given. However, notwithstanding these drawbacks, the reputation borne by the Faust Family led a few to find their way to the hall, where an entertainment which pleased all was given. Of course the company were not seen to advantage, but enough was shown to assure us that they are one of the best we have had here. The programme was varied, and con- tained items of interest to everybody. It opened with the funny sketch "The Ghost in the woods," followed by the interesting per- formance by Master Victor and Little Daisy in their song and dance "We are Mashers." Herr Von Der Mehden then played in masterly style a selection on the cornet, and in response to an encore played "The last rose of summer," affording a treat such as we are seldom given. Martyn Haygan the Irish comedian kept the audience in good humour, and the French clowns in their comicalities with violins were really good, and require to be seen to be appreciated. Her Mehden played several well-known tunes on bottles, &c.;, much to the delight and sur- prise of his audience. The Risley performance was an exhibition of acrobatic skill such as we have never before witnessed here. The per- formance right through was one of the most interesting that has been given here, and it is to be regretted that the weather made it a matter of impossibility for many to witness it. The Company play at Woodburn to- morrow (Saturday) night, and we can recommend them as well worth seeing.
