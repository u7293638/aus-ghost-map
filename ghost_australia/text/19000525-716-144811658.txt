V: . \- BHisouie limalevolepf.. inspliation. membered having lieard thai., on . . this, very road; stood a- disused distillery, a favourite resting-place for tca^fiUers of myl description. Not far' ahead was ia Clump of pine trees, and behind tbem'jrose the outlines of an old chimney. I hurried towards the/place, plunging through a tangle of dusty ' weeds, and,.sure enough, : tberfi. stood the building dfiwhl-i I wjas . in' . search, its sagging roof and bursting ; walls green with age. There were two boles tipped in the root, stating deep and empty as ? the eyes, of a skull. _. I erawled under the door just in time. for. the next moment the rain came roaring down straight as ?melted lead. It must have been a dismal place at best. but now. under the thick sky and drumming rain-drops. it was particularly dispiriting.'' ' There were two room's on the lower floor with no visible iheans of communication but a ;w1de windows, set in the wall. The glass panes were unbroken, and the room be hind was perfectly dark. Connecting these rooms with the attic was a rickety staircase. The earthen floor was cover ed with a dant anesh of pale grass blades. I cowered * against the V jivyall while the storm boomed and crackled over my head, closing my eyes from time to time against theshock ofwhite fire that darted through the chinks and under the door. Presently, as I sat with my hot lids drawn down. 1 felt a startling, sense of some one looking at me : I turiiodonick J.v towards the window of which 1 have snoken. and there, pressed against the: dark glass, was a face, peering at me ?steadily. Oh. the horror of iha t face I for. as I looked, the outlines began to change and grow. like som-1 great colour less jelly— a soft, human jelly ooy/.ng and spreading across.the. p ines. 1 shut my eyes, and my heart; battered . my ribs. Again I looked^ siiil the face. wa-^ there,' only 'this time ihe shu-k mouth drew back in a sickening smile,, and it ran out Its blue tongue.' licking its loose lips quietly. 1 started 10 my feet with a cry. and as 1 did so the window began tc. sl'de up. - . I dropped to the floor weak with fear, and theeasli fell into -place aga-n. Then I realised that I must lie there, absolute ly still, for if I rose, the winnow rose, too— lie there and look, while that face leered at me from behind the glass. By-and-bv it began to move with a flaccid. gelatinous -swaying. I saw it bend over, and raise something from the floor, some thing that had been .a man. but now hung mute limply in its mouth'. It pressed the body against the window, laughing silently, and I saw— myself! Cod help me ! for the first rinse in this world I looked into my own face. Myown face did I say ? No. no ! ' S..nno bloated ani mal. purple. pimpled, with eyeballs ,«r. blood-slior that they seemed to be star ing through a web of ted lace. How long 1) ay there I cannot toll At last I moved, and my ha:id touched something cold : it was my bottle. the companion of my wanderings. I held It up. and saw that tliere was still a drop or two in it. 1 drained it to th' dress, and the glad tire warmed me and made me strong. At that moment rbe Th?hg began to raise its pallid, horrible feelers, twist ing them about the body it held, snap pmg the limits oft and dropping them, into its month, where the blue tongue caressed them hungrily. It had finished its meal, but ii stilt kept its vague eyes on me. and the;) 1 realised that I was moving, slipping quietly towards it ! I clutched at the rotting stops, aud their crutnlded to brown powder in ray hands. T'sronnd niy Sneers into the earth until there was a trail of Woody mud after me. Then I made one superhuman effort, dashed s; up the swajlng staircase, and broke in \- to the a trie. T slammed the door and threw myself against it, for I had seen that accursed window dart up with a crash as I leaped, nv.d I knew that the Thing would folb-w me. and. tearTme to pieces, aii.i plunge me iuto its niourh. and mash and mangle me between its tooth less sums ! The room where I found myself was dim and wet. Between the crack*? in the wall a flaming strip of sunset glowed like a for-ge in the twilight. Kvery btvatlf of Nature was hushed now. the rain came only in ioosely blown gusts, and the thunder had shud dered away into silence : my hair rose and my flesh grew rough and icy. for oh the stairway was a soft, ercakmjr sound, then a steady pushing against the door. -- I howled aloud in my anguish, and She sound of my .voice set the- place bel lowing with echoes. My arms were 'torn, and the bones nearly snapping .. from the pressure, and still I felt the ? ' door opening, opening ! There was a crunch— one rusty bliige dropped clattering to the floor, another and for a moment the door tottered and fell forward, nearly crushing me;. but, no, I was too quick, I was mad with fear. ,. One instant only- pe stood look ing at each ether, ^tie'- £W!ng framed In the empty door space, and I— a wild A ^east cfazed, with the fiercest race in .M teBrict : tiieri I plunged-' forward and out through a rent- in the torn boarding.

K my fe^ti and^eut rush ' Jng Hying down the empty road. , The wet bnsiies slapped* my face and cluiig. clammy as dead hands that woul^ have stopped my flight and all th? time I heard the Thing behind me— heard the plash of the paddles as it trailed through them and the beat of Its formless steps. ? - i The moon was rising across the road, fl great .swpllen .disk, ;j«apgniiie and j . .. tlireariening.. jl .remenibey cre^ scene : - tlie jerkj-,1._/.iGIftiDg..x-jc^' dark | spray of some hanging vine, and then pounding of iriV own steps.
