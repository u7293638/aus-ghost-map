Your father was a fool-a pitiful fool; a :d 0 n ou area fool Which would lead me, 1 E-.id I not know better, to believe that y.ur I mndfather. Amos Trenoweth, was a fool also. I should wrong him if I called him 5 'that. He was. a ,villain, a black- hearted,t \--rda.lroisa. cold-blooded, damnable villain ; aut he was only a tool' for once in hie life, i and that was whenhc trusted in the sense of hie deaendante.' 'lis voice, as he spoke of my grandfather, t ".BW suddenly shrill and discordant, while c f-sa eyes hlased up in furioua wrath.. In aI second or two, however, he calmen himself again and went on quietly as before. 'You wonder, percaps, why I call you af Sfoo It is because yo hve lived fr four- i teen years with your hand upon riches that would make a king jealous, and have never bad the sense tograsp them; it is because yon have ahut your eyes, when you might I .have seen, have been a begear when you , Sm?ght have ridden in a carriage. Upon moy I '.word, Mr. Jasper Trenoweth, when I thbnk of i "your olly I have halt a mind to be dog-sick Swith you myself.' What could the men mean? What was 'this clue which 1 had never found? ' And all the time it was written upon this I key here, as large as life: not only that, but, to leave you no excuse, Amos Trenowesh * actually told you that it:was written here.' * Whatdo you mean ! etammered I, forced into speech at last. SAh, so you have found your voice, have you ? What do I mean! Do yon mean to say you do not goes even now ? Upon my word I am loth to kill so fair a fool.' He regarded me for a moment with pitying contempt, then stretched out his hand and took up my grandfather's key. ..I read here,' he .said, ' written. very '-learly and distinctly, certain words, You mast know those words; but I will repeat them to you to refresh your memory 'Thy house is set upon the sands ; and thy I hopes by a dead man." ' ' Well!' I asked, for-fool that I was-even yet I did not understand. 'Mr. Jasper Trenoweth, did you never hear tell of such a place as Dead Man's Rock! The truth, the whole horrible certaiq t off it, struck me as one resat wave. and fiUb ed over my bent head as with she whirl and roar Etl men, water .

Dog I The tresulre that lies by Dead Man's Rock is treasure weighed wirth dead men's cores, and stained with dead men' i blood-wealth won by black piracy on the high seas- gold for which many a poor soul walked she plank and found his end in the deep waters. It is treuruesaked frommany a galUnt ship, stripped from many a rotting corpse by that black hornd, your grdad. father, Amos Trenoweth, Youguesaed that? Let me tell you more. : There i miany a soul cliny in' heaven snd hell for vengeance on your race; but your death to-night, Jasper Trenoweth, shall be the peouliar joy of one. Youguessed that your grandlather had crimes noon his soul ; hut you did not auee the blackest crime on his account-the murder of his t dearest friend. Listen. I wi be brief with ton. bul cannot spare myself the joy of eotting you know this much before you die. Know then, that when your grandfather was a rich man by this friend's aid- after, with h thi, friend's help. he had laid hand on the a secret of the Gease Ruby for waich for many t a year he had thirsted, io the moras. of big triumph, heturned and slew hat friendy in order to keep the Ruby to himself. 'That fool, your arther, kept a Journal which, no doubt, you have read overe od over again. Did he tell you how I caught him on Adam's Peak, sitting with this Clasp in his hands before a hideous graven stone ? That stone was cut in ghsly mockery of that friend's face; the hones that lay be. t neath it were the bones of that friend. Tuere, i on that very spoot where. I met your father, face to face, did his father, Am's t'renowetb,r !taike down my father, Ralph Coliver. ii 'Ab, light is begining to dawn on your silly brain at lust Yes, pretending to pro tect the old priest, who bead the Ruby. he etabbed my father with the very knife found in your father's bears, stabbed him before his wife's eryes oan that little lawn upon the7 mountain side ; and, when my helpless moahdr called vengeance upon him, handed the still reeking knife to her and bade her t do her wont. Ah, but she kept that knife. Did you mark what was engraved upon the blade ? That knife had a good memory, Mr., Jaseer Trenoweth. 'Let me go on. A. if that deed were not foul enough, he caused the old priest to carve-being skilful with the chitel-that I vile distortion of his dead friend's face oa of a huge boulder lying by, and then murdered him too for the Rbr'a take, and tumbled their bodies into the trough together. Such was Amon Trenoweth. Are you proud of your descent? ' I never saw my father. I was not born ' until three months after this, and not until Swas tea years old did my mother tell me of his fate. 'Your grandfather was a fool, Jasper Tre. noweth, to despise her; for she was yoaung then and she could wait. She was beauntiful then and Amor Trenoweth himself had loves her. What is she now? Speak, for you have seen her.' As he spoke I seemed ti see again that yellow face, thoese awful, soulless eyes, and hear her laugh as she gaed down from the boxr upon my dying love. 'Ab, beauty goes. It went for ever on that day when Amos Trenoweth esptin her face and taunted betas she along to the body 1 of her husband. Beauty goes, but revenge can wait; to',-t0-te bhas oomas;a miahe a th:usand dead men's ghosts shall he glad. sad point at your body as it goa tossing out to sea. Tonight-but let me tell the rest In a word or two, for timepressee. orwI was brought up, how my mad m-other-for she is mad on every point bau one-trained me to I she sea, how I[left rat length and became an attorney's clerk, all this I need no;t dwell upon. But all this time the thought of revenge never l-ft me for an hour; and if iit bad, my mother would have recalled it. ' Well, we settled in Plymouth, and I was bound a clerk to your graudfather's attorney, still with the same purpo.e. There I lecrnut of Amos Trenoweth's affRies but only to a certain extent ; for of the wealth which he t had so bloodily won I could iscover nothing. sad yet I knew that he possessed riches which make the heart fain' even to think i upon. Yet for all I could discover, hie pse- I sessions were simply those of a struggling farmer, his business abeolu'ely nothrbing. I was almost desperate, when one day a tU, il gaunt and aged man stepped into the office. , asked for my employer, sad gave the name ofc Amos Trenowethb. Ob. hoe Ilonmed to kil i him as he stood theyr I And how little did bhe guess that the clerk of whom he took no more notice than of a astone, would oae day strike his deecendante off the fae of the e*rth and inherit the wealth for which he had sold his soul-the great Ruby of Ceylon ! SMy voice trembled with hate as I an- I noonced him and showed him into the inner room. Then I closed the door and listened. He was uneasy abaut his widl-the tool- and did not know has all his possessions would neocasarily becime bro eon's. In my heart I laughed at his ignorance; but I learnt enough-enough to wait ptioently frye.rs, and tinally to track Ezekidi Trenoweth to his death. ' It wa about this time that I fell in love. In this as in everythlngthrough life I have been cursed with the toulest lock ;: but in this as in everything else my patience has won in the end. Laucy Luttrell loved another man called Railton-John Railson. He was another fool-yon are all fools--t abe h married him and had a daugoter I wonder if onu can guaes who that daughter was ' Be broke off and looked at me with fiendish ma?lee. 'You heaund I' I cried.' * she was Janet Rtailton--Clire Luttrell; and you murdereÂ·d her father as you say Amos Trenoweth murdered yours.* Right.' he answered, coolly. Quite right. Oh, the ats by whIch I enticed that, man to drink and then to crime I Even now I-could sit and laugh over ahem by thehoar. Why, man, tibse was not a touch of guleSi r thei fllow when I soak him in hand, ran' yet it was he that afterwards took roar father's life. He tried it oce in Bombsy ansd bangled it sa?ly ; he did it nealy enough, 1 'hough, on the jibboom of the Balle Fortune. Ilent him the knisfe; I would have dne it: myself,. bat Railton was nearer; and besides a it is alwayse better to be a witness.' ., What was that ruotling sound behind the I partition ? Colliver did na t hear it, at any I rate, bhot went on with his tale, add thougnh is eyes were dancing flames of hate his oire was cslm now as ever. 'I had stolen half tshe Clasp beforehand from th- cabin floor where that stupendoeus idiot, Ezekiel trenoweth, had dropped it. Railvon taught him before he dropped, but I did not know he had time to get tbhe box away, for just then shoe wrve broke over a us, and before the next we both jufmpe for she Rock I harhtuthat Rallt,., must have been euacke~L back, for I only olair on myself 'y thie luck'e.a chance. o whor pitob dark and impossible to see.

Then as I con-. tinued to cell and shout. struck me one f, fearful blow beaind the ear. I remember r, that thb dim lamp shot out a streak of blood- I1 red flame, the cabin war lit for one brief a instaut with a flash of fire, a thousand lights a darted ont, and then-then came utter black- f, ness-a vague sensation of being caught up p and carried, of plunging down-down.

So distanl did they seem that my eys opened with vague expectation of aothe world ; opened and then wearily cloeed agaie. I For at first they etared into a heaven of duel grey, with but a shadow between them i and celonrlese spare. Then they opened ii once more, and then the shadow caught their attention. What was it?

' Oh, if he I would but speak I' I This time I saw more distinctly. Two s eyes were looking into mine-a woman's g ares. Where had I seen that face before? g Surely I had known it once in some other world. Then somehow over my weary mind o stole the knowledge that this was Mrs. r Lastrell-or was it Claire No, Claire was t dead. ' Ul.ire dead !' I seemed to repeat to myself; but how dead or wnere I could not recall.

I raised myself on my elbow.- My brain was tbr,bbing intolerably, and every paul- o tion seemed to shoot fire into my temples. Also other' bands of firs were clasped about n my arms and wrists. So acutely did they I burn that I fell back with a low moean and looked helplessly at Mrs. LuttrelL o Alshoneh it had been anowing, her bonrer a was thrust back rom her face and hung by a its ribbons which were tied beneath her chin.

The shop was closed, and above it hung three b bras balls, each covered now with a seowva cap. Above, the blinds were drawn down, ut on looking again, I saw a chink of light between the shuttsrs,-I knocked. After a short pause, the door was opened. A red.eyed, villainoeus face peered out, and p seeing me, grew blank with wonder. ' What do you want ?' inquired at lenglh the voice belonging to it, 'To buy r fresh soit of clothes. See,ll I have fallen into the river.' Muttering something beneath his breath, the pawnbroker opened his door. and let me into the shop. n It was a dingy nest, fitted up with the usual I furniture of such a place. The one dim 0 candle threw a ghostlrlight on chairs. clocks, compasses, trinkets, saucepans, watchee, d pilse of china, and suat of left-off clothes arrayed like rows of suicides Idong the wall. A general air of decay hung over the den. b Immediately opposite me, a I entered, a stuffed parrot, dropping slowly into dulstL glared at me wish one malevolent eye of b glnas, while a hideous Chinese idol, behind the counter, poked out his tongue in a frenzy t of malignity. But my eye wandered put c these, and was fixed in a moment upon some. thing that glitteaed upon the oounter. That something was my own watch. Fol:oI?lg my gaze, the man gave me a quick, sospicious glance, hastily caught up toe watch, and was bestowing it on one of i shbelves, when I said- 'Where did you get that?' h 'Qese ts.ea?

I thought it was hi. so d the. if yos belong to the Force I hope--' "Gently, my friend," said I ; ' am not c in the police, so youea need not be in such a fright. Neverthles, that watch is miane ; I can tell you the number, if you don'td believe it.' He pushed the watch acroes to me. and a said. still greatly frllghtened- h 'l oam sureyou may ee it, sir, with att my i heart. I wouldn't for worlds-' What did you give for it? p He hesitrated a momant, and then, as greed overmastered fear, replied 'Fifteen pounds, sir and the man would not take a peony lers. Fifteen good pounds I I swerrit, as Iam alive!' Alth,,ugh I saw that the man lied, I drew out three five-pound notes, laid them on the e table, and took my watch. This done, I s?id--. 'Now I want you to sell me a suit of i clothes, and aid me. to disguise myeel It Oherwiee--' 'Don't talk, sir, about "otherwislle."
