The deceased lady who was well and fvorably known throughout the whole of this district had been ailing for some time past, and had removed to Melbourne about a week ago to place herself under the care of two physicians there. Instead of improving however, she rapidly grew worse, and a wire yesterday announced to her anxious relatives her demise. Her body was to be conveyed ton Gl-nsroeaa''-s.t..-tha and thdefuheral'is ected'to take place to-day, probably at Tallarook.l WATEa SurPLy-The movement recently set on foot to promote the blessing of a water supply for Broadfordl is beginning to take a practical shape. A petition has been drawn up under the superintendance of Mr John MecLeish, to be presented to the Shlre Council at its next meet ing praying that body to take steps to form a Water Trust. Meanwhile the petition is going round the town, and the names of householders and others willing to practically support a rational scheme are being generally affixed. This is a step in the right directiion and residents will be wise in seizing the oppor tunity of expressing a definite opinion in the matter, for it is absolutely certain that unless they bestir themselves individually the water supply will never come. POPULAR CONCERT-On the 1Sth inst Mr. Cooke, of Seymour, purposes giving the in habitants of Broadford a treat in the way of a grand concert and variety entertainment. For the last to years Mr Cooke has gained a big reputation for the splendid concerts he has organised, and like his namesakes, Messrs T. Cooke and Son, he spares no ex pense to give the public the best value for their money. For the present occasion a number of the leading Melbourne artists have been engaged, besides the best of Seymour and Nagambie's talent. Mr Cooke intends placing the net receipts to the funds of the Broadford Brass Band, and this, apart from the musical treat that may be anticipated, should insure a large attendance. For fur ther particulars refer to advertisement in fourth page ACCIDENT-A severe bnkgy accident hap" pened last Thursday to Mrs Good wife of Mr G. B. Good, of the 'Advertiser,' says a con temporary. Mrs Good hal been out driving. and when at Carlshbrg, theresidence of Mr C. P. HIobson, she was leading the horse to wards a fence, when the hood of the buggy caught in a wire clothes line. The horse became restive and plunged forward,the wire line recoiling around Mrs Good's neck and throwing her to the gronund. The horse only went a few yards, and collided with a gate, overturning the buggy and nmashingagood portion of it. Mrs. Good was found to be suffering from a severe shock, and had sus taired some nasty cuts about the head and fare, while the wire had cut into the flesh arnond her neck. Medical assistance was soon at hand, and the sufferer is improving rapidly. MAnter PeonucE-On Monday nearly sooo sheep were trucked at Broadford rail wav station by local owners, en route for Melbonrne. The consignments were : Mr. A. Ricnards, 123 ; Mr. Elworthy, 3So; D.

Tan poison used is the phosporised wheat, which has been skilfnlly placed on upturned soil about fresh ploonh furrows in small quantities to be devrnred greedily during the night by the unsuspecting bunny. In some places the ' Jam and Apple' treatment has been in voge. hbut those who have tried both methods speak in enlogistie terms of the grain seed. In a conversation with the Rabbit Inspector we were informed that several landholders were enonsidered to be rather remiss in earry. ing out the instruetions and that measures are to he taken to enforce these to comply with the terms of the Art. It i t be hoped 1 the wisdom and the evident advantags of united and simultan*o.s action may present itself to our farmers as a duty in dealing with this thresatnine peat and preelude the neres. stes of any compulsory action beine taken. Tlorn is really very little to ennurasee one man to spend his time and money in attempt ing to re~nee this pest if his neighbour whose ground:msy he equally infested takes no steps to reduce it in his too. SUonca Cnuex Ceunch-The worship. I pers attending the Sunday Creek Wesleyan ( Church celebrated the anniversary of their cause on Friday with every indication of complete success.

The Rev. Mr. Tuckfieldl, or ( Melborone had been advertised to address the meeting on " The wonders of the Micro. I scope" bnt finding himself unable to he I present. the Rev. Mf. Powell came in his I stead and proved an admirable suhbstiltte hr I delivering an entertaining lecture on "From i Mlbhourne to Jernsalem in an hour and a J half." The Reverend gentleman who des- 3 crihbed in a striking manner the many in. a 'idents. sights and experiences of so interes- d ting a journey wasen listened with rapt ntten-. I tion the onlty unpleasant feeling being the I tnnonncement that it was found necessaryv to bring it to a premature close. A hearty I vote of thanks to Mr. Povell for his kindness 1 was heartily carried, being moved ly Mr. r lutrgess who referred in eulogistic terms to I the band of wnrkers.-including Mesdames Baker and Lade and the Misses Trenowith I (of Kilmore) to whose thoughtful energy asI the working committee the evenings success I was largely due. One ohiect of the meeting was to raise a sum in aid of the circuit fund ( and during the evenin. it was announced I that altogether nearly Lio had been collc ted. l
