The rent was remark ably moderate, and tho rooms woro com- , fortablc. Accordingly a young barris ter took them for a month or so. IIo never inquired why it was that thoy had boon so long ompty, nor had he any idea that thoy' woro supposed to ho haunted. . He had not, howover, boon in possession many days boforo ho an nounced his determination, to quit tho rooms, though ho had spent a good deal of money in doing thorn up an 1 furnish ing them.' His friends naturnllly asked for an explanation, nnd he confessed that he had soon a ghost, or rather, a collection of ghosts, for every night, ho said, tho door opened of its own nccord, and in walked three men and a woman, dressed in last century costumes. Thoy sat down at tho tablo, and commenced to talk nnd to drink. Eventually the talk sot louder nnd n violent quarrol broke out, in. the course of which tho woman was stabbed.
