CABLE MESSAGES. [By Submarine Telegraph.] [Received between 8.42 and 10.4G a.m on Wednesday.] BUYING A GHOST. An Enthusiastic Antiparian A Flaw in History. London, April 17. Mr. Hall, a gentleman who takes a deep -interest in antiquarian researches, re cently purchased from the Earl of Abing don a property on which stood what were supposed to be the ruins of Cumnor Place, j Berkshire, his object being to acquire the building which served as the prison of Amy Robsart, and which according to tradition' is haunted by her ghost. J He is now appealing to the law courts to rescind the purchase owing to an allega-1 ticn that there is no historical ground for the assertion that the ruins are those of Cumnor Place. In 1550 Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, married Amy, daughter of Sir John Robsart. She lived in the country and early inl560removed to Cumnor Place, Berkshire, the house of Anthony Forster, a creature of her husband, where on Sep tember 8 she was found laying dead, with her neck broken, at the foot of a staircase. It was generally believed at the time that she was murdered and that Dudley, if not Queen Elizabeth herself, was an accessory to the crime, i This belief receives support from cer tain discoveries made in the archives at Simancas which indicate that a plot to poison her was actually entered into before her death.
