$0*r# i&ovntY;* HOERIBLE THINGS. / . . . BY THE AUTHOR OF TUB ' COURSE 07 TIME.' Heard ye ever the fiend of the wave Growl doleful along the dark shore f Heard ye ever a groan from the grave, Or the murdered child shriek in its gore f Heard ye ever despair deeply sigh, When hope flitted far from his sight? Heard ye ever the traveller's cry,. When beset by assassins of night ? Heard ye ever the sprite of the blast Wail through the sad mansions of death I Heard ye ever a wretched outcast Blaspheme with his Ia6t gasping breath? Heard ye ever the cold clod of dust, Crumble down on the coffin low laid ? Heard ye ever the life-seeking thrust Of the murderer's blood-glutted blade ? Heard ye ever the long thunder-clap Bellow through the dark womb of the night ?' Heard ye ever the death- warning rap, Or bell tolling without mortal might? Heard ye ever the ghost of the north Howl loud from the mountain's dark side ? Heard ye ever the gore gurgle forth From the throat of the wild suicide ? Heard ye ever the maniac's yell, Or the clank of the strong iron rings ? Heard ye ever a groan from deep hell ; If go â€” ye have heard most horrible things.
