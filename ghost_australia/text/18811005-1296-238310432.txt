A VICTIM TO INTEMPERANCE. On the 26th September last, a man named An- gus McDonald Stewart a tailor, appeared in cus- tody at the Water Police Court on a charge of " being a person deemed to be insane," who had been discovered under circumstances that denoted a purpose of committing some offence against the law. The information which led to his arrest was laid by J. E. Ambler, proprietor of the West Coast Hotel, Kent-street, Constable Manion deposed to having taken the prisoner into custody on the day above stated, when he was apparently suffering from the effects of drink. Told him he was being taken for his own protection. James Exley Am- bler in his evidence before the Court, stated that the prisoner had been lodging at his house three weeks, that he had during that time been drinking heavily, having occasionally procured liquor at other places than the Hotel where he was staying. Unless the prisoner was restrained, he, Mr. Ambler, believed he would do himself some injury. The accused, he said, was in the habit of getting up in the night, and declaring that he saw ghosts and other horrible things. He came from Back Creek, and was a traveller for the firm of Messrs. Hutchinson and Son. Dr. Wright had attended him recently, and had pronounced him to be insane. On this evidence the Bench remanded the accused until the following day, when, as he was not in a fit state to appear, he was again "remanded for a week. Yesterday the Court was officially informed that the unfortunate man, whilst in a state of insanity, had died in the gaol on the 1st instant.
