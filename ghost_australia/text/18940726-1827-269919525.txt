THE STORYTELLER. ft^ME.ftftMAifftft®?; By Mohlky Rojieuts. r was-sitting one morning outside Shanghai ;.:Bro\vn's;-T3pai^iHgy:']i6use'--'i£;' Battery. Street,:,' Sail" Francisco, when (he runner came to me and said I must go to' the shipping office at once, as he had; a ship for me, and : she. was going, to sign that very' day. ,.It was, in the Tvoi'ds of the sailors' shaiitv, "John gut up and Jack sit. down," for my moniy was clean done by their reckoning, -which 1 knew wouldn't bear inspection. But when a . seaman falls intb: She clutches of an American -lifevlaiasitb^-ao-as' lie is .told," unless he.has; any. sort of wild yearning. to be battered out of the shape of a man by a crowd of professional bullies they , always, keep 011 hand for such jobs. So up I got, knowing it was a case, though I had been promise;! a job' on the coast, and this was a deep waterman. -The. vessel .was a barque, of about SOp'toijSj-eallea-the.-iRingdOT White, bound for Manilla in ballast for a cargo of sugar,, and it. was.cortainly better , than going round the Horn as f had reckoned they would send me. So I took my dunnage, and made up my mind to be as contented as possible, and to take care when 1. got back to let no more boarding-house masters put their claws into my hair and hide again. The crew of the Ringdove consisted of eight able seamen, beside the. usual crowd of idlers, that is, the cook and the steward, who were Chinamen, and the carpenter. We carried no bos'11, for the second mate shipped as bos'n as well. That same evening we went on board and at dawn hove up the anchor and got under way. When we crossed the bar, we let go the tug, and were soon bowling away under all sail for Manilla. My shipmates were not a bad lot of men to get along with, and the captain and mates did not appear to be of the usual bull-dozing, hazing set that most American officers are. But when we M ere a few days out we soon, began to see that the skipper was addicted to drink, just as many masters are; for, though they must huve a character for sobriety to pass as suck, after they have their tickets and are at sea,, there is nothing to control them.' But, apart from this failing, there was not much wrong with the old man, and it did not matter-to-us forward, though, of course, it put more work and responsibility on the other officers. What soon concerned us in the forc'sle was that one of our shipmates turned out to be something not a. little awkward, and tliis was Joe Simms, who had been in the Navy. He was a strong, thin man of nearly fifty, with very black hair, and deepset black eyes; and he was uncommonly strong and well up to doing a hundred little things about the ship; especially in the way of ornament, that few of us knew. But like other old Navy bands he did not care very much for, real work. They can. always have two men. . fclieve-to ccLvry. a smvtehljloel:, ond'tbey are apt to take it very easy when they can. Like old men o' warsmen, too, he was as full of yarns as a bolt rope, and he spun us real caulkers—some, as I iob Silver sjiid, which took , a double Spanish burton with the fall to a-steamwinch to hoist into any man; for he knew all about the Navy, and we next to nothing. So he had a fair/chance. But if we ever drew any doubt on his twisters, though-.they mig1it;be Pbviou's: lies, he would just,shut, up.like a jackknife and retire to a quiet spot, where he would stay muttering to himself for hours together. There was something very strange about him over and above this. ' ft'.'ft' ; ; ftft;'- Being in the starboard ;wa|fcch, r while Joe. was in the port, I had hotneitie'eid. his tricks so much, but one.night, : onbeing relieved from-the wheel at four bells in the middle watch, Bob Silver stopped me at the main fife rail as I was going forward. , " Don't, go down, just yet, -Jack; I- want to have a ..yarn with you about something," he said. - - ft'-;-.-" " Wait, till I fill my pipe, Bob," 1 answered, " aiid, then you can yarn for, the rest of the watch, i£ you like." So I went below and got. my pipe and tobacco. When I got back, Bob was seatedin; thd:maiii : ili;atcH, and'.I^sat down by him. '.- ''•.; .ftftftft :->!•'-.;.! " Now, fire away, old man, I am listening." ft. ^ -'r"'-' ~ 'A'. ft, " Before I begin,":said lie, "I want t you to go into the forc'sle again, and j see if Simms .is. asleep or not." "' ft' - - - " What the thunder for 1 He a couldn't hear us here if lie were as t wide awake as a cat by a rat hole." r "." Never you wind," I10 replied obstinately, •' that's not what I was . thinking about. •' You go." •;. _ And to satisfy him I. went. 1 -found • Siiinns. wide awake got back Silver caughtjr.. _ "J^o, old man, and-what's more, lie never i? \- " That's tommy rot, Bob. The man must slcrp sometime." "Most men must," whispered lie, starihgiat me,- " but T have watched him for a. week, and lie never closes his eyes I am suie of it " I did not quite know what to think, foi" it' per.tainly was very, strange. =aricl uncanny- for- a man', who 'looked' .as lioaltliy as-Joe to get', on w-ithout ahy rest.. I turned to Silver and: looked at him "Yes Jack," said Silver'queeily, "mad, by heavens That's it suie enough You watch him lyhen'I'm attke wheel sometime, and you'll see I speak tlie Uuth I don't']"! e lieiftg in the hip with him J The fellow 111 the other watch have nicknamedUnm Snakes for some rea on, and I tell you.

Yet in'this case, it couldn't be helped. • As it turned out, perhaps it was as well : ; for in spite of the horrible warning; of. the old man's death, the new captain began to go on the same : course, only not so fast at.first,; and in consequence I soon had to -navigate', the'-. vessel myself^. 'And tlien there came more trouble. I; ft;',; : v Spmel.te^ Captain "While into. s«ij when itwas a dead calm, and just before six bells driVthe'I'first. '.watch, I. heard. the sound of someone running along t.lie decks with bare feet. Then there: was; a scream from the forc'sle head and a splash in the water. Silver was at the wlifeel,: and :I I was "standing aV few feet from him. • It's Snakes, it's Snakes,'' said Bob, and I coiild hieai 1 terror 'in his voice ; ''there's murder .going on. I kuew this ; I was afraid of it." And thiiikiiLg there must 'be something in what he said, I jumped down into the cabin for a revolver, at the. same time shouting to the captaiii aiid' Mr. Jackson to rouse Put. In another moment Jackson was on deck Willi his -pistol,- but-the- skipper was asleep, drunk, and did not stir. : When I got up the "companion I found the two men of the . watch! (for now the carpenter, stood his watch) aft in the pcop, looking very ..pale., and scared as they stood by the" wheel with the light from the binnacle shining on their faces. " What's up ?" I cried, " I will know." The .carpenter answered : . : " We heard a screech on the forc'sle just now, sir,-and ongoing to see, we found no one there. The lookout man \vas gone. There was 110 one about the decks, but the door of the port forc'sle is shut, and someone is groaning inside. ' "Let's go forrard," said I; "take axes from the rack at the mizzen and look smart." „ •I Just as I came down on the quarter deck, tlie sky, which hail, been over-: cast,began to clear,. and • through .-a. rift, the full 1110011 sent down a flood bf light thatftlmade everything about the decks as clearly "visible-ais On day-; tiiiiie, .•'.except'" where; there"-Svere'" ;! sliaft , i dows. .Wo went very carefully/but saw no tiling, and . \ylien we ,came- to. itiie-.;{oTc'slo : door, it '.v as shut svrvd locked • !'Bru.akit.open," I said, .and;.jumpfed' upon the topgallant forc'sle'while i.hey. were at it.
