CHAPTER I.. Two Lovers. , to The young editor of the "Invernish Observer" had become quite a known personage in the town ; the railway porters touched their caps to him ; the station-master^obliging as ever, hurried to see if he could and a compartment for him and so he set forth. Little indeed of that journey could he after wards recall. He must have looked out on the lapping waters of the Cromarty Firth and on the wider sea-range vp Dornoch way-and on the wooded heights by the Kyle of Sutherland ; he must have seen them, no doubt and yet without seeing them. He had come upon the strangest errand ever under- taken by mortal man. He could not shape his thoughts about it; it was too difficult. Besides that his brain was tortured by a recurrent phrase : " I ask for your pardon I ask for your pardon." That she-she-the beautiful clear Bouled one-that she should be piteously asking pardon of all mankind-she who had never a thought of harm for any Sulman creature, but quite the other t tray; she who wished to do well to everyone who was benignant and generous, and kind to all around her-but especially if you happened to be poor or abashed-or unfitted for our notice ; this was a bewildering thing. The proud and radiant young lass ; why should she have become so humble ; why should she beg for forgiveness from all the world ? Well, it was not much of that journey that in after days 'Archie Gilchrist could bring back to his mind. The evenings were drawing in now ; he resolved to pass the night at Lairg, Instead of driving on through the dark to Alt-na-Traive ; indeed, he was not in a hurry ; he knew he had to formu- j late certain things in his own mind before the object of his mission could be j accomplished and a few sleepless hours would serve. At dinner, in the coffee-room. he was so fortunate as to make the acquaintance of two clergy- men who proved to be of a most genial temperament ; they beguiled the solitude (for they and he were the only guests, the tourist season being quite over they beguiled their enforced soil \- rude with many merry tales and recitals of extraordinary experiences; chiefly connected with trolling for salmon from ; nor did they monotonously confine themselves to fishing ; nor were they very strait-laced about their papers for example, when one of them told the story of a Scotch elder who said to his Minister " No, no, Minister, ye needn't warn me against the since sweeping' ; it's a bad thing, sweetly' I dinna sweet I wouldn't swear ; but sometimes I've been damned near Stanwell. Gilchrist could only piously hope that the fable was new-perhaps it was even true. Then, when the brothers of the Church had retired to the smoking room, he went outside. There was a full moon, clear in the cloudless heavens ; but also there were intervening trees, stirred by a light northerly wind ; so that the swaying branches cut the luminous circle into multitudinous jagged and dazzling stars and planets that shone and scintillated suddenly here and there through the thick dark foliage. He would have liked Wild Eelin to have described this thing, is one of her dis- cursive, frolicsome, but minutely ob- servant papers. Then he walked down to the side of the lake. It was a great breadth of mystic gray, with successive promon- tories, black as jet, appearing at re- ceding distances ; until, in the extreme west, the moonlight caught a bay of calm, and there was a bold scimitar sweep of silver under the larchwoods and the spectral hills. If only Eelin could have seen it. to write about it, and make it for ever vivid ! He walked along to the weir, and stood and listened to the half-hushed hurrying voice, and he tried to make out if this or that one of Berlin's songs anyone of them brave and valiant, or pitiful with the misery of bygone unhappy folk could be heard through the confused nocturnal accompaniment He stood and listened and listened, and tried to detect the sound of her voice, as often he had heard it was it " Logie o' Buchan, O Logie the land, they are taken away Jamie that delved in the yard or was it "The auld" Stuarts back again or was it something about "Glen- and Dunoon, and Loch Striven J's vor she had become afraid of "The Brees of Glenbraon"-and "Kirkconnell Lea" was too suggestive of the grave. Ah. It was not "And you take the high road, and I'll take the large, and Til be in Scotland before ye, But me and my true love will never meet again-" He stood and listened and tried to make out the faint echo of Eelin's voice ; but he quite failed. It was the water-kelpie's voice that answered him and that only said "Edin and "Edin and "Eelin" in tones of unutterable sadness and fare- well. For. indeed, his senses had got somewhat distracted ; It was the one love of his life he was thinking of-the impetuous, splendid young creature that for a while he somehow seemed to have gained for himself and to-morrow he was going to give her away to another man. Next morning broke fine and still, with hoar frost that is to say, under the long-stretching shadows of the shrubs the grass was of a cold gray, but out in the open, where the sunlight fell, it was of a warm golden-green, the innumerable tiny spears glittering with diamonds of orange and dancing blue. He had ordered a waggonette to be waiting for him when he went to the H hotel door he did not notice that for a second the driver glanced at him, or rather at his costume, in an odd sort of way. He took his place, and told the man to go on. "It's rather cold this morning," he said, in a perfunctory fashion. " Ay, sir, it is that," replied the driver, of and it will be colder when we get up to Creek, for the wind's off the hills." And so they left the pleasant neighbourhood of Loch Shin was its islands, and yellow promontories, and its planta- tions all basking in the sure, and by- and- by they emerged upon the vast and tere moorland, that sow had a touch of snow on it Nay, as they got up to the higher altitudes, the great expanse became of a solid white-a. white as solid as the shoulders of Ben Armin, that seemed to reign over this desolate and spent realm. Here and there a robust cramp of heather had shaken itself free, and stood black-brown on the edge of a knoll ; but small iaditidgalj:eatores of that kind did not interfere with the general character of the landscape, that seemed to have hushed itself to sleep, under a spotless shroud. There was not a whir of a bird's wing is all the voice- less waste. And so the horses toiled on up the lonely Strath Terry, with Ben Clebrig showing himself against the northern skies and Gilchrist was lost in sombre meditation, until a remark from the driver startled him out of his reverie. " They're coming, sir," the man said. " Who are coming ?" " The funeral." He looked along the road, or the faint indications of a road, and far away ' he saw a small black procession- the finest black dot it was-coming into the spacious, white, solitary world. " But whose funeral ?" he asked again. "Mr Macdonald, that was at Altona Traive." the man answered, in obvious astonishment "The old gentleman was you not hearing of it, sir ?" " Why did they not tell me at Lairg as'. Gilchrist demanded. " " We thought it was for the funeral you came through, sir and no one would be liking to speak to you about it Will I go off the road Terror Highland-1 ers do not care to meet a funeral. I " No, no," Gilchrist responded sharply. " Keep to the road ; but when the funeral comes up. then you can give them plenty of room to go by and if Mr. Somerled -Macdonald wishes to speak to me, he can either do that or pass on just what he chooses." The tiny black procession coming into the white moorland consisted merely of the hearse and one mourning carriage, and the mourning carriage had but one occupant When he saw that this was Archie Gilchrist whom he had encountered, Somerled Macdonald ordered the drivers to stop, and Gilchrist got down and went across. "This is very sad and sudden," he said. " Well, not so sudden," Somerled answered. "I had been warned by the doctor. And not so sad, either. He died full of years and honour, and the greatest honour conferred upon him was the kindness of the ladies of Khiva it He had no expectation of any such thing when we came to this country oh, no, none-for he was not a presuming man and their reception of him and their continued friendliness towards him became the crowning joy of his life. Well, both mother and daughter will find that he has not been ungrateful. Miss Bella will find she has not been forgotten. But I am detaining you. and it is cold up here. You are going on to Alt-na-Traive ?" " Xo," Gilchrist answered, in great embarrassment. " My mission was to see you but in these circumstances-" " How can anything be altered ?" Somerled Macdonald said, in his direct ' fashion. " If you are going back to Lairg, take a seat in this carriage, and let your waggonette follow. Then you can tell me at your leisure." ' Gilchrist accepted the suggestion-and yet with some apology. " If I had known." he said, as they continued on their way, " I should have ! come in proper clothes. But there was no intimation of any kind--" " No," said his companion, " I will ar- range about the newspaper announcements when I get to Inverness it will be more certain there than writing from ยก a remote hamlet like Alt-na-Traive. Still. I wonder you have not heard-for I sent a note to Glengarra House" At Glengarva House." Gilchrist said. slowly. I do not think they are opening letters just now." The strong, refined features of the other man grew suddenly ashen gray. " What is that you mean ?" he said at once. And then Gilchrist told him all the tale that be had in a kind of way pre pared and arranged in sequence and i he went on to defend his own position I and why he had come on this journey j not knowing of the funeral. For a while Somerled Macdonald sate silent. The clear, brown, contemplative eyes looked troubled ; there was no other sign. AT length he said " What the doctor told you about her splendid constitution is everything : clearly that is what he relies upon and when she has pulled through, and become her natural self again, it will be time enough to talk about me. No ; there will be no talk about me. People in delirium take wild fancies and all these rambling references to the Castle Hill and Ben Wyvis mean-just nothing at all" Gilchrist shook his head, " You may think what you like," he said, "but I know. The story she told me mistaking me for yon-was too consecutive. The secret she had kept hidden was no longer a secret, when she thought she was talking to you.' And then after a while Some red Macdonald said: " Why did you come to tell me all this-you who are engaged to be married to her ?" " I could have concealed it no doubt," Gilchrist answered calmly. "And probably when the fever goes, she may have forgotten that she made these re- velations. And she would keep her promise to me : I am certain of that yes, I am certain of that But then, I should be a dishonoured man. And it is not for Esther Macdonald to pass her life with a dishonoured man." ' " You are making a great sacrifice," said the other absently. " Only only how can one trust to what is said in delirium ?" "I do not ask you," Gilchrist answered. " But when she is quite out of this illness, you must go to her and you must tell her from me that she is free yes. yes, quite free to choose I wherever her wish may fall-and then you may believe the story she confided to me when I was carrying her from the Islands to Glengarra House. And she will have no difficulty in understanding why you should present yourself before her. Well she knew what the thousand pounds meant" " The thousand pounds !" said Somer- led Macdonald. " The thousand pounds ! When I would have the skin of both my hands played to make a lacing-string for her shoe !" And so they went on through the wide, white, silent wilderness until they reached Lairg station, where the coffin was transferred, while they passed on to one of the usual compartments. They were pretending to talk about ordinary things about the green of the first show ing through the snow about the removal of the nets from the Kyle- of Sutherland-about the letting of Lang well Lodge-and so forth ; but perhaps their thoughts were elsewhere. Archie Gilchrist, for example, was conscious that In due time they would get down to Dingwall; and he knew. silver-haired came there who now would probably never see Eelin Macdonald, and never understand how near he had been to winning for himself the proud eyed, proud-stepping, daughter of the House of Kinvaig. When they arrived at Inverness there was another necessarily tedious transference of the coffin, and Archie Gilchrist would have had his companion drive out with him to hear the latest tidings of the poor invalid. But Macdonald declined. " -No," he said, " until I have seen my father laid in that small churchyard in Glengarva, I must do nothing else. And indeed," he added, with some delicacy, j " I was wondering whether you might I not have gone on with me-" , .' And I was thinking of it. too," said Gilchrist, " for I know it is just what Eelin herself would wish. Only, I must get news of her and I will jump into a cab. and see if I can intercept the doctor anywhere and then I will go home for a couple of seconds to get into proper clothes and I shall be back here before you are ready to start. And meanwhile you must get something to eat : it's a long way to Glengarva and there is the Station Hotel if you go into the coffee-room. I shall join you in a few minutes-" In a very short time he was back ; the subdued gladness of his face was its own report. Somerled Macdonald held out his hand, and it was grasped. " It is well," Someried said (with the grave eyes 'burning), "I can see it is well." " Yes, yes. said the other, " the news is good. But I could not find the doctor; I chanced to come across the night nurse, who was out for her usual walk and she thought that Miss Eelin was going on first-rate, in spite of the tremendous trial. Oh, yes. her tone was confident, if it was cautious and I think that some of us may yet hear Eelin Macdonald and" 2 The Blues of Glenbraon' no. no, not that one-she seemed to have a fear of that one-time any of her other songs-' Oh heard ye yon pibroch or ' Sweet sir for your courtesy'-" He turned away, and looked round the big dining-hall. He professed to be interested in the question as to whether the stags' antlers displayed along the cornice were real or manufactured. And when he came back to the small table that Somerled Macdonald had engaged, he asked whether the latest telegrams had come in about the Forfarshire election. Macdonald's firm eyes were not to be deceived. He said to himself, " Here is a man whose heart is broken, by the bitter stroke of fate and in all God's universe what atonement can be made to him for that No, nor may one even offer a furtive word of sympathy !" Thereafter They resumed their journey: and as their route lay along the east bank of the river, they came within sight of the Island, and, on the opposite side of the stream, the red house with its black araucaria, its cedars, and Its. yellowed elms and Times. The sunlight was on the place, and all seemed happy and quiet "Do you see that open gate 5" said Gilchrist-for the eyes of both men were fixed on the same spot I know it." " Ah. but some day the drive will not be so empty as It is now. You will find Eelin Macdonald come swinging along, with the joy of youth in her free way of walking, and the joy of youth in her greeting to this one and that. Look-they have left the gate open. Do you understand what that is for Why, when she comes out for her first stroll. j she will not be impeded ! And of course Jane will be there, when the carriage comes out from town and Morag will have plenty of rugs: and I shouldn't wonder when the land an goes by if General i Mattock were to hurry down. to the front, to wave a glad congratulation to her. I can make out the whole picture and I don't wonder that the servants, come running down to the corner of the pathway. to see her off should be crying with delight for Miss Eelin had a trick of making many friends both gentle- and simple and when she first goes to a Invernish. after her illness, the word will be passed round, and many a one will come out to shake hands with her and say something kind to her. Oh. yes. she had the way of making friends-" "Gilchrist," said his companion, not without a certain anxiety. 'J do you know you have wrought yourself into a terrible pitch of excitement and unless you quiet down something may happen The last news is good news ; what more could you wish for Now tell me how it was you chanced to be out here so early, the morning she dashed herself into the river ?" " Oh. well," said Archie Gilchrist-and the question did in a measure recall him to his senses though these were disturbed enough generally come out here about daybreak ; the place is so quiet and 1 bring my books and papers with me. and get on a little bit with my work. And, indeed, I was so much engaged with these things, that when I saw her come down to the edge of the river, at that time of the morning. I thought it was merely some phantasm of the brain-a ghost-a white ghost which I could get rid of by shutting my eyes. But when she splashed into the stream, then I knew. It has always been her ambition to swim through the Devil's Kirn up to the weir and there were the women come shrieking down from the house and I knew. Yes, I knew. And I knew what the end must be and I waited on the bank until the swing of the current carried her down, and then I went in and got hold of her." "Otherwise she would have been drowned ?" said his neighbour, with downcast eyes. "Her strength was far spent, was the answer. And then the straightforward eyes looked up again. "You love this girl quite to distrac- tion," said Somerled Macdonald. "And she has promised to marry you. And you have just saved her life. Yet you seem to suggest that I should take her away from you. on account of a few words spoken in delirium. My friend, even if there were any such impossible possibility I am not a coward hound."
