Thc'Little Laureate begs to introduce you in his own way to a lady who introduces herself to you every night. - LADY BUTTON-BYES. When the busy day is "done,-_ ," And my weary little one Eocketh gently to and fro; When the night Avdnds softly blow, And the crickets in the glen .. Chirp and chirp .and chirp again; When upon the haunted green \- ' Fairies dance around their queen : Then from yonder misty skies .Cometh Lady Button-Eyes. . Cometh "like a fleeting ghost From some distant eerie coast; ? Never footfall can you hear ; Aa that' spirit fareth near Never whisper, never , word - From that shadow-queen Is heard.

And" those white hands overspread Like a veil the curly head,. < ' Seem to fondle and caress» Every little silken tress; Then she smooths the eyelids down Over those two eyes of brown In such soothing tender-wise, : * Cometh Lady Button-Eyes. , ?
