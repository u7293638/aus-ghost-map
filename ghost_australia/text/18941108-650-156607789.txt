THE ART OF SPOOK RAISING. Mrs. Mellon's fovorite spook, Geor die, has been weighed in the scale, and found to tot np seven stone two pounds. That's not very weighty for a man, but pretty good for a spook. The medium, it appears, diminishes as the spirit under order materialises, and a' though Mrs. M.'s ordinary weight is about eight stone she only weighed five stone whilst Geordie remained on view. The proba bility is that if she were to materialise two or threo goblins at once she would disappear altogether. It is a pity (per haps) that a number of tho Australian spinsters who wonder why the men do not propose are not mediums. If they were they might be able to raise husbands out of spirit land : â€” ? , She was a lonely maiden, rather poor and somewhat plain, And her woman's heart was laden with a longing and a pain. For a husband phe was yearning, And cventully on learning That men might be materialised from spooks bv zenhvrs blown. She resolved to find a ghost, and raise a hubby of her own. ? After labors most suprising she alighted on a plan Of correct [materialising, and produced a proper man. Not a week the couple tarried, But were very promptly married, And because it took six stone off her (please reader do not laugh) To materialise the man, lie is indeed her ' bettor half.' From Gehenna, be it stated, came the spirit in this case And that plucky girl is mated with a spook from Satan's place. She is strong of mind, however, - And advanced, and rather clever ; She can talk like fifty lawyers, and is giv'n to raising Cain, And I know her hubby wishes he was back with Nick again ?
