THE CHARGE OF CLOWNS. (After Hayes and Benhamo's Circus.) The Clowns are drawn up With bladders in hand, And placed at their head Sir Henry doth stand — Quixotic Sir Henry, With Dave as his Sancho, Has been foiled in his Bill Of a Fifth Judge in Banco. " Press-gagger," " ghost-raiser," And " despot," he's named ; By the Press, thro' the country, His tyranny's blamed. The Council sneer at him, And bid him defiance — For in him and his friends They can place no reliance. The members of Council, Sans peur, sans reproche, See the " insolent despot" In anger approach. Like bold cavaliers The charge they withstand, And the knight is hurled back WTith his turbulent band. Thrice charged he the Council, And thrice he has failed — His defeat the spectators With gladness have hailed. For the Children of Freedom No sympathy show When " insolent despots" Like Parkes are laid low. The thrice-beaten tyrant Some moments doth pause, Ere he makes a last charge On the " finders of flaws" — The men who've refused To pass every Bill Of Sir Henry's, and will not Be slaves of his will. As the tournament closes, He seizes the chance, With furious charge 'Gainst his foes to advance ; On their leaders he rushes Again and again, But on their proof armour His strokes fall in vain. The knight then is baulked Of the vengeance he sought, And his bladder explodes With a noisy report. His foes have no fear, Though he threaten them still ; For his threats are but vox Et praeterea nil. Don't copy Ben Dizzy, Sir Harry the Great ; Your imperious schemes Have met a just fate. Ben made our loved Queen Mighty Empress of Ind ; His plots were successful, Yours cast to the wind.
