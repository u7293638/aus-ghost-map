' hnt thib'? was "'personal malignity" in my letter Is hot trio. I know all the parties concerned tn "the Strong case," probably hetter than your correspondent, and think that the Presbytory of Melbourno has noted unwisely iin soverai par ticulors. lut oven n a'Presbytory has not a monopoly of wisdom, and unwise conduct" has not been.ooofincd to one sideo: Tho, charitable "Ghost," however, charged the Prersytery with motives, feelings onhd conduct worthy of the perpetrators of the "Phoenix Park tregcdy," but this wos only one of hilt "peaondilloes", whlich thidnhrity of your readers is expected to' cover. I accused him, of this, and he knows now that the accusation was true. I stated fnots, and shiowed that he wrote hi total ignor ance of church law'dnd usage, but instead of re. plying to these tie seizes the unimlirtant part of my letter and abused me. 'A story;ls told of. a husband whoso better.half In. moments of wrath habitually chastieod. When asked why he did not retaliate, he said "It pleaqes her and'dols not hurt. ome." lly only desire is that both sides of the dace should hbe kIgown to the publio, and not the oneshided report, barbed with "personal malignity" written by your. norrespondent-a report that could usually be written in Tasmanla two days beforo it appIears in your columns. Iti'any impartial account it would bo'difficult to find tile atrong tonguago used by your correspondent, but I send you the following quotations : ' There is no doubt the Presbytery would gladly accept Mr. Strong's resignation, and I end the imatter, if it couhl legally and honourably accept this oetrer.

A oirrespondent of the Daily Teleyraphputs the tase with great clearness and forc :-Althoughl not a member of the Proahbytery nor a tinister, I can say, from very aocurate hiformation. that every member of the presbytery would gladlysolve the diffioulty in this way wret'it possible, and thereby save thpmselvee thie fulfilment of what, to all of thern without exception, is a most u'npleasant duty. They are, however, in such m position according to thle law of the Clhrch, that if they accept Air. Strotg'o resignation simpliciter, le can .at once call upon thenm to grant him a prasbyteral certificatne, to Etho effect that when ie resignedol his charge and connection with the Church, there was no charge against hhr or his doctrine. How cail the Pueslytery grant such a rertlficto,ln the faensof the fact that there lies on the P'resbytery thblo a notice that Mir.
