The Queensland portion of the incoming mails may be expected to arrive in Brisbane either on Monday night .or Tuesday morning. The Baroda left Melbourne at noon on Thursday for Sydney, where she would probably arrive on Saturday (this) afternoon. • An old man named M'Donald, who keeps an apple stall in Queen-street, next Phillips' Hotel, wasstruckdownon Thursday afternoon while at tending to his avocation, with a paralytic stroke.' The occurrence attracted a crowd about- the spot, and medical aid was at once sent for.

' ' / A meeting- of operatives will be held in Brisbane on Monday evening next, to take into consideration the best means of celebrat ing the anniversary of the establishment of the eight hours' system. A musical treat of a novel character will bes presented to the Brisbane public on the evening of Monday next. Herr Yon Kosa, whose abili ties as a musician are well known in Brisbane, has made arrangements to give a moonlight concert in the Botanic Gardens on the evening named, and as he will be assisted by the mem bers of the German Glee Club and several other good musicians, there -is every reason to believe that the affair will be most successful. The programme will comprise vocal and instrumental performances, and the charge for admission will be very moderate. ..

He was living with his sister, and after breakfast he went ont. Immediately afterwards a shot was heard, but no notice was taken of this, and about 10 o'clock-a second shot was. heard. The nephew of the deceased, a lad aged about six years, was sent out to look for him, and he, found his hat on .the edge of a waterhole, about a hundred yards from the house. .He at once informed his mother of the circumstance, and she called in the assistance of a neighbor named Ballin ger. The waterhole was then searched, and on 'the body being got out it was found that the deceased was shot through the head. Infor mation was given to the police, and.Senior constable Delamere proceeded to the spot, and on further examination of the waterhole he found a short fowling-piece. From the nature of the injuries inflicted on the unfortunate man, it would appear that he discharged the con tents of. the piece in his mouth. He had. been insane for a considerable-time past, and was the same person who some time ago killed two valuable geese in the Botanic Gardens, for which offence he was imprisoned. A hagistebiax inquiry was held on Feb. 12, .before F. Rawlins, Esq., touching the death of Joseph Lightfoot, a seaman belonging to the King Harold, now lying in the river, who was found drowned. The evidence respecting the poor man's fate is very meagre, but it is sur mised that he fell into the river while in a state of intoxication. Daniel Dunn, a seaman, who had formerly belonged to the King Harold, stated that he was with the deceased at St. Patrick's Hotel, Queen- street, on Saturday night, about half-past 9. He was then the worse for liquor, but could take care of himself. On Monday morning he saw his dead body in a punt off the Market Steps, North Quay; but he missed a' blue cloth jacket and cap to match which was worn by the deceased on Saturday night. George Campbell stated that he saw the deceased at his father's public-house, South Brisbane, about 11 o'clock on Saturday night; he had a glass of ale and remained for half-an-h'our ; witness advised the deceased to go on board, telling him that he was going to close the door; but he replied "All right, George, I am not going aboard ; I am going to look after pretty Polly." He then went away in the direction of. the Corporation Witness watched him for a little while, and observed that he walked pretty straight. He had his coat rolled on his arm, which may account for its being missing. -" • The sad accident which occurred at Nerang" Creek on the 13th of October last, when three men ; and a black boy were drowned, will not have been forgotten. The boat, the property' of Mr. F. Rawlins, Police Magistrate, was not recovered at the time, and all hopes respecting it had long since been abandoned. Strange; to say, however, it is again afloat, after having been knocked about for some four months. It's recovery has been purely accidental, it having been found, a short time ago,, washed up on Stradbroke , Island, somewhat damaged, no doubt, but still in remarkably good condition, and fittfor the"water. It must have been a re markably good "craft," otherwise it would have been in pieces long ago. At the fortnightly meeting of the -Petrie terrace Band of Hope, held on Tuesday even ing last, it was agreed that the sum of £2 be . voted out of the funds of the society for the benefit of the Brisbane Hospital, but with the special request that' the money, should not be spent in intoxicating liquors. The President, in giving his reasons for making this stipulation, referred to the large sum which had been ex pended by the Institution during the past year for intoxicating drinks. He said that it was being proved by medical men who had studied ■the subject that spirituous liquors were un necessary to the human system, and that it was \- only in very rare cases that they were required in medical treatment. In the face of this, they found that the expeuse of supplying the hos pital with intoxicants was only £1 less than that for bread. He read an extract from a letter published in the Courier of Monday last in support of his arguments, and maintained that by far the greater part of the £203 paid by the hospital for spirits, win£, and beer had been worse than thrown away. A temperance was given by Mr. J. Guthrie, jun., and were delivered by Messrs. Church and D. Forbes, which were listened to attentively. The nsaal weekly meeting of the Articled Clerks' Society took place on Feb. 12, at the 'Supreme Court Chambers, when the Hon. the Attorney-General presided. The following was the question for discussion :—" The banking account of A. being overdrawn, he was charged compound inter eat at 6 per cent., with half . yearly rests. On Ihi3 death in the middle of . a half- yearly rest the, bank continued to claim compound interest from'the executors. "Was tne claim proper ?". Mr. Ocock, who argued in the affirmative, quoted from Bignell v. Harper, 4 Exchq., 743.; and- Mr. Ruthning, who took the negative, from Waring v. Cunliffe, Yes. Juris., 99; ex parte ßeavan, 9 Vesey Juris., 233; Ferguson v. Fyfe, Cl. and Fin., House of Lords, vol. 8, 127; Crosskill v. Bower, 23 Beavan's Rep., 93. The Attorney-Q-eneral decided the question in the negative, on the authority of Crosskill v. Bower, 23 Beav. Rep., 93, but stated there was a still later case—viz., William son v. Williamson, 7 vol. T.R., £q., the par ticulars of which he shortly stated. The meet ing terminated with a vote of thanks to the Attorney-General for his attendance. . We mentioned some > time ago that the pro prietorof the; Albert- street Turkish Baths had ' erected a large filter on the premises in order to secure the batherß; pure water. Captain O'Reilly has been testing the'water!.' so filtered, and writes rto Mr.>Lethem as follows:—" I have examined, with a microscopic power of 500 a sample of the Enoggera water filtered by ''you for the use of the baths, and find it perfectly free from all deleterious vegetable matter, with which it so - much abounds in the unfiltered state." This is satisfactory. The luxury of the .Turkish bath iss-becoming more• thoroughly known and .appreciated here through.the spirited' efforts made by Mr; Lethem to over come all obstacles in order to render his bath as complete and attractive as possible.. A SiTPPiiEJiENT to the Government Gazette, published on Feb." 14, contains proclamations having reference to " The Foreign Enlistment Act of 1871" and " The Naturalisation Act of 1870," passed by the Imperial Parliament, and also describing the amended boundaries of the Metropolitan, Northern, and Western District Court districts. • One female patient died at the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum- last .week. The number now in the house is—Males, 143 ; females, 69. The Surgeon-Superintendent acknowledges, with thanks, the receipt of one English and several colonial newspapers for the use of the patients. THE.preserved meat companies in New South Wales do not appear to have turned out the paying speculations which their projectors cal culated on. At the^ half-yearly meeting of the Goulburn Meat Preserving Company held lately, the report showed a loss of £3300. - The retiring directors, Messrs. Gibson and Finlay, were re-elected. A special meeting of the shareholders is about to be convened to con sider the position of the society. The prospectus of a new property and in vestment company is submitted in this issue, and from a knowledge of the promoters, we should say that it ought to be successful. The lately-wedded South Sea Islanders, if report speaks truly, have not had a particularly happy time of it with their spouses since the celebration of the nuptials. One of these dam sels, we understand, appeared at the Police Court recently for the purpose of pre ferring a charge against her husband of attempt ing to poison her. An investigation of the cir cumstances, however, proved that it was only an act of extra attention and solicitude on the part of her husband that the suspicious-minded lady had construed into an attempt on her life. On the previous night, it appeared, she had been suffering from pains in the stomach, and her spouBe was affectionately trying all the remedies which his limited knowledge of the pharma copoeia made him aware of. Having some dim knowledge of the efficacy of* burnt brandy in suchcases, heessayedtoprocuresome. Having no fire at hand, however, the poor fellow waB rather "bothered" how to prepare the dose; but at length he thought that setting fire to it with wax matches would answer the same purpose. This he effected to his own satisfaction, but not, it appears, to the satisfaction of the partner of his joys and sorrows, for, on his handing her the tumbler, her nose was greeted with such a perfume of sulphur that she at once jumped to the conclusion that her husband had been decocting some deadly draught, with the objeot of destroying her. All his affirma tions to the contrary were of no avail, and hence her appearance at the Court. , The proprietors of the A.8.N. Company held their half-yearly meeting at their head office, Sussex-street, Sydney, on the 30th ultimo. The chairman, Mr. T. Walker, h&/ibg moved the adoption of the report, an ajjMndmerit was made -by a shareholder, that the sum of £3500, in lieu of £1000, be transferred from in surance account to credit of profit and l^ss^and that a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum be declared, which was carried. The following is the directors' report:—" Your directors, in submitting their report for the past half-year, zegret that the operations of the company have not proved more remunerative. A Berious loss has been sustained in an attempt to open up a mail line to England, via San Francisco; which, in consequence of the small ness of the subsidy granted by Government, had to be abandoned. The usual reserves have been made for depreciation and insurance. The amount at credit of the former is £9534 4s. 6d.; and the latter £36,982 7s. 3d., after carrying forward £1000 to the credit of profit and loss, which account will then amount to £8887 13s. 6d.; from this your directors recommend a di vidend at the rate of 5 per cent, per annnm, which will absorb £8000, leaving to be carried forward an undivided balance of £887 13s. 6d." An extraordinary tramp across the Continent by a lunatic is noticed incidentally by the Ade laide papers. The lunatic walked from Queens land to the Darling, then down that river and across the country to the Peake, a station on the overland Jine of telegraph. He was with out canteen or blankets, and lodged with the natives he met with on his journey. The con dition of his hair is very remarkable. It is ten inches in length, and strongly and densely matted together. An extraordinary feature in his- -hirsute development is that the hair all round the back and sides of the head was short, and the excessive growth was confined to the "crowni where it was so luxuriant that the man ■ c hacf to cut a hole in the top of his hat to let the • Bg.ir through. . A LITTLE boy named Christy, while walking along a footpath at Pegleg Gully, spied a por- tion of a match-box sticking out of the ground, and stooping to dig it out from the earth, found that it contained gold. He speedily carried home his treasure, and the gold on being weighed, amounted to 12 ozs. 10 dwts. The father of the boy is a miner in the North Peg- leg Company. It is supposed that the match- box and its contents were left in the early days by the occupant of some tent which occupied the site where the gold was found.—Bendigo Advertiser. A Victobian country paper relates a ghost story. On the night of • the 8th January, ■'" about 9 o'clock, as the Rev. Mr. Bayley, ac companied by two of Mr. Hughes' daughters^ was driving towards Millhayen, when opposite Mr.Wainhold's paddock, near the Lake Hotel, Mr. Bayley saw a gaunt female figure, dressed in flowing white robes, rise out of the ground and extend her arms right in front of the horse. The animal became frightened, and bolted right through the figure. Miss Hughes exclaimed, ' Dear me, what was that ?' Mr. Bayley endea vored to pull the horse up ; but on he dashed, nor could he be induced to stop till he reached the gate at Millhaven." Ashobt time ago, we (Bathurst Times) ex tracted from a Sydney journal a paragraph, in which it was stated that a resident of the me tropolis had been poisoned by wearing colored socks, and we have just heard/of a similar case having occurred in Bathurst. A gentleman bought a dozen pairs of socks, Btriped in rings of different colors, which he wore, pair after pair, until he exhausted the stock. He shortly began to be annoyed with an unpleasant ting ling sensation in his feet, which increased in violence until he was unable to move about. Small blisters began to show themselves on his feet; inflammation and swelling at the same time set in, and eventually virulent eruptions appeared in circles round his legs corresponding to the stripes on the socks. The pain is said to be very severe, and the invalid is confined to his bed. The case furnishes another example of the poisonous ingredients used in the production of colored articles of dress. Baboo Keshttb Chundeb Sen.—The friends of the Baboo in England have made him a present of a handsome sweet-toned organ for his church in Calcutta. It is hoped it may be opened at the great Somaj Festival in January, 1872, when the different representatives of that religious movement in India meet at Calcutta from various parts of that great empire. Mr. Sen is aiming to introduce English sacred music and hymns among the natives, and the ' organ he thinks will facilitate'this important work. , ,
