HONEST LABOUR VICE DEATH BEFORE DISHONOUR. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS, Sir, - It is odd how often great minds seize upon the same ideas at the same time. The exact views "enunciated" in your leading article upon the Colcloughian letter pre- sented themselves to me after reading the letter of the great apostless of female rights and wrongs. You will admit, I imagine, that The Argus is a good medium for adver- tising; to look at it any day would make people think so. Well, Sir, I have lately - or rather my wife has and we are one except in a Colcloughian point of view - advertised for a servant, and not a single application has been made. After trying The Argus once or twice we gave the Age a turn with a similar result and we are to this day help-less and had I any faith in the bona fides of Mrs. or Miss Colclough - she is called by both titles - I would have applied to her. Man, the inferior animal in the Colcloughian eye, will seek for employment even although not suited for it. Not long ago I advertised for on errand boy, and men - married men - offered to take the work at the boy's wages. Why don t these "death-before- dishonour" women try to do a little housework. Every young woman of the middle class is supposed to be domesticated enough to do the work of the house. My daughters can and have to do it at the present time and my wife has to lend a hand as well. Mr Statist Hayter is a gentleman who hungers after statistics. If he were to compile a return of the number of families without servants and willing to engage them it would rather astonish the Colcloughians. As to wages our tariff is £26 per annum; we have paid £30 for a thorough good servant. These wages are preferable to dishonour. Don t you think so?-Your &c.;, TOM CRINGLE'S GHOST.
