That here, in this distant bralch of the Church, while the eyes of our Fatherlantl aro wrapped in'sleep, begins from many lips the hy ii of praisej and when again tho advent of night sto «for a time our worship, that hymn is taken up i the other hemisphere, and carried on in ceaseless ron da of adoration. His Lordship next alluded to the/mar- vellous effects of the Spirit in working so change, as was manifested-in the Apostles a day of Pentecost,' when compared with their oh and conduct before it, and this he exemp" various ways.-"And though,'" said Us 1 "the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit wea longer to be expected, it were faithless to doubt 1 reality of that Spirit's influence "because it was unseen] for He who first in the days of the Apostles plantea his Church was pledged by His promises to sustaU and support it through all ages; for the promise was not only to the Jews and their children, nut «rito 11 that are afar off-' even as many as the Lord our G< i shall call.' " But as St. Paul's words (Eph. IT., li»11 ) apply with no less force now than they did in the'dayaV of the infant Church, his Lordship deduced from these and other texts the duty incumbent on the lair/ of regarding in their ministers the accredited ambas- sadors ot Christ, and pointed out that it was'the message and not the messenger to be regarded, proceeding to warn the congregation aj captious spirit of criticism, which, instead of humility, was much too prevalent in these days.) He ekumed for the two candidates whom he_ about to send out as the labourers of the Lord's rine yard, the same respect which would be accord? the most learned, the most cloquont, and the\ experienced minister, founding this claim upon nature of the office, in which tie commission of C1 and not the hmworthuicss of the minister, was regarded. _ The attention of tho congregation, and the deep silence which prevailed, showed how eagerly he was listened to. The Bishop was never more happy, both in his matter and,manner, than upon this solemn occasion. His fine-toned voice, so excellently modulat- ed, seemed to thrill through his hearers, and produced that religious and devout feeling with which, I believe, we were all imbued when we left the church. Every member of the Church of England must rejoice to receive as pastors these young clergymen. The Bishop expressed himself as most highly gratified with their ordination examination, which his Lordship considered as partly owing to the course of study which they had pursued at Christ College, showing how valuable is even an approximation to the mere University training of England in the preparation for the Ministry.
