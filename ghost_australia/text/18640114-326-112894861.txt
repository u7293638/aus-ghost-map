A man of refined eda.-scion and manners, M'j or Beckham was regarded as tha standard of virtue and benevolence. Mr A. F. Beckham and family had resided for the last fifteen years at the Compromise Landing, engaged in merchandising, farming, and keeping an extensive wood yard, a d by industry, econ omy, and perneterance, had acquired a con siderable fortune; indeed no man fstood higher in the estimation of his neighbours. He waa particularly noted for his kindness to his nlaves We may safely affirm that the fam ily were classed among; the highest in the community. Some tim e wef-ks previous to US c T_l.
