SPORTING. The autumn meeting of the Victoria Amateur Tuif Club was held at Caulfield on April 25 In the Hurdle liace, Minerva, another of the Tasmanian horses that are just now i mining so well in the colony, won rather easily from a field of nine otheis.

Queensland were slowest m getting avva), while Tasmania surprised all with the excellent manner in which they went oil Bros was giving the New South Wulca ciew 10, and Senior wos leading the Victoria utonl) two less Tas- mania were soon passed by Victoria, who had obtained a slight lead ot Sydney. The row- ing of all the crews was very good indeed, and in spite of the very rapid stroke of botn S)dneyand Melbourne, there was no splash ing. Sjdney soon took Queensland's water, which enabled them to escape the full strength of the tide, which was running very strong against the competitois Appioachuig the mile point Victoria led S)dneyby half a length, the Tasmanians, who were badlv steered, and Queensland being level about two lengths behind the leaders It looked here as if the leuders were going to run away from Queensland and Tas mama, who were both about three lengths ustcrn, but rowing a good serviceable atiokc mg Some ot the Victorians were now hanging out signals ot distress, and occa- sionally they got very ragged, but Senior soon pulled them together. S)dne) passed Victoria at Tennyson, rowing bcautilully together, and from this to the finish the) improved, the swing and time being fault less. The cutting down tactics pursued by the Melbourne, and their having rowed against the full current, had, however, done its work, and it looked as it 'Ina mama, who were rowing well together, would beat Victoria, but the latter stuck to it, although much distressed. S)dney won by a length and a hall, \ letona being two lengths ahead ot Tasmania, who in turn were a length clear of Queensland. The two latter made a very rcbpeitable show in their first attempt at eight oared mung, but their being so handy at the tunah was owing to the Hitting down policy of the leaders BothSjdneyaud Melbourne rowed too quick a stroke to be thoroughly effective Edward Ilanlan, the ex champion oarsman, returned per Zealandia to ins home at Toronto He stated pubhcl) before leaving that he pieserv ed a prolound admiration lor New South Wales and its people, and has a deepscnseofgratitudofortliegenerosity shown towards lum there, and should he be spared it is his intuition to return to Niw South Wales and permanently nude there Ile also spoke m most complimentary terms ot lleach as an oarsman, and a man whose friendship he felt proud to possess The ex champion is not bo robust in appiurnnie as when hehrst came to the colonies, the beere exercise and the failures ho has undergone having no doubt robbed lum of Ins htrengtli and spirits in some measure, though till) have not de- prived lum of the desue which he hopes to ¡ulld on his return-ot meeting Bench again Ilanlnn waa treated with ever) public mm k of honour, and presentations vvi le made lo him Ile lias been commissioned to inform'leemer that Beach will low linn or any other sculler in America over the champion course on the Parramatta for ¿'1,000 and the championship of the world, and, in the event of Teenier ac- cepting, w ill allow _200 for expenses Two coursing meetings have been held dilling the fortnight The Victoria Coursing Clubopened with a ladies'meeting Theiiruce let was won bj the lion W M'Cullochs Match Girl, bv Chester, who beat Mr .1 B Scotts Silver king, b) Silent Hie Ladies'Plate fell to Mi J B Scotts Sk), by Bannagher, the runner np being Mr I!
