PREACHERS' CORNER. * POWER IN THE PULPIT. Never until there is a renewal of the pentecostal baptism will ministers be blessed with numerous conversions. No means which may be used apart from this can bring them about. Nothing can supply the place of the atonement of power. Nothing can produce the same effect on human hearts as the gift of the Holy Ghost. Advanced learning cannot do it. Greater talents cannot do it. A more commanding oratory, or a more attractive eloquence cannot do it. Heavenly unction alone accompanying the Word, can do that which all human means combined cannot accomplish without it. "To me," says Professor Finney, "it seems very manifest that the great difference in ministers, in regard to their spiritual influence and usefulness, does not lie so much in their literary and scientific attainments as in the measure of the Holy Ghost which they enjoy." The Holy Ghost enjoyed in full measure by the ministry, and the churches would wake up, and sinners would be converted. Truth would be made powerful to convince and to save. It is possible for truth to come from cold lips, lifeless, without warmth or feeling. The soul is not energised with the truth, and therefore, it generally falls dead. Truth in the mind, the heart and the life, and the Spirit of God operating through the truth upon the soul and the character, calls into exercise a divine force, a soul-magnetism, that makes itself felt, and draws and attracts. As ministers then we should be filled, we had almost said surcharged, with spiritual influence. Behind our words there should be an unseen power, that should make them enter human hearts. We must get entirely sanctified, for that means to get power. We must be filled with the Holy Spirit, for that i6 to possess mighty power.â€” Set.
