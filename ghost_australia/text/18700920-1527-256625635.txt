SOLEMN VOICES. By H. W. Longfellow. I beard from out the dreary realms of sorrow The various tongues of Wo : One said, " Is there a hope in the morrow ?" And many answered, " No 1" And they arose and mingled their loud voices, And cried in bitter breath— " In all our joys the past alone rejoices— There is no joy but Death." " Oh ! dreadful Past, Beyond thy midnight Thou hast usurped our peace, . [portal And if the angel Memory be immortal, When shall this anguish cease ?" And suddenly within the darkened distance The solemn Past replied : " In my domaips your joys have no existence; Your homca, they have not died I " Nought comes to mc except those ghosts Phantoms of Wrong and Pain ; [detested, But whatsoe'er Affection hath invested, The sternal years retain. " Then stand no toore with look and souls To woo and win despair ; [dejected. The joy ye mourn the future hath collected, Your hopes are gathering there. " And; as the dew which leaves the morning Augments the after rain, [flowers And as the blooms which Ml from -summer And multiplied again— [bowers " So shall the joys the Future holds- in Augment your after, peace ; [keeping So- shall your hopes, which-now are only Return with, large increase." 1 [sleeping,
