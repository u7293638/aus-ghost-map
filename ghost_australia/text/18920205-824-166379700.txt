VERSICAL VARIETIES. A SUNSET IN THE HILLS.. The clouds have turned to red, The hills send down their shade upon the plain, The quiet sun his parting beams has shedâ€” Soon darkness will remain. The last shafts light the fret Of long gumleaves and sheaoaks' hairy plumes, And gleam upon the wattles' coronet Of gently nodding blooms. In England yonder globe, Like some great yellow serpent glides away, And leaves the twilight gossamer to robe And shrive the dying day. In Austral's tropic climes The day departs with pride, his gorgeous train Of light outshining those in ancient time Of great King Tamburlaine. Or, South, 'midst troops of ghosts All clad in grey, he palely flies, Leaving the windy sprites in whisp'ring hosts To fill the night with sighs. The shrill cicala sleeps, The Dusk spreads out her mournful wings Until the Moon above the hilltops peeps, And down her soft light flings. Adelaide, January, 1892.
