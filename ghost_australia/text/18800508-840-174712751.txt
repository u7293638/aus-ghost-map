. . QUARRELSOME i BLACK fellows. ? O.N Sunday afternoon a .disgraceful scene was .enacted in Kent- street, Maryborough (says the Chr.uUelo) near the shipbuilding yards of ?Messrs. Walker and Co. Two bluokfellows, apparently the worse for liquor, and enjoying some difference of opinion — possibly over tho quantity of liquor consumed— entered Into a fight, in which sheath knives, with tho keenest edge*, wore freely used, the gashed mode in the bodies of tho gladiators being horrible to look upon. Tho monotony of thoknifooutting was re lieved occafionclly by a sneh beimriuflictedwith a tomahawk, which also appenred to have been speoially prepared for tho fray. Blood was llowing l'roely on both sides, and had not two members of the police force arrived opportunely, there is little doubt tho weaker of tho blacks would havo yielded up his aboriginal ghost. The police having taken the carving implements from tho warriors, the latter made their way to the river, whioh they crossed, and no doubt settled tboir dieputo with other weapons.
