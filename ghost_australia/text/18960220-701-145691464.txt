THE WAVERLEY ELECTION. The by-election at Waverley is becoming interesting. The number of candidates is reduced to three. Alderman Jessep, the officially selected candidate of the Ministerial Free Traders, Mr. T. H. Barlow, ditto ditto for the Protectionists, and Sir Henry Parkes, who fights for his own hand. On paper it is difficult to pick tbe winner, though I am entitled to take Alderman Jessep for choice. Dir Henry, however, will rob him of many votes . and may even squeeze in himself or enable the Protectionist to do so. Waverley is a strong Free Trade constituency, but by Sir Henry P&rkes;'s candidature the effective Free Trade forces are divided. The Ministry are taking an active interest i'3 the election and several of them have done what they 1 could to secure the return oÂ£ the nomiuee of 1 the party. The two morning papers are also working with tbe same end in view. On the { other side the big gun6 of the Protectionists, | Mr. Lyne and Mr. See, have opened tire. Sir i Henry Parkes conducts his own campaign, and neither the papers nor the politicians have anything to say on his behalf. Still the I glamour of his reputation counts for some- | thing, and public sympathy is awakened on | his behalf by the fact that his dearly loved : library is for sale. Someone, whether a I friend or enemy, 1 do not know has circulated I a report tbat Sir Henry is about to embrace I the ttoman Catholic faith. This, however, from the here of the Kiatua Ghost episode, I appear* highly improbable. |
