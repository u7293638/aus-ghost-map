REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON PARA TURASES AND HYMNS. fly meat PRESENTED TO THE FREE CHURCH OF' SHOT- *" U I LIND AsSrMllI/Ã¯. til (From the Eoamielual Witness) tin The committee desire, at the outset, to remind the Assembly of the forms in which they were originally appointed three years ago " The General Assembly having taken into consideration the overtures relating to paraphrases and hymns, and having respect to the importance of the subject, and especially to the diversity of opinion which prevails logureling it, appoint a committee maturely to consider the whole matter, enjoining said committee to re port to next General Assembly whether, in their opinion, any such changes as those now craved should be made, and if so, in what way this may best be done, so as to preserve the peace and promote the edification of the Church " the changes referred to in this finding as "those now craved," were a revision of the existing collection of parcels uses and hymns, and an addition to these materials of prose, epic clash in respect of hymns The committee briefly reported to the following General Absodi bly, and more fully, but still only in an interim manner, to last Gona an Assembly 'they stated reasons why they judged it desirable to delay a decision on the points at issue for another your 3 and, meanwhile, they submitted for the infor- mation of all interested in the question, the result of historical researches by several of the members into the views and practice of the early Church, as also of the Reformed Church of Scotland, on the subject to this was added a brief analysis of the collection of paraphrases and hymns now in use, which were divided into three classes according as they were thought fit to be retained, to be rejected, or were of doubt ful character On this report the General Assembly pronounced the following deliver once they "approve of the report, record their thanks to the convenor and vice conveyor, and to those members of committee who have so diligently investigated particular topics, to appoint the committee, with instruction to review these topics and the whole subject, so as to present, if possible a complete report to the next General Assembly " They also omitted to this committee for consideration the versions of the Psalms which had been prepared by the Psalmody Committee Having given much attention during the last year to the whole matter in 11 used to them and believing that the duty devolves on them by the Church requires that they should no longer delay coming to a decision with regard to the questions which have been linseed, they submit the following statements and suggestions as the result of then length honed and careful deliberations - I There is no evidence, so far as they can discover, that unripened of her history the Church of Scotland pronounced a decision or took a step which showed that she was opposed to the use in divine worship of metrical versions of other parts of Scripture than the Psalms of David, and even of uninspired compositions under the name of spiritual songs on the con that, there is clear proof that on several occasions in the course of that history, and even when the Church was in her pm est state, as at the time of the second Rofoun tion, she adopted measures for having a collection outdoor other materials of praise than those contained in the Psalter II While it is matter of dispute how far the existing collection of paraphrases and hymns has obtained formal ecclesiastical sanction, it is a fact universally known and admitted that this collection, consisting as it does of both classed of compositions now under consideration, though in very unequal proportions, has had for nearly a hundred years the sanction of recognised and extensive in public worship in these can cumstances the Church cannot possibly divest herself of a large measure of responsibility in connection both with the principle involved and the actual materials of the collection Believing that the course hitherto pin sued by the Church, as brought out in those facts now detailed is in accordance with the Word of God, for they can see no principle there which, either directly or nulli telly, fottors the liberty of the Church in the exercise of praise, any more than in that of pray or so of preaching, and that it is not loss in harmony with the standards of the Church, which impose no limit in the matter of worship, except in so far as the Scripture does it, believing further Mint the collection hitherto in use among us lSBCiiously defective and objectionable, a number of parcels uses and h> inns composing it being more or less questionable m doctrine, unevangchcal m spirit, or otherwise unsuitable for the purpose of , believing also that a strong de- sire is felt by many sound and devout ministers, office bearers, and members of the China for an addition to the materials of praise, especially in the shape of standard and edifying hymns and believing finally that there is serious danger of unauthorised collections being introduced, containing in not a few instances compositions which are erroneous, and fitted to be injurious to all classes, especially to the young and inexperienced, the committee venture to suggest -- that the present collection of paraphrases and by land should be carefully revised, those which no objectionable us a whole being ex dueled, und a fog in which faulty stones or expressions occur being corrected and improved They believe that materials exist, for increasing the number of good and edifying poetical translations of a similar kind, and that the so should be taken advantage of to a limited extent 2 That to the existing collection of fine phrases and he must, tints purged and supple mented, should be added a limited selection of hymns 'They say limited, for they are of opinion that the number of these) now hymns should not be large 'they issue to see introduced only such as are of a thoroughly oran golton! and well established character such as have had the stump of the Christian Church placed on them and find an echo in almost every Christian heart they are persuaded that no error has often been committed in bringing together and recommending for use a multitude of by nuns, many of them being necessarily feeble or worse, and so but little fitted to promote the edification of the worshippers 'The committee are well aware that not a few are opposed to any step of the kind, but they fondly hope that these will have respect to the convictions and desires of other equally established and all danced in the Christ ian life with themselves and us the use of such compositions would only be made permissive by the Church, as they be hove, and not enforced in the case of any, they trust that no serious obstacles will be placed in the way of the cautious and guarded course being followed which is now humbly suggested 3 That while their father inquiries have left them but little time to devote to the consulate- hour of the versions of the Psuluia remit toil to them by last General Assembly, they are of opinion that a number of those are suitable for forming part of such a collection as they have v ventured to i command On this point, however, they are not prepared to speak more decidedly AlITMHV With regard to the practice of the early Church, the following is a simple statement of authentic testimonies in chronological order 1 Pliny, the Younger, in Inn famous but not to Britain about the Christians in Bar hymn (about ROad) describes it as their practice, which he had learned from certain renegades, to meet on a soft day before dawn, and say (or sing) in turns with one another, a song to Christ as to God " This passage is quoted by Tertullian (Apel a 2 to show that nothing could has proved against the Christians except their morning assembles for Bulging to Christ and God, and by Eusebius, who renders it the custom Iheou dun

(about 170 id), dos uses how a Bli angel, going on early into a Christian union by, heard the minister beginning with the play from the father (z e the Lord's Prayer), and adding at the end the hymn of many names, which is probably what was known as the greater doxology -Soo Bingham's Antiq am 5 ft 1 The Small labyrinth, a treatise against the heresy of Artamon, now lost, but quoted by FusobiUB (Hist Keel v 28) long ascribed to Cans of Home, but now, with more probability to Hippolytus (about 220 vii), up peals to Christ inn hymns, over thin unions, in those words -" And how many psalms and songs, written by believing brethren from the beginning, praise the Word of God the Christ, inscribing divinity to Him , " and Duiner asserts that this was admitted by Arfcmon himself (Doctrine of the person of Ch>iil,vo\ 11 pp 8.10 Clark's translation) 5 Clement, of Alexandria (about 200 v d ), speaks reportedly (led u 4, St tom vi 7) of the psalms and hymns used by Christians at their courts instead of the heathen drinking songs, and at the close of Ina Pedagogue, after speaking of going to the church and there solid ing up praise to the Lord, he adds a hymn to Christ, which may possibly be his own composition, but is believed by Bishop Bull (De/ Fid Nu soot so 2), and more decidedly by Horner Doctrine of the Person of Christ, vol I p 182), to be an older hymn already in use 6 'Tertullian likewise couples psalms and hymns in two passages, (De Orulione 23, Ad Uxorem, 11 0) 1 in one referring to private or domestic worship, in the other speaking more generally and in his Apology (about 200 w. d ) he not only, as already said, quotes Play's letter on the subject, but in describing the meeting of the Christians, he says -" After the water for the hands and the lights (are brought in), as each one is able, either from Holy Scripture, or from his own genius, he is called forth into the middle to sing to God " 7 Ougon, in his reply to Celsus (about 200 to), says -"we address our hynes to Him alone who is God over all, and to His only be- gotten Ward, who is also God And we are mined in these hymns by the whole host of heaven," "o And, as this was in answer to an attack of Celsus on the worship of Christians, it may be taken as referring to what was the prac- tree in his time, about eighty years before that of Ougon 8 Dionysius, of Alexandria (about 250 id), in a work against Ncpos, an Eg) prime bishop, who was in Chiliust, commends him among other things for his much ps Um moting, with which m m of the brethren up to the present day are cheered -(Eusebius, vi 21 ) 4) The Synod of Antioch (200 id), which condemned and deposed Paul of Samosata as a bee the, say in their encyclical letter, among other charges against him, that he stopped the

), fo protest against the Arch bishop, Loonlius, who had been intruded on them, by singing with zest and emphasis the doxology in the orthodox form -"Glory) be to the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost -(See Gibbon of xxi, vol iii p 88, Smith's Ed , Bing hum's Antiq , xiv 1, 11 ) 13 In the reign of Ai Kadina and Hononus (395 408 v n ), Sooratts tells us (vi 8) that the Arians in Constantinople were wont to meet by night on Saturday and Sunday, to sing in re- sponses hymns favoring their homes, and to march through the city in the morning to the place of of assembly , and to counteract them Chrysostom got some of the orthodox to adopt the same practice, singing sound hymns, and that this led to inputted conflicts between the parties, till it was put a stop to by Imperial orders. 11 The Eastern mode of singing at a expenses was introduced into the Western Church by Ambrose at Milan, in JM a i> at the time of Justinu'a persecution, when the people had to keep watch in the church all
