GHOSTS. 'Life on the Other Side,' as described in the pages of 'Borderland,' oddly enough somewhat resembles 'Life on This Side.' According to one American female medium, who rivals Mr Stead in the familiarity of her conversations with the inhabitants of the spirit world, clothes are needed there as here; jovial souls do not get over a tendency to slang ; sectarianism is rampart ; Socialists will be glad to know there's no such thing as personal property; but unfortunately class distinction exists; the New woman will be comforted when she hears there are 'no sex conditions;' ghosts of souls cannot claim sex characteristics, but a rival spirit declares husband and wife continue lovers on the astral plane if they are in rapport with each other.
