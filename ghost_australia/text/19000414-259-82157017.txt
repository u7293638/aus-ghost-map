Frightened to Death. A correspondent sends the follow ing startling narrative to the " Daily Chronicle":â€” The peace of a select circle in Ox ford is just now considerably dis turbed by the facts having leaked | out concerning a very thrilling ghostly visitation which happened a few weeks ago in an olcj house, reputed for a long t|me past to be haunted, No tenant had been found sufficiently bold to hire it until lately, when some young ladies connected with the Sal vation Army, under the head of Miss W ,a well-known worker among the poor, ventured to take it off the landlord's hands for a smqll rental. Tlie Grit night tbey slept there they were much disturbed by uo<< canny noisea, and by titrange sounds of the moving of furniture. De termined to discover the truth, they set to work in a very methodical way flouring the staircase, bo as to detcct the footsteps, and by pasting op the fireplace. They moreover induced the policemen to watch the house, so as to prevent any knavish attempts upon their credulity. The result was highly unsatis factory, (or on the second night of their stay they all saw the figure of a woman apparently issue from the wall, and pass up the staircase and vanish. Miss W declares that the apparition actually " passed through her own person, as through a door." On the following night Miss W was upstairs, the other two ladies remaining in the parlour- Suddenly Miss heard an awful scream, and rushed down to see what had happened. On the stairs she was met by the ghost who once more " passed through her." Nothing daunted the brave lady proceeded to look for her companions. She found one of them i in strong "convulsions and the other in a dead faint. The sad part of the story is that one young lady has since gone raving mad from the effects of the fright, and the other died a few days ago from the same cause. The ghost is that of a tall female in a long grey dress or robe.
