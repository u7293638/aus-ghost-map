What May Happen. ^ Scene—A hotel. Time—A boiling summer's day in 1898. Weary tra veller—" Are you the landlord V' " I am." " Then for the love of heaven give me a pint." " Ah, but hold hard, my man. Where do you come from ?" "I've walked in from Uraidla." "And how far may that be ?" " Oh, a matter of ten miles T " Ah, but * a matter of 10 miles' wont do for the law. Did you count the mileposts V "Not I." "Then, as a conscientious publican, I am not able to supply you with malty refreshment until I have satisfied all reasonable doubts. Maria bring my Penny Guide out of the bar, and be sure to lock the bar door behind you. There's no telling when the police will look in." Long interval, during which the "bona fide" turna deadly pale and craves for something to moisten his tongue. At length the landlord having consulted his Guide* enquires, " The distance is given here as 10£ miles. Do you live in Uraidla itself V " No; I live a quarter of a mile this side. For heaven's sake give me a drink." " Humph ! I must be careful. A quarter of a mile this side would mean just ten miles. Have you ever measured the distance f' " No, d'ye think I carry a yard stick in my pocket. Gimme drinl^ or I shall die." Further interval. ; Land* lord walks hesitatingly towards bar and returns. " Look here, my man, did you sleep last night in your house, which you say is just a quarter of a mile this side of Uraidla ? Hulloa! the poor cove can't speak. Maria ! This bona fide traveller's dying. Run for Dr. Magarey." And then the man threw up his hands, gave a loud yell, and yielded up the ghost just as the landlord's little daughter was playing a Band of Hope hy mn on a piano in the bar parlor. The Jury brought in a verdict of tc Died from thirst," and added a rider to the effect that a policeman should be kept on the premises to meet all such cases c$ emergency.
