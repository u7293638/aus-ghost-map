RACING IN CALIFORNIA - On Wednesday, the 21st March, the longest and most exciting race that his ever been run in California, came off on the track two miles south-east of this city (Los Angeles) between the Sydney mare "Black Swan' and the Californian horse, "Sarco" This race has furnished food for conversation for six weeks past, and a great deal of interest was felt in the result, not only in this county but throughout the southern part of the State, and the crowd collected to witness the sport was such as is seldom seen here. The Sarco was thought by the native population to be invincible, and many hesitated not to stake their whole property on his winning the race. The Black Swan is well known as a race horse, having run several races in the northern part of the State. Both animals were in good condition on arriving at the ground though it was easy to perceive the superor training of the mare. At the word " Santiago,"' they were off. The horse at the start was about two lengths ahead, but in going fifty yards the mare distanced him, and kept her position till the arrival at the turning point, when the horse again led. As before, however, the mare soon came up, and arrived at the winning post about 75 yards a-head, having completed the nine miles in just 19 minutes and 20 seconds. The principal stake was 1000 head of cattle and 2000 dollars in money, but from reliable sources we are in- formed that not less than 50,000 dollars changed hands on this occasion. As an instance of the excitement which prevailed, we would cite an incident that occurred under our own ob- servation. An honorable disciple of Esculapius who is doing a small bu- siness in the curative line among the native population, was on the ground, and happened to take a fancy to the mare. He staked all the | cash he had-the proceeds of many a pill and blister-his horse and then his cloak, and when last we saw him, he was bantering the yenta to stake his hat upon the mare. On Friday, the 2nd April, a race of scarcely less interest and importance came off on the Wolf- skill land, about a mile below the city, be- tween the American horse " Bear Meat" and the American mare " Nubbins," the principal stake being four hundred head of cows a side, and the distance four hundred yards. The mare came in about ten feet ahead , but judg- ing from the way the horse had gained on the mare in the last twenty jumps, had the distance been a hundred yards further, victory would have been decided in favour of Bear Meat - Los Angeles Star. QUARANTINE STATION - A substantial flag- staff, nearly 50 feet in height, has been just erected, by the Colonial Architect, on the iso- lated point to the westward of the quarantine ground, and we believe it is intended to place a sentry on the spot, which is well adapted for a look-out station, as it completely com- mands the quarantine ground and boats can be easily warned to keep off the large yellow flag was hoisted on Thursday morning for the first time, in lieu of the miserable rag which lately fluttered in the breeze, and it can be dis- cerned at a great distance. We regret to state that there are still a few of the immigrants per David M'Ivor, confined to the spot, but everything that can be done for their comfort and convenience has been effected by Captain Browne, the Immigration Agent, by whose di- rection the new flagstaff has been erected, to warn Sydney folks and others, who have been in the habit of frequenting the beautiful spot, that they must go else where to enjoy them- selves. POLICE -The Inspector-General of Police has given notice in Friday's Government Ga- zette, that the constabulary force for the police district of Drayton, in the pastoral district of Darling Downs, is fully organised. POLICE OFFICE.-The sitting magistrates on Friday were Alderman Egan, Mr. Ronald, Mr. Chambers, and Mr. Fitzgerald.

Mr. Egan, in accepting the present, briefly but appropriately acknowledged the kindness which he had uni- formly received during his official connexion '¡'ith tko Police depai tment, and which had prompted this unprecedented expression of good will. He lind made it the study of his life to discharge his duty in such a manner as should give satisfaction, and he was proud to to believe that in this he had entirely suc- ceeded. The watch is inscribed as follows : - "Presented to John Piper Egan, Esq., asa token of esteem and regard, by the Police Magistrate and Clerks in the Police Office, Sydney, 12th June, 1852."
