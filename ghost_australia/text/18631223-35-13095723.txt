I THE KEAN PERFORMANCES. in - The most important character in the tragedy of ' Blaubath." is Lady Macbeth That bane of Cawdor, though a brave man, is so weak and indecisive In his resolutions, whether of good or evil, that as compared with his wife he is almost contemptible If Nero was a tyrant and a cold-blooded murderer, he set commanded a large amount of question- able respect from his very fierceness and indomitable will, but Macbeth, was presented to us by Shakspere, though, cruel, possesses a mind as varying and unstable as the) wind Lady Macbeth, on the other hand, is the moving spirit of the whole action of the tragedy She seizes on the helm of her husband s fate, and guides it at her pleasure. His inclinations tend towards ambitions projects, and great- ness continually haunts, his thoughts, but he is kept in the eddy of vacillation and thus lots " I dare not wait upon I would " It is therefore a very natural conclusion to suppose that, were it not for his wife, whose influence over him is so complete that she bends him like a reed to her will, M Macbeth would have lived an envious man, and died a Thane, but in the hand of this ambitious and strong minded woman, he is made the medium, by which. si e rises to power. The murder of Ban quo truly originated with Macbeth, but his imagination is be wrought upon by reflecting on the deed, that in the banquet scene he gives way to superstitious horror, and sets his guests wondering; at his strange behaviour, and the still more strange words that fall from his lips Here Lady Macbeth again comes to the rest cure as it were, finds a plausible excuse for his ravings and finally exercises her authority in bringing her husband to a sense of his, to her apparent weakness The character of Lady Macbeth is the highest type of tragedy, beside which Medea is insignificant The terrible con- stancy of determination nay, the absolute character of the woman is given by herself when upbraiding Macbeth for his infirmity of purpose I have given sue and know How tender 'is, to love the babe that milks me, I would, while it was smiling in my face, Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums, And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you Have done to this It was thus thinking that we alluded particularly, in yesterday a letter, to Mrs Kean's impersonation of Lady Macbeth at the same time we believe Mr Kean's concep- tion of Macbeth is correct, and so far as it is possible to make it a worthy performance The scenes in which ha appears most prominently are the murder of Duncan, the grand banquet, and the period immediately preceding his destruction. In all these parts Mr Kean was quite equal to the passions that assail Macbeth lbs interview with the witches, was a calm expression of wonderment at their seeming foreknowledge, and it is not until Young Malcolm is nominated Prince of Cumberland that the effect of the we itches' prophecy becomes conspicuous, to which great effect is given by Mr. Kean's sudden changed manner, The dagger scene," as it is familiarly called, was bJbo well gone through, and suggested the idea of a distempered mind with horrible imaginings, even when conscious of the unreality of the vision, and that it is the ' business that informs thus to his eyes, the unfortunate hane seems in a stupor of fear and trembling, the scene which follows this, is the most elaborately worked out of any in the play, and altogether new to a colonial audience 'The desperation of Macbeth is subdued and when be essay e from the chamber with the daggers, la j face and fruits betray the horror with which the murder has filled him There are no unexpected outburst the sense of guilt is too strong for that, the passions in the soul are breathed out as if there were listeners at every point, and the knocking at the gate ettrtleB him as if u were some fearful summons, his was certainly the finest delineation by Mr Kean throughout the tragedy, and it created in the audience a deep, and we think permanent impression In the banquet scene his dissolute indifference of the murder of Banquo, whom he pledges in the wine cup, is finely con- trasted with the raving which immediately follows when confronted by the ghost of his victim in the second interview with the witches there was too much of business in it -as a celebrated critic once observed of John Kemble, " he maintains his ground too steadily against fate and metaphysical aid. In the later scenes Mr Kean displayed great energy. There was a deep retrospective melancholy" in the delivery of the lines " My way of life has fallen into the sere, the yellow leaf And that which should accompany old age, As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends I must not look to have " And, on learning the death of his wife, his heart seems great as he exclaims, " She should have died hereafter.' as before observed, Lady Macbeth is the great character of this tragedy-and Mrs Kean's impersonation is grand in the extreme. The reading of the letter is itself a perfect study, but the manner in which she works upon the mind of her husband is a wondrous effort of consummate art The terrible desire she expresses that " those spirits that tend on mortal thoughts may unsex me here, and fill me from the crown to the the top full of direst cruelty," is fearful in the intensity with which the passage was delivered The searching enquiry, when Macbeth informs her that " Duncan comes here to night," " And when goes he hence I" was unmistakable in its import, but the tragic fire which bursts forth in her indignation at the supineness of bec weak minded husband as she exclaims " What beast was it, then, That made you break this enterprise to mc ? cannot, be expressed in words it was appalling and sublime carried through to the dread scene when D uno in is killed Her soliloquy while Macbeth is about the deed, in startling for its cool hissing, and unearthly atrocity, giving to the mind of the fine.; day for an impulse that remains long after the finish of the play the contrast between the husband and wife in thin engine is more vivid than that in any other While the former is " distilled almost to a jelly with the act of fear," the other is firm as marble and as impenetrable to all the dictates of humanity a point which is strongly brought out in the circumstance that, though this cruel woman could not herself murder the King, because he resembled her father as he lay,'' still the sought his death with the most persevering determination, and literally smeared her hands in his blood On the close of the banquet scene the dia qmetuOe she evinced at the ravings of Macbeth is perfectly natural, and the dismissal of the guests at first in irrita- tion, and then with a graceful good night to all" breathing a spirit of conciliation, was a very fine point. i In the sleeping scene Mrs Kean produced a great impres ' sion, it was so different to what is usually seen on the colonial stage She comes hurriedly in with her eyes open, but it is the sleep walker that is before us. Her lips move involuntarily the motion of washing out the blood stain on the hand is truly mechanical, and she repeats the action until the eye becomes wearied, but yet it must look, and the long drawn sigh makes one shudder I with dread The great actress was before us-it needed not the exclamations to prove to her attendant that the mind is charged with a fearful remorse She hushed the audience into the silence of death, and held it in breathless expectation It was, indeed, a splendid performance, and one the equal of which will not, after the departure of Mrs Kean, be seen again in these colonies for many years to come She personified tragedy. The dresses worn by Mr and Mrs Kean are not the least interesting feature, they have been carefully studied, and are both very beautiful, the ancient shield and spear also hold prominent position. The other characters were well sustained, if we except Macdhui! Mr Cathcart possesses every physical qualification to make a good actor he is scrupulously correct in his parts, and has a good voice but, unfortunately, he loses all command over voice and action in Macduff, and destroys the character, We allude to this gentleman in good feeling, because it is to be regretted that so many material advantages are not more carefully treated. Locke's music to Macbeth was performed by the chorus of the Opera Company, with Mr F. Lyster as Hecate. We admire this maRie very much, and it was remarkably well sung both solo and choruses but somehow or other it seems to interfere with the play itself Perhaps our old fashioned ideas are wrong, and a little music relieves the gloomy incidents, but we must confess to a partiality for the old style of performing Macbeth without the music Yesterday evening an immense audience assembled within the theatre, the occasion being the benefit of Mrs. Kean Kotzebue's play, " The Stranger," was produced, in which the part of Mrs Hollier was sustained by Mrs. Kean. Although a popular piece, we must confess to a thorough dislike for it from first to last. The Stranger and his runaway wife may both excite pity, but the plot of the events can be said to rise to that dignity-is only one of the many of those cases which have occupied the Divorce Court of England in the Wonder," Mr. Kean as Con Felix, and Mrs. Kean as Violante, delighted the audience by their excellent acting. This evening the tragedy of "Macbeth" will be repeated. ??MHaM^MvmMamaMMBaaaaVHBMVBOTaBaaasi^^Ba Destructive HiiLSTOiuf.-We have just had a hailstorm of a very severe character, which did serious damage to many parts of this district.
