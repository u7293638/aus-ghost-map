ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. THE COALBAGGIE MYSTERY. (To the Editor of the Dubbo Dispatch.) Sir,â€” For some time past I have noticed reference in your columns re the "Coalbaggie Ghost," and until your issue of the 1st instant I thought that it was possible that there might be something of more than ordinary interest in same. But since reading your issue of above date, I should like you to explain (If possible) the following discrepancy, viz : " on another occasion a big mouse, a foot long" (why not call it a rat) ? As for calling it a wallaby or kangaroo leave alone a bear. Why was not an ounce of cold load fired instead of a couple of dogs easily frightened off. I may also state that it appears quite natural that a person of the above calibre, viz. (the ghost) should take away the man's tools that he is working with, and plant same, but unless in connivance with ghosts the strangest part is that the said workman should be able to find his tools when wanted. I must also state that it appears very strange that the "ghost" not only asserts its utlity right to torment said occupants but ew'J yd of its (the ghost's) assertion ffMCJTg" right to haunt them (the present occupiers) wherever they go. Possibly the post may answer for this. Yours faithfully, BOOMLEY.
