'That is a sweet good latter, a lovely love letter, deac father,' aaidlfet, gravely ; ?? but yon know/* she added, slowly— 'you know tbat I cannot accept hia invitation. I cannot go to his hotwe. It would look like a desire to force myself on Adrian.' 'We wOi talk of tbat presently, my dear. No need for you to decide at once. It would be better in a worldly point of view that yon should go. It would atop the tongues of all caviller*. I appreciate your delicate rcruples, Net, but you must not be guided by feeling, my dear, but by. reason, and by the counsels of those who are older and more experienced than your self. Sir Adrian's letter is a good and wise one. We most reflect a little before we reject it* counsels,' replied tna rector. 'Father, will you read Adrian's letter now P' inquired Net, seeing that the rector made no motion even to open hia. ' Oh ! I had forgotten ; but really I don't suppose the fellow's communication is of much account,' replied Dr. Starr, as he opened the envelope and read as follows : Tuntua Chase, 2nd. Sept., 18—. Rev. Db. Stabb, — My Bear Sir : I write to you because I dare not write to Net. I dare not say one word in self-defence. No one can feel more certainly than I do that I am indefensible. I made an unhappy blunder in my marriage, yet my father thinks I ought to abide by it. Perhaps I ought. Bnt let me ask you frankly, in the interests of your daughter, oould I do her a deeper injury than to take her to wife while my affections and desires are fixed upon her cousin? No, 'you will confess that I could not. I like, esteem and honour your daughter, but I could not lore her as my wife. I will do anything and everything cite in my power to prove the high estimation in which : hold her. My father and mother have invited her to fleming Chase. I pray you let her go there and make it a permanent home while my parents live, and, after they shall have passed away, let her continue to live and reign -in their place as Lady Deloraine. As for myself I shall never enjoy the blessing of home or family ; but the world is wide, and its attractions many. I pray that you and your daughter may pardon me for any pain that I may- have inadvertently caused you, knowing that my own pain must be equally great, and believe me, notwith standing aU that has come and gone, ever your friend, ATraTAfT Fleming. ' Poor boy !' sighed Net. ' Oh, father, is there no lawful way of releasing him from his bonds?' ' No, Net, there is none without a public scandal that would be intolerable.' ' It is very hard on him,' sighed Net. ' And on you, then ?' ' It is very hard indeed,' assented Net. 'The only remedy is time and patience. Wo must wait, Net. And, meanwhile, I wish you could bring yourself to accept Sir Adrian's invitation.' ' Bat Ioannot, dear father. I could not even if I had no ties, no duties to bind me here, and I have, for I could not leave the babies.' 'And you could not taVe them. Well, we will not answer Sir Adrian's letter to* day. We will wait until to-morrow. Per haps by that time you may see things in a different light, and something may be thought of for the babies. They are over four years old now, you know,' eaid the rector, as he folded his letters and put them in a compartment of his table-drawer marked ' Unanswered-11 Asd these letters were destined to remain unanswered to the end. 11 Now. I must walk out and see some of my people,' eaid the doctor, rising. He took two steps towards the door, threw his hands up suddenly to his head, and fell heavily to the ground. With a Blight cry Net sprang to his Bide, and stooped to help him get up. for she thought that he had only tripped iu the loose rug aad fallen. At the same moment, Mrs. Ken and Kit alarmed by the unusual noise, ran in from the kitchen, asd Miss Deloraine came in from the parlour. ' What's the matter P' ' Wet hev happened f' 'Wot'a broke?' demanded the excited questioners iu one voice, n they gathered round the prostrate man, who gave no sign of .consciousness. 'Hun for toe doctor, Kit!' exclaimed Net, controlling her own emotion by a strong effort ' Tell him to came instantly ! Father is stunned by hia fall — don't you see? Oh! he tripped in the rug. and fell with all his weight, you see, Antoinette 1' Bhe added, turning to the pale and anxious girl who stood by her side. ' I see,' answered Miss Deloraine, in an awe-stricken tone; for, in fact, she eaw more than Net did. *' Let us try to lift him to the lounge, Mrs. Ken. Oh, Antoinette, please go and get a pillow,' she continued, turning her pain-stricken eyes from one to another. ' You had better let me help you to lift him first. You and Mrs. Ken can never do it alone,' replied Miss Deloraine. The three women lifted the body of the rector, and laid it on the lounge. Then Antoinette ran to fetch a pillow, while Net and Mrs. Ken used each simple remedies as were at hand for his restora tion. 'Oh, lira. K«n, hia pulse has stopped! It has stopped! What is the meaning of Lhatr* anxiously demanded Net, as Bhe held her father'eumotionlesa wrist between her fingers. ' Mayhap it's just a fainty fit, Mistress Net. Dunnot yo be soared. Wait till the doctor comes,' replied the woman, in the shaking tones that contradicted her words and betrayed her own agitation. Antoinette came in with the pillow, and they raised and laid the reotor'a head upon 'Ob, Antoinette! his heart does not beat! It ia at still as— as—the dead!' 4-ri--ll Nfifc. in n. t/ina nf nncrniaVi as ntia drew her hand from hia bosom, and looked up iu her friend's face with an expression of agonised entreaty. 'Oh, Antoioette! what is the reason? What ia the reason ? He ia not— not dead?' This last word came in a sharp cry. ' Hush, dear ! Hush ! Here is thedoctor,' whispered Mies Deloraine, as Dr. Bennet entered the room. ' I met your servant a few yards from the gate, my dear,' aaid the physician, as he took Net's hand, bowed to Miaa Deloraine, and passed at once to the side of the lounge where the form of the rector lay. All the others drew back to give way for the doctor, who proceeded to make a very careful examinatiou. of his subjeot, while Net watched him anxiously from a ehott distanoa. Presently tbe doctor oeaaed his inveetiga tion, dosed the afairt bosom, vest and coat over the lifeless body, composed the motion* ieas limbs, and tamed away from die lounge. 'Doctor— doetor— ' began Net, in a voioa balftf ainting with tear. » My dear girl— joo are a good girl,' said Doctor Bennet, gently taking Netfajhaaria in both bU own-»yott know that thislita a notall,uid— * ??O*,***#om» Vsfvme.'Oal I Cannot shrill tones of uumirli, as she fell back against the wall cf the study and leaned there, weepiac Utterly— lor the grief of youth ianevaraomb,lmt«T-cflttdaieady relief in copious tears. The old doetor put his arm round her waist, and led her tenderly to as easy-chair and plated her in ft. Antoinette sat down beside her and took her hand; bat neither the physician nor the friend attempted to utter any words of eon* eolation ; that, they knew, at aueh a moment must be worse than useless. They let her weep and sob until the storm of sorrow had exhausted its force. And then it was wonderful to see how quickly Net rallied her forces and how calmly she went about her duties. Dr. Bennet took upon himself the whole responsibility of the crisis. He it was who wrote to Hiss Deloraine's second guardian and solicitor in London to apprize him of hia colleague's deoease, aad also to Sir Adrian Fleming, in Devonshire, to announce to him his old friend's death. He it was who gave all the orders for the funeral. As coon as the demise of the pastor became inwsttBiv *«? -eVsV« ttawiali iiwn — ??? 4%*T /hiai^Iw ?a-a*ww«ma a-aa- ots*» yew, asan v*,wvr«iD va. *i-*nu-uj y sympathetic and sorrowing people flocked to the parsonage with expressions of condole ment and offers of service. The reotor'a litttle daughter gratefully, acoepted all the love that prompted all the action, but gently declined the services. There was nothing to be done, she aaid but what she and the household oould do. The funeral was arranged to take place on Saturday, the fifth day after the death. It was on the third day that Net was sit ting in the nursery, with little Luke and Ella, trying to make them understand the great mystery of the change that seems so marvellous, yet is so simple — that seems so like death, but is new birth — and she was finding euthowmuchmore readily thechildren could receive and understand the troth than she could convey and explain it, when she was interrupted by the unceremonious, en trance of Kit o' Jim, who put a card in her hand, anil announced : 'Atallowld gent'man, foine and grand, hev come to see yo, Mistress Net, aud is waiting in the 'all down stairs.' Net looked at the slip of pasteboard be tween her thumb and finger, and read — Sir A drian Fleming. 'Show the gentleman into the drawing' rcom, Kit, and say to him that I will be down in a few moments,' sha said, as she arose to make a little change in her drees. Kit left the room to do her errand. ? Net only smoothed her front hair, ad justed her neat, white collar and cuffs, and then ehe went down stairs and opened the parlour door. She saw standing before her a tall, soldierly-looking man of about sixty years of age, with broad shoulders, well set back, stately bead, high, aquiline features, florid Complexion, bright blue eyas, and silvery white hair and moustache. He wore a black frock coat, buttoned up to his chin, dark gray pantaloons, and neat patent leather boots onBinaUand well-shaped feet. Holding out email and ne&tly-gloved; hands, he advanced to meet Net, and taking hers, eaid, gently and gravely : ' You are my daughter-in-law, I presume, young lady.' Net looked np in some little embarrass ment, but could not speak jnst then. ' You are Mrs. Adrian Fleming, if I mis take not ?' then said the baronet, a little doubtfully, for Net's silence puzzled him with uncertainty. ' I am Dr. Starr's step-daughter— Net,' replied the girl, gathering courage from the calm, kind eyes tbat gazed down upon her. ' rxewseiy. v^uire so. j ust as x tnougnc. I am very happy to eeeyou, my child, even though grieved by the occasion that has brought me here,' said tbe baronet, still holding her hand. *' It was very kind oi you to come, sir,' murmured Net. ' I could do so otherwise. It was my duty to you, dear child, no less than to my departed friend, Dr. Starr. He was my college chum and oldest living friend, dear girl, and so, as soon as I got Bennet'e letter, with the sad news of Luke's death, I took the first train North.' ' I thank you very much for coming. Sir Adrian, but pray be seated,' eaid Net, drawing forward a large easy-chair. The baxonet dropped heavily into its cushions, and then inquired : ' Whom have you in the house, my dear, to look after affairs?' ' No one but myself, my cousin, and the two servant-women ; but Dr. Bennett comes every day end attends to everything.' ' Ah ! ah ! it was very sudden,' said the baronet, referring to the death of the rector. *' Yes, very sudden,' replied Net, fully understanding him. ' Apoplexy ?' inquired the baronet. 'No— heart disease, the doctor said,' replied Net, beginning to tremble, for as yet sho could not bear any allusion to her father's death without strong emotion. ' There, there- — I have been inconsid erate, my child ! Let us change the sub ject. What are your plans for the future, my dear, if you have formed any?' in quired the baronet, with every expression of warm interest. 'I have formed — none. I have not thought of any,' said Net, speaking with difficulty. 'So much the better, my dear. You will leave others who are older and mbro ex perienced to plan for you,' said the baronet, expressing the same idea, if not using the same words, that had been spoken on this subject by the rector. Net bowed, not in assent, but in courtesy, because she could reply in no other way. ' Your father got my letter, I hope ?' Net bowed again, and, with an effort, uttered faintly : ' An hour before he was stricken down.' '* My child, I can do little to assuage your grief for this heavy bereavement — a grief which, indeed, I share ; but you will let me shield you from the material consequences of your loss. I came here not only to attend the funeral of my old friend, but also to take you back with me to Fleming Chase, where Lady Fleming will give you a warm welcome.' 'You and her ladyship are very, very good to me, sir — very, .very good, even though my own stupid and lamentable mis take has placed ' — here die voice of the girl was choked for a moment, but she recovered it and resumed—' your son in such a false position. I — ' She broke down asrain. The baronet, who- was sitting nearly oppo site to her, stooped down and took both her hands, saying kindly : ' My dear child, the blunder was my son's own, and you were the victim. He knows that as well as we do. Sometunea men blunder into good fortune. Their blunders bring thorn better results than their best laid plans could secure — only in that case they tto not call them^blunders, you know. I think my sou has blundered into his life's happiness. We will wait and see, dear Setty}' ' Yon arc very, very good to me.' It was only a repetition, but it was aS the deeply-moved girl oould find to say. «« In the meantime, my love, you will oome and make your home with Lady flooring and kindness to me, Sir Adrian, but I cannot have fine happiness you offer me,' replied Net, with meek firmness. The baronet looked at her in silent surprise for a moment, and then inquired : ' But what do you mean by your words, my dear? Why can you not have and— confer this happineeaf' 'I have two little children, Sir Adrian,' calmly replied Net. ' ? Two— little-children- f ' slowly re peated the baronet, eyeing the young creature before him, with a sort of dismayed in credulity. ' Why— yon oould not have been a widow, when my son married you I Nothing to that effect was told me ! Two little children ! Lord, bless my soul alive, it seems perfectly preposterous ! You are too young, you know !' The very ghost of a smile flitted over the wan face of little ' mammam,' aa she an swered: 'They are the twins, Luke and Ella, children of my dear step-father by his second marriage.' 'Oh! Ah! Yes! I see! To be sure!' ex claimed the baronet, with a look of relief. 'They are now about four years old. I iave had the core of them all their lives. Their mother passed away the day that they were bom,' continued Net, in explanation. Precisely ! Just so ! They are the chil dren of your step-father by his second wife, and of not the least blood-relationship to yourself?' 'No, but that does not make the least difference. I love them just as well as if they were my very own. And they know no other mother than myself,' replied Net, as the tears of a vague apprehension rose to her eyes. 'Tut, tut, my dear girl, you are a good juij uuii juu uoa t Know wnac you are talking about. These children of my old friend, children of his old age, must be well cared for ; but they must not be millstones about your neck to spoil your life. There is an excellent home in my neighbourhood for the orphan children of clergymen of the Church of England where they can be placed, and where they may be brought up and educated to become teachers — governesses, if they happen to be girls ; tutors, or curates, if boys. I will see the children of my dear friend entered there. It is the best disposition that can be made of them. So that obstacle will be removed from your path, my dear, aud I hope you will be ready to return with me to Fleming Chase, immediately after the funeral,', eaid the baronet, as he arose from his seat. ' I thank you very much for all your kind intentions towards me, Sir Adrian,' replied Net, very courteously, but quite noncom mittingly. She was filled with dismay at the proposition of the baronet to send her babies to the Orphan Asylum. She felt too much agitated to combat his resolutions at this instant ; but she was resolved never to con sent that the little ones, dear to her as if they had been her very own, should be separated from her to be placed in any charitable institution ; yet she reflected that she was but a minor, and she wondered with fear whether the baronet, or any other responsi ble man who should take it upon himself, might' not have the power to dispose of these orphan children aa he and ' the court ' ' might see fit. So disturbed was little 'mammam' by these thoughts that all Bhe could do was only to answer the baronet in the courteous, non committal words we have recorded. 'Now, my dear, I will bid you good morning,' said Sir Adrian, holding out his hand. 'No, pray do not go. I thought — I hoped that you would stay here while you should remain in the neighbourhood. Let me show you to your room,' taid Net, hospitably, rising to perform the duty that there was no man-servant in the house to do for her. ' My dear, you are very good, but I did not expect to etay here, and I have left my luggage at tbe Dolphin.' ' Let me send the Etable-boy for it, sir. I beg you will not go.' 'Well, well, as you please, my dear. Perhaps it is best that I should be here to look after you,' said the baronet ; and he took his tablets from his pockets, wrote a few lines on them, tore out the leaf, and handed it to' Net, adding : ' Yon will please to send this order to my valet, at the Dolphin, and he will bring my effects.' Net took the leaf, and went out to give it to Peter Ken to deliver. Then she^returnei to the parlour aud re newed her offer to ahow her visitor to his room. ' I have been here before, my dear— in the bachelor daye of my late friend — and I know something about this rambling house. If you will tell me where the room is I prefer to find it myBelf.' '* It is the chamber st tbe head of the stairs on the left hand, directly above this.' '? The very one I occupied twenty years ago. I cannot miss it,' eaid the baronet, as he walked out of the room. The next day Mr. James Flint, junior partner in the firm of Flint Brothers, attor* neys-at-law, who, besides managing Miss Deloraine's estate, transacted all tbe late rector's legal businese, came down to Miston, to remain until after the f aneral, and look after ;the interests of his ward. net, wno was consuming wun anxiety on account of her babies, took the first oppor tunity of seeking a private interview with Mr. James Flint, to set before him the following case, which ehe put in a very few words : ' I hive had the sole care of my baby brother and sister ever since they were born. Now they are four years old, and I am eighteen. We are aU orphans and minors. But I am even more capable of taking care of them now than I ever was before, and they have no relative or friend on earth but myself. Now, can anyone take them away from me asd place them ia an orphan asylum or elsewhere without my con sent ?' 11 In ordinary circumstances any respon sible *tn«n or woman, acting as the ? next friend of the orphans, might, with the consent of the court, do so. But have no fears on this score, my dear young lady ; the children cannot be removed from your charge without your oonsant, except, indeed through the aetion of one person, who is not likely to interfere, I should say.' 'And that person?' inquired Net, some what relieved, but still uneasy. ' Your husband,' replied the attorney, in a low tone. ' He is not indeed likely to trouble himself about us,' thought Net, with a eigh. ?? TaiV*. AltA aIsa ?anil 1*«bwa wwttBA* #a JleninWh -Mw wwv vwh ntu ?Hssjvs? a#w«ew* «rw vasvaatHSk-v you in the charge of the children.' ' But— how do you know that, Mr. James?' inquired Net, speaking in her great anxiety with unintentional rudeness. *' I have the will of your late guardian and stop-fattier. And although I am not at liberty to disclose the terms of that will before it shall have been opened publicly after the funeral, yet I may assure yon of this, tbat no one except the one person who is least likely to interfere can disturb you in tbe possession of your children, or dispose of them without your consent. Bat, my dear young lady, jt ask you, in your own interests, now do yon propose to support them?' ??I do not know. I have new thought about tbat yet, but I know tshtll to able to taka earn of my babies somehow? mumtnL who had never known a real want, or had any experience in the great difficulty some people have in being permitted to work for a living. ' Time is an opening towards a fortune for you, my deac young lady. Your late step-father mast have told yon the object of his journey to London—' M Tee, yea— say no more about that, I beg you 1' exclaimed Net, hastily interrupting the lawyer. ** I would never advance a el4na that, however legal it asay to, is ewtaioly unjust, and I eovid not enjoy any fortune tbat must come at the expense of a greater calamity to another.' 'Then let the matter rest for the preenat. It may to that at some fature time you may view it in a different light.' Here tto interview closed. On the following day tto funeral-' of Dr. Starr took plaoe. AU the neighbourhood, of every age, rank sad aest, attended, for the rector was much beloved by all who knew him. The venerable Earl of Altofaire aroused himself front the apathy of age and sorrow and came in his family carriage, supported in hii seat by his valet. The Cavbs. who had latelv returned to Gaveland, arrived iu their old-fashioned coach. The Beandevsre family were absent from the neighbourhood, and indeed from the country, but the baron's bailiff took it upon himielf to send the family coach to go in the funeral procession, knowing that by so doing he would express the friendship of hia employer towards the deceased minister end hit household. A minlitar from Carlisle read the imprej sive burial service. After the obsequies were all over, the mal. titade dispersed, with tbe exception of a few of the most intimate friends, who returned with the bereaved daughter and children to the rectory, to be present at the reading of the will. Amors these were Sir Adrian Flemins. Mr. Coyle and Mr. Brandon Coyle, Dr. Bennet, Rev. Mr. Cometock, and, of course, Mr. James Flint. Some of these friends, hearing that there was a will, wondered why on earth the restor had ever thought it necessary to make one, seeiog that he had little or nothing to leave. The will wsB read by Lawyer Flint, in the dining-room of the rectory, and in the pre sence of the family, friends, and servants. It needs but a passing notice. Ia it the testator, first of all, constituted his ward and step-daughter of full legal age, and left to her his whole property in trust for the use of his own children, appointing her the tole guardian of his children and the sole executrix of bis will. This caused a great deal of criticism among tbe hearers. ' Lord blese my soul alive ! I never heard of auoh a thing in the whole coarse of my life ! A girl of suoh a tender age to be left with such a burden and responsibility ! If he were not my own old college chum I Bbould say the rector had been demented '.' hotly exolaimed the baronet, seeing how seriously this will would be likely to interfere with his own plans and prospects in regard to little mammam and her babies. 'I tell you, Sir Adrian, that young girl is better fitted to discharge the duties im posed upon her than most women, or men, either, of any age whatever ! She has been the mistress of the rectory and the guardian of these children since her fourteenth year, and Bhe has filled her responsible post with consummate ability t ? I know it, and can testify to it, if necessary,' answered Dr. Bennet. ' Perhaps, sir, you were in the confidence and counsels of the late rector,' said the baronet, a little sarcastically. ' It is very true ; I was. Dr. Starr con sulted me about this same will. I advised him as to the very course he has pursued,' coolly replied the doctor. 'A very unwise course, sir! This will was, besides, made before the marriage of my daughter-in-law, Mrs. Adrian Fleming. As a parried woman she is incapacitated for the functions imposed upon her by this will,' retorted the baron. ' I fancy th6re ia no one bnt her husband to bring forward that objection, and he, I think, is absent on foreign travel. Good-day, Sir Adrian. I have to leave rather abruptly, for a doctor's time is not his own,' said the pbyaiclan, bowing low, and leaving the room. Most of the company were also departing. When the room was nearly clear, Sir Atrian went up to Net and said : \--My dear, aa -toon as you can get free from theae people, come to me ia the study. I want to epeak to you there.' 41 Very well, sir, I will go,' replied Net, who saw that the Coyles were approaehiag to take leave of her. Old Mr. Coyle merely took her hand aud wrung it iu silent sympathy, but wrung it so hard that Net had nearly cried out with pain. Mr- Brandon Ctyle took her fingers and held them in a limp and languid way, bend ing over them, and murmuring : ' It is sad to have to condole with yqu on the death of your beloved stepfather, before I have bad the opportunity of congratulating you on your marriage.' ' Thanks, Mr. Coyle, but both are quits un necessary, I assure you,' coldly replied Nat, who always instinctively shrank from the dark, handsome, serpentine Brandon. Coyle bowed ceremoniously aad turned away. These two were the last departures. Then Net went into the library, where the baronet sat in the old leathern chair that had once been the rector's familiar seat, and at tbe old writing-table npon which the rector's sermons had all been written. It gave Net a passing pang to see another eittiog there. ' Come in, my dear. I have much to say to you. Sit dawn beside me here,' said the baMnet, rising, and leading the girl to a chair near his own. Net sat down and waited. Too well ehe knew what was coming next. ' This will of your late step-father and guardian, my dear, was a very unwise oae, if you will permit me to say so,' began tbe baronet. ' My dear father was an eminently wise and good man,' said Net, in generous defence of the departed. 'Yes, yes, gooi, moat certainly ! emin ently good, as you eay,' assented the baronet, in a conciliating tone, ' and wise very wise in— ah— moat respects ! But the wisest are liable to make mistakes. Your late father has made a serious one in im posing upon a girl so youn% aud inex perienced as yourself so onerous a respon sibility as the charge of those children.' (To bh continued.)
