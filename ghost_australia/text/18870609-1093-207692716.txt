The Yanjarrie G frost. A rather new complexion has been put by the police authorities upon the so- called ghostly manifestations at Yanyarrie, They apparently regard them a9 an attempt to turn the super stitious feelings of ordinary human nature to a prosaic practical account, for they have laid informations in the Ham mond Police Court against the members of the Hamdorf family, charging them under clause 63 of the Police Act with having at tempted to impose upon Mounted- constables Thomas and Shegog and other persons by pre tending to hold conversation with the spirit of a deceased person by means of mysfirious knockings, upon their leasehold premises in the hundred of Moockra, with a view of depre ciating the value of the land, which, being held under lease from the Crown, had become liable to forfeiture. This places a very different view upon the. ghostly distur bances which have rendered people in that district rather unwilling to have anything to do with the Hamdorf a' property, to any hitherto set forth, and will perhaps have a rather un expected result for the mediums. The clause of the Act under which they are charged enacts in sub-section 4: "Every person pretending to tell fortunes, or using any subtle craft, means, or device, by palmistry or otherwise, to deceive and impose upon any of her Majesty's subjects" .... " shall be liable to imprisonment in any gaol in the said province, with or without hard labor, for any time not exceeding three calendar months." The case against the defendants will probably come on for hearing at Hammond before the local justices of the peace on Wed nesday next.
