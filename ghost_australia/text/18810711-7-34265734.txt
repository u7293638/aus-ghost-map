It is not often that On patient watchers whose duty it is to look oat for the rnafl steamer at Glenelg are caught tripping, but on Sunday morning tbay were found befogged if they were not discovered napping, for tbe B—IS. Vbhbtia glided like a ghost ont of tbe base between 3 and 4 o'clock on Sunday morning, and did it so quietly tbat abe waa not noticed tall handy at ber berth. Oonseqoently she iraa not received With tba aud honors, bat was at anchor before the Mermaid woite to action. It waa nobrtdy-e fault at Holdfast Bay, aad probably not any one's error st Oape Bards, She was aot sig nalled ftom the Oape, although she paaaed aboat a quarter to 7 oo Satarday night. Aa to the sute of the atmosphere opinions differ, nantaeal talent being notoriously variable— aome aaid it wss baity urn anything,'* others ttat it was dear as crystal, and that blue light* mute bats* by aba Venatia as abe paaaed Urn lighthouse. Xhcre was a dne moon, Vat at tUaoslg tben was a baas, or tbs -ttfimihln SMold bare beea age* sooner. Mr. Harttor pasterD>*wsil-*rwfco.bytiis way, has had his man retrenched by Gorarnment eoonomy aud j now baa to do double duty, working all day and watching all night—saw the steamer and roused all hands for boarding between 3 and 4 ajn. The Mermaid was soon waking the silence of the morning with her steam whistle, and when she approached the Venetia, it looked as if all hands but the watch bad turned in for the Sunday anooxe, so quiet did everything seem. By the handy way in which the steamship had been piloted into her berth near the craft doing duty for the ex patriated hoik, it was evident that some one not new to Glenelg was on board, and it turned out that more than one familiar form waa there, some of the officers and the engineer having been here in other P. & O. boats. There were over fifty mail bags, and these were soom put on board the Fairy and aent up to town by a special engine. Mr. Allen, the manager of the Bsllway Company, had a carriage waiting for passenajers. but none showed up at that unseasonable hour. Thi Vesetia is a skraight«temmed barque-tigged vet?el, not unlike the Cathay and tlvdaspes. She towered very high oat of the water—seem ing light in draught—and seen stem oa appeared very lofty in the hull and narrow for her length. Her tonnage is, 2,785, and she was built about the year 1673 by Denny Brothers, of Dumbarton. Her length is 361 feet, net beam 88 feet, and she is 600 horse-power. She has just hada complete ovethaol.and has had new boilers put in. She has been tunning in the fn^liax China, and Venice lines until recently, when she was aent home for overhaul, and pnt on tie Australian trade. Her internal fittings are substantial, plain, and suitable, being in no respect inferior to or much different from the Hjdaspes. Her average rate of spaed in the run has been about 18jf knots, and the weather experienced has been fine on the whole. The gf&rrr;* «ay the voyage has been as ooereatfal as a month in gaol, and aa mild as a temperance lecture. The Venecia left Calcutta on June 14, and reached Point de Galleon the 83rd, sailing same day. When she got into the trades there was little of them to make available, and it was not fall the veaael was in Ist 27" S.that she fell in with anything like a smart bteeae. She gat to King George's Sound on July 6, and left there same day. The voyage to Glenelg waa a pleaaaat one tor the passengers, the weather being fine, with a beam ass, bat not roach. The Veoetia signalised her arrival ay losing her anchor for a time, but it waa fortunately re covered. It appears that when she came up to her berth the order was given to let go the anchor, but the chain eaUe snapped as the sector, whioc weighs twstona, plunged. *imH«t anchor waa let go at once and the slop was delayed an boor recovering the truant one. The chief officer end the harbor-master, Mr.DagweU, had two boats out, and after some trouble got a strong chain over the flake; lifted the *'\a*\nr and got it to the bows from whence it was soon hove up and atowed. The Veoetia left for Mel bourne at 11 a.m. on Sunday. PUBLIC SHIPPING TELEGRAMS. MACtVnratsxx Bar.—Sailed: July B—Euro, steamer, Adelaide. Waixjjum. — Sailed: July B—Lady Diana, steamer.
