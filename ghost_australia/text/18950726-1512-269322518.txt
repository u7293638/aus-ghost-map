TSie Poeft's- dowser. V THE FORSAKEN FARMHOUSE. Against the wooded hills it stands, Ghost of a dead home, staring through Its broken light on wasted lands Where old time harvest grew. Unploughed, unsovved, bysythe unshorn, The poor forsaken farm fields lie, Once rich and rife with golden corn And pale -green breadths of rye. Of healthful herb and flower bereft, The garden plot no housewife keeps ; Through weeds and tangle only left The snake, its tenant, creeps. A lilac spray, once blossom- clad, Sways bare before the empty rooms, Beside the roofless porch a sad, Pathetic red rose blooms. His track in mound and dust of drouth, . On floor and hearth the squirrel leaves, And in the fireless chimney's mouth His web the spider weaves. The leaning barn about to fall Resounds no more on husking eyes ; No cattle low in yard or stall, No thresher beats his sheeves. So sad; so drear ! It seems almost Some haunting presence makes its signs; That down yon shadowy lane some ghost Might drive his spectral kine !
