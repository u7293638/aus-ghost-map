There was a fair attendance. Tbe ohairman presented the report, which we have already published. Mr. Gkeen, in moving the adoption of the report and balance-sheet, said tbe comparative want of Bucoees during the past half-year had been due to the depression, for the attendances at the entertainment had been regular. Both the ' Ghost of Napoleon' and thefairy fountain had proved very successful. It was clear that certain additions to the entertainment must be made, and during the coutbb of the next lew weeks the directors hoped to change the pro gramme considerably. Tbe question of the reduction of the charge for tbe morning ses sions bad come before the directors, and after consideration it bad been decided to make an alteration so that people could get full value for tbeir money. Although they could nob announce a dividend he thought that the con dition of affaire was satisfactory. (Hear, hear.) Alderman Hagedorx seconded the motion, which was carried.
