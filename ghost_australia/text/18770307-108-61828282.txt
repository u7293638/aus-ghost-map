CONCERT AT ROSEDALE. The Mechanics' Institute concert on Monday evening was very fairly attended and the programme faithfully carried out. The glees were particularly good, and reflected credit on the leader, Mr G. P. Hurren, who has been unceasing in his endeavours to render glees a prominent feature in Rosedale concerts., In the first part, Mr Beattie received a vociferous encore after singing "Juanita," and responded with "Maggie by my side." Miss Shiel was also similarly honoured in the pretty ballad "Silver chimes." T'he duet "Two merry hearts," was also well received. Mr Hurren rendered "'The last rose of summer" with his usual accuracy and good taste, and Mr Baker was very successful with his "Beautiful girls," responding to the encore with " Have you seen the ghost." The following ladies and gentlemen rendered able assistance in the glees, viz., Mrs Thomson, the Misses Hurren, Kelly, A. Rintoul, Sheil, and M. Rintoul; Messrs Baker, Beattie and Philippe. Mrs Whitelaw played the accompaniments throughout with her usual care and efficiency. After an interval, the farce of " My Turn Next" was presented, and went extremely well, the parts being carefilly got up, and acted with correct- ness and esprit. The three ladies - "Lydia," " Cicely," and "Peggy"-were as to the manner born, their toilets unexceptionable, and demeanour expressive, but not too conscious. In short, the farce was a success, as testified by the audience at the fall of the curtain.
