Away up on the bleakest and wildest portion of the North country coast, there stood, at the time of our story, a pile of gray old ruins, known by the name of the Border Watch Tower, because of a tali turret or tower, whioh loomed up above the main structure, and from which, in days gone by, the_ border warriors" were wont to reconnoiter the movements of their enemy. The surrounding country was very bleak and desolate, and the old castle, with its ruined drawbridge, and stagnant moat, and crumbling battle ments, was perhaps the drearieet and moet uncanny old place within the length and breadth of England. For ages it has been utterly deserted,, save by the bate and owls, and the ghosts of the mailed warriors, who used to hold their nightly revels ia its spacious halls. On one side, its gray and mouldy parapets : looked down into the sullen waters of Solway Firth, and on the other hand, outstretched a blighted heath, utterly sterile and verdureless, dotted here and there with dwarfed oaks and black thorn bushes, and bounded b> a ledge of wild,' rocky clifis. Under the base of these extended a gloomy cave, .known among the peasants ac the " Hermit's Cave, and inhabited, bo they asserted, \by a wierd old man, with, fiery eyes and lowing beard, whose life, like that of the Vanderine Jew, was endless ; and who moreover, the übiquity of a TiodoU3 ; appearing under the shadow \a black thorns at one moment, and \up on tho beetling summit of the Sβ in the next. ?c dead of night, the same night on sir last chapter closed, a carriage *Hidly up the broad avenue that ""Kgrim old Watch Tower.

The yoting man set hor feet npon the muddy flag-ttonoo, and drawing her hand through his arm, led h?r along by his aide. .They asoonded the steps and approached the door, where the old woman awaited them with a dim lantern in her hand. At eight of them,'the blood hound uttered a terrible growl, and moved stealthily forward. ' i. ' ? "Doon, ye bruteT-dooa thie minniti I" commanded the old woman. He cowered buck in an instant, and the old woman came forward, her leaden eyea lighting at the sight of Lord Strathspey's face. .?'? ?..;.'' '??,?. ??'. ???.? ? ' ?? ??'? ?'. .; ?," I dinna be sure it was yer lai'rdship," she said, watching him with a curious, eager look, and touching his arm with 1)or withered hand ,?:" but I know it's yereel' how. Yer a braw lad now. 'Tie mony a>. year since mc duld eyes had sight of ye. A braw young laird ye be." ? Lord Angus shook off her hand with an oath,.staring at her in amazement. . " Hush your gibber, will youl" he cried, harshly. "Do you mean to keep mc out here all night ?"? ? . ?'.??' - The old creature hurried back, allow ing him to pass in, with a look' of pain and disappointment in her leaden eyes like that we often see in dumb animals. > ".The young led'dy'e room be all ready/ she said, humbly. "Will ye go right up now, or " '.. ; . " Right up now," interrupted the young peer. " Lead the way." , She obeyed iv silence, gomg before them up the.great oaken etaircase, the' ; blood-hound crouching along at her heele. She paused midway the great hall that ran from the head of the stairs, between two rows of chambers that had once been ?very grand and stately, and taking a key' from her pocket, unlocked and. opened one of the carved oaken doors. Lord Strathspey, with Maggie on his arm, followed her into a large and handsome apartment. In its day, this old state chamber had been a magnificent one, but now the tapestry was faded and moth eaten, rats burrowed behind the carved wainscot, and the bronze candlestioks and ornaments on the marble mantel were green with mould. The rich furniture, too, of an antique style, was sadly decayed and faded, and the great Turkish rug in the centre of the floor sent up little puffs of dust at every touch of their feet. The solitary candle that burned on the mantel threw a dim and ghostly light into the distant corners of the vast room, where an immense bed ? ujreared itself like a mountain, all draped with faded velvet, and barely disclosed tho dim por traits of some dead-and-gone race that adorned the walls. . Altogether it was as dreary and tomb like a chamber ac one. can possibly imagine. ~,. ? : _'- '? Lord Angus led his lovely young prisoner into this haunted old etate chamber and seated her, with a bow of mocking gallantry, on the velvet couch that filled one corner. Then he turned to the old woman that stood just_ within the doorway, her eyes following him with, that curious, eager look. " Give mc the key," he said, roughly, " and take yourself off. ' I can find my way down." ' ? ' . She obeyed without a word, and with the key in his hand the young man turned to Maggie. ??..??. " You believe mc now ?" he began, his evil eyes flashing with triumph j "you see how completely you are in my. power ? The doors are strong here—to-night the great gatc3 will be eloeed and locked, and day and night that old orone and her blood hound will stand guard to prevent your escape. Tou see there is no hope for you." , Maggie uttered no word in answer. She eat motionless on the edge of the moth eaten sofa, her face white and rigid, her sweet brown eyes stony with. horror and despair. The young lord's heart releated a little as he looked at hor. " I don't like to do this," he oontinued, his tone softening as he epoko; " I want to be good to you, Maggie—it ia all your own fault. The moment you consent to become my wife, you are free. I want you to think it over to-night and make up your mind to like me—you can easily enough if you will. I shall come to see you early in the morning, and if you'll say the word we will be married at once, and I'll take you back to your father' the Countess of Strathepey Towers." Still she uttered no word in response, but sat in that white, stony silence. The young man could not bear to look at her, and he turned toward the door. "I won't annoy you to-night," he said ; "you're tired. I'll go down and send Gwynueth up with come supper and a glass of wine and you'll feel better to morrow. Good-night." He lingered an instant, hoping she would speak, but she did not, and he went out, closing and locking the door after him. And Maggie 'wee left alone a prisoner in this great, ghostly old ohamber. ."..?? ??:?
