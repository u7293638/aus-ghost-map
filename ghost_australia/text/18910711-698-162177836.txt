Even So. One by one our pleasures die, One by- one our comforts fly ; From Life's boughs with scarce a Found Fall the dying leaves around, Quietly blown off one by one, 'Till at last they all are gone ; And another Spring in vain Shall re- leaf the boushs aeraiu ! While the seasons onward range, Still our hearts confess the change : Days and months and years decay, Friends, like flowers, pass away ; Roses lose their wonted bloom, Violets die in their perfume : And the moist leaves pass at night . When the stars are few and bright, And the darkness like a swoon Quietly weeps its burthen down, â€” Showers soft of healing rain On the sad and lonely plain ; Where the ghosts of dead years walk With buried joys and intertalk In the night with plaintive moan, Mourning love and rapture flown, And the joy of youth's warm tear Which they shed while breathing here.
