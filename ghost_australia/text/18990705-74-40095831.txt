PERTTH VATER SClERE. FRESH FLANS TO BE OBTAINED. PERTH, Tuesday. A meeting of the Perth Water Trust was held on Monday afternoon, Mr. M. Heaps presiding. Mr. Robert Gould was present by request. It was decided to prepare fresh plans, and also to obtain new esti mates of the cost of the scheme, as the price for iron piping had risen considerably. It was also resolved to ascertain, if the terms of the Longford Trust for pumping the water with the turbines were accepted, whether they would require such a large reservoir, and if the windmills would be dis pensed with. These two items, it was considered, would made a reduc tion in the cost. The trust, it was explained, had been inconvenienced through the plans which were forwarded to the House of Assembly having been mislaid, hence the necessity for new ones being pre pared. A wife in America who has begun an action for divorce from her husband claims that the ghost of her husband's first wife infests the house and makes her miserable.
