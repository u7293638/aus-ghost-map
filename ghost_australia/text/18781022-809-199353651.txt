NEWS OF THE DAY. The Cabinet was occupied during a large portion of its sittings yesterday with the consideration of the financial requirements ot the various departments for the next twelve months, in anticipation of the loan which is about to be floated. The accountants of the Public Works, the Railways and the Educa- tion departments were present, and furnishett data as to the amounts of the loan whiob should be appropriated for various public works, railway works and the erection of Bchools. The largest sum will be required by the Railway department for the com pletion of several important works. the Mining department has also several im portant waterworks schemes in hand, which will require a considerable sum. The ques tion as to the distribution of the money amongst the various works was fully con sidered, and arrangements decided upon as to the placing of debentures. Executive and Cabinet Councils was held yesterdav at the Treasury. A considerable quantity" of formal business was disposed of at the Executive Council, and' the Cabinet was occupied several hours with various , matters of public interest. Nothing was decided with reference to the appointment of representatives of the Assembly to attend the proposed conference between the two chambers of the legislature. Indeed, nothing decisive can be done until the meeting of Parliament this afternoon, as each House oan claim the right of settling the question for itself. It is probable, however, that the representatives of the Legislative Assembly will be: Mr. Berry, the Attorney-General, and Professor Pearson, as has already been intimated in '1 he Age. The assent of his Excellency the Governor to an aot to authorise the . conversion of Victorian Government Btook into debentures is notified in a supplement to the Government Gazette. i The first business of importance which will occupy both HouseB of Parliament on their meeting this afternoon will be the ques- ticb a3 to the conference which is to take pinto upon the Government Reform Bill. The Chief Seoretary will make a statement and submit a motion- on tho subjeot in the Legislative Assembly, and the same cotirse will be purBued by Sir Charles Sladen in the LegielativeGouncil. Should an understanding bo arrived at, the conference will probably take placo on Wednesday. The education debate is to bo resumed in the Assembly, and it is expected that a great deal of light will bo thrown upon the subjectof the reduc tions of teachers' salaries by the information which tho Minister of Education has pro mised to supply. It is understood that Mr. Bont intends to bring forward a motion in reference to the continuance of the subsidies to local bodies, and this may occupy much time. The education vote and Sir John O'Shan assy's hill for the Amend ment of the Eduontion Act arc sniucient of themselves for two sittings, but should a longtby debate on the endowment of mu nicipalities intervene, the subject mny pos- Bibly not be disposed of until the end of the week. Mr. i.ongmoro has several important measures which the Government hope to deal with this week if the state of business will permit. These are The Bill for the Suppression of tho Rabbit Nuisance, the Land Aot Amendment Bill, and the Forests Management Bill. Altogether the week promises to bo a busy one iu Parlia ment. The Minister of Public Instruction, has been actively engaged in obtaining the infor mation asked for in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday night respecting the snlaries of teachers under the old education system as well as under the existing Education Act. Tho result of his investigations the Minister considers very satisfactory. Ho baa suc ceeded in amasBing a large amount of evi- donee relating to the whole question, and ho anticipates that its effect .upon the opinion of the House in reference to tho reduction of toaoliera' salaries will he serious. Ho will explain the matter fully on_ the resumption of the debate, giving a oora" parison of the positions of the teachers now ' with those which thoy occupied under the old system, besides showing how they are situated as compared with othormen holding appointments iu and out of tho public Berviee' requiring equal social Btatus and not inferior attainments. The Minister intends to mako a vigdrous effort to justify tho measure of economy which tho Government have thought it necessary to adopt, and he is understood to hold a sanguine opinion that his case is a strong one. It is understood that the agitation on the part of the local bodies for th indiscriminate continuance of the annual subsidies has not yot been relinquished. Members of Parlia- ment are being addressed by letter and cir cular on the subject, and efforts are being made to enlist the sympathies of as many members of the Assembly as possible on behalf of the movement. Mr. Bent, the member for Brighton, has beeu deputed to bring the matter forward in the Legislative Assembly, and it is proposed that that hon. gentleman shull move a resolution this evening affirming that in tba opinion of Parliament a bill ought to be at once paBsed making provision for the payment of the auiinal endowments for another five years. The local bodies ore said to'havo determined that if possible, no question Bs to redistribu tion shall bo entertained until the bill which they ask for has beeu passed. A caucus meeting' of members of the Legislative Council was held at Parliament House yesterday, for the purpose of dis cussing tho attitude to be assumed by that chamber in reference to the Government Re form Bill. There were seventeen members present, and the proceedings, svhioh were oonducted with closed doors, occupied up wards of two hours. Considerable discos- aion took place respecting the appointment of gentlemen to repreaent tho Council at the proposed conference, . and it was ulti mately/agreed that Sir Charles Sladen and Mr. Anderson ought to be appointed. No decision was arrived at, however, as to who the third 'representative should be. Dr. Henrn was proposed by some members of the counoil, but as he is understood to be a most unoumpromising opponent of reform, and especially of auy reform introduced by the presout Government, his nomination was strenuously opposed by a iarge number of the gentlemen present. The meeting ap. peared on tho wliolo to ahow a . de termination to act in a spirit of conciliation, but an opinion, real or affected, seemed to prevail that it would not be safe for the Couucil to oominit itself iu auy way until the intentions of the Government were more thoroughly understood. An impres sion seemed to exist amongst members of the Couucil that it would be advisable to havo a complete understanding with the Government and the Assembly before the chamber was committed to any serious step iu tho important negotiations which arc about to tako place. No positive decision was therefore arrived at. The meeting was of some utility, however, as indicating tho spirit iu which fnembers of the Couucil were preparod to deal with the question, and from all appearances it may bo ooncluded that a cordial effort is to be made to meet tho Assembly, and, if possible, to arrive at some definite arrangement. One great danger with reference to the conferenoe seems to be that in consequonoo of a slight feeling of distrust both parties may be some what disinclined at the outset to mako over tures so freely as might be desired. The arrangements which the Postmaster- General has been engaged for some time in preparing, in order to secure the better despatch of business in the Post Office, have at length been brought to maturity. The double staff system csme into operation yes terday, snd the officers in charge re port upon it in most favorable terms. The object of the double staff is to do away with the mode of working under which so much expense has been inaarred hitherto in payment for overtime, to curtail tho hours during whioh the men are on duty, and to enable those who are properly entitled to promution, such as intelligent letter- carriers of long service, to obtain their rights. The experienced lettercarriers can now be come sorters in the mail , room, thus attain ing 'to an improved position, whioh Mr. Patterson has been the first to propose should be thrown open to them, ln making the chauges which he has carried' out during the last fortnight Mr. Patterson has insisted upon giving precedence to the oldest and most intelligent letter; carriers, and fifteen of them had been trans ferred to the sorting' department. In giving liis instructions for the new arrangements, the Postmaster-General insisted most emphatic ally that whilst the staff was doubled the ex pense of working the department must not be increased- The overtime system has been done away with, so that it is hoped that there will be fewer men knooked np by sick ness than has been habitually the case here tofore, and consequently much leas unprofit- . able expenditure in that direction. One im portant feature of the hew system is that whenever any increase is to be made in the staff, the appointments must be made in the bottom of the class, the new comer having to Work hie way up by his own industry and intelligence. The changes effected are likely to have the most important results. The officers reported yesterday that for the Unit tlmein tho history of the department the letters had been sent out to the publio punctually. Hitherto it has never been possible to get the correspon dence sorted in time for tho first mails, and a great many letters havo been delivered every day in the afternoon which should have been sent out early in the morn ing. A thorough reformation is being effected throughout the whole of the Telegraph department. A number of boys who were employed to carry messages In the town were confined in an apartment which was. found to be utterly inadequa.e for tbeir accommodation, and they havÂ© beeu placed' iu more Bpacious quarters. During their spare time these boys are to be instructed iu the art of telegraphy, and a library is to be provided for them with desks and writing materials, so that they can profit by the opportunity afforded of obtaining a little eduoation during their leisure. The pay of these youths has also been slightly increased. In other _ spheres, females have been employed in various light occupations, the men being _ drafted off to the more laborious descriptions of work. Itisexpeoted that.by next Monday morning tho whole system will be in proper working order, and that the postal business of the metropolis will be oonduoted with the regularity and despatch which should charac terise so important a service. The Commissioner of Publio Works has caused a circular to bo forwarded to the Government auditors directing them not to pass any oontract accounts in connection with municipalities when the vouohers for such work are not certified to by a certifi cated engineer qualified under the Munioipal Corporation Statute. A deputation from the mallee scrub dis trict, consisting of Messre. Finlay, Atten- borough and . Wilmot, yesterday bad an interview with Mr. Longmore in reference to the proposed tax to defray the expense of suppressing the rabbit nuisance. The deputation was introduced by Mr. Lyell, M.L.A. They oomplained that the bill at present before Parliament would operate unfairly and injurlonsly as regarded the pastoral interest. They considered the tax of 2d. per . acre which it was pro posed to enable the shire councils to levy too much. The land in the district where the rabbits wore most numerous was very poor, aud would not boar any Buch im post. The deputation asked that the Government should render homo substantial assistance towards the extermination of tho pest, and not call upon the pastoral tenants to contribute more than they deemed a reasonable proportion of the expendi ture. Mr. Lyell urged the _ Minis ter to reconsider the provision in the bill relating to tho finding of tho money to meet tho cost of clearing off tho_ rabbits, remarking that as the bill stood it would cause too heavy a burden to be thrown upon one class. Should the bill not be altered a vigorous opposition to ifc must be expected iu Parliament. Mr. Longmore would not pro mise to make any alteration whatever in the bill. Twopence would be the limit ' of the tax to . be imposed. The pastoral tenants might object to it, but if energetic stops were not taken under some such bill as the one at present before Parliament to get rid of the rabbits they would soon render it impossible for the pastoral tenants io remain on their land. Tho pastoral tenants in South Australia had refused to pass a similar measure until re cently, because they objeoted to the idea of taxing themselves ; but the rabbit nuisance had now beoome so serious that they, were willingly passing the bilL They found that it was better to pay the tax than give up their, land. The gas question will be farther con sidered by. the select committee of tho Legislative Assembly at oloven o'olook to day, when it is intended to take farther evidence on the subject. \- In accordance with a deoision previously arrived at, tho Parliamentary Gas Com mittee yesterday took stops 'to arrange for a test of some of the meters in the district of Kew, tho inaccuracies of which were recently brought under their notice. Six of tho meters attached to lamp posts in that municipality were detached and removed to the office of Mr. Greene, tho meter tester, at the Town Hull, for the purpose of being examined by that gentleman. When the testing was about to ba commenced there were present Messrs. Carter and Bent, M.L.A.'s, representing tho gas committee ; Mr. R. S. Inglis, the muni cipal cas conference ; Mr. Scott, seoretary, and Mr. Vasey, offioe manager' of the Mc- tropohtan Gus Company ; Mr. A. Ellis, the company's accountant ; Mr. Dempster, tho agent for the meters about to be tested, and the representatives of tho press, while Mr. Greene was in attendance to test the meters in their presence and in that of tho gas committee's expert, Mr. Keen, The right of Messrs. DempBtor, Ellis and the representatives of tho presB to be present was at once Challenged by Mr. Carter, and Mr. Dempster intimated that he had ob tained permission from Mr. Fitzgibbon, the seoretary of tlio gas conference. A dispute was carried oh for some time, and ultimately Messrs. Dempster and Ellis, and the representatives of the press were' re quired to withdraw, although Mr. Bent ex pressed no wish to exclude them. The testing of the meters was then carried out with the strictest privaoy, steps being taken to pre vent any but the little coterie . pre sent seeing what was' done, while at its conclusion ail those who had witnessed the operations stated that they had been bound not to divnlge anything that had taken place. Mr. Greene's report will be presented to tho gas committee at their meeting which takes place this morning, when some explanation may perhaps bs given of this attempt to stifle pnblio inqniry, by making in private investigations which could not be conducted in too publio a manner. The escape from Hamilton gaol on the 10th inst. of Kenneth M 'Donald, a pri soner under committal for trial for sheep- stealing, has at length been brought under tho formal notice of the Government, and the Chiof Seoretary has directed that a reward of Â£100 shall be paid for his apprehension. It is supposed that M'Donald has made for tho South Australian boundary. Between eleven o'clock on Saturday even ing and Sunday morning, the premises of Mr. S. Benjamin, pawnbroker, 8-i Swanston- streot, were burglariously entered, and jewellery and other property stolen to the value of about Â£100. No one was sleeping on the premises, and the thieves effected an entrance by breaking open the back door. The forty-fourth half- yearly meeting of tho shareholders of the Colonial Bank of Australasia was hold at the banking house, Elizabeth-street, yesterday morning ; Mr. W. J. Clarke, M.L.C., in tho chair. The directors' report stated that the net profits amounted to Â£23,103 12s. 10d., or less tax paid in bank notes, Â£1043 4s., a net sum of Â£22,060 8s. 10d., which 'tho directors pro posed to divido as, follows Dividend at the rate of 8 per cent, per annnm on Â£6 10s. per Bharo, Â£16,250; reserve fund, Â£4000; oud balance to profit and Iobs, Â£1S10 Ss. lOd. The chairman, on moving the adoption of the report and accompanying balance-sheet, referred with great pleasure to the improvement in the finances of the bank during the past year, which was owing to tho 'increased business whioh the direotors had been able to transact in what they believed to be perfectly safe investments. Mr. Robert Wallen seconded the-mdtidn, and pointed oat tbat tho amount available for apprapria- tiou exceeded by Â£1000 that of the last naif. - year, and that in -the face of the difficulty whioh all the banks bad experienced, and the great competition in regard to deposits .which had arisen from other banks offering every inducement to obtain them.-- The report and balance-sheet were unanimously adopted. The chairman announced that the divideud would be payable on and after to-day, and votes of thanks having been accorded to the directors and officers, and to the chairman, the proceedings terminated. In the County Court yostorday John Vieira, a seaman, sued Peter Brown, master of the ship John Griffiths, to recover damages for negligence. Mr. Qninlan ap peared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Purves for .the defendant. On the 18th April the ship mentioned was in Duke's Dook, and the orew were placing stores in her from > the steamer Gpeo, whioh was alongside of the dock. The plaintiff was lifting into the ship a bag of sugar np a ladder, the top of which was resting on the bulwark of the John- Griffiths, and the bottom on the edge of the dock. Not being able to lift the bog np the ladder he called to one of the men on board - to throw him a rope, whioh was done, and he then fastened the rope to the bag, laid the man on deck began to haul. The ladder gave way, .and- the plaintiff and bag of sugar fell into the dock. His leg was broken, and he sustained other injuries be. sides, rendering hiin unable to work for a considerable time, - The present action was for ne'gngence'bn' the part of the, captain . in | hot keeping the ladder properly fastened, aq - as topreventit from falling. The jury fennd ffl a vordict for the plaintiff, giving him Â£nsH comprisingâ Â£50 damages, Â£30 Dr. Fine's fsfl medical charges, Â£22 wages, and Â£16 hotel H oxpenses. Several points were reserved in. Sfl eluding that of contributory negligence and H that the plaintiff, as a seaman, had been pro. iM pcrly discharged nnder the act, and was not H entitled to wages. ' g-gl Mr. David Gauneon was defendant in an ffll action heard in the' County Court yesterday jW in which John. M'Lellan, a quondam client 19 sought to recover Â£150 damages for negli- 'H gence in the conduct of a case as an Â»f. <19 torney. The plaintiffs case was that iaffl June last he instructed the defendant IB take preccedings in the ConntyConrt against U a Mr. Neilson, the owner of a house which IS he had occupied for ten years nnder lesse, |9 to recover Â£70, the value of improvement whioh the landlord bad undertaken to pay 9 at the expiration of the tenancy. The terms fi of tho tenancy wore that it was to coa.'ffl tinne for two years at least, a mouth's, 19 notice to be given. Before the day of hear. ing the defendant Neilson paid Â£20 intafjS court, bat the plaintiff refused to accept -IS that in full satisfaction, and Mr. Gacnsonlfl promised to make it hot for Neilson. When H the case was called on Mr. Gaunson wagffl not in court, and it was adjonrned for a short fifl time. Five minutes before it was called on 19 again, Mr: Gaunson came to him and'#9 returned him all the papers iu the case, and 9 Baying he conld not wait, having to'catoh-9 the train to Castlemaine, where he bad to>v9 lectnre that evening, he left the court. Onf'fl the ease proceeding he was nonsuited with-iM Â£40 costs, because Mr. Qninlsn, for' NeU.gi'S son, put in the lease, which showed thatÂ«-9 the ten&noy; had not terminated, andPfl that the aotion was premature. Mr. Gsuo.< 9 son went into the box, and after saying he!?9 did not oare a dump how the present aotioafi'9 went, he said he had not received a pennyiSffl from the plaintiff in this oase. On the con- if 9 trary, he had lent him Â£9 ill cash. WhealÂ£0 ho asked M'Lellan if there was any agree-il9 ment between him and Neilson, he told himf 9 there was one for two years, which had eiafeH pired, and on the assurance that all the factaL-Sn were candidly placed before him he-brougbtfc'fl the action. When &1 rt Wilkinson, the oppoi'KH site attorney , showed him the agreement 9 and he mentioned it to M'Lellan, he furiously Â«9 refuted to recognise it, and said another j-ffl agreement had beep entered into subaequent'gj to that. On the day of the trial he told K M M'Lellan he had to gp to Castlemaine toi9 leoture, and could not wait till after thresf '9 o'clock, and he must be prepared to oondoctiifl bis own case, there being no funds provideij||9 to instruct counsel. Judge Cope, in ming np, said it was inevitable that M'Lellan9 wonld have been nonsuited, no matter who/9 appeared for him. In that action he did not ;:'9 suffer any damages; and he might havs"r'9 taken tho Â£20 out of court. But Mr. Oaun. v'lH son having undertaken the case ought co9 have attended to it. For that the plaintifljt9 was entitled to nominal damages. He oughltvH not, however, to have proceeded with hUM9 own case. Had he declined to go on helf.fi wonld have been entitled to substantial ,:-9 damages. The jury fonnd for tha plaintifi,Â®fi damages Â£30.
