St. John' himself, hav ing seen that orchard, ' discharged a whole volley of Come! Come! Come! 1 and then pronounced the benediction: " The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen." Theu the banished evangelist , closes the book, and the Bible is done. The 1 dgar old Book opened with Adam's orchard and closes with St. John's orchard. St. John went into his orchard through a stone gate, the black basalt- of the Isle of Patmos, to | which he had bceu exiled. That orchard j which he 6uw was and is in heaven. One j person will err in spenkiug of heaven as all ' material, and another person describes heaven as* all the figurative and spiritual, and both are wrong. Heaven is both material and spiritual, as we are both material and; spiritual. "While much of the Bible account of heaven is to bo taken figuratively ana spiritually, it is plain to me that heaven has also a material existence. Christ said, " I go to prepare a place for you." Is not a place material ? God, who has done all the world- building, the statistics of stars so vast hs to be it bewilderment to telescopes, could have piled up a tremendous world to make the Bible heaven true, both as a material splendour and a spiritual domain. I do not believe God put all the flowers, and all the precious &toncs;, and nil the bright metals, and all the music, and all the foun tains, and all the orchards in this little world of ours. How much was literal and how much was figurative I cannot say,; but St. John saw two rows of trees on each side of a river, and it differed from otht-r orchards in the fact-that the trees bore twelve manner of fruits. The learned translators of ourcommon Bible say it means twelve different kinds of fruits in one year. Albert Barnes says it means twelve crops of the same kind of "fruit in one vc-ar. Not able to decide which is the more accurate translation. I adopt both. If it means twelve different kinds of fruit, it declares variety in heavenly joy. If it mean twdre crops of the same kind of fruit, it declares abundance in heavenly joy. And they are both - true. r, you may have streets of gold in heaven ; give me the orchards, with twelve manner of fruits, yielding their fruit every: month ; aud the leaves of the trees are for] '* the healing of the nations ; and there shall j be no more curse, but the throne of God and' of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Hira ; ana they shall see His face ; and His name shall be in their foreheads ; and there shall be no night there, nnd they need no candle, neither light of the sun, for the Lord God giveth them light; and they shall reign for ever and ever."
