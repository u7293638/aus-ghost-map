NOTES AND COMMENTS. DIL DALE.-" TO YOUNG MEN CHIEFLY." We have heard a good deal of Dr Dale since his arrival here and shall expect to hear some what more when, after preparing his thoughts with care, he publishes them in the Convent praying for, warned by some recent in stances perhaps the Congregational doctor does not propose to be a hasty publicist. He will observe all that he can here, and think about all that he observes, and publish his conclusions in due course, and in quiet and logical fashion The doctor is, in a certain way, an apostle of common sense, and yet it seems that he permitted himself to be drawn into a foolish business by the announcement that he would lecture to young men only, or to young men chiefly, or to " young men and women specially (for the announcement was much variety in the Independent Church We have had too much of mummery of that sort in Melbourne, too many attempts of mediocre or contemptible people, for below the standard of Dr Dole, to draw an audience by promise of something that could not be spoken in the common ear of mankind lectures to young men only, and lectures to young women only,' panderings for the most cart to a morbid and not altogether pure minded curiosity Dr Dale does not require the assistance of any allurements of that sort, and it last night he had announced himself to lecture on topics and influences of the time, or on his own Australian experiences, it is possible that he would have been the church pocket (instead of one third empty), and some hundreds of people turned away from the doors He had nothing to say it is rare that any properly educated and fairly experienced men has anything to say that the whole world may not hear 'the apostles never wrote secret letters to young men or confidential climates to young; women They spoke of and advocated whatsoever things were pure and true and of good report, and consequently of interest and open to all Dr Dale did likewise, and tried to set before all his audience the sort of ideal he would desire to see them set up, and the life he would wish them to lead He was touched a little-the sting or pi lee or regret appeared through much apologetic reasoning with the high esteem in which we hold athletics here. He had seen Sidney rolling down and worshipping an oarsman or a team of cricketers, and Melbourne abasing herself at the shrine of football He did not altogether condemn it. He went back to Charles Kingsley) s school of muscular Christianity to find for it some justification It was the old duty of m containing the sound body for the sound mind, or, in older phrase, of keeping the tabernacle of the Holy Ghost in the best possible condition Only that there was a dread of the occupant being neglected through too great care of the shrine and a tour of muscles and athletics becoming the all in all, and when the Hush of south was past, proving a very undesirable possession and unsatisfactory) foundation. Criticism of this sort may be useful, but it misses the one deep fact which justifies what might other wise appear as our crazy encouragement of athletics 1 or it is not that the philosophical mind reilly desires a preternatural prove era in rowing, boating or footballing, but that it grasps the fact that excellence in these can only grow through practice of the virtues of temperance, Bobeiuess, and chastity, and of unit soil restraint which is the foundation of the strong man Deep thought and subtle analysis are not, indeed, Dr Doles strong points He Bees a little further than must of his neighbours, and uses them a little for his mirth perhaps, as, for example, when he halts in strong condemnation of the vice of gambling, and follows a round of deafening applause with the words ' to land, in wool, or in mining shares But a little later on he seems to take what may be termed a common sense, but is really an erroneous view of certain Iinji matters of lue he speaks of the great workers, the leaders of his, the makers and guiders and governors of people the public men, in fact-and describes them, not as the clever people, but the plodders, the Bell possessed sound convictioned men, not blown about by any wind, nor of necessity uplifted by) an) extraordinary inspiration these are the men who control and do the work of the world. Is it so' Does not the audacity, no less than the force of genius, clear or carve or make the way for every great movement t It is not a bit dangerous to teach people to worship genius, it is the rarest element in mankind Dr Dale seemed to see this when he claimed honour for the men who did any thing great in literature, art, or science as utterly) above and beyond the money spinners, and seemed also just then to be not quite in accord with his formal sent But generally considered, his lecture was sound, and prac Heal, and good at least up to the level in the understanding of his audience, and superior to the pabulum they usually receive. 1118 definition of filial duty was necessary as good, and it is at least possible that very close and accurate definition of duty in this matter followed observations of a general neglect which an intelligent visitor to Australia could hardly miss " I know very little about young men and young women in this country, and the doctor, and yet seemed to have a very accurate notion of the physic some at least of their ailments required The conclusion of the lecture was its best port. Herein was set up something like an Australian ideal And it was healthy to hear that business which we are accustomed to hear lightly spoken of as Iol, rolling 111 politics denounced as felony, that would not escape the eternal judgment however lightly it might be treated in the courts and councils of our state Good also to hear the appeal for an intellectual as against an outer famous and luxurious life, and form chivalrous regard of womanhood and devotion to a true patriotism, on the part of all those who were growing 00 fast into manhood. full chance The heart) cheers of the audience allowed their full appreciation, and it may be hoped that memory's tablets were also so deeply impressed as not to be rubbed smooth og nu b) an hour of gossip or a want of rest Dr Dolo preaches twice again in Melbourne on Sunday next on Tuesday takes farewell, and leaves on Thursday for his old associations 111 the Old AN world His promised criticisms or impressions of our life will be 0041 rl) looked for, and his visit remembers I with some gratitude and pleasure
