M\ASAI OIVILIZATION. A eIosT interesting work has just been published by a traveller named Thom son on the old kingdom of Mrasai, Africa. The Masai, like the Galli, believe in the existence of an invisible God, the Nagi, and in the efficacy of prayer. Nothing, in fact, is under taken without "hours of howling,", as the author somewhat irreverently stylestheirdevotional exercisek. Ghosts or spiri:e are not believed in, nor an existence after death. They ,.have, however, much faith in witchcraft, and believe that God can work through his lubons and impart magical virtues to a variety of objects. Mr. Thomson himself was looked upon as a very good medicine man, and" furnishes various instances in which his kindly intercession was not appealed to in vain. The social life of this people presents .phases al'ogether un krnown among the negroes, and the sketch. of the life of a Masai from the cradle to his death, when his body is thrown outside the kraal to be devoured by hyenas, is full of interest. The younger men, or warriors, live in separate villages with the young girls, where courtship bstween the two sexes is carried on, though not without attention to certain, safeguards. as the Masai advances in age he buys unto himself a wife, whose bast off garments he wears during the honey moon, and thenceforth the whole course of his life changes. He may now take to a vegetable diet, while for merly he was confined to milk and meat, and he is permitted to indulge in tobaco and hy'dromel. At the same time he becomes a staid and respec table member of society, with very definite notions as to the rights of pro perty and the advantages of trade.
