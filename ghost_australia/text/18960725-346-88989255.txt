The Latf Intercolonial Match.—It will be re membered that six of the game® in the match be tween Victoriaand New South Wales on the Queen's Birthday were lef." nnfinished at the Call of time—11 p.m. Mr. EL Charh'ck, of Adelaide, to whom they were referred, has given his de cision as follows :—No. 2, Crane v. Tnii idge, a draw; No. 4, Hall v. louckmsn, a win for V ctori - ; No. 6, S'ott v. Liughran, a win for New Scuth Wales ; No. 7, Stanley v. Jonas, a draw : No S. Walker v. Noali, a win for Vic torii ; and 9, Heaver v. Mackenzie, a win for New South Wales—making two wins for each eidesnd two draws. Thtse fig- ares, added to the two wins gained by Victoria over the board, one win by New South Wales, and one draw, give the final results as follow :—Vic toria, four wins ; New South Wales, three wins and three draws. The game Heaver v Mac keczie»wae continued under protest, Mr. Heaver havicg inadvertently written Kt takes Kt instead of Kt takes ~B when he despatched his move to Sydney. This pi-int having also been referred for adjudication, Mr. Charlick has de cided thai as iht move Kt takes Kt was an impos sible move (for the sufficient reason that botii of the opponent's Kt's had already been taken), ths Victorians were justified in claiming that Mr. Beaver should be allowed to 3mend his re corded move by substituting the obvious move he had made on his own board of Kt takes B.

A Niget of Trouble.—'Talking of ghosts,' skid the man in corduroy, 'I had an experience once that nearly turned my hair grey. I arrived laie at night in a little valley town out west where the ouly hotel was one of those amateur girocrack places with worsted mottoes on the walls and plants in the windows. The landlord himself lighted me to my room and saw that I was made comfortable. I was dead tired and sleepy, and dropped cfi the moment niy head touched the clean, lace-bordered pilk-wf. I was awakened, some time toward morning, from a sound sleep very suddenly, by a strange grating noise, and by the dim light I saw a man rise through the floor or the room. At first I thought he had come to murder rue, but the longer I looked the mere certain I became fci'.at he was no mortal man. I lay shaking un^il daylight with my head buried in the bedclothes.' 'And then ?' ' Then I saw rny own clotho; neatly surmounted by my hat disposed on tho frame of a dumb waiter where I had placed them when retiring. The landi.nd had hauled' them down, brushed 'hem carefully, and sent them up again, givipg me a fright that nearly turned my brain.' Tut Akuicax Ciiiej-' a:>i> the Lady Mis si"NAl,.rE.s.—A private letter from Uuaisda r. ferring lo the ladies jentout by the Church Missionary Society to join their station there says :—Their arrival caused srreat ji.y to the native?, especially to the wni.ien, and no small amount of comment. The want a of the E.nglish ladies attracted great: atten tion. The natives instant]? gave tha ladies the name of ' sl ider-middled.' The King askeu various cool questions—ho*-4' old thev were, etc., and they told him. He-then said, <.ii not'eing ample sleeves, that they mus: put t-ii their rood up their sleeve.", as it evi dently did not go inside.'
