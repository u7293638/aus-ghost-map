NEWS BY THE MAIL. -. TOPICS OF THE WEEK. (FROM OUR COB-ESPO-D-NT.) LONDON, OCT. 28, The Cabinet fails to meet, although most of the Ministers are in town, including the Premier It is suggested that the delay arises from the fact that Mr. Balfour is anxious to complete the evidence he is accumulating of the general condition of Ireland, which may be the basis of very grave action when it comes before the inner circle of the Government. The right hon. gentleman has been at Dublin for the best part of a fortnight hard at his official work. He returns to England in the course of next week, having an engagement to speak at Birmingham, on the 4th November Meantime we hear afresh of the reconstruc- tion of the Ministry by the inclusion of Lord Hartington and Sir IL James. Coming from the Conservative press, this line a certain significance which would not otherwise attach to it, but, at the same time, I believe it to he quite anathemas Lord Salisbury's health is not very robust, as we know, yet he is much better than he was at the end of the session, and the fact that he is adding to Ina platform engagements until they are now three or four deep, shows that he is feeling more "fit' for his work 'The suggestion is that he is again thinking of asking Lord Hartington to take the helm, whilst he himself maintains his position as Foreign Secretary. Now, it may be said at once that the Conservatives would not stand a movement of this sort. It could only succeed if the Government were to extremes, and uses there is not only no danger, but perfect security. Lord Harrington's Nottingham speech shows this We may accordingly outside current rumours on this subject, in so far as they propose coalition. A possible thing is the return of Lord, Churchill to the Government You will observe I don't say probable. His Lord ship is just now on his good behaviour, and he has been delivering a series of very effective speeches in the North of England, which have given the liveliest satisfaction to his part) He speaks with such authority among the mass of the Conservative electors that it is a trifle absurd to reflect that he is not of the Government, life friends, consisting mainly of the young men on the Conservative side of the House, are striving very earnestly to smooth his return. Whether they will achieve their aim is, however, somewhat doubtful There would be some difficulty in placing the noble lord This is of course arranged by the newspapers, and we are told that Mr Matthews being about to resign (which I don't believe) Mr. Edward Stanhope will be sent to the Home Office, leaving the War department at Lord Sahs bury's disposal. Fancy Lord Randolph, with his now home passion for economy, sitting cheek by jowl with the military men in Pall Mall I There would be strange doings Laurel), and it would not be surprising to hear the commander in chief using his very strongest language to characterise the arrangement 'The week has again been full of great speeches Lord R. Churchill, Lord Harrington, and Mr. Chamberlain have combined in giving an answer to Mr. Gladstone's addresses to the Liberal caucus assembled at Nottingham, and it maybe said that between them they have torn them to tatters. Lord Randolph, dealing with the arrangement of the Irish policy of the Government, took Mr. Gladstone point by point, and gave some most effective blows in reply As to the allegation that freedom of speech was being suppressed in Ireland, be cited certain passages from several recent addresses by Mr Dillon and other of the Nationalist leaders, and in the same way quoted from the more violent tirades of limit of Ireland in refutation of the suggestion that there was any danger to the liberty of the press He repeated the doctrine he had laid down in the House of Commons as to the Tight of the police to enter a public meeting by force, in order to place their reporter, and declared that Mr Gladstone's mind was hopelessly poisoned against the police not only in Ireland, but throughout the United Kingdom Common gratitude should have dictated a different feeling, since the Irish constabulary dauntlessly und resolutely carried out the coercion policy which marked every year of Mr Gladstone's former governments, and the London police during five years guarded Mr Gladstone's life day and night against the emissaries of the party with which he is now in close alliance Lord Randolph was especially severe upon Mr. Gladstone for atigin&tisingns; "impertinent" the conduct of the metropolitan police in going late at night to a Socialist leader to get information as to a certain forthcoming Socialist meeting When a few months back the police were taken by surprise, and there was Serious looting in the West End, Mr. Gladstone's Home Secretary cashiered the chief commissioner and several of his assistants The necessity of precaution was overwhelming It was with his official knowledge that in 1883 the English people escaped by a hair's breadth from a disaster of unprecedented magnitude, and only through the uncommon watchfulness of the police Lord Randolph professed great indignation that Mr. Gladstone should add to the numerous embarrass- ments of the authorities in this regard, and in a vigorous peroration declared that by association with Mr. Parnell Mr. Gladstone and his friends were steadily becoming a revolutionary party), whose BUCCOSB, if it ever came, would mark the decline and fall of Imperial Britain. Speaking at Nottingham on Monday, Lord Hartington addressed himself to the same subject, and much in the same way. He twitted the Home Rulers with being a "one man party" spite of the removal of the; headquarters from Birmingham, and created great effect by declaring his mature conviction that no compromise could be effected with them within the lines of Mr. Gladstone's bill. 1 he production of a new Liberal programme for Great Britain showed, he thought that the steam on the Irish question was getting low, but the programme had no more practical bearing upon the politics of the immediate future than the famous resolution of the Three Tailors of Tooley Street The noble marquis had, indeed, nothing but contempt for this " new departure, and declined to discuss it save in one particular He wanted to know, for instance, how Mr Gladstone came to give assent to the disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales, and to withhold his assent to any attack on the Church of England in England, seeing that there was on record a famous speech of his, in which he proved that it was absolutely impossible to separate disestablish- ment in Wales from disestablishment in England Touching upon the method in which Mr Gladstone had launched the disestablishment crusade, Lord Harrington Bau!, "I do not think it is possible to call to mind anything so cynical as the manner in which these questions of great national and imperial importance, as well as of supreme local interest, were put up the other day for sale to the highest bidder in Home Rule votes. Mr Gladstones a language meant nothing less than a simple, undisguised, and asked bribe to the Scottish disestablishes, to whom he said that the settlement of their case depended, not upon its merits or upon justice, but upon the amount of support which they could bring to the cause of Home Rule in Ireland Lord Hartington thought the now domestic programme was a mere delusion, and that he would disappear as the authorised programme of 1885 disappeared when it had served its purpose As to Mr Gladstone's criticisms on the present administration of BRITAIN in Ireland, the same picture had been painted a thousand times of the administration of law and order during Mr Gladstone town Governments with just as much or as little reason of the suggestions made in regard to the conduct of the police-" Do not fail their ears to the pump, do not put them in the horse pond" Lord He tington observed that our history did not contain a single instance in which an ex Minister of the Crown had thus gone out of his wa) premature!), without trial, without evidence without proof, to convict a body of men against whom nothing had been established of an atrocious crime, and to sentence them to an ignominious punishment This is pretty plain speaking, you will say But not less does Mr Chamberlain's address on Tuesday show the widening breach He had written to the Unionist gathering at Nottingham to say that it was evident there was nothing for it but to fight the matter out with the Gladstonians and for the first time he gave them a taste of his real quality at Islington He examined with scathing effect the new Liberal programme launched by Mr Gladstone, and recalled the facts that only a year ago the strongest pressure was put upon Mr Gladstone's Government to make them vote against a motion for Welsh disestablishment and that in lbS Mr Gladstone was adverse to tree schools, both of which were now supported He sold the proposals put before the country were not a programme, but phantasmagoria "They are the ghosts of Liberal measures stain by his action. He raises them by his incantations only to lay them when they have served his purpose, and stimulated the fanaticism of his devotees This was the fate of the programme of 1885 Upon the question of the government of Ireland, Mr Chamberlain was equally emphatic. 'The Gladstonians, he said, were recreant to the honourable traditions of Liberalism, and in allying themselves with the party of disorder were engaged in the fatal work of undermining the structure upon which the greatness and prosperity of the empire rested " As long as they pursue this course reunion with them is impossible, reunion is undesirable ' Such is briefly the general effect of the great meetings of the National Liberal Federation held last week at Nottingham. So far from bringing Liberal reunion in sight it has been postponed to a dim and distant future, ' which may not be reached for a space of years I pass at once to the acts a state of affairs in Ireland The chief event of the week has been found in the arrest of Mr Wilfrid Blunt for persisting in holding a proclaimed meeting at W Radford to denounce Lord Clanricarde Mr Blunt has been sentenced to two months' imprisonment but he has put in an appeal, and he has thus managed to stave off his incarceration until January next, when his case comes before the local Quarter Sessions. It is a satisfactory thing to see that there is to be no distinction between the Irish and the English, agitators in Ireland, and it may be hoped that the knowledge of the fact will have a beneficial influence in a certain direction Of course, Mr Blunt has much Byra partly from the Gladstonians, and we have thrust before us the usual nauseous stuff about the sacred right of public meeting and the like Mr Harrington, M.P., who was counsel for Mr Blunt, sought to make it out that the proclamation was invalid, on the ground that it could not have been based on sworn information, and he proposed to call the Chief Secretary as a witness on this point But the Bench, consisting of two resident magistrates, had no difficulty in putting aside this point as being outside their jurisdiction, the proclamation itself being sufficient evidence for them In explanation of this matter I ought to say that it has become the custom with the promoters of public meetings in Ireland to give the shortest possible notice of the same, in order to embarrass the authorities, who have to refer to Dublin for powers and Mr Blunt's friends were persuaded that this reference was not legally made in the case of the meeting which was proclaimed on Sunday There is, however, such a thing as the telegraph, and it is quite possible that this may be available for the transmission of sworn information " The meetings of the league were almost suspended on Sunday The authorities were everywhere on the alert and although Mr Cox, M P , baffled them at Ivil rush, they were generally very successful The Government has scored their first success against a newspaper The Wexford People, owned by Mr E. J Walsh, had not only published the proceedings of certain suppressed branches of the league, but had gone out of its way to directly encourage the people to take part in a proclaimed meeting Here two resident magistrates were on the Bench, and the evidence being very direct, they found no din! culty in sentencing Mr Walsh to two separate terms of imprisonment viz., two months for the first offence, and one month for the second But here also the sentence has been temporarily defeated by notice of appeal It seems, indeed, that the BO called summary powers of the Crimes Act are open to a good deal of abuse, though this will grow loss when the Superior courts have given decision on one or two points which are now continually cropping up Just now a deputation from the Scottish Liberal Association is travelling in Ireland, headed by Mr G BeUb, lately a member for Glasgow These gentry are doing what they can to encourage" the peasantry in the present evil work of flouting the Executive, and thus add not a little to the difficulties of the Government. The state of certain districts, and notably of County Clare, is, indeed, terrible Outrages are of nightly and daily occurrence, and the pressure upon the police is so excessive that it is almost hopeless to expect them, without large reinforcements, to cope with the situation Of course, the country is suffering seriously in more ways than one The master of the Limerick foxhounds (Mr Gubbins), having suffered by the poisoning of several of his dogs, has just broken up his establishment, and removed to -England, to the grave prejudice of his old district We hear nothing of the action of Monsignor Persico, who remains in Ireland, notwithstanding reports of his return to Remo, but the story goes that his report is not favourable to any interference with the action of the Irish hierarchy, so much are the interests of the church to have precedence over any other considerations, political or otherwise It true this is really deplorable, and shows us that we have nothing to expect from the influence of the Vatican, but that Archbishops Walsh and Croke are to rule the roost in Ireland, as they have done for so many months to the great offence of the 1 English Catholic party, and to the great prejudice of their country Lord Salisbury is much congratulated upon his arrangements with France as to the Suez Canal and the New Hcbn less It is perfectly true that the neutralisation of the canal gives this country no advan tapes which she has not at present and which it is likely thresher could command in time of war but it gives satisfaction to the other powers and Generally smoothed the path of our Foreign Minister Moreover it has been impossible to avoid some conclusion of this sort since I Lord Granville first made the offer of neutralisation to Europe The French press see in the arrangement but the first step to the complete evacuation of I">Pt Well, against this may be set the reappearance of the enemy at Wady Haifa to say nothing of repeated declarations to the effect that we cannot leave the Khc civil Government in any i ord iv whatever The one point, which has been made matter of cavil in this country is that France should have obtained any sightseer the Leeward Islands for merely carrying out her promises in regard to the New Hebrides But it you Australians are content with the arrangement there will be small objection on this alfie everyone being only too glad to get rid of a question which promised so much embarrass ment The state of his riculture which goes from had to worse in "ty mg great force to the cry of the farmers for protection Mr Chaplin has assume 1 a sort of leadership of the tailored movement, nil Uni agricultural labourers (who are being dismissed from the land in large numbers) are being told that their only salvation is to lay a little more for their food in order to get any food at all Wages have fallen among, this unhappy class to Si a week in Wiltshire It is not surprising therefore, to hear that the Income, s are coming round to the views of the of trim is on dun matter, and that a veritable agitates a is usual, Lord Run d Alpha Churchill four t it convenient to speak on the subject in the north at the end of last week. He had a good deal to early in ridicule of fair trade under which title the move j mont makes way, but he confessed that if I there was a strong national demand for a re I curriucotousisteuiofurotcct.onwliichHhould 1 involve n duty on food, there was nothing to prevent the Tory part) yielding to it, and he would certainly not offer it any stubborn resistance This is a notable sign Nobody looks more closely to the constituencies than Lord R. Churchhill, and it is clear that he is preparing to go with the stream when the freshet comes down at the election Succeed urge that which Settles the Irish question An inquest held this week in London on the body of an Irishman unknown has given the police an opportunity of letting us into certain secrets connected with the work of the dynamite faction in the Clan Na Gael We are told that during the Jubilee celebra- fires the chief of this notorious club was in our neighbourhood-not further away) than Boulogne. His "London agent' -one Mel Mile-was here with several comrades, but they were so well watched, that they dared not attempt any) thing, though they waited the House of Commons with Mr. Joseph Nolan, M P One of these worthies was called as a witness in the inquest which has just been held, and he had to admit that a newspaper cutting, telling that Mr A. J Balfour, the Irish Secretary, is due at Birmingham on the 4th November next, was found in his room Of course he repudiated any personal relation to the afore said cutting, but upon this we can have our own opinion The dead man had been a friend of his, and the police sought to prove that he also had had relations with Melville The intention of the authorities was no doubt to Beare the members of the Clan na Gael with the extent of their information, and it is likely that this effect will be achieved There can be no doubt that we narrowly escaped a serious disaster during the Jubilee, though the warning given by the authorities to General " Miller at Boulogne deprived them of the opportunity of making a considerable arrest. It was, however, thought the safer plan to scare him away. Mr Chamberlain leaves Liverpool to morrow for New York as chief of the British Commission for the settlement of the fisheries dispute The section of the American and Canadian press which is influenced by the Irish vote speak with a good deal of bitterness of Mr Chamberlain's recent allusions hostile to the Irish-Americans and to the conclusion of a Customs union between Canada and the States It may be admitted that the suggestion that the conclusion of a Customs union would lead to the entire severance of the English connection with Canada was not happy in the circumstances. But it cannot he overlooked that the show of opposition which is being made to Mr Chamberlain a mission, and the predictions of failure concerning it, are mainly the outcome of political hatred due to his attitude in relation to Home Rule Mr. Chamberlain's capacity for dealing with the matter he has in hand is undisputed, and it is too much to believe that if he is successful in arranging a satisfactory treaty, any malign influence will be allowed to wreck his work The demonstrations of the unemployed are continued, but they have become ridiculous The police have changed their tactics in regard to them, and whilst allowing the meetings to be held, keep a close watch on the mob and follow it wherever it goes The roughs find themselves checked and over west, and are gradually withdrawing from an occupation which promises no satisfactory fruits. Tbec.ty authorities and others are meantime active in getting at really deserving cases, and the Lord Mayor has issued an appeal to the citizens to contribute to certain changes which may be trusted not to blunder in making investigation and giving aid The last Mansion house fund was shamefully abused, hence we are to have no more of this sort of relict The bishops of Lichfield and Salisbury have been on a mission to the Old Catholic churches of German), Switzerland, and Austria, founded in the main by Dr. Dolhnccr after the proclamation of the doctrine of Papal infallibility, 10 years ago They found that the members of the churches are increasing, and they have succeeded in establish- ing very fraternal relations with the leaders of the Old Catholic movement. We have yet to learn how far the bishops have gone in this direction, and their report will not be open to us until the sitting of the next Lambeth conference in the spring What we do know at present is that their lordships have been acting under commission from the Archbishop of Canterbury.
