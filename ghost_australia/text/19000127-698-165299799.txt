Queen Victoria Personated. Is it indiscreet to relate that MisB Ellis Jeffreys ill private life, the Hon Mrs. Cnrzonâ€” once (for half a minutes impersonated the Queen ? It was at the famous bazaar at the Albert Hall, for the benefit of the Chariug Cross Hospital, where most of the Duchesses and the prettiest of the actresses of England acted as saleswomen. Miss Jeffreys, who who is a most accomplished beggar, worked like a Trojan for two days, and ' pedaled ' a lot of trifling fancy articles for a goodly sum. On the second day people grew bold, and, as Miss Jeffreys is distinguee and always beautifully gowned, they kept asking her who she was, in the hope that it might turn out they had bought something of a duchess or perhaps even one of the Princesses. When she said ' Miss Jeffreys ' the women would sniff, and move away disappointed. ' Do they do that to you ? ' she asked Miss Hanbury. ' Yes,' replied Miss Hanbury, ' and I've had so much of it that it's beginning to get on my nerves ! ' ' I'll tell you what we should do,' exclaimed Mi9B Jeffreys ; ' let us give them what they want ! Tell the next one that asks you that you're the Duchess of Suther land, and I'll say I'm the Princess Hbnry of Pless !' ' Oh f I would not dream of doing such a thing, and neither would you ! ' returned Miss Hanbury. ' Watch me ! ' was the reply. Just then a most vulgar and impertinent woman, the worst type of nouvelle riche, came up and bough something of Miss Jeffreys, eyeing ber all over, and finished with : ' Tell me which one you are ! ' Drawing herself to her full height, and, putting on her most imperious expression, Miss Jeffreys said, in a particularly firm voice : ' Madame, I am the Queen ' ' The woman made off as if she had Been a ghost, evidently thinking she had to do with a lunatic, and Miss Jeffreys, who considered that any thing more would be anti-climax, promptly went home.
