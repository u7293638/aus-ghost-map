Select Poetry. THE PREMIER AND THE SYDNEY GHOST. What makes him look so pale this week, Why are his cheeks so white? His eyes that used to be to meek Now glaring with affright. His speech has lost its fine old tone, His usual fire doth lack? What is it alis our Robertson, What harms our gallant Jack? Has Forster, that official bore, With his cantankerous talk, Gone nigh, as he has gone before, His leader's plans to balk? Is it that Egan's proved a fool, And Josephson a muff? Or does he find financial Saul More trouble than enough? 'Tis not that Forster gives him pain, For Jack has held him fast; And Duncan now is back again,— The estimates are passed. The ancient Egan's grown quite brisk In sorting letters right, The letters of the official desk He leaves his clerks to write. No, 'tis not this which troubles Jack, And makes his face so white; 'Nor that the members at his back Sometimes dispute his right. His voice has lost its gallant tone, We hear not now his boast— An altered man is Robertson, For he has seen the Ghost!
