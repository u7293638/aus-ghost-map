AMÜSEMENTS. "Hamlet." PEorLE nowadays look for tho senatlonnl and thc spectacular in their dramatic pabu lum, In these circumstances, the fairly numerous nudience which witner.ed Mr. Alfred Dam pier's production of " Hamlet" Inst evening must ho tnken as a compliment to thc veteran actor's well-known ability to interpret tile difficult title rôle,- Considering that this excursion into the realms of the" legi- timate" was for one night only, the jileco wa» mounted with remarkable thoroughness. A quantity of scenery had boen freshly painted for thc piece, nnd tho settings were, for the most part, effective. Mr. Dampier has familiarised playgoers with his scholarly interpretation of Hamlet, wherefore it is pot necessary to enlargo upon hts conception. Enough to* Bay that it continues thoroughly nrtistic, ns well as convincingly powerful. Thc soliloquies wcro delivered with eloquent fervor, and each won applause. In the powerful scene with Ophelia and thc Queen his emotion communicated itself to the audience. A good deal of humor was got out of the gravediggers' sccno, and this light leaven was duly appreciated. Miss Rose Dampier was fairly successful in the part of Oplelin, especially in thc mad scene. As the ghost Mr. Edmond Holloway was impressive. Mr. A. Rolfe made n handsomo and manly Laertes, while Mr. John Fordu's Polonlus was masterly. Mr. F. C. Appleton made a fairly dignified King Claudius, and ns the Queen Miss Katherine Russell was well placed. Mr. George Muller scored as usual in Ids old part of First Gravedigger, and the others were satisfactory. To-night there will bo produced a drama- tised version ot Marcus | Clarke's popular work, " For the Term of his Natural Life." Mr, Dampier will anpear in his original character of thc Rev. Mr. North.
