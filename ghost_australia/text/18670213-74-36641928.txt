THE BATTERY. A GENTLEMAN looking over the files of the Examiner lighted upon a little article pub lished in December, 1864, which alluded to that costly but now ruined erection, and requested the paragraph might be reproduced. It is as follows: "A cor respondent: says he has lately had a con versation with a builder respecting new battery now in course of erection at Cormiston Reach, on the River Tamar. The conditions of the tender were - That the contractor should be a practical man Is this the case? 2nd. That bricks burned till they were black, similar to those in front of the Public Buildings, should be used in every part of the work: Has this been attended to? 3rd. That a Government officer would be constantly on the ground overlooking the work : Is there such constant inspection ? It is de sirable that the construction of the bat tery should be carried out in accordance with Colonel Chesney's instructions, otherwise after it is finished and paid for it may be found useless for the pur pose it was designed for. No time should be lost in instituting strict enquiries into, the affair." We leave our readers now to survey the ruin they have got for their hard earned and wasted cash. This is a type of "the reproductive works" of which we have heard so much. YESTERDAY morning,' according to provious announcement, the tug. Tamar loft the wharf with a party of about 250 of the friends, teachers, and children of the Wesleyan Sunday Schools, for the purpose of proceeding to George Town on a pleasure excursion. Un. fortunately the weather was most unpropitious and when the steamer had got as far as Freshwater Point, it was thought advisable byl a majority of those on board to return to town. Accordingly the vessel was put about and the disappointed excursionits' soon found' themselves once more or terra firma... On; landing all.had their tickets returned to them, 'and arrangements have been made for the trip to take, place either this morning or on Friday, according to the state of the weather. A NEw set of regulations for the governanuc of the civil service in Victoria has hbeoni framed and gazetted by the Government of that colony. Compared with them our civil servants with "their littlegreviancca" are In clover. . IN reference to the noew tariff ofVictoria published in our issue of yeaterday, we learn that it has already come:into operation as tor fruit and some other articles. '?This will v?? seriouslys'aficct the trade between Tasmania and Victoria, as the princilpal of our staples' are specially :included in the Inqw. list of dutiable hrtields' It must be borne in, mind that green fruit, eggs, furs, hay, onions, timber, &o.;, are subject to an ad valorem duty of five percent.; all kinds ofgrain 9d per cwt., and when manufactuted 1l per owp;.and. manufactures of 'ill kinds ten per cent. iad valo erm. The tariff as to maniifactures and grain is not appointed to come into operation until the let July: next,; and has yet to receive the sanction of Parliament, ' â€¢ WE. have'. received No. 2 of.

The ear. toun represents perhaps the most prominent of the many farces that occur' in our legise latire-Mr: Lowes 'stamping under foot the Railway Act Amendment Bill.. The likeness is good, and the scene is one worthy of repro duction. Punch calls thies.l'a new way to meet, an old 'bill."' Five nimall woodotd of medium merit complete the illustrations. The following is our wit's opinion of a certain' Telegraph that has ceased to take part in public affairs- The Telegraph rag to the wall has gone,. And nobody seems to mindit .. I; For a dirty trade it carried on, And left all its debts behind it. The Herald-a thing of villainbonitype Lived long on slanderand lylag; Till at last a squeeze (rom the bailiff's gripe, Laid the venomous beast a-dylag. The Herald fell I But the Telegraph rose-- - A ghost from,the graveof; Murray; It srend Its friends much more than its foes, And was kicked to the shades in a herry.

Our contemporary saye " The small insetsa' that first made their appearance a few, days ago in Perkins's brewery are now very generally spread -over Wood's Point.

As soon as they nearly get through the wood the liquor begins to ooze out, and the animal of courso gete killed.' In empty or allage casks they go right through.
