SELECT POETRY. THE IMMACUALTE CONCEPTION. Forth from Heaven's throne there went a stern decree, God's high, eternal will, severe but just, That from primaeval sin none should be free, But all conceived in sin — all turn to dust. .Yet this deep curse on man, this high decree, This edict of Heaven's great, immortal King, 0 Virgin Queen ! was never made for thee : No spot, no stain to thee could ever cling. Before Him thou canst venture without fear, To kiss His sceptre and receive a throne ; Thou freely to His presence couldst draw near, Thou, spotless Virgin Queen ! but thou alonei Would not th* Eternal Eather keep thee free From every sin that could deiile on earth — Thee, whom He chose before all time, to be His Son's pure Mother, born to give Him birth ? Was it not worthy of the Son to take Flesh which had never been dark Satan's slave ? When He became a Man for lost man's sake,} Would He take sinful flesh who came to save ? And was it less befitting that the Spouse Of Grod the Holy Ghost should be most pure— Should need no contrite tears nor solemn vows, But from her first conception live secure ? The Lord Omnipotent her soul possessed, .E'en from the first beginning of His ways— . Her in her pure conception Pie had blessed With sanctity's sublime, unclouded rays. 0 matchless Queen ! the Trinity sublime . In thee does power and love alike display ; May we, by thee, love God through cur brief time, Through thee enjoy Him in eternal day ! Hegina sine labe oriqinali concepta I Orapro nobis ad te confugientibus. Bright Queen, from sin in thy conception free ! 0 pray for us who have recourse to thee. T. 0. H.
