NARROW ESCAPE. A grave difficulty arose among the officers of the Health Department on the discovery that a recently-ramved ship from Bombay contained not a ghost of a ra*-. A thorough search was insti tuted all over the vessel, but not one single rodent was to be found. During the investigation, a cat was pounced upon, and as she was held accountable for the absence of rat3, the authorities wanted to make short work of her. Poor puss was the cherished pet of one of the sailors, who declined to relinquish pos session of his furry friend. The ques tion was debated at some length, and at last the prisoner at the bar obtained a reprieve, and was released without a stain on her character, as her constitu tion appeared quite unimpaired by a diet of unlimited rat.
