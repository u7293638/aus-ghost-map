An Irate Poet. — — Never, elnce the days of Pope ancl Dennis, has anything . quite so savage appeared . in . literature as Mr. Robert Bro.wningsliftle ode. "To Edward Fitzgerald" onblisned in the last Athmetmn. Mr, A Id is Wright, in his . 44 Life and Letters" of the translator of Omar "Khayyam, had most incautiously admitted a hasty sentence of the genial "Fifca," which ran : — 4 ' Mrs. Browning's death is . rather . a relief to nie, I must nay : ao mora Aurora Loighs, thank God 1 A woman ofreal genius, I know; but what is the upshot of . it all! She and her sex had better mind the kitchen and the children; and perhaps the poor. Except in such things ai little novels, they only devote thamselvesta what men . do much belter, leavmgthafc whicfc men do worse or not at all."

I chanced upon a new book yesterday; Xopsned it, and, -where ray finger lay . "iVixfc page and uncut page, these words I read- Some six or seven at most— and learned thereby That you, Fitzgerald, whomby ear and eye She never knew, "thank God my wife was dead." Ay, deadl and were yourself alive, good Fitz, How to return you thanks would task my wits: Kicking you seems the common lot of curs — While more appropriate greeting lends you grace, Surely to spit there glorifiesyeur face — > Spitting rrom lips once sanctified by hers. July 8, 1689. - Eobsbt Bbowstikc, Ta&heammis; Should a great poet thus, for a fretful phrase, avenge the dead upon the dead, by telling him who was the 44 best friend " of "Lord Tennyson, and author, in the way of translation, of the 44 one thing done divinely well," that bis ghost is hot good enough to spit at ? Mr. Aldis Wright has cer tainly much to answer for.
