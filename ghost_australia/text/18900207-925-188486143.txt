DEAD BODY IN HUGHES' GAP. TO THE HUITOB. Sib — I hare been reading your paper, and I see your remarks on the deeea^ed dead body lately found in Hughes' Gap. 1 wonder you are so quite unfair by stating thiti under the circuniuancos nothing else could be done bat bury him there. The English Act of Paiiiament (states thai ail dead bodies shall be removed Lo a graveyard, whether dis covered on sea, or land, and it is tlie duties of police or coastguards to do eo. How, jf ihe people in vjiausioae, or :i person couiu hoi ue got to remove the deceased to a consecrated resting place, they must be pretty indepen dant. 1 beg to inform you Mr. Morrish reported it in Crystal Brook; M.C. Burton and I went there for the purpose of bringing j tLe body to Crystal Brook, and if Christianity exists so nrach in Soutii Australia, 1 beg to inform you there beats a far better charity in the three kingdoms (our Mother Country^, than in all the AustnUias ; for 1 have *ee'n dead bodies that have been three months or more in water lifted l-y sailors, brought to a harbour, and the Water Police promptly conveyed the body to the graveyard. Tliose who were in suck a hurry to Jay him there should be made to lift him. What about myself or others who have, perhaps, to trove through that Gap at midnight ? We cannot be expected, to have our thoughts iiwiriiii:^- o;i anything else. What with bad reals and tired horses I think it its unpler.^aat. s;i ^ on have hit the wrong anil on li:e head t,ver t!=Is case anyway. I am. sir, &c-; I-. H. HOLLAb. Crystal Brook, January 28tii, i«D0. [Mr. Holla! i must be very much at sea, for we have not made any remarks ie, tiicindiag of the body in- Hugnes' Gap. We' a! a very sorry for him, and hope ho won't b«s seeing any ghosts when he has lo pas» tiiaL v.av.— Ed.]
