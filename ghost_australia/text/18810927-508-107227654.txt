A Serious Practical Joke. During the voyage of the immigrant ship the Nineveh the dull routine of events was relieved to some extent by jokes, more or less serious, practised by some of the young female immigrants on each other. In one case, however, the result turned out very serious indeed. During the quiet hours of the night one of the girls, wrapped in a white sheet, passed from one bunk to another and aroused the sleeping inmates by pre tending to be a ghost. The shock in one instance was so severe that the poor girl lost her reason, and had to be placed under medical care. She was examined on the arrival of the ship here and certified to be insane, and was sent to Gladesville. The matter will come before the Immigration Board on Wednesday, and will be fully investigated, as well as the case of another girl who became insane during the voyage from causes not yet known.
