But when he reached the bottom of the hill there at the gate M IS For gue walking up and down as if waiting for some one-it might be himself, or it might be Eppie He would have passed with a salutation, but For gue stepped right in his war "'Mr Grant, he said, " it is well we should understand each other "I think, my lord, if you do not yet under stand me it can seal ever) be my fault I have taken some pains, both active and passive, to explain in) self " Come, come ' No jesting The time is not suitable What did my father say' "I would desire to your lordship a message which, at one pint of our interview, he gave me for you, had I not two reasons against doing so one that I believe he was not of the same mind at its close, and the other that I have made up remind not to serve him 01 you in the matter so far even as to take a message between you " "Then you intend neither to meddle nor make ' ' "That is my afFnii, my lord I have not the intention of taking your lordship into my confidence " "Don the unreasonable, now Do got down off your high horse Gmt you understand a fellow' By eli bod) can't keep his temper as you do' Befiel o mc, I mean the girl no harm." "I will hold no further conversation with you And I give you warning that whatever you insist on saying to me against my will I will use against you without the least scruple, should occasion offer, in the cause of Eppie 0f her friends As he spoke he caught a look on Torgue s face, and person ed a eli urge in his manner, and it struck him that it was not for him but forEppn he had been waiting He turned at once and went back towards the castle if she were on her way to join Foiguc he might meet her For gue exile I it to him, but he did not heed him, as if he had forgotten some thing he h listened back up the hill But not so much is castle of mouse 01 bud did he heal is he went He lingered about the top of the road for Inlfnn horn, but no one appeared. He turned and went back to the gate, but no one was there 01 near it. It was of no use applying to Mrs Brookes except she locked the girl as she could not keep her if she was set on going , neither was he at all desirous she should remain If she could not be restored to the care of her grandparents, there was nothing else to be done ! Again he set out to go to Andrew Comm and hold with him and his wife a consultation He found the old woman in great distress , not merely uns she sore troubled concerning the cahl she was not so able as her husband to think philosophically about the sad affair - but she had his condition also to make her unhappy, for the poor man was suffering great pain so much that the moment Donal saw him he went without a word to get medical aid The doctor said there was a rib broken got him to bed, bound him up, and sent him some medicine All done that could be done, Doing sat down to watch beside him He lay very still, with closed eyes and a white face But so patient was he that the very pain seemed to find utterance in a kind of blind smile Don it did not know much about pain , he could lead in that look the devotion of the man to the will of him whose being was his peace but he did not know about of what depths of suffering Ins futh lifted him, and held him for cling as it were in safe) for that faith brought him into contact with the life itself. It is not the faith that is the saving power, but the eternal life in whose aims it enables us to he Then in closest contact with the do me, the original relation restored the source once more holding its issue the du me love is pouring itself into the deepest recesses of the man is being, itself but a respect for the holding of the dinner and du most If this be so, who can wonder if even in keenest pain a man should be able to smile ' There are few who have reached that point of health that they can laugh at disease, but are there none Let no man say that because he cannot therefore no man can The old woman too, was very calm, only every now and then she would rather hands and shake her head and look as if the line case were going to pieces, because her old man lay there broken by the hand of the ungodly And doubtless, if he had him there forgotten, or the ill had befallen him because he was forgotten, then indeed the universe would have been going to pieces When he coughed and the pain was keenest, every pang seemed to go through her body to her heart Love is as lovely in the old as in the bungalow and when in them, as often, more so sympathetic and unselfish, that is, by no Donal could not leave her to the labour of watching the night long He wrote to Mrs Brookes, telling her he would not be home that night, but would be back to breakfast in the morning, and, having found a messenger at the mu, made his arrangements to watch through the night It glided quietly over Andrew slept a good deal, and seemed to be healing pleasant visions He was proving something of the yet uner ploted meaning of the words, "Ye shall be saved" Sometimes his lips would more as if he were holding talk with a deadly soul Once Donal heal at the mm mur ed words, " Lord, I'm a' year am, and after that he noted that his sleep given deeper nor did he wake till the day began to dawn, when he asked for something to drink Seeing Donal, and noreen ing that he had been by his bedside all the night, he thanked him with a smile and a little nod, which somehow served to bring to Donal's memory certain words Andrew had spoken on another occasion I There's and, an' there's a', an' the as and, an' the she's a " When Donal reached the castle, he found his breakfast waiting him, and Mrs Brookes, too, waiting to h el j) him to it, and let him know something that had taken place, which also concerned his friends Eppie, she said had the night before come in from the garden, and meeting her in the passage had burst into tears , but she could get nothing out of her, and had sent her to her room This morning she had not come down at the proper time, and when she sent after her did not come Then she w cut up herself and found her in a strange mood She would explain nothing only declared herself determined to leave the castle that all) day, and she was now packing her things to go nor did Mrs Brookes see any good in trying to prevent her Work was worthless when the heart was out of it Donal agreed with her, and said if only she would go home there was plenty for her to do there, for her grandfather was in bed with a broken rib and very feverish, old people's bones w e e be little and not easy to mend ' There would be plenty to do before they got him round again Mrs Brookes agreed it would be the best thing for her to go home where she would be looked after by those who had a better right and a smaller house The girl would never do at the castle, it was clear! for her part she would not keep her now if she were to beg to star it was evident some nonsense was yet sticking in her head that would breed her grief, and she would rather it did not arrive while she was under her charge ' Donal asked if she could see that she went home Mrs Brookes said she would take her home herself adding "The loss is no an ill and, she's but lately they, are dum ken what she was he at She wants some of the Lords am discipleen, I'm thinks' ' ' "An' that ye may be sure she'll get, Mistress Brookes,' saidDoiial Managed by the housekeeper, Eppie readily added, and was even readier to go home to help her grandmother nurse her grandfather than she had expected For the poor girl expected the whole thing would presently be known, and was in terror of Lord Morven whom everybody in the castle feared-except Mrs, Brookes and Donal, it would have been difficult to say precisely why, or what shape !
