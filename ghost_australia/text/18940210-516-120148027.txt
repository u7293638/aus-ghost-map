''Go to your room now, little daughter,*' lie said, huskily ; ' g', dear, and try to sleep. I will not lenTC witnout -!omiug lo say *jvn '?ye, ijust as 1 always did.' She shivered and hid her face and dung to his neck, saying no word, shedding no tear. Gnntly he unclasped her hands. ' Yes, my child, do as I hid you unvv ; I want to speak \vi;h mother awhile.' And then reluctantly she turned, hut tiw one. liiief look into -his eyes was so fall of word lees sorrow th it he wus for an instant un manned. ' My little girl 1 my little Winnie ! don't look Rt your old daddy that way !'' he almost sohhed, as again he threw his arm urooud her, leading her to the stairs. ' \V« won't he gone long. 'We're all coming hack, dear; and we'll have a lovely Christmas, and you shuU have (lie jollicst kind of a party, prit. Uut he a Wave little woman now. It — it'll aM come right.' She turned with quick convulsive sjIie and threw herself upon his hwnst, again twining her soft erms a--out his neck, her deautiful dark Hair streaming in 4-ippling, shiinmeiin,' masses down over thn crtminy while wrapper. The hurst of tears would have '.ieon a Messed relief, hut it never came. A quick, soldierly tread was heard ou the plank walk withont, and then springing im the steos. Kven hefore tho rat-tat-tut Ht tho door she had torn herself from his arms and sp'.-d like a startled f iwn up the car pot ed stair.- ?
