NO. 16,RUE ST. SIMON. I. By ALEC. HOUMES, in ihe "all Mall Magazine." It was the height of the season at Ostend. The sun blazed down fiercely on the white plage and still whiter hotel-fronts staring out to the sea. But for the fresh breeze that found its way across the water, existence would have been scarcely tolerable. As it was, it became existence and nothing else.. The sea-bathers had long since gone horue' warda, and the bathing-machines lay in un responsive rows along the beach, Hire a lit tle crowd of iNoah's ai'ks In a shop-window. Up on the promenade, a few jaded passers by dragged themselves back to hotel or apartments ; occasionally a brilliant oostunie of lace and muslin, crowned with .ve'low' hair, flashed by. But Osteud was gasping, and for the nonce, dull. " I never expected it to be so hot as this," said Mrs: JeffrLa. iicrialfently. "'What rtli you 'bring .me here for, Charles ?" .She never addressed 'her husband- as- Charles except when she was annoye.! withi him. Some such thought as this was in his: mind as he turned lazily towards hey. " You wanttd to be brought somewhere,"1 he. said, " and I 'brought you here. Short journey ; charming piace,; good dinners ; delightful.bathing. What more do you want, eh ?" . "Why didu't^you add—' pretty woin.ii':" inquired Mrs. Jeffries satirically. She.eat bolt upright in herllctla iron chair on the ter race of the Kursaal, whereas heu husband lounged comfortably in his. This difference seemed to identify them at once. "Isn't it too hot to be vicious ?" he in quired. Mrs. Jeffries stirred uncomfortably. " Pretty women," he went on, " arenas much an adjunct to life as good horaee. 'Buj&~ they are nJt necessities." Then he ;^eij with a laugh, " We keep bicycles now.l" iMrs. Jeffries got up and shook out her parasol. "I suppose," she remarked, "it's, time for lunch." "I suppose it is," declared Oharle.; duti fully. , . "I hope those rowdy Americans won't sit at the table next ours again," pursued Mr*l Jeffries, as they made their way dtfwu th^ Kur&aal; ste,ps. "You didn't like them, did you, Charles ?'* "I • did't mind them," said Charles ab sently, and then he stopped short suddenly, and put up his hand over his ayes arid stared. \ Mrs. Jeffries fallowed his glance, ami saw lhat it rested on a slight fragile woman in black, who was buying roses from a flower girl, .md choosing tlvjm carefully, almost She stood profile-way towards them, and Mrs. Jeffries had time to ooserv-e, .before she moved,, thai 3he had a very pretty profile, ami exquisite, though exceedingly delicate colouring. : "Do you know ha&; Charles ?" she whis pered, and just '.hen the woman turned and faced them. i • 11. The Jeffries had finished dining at 0s«" lend. They were, sitting at*a little'table in the veranda of the. Hotel Continental, facing the sea. On the table a great mass of white and- red. rosee perfumed the air. The electric light was shaded with red shades, and tho raeniu-card lying in front lof Isabel was pink, outlined in scarier. It all looked very luxurious and voluptuous, i even to her luxuriously-accustomed oyi-B, and she gave a little sigh- of content as s.'io sipped her coffee. "This is very pleasant, Charlie,"' she >aii!. Outside, a purple-light of shadow lay <n sea and land. The distant horizon looiu-i! ! like a streak of silver. Against v a Heat of fishing-boats waited for the iinrojuiutf ; tide, while.nearer all was dark nm! purjiJe |.and mysterious. A ceaseless throng (:r ! people passed to and fro the \viudows^>f tbu hotel. % .Well-dressed, respectable bursh'Ji* I people, some of tnem ;. some of them slobby i and poor ; some merely rough loafer;-. ■ IV.it ! one and all every now and then stopyic-.l tt> throw curious glancos at, and make mhoi-lss concerning, those within. Charlie ■Jefl'rirj.s saw it, and was annoyed. Isabel JoiTries saw it, and laughed. Suddenly she leaned forward and loucheil him on the sleeve with her fan. " chart L*, Charlie, do look !" she cried ; " there i;j ihn same woman we mot on the pier to-day, and who was so like some one you ones: knew. There,she is—there ! There :" In her eagerness to point her out, slu> half; rose from her seat, and was astonished at the'peremptory way in which her husband forced her back again, his grip closing on her wrist like Iron. " Sit down," he commanded ; "ii i? not' her at all. It is—some one—quite differ ent!" Yethe was straining his eyes ac he: spoke to distinguish the different faces in. the crowd moving past them below—faces but partially illumined by the electric light from the dining-tables. All at once hia look concentrated. He had found her. She was standing a-^little in the background ;. the same slender woman in black —the bunch of half-dead roses pinned" to her bream. She was looking straight in his direction— indeed, straight at him. For a brief seoond their eyes met, then hers fell. She put up her hand hurriedly to the roeos. as though some ono had been seeking to rob her of them, and hastened away. .Jeffries turned back to his coffee. " If you have finished, let us go-." sug gested his wife. " That woman teems to haunt us. She makes me quite nervous." They had to traverse the whole length ot the veranda -to reach the entrance. Aa they passed down the narrow passage, all eyes followed them ; the women particularly looked with envy at Isabel's inagnlfjecut diamonds and gorgeous brocaded wrap. " Say," said a large florid woman in Wua satin, who made one of a party of six noa* the door. " Wasn't that Charlie Jeffrie* who went out just now ?" "Of course it was/ some one replW, "Not Unow-CliarlleJeffrie* ? WtiatVcouie over you, Florrie ?" , "Wbat's come over him 7" was the quick retort. '.: " He, looks as though he had Been a ghost..

She did not notice- them, or at least did not identify them. She was looking straight • in front of her, with that tearless look of intense suffering which only real tragedy can give. A few paces up. the street, op posite an oil-lamp, they paused, and the ser vant hastened toT unlock a door. Then, the •woman turning towards them, Isabel could see in the dim light how beautiful she was. Another instant, and she had vanished, and the door was locked and closed behind her.. Charlie Jeffries shook himself free from his wife's arm, and stared blankly at the spot where she had disappeared. Then lit? ran his eye along the numbers over the tllfforcnt doorways. "It must be sixteen," lie muttered to himself. Isabel scarcely lietded him. The woman got strangely on 3ier nerves. " Let us Ret out of this horrid little street, Charlie. 11 she said, and they hurried on. . At the corner her husband stopped to light n. cigarette, and Isabel never noticed that as he struck the match ho b.6ld it up high with it view to ascertaining the name of the ptreet. It was painted just above tlieir heads in very much worn letters; " Rue St. BiiaoD." The Hotel Continental at Osterid owns a ■tiny ..

She had a very long nosg and tbin lips, and large, rather pale eyes Men liked her, because she amused them ; wo, men liked her, because they dared not ao ? Drinking her coffee thus at f) o'clock, two or three' mornings after Isabel's nocturnal ramblojs. with her husband, Lady Stacy was concerned- lo notice Charlie Jeffries walk swiftly out of the veranda leading from his room,, and go straight to' the" hotel entrance, too much preoccupied'apparently to give ha ladyship his usual pleasant greeting.

No, no, sho is i\n impossible woman." !' Possible or impossible, she is rather nice, and I h6pe, I do hope, you will leave her to her own devices in -this matter.'L Lord Stacy turned, as if to go. " I shall do nothing of the- sort," declared Lady Stacy; ..firmly. " Those two • young ->eople:want'guiding. I consider it my fluty; to'guide them. They are so constituted; that if they get into a muddle % it will be a lesperate muddle. Allow me tbylmow best. In this case at any rate." Lord 'Stacy :took a step or two across the courtyard. Then he came back to his wife's, side. ' "At least don't interfere until you are certain," he pleaded. " Jeffries has looliefl worried lately, I admit. But it may be ai] of thing's ; betting, bills, or—or—per haps his mother's ill." - Lord Stacy was no 1 nuick at ideas. "At any rate, leave them alona until you arc more sure of- your •"acts." But the only satisfaction he could obtain from his wife was a dubious "-H'm." Isabel was unhappy. For the first time In her life she knew what it was to cry her heart out. So much in earnest ..was she in her grief that she never noticed whether her eyes were red or her nose swollen. Charlie was neglecting her ; there could no longer be any doubt of that. For merly he had waited until she was ready to come and watch him before he went for his -sea-dip. Now he rushed off at some un e.arthly hour, when she-, was only half-way .through her toilette, and as. often as. not ha did not reappear until -lunch-time.;'. His ex cuses, .too, twere of the vaguest. -He had not slept well, and wanted his fresh air quickly ; he had met another chap, and they had gone off to play billiards. In short, it appeared to Isabel that her husband was more than liegleuting her ; she felt sure he .was in love with "some other woman. Jealousy, over ready to quicken the wits to their uttermost, made a new woman of her. She became as sharp as a needle ; the cleverest lawyer in England could not have deduced facts from circumstances more 'bril linntly and more wholly hypothetlcally tbau did-site. And at length sho did more than argue to hersplf and question her husband; she acted on her instincts. On the fifth morning since her sus picionr- had been aroused she dressed quickly. When ho -went out, she slipped out, 'too. She caw .his coat-tails disappear ing dowu n side street ; and cautiously, for jealousy made her cautious, sho ran in that direction. 'He turned to the left down yet another street, narrower than the first. * It was the 'Rue St. Simon ; Isa!bcl noticed that almost 'mechanically. Then, aa she gained on him an-d feared that he might look round, sho hid in an open doorway on the opposite side of a street. Ho Hi ad slackened his pace.

He was quite at houne there, then. He had not even knocked or rung the (bell. With quickening breath.

Lady Stucy decided to call%on Isabel that •morning.

Lady Stacy thought otherwise. She found 'Isabel, as She had expected to •do, sitting in a dark rooiin, clutching eau de-cologue. . , "My dear, Ifear you've got a iheadache/' she said, " and that <l am disturbing you."

She ".was (face to face with'a first real trou ble, and she needed a woman and a woman's sympathy very 'badly. So she poured out a fairly incoherent tale, which was sufficient ly rambling to be not wholly (condemnatory of her (husband, and then turned her face : to the sofa- cushions, and sobbed. " Of • oourse," said Lady Stacy, "'there is only one way" out of it. You can't epeak co Charlie, about It." "Oh, no, Jo, no," she eoibbed.; "Then, you must go to .the woman and :«y.you iwill expose her to (her hudband it she doesn't :give him up this.', inalant."

It casl flercft-*ehadows on the opposite jeide of the road^-Jblack' shadows _ that startled Isabel -with their distinctness ac she hastened along. <She had preferred to- walk, in spite of her toest clothes and the'"heat. Clothes bp.d' always been Isalbel'6 great stand-toy. She had counted • on her 'wedding-dress as -oeing 'bhe one thing.likely to'get her safely through : the wedding ceremony; and now she .depended ou a igau'zy arrangement of pink chiffon and lace to give jher superiority in iher .rival's eyes. 'She had left her hus band playing ecarte with Lord Stacy. It was a good opiportunity, therefore, to do what had to be done.quickly and effectively. A. shy. frightened, little maidservant show ed her announced into the aitting- raom. It was a very tiny room, and the outside blinds being drawn to Heap out the sunshine, it ap peared very dark to Isabel's dazzled eyes. At first sine thought she was alone in it. but almost kniniediately a tall alight form iv tbleck rose from the red velvet sofa in the middle of the room and advanced to meet her. "Pardon,' 1- said a clear,, low voice, which had in it almost a ring df, Charlie's, or so it appeared-to *'Isaibel—" Pardon : I did not catch the naime. Pjerhaps .niadarae ha 9 come about the singing lessons ?" '"'Certainly not"," said 'Isalbelr SHo had grown more accustomed to the light now, or rather to the want of light, and she could see- that-'the woman'in black. before* her looked very pale and worn, and that she was not so beautiful without thd acconipani iment of hat' and veil. Still, s*he was ex ceedingly ■• attractive, and a pang sihot through Isabel's heart. iCoul'd the pink game7 and the lace una'ke up ifor that clear skin, those liquid eyes (co strangely, by the way, dike her own husband's), thoso pencilled brows, and even white teeth ? iAlus ! alas !—had iher rival 'been ugly she imight have forgiven her ; tout there was no denying that ehe toad once been a very love ly woman, and lolbel hated her accordingly. " 1 have come to get him ibaek again,"? she said aJbruptly. « iA flush rose all over t/ne woman's face. " Him ? Whom ?" sine asked. ' "My husband," said Isabel, and went a stop nearer to her. Tne woman retreated to the sofa, and clutched it wildly. She .had grown ashy white now. " Your—your husband!" she gatpeil. "Yes, niy.ihusband," repeated Isabpl stern ly. Guilt,.* she felt sure, was written all ovtu1 that shrinking for-m. "He has been to 'sej you. 'He comes hero frequently;- I won't have it ! Do you hear ? I won't have it !" She ppoke menacingly. " But I assure you I never meant him to," cried her skrinking victim, and she put out both her hands imploringly—"l never meant i to. He came of his own accord. I begged ■him not. What was the use, I said. of bringing up the whole old story again ? I could never belong to him—to any one— like that again. I begged him to go away— tout he ; would.come—?he> would -see me, -and hoar aH'about •" everything—^aboiit the child— the boy. . ..I assure youl I did my best to prevent it—my very, very., best—i I.? • •" She stopped short, with a frightened cry. Isabel was standing, over her like^ young tigres?. " Whaf child?" she hissed, looking right down Into the other's face. " , , The woman, seemed to sink away. into nothing berore her,gaze. "My—my child," she uttered faintly. There was a thick silence for a few mo ments that might have been cut with a knife. Then Isaiiel released her hold oC the woman, and .she sank onto a corner of the sofa, a huddled-up heap of black clothes and,shining brown hair. Slowly, very slowly, Isabel took off h«r glov.o. There was no precise object In doing it, but it relieved the nervous ten sion of. her feelings. Then, when It was off, and she could flick it to and fro to aid her speech, she spoke, coldly, precisely, her back turned to the prostrate woman whilst she herself .faced the window. ' "I will-provide for you and the child," she said— and the voice sounded unlike Isabel's voice at all, it was so deliberately "hard and cutting ; "I, will arrange tt through my lawyer. But you will-have to live wthere I wish you to live, and 'to swearl never ..to'see, him again. . As for. the chMV—lsabel's.voice broke, but it was. in rage, not in pity—" as for theohild^s .soon 'as he is old enough. I will have him sent out to some colony. He shall be well start ed in the world. I can do no more for you. .And you will be pleased to remember that, so far. as my husband and .myself are con cerned, you do not exist." ' She paused and turned round to see the effect of her words. Neither of them had (heard the door open meanwhile, and1 when Isabel turned it was to face her husband on the threshold. He had heard her .last words—his face showed that; Deliberately he went to the. sofa and sat down on It, . and took the cowed, weeping woman into his arms. " Etave you said enough ?" he asked, look ing up coldly at his wife. " Have you heaped sufficient insults oh my sister?" Isabel never .quite knew 'how she- got back to the hotel that afternoon. Her maid was very sympathetic, and brought her sal-volatile, and one of her prettiest dressing gowns, and br.usjhed" her hair lor her. "That always soothes a headache," she said. It was thus that her husband found her an hour N later. The maid retired discreetly as he entered, hut he had not even noticed her presence. He drew up a large armchair facing his wife's sofa, and sat down in it. To her last day it seemed to Isabel she would never forget that room, nor the blue brocaded and gilt -chairs, and the wallpaper with lovers' knots running all across it, and the tall gilfmirrora. " Well ?" interrogated her husband at length. " I spied on you," said Isabel bravely. She had nerved herself to say it, and now it was said she felt as though an iron bar had fallen across her hoart. *" ( "lam aware of that," said Charlie. " I want to know why." " That," announced his wife, "I must do : cline to tell you." Charlie 'Jeffries waved his hand, as one to whom the matter was of total indif ference. • "Having satisfied yourself of a certain amount," he declared, " I have no doubt, you would like to know all. You shall -know all. The—the—unhappy woman you were kind enough to visit this afternoon .Is ■my sister.. She has had a very tragic his : tory; - She left her home three years ago with a man who,was already married, >She only found, it out after her—their child \waa , born.

Then it was that I con ceived the hope"—he got up and moved restlessly up and down the room—" that we —you and I —might have helped to bring her. back again to her old life." Isabel sat up suddenly—and stretched out her hand to interrupt him ; but something froze within her. and the words remained unu'ttcred on her tongue.

In the dim! light the notes became a confuted mass, a .'blur of black and white, .and with a hea,rt ibroken dry of unutterable misery, she dropped her head down upon the keys and wept. ' And just when the door \va3 opened very rgently, and some one stole in—some one in •whjile, with her har twisted into;a hurried knot, and with all the marlt3 of "fa-hion and riches obliterated from her dress—and somo- Jiow, before either of tljem know bow it happened, they were in each other's arms, and, womanlike,, gobbing together.
