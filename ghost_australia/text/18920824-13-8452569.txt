The PRESIDENT took the chair at half-past 4 o'clock, and read the prayer LEAVE OF ABSENCE Mr WINTER IRVING moved that leave of absence be granted for the remainder of the session to Mr M'Culloch who had been obliged to proceed to London on important private business Mr J A WALLACE seconded the motion Agreed to Willis FOR NEW ELI CITONS The PRESIDENT intimated that he had issued writs for the election of members to serve for the following provinces in place of the sitting members who would retire by rotation Melbourne, North Yarra, South Yarra, Southern South Eastern, Nelson, Western, Wellington, South Western, North Eastern, Gippsland, North Central, Northern, and North Western THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF CLARENCE The PRESIDENT read a message from His Excellency the Gover nor stating that he had received through the Secretary of State for the Colonies an acknowledgment from Her Majesty the Queen of the resolution of Jsymj-Uh) passed by the House on the occasion of the death of li Hill the Duke of Clarence and Avondale PI SONAL EXPLAINS SON Mr ST ADVICE desired to say a word of explanation respecting remarks made by him during the debate on the Municipal Rating Bill last week He stated that two properties side by side on the Yarra bank had been valued at very diverse prices by different valuators and from the way the statement was published in one new paper the official valuator of the district seemed to think that the remark referred to him. He had assured that gentleman that this was not the case, and wished to make the statement publicly DEFENCES AND DISCIPLINE ACT AMENDMENT BILL Mr G DAVIS moved the second reading of the Defences and Discipline Act 1890 Further Amendment Bill The chief provision of the measure which was a short and simple one, related to lands purchased by the Defence department for naval or military purposes and vested them in the Minister of Defence as well as those other lands tem morally or permanently vested in the Minister already Clause "i struck out the existing provision allowing police magistrates or justices of the peace to be members of naval or military courts of inquiry or court martinis 'I he Sec rites of State for the Colonies had drawn attention to this matter in a despatch to His 1 vellencv the Governor and suggested that a bill should be introduced i enabling Imperial officers engaged in the colony to be tried for naval or military offences by a court composed exclusive!) of commissioned officers, and the Government thought it as well in the present bill to extend that provision to nil officers colonial and Impi all alike This was perhaps the only colony in which a court to the) military men for a mill tar) offence was a partially civil tribunal By the present state of our law also as regarded the power of challenge it was possible that the Governor might be placed in a difficult and embarrassing position, because if Grampians officer accused of an offence chose to exercise the right of challenge His I excellency would have to decide whether the challenge was legal or not Clauses 6 and 7 provided for the appointment of a judge advocate who would advise the Court and also the License 1 person upon any legal matter, and by the. final clause the power of the commandant to hue for breaches of discipline was increased from £1 to pay the sum up to which the heads of the public service had at present power to fine of t enders The bill was read a second time and committed On Clause "I, " Certain lands transferred to Munster, Mr KOIinm asked that this clause should be postponed, as he desired further information upon it Mr G DAVIS said the principle of the clause was affirmed 1 in the bill of 1899 The clause was agreed to On Clause 4, ' Power to let or lease lands, Mr J M DA. MES asked why the concluding passage as to the disposal of money derived was printed in italics This clause did not appropriate any money , evenly passed certain money derived from the leasing or letting of lands into the consolidated re Mr ROUI He? feared that under this clause any profit made by the leasing of lands might be spent by the Minister in reviews vic Mr C DYV1S-Jt is utterly impossible Sir will DI RICK SARGOOD pointed out that the clause required the Minister directly the money came into his hands to pay it into the consolidated revenue and he could not touch a penny) Mr SERVICE said as regarded the presence of the clause the only reason for the use of italics seemed to be that power was given by leasing or letting, 1 md to impose a rent But the words in italics did not themselves impose a rent It seemed rather as though the words pieced" them should be in italics Sir FREDERICK SARGOOD pointed out that the same procedure had been followed in printing a somewhat similar clause last session He would move as an amendment in order that the clause should not only empower the letting of lands now vested in the Munster the insertion of the words or an) lands that may hereafter be acquired by or on behalf of Her Majesty for naval or military purposes Mr ROB] lil S objected to a Minister having power to base j crimps for 21 years at a low rental land that might become ex ceeding,!) valuable Mr SERVICE hopedtheamendmentwotill not be pressed as it would be parting with power the results of which could not be fore seen As the clause stood the committee was dealing only with certain lands which they knew of vested in the Minister Sir! RKDFRICk SAI GOOD said the question was only whether I ends should be wholly utilised or not The power to which Mr Service took exception was already possessed full) b the Minister of Education Mr SHH\ ICI pointed out that a possibly corrupt Minister might let land for 4 years to a friend of his own without any) check air ntl DE little. fe S.PCÜOD had no wish topless the amendment The clause was agree I to On clause r> amendment of section 20 of the Act 1 665 Mr BROWN in reply!) to Mr D Ham said that by the section the words or being police magistrates or justices of the peace which were in section 20 of the 'Vet 1081 were repealed and the reason for the repeal was that the military authorities wished that affairs respecting them in this colony should he placed in the same position as they were elsewhere in the empire and that matters concerning them should be judged by null tary men Mr ROPritTS thought the war or is in question shall! 1 be retained and that men who had to be brought up before a court martial should not be brought up never) before in terested military officers there had been no harm done by the practice hereto in force in this colony of having magistrates on court martinis Mr MTLVII LI thought some reason should be given why the civil magistrate was being taken away from bemgajudge in affairs where he had hitherto been a judge It should be remembered that the men here were militia citizens and not soldiers Mr G DAVIs said the reason why magistrates or justices of the peace were first placed on court martials in this colony was that in 1870 there was a dearth of qualified military officers here and it was deemed advisable give the Governor in Council power to appoint police in magistrates and justices of the peace to preside at court martials as well as military officers Things had changed however and it was now proposed to place the defence force in this colony on the same terms as British forces were placed in and as the forces in the adjoining colonies were Mr KOBI HIS stated that the men here had been sworn in under Act IOS i and if they objected to this proposed alteration the) nights) the conditions under which they had been sworn were changed and they would resign the Government was proposing to legislate for the men without their consent Mr WILLIAMSON thoroughly approved of the proposal of the Government There were many military matters which only mill the) men could understand and he considered that they only should be judges of such matters Mr al It VIC thought it was quite proper to adopt the clause, and that it was access try to carry out discipline Mr D HAM stated that there had not been an) abuse caused by) police magistrates in their duty on court martials and the committee must decide on whether they considered it necessary to adopt the altered system Sir 1 R] DriUUC S \RGOOD expresses his assurance that the forces in this colony would welcome the alteration proposed in the clause The Imperial officers who came out here ought not to be judged by magistrates but they desired to be on the same footing as the other members of the forces here, and it was considered only right that offences in the forces should be tried only by those who understood military affairs Mr /I AL thought that if a man entered into a compact with Her Majesty to under- take certain duties which a civilian could not perform he must be subject to discipline The object of this clause was merely to carry out discipline and place our forces on the same footing as British forces were in all other parts of the empire The clause was agreed to Clause 6 was read as follows - The naval or military commandant (as the case may be) with regard to any case in which he thinks fit so to do so), with the approval of a law officer appoint a Judge of any county court or a barrister and solicitor to he the Judge, of advocate in and for such case Mr G DAVIS proposed alterations in the clause, which were agreed to, and which made it read as follow - The Governor may, with regard to my case in which he thinks fit so to do appoint a police magistrate or a barrister and solicitor to be the Judge advocate in and for such a case On clause 7, Duty and power of a judge adv beat.-, Mr ROBERTS said he thought the clause gave great powers to the judge advocate, and that further time should be allowed for the consideration of the bill, which had been only read a second time that evening. He moved that the clause be postponed The amendment was negatived and the clause was agreed to, as were also there main portions of the bill. The bill was reported to the House with amendments OAKLEIGH LAND SALES BILL A message was received from the Legislative Assembly, who forwarded a bill to enable the Oakleigh Shire Council to sell certain lands at Oakleigh Mr BUCHANAN moved that the bill be read a first time. The motion was agreed to MUNICIPAL HA UNG BILL The House went into committee for the further consideration of the Municipal Rating Bill On clause 2, " Computation of annual value at five pounds per centum, Mr ST It VICE moved an amendment that the rate be four pounds per centum He said it was stated that municipal funds had been greatly depleted by the alteration made last year in the basis of rating from D per cent to 3 per cent on the capital value, and that it was necessary to return to the old style in order to fill the cash boxes There was, however, perhaps not more than one tenth of the ratable property which came under the alteration, which was distinctly to be placed only on property that there was no annual rental from It was distinctly) meant to apply only to lands was held, from certain circumstances could not be utilised Persons getting an annual income from property yield ing 6 or 7 or h per cent ought to contribute to the formation and maintenance of streets, but men who had no annual income from land which they had bought and which they were not in a position to utilise should not be rated at the same amount as those who obtained an annual income from their properties Mr T] AL stated that the hon member, by his amendment, actually proposed that the basis of all rateable property in the colony should be reduced Nearly all the land of the colony outside the thickly settled districts might be considered unimproved, and the low rating should not be imposed merely to relieve people who might have made infor senate bargains in buying land which they were not prepared to utilise Mr SACHSE thought the amendment proposed would meet the requirements of his province, and he should vote for it, were it not that he believed Sir 1 Frederick Sargood intended to introduce a clause which would practically) fulfil the same purpose as far as as district was concerned Mr COUTTS had yet to learn where the necessity for compromise on this point was 'the Postmaster General seemed to believe that because the minimum was stated at 3 per cent, of a property were let at 10 per cent of its value, the value for rating purposes could only be computed at 3 per cent Mr /I AL had never said anything about 3 percent Mr COUTTS meant to impress upon the committee that the provision did not affect ratable property that was let in the least, only unoccupied lands which might be bringing in nothing for a merely nominal sum The clause provided that the value of these should not be computed at less than 3 per cent. Mr. I A WALLA Cr would prefer to support the amendment to be moved by Sir 1 Frederick Sargood, making it optional with a council to decide whether the company , tattoo of annual value should be at 3 or 5 per cent ' Mr ZEAL was inclined to support the clause to be moved by Sir 1 Frederick Sargood enabling councils to fix the computation b) b) law Jins seemed to be carrying out the principle of local government in its en tires) Mr CONNOR said if Sir Frederick Sargood s proposed clause were agreed to nearly all the shires would make their valuation at 6 per cent. Mr. ben lee s amendment however if made clear would give the advantage of the i percent, to those properties which were bringing in little or nothing Mr COU 1 IS believed that the only reason this bill had been brought in was because of a certain judges ruling and it was for the Government to ascertain 1 store legislating whether that ruling wits right not to throw the burden on the municipalities Mr BROW V said there was no difficulty in the case of properties which were occupied and bringing in rental and as regarded others Sir I redend S Sargood s suggestion would meet the case Although around Melbourne it might not be necessary to have the 5 per cent computation to keep the revenues up in some of the country shires in was different A"iievancein many parts of the country was that members of the municipal council themselves sat on the bench to adjudicate when appeals from ratepayers were heard ( No no ) This was the case and appellants consequence) still felt themselves aggrieved after the decision was given Mr PRATT thought it might he assumed as a rule that the councils, if they had the power would make their computation of value at 5 per cent. A shilling rate would then suffice and on it they would get the Government subsidy If a Is 6d rates were struck the) would only feet the subsidy at the rate of the Is J he instructions to valuers would therefore, be to compute at "> per cent firstly for this reason and se could) be cause a councillor would not incur the unpopularity) of supporting a Is 6d rate Mr SERVICE asked whether Sir Frederick Sargood s suggestion would refer to the whole of the ratable property in the district As the proposed clause read it did include all property but that he was dealing with was only that portion of the ant able property which had to have a constructive valuation placed upon it because it was bringing in no rental. It would also need to be made clear that a council could not compute the valuation of one property on a a percent basis and of another on a 5 per cent.. Mr. 1 EAST R said every man who bought pro| ert) did so believing. that he would get a return out of it and the question was w whether the House was going to legislate for a man who had been disappointed Mr ST RACE The law does it now Mr GRAnt held that all property whether occupied or unoccupied should con- tributed its quota to the revenue of the municipality) He should support Sir 3 Frederick Sargood a new clause when it was moved Sir RE DERICK SARGOOD thought that if as seemed to be the case the committee was practically) agreed upon the principle it would be easy for the Government to with draw this clause and draft another to meet the case Mr SARGEANT said that country municipalities had been much disgusted that they could not rate at higher than i per cent and he was instructed to support a return to the 6 per cent rate the rate should be uniform because most ratepayers would object to be rated higher than others were Mr GRIM\A ADI thought if a man chose to leave his land idle he should pay rates for it on a reasonable scale The amendment which Sir 1 Frederic k Sargood had suggested could be adopted because it would few e municipalities the option of placing the late at either 3 or 4 or 6 per cent. Mr. SACHSE held that in many cases where people were not deriving income from country kinds they ought not to be rated at more than " percent If Mr Service would withdraw his amendment that of Sir Frederick Sargood could be proposed, and might in his opinion, be accepted Mr ZEAL said the arguments of Mr Service were simply that the man of enterprise who improved his land ought to be heard) taxed while the man who would not improve his should be favoured with light taxation the mistake which had been made was to reduce the rating to 3 per cent. on the capital value and now it was proposed to return to i per cent. He moved that the clause should be postponed to give time for further consideration of the question. The clause was postponed Clause" Provision where improvement rates insufficient to meet payments under de ventures." was postponed on thpmotionotl Mr Zeal, and progress was reported THE WANT OF CONTI DENCE MOTION. Mr. ZEAL said it had just come to his notice that a prominent member of the other House had proposed a vote of want of confidence in the Government, and, according to the UBUOI constitutional practice under similar circumstances, he would move that the House do now adjourn. The motion was agreed to ADJOURNMENT. The House at 3 minutes past 9 o'clock adjourned until Tuesday). LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. TuEsmi, AUG. 23. The SPEAKER took the chair at half-past 4 o'clock.

OVERPAYMENTS ON RAILWAY CONTRACTS In reply to Mr W T CARTER, I Mr WHEELERsuidthatntthp time Wright and Edwards Limited ceased operations, an amount of £3,300 had been overpaid to them on contracts for the manufacture of rolling stock The pn) ments were made on the recommendation of the locomotive superintendent He was not aware of any steps having been taken in the matter RETIREMENT OF SEXAGENARIANS In reply to Mr. HOPKINS, Mr GRAHAM said that an officer permanently appointed prior to the passing of Ramsay's act, who had attained the age of CO years, and could show 15 years' service, could, with the consent of the Governor in Council, retire with a pension calculated on the number of years served THE CHARITY COMMISSION. In reply to Mr Zox, Mr SHIELS said that the Government quite recognised the importance of the work that had been done by the Charity Commission and the public spirit displayed by its members in the Governor's speech the hope had been expressed that the Government would be in a position to bring in legal history based on the recommendations of the commission It was almost hopeless to expect that such a measure could be carried through by a private member, and he feared that it would be impossible for the Government to bring it forward this session. IRON MANUFACTURES IN THE RAIL V AY DEPARTMENT In reply to Mr T. Son of, Mr WHEELER said that the Railway) department had a contract with the Victorian Rolling mills for the supply of iron of colo may manufacture During the last two years 118 tons of iron had been received from the contract! The department sent its scrap iron to the rolling mills to be recalled, instead of having to purchase new material 1 is two ears the saving thus made amounted to about £7,5M), being 1,080 tons at £7 per ton CONSTABLES OPEN THEIR SEATS. In reply) to Mr Zox, Mr McLEAN said it was an instruction of the chief commissioner of police that no constable should leave his beat until relieved, and there was no reason to believe that this order was disobeyed An) constable detected absenting himself from his beat without lawful excuse was open to severe punishment BUTTER BONUSES.

ordered by the House showing the cost of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railway Lys and also the work done by the members of the committee THE LASCELLES S AGREEMENT Mr SHI] IS said the Government was willing that the discussion of the motion tabled by the hon. member for Lowan re lative to the agreement with Mr Lascelles for the construction of a railway from Beulah to Hopetoun should be taken immediately after the refreshment hour on Wednesday if members whose motions appeared on the paper above it would agree to give way) RETURNS ORDERED D 'The following returns were ordered to be made of the motion of Mr M I CutTEit relative to railway contracts let since IHM on the motion of Mr IiioiiAltnsos, relative to the cost of arbitration on railway contracts THE BUDGET DEBATE The House went into Committee of Ways and Means for the purpose of continuing the debate on the Budget and the tariff proposals submitted by Sir Graham Berry), the motion before the Chair being That on and after the 15th day of August IS, there shall he charged and paid to Her Majesty) a duty of excise of twopence per (gallon upon all beer brewed A [stone from malt and hops exclusively and of threepence per (gallon upon all beer brew nil lil Victoria from Harrar or of which must forms an 1 ingredient, or brewed from an) ambulance or material other than malt or hops Mr DUNN said it was somewhat of a surprise to him and other members to find that the promises made by the Premier in his speech at Casterton as to the nature of the new taxation that was to be submitted had not been carried into effect in the Budget proposals Those proposals appeared to have been mined entire I) mtlieinterestoftherich 'There were various other matters in which the Budget is prepared to be going too far to be beginning at the wrong end and these he hoped would be so rectified that the Budget would reflect the opinion of the House and be acceptable to the country The Minister of Railways had his sympathy) in the manner in which he had attempted to carry out reforms, and whether right or wrong the Minister ought to be allowed time to prove the success or otherwise of his scheme In this matter of railway re- trenchment he could not agree with the idea that the man at the bottom should be ar an inordinate share of taxation and he trusted that the scheme of retrenchment would begin at higher salaries than those which had been suggested At the present moment there was great outcry) from all classes of people in regard to the proposed taxation, each class feeling that it was called upon to pay more than it should be asked to pay People were heard asking for free trade, and the I reasurer was being asked to consider whether he had not come to the parting of the ways (Hear, hear) Whilst acknowledging that there should be no cr) of "Town against country, but that all should work together as a whole, he had to point to the large sums which had been spent on Melbourne the corporation of which, he was informed, had never given a shilling to a chant and to call attention to the fact that it was now proposed to cut down votes which directly applied to the country The Treasurer had stated that the miners were the best protectionists and no doubt in the early day as when they were a power, the) decided on protection as a whole, but now the miners were found questioning the advisability of proceeding any further, unless the) received fair play) I he miners now asked that they should be assisted but, on the other hand, they were asked to pay additional taxation which would fall very heavily upon them the money voted to the country was spent in the most judicious manner Surely the deficit in connection with the Land Sales by) Auction 1 and could bellowed to stand over for a few years so that the municipal subsidy and other country votes might be continued as hitherto instead of being reduced as the Treasurer proposed Herewane feeling growing up that some of the reductions made in the Education department were not wise and that they would in interfere with the efficiency of the act The schools of mines and the agricultural societies had also come under the treasurer s retrench- ment scheme The schools of mines in his district had done splendid work, and he hoped the Treasurer would not reduce the vote No one 1 mix better than the Treasurer or the Minister of lands of what vase utility the agricultural society s WIFE and it was unwise to make such institutions Buffer He understood that the Government had decided, in view of the extraordinary position in which the colony was situated, not to adhere to the settled policy of the post in regard to the Budget statement and to leave it to be dealt with by the House as a whole As an independent member, he believed that whatever was good in the Budget should be accepted, and whatever was bad should be rejected He hoped it was not true that many hon. members were so displeased with the Budget that they did not intend to allow it to pass It was stated that the Government was to be turned out and that a new Government was to be put in their place to bring forward a different system of taxation hon. members were sent here to place the finances in a proper condition, and while they might not approve of the position taken up by the Government, to endeavour to displace the Government at present would be unwise in the extreme. Die one city that was before hon. members was to place the finances of the country right. Mr TPRGUSON was at one with the Premier in his speech at Casterton, when the hon. gentleman said that his object was to put the finances right and to reduce the excessive expenditure of the public service On that occasion the Premier spoke of an in come tax and land tax, but those proposals appeared to have been forgotten, and the proposals now put forward were as different from them as the noonday from the night for budget was neither fish flesh fowl nor good red herring Those with large incomes would not feel an income tax whilst it would be gin revenue Such a tax would be far better than the proposi- d taxation which would fall heaviest on the poor man The Government actually) decided to submit the man who received 10s a day in the public service to a reduction of two and a half per cent in his salary) j whilst the percentage of reduction on the highest salaries was only seven and a half AY li) did not the Government make the reduction 15 per cent on the higher salaries' Was the difference not too small between the reductions made on the salaries of members of Parliament, and that made on the salaries of Ministers' The Government ought in the present financial condition of the colony, to have reduced the salaries of Ministers from £14 000 to £10,000 u year and it that had been done therevvouldnotbesuehastrongdesireforolhce (Hear hear) The Treasurer had committed a gray e mistake when he proposed to tax the farmers and miners, who were the backbone of the colony, to the extent of 50 or 60 per cent through the Custom house on almost every) thing the) consumed or used In New South Wales the Customs duties ranged from 10 to 15 per cent with a large free list, in Queensland the lii"hestwns percent. in South Australia 2 per cent, with a large free list in New Zealand 10 per cent and a few articles 25 per cent, and in Tasmania and Western Australia 12 per cent. The Tradeshall representatives in seeking to have the excessive duties proposed by the Treasurer impose 1 had referred to the cheap labour of Europe which the manufacturers here had to contend against but they hurl altogether overlooked the fact that the farmer had also to contend with the cheap labour of India and Russia as those countries exported large quantities of wheat annually to compete in the London market with that exported from here He could not under stand how any member representing a corn tr) electorate could stand by and acquiesce in the large duties proposed!)) the Government being imposed If those duties were carried it would cause the miners to discontinue supporting a protective policy) as they would have to pay such high prices for their blankets and apparel Several areas had been withheld from selection in the North-Eastern district for timber reserves that were quite unsuited for that purpose If they were thrown open for selection miners and others living in that district would take up the land and cultivate and thereby add to the wealth of the colony. It was the producers who would bring the colony out of its financial depression by increasing its exports and every) encouragement should therefore be given to persons to settle upon the lands of the colony and put them under crops The Government polio however armed men couraging the growth of artificial industries in the metropolis and inducing the people to stop in the city on temporary high wages, while those in the country who wanted labour were unable to get it The proposal of the Government to require ever) receipt of 22 and upwards to bear a penny) stamp should be withdrawn as it would be an unjust tax on the small weekly wage earning class of the community The imports largely exceeded the exports Mr BURROO TS -Is that the fault of the Government Mr 1 TRGUSON -It was the direct out come of the Government offering no on couragement to the people to settle on the land and become producers It was useless assisting the manufacturers to produce more goods than could be consumed in the colony, as the markets of the neighbouring colonies, particularly) that of New South Wales had been closed against them recently by the adoption of a protective policy there. The federation of the colonies was the only thing that would save our manufacturers the residents of Bright were very dissatisfied at the action of the Acting Railway Commissioners in reducing the number of trains to that town As the one train which left there daily started at 4 10 a.m., the people from the surrounding district had to travel during the night to catch it which was not a cheerful under its! ing in the cold winter months In view of the fact that the train mileage had been reduced and that railway construction had been almost dis- continued some inquiry should be made to ascertain if the 1 400 men employed at the Newportworkshopswerereallj required there Another point on which he was dissatisfied was the reduction of the prospecting>vote The Minister of Mines had promised a reform in connection with the distribution of the vote which he had failed to carry out Mr PEACOCK He has not had the opportunity yet Mr H RGUSON -it he had he made grants to 10 different parties in the Beechworth district instead of dividing the money available among a few, so that some sub started result might be looked for' Simply to gain support He thought that if he spread the money among a large number of people he was more likely to catch the votes of hon. members Mr BURROttIS-I am sorry for your prospecting board Mr 1 FERGUSON-The prospecting board had done its duty properly but the Minister was wrong in allotting such small sums of money If substantial grants could not be given they should not be made at all.

The Ministry had done quite right to propose to increase the protects e duties What were the miners and the farmers to gain by a league with the freetraders and the cape trusts' He quite recognised that protection in itself could only give a temporary advantage to the worker, and that it was not sufficient to prevent the occurrence of such troubles as were afflicting the colony at the present time. He was disappointed that the Premier had not carried out his promise at Casterton to propose a property tax All the machinery was already available, and the tax could be collected very cheap) The Government had had the courage to strike at the sexagenarians in the public service These men were receiving compensation, and they would make room for the promotion of deserving men beneath them The Governor, who was the best paid official in the colony, ought to submit to some reduction of salary and hand over the difference to the Treasurer Mr W T CARTER-As a subscription' (Laughter ) Mr. MALONEY -1 he Chief Justice was the only man who should be free from all taxes but the Chief Justice was a man who would not accept such a concession, and therefore he (Mr Maloney) hoped that if reductions were to he made all salaries by could be reduced except those of £200 a year and under When the proper time came he would move an amendment to the effect that no salary) under £200 a year should be taxed Mr W T CARTER -That would be a no confidence motion Mr MALONEY had no intention of moving a no confidence motion As to the reduction of the salaries of members of Parliament, he was of opinion that it would be derogatory to the honour of the Assembly if they went cap in hand to the other House to ask permission to deduct a certain sum from their own salaries Ever) member could hand back 20 per cent off his salary), and anyone who refused to do so should be black listed without mere) Mr W T CARIER-I should be on the black list, then Mr MALONEY would contend that it was the duty of the Government to keep men earning no more than £2 or £3 a week in their employ, and he was glad to see that the only reduction of working hours was in the locomotive department AMien there was so much work to be done, the Government should make no reduction in the hours at all He protested against the increase of the postage to twopence, and hoped that, many event, it was only a temporary arrangement and he further protested against contractors, who took contracts on the basis of 10s 8d a day for workmen, reducing the wages to Is ada) he had all honour for those men who had refused under these circumstances to take less than the union wage He understood that it was possible that a man who was in unfortunate circumstances was likely to be so called from London Well, he would like to know what the colony had to show for the £6,000 year spent on an agent general in London. It would be far better to spend that money in sending a football team home, for a football team would advertise the colony better than an) agent general the Public Service Board should be wiped out. It was not right for the board to insist on the men and women who became applicants for positions in the service obtaining medical cer office tes when something like 60 per cent of them never got a situation In one case that he knew of a poor woman had to pawn her wedding ring to get a medical certificate Our mail service was a good one at one time but the Marine Board had reduced the pilots fees by) nearly one half Mr Gaunson, who represented the pilots, did not think the members of the board were worthy of his company and retired, stating that it was hopeless to expect to get fair play for the pilots II he board cost about 600 a year, and he would be glad to see that sum saved The would make one to move for a reduction in the estimates of the Defence department by 60 per cent. He would like to see dividends taxed when 14 banks gave me erage dividends of 6d per cent, going up as high as 17 per cent, gas companies as ernged 100 per cent, going up as high as 18? per cent, and insurance companies averaged 29? percent, going up as high as 50 per cent. He regretted that a differentiation had not been made in the duties on woollens and manufactured clothing There were about 791 hands employed in the woollen factories, and about 5,000 in the clothing factories Dress piece goods should also be taxed and the iron industry was languishing for want of more protection A higher duty should be charged on varnish in tins than on varnish in bulk in the in terest of the local tinsmiths He favoured the increased tax on imported spirits, in order to encourage the manufacture of spirits locally He had always been a consistent supporter of the stock tax as it would benefit our farmers The smallfarmerswerc the backbone of the country, and deserved encouragement 'The farmers should be ready to give the artisans and mechanics in the city some assistance in return for the stock tax If it did come to a struggle between the town and the country the latter would find the repre sentative of Ballarat, Geelong and Bendigo arrayed against them Although the German consul had denied the statement that cigars were made in Germany by prisoners and exported here, he (Mr Maloney) had received information that such was the case and how could cigar-makers here be expected to compete against cigars made by prisoners and by the pauper labour of Europe ' Seeing that nearly all the money that had been borrowed by the colony had been expended in reproductive works, such as railways or water works there need be very little apprehension felt as regards the indebtedness of the colony, especially when it was considered threatened) the whole of the national debt of Great Britain had been expended in we are It was to be hoped that our railway s would never be allowed to pass into the hands of capitalists or Syndicates, and rather than see them handed over to those persons he would join any flag of revolt raised in our midst Not withstanding all that had been said about the increased railway fares, the) were really cheaper here than the third class fares in England. He was afraid, however, that the butter bonuses would encourage the farmers to pay more attention to grazing than to the cultivation of their land, and consequently the railways would lose a large amount in freight, as the dairying industry would not give the same quantity of material to be car- ned over the railways as would tile cultiva- tion of cereals or root crops I he reproaches that had been cast upon Mr lInnco''k when he was representing Collingwood in the House for his statement concerning bankers were unmerited, seeing that out of 45 banks in Melbourne 22 of them had recently suspended payment The time was certainly coming when there would be a state bank Crises such as the colony was passing through had occurred frequently in the past in all countries, and the banks instead of stopping them had done everything to aggravate them in the United States of America in the year 1847, there was the anomalous position that while one of the finest harvests which had been reaped in that country was rotting people who were hungry) could not get bread The same sort of thing was not unknown ft here I Experience of the extortions of building societies and rash land speculations was not limited to Victoria, and neither protection nor free tradecouldsnvethe world from failures in that was wanted was that labour should be put upon a proper footing and the only way to secure this was to have a system of state socialism The working of the railway system by the state in this colony formed a great object lesson illustrating what could be done in carrying on commercial undertakings The labour question was the greatest one of the times, and the cry for food sounded loudest in the world at the present moment As Cardinal Manning had said, "Necessity) knows no law, and a starving man has a natural right to his neighbours bread " Men were actually) starving in Victoria, and want was what was driving man to suicide The day was coming when Australia would be made a glorious country, and no man or woman would ever want for food, shelter, or clothing (Cheers ) VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE Sir HENRY WRIXON said Mr Mason, I desire to move that the Budget proposals of the Government are unsatisfactory) (Cheers ) hon. members on the Opposition side of the House find themselves driven unwillingly) into the position of having to challenge the attitude taken up by the Government, and to ask the committee whether or not it approves of the Government proposals Some time ago when I addressed the committee, I expressed the hope that the Government would accept the suggestion made from the Opposi- tion side with regard to amendments to its proposals, and would accept them as free from any) political consequence Only just recently the leader of the Opposition, in a few words put it to the Government that this continual delay the stagnant position into which the committee is drift ing was entirely owing to the fact of the Government including in its pro- posals extensive alterations of the tants I would have wished that these suggestions had met with some response from the Government but I am sorry to find that the Government remained silent But while they remained silent, we find that from all sides of the House-not merely from our side, but from all round there has been one unanimous chorus of dissatisfaction with the ce proposals And we find when we go outside to the country, that that expression of dissatisfaction is there amply re echoed, and that there is a general feeling through out the community that the situation will not be met by the proposals which the Government have made The result is that Parliamentary government in Victoria has for the time being become waterlogged Mr WILLIAMS And it will sink next Sir HENRY WRIXON The hon. member will have an opportunity of more fully, explaining his views at a later time Perhaps he will now allow me to explain mine The state of affairs now is that no business has been done, no progress is being made, and the whole of the Government proposals are getting blocked, not from any feeling of political antagonism, but because there is a general and a growing feeling throughout the House and throughout the country that those proposals will not work Now, that being so, the best thing that the House can do is to arrive at a conclusion definitely before starting as to whether this committee as a whole supports the propositions of the Government It it does then the Government is entitled to go on with every assistance the committee can afford it If it does not, then it lies upon others to endeavour to get the country out of the difficulties in which it finds itself (Hear, hear ) What is our position in regard to these proposals, and what is the position of the Government My words may be few, because we have really so long discussed this question that there is in the mind of nearly every hon. member a pretty near conclusion as to what the situation really is And the situation is this Before the last general election we were threatened, of course, with depression, though it was then just beginning, and has since become intensified, and the Government went to the country with certain proposals to deal with the financial difficulty There was a general understanding all round that mere party politics should not enter into the issues at that general election more than could possibly be helped, and there was a general desire to assist the Government in any proposals they might make to avert the threatened depression and to set the finances straight That was the general feeling among political men and in political circles, and the Government seemed to have reciprocated that feeling, because they went down to Casterton, and through the Premier declared their programme, and it was substantially to set the finances straight Many different points were alluded to in the hon gentleman's speech, but that was emphatically the issue put before the country Some direct taxation was alluded to as a possible means that might be resorted to, and retrenchment in the public service was also referred to, but nothing was said in that speech, and no indication was given to the country, that it was contemplated to have a revision of the tariff (Hear hear) There was no suggestion that money was to be got by turning the protective duties into prohibition 'that being the position which the Government took up, the general election took place, and undoubtedly they were returned with a considerable majority, the majority which now sits behind the Government audit seems to me that if we are to adhere to the old Parliamentary constitutional usage and that is essential, if we are to preserve the rights of the people would necessarily follow from that constitu tion. the Governmentthatwas so returned and the supporters who were returned to support them, should have kept by the lines that were laid before the electors I say this for the simple and obvious reason that if a Government having put forward one programme, and having been returned upon that programme, can afterwards cast it aside and adopt another programme, then our whole theory of Ministerial responsibility to the people is gone, and the people are really only amused at a general election by being asked for their sufl rages and by being told that the sense of the country is being taken, and that the will of the country is being consulted and after giving their assent and expressing their will their representatives walk back to the House and express a different sense and exercise a different will The whole constitutional usage of 1 ntrland, which we have copied here, is altogether gone, and with it is gone the whole secret of the success of our Parliamentary institutions with it is gone all responsible lit) to the people '1 line is the position which the Government occupy Having been returned upon one programme, they now come forward with another fine new Budget proposes no sort of direct taxation to deal with the deficiency (Hear, hear.) The Treasurer in submitting his Budget certainly by no means diminished our responsibility in that direction on the contrary, he exaggerated it by at least half a million But they put forward this large deficiency, and how did the Government propose to remove it' Not by a scheme of direct taxation, not by reason land No, the only way by which, excepting a few imposts about which there was no dispute, the amount of the deficit was to be reduced was the imposition of these high tariff duties In this respect, it seems to me, the) use entirely departing from the programme which was laid down at Casterton Of course we quite understand how it is that these high customs duties come before us W e all know that it is owing to the hon. the Treasurer, and I may say that there is no member of the House who is regarded with more kindly interest than that hon. gentleman (( beers ) And I must certainly pay him this compliment in regard to his long and remarkable political career in this country, that no man can claim to have shown greater consistency) in the political course he has followed throughout (Hear, hear ) M) only objection team isthatheistoo consistent" Hear, hear and laughter) because it is to that consistency, joined to the labours of that committee of members of which we have heard, that we owe these present proposals of tariff reform The hon. gentleman upon his return to the colony at once reverts to the days of his youth, and, quite apart from the tu wer views of taxation which are coming up amongst us, the first and only thing he thought of was to raise additional money through the Custom house, and to revert to the protective duties by which he originally) made his fame That is why the tariff is now before us, and I think that, quite apart from what view werna) take of ciistomsdutics-whether we are in favour of high duties or of low duties, about what is we may) hold different opinions I think we must general!) agree that to undertake tariff reform in the manner which the Government proposes is to the last degree unfair to the country and unfair to this committee (Hear, hear ) No comprehensive reform of the tariff was indicated by the Government at the general election , but the whole of this vast and complicated machinery is now to be disturbed and upset in order that certain changes may be made, without hon. members having time to consider what the effects of the alterations are likely) to be The Government themselves have had no time to consider what reforms should be made, where the reforms should be made, and how far they can go in one direction without creating greater injury in another The only thing we know is that the Government, having put forward certain proposals for increase of duties, give a general invitation me) round to those interested to propose other duties after that, so that if we goon in these lines we dont know what it will had to, and we don't know what changes will be made, without any opportunity having been afforded for a coin prehensile reconsideration of the proposals as a whole If the proposals of the Government in regard to the tariff are accepted, we have no guarantee that we are carrying out the mandate of the country to set the finances straight. If the high duties afford the protection which the 'Treasurer desires they will not be productive of revenue nor will we be able by that means to settle the deficiency, which it was the special mission of this House to spirit Me cannot shut our eyes also to the effect which the tariff changes which the Government propose would have upon the general industry) and production of the country All these are matters which we should have an opportunity of considering full) and all these things we shall have to consider without due reflection if we proceed as the Government desire 'therefore it seems to me that it would be well to ascertain whether the committee as a whole do or do not approve of the proposals of the Gov ernment whether we believe that these proposals are sanctioned by the mandate which we have got from the country, whether we are prepared on a sudden to accept proposals of tariff reform which were never remitted to us, and whether we are prepared, in accepting these proposals for tariff reform, to put out of the question altogether the interests of the farmer, the miner, and of all the other producers of the country I confess that I can see no prospect of our being able to effectively deal with the problems before us on the lines which the Government propose, and therefore I desire to move that the Budget proposals of the Government are unsatisfactory (Opposition cheers ) Mr. SHIELS, who was received with cheers from the Ministerial benches, said, Mr Mason, I am in thorough harmony with my hon friend when he says that we have arrived at a point in this debate when it is absolutely essential that the committee should say whether they agree in the main with the Government proposals, or whether they disagree with those proposals (Hear, hear ) Every hon. member even the hon. member who has latest come into the house must full well know the significance of the motion which my hon friend has moved in such temperate language Before I pass on to answer the indictment which has been made against us, let me congratulate him warmly, from the point of view of a personal friend of long standing, on the position he has attained in this House If I should speak the sentiments of my heart, there is no hon. member to whom I would sooner commit the destiny of leading the Government than my hon friend Mr L L SMITH- I would not, for one Mr SHIELS -When the air is sultry a thunderstorm is welcome, and this motion comes I think, to the House as a positive relief (Hear, hear ) We have full well known what has been going on for some time past (Hear, hear ). In the language of a sport of which I have always been fond, there has been " sparring for we and for the last 10 days-(laughter)-and now we are in the arena and in the ring, and we shall now have to determine the issue which my hon friend has submitted We must " let I dare not wait upon I would like the cat the adage, and must meet our opponents face to lace The Government will know then on whom it may depend, and others will have to come out into the open and leave off the ignoble mask of pretending to be our best friends while the) are our secret enemies (Opposition cheers ) Mr. BAKER -Dont lose)Ourtemper Mr SHIELS -I make no complaint of the conduct of the Opposition in this debate (Hear, hear ) 1 he) have acted well within their rights and prerogatives They have discussed this most comprehensive Budget in a spirit of moderation, and on many occasions in a spirit of absolute generosity But there has been another kind of criticism to which the Budget has been exposed Don't let any hon. gentleman think that we were not prepared in bringing down a Budget of this kind, which demanded the largest sacrifices not only from this House and the country. Mr. GILLIES And from the Government Mr SniELS-\es, and from the Government, and I shall refer to the sacrifices which we have made in the public interests we did not think for a moment in bringing down that Budget that we would not be exposed to sharp criticism I don t object to that, for that was well within the duties and rights of hon. members, but there has been a criticism which has simply gone into details, which has avoided the big main issues to which the hon leader of the Opposition confined himself, criticism which has been carping and cavilling, and if I may be allowed to say so, mere fault finding A poet of whom we have often heard it is Byron, I think says "A man mustservehls time to every trade Save censure critics all are ready made ' Mr GILLIES -Those are your friends Mr SHIELS -I am making an impromptu speech in reply to the indictment that has been levelled against the Government, and perhaps my hon friend will indulge me with a little of that chivalrous consideration winch for years past he and his friends have always shown to me Now, ) young as I am, I did not come down by the last shower (Laughter ) Mr. L L SMITH- And you would not be missed Mr SHIELS-I know full well that after the birth of every) Government there is an odious afterbirth, with pains or personal hostility), because there is always a sore bended brigade who gather as into a cave of Adullam, and breathe and move with those who are ready to desert principle and party 'I therefore, sir, I am fully prepared, as every Government ought to be prepared, to resist those intrigues for office As Solomon says, "'there is a time for everything The deserter who deserts in time of peace is only drummed out of the regiment to the tune of the "Rogue's March -(laughter), but the deserter in time of war is shot Amid will tell my hon friends who have been in the counsels of the Opposition for some time past that there is a time when men who ran from their party, and prove traitor to their principles, the only result of which is that they involve themselves more deeply in the slime addicted their own perfidy and faithless mess Mr T SMITH -Rub it in (Laughter ) [Mr AN 'I Carter here made an interjection which was not audible in the gallery ] Mr SHIELS Do I hear the squeak of the trapped rat' Mr W T CARTER- you hear the bay of the English bulldog Mr &HILLS;

Do you think that a man in my position would come down to say This is a policy to which we are going to adhere every jet and little 1 But what has happened since then ' The country has been appealed to, and the great jury has given its verdict More than that, the Government has been largely changed since then, and therefore if there has been any material alterations of the Casterton programme, they have been explained in subsequent speeches is a Government to run its head against stone walls and attempt to do that which is impracticable' Is the Government to talk of an income tax if we know that that cannot be carried and, at a juncture like this, waste the time of the House and of the country by attempting the impossible ' But we have amply) redeemed that programme I never promised that a land tax would be introduced this session I said the very opposite 1 intimated that the urgency of the finance question was so great that we could not undertake matters of that kind during the first session I was amazed when I heard those who claim to have intelligence saying that I promised a tax on unimproved lands I promised a remission of the land tax, which I still think one of the most un- just of taxes and said that in the second session, probably, there would be considered the incidence of taxation on the mine proved capital value of land That is a totally different thing from a land tax on unimproved lands What letthelandof Melbourne with its palatial buildings escape taxation because there are buildings on the land. It is perfectly monstrous No Government with only a few weeks over its head so fully fulfilled what was she lowed forth I need not to into details Mr GILLIES -It is not necessary Mr SHIELS-Look at what we have done in that short time I then put before the country the most vital and urgent of all considerations-a consideration also lute and imperious in its character-that of financial reform I pointed out that the country was face to lace with the largest deficiency that had ever been, and a deficiency which had to he met I sketched forth a scheme of the strongest retrenchment in the public service, and said that after retrenching in the public service and the votes we would have to impose an extremely heavy load of taxation I have here docu merits which I at that date submitted to my colleagues in my own house showing that it was necessary, after all the possible saving. that we could make by retrenchment and on the votes, to raise the sum of JCMl 000 The Minister of Customs prepared a separate list and according to his view it would require £911,000 The policy of the Government was exactly the police) which the Treasurer announced in the House when he said it was our duty to pay off in the life of this Parliament the whole of the deficits up to date and when he brought down a Budget to raise £915,000 Does not that show that therewas substantial variance between what he has done and what was in our minds to do so far back as last 1 February I sketched out a policy for three years of retrenchment which would result in a saving to this country of £500,000 with £120,000 the first car What did the Treasurer announce' May more than the fulfilment of that hope and that promise Does that justify the charge that my hon friend has made that in the main issue there has been ft substantial variance' We claim no infallibility Of woman whom, we are subject to errors Can you find a perfect ideal system of retrenchment in which even one is protected from hardship' Can you point to no Budget or any single tax which will not perpetrate great injustice to individuals' that could not be helped But we were perfectly willing to listen to censure and criticism and we were perfectly willing to repair any wrong consistently w Ith the pub he interest My hon friend seemed to speak to night as if the task with which we were" confronted and had only begun was light and easy task H was the most cruel and unwelcome task that any Government in this country had to face But we set aside personal feeling and looked simply) to the states interest What do we find' No found that the Government of which my hon friend (Sir Henry) Wrixon) was a member raised the expenditure of this country is £3,137,000 in four years In 1885 SO it was £6,000,000, and in lSSbS9 speaking from memory) - the) rule it £9,045,000, giving, as I said, £1,117 000 of inflated expenditure during their four years of office. Mr GILLIES The figures don't agree Mr. SHIELS-In the lean times-the times when my hon friends had skimmed off the cream and left us the skimmed milk plentifully watered by hard times it turned out that, having been put on this side, we were face to face with what they had left us-a damnosa li trains -(laughter) of inflated expenditure of £3,537,000 in four years It means increased taxation of nearly 2400 000a year, and sold still-commercial depression 'the Treasurer when became down to this House to make his Budget statement, had the courage to strike off £45,000 from the municipal strikers £10,000 from the prospecting vote on sums from the votes to agricultural societies and other votes, but ""' given, as some were, to the point of a mutual admiration society, and Rains as the devil hates holy water the scratch back orator) that some of ra) friends use.

Mr SHIELS.-He handed over to us a legacy of great debt. He handed over to us over £G0fl,0b0 of a debt. Now, I appeal to the greatest financial authority that this country has ever had I appeal to a gentleman who was a colleague of the hon. member for the Eastern Suburbs, and who in another place on the estimate which the hon. member for the Eastern Suburbs brought down and showed a surplus, according to his own State- ment, of £39,000-that great eminent authority Mr. Service, said the hon. member had a deficit of over half a million. Mr. Service said that when certain recoups had been provided for the accounts as submitted by the hon. member for the Eastern Suburbs would have shown a deficit of £554,780 instead of a credit balance of £07,000. (Government cheers.) That was the statement of an inevitable authority-the greatest authority of this country. The hon. member for the Eastern Suburbs handed down to the Munro Gin eminent a deficit of over £000,000. Mr. G. DOWNES CARTER. What do the Audit Commissioners say? Mr. SHIELS.-I think I have proved that part of it. Mr. G. DOWNES CARTER No. You have not. Mr. SHIELS.-I have shown what Mr. Service said. Mr. GILLIES.-On an assumption. Mr. SHIELS.-On no assumption. The Gillies Government spent more than their revenue at that time to the extent of something like £000,000, which they handed to us as a deficit. During the greater part of their time the Gillies Government were spending nearly a million more than the revenue every year. Mr. GILLIES.-What has that got to do with it? Mr. G. DOWNES CARTER. Tell us what the Audit Commissioners said. Mr. SHIELS.-The question is, Was that money spent beyond the annual revenue? And there is not the slightest doubt that that money was spent, and the Gillies Government left us not only hard times but a huge deficit. The question is, How is this undoubtedly large deficit to be met? After all, it is as broad as it is long, because the late leader of the Opposition and the future Treasurer of the new Government, the hon. member for Bourke East daughter) both stated that the Government had exaggerated the deficit by £400,000, and in the next breath they said that the Government had under- estimated it by £323,600. I have a list here accepting the statements of the departmental experts, which puts down £323,000 as the additional estimates. £70,000 was the deficit last year. It is now, according to the Opposition, £1,400,000, and according to the Treasurer £1,300,000. How has that come about? Did my hon. friend the member for Portland , not know that the Estimates submitted last session by the late Treasurer, which were endorsed and never challenged by the Opposition, were not realised to the extent of over £800,000? Mr. DEAKIN.-They were challenged, and by me. Mr. SHIELS.-I give my hon. friend the credit that he alone of all the Opposition had stood consistent. He did challenge them. Abdiel like, be had been faithful till the lust. (Laughter.) He had been consistent in challenging the Estimates, and had not turned round like the weathercock sitting beside him. The deficit of £1,500,000 was easily accounted for. There was the deficit of £797,000 inherited from the Gillies Government, and the £800,000 diminished receipts for last year compared with the estimated revenue submitted in July, 1891, by the then Treasurer (Mr. Munro.) Mr. GILLIES.-What about the £900,000 Just j year Mr. SHIELS.-The hon. member will have sufficient explanation given to him before this debate is over by an abler man than him. Air. GI ELIES. Where does he come from (Laughter.) Mr. SHIELS.-The question that had to be faced was how was this deficit of £1,500,000 to be made up ? Mr. STAUGHTON.-By knockings shilling a day off the gatekeepers. (Laughter,) Mr. L. L. SMITH Now, that's a very clever interjection. Mr. SHIELS.-I am sorry I had no intima- tion of what was in store for us to- night, (laughter.) I would like to have got a re- mark made by the hon. member for Mel- bourne made gravely, and I believe with sincerity-to read to the House. He said, and said improperly, that when a Liberal Government was in power there was a danger of national repudiation. That was an unjust aspersion on the Liberal party. (Ministerial cheers.) It was a statement which should never have been made in a public place. Mr. G. DOWNES CARTER. You know I never said that, because you were there. Mr. SHIELS.-I lead it in the newspapers. , Mr. G. DOWNES CARTER-On was after dinner chaff. Mr, GILLIES.-Do you believe all that is said of you in a newspaper? Mr. SHIELS.-Was the way that had been suggested by the Opposition and by The Argus of meeting the deficit an honest, manly and English course According to the suggestions of the hon. members for the Eastern Suburbs and f or Melbourne, the way to meet it was to fly kites. (Ministerial laughter.) Treasury bills having four or five years currency were to be floated, trusting, Micawber-like, that in the meantime something would turn up. (Laughter.) What did the hon. member for East Bourke, the budding Treasurer, say? (Laughter.) He advocated the placing of the deficit to a suspense account. That hon. member said in effect-Do anything-do everything. in secret -hide the deficit under the Land Sales by Auction Smith. (Laughter.) Mr. GILLIES.-That is what you did. Mr. SHIELS.-Yes ; you are paying us the sincere compliment of adopting our discarded measures. Mr. GILLIES We are finding you out. (Cries of "Order" and "Chair.") Mr. SH1ELS.-The Opposition wished to have the deficit hidden from sight. They cried, " Do anything but meet it." Last year Mr. Munro did with their sanction .Mr.GILLIES.-Notntall. Mr. SHIELS-Place £750,000 on the lefthand side of the balance-sheet, representing a sum to be raised by Treasury bonds, Mr. GILLHjS._x.Ve challenged it. Mr. SHIELS The only man amongst you who took the honest, manly course was the hon. member for Essendon. " Ordc" "\LIKS'~Tbat won't do, (Cries of . Mr. L. L. SMITH You are always object "'is interruptions, when you are speaking. .' "I' don't you keep, quiet and let the Premier have his say? (Ministerial cheers.) Mr. SHIELS. £ hon. members will look they will see that Mr. Munro last year arranged that the deficit of £797,000, brought forward from the previous year, was to be met by the issue of £750,000 worth of Treasury bonds. That was exactly the policy that hon. members had been advised by the Opposition to adopt on this occasion. Mr. Munro had hoped for better times, and though that gentleman had been challenged with taking a pessimistic view of matters, I challenged him at the time with taking too hopeful a view of the future. He believed that that would have given him a sufficient sum for the year, without resorting to taxation to enable him to meet his engagements. What, however, did he get to justify it Mr. STAUGHTON The Agent-General- ship. (Laughter.) Mr. SHIELS.-He had the sanction of the whole of the Opposition except the hon. member for Essendon. Mr. GILLIES.-Not at nil. There is no foundation for that statement. Mr. SHIELS.-Mr. Munro had got the approval of commercial circles in Melbourne, of Mr. Service, and of The Argus from day to day for the course he adopted. I have got here an extract from The Argus. Mr. G. DOWNES CARTER. Another impromptu ? (Laughter.) Mr. SHIELS have got, fortunately, at hand the material which the Chief Secretary had intended using the other evening, but was prevented from doing so through sickness. Mr. Munro, I was saying, had got the strong advice of The Argus from day to day against additional taxation. The Argus pursued the same policy then as it was now pursuing. Its policy was " Do nothing, and do anything to hide the deficit ; don't take away anything from the importers, and don't put taxes on the people at these times." In The Argus of July 6, 1891, it was stated, " The present moment is not by any means an expedient one for additional taxation, . . . Not a new tax of any importance, but is to be specially condemned at this juncture." It further stated that there ought to be an early protest against any large scheme of taxation, and that the Treasurer ought to find his great resource not in taxation but in economy. Mr. G. DOWNES CARTER. What did the Age say 1 Mr. SHIELS.-The Age advised taxation, and sketched out the taxes that should be imposed. The Opposition and the Opposition press did exactly a year ago what they insist ought to be done now, and what they wished to turn the Government out of office for doing. In The Argus of 27th July, 1891, it was stated : " By extending the payment over a longer term than the Treasurer proposes we enjoy the chance of the revenue extinguishing or wiping out the sum of itself, as the receipts Increase with a return of prosperity." Now that was exactly what the late Treasurer did. He hoped for a good season, and took The Argus advice and he came down and announced his Budget, following outthevievvsof the commercial men, following out the views of the Opposition, and following outthevievvsof Mr. Service, and for following out those very views The Argus turned round, and held the Government up to public condemnation for doing the very thing it advised them to do. Mr. GILLIES.-Mr. Munro supported The Argus, and was supported by the Age. Mr. SHIELS.-The Government did not intend to pursue a Micawber like policy, trusting that something would turn up which would enable it by some mysterious process to wipe out the deficit. He believed that it was the duty of the country to meet its obligations like men (Ministerial cheers) "Naught extenuating and naught setting down in malice." It was the duty of the country to gird up its loins to pay off the deficit, and not to endeavour to delude the English creditor by bringing out sham surpluses-(Ministerial cheers) or simm deficits which would be certain to result in the end in the destruction of our credit. I will tell the hon. member for the Eastern Suburbs now what I told him privately three years ago, and that was that our credit abroad had been injured by the manner in which our finances had been kept, as revealed in connection with the boom Budget. (Ministerial cheers.) Mr. GILLIES.-You never told me that. (Ministerial cries of "Chair.") Mr. SHIELS.-I told my hon, friend when I came back from England that when dining at Mr. Goschen's table Opposition cries of "Oh.") Mr. GILLIES.-"Princes we have met." (Laughter.) Mr. SHIELS had to defend the credit of the colony against the statements made in those brilliant articles which appeared in The Argus towards the endoflSSO dealing with the finances of the colony. Those Articles tore the surplus announced by the Gillies Government to pieces when they said that the July interest should have been debited to the June quarter. Mr. GILLIES.-It has never been done since. (Ministerial cries of " Chair.") Mr. L. L. SMITH (to Mr. GILLIES).-If you attempt to speak you won't be allowed to say half a dozen words. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. (Cries of "Chair.") The CHAIRMAN hoped that the Premier would be allowed to proceed without so many interjections. Mr. SHIELS said those articles had stated that the charging forward to the future year the sum of £600 000 which had been spent in the previous year was simply cooking the national account, and it was the one thing which gave the English financial mind cause to look with suspicion on the finances of the colony. Those brilliant articles of The A rgvx had caused the greatest mischief in financial circles in England regarding the finances of the colony. The third great vital point that the hon. member for Portland had brought against the Government was that it had not proposed any direct taxation, and that it was unfair to the country and to the mercantile community to impose fresh taxation through the Custom-house. Mr GILLIES.-ne did not say so. Mr. SHIELS.-The veil is taken off. We have now arrived at the parting of the ways it is quite clear. Mr. GILLIES.-That is too thin. Mr. M'COLL.-You are a freetrader. Mr. SHIELS.-In 1883 I pledged myself to my constituents to adhere to the policy of protection, and side by side with the Chief Secretary I claimed from this House increased protective duties to the farmer in pursuance of that pledge. It fell to our lot to fight against foes by whom we were outnumbered, but now it has come within our power to mete out to the former long merited justice. (Ministerial cheers.) Mr. G. DOWNES CARTER-On are taxing everything he uses. Mr. SHIELS There are those who have turned their coats and their principles, and while some (excepting of course the hon. member for Essendon) sit on the Opposition side, others are in the Ministerial corner. A convert has been found in the hon. member for Maldon, for he was one who called for a repeal of the stock tax. Mr. M'EMTYRE.-And the Age backed us up in it. You did the same thing. Mr. SHIELS.-These are the men who are hungering after the flesh-pots of Egypt. What did the leader of the Opposition say when I was pointing out the urgency of getting through the resolutions before the House, in order that the duties might be collected? He offered the Government an expeditious and easy passage of our Budget if we would drop the protective duties. Mr. HARPER.-Increased duties. Mr. SHIELS.-Every speech made on the Opposition side, and especially that of the hon. member for Benalla and Yarrawonga, find the ring of free trade aboutit-(Ministerial cheers) and we have now reached, as I said before, the parting of the ways, and are called upon to decide whether we are any longer to have the policy of protection. Mr. GILLIES That comes well from you. Mr. SHIELS.-Every argument used was on argument for free trade. The hon. member for Benalla and Yarrawonga cannot deny that he urged strongly the duty of our going back to free trade. What did the hon. member for Castlemaine (Mr. Patterson) do ? He sat in the white robes of a penitent, crying peccavi, because he increased the duties in 1889. He urges us to go back. He shambles uneasily with peas in his boots to Canossa. The hon. member for Benalla and Yarrawonga said that protection had been a danger to this country that it had caused the over-population of Melbourne, and has brought about the high rates of wages paid to artisans. I say that every speech made, except that of the hon. member for Essendon, shows that the members of the Opposition are looking back to free trade. (Ministerial cheers.) They want to reverse the policy of the country. You see in this issue the first open and undisguised attack against the prin- | ciples of that great policy which has done so much for this country during the last quarter of a century. The issue which hon. members have to face is, " Are you willing to sail with the Opposition, with the hon. member for Portland at your head are you going further or are you going back?" One of the ideas which protectionists have in view is that it is necessary, if you desire prosperity on a safe basis, to provide the young with plenty of avenues of employment. Protectionists say it is better to have 10,000 men occupied in fifty industries than five, and it is to the credit of the miners that they have recognised this principle. Mr. MTNTYRE.-You pay them back now for their support. Mr. SHIELS.-Now there is felt the first wave of resistance to the protection which the farmers have cried for so long. The gentlemen who wish to succeed the Government refuse their support when we propose to increase duties by 400 per cent, on sheep, 000 per cent, on cattle, and 1,000 per cent, on horses. This party of justice, this party that wants to rule the destinies of the country, this party which wants to return to free trade, is going to turn the Government out because it has dared to give beggarly duties of 50 per cent, to the furniture manufacturers and the bootmakers. Because such protection as this was proposed the Opposi- tion stirred up representatives of the farmers and miners, and asked them to perpetrate a great act of political cowardice. (Ministerial cheers.) Mr GILLIES.-This is immense. Mr. SHIELS.-When I speak of the miners I have a good recollection of the powerful speech made by the hon. member for Benalla and Yarrawonga. The hon. member will not deny that from first to last it was tinged with free trade. I do not object to that. I can appreciate the arguments in favour of free trade, and I can understand that a man may be a freetrader and yet be the guest of Liberals. But what I did regret in a speech, to which I listened with pleasure, was that it had the ring-the venomous ring-of the aristocrat and the excursionists. (Laughter and Ministerial cheers.) When the hon. member was talking of the miner I turned round to the Treasurer and remarked, "The tone of that is exactly in accordance with the old idea, 'God bless the squire and Ill's relations, and keep us in our proper stations." The poor miner is to be held guilty of great immorality because he wishes to better the condition of his children, and not to allow them, like their forefathers, to burrow under the ground for life. That was a blot on the speech: (Hear, hear.) I say we are' face to face with this plain issue. These gentlemen are framing an indictment against the Government because we have been loyal to our desire to give justice to manufacturers because we are bold enough while granting the means of justice which the farmer has demanded for so many years to treat all classes alike, and because we are not going to be guilty of the foul wrong of separating the farmer from the miner and the miner from the manufacturer. Surely all classes equally deserve a measure of protection. Mr. KIRTON. - What does the miner gets? Mr SHIELS -I say that in the increases of duty proposed by the House, if there is a difference at all, it is in favour of the farmer The farmer gets £101000 m increased duties whereas the manufacturer only gets £131 000 Mr M COLL -The farmer is only making up leeway at present Mr J EBB-That is perfectly right The Government is giving it to them Mr SHIP IS -We are making up that leeway M) hon friend charges us with never having announced these particular duties Does my hon friend think so poorly of our intelligence as to suppose we were going down to Casterton to intimate that he contended to put increased duties on apparel, slops and boots ' He knows that any one in the position of a Treasurer must be silent on such points Mr GILLIES -It is too thin Mr WILLIAMS Sham and non sense Mr SniELS-Does my hon friend think that when we proposed an increased stock tax we were not going to treat all classes equally I said at the beginning that we intended to raise the Customs duties by over £600 000 I had in my portfolio a list of articles which was drawn up by the Commissioner of Customs In that list there were some of the very items which are now objected to but of course, I was bound to observe a wise reticence regarding the exact nature of the Government proposals I could not put before the country the particular items of duty that were to be proposed and hon. members knew I could not therefore in making the charge he has done my best friend has treated us as if we were children Mr HARPER -You said you would not increase duties Mr SHIELS-I beg my hon friends purdon If I said such a thing I must have belied the documents contained in my portfolio I never said we were not going to have in creased protection The whole drift of my remarks was in a totally opposite direction Now, my hon friends say there has been no direct taxation indicated 1 admit at once that there has been this change in the Government programme in that we have not introduced a proposal for an income tax There were two reasons for this The first was that the country did not make that response to our appeals ninth was necessary in order that we might feel justified in making such a proposal And as I have already said, the Government at this juncture must get revenue from all available sources it has no right to waste time in attempting impossibilities hon. members will remember the sigh of relict with which the announcement was received that there would be no income tax but to say that there is to be no direct taxation is absurd We are raising or endeavouring to raise a larger sum by direct taxation in the Budget announced that was ever intended at Casterton We have substituted for the income tax, a tax on absentees (Hear hear) We have substituted for it a stamp tax (Hear, hear) We have substi tuted increased probate duties, which will bring in more revenue to the state than the income tax would have done and I say that we were amply justified by the verdict of the country and the feeling of the House in not proposing that tax (Ministerial cheers ) should like to ask our respected successors will the) if this vote realises their hopes and they are transferred to these benches will they submit to the country the income tax vVe have dropped' 1 say no the in coming Government will practically adopt our scheme of retrenchment They expect to get office by gratifying those who are some who have not had the unpleasant experience of a Government sitting in this House and gored from all sides, forced in the country 's interest to do a great and needful, but most painful task lfthcsewcremylastwords I say that this country has gone through a steamer discipline than has ever fallen to its lot before The sky has been darkened over, yet I think there is now a gleam of sunshine Looking abroad I see the great natural industries in a healthy condition, I know the magnificent nerve the people of this country have always shown and that discipline as has been said, has its boon as well as its bane Our great dramatist says Sweet are the uses road very ty AY which like a town ugly and a venomous Wears yet a precious jewel in his head So this experience I take it, will have its beneficent side It will be each us not to make haste in the lazar house manner we have done under the guidance of my hon friend the member for the Eastern Suburbs borrowing three or four millions a year to the menace of the permanent safety of the country there is a limit to the amount of money which this country can healthily assimilate and to go beyond which leads to excess to an undue inflation of values and to extravagance (Ministerial cheers) We are face to face with a political crisis but that is small as compared with the present national crisis If you are going to replace us I do not envy you your trial I shall be found quite as generous seated on that side of the house as I admit the members of the Opposition have been admit they have not exceeded their rights in this debate I tell them we have the honour and reputation of the country to safeguard and it their polls will protect it better than ours I wish it well The milk is spilled Our duty now is to set the bucket again upon its legs and see that no more is wasted (Ministerial cheers and continued cries of " Divide ) Sir BRYAN O LOGHLEN-Some members sir, are anxious to allow the very eloquent speech of the Premier to go without a word of observation but I wish to draw the attention of the House to this, that he has very cleverly and adroitly) drawn away the attention of members from the question at issue That question is whether the proposals in this Budget are satisfactory to the house I say they are not (Opposition cheers ) Mr. M WILLIAMS -We will make them so (Derisive laughter ) Sir BRYAN CLOGHEEN The Premier began his speech by rousing the feelings of the House by invective against the side pendent section of the House, he aroused feeling again by invective against the gentlemen on the Opposition side, going into ancient history of which hon. members are sick The country is sick of the old fight raised here when Mr Munro was Treasurer, when he proved to his own satisfaction the enormous deficit and the wrongdoing of the previous Treasurer We are sick of that cr) , it is out of date The Premier has directed invective against the independent members of the House which I say) was most uncalled for, because the men who placed him there were the independent members (Opposition cheers ) is he alone a Liberal The members of the old Liberal party), who have been in this House for years, know that the Premier, although a very respected member of the House, cannot pose as a representative of that part) Was it not the great Mr Munro-(laughter) who founded the party to which the Premier belongs, who, having seized, by the permission of his part) the reins of power and had a free hand in forming a Ministry), formed one distasteful to that part) and ignored the very men who placed him and the present Premier on those benches There are members sitting there as Ministers who have been the warmest supporters of the Ministry headed by the present leader of the Opposition They had a perfect right to change their poll took opinions conscientious!) and to sit on those benches-I do not blame them for being there, but I object to the Premier now accusing the independent members of a want of loyalty, the men who have supported him since he appointed himself Premier - (Opposition cheers, and laughter) who have given the Government their triumph, and only now oppose them because after a fair trial they are not equal to the occasion No one doubts the 1 renner s gifts and his eloquence but as regards this particular occasion, in which the whole interests of the country are at stake the Government have made a failure The) have filled to grasp the situation And how is ive the) failed Noonan) of the grounds which have been referred to by the Premier-not on the score of the ol history he went through so readily, rousing the spirit of his back era so we army It is not on this ground that he has failed it is nothing connected with that it is simply that the Government have put no policy before the country no policy to take this country out of the existing depression The) have simply proposed means to make both ends meet and the rest is chaos We are to remain where we are the country is not to be developed Some observations of the Premier were to the effect that if we go beyond an expenditure of one million a year which can be got out of the revenue it will bring on financial disaster I have pointed out to the House the absolute necessity before every) thing of this country following up the policy of public works and the expansion of country railway s in order that the resources of the colony should be better developed in order that ever northland willing to work should have an opportunity of obtaining work at a fair days wage for a few days labour Mr IRLNYUTH-'nho is to pay the piper Sir BRYAN LOGIILrN -V he has paid the paper up to the present moment but this colony as a whole and the people in it an I what have they gained by paying the piper ' I pointed out the other night that those who hold property forever) million pounds spent upon railways have had the value of their property Increased by four millions £34 000 000 has been spent on railways and the value of property has therefore been increased by £130,000 000 (Hear hear) That shows the advantage of going on with public works and railways in this country Members of the House know, finally and shortly put that the question before us in this vote is whether the House is going to accept a Budget that has no progressive policy) in it, which leaves us just as we are We know that during the last few years there has been an enormous shrinkage of values During the last two or three years landed property has shrunk 60 or 70 millions and other property in the market has fallen some 100 millions more A great portion of that shrinkage was brought about by the inaction and want of spirit of the Munro Government. in this House over and over again I impressed upon them the necessity of going on with public work of but we heard on more than one occasion beasts from Ministers that they had cut down public works and public expenditure 1 his present Ministry is simply following out the policy of the past Ministry they have been one of the factors of tin shrinkage and they have caused a withdrawal of conn dence by their want of action-b) their absolute repose They have not come to the material assistance of the country and that is the main defect of their budget there is no progressive policy in it no development We are left where we were and if the Government remained in office for six or twelve months more I don't know the depths we might reach the only probability) is that to their proposed in activ it) we shall drop lower and lower and have further shrinkage whereas who wants policy going in the opposite direction I say this House is not to be led astray) by having false issues drawn across the trail by the treasurer but it is to look at the real question before it and that is whether the Budget as a whole is satisfactory or unsatisfactory Mr A 1 CARTER was sorry he could not compliment the Premier on on extant tion of his usual chivalrous feeling He was sorry that hon. gentleman had felt it necessary to be so v vindictive e and so v Rupert five in the lecture he addressed so plain!) and BO pointedly to some hon members One part of the in element could not refer to him (Mr Carter) because the Premier might have known from his criticisms of the Budget what would be his attitude upon it The Pn mier had suggested that the opposition to his Gov- eminent arose from office seekers, and he understood the Premier to believe that that was what caused what he called sitting Mr MALONEY -I believe there is a good deal in that Mr W I* CARTER did not think the belief of the member for Melbourne West mattered much, or was likely to affect facts He (Mr Carter) had never been an office seeker, nor had he thought the Premier had passed him over, and therefore he had no feelings of revenge on that score No inducements had been held out to him on the present occasion, nor had any suggestion of office been made to burn 'the Premier had made a threat, and he wanted to know what that threat meant The Premier said that in time of peace a deserter was simply driven out of the regiment but in time of war he was shot It was impossible for the Premier to advance the claims of party upon his allegiance, and he wanted to know what the Premier meant Mr SHIELS -lou avowed to me personal political allegiance yourself (Hear, hear.) Mr. W J CARTER -The policy of the Premier in the House since then had caused him to retract the allegiance, which he had a right to do if he was to be shot at now he was ready to stand up to it and willing to expose himself to the vindictive revenge of the Premier, for he dared to be true to his convictions He charged the Premier with class legislation the Premier had shown he was determined to seek for vengeance on one class of the public servants-the railway class because they did not rise at his command and side with him in his determination to deal in a certain way with a gentleman who was at their head Because the railway servants showed their appreciation of the qualities they knew that gentleman possessed the Premier had plainly showed that the Government were determined to deal with them in a special manner, and lay the burden of their revenge on the men's shoulders the Government had acted in a partial and unjust manner in their policy of retrenchment and he had a right to show his utter and complete disapproval of their policy and to cross the floor of the House and say then Budget was unsatisfactory As to the higher protective duties he was one of the members who met to prepare a list of increases for the consideration of the Government 'the Premier stated at the outset that no general revision of the tariff was dreamt of, but the Government had proved too weak to maintain that attitude, and it had yielded to the demands for in creases in all directions Mr ANDREWS- They were your recommendations You were a member of the committee Mr W 1 CAR 11 II-That was not true He was not a member of the committee, and had only visited it once Mr ANDREWS With recommendations Mr W I CA RE Libel nose recent inundations would have been well enough if the Government had been strong enough to stop there The retrenchment proposals of the Government had inflicted more injury than they had done good Mr V WILLIAMS That is not the indict- ment. It is the heavy protective duties (Ministerial cheers and laughter ) Mr. M T C UtTER felt he was at liberty to oppose the Government on an) ground he pleased He spoke as an independent mern er Mr ANDREWS -Ver) independent Mr W T CARTER At any rate he was quite as independent as the member who interjected He would be ashamed to interject about independence if he were in the position which that hon. member occupied in the House. The retrenchment proposals had inflicted injury on the community, and were part of the policy that was ruining the country the Government proposed to stop works and to add to the number of the unemployed What was wanted at the present time was a bold and fearless policy of development assisted by careful borrowing Because of their lack of policy, because of the vindictive and partial nature of their proposals he was prepared to meet the Premiers or) of revenge with another cry of revenge, and to vote against the Government.

Mr D] AKIN supposed that the result of of the division implied that the committee was determined to settle the question that night (Cheers) The Premiers brilliant reply) might apply to a great number, but by no means to all members, either on one side or the other of the House He regarded the Budget proposals of the Government as unsatisfactory, because he did not believe they would meet the deficit, and the retrenchment being in the greater part to a single year was to his mind partial and unjust He would have preferred proposals for a permanent reduction of the cost of the civil service the proposed alteration of the probate duty) and the tax on absentees would in his opinion produce practically no benefit to the Treasury and the extension of the Stamp Act might be direct taxation, but it was not fair taxation. The protection proposals were partial and showed grave omissions, while the increased duties proposed would do serious injury) to other protected industries which were offered no increase This Government and the late Munro Government might have challenged the House on the question of direct taxation and it the Government had been true to its principles a large majority of the House and the country would have supported them Mr TuTNWrrn -A large majority of the House supports them now Mr D] UvIV had been in a majority and sorry for it (Laughter) having entered their protest by their votes they ought to give the Ministry) every assistance and the division would clear the air and enable them to get to business there would next year be a Budget us searching or more searching than the present one, which would then have proved to have failed Amendments would most assuredly!) be carried by the committee and that would disarrange the Treasurers estimates The result of a struggle for partial retrenchment, partial amendments, and partial taxation could only be urination factory, and they would be faced next went b> direct taxation which they had not the courage to face now the course which had been taken tonight for reasons of expediency was one that so far from enabling the House to carry out the intention of putting the finances in order would leave them in disorder and, perhaps in greater disorder than ever (Cries of Divide, divide ) Mr M IN JA RE said hon. members seemed to look on the 1st division as a defeat of the amendment (Laughter) No division had yet been taken on the main question and at least ten members who voted with the Go- v eminent did so because they objected to this early adjournment (I laughter ) hon. members would admit that the members in the Government Corner received ample at tention at the hands of the Premier When the House met this session he asked the Premier to carry out the important part of his programme the increase of the stock tax but objection was raised as the Government wanted to keep the stock tax as a stalking horse for their own purposes If the debate on the railway question had been gone on with the stock tax would not have been touched jet On the public platform he said the programme submitted by the treasurer at Casterton was one that he could support M as there one member who could go before the country and advocate the extraordinary policy) submitted now He would notdarctodoit lins Housewasre turned on the statement that direct taxation was to be imposed and the Premier at Casterton said Y e consider direct taxation a necessity and a matter of justice Direct taxation was the principal element in the speech and that was why he supporters the Government The Premier at Casterton proposed an income tax, and had stated that the Government did not care a straw whether it was unpopular or not but as soon as it found that such a tax was unpopular the I reasurer kept it out of the Budget proposal" Mr BAKER (who rose amid cries of "Divide ) said that the Government should have stated before this what proposals it intended to adhere to He objected to the increased duties because the farmers would have to pay more for their clothing and mi elements The farmers in his district would willingly give up the stock tax if they got intercolonial free trade It was promised in the Casterton speech that there was to be a progressive policy, but what was being proposed in the direction of progress ' In the mallee country the people were pining for railways and there were hundreds of settlers who were actually prevented from cultivating their land Mr M'LEAN -A great many have put in crops without permission Mr T TURNER - They have taken 'French leave Mr BAKER-While poor farmers had been denied permission to cultivate, Mr Lascelles had been allowed to cultivate 100,000 acres At only other period such conduct on the part of a Government would in itself be sufficient to cause it to be ousted from office If the representatives of the farmers did not press for alterations of the tariff proposals they would look very blue when they went before their constituents Mr GRAHAM-lou will look very "blue' when the time comes Mr BAKER there could be no doubt that the farmers objected to any further taxation on the articles they consumed Mr GRAHAM -The farmers are perfectly, satisfied with the proposals of the Government Mr BAKER could say, as far as his his trict was concerned, that if he voted for such excessive taxation as was proposed he would not have the ghost of a show of being returned to the House again Mr RICHARDSON wished the motion of the hon. member for Portland had been a little more explicit as it placed members who did not approve of every item in the Budget in a difficult position He disapproved of the reduction in the prospecting vote, of the tendency) shown to destroy the educational system, and of other things but the Government were prepared to modify these proposals he should like very much to give them his support The only personal allegiance he owed was to the treasurer, and he desired to do his best to be loyal to him The Premier s speech however, and the personal, vituperative and offensive language in which he addressed the independent members was worse than anything to which he had ever listened in that House Mr GRAVES-He does not know any better Mr RICHARDSON The Premier had always spoken in that way when sitting in the Opposition corner he delivered a speech against the Trusts hall so violent that it set on edge the teeth of those near him His allegiance however an already said, was due to the 1 treasurer only among the Ministry, and more especially to the country. He has approved of the kind of retrenchment to be carried out and desired that the reforms and economics long pressed for in the locomotive department of the railways and the Post office and Telegraph departments should be pressed on 'the Government now had an assurance of being able to go on with their Budget proposals, and it was to be hoped that these matters would be attended to Mr WILLIAMS had taken exception to several items in the Casterton proposals, and was generously informed by the Government then that they did not wish to bind their following on every item, but would be glad to accept a general support. This he was prepared to give them It must be well known to all hon. members that if everyone who objected to certain items in a Budget were to affirm that the Government pro- posers were unsatisfactory it would be in possible for any Government to ever carry a budget Mr GRAVES intended to support the Government on this motion, for the reason given by Earl Grey in his work on Parliamentary government, namely, that it was a serious step to compel the existing Government to retire w without a reasonable prospect that another better able to conduct the affairs of the country could be formed Mr BOM MAN disapproved of the Government proposals because of their unfair beer ing on the farmers and the miners He was informed by two hon. members that the Gov- eminent had promised not to reduce the prospecting vote or the municipal endowment fair GRAHAM BERRY -It never has been promised Mr SHIELS The Government has made no such promise All the Government did was to say that when the House came to deal with those questions the Government would recognise the constitutional position of the House. Mr. CAMPBELL claimed that he had been quite consistent on the question of free trade His attitude in regard to the stock tax was totally changed immediately the Parliament of New South Wales adopted retaliatory duties On the main question of free trade he was as sound as ever, and it was the Premier himself who had completely changed front on that question since a few years ago He resisted the proposed tariff! as a monstrous addition to the burdens already borne by the natural producers especially farmers and miners He had no desire now to change the protective policy of the country, but he thought they had really come to the parting of the ways and should not go a step further He would not listen to the voice of the charmer Mr GRAHAM-\ ou claimed "The Charmer ' as your leader at the last elect tion Mr CAMPBELL-The hon. member for Nathalia did what no hon. member would have done and went about his (Mr Campbell's) electorate saying things which he knew, or ought to have known, were incorrect Mr M'COLL complained of as to) connect the effort of the Government to close the debate that night. The Premiers speech was a piece of political Billmsgote, and of drawing of the red herring The present Government came in b) fraud and we were not governed by police or b) statesmanship but by juggling and fraud The Premier obtained his present coveted position by a compact made with the present Agent General in the recess The Casterton programme had been radically departed from, and he was misleading the farmers and the people of the country. It had been said that the motion was a free trade motion but no one who knew the member for Port Fairy could think he would assist in bringing about free trade What was wanted was judicious protection, and if the farmer got every thing in the budget and the trades got nothing the farmer would be no more than placed on an equality in the tariff fights of 188 ) the country members were worsted and beaten in every instance If the Government would withdraw these increases he would support them to that extent. The Premier's promise that the poor man would not be touched had not been kept Although the Government called itself a liberal Government it had squandered the lands worse than in) preceding Government and the formers sons and the working men were going about looking for land and could not get it Amongst all classes of the community there was gloom and disaster and if the Government did not set a good example this would continue Mr GORDON said there were great possi- bilities behind this debate as it might lead toachnngeof Government and a change of Government at the present time would lead to confusion and a waste of time that the country did not want He intended to vote for the Government for the reason that he did not think the time was opportune for a change There were many things in the budget of which he did not approve The Customs proposals were highly objectionable For instance the Government had put a duty of 10 per cent on cutler) and the American axe which could not be made in this colony was included in the list of articles described as cutler) He hoped the Government would revise their taxation proposals Mr METHVEN said he did not agree with all the proposals of the Government. A property tax would have been preferable to some of the taxes proposed With regard to the farmers, there was not a single thing they produced that was not protected Mr G DOWNES CARTER And there is not a single thing that they use that is not taxed Mr MET mEN. -The farmers' reapers and binders were taxed, but they lasted for the tune The members representing mining districts had complained about the prospect nig vote being reduced, but so had the muni- cipal subsidy been curtailed The difference, however, was that the prospecting vote was not being utilised to test new ground as was intended when the vote was first proposed the Government had done a great injustice in dismissing so many men from the Railway department and it ought not to reduce any salaries below £200 a year Mr ISAACS pointed out that if the amendment of the hon. member for Portland were carried it would mean the dis placing of the Government That would result in bringing about confusion that should cause hon. members to pause before voting for the amendment The hon. member for Portland had not stated what proposals he would substitute for those of the Government (Hear, hear) In the absence of that it was the duty of hon. members to do the best with what they had before them and to so mould and shape the Government propositions as would make them acceptable to the country None of the Government proposals were favourable to the miners On the contrary the reduction of the prospecting vote was much against their interests He would do his best to have that vote raised to its former amount He protested against the fervid expostulations of the Premier against those hon. members sitting on the Ministerial side of the House who had honestly and independently criticised the proposals of the Government They would have failed in their duty had they not spoken out (Hear, hear) After further debate, the committee divided on the question, ' that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the resolution, with the following result - Noes 32 Majority for the Government 2 The following was the division list - AYES Mr Andrews Mr Graves Mr Shiels \- Army tage Harris Smith Le his Balles - lev ors - Smith 1 \- Beasley - Isaacs - Storey \- Bennett -Kirton -Taverner Sir Graham Berry) -Malone) - Trench with Mr Post - M Lean - Tucker \- Bromley - M I clean - Turner, C \- Burrowes - Vothven - Turner, O J \- Butterly - Murphy - A \- Clark Murray Webb \- Duffy - Outtrim - v Wheeler \- Dunn - Peacock - Wilkins \- D) or E Phillipson W llliuma \- Poster -rawson -Winter \- Gordon - Richardson - Wyllie -. \- Graham - Salmon I once; \- Grattan - Scott NOES Mr Austin Mr Ferguson Mr U Intyro \- Baker - correct - M Kenzie \- Boniato - Gillies Sir It 01 Coghlan \- Cameron - Harper Mr L attention \- Campbell - Hains T S Staughton \- Carter, GD- Highett - Tatchell \- Carter, W T. -Keys Capt Taylor \- Craven - Langdon Mr White \- Davies - Review Sir H J Wrixon \- Deakin - Madden Mr Box \- Dixon - M Coll The original resolution, providing for the excise duty on beer, was agreed to, reported to the House, and agreed to ADJOURNMENT Mr TAVERNER asked whether it was the intention of the Government to adjourn over Thursday to enable country members to attend the municipal elections Mr SHIELS said that, although at this juncture it was very awkward to have an adjournment, the Government could not refuse to fall in with the custom which had hitherto prevailed He would however, ask members to meet again that afternoon The House adjourned at 2 o'clock until this afternoon at half-past I MR HENRY R LAVO states in the Journal of American Folk.
