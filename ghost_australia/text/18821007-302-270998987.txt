THE COMET. Ah eccentric visitor has appeared among us. Where it came from and whither it is going seems a puzzle to even our best astronomers. Tho present is certainly one of the most grandeur which has ever intruded into our celestial circle. We are not going into the question of its beauty nor into ultimate intentions. We leave that to the calculations of those who malco such observations their study and delight. Our intention is simply to note its effects upon our fellow townsmen in particular, and our fellow colonists in general. Now, this uncertain appari tion, like ghosts and other such mysterious spirits, develops itself before daylight. To see it one must rise in the dark morning. Curiosity coaxes people out of their warm beds at an early hour. The usual amount of cloth ing is disregarded, and in fact a largo portion of our population might be seen continually on the verandahs of their houses almost en pitris naturalibus since the advent of this phenomenon. What is the consequence ? Why, colds, coughs, neuralgia, and other such un pleasant complaints. Walk the streets and notice 'for yourselves. Pocket handkerchiefs are in request, and band ages round the head (not the exception, but the rule) ; doctors fully employed, and aches and pains universal. Now if these discomforts are the effects of the comet, all we can say is that the sooner it takes its departure the better for us all. We must admit that we are not ourselves blameless. However, we have paid the penalty of our rashness, and are wiser if not happier creatures. It is asserted that this comet has almost, if not quite, scraped tho sun. Rather an unwise intrusion on such a formidable body. The sun is perfectly able, no doubt, to take its own part ; but if, when taking its own part, it has for a season at all events to neglect its ather duties, we shall to our cost find that comets are not to be considered as welcome callers.
