POETRY. COMING. What cometh to us up the dim arcades Of the unnumbered years7 Bright forms of joy, or pale and ghost-like shades— With smiles or tears V Who are the guests that come with us to dwoll Unbidden and unhailed— Whose faces we must learn to know full well Though now close veiled ? How shall we dress our hearts to meet them 7 How Their future homes prepare 1 Deck our souls' chambers out with bloom and bough, Or leave them bare ? What music times their mystic footsteps' fall 7 home gladsome-measured strain— Or plaintive minor cadence wailing all Of grief and pain 7 Sometimes, in breathless pauses in the strife, We almost think we hear The trailing of their garments, toward our life Sweeping more near. Ob, viewless Fates, what promise do ye bear For us who toil and wait 7 Shall it be star-crowned Hope, or faint Despair, Or Love, or Hate 7 We see ye not; but far beyond ye One We've, trembling, glimpsed before, Who, dark and stern, shall lead us forth alone When life is o'er. Stern, did I say 7 Not so speaks one who knows The tender ways He's trod. Bearing a palm-branch in his hand for those Who trust in God. Lindsay Duncan.
