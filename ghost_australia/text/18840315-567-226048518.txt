He does not denounce all supernatural manifestations off-hand, but admits that amid a mountain of lying and illusion there is a grain of reliable evidence to justify belief in the occurrence as a fact. He endeavours to solve the problem in the suggestion — That if man is double, material, and spiritual, the spirit of a living one, and that M the spiritual wmnmniiiwati/wi would trans form lteelf into a brain action normally transforms itself into a spiritual communica tion, and that so the effect would be the production of a persuasion in the mind of the living man that he actually saw with his eyes, his absent friend.1 Generally, "the mind aits upon its throne with the senses as its ministers ; but sometimes it asserts its essential royalty and supremacy, and com municates with the senses, instead of per mitting the senses to take the initiative." On this presumption the living would see his friend as he imagined him, that is, with the appearance he had in the flesh and with his clothes on, thus disposing at once of the minor bnt real objection that the ghosts of clothes cannot be. The bishop guards him- «elf Pgailint affirming tlii mainfAina 11 through the attitude rather of an earnest inquirer than of a believer in such mani festation.
