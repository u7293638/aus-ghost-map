Mr. Beerbohm Tree. Many years ago, when Mr. Herbert Beerbohm Tree was a clerk, he bolongcd to an amateur dramatic club called the Irrationals, which used to give periodical performances, mostly for charity, at St. George's Hall, London. In tho early part of 1870 "Hamlet" was put up at St. Georgo's Hall by tho Irrationals, when Air. Frank Gates, new noting in Australia, tho son of a London solicitor, enncled tlio part of tho melancholy Dane. Mr. Treo played tho ghost, and Miss Maud Branscombo played Ophelia. A writer in tlio Pall Mall Gazette, speaking of Mr. Beerbohm Tree's " Hamlet," a 11 ntorv nf t.hn ntYivinntnl nnlnr. manager' who was playing tho King iu 'Hamlet.' Ho played the King and died ; but by Bomo misjudgmciit of distance he fell in the process rather lower down tho stage than he intended. Said Hamlet, ' You are dying in iny place, get up higher.' ' I shan't,' said the nctor-maiiagcr, ' I am King hero, and Â£ shall die where I liko.' " " Provincial aetor-iimiiager," indeed ! Why so contemptuous? Tho "provincial" manager was tho great Macready himself. Tho Pall Mall writer quito spoils tho story, which is correctly related by Mrs. Bancroft in "On and Off the Stage " (vol, i. , p. 37G). Tho point of it is that Maeready was playing Hamlet, and had, according to his wont at rehearsals, been bullying tlio actor who wus to play the King. Macroiidy wanted the centre of tha slago for one of his most effective scenes ; but, by way of taking his revenge, tho mummer King " died " just on tho very Bpot the great actor had selected for his final speech before stabbing himself and dying in Hora tio's arms. Ho grunted "Die further up the stage, sir ! What aro you dying hero fur, sir ?" To the uinusument and amaze ment of tho audience tho defunct monarch sat bolt upright, and said, " Look here, Mr. Macready, you had your way at re hearsal this morning, but I'm King to-night, and I shall die where I please."
