AT THE THEATRE. They told the same old stories. They sang1 the same old airs. They sat in ancient costumes On very modern chairs. While paper snow tvas falling They cooked green ears of corn, And ’twasn't fifteen’seconds Between the night and mom. 'Pile same old villain plotted, The same old lover sighed. The same relentless parent His eager suit denied. They wrote in twenty seconds A letter, or a will; They waved in air their glasses, Yet drank them brimming still. The thunder lacked an echo. The moon was pale and weak, And when the ghost was rising, The crank set forth a squeak. Ah.! yes, the same old people, With nothing new to tell; And yet. I must confess it, Too soon the- curtain fell.
