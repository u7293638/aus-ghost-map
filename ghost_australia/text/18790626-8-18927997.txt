Theatricals îu Sydney. BY "O-BSEnvEB." At the Victoria Theatre, Mr. Dampier's engagement has just drawn to a close, which is a pity, as his' performances have been well appreciated. His place has, however, been filled by Lystor's Opera Troupe, who will, I have no doubt, secure crowded houses. On Friday night last, I went to hear Mr. Dampier as Hamlet, and although-it almost amounts to treason I daresay to say so, but I must-I am no ardent admirer of Shakesperian plays, I must confess that I was greatly taken with his rendering of "Hamlet," which is un- doubtedly his masterpiece. Mr. Harwood, as the Ghost, performed his part well ; and although Mrs. Bates was all astray as " Ophelia," the piece was well done, At the Eoyal, Mr. Titheradge has been drawing good audiences, and, asDavid Garrick, is well worth going to see. Ho ÍB well backed up by W~ H. Seagrave as Simon Ingot, J. A. South as Squire Chwey, and Miss Oliver as ; Miss Brown. The piece is followed by some comedietta, which on Saturday night was en- titled " The Son of the Sea.''^ It was well put on the stage, and very amusing. At tlie Queen's, Kelly and LeoU Minstrels are the attraction. They are playing "JIL M. S. Pinafore," and aje being well patronised. Sydney, June 23.
