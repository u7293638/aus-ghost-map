If this bs so, Shakespeare got o& very light, for thfe •wonder is that he was mot gent to gaol. Very soon after this escapade Shakespeare is said to have written a satirioal pasquinade on the main gate of Sit Thomas's park, at' which the knight, who Was alsb M.P. toi the odnnty, was offended that he ordfeted g&me; legal steps to be takfci Against Shakeapetirfe, perhaps ordered his recognisances to be forfeited, and thb consequence was that Shakespeare felt it'Adrisable, to leave Stratford; and tojjondou he rettedtfed in the veAr ififeS, Ming then in his 22nd year, arid his wife (whom he left at Stratford) being 31. In London he seems to have beta compelled to seek for the means of eubsistenoe in the lowlieBt occupation. Having inide abqnaititanoe at Stratford with a party of " strolling play-actors," and having a fondness tor theatrical amuatmonta, he Appears to have Bought out One of his country aotor friends, for he is heard of at TBLA.dk JTBIAM PLAY HODSIS n the capaoity of prompter^ or of call-boy, r candle->nuffer, or a holder of horses for entlemen who rode down to the theatre. he house was a oiroular building, of wood, ith boxes all round the pit, whioh was not oofed in, nor hoarded, the earth or ground orming the only floor.

These he dedioat«d to the Right Honourable Harry Wriothesiy, Earl of Southampton, friend of the Earlof Essex, and an ardent student and lover of literature. It is said that the young Lord Southampton made Shakespeare a present of £1000 as a token of his Admiration of the poemp.

In ld92 the plague broke out in London, and the theatres were closed. It is,supposed by Bome, that Shakespeare took the opportunity to visit Italy, and. ii so, hk may have seen a Shylock qn, the Rialto. There are also many yho think {that Shakes^ peare visited Scotland in 1589, and may alsb have been there $gain in JfiOlj when an Engf lish company were lioensed to play at Edini burgh before the king,, and this company travelled to Aberdeen, and it was conjectured that during tbis dramatio excursion Shakespeare visited the scenes he afterwards describes in his play of Maebcth, Birnam tVood, Dunsinane, and the others. This En^lighcbmpany wis hnderthelekd^i'sh'ibdf Fletcher, on Whom' the 'Corporatldn St Edinburgh 'con' ferr'ed the freedom of the'city. J'letJDher wafe Shakespeare's fellofr'proprietor in the Black Friars and Globe Theatres in Londoh. In 1C03, when Jambs, King of Scotland,'eam'e to the English throne, lie grahted the patent in this same year to Fletcher and Shakespeare to ereot the G-lohe Theatre. Shakespeare was then in his 39ih year, and the royal patroh age granted by Queen Elizabeth t'o tni Black Friars company was readily continued by King James. It will be recollected how v in the Banqno ghost scene ib ilacbetb, Shakespeare, with cour'tie'r-like flattery of King James (who was sitting oh tb« stage looking on and listening), makes Macbeth say that, in the long line of Banquo's issue, he sees one That twofold balls And treble sceptres curry, Shakespeare meant King James the 1st of England. The two balls were the two'globes placed in the king's hand at his con-nation;, and the treble sceptres were the sovereignty of the three kingdoms of England, Ireland, and Scotland. Shakespeare muk^s.-King James the descendant of Bunquo, and James, in return, wrote Shakespeare 8 complimflntary letter on his good aotiug and poetry writing. In 1601, Jobn Shakespeare, the poet's father, died. In 1.G07, Suvanna, his Aret drtUghtor, was married to Dr.. Hall, :the principal physician in Stratford, , In the following year Maty Arden/ the poet's mo.thttr, died. The relations subsisting betw«en Shakespeare and his wife aud family are.not easily nderstood. Absent in London from thenl for many^years, he then seems to hive returned onoe a year for a short visit. As years rolled on these visits became more frequent, being made two or three times a year. In.his route to Warwickshire he passed through the city of Osford and stopped at the Crown Ifin, kept by one Davenant, whose wife was remarkable for her beauty, wit, sod. conversation. topping bo often at the Crown. ^Shakespeare ecame a weloome guest, fur his fame had pread over the kingdom. On ons'oooasion, hen the stage coach conveyed him to his un to take there his ease, he was asked to stand godfather to a young son which blest he innkeeper's paternal, store that week. hakespeare consented, and for l\iB pains as gratefully aqoutad by the slanderous camps of Oxford with being papa as well as odpapa. Fur tbeboy was baptized William, fter. Shakespeare. This boy lived to be he Sir William Davenant of whom the iographers of, Shakespeare speak so much. ut Shakespeare's, plans of life were noiv ooomplished.and he resolved to re tire from the stage. Hid laxt appearance was in his friend Bun JonBon's play of SBJAJTOB. This was mi 1603 or 4, and shortly after he returned permanently to dwell in Stratford, where he resided in his house, New Plaoe, Chnp.>letreet. He, however, Tet.ained his interest in the tvfo'Thlatres in London for some years Jpnger, but the Globs was burned to theghmrid ih ttlti, the thatched roof being set on iire by the sparks from some .fire-woiks. He''passed his timh pleasantly at Stratford attending to his farti, tfn'd visiting the gentlemen in his netghbbiirhdiiil.
