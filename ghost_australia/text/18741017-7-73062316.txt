SANTO, from inhabitants of Xananda to the ??me effect. '? By the Hon. R. A. TABLTON, from the Good Templars, praying the Home to cause' a kw to be introduced absolutely prohibiting the importation, manufacture, and sale of intoxi cating tiquon within the province. (Laughter). APPROPRIATION BILL. Bead a third time and passed. CITY OF ADELAIDE IMPROVEMENT IBUL. The Hon. B, Al TARLTON moved the seoond reading. The Corporation asked power to enable them to continue King Wflliam.street from the Post-Office to the Bupreme Court, the street to be the same width right through. Their scheme involved the purchase of land on the east and west sides of the Square, aad shifting the Square to the west' There had been some objection to the scheme by ?one persons, who thought it was a covert de sign to bring locomotives further teto the city, buNie was assured by the Mayor that there was no such design ou the part of the Corpora tion. One clause provided that the railway ahould not come further than it does new with out the consent of the dtfeens. Personally, he should|beglad to see the train come further through the city. The BUI asked power for the Corporation to purchase land east and west of ths Square. . He was aware some hon. members were opposed to that scheme. (Cheers.) If they were tight he had no desire to do anything to ineonvenianae the tittsenf, or mar the beauty of the city, of which they ware all so proud— (cheers)— but lie hoped hen? members would give oarVful consideration to both aides of the question. (Bear, hear.) He ooasoientiotuly believed the scheme would, if carried out, be a convenience to the citizens, and add to the beauty of the city. It would make King William-street the finest street in the Southern. Hemisphere, and visitors generally saidit was a pity such a fine street should be cot In two by a squire. Fins bury-square, in London? -was on one aide ef the street, aad did that detract from the beauty of that part of London. Bound King William street there we*) foldings which were a dia ' ngurement to the city. Grant the ooneession naked for, and they would have fine buildings there. He should be glad to see thePadiainehtlZomset, instead©* being in the hollow in which they now we placed, in a site worthy of the Parliament satd worthy of the tity. Th» Sandwich Islanders of~Honolttlu had a better site for thmr -arUament Houses the* wo had. It was dsdoU*. too, to bring ail '.Government offices near together. Thfe was oeing done in London. Were the scheme carried .out, King William street would be feiriy entitled to rank with PtfafteVstreet, InBffinburgh,or the Boulevards, InPaidv KTe had not got a street to oompare with these of Portland, in Oregon, ? much smaller ofty than this, but which was planted with trees, sad at nkhtbriQisntir {nominated with lamps. ^ The Hon.

The estimated oost, according to Mr. Worsnop, was £20,00% and some £7,000 had to be added for buildings. Another state, ment of the cost of the scheme was £40,000, and he defied any one to show that from £45,000 to £50,000 was too large an estimate. He did notice that a camber of their public men wereinterestedinhavingthatroad through the Bqnare, but they had no right to do such an injustice to the citizens, who could not be benefited by the scheme. If it wassuoh a good thing the Government should have had theoonrage to introduce the soheme. He had land in Orenf ell-street that through the fenetOK of HindmaMh.square was worthless than 25 yean ago ; but had he on that account any right to demand that that square should be thrown opt-n ? The Government were not to be trusted in matters of that sett. The calculations respecting the Town Hall had been thoroughly fallacious. If the Square were to be put aside it would interfere with the beauty and fair proportions of the city, to please some interested persons, and same who had no taste for the beautiful, but delighted only in bricks and mortar, stone and stucco. Wai it necessary to carry the business in that direction? He said no business men as a rule would establish themselves along side of Churches and Oourt Houses. Would the Parliament say it was desirable to place Parliament Houses in crowded tho roughfares? Why, even a flock of sheep dis turbed the Assembly. There was abundance of land on North-terrsoe suitable for Parlia ment Houses. He objected to the Bill be* coming law, but he was not much afraid that if it did it would be operative. The Han. t£r H. ATER8 moved that the de bate be adjourned till Tuesday next. The Hon. W. MORGAN seconded. Carried. ' The House adjourned at 3.36 till next Tues day.
