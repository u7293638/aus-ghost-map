The Reviewer. "The Epic of Hades." IN the parts now published, the author of "Songs of Two Worlds" adds to that "Epic of Hades" which we noticed last year, two fresh parts: one depicting the pains of Tartarus and one'^he perfect life of Olympus, between whioh the poem published last year will take its place as the picture of the middle; state of the great — world of spirits. The writer's leading idea, how> evarvilo6* not admit of any parallel conception to Dante's "Inferno," v Purgatorio," and " Para diso," for the chief object of the present author is to represent Tartarus and Hades as both of . them purgatorial regions, in which pain cleanses from the stain of evil, though the process in relation to the deeper stains of sin is of age- long duration. Thus Tantalus himself is made to ■: Ah I fool, to dream ■ Xhat the long stain of time might fade and merge In one poor chrism of blood.

Tartarus, therefore, is only the state in which I-, th» darkness is far greater than the light, Hades '• ttafc in which the light begins to overpower the gloom, and Olympus that in which the celestial Oftht is undimmed, though its forms are still finite.

That is a fine picture of the true Tartarus,—the true hell, which is so much a law unto itself that it resists the very offer of redemption as if it were so outrage. And it is, perhaps, a fault in so completely new a recast of Greek fable that she pott, whose purpose it evidently is to shade off Tartarus into Hades, and Hades into the finite glories of Olympus, and then to connect the limited perfections of the gods—the human Ideals—with the infinite source of all perfection— doss not even attempt to deal with this most dif ficult of all the links in the ascending scale,—the link which connects the glory in evil, the love of ' * "Books L and lIL of the Spie of Hadas>—" L Tar tsraaad theOiympo*."

The true mystery of evil appears to be in the rapidly diminishing power to live, or even desire to live, without it, —the contraction of the life and heart to limits within which good is impos sible. The Greeks appear to have perceived this vividly. And our poet, in the attempt to spiritu* alise their unseen world, should have at least at> tempted to deal with this critical feature in their moral conception of it We note it, too, as to some exteiit a departure from the author's method, as illustrated in the other parts of his poem, that in his " Tartarus " he appears to go deeper into the gloom in passing from Tantalus, and Phadra, and Sisyphus, with their gleams of penitence and aspiration, to Clytemnestra, with her deadly rage against the gods, and her firm resolve never to repent her sin, though both in his " Hades " and his " Olympus " he carries us steadily upwards towards the light We confess that we felt some fear lest in the more diffloult attempt to spiritualise Olympus our author should spoil a poem which, in its other parts, is so full of beauty. But our fear was needless. Perhaps in the studies of Artemis and Aphrodite there is some justification for it There is certainly less of characteristic beauty in these two pictures than in any other parts of his work. But in the treatment of Athene, Here, Apollo, and Zeus, he more than makes up for his temporary falling*of£ Indeed, there is some thing of higher power than anything he has else* where given us in the picture of Zeus as the infinite and invisible author and fountain of aU the more finite virtues :— Then when my life revived again, I said Whispering, " But Zeus I hw not, tho prime Source And Sin of all the gods."

On the whole, we believe that this spiritualised study of the Greek unseen world wiU live as a poem of permanent power and charm, though some portions of the Greek myths have certainly foiled our author by their unmanageable earthli* ness, while to other portions, again, especially those which image the mystery of evil, he has hardly given their full depth. But when the poem is read as a whole, with the part first pub lished relegated to its right place between those which have just appeared, it wOl, we think, receive high appreciation from all—not a very few, in any generation—who can enter into its meaning, for its graphic and liquid pictures of external beauty, the depth and truth of its pur* gatorial ideas, and the ardor, tenderness, and ex* saltation of its spiritual life.— Spectator. Whist Platdco.—An article in a recent number of Macmillan't Magazine on "Whiat and whist playing" containa the following :— "The wonderful thing in whiat ia this,—that ignorance of any of those intricate ralea by which the game ia governed ia regarded aa aq disgraceful that nobody will admit it; nor will anyone allow that he is wanting in that perfect and prolonged practice without which no proficient in any art can bring his ralea1 to bear at the moment in which they are wanted: and yet players generally would be ashamed to hare it supposed that they had devoted to a mere game of cards so great a proportion of their intellect and their time aa to have mastered these rules, and to have familiarised themselres with the practice. Who would not be ashamed to be known aa a first-class billiard-player, and to confem an intimacy so close with pockets, chalk, and ivory balls as to hare left himself time for no more worthy pursuit ? For to play billiards aa billiards can be played requires the energy df a life. Here and there a man has the leisure and the intellect, and in the absence of a higher ambition he derotea his life to elucidate a game. We admire his ingennity, but we do not think very much of his career. But in whist it seems to be implied that if a man does not know and practise all the rules which hare ever been invented, he ought to be ashamed of himself !" Hafphoss is to be gathered in grains, and enjoyed every day. It will not keep, it cannot be accumulated, nor need we go out of ourselves nor into remote places to gather it, since it ia rained down at our very doors, or raster within them.
