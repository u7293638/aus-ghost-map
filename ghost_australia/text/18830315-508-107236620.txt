'You are, sir,* as hurriedly answered the ! young officer in producing the key. * But I much ? ? fear there is serious cause for. alarm,' he con ? tinned. * I made my way hither by first subduing a man in the act of seeking the secret stairs.

As he proceeded th« recluse's face grow paler and paler, and Nina stood, colourless and speech less, in a fear far too terrible for words. As he ceased, the recluse put a quick bub al most inaudible question. * The chamber doors — wera they left open f* he asked. * The man closed them ; and, after getting him on tho stairs, I accidentally touched the secret spring of the trap-door and closed that also.' *The depth and intensity of the recluse's relief were expressed in oae prolonged, struggling in spiration. To that inspiration he added five words. ' Then Rudolph has outwitted you !' he asked. . ? Speaking those words, he turned hastily into the passage again. A quick ejaculation from Norman Devereux ? answered him as anxiously as emphatically. * Impossible,' cried the young officer. * We will see/ half smiled the recluse. Still unconvinced, Norman Devereux tenderly bade Nina remain where she was, and then hurried after him. . ? for an instant the. girl stood listening to their r receding steps; Tfetfext, impelled by a fear and anxiety that would not be restrained, she. noise lessly followed them.
