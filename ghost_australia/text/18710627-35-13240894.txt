There is as another thing, too as I didn't like it Slobbs's, only it wash it a thing, it was a great ugly customer as always sat on me-mcttvpho-icallj, of course, I mean, for how as allus mocking like of my humble ways, and if ever I ordered my gloss of anything, he d roar instanter for the waiter, and call for a bottle. He made himself very unpleasant to me, he did, and snubbed moon politics more than a few, but I let it all wait. I saved it up, as you may suppose, thinking how much I should like to have it out with him, but I never seemed to get no chance till about a week after Slobbses came out strong with a new set of J ruddick s Alabama I caterer Plate, warranted to wear better than solid silver Them spoons and forks just did shine so as it seemed a pity to put 'em in the soup, or get 't m greasy, for you could see your face in em, so as you never got tired of seeing the expression of your features But even the sight of' them spoons ride t settle me, and I wasn t going to be tempted into stopping when Hunt's had their doors open to have me, all Uti re was gravy and western lines citizen as allus set on me was washed in with the name of Sume Shimei B Parsons was his total and his people made some cuts of a mistake or another over his name, I bet, or else they 'd never he' took to this one. We got tothechmav at last, we did, and I left without a word, after serving 'em both out pleasant Like It was like this Ida bit of the toughest old Btrnk I ever did stick teeth in since I clawed caoutchouc at school, and got gathered for it, and after I'd been puzzling my teeth with that bit 'of steak for half on hour, who should come in but Shima, and the first thing he does is to hang his greatcoat over the road where I was sitting, knock down ray felt hot, and then laugh, ileenng-likc, at me I never saw nothing, but that there was tougher than the stock, and I could t swallow it a bit but there I sits with that coat touching of me and the waiter half grinning at me to see me so uncomfortable ' I reckon I 'd like to chew the couple on j cr up,' I thinks to myself and then, somehow, while I was rebalancing' one of Puddick's Alabama 'Lectcror Plate Spoons on my finger, I let it slip into one of' my friend opposite s coat-pocket, when, thinking as the poor thing might be cold all alone there by itself, I slips in another to keep it company 'I should ' wonder if that there coat was to hang lop-sided after that, thinks I to myself, and while my neighbour was in running his eye down the columns of the JI lost Parana Taboon, I lust slips a couple of weeks into the other pocket, and then waits a little while till my from the after condescends to take the bull, after a spell I waits a bit longer for decency sake, and then I gets up togo I finds me from' the waiter just outside the swing doors, looking at me you sooppreiljnis like and I says to him, " Nice sorter sent that in box. No 7 " Vcrj," he says shortly "Very true," I MISS " There's a nice set of J Puddick's Alabama 'Lecturer Plate, too ' "Yes," he says, looking at me quite cares, as much as to say " What up the tree now " "Shall you charge the forks and spoons in his bill I says " Charge what Yorkshire spoons in whose bills" he says, savage like '. Oh, I don't know don't ask me," I says, " only thought he might pay for them as is in his pocket " I know ed what he'd do as well as could be, and I stopped outside that swing glass door, peeping and listening First thing my from the waiter does is to swing his hand by, accident up against the coat pocket, and then I see him jump, when he goes straight up to the owner of that there coat, and he says quite fierce and loud, so as everybody began to look "This, won I do, you sir'" " What won't do " say s the other "This, ' says the waiter, and he puts his, hand in his pocket on one side of the coat and brings out two J Puddiclt s Then he does the sun on the other side, and says all four on the table , when, without a word, the heart leaps up, throws out one of his arms sudden, as if he wanted to get rid of it, and the waiter being light in the way, it hit him on his nose, and down he went but only to come up n gain like so much may rubber, when at it he goes, and catches mother seen wherever he could hit and for about five minutes, they were at it h nil, till them as looked on thought it time to pull em are in from one another, for tear there shoulder the no winter left, nor no reg Hr customer for him to wait on and then I came away You see that was doing it fillcrsophickly I w used to Kirrup the time for stopping mv gravy, and giving me worse instead and I wanted to Harrup my star friends for sitting on me , and I reckon I did it butiful, without so much is taking a bit of skin off my knuckles But I am t, as I said fore, been to Slobbs s since -Lhnmbrrt Mu BriiN'L OsiioiiM s Svrntr.-Iho v Laity observes Mr Bernal Osborne delights above all things to plant his sting in any young man of ability, and he seized the opportunity when Sir Charles Dilke was irresolute enough to expre s his wish to with draw his motion feeble step, for it was not the sort of motion, if brought forward at all, that ought to have been that no rate be very bitter on him He accidentally killed him the ' honorable gentleman, in order to be able to add, with a sneer, "baronet, I beg his pardon, and described him, not untruly, as resembling the month now expiring, in " coming in like a lion and going out like a lamb' He was sarcastic on the "young men aspiring members for the Metropolitan boroughs, and dwelt on the ignominy of the honorable members in being compelled, after the expression of such line and patriotic sentiments, to "put their tails between their legs ' As the till took with the House, Mr Osborne was induced to dwell on it, and reproduce it in another form the honourable gentleman ought to have gone into the lobby with whatever tail he could carry with him, and the House was again delighted with that very exhilarating joke Sir Henry Ho are, the other member for Chelsea, scolded Mr Osborne, but scolding Mr Osborne is not a profitable occupation in any way It gratifies him, for it is a sign his sting is felt, which, in this case, it ought hardly to have been, though the sting does sometimes lie in the tail Mr Hylands amendment praising the Government was withdrawn, and Sir Charles Dilke s negatived without a division A GHOST IN A TEA -The gentlemen passengers have been getting up a plan which was performed yesterday, and succeeded admirably It was a burlesque on " Hamlet, and as it was played onthe lower deck, and the ghost could not by any means be made to rise, it was decided that he should descend through the hatchway So he did, but unfortunately the tackle used for the purpose was not quite long enough, so the unlucky ghost remained sus- pended his feet not quite touching the ground, and his weight causing him to turn slowly round and round the doctor, who performed this part, was, new scatheless, quite equal to the occasion, maintained a most imperturbable countenance, and delivered his speech without so much as moving a muscle, unheeding alike the awkwardness of the position and the roars laughter which it ewuted.-Varieties of Viceregal Ufe,
