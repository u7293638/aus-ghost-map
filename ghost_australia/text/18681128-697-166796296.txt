THE RUINED HOUSE. The house that wo have builded Upon the shifting sands, B ov desolate, how gloomy, How lonely now it stands ! To (hose who passing SCO it, . Dilapidated there, 'What ib it but a ruin, Deserted, cold, and bare ? But lurid in the darkness, With phosphorescent glow ; For us from every window Look dismal shapes of woo. For ub in ov'ry chamber, Lurks horror undefined, And eounde of hollow groaning Fill every gtut of of wind. Fale shades of what we purposed, Stretch forth to us their hands : The ghosts of deeds forgotten Clank still their iron bands. In dork unheeded camera, Where rank the nettles grow, Lie hid those murdered corpses Wo buried long ago. The wells that we have digged In tbe old vanished timer Ail loathaomo things inhabit, Deep grovelling in the Blime. And ghastly, struggling creatures, W c vainly Btrovo to kill, Beneath the stones we gathered, Are writhing, wrestling, still. The storehouses wo garnered Hold emptiness within, And mouldering chests and closets, The chronicles of of sin. Oh, well, if fondly clasping Those walls so fail and grey, Still grows the loving ivy That shrinks not from decay. Oh, well, if yet rcmaineth. Among those ruins lone, Some consecrated chapel On euro foundation-stone. Oh, well, if o'er the pavement Amid the worthless dross, The struggling sun still traoes Faint shadows of the Cross. ? M.
