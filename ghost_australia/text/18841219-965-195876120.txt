And now look below yon to your right:; do yoa.see the low hoase wid the trees a'most a-top of it, and Boban Oreek creeping along by it likeathreadof silver in the grass ?

Do yon \- Me -the big dead -tree stioking white like a -skeleton, out of the dope behind the house ? Tbeclaims were not twenty yards from that." Wdl, now Tady, just tell me the story of the St. Herrick'fl on the spot while I smoke a pipe.

Whatwiteassee have you at Marranga?" "J[ was just wonderin'," Tady -returned, SlODgUifully. "If he's here yet, there's a genitenan lives in one of them white houses beyant the bridge that can tell you the story as wellas l can, an' bedad, he may tell it, for i^on't never again. I'm tired of being misbeflieveSand misdoubted." "If I thought you were in earnest, Fd go •taughtljack to Odrbally again," the young man replied, laughingly, as he put a match to' his pipe jind began to Bmoke enjoyably," but I know that you oannot wish for a greater prooi of my confidepoe in you than .that I chould have lollowed you half round the world to see Marranga and the lost claim." -"JEhftPstaie, sue, bnt all the same I'd like ^ Mr, Po'Hard io teQ you about it, if he's to the :" fore, but twelve ye&rs; is a long time."

Herrick's was mama's home once, and -we heard some gentleman had rented it. I did so hope it would be some one nice." The last sentence was repeated thoughtfully, as her eyes wandered down to the low house among the trees that Tady had pointed out as St. Herridk'e. " Stay Miss," the Irishman said eagerly, 7 as the girl was turning to go on her way. "Are you a Bt. Herriok ? " " Yes, I amBesignation St. Herriok—the late Colonel St. Herriok was my father." " I thought so," Tady cried, " you have the poor Colonel's eyes as like as two peas." " Mama says so; did you know him ? did you know my dear fatner ? " and the rosy flush spread from the soft cheeks all over the fair faoe. "Yes, Miss, I knew him well. I was here at Marranga I suppose before you were born." " Yes, it must have been. Papa was dead before I was born, that is the reason mama called me Besignation. -Did you love my papa? " " Everyone respected andliked him t" Tady said quickly. " No, not everyone; there was a bad man— you forget—the man-who. killed him." -" Yes, the ctirseo' God on him, I forgot Dan Lyons I" Tady cried angrily. "Hush,'donot speak wrong words. God knows best himself. May I shake hands with you because you know my dead papa ? 11 "God bless the child I" the honest Irishman said, as he clasped the little slender hand that was tendered him. " Yon will shake hands with me, too, as a new friend ? My name is Leonard Prosser," the young gentleman said, putting out his hand also, " and will you' introduce me to your dog? Dogs and. I are always great Iriends." "My dog is oalled Guardian, sir, for he takes care of me, and is a very faithful dog. Are you going to Btay here sir? " " Yes, dear, we think of remaining for some time near Marranga." " I am glad, iNshall see you again. Goodbye now " and the child made a grave bow to Leonard and Tady, and then glided down the path toward St. Herridk's. Isn't that quare now?" the Irishman asked as they stood and watched the light form passing through the underwood that skirted the eminence on which they had been seated, "that we should meet Colonel Herriok's daughter the very first on landing in the place?" ' "It is a strange coincidence, truly. This child was not born then, when you lett Marranga, Tady?" 'No, but one was expected if the mother lived. God helpher, it was a hard trial she had to bear. What do you say to getting down to.the township now, Mr. Leonard? The ooaoh is nearly in, and we'd better be seem' afther our thraps." CHAPTER a. Tmc DESEBTED CLAIMS. A few hours later found Leonard ProsBer and his companion, the little Irishman, seated in Mr. Pollard's office at Marranga, and Tady ubQant over-the fact of that'gentleman geing still a residant of that neighborhood. He had introduced his young master,, and given the J.P. a sketch of his doings during his absence from Australia, and now he - was greedily inquiring as to the events of the last twelve yeara in quiet Marranga. " Ana so yon tell me that a pick has never been struok in them claims since, Mr. Pol lard?" . " Not since our poor friend's exhumation, Tady. None of the claims had paid well, you know, and they were abandonsd after that awful murder. Even you went, Tady." "J wint, yes," the Irishman said aggressively ; " but 'twasn't oh account of the bad .prospect, for we had the best in No. 2, but on account of the place gettin' a bad name—you know that yourself, sir." " Yes, a story of the claim being haunted got abroad, and every shaft was deserted; but as I said before, there was not much temptation—no lead was ever found." " I don't know that," obstinately asserted Tady," I had a fool of a mate, or I believe we were on the right track. An' thin' I got the master's letter callin' me home to look afther Mr. Leonard here." "He means my father," explained the young gentleman. "You must know that Tady and I are foster brothers, and his jaunt out to the diggings was an escapade of which his friends did not approve." . " Well, I'm back again in spite of 'em," said .Tady ; and now, MzJPollard,tell Mr. Leonard the story—no pne knows it better nor -your- Bfcli." ~ "It was> sad'stoiy/'ithe pleasant- looking, middle-aged gentleman went on, as he pushed the- wine toward his new Mend, young Sieonard;" and a great shock to me person was the "death of my friend, Colonel St. Herriok. It is about fifteen yean ago now, I think, since he first settled here with a -wife, as beautiful as an angel, and a son who died shortly after their arrived at Marranga. The colonel had some independent means, and built the house known yet as St. Herridk's on the ground he purchased; but when, some years alter, file gold fever found its waj to Marranga, he was one of the first who sank a shaft and found, as he considered, sufficient indications of the precious metal to induce further eSorte. "Fox. some time, however, he' oould not suoocedjiri inducing anyone to join him, the few residents being occupied in farming, or business of one kind or other, and the place having not yet become known aoffieiently to entourage regular diggers. At last, however, .the Colonel oafne to me one. day in great spirits with the news that he had employed a man who had accidentally called in travelling toward the Murray.. "It was some time, however, before St. JHerrick told me that he had been previously and unfavorably acquainted with Dan Lyons, and when the faots came oat and were made public there were many, who wondered that my friend would have ventured on such a step as permitting- the man to work as his partner, as well asjfecome an inmate of his home. The facts appeared to be that in Ireland, through the evidence of St. Herrick, Dan Lyons had been sentenced to ten years penal servitude for shooting with intent at a land bailiff, whom he was obnoxious to, and that the evidence was never forgiven, the murder of poor St. Herriok was a gfoof." "It was Dan Lyons, then, who committed the foul dead ? " Leonard questioned. " Undoubtedly, though the wretch has escaped and baffled justice. * It was Lyons himself that gave the alarm that No. 1 claitnhad fallen in. You remember that, Tady ? " " Av coorse, I mind it well. There was a regular hullabulleo when he kem to No. 2 sereechin* that, the claim was fell in an' that the Colonel was below. There was only four shafts an' half of 'em deserted, and round about No. 1 was so druv wid drives that we knew 'twas unsafe to stand anear where the great gap of ground fell in. The way 'twas done at laBt was by putting a -drive in from No. 4, an' it took us three days to do it." " Aye," responded Mr. Pollard," three terrible days for the poor widow who would hope to the last, though we all knew th$t the Colonel must have perished for want of air shortly after the ground fell in. Lyons pretended to be one of the. most active workers, but he wasfjn reality retarding the search, and he disappeared from the moment that St. Herrick's corpse was seen with a note-book in one stiffened hand and a "pencil in the other." - " The poor fellow liad left evidence against his murderer ? " "Yes. In the few scrawled words written in darkness and in the oppression of death, he told how Lyons had out away the props and told him of the revenge he had planned— told him of it ere he escaped himself, and while tjhe soil was slowly settling down between nim and his viotim. There was no more but a blessing on hiB wife and Mb unborn babe." «We saw the little girl to-day," Leonard said, and he related what had passed between Resignation and them. " She is a lovely girl," he added," but looks very delioate." "She has grown np with the very shadow of the grave on her," Mr. Pollard returned. " The very name given her was the last that should have been chosen, for her mother has never been and never will be resigned. She nourishes a morbid idea that somehow and some day she will see her husband's murderer brought to juBtioe here on the spot where be died, and the dead father is almost the sole subject of conversation between, her and her little girl." " "Where do they live now ? " Tady asked. " In a little house I had built for them after the Colonel's death. On hiB affairs being settled it was found that there was but a few hundreds left after the house and land was paid off. St. Herricks being put in the market, I bought it myself, and offered to take Mrs. St. Herrick as a tenant, but she declared it would be impossible to remain where she had been so happy, and where everything would remind her of her dead ^husband, so I built the cottage where they now live; it is on the slope above the old place, Tady; you will remember it ?" * " Yes, Bir, welL" "The property has been a loss to me," the good man continued, "for a story of Its being haunted stood in the way of its being occupied. Now, however, I have justEeoured a tenant whose profession oughr to prevent any suoerstitieus terrors from affecting him." "What is he?" " By his dress, I should say a member of some religious order, and his mother calls him " Father James." " He has a family, then ?" "A mother and Bister, and one serving man, as far as I could see. And now about yourselves." You really mean to attack the old ground again, Tady ?" " Wi' the help o' God. I'm as sure as I sit here that there's lumps of gold in that ~ ,Mt. Pollard." Veil I hope there may be, Tor your sake, and Mr. Leonard's too. Where are you going to put up?" At the hotel, for the present, Mr. Pollard," replied Leonard. " I must have a look at these wonderful claims before I decide on entering the life of a digger,- for i -most confess that I don't at all share Tady's certainty of a golden claim." "More shame for you to say it," cried Tady, angrily, as he got up from his seat; " but if you're oomin', we have no time to lose, Mr. Leonard." " We had proposed a visit to the claims," young Prosser explained. " It is not a long walk, I believe." " About half a mile only. Stay, Mr. Prosser; if you have no objection, I will walk with you. It is years since I saw the place, which has, as you may suppose, sad recollections for me." It was. a lovely Bpring afternoon; and as the trio orossed Boban Creek and mounted the slope beyond, it was an almost' simultaneous impulse that slackened their steps to admire the scene around them. The gliding waters of the creek, glistening among its fringes of sweet-scented flowering wattle; the stately Mount Boban, hSaving up his huge sides, laden with their wealth of forest, flushed in the warm, bright sunbeams ; the sweep of fur pasture, dotted for miles with content sheep and cattle, until lost in the low line of blue hills in the distanoe—all formed aB sweet a landscape as Leonard Prosser had ever gazed upon. "It is lovely," he said, "and eo different from what I fanoied. My idea of Tady's diggings was of something wild and rough, and not of a loveliness such as this." "Inten minutes you will see something more like what you expected, Mr. Prosser," observed the J.P. " The gully is even wilder now than when you left it, Tady. The ourse of shed blood seems to be on its very grass." Turning to the right they passed the overgiowri garden that surrounded the dwelling known as " St. Herricks," and then entered a gully wild enough to fulfil all Leonard's dreams. It seemed to be a cleft in the hills down which the dry track of a winter torrent, and up the sloping sides of which straggling trees grew, and wild foliage flourishedrankly. Here and there were broad level spots that had been swept in winters gone by from the green hill sides, and toward one of these level places the steps of Mr. Pollard turned. A spot that looked weird enough to justify all that Mr. Pollard had said of it, where the grass vainly struggled to hide the sunken level and the thrown up heaps that^ denoted the place where they had dug to recover the body of a foully-murdered man. Huge trees without one sign of leafy verdure on them stretched their bare, bleak, crooked limbs over ii as il in warning and gaud,andamongthescarred, hard soil, where no grass would grow, a few treaoherous holes with lichenB waving long tendrils down their cavernous depths, denoted where the deserted shafts of the long ago 1 miners had been. " Is this at all like what you expected, Mr. Leonard?'' the gentleman asked, as he paused on the edge of the sunken level. - J " It is worse," almost whispered the young man, while Tady gazed around him with horror. " I scarcely wonder that men would .be unwilling to work hoe, even for gold; What do you say, Tady ? " 1 1 1 don't know what to say, sir; there's an awful change here sure enough, and they say that a ourse will'always lie where a man has been killed. What happened the trees, Mr. Pollsrd? They were fine box trees twelve years ago." "There was a bush fire that^helped the desolation, I believe, Tady. Can you point out your old claim ? " "For sure, sir. The Colonel's No. 1 was here where the ground's low, and our'swas that one beyant there, where the green thing is swinging about." They advanced to [the edge of Tady's old shaft and looked down into the darkness, Leonard lifted a stone and threw it down, and as it splashed into hidden water the Irishman shuddered as if a oold wind had struck him. "I think your'gold-digging at Marranga' will never be resumed, Tady," young Prosser said.- " There is water down there, and a flooded claim is no joke to taokle. At all events, I resign on the spot all interest in No. 2, it would seem to me like digging in a grave." " The place of graves has not always been respecter in the search for gold in our new land," observed Mr. Pollard, " but let us go; I own I shall be glad to get away from this melancholy spot." " What waa I sent here for at all? " murmered the Irishman discontentedly. "Day an' night I was dreamin' of it for eleven year; wamins of all sorts, I had to come baok again to the ould place; what was it for if 'twas not for the goold ? " " Maybe 'twas to meet the priest, Tady," Leonard said Bmilingly. "Is this your new tenant approaching, Mr. Pollard? I should judge so from his dress." " Yes, it is he," replied Mr. Pollard, as he paused to speak to the clergyman who was approaching. Father James was a man so strange in form and movement, as to draw the eyes of both Leonard and his foster-brother closely upon him; he was tall and gaunt in make, and his long, priest-like blaok boat hung so loosely around him as to suggest a decrease in bulk sinoe it had been made for him. Indeed, the faoe, showing palely under the broad brim of the olerical hat that was drooped 6ver it, was that of an invalid—the white, hollow, close- 'shaved cheeks, the great, sunken dark eyes, with the blue circles round them, suggesting a far from perfect Btate of health. On meeting him Tady, with the usual respect o his countrymen for cheir clergy, made him a respectful reverence, that was acknowledged by a curt nod as the stranger stopped to speak to his landlord. " A strange looking man and a siokly one, I should say," observed Leonard when they had separated by some steps. " He belongs to some foreign order I think—eh, Tady?" "Aye,sir,the dress is different from our clergy? but what eyes he, has—they seemed to look right through me, an' I declare it seems to me as if I'd seem 'em before somewhere." Maybe you did, Tady. There were two or three continental priests at Corbally collecting for some charity last summer." "I was none of them,Mr;Leonard,fori never lost a mass while they were there, an' I seen 'em all." " I don't think you ever lost a mass if you •could help it, Tady. What will you do here ? I understand there is no chapel here." " No I" replied Tady viciously, "it's mostly Protestants that are at Marranga — the hathens; I beg your pardon, Mr. Leonard, I was forgettin' you wor one, but you must own that if there were as many Catholics about, the place wouldn't be without a church or chapel. Well, I'm glad, anyhowt that there is a priest. If he's in orders 'twill be a great comfort to me." They were now rejoined by Mr. Pollard, whose pleasant countenance had a broad smile on it as they moved on, Tady falling, as he always did, a little in the rear. " You have heard something pleasant from our clerical friend ? " said Leonard. " I don't know that it was exactly the agreeable nature of what Father James told me that tiokled me, but it was the idea of Paddy's sensations when he hears it. What do you think the priest told me, Tady ? " "He wouldn't tell you anything bad, Anyhow," the Irishman replied stoutly. "Of oourse not, but something very unexpected. What do you think he is going to do, Mr. Prosser ?" " "I can't guess." " He is going to open up the old ground we have just been inspecting. He is going over to see it sow.- He says that he has a man with him who knows thei ground, and who has a' great opinion of the prospects in No. 1 before it was abandoned, and he's going'to take possession of that elaim. What do you think of that, Teddy?" " I'll tell you what I think 1" oried Connor, triumphantly. "I think that priest pr no priest he won't get No. 2 claim, lor I'll go back and peg it out this minnit! By Jove, we can set all the ghosts in the country at defiance now when there's a clergyman in the ground, an' we'll take plinty ov gold back to ould Oorbally yet afther all, Mr. Leonard 1" CHAPTER in. Leaving his companions snddenly, Tady Connor started back toward the gully they had just left, but long before he reached it he saw the tall, blaok figureof the priest standnear the scattered spot which had been the grave of Colonel St. Herrick, and it seemed to the Irishman that in spite of the presence of that old man, the gloom of the spot was deeper, and the gaunt branches of the dead trees even more threatening of Bspect than they had been a short hour previous; but he oast the fancy from him with an execration on his own folly. \- "I was ever an' always a fool with the superstition, an' I must have sucked it wid me mother's milk, for she was just as bad ! What'ud make the place blaoker because the fathei* is there ? V and he trod toward him with a step that made the dry sticks crack, and the dead grass rustle. The clergyman heard the sounds and turned slowly to meet, as he doubtless expected, the. gentleman he had so lately parted from, but a quick frown shaded the whits face as he drew the broad hat lower over it at sight of Tady Connor. . "Mr. Pollard tould me that ye wor goih to take ,up one of the old claims, your reverenee, and I came hack to tell ye that No. 2 is mine. You see I worked it long ago, and it belongs of right to me, plaze your reverence. " fam not in orders," was the reply, in a deep, hollow voice as if the words were spoken through clenched teetb,."and claim no right as a clergyman. What is that you are saying about these claims ?" " Mr. Pollard ses you're goin 1 to work 'em, sir, an 1 1 am makm' it known to you that No. 2 was my claim long ago." " When ? v asked the man we know as Father James. " Nearly twelve years ago, jour reverence, before that murtherin' villain Dan Lyons killed the Colonel in this claim—may the curse of God rest on him now .,»Mt^Jt ever, amenl" . •.

You are: -ready to face the retribution we are working for at any day and any hour, yet you shudder at a phantom of/your own fancy." ' .' " It isino fancy, Cornelius ; I am ready for.; the living, but not for the dead. Fancy 1 Is that fanoy ? Are these fancy F' and he held out his emaciated^ trembling wrists. "No, but,you are killing yourself by trying to fortify yourself for the imaginary horrors of the night; the spirits you drink would killthe strongest man alive." "It does not kill me, I should die without it.'! "• . . . . He turned toward the house, half hidden by the trees, as he was shaking, and walked toward it, a tall unbending , form that seemed shadowy enough to belong to some other world, yet had hidden beneath the blaok robe all the horrors that the crimes of earth oould concentrate into one deed. The house known as St. Herrick's was-a low-roofed building of small accommodation,' and its dark stone walls were so covered with ivy, that only here and there whore the gleam of small windows made themselves known, oould the material of which it wais built be identified. It-had more than the' 1 gloomy look, too, of a house untenanted for long years, especially at sunset, when the tall cypress- like trees cast their long shadows across the threshold. Standing on the threshold as the brothers approached it, was an indolent-looking young girl of low stature and a heavy build. Every feature in her face was heavy, from the snub nose and the slow, dark eyes, to the, thick fringe of black hair out straight across her lowilat forehead. She had a sulky look, too, as she stood there watching her brothers' approach listlessly, and her ungainly .figure was ^so,bedizened with Boiled/finery, in the shape of iaee and ribbons that the befringed andbefiduneed black dress looked shabbier than even it was under the contrast. " It isn't bad enough to to be in a gaol like this, but we must b& starved waiting for' our Supper, she said, sullenly, as Father James, passed -her, and went inside, but Cornelius only laughed in her faoe as he chucked her; fat, heavily moulded chin. . - " A pretty .girl like you, Nora, wont be in gaol, as you.oall it, long. You'll be having np end of sweethearts about you when the Marranga boys begin toUnd you out." " I don't think there's any boys about," she said, with a pout of her thick lips. " That's where you're wrong, Nora ; there was one asking about you to-day." , "Now you're np to some of your larks, Corney," she said, doubtingly ; hut her eyes sparkled, and her brother sawJt. " Faith I'm not.: Oh, honor bright, Nora, he saw you through the trees, and he's bound to make your acquaintance."; " Who.is he ?" the girl asked eagerly. " His name is.Tady Connor;" " Tady Connor," Bhe repeated thoughtfully; and little guessed Cornelius Brfedy,. as he called himselfwhata bomb Of destruction he had thrown under his own roof when he mentioned the name of Tady Connor to his sister Nora. In the kitchen of St. Herricks/ tfhich, it would seem, was used as a common room by the-Brady family, a smoking supper-was spread upon the table, at which a woman o! soine sixty years was standing when Father James entered^ She was a tall, thin woman,.; with strong hands and wiry arms—the hands, and arms of a woman who had worked hard her life, and was dressed in the homely fashion of an Irish farmer!s wife. Her grey hair was drawn up from her lpw-forehsad under a white muslin cap, her dress was pinned up over a blue woollen pettiboat, and: a checked apron was spread over all the front pf her skirts. A small shawl covered her shoulders, and was crossed on* her breast, ;and if a person had oursorily glanced at.Mrs. iBrady they must have set her down as an active, bustling woman, and a notable housewife. , V (To be continued^
