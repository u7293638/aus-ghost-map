LOCAL AND GENERAL. The meeting of the board of management of the Roma Hospital which should have been held on Monday, last did not come off. At the time ap pointed there were only two members present, and the meeting was adjourned until this (Wednes day) evening at 8 o'clock. Several of the members of the hospital board are also mem bers of the board for the Bangil Division, and as there was a meeting of both boards on Monday one had to be neglected, for oar local men who so readily and good naturedly undertake gratuitous public services cannot be in two places at once— "like a bird." The meeting to-night is, however, an exceedingly important one, and it is hoped as many of the members as can attend will do so, for there is an acting committee to elect and officers of various kinds to appoint. A few days since Mr. Clinton, Inspector of Works, arrived in Roma from Toowoomba on a visit of inspection. If Mr. Clinton possesses any information other than that already made public , relative to the roads department and the disposal , of its officers now that the divisional boards take so much of that work in hand he was particularly reticent on the matter, for no additional information has been obtained, and yet something should be said in reference to the Government taking charge of the. main roads. Mr. Clinton has now gone to St. George to inspect a bridge down that way and report upon its construction. He was accompanied from Roma by Mr. Amess. The monthly sitting of the Licensing Board was held yesterday (Tuesday), the members present being the Police Magistrate and Messrs. Cottell and Carter. A renewal of the license for the Royal Oak Hotel, Roma, was granted to Mr. Thomas Joseph Byrne. An application made by Mr. Henry Gardiner for a transfer of his license from Bungil Creek to the. Wiestern Railway Hotel was post- poned for a fortnight, the house not being quite finished. Yesterday an auctioneer's; district license waa granted to Mr. John Morrissey, of Roma. The ordinary fortnightly meeting of the Roma Municipal Council will be held to-morrow evening, at the Town Hall. There were, nine tenders sent in on Monday, for the construction, of the new pound yards at Roma. That of Mr. John. Robertson, at 35s. per rod and £1 for each gate was accepted. The work will be com menced without delay, and it is believed the yards will be ready for use in the course. of six. weeks or two mouths. On Tueslay 2600 fat sheep belonging to. Mr. Ashburn, .who .owns a station on the other side of Tanibo, but the name of which we could' not learn, passed near Roma; Mr. Smith in charge. The sheep are en route for the Brisbane market tor sale.' At the Police- Court on Saturday^, the Chituuiiaa.

Already several of the Go vernment offices are brought within speaking dis tance of the Parliament Buildings, communication having been, established between the Education De partment and the Colonial Secretary's office on Thursday last. The various instruments will be placed in position in a short time, and a room has been set apart in the new central building in Bris bane for the purpose of working the lines. We hope it will be possible to.extend telephonic com munication to the.country townships. The Courier thus describes the principle upon which a telephone exchange is worked :—The premises of each sub scriber are connected by wire with a central office, and each is provided with a telephone. A sub scriber wishing to communicate with any other per son in connection with the system first calls the clerk at the central station, who is always in at tendance, and this officer, by means of an apparatus known as a "switch board," at once places the two parties in direct communication. The attention of the second person having been attracted by the ringing of a bell in his office, the conversation can be carried on with the greatest ease, and at its close the contact is again broken by the attendant at the central office upon receiving a signal to that effect. . Each set of instruments will cost about £9, and will probably.be purchased from the department by the subscribers, the latter undertaking the entire responsibility in connection therewith, but we understand that the instruments are not at all liable to get out of order unless used in a most care less manner. The charge will be made at so much per quarter-mile of wire, per annum, as each sub scriber must be supplied with an independent wire. A ghost has recently appeared in Bathurst, New South Wales. An enterprising fellow occupied a bnildiug which -was under offer for sale, and in order to depreciate its. value he tried to give it an unenviable' reputation, and . gave it that out was haunted with spirit* For several nightB a figure in a whitosheet was teen inovhig about the grounds,. and tiinidpeople became terrified. This scheme succeeded for a time, until a young man passed the spot late one night when he saw something. The young man wa® alarmed, 'and in bis fright stood motionless in the street, when seeing the. "spirit" moving'towards him he became still more alarmed. He had with him a" faithful' dog, and, calling^ the animal by name, told him to " take to bim." The dog -obeyed his roaster's command and made straight for the "spirit," who, noticing the torn matters had taken, endeavoured to seek shelter in the house; but before he had gone far the dog seized tbe sheet with which he was covered, tean.ng it from top to bottom and exposing to view roe body Of the mM. Irgs and gave the gbwt -soote severe bites.... Tbte. spirit tried to tick tlifi and while doing 'his the young man, who .by this tuno'bad recovered frjm hia fright threw a stone at him that caught, him in the small it the" back.'
