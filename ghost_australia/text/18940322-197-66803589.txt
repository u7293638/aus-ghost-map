WINNING TIHE BRACELET. Iark i That's the bell a-ringing, and they're saddling up with a zest : Anl tile b bolokies' " are puzzling their brains . out, as to which is Maskell's best. Look I There's Luke up on Emeralda; I fancied the dark horse most, Though somne say the mare call beat him, and he hasn't the ch. nee of a ghost. But I think, just half-an-hour back, over there . on the saddling-groundl, When Miarungi's black eyes, peering out,saw that nobody olse tlas aitround, He licked tile old mare on the forehead, in a soft caressing way, And whispcrd a word inl her car there, that none but the witld heard him ay : ' You'll go like a good un, my lady, aun it's oftenl you've done thet same ; You'd fly, while you'd legs beneath you, and I: 'm dashed if I'll spoil your game ; You've ilone great things in your time, too, ansd I'm not going to baulk your play; lMy time is to come hereafter, but the Bracelet is yours to- day." Theit off to tihe post they went pacing, and dowli went the starter's flag, And is the boss" watched them rounding the clearing, with never a shirk or a lag. Right into tlhe straight together, neck and neck, so the people said, But the black horse failed at tile finish, andl tihe mare swept inl ahtead. So '..the gal" at the last won the Bracelet, Sanmd I've just got this to say, As she bore the old hoops to victory, inay she ,, bear. them for manyn day.
