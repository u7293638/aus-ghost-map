QUIPS AND CRANKS.—No. XIX. A BACHELOR'S LAMENT. Once upon a time there lived a young man,' who, strange to say, was born when a mere child, and increased in- age day by day. He was the son of rich but honest parents, and his maternal relative was his only mother.' He was supremely happy; in fact, his very name was R. E. Joyce, or, to use a touching simile, he was as joyous as the girl that killed her grandmother. But in an evil hour this unfortunate youthperpetrated the awful crime of matrimony. He is now on trial, and like Henry III. has never been seen to smile since. But ere his fall he wrote these painful rhymes under a fit of temporary profanity, which shows how the human mind is oft un* true to itself. GOIKG ! -GOING!! GOTO!!! . They're going, the papers reveal it, The friends of my bachelor life, And they care not how hard I may feel it Each ties himself on to a wife. \- I know not the cause, tho' I often Endeavoured the reason to find, But love must their intellect soften And leave'them without any mind. They marry and steadily settle Their necks-to the gall of the yoke, They lose all their fun and their mettle And sigh at the ghost of a joke. They fade from our evening meetings, They join ne'er a lark nor a spree, Grow mild in the style of their greetings, And confess an affection for tea. They are curbed bythe bridle of marriage, And push in a ludicrous way The perambulatorial carriage. With an 'umble attempt to be gay. They're versed in the value of bonnets, And up to the price of a shawl; They never sing laughable sonnets, Lest the baby may wake up and squall. Of punch they ne'er handle a ladle, And only know one sort of " crib," And that is the baby's new cradle (I wonder they don't wear, a bib). Their aspect is always dejected, They never are guilty of chaff, And if you could get them dissected, You'd ne'er find the trace of a laugh. The girls never smile when they meet 'em, Nor turn to look after they're gone. They're married! then why should greet 'em? Their aspect is sadly forlorn. They never get smoking-caps worked 'em, Nor slippers by pretty girls made, For wedlock has, so to say, burked em, And cast them all into the shade. •* * * * * * they The unhappy author here committed the very folly he was deprecating, and now being " finished" himself, never finished the lines.
