THE MYSTERY OF A NAME. A Present-Day Romance. CHAPTER VII. Robert Grange made a point of being one of the first arrivals at Mrs Stone's that 1 evening, partly to save himself the confu- 5 sion of being announced before the entire company, and partly in the hope of being 1 there in time to watch Miss Mary Smith's I entrance. In this he was successful, being, E indeed, the first gentleman to put in an appearance at all, and Mrs Stone, fortu- s nately for him, met him just outside the t drawing-room door, where she greeted him I most effusively, and overwhelmed him with v her gratitude for the honor he was doing a her. Thus he was able to have a few minutes' conversation quite privately with I her, in the course of which he begged her n not to introduce people to him on the strength of his name, and repeated the fact b that he greatly disliked being feted. He n could hardly help smiling at her expression w of gratified importance as she assured him d how flattered she felt at sharing a secret a with him, and she wished that Vansturt could have been with him, not only to join t in tho tomk. ut to. hsit him to e sr it through should any disiaties aria?-e. Many as his adventures had been, he had never met- with one of .this descriptione before. Gradually the rooms filled, and being z occupied in receiving her guests,Mrs Stone quite forgot for the time, the existence of i the illustrious stranger, and to his delight r he was left to his own devices. He stood 1 near the door, leaning against the wall, s and eagerly scanning the face of every girl I who entered the room. Mostly the an- a nouncement of their names was swallowed up in the buzz of talk going on around, r and so many arrived together that some I were never announced at all, so he had t plenty of opportunity of criticising the c young ladies and wondering which in all i that crowd was the one he had comeso far to see. He had not seen Mary's photo. - graph, so had only a vague notion of what r sort of girl to look for, for though Van- a sturt had described her to him as well as a he could, such descriptions are almost a necessarily misleading, so many people in f the world seem to be made after one pat. - tern as far as mere features and com- a plexion go. Thus it happened that Bob c fixed on no fewer than three girls as per fectly possible Miss Smiths. Not that they i were a bit alike, but they were all rather I tall, had good figures, nice complexions, v faces that were neither pretty nor plain, I and they all looked about the age of four and-twenty. The worst of it was that he was not well pleased with any of them, and I decided that one looked sour, another stupid, and the third sly. As he watched d them he felt he had made a mistake, and I began to wonder whatever could have in- p duced him to come on such a foolish t errand. Indeed, it would be hard to ex- d plain what motive had led him to come, I beyond the gratification of an indolent sort a of curiosity on the subject of his name, li and had he had anyone belonging to him s, at home or anything that had needed his n presence there and given him occupation, w he most probably would not have thought I twice about going to look for Mary tI Smith. He was revolving in his mind whether w he should slip out while no -one- noticed m him Aa Ro n b.htoi- hislotel. or should h announced, in tones surely louder tan any he had used before " Miss Smith!" Grange started and looked towards the 1 door. There was no- mistake this time; not only was the name correct, but he ac- t tually seemed to recognise her as the girl d of whom young Harper had spoken so enthusiastically. She looked the sort of t girl one would be enthusiastic about, l though why, it would be hard to say. She was quite alone, but seemed to feel no awk wardness from the fact, though the room f was crowded and many people stopped to s greet her even before she reached her hostess. Her movements were neither un- t duly hurried nor slow enough to suggest c that fine ladylike indifference which seems f to some of us so very like bad manners. She wore the new white dress that Mrs Smith had so wished her to wear at the Rectory dinner-party a month or two be fore; the fact, though uninteresting in it self, is worthy of notice because it gave the whole company something to talk about for the next ten minutes or so; some of the ladies ridiculing it because it 1 was so very plain, and most of the gentle men admiring it for its extreme sim- t plicity. Bob, certain that this at last was the I lady he was in quest of, made a step or I two forward, almost fancying that he had the right to speak to her; he recollected himself in time, however, but was near enough to hear her cordial congratulations i to Mr and Mrs Stone, and to admire the pleasant tones of her. voice. When she made way for the next comers, he kept as near to her as he could and listened as she £ accosted an elderly- lady who was sitting close by. "How do you do;, Mrs Harper ?" she said. "I am so glad you are here; mother I said that you told her you were afraid you f would not be able to come." " I did not think that I- would come," I answered Mrs Harper, in a tone that im plied that she had not thought it worth while, "and I should not have done so, 1 only that Miss Jones had no one to come with, and very rightly was of opinion that it was not quite ladylike to go to a party 3 herself. You are not so shy." "No," said Mary quite simply, "I am not shy, I should not _are to enter a room full of strangers by myself, though if it had to be done of course I should do it; but I think it would be too affectedly pru dish to mind here, where I know everyone. Besides, I am older than Miss Jones.'" Yes," assented Mrs Harper, drily, "a po I older. So yoe ?et a new dress feor cuoUs as yon came in." "I am glad it was such a success," re- r plied Mary, looking complacently at the i olds of her white silk, as if she desired a nothing better than that it should occasion remark, though in reality she thought less than most girls do about her-clothes. " It I is satisfactory to know that when one has a new frock it is recognised as such. To change the subject, I wanted to tell you that I had a letter from Willie this morn "Did you? We did not," said Mrs arper. "I know; he had not time to write to us both this week, and he has not written to me before at all; and then he knew I would tell you all the news. He is very bright and cheerful, though of course he misses youen all very much----" "Us, my dear Mary?" interrupted the elder lady somewhat irritably, "'I think he is more likely to miss you than any of as. As Mary had predicted, Willie's mother hadneverquiteforgivenher for having en grossed so much of his last day at home. "Indeed,no," said Mary. "Naturally I hope he misses me too a little, but he says it seems ages since he left you. Mr Van start has been very kind and nice to him, and he has got to know some of the other young fellows by now, so it is very plea sant for him. -'New York is perfectly lovely according to his account, and he likes the rooms Mr Vansturt got for him better every day. He says that they are rather high up, but there is a magnificent view from the windows. He has been to one or two theatres--" "I hope he is not going to make that a practice:' broke in his mother severely; " sauch a thing occasionally I do not object to, but I do not like the way the young men of the present day must always be at theatres or races, or playing cards or bil liards; it generally leads to trouble of some kind." " I am sure you are right," Mary agreed, "but I think you may trust Willie to keep straight. He likes a bit of fun of course, like the rest of us, but he will never put his pleasure before his work, or carry it further than he can afford." " William is not serious enough," Mrs Harper went on. "When he was here his mind was always full of tennis and boat ing and dancing or some such frivolity. If he was at home for meals, it was quite as much as we could expect." Mary knew that this was a dig at her, because he had been her constant com panion, but she laughed good-humoredly as she answered " Oh ! we were much more serious than you imagine, Mrs Harper. You cannot think what an amount of serious reading I induced him to undertake, and our con versation was often of a deeply intellectual and instructive description." " Indeed ! I did not know it," put in Mrs Harper in her most crushingly polite manner "Blesides," continued Miss Smith" not a bit crushed and without .apparently noticing the interruption, " he had no real work to do then, and he is only nineteen; ]on't you think a little frivolity is natural at that age ?" "Oh! of course you know best," re turned the elder lady stifly. Viteut ra?ea ot annoyance oa her face she rose from the seat she had taken and moved away to speak to friends at the other end of the room. She was soon sur rounded by a group of some of the younger members of the party, who had been very indignant at her wasting on Mrs Harper so much of the time that they considered be longed by right to them. Once Dr. Arm strong would have been the first to attach himself to her, but now he stood apart, silent and grave, merely bowing to her as she passed him. She was grieved, for she really liked him and found the chatter of Dick Bilton and his friends very unin teresting compared to the young doctor's conversation ; but she saw no way of lessen ing the distance between them without seeming to mean more than she wished. While she was thinking of this and talking rather absently meanwhile to Miss. Jones, she suddenly observed a strange face among the numbers that she knew so well, and curiously enough, as she did so, she found that the eyes belonging to it were fixed upon her with a gaze of deep interest and evident approbation. Bob was not of course the only strange gentleman present, but he was almost the only one who would be likely to attract any attention, and Mary was much struck by his appearance, which seemed to indicate an amount of ex perience and knowledge of the world not common in visitors to Fogeyton. He had overheard her conversation with Mrs Harper and not only was pleased with her share in it, but particularly admired the dignity with which she put an end to it. It would have been so easy, es pecially for a woman, to retort some thing sharp and telling, but she.. ad done much better. The smile with which he had watched her still lingered on his face, ss Mary met his glance, and he looked like a man who had just had a pleasant ;urprise. She was about to ask someone sear her, who was the tall, handsome man, with grey eyes and dark moustache; when Ar Taylor, whom she had not seen since he memorable evening at the Rectory, ame up and spoke to her. Remembering with malicious enjoyment her confusion Lud her blushes when he had mentioned aim upon the former osoasiou, he immedi 'Air l oborb .15_ttoon to being questioned upon the subject that she answered him quite without embarrass ment, in fact rather enjoyed disappointing him, for she easily guessed his motive. There was a little music in the course of the evening, but Fogeyton talent in that direction was not of a high order; Mrs Stone also managed to get up a couple of tables of whist, but the charades could not be done at all, for as everyone was willing enough to play in the second, but no one would take part in the first, they naturally fell through. However, most of the company seemed quite content to do nothing in particular, and there was no flagging in the buzz of conversation that went on all over the room. It was pretty nearly time for the grand supper and Mary had just risen from the piano, when she found be side her the gentleman she had the whole evening been furtively watching and secretly admiring. After the murmur of thanks for her playing to which scarcely anyone had listened, had subsided, the general chatter recommenced, and Mary found herself for the moment with no one but the stranger near her. I hope you will forgive the liberty I take in introducing myself to you, Miss Smith," said the young man suddenly. " I have asked several people to do me the favour, but, as they have all refused, I can not help hoping that you will allow me to dispense with the usual ceremony." "They refused ?" said Mary smiling, though much astonished at such a strange occurrence. "That seems very odd." " Yes," he answered. " especially as they all laughed and declared that I knew you already." "How funny !" she exclaimed. "Per haps I have met you before." "That I can safely say you have not," he replied, " it would have been impossible for me to have forgotten it." She laughed. " That is very nicely put, but-" " Scarcely original, you were going to add," heput in. "Of course you areright, but such truths cannot be repeated too often. Anyhow I have not been in this part of England since you left the school room, so I think it unlikely." "And I suppose I strike you as being of so entirely the country-cousin type that I could never have been anywhere else--in London, for instance," she remarked, with a quiet smile. "By no means," he answered. " But that does not shake my absolute conviction that I have never met you before." "Well, it was only a suggestion," she ald."'and was made solely for the sposo refusal to introduce you to mc. WVhich reminds me that the said introduction is incomplete. Y ou seem to know my name; doubtless it is one you have heard before; but i am yet in ignorance of yours." " My name is Robert Hatton Grange," he said, watching her intently to see what effect his words produced. Luckily for MIary she was at that moment looking at something at the other side of the room. She started visibly, and the warm blood rushed into her cheeks, but, by a great effort, she managed to keep her eyes away from him for a few seconds, while she recovered herself; then turning slowly towards him she said " 1 beg your pardon; 1 did not quite catch the name." He repeated it, admiring her self-posses sion the while. "Axre you any relation to the writer of that name ?" she asked. In spite of her calmness, so astonnded was she, that it would scarcely have added to her surprise had he claimed the closest kinship with that gentleman. " Well, no," he answered. "To tell you the truth I am curious to find out some thing about that mysterious individual. As far as I know I have not a relation in the world named Grange, and yet you would have thought that no one but a relation would have had exactly the same name. I have been travelling about for ever so long, and had never heard of him till I got home lately. I was pretty soon made aware oof his existence then, though." "Were you mistaken for him ?" asked Mary, beginning to be amused at the queer position of affairs. " I should think I was," Mr Grange replied, with a ruefullaughat the recollec tion. "I was not at home a week, and I spent the whole of my time in vainly assur ing my friends that I was not, never had been, and had no intention of becoming an author. 'I did notmeetasinglecreaturewho knew him personally, so I had no one to help me in my endeavours to make people believe that it was a mistake. Indeed, I am here to-night under false pretences." " How is that ?P" "Why, Mr Stone saw my name in the visitors' book at the hotel, and niade my acquaintance upon the strength.of it. I assure you that I did my utmost to con" vince him that I was not the man he took me for,.but he refused to believe I was serious, and at last I gave.up._. So here I am, under my own name, but not in my own character; a modern instance of the 1 ass in the lion's skin, I fear. -I thought' they must be beginning to suspect me of being an impostor when I could get no one to introduce me to you." "That is easily accounted: for," said Mary. " No one here has ever seen him, d but they all know that I am personally acquainted with the other Mr Grange. Otherwise, no doubt, I should also have fallen into the popular error." " You know him ! " cried Bob, with well feigned astonishment. "You do not mean to say that I have really come across some one at last who actually knows him ? I hope you will tell me something about him; I seem to have got so mixed up with him lately that it will be quite a relief. But please do not betray me for this evening; they might suspect me of a design upon the family diamonds, and turn .mo oun A 4ot 4Can rln? ýetp _ tnh -.e with resignation, but now that I have aT chance of really enjoying myself, do not B let the name that was the means of my presence within these hospitable doors be i the cause of my exile." Mary was troubled; it had never oo curred to her that there could exist any one bearing the name she had chosen for her disguise, and she felt almost as if she I were talking to a ghost. " I will not betray you," she answered at last, gravely. "I cannot quite understand t it though; I never heard of any one of that name- any one else, I mean." "Nor I till your. friend took to.writing c books," he replied. "Do you know him t well?" c "Yes, very well indeed." i " Ah! then why should we not, just for t thisone evening, pretend that I am your friend?" he suggested, regretting the words almost as sooneas he. had uttered them,. for she coloured furiously, and ' though she was happily not aware of it, he I of course knew perfectly well the cause of her confusion. For the moment she did not know how to reply;. knowing how popular report had enlarged upon her acknowledged friendship with 'Robert Hatton Grange, she could not quite do as I he proposed, and yet she.did not see how the matter could in any way be explained. "I think the best way," she said, "will be to leave things as they are, and say t nothing at all about it, as it is only just. I for to-night. I can easily put it all right t afterwards if it is necessary." t "I wish it were not only for to-night," exclaimed Bob, feeling an unreasoning dis like for the other fellow, to .whom, of course, she was engaged. At this moment Mrs Stone joined them, 1 and began at once, with a knowing smile- t " Ah ! Mr Grange, I see .you-have done I without the introduction you were so c anxiously asking for, after all." Mary sincerely hoped that her new acquaintance would not detect the mean- c ing of the smile or of the remark that c followed. " I said nothing of your arrival even to I Mary, because no anticipated pleasure 7 comes up to an agreeable surprise. But I f isrure ..u: I- ds. Bob interrupted quickly, " to have been so i considerate of my wishes in regard to my 1 presence not being announced. Miss Smith was kind enough to dispense with I an ordinary introduction." SYou surprise me," orod the - jovi.l lady. Of course he knew to what his hostess I alluded, but he saw that Mary was getting t nervous and uncomfortable, so he tried to t start Mrs Stone's ideas in another l direction. "I hear that you have received some very beautiful presents to-day," he said. " I hope you are going to allow .us to see them. I believe it is usual upon such occasions to do all you can to induce -your' friends to break the last commandment.".. "Certainly you may see them," she re plied; "they are all in the library. Our I friends have indeed, been most kind and generous. I am not sure that their gifts = are not more numerous and valuable than on my real wedding day, five-and-twenty years ago. But you cannot go and covet them just now, for I have come over to t ask you to take Mary in to supper. By rights you ought to have fallen to my lot, but I will be generous for once, and waive my right in favour of this. young lady. I hope you appreciate my self-denial." " So far from self-denial, one can easily see that you are prompted by the fear of being bored," he answered, laughing.: "But with so many older and more im portant gentlemen present, I should, have 1 been much astonished if you had accorded me the honour, though I need hardly say that I should have appreciated it deeply." "A very charming way of-saying. you prefer Miss Smith to Mrs Stone," laughed the lady, as she left them, to go and pair off her other guests. "Whatever the manner of saying it, the fact remains," observed Grange, as soon as she was out of earshot. "I hope you are not sorry that my supposed friendship with you has procured me the pleasure of sitting next to you at supper." " If you expect me to make you a pretty speech, I fear you will be disappointed," said Mary, demurely. "I suppose that if I had particularly disliked having you for my companion, I could scarcely have in formed Mrs Stone of the fact." "As I am sure you would nob have said that if you had objected,I am satisfied that you do not," he answered, as he offered her his arm, and they joined the stream going supperwards.
