THE EDUCATION QUESTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. SIR,-The question of education is, I four, in most men's minds, a foregone conclusion, regarded as one of the political war cries which it is necessary that men of progress should ad- here to. The subject is fairly before us, and it behoves all who are interested in the future well-being of society to approach the matter unbiassed by any more consideration of party interest. It seems to me to reflect but little credit upon the Church of England in the diocese, that her members, who believe in a religious education, should let the agitation go on seething and threatening its consequences (which must be infinitely important) without taking any interest in the matter, or trying to influence its ultimate issue by letting their opinions be known, and pressing them upon the attention of the public. It is part of that laissez aller indifference of that almost effeminate respectability of the Church which would let her die of inanition (if it were possible), and seal eel) laiseahaud to save her The question has become (if I may judge from the conversation I have had with ministers of religion and others) a party one-shot one as to the quality of education for the success of the Non vested schools show as efficient teachers and satisfactory results in one set of schools as in the other of one section of the religious community getting an ascendancy I mu JB little anxious to see such a dominance as any one, but in a country where religious liberty is the great desideratum and boast of all classes, I would never consent to fight the battle against this ascendancy with such weapons, for to agitate the Education question on this ground is after all only to ask the Government to "protect" our party to the disadvantage of another The simple issue, however, is this In an education based upon religion and upon the Bible make the distinction guardedly- the best for the character and happiness of the community ? I never heard any one but a secularism, pure and simple, or an atheist deny this, and the very importance attached to the Sunday school in education by those who clamor for a National as against a Non vested system is proof of it, and if it be so, why should the religious divisions-which men are always pro claiming as so haitnloss-rendel impracticable the healthy working of an acknowledged good ? But for men (who would not advocate our turning Sunday into a day of toil) to try and crowd into the work of a Sunday the confessedly pal amount interests of our youth and the well being of society in future years is a proposi- tion that politicians may entertain, but as a social consideration, I believe it to be a fallacy In my own parish I only allow Sunday school once a day from a conviction, based upon ox pronounce, that over doing Sunday school work has done much to give distaste for religion and weaken its legitimate influence You may disturb the Non vested systematic sweep it away, but one section of the community will have its schools notwithstanding, and you will have the not very creditable spectacle of Romanism with its schools and religious system of education, and the Church of England, and the numerous bodies of Protestants, whose very watchword is an open Bible, unable, owing to their divisions, to arrange an education which shall be unmistakably religious, because based on the Word of God That which grieves me in the matter is, that in those days when any and every one, without other qualification than that he " feels moved," as he says, by the Holy Ghost to go and preach the Gospel-hall) gospel he likes, the gospel of his own will and fancy-yet because he gets it from the Bible, is welcomed as a minister of the Christian religion, and yet a free and open Bible is to be excluded and jealously guarded in our schools for education It is this contradiction; that in days like these, when the authenticity of the Bible as a rule of conscience and faith is being so lightly ona freely discussed, must throw discredit upon it, and lower its power among us as an unerring guide of morals and belief It is true (no wonder) that has called forth at home the protest of one hundred and sixty four leading Dissenters, including Mr Allan, M.P., Mr. Barnes M.P., Mr. Conder, Mr Thom Dav ideas, Mr J Dyke, M J Fleming, Dr Newman Hall, Mr Thomas Jackson, the President of the Wesleyan Cow for once, Dr Jobson, Professor Leone Levi, Mr S Wall, Air Al that, M 15, Mr O E Music, Mr G W Oliver, Dr Osborn, Dr Parker, Mr Chas Reed, M P Dr Rigg, Mr G Smith, Dr Spence, Air Spurgeon, Dr Stoughton, Mr Joseph Britton, Dr Waddy, and Dr Unwin, who have advertised a declaration, stating that, " As strenuous efforts are being made to exclude the Bible by law from Public Elementary Schools, they, being unconnected with any Established Church, and believing that such exclusion would be a great national evil, feel it their duty publicly to record their disapproval thereof " These men saw ministers of religion and some larists hanged together for the expulsion of the Bible from the school, and could the most ardent sceptic free thinker, when he wants an argument against the work of the Bible, desire a more complete one ? Can we ourselves not see, if we will look at the matter impartially), that us in youth we must educate, so our education will full if it develops and strengthens every faculty, except the controlling ones, for the former is what national education, pure and simple, will only do What we must agitate for, it seems to me, must be this that there shall be ascendancy, as far as judicious legislation can prevent it, and to effect this no body of Christians (or Cinnamon, if they want a school, and will be governed by the same principles), shall receive aid from " the grant for education " beyond the proportion they represent in the census of the population , only I say let us who value the Bible band together for its free use, and not, because of difficulties of administration or temporary divisions, have it a sealed book in the great work, for which it alone is adapted, of education and religion -Yours, in All Saints, August 17 T JONES PS-The report on St John's School up poured after this was written I am obliged to regard it as almost cruel, and very unfair to the present muster to select a bald statement of the kind and put it forth at this particular juncture of the education question The fact is that twelve mouths ago the school changed hands, and since the present master entered on his duties an Inspector has not been near the schools The statement is (not intentionally, I am sure) in leahy suppressio vin, for alongside of it in fairness ought to have been put the numerical success which has attended the Non vested schools in places like Spring Hill (Brisbane), Toowoomba, Warwick, do T J [The statement, bald as it is, is all that appears on the subject in the Board's report It is the very latest official information procurable, and the public have no means of knowing whether the school is better or worse since the Inspector reported upon it last. We cannot admit that it was either unfair or cruel to select for publication the report on St John's School in preference to others ist John's is the oldest and most important Church of England school in the colony, and it has lately been hold up us a sample of the I and of school the Church of England demands in place of the National or "Vested" Schools under the Board If this sort of school is to be supported entirely of the public expense, the public have a right to know exactly what they are getting for their money A mere change of master at the school cannot have made much difference, as the Inspector complained chiefly of the " administration," which he characterised as belonging to a live -ED B C]
