THE SHIP IN WHICH CAREY WAS SHOT. The unlucky Kilfauns Castle (says the Irishman), being unable to wash the bad blood of James Carey out of the cabin floor, hnd to give up the South African trade, and Fell herself to a foreign power. No one would touch her ; not a soul would risk its worldly existence in hor unhallowed charge. Tho ghost of Carey, and heaven knows how many other ghosts in his company, would not give them a moment's rest in their bunks, if they did not sink tho ' Castle ' in the depths of the sea. Stained with Carey's blood, the Kilfauns was a haunted ship, which the hardiest and daringest would not inhabit for one weird hour of night. The denouement of the tragic story is as strange as anything in truth or fiction. The Kilfauns has been bought by the Russian Government ; her name is changed, but her new title is con cealed until she is away among the Russians who know her not. Sailors are more super stitious than landlubbers, and if the Russian marines came to known the lass they were sailing in they would rather scuttle her than run her for a voyage.
