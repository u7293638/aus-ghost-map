MAURITIUS. TnE Dauison, from Mauritius, arrived at Hobaifc Town, on the 18th Instant, after a ?passage of forty-thred days. By the Hobart Town mail, per Waterlily, yesterday, wo nave received Mauritius i'rice Currents to the 27th November ; a Sentinei.le de Mauhice of 28th September ; and Le Ceknben of 20th November. ? ? The proprietors of tho miserably sup ; ported newspapers at this settlement, were about' to petition tho Governor, to obtain from his Excelloncy tho reversal of a ineu mre lately put in force — namely, the taxing -f newspapers' as well as' letters — by the Postmaster, Mr. Brownrigg, without pre rious authority, moreover, of the Executive Power, or that of the Legislative Council ! Vlthough the impost may appear small, yet' he Cerneen rightly observes, that it is suffi sient to be overpowering to the journals of he Colony, but one that will be useless as a revenue to the Treasury. Newspapers ire taxed enough with bad debts, or in other irords, dishonest debtors, without requiring the aid of Government, or a reckless official, bo lessen their incomes. The Sen tin ei, complains loudly of the apathy of the Government, until the aleventh hour, to devise measures to stay the epidemic, which was destroy ing hundreds of their cuttle week after week. The receipt now offered to the settlers, after upwards of 12,000 of their cattle had- 'given up the ghost* — 'forbids the passage of bullocks on the country roads!' The people naturally enquire — How then are the few left for food to bo brought to the slaughter-houses?- This law, it appears, was opposed by. the non-officials as absurd, but their voicos were stifled by the officials. With the exception of the above two grievances, we can find nothing to remark upon ; — the former is calculated to bring low the Press; and tho latter to starve the people. - - ? ' ? In the latest Prices Current (Nov. 27), however, wo find the following quotations and remarks : — ' Since our last report on Sugars, there has been more demand, and as little sugar comes into the market, prices are firmer.'

We have been' favored by Captain Darby, oi tho Afunford, with the following account of the Comet, aa seen by him on the night of Friday 20th December, at 9 p.m., civil time, in ,lat, 42° 44' S, long, (at noon) 130* 43' E. When first observed, the Comet bore S. W.'by W. ; its meridian altitude, by Letthat, was 13 ° 25' 20'; length of tail, 2° 7' 15'. It set about 10h.' 27m. p. m., bearing S. W. by S.; For the -five following nights the atmosphere was so clouded that no further observations could be made. After which period, coming in with the land, and finding that it had been observed by the Vandemonians, he did not think it necessary to continue his observations. , '? ? ?♦- ?

Body Found. — On Sunday evening, the remains of a person, who, apparently, Irom his dress, and the articles found by him, must have been of rather a superior rank, was discovered in the Bun^araboe Brush, an the Western 'Road, and which, from the fact of the flesh being nearly gone, must have been dead some time. The deceased seems to have been handsomely dressed, having a black hat, Cossack boots, and black coat. Beside tho body, was a leather portmanteau, tlie contents oi which were a handsome blue coat, sevorul tooth-brushes, and other small articles, a handsome blue cloth cloak, a blue cap with peak, a bamboo walking-stick, with crook handle, a tortoise-shell pocket-comb, and a mother o'pearl case, on which was a silrei plate and inscription, F. G. TV. engraved. There was also a portion, apparently, of tin Englishman, Calcutta paper, of January or February, 1840. An enquiry will be held before the Coroner on Wednesday, at the house, formerly Smith's public-house, on the western Road.
