THAT " GHOST" EXPLODED. The Newcastle Chronicle has the following. A good deal too much gossip has gone the rounds for a fortnight past about the " Sbep herd's Hill Ghost." The bubble, however, was Batislactorily burst beyond a doubt on Wednesday night. Three well-known residents (whose names we withhold, as they had no idea of figuring in public over so schoolboyish a matter) paid a visit of inspection, and descended the cliffs. They had previously taken a wise precaution of warning the assembled multitude above that "they were not ghosts," and consequently had no relish for stray pistol bullets from the overhanging cliff. They marched straight to the spot at which the phosphoric light has for many nightepastappeared,andthoronghlyestablished the fact thattheillusion isnothing more nor less than an optical illusion, caused by refraction of stelliform light. The ghostly thing was clearly visible from a distance, hut once closely approached it vanished into space, showing clearly that a star shining into a pool of salt water irom a particular angle of the heavens had given rise to the stupid piece of humbug that for many nights past has drawn some score of idlers to the Bpot. It may be mentioned that Mr. Gorrick, M.L.A. for the Wollombi, was one of the first to beard the ghost in its den, and prove to the minds of all sensible persons by strolling down the cliffs in pitch darkness and up to where the light appeared, that the whole thing was a " fraud' from beginning to end.
