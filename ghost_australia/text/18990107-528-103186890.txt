W-o ran back and found our umucicy MacUfoHow tn Uie eraap of a glgantlo crab Bovcnteon foot across from claw to clan. Cumbo wan dexd fond of crabs, and ho had sighted this ono, «n-l thought to tnko him homo on the quiet for his own supper, and the crab bad probably thouEht of tak ing Cumbo homo for his supper, and tho rc ault was that the crab got Cumbo n too In chancery, and tho blackfellow reckoned hlu last .hour had come. We had a stand-up fight with that crab, but we disabled and killed him at last, ntnl wo boiled some of him for soup, and tho lesh turned grwn in ra« '«i «.-^. ...u^^-.v. if red. and the old man said It was a raro peclcs. and only fouml-M odd luterwila on he West Coast of Ireland. ? When wo broke the creature's skull opon vlth.an.axo we had In the canoe, we found ( nest of pearls in hla head, some ot which ,vero as large as goose egga, and of tho ilrst ivater. , U ^vis tho first ?tlmo I over heanl ot pearls being found In crabs, but the Gov. Qeueral gjiUI he had known of It before. There was a crab described by I'llny. a native of 'tho Medltoranncan. that carried pearls. You couldn't pur.zle the old man much In natural history, or anything elae, for that matter. We mined that crustacean carefully, and vhnn wo had woahod up we calculated that lie panned out about £18,000 worth of jowollery. The old man put the largest pearl oaldo to presorfl It to Queon Victoria, He nald it wan 'tho right thing to do aa a loyal British subject, and Her Majesty would bo pleased ?to keep It in remembrance of him. Between ournelvca, I think the Governor-Genera! had his «ye on a distinction of some nort. J'orhaps ho thought that an a dlBtingulahcd .navljca'l-or, who had considerably widened tho domains of scientific knowledge, he was entitled to a P.C-shlp. or something. The Gov.-Gon.. tied tho pcarla up in an old red bandanna handkerchief, and put them In tho prow of tho canoe, which, wo drew up into a llttlo creek.- Tho old man wanted to oareon 'her and scrape lior bot-, torn, and. tallow her to mnke her sail bot tur, but Cumbo opened his mouth and »ald lie could, umell bananas Inland. Ho /had a -i'aTOflcnnt- fOT.-rlBO fruit had Cumbo, and aa we hadn't had any ~ue32?i-t with our crab dinner wo went Into 'tho woods, Th« -51H 'innn leading wl'Wi the axe over hit) shoulder. AVo vllscovored a grove of banana trews, but 'the fruit that grow on these troeB was not 'to bo compared to the alleged FIJI ba nanas— 21 tn a bag for Cd. You couldn't have put 21 of these Into a wool pack. They wero larger than tho largo kind of Gorman eaueagea, and as round na a verandah-post. Ono of them was a meal for live ordinary men, and Cumbo could only cat 'two, and then hla eyoB bulged out ho was 'that packed. Tho flavor of tho fruit wan between, strawberries and bacon and eggu. Wo took -i couplo along to mako fritters of' — they wore 'Us much as wo could' carry ?hung on a polo. By and bye wo got tired, and efit down under a peculiar obapod troo. I thought at first 'It was a Queensland bottlo-treo, but It was tthaped moro like, .a cask, and had rlngu round it whoro tho hoopB might liavo, boon. ' Tho Govornor- Gonor'al got smelling and poking round tho troo, fooling tho bark and thinking, and presently ? ho took tho axo and drovo tho point of it Into tho bark. When ho withdrew tho blado a (itroam of clear ambor-colorod. liquor poured forth. Tho old man caught some of thla in hid lint and taptod it. . ? Quick as a shot I iiaw him put hla thumb . to tho gash In tho trunk to ntop'tho liquor ' fldwlnis away,- ar\d then keeping it. thoro as I n 'fiptgot'lio drained oft ' tho hatful' and mnaoked Ills Hpn. 'What lo it.- Govornor 7' I uukod. ' ' ? 'Tltuii aoptlmuB, my Hon,' «ald Uio old man, in a ploannnt, choorful tono, romovlng hlo thumb and putting tho hat under^nrd more : 'It'a boor ; good, lionoat Hngllsli draught alo, n« mollo-.v ito any I ovor tasted In my Ufo.' 'Qo 'way I' I nald, oflglng tov/ards tho trunk ; 'then thin must bo n beor tree.' 'You'vo lilt it,' replied tho Govcrnor Gonoral, tnking another hatful ; 'It'n a nntlvo bcor troe on full tap, and no charge Hang mo If I don't take out a lloomio and Htart a boor garden. It would pay llko old 'It might,' I (iaid— (give uu a drink, dad) — U wo1, hud tho population.' . 'We'd 'dorn soon got tho population It wo had tho .beer,' nnld tho old man.
