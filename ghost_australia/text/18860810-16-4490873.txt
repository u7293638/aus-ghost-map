THE LAND ACT AND THE WESTERN OTHER SIDE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. SIR, - Your correspondent, "A Working Man," whose letter appears in your issue of 24th instant, judging by his remarkable success as a " horny handed son of toil which is to the tune of £3000 or £4000, must be a man of some ability in his own particular line. If he would explain what line that is he would confer a benefit upon his co workers, who perchance could go and do likewise At all events, a man who can legitimately rake together so fair a competence by labour should be entitled to some attention, but doubt arises as to whether it is not more the result of others' labour than his own, perchance amassed by working on their weaknesses The tone in which he writes stamps him as a squatter's man-pure merino-and the views he advocates are inimical to the interests of the class he professes to adorn, for closer settlement appears to be his late hour He commences by stating the term " the rich pasture lands of the West to be a Queen street definition. There is no doubt their fame has suffered by the late drought, but meteorological history teaches us to expect of three years' reign of big droughts at regular periods of eighteen or nineteen years apart. The Mitchell district is but a spot on the area the continent "crushed" by it, and has not suffered in any greater degree than the bulk The term is implicitly truthful Where else is the natural pasture so luxuriant and healthful that stock eat it with avidity in the shape of hay, yielding two or three harvests a year at the rate of half to over a ton per acre at each cutting The Chinamen gardeners grow any vegetables they like, and several fruits, there are two patches of oats growing, one patch of oats and maize, and one patch of lucerne, which was sowed two years ago, and has yielded five cuttings in the last seven months, and now almost ready to cut again Your correspondent is another example of those one idea men who accept the Land Act as ample cause for the existing depression New South Wales has also a new Land Act, and a very aggravating one, and is suffering in an equal manner from depression, but the corn- stalks are more sensible than to raise so thin a ghost South Australia is suffering from greater depression than we are, but, strange to say, they have consummated it without any new Land Act, this anomalous position on the part of Queensland is explained as follows -The squatters are nearly suffocated with mortgages, the grand seasons ahead of us and rising markets will induce mortgagees to foreclose, their tenacious class ore already tightening, a number of the squatters are desperate, they must raise a fictitious value for their properties or risk election, they presented their object at Thargomindah in the shape of thirty years'' leases at fixed rentals, which would raise their leases to a high premium in a short time , they have great power now, for our prosperity depends essentially on grazing, and they are as yet the only graziers The ordinary business people prefer the bird in the hand to the bird in the bush, so the squatters move the storekeepers, commission agents, publicans, and, who convene a meeting and invited the horny-handed to look on The people who are worked up for the occasion go, others go without other interest than to pass the time, and those who do not agree with the movement stay away ; ergo, the cut and dried resolutions are carried unanimously or thereabouts The simple fact that none of the petition forms hung up in Blackall hotels have a single signature attached will speak for itself. Now for the reason that the depression was more apparent in the West than along the seaboard A few years ago, after grand seasons had made the district famous a speculative mania arose for properties in it which reached to gambling rates , heavy stocking was necessary to pay the interest and make a profit This demanded a heavy y outlay in enormous improvements, which created an unprecedented influx of labour , then comes the drought and fall in wool, speedy cessation of improvements, and labour still flowing in. When the men thought of leaving there was depression everywhere else Cm bone I They stopped, and increased the burden of the West. When sinking under gambling prices, drought, the fall of wool, and mortgaged almost to the lost pound, they raise the cry of " The Land Act has undermined our security " The rents are greater than the value of the land, five years' appraise- ment amounts to a five years' lease , a Government can sweep us away with unlimited increase to rent, c, ad nauseam " There is not doubt the resumptions shook the faith of capital till the Act was understood, but capital now acknowledges the security is better than before. The rent is a mere cipher is the interest that kills. Government and rent are distinct. The Land Board is constitutionally independent of any Government, and any person whose rent is unreasonably raised can obtain redress by appealing to the Supreme Court Where, then, are the impossible terms of " A Working Man " As usual with the individuals of the genus who " claim to be an intelligent and reasoning human being, though only a working man,' he scoffs at the intelligence of others If he imagines the assurance that he would not take the best 20 100-acre patch in the Mitchell will deter. others from doing so, he is much mistaken. To witness, the first 20,000 acre selector in the colony and district is a late manager of Barcaldine station, and the other lands selected have been secured by men as careful of their capital, as clear in judgment, and as well qualified to judge, whose knowledge of the colony is more extensive, and who have seen the country under as unfavourable circumstances as "A Working Man His bona fides appear very dubious, and, if in earnest, he must have become fossilised during his twenty two years' residence in the Never Never. It seems almost impossible to believe an intelligent being" could live so long in the country without discovering the insurance against drought afforded by Nature to small graziers Only the malcontent squatters are referred to above for there are, of course, plenty of good men. who can stand the squeezing without egotism. I also enjoin his fellow workmen "-in scribbling or in labour to think seriously over these matters, though the colony en masse will decide them, and to remember also that the Mitchell district will never again be the Never Never, that squatterdom will never more be the sole power out West, and that out West is getting outer and outer cut ry year-long, size ONE WHO HAS SELECTED. Blackall, 30th July. N.B. There is no denying that squatters have suffered severe reverses from natural causes, and are entitled to consideration for opening up the country ; any concessions such as limitation of rent, seven and a-half years' appraisements, or postponement of increased payment of rent for twelve months at deben- ture interest, which would better their position without detriment to the community, would be but a generous acknowledgment of their value as colonists ; but in justice, the former should then apply to grazing farms also. How much better it is for the general benefit of these colonies when large estates of good land are subdivided into workable farms and sold is referred to by the Geelong Advertiser, which mentions that the Cororooke Estate, Colac, which was only subdivided last year, is being rapidly transformed into a scene of industry, there being already fifteen farmers on, the ground, and over 300 acres will be Planted with potatoes this season. It is expected that, the experiment of cutting up this estate having proved so successful, other estates will be similarly divided. Our Darling Downs landowners should take this hint from Victorian experience,
