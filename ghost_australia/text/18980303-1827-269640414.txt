So once again did they set out in the directioh of Jhespot where they had last seen the mysterious creature, ani! there instituted a. strict scrutiny. , - The most- trivial -indication that -anyone or anything, living-had; passed orer abe ground was quic^ly t inojedsb'y Northage, and seconded by Blackshaw. Firstly^ a (leaf brushed from the twig of a tree, or a small poftibWof'rocttmoss 'dislodged a faint, though none the less unmistakeable, footmark m a.damp place; andeach fresh, discovery of more or less importance was made, Northage • began to grow highly elated—^ - • " r v-v-:- - -. " We are certainly on his track, Blackshaw, old man." : " 1 really beiieve we are." - - " Keep your two eyes peeled, for we may drop"upon him at any moment." --,-• -•• • • : And : so they proceeded on .their way : some'times'at fault,- and then again -fully confident that they were on the right track, -until they -had penetrated for a considerable distance into the bush. ; "Steady does it," whispered Northage to his companion, " I can plainly see a large number of. tracks crossing, .and recrossmg which; to my mind, proves conclusively that 5 w« are nearing his haunt." " Have you .your revolver?'" : "Yes, and ready loaded, but we must not use then* except as a' last resource, and even then Ha 1 what'*, that ? " \- He pointed to a spot in a small clearing about sixty yards m advance of where they were standing. : i " Why," ejaculated Blackshaw, " it's the handsomer gentleman himself." "You're right, my -friends''::rejoined -Northage, • "bill wUar in'-the "-norld is lie doing? • ; " Gathering gum from the trees and eating it." " Oh 1 so thatiappears as though lie have finished off our late delicacies, does it-not ? Hullo 1 what's hevdomg-now ?•. cutting wood, sh?" . " He appears :to be going to considerable trouble to hud the driest and most resinous parts of the trees; wants them . for his fire, I presume," " Rushlights," suggested Northage. " Scarcely probable, unless he resides^ underneath the : 1 earth" •.. • " However, the best plan, to my mind, is for -us to wait : until it suits his, convenience to move on, and- then closely follow him." They had not long to wait, for presently the strange ; creature plunged into the bush at a swinging pace- and \- the two detectives quickly . followed: To them it was a matter of no small difficulty, for, m addition to keeping their quarry in sight, it was positively necessary, for the success of th^ir enterprise, to keep -themselves out.iol sightj-and convenient bushes.or.any olyects of substan!ce : : that presented themselves were utilised for the purpose.. ,.,; .The mysterious creature—whether human or not'thi?y could not even yet determine—led 'them in • tikis manner for the distance of about half a mile imtil, without : the. slightest warning, he disappeared completely an& most mysteriously. from their view; Isosilently and unexpectedly that our two friends stood still and positively gasped.' " Well, I-'ms blest," muttered Northage, while his companion stood - and gazed in open-mouthed astonr : ishment at the;mysterious vajiishiiSg point. ^ -r ; Before theni they perceived the face of a sm'all hillock, barely, five feet high; 1 and composed of granite' and loose pebbly gravel, and it appeared to them ia-s though the : strange- creature had literally disappeared into the bill; no opening could they see, for rigbt across the/ace of the hill grew a thick, tangled mass of prickly creeper . The bewildered detectives reconnoitered, and, upon close investigation. Northage was convinced that the creature had actually penetrated through the leafy tangle J " But there's no opening>m "it,' protested Blackshaw, unconvinced "Well, 1 there's not exactly a ball door, with knob and knockei and" all the rest, but he apparently made an opening^for himself, and -wenYust do the same Did you not notice, when first ive saw him; how his arms and face, ' bleedings, ;clearly provJng ^at its furthest end, to^which-the ground trended :ri va 1 most prodigious -slope, and ;they 'werV each convinced" that somewhere within- that ^natural doorway^ tliey Tvould find that which they ¥had,come to^eek. ] £ -"In for a (penny, in for^tnlna," J quolh the imperturbable Northage. r",come along SfBlackshajv.',' ; , They approachedihe ^opening, ^nd'found it to'be the* narrow mouth.'ofa subterranean paksafeefwitliin whlclf ,it was dark as r Hadesjitself " ljtr " We're sto^pea;'^Sikly^sBoke.Blackshaw:- ' " How so, my frienS*? 1 "" 1 1 11 " " No light ,J can't po'ibly^e^here we're going " A'My dearf boy, «when ^Nature ^intended jamej: Northage for a clever-man, she tiidn fhalf^dothmg J a ^rPvertold you? before' """ ^ " ~ " Oh, indeed i how s tffat- toiav?l4sk ( " Ah' that is good; what have you, an electric light plant - F]?or answer,"^ortliage.produced from his coat pocket a penny.^ariowjcaiidle and a' box of safety; matches, and 4»r&ently;^ajfainti^limmefli3g'bghtimade'darkiiess,visibH and Jfliey proceeded "on their way. ^hey wefe in a'low, iiarrow, rocky passage-way, with a Sry, jpebblyt^loor, which sloped abruptly .between .grails? ?agaust •.^whick'iaieir^noble'eramums seemed determined to wage war,- to their' gre , a1^ffliseo'mfort.
