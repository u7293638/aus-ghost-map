ROYAL STANDARD THEATRE. The dramatic season at tho Royal standard Theatre is now in full swing again, and the first Friday evening Shakespearean representa tion took place lust night, when Mr. Alfred Dampier appeared as Hamlet. There was a large audience, aud the talented aud favorite artist received a very flattering reception. His Hamlet ban lost none of its original force and fire ; indeed, if anything, the comparative rest Mr. Dampier has had the opportunity of enjoy ing during his pantomime season bps been the means of "aiding him materially, and the Prince is plaved by him with freshness and perfect ease. "Miss'Catheiiue Russell, as Ophelia, was loudly applauded lor her careful acting, aud Mr. Boothman's Liertes and Mr. Marsh's PolouiuB aud Mr. Holloway' Ghost were excel lent performances. It is proposed to present early this month to Mr. C. N. Newdegate a testimonial in recogni tion of his services as member for North War wickshire for upwards of 42 years. _ Tbe testi monial will be presented by Loid Leigh.
