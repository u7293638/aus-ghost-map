THEATRICAL AND MUSICAL. A matinee performance of the " Lights o' London" was given by Mr. Rignold and his company at Her Majesty's yesterday. The show was given in pursuance of an invitation issued by "the management to tbe members of the Gaiety Burlesque people and other members of tho theatrical profession, a very largo number of whom put in an appearance. The members of the Gaiety Company occupied that portion of the circle usually dovoted to the accommodation of vice- royalty. The right of admission on the usual terms being open to the public, there was a very large house, composed princi pally of ladies, which was only natural after all. The play itself went with that smoothness common to it, the best line of the afternoon being Mr. Greville's refer ence to the "ghost walking," which set all the actors in a roar. Altogether, the afternoon was enjoyable. The first annual meeting of the District Licdertafel was held in ' the Parra- matta School of ArtB on Monday evening, . Mr. C. J. Byrnes, presi dent, in the chair. The report sub mitted was a most satisfactory one, and special referenco was made to the valuable services rendered by the honorary con ductor, Mr. Arthur Massey. The balance- sheet showed that there were 89 non-per forming and GO performing members, and that, after paying all expenses, there was a small credit balance in the bank.
