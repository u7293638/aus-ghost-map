? : - poetry Tho SWehl. . Ob 1 did you hear n voico of death ? And did you not mark tho paly form WhioU rode on tho Bilver mist oi tho heath, \- Arid eang o ghostly dirgo in tho Btorm? Waa it a walling bird of tho Bloom, Which nhrloka on tho house oi woo oil night? Or a shivering fiend that flow to a tomb, To howl and to food till thoglanco of light? 'Twas not tho death bird'u cry from tho wood, Nor Bhivcring fiend that hung in tho blast; \- ' 'Twas tho ohado of Helderia— mau of blood — 1 Itaoreama for tho guilt of daya that tiro . past 1 S90 how tho red, red lightning otrays, \ ? And eoarea tho gliding ghost of tho heath I Now on the lcaflcsn yew it playa. Whero bangs tho shield of tho Bon of death I That shield .is blushing with murderous etaina ; Long baa it hung from tho cold yew'o \- - _ spray ; It is blown by Btormo and washed by rnine, But neither can talio tho blood away. Oft by that yew, on tho blasted field, Dernona dance to the red moon'3 light; \- ? - While the damp 'boughs creak, and the Bwing iug shield ' ? j Sings to tho raving opirit of night I
