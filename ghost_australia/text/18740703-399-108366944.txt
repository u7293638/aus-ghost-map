LIGHT BBOOJL [[From our own Correspondent.]] Jane 25, 1874. The farmers here ,have finished their seeding operations, at least for this year;. but I have heard grave expressions of anger purporting that the rabbits may cause these agricultural labours to have a sudden finale. There is not ! the slightest ghost of a doubt that these little j destructive creatures do a tremendous?amount j of damage. It was only a day or two ago that a respectable farmer informed me that they (the j rabbits) had destroyed 200 acres out of 600 j acres of wheat already ; and there is scarcely a vestige of green vegetation visible for hundreds of cultivated acres around where these destroyers abound. Vast numbers are daily receiving their " quietus," but myriads more take the places of the departed. I think the Government ought ? to try and| do; something for the unfortunate suffering agriculturists. Our school here has been re-opened by, I presume, a competent master, and appears to be thriving under his management The duties are suspended during this week because of the | Mid-winter vacation. The weather for jthe past few-days has been fine, but cold. and windy until to-day (Satur day), when a drizzling rain set in and which has every appearance of continuance. The crops, except where demolished by the rabbits, look as fine and healthy as could be j wished. 1 -
