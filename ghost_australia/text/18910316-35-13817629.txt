OPENING OF THE' RAILWAY INSTITUTE. '5-46 SPEECHES BY SIR HENRY PARKES AND MR. M'MILLAN. The ceremony of declaring the Railway Institute open was performed by Mr M ' Millan (Minister for Rail was)on Saturday evening Tholorgohall was crowded with visitors. Mr Hugh McLachlan (Secretary to the Railway Commissioners) presided, and on the platform a were Sir Henry Parkes, Mr McMillan, Mr bo id hap, Ms LA, Messrs Eddy, 1 choir, and Oliver (Kahn by Commissioners), Roberts (Tramway Manager) lack caddie (Chief 1 braille Manager of Railways), and others The building was nicely decorated for the occasion. The CHArity A.N", in commencing the proceedings, said he need hardly tell them that the object of their gold ring there that night was to dedicate to the railway service the magnificent building in which they were assembled shortly after the Railway Commissioners took office in this country they saw the great advantage that would accrue by having a building of this disease as they had seen the advantages of similar societies and institutions in other place but he thought they were starting that night a movement that would make similar institutions founded clothes They found that throughout a 1 the lines the movement had been taken up in earnest, and they had received many letters from country branches that members were coming in Only that day they received a letter from Dubbo that 41 members had joined, and the letter expressed regretting the great distance prevented them from being repr served last night the counry members should boablutolnk lull enchanted of those ondid Uhr try that had been provided! The Commissioners asked the continent totrovido them with funds to establish the building, and through the goodness of the Government and the great interest the Minister for Railways, Mr M Millan, had always taken in the matter the money was passed, and the ultimate success was the building in which they were assembled that night And, so far as the management of the institute was concerned, the rules had practically been drawn up by themselves, because the Kalucy Commissioners had mostly handed the building over to the service The management of the institute would therefore be in harmony with the spirit and wishes of the men. The committee was pleased to find that so many were willing to come forward and render their assistance, and some of the gentlemen had given them very large and valuable contributions Mr Goodchap practically gave of from their library, and he was glad to say a portrait of that gentleman now adorned their hall so that they would always have a remembrance of Mr Goodchap Mr M'bvvecnoy had sent them a che star for 20, Mr, Angus, the contractor, £20, and Mr Scammel, the iron and steel manufacturer, of England, had sent them £20 and exhibits Mr Sydney Smith, Mr Bruce Smith, and Mr O'Connor had assisted them with contributions from their different departments, and Mr Bruce Smith had sent them a valuable collection of books He had received apologies for non attendance from Mr Sydney built, and he might mention that Mr Sydney Smith was at one time a railway man being for many years in the traffic branch The iuibUt also tell the n that in the present Parliament there were from members who at one time or other were in the railway service Professor Warren, Mr C Cowper, and Mr Bruce Smith sent apologies Mr Bruce Smith a letter was so nicely worded that he might read it to them-" Please convey to the committee of your institution my thanks for their invitation to be present at the opening ceremony on Saturday next I regret to say that I shall not be in town on that day, otherwise I should be very pleased to be present on so interesting on occasion I have no doubt that the opportu- under which the institute will afford for the coming together of members of the railway by son vice with solf improving inclinations, will be productive of a large amount of sympathetic co operators the various branch s of munitions moral cultivation aimed at by its originators and, apart from such advantages, I feel sanguine that the frequent meeting of the members of the different branches of the rail way service on common grounds, freed from the restraints which are inseparable from the hours of active service, niUBt done to establish a broad and generous feeling between men of different grades in the service, the routine portion of whose life might never afford of portunities for friendly intercourse or mutual fellowship I need not say that I wish to institute every form of success and I trust I shall have the pleasure of visiting it on some future odorous. Yours faithfully limits by the " Letters of apology had also been received from others. It was not his place to detain them, but he might say that they had now a library suitable for their requirements, u which was not equalled in the colony and hoped they would appreciate it The institute would meet the members on opportunity of coming together on common ground I ber of was perhaps nothing over started in the railway serv leo that would more tend to bring the men together and on into a harmonious feeling; than this, and it would cause them to work better for themselves and the public (Cheers ) Mr. M Mu t N, who was received with cheers, said he thought it was only fair to himself to say that when he understood this institution was to be opened, he asked his hon colleague at the head of the Government, Sir Henry Parkes, the author of The Railway Act under which they existed, to perform the ceremony (Cheers ; He informed him (Mr McMillan) as the responsible Mmtslorovor this Department, that he thought more properly speaking, it was his duty, but he told him at the same time that at the expense of of any inconvenience he ("-is Henry Parkes) would be present to support him on that occasion (Cheers) Ivow, Hwasoueof the apparently necessary conditions of all great services businesses, that those who were at the head of affairs did not come as often as might be expected in contact with all the machinery which they administer, and to fortunately that was the case with a Minister of the Crown in the great serv lees of this country, but he did not know any sight more fitted to make a man feel the responsibility of the situation than wh a he came face to face with 100, sometimes 1000, of the men whose comforts were to a certain extent, entrusted to his care When he looked around him and he was no flatterer of hisfeliovv-in^n-lihou he looked around him and saw the respectable and intelligent faces he felt that he was a minister of a Ilepirtiuent worthy of even this great colony, and the re- possibility which restored him to administer that Department evils of a very w eights ch is actor He iv and like to say one or two words that night with regard to increase ment of a great service, probably with the regard to the institution air Henry Parkes might have something to say But he would like to point out to tin so listening to him, and probably, through the press, to the whole railway department of this country, that they were all labor Dependent to one another, than the head Commissioner to the smallest boy in the service lucy must reflect that every business of life no matter how simple, must have management regulations Now, take for example what he believed had been going on for some months past-co operative work in one of the collieries under the authority of the Railway Commissioners there, he believed, the Railway Commissioners had tried for the first time the cooperative d system, and own in such a simple undertaking as that they must have their rules, they must have (hair regu nations, they must appoint the most intelligent and capable men to supervise that work. they must have what technically they called their lives" Matters were regulated in such a way that no man scamped it is work, and there was rigid discipline in a simple undertaking of that land Now, the greater the business the most complete There must be the machinery, from the head, represented by their Commissioners, down to the smallest boy in the service, there must be an interdependent link of responsibility, and if any section of that eli it was broken (then the whole Service became disorganised When a man or boy entered r great service such as the railways of this colony, he immediately took the place which he decided to occupy, or which was supposed to be most suitable to his particular ability, in that service, as in all services in a free country, if he was civil, intelligent, and industrious, there was no chance of advancement that was closed against him. He should in each step that he took in each position that he occupied, feel that he belonged to a great service that these regulations to which he referred must go through the whole of that great service, he must do his duty faith- fully and loyally according to the conditions of his engagement (( here ) Mow the railway servants occupied a peculiar position of advent ago They did not belong to an autocratic company such as those that exist in the old country, they did not belong to a business where they could be dismissed with little or no notice and with little reason, but they belonged to a state business, administered by an Act of Parliament, and their rights and privileges were absolutely guaranteed Ihuro would be in every great service in the world, whether a state or private business, petty tyranny They could not get men to occupy certain positions without having men creep in who were not fit for those positions, and who were petty tyrants at heart (Cheers) But in a Borneo like the railway service of this country they had an 1 immediate court of appeal through all its ramifications until they got to the Commissioners themselves. And what was their court of appeal? Their court for every grievance under the Railway Act was the Commissioners sitting in council-not one but all three must sit together and judge of complaints And what interest had the able iron who occupied the position to do an injustice to any man i No one in his common sense would seek unpopularity Many men were unpopular Probably he was unpopular himself (Cries of No no.") But a man could only do his duty and no man would make himself unpopular against his own conscience and his own judgment So man in the great service of the State, from the Commissioners down to the petty officers, was an angel. Every man would make mistakes of judgment, but (boy must not consider because they were made they were willingly made, or that there was any malice connected with them. They must take all men in their broad general aspect They must look at the conditions that surrounded them and the difficulties they had to meet If the service was permeated with such a spirit of fair play and of esprit de corps without which no service could bring about satisfactory results in a few years it would stand second to no service in the world One is word more on that point they were not there, as he hinted before, under any system of autocracy, but under an Act of Parliament introduced and carried out by the Premier on lines which clearly laid down what administration was to take place and it was clearly provided that in the administration of the whole department there must be no political interference (Cheers) When he heard men but king about bringing back political interference it reminded him of a man selling his birthright for a mass of postage It might be good enough for some man who liked to be half-political and half private - men who thought they were politicians and know very little about it. But they and every railway working man in the country would believe that it would be better for them that this political interference should absolutely die out. (Applause ) He did not say that they had got no political rights, they bed-and all citizens had political rights They were under a system hero of manhood suffrage, but it was not the way by discontent and disloyalty for any man to show himself a political subject, There was an Act of Parliament, and if that Act was not in accord with the wishes of the majority of the people, then agitate and agitate to get it altered in the Parliament of the country. But as long as in the man it was a fair and equitable Act for their rights and privileges, and as Rev M it had been a success tie who held it had been up to the presentation cling to it and take care lest in its amending they did away with their own privileges Personally he Simply administered the department in his political function J'rolnbly the Minister had a great deal of influence, but at the same time he might Bay plainly to the public who had agitated on this question, that he considered that inside the annual vote of Parliament, and inside the direction of that Act of Parliament which gave the of commissioners certain rights, he had no right to ov errors the right of those individuals There was a principle true to the minds of every Englishman a principle which prevailed in the brutal ring where men fought each other with their lists-that was, "Give every man fair play " Do not look on this little spot or that little spot, but take a man in the whole of the administration of his duty, and if they believed he was a man of ability, judg mut, and honest and constellations in the discharge of his duty, then give that man fair play (Cheers) It was not an easy thing to go from one set of circumstances to another set of circumstances it was not easy to manage the transition stage from one kind of manure ment to another They were now going through the transition stage in the railway Romeo, and without any reflection on the past management he thought they would shortly have a permanent way, railway stock, and general management which would be superior to that in any other colony in Australia (Applause ) And recollect that, as far as he knew from inquiries he had made, that in the comfort of the passengers, in the safety of the public, the safe and the comfort of the railway employees were not for- gotten He believed that it had been thowishottho Railway Commissioners to do everything to make the men IIB comfortable as possible. They had provided a system of provident fund, by which they could so are in themselves unfair advantages and with certain alters one he ball void it would be such a fund, and on such a mi table liuos-iilino6t inequitable lines to the Government of the country-that it would be one of the greatest treasures which had been given to the Railway Department. Tsow as to the Government. The Government of the country could have no interest, excepting the betterment and the comfort of the railway system and the railway men Why should they take any action to set against them a large body of men in the country As far as they were concerned the executive when the time came for them for them to do their duty, even if they became unpopular they might take it for granted that they would face unpopularity in the discharge of that duty He was glad to be at the opening of the institute that night It ought to be a guarantee to the men that in the minds of the Commissioners there was something h ghost than their daily work They wanted to give the men some amusement some intellectual recreation, and they had created place to- keep some of the younger men away from the temptations of life It WItH O proud feeling to him to know that it had fallen to his duty to open that magnificent institution (Applause ) He could only hope that under that roof there would be a spirit of intense c real activity and of fair dealing and friendship with one's companions, and that the future of their railway service would be great and prosperous. (Applause ) Mr. run (who was received with applause said that they were much indebted to their venerable Premier for coming there so late at night, when he had such a burden of work on him as at present, and was still labouring under the disadvantages of the accident that occurred early last you i It was Mieei illy appropriate to his mind, seeing that Sir lloni v Parkes was practically the father of the Railway Act-an Act which he was sure would in years to come looked upon us one of the greatest Acts over passed in this colony He was also exceedingly glad that it had fallen to the lot of Mr McMillan to declare the institute open His name would go down the country. as one to whom the railway service was much indebted The Commissioners had had troublesome times, and it had been aiRily the fact, skill, and insight of Mr M Millan whit h 11 piloted ihoActsafely through up to the present, wheat could stand on its own legs and demonstrate to the country its worth this institute was unique in Australia. He was not aware that there was" any similar institution in the railway service on this side of the gb be, and he trusted, therefore, that it would be the starting point for similar institutions throughout the railway service of Australia. But now the question came what would the building do and how would those who used it show their appreciation for its j revision The Commissioners, when they first considered the question of asking the Government to give them the need story funds for building it thought that the best way to ensure its success-, would be practically to allow the in agement of it to fall into the hands of the men themselves (hear, hear) -(boy simply keeping a watch over it to assure that it was not diverted from the object for which it was first started they hoped that that system of measurement would be a great success under the committee now being formed, and up to now they were much indebted to Mr M's ochlon and the provisional committee for their great interest throughout the committee would etc good technical classes, and the Commissioners would take great interest in enabling these classes to be formed, in conjunction with the system the Commissioners would also adopt the plan of sending some of the promising young men-after doing; all that they could do here to the old country or America, which would enable a, man of ability to become as well educated in railway matters as in any part of the globe the library would be of great service to members in the outlying districts who were separated from the free libraries of the city, and in connection with the library, everyone in the service would always have to feel most thoroughly indebted to Mr Goodchap, the late Commissioner of Railways A testimonial wine got up to him by the will which, he was leaving the service, and he devoted the whole of that money (and also obtain d from the Government an equal grant to the purpose of forming this library. (Applause) And there were other ways in which this institute could be used as the starting point of much good inducement to thrift and saving much! emanate from there. It was no good men carrying good wages if they did not put a little on one side, so that the end of their day it might be passed in time lost without any anxiety as to how they should live I have had also had a handsome present ft on Mr Charles Cowper in the shape of the barrow and spade, used for the purpose of turning the first sod of the nut ways of New South Wales. It was in the permanent possession of the institution, and might one day be looked upon with the same interest as the old Rocket, the brat ioi-oinutive, was looked upon at the present time It might be interesting to them if he give them a few figures in connection with the growth and the tr elite of the railway tracing it up to thaldaywhn they had a staff of 12 two men in addition to the many others who were being employed by the railway contractors, and by those who were building rilling stick for the railways He found that in the first complete i year the railways of this colony in lSub earned 1)0,724 passengers, while in the year closing June, 1890, they carried 17.071 Mo passengers The tons of goods carried in the first year amounted to 2159 tons, and last year the amount was 3 788 'MO tons. The revenue in the coin minted to iÍJ.J8J, and last year the revenue was s 533 n8G The mileage increased from 23 miles in 18th to 2182 u idea now that was two years' (growth, but this year they were going on at a much greater pace than the railways had gone on before, although they had practically no increa on the mileage they fully anticipated, when they closed the year on June 30 next, that in railways and tramways there would be on mi re isn on the year of £250,000 thin bringing the total traffic for railways and tramways, and the tramways wire suburban railways, up to 9-11 (1),000 Mr M Millan had referred to the question of their belonging to a service different from that wine many of those in the room were accustomed to private railway service and thatwasonopmni the Commissioners were most wishful that every man should clearly realise They were all servants of the State It was a far more honourable service than to work for private employers but it they were in a far more honourable service that naturally onto! ed greater responsibility, and they must do all that they could to make the service better and greater than that which the private companies could carry through the bad hero none of the competition that they had in the old country to force them onward because if they did not go on they would find they had nothing to carry As they had not that to urge them on they must not rest content feeling that they had made some improvement, but they must move onward and onward, and try to make the service not only as Mr M'Millan Bind just now, the best service in Aut-tralttsia.butthoboBtBervicoiniho world-(ctiocrs) - and that could only be done by every man in disservice doing his best, and feeling that whatever was worth doing at all was worth doing well They all know how, even with the smallest part of a locomotive if it got out of order. how the whole machine was interrupted The most unimportant post should he filled efficiently and well, and every man mustaimntavoidingany complaints being nida it was within his power to avoid it. And if every officer and man who controlled others felt that a complaint against his branch was a complaint against him, and try to avoid it, that would 1 assist towards making I heard the best railways in the world (Cheers ; Then again, they had to keep in mind this great point that the railways of this colony were a most Important factor in the progress of the colony If the railways were in efficiently or ex- travagantly worked the country, as a whole suffered, credit they were worked witbgrentefficioncv and great economy then their trade would be carried on as well if not better than the trade carried on elsewhere, and enable them to compete with the trade outside the colony. If they were carried on efficiently the Commissioners would be able to reduce the rates an 1 improve the position of the staff, and if that was not done every man would suffer He would point out how exceptionally necessary it was that the railways of New South Wales should be worked efficiently and economically We, unfortunately, had railways with very heavy grades It was most costly to work the traffic, and they had a mountain Ima which was necessary to cross over They had grade of 1 in 10 and 1 in 40 As a matter of fact as against our sister colony of Victoria with grades of 1 inlOO There were 8 id miles of the grades in this colony as against 413 miles in Victoria of the same grades With a goods train a very powerful engine could only take 100 tons up a grade of 1 in 30 at a speed of eight miles an hour. The same engine would take a train of 300 tons at 12 miles on hour up a grade of 1 in 100, therefore they could see how heavily they were handicapped in regard to rates (Cheers ) Then they also had other difil cities Their names were long and carried goods at night, and practically they had to have a day and night staff, while in Victoria the lines were shut up at night almost, therefore it behoved them to do all they could to help the Commissioners in every way A J oar or two before the Commissioners took office the traffic was to some extent a tionary, and all the classification advances were stopped Justboforo the Commissioners took office they were released, and the Commissioners found that they were likely to got swamped altogether with expenses, and bring about a bad result, so they hold a meeting and practically decided to stop all classification advances as they were stopped before. The next day the Commissioners hold another meeting, and they felt how the stoppage of pay affected the men, and they determined to try if they could carry it through by making occur IIIICB in other directions They succeeded, and since they had taken office up to last month they had granted increases of pay to the amount of £110,000 per annum, and the classification advances for this year would not amount to another £25,000 So that they saw that by economy in many directions the staff had saved. £110,000, and another £25,000 the year, making a total of Jbldi.ODO, (Cheers) At (head of another 4 I worry when his term of office expired, the Commissioners bored to loallotolmk back with satisfaction at the establishment of that institute which would be a source of much good to the railway service and assist in making a higher and nobler standard in Ufo (Cheers Sir III NaT PAitki S, who was cheered on rising to speak, said his friend, Mr M'Millan, afforded him some relief when he gave the assurance that there were no angels in the railway ser- vice (Laughter ) He was by no means sure that he stated the plain fat He thought the history of railway communication had abundantly proved that, so far as they know the nature of angels, there had been many angels in the railway serv lee tiny knots The numerous instances where railway serv miles in different parts of the world, at the certain cost of their own lives, had prevented the disaster of a train full of pi opie (Cheers ) Surely the man who saw the peril to himself and took his post, and, without a quiver of (ho muscio, kept his post and fined the lives of many at the cost of his own, was as near to an angel as any thing they knew in the land (Cheers) li was not his intention to say much on the railway very ice The railway service of this country comprised 13 000 men, and he ventured to say generally what he had said in other places, he bore he could not be supposed to flatter, that certainly, on the whole, they were a most honourable body of men (Cheers ) for himself he wished to offer his acknowledgment of an old traveller on those lines for the uniform courtesy, the uniform kindly feeling which he had received at all times, without a single exception, from persons engaged in the railway service (Choirs) Persons might say that that it is so from the post he happened to occupy, but he had not alway son upied that ] extended he was rather late in rom lung that Inch station He served in the Parliament of the country 12 years before he thought of aspiring to line, though he had seen gentlemen who had had the desire of this aspiration rather early before they had been in Parliament 12 days (Laughter) So (hut in 12 years he had travelled as a person of no position He was then only feeling his way daughter) irving his wings, and as he always a held that he would never accept any adventitious aid, that he would never ask any favour in his political progress, it was necessary for him to make quite sure before he attempted to fly. One word as to the Act under which the railways were now worked It was only just to him-whether that carried with it self praise or censure- still in justice to himself he might say that the present Railway Act of this country was a conception of his own It was not a copy from the Acts of neighbouring colonies, because (he Act of this country extended to the traffic man in - niont alone, and it avoided vi hat he thought was a great mistake the embracing the policy of the construction of railways Under our laws that was still left where he thought it ought to be lift-to the responsible Minister of Public Yorks and the Railway Act simply extended to management It afforded him pleasure standing there that night to acknowledge the uniform courtesy and the assistance which their late Commissioner, Mr Goodchap, cordially gave to him whentl.itbillivaspassingthroughParlitiinent.

(Cheers.) He had no doubt the library would prove very useful, and if they would accept them he put pa sod sending them a small parcel of books himself (Cheers ) He thought he could render no greater service than assist the library of the railway servants of this country.
