A TEY ON. ???'?? To the Editor. — Sib, — The Courier has beon informed that the hon . W. H. Walsh is mentioned as a possible caudidate for the viicnnt seat of Bundanba. No doubt the Courier is rightly informed; but who mentioned it ? It is cer tain that he would not have the ghost of a chance of winning tho sent ; it is equally cor tuin that his quondam political ' pals ' would be glad to Bee him resign his seat in the Upper Houso on the hopoless ohanco of obtaining one in the Lower-House. W. H. W. is too old a bird to be caught by ohaff, or I am— Mistaken.
