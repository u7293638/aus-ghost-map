THE EVOLUTION OF AMERICAN PRINTING. A CHAT WITH AN EXPERT. At the end of an hour's chat the other afternoon with Mr T. L De Vrano, I felt (writes a Daily Ch onielt interviewer) that I had a new key to the study of our American cousins. In a series of crisp personal reminiscences he had been telling roowbataniountcd to an intimate history of the evolution of contemporary American printing Nobody could do that better than the popular head of the well-known Do Vinno Press of New York, which prints the Century and the publications of the Grohoi Club, v he has been taking a little European vacation " How far back do your recollections of American printing go on"' I asked Mr De Vienne, by way of stars To 1835, when, as a boy, I visited the now great house of Harpers, along with my father He and James Harper were intimate friends There wasn't the ghost of an idea then that I was to be in print Indeed, I had been educated to be something altogether mightier, you know-a journalist, in fact But James Harper patted me on the head, and gave me a a copy of The Life and Adventures of Captain John Smith, and nothing would satisfy but I TI auld be a printer This I merely mention because I almost ment, if I am to tell you what American printing, illustrated by the excellent example of Harpers, there was That house, now the largest publishing establishment in America, was then chiefly occupied in printing, and they did all their work on a dozen hand-presses " " Something of a contrast between the quantity of American printing then and now " Yes, indeed Harpers didn't have enough now books to keep them going, and so they set to and printed old ones, their Family Library,' for instance If a bookseller in some part of the country would take a certain number of volumes of a book they would put his imprint on it That shows how hard a push it was with printers and publishers in those pioneer days, nr I may almost add them What gave Harpers the first elected bound up and was the printing of Harper's' Illustrated Bible,' which did so well. The history of the appearance of that Bible is interesting There was in New York in uncommonly good engraver culled Joseph A Adams To fill up his too many spare hours -he didn't had too much work going-he oon coined the idea of making pictures to illustrate the Bible No doubt he thought they might be useful some day, and he found his expectation realised " "In the notion for ' Harper's Illustrated Bible' " "Prccuelj He convinced Harpers that such a Bible must have a large sale He stipulated that the printing of it should be under his supervision, that not a page should be passed until he approved it He dog eloped a new style of preparing overlays for cuts, the style which is used to-day) He. put time and pains in 1 ability all into his work, and Harpers were horrified at the time he said tale They called it waste of time but he fell back on his contract and had his way Of course, when they saw the results, Harpers forgot the expense, and were much pleased And that was the beginning of the perfectness with which the production of illustrations is done in America " " By general consent the supremacy of America in that department is, I take it, admitted, but how did this incident lay the views of it I " " Simply by establishing this-that if pictures are to be well produced there must be no limit of came to the workers A man must be regarded as an artist in his work, not merely a mechanic, and the expense involved in allowing him to do his best fairly faced It is not enough for a man to be a good printer, a good engraver, if he is not allowed the time which the best possible work demands On the (Century magazine we allow men two and the 3 days for the making ready of a single forme You can take shot costs, only you don't get the same reward American people like good pictures, are quick to notice they falling off in them, and don't hesitate to write and scold about it " " Have European influences much affected the evolution of American printing, including illustrations f" " Within the past 15 years or so France and Germany have had an influence on us in setting styles Continental typoeniphcra, < owing to us to work and so influencing ItS, TWO have never had No American printing belongs substantially to the Anglo-Saxon, to ourselves, coupled with the individual influence of typographers England gas. e us John AVmdt was one Englishman, and Onto was another, and probably there were one or two more, all many years ago, of course " " America has revolutionised printing in another direction besides the beautiful production of cats, has she not " I " You mean I rmtinLt on dry paper up to 40 years ago all printing was done on vy et pape, need no printer thought it possible to print on dry paper About that tune-1843 to 1810 Gooroo P Gordon, of Now lord, invented a little machine for doing job printing-treidle presses they were called They were made chiefly to post cards, and it was found that when you used smooth polished paper you could print dry This beginning of dry printing got another step when some job printers made use of cylinder presses for pain pilots If a pamphlet was needed in a hurry, to print by the dry process saved much time and, moreover, it soon became apparent that dry print- ing on smooth paper was best Particularly it was found that cuts could be printed with a clearness not obtainable with wet paper Naturally, if there was a saving of three there was also a saving of expense, no the dry process had a number of advantages In a word, that is the story of dry printing now so much evil in America and from it Tugli li readers of American books and magazines will understand why smooth paper is used " I suppose the thin hairline type clmraotonstio of both American and English printing was primarily intended to suit wet printing " " Quite so A thin hairline would come out more fully, to blacker on paper that had been wetted Dry printing naturally I whittles the barriers down and so dry printing is to have a great effect in reorganising type William Morris is paving the way for a return to bolder lined type the hairline I think, must go out in reason and sense it ought to be founders at the beginning of this century got Emulous of the beautiful effects produced by thin lines in copper plate and lithography Hence, first of all, the hairline type Now we are making backward to the simplicity and common sense of the early printers As to the bad effect of hairline on the eyes of the renders, there can't be a doubt Take a book printed in hairline type, and another in a type of oven lines and see how much farther away from your eyes you can read the latter than the former I take it that the test of the best style of type is when you never notice it at all, but think only of what the author says to you through it " Speaking from your experience, do you think a real knowledge of printing is a distinct acquisition to men who afterwards write ?" "'1 veeedingly useful, I should BRy Horace Greeley whose manuscript I have often put into print, waste of half a dozen men who could be solution, to a hair a breadth, prepare copy for the press ' let up my cop) as I write it he used to say and I never want to see a proof ' He wrote a crabbed hand, but he had the great merit of being perfectly systematic in his contractions, and particular in his punctuation, and once a compositor got the key to him there was no sort of difficulty When a man goes through a printing office he gets to know just how manuscript ought to be prepared Not long ago we set up the biography of Garnst n, by Wendell Phillips Garrison, his son Young Garrison had received an education in type as well as at Harvard and when the proofs came back there was hardly on alteration to make " You have been making an examination of English printing and English printing appl JL. ces, and so I ask, ' Have you any comparison tTmako between them and what you have across the water F'" "Well, in America, while we paint pictures better, I don't think we print type so well as we used to do. The reason is, I suspect, that, I having a heavy expense for pictures, there is a certain end favour to bounce it by saving on the letterpress Good printing moans strength in the printing presses, you can't have good printing otherwise I think a want of strength is most characteristic of Continental printing machines, and I think also that there is more strength in American machines than in English ones In other words, although English printing-press is also well made I think ours are better From the American point of view at least there is strong testimony to this in the fact that, while a large saving could be made an imported English presses, they never fire on ported I " Comparisons are odious," and to Mr. De Vmne's intense relief for ho tbu_l,7hlÂ£w good to him during his visit-I didn't carry it any farther I carry on,
