I have rouented him for the occasion, although I aun sensible he makes but a poor vehicle for the trans mission of ghostly thoughts and idens. Still, as it was necessary to materialise myself for this occasion, and he happened to be to let, I closed with him at once, on the condition \- that he should have a vacation in space until midnight.
