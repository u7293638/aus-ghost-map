This formidable complaint wo old hinder her from returning with Bill Holloy. 'But she'll oome,' wrote Bcse, ' as soon as ever she's able. And that won't be afore Friday, anyway, if she oven it at all.' Thelut olapse steuek her as giving an effective completeness to the composition, .and she read it over with a oomplaoenoy whioh did not take Into account how it might be spelled oat in the bleak little hillside cabin of! away at Loughdromesk. The evening of the some arrived in dne loourae, and with 4t a flatter of snow, twirling on rough and unruly blasts. Silver-white threads and stitches had begun to embroider the pnrple folds of Slieve Glasarna before the mists descended mofl ling and blurring; and the paths ornnahad crisply nnder brognea, and made oold dutches at bare feet by the time that the neighbours were approaching Barney Mason's door. They remarked to one another that it was hardy weather, and added that they were<opt tohaveit severe, whioh is some degrees worse than hardy. Few people, however, had been daunted into staying at home, and there was much shaking of powder flakes out of shawl-folds tnd off rough oost-aleeves at the entranoe to Barney's dnatily.fliokering room. 'When Rose and Kb** and Bridget got there, -whioh they did as .jon as ever they epnld finish' reading up' after tea, most of the eompany had assembled, and flapping was about to begin. Bose's temper was somewhat rnffisd beoauae Peter O'Donoghne I had not kept his promise of coming to esoort (her. Bnt his sisters now hastened to explain i how he had been delayed by the sudden | iUoees of their calf. 1 How&neer;, the baste was coming round finely when they left,' they reported, and Peter would be after them in no time. So his fiancfe was appeased, and oontented herself provision ally with Iaixy Unllivan for a partner. 'Calx, now, it's only an odd torn the rest of ns boys gets wid yon these times,' he said to her gallantly, as the fiddler struck up. . Ne'er a ohanoe we have at all, unless when the laok keeps him that's luckier away.' Do not suppose that the surrpe danoed jigs. Later on in the evening a oouple might stand np and perform one while the others were recovering their breath; bat at the outset it was a vigorous round danoe tkat began to gyrate with a stej> whioh, though perhaps not reoognised in any apadsmy, kept time to Hugh's mnsio with muoh accuracy, and made light of the difficulties opposed by an uneven mad floor. The crockery on the dresser jingled merrily to the rhythmioal beat of their feet, and eaoh pair ot bobbing heads that passed in bout of it might be seen to make an abrupt dip down and np again. This was caused by an nnnsnally deep hollow whioh occurred in that part ef the floor, and Barney Mahon, looking on with the elders from their circle round the hearth, observed it, and said, 1 Begob, I must see to having that houle filled up before next time, or else somebody 'ill be tripping up in it, and getting a quare toss.' The other spectators sat well content with their share of the entertainment, Pun gently-pnlBng outtie pipes solaoed the men, and the women kept their knitting needles twinkling: in faot, they would almost as soon have left off breathing by way of rest and relaxation. For further amusement they had the affairs of the country-side to discuss, enlivened with an occasional anecdote or riddle- Dan Q-oligher bad just propounded one of the latter, whioh suooess* fuliy puzzled everybody who had not heard it before 1 A. brown lough Wid a white stand, Bona the ship could sail round It, But I ooold hold it in me .hand'; ancl he was triumphantly explaining,' Sure, a onp of when two people game batting in at the door, whioh they birth with began to secure behind them, as eagerly as if they were shutting out some deadly peril. They sUd nothing, bnt their speechless hurry was mors suggestive than words* ' Whethsn now, Peter O'Donoghne and Ned Kinsella, what's took you at all to be flonnoing in on the people that a-wayf' tald Barney Mahon, somewhat affronted at their nnoaremonious entranoe end dealings Willi his fastenings and furniture. ' That's a great oold slamming of the door you have -and what for would ye be jamming the benoh again it, unless you're intending the next body tkat oemes through it to be breaking his shins V ' Troth, I only hope it may-and its aeok, teo-between ns and harm-if if* offering to come in on us-I do so,' said Peter O'Donoghne, panting. He left his comrade to finish barricading the door, and pashsd himself farther into the room, until several groups inteipeeid between him and the aagerous point. ' After us it may be this minyit of time,' he said. 'Ooh, but that m the quare fright I got-"the saints look down upon ns this night.' * It's herself below at the onld gate to night/ said Nbd KinssUa, who was oalmer than Peter, though evidently mush alarmed. ' And morebstoken it's .not inside she is this night, bat sitting orouohed up on the bank be the path- And the grab she made at Four going1 by; indeed, I theoght he'd never get his ooat tail wrenched out of her oold hand.' j .It might as well havs been caught in a ] rat trap the way die held on,' said Peter. . I give you me word, me hair's standing on ' sua vet, fit to rise ms hat off the root of me ' head, what wid that and the ounathural sareeohes she let-I wonder you didn't hear them here. And itfs my belief she set off legging after us-.goodness preserve ns! ouy I WM afraid of ae life to look round and see.' These tidings spread general consternation among the oompany, as, nnder the oironm staaoes, they well might do. For only a fs w hundred yards down the loaning lay an anoint burying ground, with its ruined chapel and weed entangled tombstones, a a piaoe whose ghostly reputation had long (Men established at XUlyaesn. In parti cular ihs wraith of a littls old woman was often to be seen of an evening peering out through the rusty gate bars, and sometimes stretching forth a fearsome hand to plaok at the unwary passer-by. But her appearanoe oat on the roadside was a new development, and one whioh made Peter and tfed's report unpleasant hearing for people who would presently be obliged to take that route home. The danoe came to a standstill, and in its stead a aeries of dismal ghost-stories began to drole round the room. Perhaps the most gruesome of them was Nick Oarol&n;'n. He related how he had onoe lived in a place where there was in the middle of the yard a deep well, out of whioh on oertsin moonlit nights a dark figure would emerge, and go gliding round and round it, making a wider and wider oirouit, until she reached the house, at whose door she rapped loudly as die passed by. And whenever that happened there would be a death in the family before the twelvemonth was out, as sue as tate. A general shudder followed this denouement, and old Mrs. binders made a particular application of it by remarking gloomily that it was a poor saas to have the likes of suohocathurs about; but Mrs Coleman, a oomely matron, who continued to sit by the fire unperturbed, said placidly, in a pause, ' Sorra a bit of harm there is in it this night, I'm a.thmkin*. If the lads seen a&ythin;', ifs apt to ha* just been some poor body after missing her way in the snow.* .Troth and bedsd, then it was the quare body altogether,' Peter asseverated, 'and tb hair of the head, as I was telling joa, bridling straight wid the dhre&i; of bet the first minyit I oome nigh tba place.' ' Ali, BOM, some people's as ready at that as a dog At cooking his ears,' said Joey Nolan. ' Maybe we'd a right to sco look is there e'er a one in it. Some orathur might be straying about perishing, and it snowing again aR thiok as sheep's wool.' ' Begor, yon won't persuade me to go fooling siong wid yon,' said Pater; 'I couldn't be getting me heels out of it fast enough. May the saints have me sowl, but I thought I'd lose me life afore ever I landed inside-and here I'll stop. Nobody need be axin' me, for divil a fat I'll stir.' * Good people are scaroe,' Joe observed, sarcastically; bat Peter went on in a helf complaocnt tone ; ' One while it '11 be afore I'm the better of that frightening I sot. Every mortal bit of me in a thrimble wid it yet.' ' Musha then, yon gaby, oau'tyou whisht about it, instead of to bo telling everybody the sort of ould polthroou you are ?' Bose Uasey whispered to him fiercely, _ ready to cry with mortification as she saw significant smiles passing round at the expense of her happily nnconscions betrothed. As she spoke the door resounded with a heavy thump, which made those who were standing next to it hop back with a scarcely dignitied haste. Some of them tried to carry it off by pretending that they were merely getting ont of one another's way, while some shrieked unfeignedly, and above all ejaculations rose Peter 0'Donoghue*fl voice, shrill with nndusembled terror, saying; 4 Oh, to goodness, don't open it for your llvoa. Bun that other form again it, you that are widin raioh. Mercy be among us, she's apt to have us all destroyed.' ' Arrah BOW, wiU you be letting as in ont of that, you jackasses, you?' shouted a voice reassuringly familiar and irate. It was young L&iry; Sullivan, who bad slipped out through the back door a few minutes before, and whose impatience at being kept waiting had nothing supernatural about it. Despite Peter's remonstrances, the door was thrown open, and disclosed Larry standing tali against a baok-ground of glimmering white, in a gloom whioh, when yon looked into it anywhere steadily, grew full of wandering flakes like scattered breadcrumbs. Beside him appeared a smaller figure, whom he pulled indoors along with him, before anybody well had time for terrific surmises, and whom the firelight showed to be a little old woman wrapped up in a powdered brown shawl. She was breathless and bewildered and forlorn-looking, as she peered round from face to face, all strange, all oomfortless -but no; for the moment Bridget Doran set eyes on her she sprang at her and caught ^ her in a great hug: ' Why, granny, darlint, ^ and is it yourself f she said. 'And how at all did you come this night in the snow f It's kilt you axe entirely. Ton oan't evei ha* oome wid ould Bill Molloy f , ' Ah, honey, I thramped it,' said old Mrs t Doran. ' Sure I couldn't rest aiiy thinking j me little Biddy was took that bad away all her lone among the strange people. But j finely you're looking, glory be to goodness. ( 'Deed, now me heart's been fit to break j fretting ever since I got the letter this j morning, saying that belike you wouldn't ^ over it. ' And I to be danoing round like a zany betwitohed, and you all the white streeling through the snow,' said Bridget, with aoute remorse. 'It's sorry I ami let anybody ^ send you such owla lies. ' But*-looking j indignantly at Bose-' I only said to say that I had a could.' ij 'And I lost me way in the dark,' went ( on Mrs Doran, plaintively,' and what at all I'd have done, ldunno, only for the daoint boy coming; for nought else the other two 'ad do bnt let yells at me, and run away like seared turkeys.' ' Creeping along under the high bank she was, the orathur, when I met her,' Larry meanwhile was telling the others, ' and scarce able to oontind wid the blasts of the | win'. And tei she to me : ' For tbe love of God just stop to tell me am I anywheres near the Casey's house*' And ees I to her: 'Is the Quarry Farm you're wanting?' and sec she to me,' Ay, ire where me poor Katey's little daughter, Bridget Doran is in service, and dying wid some manner of out landish siokness; it is to her i am going,' | set she. Bo see 1 to her,1 If it was Bridget Doran she was wanting, I'd seen the girl three minyits ago, and ne'er a sign of dying on her whatsomever,' and £ just brought I"" along here. It is perished and stupid the orathur is wid the oould. You'd a right to get her a oup of hot tay, and a warm at the fire,' oonoladed Larry, there upon bestirring himseli to superintend the carrying out of this prescription. And a little later he prompted his mother to offer Mrs Doran a night's lodgings at their home close by, thus entailing upon themselves more hospitality than they bad foreseen. For of the Some at Mahsn's all's well that «""*? well could not quite be said, as some of the guests were disposed to say prematurely when the assembly was bresk ng op. to begin with, old Mrs Doran had caught a very bad ohill during her snowy wanderings, and now had a severe illness whioh endangered her life, and obliged Bridget to pay many an - anxious and oonsoienoe-stnoken hour as a fee for her deoeptive letter, while a difference whioh she had next morning with Bose Oasey about the unauthorised mendacity of its oontents led to a permanent cooling down of their friendship. Moreover, Bose, on the very same day, spoke in suoh scathing terms to Peter O'Donoghue with reference to fail panio on the night before, that even his impenetrable self-satisfaction was touehed, and a violent falling ont ensued. The oonsequeueo was that no wedding took place at Shrovetide; and the last time I had news from KiUymeen ' there was no talk of it at all,' so the breach may be con sidered final. In fact, it is commonly sup* posed that he has some notionof transferring his attentions to Bridget Doran. But I happen to know that the only one among the boys she of is Larry Sullivan, whom she always remembers gratefully as the rescuer of her grandmother. Whereas, if Larry fancies anyone, it is Kate Duffy, Whenoe it appoars that some rather com plicated oross-ourrents in the stream of life flowing through Eillymeen have started from this Surree at Mason's.
