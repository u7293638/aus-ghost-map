A SHOCKING SPECTACLE. A Bull V. Lion Fight. THE good people of Roubaix, in the north of Prance, celebrated National Fete day recently in a peculiarly atrocious manner. The programme of amusements included a round of bull fighting, and " a grand wind up" in the shape of an encounter between a hugo lion, " Goliath," and a Spanish bull, tho contestants being put to gether in a large case. Tho result was most disappointing to tho specta tors, for Goliath, born and reared in captivity, proved a cowardly brute. Ho " roared splendidly," but the shouts of the blocdthiraty rpectatorsand mad rush of the goaded bull cowed him completely. The first encounter was decisive. "The bull gored the lion's Hank terribly, and in the madness of pain Goliath bit off tho bull's ear. But that was his only attempt at re prisals, for next moment he was rolling on tho ground, bleeding profusely and groaning with agony. Meanwhile the bull stood with ready head waiting tho j jion'a next move. When it crime it was a desperate attempt to get any where out of tho range of tlie toro's terrible horns. To do so, Goliath tried to climb the bars of ths cage, and as he rose the bnll charged driving his horns into tho hapless lion's mouth. Tho wounded brute bit savagely on tho horn and scored tho buil'o thick neck with a blow of his paw, but it was a last effori, for as the bull draw off for another charge Goliath rolled over in the last throes. In vain did ?? the Chulos try to irritate tho poor ' beast into a final effort; in vain '.hey tried to make the bull charge once again. He would not louch tho inert tawny mass, and Leo gave up the ghost whilst l-i.CCO presumably civi j rlzed beings cheered tho victor, and ( beared maledictions an the vanquished offered to put one at his lions against two of Mszzantini's best Spanish bulls. Tha toreador, on his side, rays he wiil march one toro against two lions or tigers for Â£10CD.
