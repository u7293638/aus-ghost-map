From the ouriesy with which my father treated itr. liiack i saw that lie evidently liked liim very much. This pe?i'»lesed me, as I thought I had never, in all my life, met any one so strangely repulsive, and it was with much dis pleasure that, I. "heard my father ureing jiim to come often to s< e ns.

Ah, that hour' 1 can 1 never forget it. The man wove ;i con i ii:ual smile, which seemed io hide some- ! thing terrible behind it, and his little : black eyes flittered, J tried Io avoid 1 looking at him, but was ?o>m conscious of a strange fascination which kept my eyes fastened on him. 1 felt as if I mast ! obey him. and rav father seemed equally fascinated ; for he hung on every word »he strange man uttered.

At times 1 would make an almost super human . iici'i to remove mv eyes iron*. .s fae;\ and ilieii some horrible ]i"'Vv'r slowly drew tiiCHi buck. Dut at last the meal was ended, and I escaped to iay ixiif.n. Ninny. usy old nurse, was waiting for me there, a.id as L entered, she ex claimed : " Law, Miss Addie,w3i ai do matter wiu v<;ii. chile V \ou look as dough you done seen a ghost.7 '"Oil, Nanny," T said.

Nanny's opinion convinced me that there really was something fearful about Mr. lilaek. A liamoless terror took possession of me. and though 1 tried to shake oil" the feeling, gloom pervaded everything. lie continued to come frequently to the house, and 1 was often, at my fathers request, compelled to see him ; but 1 never did so without feeling conscious that I was entirely subject to his will. One day jny father sent for me io oome to the library. The summons I used to obey so gladly filled me with dread, and 1 entered with fear and trembling- I noticed that he seemed troubled, and k struck me forcibly how changed lie was. He looked p ile and haggard, and had lost his old easy, good-natured address. He. tried io avoid looking at me. and it was in a sharp, m rvous manner that he com municated his '?'news."

Presently we stopped before a large j building, which we all entered, ilr. j JUack and my faiber leading me in. Wo i were met by a kiml-looking old gentle- ! man who glanced pityingly at me. They i helu short whispered conversation, and i then 1 heard him say, " Tooba.l, too bad! And so young ? 1 saw mv faiher pieparing to leave without me.'

No one can k-ow the agony of that moment, for I felt how fulile would be all iny eii'oiis to coiivip.ee. any one that 1 was sane, i was shorn of all my beautiful hair, of which I was so proud, and left to follow my own inclination. I made two or throe unsuccessful attempts to convince the phy sicians of my sanity, then give up the idea as useless. I spent uiy timo in painting, for which I had some talent, and before long had completed a portrait of my father. He called once or twice to see me, but always in company with Black, who put me im mediatdiy under the spell that lasted till they were gone, 'i'^us it was decided that their visits aggravated my easc and i was debarred from seeing them any more. Sly only hope now was to eseapc. How closely 1 watched every opportunity! But weeks and months p:issed away lie fore J. could carry out my purpose. Then, one night, I heard a cry of fire. J sprang from my bed and hastily dressed, but not before 1 was nearly ehoked with smoke. The guards were rushing through the halls, wild with excitement, opening the doors and begging the poor mad crea tures to co!no forth : b it many were so paralysed with fright that they stubbornly refused, and numbers perished in the flames. I needed no urging, but, seezing jdv father's portrait, ran through the open door, unmolested. Every place was open. Even the heavy gi.es in the yard J formed no barrier now. as the firemen h:;d torn them away, and I passed through un5 noticed. I ran till 1 was out of breath. It then llasiied across me that: my appearance (for 1 was without list or cloak) in tlie streets of ®_»:>m*oil at midnight- would at the very least excite su>p;cion. I stood still and gazed about me, puzzled what to do or where to go. I knew that 1 must act <juickly. as, if seen, I was in great danger of being arrested. Sly brain was in a whirl. 1 imagined I saw pursuers on every hand. Some dis tance ahead of me i spied a church. .All, there was a refuge! i would Jiod a hiding place there till morning.
