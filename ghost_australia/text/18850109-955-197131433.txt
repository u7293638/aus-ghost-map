ORDINATION AT CHRIST CHURCH PRO-CATHEDRAL. An ordination was held at Christ Church Pro-Cathedral by the Bishop of Ballarat on Sunday morning, the 21st ult. The candidate pre sented was Mr. Eeginald Hayman, of Moore College, who was admitted to the diaconate, and will soon commence work under, the Rev. C. G. Allanby in the Wimmera district. There was a very large congregation present, and the proceedings throughout were of a most impressive character. The Ven. Churchill Julius, Archdeacon of Ballarat, was selected to preach the sermon, and chose tor ms text; the words of St. John the Baptist— ' I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness.' He commenced by giving a vivid description of the corrupt state of the world before John appeared, the absence of all real religion, the general dissolution of society, the decay of all moral ties, the gloom and hopelessness that seemed settling down on all classes. He spoke of St. John as a prepared instrument for bringing light into this darkness and for heralding the adventof the Christ, and from an examination of St. John's qualifications for such a work, he explained the needs of a clergyman of the present day. These were— the gift of the Holy Ghost, a special training and preparation, warm sympathies, a deep knowledge of the Scriptures, nature, and the human heart, a divine calling to the work, and self-forgetfulness. He concluded by giving kind and manly advice. tp. the. candidate, and earnestly besought the hearty prayers oil' the congregation on'his behalf. ? .'
