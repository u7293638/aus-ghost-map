'I must bide my Hue, and watch my chance. It will come; Hon, if 1 am ready. The pale-faced young Hrl with her baby-faoe shall not crowd out By young mistress from her rightful Qohition Ms Lady of Chctwynd. I will destroy her Hs 1 would au insect.' B She shook her linnd in ficreo menacing ht ?the objeet of her hatred, and then, growing ?mindful of her own safety, and not wishing Bin rink an encounter with Gilbort-. Monk, alio V darted down the outside stairense, and was [ away in thoBhndow of the trees slmost with_ I the rapidity of thought. She concealed herself in a secure position at a little distance, at a point commanding a view of the door of the chalet. Hcrescape whs immediately discovered, and Monk said: ' You are safe now with me, Bernioe. 11a gee has hurried home, I am positive. She would not dare risk a meeting.with me. You are pale and worn out. Lot me take you from this place ns soon as possible, Flack has been staying in the neighborhood since ho brought me the news of your departure from Jlawr Castle, lind 1 found him in tbo edge of the park ns I went back to tbo house. 1 sent him to Chetwynd-hy Sea for a carriago and he will drive you over to Eastbourne directly. He is tc be iu waiting nt the lower gate of the park, nearest the village. Heroareyour clothes. It would be woll to lay aside thoBe wet garments ns Boon aB possible. Bernice assented, and Monk went outside iuu uuiuei anu ciosea me cionr. loung Early OLctwynd secured it on its inner side, ngaiii barricaded the door at the foot of the stair, and changed her wet garments for dry ones ns rapidly ns the swollen and painful state of her sprained wrist would allow. She. was soon warmly clothed. She rolled up her damp garments nud packed them info , her travelling bag. Her white silk robe, which had so ably served in her nppearaneo as a spectre, was unite dry. Bhe examined it carefully. It had been gathered up about her waist when she had fallen into the lako nnd was not torn nor damaged. She rolled up the robe nnd thrust it into her trBvelling-bng, She was attired in her bronze grey cashmere robe nnd jacket, and it only now remained to put on her lint, while sho was thus completing their attire, Monk c^ame in, put out thu remaining fire, scattering the embers on the hearth, and extinguished thu light of the lantern, which he restored to the closet from which lie had withdrawn it. Then lie 'arranged the furni ture which Bernice had piled up in the form of a barricade, in its usual order, and con Ylucted young Lady Chetwynd out of the chalet. They halted outside while he locked the door, nnd Bernice then placed her arm in his, and they moved on nmong the shadows, keeping a vigilant and apprehensive look out around them. They wound along the narrow and dusky paths, avoiding tlio wider moonlight avenues, and once of twice they halted at some rustic sent, that Bernice might rest. But at last they approached the lower end of ? the park, and the small gate leading out upon the open high 'T always carry a key to this gate,' said Monk, producing the key in ipiestion from his pocket. ' I generally cross the park when I go to the villnge. Here we nro, and me uy ig waiting.' black was on the box, whip in linnd. Ho raised his hat to the young lady anil to his master. ' Monk assisted Ilornica into the vehicle. He hesitated about neconipntiying her to bastbournc. lie feared lrst lie should be missed from the I'ark, and ho had another vask to do on this night— a task which lie dreaded, but deemed necessary lotlio success of his plnns, and even to his own well, ?wing. But he dared not run any risk of ? loifh-g Bernice ngain. To plnco her safely 'i tbo-, bands of Mrs. Crowl was the first and njest important movement, to tie made. Lponhis safe custody of Bernice all his plans hinged. He decided, therefore, to accompany Jier to E stbournc. 'To MrsJyHJrowl's ludgings, Flack,' ho ordered, in njalow voice witli n piercing glance nroundBiim. ' And be lively. We've in long drive ?Rieforo us, and I have othir busintss.Kidmand to-night.' He sprang lightly into the vehicle and jOBed the door. The fly rolled hravily j. along the iond on Us way to Enstboitruo by Chetwynd-by-Sca. It was not yet out of sight, when the withered, dusky, witch-liko fitoo of tho old Hindoo woruan was pressed against the spears of tlio gate, and the bead like eyes glittered ns Rigee silently raut ?tcred : . ?

I Meanwhile the nntiqimted fly and its oc cupants wore procaedmg Bwiftly along the road to Chetwynd-by-Sen. l'hoy entered Eastbourne after a brisk drive, and Flack drove into the retired street in which Mrs. Growl had tnkon lodgings.

Monk walked briskly down the hill and into the silent village. He turned into the lonely church-yard among the graves, whoso tall While headstones screened him from tlio possible view of any watcher; al though tho moonlight was still brilliant. , lie crept i nto the little shaded stone porch, and let himself into the ehurOh. It was then, about two o/cloek in'tlie morning.' ; It was past four, and the gray dawn was, breaking, when -lie emerged from ihb ehurcli, wearied and worn and pale. Jlonk vent on through the village nnd as cended the hill beyond. At the lower gnto of the Park ho halted' and let himself in, and hurried along the more obscure paths toward, tho house. Tlio old Hindoo woman liad watched - and waited for him all these hours. She saw ltini entor the park, and ono glance at him as; surcd her that his ' other business ' .had been accomplished.; She arose from her crouching position and followed him stenlthily libufS'wnrd. '' ' I've made a. failure of it, after all,' the old woman muttered. J' His busiuess lay in the village. It concerned my lady in some way. But what was it ? I'd liko to.know. Gilbert Jlonk's schemes, but tlicy aU'hinge on that girl. Ho means to iireserve her life ; I mean to destroy it.' Which will, win I' ^ . Tho kitchen-maids were astir, and old liagco, watching her opportunity, ex perienced no dilliculty in slipping into the house unseen, at th'o servants' entrance. Siie glided up to tho apartments of her niislrhss, whom she found sleeping. She passed on to her own room and changed her garments, and flung herself on her bed, ? drooping asleep. It was somewhere about eight o'clock when Jliss Jlonk's bell summoned her. She was a light sleeper, awakening nt a sound or; touch, and now started up broad awake upon the instant. She fulded her turban afresh, and hastened to the bed-chamber of her mis tress. - Jliss Monk wn3 in bed, ber head lying back upon her pillows, a fretful' expres- sion on her swartliy face, tilie was an noyed and curious, and she exclaimed petu lantly : ' Why iliil you not sleep in my room Inst night us usual, Biigoe ? Why where you not here to undress me ? I kept awake till ucnr morning from sheer terror. I 'cannot be alone, and you know it.' Itageo nt onco told her mistress the story of her adventures during tins night, Miss' Monk listened in breathless eager ness. ' Gilbert is the bead and front of this up pnrition business,' said Sylvia at length, ' And yet why should he wish to riiin rae? He rescued her from her tomb. It's all plain to me now. And he has some object in defending her. But what enn it be? .He did not love her.' 'I can see into tho mystery,' snid the. old Hindoo woman, her dusky face lighting. ' The truth is ho has discovered who she 'is. You know, Missy, she did hot know her parentage. Gilbert has found out the secret. Sho is of noblo blood ; one can tell that by her haughty air, her patrician beauty, her high breeding. Sho looks like a '.princess, at tho least. I can see Gilbert's game now. lie means to allow you to marry my lord, and he will then restore my lady to her own friends and relatives, and feather his own nest.' - 'But what would then becomo of me? I Bhould be no wife. I should bo set adrift — *' 'Yes, Missy. But perhaps Jlr. Gilbert would hot permit things to go so far. Per haps he will not allow you to marry my lord. Gilbert is a selfish fellow and means to look out for himself, and lie won't care what becomes of you. I think lie brought my lady here to play ghost. I think he means to exnet a good price from my lord nnd from Lady Ohnty wud's relatives, and ttien restore her to them as one from tho dead.' Miss Monk looked terrified. 'What 'ahull Ave do?' .she whispered. 'What shall we do, Itageo.?' ' L' avo it all to me. Wo must not sufler Gilbett to suspect how much wc know of his plans. I will outwit iiira nnd destroy tlie girl. Leave it to me, I say. My lady is at ' Mrs. Growl's lodgings,' at' Eastbourne, You must seiTTl me to Eastbourne to-day, Missy, to match some of your embroideries or trimmings, or something.' ' But he will not keep hernt. Eastbourno, where sho is known. Ho will tako. her to London, and conceal her thero until he is ready to diseloso the fact that- she lives,' 'Then I'll go to London, too,' said the Hindoo, with n resolute gleam in lier eyes, 'I'll be more that a match for him.' Jliss Monk put aside her chocolate, taking a -draught of stronger drink to ?'steady her nerves.' Then she allowed herself lo ho dressed in lier luxuriant Eastern stylo, and at nine o'clock was ready for breakfast. She bade Rageo, await' her return to her chamber, and descended to the breakfast room. -Lovd Chetwynd was already there, and GilhVft Monk followed her, immediately, looking somewhat haggard , and. , wearied.. Miss Jlonk was very amusing, with/a Any thing . I. can do for you in town, Sylvia ?','- inquired Monk, caielessly, as ho received his second cup of coileu at the hands of. tho waiter.- 'Have you any coiumiinds for jowellor, dressmaker, boot maker or milliner ? I Bball bo pleased to execute any. wish you may entertain. I nm going up to' London to-night.' .'Ali, indeed I' snid Miss Monk.

' A day or so— possibly n week. v -Scotsby & Newman expect' me, and : business -is bust, liess, you know.' .
