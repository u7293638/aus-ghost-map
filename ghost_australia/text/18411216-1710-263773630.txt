But these means will not, after all, prevent, tho' <hej> ma^y lessen the very serious loss sustained by insects. It*'is the practise in somfe countries to make subterraneous granaries, soured, from air, wet' and damp which are filled up and hermetically sealed. In this way grain is said to be, secured for many yearsj by'exclusion from air, and to relain its 1 vegetative" powers far longer than credible. 1 'The 'reputed usefulness of these depositories would warrant their geneial adoption, and it is a subject of which more hereafter.

The loss pi^taiaed^hy insects in warm climates is ,beyond conception ; and loudly calls for the attention' of farmers to use every means to pf6yent it. The writer"has seen samples of wheat atitacked by weevilsjamwliidi ihere could no t la a ve Ja^en 'Jess <than one rthirdof-its. m^ #Btroy^ famthd , of a W^les ( insec4? ^ tlatfafofga ^ side antennce, and two middle ones •which rise upwards, and are reflected towards the forehead. From the mouth there is a. long proboscis rolled up at the point; there are three pair of legs, the front pair shortest, the hinder pair, has one or two branches, and the middle pair one ; the neck is of a brown colour, and the body, from the insertion of the wings downwards, is of whitish yellow having about six rings. How or when its~eggs are deposited the writer has not been able to ascertain ; but conjectures they mast be laid on the young grains in the field. They are however insinuated into the* heart of the grain in some way, and' in . due time becoms small white maggots, with a brown head ; from this stage they become ye'low brown cnry^tsj^^^iiim-'due course, when the rounds of ?i4tiiie have been completed they eat out of the grain and fly oat the perfect moths above described.- They have been supposed to die off on the approach of cold weather: but this is wrong; the writer has observed them in November, in all their different forms, both in wheat and maize. The weevil is a small black beetle, slightly bronzed, about the eighth of an inch long in the body, which is fiddle "shaped, having joint.about the middle, and a strong scale before and behind the joint. It has three pair of jointed legs ; the. head is very small, and has two small eyes looking upwards ; the proboscis is long and rigid and has two antennoe inserted to its base. It is said jiot to be very abundant in Great Britain the cold destroying. it. In these colo-* nies it.has been particularly destructive. How it is propagated, or what its duration does not appear to be well known Every person acquainted with growing and preserving wheat knows it too welJ: but jsuch have generally desired only to destroy it ? without taking further trouble to study its habits. An intelligent gentlemen, who had the care of large -quantities of grain, in store in" Sydney for years, is of opinion that it is rather long-lived-; and With this vievv he has had all that were screened out of. the wheat always destroyed ; and lie white- ' washes the walls to stop up all the crevices where they could lodge. It is the ' opinion of the writer that they are bred in the. grain, as he knew a quantity of wheat at a farm, on the Hunter, very much injured one year where weevils had never before observed, though wheat had been grown for several years on the same farm. ' Further observations on the preservation of grain in underground granaries . win appear in our next number. GAMMON.—In the truth of the following received from a correspondent we do not -believe;—-ourreaders will use .their own judgement. ^ A party of Carpentaria blacks have brought- an , express from his Excellency, relative to certain wonders which he has discovered during his long absence from the seat of government, and the suspension of its functions. It was necessary to visit the oiitports of the interior, in order to meditate on the exports and imports. Not many thousand miles beyond the Iiufus, he discovered a river, wilh * a dirty brownish yellow stream,' which runs. , only during the dry season, and ceases ^after rain.. A stfong anomaly this may .be thought: but not so in reality; for the philosophers, can satisfactorily explain it! In hot, windy, dusty weather, it is evident there will be dust: and the dust must iall somewhere. Well; the dust falls (as rain would) collects in puddles, which drain into small streams, collect again into little creeks of flowing dhst' and sand/and eventually. into : a large river, wluch.pours its torrents mto the ^reat sandy dusty desert,ordry sea of the interior. Fish abound in v this, sand river, as well -as in the dry creeks' tributary thereto. 'ihe fish are" mostly dried herrings, baked lobsters, There is no fear of drowning in this ' river: to be smothered is the worst that could happen. The native blacks who inhabit the banks of this river are all skeletons: his Excellency saw but few ghosts, and those were black. Snuff is not in use among them, but they are up to it. Flour mills have notbeen erected on the river, because corn always grinds itself spontaneously. Water is considered poison, and is prohibited by law. Other particulars we could name: but the subject is so very dry that we drop it; especially as the Register is sure to publish a statistical report of the whole; from the dry bank down to genus cimex. The unrivalled poet of the Chronicle may render himself, herself, or itself immortal, by subliming the subject in a few rhymes. A correspondent suggests that some of the houses in Morphett-street ought to be extra high rated, on account of the inestimable value of vrater frontage on the Paddy river. We really cannot advise on the subject, and must refer him to: the official functionary. Perhaps there might be an opening for another surgeon or two in the neighbourhood. A few little boys on dark nights, might pick up an astonishing number of half-pence by carrying torches. FIRE.—On Tuesday night. about 9 o'clock, a fire took place in the dwelling house of Charles Whittle, stoned- merchant, at the Brown hill c?eek, which was instantly destroyed, together with the whole of the furniture &c.; It originated from a lighted candle being placed on a table near the window, a current of air bringing, the window curtains ifi contact with the flame. ; THE GOVERNOR. — His Excellency is expected to return from the Murray, in : a few days. DEATH BY DROWNING.—On Sunday last a man of the name of Lewis, a shoemaker, at the New Port, in company with two or three other persons went into the water to bathe, when Lewis getting beyond his depth, and being unable to swim, after 1 ui« lu svYiui, acvci^i several struggles I nd not having timely assistance, sunk j to rise no more. A subscription has been put on foot for the family of the unfortunate man. Why is Mr. Jones' hat like Charity ? Because it covers a multitude, &c.;, &c.; ATTACK BY THE NATIVES.—Information arrived here last night that, on Monday last Mr Kobinson's Station, to the north, waCs attacked by natives, and a shepherd's dog speared; and, yesterday, Mr Hope's sheep were all driven off, and the sh^^nls. chased to the hut. y After gettihg r assistance from Mr* GleesonV station the sheep were recovered to within one hundred and •fifty. Thei \natives speak good English, seeih determined, J and they threw thirteen spears at one man alone.—Adelaide Chronicle. • MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.—During v the governor's s^ay in Melbourne his invariable answer to all petitions addressep to him relative to the disgraceful state of the streets, the impracticability of the approaches to the wharf, and ali grievances of a similar description, was,—-"'I his is a matter for the consideration of your 3V1 unicipal Corporation." It is obvious therefore that in the way of reforms "of this description we |have but little to lookfor at the hands ofthe Government 5 and consequently that the' sooner we obtain a Municipal Corporation the bet- , ter. A M unicipaljCorporation was prof-,' fered to. the inhabitants of Sydney *so long ago as during ihe administration^ of Sir Richard' Bourke: but the inhabitants " very wisely rejected the boon" knowing that thetJdv the means and Were ac for thetown than the pqratipn possibly c6u to a very he ivy years ago the propositi snthaabeen doiiig'more Without reion " Two renewed. by Sir George Gjpps, wh|>~ actually introduced a Bill to the Legislative Council having this object; but the measure was again met with htrenuoUs opposition, and the Bill wafc finally withdrawn, though on the latter occasion there was infinitely less reason for the opposition thanbefoTe. But howevei'much it may be the interest of the Sydney folks, who have still some remnants of convict labor left, to oppose the introduction of Municipal Corporations, the rteverse is obviously our best policy ; and we may rest assured that while we profess ourselves anxiously desirous to co-operate with his Excellency in the endeavour to secure a Municipal Corporation, we are arming ourselves with an unanswerable argument why our streets should be kept in a thorough repair until we obtain the boon we ask. — Port Phillip Patriot, November 1.
