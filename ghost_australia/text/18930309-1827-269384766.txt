? ? it: o f M a o r i i a n d . CHAPTER XIH.-CohTW^. fit: Atha Westburt. Overhead the myrtle standi out green and: fragrant, from which comes the reaper of many birds. The novelist has anchored himself by the aide of the young lidy during; ;th»: ^alk,r and;;haa(-,|ila^ed;; Romeo like.a fflan.^ho- has^a part qwte, unsuited to himi He hiB carriod ' on a fusilade of small talk without* even' so muoh a» casting a glance at her to satisfy himself whether Bh e. is ..fair .or .darkj. tall or short. \ When lio does look at her, he is surprisedafc ,th e wonderous charm/andbeauty of her person. To a man of Lyndhurst's enthusiastic yearning for the beautiful;,-a handsome- woman had : its attraction; bntihU admiration went no further than the mere gratification -which beauty erer gives to the eye of an artist- In Maud Cariington, howev&r;, he found himself 'face 1 to face with something lovlier and noblo than common beauty. To one who imagined he' had turned the world inside out, like an 'old glove, and found nothing of freshness or innocence in it for him, the sight of this fair, pure, girlish face; looking up at him in guiltless enjoyraeiiti made him draw a deep breath ot gladness, as if He felt himself in. a purer atmosphere than the air of his every day existence. The compl exion is not fair, ; but fiaa that.fresh bioom .which comes of an open-air life ; the- eyes- are grey, so dark that, till they turn and meet his own, Alton, thinks them black ; the hair darkest brown; and .superabundant,, for the thick plaits : coiled .closely at the head' are innocent of padding. Franker, fairer face never smiled upon mankind.: No dangerous fascination here—nothing of the siren or. the:coquette iih ihis [young English maiden—no history " in her glad young life. The novelist haB plenty of time to .study ^he face of .his companion as they wend their, way .over, the heights of Santo Carlo. ; As a jreayer.of romance, he is naturally a student of humanity. He looks at this girl thoughtfully, Almost reverently. To his fancy she seems the very spirit of rustic innocence—not the. innocence of .the milkmaid, or shepherdess, but of a'damsel of lofty race, simple as Perdita, high-bred as Rosalind, She is certainly beautiful, more absolutely beautiful than he had believed her at first. The dark, rich iiair, which wares a little at .iJje temples; thej pencilled eyebrow, the noble modelling of the mouth and chin might satisfy the most exacting critic. There is mind in that youiig face. "I was so pleased to hear iroin Mr. Warne.vtbktyGu are tke Mr; Lyndhurst," she said; somewhat slowly. " theauthor whose "books have given us so much pleasure." The novelist pauses, surprise depicted on every feature of his face. " t was hot!; aware that my, poor effusions had i -travailed; so far,'.' he responds, quietly,.
