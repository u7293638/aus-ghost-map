THE COMING EENIAN BROTHER- HOOD. \- (To the Editor of the Protestant Standard!) Sin,— Adelaide and Melbourne really dreading the proclivities of those 26 liberated Fenians have eschewed their persons, and prohibited the taint of their souls as an infectious polico-maras- mus, that's a fact ! Hence they are now en route for Sydney, and this elder colony's antecedents enable its leading morning Journal, perhaps, to indulge a tender charity — a feeling akin to pity towards these poor simple minded patriots, men who were led _ astray in a momentary gush of enthusiasm. And Messieurs. Mac Dal, and Co;, who stirred our little world to its depths to prove that here we had none of the dis loyal brood! — that none were so loyal as those who denounced " Parkes and the Ghost !" will here come " a sam ple of the stock" — not less than 26 blackbirds all in a row !— a living bona fide specimen of the vara avis, and when not unwelcome to the Catholic Herald, nay, invited tu settle down, not of course as 'peccant,' but as peaceable colonists. For, forsooth, more guilty rebels than they have mixed and mingled among us. O the boundless charity, that slumbers in the bosom of voluntary liberality ! Shame upon ye, ye narrow minded young bigots, Adelaide and Victoria offshoots from your auld granny! See how she opens her arms to embrace those poor outcast Fenians, aye, and with the kiss of charity!! Pray, Mr. Editor are we then to wit ness a lesser kind of Roman triumph known of old as an ovation, and that on the day when they set foot on the shores of Port Jackson, as an earnest of the coming exodus whose immigration is .already seen looming in the vista. ARGUS.
