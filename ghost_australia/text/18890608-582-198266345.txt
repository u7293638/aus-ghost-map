CORRESPONDENCE. SIR,— Referring to a paragraph in your paper this morning about glow-worms, there are num- bers of these luminous patches to be seen in tbe bush around this town just how. They do not, however, emanate from insects, but from a large specie of fungus — toadstool, in vulgar parlance. I have one of these fungi on my verandah now which was plucked last Sunday and still retains its brilliancy at night-time, demonstrating the presence of a certain quantity of phosphorous in its composition. — Yours, Ac., F. L. BILLINGHURST. Castlemaine, June 7th, 1889.
