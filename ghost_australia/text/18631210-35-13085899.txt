FINE CONDITION OF LABOUR. (Jrorn free "Irqtis, AotviHhr 28 ) No. X THE CAI1IM.TMAKK11S. Pua cabinetmakers of Melbourne illustrate by their position the reality of the expectations of those who, eschewing pro section is an exploded theory, as far as well informed people are concerned, are yet confident that by proper means home manufacture can meet importations in the market on more than equal terms The depression in trade which has ruled for many years has been made brought about by the fact that the home-made article was, of a necktie, far more expensive than the other, consequently, wages Bank to a minimum point, except only where cfDco bilinga were concerned Gradually i pi had stopped in, and cole ular matters soon found their ace untin supply ing ibelnaelveH with those HI'JH which had hitherto given the exporters to Victoria their superiority in cheapness The relive protection of rtd by the exist of OMrnage from home then kicked the beam and cabinet makers find e into vintners, indeed, at such high ratosassomo other issues I tides, but better lb in the closing and the average of the I building trades Cutimctuiuklne,, as a trade, early found a home in Vic today In those happy primordial times, foreign competition was almost unknown The workmen in town were generally employed the best men, there fit for the higher branches requiring more dexterity and skill, getting an average of 6s per day, and inferior workmen, doing inferior or stopwork, conn rending wages which varied from 20s to 30s per week, at the rate of ten hours work a day. In parenthesis, we may remark that, in the case of tbocakinct makers, as in that of nearly every other trade which is brought into direct competition with imports, the eight hours system is tacitly relinquished on all sides, experience showing that its surrender frequently strikes the balance in favour of colonial work Toroturn Even in the old times, very superior workmen on the piano managed to make a good thing of it. With the gold discoveries came a speedy rise in wages, which soon reached £1 a day Good join rs were then making sometimes £1 a day, and many cabinetmakers pre ferry J to seek that class of cm slow ment Furniture than commanded exceedingly high prices and the natural consequence was that when cabinounakerB were ready to return to their old employes at the market was stocked with imported goods" principally cheap American furniture This fact was never in high favour with householders, and the home trade gradually revived, bat at a low rate of pay for inferior (goods a considerable number of journeymen, however, he will finding latter employment on office ratings About this time the man attempted to better their condition by banding together in a trade union, which lasted some time, still many kept aloof, and the society, as well as the eight-hours system which it upheld, soon fell through, because men with larger expects to meet took work home There are now nearly 200 journeymen in Victoria, and the Directory contains a list of about 110 cabinetmakers, the large majority of whom are in business for themselves The former figures include both the good workmen and the slop makers In the larger shops the rate of pay is about Is per hour, but piecework is more frequently the rule This Vanee according to the quality of the work Some men make £4 a week or more This it a high rate, but superior skill sometimes does wonders, and men have been known in London who could actually turn out a chest of drawers in a day. The average rate for piecework is from 5s to 10s per day the inferior classes of work are very poorly paid for It is not By done by what are entailed in London " garret masters, " who work sometimes for town shops and sometimes on speculation They buy their timber at the yard, and piano it up and fix it in their own houses , but, wanting the mechanical aids availed of in the larger shops, choy make less profit, at the same time experiencing the advantage of , a feeling of more or less? independence Wages of from il | to £2 a week for long hours are often as much as can be got this way A man, for instance, can get £1 10s. out of a chest of drawers that fetches £3 10s in the shops, and the work will last him four days When imported goods are fairly driven from the marKet wages will use, but it is a hard better just now, Every day importers are giving up the fight, except in the lighter American chairs, so dreaded by good housekeepers M ben the hot weather causes their frequent collapse The town journeymen are generally employed, but taking the initial workmen all through, they make no more than 6s to 7s per day of ten hours The use of cedar and blackwood for chairs has so reduced the cost of the better note, that importations are almost out of the question, eat large quantities are of made in Melbourne for the provinces of Ivery Zealand One class of workmen must not be omitted They do a sort of cheap work, which, from the low price, id in large secured Such is Made in immense quantities in quite the eia->tt.rn end (of London, and all such workmen acquired the came of ext- endere " they make hero easy chairs, sofas, couches, and such like, that have turned legs indeed, but why e humus consists of cheap material, nailed the thar with lently strong, and stuffed all over with alva seaweed libre, hav ings, or anything almost she comes to hand Cabinetmaking, as a trade, in it therefore boys in to be in a pufhtietltlv healthy condition It has had a great deal to contend with, and in the mouths of those who did not understand the question, was in id.) a sort of text from which To preach protection In good hands, however, a victory which will become shortly a complete one, has been used and th(,U(,h a protective duty would raise wages nominally, it would not raise them higher than they will be in the natural course of events before long, and with this advantage, that the articles consumed by the workmen will not be raised is equal proportion, as must follow from a BJ stool of protection applied all round-to food and clothing as to luxuries Already, perhaps the largest cabinetmaking firm in town, that of Alcock and Co., in Russell street, one scarcely anything but colonial material, all of which must sink in price as the demand increases Thus, in billiard tables-a branch peculiarly their own they have so to say, completely stopped importations and the men employed on that work, too, are the best paid Alcock and Co gained a pass for their billiard-tables of the Great International Exhibition at home, and the only imported articles they use are the indiarubber (which they work up into cushions hero), the cloth, the ivory (which they turn into balls), and the slate, which they are almost in daily expectation of getting from the Castlemaine or other slate quarries Colonial trade is largely helped by the use of cedar, of which one firm in Melbourne USSR from 800,000 to 1,000,000 feet per annum Machinery cuts this into shape, when the workmen complete the job, figuring and polish making it closely compete with mahogany, in fact, there is a great deal of mahogany in the market, which is lying idle Blackwood, from Circular Head and from Mount Macedon, is made to equal mahogany, both in look and wear, when. well treated, and it can hardly be got fast enough, though as much as twenty cargoes, or 600,000 feet, come in yearly from Tasmania Strenuous efforts have been made to get Victorian blackwood equal to Tasmanian It is harder and closer than the latter, but not so large nor st easy to work in the long run, still woodsmen are sanguine of finding better trees, specimens of which have been frequently seen in the depths of the Black Forest and the wooded ranges stretching from Dandenong into Gipps Land Its exquisitely beautiful gram and susceptibility to high praise premise a more extended reputation, than, too Kaurie pine is found to rival American beech for bedroom furniture; and Bunya pine, as a cheap material, finds its way into manufacture.

As a pendant to the growing trade in colonial tobacco, it must not be forgotten that one shop in Melbourne alone tonto Alcock paid Costumes out from 6000 to SOCO cigar bows annually. From the magnificent carved decorations which ornament the handsomest of our banks and drawing-rooms, down to the little wonder curtain-raiser used in railway carriages, Victoria is supplied by its own workmen, who for intelligence, skill, and roads need, are a credit to the community. HTMIV RYMILL. Many of our readers will re- number with hope and interest the name of Henry Kendall, as that of a young Australian poet, some of whose unpublished verses we printed nearly a year ago, together with a note which he had sent to us, explaining his position in New South Wales is a native who had seen very few books. We take from the parcel of verses now sent to us a little poem, entitled " By the Sea a fair example of the dramatic force and stern realism of Mr. Kendall's style The coves of the tea have been troubled to-day IV with the water which whitens, and widens, and fills ; And a boat with our brother was driven away by a wind that came down from the top of the hills. Behold I have seen on the threshold again A face in a strike of hair 1 Do you know that she watches the rain and the main, And the waves which are attaining there! Ah I moaning and moaning there 1 now turn from your casements, ona fatten your door, And cover your faces, and pray, if you can ; There are walls in the wind, there are signs on the shores, And alas for the fate of a storm-beaten roar Oh, dark falls the night on the rain-rutted verge, So sad with the sound of the foam I Oh, wild is the sweep and the swirl of the surge ; And his beat may never come home. Ah, never and never come home I The other short writings which accompany this note and poem, are called " A Squatter's Song," " Mountain Moss," " The Waterfall," " The Rock and the Sea titles which indicate a common property in the poetical aspects of nature on both sides of the globe. Another day, we may quote a further example from this list. Till EACH or RELATED HOLY PLACTW.-The Mahomedans are the soil of their holy land, Mecca, in their devotions. They carry continually about with them a small quantity of it, in a little bag and when they pray, they deposit this coupon the ground, that whenever their devotional ceremonies require them to lay their head on the ground, it may be placed upon the consecrated earth. He is considered particularly happy who can obtain interment in the land itself; but if this be impracticable, he is in the next degree happy who, in his own country, can secure such interment by his head being placed upon a pillow of it. The same practice prevails among the Jtwf. He is the happiest of men who, in the evening of Lie days, can go to Jerusalem, and die and be but it is there he is happy in the next degree who dies and is buried in some country near the sacred land. The happiness diminishes into distance, but he is not unhappy in any country, however distant, with whose remains the smallest quantity of Jerusalem earth may be associated in the grave. In countries not remote from Palestine, a pillow of it may sometimes be laid under the head ; but the general practice hue and elsewhere, 66 only for a very small quantity I as much as will lie upon a shilling to be placed upon each eye. Hyam Isaacs (Ceremonies of the Jew?, 18116) says that during the war, where the sea was invested by French privateers, Jerusalem earth was often so scarce, that only half the usual quantity I was employed. The earth is sent in barrels by the Rabbis at Jerusalem, and to prevent deception on the road, they deposit in each barrel certain articles, carefully distributed, which are mentioned in the invoice; so that on the arrival of the barrel, the identity of its contents is established by a careful comparison of the character and situation of the various articles there found with the indications of the in- voice, which states, fair inference, that four inches from the top there is a knife ; a foot below, a piece of a cloth, &c.; View or -fair GMKAI WALL or CHINA.-Onesc»s those cloud-capped towers extending away over the declivities in single flats, until, dwarfed by miles and miles of skyward perspective, they dwindle into microscopical meanness, yet stand with the solemn dignity belonging to ghosts of a giant creation long gone by as policy were condemned to look out on the march of time ; while the brown.and-black dike at their feet hurries on with many a twist and three across gorge, defile, and having now buried in his- sure and chasm, then with Brobignagian spring tear- ing up the unmeasured height as it in wanton turbulence, altering the outlines of the rocky pinnacles which in high air it surmounts, or Stealing along the sometimes comparatively smooth margin of the mast soaring of all the range, it looks like a great packer on the mountain's noble brow, speeding along until in the misty neutral that it appears but a filmy scratch on a sandstone hill-a slender brown thread fluttering in easy undulations around the mountain tops a great way off, as it fines down to a shadowy hair's-breadth, on its lonesome journey to remote Kansu the Province of Peace ! It would be difficult to find, in any other part of the world, a spectacle so full of admira- tion, and so wonder raising, as this monstrous achieve- ment of other days unfold itself to the traveller whose rides along the pleasant road which conducts him into the Tartar land from the boundaries of old Chin».-JFUmini/'s Travels on Horseback in Mantchu Tartary. ExTiiAoiiniNAiiv, ir TABER-In 1844 a young man left a village near Chamouny, on a pilgrimage to the Convent of St. Bernard, in consequence of a vow made before gaining the belle of the village. After leaving the Convent, he went to several places and bought some linen with the intention of smuggling it across the Sardinian frontier. To do this he had to go by an unfrequented track. He started on his perilous journey and was never heard of again until a few weeks ago, when a shepherd, who had lost his way, on jumping across a deep glacier saw a wonderful sight. The rays of the sinking sun illuminated a gulf of ice, looking like a vast crystal cavern, in the midst of which was the figure of a man, lying flat on his back, with apparently open eyes, and hands folded across his breast, end with a large parcel serving as a pillow, under his head. The shepherd hallooed at the top of his voice, and then screamed; but not a voice answered from below. At break of dawn next morning a party of mountaineers, guided by the shepherd, and provided with ropes and axes, "set out for the spot. The crystal sarcophagus was soon found, and the boldest of the company was let down to the icy depths, from which he brought in his arms the body of a young man, frozen, and hard as a stone, yet looking still fresh and lifelike. Attached to the corpse by a mass of ice, was a parcel containing a new piece of linen; while a watch, in the coat-pocket of the dead men, with broken glass, but not otherwise damaged, showed the hour of noon. Two elderly peasants at once recognised the features of those of the pilgrim of Passy, mysteriously lost nineteen years ago. Em- balmed in ice, decay had not yet touched his flesh, and he had lain undisturbed innis crystal coffin while a generation of men passed away over his head, The pilgrim, dead nineteen years, was carried to his former home, and left at the cottage of the young widow of PUB- now young no more, but an elderly grey hair el woman.
