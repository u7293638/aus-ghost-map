CRI~CKET BY " W~I\LLOW." "There were enough duck's-.egs to imake Inquirer' comfurtable."-" Willow," last week. To the Editor qf /he Stnddar'd. Srn,--My name havilg been mentioned in the three lnst Cricket Notes, by " Willow," it would be no doubt interclting to know his object for doing so. Of course it will be remembered that when "lnquirer " wrote lnst he askod two ques tions, which wero-(I) Did the crack bowler on the Hawthorn side in a certain match bowl six wides in one over ? and (2) Did the players breakltfst oil' the duck's-eggs they were so clever in making ? I was answered in one of these questions by a vile pun, Sir; and though I to some extent holl with Dr. Johnson that " lie rwho would make a piun would pick a pockel,', still 1. am satislied. Going further, I suppose el will in his next say that there was auldititonal prise due to the I Hawthoruites in the last match, for lick. ilg the Beau.meiond(c) so easily ! "1 iIighi remind " Willow " that there are several little comllparisons which would fit this continual referenco to "Inquirer." The ghost of Banquo at the table is the most ap propriate, perhaps. Did, then, " Inquirer's " queries about duclk's-eggs and " wide " overs touch the Hawthorn sidle so closely that their champion, " Willow," has to mention his uinue every week in his lucubrantions P To this question 1 still am, Sir, with your pIr INIQUIRROU INQUIRER.
