LECTURES. -44 REPENTANCE AFTER DEATH. The Rev Joseph Cook dear tried, in the Protestant Hall last night, the last lecture of his present series the subject being' Eternal Hope or Repentance After Death'' The hall was crowded and a large number of clergymen and leading citizens were seated on the platform Dean Cowper occupied the chair, and prayer having been offered up, introduced the lecturer He stated that he was glad to have the opportunity to express his thankfulness that the distinguished lecturer had visited Sydney 'U Then he heard of his arrival he felt deeply thanks to God that he had directed his steps hither Huxham? said some of Mr Cook's writings, he felt that the advent of such a man was calculated to be a great blessing to the people here, whether they believed in the truth, or were widowers, or even unbelievers In his writings Mr Cook had confronted many grievous errors by most intelligent arguments and they might now hope that many would be benefited by his living v nee Ho pray ed that God w raid give their friend heart to address them and to themselves singleness of heart and mind, without which they or did not know and embrace the truth The rev lecturer, who was received with applause, said that Almighty God was present with them that night, and it was most fitting that their dies Uhsi m should be conducted is if they, were on their knees to him and without applause He then entered upon his subject He commenced with tin Btiteincntthtthcforouo had made up his mind not to go out of this world, trusting his chance of eternal peace to an opportunity for repentance after death And what he would not do himself God forbid that he should recommend others to do He intended to discuss this theme in the practical, theoretical, and scriptural aspects Beginning with the practical, he would ask how many of them were willing, to rise up and solemnly before their own conscience and God de fire their willingness to take their chance of going from this world dependent upon the opportunity he had referred to The best test of any doctrine was to act it out The doctrine of resistance after death was seductive, but he would not recognize it in life as a master, and in death he would not own it as his slave o He would not say that it was not true but that he was not willing to rest upon it And turning to the men who preached it and their followers, the opportunity for repentance after death, with all its advantage s was open to them, and he would ask them if they purposed accepting it The decision of this question in its practical bounds was really its decision in the theoretical Passing,, from the practical aspect t to the theoretical he said a great principle was involved in the question whether a man would be willing to repent after death in order to be at peace men must possess a predominant desire to be holy Only by such a desire could they be re- conciled to God Not possessing as they became immoral characters, which were moulded to an eternal purpose, although they had not lost freedom of will When they had willingness to repent they were not hardened to a set purpose It must be shown however, that grounds existed for believing that such men would return from the brink they had passed, the probability being that if they did not do so their desire for repentance would be gone No means existed of judging of the conditions of another life except a knowledge of this life, and they knew that in the very nature of things final permanence could come but once He was not there to discuss the question of what might be the form of their sufferings in another world It was enough to know that some things rested very hard upon them here He did now know what might happen when they were in the punctual body It was a matter of which they must judge by revelation He believed that here men had the rudiments of spiritual bodies, and possessed feelings pertaining to spiritual souls. Character was believed to tend to final permanence, and the principle was part of Bible philosophy It was said therein that those who committed ama against the Holy Ghost never obtained forgiveness, but were in danger of eternal punishment If, therefore, there was eternal punishment, was there not also eternal in i Anotherportion of the Scripture affirmed that the day should arrive when those who were holy should remain holy, and those who were filthy should remain filthy still They would find running through the book the two great propositions on which he stood, namely, that character tended to final permanence, and that this permanence could come but once He would not say it would be attained, but he would pretend that according to all they knew of natural law there must come a brink beyond which if men passed they might well despair The Bible settled the question as to when probation ended He did not know' seven scholars who had not found in the book that now was the day of salvation, and that it was with infinite risk a man lived dependent upon the opportunity for repentance hereafter The book taught that probation ended with this life, and if there be eternal sin there must be eternal punishment If punishment continued, men might harden under it Greutor Illuminator would come to them after death, but would they love it is they would continue to rebel against it and lose the desire to repent If they signed here, the desire for change might not come after death, and there was such a thing as its being too late to mend the rev gentleman quoted extracts from a number of writers in support of his arguments, and at the conclusion of his lecture was loudly applauded On the motion of Mr. E Vickery, seconded by the Hon W Foster, he was thanked for his lecture which was regarded as very instructive, and he was also desired to give a second series 1 his he consented to do
