The Rebaptlstnffof a Mountain. A Carious Story. " Diablerets! That is rather a grim name for a mountain. What is the origin of it ?" , was another of- our questions. For answer we had a curious story enough. In 1714 the'whole valley was affrighted by strange unearthly noises proceeding, as it seemed, from the very bowels of the . mountain. The priests told the people thai a war had broken out in the infernal regions, and that a pitched battle was going on between legions of demons Imprisoned under the rocks. Then it was that the mountain was rebaptised with its present uncanny name. Later in the year the solution of the mystery came in the shape of an enormous landslip, of which the internal rumblings had been the warning, which rent the whole mountain, as it were, in twain, one-half rolling away from the other, and blotting out all the old features of the country. Numbers of people and multitudes of cattle perished. The most eartraordinary part of the business, however, consisted in the reappearance of a farmer after having been buried for three months. A funeral service had been held near the spot where his chalet had disappeared, and his relatives were in mourning for him as one dead. When, haggard and spectre-like, he presented himself in the neighbouring village the inhabitants fled in terror, and a priest was summoned to exorcise the spirit. It was with the greatest difficulty that he succeeded in persuading the people he was not a ghost He had had a miraculous escape. A mass of rock had fallen athwart his chalet, where at the time he was alone, in such a way as to prevent the superincumbent mass from crushing It Air had reached him through various crevices, and he had been able to support himself on provisions left in the house, until by constant labour he had succeeded in tunnelling his way back to the living world.â€” Atalanta."
