RACING NOTES. By Pi (ASUS. It may not be pi i haps amiss to suggest to the Q PC author i ties that they make arrange mails in time to see a proper system of starting for their Autumn Meeting In the first place it may be conceded that it leaves difficult, if not an impossible, task for any one ollie tal to start a held of horses, when the animals but not particularly tractable, and their adds not a uticulaily amenable to discipline Iliac does not indeed seem any reason why we should not follow the example of the V I! 0 in this matta, by lining a starter and assistant starts, and a chalk line drawn by which the horses are to lange thom inches in line in the event of any jockey wilfully persisting in disregarding the corn in aids of the sun as, he should be fined for the first time lightly, and on a repetition of the offence mon bundy In this mining discipline might well be established, and horseowners in still not, in addition to the other once dainties of a tang have to look forward with an and trembling to the flag being lowered when one horse is one of six lengths or so in advance of 2-tooths One, if not two, of the jockeys who rode at Beuidcseit deserve d lining heavily, for, not only did they utterly disregard the commands of the state to come back, but, unfortunately, through the weakness of that official, was allowed to reap the reward of their pa tiuaatyatid insubordination by scot mg a win the employment of an assistant who Towns that the on a signal from the state is another describe it element in getting the horses it is to Somalia and sat ely when we see how v i j well this is managed down south it is quite high time that we should copy our neighbours in such an important particular I had been informed unofficially that the amount of payments for the Shorts Handicap, as st held in the programmes, is a mistake, and if so, I trust it will be collected as soon is possible It will be noticed that the Shorts Handle in, which is the last race of the meeting, takes the place of thcPoiced Handicap, and the pay incuts, as published, are I see around tion fee 15 sec nee pt met, ind 1 son third pavilion, together with sweepstakes of 2sovs , which makes a total of no less than 15 10s befoieahoise can start for this event in the Consolation Stakes of For eed Handicaps, it is always usual to make pay ments as low as possible, so is to bring a huge bird to the post for the last event of the meeting Various other alterations in the proper mine suggest themselves, and L mi sure that if a Publicans' Purse of 10d sovs , 1 mile, with 10s entrance and 10s accept mee, could be collected (which I think might well be done with a little trouble, and the Ladies' Bracelet prizes first second, and third were donated by members of the club and their friends, another i vice could easily be inserted into each days later g The May St like a could take its former position as a weight for age race, with proper pen rifles for w others of 100 Sovs and over, the sheets H indic ip could also fall into its proper place on the last day, and thePotced Handicap would reappt iron the programme. The Ladies' Bracelet Stake has at present very dubious and unsatisfactory conditions, which must, if persist el in, came ely unless it from the category of a "enteritis miers love, but I am in hopes that in this and in other respects the QTC committee will think fit to make such alterations is are necessary to render the coming meeting a success All (Gordons Latona, full sister to the champion winner Le Brix and, is, I hear, in training somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Albion The this is said to be under the charge of an old and tvpuitnctd trainer. While at Utaudtaei 11 ist week I heard particulars of a very annul dodge in enabling a ruin to carry short weight, which twos said had been put in practice at some recent meetings It is known as the * shot trick," and is worked as follows -1 First of all, there must be two hot sus lumitngiiithe some interest, one or Hitchins of course no chance of winning the joel c. of the other horse (with which it is intended to win is much under weight, and has therefore to carry a belt loaded with sufficient shot to enable him to pass the ordeal of the clerk of the scales Going" on to the course, this jockey finds an opportunity of slipping his by it and passes it to his corn ado, and so sides the face very much much as eight After passing.. the post both bones in a considerable distance and in the confusion and excitement the shot belt is supposed to be safely piastdbiek again Of course when clerks of the course and stewards into the alert and bring back the horses to will li in us without loss of time, the trick must be discovered, but the plan is quite feasible at country meetings, n__,_ when no one is suspecting, any thing of the kind The idea, however, is a very ingenious one, and it seems a pity that the talent of the inventor should be wasted on such an unworthy object I am glad to hear that stimuli steel by the example of the Logan and Albert Club, a jockey club is in course of lunn ition at 1 si. It will be named the Lily! me Juici Jockey Club, md the promoters have already ltccivcdpto mises of substantial support from the -station holders in the district I understand that it is intended to have a petition by contest in the shape of a small meeting to be held in May jVs the i unt ly eviction to Esk is a matter of the immediate future there can be no doubt that the iiicc*)ii"3 will be well pitt on ed both by IJirabniic, Jj stuck, arid Downs out but, if sufficient induce mails can be afforded them in the shape of fair conditions mel of pi was worth winning Mr Jost s Kcqnte has again taken a trip to Sydney under the care of G. Harris, to try his luck in the coming events of the Hawkesbury and A J G meetings. I am in receipt of the full programme of the Blackall Racing Club meeting to be held on 26th and 27th June The principal events are the Minden Plate of 50 Sovs , Blackall Ilundi cup of 7d sovs, Steeplechase of 70 sovs , and Blackall Racing Club Handicap of 200 sovs - (entrance only 28 per cent on the added money The conditions of the Welter (Corinthian) Handicap no also very good They run as follows -"For all horses the horse the property of members of any recognised race club and to be ridden by amateur riders membersof and recognised club " From our telegraphic advices I see that little w feeling has been done on the coming events Despot, Maloney, and Ghost are in favour for the Hawkesbury Handicap, but very little light out betting took place For the AJC St Leger, 5 to 4 is the best offer against Martini Henry, and 6 to 4 against Le Grand Cha e is a disposition to back the latter at 7 to \- while 5 to 1 is forthcoming against the iff Coletti of War wick The following are the leading feature of the Sydney Cup betting 400 to 15 against Commotion, 100 to 12 against Le Grand ; 100 to 8 each against I n tim Horny and Despot, 100 to 7 OIE Colour Line principal scratchings for the Haw Lesbia by 1 handicaps have been an easy announced They tie Daisy, The Drummer, Palatcnda, Mil brodale, Raven, Torpedo, D/7½, Segenhoe, Sir Modred, Le Grand, Warwick, Aide de Camp, Old Gold Masquerade, Hypatia, Bnstol, Grosvenor, Evered, Wallangra, Lord Wilton, Boscawen, Drumstick, The Bean, Notice, GI radiator, Howlong, and Beaumont For in our horses are left in for the Sydney Cup, and amongst the most prominent man contented Mains, Warwick, A clue, Anglesey, Misquciide, Bristol, Eng man, Nicholas, Hun leane and Wallangra " Nemo in the Sydney Mail, states that Warwick is said to be doing well at Warwick Farm, so there is more than a probability of his measuring strides with Martini Harry Le Grand, and Off Colour in the St. Leger in the Federal Australian "Sterling" Has the following "Betting on the VRC Derby, 1884, has already commenced On Tuesday the South Australian colt, The Broker, was bucked to win 2000 at tens to one, a very short price indeed, considering that the race is nearly st via months off The Broker, it will be remembered, was disposed of by auction last May, when Mr. John Co over, just decided on giving up racing The price paid was, I believe, 120 guineas, though he cost Mr Creer 150 guineas in Sydney as availing No two year old in Victoria has made more rapid strides in learning his business, and he was appropriately named The Broker by Mr Crozier, who, at the time he christened him, selected the name as a compliment to one of our leading turfites whose name the size of the Bl oka claims Another colt that has been supported by a good South Australian judge is Phil Athol, by Blair Athol out of Phillina (imp ) This youngster was I am informed, bred in England to Australian time and foaled here One thousand to 100 was booked about him for the next V R C Derby, and 1000 to 15 about his emulating his stable companion Martini Henry's example of landing the big double In the same stable is another colt named Tremando b Tester (imp ) out of Agitation, and if all accounts about him are true, then he is verily a wonder. Followers of the Hon Jas White's stable will remember how Martini Henry was saved till a three year old, and the good results that followed through not hurrying him as a two year old. It remains now to be seen whether the same wise counsels will prevail in respect to the two colts just mentioned Should it do so, we may again expect to see the popular blue and white occupying a prominent position as the dual struggle of the V R C Derby of 1884 takes place ' A rather cul Louis item of news comes to us from home It appears that the Oadby Race course and Club Company of Leicester have purchased the living of the parish of Dalby, the value of which is £400 a year The company acquired a portion of the glebe land to complete their course and in order to secure the use of it purchased the living and the sole right to present to the benefice that a race course company should be patrons of a living must be something of a novelty in the English Church but perhaps moralists will say that this illustrates the old saying of the nearer the chin eli the further from heaven ' liomJItll s List, I take the follow liigLnghsh items -The Prince of Wales, it is stud, has signified his intention of being present at the race for the Liverpool Grand National As on previous visits to Aintree his Boy to Highness will be the guest tim ing the we cent of the 1 and of Sefton, at Croxteth Hall s he Pt met, for the last time in the history of the nice, li is entered an area d in his own name, The Scot, who is trained at Epsom by John Jones It is now settled beyond dispute that the whole of the horses in training the property of Lord Falmouth will be brought under the hammer , but when the Mcicwiilh breeding stud is broken up in Tilly it is understood that his lordship will letom Queen Bcithn Silver bin, and one or two of the more respectable among the gems of the collection His statement that Loi 1 1 Falmouth has lately had a number of fauna thrown upon his hands in denied with some degree of authority Tattersalls Club at Sydney, is evidently in a very li mushing condition At the annual meeting, the eh m min, Mt 1 1> Oihlfe, ML A after referring to the prosperous condition of the club moved the adoption of the report and bol inte sheet which was carried Last year the club showed for the year ending February ISSi £k)00 while the year ending ISM 1440 showing a balance of JL'KJO The meeting then proceeded to elect office bearers Mr J B Olliffe was re elected citait meet, a similar compliment being extended Mr George C to us for the position of treasurer Messrs A li Pi mee 82, AV You car 79 W Pagan 72, W I Glmke 57, were elected a committee for the ensuing year
