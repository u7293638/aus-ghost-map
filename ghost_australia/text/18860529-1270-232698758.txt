Trevor at lastfoimd a Toiee. and asked whether he was a duly-qualified practitioner. A remembrance. o r the old legend that ghosts vanished at cock crowing had flashed through his miricl, and he thought it he could make the ghost talk for awhile it might'save him a little pain. that,is to,say, if iheghost really intended; dissecting him forjtlie. benefit of the surrounding au lience of ghosts. Duly qualified l" cried the giant, and . his tone did not give Trevor any asKur-- anee that he would be spared any dissecting. "Why, young fellow. I was | more duly qualified than you will ever be, long before you were born." " But, surely, I have never seen you ?" as Trevor, to gain tirfie. - Seen me! No. I was celebrated once, too celebrated oue would have thought for my body to be cut t.o pieces i in , a dissecting . room, as it will be, for! 4 T - ' -i t" though l .may have power at night, in the day my spiritless body must bear auything'-that may be done to it;" As he finished speaking,he made a slash at one of Trevor's arms. Trevor winced as the sharp instrument cut deeply into his flesh, but in spite q£ the pais he could not move. Some strange power had bound him with a chain that he could not break, and it was in vain that he tried to get, out of the way of the torturing knife. Thc giant continued talking," but this did not benefit Trevor in the least, for he cut and slashed all the time; at last, how- ever, when his head was sewed from his body; Trevor'become unconscious of the pain, and presented to himself the novel spectacle of a being headless, armjess, Jcgless. i-dnld possibly in fact be .'cnt.offi.'lfo.w.Le less everything that suf-'j fered no pain.
