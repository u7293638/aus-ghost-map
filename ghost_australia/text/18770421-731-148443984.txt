Twilight Memories. How often, in the stillness of a summer evening, when pensively beguiling the time by luxuriating in a rustic arbour, with the soft delicate tints of a depart ing sun appealing and as quickly dis appearing in the distance, does the pure simplicity of the scene before you cause the mind to be lulled into a peaceful semi-trance, creating those quiet thoughts which almost transfer the thinker from earth to heaven, so pleasing and alluring are the fancies which, although only of a visionary nature, appear to promise such exquisite pleasure, and bear such a sem blance of undeniable truth as to thor oughly intoxicate the senses with their false sweetness. Even the soft evening breeze, as it wafts along daintily touching the various flowers and leaves in its progress, causing the air to be perfumed with their deli cious fragrance, seems to whisper of re membrances almost passed into oblivion, vaguely reminding one' of associations that have long ago been consecrated to that indefinite past so instinctively known as ** what might have been.' It is twilight that is dedicated to musing on the past and future, for it is that portion of the day when thoughts are free from connection with business and the struggle of an everyday life. Twilight memories savour aimost of the poetical, so pure are the glimpses of a life's romance that often flit across the brain, foreshadowing a future so blight and happy in its intensity of feeling that it seems a move than ordinary hardship when the commonplace incidents of matter-of-fact life incite the mind to paint happiness in such warm colors ; unfortunately, so far brighter than ever the reality will wear. Listen, as the music of a peal of bells, gently borne on the breeze from far in the distance, comes to you at first loud and distinct in its every tone, then gia dually softening down Into an almost murmur, so eloquent and insinuating is its voice, as to often magically clothe the shadow of thought in the richest of poetry, touching the springs of happiness and causing the heart to throb with the wildest emotions, as it listens and be comes enchanted by the insinuating whisper of that unknown tongue ; or may be it will strike the chord of sadness, aiding the strange weird feeling that has possession of the senses, and which is appealing to and sympathising with the mind in its ' own peculiar way, being gentle but firm in its progress, though sharp and severe in the wounds it makes, never staying to heal, but laying bare the old sores to be stabbed afresh by the knife of that most unmerciful of all sur geons, 'Time.' Who shall answer the question of the poet who says â€” Are they dead hopes which haunt us, Or hopes that never were ? for let the kaleidescope of the mind illume the first line or the second, it will most assuredly produce thoughts that in this quiet eventide will be cherished and loved, for there is- an unutterable charm connecting those endearing memories of ' dead hopes,' or the ghost of that irre vokable 'joys that never were' with the pleasures and pain of to-day, exhibiting a deep abiding but simple and faithful record of a shadowy past. To me these twilight memories are the soft pleasures of life, the quiet exuber ance of the bodily spirits acting with fan ciful pleasure on the mind, causing an imaginery happiness, as recollections of fairy figures who were once loved almost to distraction, but whose memory now peacefully fades into oblivion, and at whose recollection a smile plays on the lips, and the thoughts fly away with the knowledge of how fickle is human nature. Possibly, the echo of some bygone, much loved song will, uncalled, come ringing in the ears, bringing pleasure with the remembrance of its every note as it was once sung by an old love, long absent from sight, but even to this date cherished and rernenibeied, It is whilst dwelling on memories like these, or others equally pleasurable, that the whole becomes a picture so supremely lavish of color as to form a dreamy mist that To us dim seem Apparelld in celestial light The glory and freshness of a dream, for fair and haunting as the vision may be. and even endowed with an almost vitality, yet with all its beauty of ex pression, power of thought, and loveli ness of being, it but owes its existence to Twilight Memories.
