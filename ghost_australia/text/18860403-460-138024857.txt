The are-Ormond, 47 and 172; Capulet, d SO for 7 wickets. The finish was 1 exciting, owing to the splendid bowling "elding of the Ormond men. Capulet red 79 to win on starting their second gs, and when seven had fallen for 57 the was decidedly doubtful. Coulson, how batted like a book, and it was mainly to his vigorous and effective play for 28 out that the Capulets gained the day. much praise cannot be bestowed upon Ormond fellows for the tine up-hill tight j made. After that 47 in the first innings Ormond men looked clean out of the run but, like men of real true grit, they nothing daunted by their apparently eless cuance. They stuck to their Tc like men, and though defeated they e so bold a bid for victory that unstinted ise has been accorded them on all sides, pital judge of the game reports to me! ,t the wicket-keeping of llains was first s, and it is added that if he follows up game he will probably become one of the t wicket-keepers in Australia, luring the Ormond second innings an un-1 al incident occurred. The Capulet skipper iwed a substitute to run for Perkins. Per s made a hit to the long field, and started with his substitute for the other end. hen balf-way down the pitch Perkins ipped, and made no effort to get back to l crease or reach the other end. The ball ib thrown in and the bails knocked off. ic umpire appealed to gave a not-out de ion. The ball was thrown to the other P. and the bails removed, but the umpire at it end gave " not out" also. Perkins made runs afterwards. The umpires clearly •ed, for rule 39 says that, " The striker may run out if either he or his substitute be t of his ground." Surely the middle of the Btch is out of his ground. ■Capulet start against North Fitzroy to-day, id un interesting match is anticipated. J. Worrali, the well-known Jolimonter, Byed a grand innings for 15G (not out) out a total of 220 odd realised on Tliurs . by the Age office against South elbourne Trades. Worrali a bitting was ngniticent, and he gave only one |ance. In three successive innings he has ade 113, 74, and 150 (not out). This is it so bad for a player who, in the opinion some persons, is rather a poor batsman, liichinond non-players defeated M.C.C. n-pluyers on Thursday by five wickets and I runs. For the victors W, Ford played icellently for 90 (not out).
