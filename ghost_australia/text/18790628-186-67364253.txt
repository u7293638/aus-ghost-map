The weather has now settled to fine all over the colony. Abemocb pat m liiialilim a few days since, to the effect that the TiorthaBu*... Gnmmar School TrsstKs bad decided not to recelTS papflf under twelve yens of age, has raised some little discassion-it being eon tended on one aide tbat anch a lbnitstion would virtually be a breach of faith, and a great mjastiee to many of the subscribers to the school building fund; while, ou the other hand,itismsmtan-ed that for the efficiency ofthescboolit is deeiraHe that boys should not be admitted under a certain age. The fact m. tbat the Trustees have taken no action in the matter: but the question raised is one which dandy affects the working of a Grammar School. It has been a matter of frequent complaint by the Masters of the Grammar Schools in tins colony that then- time is frittered sway m then* care before they have passed through a being --..ihf ??*»»} alike to teacher and taught. And the boys pmauatmely placed in .Grammar School seldom make credit able progress or appear at the annual franrimuinm as prise taken. In the Bri - bane Grammar School it has been re marked daring the last two or three yean that the boys admitted to scholarships fn»- the primary schools advance rapidly and take the Win all the dames. We do not forget that these boys are the pick of tbe State schools, but it m nevertheless obvious that boys had better not go to a Grammar School nntil they have come up to the stan dard of the Fourth Oass in the State school. Whether they should be barred bom admsuuen anta they have reached that stardard, is another question, and it is one affecting tbe income of the Grammar School ss well as tbe wishes of parents wfaoobject to the social grade of the chadren attending the State schools. An attempt has been made hi Brisbane to meet the dinicnUy by esanragbw private preparatory schools; la* nD^taO of attainment hai been insisted on by the managen of the metropolitan Grammar School We think, bowe«er. that a standard of some sort would be rwmrsMij. but one n lating to attsimnratt rather than age.
