THE NEW SUPPLEMENT. , TO THR EDITOR. . " R Sir,—-Permit, .tie compliment you upon, and thank you for the additional weekly reading you. furnish your subscribers' with ; and judging from the quality of the first issue, of your supplement, I have no hesitancy in prognosticating success to the venture. The idea of such an accession to your columns 'was happily 1 conceived. In country districts, even in the most populous centres the savant is a ra»a auis, and the 4 'sweetness " of the choicest productions of the most Accomplished of the English literati iju generally soeaking, " wasted on th«» dlsert air." For exquisite humor, artis-" tically. couched morals, and language that presents the rare combination of raciness and eloquence the works of Douglas Jerrold "are almost unrivalled in our language ; and if future extracts are as well chosen as "Tappington's Ghost" your readers have a weekly treat in store for them. They will, moreover, have a medium placed in their hands of becoming acquainted with some of our best authors. And further : whilst the seriously disposed and contemplative will find in the Y. P. supplement (of course I judge from the first issue and ab uao disct omnes) most toothsome pabulum, the votaries of Comus will be disposed to vote you their hearty thanks for your column - under the head of " Wit and Humour." I assure you I read every word of your Friday's publication, and when I turned over the sheet to prolong the pleasurable pastime I think I looked as blank as the page which confronted me. Your readers have only to begin to con the Y. P. supplement to anticipate the weekly delivery with zest.—l am. etc., LECTOR.
