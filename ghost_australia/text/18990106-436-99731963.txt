WILBEEFORCE'S WARNING. The following ghost story, which is a bona-fide experience of Bishop Wilberforcp, is perhaps not generally known, that dig nitary having been chary of confiding it to his friends, though firmly believing in tbe episo 3e himself : — Wilberforce was returning home one evening when he noticed a fellow pedestrian on the other side of the street who attracted his attention by the extraordinary way in which he kept step with himself; not only that, but he actually went so far as to copy bis every gesture. This, naturally enough, the bishop thought exceedingly rude on the stranger's part, and he tried hard to make out his faoe through the gathering dusk ; this, however, he was unable to do. Iu taking stock of the peculiar mimicry the bishop perceived in some amazement that people passing by the unknown took no notice of him ; seemed, indeed, not to be aware of his existence, and as Wilberforce drew neai to biR own door this amazement reached a climax on beholding a passer-by apparently go through the stranger. So firm was hie belief in this phenomenon that the bishop';) pnlses beat quickly and he hurried to his door, while on his pare the mysfcerioua stranger mounted the steps of a hou^o directly opposite. Arrived at the top Wil berforce turned involuntarily to take a hasty glance, and on ser-ing the stranger's face, which he did clearly, gave a quick exclamation, for the face he beheld was his own 1 Then the figure vanished. Bi6hop Wilberforco, unable to account for the in cident, regarded it in the light of a warn iog, and refused to sleep that night beneath his own roof — a decision that, curiously enough, in all probability saved his life, for that same night tho ceiling of his bedroom gave way just over the spot where his bed stood, and in its descent wrecked that article cf furniture utterly. Had the biBhop slept there that night it is scarcely possible that his life would have been spared.
