THE OPEN COLUMN. TTTTi-, CATHOLIC CONCERT. TO THS EDITOR. Sirâ€” I am surprised that 'Donizetti's Ghost' or any other Ghost should dare to differ fat ?opinion with your contemporary's report of the Catholic Concert. These poor misguided people with the exception of Mr Mumme, gave their services fof the good of their church, and all seemed highly delighted with their performances. I really considered them splendid, until I saw the report in this 'organ of teatotaMers and spiritualists,' and even then I thought., charity onght in such a case to silence adverse criticism, but I see my mistake Sir, like Uriah Heap ' I am'umble, alwaya 'umblfe.x- The report aoOTe menfcioneJ must have been correct, and every body else wrong, and neither ' Donizsib's Ghost' nor any other ghost has the ghost m% chance against the opinions enunciated by' snch an important journal as your contemporary very deservedly fancies his to be. I. am- Sir, &c;, ? CANT.
