'To the Editor of the Australian Churchman. S! Sir — ' Observer' says the higher-life doctrine ' practically ignores the Holy Ghost,' &c;, while Dr. Bonar says as much as that it ' sub stitutes the work of tb? Spirit for the work of Christ.' I leave to ?adverse critics the task of settling this difference. ' But a very important charge against the teachers in the Brighton Convention is. that thev ienore or denv.the doctrine of 'imouted righteousness.' As a sufficient reply to this charge, I enclose an extract from an. address by Mrs. Smith, taken from the 'Authorised Report' of the convention. If you can find space for it you will oblige, yours truly, ; ' Joseph Barnier. ' ' Mrs, Pearsall Smith said it was very essential that she should be thoroughly understood to be speaking to believers, that when she talked about the necessity of a holy life and of obedience to God's laws, and having an actual righteousness wrought out in our daily life, it was not because she did not believe in the imputed righteous ness of Christ, but because she did believe in it, and had got it, that she had any courage or hope to go on and talk about practical daily righteousness. ; ' 'All that she said was founded upon the truth that the righteous ness of Christ was imputed to believers, just as righteousness was imputed to Abraham who believed the wbrdof God. The assurance of faith was the foundation of it all. ^To one could act like a wife until she knew that she was a wife — nobody could act like a king until he knew he was a king, and nobody ; could act like a child of God unlesB he knew he was a child of God.'
