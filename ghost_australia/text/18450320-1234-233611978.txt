Sir Eardley Wilmot has been pleased to appoint the late Attorney-General, Mr. Macdowell, whom His Excellency had been previously pleased to appoint to the office of Judge of the Supreme Court at Norfolk Island, to the office of Commissioner of the Insolvent Court. The appointment was con- ferred in the handsomest manner. It could not have been bestowed more satis- factorily to the public. Mr. Macdowell filled the office of Attorney- General to the perfect content equally of the Government, whose officer he was, and of the entire community, whose interests he administered. He was in every respect a popular Attorney- General, and will, no doubt, give equal general satisfaction in his present office. ———— Two great stimuli may be supposed to have influenced Lord Stanley in authorizing Sir Eardley Wilmot to hold a personal con- ference with the Governors of these colo- nies whenever His Excellency may consider it necessary. First the necessity of placing a flood-gate (if we may so say) to stop the inundation of prisoners upon this little island, which if continued at its present rate, certainly threatens consequences of the most fearful nature. Secondly, to es- tablish the right of Britain to the possession of the northern portion of the great Aus- tralian continent, by forming a British colony thereon,—plain and palpable as are the designs of France, to colonize in these seas to the utmost practicable extent. The position recommended by Lord Stanley for selection, is reported to include that splendid country, described by Captain Cook, its origina1 discoverer, so to be; and as all the commanders of ships, who have made the inner passage to Torres' Straits, also de- scribe it, situated at the mouth of a navi- gable river, in about 16° of south latitude, and 145° 30 east longitude. The western ^pupdary of the proposed colony being Cape Flattery, the southern boundary Cape Graf- ton.

Then why continue a Fantoccini, the puppets in wl'ich are ashamed of their performance ? The extract we made laist "week from the Australian expi'essed.in ^excellent terms the absurdity of the idea of p. real representative and real responsible Governmeat, not. only in the really .great , colony of New South Wales, but in any polony i/whatever, under any Government '.whatever! 1$ .there an example of any such existing, or which ever r: did exist in any time, however remote ? o Can this depot'of prisoners, then. exhibit, any pretence to possess what no other colony n does on the face of the earth ?., But passing, , over that question, another of more importance arises. Let us suppose that, the English Government,' iipon tn'^' representation of Sir Eardley Wilmot, shall put a stop, to the further ;trarisiiissibti of prisbnerfe hitherj sb as to allay thfe 'present'feeliug apd alppre- •hfension' which sb -generally prevails, 'and that thereby it became precisely upon the footing with New South Wales in respefct ;to the transportation question, With thiS ad L d ditional advantage, that the expenditure -of lone thousand pounds per. day must continue for, an indefinite period', of time<—will the colony even then; until • riespectable emigration by that-and by . other means'be-re- l established, be in a condition to aek for an elective Legislature ? We ; apprehendnot! The Australian referred with great accuracy to the gradual process by which the people Df the American States obtained the elective franchise. And so it must be here.
