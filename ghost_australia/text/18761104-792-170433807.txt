That dog had fought In the fierce onslaught, Had rushed with his master on; And both fought well, But the master fell— And behold the surviving one I By his lifeless olay, Shaggy and grey, His fellow-warrior stood; Nor moved beyond, But mingled, fond, Big tears with his master's blood. Vigil he keeps By those green heaps, That tell where heroes be; No passer-by Can attract his eye, For he knows " it is not HE t" At the dawn, when dew Wets the garlands new That are hung in the plaoe of mourning, He will start to meet The coming feet Of HIM whom he dreamt returning. On the grave's wood-cross, When the ohaplets toss, By the blasts of midDight shaken, How he.howleth ! hark I ' From that dwelling dark The slain he would fain awaken.

Oft in the night, With main and might, He strives to ruse the stone; Short respite takes— " If mbBter wakes, He'll call me "—then sleeps on.
