' ATTITUDE OF THE COUNTRY H S , PRESS. H A CHORUS OF APPROVAL. A TEST OF PUBLIC OPINION. I A significant feature of the federal campaign is the H fact that the country press is almost wholly in favour mt of the cause of union. For a seeks past federation M has been the subject of lenders of letters, and of mt contributed articles in the various local papers from me the well-printed news sheets published in prosper- M ous country towns, down to the small equal to pub- at lications, which see the light scattery more than once H a week in scattered districts. The voice of W J country press is over helming in favour of a &? adoption of the proposed constitution. Whatever am theory we may hold as to the relation of the" H and the public this state of affairs augurs well BM the national cause. By some it is held that the give a lead public opinion. Olhersholdthatitfollow.it. H Nobody contends that It totally disregards public my opinion. But whichever of these views be correct" gm makes little difference. Whether the price I«»"1," a public in this matter follows it the fact remains BJ that the feeling in favour of the bill, amounting NH many places to enthusiasm, is expressed "It was country inurtialists of New South A. idea in clears go empires c language. Journalists whose it is not confined to Ihogiout jotininlsof bigotry", 09 nhootaomiitiine in their career Imva hall steps to form the multifarious duties involved in the pw H duction of a local paper, know that such course ran are a reflex of local opinion, "»»'"''"^.S M questions in which the interests of their coi«'«»«T* X in concerned. If there were a place in use a rag Wales called Guam, a paper Pubh,»"ia< S M I would consider how federation, or fre'trM»,» pig a -dry burning question would affect ss J M and in small towns and sparsely petite JtM districts, where everybody knows everybody, the public feeling is quickly and accurately grasped Thus we find that the journals of the border districts, while discussing the question from a broad aspect give special emphasis to the point of view that specially applies to their own circumstances Those districts feel more than any other the harassing effects of barbarous border duties, and they are near enough to the citizens of the adjoining state to know that they are people of the same race, and with the same national characteristics The journals of the border districts are strong advocates of federation because the people there know well the advantages it will confer But long established country papers far away from border influences are just as strong in advocating the acceptance of the bill. One point brought out is quite different from the arguments used on the border It has been pointed out that by means of the preferential rates people living in districts between Sydney and the border have to pay more for the carriage of their goals than the people who live 100 miles away, and it is pointed out that federation would do away with this anomaly In fact it is contended that by federation the country would save £300,000 a year which it has to make up for the shortage is differential rates, and it 01 argued that federation would not cost much more than that. It is declared by country journals that whatever be the fate of the bill the country will record a heavy vote in its favour Upon this question the country papers have given some very straight talk. " There is sufficient voting power in the agricultural and pastoral centres to gain the day," was one "the Federal Council has simply proved itself no more than a ghost of a federation," and another, " its 16 years' usefulness, combined with its utter want of effective power, Show fiat federation does not he that by a j 'The road to federation is straight ahead, we must turn neither to the right nor to the left, but vote for the bill and carry it Another papers as -" Every main objection raised to the Convention Bill has been answered Finding that to be the case the opponents have been resorting to those raising of bogeys to frighten the people. It is disgusting to see how ready some people are to sacrifice or prejudice the great cause of Australian union over BOne riddle working objections which have to be sought out as if with a magnifying glass " Another local journal says : " It would not only be a waste of time, but the loss of an opportunity which there is no guarantee may occur again, to cast aside all that has been achieved in the making of a constitu- tion already far superior to any the world knows, and destined by safe, sober, and gradual amendment to be as perfect as the wit of free men in a free community can make it Another country editor writes " The provincialist party is at present making very desperate efforts to keep afloat by making all sorts of misrepresentations It is a pity that no kind friend will throw them a lifebuoy " From the borders to the centre of the colonies the country papers, with remarkably few exceptions, Speak in the same tourist It is a significant fact that the reports from our correspondents of the federation meetings that have been held in various districts during the campaign confirm the declarations of so many of the country papers in favour of the bill, the advocates of union having almost invariably been received with enthusiasm No one whose business or inclination causes him to follow the opinions of the small army of country papers in New South Wales can help admitting that this great question has been discussed by the various winners in a spirit of keen criticism of its details and With broad grasp of its national aspect, leading, with a few peculiar exceptions, to a strong advocacy of the acceptance of the bill Our country press has advocated this great cause with such remarkable unanimity and with such confidence that we must either believe that the country will give an almost solid " Yes," or that our country journalists, practised as they are in feeling the pulse of public opinion, and with a special knowledge of the ir own districts, have by a series of unheard-of coincidences blun- dered in a manner unparalleled in the history of any political movement I
