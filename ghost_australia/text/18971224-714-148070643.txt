HISS BLINKER SCORED. "That Blinker girl is hateful," said the maid with the sunburnt nose. " She is," assented the girl in tl|p Alpine hat; •' hut how —" •' How did I find it out?" said the girl with the sunhqrut nose. " \Vcll, the way I canto to grief with her was this ;—-Wo decided to give a ghost party at our last birthday kiekup." " Some old sheet-and-pillow-case affair, I suppose ? " ■' Nothing of the kind. Vou all sit in a dark room and tell ghost stories in turn. The person who tells the most blood-curdling one gets the prize. Of course, the incidents are all supposed to have happened to you personally. " Of course, I wanted to create a good impression, especially as Harry was there that week, and that Blinker girl was fairly haunting his footsteps. Somehow, I couldn't manage to think or even dream of a good one, though I ate a sapper of beefsteak on : purpose. Finally, tlie very day of the party, I went to see my laundress about my dress—we were all to wear wliite, von know. To my joy, I foundon lier mantel-piece an old, dog-eared book of ghost stories. I borrowed it at once and took it home in triumph.'" " Well, yon were in luck ! " " I thought so then. Well, that evening I told one of the stories—of course, making myself the heroine. " It was a great success, and I felt that the prize was mine, when that, i llliuker girl stopped talking to Harry and hegati to applaud. ' " Then she said—' Oh, how delight ful. And did it really happen to you ? ' '•' Of course it did,' I said. " ' How perfectly charming !' she cried. • My old nurse used to tell me j that story when I was a very little girl, am) I shall ahvavs enjoy it so mnel) more now that I know you are the heroine !' "
