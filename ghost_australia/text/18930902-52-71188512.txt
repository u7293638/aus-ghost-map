Strange Doings at Dubbo. INVISIBLE STONE-THBOWEES. MYSTERIOUS MISCHIEF-MAKING. Considerable interest has been aroused by the report that missiles, auch as brickbats, pisces of ?wood and iron, ecraps of mortar, &c;, were being thrown by uneeen hands at and around a newly erected rosidence in our pleasant suburb, New town, Dubbo. Your correspondent, on inquiry^ found that in addition to these reckless proceed ings strange tappings at the windows, and per formances on tho bell and knocker had varied the source of alarm, no signs of human agency being visible. The disturbance commenced on August 22, and occurred on each of the fellowing three evenings. Flying pieces of brick were also seen in bioaddaylight, at li o'clock in the forenoon, and early in tho afternoon. On several occasions the knockings also occurred in the daytime. The owner removed fche bell, but has replaced it, hoping to have an opportunity of dotecting tho source of trouble. The disturbances have boen witnessed in some phase or another by 15 or 16 people, including members of the police force. On Sunday numbera visited the spot and held consultations over tho scattered miBsi!e3, but no abnormal manifestations took place. Around the enclosure are several patches of shrubby under growth, which would afford shelter to any evilly-disposed persons ; but there appears to bo a total absence of motive, and the phenomena have net abated in con sequence of the efforts to ensure deteotion. Tho explanations and auggestions of vieitorshnve been numerous and combined with the worry of the affair prove embarrassing to the proprietor of the premises, who is not quite sure whether he would not rather have tho ghost alono to contend with. No one hats ween actually struck hythe missiles although narrow escapes have occurred.
