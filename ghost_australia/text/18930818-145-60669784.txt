THE CARn)DSiAR.PERS' DAUGI1TE1R. P love at first, sight be po1sible, I certoinly was in lore with her. It was in my young days, wnen i was visiting Paris for my amusement. I had been strolling about the city nil the morning, and towards noon I found myself in the neighbourhood of ti hFaubourg St. Gennain, when I caught sight of the beautiful unknown. I stood still an she passed me, and our eyes met. Her look was cold and haughty then, and I turned away, feeling rather abashed, and not daring, to follow her. For days and days I lin.I::red about in thae hopie at ertinig lhr again, buht without success; l uilnt atIt i a niade uip my mind that I would try to forget that I had ever .enl hcr, At liilat nit t i the Imadei the ncquaint aince of .AI.

I suggested the same evening, at any lour he pleatsd. "Shall we say nino o'clock then," said he. "And if you will do me the honour to sup with me----" I accepted gladly, and overwhelmed him with a profusion of thanks. What happiness I I should see Annetto--lsould converse witl her, and should be able to strengthen the favourable impression I already believed myself to have made. M.

What did I care for thaLtC Even if I lost a few louis, tihe interview witlh Annettu would more thnn repay theo sacriico. I resolved to humour 31. Verrior for one even. ing at least. The time came, and on my' arrival I wan ushered by my host into a millll and barely. furnilshed roolm, wlcreo a table was laid for two. Our supper was very limnpl ; it consisted of bread, ciceso, and salad, with red wine. Aunetto attended upon us, mixing our salad and pouring oun our wine.

Behind it loomed the mysterious figure in armour, while the Appollo was on my light and the skueleon on my left. .1. Verrier now removed the wrapper from the easel, disclosing to my view an unfinished sketch, in oils, of his daughter Ancltte. Asl gazed at the portrait, a few inco herent expressions of admiration broke from me. iI. Verrier smiled, and drawing up small table towards nme, placed wine and glasses upon it, and took his seat facing Inc. Toe game commenced; we played high, and I seemed to lose about three lhndred frianct in no time. I was ia good player, but I did not pay sufficient attention, to the cards, partly from a desire to indulge my opponent in his humour, but chiefly because mny'thoughts were runninlg upou Annette, and my eyes continually wandering to her ;,i'trait upou the easol. M. Vorrier gtathered up my stake with the cool indilferenco of the veteran game. stor. "It is better to play thus than in com. pany, whcio ,they bet upon the cards and advise you what to play, is it not, monsieur r said lhe. I expressed concurrence; but there was sometlhing in Iis tone that I did not like. Ib seemerl to convey a covert sseer at my want of skill, and I determined to play my very best. I snow won a few games, and MI. Vcrrier for the first time cliulleiged me to bet. I did so, and lost heavily.

A FEW PEOPLE I LOVE.I To love is ons of tie natural propensities of the humani race, and it may he truly said that lafectlon exists, in greater or lessor degrees, in ir.?ny of the domestic animnalR. I offer this sentence as a short introduction to lwhat is to follow, I have always found it very convenient to start out with a sentence or two before following It up with others.' An article which does not do this does nob possess much inherent literary merit. As my oplliing sentence lmpliedly admits, a disposition to Ihtois contrary to all natural Slaw, but 1 have never been able to ascertain what tribunal lias cogisannce of such con-. trarieyity or what penally is affixed wheu a verdict of guilty has boee brought in. : I have never lIhted any one, and I lave Snmado it a poiuntto lavish my aniections on s certain plreorsl, spcailied below, who I know r are in need of my love, because they are not loved.by tho cold world genelrally, .. TlTe person who coles-i in for tlie largest" . share of my pure affection is the man who writes his namoe SO that I can't read it. My n love for this man is unbounded, and so are the eldearing eplithets I bestow upon him. Soinetiils'hlis written name resembles an Suninlishd cil lan of a trestle-work bridge, and somotimes it looks like the path of a forest lire. If we judgo this man by his chirography, he is an enigma, and-we give him up. Thle next person I ardently love without his being aware of it is the individual who asks me if I have read this book or that book, or someo other book, and when I tell bhim I Iiave not, evinces surprise, and regards me as an inferior being. He is a lovable man to me. Then comes tho landlady, who, because I t tice partook of a particular dish, assumes that I am fond of it, and afterlwards passes it to ine frequently, keepa it on the table meal after meal, and informs her friendsand r relations that I all fond of it. Well-mean*. ing lady, she shall never know how I love her I The next in order are the persons of limited intelligence whlo argue the great questions of tho day, and set forth plans for saving the country in my presence. One assorts that the application of electricity to machinery in the place of steam will throw, the mnliers out of employment, and the other declares that it will take jush as much coal to makl the electricity. And so they argue. I wish they would stop long enough for me to toll them hlow I love them. And the rest of my love belongs to the Scolloge girls who invite me outto spend tim evening, and then indulge in mysterious conversations respecting a chum oracquaint. aileC positively unknown to me: They are 1 ood at entertaining-themselves. HE HAD COLD FEET. A nlsoAltnsDn-nous on Cottage Grove. avenue was the theatre of a very unpleasant incident a few ovcnings ago. Ono of the boarders-a young man of about twentyseoven-is a confirmed hypo ohondrinc. Among his multitudinous illa ih is a martyr-at least sO lie says-to cold feet at bed time. A cortain Dr. IIall toll him that people Sso nflected should, before going to bed, bend Sover and smartly slap tlhe calves for about r five minutes. This struck the young man to be about ar saensibln a piece of advice as he had ever hoard. So lhe put It to the test on Saturday i night. Ho bent over and pounded away at Shimnself, and all the time made a inoise with Ills mouth like tim hiss of escaping steamo. Tils loiso atracted tlheo attentlion o onl Sthe boarders, and lie told tih landlady that tlhere must be a firo in that room, because ha could hear Iteiz, and could hear asnapping anda plpphig going on up tlhere. 'he landt lidy didn't pause toi argue. Slhe caught upa pail and pluniged for tlse place at onlco. Th boarder followedl witl a gigantic broom.
