SATURDAY, JUNE 1, 1895. If " honour to whom honour is due " is the motto of the powers which periodically distribute titular distinc- tions throughout the empire, it is well that they should occasionally reconsider what it is which constitutes a basis of claim. In what departments of social activity may a man do work of such value that he deserves national recogni- tion in the shape of a handle to his name? It tin hardlj lie contended that the Pug lish adjudicators havo nlvvajs shown a pniticularlj liberal minti m this îeqaid A professional politician, who may havo been foisted bj lucky circumstanco, and in no sonso bj distinguished talent or tharattoi, into tho moniontirj occu paney of some more or less prominent situation, a partisan whoso brains! mid general worth ho simply m tho puiso which lio rpens at the i demand of his party, theso und othoi | commonplace citt/otis have frequently I reçois ed decorations of thu samo de nomination as those awaidcd to the ¡ heroes of o\ploration, iilnlantliropj, ot . the battle field, nnd to tho geniuses of administration, invontion, 01 tho aits That the worth of n titlo is apt to bo gauged bj its weakest lecipiont is an a\iom which it is shortsighted to i lgnoio in domociatio times On tho other linnd, it is as stiango ni tiavesty that men of the pen, whoso i 8torhng biam vvoik Ins influenced | for good tho thinking and feeling of1 the whole coinmumtj, should bo imsscd j over in fnvout of tho most unlettcied timo set vor who ovot climbed into al commissionoislup 01 a ^poakot's chair It might scorn absurd if tho rioientinos had docoiatcd tho a\erago clmiiman of thou priorato nnd ignored their Dwu , if the Homans had bestowed a hero ditary title on somo Quintus Nemo tho tulile, nml allowed tho cioator of the sLncul to remain plain Puiiiius Vi rgiiius, if tho Gi and Duke of Wfimau had ennobled a but gomaster and loft Herr Ooi un m tho cold Novcitholess, it lins scorned quito natural foi the English nation, tin oil gb its Panic "Ministers, to lavishly adorn the oflicinl nobodj, while it lins doled out a niggaidly and half apologetic locognition to tho makors of its in tollectual and artistic hfo Hitherto "art" has gonorally bcon íecognised in tho solo perron of tho President of tho lîoynl Acadcmj, while it would bo easy to count on tho fingors of one hand the mon of letters who, liko Sir W mur Scon or Lord 'Ilvnison, havo been distill gtushed simply nnd solely ns woikcis in litoratuie lins j ear Su Wunit Br^AM forms nn ngieeablo cxcoption Unfortunately wo do not feel it possible to couplo with his tlio name oi Su Li win Moi ins, foi whoso distinction lim nllogcd poetij is manifestly less íesponsiblo than Ins political opinions Sir W1111111 1 sam himsolt must foti that helms scoied a distinct \ictorj ovor british Pliilistinisin \cat aftei jan, ns mouthpieco of the Association of Authors, ho has clamouied at tho social injustice peipotratcd by tho nation upon .his confintcinity , nnd it is possibly in ! 01 iloi to ud himself of this most 1111 ' poi túnate widowci, that tho hoad of the Government 1ms dolivorod him from tho humblo ranks of tlioso who figure at tho bottom of tho lists of prccodonco as " literary persons, burgesses, etc." Like Sir Henry Irving, the erstwhile Mr. Besant asked plainly tind unequivocally for what ho got, and, though tho satis- fying of all demands is hardly sound policy oven for the most radical, of Governments, it is a matter for con- gratulation that, at loast to this small extent, Lord ltosEBERY could tear himself from tho conflicting claims of prosperous brewers, bakers, and candle- stick-makers, and turn an eyo upon the immensely moro important, becáuso more influential and moro permanent, ?world of letters. For-to put Sir Walter Besaut's contention in our own way-which, in tho name of com- mon-sense, is tho moro valuable to the nation, the rare labour and gonius of the man who sends fino thoughts tingling through the intellects nnd consciences of tho whole population, or the common capacity to adhere to a legislative seat and vote steadily in the right lobby 1 Which contributes moro to the happiness and well-being of tho nation, the diffusion of a noble series of puro and patriotic pooms and stories, or the tenancy of some mayoral chair and tho handing of a silver trowel to a prince who lays a foundation - stono ? Put in these naked terms, the question admits of but one answer. Wo do not profond, any moro than did Mr. Besant, to underrate the high practical abilities of the moro distinguished portion of the recipients of titles. For the most part thoir claim is in some way valid. Wo morely insist upon the equally and often more powerful claim of that class of men of lcttors which Franco or Italy tidorns with ribbons and academic seats, which Germany honours with titles and pensions, which America rewards with ambassadorships and other high places, but which Eng- land has mostly treated as a merely commercial class of public entertainers. Thoro can be no doubt that if Amorica had possosseel othor titles than the all inclusive " Colonol " and " Judge," I Longfellow, Lowell, Emerson, and Holmes would have received thom oven before Congress had managed to snatch the bulk of thom for itself. Of the objections hitherto urged against the decoration of poots, novelists, historians, or scholars thero is only ono which possosses a certain amount of forco. Tho notion that a writer's works will obtain an undue s.ilo in virluo of his title is ovidently base- less. iScotï obtained not ono copy moro of vogue because ho became Sir Walter. People road Thackeray and Dickens because thoso writers were interesting, and if thoy read Lord Lytton it was for tho same reason and no othor. Not a single reader esteemed Tennyson either less or moro because of tho " Lord " upon his title-page. Tho literary name of Lord Verulam is simply Bacon, just as that of Mon- taigne Í3 Montaignj:, while the fact of his boing a marquis counts for nothing. The distinction of a knighthood or a baronotcy is real and valuable in an extra-literary sense ; it gives to litera- ture an unmistakable social recognition; but Sir Walter Besant will bo obliged to writo rather better than worse if his vogue is oven to continuo what it lins been. Tho objection that an eminent writer can well afford to despiso titles is condemned by its own in sincority, and is probably only mado by thoso " radicals by jealousy " who grasp at tho first unexpected opportunity of accepting oven n Companionship. The remaining argument, however, is moro serious. The question arises how tho somewhat invidious selection is to bo mndo among the ranks of men nf letters. Here, indeed, lies tho mix of tho pro- blem. In the case of Sir Walter Besant the choice was easy. Ho is the quasi-official representativo of associated authordom, ns Sir Henry Irving is of Ilistrionia, and as tho president of the Boyal Academy is of tho associated artists. It Í3 rathor in tho case of Sir Lewis Morris, as in that of tho lato Sir John Seeley, that tho danger of obscuring tho issue becomes apparent. Thore wero many contemporary historians and writers of greater knowledge, nnd with vastly moro work to show, than Seeley ; but had not Seeley dovotod his com- paratively slight productions to tho political cause of Imperial Federa- tion, whilo other historians woro content to write conscientious his- tory? Thero aro a dozen and one verso-writers-though nono of tho first rank-who aro incontestably suportar to tho amiable gentleman who inscribes his own lines in gold on his own walls at Penhryn ; but has not Sir Lewis Mounts stood for Parliament in tho Liberal interest, whilo other hards have boen contont with striving to write genuino poetry 1 Wo do not dony that Seeley desorved a knight- ¡ booti, wo only point out that if tho distinction was conferred for emiuenco in historical writing, tho dioico was an injustice to the momory of Freeman and to tho work of Froude. Thero soems to bo but ono course opon for tho oven-handed dis- tribution of literary distinctions. It is to mako thom dopend not upon tho unaided choice of politicians, but, as in Mr. Besant's caso, upon tho position practically assignod by corporato anti learned bodies. Tho recognised head of competent and well-accredited associations and in- stitutions, literary, learned, and scien- tific, moy assuredly bo " dis " tinguished " with as much fre- quency and as much safoty as the temporary head of a city corporation or a transient provincial government. How far laws will shapo social habits is ono of tho vexed questions of political scionco. Many simplo people, indeed, chorish a suporstitious respect for an Act of Parliament. Magical virtues slumber within it. ATicos elia-1 appear boforo the mardi of its heavy footed sentences ; virtues spring to oxistonco under its solemn breath. It, is the modoru equivalent of tho mirado-1 working power claimed l*y meeliiuvnl saints. It can, with n few drops of ink, change the physiognomy of socioty and alter tho constitution of man. A grout social mischief has only to bo solemnly invited to disappear by¡ Act of Parliament, and simple-minded j crowds imagine thnt it will moekly botako itself lo somo other planet. Poverty can bo dismissed into spueo by one Act of Parliament, ignoranco by another, pain itself by a third. A pathetic boliof in the magic of Acts of Parliament is, indeed, tho sccrot why ono sot of simpletoiiH is always demand- ing und nnothor sot is always passing them, Sidney Smith said of nu enthusiastic attempt to remedy nonio evil of his day by statuto that it was Uko trying to make a man standing on tho floor of St Paul's laugh by tickling the dome j and Ins figure, alas . oxnctly descubc3 the practical result achíes ed by a good many w oil meant bits of legis lation Peihaps the most signal illustration of the failuie of laws to chango social habits is supplied by the drink traffic of all countries All sensible mon admit tho mischief of tho excessive uso of alcoholic drinks, and nil civihsod governments put the drink traffic undet Mgilant restraint An almost pisstonato erusado against the dunking habit genoially is maintained by powerful soeioties The Acts of Paihament passed in ono country 01 another duriug tho last thirty years to abridgo-if not extinguish-the admitted ovils of tho dunk traffic would constitute in them selves a considorablo library But what havo they all effected t Evidence is multiplying upon overy hand of tho almost completo failuie of what is called tempeianco legislation to i educo tho v olumo of the drink tialhc In New Zealand, after yeais of tomperanco agitation, a bundled temperance ' viotoues," and half a do/en local option nets, tho aveiago consumption of drink has boen reduced by about sixpence poi head E\cn tho dis appeal ince of that solitary nobbler, it may bo added, is quite as probablj due to hatd timos tis to temporáneo lomsla tion Mr Gl mistoui , a short timo ago, íoduced all English teetotallers to the vorgo of molo blasphomy by do clnring that local option-" the idol of " Parliament for tho last twenty years " is, if ptetonding to tho honour " of a remedy [for cxcessivo drink 1 mg], littlo bettei than an un "postuto" And tho expouenco of these colonies certamlj sustains that unpleasant verdict 'Ihe many Acts of Parliament passed and polls taken to reduce the yeaily volumo of drink con filmed have had about os much effect as the twittering of a number of sparrows might havo upon, saj, the flow of tho Ganges Theannual "drink bill " may havo slightly sluunk, for tho pneo of dunk has fallen , but it may bo doubted if tho sum total of drinking is re duced Peihaps tho most stukmg example of the utter failure of what may bo called dunk legislation is a tomaikablo set of statistics lust issued as an English state piper andrcflocting in expressiv o figures tho fluctuations of the dunk trnlhc m England during tho last Unity jeais Hie ordinary îeadei does notwillinglj commit himself to a 'vojago tlnough chaitlcss seas of statistics such these, jet then value is un deniabl" 'lhoy îeflcct tho social duft, at this point, for a. wholo generation 'lhoy show that the change of what may bo called tho dunk standard of Great Butam duung the last thuty vears, when oxprcssod m the terms of the multiplication table, is absolutely ml \\\ o caunot find space, of couiso, for the gicat chaits and dingiams which show this, but wo givo tho figures for tho lust foin years and the Inst four years of tho peuod covcied - litci i Wiles aid S| hits.

The breeze sprang up at the ordinary meeting of the Marine Board, when explana- tions were received from Pilots Russell, Dow, Nicholson, Campbell, and Mitchell as to their respective absences from duty on board the schooner Rip on the outside Station at the end of March last. Ominous mutterings of the coming storm were first heard right ahead from Captain Fullarton, the chairman, and in a few moments squalls burst from Captain Currie, Mr Rennie, and Mr Dickins on the port side of the board room, veering round to starboard almost immediately, and blowing with extraordinary violence from the direction of Messrs Cowper, Belfrage, and M 'Farlane. It appeared that the régulations of the Marine Board lay it down that there must be six pilots on duty on the outside schooner but the pilots them selves have occasionally preferred the seclusion of Queenscliff to the dis- comforts of the cruising ground, "where the stormy winds do blow-ho ho," and this was the cause of all the trouble. Pilot Mitchell forwarded a doctor's certificate dated, according to the chairman, two months after the event, to the effect that he was unable to remain on board as he was suffering from cystitis, which Mr. Dickins obligingly explained was a form of internal inflammation. Of the other four alleged delinquents two excused themselves on the grounds that they had no means of getting aboard the schooner, and two sheltered themselves under their " working regulations," of which the members of the board professed utter ignorance. Finally it was decided that Pilot Mitchell should be summoned before the board and censured by the chairman, Captain Currie intimating that the chairman should speak some "strong words ' to him.
