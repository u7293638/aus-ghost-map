?3Toral ^nirUigpnri?. COOMA ATHLETIC SPORTS. (In Queen's liirlhdny, a goodly number nf people congregated in front of Mr. David O'Rourke's, the Australian Hotel, to witness thu sportt. The entries (re reived thn lireviuns fvcuiiiL'^ for the Imudicnps were op'iied e«rly in the morn inn by Mr. 0. \V. 8|.ring, who under lool; iho duties of lion Rfcrelary. Tho fitewaids comprised Messrs. .1. S. Garrott nnd E. O'Biien, with the secretary. To V.r. II. K. J. Simousnn was confided Ihc honor of jndu?. All of tho nflk-inls gnvo ninrl;i-d Fatisfaction. Mr. K. O'Brien whs t=lartcr, and it was a real pleaMiro to bc'p him put off tho competitors in the liaudicii,! : llictc was not n false start, Mr. O'lirien having quilted himself in '^porting xtylp. Tho convincing' ground wiis measured from (lie front of Tuii Manaiio Mieiu'Uiiv offico to th« Coinmer cial Uanlc. Now, as to the running, wo expected llm great gun of Sfanaro to ste(i it tint riirht in the 200 yards handicap ; liul , tmmehow, T)unu won, nnd that it nil we can say aboiil that spurt. Tlie Maiden Platers went in a perishcr; bnt tho winner's legs were .' Oner' long for his opponents, and the second one had not sufficient propelling ' Power' to tend himself to tlio front. A son of Vulcan put his best foot foremost — by-the-bye, the Snowy lliver peds. are rather d«ngorons ' — and he came in third Maiden Plater ; so George lives to fight another day. Maloney stucied the uspirjinlg for tint ivinning post ; nud Ely (in blue and while) must have changed his niiinlsfter entering, for he stood Hi ill, nud enjoyed a bird's eye view of the running. There was sonio talk of protesting jifrflinsl Owcr brcanso he had previously won a race in town for youths under 10, hut the matter was not pushed. Tlione who hud entered for (ha 200 vards himdican coiisenled, nl tbe request of tin; htowards, to nialci! the race an ojien one, nnd the winner of tbe Maiden Piste, gamely riilrivd the liels. U kii« ii capital rare brlween Dunn and Ivlirnrds, but the former Cnl. scratch) just ennqueied tbe lattiM- (S yaids). Tho Youth's Uftce under 14 did come d(T; Uau'son punished Tmn Spring, whose nninn is rather more mggi'Rlivi1 of Tom Sayer's circle than of thn pedestrian; tin little representative of St. Cii'pen waxed warm, but Iho race was declared before he got over his ground. Some of tho races Ml through. Tbe best event on the cards.- was the hnndicnp foot race of 150 yards, thero being four competitors. Kdwavds was at sciiitcb ; Davis had an allowance of 7 van's. Like all the other races, no one could wish for a prcltior start ; all hounded! ofC simuiliiiiMoiisty, except ThomiiR O'Urien, who must have gone lo sleep, and wuko up when it was loo late. Near Messrs. ilali and Dunn's, Edivards drew up to Davis, sifter which it was warm work, and the judge declared a (lead-heiit, Maloney being -next. The doad- bvulerc, to the disappointment of many, decided to divide. In (ho racu for youths under I ft, T. Davis was n (ride too much for tho other two runners. A really good race, perhaps us good as any— foe, !ij;c all all the handi caps, Ilio stewards hsd acted with con siderable judgment — was tho Ust on the piogramrne, tlio Forced Haedicap, a spin of 200 yards for all winners. Davis hud quite a task before him, hut he overcame all obstacles to his »vinniug, Sfaloney being well up ns second, nnd Dawsmi 'a good third. Oivers had not the ghost of a chance. Dunn and Edwards did not start. The prizes were paid over at tho finish of this race by 'Mr. Joseph O'RonrJfO, The order of tbe racing is annexed: — Maiden Pinto of 100 jrtrdi, for all runnel'* (li*t had never won an advei 4ised prizo ; £1. ?W.Oirrr ? ,'. ? ,. i 0.-iirj;o I'own- ? .. , J ocoikc Hiiiipv ? ;;. „? ? ; '.,3 li-.w.cn™ Uillnnrv .. ° 4 Eli sinitmnn ? ; ? !!.!!i.i.».i!'.!!'!.. o . .
