THE GREAT SPEECH- ! ; "We dbn't - often tiouble ' the Parliament ; Hoxise 'with our presence ; but last Friday night,! as the. leader of the Opposition,. Mr. Parkes, was announced to speak his i great oration on: the Education question, in Opposition to ' 'Mri' Dibbs' tootibxij ' we coxild npt resist indulging the desire - to hear for ..ourselves, and not trust -to the; reporters. We nave a clear remembranoe1 of; Mr. Parkes' great efforts in '1866-7, when he roused :the country in His, favour, and carried; in thei- House the- Public Schools' Act. - Wc - have a distinet recol lection, of how, lie bore down all opposition fropi the priesits add, parsons who opposed his secular: bili ",, and. wished denomina- tionalismj ! with ifaots and figurOs which left his enemies1 high arid :dry. ' We ! have also a very Uvbljjr . recollection of how, Mx\ , Parkes ? felt; indignant, : .disgusted, and1 almost inclined to abandon 1 the bill, in its progress5 through the Hpuse, when1 he: . fdhnd'to!His. .w$k was nipdi&ied; by the, dononiiriationalists , . in effecting . that the numbers in'a denominational- school should he thirty instead of forty. All this we personally knew, and rnore we knew with what a fif in hand Mr._ Parkes, as President of the Council1 bf Educatibri' for tllb' hrst yeax-s of its history, kept the bishops and priests-at bay iri -theif desire' tci administer the1 Act' fori their own d'enominationa! puiv poses, !

It .was, another piece of ;the by-play of I Mr. Parkes to talk of tlie Act as having I raised' .the. quality of' ; the education given I bdth "!to" the teachers . arid . the HcKolai-s.

' v TV/hat made the House laugh, was " the zeal;of Mr.: Parkes against the "bigoted ' secularist- and the bigoted disbeliever in religion;" The Devil i& becoming /"an ' angel of light " since his niajesty has, taken to the " reproyal of sin."' The gentlemen of ;tlie League . need sackcloth and ashes for their "intolerance /and, bigotry," sinco Mr. Henry Parkes .has, felt! it to be. his duty , to tell theni that: they are /. secularists " and - s that tliey. are " bigoted disbelievers" in rill k religion 1 1 ,/ f Mr. parkes will gejfc '//the tgrajiiitrido of Dr. Vaughan and probably.ofMr.Dunoan, 5 since : he - has- quoted 'that ;; grerit author (Mr.1 Parkas1 never -/reads ari/. biit great authors) j ".Mr.!
