SOMETHING LIKE A GHOST. A ghost story has been excitiug some atten tion at Sti-athalbyu (South Australia), con cerning which a well-known resident writes to the local Press as follows : â€” " Whilst taking a walk very early one morning, through some motive which I cannot accouut for, I was induced to walk througu a certain bury- ing-ground, and coming to a grave surrounded by a wall and covered with a slab of slate, I noticed on the slate something strange. It was scarcely light enough to see distinctly at first, but after waiting some few minutes I could see it plainly, and it appeared to be a side view of a female. I could distinctly trace the head and body and the skirts, apparently fall size. Not being satisfied with the sight I rubbed my hand on the form, and found that portion of the slate was perfectly dry, whilst the parts outside the form were very wet with the dew which had fallen, and still not being satisfied I walked away, and came back in about fifteen or twenty minutes afterwards, and still the form was there, so I determined upon visiting it again next morning, which I did and continued doing so for a week or more. . During this time I only saw the form once after the first morning ; but not being a believer in supernatural ap pearances I tried to define the cause, but failed. In the course of conversation I told Mr Morton what I had seen, aud he visited the place and saw the form, although not so plain as it was when I saw it. The form was to be seen, and it has been seen since by others. Now, I believe there is some natural cause which produces this strauge appearance, and per haps some person upon reading this will be able to satisfy tho minds of those who saw it, although many things have been advanced by people as the probable cause, but none that seems satisfactory to my mind and those who have been eye-witnesses of the sight."
