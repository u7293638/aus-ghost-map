CHAPTER 71. GB3_E HHCETS G3EEK. . , ; Now, doubtless, Mra. Grnndy -would count it a most disreputable proceeding that -Catherine Iredale, in the first days of her tragic widowhood— -even though ?unbereaved, because unloving — should have been thus beguiled into any, inter est, tar less any discussion about sub jects alien to her melancholy situation, ? As to Philip Lester's heartless and and indecorous disregard of the eti quette of grief in proposing- any. topic not in strict harmony -with tho. dismal crape draperies of his fair patient — well, there's no telling what severity of criticism that did not merit. Mrs. Grnndy is far too proper a person to 'make allowance of expense i'or the 1 ' ncediof light, and warmth, and fresh \-- ness that the poort pale prisoner within ' the double walls of gloom and horror nvnsfi have had, or for tho eager thirst with which the sad lips, wearied of their draughts of gall, must have (Juaffed the cup of reviving sympathy and pleasantry that youth held to youth. But we, dear reader, are not created ?with Dame Grundy's cup of prqpriety, and can understand poor Eatherine.s enjoyment of brave, true, honest-souled Philip Lester's incidental and diverting . talk.

It is an hour past noon, and tho time fixed for Mr. Kenrict to make an official record of tho dead man's will, and Eatherine listened restively for tho arrival of the lawyer and the notary, for there was a purpose in her mind that -_ept her unquiet. ? *r_ VJThe_ moment that Mr. Kenrick has ? finished his business in the library, ' Manton, show Win into my room,' she -.. ^rhad said to tlie footman v/hosoi diity^it 1 ?
