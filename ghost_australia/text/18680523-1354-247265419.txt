' - A rfiENCH EOMANCEi A PEW- monthsngo a young shopman;in tone of the. leading'houses jn Paris saw ayoutig lady,fintpr, . to whom, -,duriiig the past eight or ten days,Tie had sold a number of dresses^ shawls, gloves, <fcc. By her accent he sur-j rmieed" that^be Inusfbl a NeW'Tork lady. The' stranger was very pretty, and naturally the young man made himself agreeable and at||ntive'. 1 she visited the shop she addressed herself to him; and, while examining! ihe^-articles he placed before her, talked inuch'. The day- we speak of she was less- Communicative'than usual; and, after having, made a somewhat hurried selection, she'said.to the clerk:—I shall be at my hotel in one hour; here is the address. Be kind enough to accompany 4he porter wheu he beings those ^rt^es." • -With these words she* <bowfid reservedly, - and hastily left the shop. The young man was at a loss what to think. However, a,n hour later, he entered the apartment of the American lady who invited him, without ceremony, like au acquaintance of long standing, - to lunch with her. Although thinking his customer's manners somewhat . strange, the clerk accepted. While partaking of the repast, the lady somewhat abruptly addressed her guest, saying, "Sir, you are gallant enough to protect a woman against any insult to which she might be subjected? Answer me with truth and candor " " Without conceit, I say .yes," answered the young man. " Very well. Tou work in order to make money. Is it not so P" " Certaiuly." "This is what'I wish to propose. I am alone, or almost, alone, in the world.;, my fortune or my actions concern no one but myself ; I wish to see the exhibition; and know Paris. But X perceive that there is nothing more difficult than for a woman to be in your country without, a protector. Tou please me, and, if you do not object, you shall be my' companion. I will r6pay you for your lost time." The youiip man tried to" speak, but she immediately resumed; "I insist on remunerating you; this is strictly a matter of business; I,regard it in .that, light. Accept or decide. What^liall it bp?" "I accept," answered the clerk; afterV^m'o'ment's hesitation. " I atd'satisfied,"continued the stranger, "that you are an honorable young mau, and will ifofc' make,^yourself ridiculeiis- by 'making love and flattering me, forjl warn you that the very first compliment you pay me ends our contract. Is it agreed?"^..".Mfjtdam, I ajn alt your service." ; " From to-morrofif ?" ''"Froin this moment!. I require only-time to ;write,to my^mployer^." And the terms of this extraprain^jfeompact were entered iu^be letter." ^flio^cierk was charming; he proved, himself intelligent, attentive, delicate, without all that small-talk which meu generally delight to inflict on woman. In fact, the American lady was truly delighted with the choice she had "made. A fortnight afterwards she'.handed the amiable clerk» roll of bank notes, and they separated, mutually pleased with ea.ch other. But it happened that, as the lady was 'about to proceed to England, thence to binb'arjc for America, a commissioner hastened tpwards her, and inquired if she was Miss .Upon her answering in the affirmative; he placed a small box and a letter in her' hand. 'j The box contained a set of diamonds, the'letter a few ,words only,' but feo well chosen as to express true affection that .the young lady started, mt' for London, : 'but'back'to her hotel'iii' Paris:'- Wis iieedle'^s[ t6 say that the letter watf' from the young clerk, who had taken this method of returning the monej forced "uponTiim by the young lady fog service rendered* /She Bentgtor inquire for him.- He had not given her his address; aii<l he "had not returned to his former employer. ^ Ultimately she learned that he had taken in another house a situation far inferioT ito the one he had formerly- occupied. She wrote; he came at. once. They wprersoon afterwards married. .• '•'• A Boad Sr^i.MEB.-T-pne'object of interest has been ockasionaHy-' travelling on the roads between Leith and' Edinburgh for a few H weelcs p^st, which'; pft'njeWfcure will continue to be an ptijeci ^ of historical interest for thfe' tipi^'l .^ve'talpntioned. : "It is <what ; 5b called abroad 'steafrifei-j a machine like'a' smallfailway -engine set upon three wheels; "one in front ^nd two,,behind the middle—^. rii fephin^;w-felgjiiri^ 9 fiye.''t -, arne of dirii&ing; sixty tons at a slow pace on good roaTd," btgoirig over the "roughest road aud- climbing.. the steepest, and travelling over •ploughed" land or the like with the most, y perfect ease.

A Startling Incident of Bailway TftAVELBTNG.— As a. train was , approaching "Peoria, IlL, lately, the prairie was discovered to be on fire for-miles around. The flames leaped up to the height of thirty feet, and spread for Beven or eight 'miles ap- parently. The train ran directly through the belt of the flame, which extended across the track. Th'e'heat was intense, but the current of air caused by the motion of the train prevented the cars from being the least blistered. The passengers on the train say it was a .spleiididtsi^ht.— A Stage Ghost.—A. humourous story of- a -stage gTiost is told iil Rainond's " Life of Elliston," aided by an illustration from the etching needle of George Cruikshanlc, executed iu quite his happiest manner. Dowton, the actor, performing a ghost part —to judge, from Ihe illustration, it must have been ihe ghoBt in " Hamlet, " but the teller of the story does not say formally that such was thd fact—had, of course, to be lowered in the .old fashioned ivay through a trap-door in the stage, his face being turned towards the audience. Ellistou and' De Camp, coecealed beneath the stage, had provided'themselves with small rattau .canes, and as their brother actor ^slowly and solemnly deecenHed/they applied tliir sticks sharply and rapidly to the calves of his, legs,'unprotected bv the plate arinour that graced his shine. Poor Dowton with difficulty preserved his gravity'of couutenauce, or refraiued from the utterances of a yell of agony while iu the presence of the audience. His lower limbs, beneath the surface of the stage, frisked and curvetted about " like a horse in Duerow's " arena." His passage below wae inajifciously made as deliberate as possible- At length, wholly let down, and completely out of sight of the audioes, (he looked'round' the obscure regions'beneath the staged to • discover the perpetraors of the . tmtrage.; He was: speechless \vith-rage fipd.ibHrniug for revenge.
