Some few persons who affect to see a trifle farther into a milestone than their neighbours, say that Mr. AngeQ hi3 sot a ** clinker'* in Hhodz7m/mtad& irho has been tried to be 'two stone better than AI cibiade,' the winner last year. One of the Irish division informed 'me not a week ago that they had got on ths other ride of the Channel 'tha best horse thatj,ev«r stsrted for it f but as my informant was unable or unwilling to communicate to me the name of the wonder in question, I received the intelligence ' cum yrano talit.n Death has again been busy- amanzst the sporting men this month, both of high and low degree. Very soon, indeed, after General Charritie, with whom, although a few years his junior, he was contempo raneous, that kind-bearted, cheery, and thorough good sportsman, Captain John White, was taken from among us. Born some ten years before the commencement of the present century. Captain White has been taking a prominent pan in sporting matters uii i*iuuu uxe i2£^ lew mouuLa. xor up wards of half a century the name of John White has been associated intimately with every description at sport We find him credited with a winning mount as a gentle man rider some 43 years since, but when he was himself fast approaching that indistinct stratum in the human existence known as 'middle-aged,' for he was ux-wards of five and- thirty. Then he wa3 an 'old Mel toaian,' in the days of Assheton Smith and Osbaldeston, ' when theie were giants in the ^land,' and when those neroa found a worthy Thucy dides in 'Nimrod' to record their feats. In early life Captain White hid a perfect passion for hunting, and no one could go better than he did, while few understooof the beauties and the niceties of the ' noble science' so well as he did. A nice weight, a fine honeman, withacapital head-piece, and great determina tion 'at a finish, there was not a gentleman jockey of his day more eagerly sought after than Captain White, but his performances in this line were, I believe, confined to 'the flat, t as he never rode across country except in the legitimate manner, is., when there was a pack of hounds before him. As a master of hounds he gave great satisfaction during several seasons that he retained the management of the Cheshire. ' Some forty years ago, when old George the Third was king,' cock-fighting was a popular diversion and ' Jack Black?' — as his friends used to call him— merry phiz was as welcome and as constantly to be found at the cockpit as by the cover-side or the racecourse. The memoirs just published of the sportin; Cheshire squire relate that he was wont to boast that he had done everything except go up in a balloon, and that w_s very nearly coming off, as he had on one occasion promised to escort a young lady on an aerial excursion, but at the last minute ' ' mnrPTn^ ' put iu her veto, and the Captain was compelled to ' pay forfeit' Of late years Captain White has turned his at tention ahnostexclusivelytoraoagmatters, and although his 'pink and black' jacket has never oeenr particularly lucky, he has been connected with some of the leading stables of these latter days,' to their benefit, no doubt, as well as to his own. During Mr. Naylor's brilliant but brief blaze of triumph, who : should lead back Fen-de-joia and Ifaccaroni, after they had respectiy carried off the Oaks and the Derby, but Captain White. After this, but before ? Godding's train had besrunto 'pale their ineffectual fires,' he transferred the benefits of his skill and ex perience to Lord Stamford's stud, and here we find the only page in a sportsman's life of f onr-score years, which ; we could wish expunged, ' Demortuiinil niribonum,' but one cannot help regretting that John White's name was ever mixed up with the very questionable re- purchase of Cambuscan and Archimedes at Lord Stamford's mysterious ?f'Beserred Sale.' ; John White u gone,bow ever, and few such good sportsmen are left behind. : : ; ' ?

All obstacles to sfeeplechising in the im mediate vicinity of the metropolis, excepcins such as result from the natural humidity of the climate of the Bririfh Isles, the ' Harrow Spring Meeting' was brought off on the loth and 16th inst. under the.fosterinz auspices of those veil- known officials Mt&£?3. V'errelJ, Marshall, and M'George. The oppoang in fltxeaces were the rain and the m-,id whkh, the latter especially, was 'a caution,' though it did not deter the youthful Duke of Hamilton from mAinfr his ddiui on this the dassic ground of steeplechaang, railing to mind is it does visions of Lottery, Gaylad, Jerry, poor old Ehnore, the elegant 'Jem Mason {3 :id to be in a bad state of health, poor felloe), and a host of other quadrupeds and bipeds. A brown geld inr, by BoUnabroke, won the Harrow Plate ? oa the first day, Princess Dagmar,be£adfuHypiIotedbyG-eor£eHolman, running very gamely and well, but she was unaole to give away a stone to a great power ful horse like the Bolingbroke gelding, par ticularly in such deep ground. On the Friday Bolingbroke was entered for tha Selling Hunters' Stakes, to be sold for 50 kite. He won this easily, and after the race was knocked down to Sir. J. Page for 220 guineas, Mr. Stebbinga, under the new rule ef racing, gettiiig one'-half the ex cess of the price, or about £S3 ! With the exception of Arlescott, they were a sorry lot that went to the post to oppose Princess Dagmar, in the Open Cha-e, and as he fell and injured himself so badly as to bring his racing career to a close, there was really nothing at last to oppose the Princess, who won as she liked, Johnnie finishing second, and The Rogue third. The rest of the events were mere leather-flapping. After one of the mildest winters on record, Jack Frost put in an appearance on the 17th inst, Lincoln being fixed for Tuesday, the 20th. Of course everybody said it was 'just like the Lincoln luck,' and prophesied boldly that, as was the case last year, the racing would have to be postponed. Happily the visitation was in a very mild form, but still it continned on Sunday, the ISth, and following day, and it was only a telegram from Lincoln to the Londoners saying that the races were sure to come off, and that the weather had bees much less severe in Lincolnshire than iu the metropolis, that induced the southern division to make a move. As it turned out, there was nothing the matter to interfere with the running, and the different events were decided on the ap pointed days, commencing with the Trial on Tuesday morning, the 20th inst., for which Old Warden and Alberta were spotted, but the bookmen drew first blood, for Foberfs Wise Man, by Oxford out of Wise Woman, won easily. Then followed the Brockleaby, the first two-yr-old race of the season, and for this two-and- twenty runners weie saddled ; Captain Christie's filly, by Dundee out of Sacrifice, with Jemmy Grim sbaw wearing the white jacket, was the fa vourite at 3 to 1, and a sweet blood-like mare to look at she is ; the next in public estimation was Mr. Chaplin's filly, Problem, by Xewmiiuter out of Triangle, at 100 to 15. Oddly enough both of these favourites were bred by Mr. Blenkiron, at Eltham, the Sa crifice filly having been purchased last year for 120 guineas; whileProblem caused 700 to be 'worked out' of Mr. Chaplin's bankers' hands. Money was served this time,' however, as Problem landed tho Brocklesby after a most desperate race, a result as much owing to the fine riding of Custance, in my opinion, as to anything else. Mr. Chaplin resides at Blankney, near Lincoln, and 'the natives' were up roarious in their delight at his success. The Lincolnshire Handicap had caused a considerable amount of very brisk specula tion, and the rush to ott on the Danebury Champion, Copenhagen, was 'prodigious.' You might have supposed ' it was over,' so enthusiastic was everybody to put down ponndai shillings, 'and pence on him, at tho best price they could get for him, let that bo what it might Old Saccharometer, Mr. Hodgman's quondam Derby nag, Valiant^ Kast Lyone, and Caithness in the f9rn^ stable xi r-r*-?»- ii» wiasr cs hoi yttrs Dais, I wae i-» bx.&*t£, bn if yea *&&£ a £&=- | ?fesrssssi cgnini cc ettcoj lioci eiSiir c£ « tha=_ iieis-ri^siuf xz&riz-ns;,.

On Monday O'Baldwin, who stands 6 ft. 7 in., and weighed I44 stone, met George Hes, who stands only G ft. 14 in., and weighed 12st 101b. After fight ing seven minutes the peelers interfered, and the whole pine oamitatws had to betake itself to town and organise an impromptu trip down the river, wnere a fresh ring was speedily formed, and two more rounds were fought, which occupied 30 - minutes. By the end of this time O'Baldwin had knocked Des ' into a cocked hat.' The latter, who took his punish ment like a brick, did his best, but he hadn't a ghost of a chance with 'the best bis 'un we've had out for years.' O'Baldwin is universally regarded as the coming champion, for there seems to be no would have the slightest chanre with him. Rooke ant} Ryall met again oa Thurs day last to try and adjust their differences, and to find out which was the better man, but after taking 3} hours to fisht nine rounds, and neither seeming capable of inflicting any seriuos damage upon the other, or of gaining any de finite advantage, although both were quite exhausted and thoroughly chilled, it was agreed that they should each draw their own stake, which was done, amid great cheering at the pluck and science whichboth men had displayed. 31ace and Goss still continue to make good their deposits, and O'Baldwin has challenged Marsden, by whom he was beaten some years ago.
