INSPIRATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE COURIER. Em,-" Philo" does not seem to understand the difference between misquoting a text and quoting a part of it. The divisions of the Bible Isto texts and chapters are of human origin, and often disturb the line of thought. For this reason tbey ars prac- tically Ignored In tbe new revised versioa. Ia my recent letter I did not misquote a single Scripture, bat for the sake of brevity I did correctly qaote a few well-known portions, which, II taken alone, or In connection with their context, folly prove the Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures. 2 Peter, L, IB, was a typographical error, and " Phllo" sarely knew this as well as I did. It not be could have easily toned It np In the concordance, asd would then hare found tbat it night to have read 2 Peter, I., II, so thot in passing It by with tbe remark, " there Is nothing like it in the text named," and on this ground charging me with " fabricating errors," he is, to say the least, neither honest nor courteous. ' For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, bnt holy men ot God spake as "they were moved by tbe Holy Ghost," is the testimony of this verse, and Is worth more than a cart-load of Infidel rubbish; If " Philo " Is an earnest seeker after troth (which I am beginnlsg to doubt), I should sd vise blm to consult some of the maay Bible com. mentaries, hand-books, Ac., when he will find his elementary difficulties tally noticed and solved. As to the Bible Itself— " It Is tbe Book of God. What it I should •ay God of books f Let him that looks Angry at tbat expression as too bold, His thoughts in silence another TU1 he find such another." —Yours, &S.;, S J.B.C.
