EXPLORATION OF CENTRAL ASIA. An expedition to explore the buried cities ol Central Asia is being talked of in Bombay and elsewhere in India. That treasures like those at Macena* may be found in the sands of Mongolia is at least possible. If tradition be of any value— a tradition, too, which has persistently clung to one locality through the Jopse of centuries — the tomb of Gheuzig Khanisyeti with ite fabulously rich treasures, to be found (as Colonel Prejevalsky was told by the Mongols) to the south of Lake Tabasun Nor. Within the tomb lies a mau who seems asleep. Every evening a sheep or a hoi'se is tied near to the spot, aud lo ! in the morning the animals have been eaten. In three hundred years^say the Mongols, the sleeper will awake, and lead couutless hosts of his chiMreu to victory and dominion. This old 6tory is said to be circulating more and more widely every year. Then the Mongols say tbat constantly the drifting sauds disclose, here aud there, gold aud silver trea sures, which they have a superstitious dread of touching. The Imried cities under the sands of the Gobi are affirmed to be mines of incalculable wealth, guarded by gnomes and fearful spells, while all the deserts around tiie iiidden rnius are peopled by myriads of howling ghosts. The sands of the deserts of Central Asia regularly move and drift from east to west, aud even now th^ eastern borders.of deserts are being denuded widely of all soil that can be torn away by the violent winds.
