OLD-TIME DATS. I By James Buckham.] I can see the river gliding, as it used to long ago, Round the shoulder of the meadow where the thick-set willows grow. I can hear it purl and ripple in a gentle lullaby. To a little barefoot dreamer gazing up into the sky. Tonder lie the brown old farmhouse orown'd with chimney huge and square, And the barn beloved of swallows with its weathercock in air. I can h6ar the river ripple bleed with cow-bells from the hill, And the far-off clang and rumble of the log frame in the mill. Howl loved to lie a-dreaming in the deep and quiet grass While I watched the ghosts of nooaday through the fields of heaven pass ! I was happy — oh, so happy ! — while the purl ing of the stream Seemed to weave a little poem for the music of my dream. Oh, to taste once more the pleasure that I knew in years gone by, When my heath was full of sunshine -as the summer morning sky ! Oh, to feel tha* outdoor gladness when the days were fresh and long, And the bluebird climed to heaven on the ladder of his song !
