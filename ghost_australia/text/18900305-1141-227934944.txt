Boxing Tournament at Crystal Palace. Bill,— I with, through the medium of your valuable and jiupulnr paper, to receive, «n be- «J parties interested, a Jitllc inforn a ion regarding the box ng tournament advertised to take place shortly in the Crystal Palace, Ricnmond. We have watched i BE hfoiiTKMAN and other pap/T, aud it appears that no particulars or conditions whatever have been advertised, excepting the manner in which tbe stakes are to be divided. In the first place we want to know if the recognised standard weight, viz., not exceeding 20»t far light, list 4lb and under for miodle, and 12t and over for heavy ueiglits will be strictly adhered to.aod whether thip, or any club nf a similar nature, can in any way alter these so called standard weights Secondly: If anv restrictions are to be put on professionals. By professional I mean all the wi-H-knowu borers who continually appear at the diffetent boxing ealjons in the city and suburbs. Tbey consider it would have been more satisfactory to all concerned had the gi utlemen who have 0 liberally given tbe money if stated definitely whethertlie contest is to be an open one without ar.y restrictions or not. Personally, 1 know at least half-a-dozen voung liahda in my neighborhood who would have entered, but bate not dune ao, emsider' icg they would not have a ghost of a " show ' hboitld they be pitted atrainst thcBe old stagers. — ouis, uc.
