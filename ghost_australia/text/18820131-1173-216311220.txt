Cricket, CBOSS ROADS V EAST MOONTA RISING STAB. A match was commenced between the above named clubs on Saturday, January 21st, on the ground of the latter, and concluded on Saturday January 28th. It resulted in a hollow win for the latter, much agaiust the opiuion of the former before the commencement of the match. The former won the toss and took the field and had to keep it for the whole of the first day. J. Johns's score of 69 was not a bad feat with the exception, of his allowing the ball to scrape acquaintance with the air on two or three occasion*. 3.Morton,the captain,came second with 33 and not out. and without giving a ghost of a chance. His cutting was very hard and clean and by his play of late he bids fair to be a first class cricketer. When the Cross lloads men commenced batting they had a faint hope of averting a follow on, but they were sadly disappointed as Hayes and Butson proved too many for them, the foimer securing 6 wickets for 2 runs and the latter 5 f. r 7 runs in the first innings. In the second innings they put together a very creditable score of 67 agaiust such bowler^ us Hayes and Butson, that leaving ttiem defeated iu one innings and 107 ruus to spare. Subjoined are the scores. RISING HTAH Captain J. M <rton. Umpire Mr. Morton. Butson thrown out 20 Johns c Nankiveil b Bennetts 6'J; Luke c B.cbart b Nankiv«-H 15 ; Curn>>w b Bennetts 1 ; Lowry c P.
