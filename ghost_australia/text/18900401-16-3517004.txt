Manager expects to strike rich reef any moment. Carcoar. The prospectors at Wide Gully cut a vein about 2ft. from the surface, and about 8in. thick, carrying good gold. A prospect was tried without crushing, proving that payable stone having a grand appearance is being opened out. It is hard to state whether the find is extensive or not. It is on private property. At the Burraga copper mine there are now five smelting furnaces in full swing; VICTORIA. Ballarat. The output for the week was not quite so good as that of the previous week, in spite of the excellent retorting of 10oz. from Star of the East, but the aggregate is good enough to warrant the presumption that the quarter's returns will equal those of the Decembcr quarter. The Plateau mines are all without any material change, and the fine yield from Star of the East and the excellent promise of the mine in all the stones have given a rise to the stock without inducing sales for some days, so well are the shares held. In Ballarat East the producing mines maintain their returns. Sulieman Pasha and the mines to the south are in moderately good fettle. The Buninyong Estate crushing was a failure, only 47 oz. from 300 tons, but there is plenty of stone for further testing, The Egerton mines are as usual, only that Black Horse has to get some country out of the way before cutting into the hole at the lower level. The Clunes mines are without material change. Alluvial mines are also as usual, save that Smeaton Reserve has given up the ghost ; the bank is in possession, and the pump lifts are being drawn. There is plenty of wash, as there is in Hepburn Estate, but it did not pay.

Matters in the share market do not show much briskness, but there is a little more disposition for business, and there is ample reason for it. The gold returns on Saturday reached 6400 oz., which is the largest return for any week for very many months, excepting Christmas week, when there is a special cleaning-up. Apart from this there is a still more important reason. The official gold returns, as issued by the local sub-treasurer, show that this year's returns are considerably in advance of those for any similar period since 1885\. The position is shown by the following list of yields for the first two months of each year since : Mouth. 1886\. 1887. 1886\. 11883. 1800.

The March month is also in a fair way to show a substantial increase As regards the week's news the most satisfactory item is the excellent yield from the 225ft. level in the New Chum Railway, where 207 tons gave no less than 36OZ. 19dwt. gold. A Is. dividend will be declared on Saturday next, the amount being £1844 10s. Another very satisfactory feature is the magnificent return of 300oz. from the Johnson's Gold Mines. The ROBO of Denmark yield shows a marked improvement. The Specimen Hill and United Hustler's and Redan had good yields and each a 6d. dividend. The United Devon Tributors have again a very good yield. The Fortuna Hustler's see good gold at 320ft. in the north level.

The Junction Reef shaft is down 40ft., and the lode is holding. WESTERN AUSTRALIA. The latest news from Southern Cross states that a plentiful supply of condensed water is obtainable at 7d. per gallon. No rain had fallen up to 25th February. The Government are taking steps for the conservation of water at Southern Cross. The Government geologist has forwarded a report to the Government upon Fraser's mine and the Central Mine. With regard to the former he points out a number of defects in the crushing plant, but speaks in extremely favourable language of the quality of the stone. He says that if the shareboldewareprepaxed to go to further expense the mine will be a success. The Central was not crushing when he was there, and was waiting for fresh water, but every preparation was being made to have everything in readiness Respecting the prospects of the alluvial finds, he expects that some rich deposits will be found when the regulations with regard to leases are so altered as to admit of prospecting on there The latest telegram from Roebourne states that 1200 oz alluvial has been taken from the new find at Nullagine in seven weeks There are about 500 men on the field and everything is doing fairly well Provisions are very scarce The latest from Milligan reports excellent finds of alluvial One man got 150 oz from a cartload of washdirt obtained at a depth of 27ft TASMANIA Tm -The export of tin for the month of February last from Launceston was 237 tons 15cwt, valued at £21,530, as against 584 tons 16cwt, valued at £35 881, in February, 1889 Gold-Last month 36oz 10dwt of gold, valued at £12 601, was exported from Launceston, as against 300oz 19dwt, valued at £13 GOD, in February, 1889 Silver-A shareholder in the Talune Pro specting Association, residing at the west coast and who has just returned from a visit to Mount Dundas, w rites -"One of the most important discoveries yet made on Mount Dundas and one which goes to prove the value of the new locality as a silver bearing one was made by the prospectors of the Talune Prospecting Association, a Zeehan and Somme company The find is galena, a formation of about 4ft wide, carrying three seams of ore, each about 18in wide on surface It has been cut in three places, about three chains apart Assays as follows Large grain (No 1), 28oz silver, 70, percent load, No 2 £10? 9dwt silver, 69 percent lead Small grain, 19s.. 19dwt 6gr silver, 70 per cent lead The company have obtained two 80 acre blocks on line of lode " NEW ZEALAND A cablegram from Auckland on Wednesday week states that in consequence of favourable reports received from Preservation Inlet num bois of minors are proceeding there , 4cwt of sand yielded 10oz of gold Mr Barr, who is acting on behalf of a Sydney syndicate has in spected in company with Professor Black of Dunedin, the Pegasus tinfield at Stewart Island It is understood the report is of a favourable character
