A STORMY ENCOUNTER. Mabel, lier's and Julie's attendants, two domestics who had accompanied their master from Daubenay, and a few women and chil- dren of the village^ were the sole witnesses of the ceremony. The rite performed, the names signed, they left the church, the bells sounding a joyous peal in'their ears. Lean- ing against one of the pillars of the outward door, was a spare figure dressed in black ; as the bridal party issued, he turned his head, and showed the livid face pf-JOSHUA WINYAKD ! Julie clung trembling to her husband's arm, while he, pale as a ghost, seemed suddenly transformed to marble. " Allow me to be the first to congratulate ? the bride and bridegroom," said Winyard in, his croaking voice, his eyes gleaming with suppressed fury, his lip curling with mocking malice. " My presence here is an unexpected pleasure, no doubt. Sorry to break iii upon your connubial pleasures, but I must have immediate speech with you, Sir Henry Daw henay ; therefore, be pleased to hand over your bride to Mistress Mabel, and follow me to my inn 1" All Gerald's apprehensions gave way be- neath the goad of this infamous insult. 'How dare you thus address me in the pre- sence of my wife he cried, trembling with passion. " You once dared to lift your eyes and thoughts to her ; if this be a retaliation for the rejection of your suit, beware how you repeat it, lest I break every bone in your cadaverous carcase !" Winyard was literally stunned" with amaze- ment at this bold retort, when he had expected nothing but humiliating submission. "Do you dare to thus address me?" he cried, as soon as he could recover breath; ' you, who-' ' Silence !' whispered Gerald fiercely in his ear. 'Another word, and I swear before \- h^Den I will strike you dead at my feet !' xhe minister, who had performed the cere- mony, attracted by tho loud, fierce voices, caine forth at tho moment when Gerald, all aglow with passion, was grasping his half drawn sword, ready to put his threat into execution. What is the meaning \of this ?' he cried, advancing between the two angry men. ' Would you shed blood upon the very thresh, old of the church ?' QîlTiy church, yes !' cried Winyard, turn- ing furiously upon the clergyman, and voiding upon him the venom of which he felt it no longer safe to make Gerald the receptacle. ' Priest of a fo«l idolatry, I spit upon thee and thy church, thy Temple of Baal, thy Popish mummeries, and thy player's garb ! , . There will yet come a day when beasts of Igbufden shall be stabled in thy churches, and Hthy shrines, and vestments, and graven images, i^Biall be consumed in flames J' Then turning i^nain to Gerald, ' If you are not with me at *^Kyinn within.half an hour, Sir Henry Dau i^Htiay, beware !' i^i^wAnd, with a threatening wave of his hand, i^i^Bruslied through the churchyard, out at the i^i^Bfet-gate, and disappeared. Julie was i^i^Hflk» half faluting, upW her cousin's i^i^i^i^Hb; Mabek was watching the scene i^i^i^i^i^B attention. ^^^^RÉjMleV the insolent hound, and ^^^^H^upon the spot!' cried Gerald. ^^^^Erew herself into his arms, and im ^^^^B not to leave her. ^^^^His nothing to fear, darling,' he ^^^^^wthingly. 'It is only the bitter ^^^^^^Ke man at the disappointment of ^^^^^^ftopes. It is no more than I have ^^^^^^K>een prepared for-strived to ^^^^^^Bmi witnessing. Bot it has come, ^^^^^Hr : " the worst is past. I will lead I^^^^Ktoors, and thcu follow this wretch, ^frorn him ample apology. And ^^^Hßaer to you, sir,' he said, turning to ^^^Kyman, ' my sincere contrition for my ^^^?ision, and my regret that this fanatic ^^^V^ve so insulted you.' ^^Kihere were few ministers of the Epis church whose ears had not already ^^?7 beneath some such language from ^^^Kl Julie, weeping and trembling, to the ^^^A&ded; her to Mabel's <?¿re, and has ^^^^Ht immediately in search of Win ^^^^^Ajhe found at the very inn where he ^^^^^^Bhis attendants had passed the ^^^^^^^»ied the lawler, furiously, ^^^^^^^^Hone together, ' this was the ^^^^^^^^nuces ourneys !I gliftiitn^ and jfoHo^edryóupjpon tioe road.

You raised me to satisfy your own greed, and from other motive, which I do not pretend to understand. 1 have paid you one half of all the moneys left by Sir Richard, and half the revenues of the estate. I have been your slave !* ' And now you shall be a beggar !' cried Winy ard. ' I will strip you of all, and send you and that baggage forth to beg-' Ere lie could speak another word, Gerald seized him by the back of the neck, as a dog would a rat, forced him upon his knees, and, holdirg the sword to his throat, swore that he would take his life if he did not instantly apologize for that foul epithet, which Win yard, to save his throat from the sword, was compelled abjectly to do. Gerald, his courage thoroughly aroused, cast aside all fear. To temporize with this serpent was out of the question ; his only chance.lay ïn striking terror to him-in meet- ing threat by threat. So, pressing him down floor like some hideous snake, and planting his foot upon his body, he thus addressed him. ' You cannot destroy me without destroying yourself ; you cannot make known my fraud without exposing your own ; Were this done, all your, power would crumble into dust; every friend would shrink away from you, and every purpose and ambition of your life would be blasted I Beyond these things, within twenty-four hours afterwards^-even though my own life was forfeited the next instant-1 would kill you ! I tell you to your teeth you dare not expose me! lam quite willing to fulfil our bargain in £he future, as I have done in the past, provided you keep silence as before ! And now, Master Joshua Winyard, you know my fiat ! I shall waste no further breath upon you ; do as you please-I shall be prepared for all emergencies !' And with those words, and a parting look, full of meaning, Gerald left the room. Not until upwards of an hour afterwards did Winyard issue from his chamber. Then his countenance, although still pale and death- like, was sinisterly calm. He descended to the common apartment of the. inn, called for refreshment, ate heartily, ordered his horse to be saddled, mounted him, and rode leisurely away upon his road back to London. In the meantime, Gerald had returned i to the ladies, who were most anxiously await- ing bim. Julie flew into his arms, overjoyed to see him in safety, for Winyard's violence and malignancy had filled her with alarm. ' There was nothing to bo frightened of, darling,' he said, caressing her and speaking with strong excitement. ' I made him apolo- gize for his insolence, with my foot upon his prostrate body and my sword at his heart.' ' Oh. you should not have been so violent, dear,' said Julie, trembling and hiding her face in his shoulder ; ' he will seek some dreadful revenge upon you. I shall never forget his look as he met us at the church ! door-it was fearful !' ' I defy him and his malice !' cried Gerald, in the same tone of feverish excitement. ' But were I to become the victim to it the next moment, do you think that I would j endure his insolence towards you ?' ' You have acted bravely, brother,' said Mabel, extending to him her hand, her face flushed with the warmth of her feelings ; ' I honour you for it.' Another pang of remorse shot through his heart. What would this noble creature say if she could learn the truth ? was his thought. That same day they began their journey southward ; Julie's maid and Gerald's two domestics forming their only escort. The parting between the cousins was sorrowful and affectionate, and for a time Julie was in- consolable at their separation, and would fain have persuaded Mabei to accompany them ; but to this she would not listen, rightly judg- ing that newly-married people are best with- out the presence of friends and relations ; neither would she promise to visit them until the spring. It was now the latter part of September, the autumnal rains would soon set in, and then the frosts of winter. A" journey from Leicestershire to Surrey would, in these days of steam, be a mere after-tea excursion ; but in those days of ill kept roads, when scarcely any other mode of conveyance was known except saddle-horses, travelling in rough weather was a perilous, almost impossible feat for ladies to accom- plish. And Julie was obliged to be content with the promise of this far-off visit, To And 80 iM^^w^l^', M home.

And so the autumn strewed the earth with the leaves of summer, and thtí snows of winter buried them, and the breath of spring brought forth new ones. And one day, just as Mabel was beginning to think of journeying to Daubenay, behold ! Gerald and Julie came to visit her instead. ' I thought,' 6aid he, ' that we would' come to you and so save you the journey.' Mabel thought this strange, "but expressed her satisfaction with the arrangement. Julie seemed perfectly light-hearted and happy, and talked much of the gay company they kept^ and how, during the winter, they had attended the playhouses, and received the' actors at their home ; which' information was not very gratifying to Mabel's somewhat Puritan cast of mind. But Julie had now passed beyond her surveillance, and she felt that she had no right to dictate to her as to her manner of life. ' But Of Winyard V she asked, anxiously. 'He has never came near ns-at least, I have never seen him,' answered Julie; 'it is quite evident thaf Harry terrified him from attempting any further insolence." Mabel hoped so ; but she feared that his extreme quietude was ominous. Gerald had not been at Naseby more than a week, when he received a letter, the contents of which, although they seemed to greatly trouble him, he would not impart to his wife, except iu so far as to inform her that his pre- sence was required in London, Whither he should depart next morning* leaving her in Mabel's care until hiß return, Neither for coaxings nor entreaties would he make any further revelations. Julie pouted, and'refused, to say farewell to him. Mabel was mote anxious than the affair i seemed to warrant, for she at Once coupled it in her thoughts with Master Winy ard. Julie had told her in their confidences how Dau benay Castle had become a rendezvous for the Cavalier party, and now her husband had all but openly declared in favour of the King, and frequently abused'the Puritans before tis company. Such a course of conduct was every day becoming more dangerous ; for ¡the Par- liament was most intolerant of all that op- posed its will, either by deed or word. And the din of was was beginning to hurtle through the quite air of Naseby, and day by day the opposing armies drew nearer and nearer to this quiet retreat. Scouts, then small detachments of soldiers, wôrë séett about the neighbourhood ; then the news was ban- died about that large forces of either side were marching thitherward. One morning Mabel and Julie were wander- ing about the old churchyard, enjoying the freshness of the air after an excessively hot day, when the sound of horses* hoofs broke upon their ears, and presently a troop of King's soldiers rode briskly down the lane past their house. The leader was a stalwart young gentleman, with flowing chesnut hair, and handsome, but melancholy features. As Mabel's ej es fell upon him, she convulsively grasped Julie's arm, and drew her behind one of the great elm-trees that bordered the churchyard, for in him she had recognised HUGH DRELINCOUET !
