This is the horse about" which "a sensational wager was made before the appearance of the weights. Certainly 7st 111b is not •much for a six-year-old to carry, but still he must have done something some time or other.and so far-as I can find Sensation: .;halidt.: i -'SwfeM^WiIHfimias''7stM he is hardly likely to be the trusted one of-tlig .sl'ab^e,*' and illJdll.^robability will not face the starter.

'This' -was seebnded by Mir . J; M.

Kormanby club an exceedingly fair .one, and as their joint liabilities did not exceed about £15. he did not think the debts of eitherdub should stand in the way.—Mr-Patten was of opinion that,the, debts could easily be wiped • out, but the only; difficulty she -foresaw ^ wasj the difference? m the .j4ubscriptions , i..tot the two clubs, the -Sale subscription being a guinea,, whereas the Normanby was only; half that amount.—Mr .Treloar said the; Sale club was never out of debt when they bad forty or fifty members, at a -gumea each, so he,.failed to see. how.: they could possiblyiget-calong if:they-, adopted--.the: Mormanby subscription of half a guinea, considering that they were in debt to start with. —The "chairman . thought that as they had a dead horse saddled on. them to start .with, at would be^. advisable to commence'with a«guiinea, andithenafithey found themselves out of debt and plenty of members m the club, tbey could reduce it afterwards. He..would, however, m order not.to go too wade pf the Normanby, subsenption,'.-- suggest..'thaK there -be an entrance fee of 10s 6d, and that a like t-amount bo payable afterwards, say a, couple of mgnths.;-SMr.Tr^parthough Normanbyites should, not let the subscription standin the way; of amalgamation, , as S^le assets, v-which vrere worth more thaw -£20,4 whereas the .^Normanbyites had' nothing whatever to worlc upon.—Mr, Hagger was also of opinion that the amount of subscription should, not be; allowed to stand in the way of atnalgama-, ' tion, as there; seemed now every proba-; bilitjiiof a -.complete 'revival, sjms'pncket. 1 Personally he was m favor of a guinea,- but he did not think the members of his, club were generally,* as the great secret of • the lformanby success was the small sub- 1 scription;—Mr Patten said'he bad been a member of the Sale club since its birth 21 years ago, and the subscription had; never been less .than a, guinea;—After some more conversation on the matter, it was agreed unanimously, on the motion: of ; Mr:MapMntpsh, ^seconded' by2Mr .Scan-! Ion, that the-subscription be ,10s, and that' the members pay 2s 6d each month for: four months.—Mr Treloar then moved, that honorary-members aiid'youths Under.; 18 years of age be admitted at a payment. of 10s per; annum, "and; .that, they be ; exempt froin'tlie '2s'6d call."
