CONSEQUENCES OF TBE CARDINAL'S CAND1UATUUE. ? ' One result of the Cardinal's candidature was the defeat'bf Messrs See and Copeland.-'To 1 save "tho Oardina),' ' it fs asserted that thousands of the Roman Catholic voters | threw away about one-half of their votes. ThuB they cast ballots for, Bay, Ave I candidates, including- the Cardinal, whom they regarded as . being . pretty safe, and gaye the remainder to men who had nob the ghost of. a chance of being elected. Amongst the persons < who received these votes were Messrs Bridge and Foran. Had the Cardinal not. been in the field, Messrs Seo and Copeland would have got their share of these votes, and would, in conse- quence, have been amongst the chosen teu. - For a longtime on Thursday Mr, See was one of the ten leading candidates, but towards midnight be dropped out, and Mr. Copeland took his place. The latter was shunted when the returns from the Protestant Hall caine in. The electors have decided, in the most emphatic manner, that they will not tolerate the intrusion of ? any section of the clergy into politics. And to the. credit of. the Protestants, bo it said that they were loyal to the Hon, R.^B. O'Connor; fully 30,001) Protestant votes must have been given to him. In'my opinion, this is one pi the most gratifying Incidents in connection with the election.
