ODD NOTES. BY A BOHEMIAN.. THE more the education question is discussed the lets the disputants understand each other t and both go on reiterating the same arguments or assertions in much the same words, in the hope or belief that wore repetition will, in time, convince their opponents This is a mistake. It would be far better for both to begin again at the very beginning Suppose you and I, gentle reader of course you are " gentle," or you wouldn't read these Notes suppose we start the thing afresh ? First of all then, who are the controversialists P Knocking off a few persons, here and there, who have crotchety doubts about the benefits of education to children who will have to earn their living by manual labor, the duty or the right of the State to insist upon all children under its jurisdiction being educated ; the practicability of carrying out such a scheme and minor objections of a similar character knocking off these, I Bay, we find that the controversy is between the general public, on the one side, and the clergy of the Roman Catholic and Episcopalian Churches on the other. The chief point of a " ference is as to what does, or does not constitute " religious education," such as ought to be imparted in Primary Schools Now, the kernel of the difficulty lies in the different meaning which each side attaches to the word " religious " The general public mean by religion, just that amount of knowledge of God and the truths of Christianity, and that amount of practical and habitual love and reverence for both, which will make children grow up to be pure and good citizens The clergy of the two Churches before mentioned mean something altogether different from this. What they mean by religion is such a perfect knowledge of the doctrines, practices, and traditions of their particular Churches as will make children grow up to be sound inflexible Roman Catholics or Episcopalians, humble and obedient to their " spiritual pastors and masters, and regarding with contemptuous pity everybody who does not belong to their Church Do you see the difference ? Why it makes all the difference in the world to a man as to which of these two religions he has been trained in as a child, For there's no denying the fact-only catch your child young enough, train him carefully, and, if he is not of a thoroughly bad breed, you may make just what sort of man you please of him. The priests and Levites know this, bless you, just as well as you or I and the present is to them a desperate struggle to get a fair hold of the youngsters directly they are caught, and train them more carefully than they have trained any heretofore, as the poor fellows see clear enough now that this is their last chance of maintaining any vestige of priestly power and influence. They belong to Churches, remember, that for centuries past have been " State " Churches, exercising vast political and social power altogether apart from religious teaching. They are bent upon making the priesthood a distinct and largely privileged class, holding in absolute subjection the minds and consciences of the laity. Their Churches are ceasing to be State Churches, the prestige which attached to them as such is departing, and instead of realis- ing their sacerdotal yearnings, the minds and consciences of their flocks are getting less and less under the control of the priests day by day. The Episcopalians are fussing about ecclesiastical millinery, and playing at being Roman Catholics while their Church has been disestablished in Ireland, and a vigorous effort is being made to disestablish it in England also. The Roman Catholic Church, as a political power, has ceased, or is on the eve of extinction, in Germany, France, Italy, and even ignorant, bigotted Spain. Popes and cardinals are found to be much the same as other men and their bulls, communications, and heaviest spiritual artillery, instead of creating terror and submission, as formerly, only cause rude gibes and boisterous laughter at its proved impotence, Here, in Queensland, the whole tone of thought, social and political, is so horribly democratic that, unless the tide can be turned by getting a firm grip upon the primary schools, sacerdotal pretensions will not stand a ghost of a chance. Taken altogether, mind you, it's an anxious time just now for the persons who aspire to be something more in the State than more ministers of religion. What's the good of " common Christianity " to these men ? Palmer's bill has been staved off for a time, but the Board of Education are, in the mean- time, doing what they can to keep the teachers from co-operating with the persons in the direction the latter most desire, The new regulations, published on Saturday last, are a stopper on this of the Board can get them faithfully carried out. Dare the General Inspector insist upon the regular use of the religious books in the Roman Catholic Schools ? I read the new regulations very carefully and I like them. They are first-rate, or perhaps a trifle better than that, especially with reference to the teachers. " A teacher," says the 18th regula- tion, " should be a person of Christian senti- ment, of calm temper and discretion, imbued with a' spirit of peace, of obedience to the low and loyalty to the Sovereign! and should not only possess the art of communicating. knowledge, but be capable of moulding the minds of youth, and of giving a useful direction to the power which education confers. These are the qualities which the Board are anxious to find, to encourage, and to reward " And if any one wants to know how the Board propose to " encourage and reward when they find a teacher so qualified it's no use looking at the scale of fees set forth in a regulation further on. From that scale of fees it is quite evident that the reward is something more noble and elevating than a paltry money payment. Perhaps it is considered that a liberal salary would take off the fine edge of the Christian sentiment, calm temper, spirit of peace, obedience to the law, loyalty to the Sovereign, and all the long list of virtues required No I when we consider that ordinary mechanics, carpenters, stonemasons, and brick layers, having no social or Christian virtues worth a mention, earn their ten and twelve shillings per day which is close up to a £160 a year-the best qualities" teachers in the employment of the Board are in no danger of being demoralised or ever vated by a superabundance of filthy lucre -A boy goes to be pupil teacher at the salary be could get as errand boy. If he is BE intelligent, industrious, and studious lad, taking readily to the " Christian sentiment " and all the other qualities required, he will, at the end of ms '3 years' hard work and application, be able to look forward to a salary of £60 a year. By continued study and application to his parents duties for another three years, he will t»T* thoroughly unfitted himself for any other kind of occupation for the rest of his life, will be old enough to marry, and can look forward with calm contentment to a salary of £100 a year, with a chance of making it ten or even twenty pounds a year more by capitation allowances There are only three or four good prizes to be gained under the Board, and these among two or three hundred teachers, are not likely to distract their attention by ambitious yearnings for promotion After a boy has graduated under the Board, and grown to marriageable age if he cannot find a suitable partner among the girl graduates, he will have to remain single all his life, for his salary will not allow him the luxury of a wife who cannot take charge of the girls' school This is an admirable plan for keep ing the teachers select The fees for adult teachers who have not been trained under the Board are fixed upon the same frugal scale Before the schools were made free to the children the fees, in ordinary good tunes, averaged about nine pence per week per head ranging as they did, from sixpence to eighteenpence a pupil After the crisis of 1866 many persons could not pay wear their children, and the teachers had instructions not to refuse admission to any child whose parents could not pay A number of other parents who could afford to pay, finding that their neighbors' children were taught free, got orders from the General Inspector, and sent their children in on the same footing By the year 1868 this system had become so common that the fees received were very small indeed Then came free education, and for 1870 the teachers received from the Board the amount they had received in 1869 for fees clear reduction of salary from the race before the crisis At the end of 1870 the Board took the two worst years the teachers had over known 1868 and 1869 struck an average of the fees received during those two years, found it fourpence halfpenny per head per week, and adopted that as the capitation fee for all future time Now that the prices of all the necessaries of life have risen from 20 to 30 per cent, the teachers find magnificent exercise for the " Christian sentiment, calm temper, discretion, spirit of peace' and the other qualities the Board are anxious to find, to encourage, and to reward ' I am anxious to find out in what the encouragement and reward consists, but have hitherto failed to discover it Strange to say, the teachers themselves don't seem to know Curious isn't it? And now I perceive that this education question has squelched all my other " notes" out of this paper Whenever anybody begins to write on this subject, they can't pull up under a column or a column and a quarter, try how they will another curious fact I
