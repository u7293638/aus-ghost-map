SELECT. ED POETRY. TEMPO'S FUG IT. O fleeting^time of Youth and Love, • So quickly passing by, 0 halcyon days of bygone years, Whose requiem is a sigh. Come back again in dreams to-night, Ye phantoms fair and sweet ! Right lovingly such ghosts as these My hungry soul Bhall greet. • 1 fain would bid Remembrance blot This present page of Life. -Whoae,writing is the record stern Of bitter toi! and strife. ' ' That I in Fancy's visions bright, Worth all the world to me-, • The blissful scenes of long ago Yet once again might'see. Then, gentle Sleep, for this one night Lull every thought of pain. ■ . i . And in my dreams—my sleeping life — Give back my youth again ; Give back the love, the hope, the trust, The faith so full and free : . The loved and lust of yore return— Return strain to me! M. E.
