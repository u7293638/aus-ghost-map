During the past year alluvial mining has dwindled but immense progress has been made in the more permanent branch of the industry, that of quartz. Amongst the places which have been lying dormant for 30 years Bulumwaal comes first, During that time mines and surface claims have been worked for a hundred or so ounces of gold annually; now between 30 and 40 head of stampers are kept going on good auri- ferous stone. The main line of reefs have been traced for a considerable distance, and all stone worked down to a depth of 200ft. has been found to be as rich, and in many cases richer than on the surface, while the auriferous shoots are much longer. Amongst the best producers are at present the De- fiancé, the Beehive, Jackie's Dream, the Christmas, and the Christmas extended, all of which have raised stone going over 10oz. per ton from fair sized parcels, and which now can produce over ounce stone from large reefs. Next year will witness still larger increases, and the field will rank as one of Gippsland's main gold producers. A vast belt of country, extending northwards, has been slightly prospected, but in the near future excellent stone will be dis- covered in Merrijig and Sandy Creek, which have both produced large quantities of alluvial gold. An extension of the belt of country to the north, at Grant, has yielded some good reefs, which have produced stone going from 2oz. to 4oz. per ton. Bulgoback, lying in a granite area between the two places mentioned, continues to support a number of miners who work small reefs, which pay excellently until the hard un- altered zone of granite is met. at Dept- ford the company's mine is still at work, but the want of adequate capital has pre- vented this being one of the most regular gold producers in the colony. The reefs are well defined and continuous, still the natural facilities such as water power, re- quire to be made use of, and the mines should be systematically opened up before they can pay dividends. The Haunted Stream has had a revival of late, and seve- rap claims have been floated. It is antici- pated that an influx of capital will pro- duce a more than equal amount of gold. Sheep Station, now called Brookville, has continued to maintain its reputation, and the miners have done exceedingly well with nearly all claims. One English com- pany, the Highland Chief is splendidly equipped, and has every facility for working successfully on the reefs opened up on the property. The Clifton Creek and Mount Taylor fields are being slowly developed. On the former a small Government battery has been erected, but it is not kept as much employed as was anticipated. Mount Tara, near Buchan, has not progressed, although a government battery has been erected on on the field, only one or two parcels of stone being crushed. The Bemm River has justi- died itself as a fair gold producer from a miner's point of view, and promises to yield steady returns to the fortunate holders of some of the claims. The new discovery at Boulder Creek also is of interest, showing the possibilities in unexplored country.
