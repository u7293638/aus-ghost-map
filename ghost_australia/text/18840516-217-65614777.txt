THINGS OLD AND NEW, ————O———— "What man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in him ? even so, the spirit of God knoweth no man, but the things of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of GOD ; for they are foolishness unto him ; neither can he know them. because they are Spiritually discerned."—I. Cor, 11 ; 11, 12, 14.
