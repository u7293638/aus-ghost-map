BY JOSEPH 1IATTO.N, Author of " Ciit'el Lo.vdox,1' " Thj: Tiikiíj; Recruits," " Jonx Neediiall," ctc. PART II. CHAPTER III-. Two Mkkkv Sis rni "It was the opem of Carmen, said Philip: " a favourite of mine, because it seems to me to be a consistent and possible story, the music and words deftly wedded, the chorus people coming in naturally» as part of the story and not niore'y to sing. Indeed, it is the only oner." in which one's imagination noes uot seem to be especially or remarkably handicapped, when at a tragic mtment the hero begins to sing, and when the heroine, being stabbed to the heart, or dying of poison, does not also burst out into a wonderful effort of vocalisation. " "Oh, you demand realism in opera, do you 1 And yet I hear you prefer a light melodramatic work, such as Carinen to the great Wagnerian dramas." " But 1 don't make any sweeping criticism for or against, any opera or any composer," Philip replied. " Carmen always appealed to me somehow for its utter naturalness : T may be wrong, I dare say I am. ell, it was at the scene where Miuhavel tries iu persuade the soldier .lover to go home- the scene with the banditti in the mountains, you know—when 1 was suddenly conscious, of a new presence in the house, not upon the stage, but in the theatre. I had glanced aside for a moment, and in the box immedi ately opposice—Lady Marclnnount's box. in fact—I saw a face partially hidden among the curtains, pale, earnest, with great briaht eyes, and a halo ut dark red hair : the lips weri parted, the face all eager and wonder fully beautiful, and it .seemed to me as if the eloquent eyes fell upon mine. I war. fascin ated : as 1 gazed, the faco irradually vrith drew into the shadow of t he box. W hen the act was at ;>y cnid I visited Lao y March jnount. Aair,le I shook hands with her lady ship, I looked round her box. 'You expec ted Lord Marchmount Y she said. ' He is obliged to lie at the House : but I think he will come before the end of the last act. My girls are with their aunt; T am quite alone. Will you nut sit ? I thought she seemed t<> bo talking and explaining why she was alone for the sake of putting ntc oil my inquiry as to the lady who was in the box during the bandit scene : 1 don't know what made me thilik so. ' But the lady.' I said, ' who was hero a few minutes since?' 'What lady Y she asked. ' She was at the back of the box.' I said. 'I have had no visitor that I am aware of, except yourself.' ' T beg your pardon perhaps it was in the next box ; I am suve you will forgive my curios ity, Lady Marehmoun:. but it was a very re markable and beautiful face, and it went straight home to my imagination as the very face I want for a picture I amgoingto paint.' ' That is a convenient excuse you artists make for introduction to pretty women, but I have had no lady in my box to-night. If, however you are in search of beauty, what say you to Madame. Fetroijoviteh 7 She in dicated the royal box with her fan. and ¡lan ded me her glass. " I looked over the way and saw a hand some foreign-looking woman, chatting with a distinctly Russian officer ; both animated, the lady evidently happy, the officer some what constrained in his manner, and with, as I thought, a cruel mouth, and a cold reso lute eye. 'General Pctronovitch.' said Lady Marchmount : 'the famous Russian diplomat and soldier making a tour of Europe by way of honeymoon, coupled with oliici.il business ; is to honour the Italian Court during the coming festivities at Venice ; a compliment to Italy which troubles France and does not •iolight Germany. Lord Marchmount was to have come to bring the General to my box. and no doubt will. Won't you stay Y '• Thank von. Lady Marchmont,' isviiu, < I have a friend who is a stran;cr to town,' which was perfectly tru°. , n young fellow to whom my mother I was anxious 1 should pay attention. So 1 Í left the box, and made a survey of the house from various points, but my mysterious and beautiful vision was nowhere to be seen." " It was not a vision after ail, eh ? not a dream, face, incident and all ?' " No, it was a reality, and I cannot help thinking Lady Marchmount had some reason for saying .she had no other visitor except myself." " But surely she would not have told a deliberate lie about it T' "She might have done so with a reser vation." "But why ?" "Ah, there you bring me to a dead stop." "Would it have been possible for the lady to have gone into the box and Lady March mount not to have seen her f' "Yes, if the door had been left open, and Lady Marchmount had been deeply interes ted in the play ; but she was not. Her in terest was in the Russian party in the Royal box ?" " Was the stranger long in the box ? " About as long as it took me to tell you of her." "She was very much in earnest, you say ; was she deeply interested in the opera ?" "On reflection it seems to me she must have Veen directiiic her gaze upon the Rus sian box ; and j-et also I fancied she looked at me as well. But the incident was brief, and what struck me was the wonderful, sad, tragic beauty of the face." "Madame Lapukin'sghost, Phil !" "No ghost," said the artist, his eyes upon the face he had drawn. " Then we will find her. You have all one requires," pointing to ttic picture, "to assist an independent search. ' Wanted, a mysterious lady, last seen at the opera of Carmen in Lady Marchmount's box, half hidden in the curtains, reminded an enthu siastic artist of—•—' " " Don't scon, Dick,1 said Philip ; "you have no idea how serious 1 feel about that face." " Of course you do. One only wants the assurance of your canvas to know that. But what other steps, if any, have you taken to find Madame ?" " I have been to the opera every night since, in and out,, making calls ; I went into the Milbanke's box. Then another night took my mother; another went into thestalls.I have strolled into the Row, cold as it is, and I have called upon Lady Marchmount." " And no clue "Not the slightest." " What does Dully—Miss Norcott—say to it ?" "Towhajl" beauty 1" "I have not mentioned the subject to her." "But I thought a young fellow mentioned pretty well everything to his 'fiancee.' " "Dolly is not my 'fiancee,'" said the artist. "Is it all off, then V " It was never all on." " Oh, indeed ; excuse me, I thought from what your mother said the other night that it was settled, and that you were going with the Milbankes to Venice." " I am thinking of going to Veuice." "And taking a studio there- for a month or two Y' " Yes." " Convenient to have Dolly and lier very amiable sister there at the same time ; save you from ennui, and enable you to forget that woman's face." "I shall never forget it." "NorT will the public," said Dick, "if you finish your picture as you liavo begun it. I don't want to surprise your secret, but Miss Norcott isa very bright, charming, and desir able young woman." Philip's reply was interrupted by a triple knock at the door, followed by a merry, musical voice, wliich asked. "Is anything dreadful going on ? May we come in ?" "That is Dolly," said Philip. " Sounded to me like Mrs. Milbanke," said Dick. " She said 'we,' " observed Philip, going to the door, " and that 'we' means Dolly and her sister, Jenny." " Of courna you may," said the artist, lead ing in a pretty, fashionable girl of a littlu over twenty." " Jenny is with me—she stayed to speak to the porter's wife. Hero she is; come in, Jenny, there is nothing dreadful going on, only Mr, Chetwynd," gaid the young lady, ia: a pleasant voice. "Oh yes, there is," she continued, all in the same breath, and look ing straight ut Philip's sketch. " What a miserable lot! But' how clever! 1s this yours, Mr. Forsyt 1» ?". "\es, I think so," said. Philip, his manner somewhat constrained as compared with his frank conversation with Dick Chet wvnd. '"One of Forsyth's dreams," said Clict w\\-nd,at the same time greeting Dolly's sister. Mrs"." Milbanke, " What a queer rtreahs." >V(?nt oil Dolly, " but Mr. Forsyth has ugly dreams." "ÜSot always," said Dick, smiling in his bland calm way. " 1'ou are looking charm ing this morning. "Oh, I am not one of Mr. Forsyth's dreams ; I am a very sober reality. Am I not, Mr. Philip Forsyth ?" l'ere she turned her merry eyes upon Philip, and was the very antithesis of tho woman in the picture. Dully was beaming with good health, a pretty blonde, with a dainty figure : very modern, an artist would, say, and so she was in dress, style ami manner: a tennis-player, a lint, and yet at heart a good- natured pleasant London girl. And she was London, every inch oí her, wit h all tho London vhie and audacity ; fearless in her plerK-nni ignorance of art and all its branches except the art of dress and the arc ol small talk : she would talk on anything, art or what not — the musical glasses, or the music of the spheres: she laughed at her own ignorance "when it lie came too apparent, but she could wait;', divinely, sing snatches of all tho modern operas, comic and otherwise, play bits of Wagner, Chopin. Mendelssohn, Sullivan: never finished anything, however, and was altogether a pretty, dainty, amusing, linht' hearted London girl. -And her sister,.lonny, was a great deal like her, only a little more staid in manner and convei'satiun, she being married tmu Dolly only on the ove of being engaged. They were of medium height, both of them, the one a little 'prettier than the other, both merry, both torched with tho Society mania of knowing the " Smar test people, don't you know both ibrts, both, genial, pleasant and good women. Once ill a way seine conceited person of the opposite would mistake their free and constrained manners, and trespass by sugges tion or remark upon what they considered their good ' nature, and then would be re vealed to hiin and sundry that Dolly and lie sister "Stood no nonsense." t<< use a favorite phrase of Mr. Samuel Swynford. an admirer of both tho sisters and especially of Dolly, for whom it was generally known !w cherished a more or less .secret, nassioli. " They both like a bit of fun," paid'Sam to a friend, who had heard of a snub' Mrs. Milbanke had administered to a certain noble lord. " hut. thev know just how far to go.and any fool who is not equally well informed comes a cropper. I can tell you, it he ' pre sumes upon their frond nature. It's like a bear transaction against a strong syndicate. I knew a fellow who did a big bear on Nitrates just as the. rise began: he did. not know how the Xorth wind was blowing, am inore thro: did your noble lord when lie ventured ro discount the high, unblemished and beautifully moral characters of D.-lly Noveott and her sister Jenny." They were daintly dressed, the two . merry sisters. Dolly might have bry'ai c:i;le l a harmony in pink : tor if her cloak was of ilar:; plush, the Itr-.ing -was of soft pink silk, and her hnl was of some indescribably pinky salmon colur, in trine and sympathy there with. Jenny, her sister, was dark, not a brunette, but her hair was a verr dern brown, her eyes hazel, hor.eoniii'.eraon what Disraeli would l>»t*'o ;c¿lWl rich, and whill there w;>.£ r. strong family likeness to her sister, she-was notas pretty as Dolly, nor had she the freshness of youth, that was Dollv's precious possession both in fact and in ao pearanco. Dolly was twenty-'hree, Jeunv was thirty, Jenny wore a plnsh cloak of a dead gold colour, and unbuttoning if, dis closed a lovely dress of ruby silk. ' She wore a plush hat to mstch her cloak, ball and stately with nodding decorations, such as gentlemen find very nwkward at. the theatri cal matinees, and against which one of the free and independent states of America is about to pass a law. Before it comes hit» force it is to be hoped the fashion of exag gerated hats wilt have changed, though i' must be admitted that the prevailing fashions areno: unp:cture?<pie. Dolly Nore-<t; and Mrs.' Milbanke might have been presented to the most querulous American critic of fa!! hats as very pleasant arguments in their favour and one would not object to have had the two ladies put into competition with any two American beauties of their a:re. or indeed in competition with any two sisters of any other country, though of late year-3 America has claimed tho ¡iab.n.and. many Englishmen seem to have coneed-ed to them the claim for feminine beauty over'the old country and even- other. But no woman in all the world glows old as gracefully or beautifully as an English woman ' There is LadyMarchinouut. for in stance. She is nearly sixty; siie looks forty, has the voice of thirty, the manners of a matron, the heart of a girl; there is not a wrinkle in her face, nor a white hair in her head. And yet she docs not, as do many American ladies of licr age, dress as if she were twenty: she except» the fact of her age. assumes the role of a matron who is a grind mother, and preserves, as she will to her last days, a charm of manner and a womanly grace, which is exceptionally tho inheritance of Englishwomen. "Don't go on our account. Mr. Chot wyncl," said Mrs. Milbanke; " we only called because we were passing.and Dolly wondered what Mr. Forsyth was doing We have been calling on Lady Marchmount." " Many people there ?'* asked Philip. "Ko, twenty or thirty," said Dolly. ''The usual set ; members of Parliament's wives a prima donna engaged to sing, a thought reader and several persons from the Italian Embassy." " Many ladies V asked Philip, his mind runninsr on the woman of the opera, "Why I told you." said Dolly, "the same old set ; are you still dreaming ? There was a very pleasant man who knows "Venice well ; he says we ought to stay there at least two months—that for his pari ho could live there for ever ; and Jenny told him you are going to" have a studio there and paint., at which he was deeply in terested.'' " Oh, here you are," said Mrs. Millbanke, as the porter's wife entered with tea. " T ventured to ask for some tea, Mr. Forsyth." said Mrs. Milbanke. " I always think it is so delightful, tea in a studio ; and especial! v when there is no fuss and the men can go on smoking, Liberty Hall, as Mr. Samuel Swynford says." " Just so," said Ciietwynd. "Has Mr. Swynford made a fortune yet ?" " I am sure I don't know. He was very mysterious tho other night, with Walter about some Transvaal mines that are a cer tainty. T don't know whether he is a bull or ^fcirJ^'aki fibYt: tílft'in'iicv"J.ÓVo ;.í_, to have a holiday, lie has let V,"alter have a few shares." " "V\ hich I fear will settle poor Sam's ¡iros, pects," cliimedin Dolly, " as Walter told him : for if there is an unlucky follow in the world, it is Walter." "He does not think so." said Chetwynd : "at all events he does not look It when'lie is out with his wife and sister." " Ah, he is a dear fellow—Walter," re marked Dolly, sipping her tea, and suddenly remarking to Philip, " Won't you make me a cigarette? I might take one whiiT, eh í There was a Russian woman at Lady March mount's who .smoked a cigarette, much to everybody's surprise ; it is true she only smoked i¿ in the hall when shq was leaving. They say cigarette smoking grows on .one like dram drinking; ycur mother. Lady Forsyth, allows it at her Sunday Evening Mr. Philip?" Yes," Philiprcplied, "sheallaws many tilings which I dont think I would permit. " Walter won't let us smoke," said Mrs. Milbanke; " not that we want £o, but he won't have it at all, although hs himsdf smokes from morning till night." " Walter is very funny aboutliis smoking," said Dolly; "he says it is a gooÜ thing for the house, anda good thing for him, but a bad thing for women—taints their breath, makes them mannish which lie.hatos. But.you have got a rather mannish woman in your picture. Mr. Forsyth." "Do you think so ?" "Tes, but I supposo'she is intended to be tragic, oh ?" "Yes." "I thought so ; theyouiig man is dying of cold and weariness, and she' wants to help him, and.that Cossack soldier wonYlet her. What a look she gives Mm I ItwilT.be a fine picture." "Do you think .bp?" exclaimed' Philip, with a smile of satisfaction. "Dick is j.lcfued • with it." *' Thei: it Km"!: ho -.«.d," r¡'iuari-.ed Jenny, "if Mr. ('¡let v.-rnd (iiifilce ■■o, ami is not afraid to put hi-; thou-d-.ts into words.-' '' Indeed, ynu seen: in knoav me. _Vua..
