THE CHURCHES. ST. PETER'S Church (Anglican) was crowded yesterday morning, as it was expected that a confirmation service would be held. The Rev. A. J. Wheeler announced that, owing to Bishop Linton being dangerously ill, the confirmation could not take place. His Lordship is suffering from a serious internal complaint, which may necessitate an operation ; he left by the Adelaide express last night en route tor Melbourne, where he will be treated by Dr. Fitzgerald. It is probable that Dr. Kennion, of Adelaide, will administer confirmation to those who have been prepared therefor. The Rev. W. H. Connelly 1 preached at the Mica-street Roman Catholic Church at ll o'clock mass yesterday on the Epistle of the day, describing thedescentof the Holy Ghost on the Apostles. Miss Critchley sang the hymn, "Veni, Creator Spiritus," at the offertory in excellent style.
