A Ghost Story. "Talking of ghosts," said a traveller, "I had an experience once that nearly turned my hair gray, I arrived late at night in a little town out west where the only hotel was one of those amateur gimcrack places with worsted mottoes "on the-walls and plants in the windows. The landlord himself lighted me to my room, and saw that I was made comfort- able. I was dead tired and sleepy, and dropped-off the moment my head touched the clean, lace-bordered pillows. I was awakened, some time toward morning, from a sound sleep very suddenly, by a strange grating noise, and by the dim light I saw a man rise through the floor of the room. At first I thought he had come to murder me, but the longer I looked the more certain I became that, he was no mortal man. I' lay shaking' until daylight with my head buried in the bedclothes. ' "And then ?' Then I saw my own clothes neatly surmounted by my hat disposed on the 'frame of a dumb-waiter, where I had placed them when retiring- The land- lord had'hauled" them down, brushed them carefully,and sent them"up again, giving me a fright that nearly turned my brain.
