HOW TO AVERT TYPHOID. Di. T. E. HAYw?AuD, medical officer of health for Haydock, Lancashire, states in his annual report not only that typhoid is preventable, but also by what precise and simple means it may be prevented; and the ".Hospital," which has before had occasion to ex press approval of Dr. Hayward's intel ligence and thoroughness as a medical officer of health, commends with confi dence his tersely expressed. "Prin ciples of Typhoid Prevention," ns made public in his report:-" Typhoid is a preventable disease, says this authority. It is a disease of filth, and especially of the filth of human excre ment. That is to be taken as the be ginning of knowledge, the A B O of typhoid prevention, by theunscientifio. The next step it equally easy. Typhoid is a disease of bacilli, typhoid bacilli; and the bacilli we find in human ex crement, and n drinking water fouled by such excrement. It is probable that no man or woman ever takes typhoid except by swal lowing some typhoid bacilli. They may be swallowed, as we have said, in drinking water, or they may be flying about in the air in the neigh bourhood of typhoid excrement, and may be swallowed with mouthfuls of air. What, then, is the first and last commandment of typhoid prevention ? "Oleanliness; personal and public cleanliness." It is all there. If we keep ourselves clean; if we keep our drinking water clean; if we keep our closets and our drains, our kitchens, sculleries, gardens, streets, and towns entirely clean, typhoid will be practically as great a stranger to most of us as is the ghost of King Solomon.
