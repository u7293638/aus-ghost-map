J.1,-7 2 BonnyBclL'..i O'0 There is quite a lull in the betting. Tom Brown is the only line in which there is any movement for the Caulfield Cup at 100 to 7 to 100 to 8. Lord Exeter is under a cloud. Thunderbolt has been in demand for the Derby at 0 to 1, and then 7 To 1. Some wagering has been done on the double, Derby and Melbourne Cup at 1,000 to 10. Thunderbolt and First Chester being the former selection. The Leviathan has laid 5,000 to 28 against Anglesey in two wagers, and 1,000 to 10 against Hilltop. Nothing special was done on the training grounds this morning. At Caulfield Too Too, after a preliminary, went the Cup distance at the very best pace, doing the mile and a quarter in 2min. 19sec , the fastest of the morning. At Flemington St. John' and Country Boy went round the outside grass track, and Country Boy had much the better of it. St. John was subsequently scratched for the Caulfield Cup. , ,,, ,
