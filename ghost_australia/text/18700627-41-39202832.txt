C— Describit verbi quajsiti syllaba prima ?mne quod est nobis visuui, modo si sine vita; Membrum hominisque insigne asecunda et tertia dabant, Sensus, consilii sedem, actorum que bonorum. Corporis et mentis quoque motus significatur Veroo perfecto; si vis aenigma solutum, Proditur a timldo qui respicit acre periclum, Proditur atque ab eo alterius qui commoda quaerit. 852\.

He was a staunch teetotaller, though he never was known to say 'no' when invited to drink ale, gin, brandy, or rum. He was a vegetarian, but seldom or never tasted either bread, butter, cheese, or potatoes. Ue was the weakest of four fellow-servants, but as strong as half a dozen ordinary men. He never did any out-door work with a hat or cap on, and as for his coat he never threw it off but once a year. Tom was very useful at plough and other field work, but neither gifts nor punishments could induce him to saw wooa,-wait at table, or assist the cook. He detested tea, coffee, and chocolate, and what he did drink never ran down his throat. 855\. Double Acrostic, by H. Gardner. — 1\. ? 2\. A species of rose. ; 3. Astonishments, alarms.' i 4.

Bosher, R. J. L., Anon, W. G. RandalL Correct answers to No. 832, by A. Leschen, and to 824-7 by F. C. Bosher, incidentally omitted to be acknowledged last week. Problem 838. Two of our correspondents have pointed out that this problem was selected fromt tho first book of arithmetic published by the Irish Educational Com* mittee, page 86, No. 5. ' ' Problem 856. We have been obliged; '.to. alter this curious cryptograph to meet, the conveniences of the printers. It could not' be set up in the form in which it was sent to us. We may just hint that the consonants of the original are represented by other letters in accordance with a strict 'rule of substitution, and that the *, &c;, denote the vowels. Problem 840. The excessive improbability that the supposed event ever fortuitously occurred is shown by the answer. Or sup posing 1,000 whist players to play 300 evenings each year, and each party of four to have 200 hands dealt to them each evening, ? the probability is that the four player3of one of the parties would each hold a com plete suit only once in rather more than ono trillion four hundred and eighty-eight thou sand millions of centuries! Mr. J. 0. Hansen has furnished the following general formula : —Let p represent the number of players, -/ the number of cards each' is to have, and let the number of different sets of cards in tho pack equal to the number of players, theu the probability that each will hold a complete suit is ? ' . n — 1 (1X2X3... Xp) (1X2... ..X?) . ' w=— ? '— ? «' ? ? — ? ? — ? -?+l)te+2).-.: .....A:X7-tf that, is for four players, and the full pack rather less than ?V ? quadrillions. One or two instances of a simpler nature allowing an oversight of the case, may follow by way of illustration. Supposing the kings and queens are picked out of. a: complete set of cards, formiDg a new pack of only eight cards. Number of players is four, then 2-=4, 5=2, and ; (1X2X3X4) (1X2)» ??'?'? 10== — : — _ ? _ -=x$f, ».c, the , 3X4X5X...X8 case in question may occur once in 105. times.

The values sought for a in. this problem are not irrational quantities, although they are not exactly, integers.

DE TOP OF DE NEW POST OFFICE. .'.* The following was found wrapped round ? the melancholy remains of a German sausage, and has been attributed to an old Dutoh man named Mynheer Von Bloompstaa'rn. It would have appeared earlier, but unfor tunately the author was not a rapid com poser, his ordinary rate being that of two lines and §ths per week, including , spelling and grammar, varying according to the degree of inspiration imparted by four quarts of lager beer per day. At present he is in a very low and precarious stato, from a severe fracture of his meerschaum, so that this piece, written on the late ceremony of laying the foundation-stone on the top of the new Post-Office, will probably be his last. He must have been reading the report of the 'f proceeding of those rasn but sublimely '., courageous men who mounted to the top o£ ' the tower to perform the deed :— Oh! higher und higher dey plookily mountid, :?'?
