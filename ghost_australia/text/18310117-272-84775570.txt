INDIA AND AUSTRALASIA. {continued from our last.) -The native character of the Asiatics of all de- nominations, whether Medes, Persians, Assyrians, Turks, or Hindoos, is, and always has been, tinc- ted with sloth, luxury, selfishness, treachery, superstition and cruelty. Not even in British India has the example of the British, (to whom the Natives look as their protectors rather than their conquerors) been sufficient to cause an extinction of these pernicious habits : on the contrary, we find that even English people after a long resi dence in that country have imbibed them in a considerable degree. The peculiar construction of society, the various religious sects, the law of the caste and consequent ignorance of three fourths of the Hindoos, the barbarous and degra- ded idolitary which is prevalent, the very nature of the Shastras themselves, and the intense heat of the climate, all combine to prevent the remov- al of these fatal passions from the native people of India. Their religion being nothing but one comiued series of intrigue and deceit, mingled with the most barbarous immolations and human sacrifices to imaginary Gods, whose attributes are obscenity, voluptuousness and cruelty, cannot be expected to decrease these passions among the people. The Priests lor the most part lead a most vicious life, and even the anticipated Heaven of the Hindoo is nothing but the unrestrained indul gence of sensuality—by being born again in a condition to obtain it. Thus self and sense are the summum bonum of the Hindoo, they are made his hope, his Gods, they are by precept and ex- ample in various ways so laid before him by his religion and Priests, that while he remains a Hin doo he will be under their influence. This has prevented the good which might have been ex- pected from the example of the English, and has tended rather to confirm the habits of the Na-. _ tives than otherwise. However, we admit that the rising generation is much, very much improv- ed, and we have no doubt that the people of In- dia will still progressively lose these pernicious attributes which have been and are such a stain upon their national character. Still we may ven ture to set the Hindoos down as an indolent, trea cherous and selfish race. The British character, as we have before hinted, is not preserved by the British residents in Hindoostan in too many in stances; nevertheless the generality are British heart and soul, although in a great measure given up to luxury. This desire of ease and enjoyment is however so natural to man that we cannot in such a climate feel much surprised at it; indeed it is perhaps not very pernicious for it will ne- ver let the poor Englishman at any rate, sink into indolence— John Bull loves independence, ease and luxury as well as any one, but he will work hard to obtain it, and pursue his object even to to the very edge of avarice, sometimes over the precipice. An Englishman is a generous fellow^ but he always likes to look at home first, and says, while lie looks to his ledger, "my maxim is justice before generosity." As to the Indo Brit- ish, they appear to be a strange compound of the indolence of the Asiatics and the industry of the British, their pride is excessive, and their luxury extravagant, nevertheless there are many very amiable characters among them, and there is per- haps no people in the world who possess more of the amor patriæ than do the Indo British, com- monly called the East Indian Creoles. Generally speaking this passion is with them carried almost to enthusiasm, nothing is to them so great, so good, so beautiful, or so desirable, as those things produced in India, the beloved land of their na- tivity Thus we find in the East three classes of per- sons, the one powerful by right as well as num- ber, the second powerful by wealth and learning, the third powerful by numbers, wealth, as well as Byrne popped in a job with his left and got away; he then put in a right- handed body-blow and jumped back.

Fifteen millions of pub* lie wealth have now been profitably absorbed by these mighty ducts ; and at least half as much more is at this hour destined for their formation. Fifty years ago there was hardly a steam engine in the kingdom; there cannot now be less than twelve thousand— a creation of power equal to at least a Quarter of & million of horses — an enercv which, in a single day, would have raised up the great Pyramid or Egypt. ^ Fifty years ago, - our annual export of manufactured cotton did not amount to a quarter of a million in value ; it has now swollen to nearly .thirty millions* la. the same period, our exported woollens, in defi ance ef Saxon, Prussian, Spanish, aud American competition, have advanced more than two mil* lions. Fifty years ago, our imports of raw silk were only, three hundred thousand pounds in weight ; they are now near 3,000000. Fifty years ago, our export «f iron was hardly twelve thous and tons; it is now about ten times as much. ~ Fifty years ago, our exports «f linen were about four millions of yards ; they are now nearly forty millions. Fifty years ago, the k whole value of our exported produce, both native amF foreigo, was just fifteen millions of money ; — the value of British produce exported, alone, is now more than fifty millions,— A hundred and fifty years ago, says old Tucker, there were only two or jy&€JL^§£ej4nnJ5co^ — our whole Tonnage is now more than a Quarter of ? and fifty years ago, says.
