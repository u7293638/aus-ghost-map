THE THEATRES, &c.; THEATRE ROYAL. "THE CORSICAN BROTHERS." This well known melodrama, which once held a front place among the productions of the French sensational school, was revived at the theatre Royal on Saturday night. The success of the piece depends largely upon scenic effect, and some complicated rare chemical appliances are required for its adequate representation In these respects the resources of the Theatre Royal are fully equal to the occasion, so the vision of the fatal duel k HA the Biiowclad forest of 1 Fontainebleau, v, over-all the accompaniments of the event as it occurred, was represented in the most realistic way, and the ghost of the slain twin brother with the ghastly wound on the left breast, rOBe gradually through the stage, advancing after the approved manner of phantoms, and then vanishing through the clock case as though it were a real apparition from the spirit world The masked ball scene was also spiritedly represented, though there was room on the stage for a larger number of masque riders Mr Cathcart doubled for the twin brothers Louis and Fabien del Franchi, and was equally effective in depicting the Corsican in his own home, the melancholy madness of the lot er who discovers in Paris that the lady he was in search of is married to another, and the determination of the man who is resolved to avenge the insult of Chateau Renaud As the avenging brother, who delivers himself of some high sounding but slightly illogical remarks on the art of polished murder before proceeding to slaughter his foe, however, be did not, as we have seen some actors, produce the thrilling effect of one who is the personifi- cities of destiny, and with whom it is vain for the most skilful swordsman in France to cope Mr Carey a Chateau Renaud was tame It was not sufficiently polished for the gay 1 ansian man of fashion, nor did his manner add much to the weird interest of that duel scene, in which he is made to feel beforehand that his last hour has come The combat was sufficiently real, audit was watched with that interest which these contests always excite Mr Stuart O'Brien represented appro treated) the head of the Orlando family, whose vendetta is brought to an end by the mediation of friends Stage tradition, for some inscrutable reason, gets the Colonna to a low comedian, and Mr Greville availed himself of the opportunity to make tins per Eonago supremely ridiculous, and as little like the hero of a Corsican vendetta as could well be imagined. Mrs Bryer was effective as Madame de Franchi, and Miss Lester was decidedly ineffective as Emilio de Lesparre the three nymphs of the supper party found lively representatives in the Misses Carrington, Bryce, and Maynard Mr Cathcart and Mr Carey were called before the curtain at the end of the last act The performances commenced with the comedietta of "Peter White, in which Mr Greville has a congenial part the same programme will be repeated this evening The OPERa "AIDA This opera of Verdi, which is certainly to be classed amongst the most earnest minded of his works, was reproduced on Saturday night at the Opera house with a fair measure of success Signor Paladini!, who played the part of Radames, had but recently recovered from the acute attack of illness which we had to notice when the same work was played lately Signora Link, we were informed, had been in but indifferent health during the greater part of last week, and as the effect of this there was to be noticed that her voice lacked somewhat of the freshness and glorious ring for which it is under ordinary circumstances distinguished Miss Agnes Palma, who has sung but little of late, seems to have made excellent use of the time during which she has not been before the public Here was the free voice of the ci ening, superior in quality as we have always known it to be, and fresh as being at its best viUhollthc captivating qualities of power, sweetness, and sympathy in tone Mr Verdi at times sang a little roughly, as one would do if he were careless of his voice, and did not exercise it upon art principles, but this was only to be noticed by those who were critically inclined There was so much in his action, in his picturesque appearance, and in the genial warmth and fervour of his singing to absorb the attention of the audience, that they were warmed by the general effect of his performance to express areas of high admiration Mr C H Templeton as RamfiB the High Priest, was use for and respectable We do not often mention the name of Mr Angier, and the time has not yet come when we can do so in any terms of praise He played the part of the King, but it would have been of great advantage to the performance of some member of the company having a little voice had been employed to sing the music of the part Signor Paladini was tame throughout, and therefore we need not describe the manner in which he sang the separate tenor numbers in. each act, but congratulate; him upon his restoration to health thus do, away expect a much more spirited performance from him on Monday night Signora Link was listened to with great interest and much pleasure in each scene in which she appeared Her great scene in the third act, where her father Bpnrna her ("NonBei mia fights'), a passage which occurs in the duet commencing "dihedral le forests imbalsamato, was one of great dramatic power-one, in deed in which both she and Mr Verdi de Gery e the highest praise Miss Palma gained a well deserved recall for her impassioned and impressive performance in the scene with Radamca and the scene of his con decoration, in the fourth act The spectacular effects and the ensemble music were greatly admired Aida will be given once more to night ACADEMY OF MUSIC HMS PINAFORE There was a crammed house at this theatre on Saturday evening, to witness the first performance of Messrs Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera of "HMS Pinafore, or the Lass that Loved a Sailor " The work is an elaborate satire in two acts, the language, the plot, the situations, and the music having been all conceived and composed in a spirit of merry mockery The first laughs at that system of political favouritism under which the wrong man gets into the wrong place, and an attorney s office boy Scramble into Parliament, when he becomes rich, and is appointed First Lord of the Admiralty on account of his numerous disqualifications, his promotion giving him occasion to offer the following sage advice, founded upon his own personal experience - of landsmen all, whoever you may be, If you want to rise to the top of the tree, is your job isn't lettered to an office stool, Be careful never guided by this golden rule - Stick close to your desks and never go to son, And you all may be rulers of the Queen a Nave The frequent refrain, too, of "And so do his sisters and his cousins, and his aunts " is a pleasant gibe at that system of official nepotism with which we are just as well acquainted in this colony as the people at home are XV hethertheRightHon JosephPorter.K C B , is intended as a caricature upon Mr Childers of Mr. W. H. Smith, we need not stop to inquire, but there can be little doubt that the relaxation of the old rigorous discipline in the Royal Navy, and the tendency which has been exhibited by the Admiralty to go to the opposite extreme and noddle the seamen, have offered Mr Gilbert a tempting theme for badinage, of which he has availed him self to the fullest extent When, in a moment of intense excitement, Captain Corcoran incautiously blurts out a proscribed epithet, with which we shrink from Boiling our columns, and his cousin Hebe, and the First Lord repeat it several times by way of expressing their horror of it, Sir Joseph Porter orders the offender to hut cabin, in accents of the sternest rebuke - " I will hear of no defence, Attempt none If you are sensible, That word of evil sense Is wholly indefensible, Oo ribald get you here To your cabin with celerity This is the consequence of all advised asperity Thus all shall learn ere long To refrain from language strong, For I haven't any sympathy for 111 bred ' taunts, Chorus - be more liar of his sisters and his cousins and his aunts And these esteemed relations crop up continually with diverting unexpectedness As to the plot and situations, they are just exaggerations of those of dozens of nautical dramas, and of scores of sea stories w of all know the originals of the gallant captain and his beautiful daughter of the brave and tuneful sailor who has fallen in love with her of that wicked Dick Deadcye, who is always turning up as a mischievous marplot, when and where he is least wanted , of the red faced boatswain and of Mrs Cripps, the beaming, buxom, bum boat woman, while the airs and concerted pieces they sing, the recitative they decision, and the music composed for them by Mr Sullivan, are the most demurely droll burlesques upon opera send you could well listen to There is the soprano, who parades the main deck, and utters her in passioned sentiments to the stay a and shrouds, and to any human being within hearing, in brave disregard of appearances, as well as of the ordinary usages of every day life, and there is the tenor, equally nice tinent of speech and song, who talks and octaves all operatic heroes do in a way that would cause him to be locked up in the watch-house if he attempted any thing like it in the public streets, and there is tenor number two, who serenades the moon with his guitar, expostulating with the bright regent of the heavens, because everything below is " either at sixes or at sevens and there is the sententious bum boat woman, who as formerly a baby farmer, and oracularly utters proverbial philosophy in every way worthy of Tupper, at g - " Things are seldom what they seem, Skim milk masquerades as cream, Hellions ] ass as patent leathers, Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers to which the Captain replies "Very true, so they do and 3 afterwards informed by Mrs Cripps, better known as Buttercup, on account of her innocence and sweet sun plicity, TI each 1 many thing; but clever, I could talk like that for ever And then there are the male and female choruses, who come on according to their wont in opera, without any rational motive, make a tremendous noise, and go off again, without any satisfactory reason, their Costumes, their method of arranging themselves, and their furtive glances at the conductor in the orchestra, being strictly selon les singles According to custom, the words they sing bear as small a proportion to their musical setting 63 the slice of ham used to do to the enveloping bread in a Vauxhall Bandivich One of the best and greatest of the choruses is that which forms part of the finale of the first act It describes the typical British sailor 1 His nose should pant and his lips should curl. His checks should flame, and his Inow should furl, His bosom should heave and his heart should glow, And his fist be ci cr ready for a rou Ills foot should stamp and his throat should grow!, His hair should Inlrl and his face should colt I, Hissey CB should flash and his breast ] intrude, And this should be his customary attitude The music throughout is full of brightness, sparkle, and pleasantry There are remi licences and suggestions in it of many operas and it has been composed in a spirit thoroughly congenial with that which has animated the writer of the libretto The cast was as follows -Sir Joseph Porter, Iv C. B. , First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr Lingard , Captain Corcoran, Mr I Orde, Ben Backatay, Mr Deering, Ralph Rackstraw, Mr Skinner, Dick Deodoy e, Mr Hall, Josephine, Miss Lingard , Little Buttercup, Mrs Hall, and Hebe, Miss L Vi seman Of these, Miss Lingard, Mr and Mrs. Hall, Miss Wiseman, and Mr Deering seemed to comprehend and enter into the fun of the thing, albeit a severe cold from which Mr Hall was suffering operated greatly to his disadvantage in speaking and singing, but his noting and make up were excellent Miss Lingard was as ultra sentimental as could be desired, and travestied the style of operatic pi time done with agreeable v vivacity, while Mrs Hall and her sister were well fitted with parts as the gunboat woman and Cousin Hebe respectively, the former delivering her budget of proverbs and her legend of the changelings, and the second leading off the refrain concerning the First Lords "Sisters and his cousins and his aunts " with true vis mica Of the representatives of that great official personage, the First Lord, of Ralph. Rackstraw, and of the captain of H. M. S. Pinafore, it must be complained that they took the whole affair too much as serious They seemed to lose sight of the fact that they were playing a burlesque on all operas, that every word of the songs, duets, and trios required to be distinctly articulated, and all the humorous points sharply brought out, and that the very method of their execution should smack of extravaganza Consequently some of the most telling portions of the libretto and the music failed to excite the laughter ; berth W have everywhere else provoked, and which they are sure to elicit here when the three performers we have named throw themselves into the piece with the requisite verve and abandon The "set' which represents the deck of the vessel with a view of Portsmouth in the background was very well arranged, and we have no doubt that the second performance of ' H. M. S. Pinafore ' this evening will go very much better than the first, which was a success desire, but ought to become a ÍIÍCCÍS den thusiasm ST GEORGE S HALL "R M S PINAFORE The simultaneous production of the same piece at two theatres is a rare occurrence in Melbourne, managers generally finding it the reverse of profitable to enter into such close rivalry in a comparatively limited circle of play goers On Saturday night, however, those desirous of witnessing the performance of Sullivan and Gilbert's new nautical comic opera " H. M. S. Pinafore were offered the choice of seeing it in its entirety' at either the Academy of Music or St Georges Hall, and thanks to the excellent reputation which Mr Stewart and 113 daughters have won, if the former theatre was crowded the latter was also filled in every part of the piece itself we have already spoken in our notice of its production at the Academy As to the manner of its representation at St George's Hall it may be justly said to reflect great credit on those to whose labours so complete a presentation was due The numerous choruses were rendered in a manner which evinced careful and repeated rehearsal, the orchestra, under the direction of Mr Harcourt Lee, was full and efficient, and the solo singing, being left chiefly to Mr and the Misses Stewart, was it is hardly necessary to say, very satisfactorily performed To speak of the principal performers individually, Mr R Stewart, as Sir Joseph Porter, First Lord of the Admiralty, merits premier notice for the abundance of broad humour which he infused into his impersonation of that " much relationed knight Sir Joseph's autobiographical Song (an adapta- tion of the similar narration by the judge in the same author B " Trial by Jury ') was given with an unction and relish which provoked the audience into roars of laughter The satire of the " golden rule which con I eludes the song which is even here applicable tests The Nelson-was especially appreciated Miss Nellie Stewart took the port of Ralph Rackstraw, and looked so neat and handsome a young tar that the indiscretion of the captains daughter in falling in love with an A B was, under such circumstances, very excusable She sang admirably, though the music was hardly suited to her voice, and her acting showed that she had thoroughly conceived the serio-comic spirit of the character Nothing could have been more drolly done than Ralphs declaration of love in a Johnsonian sentence, and his concluding query, " I hope I make myself clear'" As Josephine, the captains daughter, Miss Docy Stewart was fairly successful as to her acting, and completely as in her Bulging Had she not made it so apparent to the audience that she was burlesquing throughout.shewouldhave more fully realised the character Miss Maggie Stewart was excellently got up as Little Buttercup, the business woman, and both sang and played well As Dick Dcadeye, A 15, Mr George Leopold had a character to paper BOtiatc which he might easily have over done - and perhaps with the result of rendering it more ludicrous, to the " finds at least but he resisted the great tempta- tion Though the character is not one which affords much scope for Mr Leopold a peculiar vein of broad humour, he can be credited at least with having made the utmost possible use of his material Of the innumerable cloud of Sir Joseph Porter s female relations, Miss Blanche Leopold, as Ina first cousin Miss Hebe, had the most prominent part, and she evinced much humour in the manner in which she broke in with the amusing refrain as to the knights " sisters, cousins, and aunts ' Mr B Anthony played the character of Captain Corcoran, and he is the only one of the principal performers of whom it must be said that he was out of place. The fact is certainly due to a circumstance over which Mr. Anthony had no control, but nevertheless it is somewhat startling to an audience to find a foreigner (judging from his accent, a German in command of one of Her Majesty a ships of war Mr Anthony, however sang very fairly, and after a time the audience appeared partially to forget his alien accent Of the subordinate performers, it is sufficient to say that as a whole they rendered efficient assistance the piece was well placed on the stage, a fine view of Portsmouth by Mr H Gnat being particularly effective the piece will be repeated this evening TOE TOVi N HALL ORGAN There was a good attendance of the lovers of organ music at the town hall on Saturday night when Mr David Lee performed a variety of very pleasing selections The over turn to " La Dame Blanche, by Boieldieu, was the first on the programme We have described the performance of it before this was followed by two andante movements by v ely, one in B flat, and the other in B flat The latter of these two was a very gem in its way A melodious and richly harmonised movement in the style indicated is accompanied by a beautiful ornamentation of piccolo arpeggios, or, as one who heard it said as if a choir of happy birds were piping responsively from the outside of a church to the noble strains of the organ played within it Mr Lees grand fantasia on English airs found great favour with the audience The following airs, connected together by some of the happiest modulations ever heard, were included in this fantasia, namely, "The British Grenadiers, "My Pretty Jane, " Hearts of Oak, "Lads and Lasses, " Vi appmg Old Stairs (beautifully played) "The Lass of Richmond hill, " The Bay of Biscay, "Home, Sweet Home (too much overladen with ornament), and Rule Britannia Wagner's grand march from "Tannhauser was played with great spirit The recitative, "Deeper, and deeper still, from "Jepbtha, was a masterly performance in point of reading and execution, and so were the choruses from the same work which followed it The entertainment concluded with the National Anthem
