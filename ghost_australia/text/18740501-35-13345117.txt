I From the Free Press, April 20.) j THE foundation stone of the addition now being made to All Saints' Church was laid on Tuesday At 11 o'clock div me ten ice was held in the church At the conclusion of the service the company adjourned to the back of the church, where a temporary platform had been erected, upon which the Metropolitan, the Bishop of Bathurst, the clergy of the diocese, and a large number of ladies and gentlemen took up their positions After the 48th hymn had been sung in the choir, the Metropolitan read a portion of a special service, and the Bishop of Bathurst read a prayer suited to occasion The Rev. Canon Smith then presented, on behalf of the Building Committee, a beautifully wrought silver trowel and mallet to the Metro pol tan, each bearing the following inscription -" Pro sented to the Lord Bishop of Sydney on the occasion of his laying the foundation stone of the enlargement of All Sums Cathedral, Bathurst, April 28, 1874 ' A mallet, bearing the same inscription upon inlaid silver, but with the name of changed, was also presented by Canon Smith to Mr W H Suttor, and to Mr. G. H. Cox, M.L.A., of Mudgee and the rev gentleman then read a copy of the document, which, with the local papers, had been placed in a bottle ready for being deposited in the country under the stone. The bottle having been placed, the stone was lowered, and declared by the Metropolitan to be well and truly laid in the name of the father, Son, and Holy Ghost The Rev Canon Smith then read a list of the names of gentlemen who had subscribed towards the cost of alterations, with the sums given by each, from which it appeared that the large amount of £2160 had been collected. The Bishop of Sydney then briefly addressed the assembly He said he would make his words as few as he could An address of exhortation to give liberally was not needed, for they had already given the greater portion of that which was required, and the time for exhorting them to give was past He congratulated his dear friends the Bishop of Bathurst and Canon Smith upon the success which had crowned their labours He felt himself between two very important services , the one in which they were now engaged, the inauguration of the further extension of the building of their old cathedral, and the other the commencement of the second sitting of the Synod of the Bathurst Diocese When he looked around him he could not but feel that God Almighty had abundantly blessed the efforts of his servants in this diocese He remembered how not very long ago his old friend Mr. Suttor, who was present, had stood by his Bishop when the proposal to separate this diocese from the diocese of Sydney was first made, and he could assure them that it was mainly to his courage and liberality that they were indebted for the present existence of the Bathurst diocese He was sure they did not need him to point out the advantages of having a Bishop resident in Bathurst, neither was it needful for him to allude to the advantages of having a workman like Canon Smith in their midst He was glad to see Mungoo represented in the person of Mr Cox, for at one time there was likely to be a slight difficulty, as Mudgee was a place of great importance, and some there thought they were as much entitled to a Bishop as Bathurst The difficulty had been overcome, however, and he was glad to see Mr. Cox present That gentleman had been to Mudgee what Mr Suttor had been to Bathurst, and all were willing to work in unity as in one Western diocese under the supervision of one Bishop He had no other feeling than gratitude to God for what he had done for the Church of England in Australia, and was full of confidence that what had been commenced would be, under the Almighty's blessing, carried on, and that all the work of the Church of England in this land would be progressively successful If they continued to labour munity they would be able to bring to a happy conclusion the work which they had that day commenced The Bishop of Bathurst expressed the pleasure he felt in welcoming the Metropolitan again to Bathurst to take part in the ceremony The city five years had elapsed since the building to which they were making additions had been consecrated He explained that owing to indisposition the Hon. J Campbell had been prevented from coming, and said that he would not detain them with a speech He would, however, congratulate all concerned on the success which had attended their efforts and the favourable aspect of affairs at the present time Messrs Suttor and Cox then briefly addressed the assembly Rev Canon Smith also said a few words He alluded to the anxiety with which he had looked forward to that moment, and the care and thought which the cost of the addition to the Cathedral had cost him The cost, as they know, would amount to about £1919, and although they had a large sum towards paying that off, yet he was determined to give them no rest until the whole amount had been promised and paid He thanked them most heartily for what they had done, but he thanked them for what they would do more than all, and he looked forward with confidence to the future, that they would liquidate all the expensej»t5nne^»ic,lwltn the improvements to the building ^chhaddonoVr WP*J°J">U He, wasser that all those who had given tomato the object would be satisfied when they saw the worK compared, not only with the beauty of the structure, beneath the increased accommodation which it would offer to those who attended the worship of God in the Cathedral. , "*"> , ... Those present were then invited to lay their cVflfeibubons on the stone, and in answer to the invitation many stepped forward and did so, the result being that between £30 and £40 as subscribed.
