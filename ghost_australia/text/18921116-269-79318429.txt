Unrequited Love. «Sth I hadbeen absent from mv native town for two jfiMS.; -':feiiy return I went to the theatre , Sheiras Qiere. and I saw her. Was it tier beauty tliiit made her the cvno^urn of fell eyes? Everybody m the parquet was staring up at t>Jie di»-ectif>u of her box. I alone did nutrf^ure *t> look up. My conscience would n t let me At la<t, moved bv a*i irresistibie impul-e, I summoned lip courage Our eyes met I. was horrified beyondexpre^eion, I at' once un ierstood why everybody Id ke i at i«er when she entered. ' Wretche . unfortunate Henriftte,' I paid to myeelf, and I bifcmy lip uutil it bled. I even wished that I was dead. One of my neighbors pulled»at my coat sleeves and said: 4 Do you see. that girl up in the box there ? Ib it not. strange ros-e mch a young creature as that with snow - wiiite hair ?' * What a pitv,' sard an >ther. * She has such beautiful bla<\--k eve^.' * i'f we had « novelist amongst u-,' said a third, * he would find stuff for an exciting novel like those of Hemrich Heine, in which the reader does riot know "h ether to laugh or to cry , young ^ves and gray hair. 'What ;» strange contrast! . I could have choked these dudes to death, to hear then? sp ak of her in that way. An last the curtain went up. ! don tknow what it> was they played on the stage. The people laughed, but ' felt miserable beyond all des seription. My tongue clove to the roof of iny mouth. I would have rushed out had . not some unseen force kept me in the place where my victim was The perspiration .stood upo« mv forehead, and I c »uld feel and hf-ar my heart beat like a trip-hammer. 4X wdi bet anything in the world,' said one, that tint unfortunate girl, as she was walk ing out some night, saw a ghost, and her hair turned white alimost. immediately. ' I have k no war well authenticated cases- of that -kind.'. ? : : ' Nonsense,' said another, there are no such things as ghosts; I am a doctor and can ex plain to you how, with certain peop'e, white hair--' ? ' O, if you are going to treat on the sub ject froma scientific standpoint, I don't want to h«ar it. I know well enough that it is im possible for the hair of. a young girl to turn white without there is some extraordinary cause for it. "Perhaps her husband was murdered in her arms/ siig nested another. 'Perhaps her child fell from her arms <m* of an open window into the street, and dashed its brains out on the stone side walk.' ' I beg your pardon, gentlemen, but I think aH of your ghesses, are wrong. She is too mother. * She does noteeeiyx to lin* ?>»! "nrirfrnrm 3 . ' §3^.-3^4f "s ..\\*Areyoir^ withher ?* X was silent.. * It 16 very clear to me, and to everybody who knows anything about the power of passion, that thi* young girl with gray hair, is the victim of som* disappointment in love* Some scoundrel has deceived her.' la my excitement I forgot wherel was, andseizing the hand of the speaker, I said: : ' Not Another word. I am a villain. I don?t deserve that the light of the sun should shine on me.' I don't know what the listeners thought about my conduct, but fortunately at this moment" the orchestra began to play and the curiam went up. I didn't see anything that was done on the stage. I was *hlnki"g how I had promised to love and protect her for ever, and how I had gone back on her in such a disgraceful way. I" knew thit I 'had poisoned her young life, that I had broken her heart, and thafc l was the cause of her gray hair, and once more I sighed becaiise I was not in the ^enttomb. * Miserable wretch/ said I to mrself. is Kr not possible for you to repair th6 injury you have committed. Carried away by this idea and driven by remorse, I determined to restore her to happmeBS, if nossible. I suddenly left the theatre, aB the pieceseemed to be approach ing the last act. Somebody seized me by the band, «nd I looked up ' 'Arnold!' I exclaimed. 'Felix, are you here again ?' We shook each other heartily by the hand. ... * How pale youare,' exclaimed Arnold. 4 Have youseen her ?' I asked. 'Who.* * Henrietta.' ?' I have juBt left her. She is very much changed.' . ' Don't speak of it,' I said trembling. *1 am an unworthy wretch. There is no pun ishment that I do not deserve.' ; * Whathe exclaimed laughing, * are -you the scoundrel and humbug ?' * Humbug?' . -»lidn't you hear about the afiair: About a month ago Henrietta bought some ha«r stuff from a fellow who was travelling around with pomade and hair oil. As sooi as she put some of the stuff on her hatr .il began to lose its cok»r and gradually turned gray.' 'Pomade? Iexclaimed- .'Then it is not hopeless love ?' and the words died on my quivering lips.. " Hopeless hjvet' he said. hdf laughing. * Why no, we have been married for the last eighteen months and we are perfectly happy fwid eati'fied with <each other. It doesn't If p. any differenee to me whether my wife has gray or black hair.' \- * Your wife! Eighteen months!' ' Does that excite your surprise ? What makes you blush so ? O! yes. now I )ne member. My wife was tellingme about f»u the other day ' * 0, the women, the women.'.
