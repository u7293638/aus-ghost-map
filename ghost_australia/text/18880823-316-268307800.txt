A garden lies before-, us; -• sloping -gradually tn the river, and filled - witli all the; sweeteBt perfumes of bud and blossom— an old-fashioned garden—where the. -Lentlilies bent. their -graceful heads, and .the tall narcissi shared the honors with monthly roses. A • pretty Jiouse, of the .cottage type, though 1 built ivith plenty of space at command, andjshowing outhouses and stabling, in its rear, -bespoke 'the inhabitants to -be sufhciently Messed wit-h^this world's goods to li< r e lA -,co"mfort, -^^anyl-rite, -^!nor in ab olute luxuiy. Seated under, a -spreading sycamore with somedainty em broidery inherhand, was a, girl of,surpassing, grace and beauty ; one glance at-the pure oval of her face, at the deep gray of her; eyes,' and the golden blow 11 of her hail, " uuuing over with curls," to say nothing oE lier supple figure and taper hands. and; feet, and.you woulduot feel surprised to hear, what was indeed a fact, that Beatrice -Conway.had been '' the beauiyf '-gar exscUence, ;of. t last three seasons. ; There was, however, a tinge-of melancholy in the. wistfuldroop -of-lier rosy lips,; which suggested the fact; that though an heiress,-as well as a beauty Ehe-was'nofc entirely liappy or fiee from c re. JTlitlmg about from shrub to bush, and from blossom to berry,- as 'fancy alone dictated, and gradually.^ filling, tlie 'basket slio ,: carried 111 her-hand • with all the spoils of the garden, was another girl" The two Were much alike, but-this : one was younger, brighter,. fairer, sand' evi-- dently happier than her cousin, for such was the degree of lelationslup betneen the two Beatrice, the elder cousin, -uas the; owner of: the Jiretty-rcottage,. where also dwelt her aunt and cousin Gladys An almost sisterly-affection. existed between •the two girls.

This yas said in a jokmg manner, but when Beatrice saw the rosebud month be • ginning to pout and the brown eyes fill with tears, she dreV her cousin tenderly to her side, and finished in quite a serious manner. "Gladys, darling,-whenever I look at youi bright face and Hunk of your happiness, I always feei so thankful you arc able to marry the first man y011 er cared for, who is in every way Worthy of you— jou musa'tmmd me, dear.
