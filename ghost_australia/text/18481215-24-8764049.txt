ORIGINAL POETRY. A CHRISTMAS CAROL. BY "PHAX." OH bless you, merry gentlemen, May nothing you dismay; For this is the time to chant the rhyme Of the Christmas merry lay. In olden times, on British shore, The carol was sung from door to door; The waits a night--by day the chimes-- So merrily passed those bye-gone times! While the yule log was burning bright, In blindman's buff we took delight; So pure that pleasure--without alloy-- We could'nt control our youthful joy. The wassail bowl, and jug of stout, Which banished the thought of the cold without; The white snowy flakes, the ice and the haze, We cared not for in those happy days. The merry shout and the laughing eye-- The pudding hot and cold minced pie-- The country dance and magic spell-- And stories of ghosts old dames would tell. Oh, where is the mistletoe That once in hall was hung-- The plaintive lay, floating on the blast, Which by mendicants was sung. Alas! those times are gone, Those merry happy times; You hear not the carol of other days Nor the merry Christmas chimes. But to make the English pudding rare The fates will not deny you; With currants, plums, spice, and peel E. GILBERT can supply you. So bless you, merry gentlemen, May nothing you dismay; For this is the time to chaunt the rhyme Of the Christmas merry lay. 2786
