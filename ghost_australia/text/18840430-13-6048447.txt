Ellul practitioner who was foiled by the Austrian Crown Prince Mr Bastian deserves the reputation of being one of the most successful of the Amen an mediums who from time to time alight upon the coasts of old Europe in order to introduce the ' notions of Now world wizards to the credulity of fashionable persons in search of sensation and secularist men of science who having repudiate 1 religion naturally crave for super stilton I or a considerable period of time it regular intervals the American spiritualist had visited Vienna an 1 so surprising were his manifestations so complete his familiar it with the unseen world so as) the terms of acquaintance on which he sto< with the departed all conditions of life and of all ages of history that not a few believed in his miracles and a still larger number paid for admission to his extra dear) performances A member of the local aristocracy Baron Ilellciibaeh became an entire convert to the reply sentations of the 1 runs Atlantic worker of wonders and was the means of founding a sort of spiritualist c moderation in the good city of Vienna A certain dim religious obscure) was always necessary to the production of the manifestations i his is a usual concomitant of the proceeding, I he spirits appear to be uniformly weak sighted and refuse to make themselves visible in a distressing glare In other respects the ceremony was imposing Stretched in a mesmeric trance in another room the medium lay unmoved and immovable Mean time there appeared in the midst of the ring of spectators in the nt Nt chamber a ghostly form waving gossamer robes and talking on silent feet. 1 emboldened by) success or unable to avoid the ordeal of the highest au fitness Mr Bastian had the honour of holds ' a sun a before the Archdul e Rudolph Ilia I o) ii and Imperial Highness took the precaution to make certain inquiries He learned that the door between the entranced medium and the room in which the manifestations occurred was always removed and heavy cart up substituted Other a people seem to have at once admitted that the sun it world may quite innocently have its preference in the matter of baritones and furniture as well as in the matter of lowered lamps an 1 darkened windows The Archduke was less unsuspicious The Archduke John of 1 scanty became the ready accomplice of the 1 mice It was arranged that the mystic meeting, should take place in his palace two rooms communicated, by the usual doorway were shown to Mr B stain and accepted as just the thing for the ghostly phenomena. The day came for the performance of the wonder All Vienna was in commotion the spirit world may be as signed to have been similarly situated though not unaccustomed to royal and imperial personages in the shades it is to be supposed that it is not every day that even ghosts of high antiquity and unblemished descent can pique themselves upon the pay i lege of being presented in courtly circles upon earth And what an opportunity was now presented to the legitimate ambition of the boldest propagandists from the spirit and the conversion of the Heir of the Hapsburg might well entrain the conversion of his august parents and his numerous and illustrious connexions Austria Hun lady is above all things a loyal region If he could doubt-not certainly a far seeing spirit-that the contagion of so eminent an example would spread through Viennese society from the Hofburg the current of con- tration would circulate in the Ringstrasse Pesth would not be backward in emulating the imperial zeal of the Austrian capital His magnates whose ancestors had rushed to glory or the grave for their monarch Mann, there might be expected to adopt table turning and mystic nipping in a kindred mood of dutiful fervour The fashion of lowered lumps would spread from the Iron Gates to the borders of Saxony 1 looting fiddles and armless hands would wander among the teacups and above the lager beer, along the stream of the Danube and in the saloons of the Prayer And all this was to be accomplished by a simple son of the free republic beyond the Atlantic, by one of nature sun tutored children who had perhaps heard the dread secret whispered to him by the medicine man of some vanishing tribe of Mohicans or Susquahob is in lands never polluted by the traces courtiers and crumbling thrones on a played out Old Continent Vi hen Mr Bastian the Yankee child of mystery settled himself down to his mes mine sleep there was a distinguished com- party assembled in the outer room Along with the Crown Prince there were the Archduke John of 1 scanty, the Archduke Hec. mer, Prince Batthyam General Mensscnc, hen of course Baron Hellenbach, who had come to see the triumph of his prophet, and a select circle besides It is possible that most of the spectators were spellbound by the solemnity of the scene by the muffled lights by the silent room by the' doorway v ith its heavy drapery, and above all by the consciousness of the great magician sunk in mystic slumber in the room beyond It as possible also that some gentlemen to whom the Archduke's had communicated the secret of certain precautions watched with redoubled v vigilance in order to prevent the remotest chance of deception being successful supposing that, after all the American child of nature was capable of deceit During the hours which had elapsed since the pre phet undertook to produce his manifestations in the Archduke Johns palace, certain changes had been effected which, without being evident on the surface had cruelly altered the real character of the intervening doorway for the unsuspecting visitors from another life the door had been removed as Mr Bastian required the heavy curtain hung down in its place as Mr Bastian required But in addition a sliding screen of sufficient substantiality had been arranged to fall on the touch of a spring and completely close the doorway to all mortal ingress or egress Of course, an impalpable spirit could not be stopped by such a material centre ance, and besides, the sliding panel was not to work until the spirit had fairly begun business I Expectation was on tiptoe. I he magician was slumbering profoundly The guests strained their eyes through the gloom. TherE of a certainty was the spirit Clothed in waving robes moving on noiseless footfalls, the mysterious shape passed before the witnesses Archduke Rudolph s hand touched the spring Some thing creaked the spirit made for the floating curtain in the doorway but stumbled against a solid obstacle The gifted Mr Bastian had come in from his mesmeric slumbers, and, attired in a voluminous robe over his evening suit and shoeless feet, stood revealed to the laughing circle The American child of nature has failed to overcome the Old World prejudices of the Austrian Empire.
