A TRAGEDY QV THE SEA, . The British ship Euxine, bo ana from JSortn Shields for Aden, was destroyed liy fire in the South Atlantic in Augus: last. The crew took to the boats, which soon separated from each other. The occupants of one boat lost all their provisions and water, and, after enduring the pangs of hun ger for ;ome time, drew Jots to decide which of ham cIiauM lia lrillp.ri tn nl'AflprVft thn livAR of hifi companions.. The lot fell upon an Italian Bailor, who was killed and cut up. Only a few houra afterwards the others wer.e picked up by the Dutch ship Java Packet. The Batavia M-iiitlel$blad, of December (5, says: 'For several days they. had eaten nothing, and had endeavoured to quench thirst by sea water, so that one of-tUca, wholly exhausted, strove to stab . liimselt in -despair, lie was, however, restrained by tlie others, who proposed that, under the circumstances, it should be .decided by lot which \ of the six should be the first victim to save his comrades for awhile from death by hunger. In conformity with this plan, six pieces of wood of varying length were cut ; the mats held them in his'hand, and each of the men drew out one â€” he -who drew the longest was to fall. Francis Shufus, an Italian, was the unfortunate whom the lot assigned for it; Meekly and without a murmur he submitted, and soon he gave up the ghost under the knife cf his hungry fellows. Some hours afterwards, and when they had just commenced their horrid ineal, a sail was sighted on the horizon, whither course was ini ine-..iately shaped. On the evening of the same day (AuguBt 31) the five rescued persons, con. pletely exhausted, reached the deck of the Java 1 acnei. captain iruppeu uuu ulb buljuiuiuulgs immediately did nil they could by careful treat ment 'to make the five unfortunates forget as much as possible tlie misery suffered. Their remaining comrades in the two other boats have, according to a Lloyd's telegra'fiof.to^iy, arrived safe at, St. Helena, without accident.'
