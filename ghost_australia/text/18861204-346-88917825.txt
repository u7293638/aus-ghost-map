RELIGIOUS MANIA. Relif*iou3-mania most frequently displays itsblf in the minds of persons whoso in telligence and education are below the average ; but ati exception to what may bo taken as.a general rule is just now to bo met with atCiricinriatij in America. In that town a matter of forty iuhabitantSj described ns " prominent, and above the average in in telligence," are afflicted with a strange form of religious madness. They believe that two ladies, both married; and sisters, are re spectively Christ and the Holy Ghost manifest in the flesh ; and so great is tho influence exercised' b'y these two women that their followers, in order to worship them, have, in . many instances, given up lucrative positions, and abandoned their calling and homes to live nearthem. Thefanatics forming the new sect—which is the talk of the day at Cincinnati—account for the fact that Christ should manifest Himself in a female, by the theory that in Heaven there are no sexes. Many of the;foolish-people who have givon up their positions are already in soro straits how to live. But they decline to work, saying tlioy havo 110 need of money, the Millennium being at hand ; all. they requiro, is spiritual food, which will bo permitted thein'by Divine agency. Religious mania h admitted to be one of tho most * difliculfc forms of brain disease to cure. Nevertheless, we think the rolatives or friends of tho forty ''prominent citizens of Cincinnati" would do well to place them in the hands of-some experienced medical mail for a time, atid see what effect might be produced by following a suitable rejlmc.— Evening Standard.
