THE ANTI- TRANSPORTATION LEAGUE. ON Tuesday evening, in pursuance of notice given, a public meeting of the members of the Australasian League took place in Malcom's Circus, York-street, for the purpose of taking into consideration the lately expressed determination of Earl Grey to continue transporta- tion to Van Diemen's Land. The Circus was filled with a highly intelligent and orderly assemblage of persons, who by the deep interest they evinced in the proceedings of the meeting, displayed their continued e earnestness in the and transport union cause. CHARLES COWPER, Esq , MLC, the President t of the League having taken the chair, proceeded to open the business of the meeting by reading the advertisement con evening the meeting, as follows - AISTIHHSIAN TcACtJF-A public meeting of the, members of the I TILLIE and the colonists of New South Wales is hereby i opened, to be held at May our set in his book street Sydney, on Tuesday, the 6th of j us to a mist li r I Earl Grey a determination to continue transporters u to S in linesmen s Lin 1 as avowed by him to the ii Iona denying, Mr Klug, and to a to) t nual Press to the people of that colony expressive of our continued interest and sympathy Cuinua Cowicn, President of the League ] In addressing a few preliminary observations to them on this most important occasion, he I might, in the first instance, says, that by a happy coincidence of circumstances, that could not have been anticipated, their meeting together at this time had been peculiarly fortunate By the morning's mail from Port Phillip they had received a most important document, being no less than the printed minute of the interview between Mr. King, the Melbourne delegate, and Earl Grey , corrected and authenticated by that noble Lord himself It was therefore, in reference to the Minister of England, a declaration of his sentiments and intentions, under his own hand in order to form a correct basis for the proceedings of the evening, he would now fall upon the Secretary of the League to read the minute (Cheers ) The minute of Mr King (Vide Supplement) was then read by Mr WRIGHT, many portions of Lord Grey's reply being responded to by the meeting with low but deep expressions of amazement and disgust The CHAIRMAN then resumed They would all agree with him that they were ex cuttingly fortunate in having this very in« i resisting and important document before them, concerning as it did so nearly the objects for which they were assembled It seemed, m deed, almost as if it had been sent to them by the speci- d enters action of Providence for this paper had reached Van Diemen's Land by a ship which had made remarkably quick passage, and thence been immediately despatched to Melbourne, and had armed in Sydney only that very morning Many members of the Council of the League had previously some doubt whether it would be right to call the members of the League together in public meeting, until they were furnished with some more minute and authenticated particulars of Lord Grey's intention and conduct than had been furnished in the short and hasty letter of the London Correspondent of the Council. They were now furnished with these particulars and unfortunately they afforded but too much reason for the course the Council had taken One of the principal reason- for calling them together on this occasion was, that in the pressing extremity of the circumstances it had been reserved to hold a Conference of the League at Hobart Town, and he had made preparations to depart for that place in a few days It was to enable him to convey to that almost despairing-that almost heart broken colony-the assurance of the deep sympathy of the people of New South Wales in the despondency which now overshadowed them, that this meeting was called and he was sure they would now, with sincere hearts and ready voices, assert their determination to assist their oppressed brother colonists, and to fight this battle with them (Great cheer- ing 1 He repeated, this battle of Transportation must be fought, and they must join in fighting it (Cheers ) He was not a man who, under ordinary circumstances, liked the word fight, but even in its literal necessity, if they were compelled to fight against this unnatural and intolerable oppression, they would not shrink from their duty (loud and enthusiastic burst of cheering ) But although there was much and imminent (danger before them although they had in arduous, perhaps a fierce struggle to go through, still they had much to encourage them in that struggle, and they could not afford now to sit down and indulge that depression and silent indignation which the) must feel The) must remember that their past efforts had not been without effect Already the Order in Council making New South Wales a penal colony had been revoked Their own peculiar grievances, so far as it directly effected them, was at an end They must remember, too, that one of the main grounds relied on by Earl Grey and his supporters on this question, and one of the strongest arguments used in favour of his policy in Parliament, was, that the colonists were not united on this question, that differences of opinion prevailed amongst them These differences were now fortunately at an end. The circumstances of the colony had changed during the last year, and now those who formerly were the strongest supporters of the trans portation system admitted that the time was come when a change in the policy of the English minister was absolutely necessary (Cheers ) Another favourable circumstance was, that they were now supported in this movement by the English press Until lately the press of England had been much against the colonists on this question They were un- informed on the subject, and their ignorance led them to wrong conclusions Now, however, they had been enlightened on the subject, and the leading news papers and journals of Great Britain were nearly unanimous in protesting against the injustice of making these colonies the cess pools of the crime of the mother country (Great cheering ) They ought also to dem e much encouragement from the fact that a large body of the most influential men of Great Britain, comprising men) peers of the realm, and many distinguished members of Pnrh ment, had associated together for the purpose of promoting the interests and redressing the grey ances of these colonies, and one of their pmicip ii aims was to rid the colonies of this clinging curse of transportation With this respectable and influential body of men, the Council of the League was in constant and I unreserved correspondence, and it was impossible that this unit) of operation could go on long without having a powerful effect on the policy of the English Government They would arouse the English Parliament and the English people to a true sense of this question, and its bearing on Imperial as well as colonial interests They would show that if convicts were to be sent to Van Diemen's Land, for the express purpose of afterwards dispersing themselves through these gold regions not only would grow oppression and injustice be committed on the colonists but theconvuts themselves would be looked upon as a favoured class, and the result would be additional crime and its consequent ex- pense to the people of England (Cheers) Another source of e Agrati lation and en c arrangement was to be found in the upng! t and consistent course adopted by the various local Legislatures Some of the local Legislatures had met for the first time, but they had all, and that of Van Die men's Land especially, done their duty nobly) in this matter The) had declared with one voice they would not have convicts that they would not barter their moral and social w e 11 being for any material advantages which might accrue from the detested system If Lord Grey) then were sincere, in asking the Legislative Assemblies of the colony to express their feelings, he must very son know beyond all doubt that those solemn voices of the various communities have declared against him If in the face 11 these declarations, of these deliberate expressions of the opinion and determination of the colonists, Earl Grey would persevere in I his unjust and iniquitous policy, they must resort to other means to free themselves from a tv rain) so oppressive He would yield to no man in love and loyalty to the Queen But there was a loyalty super or to the loyalty to the sovereign, a loyalty to themselves-to their own duties as Christians, and as men a loyalty) to their wives and their children, and in the true spirit of this lo) alt) they were bound to resist to the death the curse of transportation (Immense cheering) He would not detain them longer, as many gentlemen had to address them in a few days he should sail for Van Diemen's Land, and should be very happy to be the bearer of the sympathies j and condolences to their noble-hearted but suffering brother colonists in that list and (Cheers) Before he sit down, he would inform them that he had, in his capacity of President of the League addressed the following Circular to several gentlemen, soliciting their co- operation in the movement - Sydney 25th Vfanb 1852 Sir The communication was recently received by the friends of the Mail Trains nation clause in the hour for in their Indian corn spo admits is must, inthtlrjulj, ment r n fired it inform) me n them in in li italy to call a 1 in the ruts ting of the colonists to a read what further steps short I he take in order to show their resolute determines n to oppose the influx of ron vii Isam masters I nature to it "is the 1 hope that you will I of intensive at with the views on entertain upon this girl at question to take a 1 in In the proceedings of the public in thing when confer I I Should 3 in the disposal I can assure }outhat}our attending will be bail 1 is an accession unless ripe alteration to those MI I have associated themselves together to a contest for Austr claim ( along s from the jus tliowlni.il is now being inUitUd UK a tin ore 15 Colonial Office misrule I I have Sir Ac To To this letter he had received the following answers - Sydney, 1st April, !Su2.

Vey dear Sir-The numerous engagements I have had to attend to of late, must be my apology for not replying earlier to your letters, dated 27th March and 1st Instant, both of which reached me in due course, with reference to the meeting proposed to be held on Tuesday evening by the Australasian League, to consider i Earl Grey s determination to continue transportation to Van Diemen's Land I regret to say that I shall not be able to take any part in your proceedings in youd the expression of my sincere sympathy for the Tasmanians Thecrutlty and abominable Injustice of our parental Government in continuing to curse Van Die men's Land, by throwing her criminals upon that country, and through Tasmania upon our own shorts and those of V Victoria, is such as to excite feelings of the greatest indignation at such treatment in the minds of all the settled inhabitants of these colonies I am quite prepared for one to join any well organised scheme for getting rid of this convict curse, by every means in our power Trusting 3 you may succeed in getting some effective stakes for Tuesday s meeting and that the result may be all that the true friends of order could wish, I am, my dear Sir, 1 Yours, very truly, K il ROBET Robert Wright, Esq With regard to the letter from Mr. Wentworth, he" must say, from the expressions used by him in his address to his constituents at the last election, he did think he might have been expected to join in this movement The passage he alluded to was as follows:- In the altered condition of things which must be consequent upon the great change which has am now being evinced in the numbers and character of overpopulation I think we are at length, or at least soon shall be for the first time in a position to control the policy of the Colonial Minister, and that if we have not already, «e sh it very shortly, be v0 both moral and physical force sutil cient to convince him that the people of those colonies will no longer allow them to be the receptacles of the criminals of the British empire, to be of the minister should be insane enough to desire to continue his present policy . * ? I think it equally -" to myself and the constituency at large whose suffrages I am soliciting to give them put heavy and to state one quivocall 1 that I shall try /Uluiesupport whether I be in the Legislature or out of it every punishing which I shall open see the revival of transportation 1/1 this colony under whatever modification or which HIIU imtsC upon its immediate abolition in the whole of the colonies form up the Australian group 1 should, indict facing head station in timing In any rcmonstranrewhiih should have for its object to deprecate the formation of a) penal colony in the southern hemisphere It did certainly appear from this that at the time of the election Mr. Wentworth did not contemplate confining his exertions in the anti-transportation cause to the Legislative Council only and he did think he might well have taken part in the proceedings of that night He however had declined to do so, but they would see that though all the gentlemen addressed declined from one cause or other to take part in this meeting, there was a general wish for the success of its objects expressed on the part of all He would now call on Mr. Lamb, one of the members for the city, to move the first resolution Mr. LAMB, M L C , then came forward, and was received with loud cheering The Council of the League had done him the honour to request him to move the first reso- return that evening, and although when the request was communicated to him he was at some distance from Sydney, he felt it his duty to put off all engagements, and to show his sense of the honour they had done him in electing him their representative, by being at his post in the hour of need (Cheers ) And although it was with some regret he heard that his honorable and learned colleague in the representation of the city declined joining them or their proceedings, it was a satisfaction to him, and he was sure it would be to them, to see that the other member for the city was present, ready to redeem the pledge he made to his constituents (Cheers ) Before proceeding with further remarks he would read the resolution which had been entrusted to him - That, so long as V 111 Diemen s s and continues oppressed by transportation all the other colonies of Australasia are bound by sympathy and go as easily, as well as lumps bed by self interest to aid in her deliverance from this clinging curse and this meeting solemnly pledges itself to unite with and assist the Ti main in colonists in their efforts to obtain its entire abolition After the speech of their worthy chairman, the President of the League, it was scarcely necessary for him to say any thing to induce them to unite in sympathy with their fellow colonists in Van Diemen's Land The material, moral, and social interests of the two colonies were so knit together - their happiness, or misery) - their prosperity, or adversity - were so indissolubly) connected that they would indeed be forgetting 'her duty to themselves, their wives and their children, if they deserted their Van Diemen's friends in this their time of need (Cheers ) they had heard the letter of Mr. King read, and certainly, though he was not fond of using ugly names, there was sufficient in that document to warrant them speaking their minds in pretty plain terms, about Lord Grey I There was in that despatch, or minute, ample evidence of the undisguised determination of the monster, to persevere in that iniquitous course of insult and injury to the colonists which he had been pursuing against petition and against remonstrance, as mist pledged words and solemn promises, for so long a period (Cheers) Their honorable chairman had told them, that they wanted this despatch to justify) their meeting together that night But he must say, he did not coincide in that opinion Although no doubt Mr King's minute justified all the suspicions which the most inveterate opponents of Lord Grey could have entertained of him, it only afforded a Reiteration of the same course of injustice and a family which had been pertinaciously followed by that noth man. It was not the first time that the Minister li id insulted and injured the colonists It was not the first time that he had boldly asserted that the free and un- tainted immigrant population of the colonies was no better than the convict element, with which it was his earnest desire and single wish to inundate them, and he called on every immigrant and even son of an immigrant in these Australasian colonies to repudiate this gross at d insulting slander with the scorn it des rved (Loud cheers, and ells for Earl Grey) ) This was the language the Minister had addressed to the Parliament of Great Britain, and it was to such calumnies alone and was to be attributed the apathy of that body in redressing their grievances But the time was now come when these insidious misrule sentations must be exposed. 1 through the unremitting exertions of the League and of their friends in England, the merits of this question were now being made app rent, and the press of Great Britain was for the first time ready to do justice to the 1 lands of the colonists The Legislature of Van Diemen's Land too had done its duty nobly) Itlndboldlvexpiesscd its opinion against the curse of transport tatton In a noble and high-minded spirit they had east from them all the offers of public works of new roads and bridges they had put tempt 1 tion out of the wa) b) solemnly declaring they would have none of them, if such advantages were to be purchased by convict assures me is (Cheers ) This was indeed a noble st mci, and light glad was he that the meeting had been called to express its admiration of the conduct of their friends in Van Diemen's Land, and to assure them of continued sympathy) and assistance from this colony He) had heard it said that in Van Diemen's Land every represent alive of the people who I was sent to the Legislative Council of that colony was pledged to oppose Transportation in every) shape, and happy was he to I add that every representative there had re- deemed his pledge, and done his duty faithfully and well. And he hoped that even here, although there might be lukewarmness on the part of some they would not fail in their duty I that following in the w ake of Van Diemen's Land, the), too, would take a firm and resolute stand on this question. It was said by his hon and learned colleague in the Council last session, in reference to other political grievances under which the colony suffered, that the time for petitioning was fast passing away Now he thought the time for petitioning on the transportation question was fast passing away, and that it was necessary already that the colonists should Speak out in a very different tone They had found prayers and supplications, petitions and remonstrances, unavailing, and they must now assert their right, and their determination to obtain that right Among others, there was one fallacy in the remarks of Earl Grey to Mr King to which he M only briefly advert His Lordship stated, that nearly all the respectable inhabitants of the Moreton Bay district were anxious for the separation of that district from New South Wales, and for its erection into a penal colony Now it singularly and somewhat unfortunately for his Lordship happened, that at the very time when he was his garding this very bo d assertion, that wherever in the district of Moreton Bay a popular constituency existed, they proved the falsity of Earl Grey's declaration of returning as their representatives pledged opponents to transpor- tations (Cheers) This occurred at Brisbane at the Stanley boroughs, and the county of Stanley But of what avail were popular manifestations of this nature to a Minister like Earl Grey , it was sufficient for him that some scion of a respectable house, whose interests were concerned, should get his ear and breathe into it those statements and opinions, which however at variance with the facts, he had accustomed himself so often to repeat, that he almost believed they were true When the Legislative Council of this colony lost met, it was strongly expected and expressed that the discovery of the gold fields must put an end to this vexed question for ever The warmest friends of the transportation system, under the altered circumstances of the colony, turned round upon the policy of the Minister But the Minister, with a dogged obstinacy that could not be moved, found in this very discovery of gold a reason why he should send more ton victs to Van Diemen's Land than heretofore The strange perversity of the Minister seemed to increase in proportion to the number of the obstacles which arose to the exercise of his headstrong and arbitrary well that such a man should have the control of these dependencies of the English Crown was a most unfortunate circumstance The case of these colonies was a acp orable and unhappy one Much as they might wish-and none could wish more earnestly than he did to preserve their connexion with the Crown of Great Britain, a connexion he believed alike advantageous and dignified both to the colonies and the parent country Still, under a policy like this, regardless of the feelings and interests of the people here, the hour of separation, bitter r and angry separation, must sooner or later arrive (Cheers, and cries of " the sooner the better ' ) No, he could not say the sooner the better Let England change her policy Instead of harshness and oppression, let her treat her colonies with kindness and justice, and then it would be better for all parties that Australia should still be allied to her With these observations he begged to move the resolution The Venerable Archdeacon M'ENCROE came forward to second the resolution, and was received with a loud burst of cheering He said, the resolution he had been requested to second was one expressing the sympathy and condolence of the colonies of New South Wales for their friends in Van Diemen's Land, and he was sure they would most cordially adopt the resolution (Cheers ) Because if one member suffers, all the other members suffer with it, and it was the part and duty of the stronger to come to the aid of the weaker (Cheers) It was, however, indeed with a heavy heart that he found they were died upon over and over again to discuss the same question, that all their remonstrance were of no avail, that they had sent petition after petition in vain that they had expressed their will and their determination to Lord Grey day after day and year after year and yet they got no answer from the noble lord but this one " I'll have my own way ' (Groans.) He had always been of opinion that under a constitutional government every grievance and every wrong ought to be set forth and sought to be redressed, through the legal organ of the people, their elected representatives, which had the effect of correcting under popular excitement, and which was the safety valve of public opinion Now they had been working this safety valve for a length of time, but hitherto without success They had repeated the expression of their in- dignation until they were quite sick of repeat ing it, and as the Roman schoolmaster said constant repetition of the same lesson would weary the hardiest scholar It was no use to talk any more, the question was what were they to do 2 Were they to stand still in despair Most assuredly not The evil they complained of no longer affected them directly, but it came by indirect means in increased and increasing force the order in council had been repealed, but the under current from Van Diemens Land was still going on It was as a moralist that he came forward to agitate this question During twenty years of his life he had exerted himself constantly to advance the moral welfare, and ameliorate the social and political position of the unfortunate prisoner, but it was impossible to do the if there was no cessation to the stream of crime, and the time had come when the evil must be put a stop to entirely, if they did not wish all their efforts to be lost, and all their philanthropy to be thrown away It was as a moralist, he said, that he came for ward to take a part in this great question, because it was in fact a moral question, and he was but too well acquainted with it in all its aspects and in all its bearings He knew it as well as Lord Grey himself if not a great deal better But it was not only his own opinion that he stood forth to proclaim it was the opinion of the whole community, and it seldom happened that a whole community was wrong in what concerned their own w welfare Yet, notwithstanding they had all, as with one voice protested again and again against the continuance of Transportation, Lord Grey persisted in thinking otherwise, and in calling them all a set of fools Why, how could he know so will as the colonists themselves what was for their goods He defied him he defied any man, to be wiser in such a question than a whole community, who judged by their own feelings, and saw with their own eyes, and were convinced by their own senses All Lord Grey s philanthropy, and all his philosophy and all his humbug could not alter their views nor shake their determination (Loud cheers ). He came forward therefore, as a peacemaker, he came forward in the hope of averting that convulsion which must take place it this evil were continued (Cheers ) It was impossible for any man to shut his eyes to the reality If this evil be continued, a frightful convulsion would me vitably ensue (Kenevv ed cheering ) But he looked upon the League as a safety-valve whereby the expected explosion might be tried, he believed the League was the best means, not only of insuring their social and political happiness, but of maintaining their connexion with the mother country (Hear, hear ) There was an old saying ' Deliver me from my friends, which he thought was very applicable to the position of our gracious Queen The earnestly wished that gracious lady could be delivered from home of her present advisers, those advisers who were undermining the connexion between these colonies and Her Majesty s Crown (Loud cheering ) Were it not for think, that connexion recent happily subsist for a century to come and the Imperial and Colonial Governments might pull together and work to gether for the good and for the glory of both the mother country and of the colonies. (Cheers.) They were told transport union was an Imperial question, that it was an Imperial necessity Very well So it may be, but could the Imperial Government find no other I spot in all creation to send their felons to but these beautiful colonies No, Lord Grey would have it so see too, so jubeo, stat pro s alone voluntas' Let him find some other place, let him bargain with the Emperor of Russia for some appropriate spot on which to build gaols and reform criminals (Loud cheers and laughter ) No doubt convicts should be reformed No doubt they ought, if possible, to serve their erring brethren , but let them serve themselves first-? charity begins at home » (Cheers ) Again, he repeated, he came forward as a peacemaker in this business, he came forward to prevent, if possible, the dreaded convulsion, and to disarm the dissatisfied and disaffected who wished to kick up a row merely for the sake of a row (Cheers) And he believed that peace and prosperity would result from what they were doing now that it was for the good of commerce, of England's commerce, that Transportation should be put an end to Where in the wide world could England find a finer market for her commerce than these Australian colonies And how could the two things go on together How could they, a free colony, consent to take England s goods with one hand, on condition of taking England's felons with the others Sooner would they take a hint from their friends across the Pacific, (cheers), and cut the painter (tremen- dous cheering ) Where would Lord Grey then find a market for his commerce, or a re- ceptacle for his felons But he heartily wished it otherwise, he yet hoped England and her colonies might go hand in hand, but if they were compelled by mis-government to separate themselves from England, on England would rest the tremendous responsibility (Cheers ) Let them once more implore Her Majesty to dismiss her Ministers from her Council, and so maintain the connexion between these colonies and her Crown If their rulers would seek to direct them instead of driving them, he was convinced that in no part of Her Majesty's wide dominion could be found farmer or more loyal hearts than in Australia. He trusted the Queen would yet see the truth, and say to Lord Grey, " My dear friend, you have been ruining me in the colonies, in God's name go and look after your own affairs " (Loud cheers ) Mr. C KEMP said that as a delegate from these colonies, wishing to impress on her Majesty's Ministers the fearful consequence likely to a case from the system of transport unions to these colonies being persisted in could not use a more powerful argument than to draw his attention to the three speeches which they had just heard (Hear, hear ) Here were three gentlemen of different pursuits, different turn of mind, and different kinds of education, all expressing their anxious fears that unless a change in her, Majesty's councils take place, a serious collision would occur between the parent state and the colony (Cheers ) These gentlemen are well known to the colonists as peaceable citizens , they are not mere factious demagogues, but express the real sentiments which they feel and would not do so unless they Mt themselves imperatively called upon Everyone knew that a more peaceable man than their worthy Chairman did not exist in the colony, the gallant officer who moved the first resolution had in his early life fought for his King and country, and we ii J doubtless do so again if called upon, while the seconder was by profession and education a preacher of peace and yet these three gentlemen all saw the same result shadowed forth (Hear ) Surely Lord Grey could not resist such an argument as this, unless he wished to goad the colonists into insurrection, in order that he might have a pretext for punishing them for the pertinacity with they opposed his views It was not perhaps known to the generality of the meeting, that intelligence had been received from England in the course of the day which led to the conviction that the hope which had been excited that Lord Grey would be removed from office would not be fulfilled for some time at least (Oh hear ) There had long been a feud between Lords Grey and P dmerston, but it was the Foreign and not the Colonial Secretary who had been forced to succumb This would strengthen Lord Grey 8 position in the Ministry, and might perhaps lead to his holding still higher office. It was necessary therefore that the League should redouble its exertions, (hear) , they had not to appeal to a Minister who was anxious to do justice, but to one whose mind had been prejudiced against them, and who from his earliest days had been noted for his dogged perverse disposition The resolution expressed sympathy with Van Diemens Land, an expression of sympathy was easily proposed but would they show that they felt it (Hear, hear.) He hoped that one of the results of the confer- ence to which their Chairman was about to prose would be the despatch of a delegate to England, this would be a source of considerable expense, and they could show their sympathy by subscribing the necessary funds When the Chairman returned from Van Diemen's Land to report the proceedings of the conference, he thought they might call a meeting, and petition the Legislature to pass a resolution that they would not, alter this ye r, vote any moneys (cheers) until the transportation question is satisfactorily settled This would be follow ing the precedent set by Van Diemen's Land, and by giving a year's notice they would show they were not actuated by a desire to impede the Government, but by a dead munition to have the question settled (Hear) The Governor-General General, when the Legislative Council voted against transportation, in 1850, wrote to the Secretary of state that in his opinion it was necessary for the peace and good govern- meat of the colony that transportation should , cease, and the Order in Council be revoked (Hear, hear ) Lord Grey nominally complied with this request, but in reality evaile 1 it by his endeavours to separate Moreton Bay When the probability of this course was allud d to in the legislative Council, that most honest of public officers, the Attorney-General (cheers, repudiated the idea was scorn, as one so unworthy that it was impossible to conceive Lord Grey could be guilty of it, but at the very fine the Attorney-General was making this speech, the noble lord was endeavouring to carry out the scheme which the Attorney General said was imp ssible He believed, however, that throws one of those technical objections which none but lawyers could enter into the spirit of, that the " petition of the inhabitant is being necessary before the colony can be divided lawyers he had heard declared this meant " all the men Infants, ' so that one little boy holding out would prevent the colony from being divided This would render an appeal to Parliament necessary, and then the whole convict question would be opened, and thanks to the League there are many friends of the colony in Parliament who the roughly understand the whole matter (Hear, hear) Van Diemens Land required their sympathy in many w is When the sentiments of the colonists here were unequivocally expressed, Sir Charles Fitz Roy at once advised that the system should be discontinued His Excellency Sir William Denison, however, pursues a dull rent course It was but a few days since that the Legislative Council of Van Diemen's Land was prorogued, he had not seen His Excellency's speech, but he was aware that in alluding to the measures of the session he had expressed his deep sorrow at the address against the transportation which had been agreed to (Oh, oh From all he could asserts in, the colonists of Van Diemen's I and required their sympathy for having over them a (Governor, one who with doubtless the best intents ma, acted as perversely a d obst namely as the noble Secretary of State him self With these observations he b gged to tender his support of the resolution before the meeting (Cheers ) The resolution was then put and carried unanimously M G K HOLDEN commenced by reading the following resolution - That this M stilL, records the warm txpre" ion of its admiration uni r s for the pier the rear entative in members of the Van I) on his Land Legislature in the noble, stand which they have taken on this important and vital [Ucstion Mr G K Holden then said, I have the more pleasure in submitting to you this motion, because I recognise in the recent proceedings of the Tasmanian Legislature, as well as in those of this colony, evidence of the rapid advance of this League in its constitutional and hitherto peaceful struggle And I will even venture to say (d spite of the wicked provocation given by Earl Grey, to a breach of the peace), an earnest of our speedy and bloodless triumph The justice of our cause has been portrayed by means of the League in sunbeams, and by a sudden intervention of I Providence, it has been emblazoned in letters of gold We have carried its light poetry a colonial hustings, and into every hall of colonial legislation We are now conveying it through the British Press to the British people and Parliament, and although the last place it may reach may be the dark purlieus of Downing-street, the mole-eyed Belshazzar who i ties there may at see the ghost of this League writing before him on the wall, '. Many men feel aphasia "-Thy kingdom is departed ! Our present source of congratulation is, that we have obtained full possession of our colonial legislatures The natural current of circumstances had previously carried into them many individual. who, instead of truly representing the feelings of their fellow-colonists on this great question, had interests directly adverse. Some with views altogether official and imperial regarding the welfare of the colonists and their children as a mere drop in the wide ocean of British policy. Others, hankering after the loaves and fishes of the convict system, and expectant of the lion's share of commissariat casion. To continue this state of things was the business of Earl Grey to terminate it ours and for this end some such organization of public opinion as is comprised in our League had become necessary to render the elective portion, at least, of the legislature, a just man roar of the popular mind on this vital question, and to take care that no merits, no talents, no services on any other, should be purchased by one wrong vote on this. This great end has out League accomplished. In New South Wales the effect of the gold discovery was to place at our mercy Earl Grey's own parliamentary guns-either to be thrown overboard or to be used against himself. While we were in the very act of spiking the greatest of these runs, he turned his muzzle round the right way, and was thus spared for our service and out enemy's better discomfiture, and although this old gun may fire a sly kick at his new allies, reminiscent of an old grudge, no matter , we can afford to give him a wide berth - we can let him off with a long match, and all we hope is, the more he kicks, the better may he carry ! It appears, however, that Earl Grey will only keep faith with the Council of New South Wales, on the condition of their breaking faith with their constituents' No sooner do they show themselves too honest as a body to remove his tools, than he opens a new treaty with individual traders We may send the twelve apostles, if we please, to represented in Council Let him only find one Judas member representing one Iscanot province, and he hastened to offer the bribe of a separate Government for the express purpose of converting the whole continent through it into a convict Aceldama But there is one of nature in this case which gives it an air of ridicule, almost equal to that of its wickedness. Eager as Earl Grey has shown himself to act the role of the Chief Priest, it is quite possible he may present himself to be hooted on the stage alone, and may jingle his thirty pieces of silver without finding any Judas to receive 1 is bribe. At the very time when he is plotting in London to break through statute law and public faith, in order to satisfy the supposed cray ings of the ghouls of Moreton Bay for convicts rejected by New South Wales, Brisbane elects two opponents of transportation as its representatives, thus proving that the principles of the League are paramount even in Moreton Bay, and that Earl Grey's policy cannot find support from any colonial constituency where the Christians are beginning to out-number the kangaroos. I need hardly say that in Victoria, in South Australia, and in New Zealand, the legislatures have all proved faithful to the object of our League Nothing less could have been expected, even by Earl Grey) himself With Tasmania the case was otherwise There is little doubt that up to the last moment, Earl Grey was imbued by his Tasmanian private advices, with the hope of a re-action against the League among Tasmanian farmers, in consequence of the drain of labour to the Australian gold mines and of securing thus a subservient majority in the new legislature This, no doubt, greatly influenced Earl Grey's confident bearing towards the Victoria delegate in December last For although Mr. King warns Eau Grey of the expected election of members of Council in Van Diemen's Land opposed to transportation, he could not then have known it as a fact, and Earl Grey passes the subject by with this cool remark, " If the gold discoveries in New South Wales proved as extensive as we were led to expect, the people of Van Diemen's Land would soon discover the ad- vantage which they possessed over the other Australian colonies, in having through their convict establishments the abundant supply of cheap labour " It yet remains to be seen what will be the effect, first, on Earl Grey himself, and, secondly, on the British nation and Parliament, of the very different views of the question expressed by the Van Diemen's Land Council, in the proceedings for which we now tender them our thanks Let us see what these are. On the 17th January, Mr. Sharland moved resolutions which were as follow - S That it has been this demonstrated that the con- time met of the convict system a this colony is a breach of faith on the part of the English government and that it is so o v lously prejudicial to thornley, that has been condemned by a legislature which was composed exclusively of Crown officers and nominees, with the Meuse I sanction more as its president I I) That the Inhabitants of the Australian colonies have bitndistiiigulshel for their loyalty and after lament to our illustrious Sovereign, and to the Constitution of the British Empire but if they are to be denied any ' ji trtl Opinion in the benefits of that Constitution if they are to be dealt with as though they possissiduoneof the rights of British subjects and if they are to be taught that the promise of the Queen is to them only a snare and a delusion, it becomes impossible to look forward to the probable tension nets, as respects the supremacy of england in these territories without anxiety and alarm 10 That claiming as undo the fulfilment of the promis- of our Sovereign that transportation to this colony shall be cool shed wo decline at present to enter upon any discussion of the innumerable evils, social moral, but men it and political which have arisen from the conduct of the English, Government in reference to the great (race ance for the redress of which the faith of the English I rown stands pledged to this colony 11 That the roi ut discovery of the gold for Ids of Aus truth I may incline her Majesty s ministers to discontinue the British nation of criminals to any of the six provinces; but that if it should unhappily be otherwise it is out duty as colonists and as British subjects to exist to the utmost all the power with which this Council is invested, doorpost and, if possible, to di fiat every measure which may be no rested or attempted for the introduction of crime is into this country in any time, or under any circumstances 1 That these resolutions be transmitted to his Excellency the 1 indignant Governor for the purpose of being forwarded to the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies to be laid before Her Majesty the queen And on the 3rd of March last Mr. Gregson moved That this of Council has shown a very disposition to avoid embarrassment to the local government and is willing even to augment the pay of the police for the present learning the circumstances connected with the discovery of gold in Australia, but that, after the present session if transportation shall be continued to this colony, this iouutilwill not vote more than one-third tenth part of the cape of the police and gaols, nor more for any other expenditure connected with the control or may resident of criminals than this country would be subjected to If it were a free colony When these resolutions reach England, and with them the corresponding protests of all the Australians colonies, and when they shall be submitted to the British legislature, then, and not till then, may we consider the question between these colonies and the home government as fairly at issue. Until our appeal to the British nation and Parliament has absolutely failed, I for one will refuse to 'transfer the indigo men which the loathsome tyranny of Earl Grey has excited in my bosom, to the yet venerated name of England Mr Is OK 1 ON rose to second the resolution which had just been moved He said, whatever battle they might have to fight, whatever forces the ) might have to call up, there was one means which, if the) employed, there was no reason to fear that they would not accomplish every object that Englishmen could desire It was impossible to listen to what they had heard read and stated that night, without feeling convinced that Earl Grey, with all his desire to trample on them, with all his determination to disregard their petitions, and to persist in his own views, trembled before the Legislative Council In deference to the decision of the Legislature, he had conceded the repeal of the order in Council, and then he had recourse to a cowardly, underhand way, of carrying out his determination. The Legislative Council was the people. (Cheers ) In rising to be one! this resolution, he was anxious to impress upon them all the duty which their country called upon them to perform. In sending to the Legislative Council gentlemen who I would faiths illy represent their desires and their wants, they had done well, but it was impossible to conceal the fact that they must keep a watch over that Council still It was not by two votes only, or by one spee' that their representatives could entitle themselves to the people's support for many of them were lukewarm, and only too ready to join with the Government Nominees in swamping any measure which was for the public good. (Cheers.) It was impossible to witness the conduct of some of their representatives in that Council without feeling that they had no business there, (Cheers.) They must keep a watch over them. The people were entitled to tell the Government of England what were their rights, and what they would insist upon and when they saw such conduct on the part of their representatives, it was their duty to express the indignant feelings which such conduct called forth, and to call upon those representatives at once to vacate the seats which they were clearly unworthy to hold. (Cheers,) Among them, however, were men who would not hear the voice of the people, but continued to hold their seats in spite of their constituents. Nevertheless let them fearlessly express their opinion and say what they felt. It had been well said by one of the previous speakers, (Mr. Kemp,) that it was the first duty of the Legislature to look after the public expenditure ; but there were many who called themselves the friends of the people who yet never thought of controlling the government in that matter, and stopping the supplies. It was not only the annual estimates that called for revision ; there was the Land Fund, and there were the Schedules, which required to be controlled and which ought to be, and could be controlled. He had no hesitation in declaring that if their representatives were unanimous, they could compel the Colonial Government to express their real wishes. Earl Grey trembled before the unanimous vote of the house; but he would tremble a great deal more if he _ saw every member echo the same sentiments and demand the same rights. It was therefore their interest as well as their duty to keep a close watch over their representatives. He was grieved to have witnessed the return of some who were not at all entitled to the confidence of the people, and who would be far more happy and more consistent if they sat on the Government seats. One glorious example indeed they had before them of a man who had once occupied a seat at the nomination of the Government, but who by his independent and manly conduct had deserved and received the approbation of the people, The alluded to his honorable and gallant friend, the member for the city (Mr. Lamb). (Loud cheers.) If they had been always represented by men of sterling worth like his, long ago they would have carried all that they wanted, long ago they would have risen into a nation, respected by England, and esteemed by all the world. (Loud cheers.) They had before them an example which would show fully what were the feelings of the Colonial Office. He alluded to the Canadian colonies, where the questions at issue were not of such vital importance as that which they had met here to discuss. Yet they knew the result of the struggle of Canada to Canada everything had been conceded, which was a proof that in spite of all the evasions and all the sinuous policy of Colonial Ministers, they feared and trembled before representative institutions. (Cheers.) Under representative institutions the voice of the people would be respected, and must be heard. It was for this reason that he called upon them to act consistently in the choice of their representatives. The com- let question. was not the only important one they had to | consider. There was the question of the land i fund. At present, owing to the revenue derived from the gold licenses, the Government were enabled to multiply offices to a frightful ' extent, and fill them with men who were ut- i terly unqualified to discharge the duties entrusted to them, but who served to strengthen, the hands of the Government and to increase , the number of their dependants and slaves. | If the control of the land fund, and of the territorial revenues were surrendered to those to whom they rightfully belonged, the Government would be anxious to listen to the voice of their representatives, instead of showing them constant and determined hostility. In Van Diemen's Land they had two noble examples before their eyes. There, the representatives of the people were placed in a position of far greater difficulty than were the representatives of New South Wales, yet they had nobly, and firmly, and consistently, maintained the rights which were committed to their hands. He hoped and sincerely trusted the example of Van Diemen's Land would be followed here and if it were, they could not fail to obtain, in a very short space of time, all that they sought. Their voice would be felt so strongly in the great council of the nation, that it would become impossible for any Minister longer to to withhold their just rights and liberties. (Cheers.) Mr. W. R. PIDDINGTON : Was never so much in love with the office of a specialist in his life before as on this occasion, as the two preceding speakers had really left him nothing I to do in supporting the resolution they proposed to the meeting. The whole of the reso- ! lutions that evening were treble shouted, but the eloquence of the movers and seconders left the unhappy wight who came third very little to say. But it required no conjurer to see that this meeting viewed with disgust and irritation the obstinate perseverance in oppres- sion and insult to these co enies displayed by that autocrat of the Colonial Office, Lord Grey. And it was only natural that this disgust and irritation should not only be felt, but be expressed. How had Lord Grey treaty of the petitions and remonstrances of the colonists ? How had he treated the solemn and deliberate resolutions of their Legislative Council, on matters concerning which he had expressly asked for their opinion ? Every manifestation of the opinion of the colonists on this transportation question had been disregarded, and the conduct of the Minister in reference to it had been one long continuance of evasion and want of faith. (Cheers.) It appeared almost incomprehensible that any man, any Minister, could have been suffered for so long to go on in the career which Lord Grey had pursued. It was wonderful not only that these colonies had so long submitted to his tyrannical thraldom, but that the Parliament and people of England should have silently witnessed the pledged word of the Minister of the Crown brought into contempt and disrepute. But what, he asked, were the words of this Minister ? That convicts should not in any case be forced on colonies against the will of the people of those colonies. These were the words of the Premier of England, of Lord John Russell, in his famous speech on colonization, in which he indicated the policy which his government were prepared to adopt in reference to the colonies. These were the very words of that speech as reported in Hansard. How had the pledge been kept ; ? or rather, let them answer, how had the pledge been falsified. The neighbouring colony of Van Diemen's Land had been deluged with criminals, although by petitions from the people of every class and grade by remonstrances even from the nominee legislature of that colony, they had over and over again protested against the reception of prisoners at all. And let them consider, too, the character and description of the prisoners they sent, and what they might expect from them. Under the modified criminal code of the mother-country, comparatively very few offences were now punished by transportation ; it was only offences which would formerly have been visited by capital punishment that were now visited with transportation. The criminal law of England was now, perhaps, the most merciful of any country in the world, and it was only the most heinous offenders, men convicted of the most atrocious crimes, who now were sent out to the penal settlements. The convicts which were formerly sent out were of an entirely different character, many of them were transported for trifling delinquencies, which would now be punished by a few week's imprisonment, or for political offences, involving no moral turpitude and which would not now be punished at all. He was not speaking at random on this subject, the criminal statistics of the mother country proved his statements. He found that out of 20,000 commitments which took place in England in the year, only 2500 prisoners were transported ; only 10 per cent., or a little more, of the whole crime of the mother-country was judged to be punishable by transportation. Let them pause and consider this fact. They knew the terrible crimes which were of every- day occurrence in England and Ireland, but of all the crime, it was only that of the very worst, of the very deepest dye, that was to be sent to these colonies. And let them also regard the statement another way. The Colonial Minister, and indeed every supporter of the convict system, used as their strongest argument the benefit which a supply of convict labour would confer. Now let them consider that all they had to offer in the way of supplying labour to these colonies, was 2500 convicts a-year and would not this, he asked, be but as a drop in the ocean in proportion to their wants. This was the general argument used by their opponents, and yet this argument was like a pair of great folding gates, with a wicket in them. The wicket was to be left open to admit this paltry narrow stream of convict labour, while the gates were to be closed against that full tide of free un- tainted immigration, whom the rewards of honest industry would attend here. (Cheers.) It was a grateful task to reflect on the conduct of the Van Diemen's Land people and Legislature on this question. They had not been contented with denouncing the theory of transportation, but they had asserted their determination at what must be to them a great sacrifice, to resist it in practice and that next year, if the system were not discontinued, they would only vote one-thirteenth part of the sum now required for police expenses, and only such other expenses as ought fairly to be required for the Government of an entirely free colony. It was certainly a very degrading reflection to think that the only thought of the Minister of England should be, in connection with these colonies, to give encourage- ment to convicts and police. Prisoners were sent here who had passed through all the various stages of crime-who had been trained in all the colleges of crime in the mother country, and then, like the notorious gang of Frimley burglars, were banished front Great Britain, to renew among the unoffending convicts their depredations and their outrages. He could but express his hearty and sincere wish that the other Colonial Legislatures would follow the same course which had been pursued by that of Van Diemen's Land. They had a noble example set them. The representatives of the sister colony had kept faith with their constituents honestly and con- , sistently and led on by their straightforward, ! upright native Speaker, had maintained their anti-convict principles against power ; and influence, with unshaken firmness. . With such an example before them he looked forward with confident certainty to the result of this struggle. If constitutional means would not give them justice, they must demand it in another way ; but he felt that constitutional means would prevail must prevail, if used with the same spirit and determination as had been displayed by the inflexible patriots in the Tasmanian Council. The resolution was then put and passed unanimously. Mr. R. CAMPBELL, M.L.C., then came forward to move the next resolution, and was received with repeated cheers. He thanked them for the kind reception they had given to him, it added to the deep feelings and emotions of his heart in undertaking the duty which had been cast upon him. After the many elegant speeches they had heard that evening he did not feel called upon to detain them long, but it was his simple duty to bring before them a resolution which ought to claim their deep and earnest thought. They had in the previous resolution expressed their sympathy with the colonists of Van Diemen's Land, and their admiration of the noble stand they had made against the oppression of Earl Grey. Now he asked them to affirm a further resolution, assuring the colonists of Van Diemen's Land! their assistance and support. The resolution was- I That the determination avowed by Earl Grey to the Victoria Delegate, Mr. King, on the 25th November last, to persist in transportation to Van Diemen's Land, and to separate Moreton Bay from New South Wales, for penal purposes, in breach of his repeated promises, demands the indignant reprobation of this meeting, and they bind themselves by all they hold dear and sacred, to resist to the uttermost an oppression so desolating, here- by solemnly protesting, that the responsibility for all consequences will remain with their oppressor. ¡ It was said that brevity was the soul of wit, and ! he heartily wished that he could describe in one '. brief s ntence his feeling on this question. | But he did not profess to have the gift of elo- quence", but it might be his labours and his constancy to this good cause might speak at least for his earnestness and sincerity in it. (Cheers.) It was now time to show sympathy to their friends in Tasmania by actions rather than by words. Action now would tell more strongly than the brilliant speeches. (Cheers.) I He asked them now to pass this resolution, ! | but he would rather that they should not pass it if, by doing so, they did not mean something more than mere words. He trusted they were prepared, if called on, to enter into this contest, caused by the unworthy sub- deluges of the unworthy servant of their beloved Sovereign, to do their duty as" men and Britons, proud of the birthright and heritage of freedom which had been bequeathed to them by their forefathers. If all these petitions, these memorials, these remonstrances, were to be disregarded if the doors of justice and of national affection were to be closed against them, they must do what their own people had done before them, assert their rights, and maintain them against every hard- ship, every cruelty, even against death itself. If all the prayers of the colonists were to be ! disregarded if every interest of these colonists was to be crushed by the tyrannical will of a Minister, let the people show to that Minister that they will not submit to such injustice and indignity. Let the colonists of Van Diemen's Land seize the very next floating past house that arrived in their harbour, and turn its inmates back into the waters. (Cheers.) Ever since the year 1848, meetings had been held in all the colonies, at which resolutions were passed, and petitions and memorials adopted, till declaring that the colonists would not submit to this pollution. Bodies of men not ordinarily acted upon by political affairs, had assumed the same position, and he found that in one of the petitions from the clergy, it was stated, that in addition to the moral evils aris- ing from the system itself, its perpetuation here would lead to endless discord and for himself, he had no hesitation in saying that it is discord would end in rebellion. (Cheers.) If then they passed this resolution, let them pass it in sincerity and good faith, meaning what they said and tried the Tasmanians might receive their delegate with the joy and enthusiasm which his presence amongst them ought to inspire. ("Cheers.) No man could surpass him in the love and veneration he bore to the British constitution, or could be more proud than he was of being a British subject. But notwithstanding these feelings he could not repress his disgust at the manner in which Earl Grey treated this question. When the question of the abolition of negro slavery in the West Indies was agitated, what was the course proposed by Lord Stanley, who then filled the office of Colonial Minister ; it was complained that to do this would injure the West Indian colonists and when asked to what extent, and told, perhaps, ten millions of money, he told them to take £20,000,000 and let this act of justice be done. Now here was a community panting to maintain a pure and unspotted character to hand down to posterity, but were to have this character this fair reputation withheld from them because it saved expense to the English Government. The English Minister pandered to his own wants his own necessities, and in doing so hesitated not to blast the character of many different communities. (Cheers ) The conduct of Lord Stanley was worthy of a high minded, a British, a Christian statesman while that of Earl Grey was stained by all the lowest and most grovelling selfishness that degrades humanity. With these observations, he begged most heartily and in full sincerity to move the resolution. Mr. FLOOD, M.L.C., seconded the resolution. He felt highly honoured in having been called upon by the President and Council of the League to second this resolution, which had been so ably proposed by the honorable gentleman, the member for the City. But at this late hour, it was not his intention in to inflict upon them a long speech. He would confine himself to a pledge that he would on all of casions, and by all means in his power, support the principles of the League. (Cheers.) Some- thing more would spring out of this, the greatest political institution that had ever existed in New South Wales, and he thought I that the thanks of generations yet unborn would be given to the public spirited managers of the League, for their patriotic conduct in this great and vital struggle (Cheers.) He would only allude to one class of the population in this colony, in reference to which he had a few short observations to make He meant the emancipists of this colony and the children Far be it from him to say one word in disparagement of that class of colonists , he only wished he could see more of them members of the League, for the League were in truth fighting their battles Only a few days ago, in the Supreme Court, in the case of Devine v Wilson, a gentleman who had, for thirty years past, held an honorable post in the colony, and discharged the duties of his office faithfully and with credit to himself during those thirty years, was asked if he remembered for what he had been brought to this colony Now, were they to be founded in this way till they got to their graves (Loud cheers ) Were they to be per petually reminded of those errors for which they had already paid the forfeit to their country ? (Cheers) Had they not suffered enough, and had they not, since their emancipation, redeemed their characters, and regained the place in the society of their fellow-men, which they had lost And were they to be eternally subject to be taunted with things which had long passed away (Cheers ) Where was the emancipist who would not sympathise with the cause of the League, and join heart and soul in preventing the renewal and perpetuation of such a state of things a (Cheers) He tendered his cordial though humble approbation of the conduct of the representatives of the people in the sister colony, and with reference to what had fallen from Mr Norton as to the conduct of some of the members of our own legislature, he trusted his country would always be satisfied with the votes he should give during his career in Council (Cheers) He trusted they should never have occasion to say he was unworthy to hold the seat to which the people had prefered him But, with Mr Kemp, he trusted that the sympathies of his fellow colonists would not be limited to words, but that they would assist with their mite the efforts of their brethren in Van Diemen's Land to rid themselves for ever of the changing course of transportation (Loud cheers ) Mr. GILBERT WRIGHT supported this Resolution they had been repulsed at the first onset-out baffled not beaten-they must re- new the attack ? It was often charging that won the battle ' (Cheers ) The assault must be lengthened into a siege (Hear, hear ) Their rejected petitions must be reiterated and reinforce d by continual fresh supplies of more urgent and importunate demands ' (Hear, hear ) And it would be with them, as with the Greeks before Troy, it was not Agamemnon nor Ajax, nor Achilles- but V ten years siege, that won the citadels (Cheers ) They had nothing to h per from the equity or honesty of Earl Grey (Groans.)

(Cheers.) Why, they had deliberated over years-they had exhausted all argument. The matter now resolved itself into a simple question of natural right and they had only to consider how best to vindicate this right. (Cheers.) No man nor body of men could have a right to force upon a community a thing which they unanimously refused to receive which they abhorred and believed would be ruinous to them. Argument and discussion had been of no service to them; their remonstrances and petitions had fallen upon deaf ears. They had done all in this way which men could do they could pursue this course no longer. (Cheers.) It was a singular and striking feature of this agitation, that a very large amount of talent had been exhibited in it. The last debate in the Legislative Council, the year before last, was one so ably sustained that it would have done honour to the British House of Commons. Their petitions, from all parts of the country, had been able and argumentative documents and such was their unanimity of sentiment, that, when the question was last under discussion, in this colony, the numbers were 36,000 against, and only 500 in favour of the system. (Cheers.) But in the face of all this not- withstanding their repeated protests and peti- tions-notwithstanding the intelligence which they had brought to bear in the discussion of this question, and their unanimity in the decision which they had arrived at the tyrannical Minister persisted in thrusting upon them the evil which they were determined not to receive. Well, then, what was to be done ! As a free people, as men, they could not retreat from their position ; they could no longer go through the farce of remonstrating against an injustice which was persevered in with an utter disregard to their wishes and their interests ; they must do something else. (Loud cheers.) He was plcatv..-_ to hear their President, Mr. Cowper, talk of fighting. (Cheers and laughter.) Know- ing the mild, affable, and benignant character of that gentleman, he was at first half afraid that he was hardly stern enough for the duties which he might be called upon to perform in his mission to Van Diemen's Land. They had been told that night of the serious consequences which might ensue ; he (Mr. Parkes) had no desire to bring before them rebellious examples, or he might most properly point to the example of the American colonists for in the progress of events which led to the loss of those colonies, there was a remarkable analogy to their own case. He would pass over this, because he believed that meeting did not need to be reminded of the glorious and successful struggle of men who were treated with contumely and oppressed in a similar manner to themselves. (Cheers.) There was, however, one noble passage in a speech of one of these early patriots which he would, with their permission, repeat to the meeting. When young Patrick Henry, in the General Assembly of Virginia, was moving his resolutions in reference to the odious Stamp Act, he exclaimed, " Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the Third" " Treason !" cried the Speaker (who probably was much such a gentleman as the honorable Speaker of our own Council), the young patriot, standing up more proudly than ever, and fixing his eyes on the alarmed Speaker, concluded the sentence : " George the Third may profit by their example ! ? (Cheers.) If that be treason, make the most of it!" He would point to the successful resistance of the American colonists, and in the name of that meeting tell the British Government to I profit by their example ! He had no treason to promulgate on the contrary, the man did not breathe, whose heart beat with a truer loyalty to the gracious and glorious lady who presided over the destinies of the British empire, (Cheers,) but as was said by their Chairman, there was a higher loyalty than that to any earthly monarch - our loyalty to our own nature and to the all-wise God who had planted in us pure and holy sentiments, and warmed our being with the love of justice and truth. (Cheers.) To be false to this loyalty, would be to abuse ourselves before our Creator to deface the divine impress of humanity which had been printed on our hearts. (Cheers.) They must go right onward in their course. There could be no mistake in the matter ; or if Earl Grey had indeed been deceived and misled, the last elections throughout the colonies would surely undeceive him. Even under a constitution, concocted by his own go vermont, the people of Van Diemen's Land, had in every instance, elected unti-transpdrta tionists to their representative seats. to that unfortunate island-that very sinkhole of the English iniquity where the prison population was so alarming in numbers, and where it could not be doubted many of that class possessed the elective franchise, no representative favourable to the continuance of transportation had been chosen. It was fair to assume that many of the emancipist class in that island had recorded their votes on the side of the anti- transportationists. How could it be otherwise ? How could men wish to continue to their children the curse of their own lives ? What was it-this desire to get rid of the in fury and degradation of which they had been themselves victims-but the triumph of all that was good and virtuous and lofty and aspiring in the human breast ? (Cheers.) They were about to send Mr. Cowper as a delegate to the Conference of the League at Hobart Town. When he approached the shores of the island home of those sturdy and stout-hearted patriots, he (Mr. Parkes) hoped the bracing influences of their climate would make that gentleman even bolder than he had been in his speech that evening and if the Tasmanian colonists should determine to resist the landing of any more convicts, that he would solemnly assure them, the inhabitants of New South Wales were ready to assemble again in some place under heaven, where all the people could be gathered, to ratify all the acts so done and to share in all the consequences, (Loud cheers.) The example of the Cape colonists was before them. The time was come when their only course was to follow that example and whenever a prison-ship should arrive in the Derwent, or in any other port, to resist at all hazards the landing of the men thus tyran- nically forced upon us. He most sincerely hoped they would not be driven to the catastrophe hinted at by their respected member, Mr. Campbell that of tumbling the prisoners into the sea ; but whatever suffering might ensue -at whatever sacrifices, they were now bound to stand by each other in the protection of their own liberties. There were times when men had no right to look round for consequences ; when they were bound by all that was dear and sacred to advance. He believed this was a time for such conduct. (Cheers.) When he was asked by his colleagues in the Council of the League, to take part in the business of that meeting;, he consented, because he considered he had no right to refuse any duty in the cause ; had they asked him to fight, his consent would have been as freely and as quietly given for the reasons he had stated. (Cheers.) But he had come to the meeting determined to put it to them whether the time had not arrived for the Van Diemen's Land colonists to resist the landing of the convicts. (Loud cheers.) He could see no other way to get rid of this cruel an i desolating agitation, He therefore solemnly asked that meeting if they agreed with him that the time for this decisive action had arrived, with him to hold up their hands in the affirmative. (Here the speaker held up his hand, and was responded to by the hands of nearly all in the body of the meeting.) This he accepted as a pledge of their honest and serious determination in the matter. In the name of that meeting he would request their respected delegate to con- j vey to the colonists of Van Diemen's Land that the people of New South Wales were prepared to stand by them in resisting the de- barkation of any further importations of con- j victs on their shores. He would now most cordially move the resolution which had been entrusted to his hands : That the previous resolutions be embodied In an Address, and that such Address be presented by the President, in the name of this Meeting, to the Tasmanian Delegates at the Hobart Town Conference. Mr. G. A. LLOYD The time was pressing on, and the meeting must be brought to a close. In seconding the resolution that had just been put, he should therefore be very 1 brief. He rejoiced to see himself surrounded I by so large a portion of the wealth, the intelligence, and the talent of the colony and a indeed, the cause which brought them together was one which must find its way to every heart, and on which all honest minds must be unanimous. (Cheers.) It might be that one or two might be found here and there who did not agree with us; but, at any rate, they proved that they were ashamed to meet us. (Great cheering.) The resolutions which had been passed had all been drawn up with great care; but the one which he was now seconding was the most sacred and most solemn of them all. By this resolution they bound themselves by all that they held dear to resist to the i uttermost the desolating curse of transports 1 tion. They bound themselves by the love they bore to their country, to the love they bore to their wives, and to their children, and to their sisters, to resist, by every means in their power, and to put a final end to the desolating curse of transportation. (Loud cheers ) He was only surprised that Lord Grey could have held out so long against the earnest entreaties and repeated remonstrances of the whole colony. He only wished he could be here this evening to witness their earnestness on the subject. Some excellent and powerful spe dies had been delivered, but he would wish particularly to call the attention of Earl Grey to the speech of their old and staunch friend, the Venerable Archdeacon M'Encroe. There was a force and reasoning in his simple but earnest expressions which ought to find their way even to the heart of Earl Grey and if, when Earl Grey read that speech, which, thanks to the exertions of the public press, he would soon do-if when Earl Grey read that speech he could yet dare to brave the consequences of his own acts, all he could say, he was more obstinate and more impracticable than he had ever believed it possible he could be. But it was not so much for ourselves that we were fighting as for our sister Van Diemen's Land Lord Grey had declared his purpose to continue the desolation under which she was suffering and she cried out tous, come over and help me And should they refuse to respond to her calls He was sure that every heart and every voice would utter-no They would go over and help her, and in helping her, they would be eradicating the seeds of disease with which they were themselves threatened. Their cause was exciting the sympathies of a large number of the British people. the people of England were beginning to see that these colonies were no longer to be trifled with They had suddenly risen into an importance which was never dreamt of before, and although in a few short years all those who were assembled here to-night should have passed away from the world and he in their graves, yet their children would live to see this country a wonderful and mighty ensure, the glory and marvel of the earth. (Immense cheering) They were not without the syiu p ethics of friends in England. He held in his hand a letter from a wealthy merchant in Hobart Town, announcing that one of the friends of the cause in England had placed the sum of £100 in his hands as a contribution to the League Fund. (Cheers.) The name of that friend of our cause was Robert Brooks He was one of the most eminent merchants of London, a man of wealth and extended influence, and there could be no doubt that in securing his sympathy and support they had secured those of hundreds and hundreds of others (Loud cheers). Their President was now about to visit the sister colony, and it was the object of the Council of the League in calling them together to-night, to enable him to carry to Hobart Town such an expression of the opinion of this colony as could not be misunderstood 1 (Cheers) He wished some of the colonists of Van Diemen's Land were present to witness the earnestness and unanimity which characterised this meeting and he only hoped the President would be enabled to carry away with him some portion of the warmth and ardour of their feelings. At all events, he would be enabled to assure Van Diemen's Land that so long as a single line of her chain remained unbroken, no energies and no sympathies on the part of New South Wales shall be wanting to destroy it (L and cheers ) Mr. COWPER, in declaring the resolution to be carried, would say that his arrangements were made to go down to Hobart Town, and he rejoiced that he should now be enabled to tell their noble-hearted friends there, that, in all sincerity and all truth the hearts of the people of New South Wales were with them, in determining to remove what was properly called in the resolutions this " clinging curse of the Australasian colonies. Mr. JOSEPH SIMMONS having moved that Mr. Cowper do leave the chair, and that it be taken by Mr. Lamb, proposed, in a highly complimentary speech, that the meeting should acknowledge I.I three cheers as warmly given as if they could be heard in Tasmania-the serv fes of their respected friend Mr. Cowper in the chair that evening, and for his untiring efforts in the cause. The cheers were given with much enthusiasm, and Mr Cowper having expressed his gr attitude the meeting dispersed.
