To the Editor of the Perth Gazette. SIR, — I observe a second article in the Inquirer from Mr. Henry Landor, with an additional L.A.C. tacked to his name; and the Editor kindly added, for the informa- tion of the curious, that L.A.C. means "Li- centiate of the Apothecaries Company.'" In the next epistle we may have another; addition to M.R.C.S., F.M.S.A., & L.A.C. — like Banquo's ghost — what another? As this gentleman is so fond of exhibiting his titles and his learning before the public, perhaps it may not be deemed amiss to contradict him in one fact, in the midst of his intellectual career — which is this : No native of Western Australia has ever been observed to eat the bark of trees, or known to do so; at the present time, their food consists principally of frogs, which abound plenteously in all swampy places, on lizards and other reptiles, and the wallabee and opossum tribes. A man, with all the learn- ing even of the "admirable Crichton," ought to be cautious in putting forth state- ments to the world which can be contra- dicted by the test of experience;and Mr. Landor may be assured, that when his fire is expended there will be a return volley.
