DEAN SWIFT AND THE SATELLITES OF MARS. To fke Editor of the Ham&ton; Spectator. "ie reaims yet onreveaiea to namsn eigne. Ye gods who rale the regions of tbe night, Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate The mvstlo wonders of tout allent atate. — PafDEtf. SiBr-The recent grand dtscoveiyonly sur passed by that of Neptune by tbe late sL Leverrier —of two stfleliites of Mars by tbe distinguished American astronomer. Ball, is known to every one taking an interest'in the rapid progress of modem acfeuecYbos Tew of your readers may be'nware of the foot or remember the circumstance that, more than 160 years ago. Jonathan £wlft <1667—1746) wrote of these Identical aatellites in very plain and nnmlstakeable languge. In that fanny world of his own crestton— and who will deny that Swift was a creator? -known as "Gulliver's Travels" to CTery schoolboy, but really Appreciated and understood only by a few profound students of philosophies! history, tbe satirical Dean of St. Patrick, in speaklngof the astronomers of Lapota (cb. UL), says "They have likewise discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Hare ; whereof the Innermost Is distant from the centre of the primary planet exactly three of his diameters, and die outermost, five; the former revolves in tbe space of ten honre. and the latter In twenty-one and a half, so that the squares of their periodical times are very nearly In' the same proportion -with the cubes of their distance from the centre of Hare, which evidently shows them to be governed by tbe name law of gravitation that influences the other heavenly bodies." Nowl&elc;, my kind and gentle reader, what is tbe meaning ot this strangely trne and accurately- worded passage? Is it a bap-hazard guess— one of the dean's quips, or is It a scientific predic tion, based on calculation, or a phrophecy, or a clairvoyant vlfilon, or « a what?" Waiting for an answer to these vexed questions, A icoiBiii, yuute uuiy, C. W. ROHNER. Hamilton 4th January.
