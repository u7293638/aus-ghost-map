' Why,' said the Captain in reply, as Will handed liiiii the article mentioned, 'this'is a stopper out of my medicine chest. 1 "To be sure it is, Ja;ck,' returned Will; aiid I must apologise for the liberty of takingyoui \- laudanum phial; but my confounded back-tooth was so painful oil board the ship last night, that I got up and took it, and lubkily forgot to return it this morning." You must' debit me with the bottle and its contents, for'I dropped them both into the vagabonds' wine-jar 1' * What P we all exclaimed in a lireoth. 'Now, stop your clappers !' continued' the 'supercargo.—" Jack, you know I'm not bad at sleight-of-hand tricks.

' Bravo, Will!' cried the Captain, seizing his hand and giving it a hearty shake, ' If •that's the case, we're safe ; for the blackfaced irascals won't wake up for a dozen hours Til be bound. Therel our guard has dropped off already 1' And sure enough, the drowsy ruffian" had •plantedhimself right across the opening and was snoring loudly, 'Now for it!' cried the impetuous Jack Jenkins, rising. • . ' Hold hard !:'.' said Will. /'' Let thern get well off.' So, setting ourselves down for half.an hour, we talked the matter over. At the end of this time, we sent the trembling Themistocles .'to see. how things were outside; and after peeping over the prostrate sentinel, he gave us to understand that all were sleeping except three, and they were retiring to the farther end bt'theraviric, and would in a minute be .out-rif sight. ' ' Capital!' said Will, with suppressed excitement. ' Now, each take a pistol and a cutlass from the fellows, and follow me.' One after the other we stepped across the sleeping brigand at the entrance, Will relieving him of his pistol, dirk, and 'blunderbuss ; while the Captain and I stood by ready to give him his quietus at the slightest eign of his waking. Then the four of us, gliding like ghosts, assisted ourselves to whatever weapons we-could most easily lay hands upon; and as Themistocles was not of much use for fighting, we gave him the bag containing.,our valuables—which we found by the side of the sleeping chief—as weli-as ..several spare pistols, to carry. Picking our way without speaking a word, we advanced towards the open end of the rayine, and just as we turned round a jutting piece of-rock, we saw the three sentinels, seemingly in, earnest conversation. ' Halt!' whispered Will. 1 Now for a rush I' and each singling out his man. and clutching his rifle by, the. barrel—for we avoided the noise. o£. shooting—we sprang forward. Al- .most.simultaneously, and before the enemy , had-time.to observe us, we were upon them, and three rifle- stocks descended upon three shock heads with such force, that two of the fellows dropped;)ike-stones. The stock of.my rifle glanced .off"the,hard head o£ my antagonist and crashed against the rock. With a stifled cry, he turned; but in an instant my hand was upon his throat, and the sound died iu his gullet; while with the strength of desperation, T dashed liis head against the wall-likerock ; and after a struggle—iu which lie wounded me with his dagger—he fell.from iny g'raspj apparently lifeless. 'Now,' said the Captain, 'where are the 'donkeys?—Come, GreekyI' he cried to Themistocles; ' bear a hand ;' and looking around; we espied our four animals just as we left'them; but Awith;a brigand sitting by tliem.
