ORIGINAL POETRY A MARRIAGE ON GREAT EXPECTA- TIONS. Adolphus Fitzgibbon went courting by night, Dressed out in his best paper collar. His head was as light as his pockets were tight, For on earth he possessed not a dollar. Jemima and Ma thought Adolphus a catch, He boasted of such grand relations, And so they determined to push on a match, With one who had great expectations. Adolphus, when pressed, pleaded poor as a more, But mamma declared that her daughter Was willing to live in a very small house, And be happy on dry bread and water. The wedding was settled and dear mamma made Extensive and great preparations, A supper was laid for Jemima had wed A man who had great expectations. Their jaunting was short if it were very sweet, For he had not the ghost of a copper, He searched out a bottle some cronies to treat, But nothing came forth but the stopper. ?? with their bills very And worried their lives for the money, The poor couple found that their first wedded moon, Had quite as much fickle as honey. Jemima began to object to his plan, When she had a brief taste of starvation, We could not repeat all she said to the man She had wed with a great expectation. "On water and bread you could flourish" he said, "Your mother has furnished the platter. So dearest Jemima you furnish the bread, And I'll skirmish around for the water." Sept., 1884. John Rae.
