THEATRICAL NOTES. (BY "THE JOHNNIE.'*) "The Johnnie" was cut in a nasty fashion last week by Maggie Moore, and, bai Jove, won't stand it any more. Bless her pretty picture ! * # * On dit that J. C. Williamson will visit Perth with malice prepense. * * » "Mrs. Quinn's Twins" is an Irish musical comedy. " Johanna " is not. * * « Prudes beware, or live and learn Emerson saw Taglioni dance and called it " poetry," but Margaret Fuller termed .it " religion." It is the only religion , of some, and perhaps better than none. \ There are over 3000 ballet dancers in the United States. Each one thinks "she can knock 'em any time/' * * * Variety and dramatic artists already recognise that their " notices " are not decided by " pitch and toss," or " heads and tails," tales I mean. * * # "The Press," a unique spectacular ballet, is being produced at the Empire ! Theatre, London, and the costumes are excellently designed in specially woven j silk to represent at least 70 metropoli j tan journals. Presenting, as they do, a i perfect fae simile of the journal covers, I or representative pages, one can readily single out any particular journal which takes his fancy, and watch it conduct itself in a decorous or giddy manner, as suits the purpose of the entrepreneur. # » » Western Australia will not be ne- glected by Rickards for some time to come. * * * The "people" he has introduced into Australia must be kept going some- how or somewhere, and when the ; Eastern capitals desire a change first class tickets for the West will be the order. Good Melbourne or Sydney pros, will be branded "made in London," alike with the genuine products of England, and shipped to the West. His English introductions are legion, and still they come, or are coming-the Poluskis combination, Peggy Pryde, Pattie Brown, Ugo Biondi. j # . # ! The popular "howman himself opens ! here on Monday night. Shows at the Boyal lately have been giving ap the ghost for want of a quorum. * # * " When London Sleeps" is still pro- foundly awake at the Melbourne Boyal. . * . Dan Barry made a big bit with " Uncle Tom's Cabin "in the Alexandra. He replaces it this Saturday with " The Boll of the Drum." . * » Wilson Barrett also will change his bill from the " Silver King " to " Ham- let " on the same date at Her Majesty's. * * . "The Cotton King" an immense success at Boyal, Sydney. * # . At the Adelaide Bijou, Pope, Sayles, Delohery, Celia Ghilöm, Thorne, and Dell, the Lennon Bros., Pat Melton, and others are making things hum ; while at the Beyal they have had " The Sign of the CroBs," and a "Boyal Divorce "-other divorces are not un- common there. The "Two Little Vagabonds, " The Gay Parisienne," and the "Babes in the Wood" are also billed to follow. By purchasing direct from the manu- facturers in London, Paris, New York, Hamburg, and elsewhere, the Apothe- caries' Company buy at manufacturers' rates, and avoid the exhorbitant charges of middlemen. Hence the low rates charged by the Apothecaries. This company has now five establishments.*
