CAULFIELD TRAINING NOTES. Connolly opened yeetorday morning's work with the hurdle racer, Seizure, and Queen Bess, who did useful work on the inner track. Veritas and Friendless went for two miles at a good bat : Angler and Orlando, in the Bamo stable, cantered and finished with a good spirt. Mr. Pearson's horse3, in the charge of Greig, went a little over tbreo fur longs at a good paco, F. Leng brought out King fisher, Breeze, Canute and Tippity Witcbett, the last named going welt for four furlongs. Batty treated Deceiver to slow rounds on tho sand, giving Yatoly also slow work. The hurdle racer, Ontario, and tho chestnut, Umberto, did mild work. Robinson's Merry Fcnella and Cupola were exercised, spirting home from tbo turn. Tbo Bohemian and Coriolnnus, on tho courso, wont well, thoir stablo companions, Sir Samuel, First Pop and Tandsticker, only canter ing. Melodious went twice on tho grass, spirt ing home. Leek's Scaramouch and Straggler cantered, tho Bteeplechaso winner looking nothing the worse for his victory. Davis's string did their ordinary work, and Burra Burra, The Ghost and Grace Darling were treated to slow work ; Tho Laird only cantered slowly. But few of the horses engaged in the recent Caulfiold races put in an appearance, and the morning's work was not of an exciting description.
