THE NORTHUMBERLAND ELECTION. I BtatÃ«a in one of my letters that the contest in Northumberland would be practically between: Messrs. Norton and Wheeler, and so it turned out;. The other candidates never had the ghost of a,show; and recognising this, Mr. Melville, one of the Federal candi- dates, retired from the.field before nomina- tion day, in the Interests, as he put it, of another Federal candidate.' Federation had really nothing todo with the battle. John Norton stood as a Protectionist and an opponent of Mr. Reid, and Mr. Wheeler as a supporter of thc Premier. He also relied upon the fact that he was well-known throughout the district, having represented it tn the Assembly several years ago. .He polled well, but Norton carried too many guns for him, and the latter has been placed at the top of the poll, I hope he .will conduct : himself better in this Parliament than he did during the few weeks he was a member of the last Parliament. That his conduct then was deserving of severe animad- version he himself frankly admitted to the electors of Fitzroy, and to them he promised, that if he were again elected he would be careful not to permit king alcohol to involve him in trouble. He has any - amount of ability, and if he resistB the temptation to drink more than is good for him that occasionally assails him, he should render valuable service to the country. ,
