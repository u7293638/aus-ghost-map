Kunai would never have been taken had there not bBBfi ^traitor Mtbin its gates. The Rajah had a lieutenant, by- name Muttri, in whom he placed the greatest confidence. Tbciugh ' Muttri. feigned the utmost-devotion for his lord, his heart was bliack with treachery, for he had dared to lilt bis eyes to the beautiful Ranee, and fie loved per. Day find night he cherished: his passion, and thought how he could; make her his own. All'the favours.that he owed to the Rajah's generosity were forgotten. Love alone for the Ranee burned in ,his ioul, absorbing every other passion. At last a plan suggested itself to Muttri's niind, by which he thought he could gain his ends. Amongst thr> garrison were certain relatives of his own. He took them intb his confidence, and the . promise of a large reward made them his devoted tools. That night, when all 1 were at rest except the sentries, a swift jnesjenger lett the fort for the Epgliph camp, He returned.unperceived, \- and Wad' admitted 1 by Muttri. The reply he brought was favourable. Muttri's ; blaok' teyes gleamed with- savage delight. ,Alas for the poor Rajah! there was :np: one to i warn him of the diabolical scheme on foot. A few nights afterwards, Muttri and his friends were all on guard at the principal entrance to the fort. While the Rajah was sleeping in fancied security, stealthy steps approached; the gates were silently opened; one by one the English: soldiers crept in, and;still-the Rajah slept. -Then camp a sudden shout; followed: by< a heart-rending cry. One of the soldiers'on gaard at the palace, within the citadel, had seen the intruders, ;and gave the alarm at the same tnomentbereceived his death-wound.* Then, in that still night, followed the din of war and the clashing of arms, confusion and dismay. The victory was not a bloodless one, for tbe Rajah, at the head of a few staunch'adherents, fought desperately; with all the courage of despair, while the Ranee, with her young child,' was being lowered from the walls overhanging the river. She escaped by way of the Ganges: Shortly afterwards, her gallant lord fell mortally wounded; In the morning, the English were masters of l^e fort. The heads bf the villagers who had killed the Europeans were hung over the gateway by which they '.had entered. : ;War in thbsia' d^ys 'tvtife 'B' much more sav%e game than it is n6w.'

Ap.jthe end jdrew near, .Muttri's ravings made the Dight seem ihideous.

(Water, water, : water I}. The word Traitor, traitor, trai|bor .i 6eemed to come^baok in mockery as'^n epho. '.At last, onegloomy midnight, his fearfol torments ended in.death. :None mourned hisiate. <I - 'V.* Iw- At dawn next day, the following legend w^ 'foundj Scrawled m letterB of blood, on the wall of his prison : . Whatever sleepeth here agaiD, . Shall ne'er a. year it's life retain. The seirvants read the words, and trembled ; the Ranee hbard them with a shudder. Muttri's head was severed from his body, and liiuiig over the gateway that he had Surrendered to the English. ~ HU body was flun^ into the Ganges tor the alligators to devour. Neither man nor beast-was agaip allowed in the room in ' which, he' died;' yet, at night, tbe servants would start from their sleep atad huddle together in fear, declaring that they heard waitings and unearthly moans coming from thait deserted chamber. The. natives are a grossly superstitious! race'.'and they fully believed in the potency of the writing on the wall to do them evil. | A. few days after Muttri's death, the Ranee's only child escaped from its nurse, and wandering about the palace, came at last to this ill-fated room. With child-like curiosity it entered and began to play about on the floor. Tired at last of playing, it lay down on a mat and fell asleep. When the frightened nurse found him the boy was dead. One hand was grasping the ring on the floor, and the other was held over bis eyes, as if be were endeavouring to conceal some awful object from his sight. When the news of this death spread in the city, the superstitious populace repeated to each other in awe-struck tones the prophecy that they had heard was written on the walls. The fulfilment in this case had followed quickly on the event. No man would dare to doubt it. The Ranee and her followers once more fled from Kunai. The palace was allowed tp crumble away in ruins until the English took possession of the fort. Such was the story that the moonshee related to me. It was easy to see, from his tone, that he fully believed it. The sweeper, he said, feared lest the evil rackshus (demon), who inhabited the room would come some day and steal away the lives of the two dogs. I tried to Teason with both of them; but a people steeped in superstitious lore are deaf to all reasun. " Allah," the sweeper 6aid, " hath willed that it should be so. The wayp of Allah are inscrutable." He besought me to remove the dogs at once. At last, in order to get rid of him, J promised to do 60. He left me full of forebodings that some evil awaited his pets. : Shortly before I left Kunai, one of the two dogs, Bouncer, went mad; and had to be destroyed. I thought very little of this at the time, as the heat was very excessive, J and j j dogs.often t. went . mad i at that period of thevear. A short time after Bouncer's death, I was relieved by another detachment, and returned to the headquarters of my regiment, taking Beanty with me. Slowly the year went by; the hot weather gave place to the monsoons, which were heralded as usual by some heavy dust storms—an extraordinary sight to those who see them for the first time. Then the monsoons yielded grudgingly' to the winter—delightful mouths as long as they last. Once more the summer burst upon us, hotter and more shrivelling, if possible,-than it had been the previous year. One special Sunday—I remember it well—the heat was almost suffocating. During the early morning church parade, several men had to " fall out." Yet the irritating movements of the punkah, as it passed backwards and forwards before my eyes, made me feel so giddy that I could hardly endtire it. In the afternoon I went for a ride. Beauty wanted to follow, as usual; it was so hot, however, that I would not take her out. It was a little aftersunset when I returned. On the doorstep was Beauty, anxiously watching for us, 6he and the pony being great friends. She barked joyously, and ran across the compound to meet us. 1 As I was to dine with some friends that evening, I entered my bungalow and began my toilet at once. A few minutes afterwards my sweeper rushed into my roOm in great consternation, and cried out: "Sahib, -Sahib, the' dog is dead!" ; • I ran out, and there she lay panting in the verandah. T dashed a bucketful of water over her ; it did not revive her in any way. In a few moments she had breathed her last. A few minutes before, she seemed full of life; now she was dead. Suddenly the prophecy in connection with the room at Kunai occurred to me. I sought my diary, and tiirne:l over the pages to the date Pn 'which the two dogs had been given tb me: •' Aprils May—June. Yefe, there it was, June -17th—a "year that "very day! Both dogshaddied within the specified time, I thought over this curious coincidence on my way to dinner, and was not a little disturbed at it. During dinner, I was rallied on my silence, and by way of excuse, related to my host the legend of Kunai, and the strange fulfilment of the prophecy that very night. I had hardly concluded when, my khidmuigar, who was standing behind my chair, started forward and shouted: " Sahib, sahib, deko.'" (" Sir, sir, look!") His black face was almost blanched with, fear, as he turned and fled from the room, his snow-white puggaress, which had tumbled off in his haste, streaming behind him. I looked in the direction in which he hbd pointed,. I, too, was 6tartled. Outside. on the lawn, I saw through the glass dooi the full outline, clear and distinct, of the dog that I had just left deadatmy bungalow. Unearthly, unreal, it appeared, as it stood rigid and motionless, tbe rays of the full moon falling upon its form. Its eyes, which glowed like coals of fire, seemed to look a mournful farenell at me. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. In that moment, the spectre had melted away in the dimshade. I could see nothing. Waslawake or was I the victim of a dream, or was this but a freak of vision 1 I looked at my host in blank amazement. He had seen nothing. I was about to explain, when—a yelp and a cry, and Beauty herself came bounding into the room in propria persona. No ghost this time, but solid flesh and blood. She had only a fit, after all, and recovered shortly after I had left my bungalow. My sweeper bad followed me with her, to show me that she was still alive. We laughed heartily over the occurrence, and it was a long time before my " Legend of Kunai" was forgotten in the regiment, for the story got wind. Beauty lived for many a year after that. When she did die it was of a prosaic disease called old age.
