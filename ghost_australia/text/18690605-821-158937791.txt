gaetnt, (Original ami gtltdtfi. AGAIN. Ob, sweet and fair! oh, rich and raze! That day so Ion;; ago, The Autumn's sunshine everywhere, To heather all aglow; The ferns were clad in cloth of gold, The wares sang on the shore; Such suns will shine, such wares will sing, Forever, evermore. Oh, fit and few! oh, tried and true! The friends who meet that day, Each one the other's spirit knew; And so in earnest play The hours flew past, until at last The twilight kissed the shor ■; We said, " Such days shall come again Forever, evermore.'" One day again, no clond of pain A shadow o'er us cast. And yet we strove in vain—in vain To conjura up the past; lake, but unlike the bud that shone, The waves that beat the shore. The words we said, the songs we sung, Like—unlike—evermore. For ghosts unseen crept in between, And, when our songs flowed free, Sang discords in an undertone, And marred the harmony. "The past is ours, not yours," they said, " The waves that beat the shore, "Though like the same, are not the same. "Oh never, nevermore!'' —Eraser s Magazine.
