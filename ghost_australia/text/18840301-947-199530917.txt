The 'feeling of the majority of honour.aBle menibers-of the Assembly wasj however, pretty Tyell ascer Itoined in .regard to certain' proposals ?cpntained in the Local Government Amend:, jmbrit Bill introduced at the fag end of. last. isession, and'as/to be forewarned: is. in a, igreat degree, to] be forearmed; Mr. Servipe !will be able to;, eliminate in, his.^new. bill the portions of !the last, one to-'Tvliichthe, .strongest bbjection was takeriijand so avoid , ?at least one. of ' the dangersj to be faced., ; Sooth to say,, these are npt very great. The jriepor't of , .the , Tariff, r'Cpmmissipn is, it is; 'said, to, be. made a casy,s , bolli, but it js . (hard to seahow, thisi 'can ; adversely affect; ithe Gpyernment, ]as ^tr. ,Mirams,who is; \de facto if not -Se jure, the 'leader, pf tlie 'Opposition, isthe author j of the aforesaid !document. ,. The very' fact that the oppo nents of the- .Ministry,, have, resolved to imake an onslaught' on the Ministry, on the; 'tariir quesbioii, is liiuiuubivu vx uxiuxx- wtjaiv iness. , None .of the recommendations of the jCommissioners, are of a yery radical des cription, and even were .the whole of them adopted, ..there would be no change in i't he settled policy of the country.' The jfree-trader and the protectionist would be jvery much in their present position, and jneither could plume himself as having iachieved a ? victory. The Government, , Itheref ore, , unless guilty of some adminis 'trative blunder— a .somewhat improbable 'contingency: when the proportion of shrewd 'North Britons .in its- comp.osition is borne i in mind — may reckon .itself secure during 'next session, despite, the threatened at ?tacks to which, it is tp be subjected. It iwill take some , time for tho discontented ones to rouse, in ? the country any hostile feeling towards the present- holders of office, whose ways of ? pleasantness and paths of peace are in marked contrast to, long previous years of strife and turmoil. Mr. Patterson, who in some quarters is,, looked upon as the coming man, is [in England; and Mr. .Berry,- the present, bete, noire of the Liberal party he once led;, is. prepared at the shortest notice .. to give his enemies the slip by retiring into the sn,ug haven of the Agent- Generalship, which: Mr. Smithy — who on his retirement is to be enabled to speak of his cara sposa as 'her ladyship' — is ready to vacate on the shortest notice, The present Chief Secre tary is evidently desirous of showing that, like Sir,Bryan O'Loghlen, he, top, can make 'sacrifices' when his country and his. own convenience require that he should immolate himself on the altar of duty. With two thousand a-year for five years — and pick ings — Mr. Berry's- political, death would not — to himself at least — be a painful one. And with the noble, Roman .of, old, the honourable gentleman on quitting Parliamentary life might truthfully ex-, claim: JJulce et decorum est pro-patria mori.- And apropos of the Agent- Generalship, is: there not a ludicrous side to Mr. Murray Smith's offer of the Victorian gun and torpedo boats to the British Government ? It no doubt shows our loyalty and love of , the old country. But is it not very much, like offering to lend five shillings to the Eothschilds, or assist the Bank of England with the advance of a sovereign? It is a' matter for regret, however, that the offer could not be accepted. Our war vessels would have earned the prestige which iittaches to the, fact of having seen 'active service,' and the eoho of their .guns sounded more warlike when it was remem bered that a trreal enemy' had been sub jected to their fire. . ?
