THE EIGHT-HOUR SYSTEM. SIR,—Considering that the topic named at the heading of this communication is about one of the freshest now before the people of Brisbane,— and one which affects the interest of many,—I think that I am only performing a duty which any citizen should do, when he feels that the sub- ject has been agitated mostly by persons who have no desire for the public good, but only for popularity, and who are actuated by an endeavour to crash parties who are struggling hard for a living. You must be aware, Sir, that a short time since, tenders were invited by the Corpora- tion for certain works, to be executed in different portons of this city, and that, after careful con- sideration, our civic authorities decided upon ac- cepting the one sent by Mr. Love. No sooner had this gentleman commenced operations than a meeting was called for the purpose of introducing the Eight Hour System, and I have great reason to believe by one whose tender was rejected by the Council. Although I have a desire to see the eight hours introduced wherever practicable, still I cannot refrain from expressing a hope that it will not be at present,—for I am confident, if a certain person had obtained the contract, we should not have heard of the subject, at least for some time. Would it not be an act of injustice to force the system upon gentlemen who have taken contracts at a specified sum. There is no doubt these contractors have been put to great expense in procuring labor, and they would pro- bably be ruined if their workmen struck for the eight hours to-morrow, with ten hours pay, as urged by one who shall be nameless. I don't feel a pleasure in stirring up dirty water, yet, not seeing any one else coming for- ward to expose this affair, I trust my ideas will find a corner in your columns, and be the means of showing to these deluded persons the object of one of their agitators. Yours, &c.;, DAVID'S GHOST. Brisbane, April 22.
