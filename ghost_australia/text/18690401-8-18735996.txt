DISTRICT NEWS. [Ã¯rom our various correspondents.] NEWCASTLE. Presentation.-On Sunday afternoon last a beautiful and elegantly bound bible was pre- sented to Miss Allpass, on her retiring as a teacher from the Wesleyan Sunday-school in this city. The bible which had been purchased by the teachers of the school, was presented on their behalf by Mr. William Arnott. On the fly leaf of the book the following was neatly written :-" Presented to Miss Allpass by the Superintendent and Teachers of the Newcastle Wesleyan Sunday-school, with the earnest prayer that in her new and important sphere of usefulness the blessings of the Lord may rest upon her." Tuesday evening. (From the Pilot of Wednesday ) Rev. F. D. Bode.-The Rev. F. D. Bode ' arrived in Newcastle by yesterday morning's steamer, and will, we are informed, immediately commence his duties in connection with St. John's Church. The rev gentleman was re- ceived on the wharf by the churchwardens, and afterwards proceeded to the parsonage. The Rev. Mr. Bode is one of the most eminent preachers in the colony, and his arrival will be hailed with satisfaction by those belonging to the church. We hear that the Rev. G. C. Bode, the late incumbent, is in the enjoyment of good health since his departure from Newcastle. Mr. T. W. Hogue, of Newcastle, while playing cricket, injured his hand severely by slipping down and striking it against the handle of the bat. It broke one of the small bones of the back of the hand. A servant girl, sent out late on Sunday evening to gather chips, to use in lighting the fire on Monday evening, near the new coal staiths, frightened some foolish man into the belief that she was a ghost ; and on his giving the alarm to some other equally wise young men, the whole body rushed upon the poor girl, and rather roughly used her, to prove how little they dreaded a ghost.
