The Ballarat Star gives the following sketch of the scene :— "When the proper time came, the operators threw into the furnace some three cwt or so of metal consisting of old brass engine fittings and blocks of copper and tin, more fuel was heaped on, the air-drum hummed and buzzed more vigorously, and as the sulphurous flames emitted more and more brilliance the faces of the spec- tators» were lit up with a ghastly hue, as if they belonged to a crowd of ghosts huddling together to see a weird scene on the verge of Pandemo- nium. Presently, after the chief ministers in the rite had poked and probed vertically and horizontally into the hissing furnace the metal was pronounced to be ready for the flow. Then the iron ladle was set beneath the bottom of the furnace, and the molten fluid rushed out, hiss- ing, sputtering, glowing, bright, with leaping flames of blue that seemed to bite spitefully at the iron rod with which one of Vulcan's men skimmed off the dross which floated on the surface. At this moment Mrs. Wilson, who had collected a lot of silvei coins from the company, threw them into the heaving metal and thus contributed, let us hope, a silvery sweetness to tho bell which is by-and-by to call worshippers to the church. The metal was then poured into the mould, and the whole process declared to be safely completed. Sub- fequently a smaller bell was cast, the process being in all respects similar to the larger affair. When the casting of tho church bell was done, the Rev Mr Irovoi, surrounded bv tho spec I tators appionchetl tbo mould and said -' I pronounce this bell dedicated to the »oiship of God, by the name of St David, in ti o name of the Tnther, the Son, ond the Holy Ghost-Amen Cheers, hearty and lcpeated, wero then given for the founder, »nd the ceio inonywas over savo that thoio was an adjoin n ment to Mr Higgins' private house hard by, where temperate libations wei o poured in honor of the event of the day The St. David bell is the largest over cast in Ballarat foi chuich purposes, its weight being a httlo ovor 2 cnt, and its dimensions 20} inches at bottom, with a height of 22 inches The smaller bell east at the same time weighed about half cwt Tho next laigest bell cast hero for church use is that of St Peter's in Sturt street, which weighs about 120lbs., and was cast nearly two years ago at the Victoria Foundry, by Messrs Hunt und Opie. The same firm cast the largest bell yet made here—namely, the bell cast six or seven years ago for the Ballarat Fire Bri- gade, which weighed between 5 and 6 cwt. Mr Higgins, the caster of the St. David bell, is also the generous donor of the bell to the church, of which he is an active member, and a liberal supporter. He bears all the expense of the process, and makes the bell a free gift to the church." I
