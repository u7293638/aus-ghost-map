A CHINESE GHOST. —Ararat Ad vertiser. Those of our readers who are anxious to witness what is generally regarded as a most unusual spiritual phenomenon may per haps, have their wish gratified by a visit to Phillip’s Flat at the ** witching hour of night.’* A, party of Chinamen, who for years past have been engaged in mining operations in the place, and from the substantial appearance of their huts must have .laboured with profit, have just precipitately left .in conse quence of the repeated nightly visit of the per. turbed spirit of a deceased Celestial. It will be remembered that some two or three months ago a Chinaman was found dead in bis hut at that place, his death being attributed to disease and neglect, and since that time his compatriots, no doubt feeling some pangs of conscience regarding their/behaviour to the departed, aver that his spirit haunts, the place. Care was taken on the man's death to burn down his but, and to offer up prayers and sacrifices at his grave, but. still, in bis pigtail clad, he walks the night, and in dismay the Chinamen have, left the place.
