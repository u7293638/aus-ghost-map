THK 'ROYAL' GHOST. TO TUB EDITOR OP THE AGE. Sin, — I beg tho favor of asking Mr Barry Sullivan a few questions throngh your journal, and the queries which I wish to put are these : — 1. If Mr Sullivan received a letter from a lawyer prohibiting him from introducing tho ghost illusion in his theatre, will he state tho exact time ho received the letter ? 2. Why did not Mr Sullivan announce, before a quartor to eleven o'clock, that ho could not produce the ghost ; aud why did lie allow the large placards to remain up at the entrance to the theatre tho whole of Saturday evening ? 6. Did Mr Sulhvan ever intend to produce a ghost at all ; if so, who pre pared tho necessary paraphernalia, and where is it to be seen ? I ask these questions out of no ill will to Mr Sullivan, but simply giving him an oj portunity of removing an unpleasant impression which clings to the minds of many who paid their money on Saturday night to see the ghost, and was, like yonr humble servant, COMPLETELY SOLD. I enclose my card.
