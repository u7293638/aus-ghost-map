Amusements in Sydney. OUR Sydney correspondent, writing on March 25, says:— That refined and gifted actress, Mrs. Scott Siddons, has returned to Sydney, and commenced a short farewell season at the Queen s Theatre, supported by a very good company. Mr. T. S. Scott-Sid€onß has tho lesseeship of the theatre. Among the company aro Miss Constanco and Miss Alice Dcorwyn, two intelligent aud viva cious young actresses ; Mr. William Audrows, who immortalised himself aa Deacon Skinner iv "Struck Oil;" Mr. C. Mortyne, Mr. H. Flemming, Mr. Charles Holloway, Mrs. Charles Jones, and others. The com pany opened on Saturday in Byron's remark ably successful comedy, " Our Boys," which was introduced to the Sydney stage some time ago by Mr. Horace Lingard, and which has been played in London for over a thousand nights. It is a lasting reflection ou the taste of the Sydney public that this spleudid comedy, splendidly played as it was, drew but poor audiences. Tbe feature of the piece is the character Perkin Mid dlewick, a retired butterman, of which Mr. Lin gard gave bucli a finished impersonation that those who saw it can speak of it only in extrava gant superlatives. Mr. Andrews is a very good low comedian, but suffers in comparison with his predecessor in the character of Middltwick, and Mr. Lingard's impersonation is still so fresh in the mind that one canuot help making the com parison. Mrs. Scott-Siddons is, of cour.-c, the star, aud a bright particular star she in, shining with a lustre that was never before shed in tho bijou theatre in York-street. She bad a lirgo and fashionable audience. Tho Darrells ure still at the ltoyal, doing a moderate business with original sensation dramas ; and Mr. ('reswick continues to attract large audiences to tho Victoria. He has added The Stranger awl Curd!mil Wohoj ("King Henry VIII.") to hisli-t of impersonations. Tho Marionettes are nt tho School of Arts, and Darcy Read's Ghost Show at the Guildhall.
