ANECDOTES. ——iii— COUNSELS TO PREACHERS. I. As to the witter :-r(l) When you go out to preach don't go out to say something, but have something to say. (2.) Be quite sure that the something you have to say is Scripture: " Preach the Word." In these days, when the old Book is assailed, let us stand by it. (3.) You must feel that this something ds very important, or you will not be earnest. But earnestness in preaching roust be preceded by earnestness in prayer. (4.) Speak your something understandably. The use of long and difficult words is certainly antagonistic to edification. II. As. to the manner of preaching:—(1.) Be natural. (2.) Beware ol imitation. (3.) Speak confidently. (4.) Speak like men. (5.) Speak affectionately. (6.) Speak cheerfully. (7.) Speak to men as if: they were in danger. (8.) Remember there is one listener we cannot see, and that is God, who weighs every word we utter! (9.) Remember that what you say will not be palatable to your hearers. (10.) Preach God the Holy Ghost. III. Suffer a word of caution. Take care of getting yourself into the sermon. Keep yourselves . behind, and the Master in front, IV. Take a .word of encouragement. . Remember ym can't convert sinners—that is God's work : you plant and wator; He gives the : increase.
