SECOND READINGS. PHILIP BURKE MARSTON. By T. D. To those who know Philip Burke Marsion's work it may seem strange that the choice for a Second Reading should fall on him. One would imagine him too sombre or too pas- eicnate by turns to justify scanning bis poems when a quiet evening with no unkind influences to disturb is the one desideratum. But now and again even the happiest of us have our gloomy days—days when it is our enjoyment to steep ourselves In clouds of gray. And Marston's sorrow is, after all, one that soothes rather than disquiets. It is so deep, co heartbroken, the remem brance of his darkened life is so poignant, that, selfish though it be, comparisons are inevitable, and we contrast his dally round with ours, and find how much more we have to be thankful for. Can one '.magine a harder lot than his ? " The Blind Poet !" What messages of misery those three simple words convey ! AnJ then, as though fate had Bingled him out to show the world how much misfortune she could heap on the bowed shoulders of one man, she took from him, be-ides his eight, all that ha-1 made life worth the living. Mother, father, sisters, sweetheart—all went from him, leav ing him to fight the blackness alone. Small woudei is it that when everything is- gone hiß eoul goes out in its loneliness, and his cry of absolute sadness is heard m this : 1 walk 'neatli sunless skies ; by flowerlees ways With failing feet and heavy heart I go. Through leafless trees vague winds of twilight blow A strange, still land it is ; ghosts of old days Hise up to meet me, a beloved dead face Emerges on my path ; or, sweet and low The accents of some voice I used to know Full on my fieavt, where only sorrow stays. My ghostly land, where thro', myself a ghost, I journey ever toward that stranger strand By which no ships from this world ever coast. Ah, there, shall 1 lemember, still my Land ? Nj'.y, (Joii,—lf any God indeed there be, Grant me, in Death, roleii.se from memory. But even in the midst of it all lie can sing of true passion. Robert Buchanan and others of his kind would doubtless call him fleshly ; but, as you read, and feel the yearning throb #at pulse* through his verse, that stigma falls from him as a garment. It is borne in upon you that he is Ixv above the ordinary human feelings, far r-miovud from all the clash and counter-claeh of minor emotions. He stands aloof untouched of the world, but, with hie imagination and sensitiveness combined to help him, be can portray such a passion-racked woman as toe does in " A Christmas Vigil," a poem al moßt —not quite—Swlnburnian in character, but without (to the full), the rosee auJ rap tures of England's most sensually sensuous poet. Or if that be too human for your lik ing, take at a venture any of his other son nets wteriin he tells of the love lost, and this long since, but remembered yet. Was it fur this we met throe years ago ; Took handtt, spake low, sat side b.v side, .md heard - The sleeping trees beneath us touched and stirred By some mild twilight wind, an soft iw mow, And with the sun's late kisses still aglow? Was it for this the ciul wax so deferred ? For this thy :ip.< at length let through the word . Thut saved my soul, aa alj Love's angels know ? Was it for thi*, timt sweet word being said, We kissed, and clung together in our bliss. Ami walked within Love's sunlight and Lov>'m sha<le ? Was it fo:* this- to dwell henceforth apart. One housed vHih death, and one with beggared heart ? Niiy, Miroly, love, it was for more .than this. . To rcen of grosser c!ay, perhaps,.there may I seem a note in the lines of his love- topics that awakes too insistent a chord in their own nature. It may be that hi 3 words arouse in their breasts too many fcinu of liun:an uatur? close to tbeii own. But to tho3e who caji grasp the personality' of the pes-t shining through all his work there is no such suggestion, fo them he is fjr abDve and beyond such ordinary manliko feelings, but that he may be excused to those who 6ee him In the lesser ligtit Uke Sir Launcelot's isorig to Genleveve. ' She is fresh, and she in bright, Joy oik -is the morning light, Tender as a summer nieht. Wherein mm Irwe their souls for bliss, Aml v:itrs come wufteil like a kiss From crimson lips of Gttcncvero { Who so wlatVly, who bo fair Ab my own love, Gucncvere ? i Or this to a child : I kitw you, iJcnr, imO very sweet is this To fool you arc not tainted by my kisu t Cling-with your warm, soit arms about me so, tiive me one small, sweet kiss, and murmur low In speech as sweet as broken music is. Even if we eliminate moßt of his passion ate poeiua, -there is much in Maraton to keep our spirits at rest. . First and foremost there is his worship qf the sea. In all her aspects the great mother ocean appeals to blm. " The soft, low ripples," " billows warm with storm instead of sun," " the warm, aweet- sinelling foam," " the moan of billows," " white-sailed ships dreaming on their shining way"—one and all he loves hor. And as lines like these recur again and yet again throughout his verse, you catch yourself dreaming of sun- baked beaches, with a warm, wet wind shouting through the trees that fringe it, of the league-long roller, or of the gentle wash of waves. Then from that you drift on into the hues of hazy thought the play of the ever-restless ocean always brings up. Therefore, before you take the half-forgotten volume up again read this — Have we not loved Die sea together, deav V Not as they love.who come, one hour a day, To brt'iitlio He life, «rul {lien come not too near, 1-t-nt tin- waves take them in the face with spray; You, when the heat t fiery scourge became, Ami nivriad shafts of sunlight charged the main, Wo did not fail at' all ! Our eyes could pierce Between the blinding air and steaming beach ' To where, weighed on l>y summer, fair anil herd. 1, The sea lay. tranced in bliss too <teep for r.pecch. But it is not only the sea of Nature's wonders that the blind poet reveres. You may join with him in worship at other shrines of the same great god. It is here that his work loses that unutterable sad ness that marks his personal poems, aud such lines and verses ligbicn the grayness of his poetry. As one reads one forgets his lack of sight, impelled to that forgetfulness by the grasp he has of all the delights of English rural scenes. Could any imagine that a man whose days and nights were blank alike, to whom the beauties of spring and summer were painted by words alone, could write as he does in " Out of Eden"— Again the summer comes, and all is fair ; A sea of tender blu<>, the sky o'erhead Stretches its peace ; the roses, white and. red, Throuarh the deep dilenee of the tranced air, In a mute ec6tasy of love declare Their wuls in perfume, while their leaves are fen With dew ami moonlight, that fall, softly shed Like slumber on pure eyelids unaware. Lines like these set one eagerly on the search for more. And in the finding one almost seems " to feel the wind against you as you run," can realise the pleasures of "the wild beginning of the spring," of "wind stirred bowers," " the warm, keen smell of hay," " the paths with lilies and with roses sown," that were his by every sense but seeing. And, in his " Garden Secrets," the beauties of his adoration are there to en chant you in plenty. The graceful delicacy of " The Rose and the Wind," or " The Garden's Lose," the dainty charm of " Garden FTairies," are all of a nature to fascinate. Thus, for an instance — Golden butterflies gleam in the sun, Laugh at the flowers, and kiss each one ; And pieat bees come, with their sleepy turn-, To sip their honey and circle around ; A small white cloud in a sky of blue ; Rcees and lilies, what will they do ? For a wind springs up, and sings in the trees. Down comes the rain ; the gardens awake-; Roees and lilies begin to quake, That were roekod to sleep by the gentle breeze. And then, for another taste, take, as it please you, the quaint imagery of " Wind Gardens"— Midway, between earth and sky There the wild wind gardens lie,— -if- Tossing gardens, setret bowers, Full of song, and full of flowers, • Wafting down to us below Buch a fragrance as we know Never yet had lily or rose Tlut our fairest garden knows. It is always beat to leave Mareton here, when the story of his sad existence has been thrust in the baexground by these verses and others just as musical. But. neverthe less, you are loth to do so. There is a grip about his sorrow that brings you back to it, even though you desire it not. Back wards and forwards through his pages your fingers turn, catching the minor melody in many of them, until, as the evening wears to its close, you are at last arrested and satis fled with his sonnet, " In Praise of Sleep"— There in a land where nightly I repair, At whose dim gate I put my cross aside, Stretch out my arnut towards Rest as toward . a bride, And am withal assuaged. Ah, even there, Beyond false hope, beyond the stress of prayer, Beyond the hurt and smart of broken pride, With no more hunger for sweet things denied, My heart has rest and respite from despair. O, land of mystic shapes and languid pleasure— Waste fields of poppies without track it seems, 0 scentless lilies by the voiceless streams » here come my ghostfl, and dance a silent measure, Hold my last joy now ; only in dear dreams Give back to me, sometimes, my buried treasure. Mars-ton's message may be a monotonous one, his genious may be a circumscribed one, but you find excuses for him, and, after all, his songs, • sombre though they We, hold you enrhaiiul while they are but slightly, rf at all, unrestful in their character. And as the book closes regretfully you remember his lines on " A Wish," and forgive him everything— I do but ask a little time of peace Before the end of all. 1 crav.: no bliss; 1 crave no love, nor fame, but only this— On summer days to bask beneath old trees, Or, half asleep, fo lie by gentle seas, Hearing the waves that whisper ere tnoy kiss, Then break and babble ; or, wlien twilight is, And one by one'the birds from singing cease; Wander' the patient, tranquil bills 'amorrg, And languish in an exquisitcregret, And here .1 sad,--but not diacoudant song Possess the air ;-and when the sun is set. Lie down with thankfulness to know, ero lonif. All tilings that ever were, I shall forget.
