He spreads his "pavilion, "becomes my '.'salva tion," . - And liideth me safe in unspeakable joy ! All ! was it not thus when the foe, deeply angered, . O'er Attaka's plains flew on Israel's track? The " cloud of his presence,", by day as a van guard, At uight was a warder of Are at their .' back ! , And the ages proclaim, with an eloquent power, "0 trust in the Lord, ever trust Himj ye saints ! He, the ' Refuge ' and 'Fortress,' the 'Rock' and ' High Tower,' The ' Strength of your heart,' is not weary nor faints ! " His potent ' right hand ? all his chosen invest- '"/' ing, .. Still casteth a' 'shadow,' his love's 'secret place '! E'en now, as with Daniel, swift peril arresting, That shadow shall tell of the might of his grace!
