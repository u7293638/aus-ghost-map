Autumn meeting was beautifully line, and lakitu; lhal l.niin conjunction with the highly successful character of the open ing day's spoil, it was nut suipriaing lo lim! ail excclieiit att- ndance tu \ lew the racing. The aLi'au;jo:-ieuis for the day moved with the ulmoet smouthms-, and ilit- various oflicials woiked assiduously to brin^ the meet ing lo a successful conclusion. The racing was of on interesting nature, the linishes for the majority of ihe races being keenly foughi out. The lacing was inaugurated with the run ning of the Fiying Handicap, foi which eleven cariied silk. Fortress was made favourite, v.hilst Fashion, TiienM, und Haul Times found rolid --uppoil. The Cuinmi sion in fn\ur of Fashion was woikr-1 cit the last moiii.nl and the good thing duly came '-H, for afler Mi null a had the opposition apparently settled at the distance, Fashion made a run at h-r half way down th* lails, and. disj-o.-ing of h'.-r in a few -tri-l«.«. won J'dlher comfortably. None oi ihe other fancied ont.s showed up at tht finish. J-'«n truss /mmI Tii^nid both finishing m the way back dh ision. Half a dozen wu*t to the post foi ihu Hurdle Kate. Pat was regarded as a moral ceiiainty, and with a professional pilot on board backus would probably have been called upon to lay i to 1 on to obtain a wager, but a clever rut-e tu obtain a good price was effected. An unknown quantity in thepei son of Mr ' Inverday' Dawson was given charge of Pat's sltei ing gear, and as doubts were freely expiessed as to that gentleman's ability to 'get the country1' with Pat the fielders reduced their uque&t; for odds oil, and at evens Pat was ; freely backed, and a good parcel of wagering was secured a little later ou at odds i of 5 to 4. British Boy lound a deal of favov at 3 to 1, his chant-c being fancied in ihe event ol Pat making a mistake. None of the other runner6 were backed to any extent. When the lield were let go Pat was imme diately taken to the front, and never allow ing the opposition the ghost of a ' look in'' his pilot landed him a very easy winner, much to the chagrin of the fielders. Mr Dawson's handling of Pat was a couiplute revelation to the sceptics, for, handling hin charge with the judgment of a veteran, he rode a winning race all through, and landed a tidy little stake for Pal's connections. The scratching pen was freely used in the Cenveuliou Stales, and eventually six runners went lo the post, lnverday's in different running in the (Queen's Handicap on the previous day was not taken much heed of, and so strong a set was made in his favour that be left off lirst favourite at 5 to 4 on. Montaua was genuinely backed at 2 t' 1 against, but none of the others were backed to auy extent. The race was an exceedingly pretty one, the field being bun :hed all the way, and a furlong from home the whole of the runners were under tbe whip aud appeared to have a winning ch&uce.; Montaua was the first to show out, and getting away from the opposition half way down the rails scored a two lengths wiu. Half a dozen saddled up for the Disposal Stakes, for which only two were backed to any extent, Beview at 5 lo 4 on and Glow worm at 3 lo 1 against. The history of the race is soon told, for Glowworm, ruuniug to the frout at the start, led all the way, and won comfortably from the favourite. On being submitted to auction, the wiuner wu; bought in for £23. The Farewell Haudicap produced a splen did racc, and fittingly wound up au excellent meeting. Nearly all the runners were strongly supported. Half way down the rails live at least of the field were hard at it, but Mineslra lasted longest and scored a head win from Kapid, who beat Alma by a similar distance for second honors.
