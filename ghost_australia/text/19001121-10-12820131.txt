If a real, bona-fide settlement is reached on the present uiiBoltled foundations, it might be wisdom for Yankee Doodle to keep his wonthoi-o)o open and constantly on the watch for this wily old Oriental diplomat, who has evidently studied Tnlleynnid's definition of language. "Language." Bind the great Pionthinnii, is a system 111 voiced by men for the purpose of conceal- ing their thoughts." But fraught as on foreign affairs me with difficulty and danger, they are lost sight of as we begin to realise the fearful extent of the dread ful calamity which swept from the face of the our at Galveston, the beautiful Queen of the Gulf of Mexico, which seemed certain, in a few years, to become the great Com mercial depot of the extreme Southern States, and the point from which Europe was eventually To leave her imports of cotton, lumber, coin, sugar, tobacco, and other articles of export which Europe so foods and the South arises in such abundance Only a few hours before the de still nig angel passed over the happy homes, no more prosperous city could be found in all the South Peace, plenty and! happiness was the rule poverty and misery the exception The citizens, happy and content sat outside their houses, having a friendly chat with their neighbours, with no thought of coming danger Suit denly the wind begins to use, and every moment it met cases in volume, and those that were sitting on their doorsteps, 01 were talking with their neighbours, while standing on the street, found it convenient to seek shelter in their houses to avoid the fire of the storm Wherever the piercing blast struck sharp gables 01 collections of telegraph wires, it awakened uncanny noises, it shrieked and howled in frightful and lnhaimoinouH discord that heralded the wrath to come out in the Gulf the storm, in its mail fury, bad lashed the seething waters into a milk white foam, which at caught up and lifted to the clouds, and then, with the wild cry of a thousand times, leaped forward and daShed a mighty wave on the devoted city The fiends had triumphed, under the boiling whirlpool were burned thousands of dead who will answer no reveille till the Aichaiigol's turnip When the news of this terrible disaster first reached us, the dead were reckoned by hundreds and the financial loss by hundreds of thousands, By noon of the next for the death toll was fearfully man replied Thousands of hearthstones were desolated, and the toll of the dead was so vast that the enumerators, in despair, gave o up the counting The island on which Galveston stands is but a few feet above the level of the ocean which surrounds it, and the destroy tng wave which swept over it buried the city many feet beneath the seething who- this Houses collapsed on every Side bury ing (he dwellers beneath the inner, shell of despair and rates for aid were heard on every hand. But they fell on the ears of those who were themselves in deadly peril, and facing cor tant death, which quickly came to their relief How many polished in that sombre storm will probably never be known But from out of the soil ion and gloom of this sad story comes a. bright streak of hope and light and charity Prone to evil as the sparks fly upward, this is not such a bad world after all No sooner had the telegraph announced the these story of destruction than clubs were formed, money, medicines, and provisions filling railroad trains and steamships were hurrying to the scene of destruction Wluitovei mortal man could do to aid the suffering of help the needy was done ME that broad and generous manner the knowledge of which honours humanity, no matter what its creed, com plosion, of degree. The question which is now under consideration in the great commercial city of Texas is whether a new Galveston skill also over the ashes of the old It would seem like tempting Providence to raise a new city over the dead members of the past, and yet it might be well to to member that little old adage that light mug seldom strikes twice in the same place, and calamities like that which swept Galveston from the face of the earth only occur once or twice in a thousand years. Of one thing Texas may rest assured, that aid will not be refused as long as it will be needed And whether they build on the ruins of seek another site for the now Galveston, they will have the God speed of their fellow countrymen one the right hand of fellowship The week which has just passed has been marked by three or four eventful and phenomenal tragedies Stat only two weeks ago a man and woman took a room at a prominent hotel on Broadway). In the morning; the cliainlicrmnid knocked at the door, Receiving no reply, she informed the landlord; the door was opened; the woman lay dead on the bed, and the man dead on the floor. It seemed as if it might be a nine days' wonder, but the man proved to be the ne'er-do-well son of one of the most fashionable ladies in the land, but as for the woman - God help her - let her rest. New York has many sins to answer for. She would have her hands full, and her character smirched, had she nothing to do except to take care of her own wicked family. But in all the great sensational crimes which furnish our large newspapers with their daily bread, the principal actors come from the country, and the city has to answer for Heaven help the poor historian who, at some future age, shall attempt to write the history of these evil days. One important factor stands out gloomy and forbidding, and that is the deterioration of our national character, for we now begin to realise the truth of that trit'Oi and ancient adage, that "Evil communications corrupt good manners." lb may not be- new;, but it is better understood that; the high sounding name of diplomacy is but another definition for lying. Take, for instance, Li Hung Chang. During the weary months that every civilised nation on the globe was tortured with an agony such as the world had never known before, this wily old Chinaman sits down in our midst as cool as an iceberg and is not aware that anything is wrong. Missionaries are butchered and ministers assassinated in open day, but Prince Li sees no cause for war in such trifles as these. It is generally supposed that a minister represents his country, and that no matter what happens his person is sacred. If war is to take place he gets notice to leave but here, suddenly, without any formal declaration of war or any disturbance in our diplomatic relations, the gates of the Imperial city of Peking are closed and all communication is cut off with the outside world, and frightful stories of robbery and murder set all Christendom aflame. The assassination of the German minister added fuel to the fire, and all the great fighting nations of Europe made Germany's cause their Town, and here is where China displaced her magnificent) diplomacy With mighty armies, bl entailing vengeance, hastening by land and sea to aid in China's destruction, and ships loaded with Krupp, guns and Mauser rifles on their way to aid them in their mission of revenge, China sees no reason why war should be declined and England France, and the United States coincide in that opinion While the allied armies are thundering at her gates the Imperial Court flees from Peking and takes refuge in a city several hundred miles away Why did not Prince Li fly with the Don aged Empress and her Com till Because he could see more that would benefit China from the outside of the big will than he could possibly sec on the inside cunning old fox ! ' What s the matter with 4th Li He's all right " He says that the missionaries have been the cause of all the disturbance by abusing the religion of China forgetting that China had her religion professed by) millions of worshippers long centuries before Christianity was dreamed of md the religion of Chin was the fixed faith of uncounted millions Christianity was divided into bundled-, of ng gressive sects every one of which de nounced its neighbour as a fraud unworthy of belief while in China among the millions just spoken of her religion was honoured and snared and received without question and from the earliest time was the law unchangeable and eternal The constant was going on by the representatives of the different divisions brought the whole body of Christians into contempt the contempt the Chinese felt for Christianity and its advocates is evidenced by the names applied to its supporters All outside the empire of China were bad but rains and the favourite team was pigs representing one of the lowest forms of human life While dip loving) and lying were synonymous terms in China up to the recent w ii the) gone i ill) acknowledged the sacredness of the represent lines of nations outside the great hall and then representatives i bleach had the guarantee of a nations honour their safety For years in China a quiet revival which enlisted the sympathies of millions was going four ii d to protect the ancient religion and defend it from the attacks of the aggies blue Clnistiins Uho Boxers whose mine has become so familiar were really the defenders of the ancient faith and whole their work and aims were fully understood they received the aid mel support of all sorts of people from the Dowager Empress to the lowest coolie who peddled his vegetables and fish in all the it cities of the empire to power last begin to be felt by riots and a religious distill b nice in war must, parts of the empire distant however from the great capital of Peking This is done undoubtedly to test the feelings of the people Then came the closing of the Chinese capital the assassination of the German Minister and the desperate resistance of the different legations winch for several months were threatened with destruction in its most in play form It was impossible to get all) reliable. news from our Legation Several times their assassination was reported merit a is generally conceded that the work of pun fication had begun and would continue till not one Glnistnn native 01 foreign would be found in the care of China And here is the point which it would be well for the Allied Fascista conside Li Hung Chang is to day The greatest In nig Glunain in and in his hands was placed the power of the empire whether for peace- 01 Tin Can it be supposed that this man so near the empire a trust did not know whether the reports that reach ed the best of every civilised nation were true or false?
