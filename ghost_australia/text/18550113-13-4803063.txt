TASMANIA. Fr.OM OUR OWN OOIHIXSI'OMONT.) Hobart Town, January 9th, 1855. At half-past eleven o'clock this morning, the signal flying at the flagstaff, and the booming of a salute of thirteen guns, announced the arrival of the City of Hobart, conveying our new Governor to our shores. Shortly afterwards the steamer was boarded by the Hon. the Colonial Secretary, the Aide-de-Camp and the Port of Iii jor. I know not whether Sir Henry Young had formed to himself any anticipation of there being a certain " process and circumstance " to attend his arrival, or had looked forward with pleasure to meeting an enthusiastic greeting ; not if he had, how bitter must have been his disappointment. His arrival failed to arouse our sluggish town (which seems, like the fat boy in Pickwick, to be always sleeping) from its natural listless apathy. There was no noise, no bustle, no excitement. Our indolent authorities j had made no preparation j our indolent people appeared to feel but little interest or curiosity. The tokens of welcomes were Indeed 'forward ' scanty.. At the last moment ODO or two vessels I managed to run up about a dozen solitary looking fogs. Some score of the 90th and their base lined the quay, whiles a few handled persons were seen making their way with as leisurely steps as usual through our quiet streets to our scarcely less quiet wharf Upon Sir Henry 1 eling's touching the shore, a unit attempt was made to raise the ghost can cheer, but so faint was it that it was greeted with a launch, and died away at once Thus amid the silence of all, and the covered heads of many, His I excellency and Lady Young hurried with rapid steps to a meat tin oval looking equipage, which was in readiness to convey them to Government House Hero Sir "NA William Denison was waiting to receive them, and so ended this reception, where, to use a quaint old paradox, " there was nothing may inn. but stagnation is 1 rememb r being very much amused at the exaggerated welcome with which the good people of Melbourne greeted Sir Charles Hotham a man of whom they knew nothing, save that perhaps about one in every Jil indeed had a faint glimmering of an idea that he had conducted some negotiation somewhere about the slave trade or Otaheite, or (he Free Islands or something of the fund 1 Further than this their knowledge w cut not But, not withstanding, they were determined to work themselves up into a state of red hot excitement and successful They accordingly made a public' holiday, hung out their flags, planned their devices enlisted in the unwieldly procession every 1 cry of men they could got hold of, from the free' and easy of a public house to the dread mail. rates of the Executive Council, jumbled together j eel is not inappropriately, the Legislative Council with the United Society of Oddfellows -the Mayor and the Corporation with Mr Rowe, and his Ci cus, and befooled themselves to their heart a content Ludicrous honor, as to c-c extravagancies were on your part they were infinitely preferable to the apathy amounting to disrespect, shown by the day's reception of Sir Henry Young On nov Govcuor comes amongst us no untried man I re of his y wrath even he has been placed in man' difficult official position!, and has acquitted him self creditably on all Pressing for the 1M eight years over a neighboring colony, and called upon to watch over her interests at one of the most critical periods of her history, he has so discharged his duties as to was in the esteem of nearly every one of his fellow colonists, and a dead art amidst almost universal regret Yet the highest tokens of respect which the administer the ability of our Executive, I legislative, and municipal bodies combined can devise to offer him is the firing of a few cannons, and the mill tury salute of a dozen soldiers The lack of enthusiasm evinced by the poop!
