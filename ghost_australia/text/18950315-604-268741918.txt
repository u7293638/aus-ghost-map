Ilie False Beacon, A STORY OF THE SjSA. Br coiojnsii abthtje i. mesebve. It bid fair to be a wild, rough night along] \- the New England coast. t All day the sea had been moaning as though ' in pain, troubled with a wild unrest. As the . Bun went down oyer the cliffs to the westward, i.i V the moaning increased and the sky grew darker. Wild scuds came in from the water, and, tom .; and ragged, went flying away over the storm ' ' ' Beaten cliffs. ■ Half-hidden at the foot of one of them was a rough hut or cabin of stone. So much was it : like the parent rook beneath which it was built that one might paBS it by and hardly perceive it, unless it happened that smoke was curling above its roof. The night'in (potion two men stood in the , .doorway, gazing out upon the water. Both were men of~ upwards'of fifty years of'age. Their garb and tanned faces showed that they were fishermen, toilers of the sea or along the $hore. 1'or some minutes they stood without speak ' : ing, and then he who Beamed a little the elder • broke the silence by observing : VJt is time that I was.off to the light. It Won’t be long before I must have the lamp trimmed and burning.” WMch;oiie, Abram, v £, ‘ “ Wiy,.tnine to bo sure.” ., ... “ Why not try mine to-night ?” i'i /*- ??BecaiUeTsee ho game out on the wafer.” “But you can’t tell what there may be..- In -’Tin hour from how the wind will he blowing i - Ti great guns, and will be justright to throw a ; .alup outbR;*QcTcB.V _ . _: , i .; -i“ I’m afraid to play this game too often.

If they -should come and find* a light out ou yonder crag, while mine was out, as I said before, our -necks .would soon feel the halter drawn about them.” Abram made a motion as though he would \- depart. His boat lay down beneath the cliff, ‘ ' and it would take but a few moments for him to run out to the great rock on which the light ' Chouse stood. ■ ■ ■_ ‘‘’Don’t hurry, Abram. You’ve plenty of tim9 yet. I will go down to the beach: with you as soon as I make everything safe here.” ‘‘ Where’s Huldah?” She went down to the village soon after • : /.noon.

When he and my uncle put their heads together there is'always something wrong.” V Well, we will watch and see what they are up to. If they kindle the false light on the cliffs it will not burn long. If it goes out, then Abram will light liis lamp. As soon as it comes dark, we will see what Sam is up to on the shore. '.We both can run his light for “Edwin, what should X do without you?” she said, as she nestled close beside him. “Esther,'what should I do without you, Euldah, You are the apple of my eye. I hope the time will soon come when I can call you my wife.” With a hand in each other’s they sat hy the window, ever and anon casting their eye3 out over the cliff to where the' false beacon had lured ships to their destruction. All at once a flame showed itself on the rocks. The young man started'to his feet, anil strodo out through the open doorway.■ 1 “Be careful, Edwin,” .cried the voice of Euldah. “Xwitt,” he answered back. Old Sam was bending over the' treacherous fire he had kindled. He had not a thought that a human being was near him, until he felt a hand laid upou his.shoulder and he was thrown violently back upon the rocks. “Villain! What are you doing?” cried the young man. “ People have said that you were a wrecker, and now here is the proof. It would be serving you right if I should dash you down over the cliffs to your death. It would he only serving you us you would the helpless voyager.” “ Have mercy! I am an old man. You have caught mo in my vile act; but don’t turn me over to those who would place a rope about my “ You deserve it: hut for the sake of one deir to me I will keep your crime a secret. But it is on condition that you leave this region at “To-night?” “Yes.” “But Huldah?” “ She will be cared for. Go to Gorling, and stay there until you hear from me. If you haven’t money in tha cabin. I will send you some. Then drop out for ever from this little world that has known you.” The villain slunk away in the darkness, and Edwin went back to the cabin, hat not until he had seen that the true light was ablaze as As soon as the storm was over, Edwin rowed out to the light, and later he reported to the keepers that their man was gone. It was not.loug before Edwin made Huldah his wife, and the secret of the lights was shared between them.—“ Weekly Budget.”
