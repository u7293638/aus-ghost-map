PARU AMENTAR Y GOSSIP. (/>// the Mehapoliloit Cat i respondent (of the I to expect Albion ) London, Saturday, May 25 bison 11) The O Donoghue succeed in his next week's motion for repeal [and half the English and all the Scotch members would be delighted if he did so, especially Cardwell, who confines himself to potato diet, in the forlorn hope of understanding "is incomprehensible Murphy's], and should the army of Pat not Lmeralders be restored to College Green, there can t well be perpetrated a more preposterous parody) on representative institutions than Palace yard now nightly presents , or rather doesn't present, for the negation of everything is the order of all things in this age of advancement, wherein progress itself means retrogression Here is the session already on the wane in point of time, and almost moribund in point of business everything is disturbed, and nothing settled, and the contingency of any sort of settlement involves the certainty of further dislocation of times inarticulate out of court After a week a repose from the labour of doing nothing and undoing every, thing, the Commons of England epitomised in some dozen and a half ciphers and about three units, stroll into St Stephens on Thursday There they listen langwell to one minister calling for more and yet more millions for war purposes, and when he is reminded that this is a unit of peace, up starts another minister, the prime one, of course, always double shouted for Buen explosions, and off he goes to the time that peace is a war-priced commodity, that if we mean to keep the flag of England afloat, we must be prepared to blow everything else out of the water , consequently, the profounder the tranquility the greater the need of readiness for war, therefore, our armaments being positively, comparatively and superlatively excellent, and the chances of their employment correspondingly diminished, it became essential to augment our strength and aggravate our outlay this year beyond the exaggerated scale of all former years in general, and of last year in particular, itself an exceptionally) costly one Well might Bright say that the man who could talk in this way must, as we all know he does, thoroughly despise his audience But there are audiences that like to be despised, and the House of Commons has a chronic craving for that sort of entertainment If it had not, could it have the master it has had all these, years back -one who moulds it and fashions it between his finger and thumb, just as a schoolboy manipulates a penny gutta percha physiognomy , now depressing the head and expanding the mouth into a horse collar grin of comicality and then alternating the proboscis, and elongating the jaw s late spectral cadaxetousnesB enough to frighten a horse from his oats, a Jerusalem pony from his thistles, or M DuChadlu from his gorilla Tiverton logic was such a dead lock on the understanding on this occasion, the reductio ad absurdum vein was so derisively transparent, that a handful of M P 's thought they would enter some trivial protest against it, and accordingly, the) called for a division But the re- joinder was ready before the question was put Bel wether Brand went into the lobby, and shook his tintinabuhstic tingles , whereupon, from the smoke room depths below, and the vapour) sockets above, and tea table tabby twiddle dledom around, the Papered and tadpoles flock rushed out, and tumbled in, and blessed forth yea, and handed out no, as they were Old, without knowing an iota why or caring ajot wherefore and the " pro- fligate expenditure which the finance minister of the government had stigmatised as the main cause of oppressive taxation, was pronounced to be not only a sacred prerogative of the executive, but one the incessant exercise of which gave those practising it additional claims on the gratitude of the nation This sort of thing was repeated three several times in the course of the sitting and then there was an adjourn- ment till the usual hour the following afternoon But the usual near the following afternoon did not find the usual fort) at the usual place What wonder > AMiy should there be forty or four The weather was warm Business would have been a bore had it been a reality and the pretence of doing any would have been such a sham that even the parliamentary conscience, the most Pocksnifhan of all organisms, shrank from the simulation There was no count out, for there was nothing to count, an unaccountable circumstance Probably) in the whole history of Parliament there is no parallel to this -a Friday) night a night of supply, at the end of May, with everything in unprecedented arrear, not a sold for) measure of any kind passed, and the one life and death project of the Government, its finance, menaced with destruction through the systematised procrastination of its opponents, and yet no house" to expedite details b) a single stage ' Whose fault was this Governments Of course but perhaps Government doesn't think it is a fault, nor a misfortune either , but may regard it as a merit and a piece of good luck Nay, that must be actually the case and here B the proof A henry cr gox eminent

mission of such, functionaries to be But here was nothing of the sort Not an official Jack was visible at a quarter to four o'clock, when Mr Speaker went into prayers These being over Sir W Dunbar stalked to the doorway, in the toothpick fashion proper to that pragmatical Pact, butterine overborne by the sudden recollection of Ina stupendous responsibilities as keeper of the privy seal to the Prince of Wales, he walked back again Presently approached Brand, trying to look in a hurry scurry and to make - believe that he was anxious to repair his trial I nets by accelerated activity , - stretching out ' his index finger to arrest the retreat of retiring sera tors from the threshold, impressing on them the fact of its being a supply right ; how necessary it therefore was to facility e the working of the routine machine and so on, and so forth But it would it do Anybody could see with half an eye that these antics were a mockery without being intended to be a delusion, for they deceive no one, much less a snare, as a blind man couldn't have fallen into it Even Colonel Sykes, who is predisposed to accept any excuse that may afford him an opportunity of saying some thing about the Taepings, or anything else, and who look upon a count out as the most calamitous of all possible occurrences next to the disturbance of the Rajah of Satlara'a ghost s grandfather, rubbed his nose

It is this coming that is at the bottom of the Coming Mans consternation respecting the competition between them for if once Gladstone should be premier the Caucasian s career is closed as chieftain of the Commons bush he now is, the dominancy of Palmerston being due not to genius, but to those subterranean agencies a thousand times adverted to here but which it won't do to define, because of the incredulity) he allegation would provoke , though the proofs are multitudinous and palpable to all who have eyes to see, and who went look through others spectacles It was thought that Gladstone would shrink from the turmoil of contention , but, on the contrary, the really combative nature of the man exudes under the pressure from without and vi ullin, in the cabinet and the Commons and he squares at all in the ring like his petite friend in the Iliad, the Lesser Ajax Not meaning finality Jack, for Little John is becoming a very Lambkin of late,-" pleased with a rattle, tickled with a straw, and now about to be led, the Lord [Viscount] knows whither, by a blue ribbon round thaNcg, otherwise the Bedford Career That is, pro vieted he put his foot among the gins genii and other perturbed!

in among the black guardians of the Capitol I his speech of O'Connor has been one of the items of Parliamentary talk out of Parliament all the w cbk, and deservedly, for it was a remarkable performance in every way, alike on account of the matter, the manner, and the man First, as to the last The O'Connor's appearance has been described here before, on his election last year, as successor of his father in the representation of the family county, Roscommon, where the race reigned for ages as sev e reigns here Magna Charta was heard of, and doubtless this genealogical attribute helped to inspire the felicitations heaped upon him at the close of his speech by the Pure Sephardim, author of the "Letters of Runnymede, ' who holds "blood to be first of requisites in all excellence and secondly, that youth is divine " This was the Sidonian shibboleth of the leader of Young England For this he encased that verdant cohort in white waistcoats, and preached the nourishment of high deeds by thoughts of great men But, black, the ancestral oaks of his adherents only typified the timber in their heads, and old nobility songs about the " merry green wood ' merely evoked dismal personal application to the caterwaul- ing sticks themselves It was one of the great ambi- tions of Disraeli s life, and the only one in which he has failed, to have about him young men with brains in their skulls But they were not to be got, and the foxy he did get died ore he could make anything of them For instance, there was the brilliant Canterbury) Smythe, Lord Strangford, who, with a poignant pleasantry of the Historic Fancy kind, bequeathed to the wife of his admired chief his-butterflies ' And then there was Augustus Stafford O Brien also, who might have been every thing if he had taken the trouble to be anything Ben thought he had got a prodigy in the Marquis of Chandos, whose appearance he describes, in the Bentinck Biography, as rising in the crisis of the corn-law debate, like one of the early portraits of Lord Grenville" But we all know that the said noble came to ninepence The young Plantagenet 1 has passed into that stunted middle-aged mediocrity which is the curse of our time, intolerable to gods and men, but not to " columns for if it were not for such, how would the emptiness of newspapers be filled with the nothings that overflow them- Then the " near neighbour of Mr Hampden " fancied he had caught a phoenix in Lord Stanley , but the resi- dam of that capture is ashes and the bitterness of disappointment for Prometheus himself couldn't put ardour into so avoid an ice block But the fire of the desert, to use his own phrase at the D'Aumale dinner, still glows in the offspring of Alrtjy, who is disposed to find a " Wondrous Boy " in any stripling of pro- | mise, and one of promise and performance too he seems to have met with in the yet beardless Don, who looked every inch a king " " Which king, Bezo nian speak or die as Pistol has it King Charle), as sure as a gun There is a thorough Stuart-like aspect in the O'Connor, swarthy, picturesque, can resque, cavalierebque, and all the rest of it, and when a few years old, if he is met by a spirit rapper walking of a moonlight night between Charing-cross and the bottom of Parliament-street, it will be reported, next morning, that the statue of James the Second, at the back of Whitehall [where James' father was permanently cured of headache and the measures with a single tap,] is going in for a competitive examination in the perambulating line, against break-neck II, Blondin, or crack-bone Leotard, or some other professor of that m_n.monke)ism wherewith intellectual Mr. Bull is now so edifyingly enamoured.
