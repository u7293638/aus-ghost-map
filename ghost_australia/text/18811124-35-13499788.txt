AMUSEMENTS. _-? THE THEATRES, &c.; The Pirates of Penzance" is in the last nights of its run at the Theatre Royal, and the final rehearsals of " Patience " are being hold. It may be remembered that some months ago an analysis and description of this latest of Gilbert and Sullivan's works was published in the Herald, and as of late the score and libretto have been on sale at the principal music warehouses, most musical people know by this time that the opera is rather a difficult one to perform well. As, however, the management has revived " The Pirates " with such liberality and good taste, there is reason for anticipating something even better when on Saturday night next "Patience" is produced. "Hamlet" was performed at the Gaiety Theatre last night, the occasion being Mr. Alfred Dampier's benefit, and each lady who attended the orchestra chairs or the stalls was pi roses tied with a photograph of Lily and ROBO as a souvenir. Of Mr. Dampier's unusually effective and care- fully studied Hamlet we have had to write before and it is Mr. Dampier's merit that never since he first appeared here in the part, has had impersonation had to DO un- favourably criticised. Since he last played at which I was a year ago he has improved it by many a subtle touch of gesture, and delicately expressive inflexion of voice, which can scarcely be noticed otherwise than by their effect in enriching and vivifying the conception, as the last few touches of the varnishing brush improve a picture which might have been a masterpiece even before they were applied. He was recalled again and again, and though " Hamlet " is to be replaced to-night by " A Royal Pardon," it is likely to be reproduced shortly. Mr. W. G. Carey was the Ghost, and Miss Marian Melrose Ophelia. At Wilson's circus there was a large attendance at both the afternoon and evening performances.
