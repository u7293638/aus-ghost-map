TO THE EDITOR. Sirâ€”When first I read oar Bishop's proposal to open the service in our pulpits to the various ministers of religion I was much pleased at the prospect of a wider union of the people of Australia, but since reading the effusion of the self-styled " Rev. Bishop Kirby," "who had his licence vears ago from the Holy Ghost, and that licence duly countersigned bv proerly constituted Christian Churches," now see how our Bishop would have to drag his dignity through the mire, and would it be likely that we, an educated and intelligent class of society, would come to sit and listen to such egotistical doggerel as delivered by him on Sunday last at Port Adelaide ? I am, Sir, &c.;, Alix House, South-terrace, June 7. CHARLES HILL.
