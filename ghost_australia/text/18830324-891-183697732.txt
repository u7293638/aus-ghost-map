A &IIOST; LAND LEAGUER. I 7hk London Daily Telegraph exclaim? I— " A new opponent of' Saxon rule' lifts come to the surface in GhilwftT. The ' ghost' of Myles Joyce, one of the Mnamtra-na lutirdel-ers, has taken Up his quarlers iu the county gaol. . The fact must be so, sinCe it ha» been reported, and; what ia more, sent to England by telegraph. To the Irish, of course, (in ordinary ghost iiloro j or lsss is of no impart aiite'; thero ai-o so many in the laud.of the Banshee, the Leprccaun, and j 1 good people' without dumber. JJnt the pre sentment of Myles is a political apparition, who has returned to make life t burden to the au thorities!'. Now Cecil a transcendental pheno menon ft really too formidable. What is to bo , danc? He, or it, cannot be arrested, held.to bail, or imprisoned when he ' revisits the pale glimpses ot the moon.' Over his intangible visibility the Coercion Act lias no power, and lio takes especial delight in vi dating the Curfew clauses. There is nothing .for it but to send down the Psychical r'ociety to rea son' with him. The story goes* that he has already so terrified the matron and warden that they have applied for a transfer to some unhauntcd goal. Moreover, he is not afraid of tho armed myrmidons of tho Saxon, for in the shape of a ' tall,' mysterious figure '—the di scriptiou shows that Myles has grown, in his grave—he not only visited two soldiers on', i guard outside tho prison, but had the temerity to handle their rifles. This is most serious, since there is more than a probability • hateome stolid Tommy Atkii s on duty wil, one of.t.ess nights, test tho nature of tlio visitant, by a homo-thrust with tho. bayonet. The agitators j must be hard' isp when they set afloat such ridiculous gossip among a people prone to superstition; but since our Government lias managed to exorcise the demon of Fenianism, it may fairly be trusted to lay the pbautom of an executed murderer."
