Entertainments. Frame was a large audience at the Minories Hall last night to listen to Professor Pepper's interesting lecture, and especi- ally to have a peep at the ghosts. The first part of the entertainment was devoted to the display of some beautiful dioramic views of statuary, which embraced many of the most admired works of ancient and modern sculptors. Conspicuous among those works of art were the statues of "Night and Morning after Canova, the fine group of Una and the lion, a graceful Venus, and the grand work of art known as the "Laocoon," every muscle in the struggling victims writhing in the serpent's folds being faithfully chiselled by the sculptor. The "Mig dates" and " The Saviour, with angels minister ing to him," were also fine works of art. The whole of the views of the statues y were greatly applauded, and they were followed by the long expected spectral visitants known as " Pepper's Ghosts." The figures presented in these illu- sions must be seen in order to be appreciated, and if enthusiastic applause is any criterion of public approval, the professor received it last night. The beautiful mythological story of "Pygmalion and Galatea" was a charming picture, the marble statue waking to life at the invocation of the artist to the goddess of love, and the final scene, wherein Galatea is again changed to marble at her own prayer, were faithfully rendered and much admired. The second part of the lecture was devoted to illus trations of the polo warfare, which we have previously described, and concluded with "line quo's Ghost," which was a star thing production. To-night the ghosts will reappear, and instead of the torpedoes the picturesque views of Afghanistan and the war will be presented for the last time.
