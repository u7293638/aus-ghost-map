U. S. Ltnr Against Blasphemy. ; ' A man named Reynolds, who ivaa defended by Colonel Bob IngerHoll, has just been fined £5 .'arid £15 costs in New Jersey for blasphemy un der the statute of 1G64 against blasphemy. This is the statute: — "If any person should wilfully blaspheme the holy name of God by denying, cursing, or/contumaciously reproaching His being or Providence, or by cursing or contumaciously reproaching Jesus Christ, or the Holy Ghost, or the Christian religion, or the Holy Word of God H-that is, the books of tlie Old and Now Tesla- ,.thent8 — or 'by profane scoffing nt or exposing them, of any of them, to contempt and ridicule, then every person so offending shall, on convic tion thereof be punished by a fine not exceeding £40, or imprisonment at hard labor not exceed ing twelve months, or both.'' The Judge said that although the statute did originate in colo nial days, it was re enacted in 1844, and allowed to remain when tiie statutes were revised in 1874, and even since tlie indictment the Legis lature had met, and there was not even a sug gestion to repeal it. The decaying value of Scotch sporting pro perty was abundantly manifested in the London Auction Mart recently. The estate of Bunmore, in Argylesliire, was purchased a number of years ago by a wealthy sugar refiner for £200,000, and the other day the highest bid was short by £10,000 of the half of that sum. . The property was bought in. The Deer Forest of Funnich, said to be the oldest in Scotland, was also bought in, the utterly inadequate figure of £44,000 being all that any purchaser was disposed to offer. Twenty years ago there would 'have been keen competition lor the possession of these attractive properties. .
