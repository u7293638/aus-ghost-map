A PAGE OF LIFE IN CORSICA. Life is still romantic in Corsica. A letter written by Madame St. Elmo to La France on the brutal treatment of her husband in prison reads like a page from Alexandre Dumas or Scribe. M. St. Mine tried to start a paper in Cor sica in opposition to the Government. He was thrown into prison, and died soon after.coming out, in consequence, as his friends say, of , the brutal treat ment lie received, though this is stoutly denied. But his life in prison, according’to Madame St. TClme’s showing, was some thiog-like-the prison'life .'of .the people in operas or story books. His post office in all his communications with his family was the-interior of; a loaf of bread; finding that her letters were in tercepted, his wife concealed them in the food she was allowed’ ; to send into' the prison. When this device was dis covered she ‘ carefully bottled them up with his wine, and- this, baffled the jailers ; to the last. From the moment that M. Saint-Elme attempted to found his journal, says his wife, ha was dogged and beaten in the streets, and his life wonld saem to have been a series of am buscades and midnight attacks, It was all in the .strict order of operatic busi ness, only that -at the last Saint Elme tnrnedit ; -into-a : rather y grim~' : reality' by giving up the ghost.
