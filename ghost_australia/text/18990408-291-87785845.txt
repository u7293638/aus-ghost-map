I only dreamed; 'tis sad to wake And find a lonely world in store — '- To hear the beating of the waves Upon a memory's shadowed shore. The ghost of recollection flit 'About the chambers of my heart: \ Once, by yourself, they were love-lit, Before we were so far apart: To-day the skies more brightly gleam, To-day— but hush! — I only dream! If you would come to me beloved — If you would come, where'er you are— Our lives, likes stars, would beam across Time's waves, and show the Harbor Bar, Are they your steps that nearer roam? Is it your face so near to mine? Oh, dearest, God has led you home, And all the clouds with silver shine. Our hapiness is truth, 1 deem; Glad heart, be still— I do not dream.
