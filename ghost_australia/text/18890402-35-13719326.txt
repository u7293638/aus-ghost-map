\- PUBLICATIONS RECEIVED. ' We have received a copy of verses entitled A Bush Idyll, by Kenneth Mackay (Edwards, Dunlop, and Co , Sydney), the perusal of which affords a pleasing relief to the dull monotony of the unhappily accustomed versifier Mr Mackay is already known as the author of " Stirrup Jingles," a collection of pieces which have a good deal of honest colour in them, although the lesson set by Adam Lindsey Gordon is rather too closely followed. But in this Bush Idyll " the writer makes a new departure He gives us a really poetical and certainly very pleasant picture of the perfect woman of ordinary bush life-no over- strained impossible type, but a study of pure womanhood of a kind which readers of this little book will fain believe is not too uncommon in the domestic hen of Australia. The story that runs through the poem like a thread is simple enough , so much so, indeed, as scarcely to merit the name of a story But the writer's aim has evidently been to present a character portrait, and in this he has succeeded to such an extent as to largely Batufy even the critical reader It is the pen portrait of ' A woman girt with tender homelike charms Upon whose forehead truth had set its seal and round the simple tale of this true woman's daily life there is wreathed a scroll of descriptive passages, replete with effortless but effective word- pictures of the everyday life of the bush, and its incidental Characters and colour of glad days, " AS hen round the blaming legs the stockmen Bat, And told the tale of cattle camp And yard, When wrinkled miners drew a thread of gold Across the s ming legends of the past And weary with the dull dead miles 01 bush, The squatr came to taste the joys of home, And listening to this gentle lady a voice Lull back the ghosts of long for gotten years " These last three lines carry a volume of local colour in themselves Further on we get descriptions-' when the horn of plenty ceased its flow "-of such times as when " The drought send lapped with thirsty sun-parched ton guns Each spring and tank and sucked with (shell-like lips The very life-blood from the cracking soil Fire came to blacken earth and mar the sky M lth charred and sable tokens or his v, rath - Undirnmed by miles of smoke his savage o j c3 Gleamed like the outposts of the gates of hell, Loud on- the fall of forests rang his laugh As nature v. clothed beneath his molten breath, nigh In mid-air the waiting eagle swung And watched with scornful ove man's futile fight to save his scorching flocks And so on through a long passage, every line of which is a strong stroke of artistic power It is at such a time as this that those " who with wine-stained lips had bid him hold their lives and fortunes at his beck and call" forgot their venal vows of friendship, and turned from the ruined husband, but she, the woman of this tale, ' placed her hand within his own And w disposed ' We will up and face the storm,' " and, in a noble spirit of true womanliness, stood between him and despair all through the long struggles of adversity, until at length, " E on gaunt misfortune turned Its chargers' heads As though at last it wearied of a road Where those It bruised rose ever an 1 again To meet the onset of its or red wheels ' In this " Bush Idyll " Mr. Mackay has given us a characteristically Australian poem It 19 virile and healthy in its tone, Its colour is true and the treatment of its happily chosen subject highly artistic It is not often we get such manly and heartfelt work from an Australian writer and though there is no straining after effect here, the result is clear and strongly defined. For there is nothing English about Mr Mackay's style in this poem, and nothing impertinently self-assertive, of so many writers of local verse seem to feel themselves, called upon to be His conception of a simple type classic- in its simplicity, indeed is put with an equally simple direct- ness that wins the reader almost before he is aware. On the whole, this " Bush Idyll " is certainly a re- freshing piece of literary work Another passage from the poem will bear quoting, not only for its intrinsic ment, but because it throws light on the water's conception of his subject. It is a parenthetical apostrophe and runs thus " Oh I woman standing on the vasty shore Of old Creation s youngest fairest son he breathe a free-born air that yet will swell The lungs of millions and the sails of the - A God-like task Is yours, for from your loins ' Must spring the builders of a mighty race And Austral s founders as your knees must learn The precepts that will make or mar their work Each nation that has left its name enrolled -* Upon the scroll of fame has also lost This record When his sons had here souls Its women's lives were plain as they were pure, "of But later when enriched with rifled worlds These nations fell before barbarian foe It was because the sons by weaklings born ~ Could not wl hst and the cubs of sturdy dams Therefore ye mothers of our future race 80 shape your lives that in the years to come The world may mark your sons as valiant men 1 " The worst that can be said in the way of criticism about this is, perhaps, that it reads too much like prose broken up into metrical lines The same remark may possibly apply to other parts of the poem but this is one of the dangers of blank v esq The " Idylls as a whole, is so clear-cut and true to a noble type that such technical defects as these may easily be over- looked
