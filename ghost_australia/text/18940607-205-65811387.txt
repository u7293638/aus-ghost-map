SPOOKS OR SPIRITS. tIHOSTS OR GOBLINS. TO THE EDITOR. Stn.-It is with great pain that T, who hitve beeI long resident of Frankston, see that nothing has been done by any of the Melbourne papers, to enlighten the Colony of Victaria on the subject of the Charlatans that have been so long holding in bondage the credulous olnes amongst us respect ing spooks, spirits or supernatural apparitints. Recently we beheld the melancholy spectacle of a learned Divine presiding at an assemblage of persons who professed, apparently, to be in search of truth, and allowing without any attempt at explanation timhe most ridiculous statements to go forth to the public as facts, but which would seem to every thinking man, to be nothing but a display of the most crass ignorance in regard to the natural laws. One correspondent, with a good sense of the ridiculous, ascribed the presence of the ;mmaterial spooks or spirits to one or two kilids of the material ardent spirits. Now Sir. can you not lend a hand to those of us who are trying to think this thing out ? SCIO. [We have noticed how, both the learned Doctors of theChurch andtho Scientists have been very discreetly silent. Why, we know not, but we will lend a hand and will, as soon as possible, g:ve some thing reliable from the very best "Scientific sources available to us." ED. M. S.]
