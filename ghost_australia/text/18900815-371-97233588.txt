ONLY FORTY OUT OF FIFTY BOOKS TO BE FICTION ! To the Editor. — Sir. — If 'Pericles' will only take the trouble to ask the respected Librarian of the Institute the class of books that are mostly in demand by subscribers, ha will ascertain the reply will be 'fiction.' f he will further overhaul the many works that 'adorn the shelves,' appertaining to ' history, science or art,' I guarantee he will find them in a well preserved condition, intelligence' may deplore tbe so-called ' vicious depraved taste' of the library's patrons, their duty is to provide matter of the description sought for, that is, if they wish to promote the well being of the Insti tute. It is unfair, therefore, to place the stigma, if any, on their shoulders, notwith standing -what tbe ghosts of old fossilized Aristotle, & Co., may utter. Aristotle and Plato would be surprised at many things nowadays. For instance, [there are certain societies now in existence that are termed 'Literary*' But the title is a misnomer. They are simply mimic Parliamentary Clubs to inBtil into the minds of precocions youths the vaulting ambition of becoming a colonial M.P, not forgetting the salary. Since the pay has made an appearance these ' Literary' societies have sprung up like mushrooms. English literature is a dead letter with them at their meetings, just as dead as Plato, Aristotle & Co. It is not often I come out of my 'tub/' but it does not require much philosophy to prove that this neglect can be easily remedied. In the one case members of 'Literary' societies are, or should be, all young men and their tastes are not yet educated. With regard to the patrons of the Institute library, I think you will find that the majority have matured tastes and selections, and it is impossible to wean them in tbeir maturity. It does not require much reasoning faculty to discover this 'fact,' as I think old Pericles will agree with old Diogenes.
