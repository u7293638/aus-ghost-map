"HOW SHALL WE DECIDE THIS QUESTION ?" Nov, which it the worte—to have no appetite for your dinner, or to have no dinner for your appetite Y There are lots of people on the one side or the other of this question. When "good digestion waits on appetite and health on both," that is the ideal attitude of a person towards bis meals. But most of ns are not blessed in that way; we either have too much food without an appetite, or a vigorous appetite without enough to satisfy it. Different folk will answer this question differently, yet the common sense of it is that, within reasonable limits, it is better to have an appetite without a dinner, because, short of the starvation line, a hungry man is a healthy man; whereas a man who ought to eat and doesn't feel like eating, stands in need of "alterations and repairs." To illustrate. We recently received a communication in which the writer says, " I was afraid to eat." Did he fancy his food was poisoned, or did his nature rebel against the nourishment lived on? If the latter, why Let liirn clear the mystery himself. He says, " In the year 1889 I changed my work from railway porter to signalman. I had been signalman twelve months, and then all at once, so to speak, I did not feel myself. My mouth tasted bad, so that ordinary articles of diet seemed to lose their flavour; the palate to pub it in that way, appeared to have nothing to say to them. One thing was like another, and none was good. My tongue was coated and furred, with a dark line down the middle and yellow fur round it. My breath was offensive and my appetite poor, with pains through the chest and shoulders, which were always right before I had eaten anything. Then I was greatly troubled with wind. It would gather so it felt like a ball in my throat, and act as if it would choke me." We cannot wonder that under these circumstances our friend failed to do justice to h°s meals. He adds that there was what he calls " a pricking sensation" at his heart, as though it were touched with some sharp instrument. Then, again, at times he was attacked with spasms, the agony of which was so severe that the sweat rolled off him. "I dreaded," he says, "the thought of eating, and many a tcanly meal have I taade, for I teas ajraid. to eat. " After a time I got into a low, weak, nervdas condition, and felt miserable, as if something was going to happen, and this caused me to ose a good deal of sleep." What he means by the fear of " something going to happen" is, of course, the fear of some calamity, such as the loss of his position, his own death, or the death of somebody dear to turn. This was due, as he intimates, to the impoverished state of his blood (the life bearer), his unstrung nerves, and to the brain enfeebled by lack of nourishment. Tbe night to this form of illness is always full of ghosts and goblins, the creatures of a restless and un governed imagination. " With great difficulty," he says, " I strao'i to my work, for I had a wife and family depending on me. So I struggled on, but what I suffered for over two years is past my powers of description. I am sure no one has suffered so much as I have done." In the latter statement he is undoubtedly wrong. One's own pain is one's own, and is always harder to bear than is one's notion of his neighbour's pain. There is a countless multitude who are all the while going through tbe same wretched experience, only we don't happen to come in touch with them. Well, the writer finally mentions that after all medical treatment bad left him where it found him be chanced to read in a book of a case txaclly like his oicn baving been cured by Mother Seigel's Syrup. " My wife," he says, " got me a bottle at Mr. Langstaff , s,,in Wood leeford, and after using its contents the ailmenleft me and has never returned sinoe that fortunate day. I should like the whole world to know what it did for me. I have been employed by the Midland Railway Company for eleven years. (Signed) " GEORGE HUNT, "Car Bottom-road.
