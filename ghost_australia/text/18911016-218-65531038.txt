They had been sitting there for fully a quater o;,aun hour, puuing silently at their cig-rs, the old man staring ini?ront of hiin blankly, coldly, vacantly, the younger man moving uneasily on his chair, casting wistful etnces at his companion, and s.lrumming a tet march with his finger-tips on the table. - "Tell me all about yewreilf,' e'aid the Tinseer on a sudden. "Let's have a fair, s pare look at yewr devil, an' see if -he's as ^l√Ω- as yeyw're painted him.' Tell us ili abort blo~ yew've growed up, afn wh.r yew're grbwed up, an' how vew've come to ibe what yew are. I gaess then Tll know what I've'got The young man hesitated ior a iseaw oments unadtaedle. SIt is perhaps better that you should know all," he said at last with- a beavr-drawn sigh. 'I have told you the worst. The rest of my hstory ~ ha no surprises-of the disagreeable kind at any rate. "1 can remember myself first of all," he con tinued, " a grimy, smudge-faced, half-ragged urshin, running about Front street, St. Louis; diving and dotging about the steamboots on the levee, and pliking up -pieces of wood; bits of iron, and all such rubbish as are 'generally found in similar neighbourhoods, and, carrying them to my mother, who lived in a tumbledown shbanty not far from the railway station.- The steward and cooks of the steamers used to be very kind to me, and many a piece of pumpkin-pie, of moat, and of corn cake I got from them. I remember well how, even at that time the boys of my own age nuod. to shun me, and taunt me with my father being a thief or with my father being in prison. At thattinme I saw ery little of him. Even when he was not in gaol he was seldom at home, and when he was at home our little shanty was a very hell upon earth. He used to beat my mother unmercifully, and went so far as to bring other women into the house. As I grew to years of better comprehension, yoan as I wil, I came to be heartily ashamed o him. A Bautist missionryhad been talking to me on the levee, and I had been going'to the evening school, and there I had learned that it was wrong to steal; and 1 know that it was wrong to steal when one night my father took ume with him and another man on an expedition to break into a house. I could climb like a cat then, and they wanted me to get over a high wall and open a door for them. "I had got heartily tired of being jeered at and gibed at for being the son of a thief, and quite a horror against dishonesty had arisen in ray young mind under the teachings of the good Ila?B ist miesionsrr. So I climbed that wills; bLt when I got on the top I shouted with all my might, and the people of the house were awakened and came out, and my father had to run away vowing rvengeance against me. "Alter that I dared not go home, but -Mr. Casey, the kind Baptist missionary, sheltered me for a few days and nights; and at last he got me a place as suallery boy.on the steamboat Wisconsin, running between St. Louis and Dubuque. All went very well with me for a while. From the post of scullery boy Irose to that of pantry boy, and then to that of cabin boy. The purser took a fancy to me,'and lent me books to read, and when winter came he got me a place on the Yazoo City steamer, running between Vicksburgh and -Yazoo city, and I passed anothersosoon there. . t "ky goodfortune would hlve it that'ondiat boat, I met the Hon. Levi Walker, imember of Congres for Missoiri, and editor of the Kansas CitySt:ar. He offered to make a journalist of me,and I was glad to consent In' his office I rose from one position to another, end all wouldhave been well if, one unlucky day, I had not, in the street, run- acrossmy father. He was unfortunately too well known in the place. He had been tarred.and feathered there, he had been flogged there, he had been -i the chain-gang, he had beena within an ace of beieghanged there. He immediately claimed rorm me the rights which his ties of -afinity gave him. and I had to confess the horrible truth to iMr. Walker. I tried to buy my -wretched father's departure; :but .the?more money I gave him, the firmer became his: resolution to: hang on to me. The people- in Kansas City were very good -to me. . They had had time to learn to -know me and they pitiedme. "Mr. Walker gave me an introduction=to s-veral Cincinnati editors, and I left Kans?e City, and with it my dreadful father. I found immediate and remunerative work in Cincin nati, and I stayed there several years. From Cincinnati I went to Chicago, and on my journey from Chicago to New York you met me. Now you know all about me. -I do not think that I have forgotten anything of im portance." . "'An' ain't yew seen yewr father since then; ain't yew heard from him:' asked Kershaw. "I know of his existence onlythrough the newspapers," replied Underwood. - "They periodically recrd his convictions. Mymother died shortly after my learing Cincinnati, under his brutal treatment, that I know also." " Vaal,'eelaimed Kershaw, "'ifye..ief' heerd from him nor-t a.v ??dM of him." ?-'?l'dbiifi not to be hoped for," sighed the young man. "Ilive in daily- dread of run' aing across him in the setret, of his. calling at Tay rooms, of his coming here.' If the'slightest chance is given him of blackmailing me or you; -he will fasten onus like a leech, and it would be easier to'get rid of a vampire thnis of him." " I've ad to deal with that kindo' man afore to-day," said the frontiersman quietly, "an' they nary once got the best o' me yet" - "dAh," replied the young man bitterly, "it iseasy for you to say that. Not one oi -the scoundrels whom you have come across was your own father. One cannot mete out justice to the man to whom one owes'one's life, and not be soiled by his guilt. The taint clings, one's clothing reeks with it, it poisons the food, it embittoer the drink, it calls up hideous grinning ghosts to haunt your sleep. It turns your honest handiwork into-rebuke, it makes good men's praise a stolen deceit, and all your ife one long reproach. 0 God!" he cried in a sudden agony, "how can I be rid of it? Shall ever be rid of it? I have never felt it as I do at this moment." The old man cast a scrutinising glance upon him, a long lance full of ity. Poar boy !" he muttered. "The sins of the fathers. Poor boy!" Underwood jumped up'on a sadden. - "You' must let me go, Mr. Kershaw,"' he cried. "You really must not try to detain me. Don'tthinkmeacoward; IdonotgotoEurope to run away from him. I go to escape from myself. Ilove your daughter, and I have no right to love her. God knows I have strn;gled, and fought, and contended againmt'nyelf,.

There is no harm donesyet -Ltat me go before itis too late " - - In his heated excitemeht he walked upean: down the room like some frightened,:caed creature, trembling in every limb. - Hegrasped tie decanter that was standing on, the ,table, and pouring out two glasses of water, swal towed them greedily one after theotherd st ii thereby he were able to cool thefever dof' his emotion. - - "Sit down thai," said the millisnaire softly; -ointing to an armchair," audled a bidie'thie over.

A gelios was sitting in the dining-roam, waiting fur the resolt of her father's interview th Enrhbert Underwood. A trifle more anxonus I /thap than athe previous droy, and a shade :,lw,--the tLy fingers twitched a little more \--aaVously, sad wrungthe gauzy cambric hand _erhie irapidly tremnlous agitation. - Once og twice her rocking-chir came very near over. B mal~nI'i ~ I-'-~ balancing itself, so erratic were the yonnglady'o's impulsive movements, and se forgetful was she of har own safety amidst her heart's tumultuous doubting promptings,. She jumped up with a glad cry when ash heard the door .open ups?Jis, ant Daniel Kershaw's heavy footsteps on the lauding. " Where is Mr. Underwood -" she inquired eagerly, when hoe saw that the old man was alone. " He is gone out by the front door, my Angel,' answered the ploneer, pattingherhead, "an' he wants yew to excuse himn.". = SExcuse himr" sherepeated, in a dismayed wonderment. "Excuse him ? Tell me, daddie dear," she burst out coniulsively, " is he going away?".- .. "Thar now, dry yewr eyes," he replied soothingly, "he ain't a-goin' away, not a little bit he ain't. This won t-do at all, yew know. I eayn't have my Angel' aeoryin', aun' a-losiing' her. roses:. Mr. Underwood- not only. ainu't a-goin' away, but he's goin' to be my secre tary, an' yew'll be able to see him every day." how.those hbi- lustrous eyes brightened, and those downy cheeks "dimpled!, She stood on tiptoe, and threw her arms around his neck, and.kissed him for the happy news he had brought her, and a few minutes afterwards she had forgotten all abouther little troubles and the sorrow they had brewed for her and the .dreadful antleipations that. had affrighted her, over the imaginary: woes and Joys of the heroine of the latest novel. Dianiel Kershaw was sitting at the big bow window of the dining-room, looking out into the street. He was not an imaginative man, and had been accustomed to deal with hard matter, of fact in a hard matter:of-fact way all his life. Ready resource, prompt decision, and swift action had been and were his chief characteristics, yet the present emergency :brought a strange indecision- in its way. For' the first time in has life the sturdy pioneer was puzzled, and he was angry. with himself for being puzzled. A contlict of thoughts and memories suread' in his mind, and threatened to interfere with'ia habitual determination. lHe looked upon the street, and the little crowds of passers-by, list lessly, uninterestedly, when, on the olpposite side of the road, he espied a man,. who rather slunk than walkedalong, castingfusrtive glances about him from time to time. , . ie was an old man, a tall man, bent, with broad stooping shoulders. Hie gait was shift-, and his manner shrinking. Whilst looking, m this direction, or in that, as if seekiHg 6ose body or something, he turned his e-,. t:w-iards the window where Daniel Kershades sat,. and thereby gave the latteran opportunety of seeing his face. It was not a pleasart face-thin, haggard, and gaunt, and of an ashen pale. A great scar ran across one cheek, and gave it a nearly villainous look. The eyes, bright and piercing, bespoke a devrley not yet extinct. The 'mouthl was hard, with square set ?jowl, and -yet it was a face which might have been handsome years ago, before manliness was stamped out of it, and ferocity and brutality had writ their mark there; Hlis hair was sparse and white, and a small scrubby white beard fringed his cheeks. His clothing, though not absolutely in rags, was of the coarsest, and an 'unkempt, unshaven appearance added to the general repuleiveness. As Daniel Kershaw's eyes rested on.the man's face, an indistinct, remembrance dashed upon him and gripped his mind. .. "I've seed that man afore,'.' he said to him self, and strove to obtain a better look. .- . The man had slunk on. however, and. was turning his back. A little further down the avenue he crossed the road, and was lost to night. - .. .. Whir have I seed tt an ifre ?" Daniel Kershaw kept asking himself all that morning. "I'm sure I've seed that face afore." ' Whatever work he was engaged upon, whether he were writing, or reading, or rest ing, or. smoking, that pale, ?unshaven face thrustitself between him'and his thougets. It followed him when he went upstairs to his own room,-and it was with him .as he sat down to luncheon. " So pre-occupied wia he, and so moodily ab stracted, that Angelica imagufed. iEm to be .ailing, and was profuse.in her.qOestioning, and in her pretty solicitude: . .. SAfterluncheon he sat hisiiself dodn .b.the window again, andl the sicturo' of that "face flashed across his mind, but not as he had seen it that morning. The white hair was ,iearly, dark' the face brown and robust, but'even more scowling and more' villainous than as he' had last seen it..' . e "I've got it," he cred. 7'I guess I've got it.- I was sure I knowed it. It's Mike Turner =Cheemeface Mike- Hellfirea oe's s pardner!" CHAPTER VI.--O ' T¬∑H.e Powr,. Sleep' was a stranger to. Daniel Kershaw's couch that night. " ie kept.tesing and rolling from one uncomfortable position to the other, now too hot, then too cold, first determinedly closing his eyes and vowing he would neither see nor dream, then opening them wide and staring at the ceiling in the dim light of tse shaded- night-lamp. Gradually his unrest passed away, and although winged slumber came not to him, 'his 'pulsation became more even, and his mind':less:troublos .in its activity ; . ..: , ... "'.. . : ., .

An'" Eli an'. Sam they're both staunch an' true, an' I'd trast.'em: with my life any day. .But .Mike-he.looks harder than ever; he looks as if he'd cut your throat for a dollar. - . -, i! " I guess though,",he continnedif he'll find me a tough card. I settled his parder, an' I'll settle him if he runs.athwart me,; or 'my Angel" .. S?ith the recital of-the-list-.of his quoddani companions, and the recapitulation of the events pertaining to' the-career of each, his power of calm reasoning returned in all its former vigour. The problem of Hubert Under wood's troubles was perplexing enough in its way, and now that villaindus face of Hellfire' Joe's partner added its' mite to the difficulty. Early morning came before the frontiersman could findrest in sleep, having discovered aplai which would enable him to do what was, right, and avoid all trouble to his darlinig. When Hubert Underwood came to' work as usual the next morning, he found both Daniel Kershaw and Miss'Auelica in the.library. " I'm a man as caynt bear beatin'habout the' bush," oaid the millionaire, " an' when I've got to do a thing, I liketo do it an' make'no bones about it. I'm a-goin' to speak plainly to yew both-to yew,. my -nel, an', to yew, young man Come. sit dfn hecar right bmyo side both of yew." , Hubert seated bhmenself'in a hot trepidation. The old man spoke pleasantly. There was nothing td.he feared; .pothing but his own heart. . q"I. guess ysw'ere ibolt ,very ,fond 'n' 'one antteer.,.Tht'sthe.way they.put it in the story book ias a?general rule, isn't it?

'Igueass as it's a country worth seein'," the pioneer went on, "an' it won't do no harm to y Angel nor to me to osee it, in' I propose that my Angel an' myself wego to Yewrup to London, an' tto Coataneinopts, an' to Ieserooalem. an' to Pris, an' to Ireland, an'to lot more places, an' that we stay thr, a year or so, we'll say, an' that yew, Mr. Underwood, oyew come with us as my guest and' as my secretary at the same time, cos I'll want some- i body to do my witines' f or me, oyew kntow.

Lo ved! How poor, how incomplete a word for that holy, untranslatable feeling which made life worth tliving to. him in her young happiness. #His glory, his idol, at whose fistaha 'ould.glidly have expired without'~ an iegrotwithoht a. murmur, without a sigl, everyohar tf .whose head he would have guarded at therice of i his heart's blood. She hid tieiied herself around his being like the slender, verdant ivy around the sturdy oak, closely linked leaf to leaf, not to be parted without hurt to either. His love forher had grown to be part of him, inextricable, inseparable-a blot, a stain upon I the fair open page of her young life would have scorched into his soul, and he had racked his brain for devices to watch over her happiness like the dragon of folklore over the legendary' f hidden gold. l h brave SSgel loved this brave, handsome, young fel!l :v to whom both he aind she were indebted foi the rescue of their lives. Itwasbxit natsiral and in the fit order of thingsthatshe would love him. Itwas the right ordaining of a just' and kind providence. But,novertheless,he feltthat in' promisin to allow, another to share' that wlhich he held most dear, he had left. himself impoverished., Would his Angel love, him,as sh ~oow did when her husband was there .to claim her sunny smiles?. WVhat terrors'lay hidden in that doubt Bat he waspreparedfor the sacrifice';and thouighhis '-olc nigh failed him asohe proposed it, he had never felt calmer than when he had got it over. ..

SUnderwood might yet hov;-e hesitated, but he' Sperceived in the millionaire's plan a hisdom and appreciation of facts of the highest odser. The intervening year might do wonders. It -wee pardonable for him to hope that the dostroyin scythe might perhaps cut short the erimin;l career of his terrible father. Who knew? ;. moment might bring a happy release. If Angelica Kershaw and he got marlied in Europe, they were rich enough It:rlive there until such time as a return of his bogey was no longer to be dreaded. Daniel Kershar wavs right, and the young man felt ever so grateful to him for having provedthat he himself bhad beenwrong. - When they were alone,'when for the first time they could unburden their heartsto one another without restraint, without fear of misunder. standing ; when they could unafrightedly bask in'the sunshine of their mutualbappiness, bri. ful of the joy,ofto-day, of their glowisn hope of the future; when they could sit quite c?dose to -one another and drink deep draughts of glad peace, in one another's eyes, and could vow hand in-hand, each to the other that theywould never, never change, nor in this :world, ?tir in all eternity ;.they forgot all about the arrange mente for the proposed journey, and neither of -them as much as cast a thought upon such very mundane matters as steamer tickets, frocks, and like necessities.. ,No happier young man lived that day in ianhattnn City than HIuthrt 'Underwod, es ac he sat in the tram-mar that was taking him'to the office of hispaper down town. fle~alighted at Union Square, the slightly oscillating'move ment becoming tedious to him, and w'alked swiftly. along Iroadway; glad to' expand his cheat and d6. move his linbs; as' safetyva lve forhis buoyant excitement. .. \- The long walk from Uion, SqlUre. toi City iHall Park seemed but a dozen'.varcls, eo na-; conscious was he of the distance tVraersed: \- He was siinoing aleong; blithly 'aroesithe Pork toiwards the Spruce street 'entr?ne; not far from, which'the offide' of his paper "was situated,- when he jostled against a'white-' i haired, white.faced' old, man,- iwith: a short, Sscirubby aspect, rho'elbowed him'aside roughly, with a curse.,? - .- .. :. - t . , fa The youngd an was far too happy, however, -to be irritated by trifles.
