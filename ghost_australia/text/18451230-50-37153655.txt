A -wedding- ring and a licence aro things .almost dog-cheap i but,; oh, grandmother ! ?what a lot, of money it tnkos to break that ?ring — what a heap of cash to tear up the licence; and that's tho reason that divorco, like green poas at Christmas, can only be -afforded by the rich. Next the Bishop had ji fling at what ho called ' tho unhappy beings M'ho wont to Mechanics' Institutes iMid lecture-rooms.' Ho said they wanted j '. the discipline of the' heart and the chasten- ! ?ing influence, of truo religion. I'm an ignorant cabman, grandmother ; .but if so many ' millions,' as the Bishop said, want this, — I must ask, what do wo pay the ?Church for? If so many of us are no better, as Exeter said, than ? any of the wildest savages who devoured one another an New Zealand,' for what, in tho name of {Sounds, shillings, and ponce, do we pay Church rates? Why don't the Bishops and the high preachers of tho Church come* more among us? Why, thinking of tho ^Apostolical succession,' do n't they copy, more than they do, the fishermen and tent-, makers who are their forefathers?' 1 can 't help asking this; though, us i said, I know 1 'in an ignorant cabman. - ' ? ?; i-vd 'The Bishop, however, after scolding a! good deal, tried to end mildly and like 'ii' .Christian.
