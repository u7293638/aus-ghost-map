Let me explain what StSneMi. If I am deeply moved by the greatfShw and glory of God, my emotion easily Ramies-with it-a temporal natural feeling of ^fawe'aiid solemnity like that which is prod need by loneliness, as in the silence of the moun- W' •'.tains^by the magnitude of the ocean, by the ^ atilln^sand awe of some great building. If ' Ijun filled with joy by the love of God, the jpy easily carries with it a certain natural loojWiioy like that produced by ;the bright shnshine, by the blooming of flowers. By the ^'-•sorrow for ain in the presence of God there is Wii feeling naturally created like that whioh L>7* comes from listening to pathetio music. A |j»mere natural emotion may be produced by not coming into contact with God at all.

Iwioyancy, the animation created by the J>';«ervice itself apart from any joy in God's love, 'in that buoyanoy and animation there be no worship. In listening to pathetio !*;• prayers or pathetic mnsio there will be created i certain pens!veness like that which comes from deal sorrow for sin, but if the pensiveness i* produced by pathos the prayer or mwiou not a reality between a penitent BOUI and God. My fear is that theib are large numbers of f persons who mistake emotion produced by .exteraal and natural meanB for worship in . spirit and truth. You think that you are bowing with reverence to God in the servioe that yon are taking part in, tbe_ impressive servioe, the great congregation in a noble \- building. Is it the service that oreates solemnity, or is it God that oreates it? Test that question. God is near to you . in the •qnare white-washed building, with a small congregation, where there is nothing to , jnake.the service outwardly impressive. Are "yoti fiUed with God and solemnity there? ' !£ptl*hfnk your religjuus joy is culminated whehtbe service is stimulating and exciting, ^ when tdbere is a band, when there is fire in the Bioghlg.

Byi$he services in which il-'^Euf'an all these natural -timnlants .: Jf ou ihiok yoa b*Te l^id » visitation of devout •m emotion, when you have been much moved by pathetio music or pathetio prayers. Perhaps you have, but teet it. Do these influences come to you—influences which sometimes touoh ana move the most irreligious and the most immoral man in the congre^a- , tion as deeply as they touch the most saored ? As to forms of service, the music to contribute to this mere natural emotion is a question of extreme delicacy and difficulty. The consummation of that question is dependent upon the oondition of the differentChurches at different times, bat we need to discourage emotion by unlawful and impressive services as unnecessary to spiritual worship. To encourage emotional and very impressive services is almost certain to lead to fatal and ruinous adoration, in whioh natural emotiou is mistaken for real worship of God. In one of the late Matthew Arnold's works he deals with this fundamental error. He takes it for granted that worship ought to be impressive. He says, "To make worship impressive in its external manifestation, its song, the splendour of its observance. Let this holds its way through all outward end inward life. Publish it in pong and splendour." Strangely these words contrast with our Lord's account of the only worship that God cares for. The true worshippers shall worship "the Father in spirit and truth." The error is fundamental, the assumption that worship is intended primarily to impress men. In prayer I appeal to Sod. To please Him I must think of Him, of His infinite grace, of His eagernnss to help me; I must think of obtaining His blessin?, not of how my prayer may imDress those who bear it. In tbanksgivins I am praising Him for His goodnees; I must think of Him not of how my thanksgiving will impress the people who hear it. In adoration I shall be lost in the vision of His glory. If I begin to think of how my adoration will impress other men it ceuses to be adoration. I daresay acme here will remember that it used to be a reproach to use extempore prayers that we sometimes addressed to the congregations rather than to God, when the minister thought of the people rather than of the King. To whatever extent that is true the prayer ceases to become adoration; it becomes a sermon, and to whatever extent this idea of making worship impressive is carried it bBoome liable to the same reproaoh. If intended to impress people by ita awe and solemnity the pathoB ceases to be worship. Worship is then worship only in form and in name. It is intended simply to impress those who witness it, those who take part in it. Its work and value is determined by the depth of impression it makes on those who take part in it. Let those of us who believe in the worship of God see that the worship bo directed to Him. The impression it produces on the mind is therefore secondary. Puritanism, in its austereness, mistook passiveness for reality. In their lofty vision of the greatness of the Eternal they were led to suppose they were worshipping God when they were only filled with emotion. If natural emotions which are akin to spiritual acts may assist to proveke those acts, there is something perilous in the direction of powerfully stimulating the natural emotions when we are engaged in Christian worship. Firstly, we should not discourage holy and invisible exertions to worship. Secondly, to prove that the real spirit is really full of reverence and trust and joy oreated by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and by direct oontaot with God. There is something perhaps of exaggerated regret in the temper in which we are apt to look book on the great times which.are gone, but there is some truth, I fear, which, we are all quite prepared to acknowledge, in the difference of spiritual depth between our own life and the lives of onr fathers.
