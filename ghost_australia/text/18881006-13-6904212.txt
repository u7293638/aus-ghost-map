THE STAGE AS A MEANS OF CULTURE. By W. LEWERS. The following is the address delivered at the annual meeting of the Trinity College Dialectic Society in the Athenæum-hall:— Mr. Chancellor, Ladies, and Gentlemen,— You have possibly heard a story of two strangers entering casually into conversation in a crowded ballroom. The first, looking very much bored, said, "This sort of thing is awfully slow; let's go outside and have a drink." "Well," replied the other, sadly, "I should like to, but I can't very well get away. You see, I'm the mun that a giving the party." ,'J he moral of tins little story lies ill the application thereof I atncertlj hope that beiore I can finiahjou maj not have experienced the feelings ot Stranger No 1 I, like the Reconu individual, can t verj well get away, being the unfortunate prelector whoa giving the partj. It has been the custom nt these meetings to choose a subject more intimately connel ted with University life, but I have the precedent of the excellent prelector of hist jeur fur honouring that custom in the breach The number oi purely University topics that ate nt the same time interesting to laymen is not large, and those topics have been ¡n previous vears fully treated bj my predecessors in olhce. I need scarcely add that an exbaua live treatment of the aubject, even were the ability present, would be impossible in the time at my dispoail At the most, I could only hope to throw out a few auggeationa I ahull endeavour not to discourse, like Gold- smith's joung lady, on Shakspeare and the musical glnasea, and vv ill be more than e ltia lied if I eucceed in keeping mj oratorical bark nailing in the current between what Swinburne would call the Si v Ila mid Charybuia of paradox and platitude. Imitation is instinctive in mun from hin infancy To the gradual development of this imitative facultv minj students oflunguige attribute not only gesture, but the power ot «peech itselt Be tutu us it may, the evolu ttoti of dramatic art could be predicted upon the same principles, mid with the samt cer (anny, a« the evolution of the human niture which it emiiodies 1 ravellers Have nott d among the South Sea Islanders the existence ol some rude form of theatric ii perlorm.itice.s, and Rider Haggard has lately given us specimens of the poetic lmacery and fine dramatic ínstincta oi the Zulus. lhe most seductive sport of childhood is to reproduce in play the heroes of the story-book, mid to become at will n king or queen, a giant or a horse Actiun consist» ot two parts-the operation or exercise of the will, and the attempt to carrj out its resolution Hie drama baa its beginning whenever one action ia imitated hi another, and so soon as tlie elements of difteretit mutations are com bmed together into one consecutive whole it must be regarded as an nccomplishc I fact. Consequently, the drama, if not the earliest developed of the fine arts, brings us back to a very remote antiquity, 1 he Hindus have beqiuathed o atage litera- ture whose nobler productions ure instinct with poetic beautj Lvi u the Chinese, who at present supply Hie neceasiirj elenitntof patriotic melodrama to tile Australian polia cmn, ure enid to possess a theatrical morality almost as high na our poll tax The penal code of the empire enforces a virtuous aim in their plays, and Chinese Zolas are taught to look forward after death to it purgatory which will last as long as their immoral plays continue to be performed But the greatest nation of antiquity, and that which, therefore, perfected the drama and made it supreme among the fine arts, were the Greeks. Whatever it owed to outside influence, the progress of the Greek stage was carried on in close connection with the popular religion The worship of natural powers, whereby even the gods themselves were mere earthly beings stirred by human passions, led to a full development of the artistic faculty, In less fortunate countries, where nature cannot teach the charm of beauty, where instead of harmonies of con trast beneath a sunny sky is found only gloomy mountain and and desert-this very worship clouds or kills the imagination alto gether. Instead of reproducing natural shapes its idols become distorted creatures of the fancy, and man beneath its sway is made a monster, hard, cruel, and un natural But the Greeks, endowed with physical beauty and right sensibility, and favoured by circumstances, brought to perfection the poetry of religion That religion was a religion of the senses only ; the after life was a reproduction of the present : its ideal was not higher than that which could be attained by man himself Among all the Greek gods, Dionysius was perhaps the most human The god of festi- val and pleasure, he was the sworn foe to all that could dull or darken the mind of man From the vintage feasts in honour of Diony aius arose both Tragedy, originally the satyr song chanted by bands of worshippers arrayed in goat skins, and probably also Comedy, the same song from a different point of view-the village chant of the rustic revellers. The modern theatre can give us no idea of Greek tragedy. A combination of drama and church service is perhaps, the most sugges tive description The plot was simple, and treated a story of history or legend well known to all the spectators The perform ance took place in an enormous building In tho open air, there was no chango of scene, the actors wore masks to raise the voice, and little or no action was shown upon the staue The older drama of tin» Greeka la the chief product of one ot the brightest epochs of the world As a means of culture the Greek stage cannot be over estimated If we conaider the influence its masterpieces have since exerted over students of every clime, we may form some faint idea of what its powers must have been among the Greeks themselves The aim of tragedy was, as Aristotle tells us, to effect a purification of the passions by means of pity and terror, The dra- matist himself became directly both critic and teacher In the chorus the audience found their common emotions expressed, but at the same time refined and idealised by the poet's conception Again, in comedy the power of holding up current society and politics to ridicule before thousands of people corresponded very nearly to tho power wielded by lim public press of to day The more complex civilisation of later times with the loss of the old political free dom gave birth to comedy as we now under stand it-the comedy of manners Instead of creating a fantastic ideal of human nature wherein personal satire was practically without limit, the new comely approached more nearly to a photograph of certain phases and ' complications of everyday life 'This was the nature ot the later Greek drama borrowed and given to Rome by many writers chief of whom are Plautus and Terence Whatever the faults of coarseness and incoherence of plot in his work, in comic situations nnd elaborate character drawing, Plautus has hardly been surpassed It must never be for- gotten that his were the plays " understanded of the people.' Consequently, for any literary taste or refinement spread among a popu- lace, whose amusement consisted almost wholly of spectacle and show tho drama is mainly responsible The poems of Virgil and Horace were written in a metre, indeed, in a language as foreign to the ordinary citizen as is the work of Robert Browning or Walter Pater to the great unwashed of to day The comedies of Terence also preserved in monasteries throughout the middle ages, serve to connect the ancient with the Christian drama In the reign of Constan tine the stage which had degenerated into the lowest pantomime, banned by the church, practically ceased to exist Dramatic art had succumbed to the grosser passions which craved the bloody spectacles of the arena The religious drama consisted of 'mysteries,' the subject of which was chiefly the mystery of the Redemption, the "miracle plays dealing with the legends of saints, and " moralities in which virtues and vices were personified Thus by means of the stage the principles of Christian faith were presented in attractive and intelligible form to the un educated, to whom reading was an unknown art Gradually, however, the religious element was restricted to the church, while the drama increased in comic "busi ness," the devils and their chief being prime favourites The virtues and vices of the morality were soon found to lack human interest and interludes were inserted from which may be traced the growth of English comedy. Meanwhile the influence of the Renaissance was being felt throughout Europe, and the Elizabethan age was made memorable for ever by the birth in 1564 of one William Shakspeare Unfortunately, time will not allow me to touch upon the influence of the drama as part of the Renaissance in Italy, France, and Spain Spain, indeed, now pos sesses its drama, almost as the sole and greatest relic of a nation once supreme, and the names of Lope de Vega and Calderon rank second only to Shakspeare The tragedy of the Greeks and the Shakspearian or romantic drama are the extremes of the highest art The key note of the former was the struggle of man endowed with freewill against a relentless destiny. Its simplicity of structure is like to a pure melody in music Shakspeare, on the other hand, presents an minute harmony. The French school, fol lowing the Greeks, insisted on the obser vance of what are known as the unities of time, place and action The action should be represented us happening within the space of 24 hours Their procedure reminds one of the Chinese shipwrights, who, being com missioned to build a ship on the model of one that had been destroyed by dry rot, pro duced a copy so exact that it included the dry rot itself. Every drama must have unity of action insomuch that its action tends to one issue, but a single action in this sense may include numbers of events The unity of time and place, even had they been observed strictly by the Greeks themselves, were suitable only to a stage upon which was represented a simple heroic legend without change of scene. The result of this self imposed re striction has been to make the characters and diction of a poet like Racine stilted and untrue to history Shakspeare chose rather to violate the so called rules of art than lose the inspiration of nature. His work has been compared to a landscape in which the spectator sees clearly the objects close it hand, but is ever attracted onward to discern some beauty beyond his ken. So it charms alike the near sighted and the intellectual eye of wider range. It reflects, like all true art the noblest thoughts and deeds of the time, while it dis cards everything that is ignoble. Upon the stage the history of the past and the history of the present were taught, for Shakspeare's plays were written for the stage. As with the Greek drama, the eflcct of the poet's genius upon his own time can be guessed by the sway it has exercised over giants and men ever since. Heine tells us that Shakspeare is the intellec tual sun which illuminates England with its gracious light. Carlyle affirms that it was a right blessed thing Shakspeare was born to this earth. This is the tribute of the greatest woman-poet to the greatest poet of all time : "There Shakspeare, on whose forehead climb The crowns of the world ! Oh, eyes sublime ! With tears and laughter for all time. Such was William Shakspeare, play actor, and writer of plays The suppression of the theatre by the Puri tans dealt a blow to dramatic art, the after effects of which were most disastrous to the stage An act passed in 1647 declared all actors rogues and vagabonds who were to be pub licly whipped for the first offence, while all spectators of plays were to be fined 5s The result of this attempt of ignorance and bigotry to dam an ever-flowing stream might have been foretold In the reaction at the Restoration, from the gloom and misery of Puritan tyranny the stage ran to the wildest excesses, and served as a mirror of the most licentious period of our history Henceforth the divorce of the theatre from nature became more and more marked, and the literary merits of the drama steadily declined If ready to take a pessimistic view, one could say with Stopford Brooke, that with Sheridan the drama as a literature comes to an end. A partial explanation may be suggested in the growth of a rival to the drama 'The dramatic fire still burned bright in men, but since nature was burned from the stage it has found other means of expression in the novel Those who possibly might have become great dramatists have become our great novelists Goldsmith united in himself tho kindred forms of art, but no later dramatist has rivalled the Shakspeare of the novel, Walter Scott. Far be it from my intention to detract in any way from the power and charm of the novel, but it must be evident that it cannot touch the emotions or appeal to the unimaginative mind as would a stage representation Its principles are not the same 'The drama is essentially action— men's thoughts as witnessed by their acts. The novel is not necessarily so. George Eliot, in many respects the greatest of novelists, presents us in Middlemarch or Daniel Deronda with it dissection of character almost anatomical , every motive and im- pulse is laid bare But we never know any character in real life so well, and on the stage we see, or ought to see, characters in much the same way its they appear in real life What, then, is the position of the actor? By that term I mean him who follows acting as an art Just as an oyster, a whale, and a lobster are known as " fish," although pos sessing no more title than ourselves to the name, so the dramatic artist the music hall singer, and the ballet-girl are all equally "actors" The first-class has its home in the water the second behind the foot lights The evolution of the stage has not yet reached a point of develop ment when a further specialisation must be made But the art of embodying the poet's creations, or as Macready expressed it, of comprehending the thoughts that are hidden under words, calls for endowments not less than those of the poet himself The actor must conceive the character anew. When a really great artist interprets a really great part The audience' is presented, ui it were, with a twofold inspiration of gentua Thus it is no ideally perfect representation of Shakspeare could be given until there came an actor endowed with the genius of Shakspeare Mr Irving, for instance, can portray an ideally perfect Louis XI or Robert Macaire because his intellect is pro I biblj more commanding than the author's but not a Hamlet or Macbeth before which every knee must bow Macready when per forming Hamlet for the list time, said regret fully that he was only beginning to realise the sweetness and tenderness of the character Hence, as in every other art, the actor must be a diligent student Hie greatest efiects are produced by careful thought and study Diderot has asserted in bia famous paradox that the actor must never feel Only list year the discussion upon this waa re vtved and Diderot a canons fully endoraed by a famous French comedian M Coquelin would maintain that the actor has it dual per sonality so distinct that even in the most tragic scenes, when drawing tears from the audience, he should be able at any moment to laugh in his sleeve. Mr Irving, Miss Terry, the Kendnls the lite Mr Clayton and in fnct the English school generally have given thtir opinion n"aui8t M Coquehn's view No doubt the greatest efiects are produced bv careful preparation, but it »eems certain that there nre supreme momenta when the aoul of the actor is stirre I by feeling, and actor and audience ure Kindled as by un electric spark li maybe objected that the nctors art is ephemeral ne more than all mankind struts mid frets his hour upon the stage, and then ia heard no mor- But has the vagabond Garrick lived in vain when it is recordid by Dr Johnson that bi his death the gaiety of natlona waa eclipsed ' During a debate m 17ö8 to lura alone was allowed the privilege of remaining in the stringer a gallery on the motion ot Edmund Burke and Charles Tox , and the most prominent place in the Poet'a Comer of Westminster Abbej is now hia tomb At a lienefit to Mrs Abincdon a company, including Reynolds, I ox, Sheridan, Gibbon, Boswell, and Malone, oaaemtiled to do her honour, mid Reynolds our greatest portrait painter, saul that bj puttimr bia name upon the hem ot Mr« Siddrns' garment he had acliit ted immortality It seems to me tnat I can best illustrate, the rt lining power of the actor'a art by a bnef survey ot the effects produced upon their time by bj gone heroes ot the stage In the 'Jallei Steele records the wonderful ngonj of Uetterton as Othello when he ex iiraiiied the huudkerchiet He remarks that one reading in his closet this admirable scene, will lind that he cannot, un- ites possessed of us narin an imagi notion as Shnkspetru himself, find any but drj, incoherent, un 1 broken sentences , but a reader who baa seen Betterton act ob serves that tuerc could not be a word added Hear, again, Dr Doran, on the authority of Pepys-" The fops stand erect in their boxes to show how folly looks in clean linen, and the orange nymphs, with their costly enter tainment of fruit from Seville, giggle and chatter aa they stand on the benches below, with old and young admirers, proud ot being recognised, in the boxes Hie whole court of Denmark is betöre them, but not till the words' lia not alone my inky cloak, good mother' fall from lhe lips of Betterton is the general ear charmed or the general tongue arrested Then, indeed, the vainest fops and pertest orange girls look round and listen too 1 he voice is so low and sad and Bweet the modulation BO tender, the dignity ao natural the crace so consummate, that nil yield themselves silently to the delicious enchantment.

It is re- production, not mere material imitation. Take, again, Millais's portrait of Gladstone in the Exhibition, possibly the great English stnt-eman never at any one moment looked precisely like the picture But the artist has contrived by Btudy ol the mun to expresB his character, it, therelore, is the true portrait, while a mere photograph-the exict repre- sentation of the features at one particular instant-ia untrue, j hua it is that Dickens Ins always seemed to me superior to '1 hackera. Thackeray is, indeed, a photo- grapher that llattereth not, but Pecksniff, Micawber, and the hundred other characters ot Dickens ure creations, of which we may find a type, though not nu exact representa tive, in any age. Once more, Cleopatra or Macbeth never talked in blank verse Yet we feel that Shukspeare's use of blank verse is the only possible method ot bringing ade- quately before us the attributes ot uwe and majesty The some thing possibly never appears the same to two people genius alone can discover the eternal truth visible to all Now, we may see how the stage is a picture of human life Art is not life, as Goethe said, it is first of all art, and then the reflex ot nature 'Tragedy and comedy are respec- tively the sad and amusing pictures reflected. Tragedy may degenerate into melodrama, mid comedy into farce 'The subject matter of tragedy and melodrama is much the same, but as I understand the latter, it differs from tragedy by harping, as it were, upon one string It rcpreients the characters and action us exhibiting and being affected by one passion, to the exclusion ot all other in- fluences, and lacks further the poetic treat- ment which gives to all the passions of tragedy their just balance mid proportion, throughout the working of the must intense passions the human element is preserved in tragedy, the murderer or villain of melo drama is a one sided gentleman, fortunatcly unknown to us off the boards A purely melodramatic character is one that I behove WOB interpreted last year in Melbourne-that of Lucho, the miser, in the "Aululana" of Ilnutlis lu th tt play Plautus has either borrowed or created a ty pe-a man actuated solely by avarice. Moliere has copied not onl v the character, but much of tlie languuge, for the "L'Avare," but by the introduction ot love and other passions he has made Ilaipiigon distinctly human Consequently Harpagon is represented more nuturully upon the stage, for Lucho is developed as it were upon one side, our medical friends would cull him a hémiplégie character. It ia there- fore very difficult to embody the author's creation, and at the same time avoid the appearance of gross exaggeration. But though always to this extent unreal, melodrama at its best yields an emotionul entertainmeut, from which legitimate enjoy- ment may be derived. 'Hie best plays written of late years have been of this species, we ere bta-.es and Uko to take our nips of ex- citement " neal " Good specimens ure the "Lights o'London" and "Hie Silver King," which in spite oi much tedious fustiun and rubbish have yet a large share ot poetic reality. "Jim lhe Penman" ia an example of society melodrama of merit, and Melbourne was fortunate in seeing in the pc-rlormuticc ol Mr St. Maur a stuuy simply penect of its kind. Mr St Muur lias the true artist's in stinct of never intruding his personalty upon the beetle, au instinct windi he and artists like Mr Brough, Mr Uo.ce, Air Titheradgeand Mr. Boucicaultobeyeven inbroad farce ' Human Nature." " Youth," " A Run of Luck," and plats ot that type, recommended by worthies as great moral lessons preached from the stage, are about as valuable us the patent medicines mid pills which derive teslimo mais trora similar quarters. Without any literary merit, they may be tlescnbed us u nightmare of mechanical effects and com- monplace situations, wihch fulfil no dramatic purpose " What is realism ? was wittily answered by Punch, "a real cart driving down a painted street." Such is the vulgar realism of these plays, the very realism that constitutes their unreality 'The real events and objects crowded on a few feet of boards behind a few jets of gas, simply call attention to their utter incongruity Scenery should be indicative and suggestive, for the scene upon the stage is true only in imagina non. Very different is tho artistic realism as em ployed by Mr Irving und others solely to de velopo the purpose of the play. It then becomes one of the most vuluable props upon winch the mirror is held up to nature Those who carp may tell us that in Shakspeare's day the only wealth of scenery necsssury was a board inscribed "This is a street in Venice " As late us this century the stage was lighted by oil lamps, and if the actor got out ol the ring or focus be could hardly be seen A story is told that on one occasion after]. I round Kean had playcd Othello with unwonted energy,a friend congratulated him, remarking that he thought Iago would have been choked. Othello seemed so tremendously in earnest "In earnest" was the reply, "I should think so ' The fellow was trying to keep me out of the focus'" 'those who sneer at realism must remember that to soar to -day we need not only wings ready made, but actually fitted on to our fancy. The same principles we have considered in tragedy and melodrama muy be applied to comedy and farce. 'Hie delineation ot character may bo studied at home in the novel and romance, lhere is no doubt that to day the greater number of ueople go to the theatre to be amused, und uinuBement pure uni simplets the object of larce lu the- "Critic' Mr Sheer's friend decides that tlie follies and foibles ot sociel) ure subjects unworthy of the comic muse, and writes a coinedv on a new plan called "The Relormeil llousebreuker," where by the mere loree of humour liuusebretiktng is pul into so ridiculous a light, that hu expects bolls and bars to be useless by the end of tlie season lu furce, the key-note from which the plot is evolved u either nu imposai bl li ty or at leastsouiething extremely improba ble But starting from this impossibility, the development ot the plot should be ii strictly natural sequence Hence we can distinguish good turee like "TIm Candidate' or ' The Magistrate" from the stupid bulloonery and hoi se play ot pieces like " '1 he Private Seeretarv " or "'lhe Barrister' Ot pence,, farce, the best examples I can recall aro 'The Comedy ot Errors" anti "'lhe Critic " Now let us look at tho flickering rn)s emitted irom the lamp of burlesque 'Hie popular conception ot burlesque necios to bo .omewhiit similar io that quoted at Mr Montui'ii 'ligg's dinner party, "What's tho legitimate object of the drama, l'ipv Human nature Whnt ato legs' Human nature." 'Hie two élusses of stuge productions which at the present time rejoice in the title of bur- lesque, are on the one bund pieces like "Miss Esmeralda" mid " Monte Christo, Junior, ' und on the other comic nusrepresetations of popular plays such us "Silver Guilt " The first is extruvuguii/a or spectacle, the second travestie. Doubtless both are entertaining in their own wa), but neither can be regarded as proper examples of true- burlesque Are such examples to bo found ? I think so. Some of the most perfect specimens of this species of composition are to be seen to-day in the so-called comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. I shall startle many by placing these works under burlesque, and shock more by classing W S Gilbert with Aristophanes. I do dot mean to suggest a rival to the greatest comic genius of the classics or to compare ideas and states of society that do not admit of comparison Looking at the work of either solely as dramatic pro ductions and apart altogether from literary beauties, the principles of workman ship will be found similar in one respect. Beings natural and supernatural, to whom we are wont to attribute the loltiest and most awful attributes, are shown to us by Aristophanes to be actuated by the same petty impulses and mean motives as our- selves Our enjoyment consist, in the ¡neon gruily The dramatic personal are repte sented in situations not altogether discordant with their historical character, but they think and net in a manner wholly lmpto bable.

No doubt the effect would be ludicrous, but if we substitute for the Lord Chancellor a footballer, a bishop, or a burglar, the result would possibly be the same There ia no necessary connec- tion between the office of Lord Chancellor and a perambulator But when, as in "Iolanthe," we lind that dignitary, solemnly expatiating to the assembled peera on the feelings ot a Lord Chancellor 111 love with a ward of bia own court, mid afterwards hearing Slrephon'n confession of love m strict accord ance with the proauic rules of evidence, the humour is consistent lu ita absurd wconsis teucj, und our enjoyment is proportionate!) keen.

One of their chiei merits ia that 111 none of these operas can there be found the faintest suggestion of vulgarity or indelicacy. The dialogue is almost always brilliant, and some of the lyrics, as, for example, the song of Mad Margaret in " Ruddigore," arc full of beauty. While the intellect is satisfied the eje is charmed by the harmony of the scene ; and the costumes, such as those of the fairies in "Iolanthe" or the students in " Princess Ida," are alone an education 111 the reathetics of dress Another important trait of Mr Gilbert's work is that, just as in comedy or trjgcdj, each character must be pi a j ed aenouslj, na a vital, part of a compact whole It theiefore requires for us interpretation a much higher class ot acting. In the produclion of "Princesa Ida" last vear the rich humour of the second act was almost lost by Billy and incongruous buffoonery on the part of the three men who penetrate into Castle Adamantin the disguise of lady students. Those who have seen Miss Leonora Braham recentlj ns Yum Yum, Phyllis, or Patience will realise how charm- ingly the author's meaning can be brought out by refined and intelligent comedy-acting The slightest "gag" or gratuitous fun thrown in on the spur of the moment entirely spoils the piece, where in the so-called burlesque such gag is not only allowed but constitutes the chief attraction Miss Nellie Turren and Mr. Fred Leslie are artists of verj remarkable powers, but the «lyle ot composition they interpret at present ia dis- tinctly low in art, und exceedingly cheap in effect. But perhaps more than in any other way the stage lina benefited mankind by further- ing the spread of instrumental music, and by the invention of the musical eir tinta. Music, unlike uny ot the other urta, appeals directly to the emotions When listening to music our "eelings ure often stirred unexpectedly to I heir verj depths without uny conscious in- tellectual eil ort, suchas is implied in obtain itu knowledge.
