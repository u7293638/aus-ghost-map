U0OSB.LSE Iff AUSTRALIA. A trackless forest all around Of loft; gunvs that from the ground As saplings sprang in agea past :â€” The short sweet twilight fadetb fast, And from the forest depths I hear The locust's whirling noise, the clear Soft magpie song, the sudden scream Where cockatoos like white ghosts gleam Among the melancholy boughs, Tbe wild dog's barks from where there browse Stray herds of kangaroos, the cry Of something death-struck As I lie And listen to these sounds I see Long moonbeams pierce a lofty tree. Like random lances thrust to kill Some fiend who baffles ail their skill. And even as with sleepy eyes I watch, the full moon through the skies Sails with a seeming moveless motion, A globe of fire In a purple ocean.
