MR L. L. SMITH'S PROPOSED LAND TAX. TO THE EDITOR OF THE AGE. Sir, — The Upper Houso has certainly a great, deal to answer for in the renewed agitation on lbs land question, rendered inevitable by their arrogant refusal to accept tho bill recently submitted to them. The ghost of tho Convention would hava been effectually laid had tho council of old ladies been prepared to receivo that measure of compro mise in anything like a liberal and proper spirit. The Legislative Council, however, contains a great many ' antiquated parties,' who liuvo outlived all JJ1UIUUUU UJ1UVU Ul UUUUbl^jUllU UUUU111U UUIIUVGIB, US their too evident greed assures us, iu the axiom ' that avarice is a fine old gentlemanly vice.' Progressive le gislation is becoming impossible with such an Upper Chamber ai that with which wo have to struggle. 'Tis fashionable to cry out against tho intolerance and tyranny of democracy, but what improvement shows itself when a chosen few — the bad results of' innumerable accidents, possessors, or reputed pos1 scssors, of considerable wealth, and, for that reason only, an aristocracy — possess the power to stop tho way in useful legislation. Do thoy show examples of self sacrifice 1 Do they even exhibit prudent foresight? When tho French people found tho im peding power of their king used to prevent proper concessions to tho masses from becoming law, thoy at first only hooted ' Monsieur Veto,' but at last they beheaded him. The people complain of tho Upper Chamber and its power so unscrupulously used to veto every liberal measure, and they havo good ground for doing bo. Prosontly thoy will give over complainiug and tako to cursing their enemies, and thereafter, perhaps, deprive them of thoir ill-used advantage. Mr Smith's proposal to tako all tho ?hinds in tho colony for rovenuo purposes is sensible enough, but the rate of progression by which this simple one per cent, on three hundred acres grows into twenty por c-jtit ou immense area8, is too ex travagant to be entertained. Peoplo of property de servo to bo punished, no doubt ; but surely such punishment for possessing capital is rather too severe Perhaps the proposition is purposely mado oxcossivo, with a business-like view to an abatement and a compromise later in the day. I would, bow ever, suggest that a reasonable modification of tho schemo at onco is the only ground on which it can over becomo popular with the peoplo of this colony, who aro not yet converts to theories of Prudhon. — I am, Sir, yours, See., A WORKMAN. Melbourne, 30th April, 1804. The recent Census of England shows the list of occupations followed bj' more than 100,000 per sons : — Agricultural laborers and farm servants (without including members of the farmer's family), 1,188,789 ; domestic servants, 1,100,974 ; engaged on tho cotton and calico manufacture, 450,040 per sons ; on tho woollen cloth manufacture, 130,031 ; on tho iron manufacture, 125,771 ; on the satin and silk manufacture, 101,070 ; coal-miners, 24G,G13 ; dressmakors and milliners, 237,101 ; laundry peoplo, 107.G07; shoemakers, 250,581; tailors, 130,390; carpenters and joiners, 177,909 ; blacksmiths, 108,105. There aro 309,883 persons described ge nerally as 'laborers.' Disclosures in the London Iuilk and Ego Trade. — In a railway compensation caso the claimant (Mr Willard) had a milk and provision business in Moor lane, London. It appeared from tho evidence of the plaintiff that ho sold a largo quantity of milk. To overy two gallons of milk ho added one gallon of water. His lordship, amid groat laughter, hoped it was good water, and trusted that water was tho only addition. The plaintiff Rfllfl filfif. it*, tuna n*ml flinf lm linri linn-n tmirrlif 1-at» to do it when ho was a child, and ho had not got out of the habit yet. He also bought country eggs at Ga 6d per 120, and retailed them at Id and ljd each as now laid, even when one week old. The jury awarded tho claimant £700 compensation. Destruction of Colt's Pistol Manufactory. — A letter from Hartford, Connecticut, dated 5th February, says — ' Ono half of tho factory of the Colt's American Arras Company was destroyed this morning. In the building destroyed, Colt's pistols and revolving rifles wero manufactured. In tho buildings saved, tho United Slates rifles aro manu factured, the company having a largo contract from the Government for the manufacture of theso wea pons. This portion of the works will continue in operation, giving employment to 800 men. Tho stock of |)isto)s and rifles convicted and in process of manufacture, which was destroyed by this fire, is valued at a million of dollars. Tho machinery de stroyed cost moro than half a million ; and the whole loss is estimated at two millions. The total insurance on tho property is 000,000 dollars, of which about 00 per cent, was on tho proporty de stroyed. Nearly 900 men are thrown out of em ployment. Tho fire broko out in tho drying room in tho attic, and spread with great rapidity. Tho ori gin of tho fire is a mystery. One man was killed, and another is still missing.' Rochdale Co-operative Societies. — Tho fol lowing figures, taken from tho statement of accounts of tho Rochdalo Equitable Pioneers' Society for tho quarter ending December, 1803, aro interesting, as showing tho extraordinary development of tho co operative principle in Rochdalo ; und it is a gratify ing evidence of prudence and stability that the co operators have boon so successful, notwithstanding tho late sovero distress. Tho cash received for goods sold was £42,791 10 9-Jd, being an increase of £7130 4s Id, compared with tho December quarter of 1802 ; and the contributions received amounted to £3921 4s Id, being an increaso over the corresponding quarter of last year of £2252 Is. The withdrawals wero £3880 17s 2d, being £1604 0s lid less than the same quarter last year. During tho year tho cnpitul has increuscd £11,833, the so ciety's stock-in-trudo is worth £10,284 17s 8d, and tho total assets aro £49,3G1 17a 11-Jd. The mem bers number 4013, having increased by 512 -during the year. Buildings had been erected during tho year at a cost of about £800, a branch store at Pin fold was being opened at a cost of £750, and ground had been secured at Spotland Bridge on which to build a new branch store during the summer. The profits for the quarter amounted to £5374 5s 2Jd, which, after allowing ten per cent. for the reduction of fixed stock, five per cent, on capital invested, and two and a half per cont. on the net profits for the educational fund, would allow a dividend of 2a od on each ono pound pur chase-money. Tho profits for the wholo year were .1 £19,671 2s Od. At tho quarter]}' meeting, held in the public hall on tho 4th January, £21 was voted to tho Manchester Royal Infirmary. Emigration in the Nineteenth Century. ? Embracing tho wholo United Kingdom, we find that between tho years 1815 and 1859, a vast army of 5,000,000 emigrants loft our ports. But during tho same period, notwithstanding tho positive loss in deaths, over and above tho displacement of popula tion, caused by the Irish famine, the British Islands gained at least 10,000,000 inhabitants. Of tho 5,000,000 emigrants, 1,800,000 woro bouud for own colonies in North America, Australia, or New Zea land. Taking in tho Wost Indies, tho Cape, Natal, and a fow other points, wo may say that an aggregate of 2,000,000 found their way to British settlements. This part of tho displacement, so far from beiiig a loss, was a distinct gain, the majority of emigrants becoming not only consumers but producers', under much moro favorable conditions than in the places of their birth. The greater part of the remaining 3,000,000 have been dispersed among tho United States, adding incalculably to tho profits of the enormous trade which, until recent disas ters, wo carried on with all parts of the Union. A comparative estimate of three 3'cars' emigration from Franco and England affords a striking result : — Franco. England. 1852 . . . under 10,070 . . 308,7G4 . 1854 .. .. 18,090 .. 323,429 1858 .. .. 13,813 .. 113,972 It must not be forgotten that 1852 was our maximum year, in which the effects of the social revolution in Ireland reached a culminating point ; and tbut, during tho same year, Franco was in that condition of agitated susponso which immediately followed the coup d'etat of December. 1851. But whon ample allowance has been made on this account, tho fact still remains that England, with 27,000,000 of inhabitants, throw off an emigrating surplus thirty-six times larger than was furnished by the population of France, which, at that time, Btood to our own at least in the proportion of four to three. Daring 1850 the departures from Great Britain, greatly diminished even then from the standard of 1852, gave an average of ono in every 157 of tho population. In Franco during tho same year, emigratioa having made a considerable advauco, tho average was no higher than one in 2196. Meantime tho statis tics of population havo shown a vigorous increase on tk.e part of England, and a stationary condition —if not a decrease — in Franco. The 27,000,000 inhabiting Great Britain in 1851 had advanced to a total exceeding 29,000,000 in 1861 ; whilo, ex. eluding the gain of about 2,000,000 by the annexa tion of Savoy and Nice, the decennial period pro duced ho advance at all in the population of France. — Borne and Foreign Review.
