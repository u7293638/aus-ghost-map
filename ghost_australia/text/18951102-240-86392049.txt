How different the once luxuriant room appeared to what it had done a fow days previously i The pictures wore taken from the walls. The library shelves stil lined the walis, but destitute and bare of books, like skeletons of their former solves. The same abomination of desolation was oevident through the houseo. So completo was the Etl's fanore, that the whole of his efflsot had boon reallaeod for the benefit of hle oraditors. The very house boeneath whose roof he oat had pasoed from his possession, and in a few days he would be praotloolly homolosa. In this dark hour he thought with bitter. nees of his wife. She had boon absent from his home for a fortnight, and during that time no word from her had roached him. It had been no strange event for therse two to be apart from each other for even longer periods. At another time he would have looked upon hoe leaving him for cotal ongagemonts as a matter of course, but lOoked at In the light of the then proesont circumstances he regarded her absence as a flight from his ruined hearth. He did not blame her, he only blamed himself, knowing that it was more his fault than hers that their lives had lain so far asunder. II he had been more of a oompanion to her, It he had entered more thoroughly into her life, If he had lot her a little more Into his, all might have boon so different; but throughout the years of their wedded life he had held her as far aloof from him as if she had been, in faot-as, indeed, in spirit she had been-a stranger to him, instead of bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh. And yet he had loved her, loved her more earnestly than he had over loved human oroature, only he had kept the ardour ol his afleotion tar down in the depth of hit nature, so deep that none but he knowof its existence. It was like the fire that smoulders beneath the strata of a mountaio, none koowlg of its burning there until on, dayit breaks through the hard cruet onc starles, sometimes destroys those, who., lirvig on the surfaco, have little rooked of the blaze beneath them. Jne had left her address at an hotel in Dieppo, and at times he had purportoe writing, imploring her to return, or, at al events, to explanm her absence. But bl, pride arrested his hand, and strangleo th. impulso at its birth. He was a ruined man. The news of hi collapse was the talk of the world. If eh. had pity, oonsolation, or sympathy for him they should reach him uutoJoited ; if ont came back, oh I how hle heart would bonne to greet her, but his proud, unbeodino spirit could not call her to his side. There was one refleootion in which ht found much solace ; when they marrted. what little dower she rouenhst wMas striotl settled upon her, and he, at that time millionatro twoe over, had amply supple mented this, so that the trust-fnnd then attasd would afford a liberal provision for her for life. The blow had crnshed him; she would hardly even feel it. Teon he thought of his future proape ts. Ite would go abroad, and wlth his vat ano wide experineeo anl his giant brain r"ereot In another land the shattered edifies of hi. fortunes. Hoa good name, thank .eaven. had not perishad in the wreok--tress of lrooumstance had driven his financial houos upon the rooks of failure, but the honour of its captain remained untarnished as ever. He would leave behind him his failur', hi. diamantled home, his cold-hearted fashion able wife. Whutheraoever he bent his steps his reputation would have prooded him. Ho broodings were in??rrupted by the opening of the door. He looked up angril -his seopondeooy had so wrought upon hi. nerves that he was irritable to a degree. But as he recognised that face his deepair fled as a cloud before the wind, asa shaleo in the light of the sun. With a cry of gle surprise, with tears welling his i hard, grey eyoe, and with a great joy filling his heart, he rose from his chair, rushed aoross the room, and in a moment held his wife clasped in hib arms. What were now failure, disappointment, or lons of fortunes She whom he loved beat in the world was on his breast ; though he might have lost all in the wor:d beside, like another Maro Antony, he deemed, fur the dear sake of her he loved, the world well lost. " Then my ruin does not part us, Olive l' he assea, when at last his voice found strength for words. "Part us, Chislehuret -it bindos s." She had only that day heard the news He coall not understand her. He know not of the strange events that had occurred to fill her mind and hands sinoo she had left hdm. And than there came upon her with Scohill the reflection that she, too, had a story to toll- that, perhaps when her tale was told, the man who now strained her in his arms would spurn her from him as an unolean thing. She told him all, spacing neither others nor herself, sitting at his toea, her bowed head upon his knees, her tearful eyes not darig to meet his gaze. When she had caosea she waited his decree. Should sh. depart into the world and rid him of heraelf or ever? Poer a tlno she waited in sileneoo, then she felt his hand stroking her unbralded treasse, then the brave old man threw has yet strong arm around the loverly womau ittiog an the footstool at his kneea, telling bar that he was here, and she was his, tuo death they twam should part. "It ts a painful story, Ollve," he saId, ibnt pity you and the agony you mnst have endured too mouht to chide or blumo you.

And, very noon afterwards, the other Eogllsh lady, who had for a time hovered at hs ldo, returned, accompnied by a grey haired man, whom they learned with regret those Apollos of the cajfs, wos her husband, the "milor Chielehorst." And he was indeed Olivo's husband now, for thi two had once again gooo through the mar riage coromony. But prior to this. OCive'e first marriage with Sir Bayard Blair had boon osthblished on the sworn testimony cf the minister who had tied that hasty knot halo in feat. Lady Chialehurct had, of course, rEn dared herself technically amenable to the lan by her second marriage. She and the Earl felt, however, little npprohenaion on that ground. Her first husband wa dead and in a few weekns sho and Lord Chiale buret would be speeding frr acrees the Atlantio to live the remninder of their years in comfort, if not afluoenc., and happy in a mutunl trust and affection which, though Into in its blossoming, would bloom unfading throughout their livre the whole history of her flit unhappy onion might have been kept a scorot (snd this wan Jack's own ardent desire), but the Countess was determined that her son ehould inherit his father's nsmo and tbh aetate which, by right of birth, belonged to him. The matter was placed in rth hands of English solioltors and the Sootch writers to the oignet, whose task was faoill rated by a written and attested document found upon Sir Bayard'e body, wharoby hb had not only devised all hin estate to his eon, John Blair, commonly known as Joht Chippery, but set out a true history of th, .ircumstences of his marriage with Oliv, MaoArrocher. This paper was drawn ir euflieont form ti be proved as a will; and rbis, together with the evidence of th. deteoh minister, Lady Cnialehurot, be, great-aunt, Lady G(rizol MaeArrecher !aleb Vickers, and our old friends th, Chipperyo, was found suffient to establial Jack'e identity, legitimacy and title. It was in vain that Jack remanotrated with the Countess. "* My dear mother," he said, "you anr ?sniebhig yourself into exile to establiut ‚Ä¢y title to a name I don't care for. and es. ttase, which, by Sir Bayard'e will, bolonu to me already.

Did she love him best of all? That question sho would not ask herself. There was no need to ask it.

What if the dream of her girl hood had boon so golden; certain It was the awaking was oomplote-the too fair vision roneo forever from her life. Ho wars happy. rho love he ounld not give for hers heoould lavish on another who loved him equally in return. As for her own love of Jack ol touarto, Marty rtaolved that she would live it down; it would be sere to die, for sh. would never lot it see the light. Only eomotimes, lfarty, the love which bloseomn in th' light of day i first to perish; while in the cold, dark shade undreamed of hy the world, some evergreen offctiotn deep In its root, if stuntod in its growth lives and grows, and olings; and though the eInde bo ohill, tho dews and the sanshine scont, the plant noearod for, and untended though it be, will never die. When the final moment oame, when Marty stood in front of the fallen curtain, taking her last look upon the world from the footlights,itho last of her few words of farewell trembling on her lips-the hones rising en more in front of her-wreaths and bouqueot raainog around har- from one of the stage boxes a fair, white woman's hande throw a boequet of choicest e::oties at her fooeet. Laden with floral offerings as were her arms, Marty stooped and picked up this one, aud pressed it to her lips, with a glhnoe at the box from whence it eame And when she left the theatre that night it was in Lady May Blair's carriage that she drove away, and by her side sat sweet May nerself, while Frank Falton and Jack of Etearts faced them. In a oosy, exquisiteoly furnished hambeor 'n Jack's town manslon, a suppor-table laden with tho oholoent of viands, flowers, fruits, and wines awaited them. As the merry loartotto dscenoded from the smartly. appointed chariot, a host of gorgeous foot aou flung open the wide doors and lined the oeble hall and the wide marble etairoease. "Ha s M. Tqunotonno arrived " asked Jack on entering, " Yes, Sir John; just this moment." "Your man vi footes is quite all right, ny Jacks," a voice shouted fr.om auross the hall, whereupon Jack introdnood Frank to 1f. Trquotonne, and the trio adjourned to she drawing room to await the ladies. "And eat Is eo man zat is to marry la belle Marty.'said Tiquetvnne, taking Jack ascdo. "' lfoi I he is quito Englaeshe-h .

The arms were folded and Marty within hem,. her head upon that breast whereon it rat hadrested in her childhood. h'rom her ,oaom she drew a little rose that she had always worn, and Tiquelonne recognlied the Jewel as her mother's. Mwr:ys story, iragmontary through it was, and a ?aild s eoullotion twenty years old, told the rceohuio n all there was to know. A uddon departure from the quiet faruhoueo ad the pleauant orchard which she knew o well, though she was then too young to ,now where they were; a ride by train ; Snasty journey by night through a great ulooteou of houses; a uccesilon of streete l1 blaze with gaslight, then another train , o; than for te hirst time a journey by eea-a confused memory of rough, resdess catera and wild wond; acreaming women, .nd hoaae swearing men. Then one very .ark night, when the wind wan fiercor, and .ao waters walaor and darker, and the foam ,pon their ridges whiter than before-a ,cone of terror-men rushing hither arl utuer, shouting as t in vam efforts to out uor the storm-then Marty remembered her nohecr's whise lace, her egonised eyes, the iarp to her bosom, the prair r to Heaven to ,orgoie herself and guaord her chlld-then a u.n ofc da?t waera--a mighty roar-then a Jank-then lrankeome onith-and aftier -cwht we know. Tnht night r m the Freonhman's heart cun anger agoenat his dead wife went ou for ,ver. ne was dead ; she had been dead lor .wenty years. All the time he had been cursitg ner, ating her, reviling her, lea?veu' own vengeance upon her had been a timg of the put, and gro smg older year y year. He had cured hir, he had called auwn Goda retrobution upon her sin; now, learning that punishment had fallen upon her, he trembled th tthink he had so tong nureed in his heart a longing for -eveoge against the dead. Oot trom him ucart went hate and bitter raCentment In .e stead came Lorgiveness and love for the ?oitl that Heaven had at liat reotred to atm. But he did not tell Marty and he resolved ohal she should never know the sin of her mother'a flight. Looking back at the bitter past. he eaw plainly that Sir iayard Iclilr, aming tempted lteanlle from her home, had chosen not to share her thlght further than to Antwerp, whn whence they muet have .mbaraed for England-t for he had trooked them to lirusaola-and had nt all probnollity appointed a rendes vouo in England, which was deetined uevor to be kept.
