It was — lot mo sec — last Thursday night, botweon tho hours of 11 and 12 o'clock, as I lay sloeping, I was suddenly awakened by an uncommon noise, and hoard something coming up stairs and stalking directly towards my room. Tlio door llying open I drew back my curtain, and saw a faint glimmering light enter my chamber." _ " Of a bluo colour, no doubt 1" " Tho light was of a palo bluo, ray lord, and followed by a tall moagro personage, his locks hoary with age, and clothed in a long loose gown. A leather girdle was about his loins, his board thick and grizzly, a largo Rir cap j on his head, and a long staff in his hand. Struck with astonishment, I remained for 801110 timo motionless and silent. Tho j figure advanced, staring mo full in tlio face. I then said, "Wlionce and what art thou 1" The following was the answer I received : " I am tho watchman of tho night, an please your honour, and niado bold to coiuo upstairs to inform the family of their street door being open, and if it was not soon shut, tlicy might bo robbed before morning."
