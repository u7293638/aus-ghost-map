Melbourne, Sydney, Australian: Cups, &c.; dates of entry are invariably left until general entry day. However, though this suggestion may be worthy of ^consideration another time,' I~ must for the present deal with the matter as I find it, and it behoves me the more forcibly to put before horse^owners what is required of them. Entries must in all cases reach the secretary of the Q.T.O. (Brisbane)j A.J.C. (Sydney), R.J.C. (Bockhampton), or M.T.C. (Maryborough), by 4 o'clock on the day -named, and I trust that Mr. Mapleston will have a good list of entries to put before the public. 1 .

Long may it remain so, say I,; and under its present management' tliere seems to be but little doubt of it. ; The next meetingto attract attention is that of ihe Balonne JockeyClub,whichtakes place at St. G-eorge on the 24th. 25th, and 26th proximo, and it promises to be something out of tlie common, as a large number of horses of a high class have been nomi nated, so that should the. handicapper be successful in pleasing, a. majority of owners success will be as sured. The weights for the St. George Handicap are set to be declared on April 1st, which happens, how ever, to be a Sunday, so that probably the 2nd. will be the day on which I shall have, them, and that will be Monday next. ........ ...; ^ On Tuesday, as mentioned above^ entries for the Queensland Turf Club handicaps require to be made, and on, Thursday the 5th Mr. £>uniop calls for entries for the Warwick handicaps, four in number, so that owners must be careful not to make any mistake and get left out in the cold. Seventy acres of the Toowoomba racecourse were sold last week, and the sale appears to have been a satisfactory one.

The races passed off in a satisfactory manner, there being good fieldg of horses for most of the events, and iio hitch occuired to mar the harmony of the proceedings. The first race was the Maiden Plate, for which Gascon was served up very warm, being backed at level money in a field of six. However, he never had a ghost of a show with Inglesides, who won )jy nearly fifty yards. .After this* came the Publicans' Purse, ivhich was won byTMaii boy.

Sir Joseph will be re membered as the horse formerly belonging to Mr. Wallace, got by Bethnal Green (iinp.), out of Phizgig (imp.) (dam of Su war row). He is ratlier a plain look ing brown horse, but-evenly made, and will doubtless make a good sire, forwhich purpose Mr. Holmes tells me he is to be iised *>n Wyaga Stat ion. By the way* I omitted to mention above that Re sponse had been purchased by Mr* Skuthorpe, and she accompanied Patterson's string to Brisbane. She, too, I believe goes to St. George. Mr. Mooney had a totalisatpr sweepstakes on the Sydney Cup on Wednesday, which was well patro nised, 305 half sovereigns being invested in it. The dividend paid to the backers of DareLm was <£C 17s. -considerably less than his marked price. Backers of Mistaken received £L 4s. per ticket, and those who went for Willeroo had 15s. to draw for each invest ment. The sweep was conducted in the usual fair, precise and business-like manner, which has won Mr. Mooney the confidence of the public, and these sweeps do much good in keeping alive an interest in the doings in the sporting world outside the colony. The sporting event of this week being the Sydney <2up, Figaro engaged the services of an expert, who sends the straight griffin thus: Sydney Cup 1\. Darebin. 2\. Mistaken. 3\. Willeroo. [I regret the above tip came rather too late for last week's issue, but the soundness of our Corres pondent's conjectures, is proved by the result of the great race. I have taken down his shingle, and engaged him until further orders. ED. Figaro.] THE " Figaro " Prize Coupon of £5 on the Sydney Cup proved a "skinner" for the boss. There were over 1100 competitors* and hot one of these placed the winners in the order in which they passed to the post. The boxes were opened on Thursday morning by Mr. J. M'Lennon, and"Hermit," the Sporting. Editor of Figaro. One knowing 'un had the three winners in four coupons, each coupon bearing a differ ent arrangement, but he didn't strike the correct order after all. Had he only taken the trouble to make two more permutations with the same three horses, he would have exhausted the possibilities with those three, and must have carried off the fiver."
