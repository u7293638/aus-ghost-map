ANOTHER KEILLY GANG STORY. Another story is told by the " Seymour Express" of the hairbreadch escapes which brought the seoluded El'roa distriot before the world during Kelly campaign, Mr. Wyatt, P.M., was one day walking through the yet original scrub to be found behind the temporary court house when he passed a young fellow who eyed him rather closely, and who it turns out was no less a person than Steve Hart. A shot timne after, the outlaw met a fMiend of his and asked him who was the old buffer with the sheet round his hat. On being told !hat it was the worthy and amiable police magistrate, lie exp es-ed his deep regret that he had not knooked him over. MORMONISo s IN VICTORIA. - The "'Age" reports:-At the City Court on Wedneslay, a man named Thomas Phillips was charged with neglecting to support his two illegitimate children. Mary Ryan stated that about six years ago the defendant took her step daughter to live with him, in the same house with his wife, who after a time left. The two children in question were subsequently born and f'r six months had been left upon the hands of Mrs. Ryan and her husband, the mother having disappeared, and the father having been absent in Sydney until his recent return, when he was arrested. Mr. ltill, the city missionary, who was acquainted with the facts of the case, enlightened the bench as to the life of the defendant. It appears that at the time of his taking the girl from her home he represented himself as a Mormon, and for some years his wife did not object to the other woman living with her in the house. Defendant agreed to the terms pro posed by Mr. Call, which were that Mr. W. Collard Smith, the Minister of Education. has taken up the que.tion of the classification of teathers from the point at which it had arrived when he left the department. He has appointed a board to deal with the subject, and expects to be able to perfect a scheme within a short time by which promotions will take place by merit and seniority. " Age." According to our ("Argus" Monday) easble inessages, the Nihilist movement is being rapidly stamped out in Russia owing to the rigorou.s measures adopted by General Melikoff. The state of ITrcland continues to cause alarm, and fresh acts of violence are feared. The Australian cricketers have suffered their first defeat. Tile Scarborough Eighteen played well, and won the matoh by 90 runs. On the 6th Sep tember the Australians commence a match a;ain-t a representative team' on Kennington Oval, and this, no doubt, will be a most interesting game. It is the intention of the Govern ment (says the (t Argu'") to fl ,at the Â£2,000,000 balance of the loan of 1878-9 this year. The operation will be effected through the Associated Banks, who have been auttorised to communicate with the London agencies on the subject. Before the money can be utilised here, a Railway Construc tion Bill will have to be passed, and the consideration of such a measure is, therefore, to be one of the early tasks of the session. CUnIous EF'ECT FROM FRuoI or.- The "Carlton Advertiser' says ;-A curious illustration of the affeot of the mind upon the body under certain conditions has lately been presented to us. A man living in the neighborhood some short time ago, had a wife who was given over body and sonl to the gin-fiend. She had been warned by her husband to desist from her evil ways, but, although pretending to accede to his wishes, kept up the practice complained of in secret. She made use of her little daughter-a girl about twelve years old-to bring her drink from the public house. This came to the konowledge of the husband who threatened the child with a severe flagging if he should ever again find her carrying liqa;or to her mother. The latter, however, overcame Ihe fears of her daughter and induced her once more to go to the hotel. But the pitcher that went to the hotel so many times was broken at last. The child, as she was coming out of the hotel bar with the jug of beer in her hand, saw her father watching her from the other side of the street, and was so striken with terror, that the jug dropped out of her hands and she stood as one paralysed. When her father came over he found that the fright had turned the eyes in her head. She went under an operation efter a time, but although her eyes were restored to their natural position her sight was ruined for ever. A HARD STORY. - The "Hawkes Bay Herald" (New Zealnod) is respon sible for the following:--"A rather curious incident occurred in Hastinds street ths other day. A gentleman was walking somewhat briskly, and, in turning the corner, bumped up against a well-known draper. He was about to apologise, when the draper inter rupted him with the exclamatiou-' You have saved my life !' and, in explan ation, stated that he had suddenly become lockjawed, and was on his way to the doctor, in great pain, when the collision affected a speedy and un expected cure. EFFECTS OF EXAHLPLE.-A corre spondent supplies the following to the " Hamilton Spectator" :-" The Opera house tragedy is ended, Greer dead, Soudry about Melbourne, and Mrs. Greer progressing to recovery. It was just by the merest chance that another scene had not been enacted that night. A gentleman in a high position in one of the Government offices, who has been a little 'off his head,' became saturated with the idea that his wife had not been faithful to him, and he determined the seducer and seduces should pay the penalty with their lives. Fortunately, about the third act it became known that the would-be assassin had a six-chambered revolver, and a friend called him out of the theatre, and got him to hand over the loaded weapon. It becomes a question for M.r, Lyster to enquire is it safe to play ' Les Hugenots' again, attended as it was by such uufortunate results I" PorIcE AOTIVITY IN THE KELLY COUNTRY.-A telegram in Thursday's "Herald" states that there was great ercitement at Wangaratta on Thursday morning on account of a sudden and mysterious movement on the part of the police. Evidently acting on some important information Sergeant Steele and a large body of police, with black trackers, fully armed, m.unted in haste and galloped off in the directin of the Warby Ranges. All sorts of rumours ate abroad, but nothing definite is known, One statement is to the effect that a fresh gang of hushrangers is out, and another is that the movement has something to do with the finding of Ned Kelly's t"plant." All this, how ever, is mere conjeoture. The pol ce resolutely refuse to give the slightest information. SUPPOSED JIURDRIt AT WICKLIFE. The "Argus" eorrespondent telegraphed the following from Ararat on Thursday evening last t-Mir. J. H. Alley, coroner for the district, held a magis terial inquiry at Wickliffe yesterday on the body of a man who was found lying dead in a paddock belonging to Mr. Williamson, about seven miles from the township, under circumstances which ssem to indicate that a horriblle murder had been committed. The body had apparently been lying some weeks before it was found, and was much decomposed. It was that of a man about 5ft 7in high, and was lying face downwards, with a wound in the skull, apparently inflicted by a dull, heavy instrument, A large portion of the back part of the skull was fractured, a hole corresponding to the wound being found in the hat. There was nothing to lead to the identification of the man, and a verdict was returned that deceased had met his death by a wound in the head, inflicted by some person or persons unknown. The " Hamilton Sl.ectator" states that Miss Eva Carmichael, the heroine of the Loch Ard disaster, is about to be married to Mr. W. C. Mackay, the son of a wealthy Dublin merchant. Some excitement (states Friday's "Argus") is being caused in Kilmore at present by the appearance of a "ghost" that nightly promenades the railway platform, and has already so sorlously frightened several persons as to render them very ill. A few nights ago the apparition was fired at several times, but without producing any effect. It ii believed that some of the residents are perpetrating a foolish practical joke, and the police have taken the matter in hand, It is reported (says the "Argus" of Satur day) that Ayoub Khan has made an unsnc cessful attempt to storm the British positions at Candahar. His chief assault was directed at the ehikarpoor gate, which is in the south of the city. The British trllps were able to repel the assault Canlahar is enclosed with walls, but the fortifications with the ex oeption of the citadel, which is situated on the top of a precipitous rock. about two miles to the north of the city, are not very strong.

Although the statement that the agitators intended to blow up the barracks at Cork with gunpowder is disbelieved, there remains some ground for alarm. inasmuch as a quantity of gunpowder hans been folmd concealed, although too distant from the barracks to be intended for the destruction of that building. The greatest vigilance is being observed, and armed patrols pemrmbu late the streets. If the lawlessness should continue, it is said that a winter session of Parliament. will be necessary.-"Argus," Friday. From the "Argus" we learn that a meet ing of the Executive Council was held on Thursday, when the appointment of Mr. F. L. Smyth, as acting judge of the County Court, was confirmed and ordered to be gazetted. During the evening a supplement to the "Government Gazette" was issued formally notifying the appointment. An action (states Friday's "Argus") was brought in the County Court yesterday, by Mr. Samuel Fieldhouse, to recover Â£2,000 from the jroprietors of the " Age" news paper, for an alleged libel published against the plaintiff in that newspaper on the 31st January last. The libel complained of con sisted of comments on the character of the plaintiff in reference to his dealings with his bank, and also of a statement that there was reason to believe the bank was not the only victim of misplaced confidence in him. The case lasted the whole of the day, and at its close the jury returned a verdict for the defendants. The " Argus" reports that the nomination papers of fIr. Philip Russell and Mr. J. H. Conner have been duly lodged with the re turning officer for the South-Western Prouince. We learn from thei "Argus" that Mr. J. W,.

WO'FE.S SCaRIuDAnA AnoMATIro SCHNAPPS. There is encouraging news from Canda bar. From our cable telegrams it will be seen that General Primrose, taking ad vantage of the inactivity of Ayonb Khan, has tforced the fighting by a sortio from the garrison. The attack was successful, and after inflicting eonsiderable loss on thile enemy, the British force retired into thile garrison with the loss ol very few men. General Phayro is gradually making his way towards Candahar from the Khojukl, but hIis march is likely to be impeded by a large body of Afghans con centrated between his force and that of Ayoub Khan.
