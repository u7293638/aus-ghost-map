THE FORSAKER FARMHlOUSE. Against the wooded hllls it stands, l Ghost of a dead home, staring through Its brokey. liehts on wasted lands Where old time harvests grew. Unplowed, unsown, by scythe unshorn, The poor forsaken farm- fields lie, Once rich and rife with golden corn And pale green breadths of rye. OE healthful herb and flower bereft, The garden plot na housewife keeps; Through weeds and tangle only left The snake, its tenant, creeps. A lilac spray, once blossom-clad, Sways bare before the empty rooms; Beside the roofless porch a sad, . : Pathetic red rose blooms.. His track, in mould of dust fId drouth, On floor and hearth the squirrel leaves, And in the fireless chimney's mouth His Web the spider weaves. The leaning barn about to fall Resounds no more on linsking eres; No cattle low in vanl or stall, No thresherbo~ts his shav.es. So sad, sodrear I It sqems almost :. Some haunting spirit makes its sign;' Thbt down yon shadowy lane some ghost? Might drive his spectral k in.
