REFRACTORY SEAMEN; We have frequently called attention to the case of refractory seamen who have been committed to vthe Adelaide Gaol for offences of various kinds. The thing, we are afraid, has grown into something like a systematic trade ifti'th' sailors, who commit breaches of the law for the ex press purpose of being; sent to prison, either because they believe themselves 4,0 ' be better off in gaol than they would be working on Jbpard^of. ship|, or 'to escape' their obligations to _; 'the1 captains whom th8y have agreed to serve. The hardship inflicted on the colon j^ i^^tvingip keep' these persons jh bo^ata^ive idleness ' has often been' o6mtiieiitedr bh,° and during the last session ;6#^aTliatniintlS&:. Bower asked for la .return ghosting ;the total cost of maintenance, clothing, &c.j; of seamen sentenced to1 Her Majes,t£'s Crapl i;o' hard labor from November 1/ 1874y toNotfem ber 1, 1875- also' the amottnt of ' cash paid to 4,h^';Sheriff,^J-ai*- proceeds of prison labor.
