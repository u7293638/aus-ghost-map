SELECTED POETRY. MOONRISE IN AUSTRALIA. A trackless forest all around Of lofty gams that from the ground As saplings sprang in ages past : The short sweet twilight fadeth fast, And from the forests depths I hear The locust's whirring noise, the clear Soft magpie song, the sudden jscreain Where cockatoos like white ghosts gleam Among the melancholy boughs, The wild dog's bark from where there browse Stray herds of kangaroos, the cry Of something death struck. As I lie And listen to these sounds I see Long- moonbeams pierce a lofty tree, Like random lances thrust to kill Some fiend who baffles all their skill, And even as with sleepy eyes I watch, the full moon through the skies Sails with a seeming moveless motion, A globe of fire in a purple ocean. — W. Shahp, in N. B. Advertiser. [We never heard of wild dogs barking, but we live and learn. — Ed/}
