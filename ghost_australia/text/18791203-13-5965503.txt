RETURNS Mr BELCIIER said he was not present on Thursday when Mr Cuthbert undertook to hy the return, as to transfers of land, on the talile He asked for it three months ago, and was promised that it sho ild be supplied 1 he motion was put from the chair and agreed to, but nothing was heard about the return until last week, when Mr. Wilson submitted a motion. 'iho PRESIDENT-The hon. member (Mr Belcher) did not mov e for any return, lie simply asked a question. Mr WILSON-Mr Cuthbert said on thursday that if any hon member would move for the return it would bo supplied, so I moved for it in the absence of the hon roembir Mr CUTHBERT- No order was made by the House at tlio time Mr Belcher mentioned the matter, and therefore no return could be tupphed The return has not jet been laid on the table STAMP DUTIES BILL Mr CUTHBERT moved that tina bill be read a second time The first Englmh atamp act v, aB passed in the reign of William and Marj,andno lera than six acts became law in the same reign Stamp acta wont on accumulating up to 183G, when the number in operation was 230 It was very difficult for the people to tell what amount of duties vere pajable on certain documents, and the most skilful law j era very frequentlj puzzler! io put the proper construction on the lav?, "he whole of tbe English stamp acts wero Consolidated into two statutes passed in 1870 Ljion these two statutes the present hill wa modelled It waa proposed that the new duties should tako effect from the oth December, and it was expected tliat in 12 months they would produce a «venue of £100,000 Of all kinds of oireçt taxation, perhaps stamp duties were the least objectionable Some pooplo thought jt viaa not desirable to introduce the system, bat the revenue was required to moot tho public expenditure. In another place it liad "ecu ut.uut.u niai it wonia not do uesirauiu {o increase customs duties further than had been proposed tins session, and to meet an It would havo been useless to have imposed the duties unless miana had also been pro- vided for enforcing them An Hon. Member -That should havo bOBn «one in a separate bill bir CHARLES SLADEN said that he 'bought the Houbo would not be competent to discuss the merits of stamp duties until it »nil ascertained whether this bill was in accordance with tho practice of the Imperial i arliamcnt. In another place great Btress «ma been laid on tho dean'abihty of following me practice of the Imperial Parliament in relation to money bills This House had not wen bo demonstrative os another place in proc aiming ita desire to follow the Imperial practice, but ho was certain that it had m if?fc _ ""favoured to follow that practice, ii this bill was in accordance with the prac- tice of the Imperial Parliament, he hoped no raptionB objection would be taken to it. But »neiiouBO should inform itself as to what that practico was Some day or other it would have to do so, why not now? Tven ii the Council should be so unfortunate as to bo disposed of as an elective body and coin erted mto a nominee Chamber, it would still bo necessary to follow tho practico of the Im penal Parliament, which had been set up as the model and example of the Parliament of this colony Thia Bill purported to bo tho transcript of two Imperial acts passed con temporancouBly He liad not had time to look into theae acts and to ascertain why two should havo been passed in ono session in longland Here the whole subject was dealt with in only one bill Tho ques tion which arose in his mind was this were any of the clauses subsequent to part 2 eBSential to a bill for im] osing stamp duties, and waa it in accordance with the Imperial practice to insert them m the bill for impoa ing the duties ' In ita title it waa a bill 'for krantmrrcertainatampdutiea -which brought it w thin the r0th Bection of tho Con Htitution Act- and to provide for the management and collection thereof Was it usual according to Imperial practice and absolutely necessary that both duties and machinery must be contained in one bill ind the latter as well as the former kent sacred from tlio touch of the Council? His own impression was that this was not a bill which the Council was entire]} restricted by the 5Cth section from altering. There wcro many things connected with the manage- ment of the duties which the Council ought to have tlie sanctioning of. He had onl) re- ceived Ins copy of the bill to day, and there- fore hud not had time to make himself thoroughly acquainted with it. 'The 19th section, however, had caught his attention. It stated that any person forging a die or stamp, malling an impression with a forged die, or knowingly selling any forged stimp, would he guilty of felon), and upon hemp; convicted should be liable to be imprisoned for uny term not ej ceedmg 11 )eirs He had been under the impression that the Council was as much entitled to bo consulted as th*» Absemhl) about matters alfecting the liberty of the Buhject, that it had as much voice ni determining what was a felony, and espectallj one involving imprisonment for 15 }ears, as the Assembly On account of clause l'l alone, the Council would not be justified in allowing this measure to pass simply because it had a free gift preamble. They might he prevented from dealing with any buBineSB, if using the free gift preamble would shut them out (Hear, hear) He thought the free gift preamblo would not ¡iffcd them, however, unless the bill was in accordance with the English practice, as adopted in the 5Gth section of tho Consti- tution Act He did not wish to say that he was desirous of opposing the bill. Ile was particularly anxious not to say a word about the merits of the question at the present time He could fully endorse the remarks of .Mr. Cuthbert that Btampduties were unobjection- able in themselves, but there might bo cir- cumstances under w hicli they would be ob- jectionable, and he had no doubt attention would be drawn to them when the merits of the bill were discussed. Ile moved and ti at suth c n mlttce be directed to investigate the practice of the Imperial Parliament with re fcruico to bills ImpoEine stamp duties, and report to tlio Council "1 Whether It is la conformity »ith that practice to It eludo lu the bill Imposing duties the machinery for tbo management and colloction thereof "2 Whether this bill, providing ob it does for tho grulüii i, of stamp duties and nibo management and collection thereof Is a bill un ter tho 56th sec lou of tho Constitution Act, which tho Council is restricted from altering "That such select committee consist oí sei en mern hers, and ho chosen bj ballot Mr WILSON thought no hon member would objeet toan inquiry for the purpose of finding out whether tina bill waa m accord ance with the Imperial practice, but the ap pomtment of a committe» ought not to be proposed for the purpose ol ca 'ou g a moments delay (Hear, hear ) T1 »re several little matters to which tlu m ment had not paid proper attention and he hoped they would mako it clear that they did not intend to deal unjustly with any association of firms or individuals like the Underwriters Association, which accord nip to one reading of part 4 of schedule 2 might be very heavilj taxed Dr HI ARN suggested that the committee should be directed to inquire into the practice relating to all bills imposing duties Sir CHARirSSLADrN alteredtheamend ment to ' stamp or other duties The amendment was agreed to Inreplj to Dr Hrvrtv, 1 he PR1 SIDLNI Bait!

Mr COPE asked tho Commissioner of Public Works if it waa tho intention of the Government to erect a lighthouse on Cape Nelion , and if so, when they purposed com wencing the work Î Mr PATTERSON replied that the neces- sity of a lighthouse on Capo Nelson was gene- rally acknowledged. At a conference of the Marino departments of the Australian colo lonies, heldin SydneyinSeptembcr,1873 it was recommended that a first-class one should be erected on the Cape In last year s estimates the Bum of £1,000 waa provUed towards the work Subsequently the locality was «»? amined, the Bite selected, and a survey made This j ear the vote had been increased to£2,000 The estimated coBt of the lighthouse was £12 COO, being £4 000 for the apparatus and lantern, and £8,000 for the tower, the keeper a quarters, store, and fencing Tho vote for this j ear was insufficient to start the work, ob the apparatus had to be ordered from rn"land prior to the commencement of the structure , but the Government would make full provi sion m next jcars estimates for carrying out the work EXPORT OF WHEAL Mr DOW asked tho Commissioner of Ii til wavs-1 Whether, upon the completion of the railway connexion between Spencer atreot and Sandridge, ho would have wheat nnd other agricultural produce conveyed right through to the seaboard at the »iimt rates as those between the up country stations and Spencer street ' and 2 Whether, instead of charging at tho rate of 3d per ton per mile between the seaboard and Spencer atreet upon wheat nnd other grain rejected for export purposes, he would allow it to return free' His excuse for bringing this matter forward waa that there would be a large qu tntity of wheat exported thiB year Since the rise of tho f armera' unions, the fanners wero waking up to the necessity of having an export busi- ness Mr WOODS aaid tina waa a question which allected the Hobaon'a Bij Railway, and it had been the policy of his department so far not to interfere with that railway any more than waa necessary In point of fact, things were carried on there pretty much the name as before Of course, an assimi- lation would take place gradually That very day he had signed papera which assimilated the positions of a great number 01 the (mployéa with those on tho Victorian rail was s Under the circumstances, he was acarccl} prepared to answer the lion member, but he might say that every endeavour would bo made by the Government to meet the wishes of the export trade If the farinera of tina colony were going to look forward to a largo export trade in wheat, he thought it should be conducted on the same plan as was adopted in the United States, namely, by having special trucka to tarry the grain, so that it might receive no handling m ita traneit to tue port So far as tho Railway department waa concerned, there would be no difficulty m inukmD' that provision. CARLSRUHE AND DAYLESFORD RAIL WAY. Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN moved for leave to bring m a bill to authorise the extension of tho Carlsruhe and Daj leaford Railway. He explained that it waa proposed to change ll,n^ Hnn ni tl.n llivloufnwl otntinn tn n the position of the Duyleatord station to a Bite which was thought tobo more suitable for the inhabitants of the town and the bill authorised tho purchase of the land necea Bar» Mr GRANT seconded Mr GILLI1 S asked how it waa that the Minister of Railways ullo ved his colleagues the Attorney General and Minister of Justice to introduce this bill ' Ho alBO gave the At torney General notice that the House would require information as to how the bill li id become necessar) It would be remembered that the first bill was for a line fro n Woodend to Dalesford and that subsequently the Minister of Railwuja got it changed 'Tone from Carlsruhe Now they had a new pro position altogether notwithstanding tho fact of a largo expenditure having been already incurred Mr SERVICE sa d some information would also he required from the Minister of I ailwa)S It would be interesting to know whether the dei artment had comm tteditaelf to a site by seiidinL, out notices to all the property holders whose land would be required He would also hie to kno v whether ltwas the duty of the engineer of construction (Mr Tord) to visit such works and how often he had viaited the works at Da} leaford Mr WOODS said it was quite true that notices had been served on the ownera of the land but they w ere oui) noticea to troat and did not commit tho de; artment in any way A new site for the station waa proponed be cause it wus thought that it would give greater accommodation to the inhabitants the pro posed Bite being 2j chains from the original one Mr lord had alwa)a been engineer of design and construction or chief draftsman although bia position had never been acknow lodged before ne designed the North eastern Railway and many other works lhere was no necessity for him losin0 time in vis ting Dalesford becauao all the bections of the Btirve)S were sent m to him and he thereby obtained a clear know ledge ot the i hjsical feiturea of the land-a better knowledge of it in fact than if he had merely visited the site Within the last two sears 110 stations had been opened and if Mr lord had 1 ad to visit them all it would have occupied all hiB time and in short it was not his 1 usinesB to do so 1 he engineering branch ? 1 r. 1 " t" In n. 1 W 1 ri-n rrmf to h id nothing to do witli local requirements 1 hey Bimplj laid the matter before tho head of the department aa a question of engineer ing After that, if it waa conaidered to be more beneficial to the department or to the people to be served, the department im¿ht bet aside the engineer s plan altogether Mr ANDREW hoped the Government would be perfectly frank in this matter He understood that the first site selected for the ! station was admirably suited for the putpo3e, and that the proposed change waa due to a local movement, which could not be justified from a national point of view He was told that the new alto was so situated that it would be impossible for any premises' to be erected to competo with the existing store keepers and publicans Mr RICHARDSON did not think the hon member for Webt Melbourne was justified in making an ex parle statement to influence the House The inhabitants of Daj leaford were not BatiBfied with the Btation site marked out by tho department, and 1,800 of them had signed a petition in favour of a change of site, while there were only 211 in favour of the department site The motion was then agreed to The bill having been brought m was read a first time, and ordered to be real a second time on Thursday CONSTITUTION ACT AMENDMENT BILL TflE SIYTll CLUSE The House having cone into committee for the further consideration of this measure, Mr BERRY moved that tho 6th clause be struck out, with the view of inserting the following - "ti Notwithstanding tbo 'rojcction' of an annual Appropriation Bill or of a Consolidated Kel enuc Bill 1> tho Legislative Council, and in the evento! su»h 'rejection, then on tbo adoption bj tbo Lc^lslatnc Aescmblj of any report from tho committee of supply containing a resolution that any sum bo granted to Her Majestj such sum shall bocome legally avail able for and apphcablo to tho scrv leo or purpose non tion In such ^solution, and may bo issued accordingly out of tlio consolidated revenue, anything in the Oath section ol the Constitution Act to tbo contrary not witliBtandillL., providod alvvajs tint the ' rejection' olanj such bill may bo held to havo taken place for the purposes of this section upon auj such hill not baviugbeen passed bj the Lcjslativo Council within oi c month after its transmission from the Logis ativo Assemblj, unless Parliament bo sooner dissotv ed or proiogucd ' No doubt bon members regretted that it was neccBenry to embody a provision of this character in an Act of Parliament, but their ow n experience of some } ears must tell them that the want of such a provision had worked veo serious mischief to the people of thia country Ho should have thought it almost unnecessar) at the present day to urge such a matter on the .Legislative Assembly or the liberal portion of the constituencies The claims embodied m this clause had been made by the \ssembly from the commence ment of their ttnuucial difficulties with the Legislativ e Council If tho section were not adopted now it would be tantamount toa confession that the Assembly waa invariably w rong m all tho i receding contests Ile had nover v aned from the opinion that our Con 8titution Act was intended to bo a reflex of the Constitution of Great Britain, and that it waa intended to represent bj the 5Glh sec tion aa near as language could convey the usages and practice of the Imperial Parha ment It waa designed that billa connected with appropriation or taxation should be initiated by mesBago from the Crown, that they Bhould be initiated in the Assembly, and that they should pass through all the stages which thoy passed through in the nouae of Commons, the Council then to havo the power of rejecting but not of alter nig Tho House of Lords still kept up tho obsolete claim to reject such bills, but the difference between that body and the Council was that tho former never exercised the power The Houso of Commons alwass embodied tho various enactmonts of a financial character m one bill Mr CASEY -Not all The Appropriation Bill ib initiated m ways and means as vvoH as tax hills, and they are not united Mr BERRY -Appropriation and taxation did not go together '1 he Appropriation Bill of course waa separate, but since the rejection of the repeal of tho Paper Duties Bill by the House of I ords, a variety of taxes, all dealing with ways and means of tho year, liad been embodied by the Houso of Commons m one bill (" No ) He did not Bay in every case, but m o very great number of cases It was on record that the House of Commons did it to protect their privileges If the matter of the paper duties liad been embodied in a Waya and Mean? Bill covering all the proposals of tho year, matead of being sent up in a separate mea Bure, it could never, havo been rejected by the Houbo of Lords He only mentioned this to illustrate what was the foundation of the agitation which had been going on m this country for the last 10 years with regard to the alteration of the constitution H id both sides been willing to adhere to the customs of the Imperial Parliament no difficulty would have anoen-(hear, hear)-and our constitu- tion would have worked as well as that of the old country 'J ho views of the Opposition were peifcctl) intelligible The English preis, however, put it more plainly, asserting that the Assembly had gone too far m thecxteu mon of the franchise to bo a body to be entrusted with the powers of the House of Commons No writer in England would say that the Assembly did not possess all the towers of the House of Commons, but they and tlic franchise should be altered before the Assembly was allowed to exercise theao powera Mr M INTYRE that effect Mr Bl RRY waa speaking of what dwelt within Ina own memory of what he had read in the 3 nglish presa within the last two years and much more recently Journ ila in this colonj had so vilified the Asacmblj that they had yven a false impression of it to the I ngliflh vinters who imagined th it this was an Assembly unlike the House of Commons nid that it was not fit to

anaen m the liberal ranks on the question under con sideration Mr Uigmbotham and Mr Michie had both placed on record their O'Jinions that our constitution did give authority to paj mouejs on the votes of the AaBembly alone Mr GILLIES -Under a misapprehenaion as to a matter of fact Mr BLRR1 -Thej knew by the report of the proceedings of the framers of the eonati tution that it was their intention to

views of the soundest thinkers and best Iawjera who had studied this matter, and who had given their opinion that, with out any alter ition of the law at all, if we could have a fair interpretation of the Con etitution Statute we should have tho votes of the Assembly made leg illy available It was now a question of expediency rather than law Â\ hen the constitution w is framed it was never imagined that the financial authority of the Assembly would be challenged Members of the Assembly passed a, resolution equivalent to this bth clause in a p-st session Mr GILLIES -Only temporality Mr Bl RUY-This clause would only be temporary, because the very circumstances which gave rise to tho resolution he referred to must exist before it could be operative M ith this section on the statute book there would be no more deadlocks lion membera had to choose between this clause now and the probabilit) of another deadlock with all the 1 ast inconveniences and a great deal more danger added He waa not surprised at the attitude of the Opposition The clause must revive in their memories all the contests be tween the two Chambers m which the) had taken one side and the Government part) the other If the clause vveie rejected that would bo admitting that the Assembly was wrong in all its contests with the other Houso while the acceptmce of it by this Chamber would affirm the contrary, and that the dead locks were brought about partly by the action of the Council and largely by the support and B)mpathy given to that body by bon membera onpoaite M lthout thatcoimtenance no second Chamber could ever havo ventured on the course the Council did four separate times 'lina clause was within the four corners of the rights and privileges of the insult bon memberB by suggesting that the powers

published at home if the same in tímate knowledge of the Bubject prevailed there If the Council continued to perform the functions of a second Chamber like the House of LordB the clause would not come into operation It would only come into operation when there was a deadlock Mr GILLIES said ho would not have thought it worth while to diacuas this danae had it not been for certain remarks of the Chief Secretary Aa that lion member had reiterated statements which had no foundation, he telt bound to say a few words '1 he quotation tho hon member read from the Westminster Revieu m no way

distinguished and able gentle man who at one time evprôsaed a Blmilar oi înion but evidently baaed it on what waa a serious misapprehension lhat misapp e hensionwas thiB namely that it wa3 the practice of the Houae of Commons to autho rise pajment of public monos on resolutions of committee of supply adopted by the House But that misapprehension had been re moved for we now know on the highest authority that such waa not the practice of the HouBe of Commons, and the opinions îeferred to by the lion member were given on an erroneous supposition Mr LALOR-What a the practico of the Houso of Lords ' Mr GILLII S -At present I am dealing with the practice of the Houso of Com mons Mr ANDREW- Yes, stick to a side Mr. GILLIES waa dealing with the main question. In a previous session the Assembly was asked to and did pass a resolution affirm- ing that it was a right and privilego of the House to authorise tho Government to pay public moneys on resolutions of committee of supply reported to and adopted by the Houae. Then the Imperial lawoflicers wore consulted ob to the legality of auch a course, and they declared that, legally, tho House had no auch power. Having appealed unto Caisar, the Government ought to be bound by Ciesar'a decision. Mr. BERRY said the bon. member was not Btating the matter properly. The late Gover- nor Bent home for the opinion on bia own authority, and had simply a memorandum from his Ministora. , Mr. GILLIES.-Exactly. In the signing of warrants for the pay mont of public money a personal responsibility attached to the Gover- nor, and he could not evade such responsi- bility by trying to throw it on his Ministers. Of course the Ministry were aware of that, and that the Governor would do nothing in that direction unless it was perfectly clear that what he did waa legal. Tho Governor told Ministers that, for bis guidance, he muet ask the opinion of the Crown law officers at home and the Mimatry wrote him a memorandum arguing tho q ics tion, and waited for the authority of the Secretary of State for the Colonies empower ing the Governor to do what thej sugLestcd The despatch m reply clearly laid down what tho Government woull now bo com fielled to

and had withdrawn his opinion He was not aware whether the other gentlemen had been iBked whether they still adhered to their former opinion But it was only fair to them to hold that thej attached great weight to the erroneous supposition as to the practice of the HouBe of Commons Now, we knew elearlj that that supposition waa erroneous, and also that the English law officers said that the alleged practice w ould not be legal here T rue, the present Assemblj had passed a resolution affirming the principle advocated bj the Chief Secretary, but when the hon member waa asking the House to do so ho said it was an urgent matter, that the reaolu lion would only be used for tcmporarj pur- poses and that it would not be the perma- nent practice to pas on resolutions or Com mittee of Supply adopted by the nouae 1 ut this clause, now under consideration, would authorise a permanent practice (Op position cheerB ) If the Chief Secretarj wanted the House to pass this clause he should hav e sought to prove that it embodied the practice of the House of Commons, bo cause lie tried to justify his Reform Bill on the plea that it was in accordance with Imperial Parliamentary usage But it waa now elearlj prov ed that tina claiiBO was a departure from the practice of the House of Lorda aa well aa the House of Commons (Opposition cheers ) Rather than see this clause passed, ho would prefer the adoption of ono of the principles of the first Reform Bill of the pre- sent Government-viz , that tho sanction of the Becond branch of the Legislature was un necessary at all That would be a more direct vvoj of nttaining the end the Mmiatrj had in view The present clause, it was true, would onlj como into operation when the Council rejeeted a Supply or Appropriation Lill In other wordB, the

-Thosubject has not been discussed there. Mr GILLIES -nore the discussion had been forced on ua If we were conscious ti at the Imperial Parliament would not sane tion such a thing, that would justify us in re fusing to sanction a similar proposal here If this question could be put bj itself to the country, he was quite certain that the country would refuse to place unlimited and uncon trolled power over the public finances in tlio hands of the Aspemblj (Cheers ) Although in prolmblj 109 cases out of 1,000 there would be no occasion for the Becond branch ot the Legislature to exercise its veto, still he existence of such a right w aa valuablo 'Hub clause would, if carried, bo one of the most serioua mots m um um , nun n >" u(, cunio law, it would ho predicted, bespeedily n pealed But he had not the ghost of a fear that this bill would become law This clauso vv ould he as great an obstacle to its becoming law aa the plebiscite, w hich the Chief Secre (ary now appeared to bo willing to forego I veryone, including the hon gontleman, 1 new that no English statesman would think of advocating tho bill as it stood Sir BRI AN O LOGHLEN -Oh ! Mr GILLIES was not prepared to admit that the Attorney General was the highest nnthont) in this or any other country, and that every other distinguished authority must Bubmit to seeing his ineffectual fires paled before that of the bon gentleman But thore was not the slightest justification for behov- ing that, m the opinion of English statesmen, one proposal or the other conld be adopted The CHAIRMAN said the question of the plébiscite waa not before the committee Mr GILLIES Bald he was not discussing the plebiscite, but merely making a casual re- ference to »t. With regard to the Gth danae, he trusted it would bo dropped altogether The Government had evidently found much difficulty in framing a new clauae, and, after all, he believed the clauao as it stood was more eimple than tho amended one The provisoes referred to two possible contingen- cies, but it would be perfectly immaterial whether those contingencies occurred or not, because under any possible circumstances the Legislative ABsembl) would ho invested with power to vote money without any check or control whatever No greater power than that could be given in any case The mero fact of

member would direct his attention to a few words in the sections them Bclves, he would seo th it the sections did not carry out the contention he had put beforo the committee, and that they wero quito conBiatcnt with the view presented bj Sir Michael Hicks Beach It was shown that these general grants of vvajs and means on íccount during the bcsbioh, in anticipation of the specific appiopriation embodied in the Appropriation Act passed at the closo of tho seBBion, might be viewed aa tho form m winch Parliament considered it most convo nient to convey their sanction to the ad in- terim îBsue of public money ipon tho appro priation directed by the Commons alone ro lying upon their final confirmation being obtained at the close of tho session Tor example, on the 1th and 15th March, 1878 votes amounting to moro than £12,100,000 were granted m supply for the army and navj services of 1878 0 On the 19th March a vote of £12 000,000 m vvojs and means was taken towards making good tho supply granted to ner Majesty for 1878 9, and tins voto was embodied m a ways and means bill, which received the Rojal assent on 28tU March After referring to theso votes for the annual charges for

With regard to the section of the act to which he hon and learned member hud alluded, he thought ho should be able to Bhow that it was only following out the practice mentioned b) Sir Mich iel Hicks Lench, and that it did not give an) more legal effect to the votes than that stated in the iIcbj atch 'Hie saving of the right of the Houpedid not, he thought, nppl) in the way mentioned b) tho Attorne) General It clearly lnid down that the committee of supply granted the mono to the- Crown, but the committee of vva)8 and means provided the nioiic) bj which ti ose services should be laid, and that the resolution ofwajs and means must ultimately he emb idled in an ict of Parliament In Great Britain, the Crown waa able to mticip ite revenue by the isMie of exchequer bills, and the clatiBO of the bill to w Inch the Attorne) General re- ferred simpl) provided as to when exchequer I ills should be issued 'I he iiuthorit) of the amounts granted by a resolution in committee of supplj, nnd after» arda «o^ered bj a w i>s und mema bill I he bon member then, in support of tli.it ir¿umcnt( quoted from the Imperial Act 29 nnd 30 Viet, cap Si), entituled An Act to Consolídate the Duties of the 1] .chequer und Audit Departments, to Kegulnte the Receipt, Cnstod), and Ieaue of .Public Montjs, nnd to Pro* ide for the Audit of the A< counts there- of lhe pro-uso to the 11th section of that act was &B; follows - "Irotldcd alwajs that this enactment shall not bo tcietrucd to empower the Trcisurcr or anj authority tu direct tiic paj nient by anj such prlnclpil accoun tant oí e\\) cudi turc not sanctioned bj anj act «hereby ecrUccs aro or niiij bo charged on tho cona »lidatcu fund, or 1 j a \ otc ol the Houso of Commons, or by an ret for Hit appropriation oí the supputa annually I ranted 1*5 Parliament ' ^ow that clause and proviso stated how money was to be piid into the Treasury, and thej could not, either here or nt home, ¿o to tho Ureasurj and get money out of it without authority, but must have an act of Parliament for thnt purpose Tho lith sec- tion of the same net said - " \\\ hen an> sum or suma oí monoj shall ha\ o boon (.ranted to Her Majestj bj a resolution of tho Houso t f Ct liimon«, or bj" au net of Parliament, to defray ex« innxcs fir anj specified public sen ices, it shall bo hu ful fur Her Majesty from timo to timo, by nor Jîojal order under tho Hojal sign manual, counter smied b\ the lrcasurji to authorise and require tho Irensurj to iesuo out of tho credits to bo granted to them on tho exchequer accounts as hereinafter pro \idid, the euroa which mm bo required from timo to time to defraj auch expenses, not exceeding the suma bo "voted or granted * Now, the word "hereinafter" led up to tho nth section, and the firat portion of it waaaa follows - "When anj wujs and means shall ha\o been ¿.ranted bj Parliament to mike good tho supplies ¿ranted to Her Majesty bj any act of Parliament or resolut» n ol tho Uouso of Commons, tlio comptroller and auditor ¿encrai shall grant to tho Treasurj, on their requisition authorising tho Bamo, a credit or credits cn the exchequer accounts at tho Bank of I noland and Bank of Ireland, or on the growing" 1 alances thereof, not evecoding in tho whola tho amount oí the wajsand means ¿ranted Out of tho vajs ami means tío granted to tho Treasun issuca thftll bo made ' Kow j tho Attornej General knew that ways and means were valueless until tiley were pranted bj an act of Pirhameut, and the 1 Ih section said the monejs were to bo paid w hen vva)B and meanB had been granti d He was not now dealing with tho practice of the two Houses at home but with the assertion c f the Attorne) General that the House of Commons had the legal power he contended fi r, and he submitted the Attorne) General had not shown that it had that le(,al power.

expended, that the vote which took place in the Ilouae of Commons aflirmed the principle of the expenditure, and that once the llouao of Commons had spoken on the matter there was no farther

advice of his Ministers Until that despatch arrived hehadalwnjs been of the same opinion as Messrs Hitmbotham and Michie, but now that the Government had themselves ob toned an authoritative opinion from Eng land, how could they ever ask the Governor to act contrary to its dictum ' Mr LALOR Bald the Government never sent for the opinion of the law oiiicers at home An IIov Memblii -Then Sir George Bowen tells a lie Mr LALOR -But was it a matter of Hw that when they asked an opinion of any person or arbiter that they were bound to Bubmit to it' The practice of the Imperial Parliament was clearly this, that if the House of Commons agreed to a bill of ways ond means for a certain Bum of monej, that Bum of money waa available for the purpose for which it waa voted, and the Government proposition in the Cth clause was simply one to make the constitution of Victoria by act of Parliament the same aa the constitution of Lngland Hon members opposite all ad mitted that the practice of the House of Commons ivas to rule supreme over finance Tho Upper House here, in the exercise of its arrogant power, without right, authority or precedent, and contrary to the practice of the IIouBe of Lords, had dared to reject four Appropriation Bills and had thereby ruined the country aa far as it possibly could for its own political purposes Never bad such action been taken by the Houso of Lorda against

That question however would come on for discuBBion in the next portion of the bill The duty of the Council was not to interfere politically with the Government of the country or with party actions, but to see whether any measures were pasäed by the Assembly hastily or improperly nnd if so, to send them back for reconsideration If the country and the Assembly agreed to such measures a second time, it was then the duty of the Council to bow to their will It was impossible that any constitution could be civilised that allowed two bodies to exist with co ordmate pow ers and responsibilities, and no one Government could be responsible to two Houses Ho hoped, however, that bon mein bera on both sides would join in informing the Council that they should no more reject money bills for mere party and political objects Mr KER17ERD Baid he waa amused in watching how carefully the Commissioner of Customs had walked round his subject with- out once touching on the real question at issue He would not have the slightest hesi tatton in placing the Commissioner in the chair, or a higher place, and submitting to his judgment these two questions-Eirat would the principle of the Cth clause

They had discussed a reform bill last session aud thisseaaion and now they came to a particular clause in the second one Ho thought all bon mern bera had more or less made up their minds about the matter, but as he did not like to give a vote upon a broad question without stating his reason for doing so, ho would say a few words The first thing that struck him was the wonderful amount of con v ersion that had taken place through some leading hon membera being driven to rev ievv their own opinions The first whom he must congratulate on a change of opinion was the Chief Secretary In the year 1861, when the constitution had been in operation onl) a few j ears an amendment was sent down by the then Governor, Sir Henry Barkly, cutting out a clause from the Appropriation Act The present Chief Secre tary then voted m favour of the rejection, vv bilst he and the party with w horn ho was acting resisted it Then again, a practice had Bprung up at that time of spending money on votes of Bupply As soon as it waa discovered that a wrong direction wa3 being followed the course was altered, and from 18G1 to the present time this country, so far as the Assembly w as concerned, had followed tho English practice When he had occasion to support the adoption hero of the practice in the House of Commons ho waa confronted by some bon memberB who differed from him in that respect, and on ono occasion the hon member for Mandurang con tended that in the Houae of Commona money voted in committee of supply was available at once To-night the bon. member had confcBBed that he was then wrong, and that in fact two bills were passed, one toauthonae the expenditure of the money, and another to enable the Government to raise it Now, the Attorney General Bought to bIiow that a roao lution had enabled the English Govern ment to purchase the Suez Canal shares Sir BRYAN O LOGHLEN -I quoted an historical statement which waa correct Sir JOHN OSHANASSY-The lion member had now given up that argument, and would not seek to prove that the shares were purchased on the strength of a reaolu tion of the Houae of Commons to buy thom Ho bad broken down completely in that argument Sir BRYAN O LOGHLEN -I showed that by a resolution of the House the purchase was ratified Sir JOHN OSIIANASSY knew how the bon member wrifcgled out of difficulties, und that would not put him off Ho had shown the conversion of the Chief Secretary and the hon and learned member for Man durang, and that the argument of tho Atttornej General had broken down. In the face of the long discussions that had taken place during the lost two years and with all the legal authorities and precedents in the history of Lngland tho Attorney General hod to rest on another technical objection under the act of 1800 which was enacted to rcgulato tho audit and exchequer businesa of England That act waa pasaed merely to re guíate moro accurately the modo in which monej would be issued by the audit commis Slaney and the w aj in which accounts ahould be furnished to the Government To accept Buch a technical objection showed the weakness of the bon member and his colleagues They bad adduced no argument bj which they could sustain the position they had taken up There could he no hopo that tho clause would ev er become lav Supposing it were put in the bill

and ask our Government why thej wasted the time of the country in asknif, for what could not be granted 1 hey could not, therefore possibly hope that it would be made law On the first reading of the ongi nal Reform Rill the Chief Secretary said he had nothing whatever to do but to go to Lngland and get an enabling bill at once but bow had that prophecy been fulfilled He believed that the case attempted tobe made out bj the Government had completely broken dow n and it w as his intention to v, oto against the bill Mr RICHARDSON argued that the opinions of Messrs Teltows, Michie and Hifcinbotham which were given many years ago to the effect that money was legally available on the 'passing of votes in com mittee of supply, was based not merelj on the practice of the House of Commons but also on the Constitution Act itself Ihehon member for Mandurang he said had also contended the same thing on a former occa sion in that House though he seemed to hav e chanted his opinion on the authority of the despatch receiv ed here since the embassy went to J ngland lhat practice ceased after the O Shanaasy Government altered it but ever Bincc then it had been contended by learned men and men \ ersed in constitutional law, as well as bj the Liberal partj in this countrj, that there w as the right to pay on the votes of the Assembly alone Sir JOHN O SHAN ASSY -On what autho nty Mr RICHARDSON contended that the House of Commons had the riL,ht to control finance, and that it practically did so Al though the House of Lords claimed the right to reject money bills, they only claimed it, and never exercised it Sir JOHN O SHANASSY -They are not prov oked to do it Mr RICHARDSON said they knew better than to be provoked, and the people of Lng land would not permit them to do what the Upper House here did I he Gth clause was onlj intended to put the Assembly in the same position as the House of Commons was in and if the Legislative Council took the same course here as the House of Lords did, thej would not now be seeking to reform the j constitution They wanted the Gth clause to restrain the Legislative Council exercising that power which, though the House of Lords claimed it never exercised It was said there would be danger in adopting the Oth clause, and the bon member for Belfast bad asked where it would lead to He con tended that the clause was not a demand that money should be paid on the vote of the Assembly alone and that it was only in tended to be put into operation when a dead lock occurred The bon member for Belfast had b»en Chief Secretary Beveral times and he knew well that a Government at all times sought to prevent a deadlock that it tried at all times to be in the position of having its bills passed bj the Legislative Council and that when a deadlock took place it led to the displacement of a Government Sir JOHN O SHANASSY -Nonsense it kept a Government m for five years Mr RICHARDSON did not think ao Sr JOHN O SHANASSY-It kept the M Culloch Government in that time Mr RICHARDSON said that Government got into a trouble which very few members of the HouBe now would bo prepared to enter upon Ab he said the Cth clauao would only be used when a deadlock took place and it would only have the eflect of pajing the Bet vices of the jear and keeping the Government of the countrj going on Supposing thi3 Oth clause had been in operation vvh"n, as some bon members contended, the tariff was tacked to the Appropriation Bill Mr GAUNSON -Suppose it was m opera tion when pajment of members was tacked to the Appropriation Bill Mr RICHARDSON replied that the in stance the bon member for Ararat referred to would Bcurcelj be a fair one for him to use, because it waa affirmed in the Leysla tive Council that an arrangement had been made to throw out payment of members with the expressed intention of placing the government of the countrj m other hands But if the Cth clause had bi.en in operation when the Tariff BiU waa sent up with the Appropriation Bill, the Council would have gained the object they had in view They would have defeated that tariff, at all events for a time and they would not have stopped the whole buBineaa of the country It had been represented that the Cth clause would fcive uuchecked control to the Assembly over the finances-(hear, hear)-but not a single illustration or argument had been giv en to show that. Sir JOHN O SHANASSY-You say this House ought to have it Mr RICHARDSON -Vi eil, the majority of that Chamber represented he majority of the people and was it intended to check the ma jority of the country by the loinonty ' It was contrary to responsible go ernment that the majority of the people he-<ä should be checked by the Legislative Council The hon mern her for Mandurang had supposed that if the Gth clause were passed a Government raient pay the members who supported it £oOO each, and give their opponents in the Houae nothing, but sneh a state of things could not be imagined Suppoamg, however, a Government attempted any such thing what would have to bo done with the vote before effect could bo given to it' It would have to be put into the Appropria tion Bill, and go through aU the forms through which votes bad to pass, and could it then be supposed that it would be c'lowed to do so if it were a corrupt item, and con trary to the well being of the colony' The whole argument however, must come back to this point, that what the people had to contend with was an attempt on the part of a small minority to rule the majority of this country The Council had never acted as a proper check on that Chamber They never checked the ¿10,000 fo- tho Warrnambool Breakwater or tb» expenditure incurred in the construction of the Beechworth Railway The only sums they checked were such as had been asked for by the majority of the people lhe 0th clauBe bad not been considered from the proper point of view It had nothing to do with taking pow er from the people, and placing it in the hands of the Assembly It did not even increase the power of that chamber, but simply limited the control exercised over them by the Council Dr MADDEN said he waa atill of opinion that the Cth clause was wholly unacceptable to the country and unconstitutional, but inasmuch as that question had been argued again and again, and as the House was not a suitable tribunal to which he could address egal arguments, he would at present refrain Irom dealing with the legal aspect of the case, and should oppoBO the clause for two other reasons T he first w as, that even if the clause was carried into law, it would bo absolutely ineffectual for the accomplishment of the end for w Inch it was designed, inas much as it aimed only at the ques tion of supply, and in no way at vvaja and means If carried, it might poBBibly have the effect of preventing the Council from rejecting appropriation billa, but it could in no way prevent them from rejecting a taxation bill. That being so they would not be a whit the better after tho measure waB passed Tbo Attorney General waa Bhaking his bead, and was doubtless looking at the matter m this way, viz, the clause would prevent deadlocks, aa deadlocks would not anae on the rejection of taxation tulls But that was no answer, for this lamentable state of things would be brought about, that the Government, after resolving on the expenditure of the year, and deciding in ways and means upon the method in which they would raise the fundB necessary to meet the expenditure, Bend their ways and meana bill to the Council but have it at once re turned on their hands, the Council saying - "We cannot resist your expenditure, but we will throw out your ways and means altogether, and bo your resolutions in com nuttce of supply will amount to nothing' lhe Government would thus bo driven insolvent in spite of themselves, be- cause they vvoulu be unable to raise tho money necessary to pay their debts But even in the case of the rejection of an appro pnation bill, a deadlock did not necessarily follow, for although it would undoubtedly cause the cr ii Bcrvauts and Government contractors a great dca! of inconvenience, yet they, as they had done m the post, would be willing to wait for their money It was the Bamc to them in short, if an uppropna tion or ways and moana bill waa rejected Consequently, it waa just aa important that the rejection of a waysand means bill should be prevented as the rejection of an appro pnation bill The sixth clause would there fore be ineffectual Sir BRYAN 0 LOGHLEN -It doca not go far enough ' Dr MADDEN -It went a great deal too far for another reason A Government might Bay -"We know very weh that the Coun eil won t allow us to impose taxation to meet the reckleaa expenditure w e are going to incur , but let ua hav e a free run on the regular income of the atate, and the only result wiR be that our succesaora will have to meet a very handaome deficiency, which, however, will not trouble us (Hear, hear ) The clause would, moreover, really leave m the banda of the Aeaembly the whole control of tho public funda If the clause were accompanied by another which imposed heavy penalties on membera who misapplied the public fundB, and provided for the ira peachment of such members, he might bo disposed to sa) that that would not be a w holly unacceptable Buggestion It had been said that an argument of this sort assumed corruption on the part of bon members He did not assume the corruption of membera in the rude and bald meaning of the item , but there was not a man m that House who was not amenable and subject to a different kind of corruption lor matance. waa it impro bable that constituents would apeak to their representative in tina was- »o are not bothered about reform or any other large question of politics, but here we want a bridge, get it made (Hear, hear ) If such a member were a man whom the Government dared not offend, the money for the bridge would be at once placed on the Lstimates and even if ho were a ' nobody in the House tho bridge would be forthcoming na soon aa bis vote was required (Hear, hear) Now, that was a kind of cor ruption beyond all doubt, and the result vv ould bo the plundering of the state for the \ i rsonal mterestof the Government of the day, and that the moBt reckless and unrestrained extravagance would necessarily be resorted to It might be argued that after all the clause was but a poor aflair, and would do no harm, for the ver) placing of it on the Statute book would prevent the nccessit) for its use He held, however, that it would be capable of doing the utmoBt mischief, because when ever a Government desired to lay binda on a large sum of money all they would have to do would be to put the Bum on the Lsti mateB side by side with an unobjectionable principio The Council might reject it, but the money would be gone, and the principle vv ould bo ignored 1 or all these reasons, and apart altogether from the legal aspect of the case, he held that tho clause waa not one iota better than it waa when the bill passed ltB Becond reading Mr DOW said that when the Chief Secre tar) spoke he called upon his supporters to vote for the Gth clause, because they voted for a similar one last Bession When they voted for it in the first instance however, the country was in the midBt of a dead lock, and they could bo moro logically aslted to do such things to get out of such a difficulty than to do them when they were tr)ing to reform the constitution with the v lew of prev entmg deadlocks 1 hey had at present a strong Government in oflice, and that Government was responsible for the use ofthat power to carr} a proper scheme of reform It was their dut), then to bring m such a scheme and not to be making their supporters vote under protest, and go to the countrj in such a w ay that their strength would be divided Whatever scheme the Ministry proposed would havo to be sub stantially endorsed by the country before it could become law The Government sup porters wanted not only to solve deadlocks but if posBiblo to prevent their occurrence The Commissioner of Customs had said that if the Gth clause were carried the plebiscite would not he required No doubt there was a great deal of truth in that statement, but was the country in favour of that wa) of reform ' He (Air Dow) behoved that the majority in the countr) believed that the pli.bwcdi' was as good a way of solving deadlocks as the Gth clause In every place he had visited, the electors vs ere decidedl) opposed to an) thing like the abolition of the second Chamber (Hear hear) They wished, they said, to be go xerned in the way the people were governed at home-with two Chambers, one Chamber exercising a due check on the other He con- tended that tho Gth clause would not briu0 about that result As a money bill was any measure that the Assembly chose to so term, the phbiscitt of the Gth clause could be of no use, because it would nev er have to be put into operation The Council ought to have duo power ov er the Assembly, as the House of Lords had over the House of Commons \et he was not an advocate for the Upper House, for he was quite willing to go as far as an) other member to overcome its obstructive ness Let them glance back to the origin of the reform scheme It was said that our constitution required reform because there waa a Haw in it deadlocks being possible In Lngland there waa a safet) valve but here we had nothing of that sort. The more the people thought of the plebiscite the simpler and more eflectual it appeared to their minda, and they took to it Ile aaaerted that the plebibcile in its original acceptation was the most popular portion of the Government bill ThiB Ministry was responsible to a large ex tent for making the name plébiscite un popular with the Imperial Government In stead of keeping the plébiscite in ita original position aa a simple means of unlocking a deadlock when it occurred, it had been mixed up with other matters Other matters affecting the constitution could hav e been left alone, and when Parha ment had broken down, the plébiscite could have been brought in as a means of getting over the difficulty Instead of adopting that course the Government brought m this Gth clauBe ob a means by which the Upper Houae would be abolished altogether, and then, of course, there would bo no deadlocks Under thiB system, if anything were objected to, all that waa neceasary »vas to tack it on to an

the bill, not upon its merits, because the people believed they were sincere in a desire to pass it, and because they would rather have the Government bill, bad aa it was, than have another carried by any other party in the Houee Mr \ OUN G -W by do you vote for it ' Mr DOW -Because there waa no party on hiB side of the House to carry out his views, and because he was not going to split up the Liberal party for the benefit of lion membera opposite (Ministerial cheers ) It must be remembered that the people were thoroughly well informed as to what occurred m that House The reporters and leader writers of the press were the most important members of Parliament (Cheers ) He repeated that the people would say of this bill, " of two evila choose the least ' Mr KERI ERD -Carlton did not say so to day Mr DOW suggested, with regard to the Gth clause, that it would be more reasonable before going to the country to accept sug- gestions from the Upper House There would be much less danger of a deadlock if the franchiso of the Upper Houae were broadened The nominee 8)atem waB out of character with the Gth clause, and if that clause were carried the plébiscite waa not wanted The people did not want the con- stitution pulled down to be built up again They simply wanted the fact recognised that there waa a danger of deadlocks occurring, and that when they did occur there should be some means of getting over the difficult) Reform of the constitution did not mean de etruction of the constitution Mr ERANCI8 -You are voting under com- pulsion Mr DOW -No, certainly not He re gretted to have to say that a man who ox pressed his views on the Government side of tho House was not bo well treated as a mere automaton, and it was an injury to the liberal party that such a feeling should go abroad His electorate would doubly support the Government bill if it came before the country, but it would be under protest Mr ERASER -It never will go to the country Mr DOW.-It will, because of course we shall rally up (Laughter ) There would be a rall) up, and direct opposition would have no Bhcw He should vote against the 6th clause The Carlton election that day was against it (Criea of "No" and "Yea') What was contended for in the 6th clause, the Lower Houses power of the parse, had never in reality been called in question by the Upper Houbo, as waa shown hy the fact that tho deadlocka had never taken place upon pure voteB of supply, or upon votes re quired for the actual current service of the year Obstructivo as the elements had been in the Upper Houae, the three deadlocka that bad occurred bad a reasonably argu mtntative boaia in each case He would urge the Government to abandon the 6th clause as unnecessary, and roly upon the poll of the people principle He would vote against the clause, because it w ob unnecessary and undesirable As the bill would hat e to bo amended by the next Par Iinment why not submit it for amendment now' He would toto for the third leading of the bill, not because be believed in it, but because be didn't want, aa a liberal to throw himself into tho bands of tho party of the Government that was ousted on the 11th of May He

The bon member, who spoke of the reform of the House of CommonB, should have learned that the people had v ery little indeed to do with that reform In the time of Henry VI the franchise waa reduced to freeholders of £40 a j ear, and from that time to 1832 there waa no change m the suffrage That being so, bow many \otera were there when Pitt said that if tho House of Commons wore not reformed from withm it would be reformed from without?

House repre sented the people of the country, because there were largo numbera of persons who were legally qualified to vote whoso names wero not upon the roll By this clause it was proposed to ride rough- shod over the people of the colony, and he could not and would not voto for it Thero was no more dangerous fallacy than the expression "the will of the people," and he was amazed that the hon. member for Castle- maine (Professor Pearson) could for a moment sanction the pernicious attempt to sap the liberties of the country. The liberties of England had not been won by the people, but >y the statesmen, He believed that this hill would bring into operation a blight ten thousand times worse and more disastrous than the Berry blight had ever been upon the countr) Profcasor PEARSON said the hon member for Kara Kara had given such a meaning, that if he regarded it in the same sense he should bo unablo to vote with the Govern ment ile was. however, relieved by finding that not only the Government, but alao the lion member for Sandridge, took a very dif- ferent view of the matter So far from thinking that the clauao would allow an) bill to be passed over the heads of the Council, the lion member for Sandridge held that the one fault of the measure was that it waa in adequate for its purpose He (Professor Pearson) believed that the bill would not have much effect, but would produce some good and some evil, which was as much as could bo said of most measures In the first placo the clause applied simply to the Appro pnation Bill and billa of supply sent up from time to time Sir BRYAN O LOGnLEN -near, hear Professor PEARSON-As the Attorne) General cheered, he presumed that was the intention of the Government If confined simpl) to that, it would havo one effect which would be entirely good It would make tacks impossible, because if any bill vv ere submitted w ith extraneous matter tacked on the Council would no longer have tho BhghteBt hesit ition in throwing it out, know nig that the public service would not bo in jured The Assembl) was thereforo preclud ing itself from tacking on extraneous matter

truth in that charge, but the bon member Bhould remem her that our constitution was not thoroughly on the lines of the British constitution, and ih it it wis ibaolutel) impossible to repro due e an)

had adopted the J nghsh phraseologj, as it failed to bear the same meaning here aa when ipphed to the House of Commons Hie Legislative Council was not like the House of LordB. where every member was absolutely independent, and obstruction could not ha long continued In the House of Commona the members stood bj their own weight, and they had at their hack no1 only the Commona but also the Crown and the traditiona of centuiies The Assembly, on the other hand, was not certain that they had the Crown , they had the nation, but the) certaml) had not the support of tradi tions during the few )ears the constitution had existed Therefore the Government was compelled in its own despite to full back upon other expedients The Gth clause was proposed m order to make up for the in- herent weakness arising from our circum Btauces as a commumts (Hear, hear ) The bon member had used another argument which he (Professor Pearson) believed to be a most fallacious one, namely, that a second Chamber waa a check upon finan cial extravagance Hie House of Lords had a thousand merits, ho would grant It had been the great bulwark of the constitu tion at times, and it had also been the gre it bulwark of irrational couserv atism at other times, but he could not recall a single instance where the House of Peers had guarded the country against financial extravagance The House ot Lords had interfered when its pnv lieges had been v lolated, had rejected bills containing money provisions because they were composite bills or for some other reason, but it had always been very unwilling to provoke a collision with the other House Hie mere fact that it had not the right of amending, and that its right to reject had been at least disputed, made it exceedingly cautious not to provoke a conflict with the other House and it was least efficient in matters of finance Hie bon member quoted various instances of British history in the past, such as the granting of land m Ireland, the speculations in the South Sea Bubble, and the heavy ex lenditureon the 1 reneh wara to show that the House of Lords had never interfered to check extravagance Ile also mentioned that the senate of the United States did not interfere to prevent the Bland Silver Bill, which virtuall) proposed to pa) the creditors of the States with the silver dollar, although it was onlj 8C cents, as an inatanco of a second chamber not interfering with financial mattera lhere might be good qualities in the second Chamber, and he waa not arguing against that, but only that ni the particular line of checking extravagance ¡io» find chamber waa not a success There might, however, be a check of a different kind against extravagance, but as theChairmanhad ruled they could not discuss the plébiscite at that stage Ho would vote for the Government measure with a perfectly clear conscience, because the apeechea mado from the opposite side of the House had thoroughly convinced him that though the Opposition might be prepared to substitute some other measure for the Government scheme, they would not give that part of the Government measure he was referring to, and which he cordi illy approved of, even ni the state in which it appeared in the Govern ment measure Mr COOPER remarked that the lion member who eat down said the Gth clause might do a little good and a little harm, but aurel) that was no excuse for such a radical i îece of legislation aa the clause was If that was the only argument which could be used by one of the most learned members on the Ministerial side of the HouBe in support of the clause, Ministers could not Hatter themselves on the argu ments of their friends There had indeed been no argument put forward either by the hon member for Castlemaine or by an)one on the Government side of the House to justify such a radical alteration of the constitution as the clause proposed, and the Ministry were certainly not justified in proposing it He had been surprised at the argument of the bon member for Kara Kara (Mr Dow) That hon member objected to the clause, but yet he said he would vote for the bill oven if the clause were in corporated in it If there was an) thing cal- culated to demoralise public men in this country, and to prepare for that 8) atom of corruption, and the toadyism which must inevitably follow, it waa tho Byatem of politics propounded by the bon mem- ber for Kara Kara To him (Mr Cooper) the Gth clauae appeared to bo involved and impracticable It provided that on the rejection of an appropriation bill that House should again go into committee of supply and revote resolutions it had already passed That, however, was a proceeding which could not be carried out, as it was contrary to the Btandmg orders The clause would therefore be uBeleaa The Govern- ment pretended that it waa an improvement on tho one originally proposed, but instead of being that, it was more objectionable and more offensiv e to the Upper House than ev or lhe first one distinctly stated that tho Council should bave no voice in the pass- ing of money bills, thia ono aUowed them to say "Yes' or "No," but told them that the money would be ex- pended, no matter what their answer might be Ho (Mr Cooper) objected to the clause because it dealt unfairly with both nouBea, becauae it was opposed to the prac- tice of the House of Commons, because it would place the whole control of the finances m the hands of the Ministry of the day, and thereby place the colony under a dictatorship of nine men, because it would be dangerous in its results to the best interests of the country, and to the liberties of the people Mr TUCKER said he had listened carefully to the arguments of the Opposition, but had failed to hear any of them say what the nouBe of Commons would do in tho event of an Appropriation Bill being rejected by the House of Lorda (Hear, hear ) He fancied the gentlemen who argued from a conserva- tive point of view would bo nonplused to indicate the proceeding that the Commona would take if their Appropriation Bill waa throw n out three or four times It had always been assumed that the ABBembly waa corrupt Well, tbey all knew that there had been questionable votes passed by that Chamber, but never had a solitary one of such votea been rejected by the Upper Houae The Council only rejected votes when they desired to give a blow to some political party. Ho had come to tne conclusion that there was no other course open to him than that of supporting the Gth clause. He regretted that there waa any neceaaity for such a clauBe, but the dealings of the Upper House had mado it abaolutely necessary that some thing ahould be done to put a Btop to the obBtaclea thrown m the way of legislation. He did not think that the people of this colony wanted anything more than fairnesB and justice. The public dislike of the nominee B)Btem waa founded upon the objection to the nominee principle of the old Legislative Council, which framed the constitution That waa an act of tyranny which this colony had groaned under ever since He looked upon the 6th clause now before the House ns the beat method yet devised for the prevention of deadlocks. Mr BLACKETT thought that if more of the spirit of patience, moderation, and con- ciliation had been shown on both sidea in times past, it would have been better for the public interests (Hear, hear ) He could not vote for the 6th clauBe, because it gave to the Assembly more powers than were claimed by the Houae of Commona He be- llo) ed in going on the old principle of gradually improving The privileges of tlio people would not be preserved if tins clause became law The constitution should bo built upon the lines of the British constitu tion and not be improved oil the face of tho earth Mr MURRAY SMITH said he could under stand the argument of the bon member for Collingwood which was clear enough, and also that of Professor PcarBon, who admitted that the proposal of tho Cth clause was neither leyil here nor in accordance with tho practice of the Houso of Commons The lUegahty of it had been proved here over and over again, and he presumed the Govern ment would admit that lhe Attorney.
