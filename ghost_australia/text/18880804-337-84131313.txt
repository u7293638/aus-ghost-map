White Heather and Eucalyptus. [WbITTEN FOR " FlGABO."] Only a spray of transoceaned heather, Shrunk in bloom by the sunny weather Of the Land of tbe Waxing Star; We send it over the weltering water, In woe for the heart of our widowed daughter, Who weeps by her Kaiser's car. When that be wooed her be plucked white heither, Climbing the Homeland's hills together, Omen of luck for his wooing royal; White was the tpray, and white he wore it, White to the last unstained he bore it, Ruler and husband, leal and loyal, I ay at his feet this spray of heather, Twine eucalypt and it together, From the Knights of the Golden Fleece, Who are the Sons of the Mists, and the Mountains, Sons of the Isles, and the Woods, and the Fountains, Adorers of heroes, of peace. Wail we a coronach weird together, For the hero worth eucalypt and heather, The Foiler of Fiery-eyed Will, Who, callii g on Ghost of the God of Battlf s, Slakps the Earth-god's thirst, when his hell-hail rattles, While we wail for dead, " Peace, be ttill! " k. d. Maryborough, July, 1888.
