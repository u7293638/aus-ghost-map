AN HOTEL GHOST. Most people are sufficiently super- stitious to attach some credence to a ghost story, whether it emanates from Mrs. Crowley's Nightside of Nature, or be of local origin. But possibly because, it might have the effect of driving away custom, it seldom trans- pires that a ghost has selected for its habitat the bar-room of a public house. It could have only been the fear of paying a heavy penalty for trading after hours which induced the licensee of the Fitzroy Club Hotel, Brunswick-street, to endeavor to persuade the Fitzroy bench on Thurs- day last, that "a man in the bar" sworn to by several policemen, was a spirit of the air, which had been drawn into the bar by the attraction, possibly, of other spirits of a convivial turn. The licensee, however, was not super- stitious, and explained, as a matter of fact, that what the police had seen was neither a man nor his ghost. It was simply the reflection cast on the walls ofthe bar room by persons passing between the bar door and the bar parlour. The bench preferred not to accept this explanation, and imposed a fine of £5, which, at the instance of the defendant's solicitor, was increased to £5 5s, so as to admit of an appeal.
