BLIND SOCIETY LAYS A GHOST. We have had quite a number of annual meetings of one sort and another, and among tbe most interesting was that of the Blind, Deaf and Dumb Society, which Society, by the way. Archdeacon Whitington credits with having taken a decided step towards laying that irritating Ghost yclept " North versus South." This year the two Secretaries in Launceston and Hobart adopted the happy plan -of presenting a joint report deal ing with the Societv's operations as a whole thus avoiding the comparisons which are "odorouB." Herein the venerable Archdeacon thinks he sees the little leaven which may leaven the whole lump, but we trow not. If both communities were themselves blind, deaf and dnmb then might these things bebut it would be dreadfully dull those times. Bishop Montgomery worked off a little joke ou that same occasion, remarking affliction was not always disadvantageous as he hal already discovered that in Tasmania one of the first qualifications of a clergyman was that he should be deaf. Uufortnnately for his lordship nine tenths of his audiences werewoman- kind and the dubious smiles that followed the witticism augured ill for his next parochial visits.
