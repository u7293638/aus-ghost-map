TIIE EX*EMPEILOR, NAPOLEON III. T?he Times, speaking of tile Emperor Napoleon, observes : "'The character of Napoleon Ill, will long remain one of tile enigmas of bistory. \Yeaker in its comrposition t tha that of his unole, it will be universally allowed hereafter-as thcese who can rise above projudice allow nowt-that it coutains botteur elements. No misgivings over dis. turbeod the oserene sellishness of the first ]Emperor. lie could sacorilice armies and nations without compunction. The ghosts of thebo tens of thousands who died for hiis ends rover haunted his conscience, Ha could leave an aruy burried in the snows of Russia, and warm liis hands before a lire atu Warsaw with no other thought than ' This is betteor than Mloscow.' The exile who will soon bo amrong us possesses little of this dompaot strength. Always halting and irresolute of purpose, and never more so than during the last months of his reign, he has boon averse to war, and otinly entered into tlioe contest ,.ith Germany because 'he dreaded thie reseontment of France. In his heart he has believed in the fulllhtent of tio oloudy dreams of his early marnhood, [lo noticipated France in the inaugura. nion of freeoo trade, as we ahall probahly obtn find hy the adopting of a retrograde policy. His avowedi detelostation of the Treaties of 1815 was in a confursed way mixed up with thIe rights of nationalities upon which bhe rested his olaim to rule France. If, indeed, we compare trhe pre present fugitive with the orefugeeoos of 1880 and 1848,napart froni the terrible disastersi which his last great fault hlas brought upon Fruanoo, we may be induced to thiqk that Ihe deserves to be received witrh iso mrueh respect as they. Thie Citizon King showed how little he caredi for thie inte. rests if millions when he saorificed Spain to onrich a son, and Chairles X. was inuo: contly incapable of looking upon subjects oxoept as multitudes born to obey his will."
