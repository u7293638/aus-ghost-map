THE MASQUERADE BALL. FHOJF A CONTRIBUTOR. I was present at the Masquerade on Monday evening, and was delighted at the splendid costumes worn by the ladies and gentlemen. It formed a pretty and pleasing sight to see so many persons, old and young, enjoy themselves so heartily. There were a number of the costumes that were really magnificent, one or two of the ladies being remarkable for the singularity of their dresses. We had a ghost ; but he, she, or it suddenly disappeared before the time for removing masks, which took place about 11 o'clock, probably anxious to fraternise with some kiudred spirits before the pub. closed. There were daughters of the regiment, Vivianders school girls, ladies of honor with train and without, sonie of them wore waterfalls (uiy old woman says not, but I am / positive they Tdid^^.the/Mret^fylfgiund a riunibef o£ them injtiie Jibrary after the ball was .jOv^r* j&ud; theyr must; ihave.i been left hempd by some'of the ladies).
