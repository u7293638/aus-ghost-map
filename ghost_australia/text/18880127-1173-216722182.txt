A JUBILEE GHOST. g u I ~ t g gir-SomeTime ago Triced in one of our issues that somebody was scared at he appearance of a Jubilee Ghost around he wood heaps at Ballarat Row. I hought it had disappeared, but it seems he ghost has been slowly travelling ever ince, and has got down as far as the xhibition Grounds. It happened one ight lately that someone in the neighborood had reason to go outside at a quarter o eleven, or thereabout, when, to his urprise, someone was busy at the wood eap. He not only saw the tail of bis hostship, but had a full view of him. I ould advise this gho^t to stay at home, as he householders have patent ghost atchers and he might make anexit minua is tail.â€”Yours, etc., f a c STUMPS.
