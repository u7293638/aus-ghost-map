ITALY. (turned out OWN couucsroKDEyT.y HOME, Nov. 23, 1873. Of course, the tidings of the attempt on the life of King Humbert will have reached you long before these lines can do so But her the impression 13 still so strong that nothing else is in men's minds or mouths Of course it cannot be doubted that the crime, coming so immediately after the two attempts on the life of the Emperor of Oer many and that on the King of Spain will produce a very widespread result and strong feeling of indignation almost of his inn) throughout Europe Nothing, however can be more certain to in that this wretched V issan inte s crime has been and will be more serviceable to the cause of monarchy rather; than any cv cut that could have happened I am amount of loyal feeling that it has called forth has been something extraordinary 'The news reached Rome by a telegram addressed to the Home Office at halfpast 8 01 the evening of Sunday the 17th November By half- past 'I there was an immense demonstration 111 the streets by many though Is of citizens of all classes eager to signify their abhorrence of the crime Bags weighing from the windows along the Corso The houses were illuminate 1 Women were waving hand kerchiefs from the balconies thousands of voices were shouted, "Viva ii Ko ' Viva Umberto Vivo Cairoli ' Morta all assassins An enormous multitude with a band at their head marched up to the Capitol, where the Syndic came out on to the balcony and promised to telegraph then gratulations to the King. and Queen And all this was the work of one hour Never was there anything so spoil taneous, so unprepared And from every city throughout Italy tidings came 111 of similar demonstrations telegrams of coil' atulation from public bodies and private indi- v duals poured in by the thousand and one ambassador, Sir Augustus Paget in obedience to special telegraphed instructions from the Queen, went down to Naples to offer but expressions of sympathy to King Humbert and Queen Margherita At the same time there are ugly symptoms, which show very unmistakably that the differ thrust of this wretched Paasanante is not, as he in his examination would fam cause it to be believed, an isolated fact, but that it is one manifestation of a vast plot against the entire fabric of society as at present constituted On the night of the 18th at 1 Florence, a meeting of some thousands of workmen had been organised to express their sentiments of loyalty to the Crown, and abhorrence for the attempt on the life of the King They were marching professionally from the Piazza doll Independents to the residence of the Prefect, when from the window of a house a bombshell was thrown into the midst of them killing two men on the spot and wounding many others 'the murderers did not, however, succeed in preventing the accomplishment, of the object of the demonstration The procession continued their route to the Prefect H house, when that functionary, 111 reply to their expressions of affection towards the monarch), said, among other things, that the King would be as much grieved to hear of this murderous attack on them as they had been to hear of that on him I trust that I may be able in my next letter to tell you that the author or authors of this infamous act have been discovered Meantime it may be remarked that Florence is well known to be the head quarters of the operations of the International Society in Italy As another symptom of the condition of things in this part of the world, it is perhaps worth while to send you 1 trans lation of a document which has been recently circulated among the working classes at Naples " A\ orkmen, does hunger pinch you ' Does the want of work disquiet you Are the lives and honour of your sons and your women dear to you' Does the tyranny, the cow arches, and the greed of your masters irritate you' Does the yoke of the capitalists, usurers, and the Government which starves you weigh heavily on your heel s' Are your hearts oppressed by the thought of your dignity trampled on your honour offended, and sour every right set at naught' then leave off talking and make a revolution When will you be weary of praying, beseeching and supply eating' Your masters laugh you to scorn Have you no blood in your veins ' Sons of Masaniello where are you Leave off talking and make a revolution helped that millions of your companions are suffering They have come to a resolution Already a vast party of workmen has been formed strong, powerful, and extending over ever) country-which 13 terrifying the masters who oppress y 011 ' Join them and fight ' One single decisive struggle will save you and your families from many years of misery then leave off talking, and make a revolution 3093 of Masaniello, arise ' Who can resist the terrible impetus of a people in in subjection, and the yet more terrible force of despair ' Rise, men and women alike, young and old raise, all of you' Ina Unta na zonale, and hurrah for the workmens le v solution Of course there is not the smallest chance that any such attempt should end otherwise than in the prompt quelling of it, and the ruin and misery of all concerned in it, and toy little chance indeed that it should be attempted 'The King and Queen, on the other hand, will, when they return to Rome to morrow evening, receive such an ovation as has been seldom seen. It is a pity that it will be just too late for me to give you my account of it in this letter But the Roman world, meanwhile returning from its long vacation has come back to Rome to find the Eternal City under water or not far from it We have been having most disastrous floods November is the month in which old Tather'liber is most in the habit of playing his old-and modern tricks And this year he has been going on quite in the old style, and ever since 1876 the date of his last excesses-we have been talking so much about the necessity of taking steps for keeping him within bounds, and discussing the means of doing so ' It is true that we did not begin to do any thing till a few months ago Then, after some seven years spent in studies, we began the work by cutting a deep trench close to the course of the stream, immediately above the Porte SiBto, and beginning to build in that the wall which was to form a river side quay, and at the same time widen and straighten the course of the stream the gardens and groves of the beautiful 1 Ernestina Palace, now the property of the King of Naples, existed at this spot And it has gone to the heart of many to see the fine trees which made the river bank beautiful at this point destroyed But of course, if necessary for the saving of Rome from periodical floods, they had to fall Only it seemed a pity after seven years talking to begin just then And now liber Ina laughed to scorn the little attempt to control his agonies The torrent has burst into the cutting, overthrown all the work, and was whirled away many tons of huge beams and other appurtenances of the work A poor wrecked steam engine may be seen protruding the summit of its chimney above the swirling of the pea soup coloured torrent And when the waters shall have subsided, it will be found that all the cutting has been filled, and all the commencement of the wall buried beneath a vast superincumbent mass of drift and earth No sort of play sion had been made for the protection of the works from any such disaster The workmen were not in time, the papers remark, to save any portion of the work and its appurtenances it being only some two or three thousand years that they have had warning of the probability of such a catastrophe A case than this however, is the mischief done to the dwellings of the poorest classes of the citizens there is the miserable " Ghetto the Jews quieter still inhabited by them by force Ion" habit though no longer in obedience law-all under water And the wretched habitants arednv an out of their dw allinga 1 1 ooded rats glad to find a team or any shed in certain huge empty buildings com ei once upon a time of course-up it I Icrmim as the locale of Diocletian to bail in the immediate neighbourhood of the r way station is called which have been in by the municipality in the disposition of t homeless A strange contrast truly is presented Home I ceded by Want, J In aid Koi flooded by its ordinary sunshine And the who have no v seen Home for the first in under its recent circumstances are not like to and themselves easily of the uni ress produced by it.

At half-past 5 in the evening of the 1 5th the municipality) but out a placard informing the citizens that their advices from the towns the upper valley of the Tiber led to the conclusion that the

run off and it may be hoped that the danger is over for this time in the political world there is as yet It's worth communicating The Chambers will meet after their nearly five months vacation on the 21st in the meanwhile it may b mentioned that a very decided and official contradiction has been given to the assertion of our Gladatonian radicals at home to the effect that the Italian member of the Rhodope Commission had not signed the report which convicts the R Usman arm; of such atrocious and unheard of excesses of cruelty Your readers will understand why the English radicals have been extremely annoyed at this report we have striven in every to minimise the importance of it One of their efforts in the direction was to added that not only the Russian and German commissioners had declined to sign the new port but the Italian member of the commission had also as Stained from adding his signature to those of the 1 English French and Turkish commissioners Tim has now been oneal) contra dicted here to the great discomfiture of our Pusaoplnles The report was feigned am vouched for by the Itali a commissioner as by his colleagues The dead low water of our long vacation has also latterly been stirred a little by speeches addressed to their constituents by Signor Cairoli our Prime Minister alive by Signor Minghetti the late Minister of 1 France and leader of the Opposition it Legnago and lastly by Signor Cansdell the Minister of Home Affairs at Isca Every body respects and likes Signor Cairoli His patriotism is unsuspected and Ina private worth universally) acknowledged But few can be found to maintain that he is of the material from which statesmen are made And his speech was in one word a fi lluro-weitk water) vague and meaning nothing very different indeed W18 the discourse of Signor Minghetti It was perhaps the best and most important speech which has been heard in Italy for the last two years He first turned his attention to his own especial blanch fina ice and showed only too clearly that the am plus promised by Signor Seismit Dondi Signor Carroll 8 Finance Minister is ill moonshine and that if the financial year is brought to an end without a deficit that will be the utmost the Ministry will achieve The most interesting part of the speech how ever is that in which he treats of the question of universal suffrage The present Cabinet propose to bring in an electoral reform bill establishing universal suffrage limited only by the power of reading and writing When the civilised nations of the world Bass Signor Minghetti shall have reached a higher stage of -political education and w wisdom than is at present the case it will become a matter of wonder to them that their forefathers should ever have thought of giving the same vote to the ignorant as to the cultivated, to him who has a great stake in his country and to him who has none to him who has done much for it and to him who has never done anything He spoke with much else mence against the proposed reading and writing qualification, pointing out very forcibly that invaluable and indispensable is the knowledge of reading and writing is as an instrument as means to an end it b) itself affords no proof of real culture no guarantee for months) no real ailment to the mind and soul He begged his hearers to remember that there were in the world nations every man of whom could read and write and which nevertheless lived in the depths of servitude and superstition lins part of the discourse was received with cape emily heart) and prolonged applause The leader of the Opposition made some valuable remains on It Uj a foreign policy He declared that the treaty of Berlin let what would be said to the contrary was a great improvement on that of San Stefano But he reminded his hearers that it was to be asked what part in this matter had Italy) ' What had been her aims a Has she during the latest part of this there followed a wise and expedient policy ' Could she at the Congress have acted otherwise than she did' and was the feeling of discontent and mortification which had generally been experienced in Italy with regard to the treats justified And what is to be thought of the manifestations which have been the re suited this feelings e the Italia medenta meetings Of course Signor Minghetti stag matiBOB the most) absurd) and mischievous tendencies of the Italia A ) events meetings in the severest terms Turning to the consideration of the T Eastern question he said that the problem which had so long occupied the minds of the statesmen of Europe was to know who was to be the heir of those beautiful prov races when the Turk in act ordance with historical necessity should be driven out of Europe Who ehalloccup) that city) to which Rome } felled the position of the capital of the world' Shall the Oriental i enniBitla he partitioned as Poland was in the last century) ' Or shall Russia supported by positivism reign there absolute ' Either solution seems full of peril I but far more so than to any other State to Italy, which, protruding into the Editor I ranean, forms the way between Europe and the East, and which possesses tra actions of hegemony in those regions, and the germs of profitable commerce, and salutary influence There are not train heirs for Lurks in the Oriental peninsula but they are minors After pointing out the difficulties in the way of preparing these news still in their minority for the due enjoyment of their heritage, Signor Minghetti proceeds - "I am entirely persuaded that our sue cessors (that is to say, the Depretis Ministry) desired and strove to hunt, about the restoration of peace But from that time a thought began to arise in their minds that Italy had interests in the East different and separate from those of the other powers, and consequently, that it was possible for us to adopt a course of action of our own, wine is should he productive of special advantages to us 'this thought was perhaps vague and confused, but it peeped out from their action and their words What wonder, then, that a sentiment of a fortification and discontent took possession of men's minds when it was found that we is 21 gone to Congress without any idea to express or any in fluence to exercise a serious for the preservation of our liberty of action we shut our ears even to the communications England wished to make to us after the Santo Stefano the it) Count Corti made the sign of the cross as if against the temptations of the Evil One (Prolonged laughter and applause ! And of all we went to Lorna perfectly tree But we found even thing pre arranged and settled Our liberty arrived there ignorant of every thing and impotent to effect an) thing With regard to the Austrian occupation of Bosnia the speaker expressed himself as follows - let me speak clearly) Ought Ita!) to consider the Austrian occupation of Bosnia and the Herzegovina as an evil, as a menace, or as an injury to our own position in the Adriatic' I think not Nor do I think that Bosnia and the Herzegovina give Austria my advantage over us in the Adriatic or the A " can Is it not an Italian tradition that the influence of Austria should gravitate towards the 1 asP 1 look into the history of Europe and I find that such has been the opinion of the greatest men from Prince Eugene of Savoy down to Count Cavour The speech was a very long one, and I have been able to done more than give a few of the more salient and striking p isa ages from it. But the whole of it was received through out with marked attention and approbation, and it will produce a sensible effect on the country 'The discourse of Signor Zanardelli, the Minister of Interior, at Iseo, made a better impression on the country than that of his colleague the Prime Minister at Paris , but it was fur-very far-from producing the effect of Signor Minghetti discourse at Legnago He defended the conduct of the Ministry for not having prevented the Harm trials meetings, which he strongly blamed, by arguments on the superior advantages and sounder constitutionalism of punishing faults committed rather than preventing those about to be committed that which may be said on either side of the question has become too much a matter of common- place for it to be worth while to occupy your space with it. But the part of Signor A man delhi a speech which Ima attracted the greatest degree of attention, and has been the most severe) criticised, was that in which he announced that the Ministry intended to in slade in their Electoral Reform Bill a provision giving votes to the army. He said that inasmuch as universal suffrage might have the effect of bringing to the polls classes of persons not well affected towards the monarchy (i of the clerical), it would be right to come to balance this by giving votes to the army I need hardly point out to any readers of The Argus how easy it has been for the Ministers opponents to tear to pieces so very strange and unconstitutional a doctrine Signor Zanardelli explained further that it was not intended that the army of any corps of it should vote as an army on bloc, but that every soldier should vote at the polling place of his on at home Imagine the amount of locomotion and the cost of it which ever) election would occasion, also the fact that at such times the country would be without any army at all the canes arrests have had been jeu in turning the Ministerial proposition into ridicule One of them represents a very jaunt) and smart looking vnanditic mounting guard before the b barracks, she having been left the sole member of the corps, ever) creature of the voting gender having gone off to then dif- ferent places of domicile Another shows a captain in front of a regiment addressing his men thus -" Now, soldiers, you are called upon to give your votes freely for a deputy to the Chamber for such a place I lie candidate approved by the Minister of War and by the officers of the regiment is Signor So and so But that of course need not affect your votes Remember, men, that a soldier B first duty is to obey the word of command Now, when I say ' Present Arms ' every man who votes for Signor So and so will present aims At tention ' Present Arms ' . Signor So and so is unanimously elected Another caucatureiepieBents two soldiers carrying to barracks the regimental soup caldron on a stick passed through the handles sight very frequently seen in Italian towns But unluckily one soldier is a supporter of the " Right in politics, while his comrade holds by the " Left A violent argument is going on between them, in the midst of which the soup is all spilled In short the unlucky proposition of the Ministry has excited so much 'ridicule and disapprobation that it seems likely enough to exercise a disastrous influence on their power of passing any reform bill at all. The fact of the declared intention of the clericals to go to the polls in opposition to the policy they have pursued hitherto, and then unconcealed rejoicing at the prospect of universal suffrage, is also tending to make liberals of all shades inclined to think twice before enacting a law which would cheques tionably send whole parishes in the rural districts to the poll, prepared to vote exactly as then priest told them It cannot be doubted moreover that the attempt on the King 's life and the, if anything yet more terrible and alarming came at Florence, will exercise on men s minds an influence unfavourable to the plan of entrusting political power to unknown couches sociales Very many organs of the press are already crying aloud for repressive legislation I have much hope that the Ministry will resist this unwise cry, and that we shall be spared in Italy the bootless rigours of Bismarckian legislation "We shall soon see 'the Chamber met-not in number sufficient for the transaction of any business, of course, as usual on the 21st And there is every reason to expect that wear all have a Storm) session I have in the early part of this letter spoken of the gala entry into Rome which the King and Queen are to make on the 24th just too late for me to give you any account of it in this letter I trust it may be all gala without any admixture of tragedy But men a minds are by no means easy on the subject 'The King, wisely as well as gallantly, will not consent to have his carriage surrounded by soldiers, or to take any such precautions May my next letter tell You that all passed off w oil P.
