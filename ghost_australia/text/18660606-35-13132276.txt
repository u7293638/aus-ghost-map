BEAR HUNTING IN NORWAY. -Â» From Autumn Rambles of a Student, by Land and Water.) " I LI, bet you five to one in tenders, you don't kill a bear this season, old fellow " Done was my prompt reply Such were the porting words addressed to me by an old college chum at the club the night before starting on my annual visit to the land of bears and salmon For years it had been my ambition to shoot a bear and as Norway is, I take it, the nearest country to our shores where such creatures are to be found, I have been a passenger thither every year, by the Hull and Christiana steamer How I have toiled year after year without success , how I have been a regular ' bear slave how I have camped out night after night how I have put myself to ever) possible inconvenience to say nothing of lying for hours on my stomach in close proximity to the carcase of a defunct cow, is best known to myself ' Knowing also that the first requisite for a bear hunter is to give up his whole time and thought to the one object, I have never even wetted line on a salmon stream, have never hunted reindeer or elk, and if ever I have shot a ptarmigan or caught a few mountain lake trout, it has been solely for the pot, and not for sport ' I had with me a regular Norwegian bear-hunter, a reputed bear here said to have slaughtered scores of bears in his time I suspect he was a humbug, and that I should have done much better without him M) reason for thus aspersing his character is this he had frequently heard me say " that if I could only kill a bear, I should be satisfied and therefore, I assumed he argued " that it was expedient for him to try and prevent me from shooting a bear as long as he could, fearing that if once I succeeded, his lucrative employment as my vade mecum would be at an end But if such were his real feelings on the subject, he certainly succeeded in disguising them admirably, and lnJceeping me well employed too On an average, I should say, once in fortnight One would come to me with tidings on another bear, and thus never let hope quite die out of my bosom One day when he was out of the way, news reached me that a bear had been seen the night before at a neighbouring Scoter (chalet) I determined, therefore, to go and investigate the truth of the statement for myself, and reached the said Notes with mv battery a little before sundown Ole, 1 left word, was to follow me the Scorer girl was an old acquaintance, for I had often had a glass of milk there when out hunting She was terribly afraid lest the bear should kill any of her outlying heifers, for one had certainly been prowling about the cow house for the last night or two, and as she had heard that I had just reached my old quarter, thought the " Engelksmand ' would come and shoot the bear for her Of course I gave her a dollar on the spot I confess I could not see any traces of bear, but the girl's earnestness of manner are assured me In deed, I have so often been victimised by false reports that I began to be rather cautious That he was at the bottom of many of them, I feel convinced now, but at that time I did not suspect him Acting on my fair hostess s advice I esconced myself at the window of the Scorer, whence I could have a complete view of the whole terrain where I sat hour after hour, listening to the inharmonious snoring of my companion, who, on passant, I may add, made nothing of going to bed in my presence I was beginning to get tired, and was on the point of throwing my self down on a bench to have a nap, when I die tinctly heard some animal approaching Nearer and nearer it came, till I could plainly discern the outline of what seemed to me the body of a monstrous bear " At last, I thought, at last and taking as steady an aim as possible, I cared to rush out of the hut, tot Uly regardless of the risk to which I might be exposing myself from the attack of a wounded bear was a moment's work Yes my bullet had sped well ' It's killed-it B killed, I shouted through the night air in an exuberance of joy) 0 horror just then, the unfortunate quadruped uttered not a growl which one might expect on such occasions from a wounded bear, not a roar, but the unmistakable bellowing of a dying calf "yes' there was only a mass of years before me, and that was all It was the favourite heifer that had strayed away the day before, and had now only returned to be posted by the deadly bullet of an Englishman Never shall I forget the cries and the lamentations the girl made over her dying favourite, or the buckets of tears she shed the loud sobs of the maiden in a treble kc), accompanied by the bellowing of the expiring calf in a bass made, indeed, such a concert in the upper regions of the atmosphere as is seldom heard I can only say that if the girl humbugged me with reference to the bear (and I feel convinced that she and Ore were confederates in the matter), it served her right in st calf and that I regret having paid her the twenty dollars I did for the calf, and the extra two dollars hush money, to say nothing about it, but to give out that the heifer had been made an end of by a bear Yes ' bear hunting is an expensive luxury (5) Crest fallen and savage, I returned home to my tent, and recounted all my mishaps to Ole, who naturally sympathised with me After my adventure with the calf, I would try another part of the country he was the calf s ghost 1 dreaded really) "Would she like to accompany me 5 ' Catch de staying behind ' I was his harvest, and it would have been a matter attended with no little difficulty to have got rid of him, had I wished it. He was, moreover, a very useful fellow, and obliging too, and I daresay not more of a knave e than all hunters are in general, and Norwegian in particular So I took him next morning we started and within a weeks time had pitched our camp on some mountains near Lei del, on the Sogne Fjord I passed a very pleasant time of it for though I had not as yet caught the most distant glimpse of a bearskin, yet the pure air, elie vi ill scenery and the tree life I was leading proved some compensation for all my disappointments andyexations Several tracks of bear had indeed, been seen of different degrees of freshness, and that was all, and I was at last beginning to despair of win ning my best for my time was nearly up, and in ten days I must be starting for England One (ever memorable) day I had sent Ole in of the village of Rendel to get the letters, and to bring a supply of bread and other necessaries and during his absence, determined to take a botanical excursion, to the purpose of gathering some of the race Alpine plants that grow on the mountain side, I shouldered my rifle to be ready for any emergencies, and started on my journey) "N as I dreaming s "VI is I in a state of scream bulls 5 Had the tension my nerves had so long undergone turned my brain I could not credit my eyes were those bear tracks Yes, they were in doubtedly genuine' No phantom bear could have left that impress on the soft clay and what was still better, they were evidently very fresh How I longed for Ole, or, rather, for his sagacious little dog ' But it was too good a chance to be thrown away, and, forgetting all about my botanical propensities, I set off in chase How cautiously I proceeded-no In the tracker could have done his work better. It was at last going to be crowned with success, I should win my bet, retrieve my mistake I had Still on and on the chase led me, up hill and down hill, across mountain streams, through thick. brush, till at length it entered an apparently boundless forest Here Bruin had evidently been squatting and regaling himself on strawberries May be he was not far off If I came on him Sleeping, should I shoot him so ? No, that would be decidedly unfair but I needn't tell any one about that Yes, he must be hard by, for I had cast round the place, and there were no tracks on the other side How cautiously I peeped ande peered through through fancying every log or trunk of a tree was my friend At length I saw him and to my joy discovered that it was a real bona-fide bear in all his native freedom Fortunately, he had not discovered my proximity, for the wild strawberries seemed to engross all his nrsone thoughts The revolver was loaded, if it should come to close quarters Well, to make a long story shorter, 1 at length got him in a good position, and sent a two ounce bullet crashing through his shoulder, and Bruin rolled over with a roar and bit the dust Ni ver shall I forget the ecstacy I experienced To have killed a bear was indeed something, but to have killed him by an) self entirely was a feather in my cap indeed Already visions of a procession into the village, headed by the defunct Drum, and accompanied by bonds of music, floated across my enraptured vision, and I doubt not that I should have worked out the whole programme of the festivities that would take place, had it not occurred to me that the sun was sinking, and that I had three or four hours walking before me (wi On closer inspection I found my Brain to be a very thin and emaciated specimen, decidedly mangy, especially about the neck It struck me as being odd, because I had always thought bears were extremely fat at that season, just before hibernating However, there must be exceptions, I comforted myself, and doubtless this was one-a poorly bear still it was a bear, sick or well and I had won my bet, and retrieved my honour As I could see the skin would be useless to me, I contented myself with cutting off his tail, more for the purpose of convincing One, who might otherwise be rather incredulous on the subject, and lighting my pipe made back tracks Fortunately) it was a bright evening, and I experienced no difficulty in finding my way Joy, I suppose, shortened my journey, and helped me along I had arrived within a mile of my tent, when I espied Ole in company with two men hastening towards me Their eyes were eagerly bent towards the ground, as if in search of some object " Oh, yes, it was quite plain he had missed me, and becoming alarmed had procured assistance, and was now following in my tracks Faithful fellow, he shall have another dollar- ' In a few minutes we met, and I was only forestalled in my intention of blurting out my good news with a self satisfied air by Ole s asking me " w heelier I had seen a bear-' "Is it likely, my good Ole5' anda smile curled the corners of mv hpB "Because, he went on " these two men were bound for Bergen fair with a tame bear, but it broke loose over night, and they have been searching for it ever since morning 1 shan't forget their looks in a hurry , there could not be a shadow of a doubt but that I had sacrificed their dancing bear It was too much ' ten times more galling than the confounded calf, any man might mis- take that for a bear in the dark ' Poor devils, how they did cry all the dollars they had expected to gain at the fair would never be realised-their live lihood was gone they were ruined Such I gathered from their incoherent tale And what was I to do Here was a pretty mess What a fool! had made of in) self- killed a call in one part of the country, and shot a tame bear in another charming little tale for the club ' My meditations were interrupted by their again asking me, "if I had seen a bear ' "Seen a bear' Chanel had been picking wild flowers out-there, ' I blurted outpointing in a totally different direction to that in which I had gone And the men went on their way, not indeed re- joicing " An) letters, One Ole handed me one A bright thought struck me " Ole, ' I said, after hastily glancing at the contents, " I must start for England at once ' And there and then we struck camp, and never halted till several miles intervened between me. and my possible pur sucrs But I don't think they would have followed me, for I left as a " gift from the Englishman, at the house where they had put up, a roll of dirty backed dollars, which, i doubtless, served to pacify them to Ole I never breathed a word about the matter Indeed, I would rather have lost 10 dollars than have told him Of course, I had won my bet I had killed a bear, but I never claimed it I have kept the stump of the dancing bears tail, it serves as a pen wiper, and as a reminiscence of my adventures Need I add, that having once killed a bear I shall never try to kill another that season cost me much And I see in my journal two significant items, "Twenty dollars to Lola (such was the Scorer girls name for VEAL'" "Twenty-five dollars for a D-B (a dancing bear )
