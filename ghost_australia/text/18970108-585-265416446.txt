The Lord save us and bless us! ivs vio canny to be haunted," she muttered, in a lower Key and with trembling lips. " 1 am -not a ghost," I returned, in a reassuring tone. Have you matches' and candle handy?' 1 " Matches ? What gara ye speak of matches ? Tak yersel awa." Ii my life had been at stake I could not have held in the hearty guffawthal escaped me like a rifle crack at the lone of her voice and words. "Ah, it's a poor gate when ane meets 1 nuld Goiitie!" she cried, beginning to sob. " Elessed saints, save me from the unco wain !" My laughter rang out again and the Newfoundland began to bark. " My good woman, don't you hear (lint I am only a mail?—a being of fiji-a and Wood, like yourself?" I answered, givinj her ano;her shake. - "A. man !" she ejaculated, in quite another tcme of voice.

I suggested that the maid should retire, as what L had to s.iy was quite conlidcnti.il, whctciipon the captain (for it was lie) held the liyht above his head and took a ciitical survey of my tout rnitmHe.

" I'm an ukl sea dog and not lo bainboorleil by humbug, Now, what d'ye want ? ' 1 told my eirand iu twenty words, but liul before the j;iil had ulited. " 1'hew !" whistled the niaiincr; "is the wind in that quarter? Well. I'll conliivc the do^s a watin leecption wlien tlicy do come. How many did yon say there were ?" "About fifty, Captain Heyivood, as nearns 1 rould calculalc." " Humph ! nther long odds. Never mind, sir, come- in." I followed him through apairof folding door^ into aivell caipeted and lofty apaitmeiit, furnished most luxuriously. By the soft light of a costly bronre lamp which the captain lit, 1 saw that no vulgar taste had suggested the furniiure and belongings ul this apaitment. From the thick maroon curtains to the soft, delicate-tinted paper on the walls, there was exquisite haimony, blended with artistic design. Nothing loud or showy cheek by jowl with rare tric-a-brae here. 1 I have known people with more money than taste make a furniture mail of their homes. Others, again, who had abundant taste and very little money, have managed lo make home comfortable and even elegant, In this apartment there was wealth and elegance combined; and the effect was charming. The captain, who appeared to be a hardy son of Neptune, verging on fiftyfive and ; wirti a jolly, good- humored face, bade me be seated and requested we to give him a detailed account of what I had seen and heard. . Not satisfied with this, I had to gire a per-, sonal account of myself as lo how I became be-nigbted intbe Manaka hills on the Waikato. The request seemed reasonable and I gratified hini," Just touching so much of ray history as merged into the question at issue. - " And so your name is Frank Leigh, you say ?"' " Yes; here is my card" "Card!" he echoed in surprise;"do you cany cards?" • " Certainly, Captain Heywood." " Of. course; no offence, my lad." -s 'ilfagh-rLeigb?;/ he .repealed lo himself.. "Leigh? 1 knowlhatiiame well enough. What part of the old country do you hail from ?" VjA liUle-township called TetSey, in Lincolnshire,"-1 replied/smiling. " The devil!" cried the -captain, starling suddenly to his feet. "IS T oJriir, 5 said Telley," cried 1, laughing.. " So you did, my lad Why, hang me, I was "born within three miles of it," ejaculated the: old' fellow, with much energy. "I knew a Colonel Leigh-who lost ail arm at ihe battle of Waterloo. —He lived in an old tumbleddowh ruin called 'The Pillars,' about half-a-mile out of Tfilley." "The" colonel was my grandfather, Captain Heywood. 1 was borti— likermyfather before nje—at 'TheFillars.'". You-don't say GO ! Give nie your fin, «uy boy. Hang tne, I'm glad to >"6u,"-hb cried, wi'lh genuine pleasute iieaming .from hisses. " Lord love you.

I have seen facfi i^.i i-anvas that words cannot describe. S i on (lie moving panorama of walking humanity that parses across oiie's vision have 1 beheld faces which an ariisl could not portray. The countenance before inc was not strictly beautiful. There arc certain " beauty women," as there are certain " beauty men," in whose features one delects no fault—who are the show-ligures of any paily or assembly in which they appear —but vim, some how, inspire no sentiment and e\cite ii'i interest ; llicy l.i' k '.-oiiic- expression, wlicthei of mind or ul soul or of heart, without wh'e'.i the nui^l beautiful fare is but a Icieiy picluie. Yet the picture here reversed this oidcr of things. Take the features sine'v, and they were by no means pei1.11, nor were they set oil' by any 'nilli.im y of c.ol.>iinn- Ihil the f.n e aiuu.,ed anil impiessed the imagiii.lti":i with a belief in the puiily and lovliuess of villain woman-woman untempted aud iiiiliiinlcd, either by the follies or the vices of that mystery called society. 'J'he plossy uveii hair, coiled up iu a simple, luxutiaui knob behind the small imis, Ur^tther with the pale olive rompleiion, «ere certainly not lin^lisli ; -but the dark blue, lustrous eyes, shaded by long lashes, the sweel, espressive mouth, and the smooth while brow, were unmislakab!e characteristics of the Anglo-Saxon race. The luxury of • bath eomawhal com- J'ensjtc j for uij- waul of rett. I felt inrated and ready ajiin for any emergency. It was daylight now. I druiv aside the curtaius, opened the win- dow and looked forth, A liright, beautiful morning, with the sun jim beginning to gild tlio topmost peak of Mount 'fnrraru far away on the distant lioriEO-j. Below, the rioh valley, prolific with life aud beauty. As my gaze wandered over the distant rauges, I became aware of >n object eloirly moving along between the trees. Wnitiiig aud watching, I saw that it was a body of men—armed men—Maoris, in fnct. My first thought eu^gesteiTeHuri; but uo, as they approached nfcHtqr('X recoguiscd'Reni and my companions of the previous days huut. ThB yoimg chieftain inarched a^'the lioiia o[ liis men aud near him a falcelia, whom I -had never seen before. >Vnile J etood wati-hing their anproach, Cjplain Hey wood eutored, armed to the teeth.
