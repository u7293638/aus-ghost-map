poctcg. Aunt Martha's Spinmag-lflicel. With spider-webbing tattered In travesties of lace, 'Mid treasures year? have scattered Once miracles of grace Imploring Time to spare it, With rusty tongue of steel, Behold it in the garret AuDt Martha's spinning-wheel. With slow and pensive fingers I wipe the webs away, While loving Fancy lingers To paint an olden day. When youth and beauty crowned it What gay songs used to peal! Now crickets wail around it JLanfc Martha's spinniug-wheel. T scfjly touch the treadle ; It },ives a plaintive squeak ; .It fcer.s mc not to meddie, la T/nu'murs sad and meek. A?as< the fcc-t that iitheJy G:ice twinkled through the reel, mole shall p3t it blithely Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. How oft its noisy turning Hath served a lover's need, Ami kept Age from discerning What only Youth should heed! Tnoul'l drown both vows and kisses That lovers love to steal; A dear old treasure this is Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. For fear of house adorner In search of bric-a-brac, Far in the garret coiner With sighs I put it back : And there, just as I found it, I leave for woe or weal With ghosts to giide around it, 4unt Martha's spinning-wlies.!.
