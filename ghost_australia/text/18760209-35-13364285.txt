WOOL SALE AT BERLIN. I TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. birth Brodribb deserves well of these southern communities, whose chief wealth consists in the raw material that is manufactured, so to say, out of their grass Through his fearless exposure of influential abuses, it has now been convincingly shown that the Australian manufacturer does not get fair play from his correspondent in London Mr Brodribb s letter in your issue of Tuesday leads us to say pect that if our wool were sold in Berlin instead of London each fifty bales would net a profit of £220 after paying, £63, cost of removing stone from London to Berlin The' account, if true-and we can hardly doubt it represents a loss of 19 per cent, and further excites a general uneasiness, whether in the article of wool alone the united colonies may not annually be losing some two and a half millions in hard cash of London merchants are in the habit of extracting a 'similar rate of profits from all other imports, over and above what would satisfy the merchants of other countries, I can very well understand their having some 200 additional millions to loan out each year to an external tributary world But it reflects little credit on the various colonial Governments, and especially on their accredited public agents, in England, how our unenlightened or mis- informed communities continue to be exposed to such extortion I suppose there does not exist in the world any clues trading on a proportionate capital who understand less of their -v very important business. than do our wool growers Individuals we are powerless strangers to each other, we have not yet learnt to unite our infant helplessness cries out that the time has not come for our miners to withhold special paternal assistance-if it be not the duty of Government at all times to protect commerce directly and indirectly, against foul play Three of the Governments of our group are each draw- ing some four millions annually from and through our in dustry and yet they do not seem to mind (he unprofitable ignorance in which a hopeful cotton try are hampered They seem --satisfied to see then sub] octa their children their best customers fleeced and skinned by strangers They diligently investigate such trumpet affairs as Rossi's case, or the Kiama Ghost, but studiously avoid inquiries that would repay each colony by millions There can be no question that ignorance is more or less at the bottom of nil loss. How many of us have written to those agents in England (whom we pay SO disproportionately to their exertions) for hints as to future guidance and yet who can show the slightest practical suggestion as the result of our legitimate inquiries t If the London wool must be one huge conspiracy, while the Berlin may it is composed of honester materials, such fact must be known to any one worthily undertaken the responsibility of a London agent and this agent ought to give his colonial client the benefit of such knowledge Mr Brodribb happens to be just in a position to try this, to us, vital point I hope he will do so, and that at least a few Australian consignees will have the meaning s to stand by him Amid important political questions, Europe in and American Governments condescend to employ their ambassadors largely on many minor commercial questions affecting the interests of even a very small body of their respective subjects Colonies have no political vexations with the mother country Our envoys are strictly commercial, and yet the interests they should watch over are to us colonists overwhelming Theirs should be the beacon where the lighthouse is deficient theus should be the guiding hand discovering and punishing the wreckers who would batten on our men by false lights But it is the duty as well is the interest of the s various colonial Governments properly to pay, and properly to support well-selected colonial agents I again urge public opinion to the paramount advantage of cheap telegraphic communication- of subsidising cables rather than antiquated mail services £151 IS rather too much for only 200 words transmitted to England ' It was chiefly, perhaps entirely through neglect in our Governments basing arranged that the cost of a telegram to London should not exceed a few shillings, that our community has been startled by hearing the convincing proofs of a prudent colonist that he had been damnified in his consignments to London at the rate of 19 per cent thereby leading us reasonably to suppose that in the export of raw wool alone our group loses unfairly an annual £2,500,000. I Why should not our most important trade unite, or I endeavour to unite, as other trades have done ? Why should I not one fundamental rule of our union so that our wool i seen _a\\)"g rain reported on by an ix|i(ncnceil broker. f herald not leave our shed. until sold i Within system of extended railways, will cheap telegraphy, with a fleet of rapid rich mine OUR water rises like the St Osyth, the vol of even in a interest in might is converted into el fish within two months after the Europeans in mufti tin and J dee did on lengths clip Let menddjlhutLi gained his became a HAs the i (similar integrity above- firm very larceny John yields w write us to that effect We believe the Earned a good name, and rcntcqucLt prosperity, 11 as due to the vast in it out there up to oUTfohe-^ We are convinced that not emu in ten thousand there but sympathies with us fig unit scheme ng tCTnbinnion*-not necessarily by 1 nglishincn-wine h may crop out in cosmopolitan England though the al use or too lenient justice.
