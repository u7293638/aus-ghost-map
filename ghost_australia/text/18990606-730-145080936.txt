ORIGINAL POETRY. Songs of the 24th of May THE GHOST REVIEW. The Queen of England held a review (Halt! Who goes there?) And the long day paled in the ghostly dew Where the silent soldiers were. They had come from the lands of the far away (Their skulls are the world's milestones), With uniforms 'grimed and gored in the fray (The sharp winds bleach their bones). Their white teeth shone like ivory fire From each shrivelled, time-parched lip, And the blood red swords that never tire Ran point and hilt, with their dread desire, To the turf with a soft "drip, drip." "Right turn!'' and in column they faced them west, And a live wound gaped in many a breast. "Quick March!" and the murmur of dying groans Was hid in the rattle of dead men's bones . . . Till the sunset swallowed them in the West She watched them, blest them, and gave them rest. OOBAKNAN. 24/5/'99.
