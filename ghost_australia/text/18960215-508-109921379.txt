Bute -^ the fact remains that for some fifK^ days a large body of Welshmen wjere?*'f« prevented from earning their daily breadVby''^M fears which nine men out of .ten would hasv& ')^M supposed as extinct, if not as the-dodo^at K: least as the bustard. The MorfSF men., horw^'j-t^ ever, have a piece of recent history in. iheief'iiS minds, which is no doubt a sufficient excuse*-?. %j for a good deal of superstition. it-^is-n^W;'-.^ some six years since nearly a third^of i3*er 'J? men working in one division, of the^Ptarfa*'=!';| pit saved their lives by yielding to\ pse--1 J cisely the same fears which were aiffiietmgf :| their fellow workmen recently. For some ? :£|j two or three days voices were heardfc-in ifS; various parts of the pit, -which were.*ais-* :*;Sfj cribed to workmen killed in an «i* ,?| plosion which had occurred i3ooj^y^)$ years before, and supposed to vicom-'-^ tain warning- of an impending disasten*^ | The voices certainly spoke in Welsh, buff ?: there was some uncertainty as to what.fibfeyjfi; actually said, though some 'men professed ?*;; to have been called on byname, and to-.haVer: ,-; been urged not to come to work. In any* '??$ case a large number of men knocked^ off J work, and in a few days one division of ife&£ ? mine blew up, and nearly every man iniitfr.-' — some 200 in all — was killed. Defects in. the ventilation of the mine were afterwards U; proved to have existed, and the suggestible :..'j was made that they may have caused, in. J part or in whole, both the voices and the* '; explosion. This view is consistent , , with;' ' the present conduct of the colliers; but it' : seems that, as a matter of fact, it is not -' generally accepted by them now, as according,' to the best information obtained with great:, ? ' difficulty, it was not accepted by them see years ago. The present difficulty is . increased by the alleged appearance ' of a ' dove underground, where no dove should be/£^ of whose previous appearance there seems -ji to be no record. Whether he was white,. v grey, or speckled is doubtful, but it seems ,rj certain that his color, if ascertained, -would J throw some light on his origin. TJnfortu- ??§ nately science, as represented by mining V; inspectors and others, has not succeeded either in hearing the voices or seeing: .-.the....* dove, but it has at least done itd best to '? make sure that in this instance similar \ causes sba.11 not produce similar elreels. It is not altogether easy to re rose- the colliers sympathy in their present diintiuUy. A mine with miles of empty and potriliiy deserted headings is far more ghostly ili:m any number of churchyards, and tlsis is . . especially the case when it has recently been the seene of one of the most terrible dis- ; asters in the historv of mining, and when it . still contains the remains of some of -the , .'| victims of that disaster, which falls of earth ;' ' ^ made it impossible to recover. It is -the S^ duty of everybody connected with the man- '.|- agement of a mine to impress on all- jtheir .^S subordinates the imminence of the dangers c| to which they are constantly exposed, and v | their action in this respect is not calculated =' I to do anything to check the influence of . j{| superstition of the commonest 'kind. Similar : . 5 occurrences are not unknown in Wales, ona - * of the most remarkable being the story of a . : ::^L quarry in Carnarvonshire.. On one occasion *V; an accident on a large scale ; on Good^vi^ Friday prevented the quarrymen for- . ':- many years from desecrating the ^: church festival. At length ..they ?_. wece*. [??. '-'K^ persuaded to resume their former ? ;: :'?'?'. habit, and on the first Good Friday on which - : they resumed work another accident m '.^/.J occurred, though on a smaller scale than the ' - previous one, with the result that in that .;V^ quarry Good Friday will Tank as a Sunday* .; ,':ii for the present generation at least. Ifc,Js to i^ be hoped for every reason that the Morfa ='/;^J| ghosts will now be discredited, but the „ . ;-^| present incident shows what very practical ' :|| results superstition may produce in circunx- .????. ':-j~{ stances favorable to its influence. — ** Pali /Jjj Mall Gazette.' vSS
