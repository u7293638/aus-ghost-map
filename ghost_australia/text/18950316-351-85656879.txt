' Out of town,' his adversary repeated, with a leer, which grew more objectionable at each repetition, until Tom remembered David Wynne, an elderly bachelor who pro fessed a conviction that London and Now York share the eomi'uits of life between them, and that a man of rea.s.nable experience- is to be found oithur in ono city or the othor at any Boauou. 'He is in town,' the porter eonco ded. 'Dines litre every evening, eight sharp.'

Ho must, .vait for Wynne, who was a cortjiint.y at oight o' clock, and who, always well posted in every body's affairs, could inform him not. merely about; the rumor of bin death, lint about, some imaginable results of that, rumor which troubled this perplexed younir man more than tho temporary doubt, of his identity or the brief disarrangement of bin i'm nnccij. Hefore the star wan printed bosido bin name in tho chili list his doath must hnvo been widely credited. This oxplained Mabel's silence- : she believed him dead two yours since; along, long timo for faithful mourning of the dead,— tho dead who had been neither just, nor tender in bin farowollu. Good God ! how should he bear to hear that 'Van Eynk had won her ? Vory ghost -like ho felt, as ho wandered resi lessly from the hotel to the fltreotn. Poor ghosts, — real ghosts ! ho hoped that heaven, or ovon the other place, shut them securely from any news of the world which they had loft, and which did not miss them !

Two years in Ayhioh to win , Mabel from tho memory of the lover she .belioved doad ? Such had been Van Eyik's object in dovising and acconi ?plishiug, through his old servant, this curous' fraud. Doubtless tho well- paid servant hud -vanished. Tho master's complicity would bo diflieulfc to prove. Yot, moro and worno, Van Kyck was attractive, dovoted : Mubul .was probably already his wife, — pare, proud Mabel, who-o misery, should she discover that her husband had been guilty of so base treachery, would not be lessoned by the llcnowludgu that lie was temj)ted by love of her. ' AVhat has \rau Kyck been doing these two years !' Tom asked, presently. ' Loafing, us usual, and making love to Miss Ni-sbit ' ' Has that occupation been successful ':' 'Slow but sure, those say who profess to know. There sin: bets-bud form, those bets!— that. Miss Ne.,bit will bu Mrs. Van Eyok before Christmas. Keep cool, my boy,' Wynne added, with mi odd change of tone, anil i glance across Tom's shoulder toward a man who was approaching them. Tom rose. The new-comer stood .stone still. 1'or a moment they stared at each other, with a gaze of such ontire mutual comprehension that words were needed merely for its ilisgui.-e. ' Alive, after all the weeping and wailing for you is ended i- \rery indieoreut, Mr. Stuuvt,' Van Kyck exclaimed. 1 You evidently did not share tho goneral belief in my death.' ' 1 rarely share- a goneral belief, even in matters which concern me more deeply than tiie rumoured death of an acquaintance.' 'This riinu)r took the l'oim of a cablegram sent by a servant whom you recommended to us.' ' I stood sponsor for the fellow's cooking, not for his veracity, or his sanity.' The short (sentences, sternly swift as the first passes in a duel a la inort, ceased h urply. During .'mother long moment neither man moved, — a moment in which Tom fought a nobler battle for Mabel's future happiness than ever knight of old wiigi'd for his lady's name ; and the adver sary he conquered was his own fierce desire to strike his clinched hand against Van Eyek's sneering smile. 'Good-night, Wynne/ lie said, rather broat.h!e.-.sly. ? Being a ghost, I am inspired by the well-known ghostly liking for solitary prowling.' Without further word to Van Eyok, be walked down the room, followed by Wynne ' Uijrht you are,' that gentleman mur mured, rejoicingly conscious of having escaped complicity in a row. ' I doubt whether you could prove anything ; and accunatioii, un less proved, soonis moro blackguardism. Ulevor r-UMal ho u,— eh? Neat* Unit hint about tlio cook's canity.

Van Kyok wan turning over an eve ning paper when Wynne passed him again. ' Has Stuart been interviewing his dln uppniutiid heirs ?' he asked languidly ; ' or did he lo.ii: his manners in Africa r' ' Tin bus had a curious experience-.' ' I should like to hear bow ho enraged sny von- peiiceiiblo cook.' ' He sayii the cook had no cautio for grudge against him.' Vani'jyck shruggod his shouldors. ' That, is a statement which few will believe, oven though ii man return from the dead to toll it,' ho quoted, cynically. Tbon he rose. ' Ta-ta, Wynne,' lie said, without offering bis hand, — perhaps because Wynne's remained somewhat, rigidlj pendent. ' ^ sail in the Majestic to-morrow ; duo in Scotland noxt week for the August shoot ing.' 5 Scotland 1' Capital idea. You couldn't do better,' Wynne declared, and went to dinner chuckling Huftly. 'Tom wins, by Jove, after throwing down bis cards. And there in list be one woman yot, us constant at' Penelope.' Tom Stuurt, however, had not, thrown clown all his curds. Though he had renolved to leave unaccused the man who haci by such ingenious treachery won Mabel from him, ho owed it to her to write her of his roturn, and of his unchanged love, not mentioning Van E} cli's mime, perhaps. Am Tom walked swiftly along a wiiy that had lined to be the way to PanidiMe, there (b-iftocl across the til mult, of his thoughts some lines which thrilled him wondrously : There's a time in the livos of mont women and men When tangle ' threads would grow smooth and even If only the dead could know just when To como back and be forgiven.'
