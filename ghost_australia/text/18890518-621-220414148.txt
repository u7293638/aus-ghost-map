His Divinity. — w She's as graceful and free as a faery. As down to the footlights she trips, Her great eyes like big twin stars a-gleaming, And the o-host of a smile on those iios That are rwder than any red rose is Where the belted bee honey-dew sips. Tho' 'tis true that her skirts they are scanty (They don't reach half down to her knee), As she pirouettes there, or on fip-toe Stands apoise like a butterfly, she Mayn't have dropeed from the sky, but I'll swear that She looks like an angel to me ! And I watch her with heart that grows hungry And famished and foolish and faint, Then flames fiery with jealons mad jwssion Of love— You may say she's no saint, But I worship fore'er at her shrine — spite Of padding and powder arid paint ! But, tho hope springs sometimes on a sudden Like a flower, m the drought it soon droops; Tho' her fair face, alas ! is my heaven, The star to the earth never stoops, For Oh, she is the queen of the ballet, While I'm the tag-end of the supes !
