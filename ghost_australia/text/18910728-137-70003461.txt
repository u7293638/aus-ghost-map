TEIMPERANCE CORNER. \---+-- BY W.C.T.U., WARRAGUL. Our Temperance corner is coming in for a littlecriticism of late. One Jacob Sniffilum anther of the "Bmragwell Papers" in the " Mirboo Herald" let at us the otherday in the following strain:-" The Warragul Guardian" has a " Temperance Corner," but the selection of a par, which appeared therein, in Tuesday's issue, was rather unfortunate, and, in my mind, not calculated to elevated the " noble cause of total abstinence." Here it is: " A vessel recently sailed from a Belgain port for WVest Africa with 460 casks of gun-powder, 10,000 casks of rum, 11 cases of brandy, and 14 mis sionaries !" By the shades of Hogan's ghost! If that's not the most peculiar conglomeration of peace and war ever I heard of! Whether or not they are taking the rum and brandy to be blown up by the gun-powder I do not know. But since that literary lumi nary the " Guardian" inserted it in the " Temperance Corner," that must be the intention of the 14 missionaries. This is the only construction you could put on the par. that would be calulated to advance the temperance cause. Perhaps, though, this is the mission aries' idea of the best -means of intro ducing civilization into the dark regions of Africa. They'll probably make Christians of the savages with the aid of the rum and the brandy, and then translate them to that " better land" by the samewhat forcible means of gunpowder. It's a "rum" idea to me altogether.
