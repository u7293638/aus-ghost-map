Anyhow, I braved it, and listened to Macdonald. By-the-way, is there not a little lacK of taste on the part of Mac's friends in calling him "Australia's Own War Correspondent?" Poor Lambie fell, riddled with bullets, on the veldt of some unpronounceable African locality. Poor Horace Spooner left a young widow and a young family to mourn the loss of a brave young hero. A. B. Paterson has pushed through from start to finish like the rider who "Beat the Favourite." Without in any way depreciating Macdonald, let us acknowledge that there were warriors before WELL, the Tivoli is all a-buzz with new doings !

The awful fact about the Richards' show can no longer be suppressed— There is too much of it! While you are wasting your sympathetic tears on Ophelia, lo ! LaerteB comes blustering in. For instance, there iB " Little Baby Parkes," who, the programme tells me, is " one of the world's wonders : a child with the ability of a trained womanwhich, of course, I do not believe. I have been an entrepreneur myself, and quite a scholar in the uses of advertisement. There is likewise a " Century Animatographe," which gives joy and doesn't pall, albeit it is Robert W. Paul's very latest New 1900 Patent something or other, direct from Londing. Then there are Miss Ida May, Mr. J. Walker and Miss Daisy Coppin. I have a reminiscent idea that these artists are debutanting— or words to that effect. Then, again, there is the evergreen Billy M'Lain andtheever-blooming Madame Cordelia. And, and, and—no end of " ands "—Emmonds, Emmerson and Emmonds repeated the comedy act, and, like Gilbert's Hous6 of Lords, "They did it very well." Wallace King, good old voice, sang in most effective fashion " She Wore a Wreath of Roses." As we have elsewhere remarked, the Tivoli is a thing of permanent beauty and a joy during the winter montns. " I AM here !»-and why for not?
