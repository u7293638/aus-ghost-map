HOW THEY MANAGE AFFAIES AT ;?;? ADEIiAtDB. It will he remembered that some time ago tenders were called by the Oorporation. of Adelaide for fencing the Cily squares. Sev eral tenders were, sent, in amongst -others being pneffrom the firm of Jiames Martin7& Goi Oiere were to be two separate tenders one for the Victoria Sqaare, the other forthe fifee? ceinainiag squires. = Upon the tandem being opened on the 2ind inst, it was found that, -Messrs Martin's tender,., for Victoria SqWare was -i lowest. , ISowl h&v;&~ pomps; the gross injustice of the case. The variousten ders were published, bat the question 'where was the nioney to come from' had not been solved, and an adjourmnerit took place to look into the difficulty. We learn Messrs Martin had solved the money problem by proposing that tha time be extended from nine to fifteen months for cotupletiug the work, the payments would then come out of two years rates instead of one, aud they i urfcker offered to reduce their price by £400 providing they could at their option use in stead of granite, bluestone. Now the Council having made known to the other tenderers what Messrs. Martin's tenders were, it stands ?to sense that, they in their own interests would if possible reduce the amount of their tenders, thus it was an easy matter for the foreigners to make an amended return, and they only reduced their tender for the Victoria Square by 14 per L cent. y certainly a pretty fair amount to knock off. . Jjiitner tne original tenders sttouia nav« not been madepablie or being made public, th^ should not Have been referred l»ack, as by so doing it was simply letting the foreign firm into the secrets of the colonial firms, who having Messrs.. Mai*tin's tender i-efore them were of course enabled to send in a, price below them. At the adjourned meeting of die Council where the tenders were to be finally considered, the following letter was received rom the Gawler firm : — . ' We beg to say Ih&t; we supplied fthe City Council With that information on Thursiay last, the 25th inst;, at tie request of His Worship - the Mayor, which information has been. , anade public, and the Oity Gouncil has taken advantage of that information to open up the whole .subject,- with a view, we pre siune, ,pf finding a-pretest to give the contract : to acity jfirnL.

Sad case of Drowning yesterday as two children of Mr George Dalby of Gawler South were returning from school at noon one of them was unfortunately drowned. It appears that little girls, Caroline Louise aged 9 years and Harriet Rebecca, 11 years, along with some other children from the Model School were playing on the river bank when she slipped in and sank. Her sister Harriet at once jumped into the water, and after herself narrowly escaping was rescued by Mr. R. Lonsdale; The other was recovered by Mr. T. Bright who found her at the bottom of the river. Every effort was used to restore respiration, ;but after un successfully trying for over an hour the body was removed to the house of Mr Lonsdale. Dr. Pophan arrived just as the body was taken into the house, and upon examination pronounced life extinct. Some stimulants were given to Harriet, and she is at present progressing favourably the father was at work in the North, and could not get home uutil late last night. The inquest, which was held to day, will be found, in another column;- Wheat -YiBLp. — A-': comparison lias been made, andspme statists prepared, as in:. the? wheat yield in England and America by.: a colonist.

Again, if we look at the {average crop' Jof wheat in the United States of Atnericaiiaken from returns published, there we find it is only 10 '4 per acre, while they boast that the fertile state of Kansas yields an average of 14 '6; and a writer wishing to attract immi-; gratioh remai'ks that the greatest aggregate; «ver known ia one State is 15 bushel?, «x-* cept from California in 1876.

These were kept separate and. sown in rows oi zwetve Teec long, side by side, and although the two samples when growing were so close together as to touch whenever the wind' blew, and sometimes to cause the ears of one to catch in those 'of the other, the, greatest possible contrast is presented between the two; kinds . of grain.

Wesle yah- Missions. — The annual services in connection with the Foreign Missions were held on Sunday and Monday last. On the Sunday the Rev. B.

Campbell, that gentleman read the report, which showed a total amount raised by the Crawler Circuit of £45 18s. lldV during the. past year. The Rev. R. W. Campbell, then addressed the meetiog,- and-in a capital speech showed how the missionary spirit had exerted a benign influence upon the early : Methodists, and pointed Put that their spiritual life was generally in consonant with missionary zeaL The rev. gentleman concluded by an earnest appeal to his hearers, urging them to let the work have more of their sympathy and sup port than.it had done in.the past.

It is a lofty v square enclosure, without roof or covering 'of any kind* Huge bloated vultures and kites, gorged with human flesh, throng* lazily the summit of the lofty wall surrounding the stone pavement, which is divided into three compartments, wherein the corpses of men, of wnmAn. and of children ara laid anarfc. and all nude as they came into the world. Some relative or friend anxiously watches, at a short distance, to see which eye is first plucked out by the birds, and from thence it is inferred whether the soul of the departed is happy or miserable The Parsees regard with horror the Hindoo method of disposing of the dead, by throwing the bodies or ashes into rivers : yet their own custom is even more repugnant to the feelings of all the Europeans in India. — ' Cassell's Illustrated History of India.'
