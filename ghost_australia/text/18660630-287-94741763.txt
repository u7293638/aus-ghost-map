WHAT JUDGE BOOTHBY THINKS. Guess we thought we'd got things all right and valid, With our Imperial Act to patch up all flaws, That much-wished-for boon, round which we all rallied, Twould defy even Boothby to smash up our laws ; ButH.B. T. Strangways, he Says that's all gammon, for there aint no A.G. ! What ! There aint no A. G. ? that's a curious go, Says Boothby, the Judge — I must have time to think, And if, on reflection, I find that it's so. From doing my duty you'll not find me shrink ; Let Boucaut, J.P. Who says he's A. G. Come straightway before me, and show if he be. V Now, though Boucaut, J.P., has left off Ms wide-awake, And wears a bell-topper, by no means so cheap, As becoming Ms rank ; still he's not one to quake. You must still get up early to catch Mm asleep. So J. P. Boucaut he Says Fm hanged if I go^ — send a Tipstaff for me. Judge Boothby ' says he never beard in his life,' Of proceedings so clearly illegal, and bad, And Stow, Q.C., just to stir up the strife, Would'nt bring out Ms licence, wMch really was sad. So Boothby, B. Said that he Would commit the whole lot, if a Tipstaff had he ! The Tipstaff, however, not being forthcoming, His Honor proceeded to lay down the law ; And when he got blown, 'Strangy' took up the running; Between them they managed some pretty tall jaw ; Says Boothby B. In this colom'e Fm really ashamed to live, says he ! Unhappy colonists your course is fraught With dangers which you really cannot know ; To put it very shortly 'everything is nought,' No Court, Attorney-General, or Stow ! Says Boothby B. There's leaily Only one valid man in the place, aud that's mi ! Now Parliament's met there must be a ' scrimmage,' The extinguished A. G. may yet prove he exists, And wall probably do Justice Boothby some damage ; He really must go if the law he resists. Let's hope that we Of Benjamin B., Invalidity, And absurdity, Have seen nearly the last — that's the idee ! Biglow's Ghost.
