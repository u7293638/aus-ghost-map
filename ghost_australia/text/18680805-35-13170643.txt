THE ANGLICAN CHURCH. VISITATION OF THE CLERGY. The Visitation of the clergy of the Anglican Church within the diocese of Sydney took place yesterday, at the Parochial Church of St Andrew (adjoining to the new Cathedral), and was very numerously attended Tilly four clerics in Holy Orders, holding licences from the Right Rev Dr Barker as their ordinary, answered to their names when cited by the Bishop's Registrar to appear, according to the formula prescribed by the ancient usage the Church of England Several clergymen, unable to attend from illness or other urgent causes, sent letters 01 messages in explanation of their involuntary absence Morning prayer was said by the Rev Thomas O Reilly (the clergyman at present in charge of St Andrew's Church), who was assisted in the Psalms and Canticles by an efficient choir, Mr Young officiating as organist The Bishop of Sydney and Dean Cowper occupied the schists on the north side of the altar, the Bishop's chaplain (the Rev R L lung) being placed in one of the corresponding Beats on the southern side of the holy table Neal the seat of the Bishop was a credence, or by standing (able, according to the proper form There was a large congregation, composed of the hilly and of clergymen from the adjacent dioceses of Newcastle and Goulburn Morning prayers having been concluded, the Very Rev. the Dean of Sydney ascended the pulpit and preached the Visitation Sermon, taking for his text the 28th verse of the 20thchaplor of the Acts " Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the Church of God, which hath purchased with his own blood " THE VISITATION SERMON The Dean or biuxEv began his discourse (almost exclusive directed to the clergy) by inviting the attention of his reverend brethren to the Remarkable condemnation of Aro'tolical d chine which was set forth in his text, combined, as it was, with a terse and jet most comprehensive direction for the guidance of pastors in the ministry of the Church In no other passage of the New Testament would be found a more solemn admonition as to the nature of their special! duties, as to the responsibilities of their sacred office, Hndns to the weighty reasons why those responsibilities should ever be kept steadfastly before them It was a passage not less full of instruction and of warning than of due encouragement the three principal topics which presented themselves were the office assigned to then as ministers of Christ 2 The nature of the duties incumbent upon them as such ministers and ¿ Their awful responsibility for the proper discharge of these duties 'They would remember that these words were part of a charge delivered by the Apostle St. Paul to the presby tors the Church of Ephesus, whom he had sent for to Miletus, where he can- tí ended the members of the Ephesian Church to the especial care as elders and overseers appointed in that behalf 'the term I'tcsbutcroi (or others). and Episcopal (or overseers) were as they all know, then applied to one and the same office to those duly ordained persons who had comparatively small or local charges, it not being until some years later that, as the numbers and organiser of the Christian Church increased, the name of " Lpiscopos,' or overseer, came to be exclusively applied to that Chief Presbyter whose duty it peculiarly was to ordain to the ministry, and to regulate the general affairs of the Church from a consideration of the meaning of these two names, as applied to the clergy (of Ephesus assembled by St Paul at Miletus, the Dean took occasion to insist upon the significant of the term overseer (when applied to the presbytery in its original and restricted sense), arguing that it forcibly implied all the heavy responsibilities which were inseparable from their office, the nature and duties of which were ably and exactly described Vigilance, promptitude, and activity were all required from the overseers of Christ's flock, who ought to be at all times ready to manifest the gravity, discrimination, and forbearance to be a expected from maturer years As to the specific nature of the duties incumbent upon them as teachers and spiritual pastors, it was evident that they were bound to qualify themselves to teach before they could hope to teach others, and they, therefore, ought to so direct their studios that, by their life and doctrine, they might throughout their life set forth the true and living Word Then he is must be an example, upholding the precepts which they strove to inculcate, for, us St Oregon Narrabeen said, "We must first be put lied ourselves, and then we may, perhaps, be able to purify offers this antecedent necessity was the teaching of that ancient father, but it had a far higher function, for it was the doctrine of our Blessed Lord him self There must be personal religion and continual growth in grace in the ministers themselves, if they were to witness any material improvement in those who were placed under their charge As shepherds appointed to o\ versed their respective flock, oil that were such a shepherd's charge should ever be the object of a most earnest and unceasing care To use these emphatic words with which they were all familiar he would say to them Consider with yourselves the end of your ministry towards the children of God, towards the spouse and body of Christ, and see that you never cease your labour, your care, and diligence, until you have done all that both in you, according to your bounden duty, to bring all such as are or shall be committed to your charge unto that agreement in the faith and knowledge of God, and to that ripeness and perfectness of age in Christ, that there be no place left amongst our, either for error in religion of for v viciousness in life ' i ht Dean then insisted upon the duty of the clergy to form themselves as far as possible after the great and spotless example of Christ, the Incarnation God, the sole ii ediator letw con God and man, the head over all things to the Church, in this world and in the life to come By lublicnnd private teaching, and by their example not at' times, the especial duty and privilege of the clergy was constantly to uphold the great doctrines of Christianity before the people, and in no way w is there a more important mode in which that beneficial influence would be exercised than by preaching. God's ordinance for the edification of the Lbuich Herbert, Liasmua, th radio, and the judicious Hooker were severally cited to prove he excellence and the importance of preaching as a means of edification, and the due influence of the pulpit was simply and ably vindicated from the superficial sneers of modern scepticism. The Dean, at the some time, warned his lev brethren that they ought carefully (to adapt their sermons to the differently constituted minds of their hearers , not confining their observations to any one class of persons, or individuals known to be influenced by any one school of thought Under the third head of his discourse the rev preacher dwelt, an solemn and affecting language, upon the responsibilities of the clerical office of all such as were called upon to be the spiritual pastors of that flock who had been bought with Chnst s blood the Church of God which He had purchased with His our blood There were words of the deepest gravity j and import, for howpiecious must not that Church to which had been purchased with the blood of Christ, God Incarnate the Divine Son of the Eternal God their commission, as preachers of the Word, and as stewards of the mysteries of God, was derived from the Holy Trinity and they were bound over to discharge it, with a serious sense of its weighty re reponsibility, mindful of the fact that they would have to answer to God for the way in which they might discharge their duty The Dean then left the pulpit, and having no entered the chancel directed the Registrar (Mr William Barker to call over the names of the licensed clergy of the Diocese of Sydney, This was accordingly done by the Registrar in the usual form and responded to by the clergy THE BISHOP'S CHARGE. The Bishop then delivered his charge to his reverend brethren, explaining that he had arranged to hold this visitation at a time when he thought it would not be in- convenient. Since the previous visitation the diocese of Goulburn had been formed, with most happy results, the cause of religion, education, and the interests of the Church having received a great impulse by the appointment of his right rev. brother the Bishop of Goulburn, The zeal and energy of the clergy had thereby been stimulated, and the organisation of the Church Society rendered more complete. After an experience of thirteen years in the colony' he could testify that when a good work commended itself to the laity, neither the men nor the means were wanting to carry the design to successful issue. Provision was now being made for endowing the proposed diocese of Bathurst, and already some assistance towards the fund had been received from the Western districts. The amount at present subscribed was upwards of £7000, which, however, must be largely increased before an appointment could be made. The diocese of Sydney would then be brought more within manageable limits, and portions of the colony, it was now possible only rarely' to be reached by the Bishop, would enjoy the visits of the chief pastor. They had to lament the sudden removal of the Bishop of Grafton, and to trust that there would be raised up a faithful successor to him whom God had taken away. Our own body had lost two senior clergy the Rev. T. Hassall and the Rev. H. B. Styles-who, although differing in their ministerial character, gave themselves to (her Master's work, and by their zeal and devotedness won that best of reputations, that they were largely esteemed for their work s sake. Other changes had taken place. Four of our clergy had returned to England, and, Though prepared for some of these re- movals, they were not the less to be regretted. The Rev. E. Synge (formerly bishop's chaplain was now labouring among a large population in the North of England. The Rev. W. Hodgson, late Principal of Moore College, had also returned, after a twelve years'' residence in the colony', having during that time, by valuable labour, contributed largely to the body of the clergy. Sixteen clergymen, trained under his guidance, were now labouring with acceptance in this colony, and twenty-five in other parts of Australia. The address presented to him on his departure truly represented the feelings and opinions of those who had an opportunity of forming a judgment of him, and concerning his work. While regret was felt on account of hisdeptiituie, there was ground for thankfulness that his place had been supplied by the Rev. H. L. King. There were at present ten students in the college, of whom six were for the diocese of Sydney. The third session of the Synod was now about to be opened, and he might say he was quite satisfied with its constitution and mode of operation, feeling assured that the Church did right in obtaining the sanction of the Legislature to the method they had adopted of managing their own affairs. As to the character and position of ministers as members of Christ" Church and clergy of the United Church of England and Ireland, the rev. prelate observed that at present there were two rival theories, exhibiting such a wide and irreconcilable difference that it was impossible for a person to | maintain them both as true, or to harmonise them. Those, who held the first sought to restore the Church to its position before the Reformation, and the supporters of I t cond desired to can out the views and intention of the lie born ers The Bishop of London was quoted in reference of the in it, and the Bishop of Carlisle and others on the second floor, with explanatory comments, it being court tried necessary to deal with this point (con much his lordship) as the questions agitating the church at home turned chiefly on the character and station of the presbytery, who by the providence and 11 ointment of God had been set apart and authorised to preach the Gospel Hine seemed no higher and holier fire than This About the first of the appearance of No Oof the " finds for the Times" there was an endeavour to take the Church back to Rome, and during the last few j cars the attempt had been renewed, and was now carried in with such persistency and boldness us to be done in defiance of the admonition of bishops and the decisions of the Hi uses of Convocation, and apparently only to be restrained by the interference of the laws This match was noted, chiefly for the sake of observing that it was our duty to keep within the limits of the usage which the general practice of the Church of England had sanctioned for the last three hundred years, oaths wing the use of vestments, incense, and other things not so sanctioned, and such a construction and decoration of the communion table as would convert it into an altar-a term not known in the formularies the Church of England The rev prelate exhorted his brethren to give no counter i unto to tbcEi th gs, and said he was determined to uphold that grave and decent order with which the services of the Church were conducted in this diocese in a position was that of ministers of the Reformed Protestant Church, and in case of doubt or difficulty they were bound to fall back upon the views of the Miutyi Confessors of the Reformation to whom they owed a innkeeper feeling of reverence than was due to any guide the Church had had since the days of the Apostles The Book of Common Prayer was the Manual of Public Worship, and there was no authority to alter or depart from it Much scandal had arisen to the prejudice of the colonial Church in regard to the conduct of the Bishop of Natal, and the failure of the proceedings taken against him but the publication of his heretics in England would probably enable the authorities to deal more decisively, with his case It was to be hoped that he would be brought to trial for his heretical teachings, that thus so great a scandal might be removed If the Bishops of Convocation had no legal authority to deal with him. he might he called upon to resign by those few more opinions and decisions he was bound to deter, but unless moral suasion was accompanied by legal force, the most convincing arguments were likely to be found of little avail The authority for deposing him rested with the Crown as supreme ruler of all estates and degrees, whether ecclesiastical or temporal A pi as or for unity was greatly required The brethren ought not to be unmindful that they were members of the United Church of England and Ireland, and should re nicinlcrlho Irish portion in their prayers for evil times has come upon her She was in danger of being sacrificed to gratify personal and political ambition The Roman Catholic people of Ireland had no just cause of complaint against the Irish Church Roman Catholics did not found or maintain it, and while the proposed disendowment was unconstitutional and dishonest, it was also a mistake It was a useless surrender of a Scriptural institution, with a vague hope of propitiating an implacable foe It was making that possible which without such aid could never be accomplished Did the Church of Rome over accept articles of peace but those which gave her entire supremacy of mind, soul, and body? That which was granted was always made the basis of fresh demands No doubt, the Church in Ireland had much to answer for It was not exempt from that almost absolute decay which characterised religion atthooloso of the last and the beginning of the present century, when it was but too commonly regarded as a political engine It did not bear the clear full testimony of the truth of God, and the iniquities of earlier days might now be receiving a just re- compense and reward But of late years the Irish Church had contained men distinguished for an ability, zeal, and self-denial not surpassed in any Church in the world, and remark ably free from those errors at present invading the Chur cb in England. The Irish Church might be undergoing a j in loy Ing process Endow ments were not necessary and while some anomalies were removed, and the spirituality and devotedness of the clergy extended, we might, from the signs of the tunes, derive the consideration that the pro- phetic word was in course of fulfilment, and that the be ginning of the end was drawing nigh Turning to matters more immediately affecting the ministerial character, he reminded his brethren of their duties as to the saving of souls, quoting the words of Archbishop Leighton, who, when requested to preach for the times, said, " Suffer one poor brother to preach for eternity " He exhorted them to pr each Christ crucified, to have confidence that God would aid them with guidance and grace, and told them to bear in mind that they were men of one book-The Book the Bible The rev prelate concluded with some remarks upon the fi special duties of their calling The proceedings were brought to a close by the Bishop pronouncing the benediction
