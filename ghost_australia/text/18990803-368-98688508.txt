Wallace; " Mrs. Henry Hawkins," by Mr. C. P. Smith; " My Grandfather's Poultry Yard," by Mr. E. W. Chard, which brought down the house, and was uproariously encored, the response being " Sally Green," for which the singer was again re called, but did not respond; " The Banks of the Clyde" was creditably rendered by Mr. W. Harris, who on being encored gave " There'll Come a Time;" "The Haunted Spring," Mr. Matt. Sharp; " Wot ChOer," given by Mr. C. P. Snith, was loudly applauded. The entertainment concluded with the side-splitting farce, " That Big Dawn Carlo." The characters were taken by Mlessrs. Hourn, E Chard, and W. Harris. Carlo is a large black half-bred mastiff and re. triever, and, being well known in the town, he caused no little excitement when he appeared He is the property of MIr. N. Hourn. The entertain ment concluded with the singing of the National Anthem. Dancing was commenced immediately after the entertalinment, and was kept up vigour oudly till the "wee sma' 'oore." The music was supplied free by Mr. J. Hatter, sen. (violin), assisted by Mr. Jos Mitohell (accordion). There were between 35 and 40 couples present. The dance was very much enjoyed throughout. The luncheon was kindly provided by the townspeople sod several out in the country. It has been rumoured that the food was thrown about the floor in a reckless man ner; but I am requested to state that the report is utterly false, as the food provided was first-class, and none was wasted. The proceeds amounted to Â£5 1is. Mr. Geeo. Shopherd acted as treasurer and LM.C. and Mr. N. Hourn as secretary, each carry ing out his duties satisfactorily. \VWnaTnHR -The weather, which has been very frosty of late, has undergone another change.
