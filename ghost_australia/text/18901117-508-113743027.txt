Amusements. 'HERO AND LEANDEE.' On Saturday night Mrs. Potter and Mr. Eyrie Bellew appeared at the Royal in 'Hero and Leander,' a play in three acts specially written for Mrs. Potter, and produced under the sole direction of Mr. Bellew. The minds of the audi ence were attuned to the appreciation of this classical production by a preliminary farce, the joke of which turned upon a peaceable old bache lor travelling in' the north of England being mis taken for ' the Benieia Boy,' a .celebrated Ame1 rican prizefighter, and lionised accordingly. This was funny in a pantomime kind of way, and served to pass time. When it and a longish wait were satisfactorily over, the curtain rose on the first scene of the three-act play, and a gorgeous scene it was. There stood the temple of Aphrodite at Sestos, on the shores of the Helle spont, which itself was visible sparkling under a bright sun in the background. Before the temple, on a sort of court 'of rich mosaic, stood statues of Eros and Aphrodite, and around these^, vestals were winding wreathes. The picture was really a very beautiful realisation ef the thoughts contained in the well-known lines : Where the tints of the earth and the hues of the sky, In color though varied, in beauty may Tie And the purDle of ocean is deepest in dye ; Where the virgins are soft as the roses they twine, And all save the spirit of man is divine. 'Tis the clime of the East; 'tis the land of the Sun — Can he smile on such deeds as his children have done ? The spectator at the Royal, on passing from the aesthetic appreciation of scene painting, stage carpentry, and decoration to a study of what was done and said by the performers, experienced somewhat the same s«rt of revulsion of feeling that Byron long ago credited the sun with. He (the spectator) felt he could smile sometimes; but often in the wrong places. The plot fellows the classic story with fair fidelity. In the first act Hero (Mrs. Potter) at a festival at which she is to devote herself to the service of the goddess, captivates Leander (Mr. Bellew) who with his friend Nankieros (Mr. Hans Phillips), has ap parently come over from Abydos for the day. Kankleros in a bright blue frock — he is evidently the local buck of Abydos — is in a measure show ing Leander round. He regrets with some pro lixity that his protege, though, as Mr. Guppy would say, ' possessing everything calculated to charm the eye,' is unac countably diffident in the presence of young women. Leander at the Cestes festival, however, comes out in a way to astonish his mentor. Priestesses of Aphrodite were, so say learned authorities, allowed t» devote a brief interval before finally taking the vows to a fare well indulgence in the gaieties of the world. 'Hero and attendant vestals (Miles. Emma Gwynne, Ada Lawrence, and Dallas) utilise this welcome spell by an ancient Greek dance — something like a minuet. Naukleros, of course cuts in ; but he is fairly outdone by Leander. The latter, despite the disadvantage of ' not having come dressed ' (unless a deerskin with a 2in tail hanging in appropriate position', and a very rudimen tary shirt, can be regarded as the embryo of modern festive attire) foots it zealously with Her©. Further, he acquiesces in a plan for making a love declaration to her by means of an apple he has to award as prize of beauty ; has a fearful disturbance with Auloros, the High Priest (Mr. Edward Sass) and curses, and is cursed, until he brings on a thunderstorm. The scene closes with the High Priest sternly conducting Hero to the shrine, being therein ably assisted' by Zosta, a lame guardian of the Temple (Mr. A. G. Foul ton), a kind of classical Dick Deadeye. The second act is in Hero's Tower at Sestos. This is, too, a very beautiful picture. Hero is locked into her tower landward by the High Priest.There is, however, an opening towards the Hellespont. After the departure of the Priest — a person of abrupt and unpleasant manners — Hero perceives a lyre near her couch. She regrets that she has never learned to play it. Just as the audience is beginning: to think that, like the Irishman wh© tackled the violoncello she has made up her mind to 'try for all that,' she falls into another train of reflection. Shortly all fear of [a musical performance, akin to the gal lant struggles of Kaukleros and Leander with the mysteries of minuets, is dissipated by the arrival by water of the latter person, who has been guided by Hero's lamp, placed to shine sea ward. Leander, inreply to truly feminine reproaches that he might have been drowned, advances the characteristically masculine argument that lie has not been. He then, with great solemnity, exacts a kiss, given him under condition that during its administration he shall keep his arms behind his back. The operation, which to the spectators is of rather a chilling character, give3 so much satisfaction to the participants that they make an arrangement for a repetition the next night, and Leander, after much dodging of Zosta, who has a Paul Pry-like manner of turning up at the most inconvenient times, swims off again. The third act opens in Leander's hufc at Abydos. Naukleros has come in early in the morning and discovers that the owner has been out all night. Despite this somewhat compromising circumstance the early visitor is as full as ever of his friend's bashfulness. He is harping on this subject by way of soliloquy when the. object? of his reflections comes in much the worse for wear, and, instead of resenting Jjhje intrusion on his privacy, or attempting apochryphal ? stories about the healthfulness of walking before breakfast, pro ceeds to give a grossly exaggerated account of the bliss he has enjoyed the previous night, describing the kiss in most ungentlemanly detail. The scene then' changes to the Sestos shore of the Hellespont. ' Hero, . .in a , long, white garment, is. seen walking the starancl before ja very n^turai looking sea, heaving up and. down in the offing1.- She places her lamp on the rocks to guide Leander, then fifoes to sleep, and, whilst she is sleeping, Zosta and An^ros put .out the lamp. Soon there are cries 6i 'distress. Leander is sem' struggling in' the breakers ; he flings up his arms and sinks, and a second after ward he is flung dying on jfee beach./ 'Sst-ote^ proaches Auloros .and ' Zosta.

As has been, said, the scenery is beautiful. So are some of the dresses. Mrs. Potter's costumes were graceful: and becoming throughout.

(See Dickens' on this ?^^nfc)^-'5Sie.«xra»lapn;'*f.: the manly form inactateof semi-nudity is an innovation, and an undesirable one. This is written more especially for the benefit of Mr. Bellew. However he may interpret the old saying about beauty unadorned to apply to his own sex, or may wish to enter into competition with the ballet, he might be content with that liberal measure oi personal exposure that would be tolerated in the young women of the London Alhambra or the. Paris Eden. He might, for instance, draw the line at the sweet thing in blue gauze in -which he is drowned in the last act, and not obtrude himself in the earlier ones in an absence of attire re calling the prize ring. Singlets are inexpensive things, and, when, thin, are so nearly invisible as not to militate against a resemblance to ancient Grecian models./ Summing ' Hero and Leander' up, it is a series of very pretty tableaux spoiled' by the dialogue. The tragic drowning scene, which is a wonderful piece of stage carpentry, saves the performance from absolute flatness ; but, after all, the plot is one rather for an opera than a play. Treated in one way, the magnificent scenic effects that have been devised wouid make an incomparable setting for a grand work. In a comic vein the everlasting Naukleros singing ' For he's a bashful man,' instead of harping in blank verse on the good looks and unfortunate shyness of his friend, would bring down the House. As for the merits of the performers on Saturday night, Mrs. Potter and Mr. Bellew were somewhat stilted in the earlier scenes, but impressive and forcible in the last. The rest of the company made tne best of not very promising parts. Alhambka.. — Mr. Prank Smith gave another free concert at the Alhambra Music Hall on Sunday evening. The entertainment was an nounced to commence at 8 o'clock, but before half -past 7 the building began to fill rapidly and numbers had to be refused admission. The pro gramme was an excellent one, and thoroughly ap preciated by the large audience. Mr. W. Ryan sang, 'Alice, Where Art Thou,' very nicely, and was followed by Miss Tessie Cleveland, who con tributed ' Come ' Back to Erin,' 'and later on, ' Pi-j-a-back Ride/' both songs being well re ceived. Mr. W. Downes was encored for his selec tions, 'Angel Baby's Pace,' and 'Meet Me at the Mill.' Miss Amy Eowe did justice to her songs, ' Life's Story,' and ' Creep into Bed, Baby.' The ' Song for Me' was nicely rendered by Miss Lucy Praser, and Mr.& Barrihgton sang ' Our Crew' in good style. Miss Alma. Obrey and Mr. Martyn Hagan were loudly applauded for their songs ' My Heart at Home in Old Ireland' and ' Come Back.' Mr. Arthur Parley was in good voice, and sang ' I'm Lonely To-night ' in his usual style. A gentleman amateur recited 'The Battle of Pontenby;' and the orchestra, under the direction of Mr; It; Lockhead, rendered several choice selections during the evening. BoTAirr.— Notwithstanding that the weather yesterday bore a threatening aspect, a large num ber of people journeyed to Mr. Prank Smith's p«pular grounds at Botany. The visitors spent an enjoyable afternoon in wandering, among the beautiful plants and shrubs with which the place abounds. A grand concert was given in the large pavilion, in which the members of Mr. Prank Smith's talented company took part. The Obchestbal Concerts.— The last of a series of 10 orchestral concerts was given on Saturday afternoon in the Centennial Hall, and was more numerously attended than any of the preceding concerts of the series had been. The programme was a fine one, although several of the numbers on it had been performed at previous concerts of the series, and some of them more than once. The novelties were an allegretto from Beethoven's Symphony in F. Major Eo. 8, a reverie for strings by Emile Dunkler, and a selection from Gounod's 'La. Colombo,' all of which were splendidly played. The first of these pieces was short, but characteristic of the great composer who wrote it, and' would, of course, have appeared to greater advantage if the whole symphony had been heard, and not merely a fragment of it. Dunkler's compositions for the violoncello are well known to 'cellists, and his' ' Reverie ' is designed to show his favorite instrument to' ad vantage. The Entr' Acte from Gounod was hght and very melodious, and contrasted strongly with some of rather heavy and noisy German music. The gem of the concert, however, was Mendels sohn's evergreen concerto in G ininor, which was magnificently played by Madame Keller man on the piano, and was accompanied by the orchestra. This, fine .work was listened to with rapt and prof ound attention, and at the close of the performance of it the pianist was recalled to receive floral honors and a most enthusiastic ovation of. applause. One more concert is to be added to the series already given, but this, which will take place on Saturday, 22nd instant, will be a complimentary one, tendered by the orchestra to their skilful and accomplished conductor. Signor Hazon certainly deserves on such an occasion a full house, and we hope he'll have one. We believe that the, subject of a second series of orchestral concerts' is under con sideration, but that no decision has as yet been arrived at. . . GoVEBNICENTPfilNTINGOPMCEPxOKIC!. — Bright genial weather favored the annual outing of the staff connected with the Government Printing Office on Saturday. The teindezvous was Clon tarf, to which pleasure resort the , steamers Prin cess, Leyerett, and Waterview conveyed upwards of 1000 persons. The boats plied tj) and fro until long after noon; and * the pleasure-seekers found ample recreation at their .destination. Upon arriving the majority took Jbo ^whatever was most convenient, and wh§h tired of the pleasures afforded they sat down; jfco a banquet, at which a series of toasts were proposed. Mr. W.
