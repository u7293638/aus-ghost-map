OLD TRICKS REVIVED. A gang of forgers Js reported by "The Times" to have been for Bome time endea vouring to pass off forged cheques on Lon don bankers by an artful and complicated ..rlieme. Hut the scheme practised is pre cisely which was carried out by the ,-clebrated Jim the Penman (Jim Saward) m 1S56, the full story of whose career was ? ,,1,1 Jn "The Australasian" of May G, 1899. The Times" writer, who seems not to :uvc heard of Jim the Penman, says that r.c of the gang calls upon a firm of solici ,1s and asks for particulars of properly ? ivertised for sale. After obtaining this iforniation he requests an interview with member of the firm, whom he instructs , apply for payment of an amount due to ? mi from a person who is able but refuses i pay. The debtor's address as furnished r the creditor turns out to be a shop where Hers may be left for a small fee. The ? In itors, on applying to the pretended ..btor. rectivo art instalment, and on their niuli'iiig from the creditor whether they hull forward the amount to hiin, he re iiests them to forward it to his address; TWEEDLEPUNC'II AND DOLOURS (MISS CARRIE MOORE) GIVE AN AFTERNOON ENTERTAINMENT AT AHERCOED CASTLE.

KENNINGHAM). after a short time a second instalment is received, and this is also sent to the credi tor's address, generally a temporary one. Having thus obtained a couple of cheques signed by the solicitors, the gang then pro cure in some way or other a blank cheque of the hank at which the solicitors keep their account, and lWge both the clerk's writing and the signature of the firm. The forged cheque is drawn for a large ,iiumiill, and, as solicitors ofi.cn draw out considerable sums in notes for the comple tion of purchases of pioperties, this does not excite suspicion. The method of cash ing the cheque is equally crafty. An ad vertisement is inserted for a clerk, and the applicants are requested to an' ly at an office engaged for the occasion. The selected applicant is then directed to take a cheque tc the bank", and get it cashed in Â£100 notes. One of the gang follows him, and if the cheque is paid he waits to see whether the clerk is watched as he leaves the bank. If the course is clear, he takes the money from the clerk at an appointed place, and at another spot he divides the spoil with his confederates, iiach of them then goes at once to a foreign exchange office, and cashes his notes into francs. 'The forging of the writing in the body of the cheque and of the signature is almost perfect. In order to make it impossible to trace the book from which the cheque has been taken, the number of the cheque is often obliteratd and another put in its place, and, with the same object the name of the branch is erased and another substituted for it in almost identical type.
