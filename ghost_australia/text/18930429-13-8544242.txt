THE GHOSTS OF THE TROPICAL FOREST. (FROM an SrKflA.oit ) In the African and the Asiatic Archipelago, the rare four-footed animals that live in the solitary forests are, for the most part, creatures of the night. Unlike the lively squirrels and martin-cats of temperate regions, they do not leave their hiding places till the tropical darkness has fallen on the forest, when they seek their food, not on the surface of the ground, but, imitating the birds, ascend to the upper surface of the ocean of trees, and at the first approach of dawn seek refuge from the hateful day in the dark recesses of some aged and hollow trunk. There is nothing like the lords of the lemur in the fauna of temperate Europe. Mrs may rather compare them to a race of arboreal moles, the condition of whose life is darkness and in- visibility. But, unlike the moles, the smaller members of these rarely seen tribes are among the most beautiful and interesting creatures of the tropics, though the extreme difficulty of capturing creatures whose whole life is spent on the loftiest forest trees is further increased by the reluctance of the natives to enter the deserted and pathless forests. The beautiful lemurs, most of which are found in Madagascar, are further believed by the Malagasy'! to embody the spirits of their ancestors and the weird and plaintive cries with which they fill the groves at night, uttered by creatures whose bodies, as they cling to the branches, are invisible, and whose delicate movements are noiseless, many well have left a doubt on the minds of the first discoverers of the island as to whether these were not in truth the cries and wailings of true l√©ures, the unquiet ghosts of the departed. Several of the larger lemurs are to be found at the " Zoo," and though these suffer so much if unduly exposed to the light that before long they lose their sight, they may occasionally be seen in their cages. Others, the rarest and most delicate members of the race, are so entirely creatures of darkness that their exposure to daylight seems to be numb all their faculties. They appear drugged and stupified, and though capable of movement, seem indisposed either to attempt escape when handled, or to move in another direction than that of shelter from the odious day. Even food is refused before nightfall, and, unlike the epicure's orations, which awake and feed in a darkened room when- ever the rays of a lamp suggest the sunrise, the lemur only consumes its meal of fair and munprs when nightfall line aroused its drowsy wits These midnight habits clear!) unfit it for public exhibition at the ' Zoo and the last and rarest of the tube which have arrived in London occupy a private room adjacent to the monkey palace in common with other lemurs and sons, and a few of the most delicate marmoset and tropical monkeys which have escaped the rigours of an English writer One large cage, which, in spite of the label ' Coqucrcls Lemur placed upon it, seemed at the time of our last visit to contain nothing but a pile of hay is the dwelling place of these latest guests After displacing 4ft) or after la) er of the way, the two sleeping beauties were discovered lying a bill, each with its long furs) tail wrapped round the other, in the deepest and most unconscious n pose When at last the two were separated, and the least reluctant was taken in the hand, the extreme beauty of the little ' ghost was at once apparent In colour it is a rich corner mon, failing to lavender beneath J he texture of the bar is like nothing but that of the finest and best finished seal Bkm jacket only for deeper and closer so that the hand sinks into it us into a. bed of moss The head is large and most in telligent the fine being set with a pair of very large round hazel eyes, in which the lines of the orbit seem not to radiate from the centre, but to be arranged in circles, like the la) i m of growth in the section of a tree The long tail is at the base almost as wide as the body, tapering to a point and covered with deep fur But the greatest beauty of form which the league ovina in the shape of its hands and foot These exquisite little members are so far in exact reproduction of Her m,n , hind as if not null flu. h nuts but also the best, own a full) developed thumb But each mater, as well as the thumb, expands in the roof into a tin) disc is in certain tree frogs, so that the little hands may elm,, to the tree with the tight mess of an air pump It is plain, as the half sley ping lemur climb) our the arms and shoulders of its visitor, that it takes him for a tree The little aims are stretched wide apart thotln'inbs and fingers are spread and grasp each fold of the coat with the anxious care of one who thinks that a slip in will cause a fall of a hundred feet, and the soft boil) and tail ball envelop the limb down which they are descending, lifting to the surface like some warm enveloping boat As soon as it n aches the bay pile in the cage the lemur instantly burrows, its long tail vanishing like a snake, and in a minute it is once more asleep and unconscious of the world.
