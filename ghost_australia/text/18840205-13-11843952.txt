THE HIGHER FACULTIES OF MAN. The Rev Dr 15romb> gave the last lecture of his horses on the above subject at St Paul's Pro Cathedral on Sunday evening. There was a large congregation The rev gentleman those for his text I Peter i JJ ' Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost Dr IinouM said - There are three huge volumes from which man may derive some knovvlctl-eol Gods wonderful things They are the Book of Nature, the Book of Providence and the Book of Revelation The Book of Nature is the 1 large range of lambs) treated d things, and in it man can read the sill lime store of C id h gum 1 tir Hld imagine scene as well as of His insult me and bench sence He may run uni read it in the rolling or s of I ii is above his head and around him in every fruit shut up as and every lion or that blooms. the book of Providence is that thou"htful!irraii-cnientGod has made for the comfort and convenience of all living things, and especially for the rational part of His creation He has endowed men with free will, left them for a time to act upon their own responsibility) without giving any account of themselves flee to conduct their affairs in their own vi iv modified only by those checks which the collision of their several interests and the ebullition of their various passions inevitable) engender Leith these volumes are hills 1 with scenes of wonder How do we wonder when we try to conceive how a film of corn should be able by its own unaided efforts to germinate and grow to the perfection of its being I But much more does it exists in wonder when we try to conceive how gross matter should be endowed with various passions with reason, and with 1 distinct vi will not be enabled to act as independently as if it had been 21 II treated and come into I cm- a) on raucously) And then we turn to the book 01 Revelation that we are carried to regions of tluniJit no higher still We are brought into immediate communie n with our Maker our ninth Conscience is appealed to and our conscience reap miles to the appeal there is discord I am Us a future beyond the grave 1 in the enjoyment in which we are distinctly said that this world is only a preliminary scene of preparation and sundry other topics are touched upon with which man's eternal welfarcisintimatel) connected but now in discussing the contents of this third volume, it is particularly noticeable that in place of that calm placidity which is the proper philosophic temper of all engaged in the search after truth, a large amount of action is discernible In but to such a degree of ferocity bus this religious exa"speration ate times arisen, til it pious men have been thrown into dungeons by other pious men, stoned to death or burned alive, for putting upon the revealed will of God in interpretations with which the others could not agree the reason of this appears to be that in perusing the two former volumes we were all much more easily to stand aloof we had no particular personal interest in what we studied and marvelled at. But now we are called on by the voice of God not to be thinkers only but to take an active part in the most important scenes of the great drama of life: moreover it has become necessary to invest a definite order of men with authority to teach and expound to administer discipline, and to conduct certain religious ordinances. Religion, there fore, now assumes a political respect and is exposed to all those turbulent passions which almost invariably accompany the active ex ercise of political functions. It has often happened that in the decision of theological questions worldly power and wealth were at stake ; and then, of course, would self interest lend its aid to intensify the bitterness of polemical controversy But even without this, religious feelings are always of so sensi tive a nature that men without any secular interest at stake are capable of being exasperated to an intense degree of religious difference, and even to persuade themselves that by putting their fellow creatures to death for what they call their heretical opinions they are doing God service. Let us then, my friends, in judging of the religious opinions of others, be on our guard against being too hasty to condemn and particularly let us not assume that any article in a similar creed is necessarily true because the sanctity of antiquity, or the authority of some famous n une can be pleaded in its favour We turn then now to ascertain where the revealed will of God is to be found the Christian of course, replies at once that it is to be found in Scripture and as I am addressing, a Christian audience, that answer for the present shall be enough But we proceed further to inquire how the Scriptures were framed, but how handled down to us For we are not now supposing ouiselves to be sitting at the feet of Gamaliel, and prepared to accept with unquestioning docility what ever statements may be made to us, however deserving of deferential regard our reverend teachers may be from their well known learn- ing or their long tried integrity But give me supposing ourselves to be reviewing in a judicial spirit the evidences of our responsibility to God, by putting to their proper use those high faculties with which the Omnipotent Creator has gifted us. We have faith, but we have also reason, and our faith is not so strong but that, if not supported by reason, it may give way under the severe pressure it may have to bear. Our religion appeals to our conscience to discharge many difficult duties, and with much self denial to abstain from gratifications which for a season would really delight the natural man. Conscience tells us in a certain vague way that we shall have to give account of these things—of the manner in which we have done our duty and how far we have resisted temptation but the tribunals is very distant, and in the regions of the case in , nor can its existence be proved to us with the same certainty as those things can with which daily experience makes us familiar Our moral sense may show us the beauty of rectitude and the vileness of fraud and false- hood, and there are certain natural delicacies of feeling which there are the propriety of observing rules of chastity and decorum, but without divine sanction appealing per emptorily to the conscience, how feeble would all such human endowments be in warding off the continually recurring assaults of wickedness and vice ! How very important then is it that we should have a firmly estab blished and rational confidence in those divine communications which give their sanction to the threats and the promises of God ' Now here we might naturally enough think that the readiest way of meeting the requirements of the case would be for a code of laws to be sent direct from the court of Heaven with such unmistakable credentials as should con- strain every man to believe the genuineness of the communication Such a thought occurred to the mind of Mahomet when he would impose a code of laws upon the consciences of his ignorant and excitable followers The Angel Gabriel (he alarmed) brought down the sacred Koran direct from the throne of the Most High And other more vulgar impostors have pretended that they have been similarly favoured The Christian Scriptures make no such preten- sion They profess to be a collection of books written the very various periods by highly gifted men They claim however as a whole to be inspired that the minds of the writers though they are not all mentioned by name were under the influence of the Holy Spirit of God generally in that ordinary way in which a Christian man (is truly a Christian is at present day but at times also man extraordinary way when e communications were made which could not otherwise have become known Now here re ian steps in and asks for evidence As I pointed out in my last lecture the religion of the Christ in is essentially a reasonable religion It ever appeals to the under st in but- I speak unto wise men (cries the Apostle I ml) judge ye what I say I know, my friend is that there are some timid and sensitive Christians who start up in alarm when the intellect is called I in to the aid of religion as it it were on that account in imminent peril or as if we were guilty of profanity in mingh\ling»human ratiocination with matters so much beyond all human comprehension and it is not to be denied that good cause has frequently been given for much uneasiness But unless the reason is duly exercised what security would there be against the grossest forms of superstition If we are to accept in a reverential and childlike spirit everything which religious teachers might choose to tell us how could we stop short of worshipping winking Madonnas or reverently bowing at the annual liquefac tion of St Januarius's blood? The credibility of any facts whatever must necessarily depend upon the evidence by which it can be supported. To believe any thing upon insufficient evidence is a manifest weakness We designate it ere duty and it exposes us to all sorts of reception and delusion On the other hand to withhold our belief in the face of adequate testimony is either stupidity or obsti nate prejudice, engendered it may be by self interest or passion But then what is adequate evidence to answer that question still fully would take a whole evening to itself so very various is the nature of con vincing evidence Sometimes the minds conviction of truth depends upon the direct testimony of two or three credible witnesses but quite as commonly it is produced by a multitude of fragmentary circumstances all pointing in the same direction to taken very familiar illustration we may suppose a geometrical figure to have been drawn originally with sundry lines all radiating from a common centre and subsequently to have been smeared over irregularly by some rude hand yet if only a few fragments of the original lines were left they would be quite enough to enable a skilful hand to discover where the central point had been, and to restore the whole figure again. On this principle it will be found that our sacred scriptures continues a surprising body of evidence in favour of their Divine origin so numerous are the small points of evidence all bearing the same way The number of writers is very considerable, and the topics they deal with as numerous us almost have ever interested humanity philosophy), my thology.archicology history, poetry sociology, morals, manners., and religion The authors of many of the books are unknown the known authors were not both se yes, and of every rank of life, some among the most learned of their time, some members of an august priesthood some of royal rank and others, again simple minded herdsman or fishermen these writers moreover, were born in countries veey wide apart speaking divers languages and habituated to customs and usages e exccedingly dissimilar and our that still hung at different epochs in the great stream of time whose fleets me know but in general so corrosive and obliterated And yet notwithstanding all these diversities and changing incline need this issues a remarkable convergence to one "nat truth such a oneness in their religious views, such a uniform and distinctive con ception regarding the Almighty Creator and Governor of the Universe and no unlike what is found in the religions of the rest of the world, that we in constrained to attribute this remarkable result to some over powering cause and the cause which the Scriptures themselves assign is so satisfactory and in such exact accordance with other Divine economies that the more the whole of this Divine dispensation for the salvation of man is investigated the more probable does it appear The different parts fit in to their places with con sistent propriety and to the mind's eye the scheme assumes proportions at once harmonious and majestic It is wonder ml and to the pious soul most gratifying lies, in the Ion,, ten the reason not tmh acquiesces 111 but therewith) admires the IJinnc procedure thus iirif)ingllic scripture statementtliatwiB corn is justified b) W istana s children is does not belong to me pleasant purpose this evening to enumerate in detail all the and minds of the particular term in which it has phase 1 the Almighty) that scrap ture should be mitta n Hld revealed truth h mile 1 down from gi neration to generation I have in mind collateral advantage. lUir s)nipithiciiiirc e charge 1 toward the fair rent members of the human family - a wider liberty is secured for h form- different ah i les of billet in accordance with the anning charm tersol different men or the hills but political systems under which they may be man-, or the different degrees of Raines in the world as science advances and fresh discoveries are made What we are (living larly dwelling upon now is that the peculiar form in which revolution is carried affords such an abundance of materials 1er stab hshingiU credibility Even the very uncle aunties and apparent discrepancies in the written word have their uses and are by no means out of harmony with the rest >t God's dealings with men Like the winds and waves and ever recurring at arms of the physical world they give occasion I r the exercise of his higher mental melon ments for his discernment and his vagrant) his capability of sifting evidence and for eliciting the truth Thus his interest is excited, his mind stimulated into health) activity and his faith much more firmly established There is just one other mental attribute upon which I desire to say a few words before I close this series of lectures on the higher faculties of man and that is the dream a strange intermediate state of consciousness " Vi hen truth that is and truth that seem Elix in fantastic strife But I hear the question objectively asked, would you class that trivial and unsubstan- real thing, the dream, with the higher faculties of man The dog basking in the sun shine will not unfrequently be seen to dream His whimpering cries just au ble, and the spasmodic movement of his limbs, conclusively prove that his brain is being excited by some imaginary scene of stirring interest.
