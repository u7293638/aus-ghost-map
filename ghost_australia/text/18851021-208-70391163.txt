S QUEENSFERRY. (CcoM3DUNICATED). The quiet little township of Queensferry h lately been invaded by an elder from the Church of Latter Day Saints; or Mormons, as they are commonly called. He holds services at' Queensferry about six times a week, and at the Bass River saw mills, being the only places in the district which the elder at present favors with his presence. About six years ago the first saint came to Queensferry, when he was supposed to have made two or three converts. Two years since another came, and stayed here six or eight months, getting a few more, and starting a branch of their church here, which for a while kept together, but have not added to their numbers Latterly nothing has been heard of it, for what reasons I cannot tell, but the elder coming in the nick of time has stirred them up again, and they are noiv to all appearances as faithful as ever. Their doctrines, as far as I can judge, are as follows:--Baptism by immersion; lav ing on hands for the Holy Ghost, working of .miracles the same as the apostles of old, which most churches believe are no longer needed; they also believe in reve lation, prophesying, dreams, etc.; also that our churches are of man, not of God; that they are not inspired to preach and have no authority for doing: so. Alto gether their'doctrine is totally opposed to our churches. It is a pity-none of the heads of the different churches here care to oppose his statements, as no doubt it is their duty to do, so, and he is willing to. hold a discussion on his doctrines, which at the present time would be satisfactory to a lotofpeople in the district. Thereis. no doubt if he were to go into our cities. and toiwrs he would be taken up. I hope, this will be the means of' inducing, some bodyto champion the cause of the Christian, Churches and not leave us completely-in the clutches'of the LatteuDay Saints..
