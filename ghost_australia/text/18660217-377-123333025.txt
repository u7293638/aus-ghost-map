The Leielhhardt is advertised to sailfor the rolothern Ports on Tuesday. Thie Goveranment steamer Kate has been with dnmra, from competition with private vessels in'the river trade. ]For tile fture she will begmpljd erxclutsively Ibr Government butsin.es.- .66666 Tni CasiRi G losersYo.--This vessel ''in 'I ]isbaue Roads about soundown oil Wedncesday fter a passage of one houndred days from Coahaven. She was six days in rigdht of the Queensland coast, but could not emake Cape Moreson, owing to adverse wind, and camis. The Ceoar Godeifroy brings out 318 German imunigrants, under the ,medicalcharge of Dr. Berntein, hlo darilg the passage has userd into the world six little sliangere. lThe deaths were only two in eunmber--a womnan who died in childbed, asld an insliat a year and a Iulf old. Throughoutthe voyage the health of thle pu.-sengers, as maybe sup posed, has been good, and -esterday the ship 'was visited by Dr. Purdie. and passed with a clean bill of health.-l id. - Saop BlILrInG 1is uaessxv.--Oa Thmsndayfore scooe a fine schlooner yachlt 'a lasumeld from the building ynrd of Mr. I.. 3Monk, et South Brisbane, for thle hloe. I. Harris. The vessel ic question is an old frieed, liknown as thle ticmlet's Ghost, and sie has undergone such a mealmeorphdosis that no one nae quainted with hier origilla form would recognise hler as the same €,r..ft. Hier hlistoy lhas not been an us rceetfil o ne. The original "t host," s as she is femi lirhl called, was ,built on a coral reef off our north east coat- by tIhe enat-awoty crew ofa w-lsingsghooner belonging to Sydney, numed the Prince of Denmak.l The reel had bhcu occupied by tie master of thlis shaler, Clettoin Bennclts , as a depot for storems, &c; and it was in approasclhing it that that tvessel wrecked. TIc rews reached the depot in safISy by meanes of the boat ; and to escape from this dreary and desolute opot they built i boat out of thie remains of the schooner end some boat pluks wbich Captain Beuneltt had in storu. lu her Capttin Bennett and his crew, after suffering considerable hardships, sue ceeded in reaching this port. Subsequently she wa~b purchased by her present owner for £100. He laid out a considerable sun upon her to fit her for the lightering trade, and had her altered from a schooner to a ketch. As a lighter she was not a profitable vcessel, owing to lher small capacity for cargo, nud ultimately she was laid. up. More recently she wua placed in the hands of Mr. Monk to convert lhel' into a pleasure yacht, and the result my hbe seen in the smart little schooner now moored off his yard at ithe south side. Mr. Monk Ihas also ou Ihand a vessel of a very different cluss. We allude to the light-ship bulding for the Queeusland Government, aud in tended to be stationed at Keppel Bay. Within a hundred yards of this vessel Mr. W. Pettigrew lhas tihe keel of a steamer laid. This vessel will be about 30 tones burthen, with a light dlaught, and is intended to tow ratils of timber for the supply of his extensive Ssawnils.-Courier.
