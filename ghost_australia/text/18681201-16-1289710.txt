SOCIAL. Otra local Almanac informs us that " summer commences on the 22nd of December, at which time the sun enters the tropic of Capri- corn." This may be scientifically correct, but if the sun has not entered Capricorn for the last fortnight he has been somewhere just as bad, staring at us day after day, and sending the thermometer up to treble figures " in the shade, which in England would be regarded as a decidedly high range for spring As it happens: every year, or at any rate four years out of fire, that we have these same hot dry springs, it might be supposed that we had learned either to endure them with becoming fortitude, or take some measures for neutralising their disastrous effects, but such is not the case, and so every year, from October to Christ- mas, there is the same complaints about the uncomfortable heat, and the disastrous effects of the drought during the e month" We are just now in the very thick of these periodical murmurings Every man, and nearly every telegram, from the interior brings tidings of the loss and suffering which is being endured from the absence of rain From Roma, in the south west, to the Belyando River in the north west, the burden is still the same, the only difference being that the northern settlers seem suffering even more severely than those in the south The worst of it is that beyond the coast ranges summer does not always bring the seasonable rains which can be calculated upon almost to a certainty on the lands lying between those ranges and the sea Neither do these inside settlers get the benefit of the occasional thunder showers which fall on the coast lands, but day after day they are tantalised with the sight of heavy masses of clouds which pass over to the coast without leaving a drop on the- parched lands and diminishing waterholes In the neighborhood of Brisbane we have had several thunder showers during the last four weeks, the heaviest of which fell on the Prince of Wales' birthday, November 9, a day which 13 always observed as a close holiday in Australia The morning of that day looked dull and threatening enough to prevent all prudent persons from going out, but then few people are troubled with an excess of prudence on such occasions, so picnic parties and pleasure excur- I Eions were undertaken as usual and every one who joined in them got terribly frightened and thoroughly drenched The wind blew with great violence for about half an hour, and the rain was so heavy and thick as to prevent objects from being seen when only a few yards distant Considerable damage was done to verandahs and roofs of homes in the vicinity of Brisbane, but the only accidents of consequence was the upsetting of a ferry boat at one of the ferries, by which an old resident of Brisbane, Captain Cooley, lost his life, and a boy killed by the lightning at Ipswich These, however, do not include all the fatal accidents which have occurred during the month, nor is it necessary to mention them in detail here, as they appear in another column, but one of these was of so singular and her able a character, that it may be referred to Mr G D F Voehell, son of a clergyman of Lon don, with his brother, Hamilton Vachell, owned a farm at the Rocky Water holes, a few miles from Brisbane, and on the afternoon of the 14th ultimo, the former of the two brothers was on a haystack, when he slipped and fell on a pitchfork one of the prongs of which entered his body between the legs, and passed up into the abdomen nearly the whole length of the prong The poor fellow lingered in great agony for two or three hours, and then expired A third brother, who had come out from England in the Storm King, to join them, landed at Brisbane the same evening Another occurrence, which was not an accident, has created a profound sensation here namely, the attempt to murder Mr A W Manning Under Colonial Secretary, by a man named F S Bowerman, late Police Magistrate at Leyburn, near Warwick Bowerman joined the Civil Service of New South Wales about seventeen years ago, and was soon after sent up to the Moreton Bay district, where he has held responsible situations under Government ever since, for when separation from New South Wales took place be elected to remain, and was appointed under the Queensland Government Only a few months ago he was advanced to the office of Police Magistrate at Leyburn, but, in consequence of something to his disadvantage coming to the knowledge of the head of the department respecting him he was reduced to a subordinate position, and subsequently was suspended On the morning of the 24th ultimo Bowerman waited upon Mr Manning at his office, respecting this matter, (the particulars of which have not yet been made public) Mr Manning found it to be his duty to reject the proposals made by Bowerman, when the latter went out, purchased a new American tomahawk and returned to Mr Manning's office about noon with it under his coat He first asked Mr Manning to read a letter which his (Bowerman'e) wife had written, and when this was refused he attacked Mr Manning with the weapon, inflicting four ghastly wounds on the head, two of which penetrated the skull and exposed the brain Strange to say, Mr Manning was not rendered insensible, and is rapidly recovering Bowerman was at once taken into custody, and is remanded until his intended victim is sufficiently recovered to appeal against him It has only been a few months since we had to record the execution of an ex Police Magistrate, Griffin, for the murder of the two men forming the Clermont gold escort So it seems we have managed to get some very queer folk into our service in Queensland News has come to hand that another criminal has come to grief, namely the pseudo nobleman, Count Von Attora, late valet of the genuine Count This gentleman honored Sydney and Brisbane with his presence, and at each place he succeeded in making dupes among the tuft hunting, nobility worshiping citizens At Sydney he was particularly successful in obtaining costs and credit on the strength of the representations he made At Brisbane he bought a yacht called the Hamlet's Ghost, and sailed away to the spice islands, but on reaching Sourabaya the practical matter of fact Dutch business clement appears to have been too much for him, and he has been arrested for " negociating fraudulent docu ments as the telegram delicately puts it Whether he will again revisit these shores, and if so, under what auSpices, arc speculations of little consequence to all except his victims There are greater criminals than he at large in the world, and justice remains as blind as ever Captain Hughes, of the barque Eaglet and his second mate, Gillott, were tried at the Criminal Sittings of the Supreme Court, a fortnight ago, on a charge of cruelty, which caused the death of a seaman named Bray, during the last voyage from England Bray gradually sank and died two days before the vessel reached Moreton Bay, but though the evidence was very strong against Hughes and Gillett, somehow or other the jury returned a verdict of not guilty against both captain and mate, and they have been set at liberty The fourth Parliament of Queensland was opened on November 17, by commission, but the following day His Excellency the Governor attended in state to read the wife regal speech As it was the first time he had been called upon to perform this ceremony, and as it took place in the new Parliament House, which is now nearly completed, the ceremony was unusually imposing The Legislative Council Chamber, one of the finest buildings in the Australian colonies, was crowded with ladies, and outside a large crowd collected and cheered His Excellency most lustily, both on his arrival and departure No sooner was the ceremony over than the members of the " lower " House set to work with the business before them, and in two nights succeeded in getting a division on a want of confidence motion against the late Ministry The motion was negatived only by the casting vote of the Speaker so the Ministry resigned Another set of Ministers have succeeded them, and now the business of the country-the last business thought about in Parliament-is again at a stand still while the new advisers of His Excellency get re elected Before the late Ministry announced their resignation, an attempt was made to get a select committee appointed to enquire into the working of our Gold- fields Act and Regulations, but it did not succeed And yet there is great necessity for such an enquiry, because it is well known by diggers and persons interested in gold mining pursuits that the Mining Act and Regulations are greatly in need of improvement, in order to adapt them to the improved circumstances of our gold fields Surface alluvial diggings is nownearlyat an end on all the principal fields and quartz reefing, which requires large capital and a large extent of ground to make it remunerative, is the only mining talked of, except at the Cape River diggings By the present Gold fields Act only small areas are allowed to be worked as amalgamated claims, except under conditions which are exceedingly irksome and uselessly expensive The news of the discovery of gold in South Africa has had the usual effect upon numbers of the diggers at Gympie, and other places, and " off to Africa is the common answer given by men who are seen to be clearing out, to those who wish to ascertain where they are going to next In the meantime the yield of gold from all the principal reefs at Gympie continues satisfactory, and although three crushing machines are now at work, there is still a cry for more among diggers who have large quantities of stone already on the surface The Cawarral reefs near Rockhampton are reported to be yielding good stone Of the other gold fields of the colony there is nothing new to record, except that at Cape River the reefs are not thought so highly of as they were when first discovered, and alluvial digging is not progressing, on account of the present great scarcity of w over
