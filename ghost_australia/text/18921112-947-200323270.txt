'HOW SHALL WE DECIDE THIS QUESTION P'v ???????? .7 , Now, which is the' worse— to have no \dpp'etitefor your dinner, ortohavtno dinner ?for your appetite ?. ' i There are lots of people on the one side ;orthe.other of this question; When 'good- : digestion waitsfon appetite and health on uuuu, i luuu,. jh uqbv iueai awiiiuae ot a .person towards hip meals. But most of us are riot blessed in that way; we. either, 'have.two much food without , an appetite,. ,pr a vigorous appetite without /enough toi :satisfy if. 'Different folk will answer this, .question differently, yet ;the common sense of it is that, within reasonable limits, itis- better to have an appetite without a dinner, ? because, short ot the starvation line, a hungry man is a healthy man; whereas a man who ought to eat' and doesn't feel like eating,,stands in need of ' alterations arid repairs.' : To illustrate. We recently received a comunication in which the writer says; ' I wes afraid to eat.'. Did he fancy his food was poisoned, or did his nature rebel, against the nourishment lived on ? If the latter, why ? Let him clear the mystery : himself. ? He says, 'In the year 1889 I changed my work from railway porter to signalman. J. naa been signalman twelve months, and then all at once, so to speak I did not feel.' myself.
