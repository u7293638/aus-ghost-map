Of ' -* 57 " DAVID'S GHOST' AND THE EIGHT-HOUR 9th MOVEMENT. in SIR-You will perhaps excuse me for troubling you with a few lines on what was advanced in your Thursday's issue by David's Ghost" ( ja. As the unearthly creature makes its debut by ian "performing duty that any citizen should do" ,, it may be worth while to examine how far this duty, as conceived and performed by a Ghost," I and is worthy of being copied and rehearsed by a hat citizen The duty, as per ton mod, consists in giving di' expression, that, it feels "that the subject has I his been agitated mostly by persons who have no desire [ sod for the public good, but only for popularity), and j etc who are actuated by an endeavour to rush parties have who are struggling hard for a living " It has a lot desire to see the eight hours system adopted, but .. not at present, for it a certain party had got the contract, the eight hours would not been held up a for some time, and it would be an act of injustice or" to gentlemen who have taken contracts at a specified mt sum It don't feel a pleasure in puddling in dirty and water and not seeing any one else do, it has sor done it, to show those deluded persons the object of one of then agitators ey, Now this last portion of "duty" performed by in David's Ghost," were it true, would convey to my mind a serious reflection on the incapacity and credulity of the working men of Brisbane, but is it "is time that they suffered themselves to be deluded ii, by one of their agitators ' no , it is not true, for as they not only detested his design, and heated him and as he deserved, but they have also detested his no Ghost," endeavouring, under cover of performing ° a duty, aiming to fasten on the working class what he he himself failed to accomplish It is likely enough that the meeting in the North a' Australian Hotel was got up through his agency, at, but whether this was the case or not, it is a matter to of slight account, as I know that a society with of] which he is connected has for some time back discussed the propriety of revising the movement with the view of making the eight-hour system ld more unanimously adopted Seeing that it was T- t talked over by a not unimportant section ii- of operatives, it becomes a matter of ay small consequence who took the first step .:, The meeting at the North Australian Hotel passed * off without there being made any arrangement for a future operations and the movement was therefore be kept in the hands of a few, who considered that any future meetings for promoting the eight hours should not be held in public- houses, as such places were thought to be highly objectionable The me next meeting was held in Day's Temperance Hotel, at its object was the formation of a committee, it He was well attended, as the largest room in the house as was so crowded that the windows had to be put up, in that those outside might hear what proceedings re were being enacted A secretary, treasurer, and Id a committee of 30 were chosen, and it was agreed that a meeting of the committee should be held in the same place the fourth night following At . this meeting 22 of the committee met, when some 18 resolutions were hard birnie them for selection and nppiOMil, bernie being submitted to the then he contemplated meeting that was to be held at the .n School of Arts in- The resolution agreed to as a first one, was set up- tied without much trouble, the second resolution, he setting forth the plan by which the movement was to be guided, came next for consideration, and B> amongst the number had before the committee was one by the landlord of the hotel. It simply asserted or that the eight hours should be unanimously adopted is on the 10th of April, and a great deal of discussion ^ arose on this one being lead, as to the impolicy of ' enter taming such dictators and arbitrary views on the settlement of a question that affected the ins and terests of employees as much as our own It was he urged by some that it should not be put to the vote, but the persistent advocacy of its framer overcame this objection, and as it was the last one lend to the meeting, it became the first one put to the vote Eleven voted for it, and ten against it, and five out of the ten immediately rose and declared that they ii could now connect themselves no further with the s, movement as they were convinced that such a mode of procedure would do more harm than good, however much it might serve the seemingly venomed s" intention of its former. As the business of the 0 meeting became a dead stand, and a break-up was iv threatened two of the eleven recanted, and ahmed k that they had voted for the resolution without suf ,t evidently considering it Its firmer on the other hand, maintained that it was as clear as daylight e that such dark deception was neither fair, square, n straightforward, nor consistent with manliness, and \- if irresolution was to be treated in this way, he u would withdraw it and himself too The sense of the meeting was not taken on this resolve, as it ley ceived the spontaneous and unanimous assent of c every one present. r Thus ended the connection of him who discovered that the working classes were neither the doors that I, he answered, nor are they the " deluded persons e that in "Ghost" has represented. The next port w turn of 'duty" performed by David's Ghost" If the giving vent to its " desire," which is that it would like to see the eight hours adopted, though e not at present Its reasons for wishing to see the B eight hours not adopted at present are because its 1 pi autotype would not have done so, had he got the 2 contract, and because it would be an injustice to gentlemen who have taken contracts at specified sums Well, Mr Editor, these two ghostly ice J sons have wrinkled the cheeks of nearly every body that has read them, and well they may, to hear the of " Ghost" express its "desire" on a question which if it says " affects the interests many," and then to show that its " desire" is influenced by the very conduct it writes to condemn. Another duty performed by the "Ghost" is, it having pointed out to the public the notorious fact that the eight hours is advocated by agitators, who only seek popularity Now this part of Ghost's duty hardly needed to be performed, because the same thing is shouted in various ways nearly every other day The working men, of course, are animated by motives quite exceptional to every other class Dipeciall) Is this the case when they audacity ousl) attempt to communicate their thoughts to their fellows, but let me tell the Ghost, that we ¡ ourselves don't believe it, and on this account or not a straw who does, because exper lence lins tune,! us that whether we want to shorten our hours of toil or in any way seek to add to our material comforts, all entirely depends on our own unaided exertion I will refrain from meddling with the " specified sum, as it might, like every other thing is," alleged to. nrlvannfut Taormina Aloanloo.! nails I the touch of an ache under WEB Aïim it
