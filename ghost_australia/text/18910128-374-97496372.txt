The Municipal Stakes. By Nbmo. I. send :you'thosfcraight trp^fbAtEe'--. great municipal race to come off on February 2, together with what is Icnojra .... of age, pedigree, and perfotmani&B.; r |' Several unknown colts hare been entered for the event, some of whiSt-are. in Actroa "£ training,' but. it. wjll not be; difficultjfor/ , 1£;-t any sportsman to spot the placedhonjes :;:inm' on the subjoined information. The first on the list is , , Butcher Boy," by YorKie, out of Scotch Lassie op Bonnie Jean. He is well in . rT, it, aithbugh^he.; scarries top irnjagjhtj [ §: §" but hasa lot of public Support,' u^fancy' ' * him only for a place,- as the di$tanpe £B. rather too- feiM Lfor- hiito, ! !an<£'£he^ i haanofc been trained fine-enough.^-lio "doubt there is plenty of - '-go - in him, but he? is too fleshyabout -the -rianlr ? jmiT.? e quarters for a^-'rfeally good; race.-He J~ might'{mil through. with credit^ however,";'*5 : ,and justify the confidence of his baicken. s!"! Next is Bendigo, by May«r, out of i7 ' Victoria, a good upstanding colt, -with plenty of bone and muscle and good dash of foot. He is, however, hard to tide, as he has a habit of ^ =; on one Bide, and might -maks a Orange Blossom, by out of the .Daughter looks well, but I do notlike Sie j " " as I have not known thebloodi anything fast-yet. .cohere exception toni" ' *'* " Three Sf5r,it of trainers have given Mm work enough, however—althcuiprh—hn. ntona any am ount. He ought " to show a veryfair pace for a certain 'distance,andifhebe properly, brought to the. post he .might .gjiin a place. 'Any way he canmake^h'e ; | pace hot for the.others, and should cut out the running from the start. By so' doinghemay get a lead while the outers are watching each other, and eventually .land a winner hands down. . ,. - The next is:.the, nice.bnght chestnut entire, Teulba, by Bismartek, dam Mein Frau. He is not to; be dispised, as the * , has any amount pf Staying power, |stnd u / sure to go to win. With fair weather* and some attenfou-^ppmshis trainer, hp stands & 6harice, aiM is sure &Pbe; 0O3e;*: *11 up at the finish. r : Precentor is a neat -compact brown colt, by. Toowoomba, out of Drayton, a f, \ new arrival .-in these parts and ziot much » known except that he is high spirited, and - may chafe when taken to the post and..,, , fidgetty to. "be.-oft Tf he can bC fesj^M under control!' he will, no doubt, make a show for-first place, but I expect he will throw his rider in the mudjijand then all T J{T chance iwill be gone, together with the-- V ^ £5 fine for not knowing better. Sancho Panza is a rakish mouse cooredl /. gelding, by Iodine out of Cemera Obscura. , . .. He is somewhat leggy, and more fit for hurdle work than a sharp flat race.., Over the sticks he xnight have a good show, bpt I do not see he has a ghost of a chance in . the Municipal Stakes. I do not expect , Sancho. Panza ,will. make a show in the > r race; perhaps his stable will scratch him.' i ;■ -r t f ! Out' of the above I name Butcher Boy, -i-..,,:;.; * Bendigo, and Orange Blossom in tho ^ . . order named, for if the former intends to -to go for. first place he-will^get-it or give - '«• - the others as much as they candotojwin. -• There is to be a contest for. the Grub Stakes this year, for which three entries only are made. Dumb Boy^J ought to land the dollars as he has' successfully competed previously, and^khows every inch ot the courste..' His breeding" is un deniable, his sire beingOld England, dam Meditation. The next past the post I predict to be a red roan colt, also a good, performer, owned by, the coming ^Ssijat. His-name is Dan O'Connell, and is Faugh-a-Ballagh out of Eviction. < HeJ also performed well races, and has _ whipper-in will be Sprin^^^W^^pwli'o is altogether.- in -for such' a racej^^^^^wygtnows''any thing ■ nfli" may '' good' per * colonies,. prs;|ie brumbie. I do" not .—_(b has sufficient staying,^. 1mel0.utter he is fentered for, and ^ iot recommend any^fmy read^S/"^ mtifeh on him. Of tbourse t _ and let i will win.
