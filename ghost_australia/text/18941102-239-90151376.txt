THE PASSING SHOW. . By" ORIEL." \-- (not HE 't ATOH S.E Oh, listen to de story ob a sipple litlle nig Who's bin dead dese twenty years or so, But had to come back, chillin,iin a 'maslin frock an' wig : From the land where de good nighahs go ; For.when do ole folks pat me down I 'spec dey thought I'd stop ' In de grave by de ole Kentucky shore, But dey bin done gone forgot to put de tombstone on the top So 1 couldn't ha' got out any more. An' hbonies, once a week I had to leave de littlebed Dat dey made me in de cane-brake deep, Where I heard de muffled howling ob de coyotes oberhead, An' it lulled dis little niggah chilo to sleep. De white folks wouldn't let ma rest, dey woke me in de night, 'An' took me when de moon was on'de rise, An' carried me across de sea an' stood me in . a light Dat made dis little niggah rub her eyes. Now 'se a knowin'little chdok, an' when 1 kem on earth S1 learnt a ting or two, without a boast About de ways ob white folk an' what coloured labour's worth, An' de value bo a punctual little ghost. An' when ole Auntie Mellum. got me dere five times a day, - An' I nebber had an evening off by luck, An' 'ceptin' some ole chocolates I nebber got no pay, I jest made up my mind at last an' struck 0, golly, hallelujah, et de missus wes'nt mad When 1 tole her ( was goia' home to rest Way down in ole Kentucky in that little cot Ihad, For I tought, after all, sleep was best. De missus had to go 'herself and do- de Sblessed work, While dis poo' little biggah.bad a snooze; But soon she'bin and done and caught a Tartar or a Tdrk, For de coyotes kern and whispered me de news. So now I'se goin' to sleep once more, I'se tired oh de sin, You'll nebber see ldii coloured chile srain, 'se goin' off to by-lce-land, and work.at last is done, " Ise left de world ob trouble.and ob pain. I hear de coyotes callin' me, I hear de niggahs shout . In de canes by the ole Kentucky shore, An' you musn't trust dose mediums ce dey say. dat I'se about. For I'se nebber cominl back any more.
