" I groaned in my very hollowest manner, but it didn't frighten him a bit. " And do you mean to tell me," he con- tinued, "that you're been wandering about all this time on such a fool's errand, and that you've never had the common sense to make yourself certain that I really was dead, and that there was a primary reason for your being a ghost at allP" I was silent. "It seems to me," he resumed, "that . you are the' biggest ass of a ghost I ever nwt. That's not remarkable, though, for you certainly are the ghost of the biggest ass I ever met." At this poiut he laughed his hateful laugh, and I groaned again. "Don't groan like that, Sam's Ghost !" he said; "Itannoys me! Look here! I owe you a grudge for past favours, batas I dont feel inclined to quar- rel with a mere ghost, I'll forgive iou and say no more about it. Now, urn off your gas at the meter, like a good ghost, and let me go to sleep." With these remarks he oalmly proceeded to dispose himself for slumber. This is my sad story. I never appear to anyone now, X still keejv my eye on Wigsby, however, and follow him wherever he goes. He is rounder, redder, fatter, healthier, aud more vulgar than ever. Only last weok he iosured his life, and Was passed as first-class risk. His expectation, I see, on referring to the tables of mortality, is still twenty-seven Îears, so that my chance of burying him i somewhat remote. Who would be a ghost f
