Kubin, he kinder bowed, like he wanted to say, ' Much oblecged, but I'd rather you wouldn't interrupt me.' ** He stopped a minute or two to fetch breath. Then he got mad. He runs his tinger* through his hair, he shoved up his sleeves, he opened bis coat-tails a leetle further, he drug np bis stool, he leaned over, and, sir, he just went for that old planner. He slapt her face, he boxed her jaws, he pulled her nose, he pinched her ears, and be scratched her cheek till she fairly yelled. He knock't her down, and he stampt on her shameful. She bellowed like a bull, she bleated like a calf, she shrieked like a rat, and then he wouldn't let her up. He ran a quarter stretch down the low grounds of the bass till he got clean into the bow Is of the earth, and you beard thunder galloping after thunder thro' the hollows and caves of perdition; and then he fox-chased his right hand with bis left till he got away out of the treble into the clouds whar the note* was finer than the pints of cambric needles, and you couldn't hear nothin' but the shadders of W And then he wouldn't let that old manner go.

"By jings! it was a mistery. And then he wouldnt let the old piaaner go. He fetcht up his right wing, he fetcht up his left wing, he fetcht up his centre, be fetcht up his reserves. He fired by file, he fired by platoons, by com panies, by regiments, and by brigades. He opened his cannon, siege guns down thar, Napoluons here, twelve-pounders yonder, big guns, little guns, middle-sue guns, round shot, shells, shrapnels, grape, canister, mortars, mines, and magazines, every livin' battery and bomb a-soin' at the same time.
