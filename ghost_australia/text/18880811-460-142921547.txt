OUR SANDHURST LETTER. (FBOII ODR COHRESPONDENT. y WEDNESDAY EVENING. The share mirkot has been wretchedly dull dur ing the past week, and tin; roporteJ Bales have only avcraeert half-a-dozen different stocks per diem, and one day nearly all the business transacted \va< in investment shares. However, the irold yield for the fast week was a gtjod ono (about 4.900oz >. Four dividends were declared, representing a t"tal disbursement of £3,160. To-day is call day, cr, as it is known in Kx' hanee pari mci. " Ghost Wednesday," and this caused the calls declared during the past week to amount to a large suin, viz., £6,141. In New Chum stocks there has been more life during the last day or two. The Shenandoah continues to slope up above l.SlOft., and the higher they go the more the stone improves. The stock has sold from lSs. 6d. to 14s. 9d., and North Shenandoih from 10s. to 10i. 6d. In the 6hamrock two winzes are coing down on the reef (cast and west) from the 1,660ft. levrl, and the stone improves in appearance as they sink. Payable jrold is confidently expected ere lone- The stock is usually quoted wide, as holders ar« disinclined to accept present low rates. Tha only other New Churn t>tocl<s dealr, in was New Chum Con olidatcd, 82s.0d.. 83-t. 11 timer's stock* continue firm. United Hustler's mil liedau are asked for at 8*. Hustler's Reef sold to 7s. 3d., and Great KxUnded are marketable atabout47s. A com pany (the Fortuna) has been successfully floatel to work the southern end of this line, a survey showing that the reef trended more to the westward than was thought to have been the case. The cause of the improvement in ths prit'e of Hustler's Beef is on acoount of the stapes at 007ft. showing better gold. Johnson stocks show little change in value. The last reported cxchanjrc in North Johnson was a pared of 600 at 83?. 6&, and there have been buyers at the tame price ever 6ince. Rose of Den mark sold at 20a. Od., 21s. on Saturday, and have not since been mentioned. Johnson Gold Mines, Prinoess Davmar, Johnson and Webster, Golden Age, and Golden 1'yke have all been quiet, with little eftoit to do business therein. In Devonshire stocks, Belmont and Saxby hive firmed somewhat, and South H. Mungo have had sood inquiry. In the lattir mine they have an improved prospect over the 850ft. level, where a run of 6purs 12ft. ot 14!L wide is being worked, and severa' ot whidi sho v nice cold. There has also been trade in York and Durham. Ellcnborough, Williams's United, Dixon's Tribute, and South Dtvon at low rates. Ducli.ss Tribute have been firmer, at more gold is seen at 80(ft.. and this company (like the South St Munpo) has reappeared on - the dividend list.
