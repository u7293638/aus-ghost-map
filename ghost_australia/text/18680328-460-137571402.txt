I io w however, that your genuine gfeost wouW moke his appearance exactly in the way that Louis dei Franchi does, nauiely, by comite up obliquely through this floor. This mode is certainly more effective than the Jack-in the-box-fashion, at onetime evenemployed for the ghost in " Hamlet," but which now appears to be confined to the use of demons in pantomimes. It is, nevertheless, incoa I sistent with the theory of ghosts to make ' them come in a rigid right line, iescribins somewhat in their transit the figure of a scalene triangle. Btrt, with the lights turned low, and the orchestra playing :that afflhione movement so inseparably asso ciated with the ghost scenes in this play, tlie effect produced was very striking, . ' There is really no room for great acting in "The Corsican Brothers,"aud notmuch for acting even moderately good, but I do not think the duplex part of the brothers could be played with more characteristic dignity than Mr. Vincent employs to repre sent it. It is one of the parts exactly fitted to him. As I have often said, and as I now repeat, he is most at home in depicting manly men, and these - brothers of Cortica ore of the class which that expression defines. In the. scene, for example, when; Louis tfkes Madame de Lesparre under his care, after she. has been decoyed into visiting. Do Montgiroto's bouse by Chat^u Renaud, there was surpassing dignity in the calm determination with which he placed himself i between -the lady and her false friend. | There was no melodramatic attitudinising, no pointing with tbe finger, no, ha! ha I defiance. It was the true presentment of conscious strength and conscious light, in ! fiuences which always create an erceflent ! impression in real life, arid whibh are fequally ! impressive when graphically represented | the stage. . The duel wasv&ry; well managed, ! and the weapons were propersma.Uswovds, | not foils, as are sometimes mistakenly em ployed.

But there must T;fostlv be another and much earlier stage "Tn everybody* having thoroughly learnt T-Tart and «ot into the swing of the busi himself equally vrith the audi rti At this stage everybody seemed to have arrived on Tuesday night . Everybody looked happy-to be sure the full house had something to do with it-and there was neither hitch nor stiffness. Miss Dunn skipped through her pretty spiriting laughingly; Miss Doer Stewart sang her songs less seriously than is her wont. Miss M'Farlane wore an additional grace, and Miss Chester, as Nereus, excited only regret that she comes in only at the death-of Acis. As to Mr. Harwood, he is irresistible. His burlesque is BO genuine that it made stately and solemn people laugh on Tuesday night. I suppose " Acis and Galatea" will suffice till Easter, when a gor geous spectacular piece is, I hear, to be pro duced. The burlesque'at the Princess's also goes now most smoothly. Mr. Gill eings new localisms nearly every night, and it is quite re freshing to 6ee how warmly the patriotic and loyal allusions are taken up. It would be a rare jest if a Fenian were to find his way into the pit some night, and give audible utterance to his sentiments. Would they tar and feather him? It the tar and feathers were at hand I am pretty sure they would. On Saturday night, "Jack Sheppard'' was played, and Mr. Charles Young sustained the hero. It is very much the custom to de nounce this melodrama as especially de moralising, and indirectly to advise the au thorities to suppress it. I believe a great in-my of these highly moral denunciators never saw "Jack Sheppard," but take up a cnckoo-cry that others have started about its dreadfully immoral tendency. To me it alwayB seems a very absurd drama, with loose dramatic connexions, and with characters highly artificial and un meaning. It contains several strong situa tions, and these, I believe, , coupled with the name, represent the main sources of its popularity. As to its possible moral effect, if it be capable of producing any effect at all, it should persubde boys to be honest and reputable; for vice is uniformly shown to be unprofitable, and, in the end, ruinous. It had an adventitious success in London when first produced, partly because Harrison Ainsworth's novel had been a good deal read, and partly because $frs. Keeley made a hit in the principal character, Just as Mr. Sothern made q hit in Lord Dundreary, not because either the piece or the part was of wonderful Excellence; but because the actor addressed himself closely to the task of elaborating an altogether artificial creation. There are a score of plays that I could name whose im moral influence has never been alluded to, but which, by comparison at least, are far iiiore dangerous than "Jack5heppard." Mr. Young's impersonation of the hero shows us lather what he could do with it In -the year 183^ whenhe preceded Meb. Keeley in it, than what IIOW he is able to reach in it. The truth is, it is as much out of his-present line as Norolwould be,and the wonder is .he ouipl&yitatall;, and comparatively so well.1 The Duke of Edinburgh Theatre is beipg rpfurbished for the Princess's company, and an admirable piece is in rehearsal for the opeuingnight, on Easter Monday.
