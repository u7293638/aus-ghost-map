" Anything that will Btii up these people to think .of things, .other, than those of which they are constantlythinking is good.

A'religio^ like you were telhng me: aho.ut: m: thj® hymn you quoted is a caricature of l-eal r# ligion.' -.,•:..-... ..:.-: • _ • :: Henry would have replied, hut he. heard his daughter coming into the house. : • " Will you use your influence, and get your Church to take up this matter ? '.An^ drew asked, seeing him hesitate. " No, young - man.•;. Our chapel and schoolroom was built :as the house otGod. I will never consent for it . to become a club-room* Both church and chapel had refused lum, then, for he knew that Henry Yelland was as much a waster at the chapel as the rector was at the church. Certainly tlie leaders ot religion wcreagainst him. Andrew enjoyedhis tea thoroughly. Cer • tainly Henry was a poor exponent, of hie religion, it that Teligion was. the one expressed in Charles "Wesley's bymn,:for his table was literally laden with good .food, A great ham/,meat pasties; the remains of a huge chicken pie, and abundance of clotted cream were placed on the table, while cakes and tarts were brought forward in great varieties: '- l ertainly;: whatever, might be the condition of the poor farm labourer, Mr Yelland fired sumptuously every day. After tea. the family went to chapel, Andrew "bemg placed m Henry's pew. He found the place nearly full, and unusual interest was manifested. Andrew found that the churchhad been trying to "get up a revival," and on tijis mght they expected a breakdowhamong the unconverted. Henry preached- a remarkable sermon, and on this occasion.made a great effect. 1 will not try and reproduce it. Jf 1 did J should be accused ot irreverence, foimany of his statements would shock many who have never attended a revival meeting m ioamshire. He rtook for his text,:'; 'fhe wages of sm is death,' and spent,his whole powers in trying to tell the meaning of death, which in iiis conception was a conscious eternal torture. He quoted the Methodist catechisuvwhich said that the wicked would toe punished in hell by having their bodies - tormented by fire, a^d their souls by a sense of the wiath of God. He, moreover, enlarged .on the idea that these torments would iast tor ever and ' ever. = _ •.,.. • .. And yet the man who preached this could crack a joke with the. best at the right time—that is to say, on holiday occasions, market days, sales, and so on, while he could eat roast beet and plum-pudding with a splendid,appetue. At length the sermon came to. an-end, and the prayer-meeting commenced. ;Now came the time when the Loamshire character shone out. A great fear, almost amounting to a panic, had laid hold of many of the people,; who commenced to groan. • There was manifest sincerity, too., and asei'ious look settled • on their faces. And this was I scarcely wonderful. < JFancy, if you can, a place nearly ten miles from a gas lamp, where the people had been taught-for l®ng -generations to believe in ghosts, apparitions, Batamc visitations, and so forth, and then think ot the effect of preaching tearful doctrmcs. Moreover, it was a dark night, and Borne had to go long distances alone. Every hush would be an unearthly visitant; every sound the footstep of the dead. The hymns they sang, too, were calculated ±o arouse every bit of latent superstition m their natures. Andrew listenedin wonder.- ihe people did not sing unmusically, but the words irere terrible:— " We shall see the Judge descending,- -: In that great day, Whilst the mighty, mighty trumpet : ; i Shall go sounding through the vale. : "We shall see the graves all opening In the old churchyard, ,•:-,.;, : Whilst the mighty, mighty trumpet, etc, " We shall liear the devils howling j In that great day, Whilst the mighty, mighty trumpet, etc. Those words were set to a weird, creepy Jtind of anisic, and as at the close of-each verse nearly' the -whole congregation hurs^ forth with'the following retrain:—: : •.-,.. " Turn, poor smneiv and escape; eternal fare, For you'll have: to sluod the iire in that gieat day '— ^Andrew began to feel something of the influence of a revival meeting. And vet there were no pemtents.. Tine truth was the people were accustomed to this kind Of thing, and while it -exerted an influence, many regarded it-as a matter or couiee. As the 1 ; meeting -went on,-tlie--noise hecairie great. . One or two eommeneedto Bhout, 'three-or four prayed at one time, until quiet thought was almost impossible. I will not describte'this; meetag^hirtlie?, or I shall, perchance, be accused of dealing flippantly ,-ith a solemn theme. ''For thie aame reason I will not relate ihe..Cpnv^rsation which followed by some of the prin •cipal members of the Church At the same time, if I am to tell the story of Andrew Fairfax, I must necessarily refer'to this part of his life. Neither would I he accused cf lack ot sympathy with religious rgyivalB >-nay, I have every belief in them, pro jded-they ate genuine. Moreover, ^pw was BOihc excuse for the kind ;o£ meeting B have described. The people are not verysusceptible to finer influences, their very. conditio a of- .-lifo had rendered. , them so] sluggish and lethargic, that only those ,iu4 .flueucas which appealed to -their grosser; natures had. much effect upon them. < Andrew, however, did not-find the meet-] ing lielpful. To ihe yomig fliaii wliouesurroundings had been diff erent, aud whose! Intellect had been trained, the teaching,' and general influence were repugnant. -So} -much-was this-so- that ^v-hen he-was -askedi about his own spiritual condition, he was] led to give expression to- someTvery strong! words He told- these -people that'-theiri conception of God and religion was opposed to what :was best,-and truest, and; that its ^ower would grovf leeB year by: year. .!•• ..^ ri^;• Vi"-:'.". .'•-:• .1 The young man left the chapel with a! 'badsname; and lt^was hmted that auy-oneholding such opinions as hiB was sufficient: to kill any revival. -.;.• i: | •-^Andrew went home with a sad heart. He! felt as though he could do nothing, The'- clergymanliad declmedtohelp him ;thei people at the chapel evidently 'regarded! bun as a .dangerous young man. .Mean-; while the villagers "dragged out a weary, painful existence;. They had nothing that) gave interest to their Jives; nothing.to to-! line or ennoble them. As for their tnture,; only a painful old age and the workhouse stared them m the face. -Ifc is true that both church and. chapel, existed, -but -what' did -they do-? Ihef former adhered-io ancient forms,sand- ean-j ventionalmethods, but it had lost touch: with the people. The: great: vault-like", buildingiwas opened only one day, a week,, and then it was nearly empty. As-for-.the: chapel, there were activity and earnestness, but the work done was one-sided and inefficient- ' The - people:' did not . seem. to. realize that the same laws prevailed in the: spiritual as m the natural realm, and thus ? life was without its true 1oy. They, cared a great deal-about saving people;,from hell: and getting them to heaven, but as to trying to make this world less like hell: audi more like heaven, by bettering the physical: and social conditions of the people, they, did not regard that as a part of. their religion. For.: weeks together there , was nothing to interest or amuse great numbers. of the people, and thus somehow they lost grip of that which; was purely emotional. : : No doubt hoth chapel ana-church did anamount of good, but they both lacked that social element, that regard for this workra-: day world, whereby- they could- have been, a great power for good. ' " Oh," though Andrew, " if some broadminded young'curate and some thoroughgoing-minist t could come to -these places: of worshipi 'and then unitedly ; go to work., what a change could be wrought- here! Eeligion could he made a thousand times more to them than it is: now—but it cannot be, I suppose- "What's to be donei then f" He stopped a minute in tho road, as if a thought had struck him. ^ r ••:>,:.
