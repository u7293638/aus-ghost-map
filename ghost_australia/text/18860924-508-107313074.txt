It made Job nervoug '& 4ind uncomfortable, and he took himself off ft as quickly as possible. The next day St. Cyr worked so steadily , and earnestly that he did not' hear the trap- *? floor open at night, and did not realise hour * iate it was ; till he heard the men come w trooping down the shaft. There were the Officers with their lanterns coming after ^ them. He knew that one of the bfiieers ** Jbad his supper in a dish, and would goto Jlis place to leave it, as was his custom, and * Stand by till it was eaten, so as to take the Si dish back. But what would the officer find n £-n getting there? Nothing but the straw * Bnd empty chains, and of course there J would follow an uproar and a search, and h& would be found clinging to the wall, ® and taken back, and a guard placed over him ? as at first, and all his hope of escape would be for ever gone. To get down in time to ~. prevent this would be impossible. It was a ? plow, careful piece of business to go up or down that shaft without falling. He could not get half way down before the officers * $rould be at his place. He knew this with jaat absolute certainty, and standing there at that dizzy height, he clung to a rope of '* fjtraw, which he had made to steady himself ^ JKith, and groaned- aloud in his despair. It ivas a moment of supreme anguish. Better a thousand times never to have hoped, than . to be mocked like this. *' He did not know, till this despair fell Upon him again, how he Had hoped the past few days. It seemed as if he had almost Sreached Heaven, and was thrust back again. ?He would have fallen but for the xope, In the meantime, what was going on jbelow? - i - j Job Fox was the strangest anan alive. fTis brain, large, dark, and exhaustless, was j&n.; immense workshop, with its forges felways at a smelting heat. But beside? ^ this, it was subject, at odd and nnlooked jEor times, to strange flashes of light, that t Revealed to him, with apparently super- x jhatural clearness and quickness, circum- ^ fetances and situations that it was impossible j ?for him to understand an instant before, j One of those flashes of light came to Job ^ 3?ox as he reached the bottom of the east ^ jshaft, and for half an instant his eyes flew wide open, and every nerve in' him shook— ^he last half of the instant he was gliding j jjttbjselessly in among the straggling crowd j ]of men, past the gallery in which was his ? ©wn especial corner, * Fox's Hole ' by name, j ijxp to St. Cyr's place, and before you could jjsay *Jack Robinson,' had fastened St. * CJyjr's rings with the chains attached round jjbiB own ankles and wrists, --and assumed St. ^ pyr's crouched and sullen attitude. 1 Meanwhile, St. Cyr held on, and listened, i ;He could perceive no unusual, uproar i [below. The moments were eternities, but ] sat last He heard the clang of the trap as it } ^f ell to its place; it jarred even the rock to ] (which he was clinging, and then, faint, and '\ almost nerveless he lifted his fs-vce again, but pot in .despair — not to groan no w, but to \ ?pour out hisgratitude for this deliverance. \ 3Ie had not shed a tear for many a long \ |iay, but they were streaming plentifully \ jjpyer his hollow cheeks now. \ Presently he controlled himself, and - jpfter waiting a few moments to gather - jjaerve ana command, he began cautiously » 'to descend the Bhaft. It was a work of 1 rtime, and when, he was once dotvnlie looked. - around to see how he could steer to avoid : $he men Testlesslv moving about. St. Cyr ventured out, sometimes keeping - Jblose to the wall, and sometimes out in the ' -jjniddleof the gallery, avoiding first one and : then another, taking especial care to keep j&way; from those who carried lights. At last he reached his dwii place, and Jetood for a moment like one who sees a ghost. There was a man in his chains crouched on the straw. This, then, was the treason that his absence had not been dis covered. He stood looking down, trying to jcomprehend how this came about. ' He was bewildered, and began to think he was losing his senses, when he heard the mam groan. ; Instantly lie stopped, and as boobl as lie touched him, eac]i reppgn^ed |1ife bther. *For God's sake take off ike. rings/ whispered.

Dr. Jones came and examined him with keen eye, for %e was accustomed to all orts of prisDner's tricks. But there was o deception about this. Xt was clear blood, little frothy, like that which comes from be lungs, _ ? * Hemorrhage of the lungs: must be topped/ noticing liow fast the blood flowed pom his mouth. Job was ordereci to the Jug, and put on a ted there, but the blood still continued to ow and he grew faint and weak, till at last te swooned. ' Take off his irons* — no danger of getting ar at present,' said the Doctor authori atively. The attendant noticed, when the irons rere moved that liis legs and wrists were wollen and discolored as if they had been -ruised, but made no comments. *What hails t3ie fellow?' asked one of ihe officers, as tite doctor came out of the Tug. ' Hemorrhage.* ' Stopped.' 'No.' * What brought it on ?' * Over-exertiou — he ruptured a blood ressel.' * Keep him down some time.'1 ' Yes, he's got blood enough, but not to ose that way.' * See him again to-nigit ?' ' ' Yes, in au hour or so.' ' The doctor went off, but presently re turned and found Job lying quite white and till, but was bleeding somewhat yet. He ras carefully watched through the day. At light lie was more comfortable, but seemed rery weak and wanted more air. It so lappened- that there was no one else sick n the Jug but a paralytic old man, who vas unable to move, so the doctor ordered ;hat the door should be left open and a juard stationed outside. About midnight a slight noise was heard n the prison yard, which, was examined, mt nothing unusual found, and all settled lown to the old quiet again. But two lours after, the guard, stationed outside the Tug was not to be found. He had been struck on the temple by a slung-shot liid put in Job's bed. He could not have fallen, for the noise would have aroused the wratch in other parts of 'the building. He ivas nicely covered up, and was, for some :imer ^supposed to be Job himself- They iunted for the missing guard, never dream ing that Job had left him in his place. Day light revealed the ,state of the case, aud alia the 'fact that the prisoner St. Cyr was gone. A. vigorous search rproyed that he escaped through the east shaft. A straw rope was Pound hanging there, and the piece of rock bhat had been drilled from the mouth oi bhe. shaft was found securely fastened to bhis rope. They had been afraid to let if irop on account of the noise. It was svidentthat these two criminals had not sscaped without help from outside; but nc brace of the criminals or their aiders 01 abettors could be found about the pre Diises. . Towards morning, a watcher at the nortib end of Commerce-street^ Hartford, saw & covered sleigh drive on to the ice over, th- river down to the travel bridge. Three men got out. One of those mei was Si. Cyr, the other two were strangers to Jiim. One of them, a short, thick fellow whom Dency would have recognised; as he: visitor, carried in his arms a fourth person completely enveloped in ? a cloak anc buffalo robe. He seemed to be dead o] wounded.

Watches the Last Lamp Out. Neither Mother Land nor Amber thought . of going to bed on the night of February eighteenth. They had watched all the night before and all that day for the return of Asa, but in vain. A fierce storm had raged for over twenty hours, and perhaps the 'Lucky' (Asa's boat) had gone down. And there they sat before the fire. They would not tell what they were waiting for— but for something, evidently. Mother Land piled wood on the fire, say ing over and over again to herself : ' He'll be wet— he'll be cold.' That was all she did through the night. Notwithstanding the roaring fire con stantly kept up, the frost on the windows grew thicker and thicker, proving that the air grew colder and colder as the night went on. In fact, it was afterwards said to be the coldest night ever known on the sound. When Amber went up to look at the lamps at 9 o'clock, the sharp air almost took away her breath. She found the windows covered with frost, but the lamps were burning away bravely, though she thought the oil looked a little cooler than when the lamps 'were first lighted. It was something to know that, whatever else failed, the lamps held out. Between 12 and 1 Amber scraped the frost, now nearly half an incli thick, from a small place on a pane of glass and looked out. What was the matter with the lamps up in the tower? Was the frost gathering eo thickly there as to hide the light ? The head of the tower seemed to be enveloped in a misty cloud, and -only a faint, hazy, light, growing dimmer and dimmer every moment, could be seen. Amber hastily wrapped herself up, arid taking the lantern in her hand, started for the tower. Every breath of air outside. the kitchen sent a sharp, stinging sensatip-n through Her throat and lungs, as if it~ was filled with millions of needle-points. She had no thought for this, but hurried up the steep stairs out of sight. . ? It did not sepni as if she had had time to reach the top of the towei* before she was back again. [ 'Why, what is the matter?' exclaimed | Mother Land, appalled at the -girl's face. [ Amber tried to answer, but her lips refused to move. Was she stiff— frozen with cold? or had she met some strange thing on the stairs. Mother Land was a little superstitious— she thought the. girl ' had seen a ghost of the major or Asa up in the old lighthouse, to warn them of Asa's death. She could not ask another question. ; There stood Amber, white and breathless. Presently Mother Land saw her lips move, * and heard a hoarse voice strangely unlike \ Amber's own, saying : j ' * The. light is gone out.' She had not seen a ghost, then ? JSo, but this 'was as bad. j this was a warn ing, too. If Asa had been alive the light ' } would never have goue out. But what was the matter. The lamps had been properly trimmed, filled, and lighted. The trouble was this : There had been a ' less quantity of winter- strained oil sent to Faulkland Island light than usual the pre 1 vious autumn. Now, winter-strained oil is 5 provided, because it will not chill in these ' New England latitudes. The oil which Asa v had been using in the lamps the last two ' weeks would not bear the cold ? as well as ^ that Tie had used earlier in winter, and this r terribly cold night was telling on it fast. ' Amber b^d noticed at 9 o'clock that the oil 1 looked, a lighter color, but di&/nofc suspect * the cause. -When she went up after 12 e o'clock, she found that the oil was rapidly e chilling, and of course could not be drawn * up through the. wicks to burn. The two lamps on the north side had ceased to burn, I the oil was quite white and hard; the. other l. four burned dimly, sited were evidently s gbing but. ''?'? '\\_ -?':???*?;' ,. t, What could be done ? The worst part, of .-' the night, bo far as\the.eold and darkness a were concerned,' was'yet.to ieome. Ihe e light must not go out jitterly, yet how could i it be prevented? To take the lamps out of^ '' their places and bring them down to Warm e was impossible — they were too heavy, even, a for Tier to lift. i3he caught sight of the water boiling in e the tea-kettle. In a moment it was in a v pail, and the kettle filled and nung on again ; ;: and seizing the towels hanging fcy the door a Amber took the pail and hurried up ihe d stairs. f The light was gone from one more lamp. l- Qnly three remained. She rung the towels U out of the hot water, and wrapped &em; around the three lamps, dipping the towels^ '- in the water again as fast as they cooled. A 3?or^:3:ew- moments the light brightened «jinewhafc, ^and Amber thought she would ie« be successful in keeping the light alive. U But presently it grew dimmer, and when she returned with more warm water from the kitchen, that which she carried np first , having, already grown cold, he found that the steam from the water iiad thickened i&e;'fepsl; on the 'windows, till' what litfie; light there was could scarcely straggle, ?' through'^ s3L . ib JSHe sworfced on.* laaveljr for an hour, only Is io -fin3.#iat«^i©vwas 'doing no ^ood. At the -end of Has time only two lamps femained & burjpng,io.ue of them, would expire inf & few h ?montfentei and inan hour more the light on -r ffatiilftffipti ^HJaJpfl^nroTild be utterly out. -, , , Amber had no^lSg more to do. Be- aambecf with pain and ^hilled with eold, she wrapped her cloak about her and sat lown on the icy fiogr, She was not going iown again: She would watch the light 3ut,«and then gh§ would die herself up there in the dark alone. The thought was pleasant rather than otherwise. Her father and Asa and Dency were gone — there was Bathing Jeffc for her to Iiy« lor* Oad was roing to be good at laet, it seemed, a^4 ^ ^etdie, top. She leaned her head against the wall and Sxed her eyes on the fiecon^. lamp. The Same grew fainter and fainter, like a dying life; the burr on the wick thickened. Now bhere.was ©nly a tMn, pmoky tonfue pi lame to be seen, that began to wav#r «t|id Sicker, almost expire, and then struggle pn a,' few seconds mdreonly to igilifet agaisfj aiid with a lasfc/gigh, go out uiieriyv There was left a red burr, like a, charred 'cpa^ and a blue .smoke curling up ovec the wusk ; but the burr grew black, the smoke vanished, and the lamp was quite dead. j$he turned her eyes to the list latnp, but she could not tell, certainly, whether she saw it or not. Strange circles of light Boated between her eyes and the lamp ; she saw round rings of blue, changing to* red and then to white and purple, arid then all the colors mixed, and went whirling round and round in fl, mazy dance. Strange thoughts, too, began to revolve in her brain. It seemed as if she was a little girl again, and her mother was teaching her to sew ; then she was clinging to her father's hand, hardly able to clasp her small fingers round his thumb. Then she was with some one else. Yes, it was Asa, and they were chasing each other up and down the light house stairs, and the old major stood looking on laughing, as they scampered about. How kind Asa had always been to her, how careful and tender, always preferring her happiness to his own. She was sorry that sue naa not been more Jand to mm ; tor indeed, she did like him better than any one else in the world, excepting her father. Perhaps even in this last hour there came a new revelation to her con cerning Asa's words and looks of late — perhaps her own heart told her a secret, for a sweet, tender light dawned in the pale face, never seen there before. She was not cold — she was not suffering from anything now ; no thought of the past few months came to trouble her. She could not tell, whether the lamp was burn ing or not, but she thought it was, for it did not seem dark to her then. A vague, pleasant dream possessed her ; she heard the soft musical wash of summer waves on the shore, and ihey were gently lulling her to sleep. Presently her head droopeda little on one side- and she was hot even dreaming now. The last lamp of Faulkland Island light was going out, (to be continued.) '?;; ,..: /?-
