A GREAT AMERICAN NEWSPAPER. THE New York correspondent of the St Louis Post Dispatch writes as follows - Apropos of Mr James Condon Bennett a return to America, and all the talk about his new yacht, it occurs to me how little the public understand the man and his hue relation to the New lost. Rishi There is an impression that Mr Bennett, because he plays polo, gives balls at P m, spends li of his time in Europe, and builds fine yachts, allow s the/e; aid to run itself The facts are that never was a great property so they ought) and minutely) controlled) thespian, inches, even the work of one man (though the work may not mean regular confinement is in office desk for so many hours a day per week) as the Jleuild is b) Mr Bennett When Mr. Bennett 18 in Europe he directs the paper is absolutely is he does here He c ables as freely as he would talk Of ev el) important event which occurs in the United States he is instantly) informed, and when it opens a subject on which the paper must commit itself to a definite policy, he will often chef de, off h met, in relation in, which is forthwith cabled over to the home offices The leader, next di), m per using the Ilu aid * editorial views, has little use that they were cabled from Pius, Egypt, 01 Algiers, as the case may be, for they appear in the usual space allotted to such articles But so close is Mr Bennett's attention to details that he will often use the cable in this manner even when a home or point of minor importance is in question Nothing in the paper is too small or to fling to eve vpe his attention He received a copy of the Hu and every day on which ever) aiUclc, pay 10s mph, or item is pi uni) milked in big blue pencil letters with the name of the water, and very often some little city pas age iph, obscured) hidden away at the bottom of ice limits, will come back with a note of correction and kept mind in Mr Bennett's own handwriting, if there is an error of a "pull disclosed to his seat clung eye A by post apace in cure of the smallest 1 mel, or i mis ahead of body) "set up advertisement will call forth a small u rebuke, which may come all the way from Trouville on St Pctersbiug-wheievei Mr Bennett may be, the chances are ten to one that he will see it is civ body in the office who is of milk u with its lines w a) s knows this, and the consequence is the it ever v one of his representatives is infused with his own vigour, watchfulness, and attention to detail There is not one dull n spent in a year on that great pity that Mr Bennett does not know about once or twice a ) e n he regularly goes over the soil ii) list, inquiring as to the merits of each ear] lo) c with reference to promotion or increase If anything irregular in any branch of the business occurs he is at once notified His capacity for work is in mellons "He can lay) out more work in an hour, said one of his oldest employes once to me, that on or I aside in a week. It is it ill) i MOst to look at his working desk in his beautiful Pins residence, covered with Hu the. shown with cabling lins, else rights, letters, Inks, the In the Herald office, when he is in New York, he will see me " despatch about fifty persons in a couple of hours The moment it is known that Mr. Bennett has returned to New York the office is treated with applicants for all sorts of favours, in the rapidity with which he sees them all and gets rid of the great siege is something astonishing Nobody in the office can tell when Mr. Bennett may not " bob up serenely) There are a number of different enhances to his sanctum Nobody) who knows by what does he has entered, and often when the each in charge, of his business it presentative, is watching to see him pass into the building, his electric bell simply sounds and summons him to Mr Bennett's presence Sometimes when he has been supposed to be far away from the city he has turned up at midnight and worked all night, superintending matters in the composing and press room, overhauling every little an argument in the building, and going home at 6 o'clock in the morning This delightful under sanity as to his move ments keeps everybody on the alert no matter if he has not chosen to come down to the office for days, there is no telling at what ungodly horn he may rise up, like a ghost, before the amazed vision of the city or night editor, of of the foreman of the composing, the Bteieotyping, or press room When old Mr Bennett ched the decline of the Herald was predicted by some of the newspapers The facts are that the avenge circulation, which under his father never exceeded 50,000 copies, except during exciting periods of the war, now averages 125,000 per day, and the advertising has been quadrupled No doubt Mr Bennett's father gave the paper a grand start, but still he left it to his son with a reputation and circulation largely local The great European indeed, world wide prestige of the Herald of to day the paper over es solely to the son There is not a corner of the universe in which the Herald may not be found Mr Bennett's liberality-that decided streak of generosity which he is said to have inherited from his mother his been a for sighted policy for the success of the paper. The Jeannette expedition, which has cost him 5300 000, the Stanley expedition for Livingstone, which came to $350,000, the 8100,000 spent on the relief of Is land and all those other vast expends tines which he decided upon with that quick impulse of mingled liberality and shrewd policy which is a kind of instinct and inspiration with him have been amply repaid in the extended eclat and Renown which they have won for the Heraid Ten millions in cash were offered Mr Bennett for the aid long ago, but I do not believe that Vanderbilt and Gould together have money enough to buy it What the profits of the paper nie may be easily raised from the fact that Mr. Bennett has made the circulation pm for all the expenses and leave a profit David's, and that the net veil Using amounts to over 5,000 900 per annum Last Sunday's in aid was the most profitable ever issued in its history), with its cry theatre of 130,000 and 111 columns of advertising" amounting to about $15,000 A great deal of both has been said about the servant girls making the Herald pa) I counted up the servant girl advertisements in last Sunday's Herald, and found precisely 155, Milich at 15 cents apiece would give just $23 25 cents as the servant girls' contribution to Mr Bennett's treasury out of $15,000 there not a time when both ciiculitioinud chastising were perceptibly benefited by this class of advertisements, but now they are simply a drop in the bucket Occasionally a fling is made at the personal the people who read these att licks should see the Herald a huge book of rejected uli ei tisements (the " Eejeet Book, as it is c died) in which el el all enticement thrown out for possible impropriety ofmotiicoi expression is carefully preserved the total refunds about $10,000 a year to idicitiseisuhosc ' famous line been rejected The interior of the up ton a branch office is perfectly plastered over with such posted notices and orders as these -"Don't take any uheitiseincuts from Mrs- By order of James Gordon Bennett's "Exclude all ages from Dr - By order of James Gordon Bennett The complaints and gross Is of these all of them, who object to line then money returned to them, are one of the greatest annoy meet of the business department The dinnertime principle underlying the cheap daily press (is exemplified, form sluice, in the growth of the Sun) M is fully realised by Mr Bennetts keen observation the moment he took the bear For three }eaishehid debated in his own mind the ad visibility of reducing the price of the pigs from four to three cents Immense caution and secretiveness of deliberation on the one is mel, and great a rapidity, seen suddenness of action, When his time is once made up), on the other, are strong points of Mr Bennetts character, and when the change M is suddenly sprung upon the public nearly everybody declared that the Herald would be " ruined The highest or cut action was then 83,000 Within Unit days it had risen to 100,000, and li is seen, on a single day of issue, fallen back to 100,000 since Within the feels the loss of profit M is made up, and touching his pi o ed a most Mise and profitable one. It is a life to son that even if the ii ei aged any issue should become a qu and time sheet the price will not be used again Mr Bennett now sponds 500 600 peal made on news and $700,000 on M late paper There is a personal trait of Mr Bennett Milich deserves mention, for under his a public man been more generally misunderstood He has a kind heart and, being in excellent judge of men, is also a just and generous employer Some of the people in the Hu old office has been there thirty or forty years, very many indeed fifteen md on easy terms to be faithful, honest, and competent is all that is required to ensure one who has entered the Hu this service a position for life She! of all of the old editors like become too feeble for letter duty has been very handsomely pensioned off, uni ill they be to do now is to report on a day pay day at the cashier s disk to it came then liber d weekly s times which Mr Bennett has allowed them.
