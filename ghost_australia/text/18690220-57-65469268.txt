The Kiama Mystery Explained. EXTENSION OF TIME. In consequence of the Contrariety, Obscurity, and Voluminosity of the evidence taken before the Select Committee herein; of the unusual length of the Judge's notes; and of the extreme difficulty in determining whether the loup garron of Parkes, meaning, of course, "the New Crime," ought to be represented by a "Ghost" or a "Ghostes;" I am most reluctantly compelled to postpone my summing up until next week. In a case of such vast magnitude, wherein so many interests are involved, and whose consequences can hardly be over- rated, it is necessary that every point of law should be put before the jury with the greatest perspicuosity; so that, whatever opinion those gentlemen may form on its justice and merits, there shall, at any rate, be no new trial on the ground of mis-direction. From the hetro- geneous mass of stuff before me, through which I have been endeavoring for a week to find my way, I gather that clearly no point can arise out of the "non-recep- tion" of evidence, though it may be gravely questioned whether much that was not evidence has been wrongly admitted. Witnesses seem to have told as much or as little as they liked: to have good or bad memories according as it suited them to recollect or not the par- ticular circumstance enquired about; and in this a most excellent example was set them by Mr Parkes. Under all the difficulties surrounding the case I have thought it best, as I before said, to postpone my summing up until next week. It will, therefore, be made an order of the day for Saturday, the 27th instant, when it will take precedence of all other business. FOUCHE.
