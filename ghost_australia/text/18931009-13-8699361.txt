THE ORIGIN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND. SECOND LECTURE, BY ARCHBISIOP CARR. There was another crowded congregation at St. Francis's s Church last night to hear the second sermon by Archbishop Carr on "The Origin of the Church of England." The ARCHBISHOP said: - I thought I would hive comp'eted in this the second ot my lectures my proofs of vvh it the earlj British Church really was I lind, however, that the nutter is too Hige for ona lecture and I shall have to complete mj proofs m another I have an old standing engagement which demands my piescnce in Mansfield next Sundij, and I c innot there- fore continue the series of lectures on that doj I shall complete mj undertaking in the early future, and j ou will be gin en due notice of the date In my last Ice ture I undertook to prove two points lirst, that the ancient British Church bad not nn Eastern origin, through tha preaching of St. Paul or any of the apostles, or of St. Joseph of Armiathea; and second, that no matter irom what sou ce the Church of Britain derived its Christianity the pre- sent Church of England can claim no descent from* ind no contmuitj with that ancient church Having shown what the ancient Butish Church was not I promise in this evening s lecture to BIIOIV vvh it it really w as.
