Premature Burial. A SinguiiAh Case which occuked in. Pabis. Another case of premature burial worthy of being analysed in the realistic manner of Zola has occurred in France, An elderly woman who lived at an ? Old World place called St. Queen La Rouerie fell ill and, as her friends thought, died. T^p funfivnl took nl.ano. find as the errave digger was preparing to lower the coffin into the earth he heard moans issuing; from inside the lugubrious four boards inclosing the presumed corpse. Then followed a scene which was an exact counterpart of what occurred about twelve months ago -in another rural part of France. The grave digger, half frigntened of the probable ghost which his imagination conjured up and | partly awed by the requirements enacted by the law in circumstances auch as those in which ho found himself placed, left the coffin in the care of the mourners and went off with his somber story to M. le Maira. That rural dignitary, havinGr dulv donned his scarf of office and summoned the village doctor, pro ceeded to the local 'God's acre.' The coffin was opened, and it was discovered that the woman had just died from fright, having awakened from, a trance to find herself hemmed in between the terrible deal ' planks. When horrible scenes like tkis are repeated it is time for the authorities and public at large to take into consideration the invention of the ingenious undertaker ' who has adopted this motto, 'No more premature' burials.' This practical person offers to all cases of doubtful death an apparatus by means of which those who may have the misfortune to be buried alive may not only inhale fresh air on their awaken ing, but also communicate by signal with the world which has left them for dead. â€” Exchange.
