O n T h u rsd ay afternoon, our representative m ade h is way to th e hum ble home ol M r T hom as Jarvis, 45 Crown la n e. Ultimo. H e was discovered nursing a tw o year old baby, a n d hie face declared him te be one of the h a p p est men in 8ydney. He was up and a b o u t end able to answ er t h e ! knock a t th e door. A lthough pale and bearing still th e marks of a c ritica l illness, and a period of pain, it w as very d e a r th a t he was a n invalid on the rapid road to convalescence In reply to the prelim inary questions, he said t " Y o u w ant to know a ll about m y case P W ell, I am glad of a n opportunity te te ll you. The facts m ay be of value to those w boarectricken a s I was.” " How long were you suffering ?” “ W ell, tw elvem onths ago I g o t so had th a t I had to leave off work an d I have done n o th in g since then. A bout five years ago, n e x t Gbristmas, J m e t with an a cc id en t; I was badly scalded w hile taking a b a tb in P i t t street, Sydney. Since the accident I have been in failing health, and a fte r four years Of gradual development of th e m alady, I was forced to give up my billet a t tb e Glebe Island,” *' W h a t were the symptoms ?” “ Sim ply indetcribable. T he pains were som ething terrible. T hey were ju s t about as much as I could bear. T hey were for all tb e w orld like as if a saw w ere cutting my bones in two in every p a rt of me. I had no control over m y bowels o r bladder, and wa» a nuisance te m j self an d everyone imessAntly shivering and shaking, an d could neither e a t nor sleep, On th e 2 3rd March last I saw a well-known doctor a n d he told me th a t m y case was u tte rly hopeless. However, b e gave me an order to th e Director of C haritable Institq- tioos.” '( F id yo u make use of the o rder r j home and w ent to bed, qpd have been pretty well in bed Five w eeks ago I could not walk across the floor; in fact, I could n o t g e t o u t of bed. I fe lt th e n th a t it was a ll over w ith me, and only a question of days when I would give up tb e ghost. My doctor was attending me, and d id all he cou’d, by opium and morphio pills, to e ase the agony 1 was in. u nder him for five or six weeks. He to th e conclusion th a t I was suffering from Locom otor atsxi», or P rogressive locomotor ataxy, a disease of th e spinal cord, characte n sed by peculiar disturbances of gait, and d iffic u lt/in Co ordinating voluntary inovem ents.

(Ju sttb e n tb e p a tien t kicked his legs a b o u t with energy to 6how th a t m edical opinion is n o t infallible.) W ell, ju s t a s a drowning m an w ill grasp a t a 1straw , I grasped a t an idea conveyed by , the advertisem ent describing the cure effected in the case of a n o th er boiler- m aker in England, which I read A uilralian TTortoion by D r. Williams1 , Pink P ills for Pale People. I read ' advertisem ent cf a case w hich seemed to , fit m y own. I detei m ined to give the Pink P ills a trial anyway, a u d sent for box. T h e effect was as marvellous as 1was m agical. I was able to e a t qnd sleep as th o u g h notfeirg was th e m a tte r with me. I t j w»e th e first appetite and re s t I had for m any a J a y . f t was inorefible. I immediately le ft tbe bed and was a ble to j a boqt. I have taken four boxeB of Pink Pills d u rin g the past four weeks, and atp now ta k in g (be fifth box.

You see I am rapidly regain- ' ing m y strength.” “ H e is 100 per cent, b e tte r,” said Airs rv is, who bad come in an d taken tbe baby on her knee.

S. T . McGowen, leader of the Labor P arty in th e N.S.W . Aa:on>bly, was seen by our reporter in connection with th e remarkable case of Thom as Jarvis. Mr X cQowob says h e has known Jarvis from infancy. He also knew th a t he had to give up his w ork a t G lebe Island abattoirs twelve m onths ago, owiiig te a m alady which he developed. He afterw ards heard' th a t Ja m s was bed-ridden, and t h a t there was little chance of bis recovery. H e u n derstood that Ja rv is was refused admission to th e Sydney H ospital, as h is case b a d b e en . pronounced incurable. M r McGowan was, therefore, like everyone else who knew the facts, astounded a t tbe complete recovery of Jarvis. D r.
