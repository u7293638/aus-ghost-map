LOCAL BREVITIES. ———♦——— Mr. Harley Cox, Wagga Wagga's road superintendent, is on a visit to his mother at Wallinga. * * * McDonald's Creek people must be extra good, hence that deluge the other day. * * * Murphy Brothers are making good headway with Mr. Mattick's very commodious new homestead at his station, near Hargraves. * * * A large number' of Mudgeeites are going down to Sydney to see the Bush Contingent embark for the Transvaal. It will be an im- mense. day in Sydney. * * * Mr. Jim Niven's horse teams took record loads to Mr. Mattick's, at Hargraves, over country that ought to beat anything in the Boer strongholds, and over such roads. * * * Notwithstanding our nice parks, there is no recreation ground for sports of any kind other than the Mudgee racecourse. Victoria Park should be the sports ground, and so controlled that a charge at the gates could be legally demanded. Will Mudgee Council take this question in hand at once. * * * A proposal is being made by the Borough of Cudgegong to be re- lieved of one or two of the main roads, such as the portion to Green Swamp. Mr. Richards has the matter in hand. * * * Mr. Richard Rouse, of Gunta- wang, has been unanimously re-elec- ted Mayor of Gulgong. Mr. Rouse was the first mayor of the munici- pality, and if he had had his way Gulgong, could have had free of all capital cost a splendid water scheme. * * * The cheap train on Tuesday morning next will promote a rush to the metropolis to see the " bushies " off to the war. The spectacle of five hundred mounted denizens of the forest will be one not likely to be witnessed again by this generation. * * * Before many months we should have a telephone exchange in full swing in Mudgee. The initiatory meeting on Monday night was most successful, and already there are a sufficient number of sub- scribers. * * * The little difficulty about the water used at the Federal brewery has now been adjusted, and Young's famous beer with its old flavor and color, can now be had at every hotel in Mudgee and district. * * * The adverse decision in the Bed- ford case will cost the Cudgegong municipality somewhere about £100 We cannot for the life of us under- stand how the extra fencing was not certified to and paid for. As it is, both the council and Mr. Bed- ford must be considerable losers, and the gentlemen of wig and gown the gainers. * * * It must bo flattering to Mudgee side breeders to hear of Bathurstites looking our way for a presentation home for their medico-warrior going with the Bushmen's Contin- gent. Mr. Pickworth made a good choice when purchasing Stockings and Polecracker — horseflesh too good for the unmerciful Boer bullet. * * * The little friendly opposition at tho Mudgee mayoral election im- parted a bit of dash to the event, and pleased the audience. Yet the Mayor-elect made it the occasion for coarse abuse, degrading to him- self and those who witnessed his pitiful spluttering. Alderman A, F. Cameron very properly smiled contempt across the table at his raving veteran friend, who ought to know better. The fact is, Alder- man McFarlane is beginning to suffer from swelled head. ——————————— Mr, Will. Holswich, who has been seriously ill for some weeks, is about again. * * * A new tale entitled " Broken Bonds," is commenced in this issue of the " Guardian." * * * We understand that the band will play at Barry's corner on Saturday night. * * * Dr. Beith has been elected one of the vice presidents of the Kiama Rifle Club. * * * On the 20th March auctioneer Hilton will conduct a sale of a number of lots of Crown ground. * * * Mr. A. F. Stocks, dentist, from Sydney, will visit Rylstone on the 20th inst., and Mudgee on the 21st to 24th inst. * * * It looks as though Mudgee is to be telephoned all over. The spirit of business folk will now be tested. * * * The fancy dress cricket match, in aid of the patriotic fund, should draw a big crowd on Wednesday next. * * * There's a rush on the pair horse sulky. Mr. E. H. Deane has five orders in hand for the latest sensation in vehicles. * * * It is to be hoped there will be no " head-gar " on the ladies at Miss Rooney's concert. Hats off, ladies, to be sure. * * * Mrs. Nickoll is to be warmly congratulated on the success of her appeal for comforts for the troops. Send along your contributions at once. * * * Miss Kate Rooney's concert is fixed for Wednesday and Thursday next, when the famous Australian contralto will be heard in some splendid songs. * * * Mrs. Sharman's nice business at Gulgong is for sale. There ought to be a good living, in fact a good thing, in Mrs. Sharman's long established concern. * * * We would like to see a bit better progress made with the contract for gravelling from Holyoak bridge to Lawson's Creek. There is no sense in taking six months to do a little bit of roadwork. * * * The Mayor of Mudgee does not represent a majority of the alder- men. He merely represents a tech- nical point, which we are quite con- vinced was a mere quibble of which the Mayor should not have taken the least notice. * * * Guntawang residents gave Ernest Rouse a lively' farewell on the eve of his marriage. A solid silver bowl was the souvenir, a gift Mr. Rouse will no doubt appreciate best amongst all the wedding presents, coming as it does from so many well-wishes at his birth place. * * * Something will have to be done to remedy the state of the road from tho cemetery to Gossago's. Everyone is complaining now. Is it that the subsidy is insufficient, or that the money is badly spent ? No doubt Mayor Lowo will give the matter his prompt attention. * * * Flirtation hillside residents are complaining about the night bells that render certain vagrant horses and their bell accompaniment a nuisance. All night long this worry has been ghosting the sleep- less sleepers. * * * Young Nelson, son of Mr. Nel- son, of the Coonabarabran Royal Hotel, is off to the war. Mr. Nel- son's mother is an old Mudgeeite, and many years ago lived in Lawson-street, near the pound, where her father, old John Neate, was a builder and contractor. The Neate family removed to Coona- barabran 30 years ago, where they are still to be found. ——————————— The cement footpath in front of Daly's Club House Hotel is cer- tainly a great improvement. * * * There should be another African mail in next week bringing word of our boys at the front. * * * Mr. J. W. Spooner, one time Mayor of Lithgow, and an excel- lent townsman, has been placed on the list of justices of the peace. * * * A great deal of sickness continues to be reported from Gulgong, and the medical men are kept going almost night and day. * * * Mr. R. Rouse, jun., of Biragan- bil, has gone down to the Lithgow show, to act as judge in the horse section. * * * Our well-known dentist, Mr. H. C. Charlton, continues to do first- class. He now visits Rylstone the first and third Friday in each month. * * * Tom Donnelly is organising a Mudgee eleven to journey out to Gulgong in about three weeks and try conclusions with the cricketers of that once " golden hole." * * * The sale at Messrs. Tait and McDiarmid's continues to attract very large custom. There are some especially good bargains in the ready-made clothing line. * * * Mr. Grosse, of Windeyer, is down in Sydney making arrange- ments for the purchase of machi- nery destroyed by the recent dyna- mite explosion at the Henrietta mine. * * * Contractor John Bedford sued the Cudgegong Council for £96, of which £19 was admitted, leaving £77 in dispute. The full court has now increased the verdict by £12. The law costs in the case will amount to at least £100. * * * Paddy's Market sales will be continued on Saturday, and if Stewart and Smith can continue the cash system the sales will go on uninterruptedly. The motto is, " Pay, Pay, Pay," on the fall of the hammer. * * * Directly you enter the office of the Commercial Store, you are startled by the sight of " blood." You can't go through the drapery department unless you go round a " hill," and when you have struggled to the boot department it is but a " bald-win " you gain. * * * Tho election of the Mayor of Cudgegong was about the most peaceful and happy function, we have attended for some time. The proceedings at the Mudgee Council were just the opposite, thanks to the desperate and malignant charac- ter of Alderman McFarlane's speech. * * * It is estimated that nearly £100,000 has been raised by the sale and singing of Rudyard Kip- ling's ' Absent Minded Beggar.' This is probably the most instan- taneously popular poem ever writ- ton. Of course, some people say it lacks true poetical merit, but Kipling wrote it for the people, and it reached the people's hearts. * * * No doubt Mayor Young acted as he honestly thought right on Mon- day, but we are sadly afraid he allowed himself to be bluffed by Alderman Clarke. The point of order was a mere quibble, and as such should have been brushed aside, and the other party left to seek its remedy if they thought the game worth the candle. * * * We do not wish to be critical, but we just give Mudgee store keepers the hint to read the clauses of the Early Closing Act, which refer to the hours of delivery van men. In this connection we would urge the public to send their orders to the store at a reasonable hour, and thus permit of daylight de- livery. ——————————— There is some talk about getting up a concert in aid of the funds of the Mudgee Town Band, and the movement will certainly have our cordial support. * * * Gulgong had a live wedding on Wednesday, when Mr. Peters wed- ied Miss Elliott, a popular young lady, who has rendered good service in social events, concerts,&c.;, at Gulgong. * * * Yee Lee, of Merrendee, has pur- chased the Goolma Chinese store. Yee Lee is one of those go ahead trading Chinese gentlemen, who knows his way about. * * * We have had to bring one or two of our long-winded customers up short with summonses. We don't like to do it, but even the long suffering newspaper man has a limit to his endurances. * * * We were very glad to see the name of our journalistic colleague, Mr. Arthur Croft of the Gulgong Advertiser, appear on the list of new justices of the peace. * * * Mr. H. E. Single was in town this week. He says that rain is badly wanted out Wollar. Bylong was lucky, for about a fortnight ago an inch fell one day and half an inch the next day. * * * Horses with bells on has been disturbing the sweet repose of re- sidents at the south end of the town. The owner will probably find his horses minus the bells some of these fine mornings. * * * We would like to see the police paddock thrown open to wood carters. We cannot for the life of us see the sence in letting it remain as it is. If it was cleared half the area would suffice for the troop horses. * * * Mr. C. J. Danahey, at one time a member of the Assembly, is a cor- poral in the Bushmen's Contingent. Mr. Danahoy has recently been travelling representative of J. and C. Howard, the famous plough- makers, and in this capacity he has visited the Mudgee district. * * * Advance Mudgee. Mr. Fred Leslie, a newcomer, has let a con- tract to Messrs Collyer and Car- michael, to erect his cottage home, in a corner allotment near the school. * * * We would like the Mayor to ob- tain and lay on the table of the Council a report from the Works Department as to the success or otherwise of the steps taken to stop the leaks in the waterworks dam, We hear some funny stories. * * * Last Sunday one of the Burrun- dulla Chinamen administered a most unmerciful beating to a small boy wrongfully accused of melon- shaking, and then proceeded to lead him to the police with the aid of a leg rope. Celestials should be taught that they cannot take the law into their own hands, and in this particular case the boy was quite innocent. * * * Amongst the men selected to go away with the Bushmen's Contin- gent is name, " Georgo Bailey, Mudgee." Nobody appears to know who George Bailey is, unless it is the old George who left Mud- gee about twenty years ago, and who was reported to have been drowned in a ship wreck on the New Zealand coast some few years ago. * * * Bushmen's Contingent committee most unjustly invited all-comers to Sydney, and the rejected ones were ruthlessly turned on to the streets of Sydney, and told to get back to their bush homes on their own account. Is this not a trifle shabby to the true patriot, and there can be no more pronounced patriotism than the young fellow who volun- teers. ——————————— The cheapest place to get your pictures framed is at J. C. Swords, Undertaker, Perry street.* * * * We would like to see country localities organise entertainments in aid of the Patriotic Fund. * * * There seems to be a sort of sus- pension of activity in local dredging circles. What's the matter ? * * * Mr. J. Cameron, who has been in charge of Beale and Co's local branch for some considerable time, left this week for New Zealand, where he intends to settle down. * * * There was a large congregation in St. John's Church on Tuesday afternoon, to witness the marriage of Miss Mabel Cox of Wallinga, and Mr. Ernest Rouse, of Guntawang. * * * It is said that a big storm, which passed over Goolma side the other day, brought the creeks down a banker, and washed hundreds of fish out on the banks. * * * Those who attended the store stock sale at Bathurst last week in- form us there was quite a rush of buyers, as high as £3 17s per head being obtained for stores. * * * Messrs Collyer and Carmichael were the successful tenderers for the erection of a cottage for Mr. F. Leslie at the corner of Denison and Perry Streets, and have made a start with the work. The building is a four-roomed one of neat design, and Mr. H. Hardwick is the archi- tect. * * * Mr. J. C. L. Fitzpatrick, M.L.A., was at Genowlan and Capertee last Friday and Saturday. Mr. Fitz., who is now residing at Parramatta, was banquetted by a large section of the Windsor prominents last week on the eve of his departure. * * * There are a good many cases of sore eyes among children. Parents should remember that the disease is generally very contagious, and easily transmitted by using the same towel and lying down on the same pillow as an affected child. * * * We notice that the whole of the silt from the gutters in Market Street was carted some distance away, whereas it could all be utilised as a top dressing in Robert- son Park. Nothing better could, be used for the purpose. * * * Mudgee sends her full share of volunteers to the Transvaal. The full list of names of the district boys appears in another column. Good luck to them, and may they return safe and sound. * * * The weather has not been so blazingly hot this last few days, and we are beginning to look for autumn rain. If we do not get it in full measure we shall have a very bad winter to face. * * * Old George Adams, a Windsor boy, has now a good saddlery biz. at Orange. In the good old days of over twenty years ago George was working for Mr. M. J. Sheppard, in Market street. Monty in those days had a big hold on Mudgee, and em- ployed fully twenty hands. * * * The costume cricket match in aid of the Patriotic Fund will be played on the North Shore ground on Wednesday next, and there should be a big attendance. " Mudgee's fairest daughters " are sure to muster in strong force to contribute each their mite to the cause in aid of those dependent on our soldier boys. * * * Mr. George McHugh, of the Telegraph Hotel, Coonabarabran, spent a fow days in Mudgee this week. He is now in Sydney, buy- ing a large consignment of wines and spirits, to be ready for the coming amateur races, to be held next month. George goes straight to bond and buys nothing but the very best quality.
