SOLD AGAIN-LANDING OF THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH. (To the Editor of the CHRONICLE) SIR,--Will ever the people of Williams town awake from their slumbers ? Well may the Ghost of Tom Cringle crow over people bred among sea-gulls and graving docks, for verily I believe they are to be gulled to any extent. Now, our represen tative is a leader of the Ministry, and yet with high, low, jack and the game in our fist, we lose the trick. Mr. Editor, can you inform me what portion of the L15,000 voted for the reception of H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh will be allotted to us ? SYDNEY TIM.
