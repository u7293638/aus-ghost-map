And I <begara to (breathe more freely, trusting that .tilie dread of tiie shadow's possible retunii wals really only due to the child's overwrought nerves. T'O.-one anomiiig-m!y food's pama d/ise was abruptly destroyed .

I went into the ddning-room, and made him take a BMMe brasndyHaaid water, aud sent Mm off to Ibed . Then I came back, still feeling rather uneaisy about him1, and1 sat down with any book, when Ijeila--you wall seairceSy credit it-I myself felt the ^ame shock exactly. A perfectly hideous thrill! of cold. Thlat was how it ibegam. I started up, and then, L*eiila<, iby degrees in some instinctive Way, I seemed' to realise wfaat had' caused' it.

As tounding, yet at the eaime .tiime not without a certain satisfaction' -in. lit. It was almost a relief to find others in the same boat with ourselves. I told him at once aEl we ihadi to tell, and how painfully exercised we had been as to the advisability of keeping our secret to ourselves.- I never saiw father so impressed; lie was awfully Mind, too, and so earry for us. -He made me fetch Miss Lanpent, and (we 'held a council of-I don't know what to caM at! Not "'war," assuredly, for none of u& thought of fighstnns the ghost. How could one fight a shadow? We decided to do nothing' toeyomdi endeavourlinjsr to the affair from going further. Dnxung the next few day& father arranged to (have -some work done in the gallery iwhidh would prevent oar slitting? there, witho<ut raising any suspic&onis; on 'mamma's or Sophy'e part.
