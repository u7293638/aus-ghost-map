PASTORAL NEWS,- STOCK MOVEMENTS , ' AND MARKETS, NABBABEI STOCK^REPOBT.-Though unable to present Vmore favorable report of pastoral matters for the past week, feed being, as a rule« absent from too many runs, we are enabled to announce a change in the weather that should bave a most beneficial effect. Last winter this side of the country was not so badly off for feed, the supply of native clover having bean full, and the raino' then did not set in until a fortnight later than they now have done. It would, doubtless, be premature as yet to speak with any certainty as to tho prospects for the future, but so far everything would warrant'the conclusion that the drought had,broken up and better times ,were before us. It is earnestly to be hoped that such may be the case. None engaged in business of any description care to make too much parade of their losses, but it is unquestionable that very many large and small owners of stock have suffered so severely that recovery, in all cases a tedious process, must in some prove hope- less. Could the death- rate ' of stock of all classes be correctly ascertained it would astonish even Mr Buchanan. In proof of this we are reliably informed that in many parts even the Kangaroo tribe are lying dead in numbers, and the survivors are more bags of | bones with only the ghost of a hop left in them. I Passings, as may be supposed, are not plentiful. On I Saturday a mob of between 50 and 60 horses for the Palmer slipped through quietly, giving no partculars. 180 fat beasts, S. Hoskisson's, from Gerah, Boodle m charge, came into Molly this evening; they are to be supplemented by a score more off that station, and proceed to Sydney. To-morrow, Thursday, about 1500 head of stores will leave Molly for Gerah in charge of James Skuthorpe. No other items to hand.-Narrah i Herald, April 13. WAGGA WACGA STOCK REPORT.-April 14,1876. We have not yet had the welcome fall of rain which the accounts received from various parts of the colony have led us to anticipate. After a warm day on Wednesday last, the clouds gathered round on the following morning, and all appearances were in favour of an actual breaking up of the 'drought. Still appearances were again deceptive, only one or two light showers falling. At the present time (mid- night), the sky is threatening, and m accordance with tbe old proverb, we may hope that the rain, so long delayed, will now come. Wa hear of very bad accounts from the back country in the direction ot th» Lachlan. Stock are dying rapidly, and upon some stations it has become necessary to kill the lambs in order to preserve the lives of the ewes. In the Queanbeyan district there has been some more rain, but unfortunately it has come too late for the growth of grass, the frosts having already set in. In the local market, business bas been decidedly bad, the temporary spurt induced by thn rain having been followed by, if possible, increased dulness Fat stock are only wanted to supply local wants. Store cattle are still dull of sale, but the store sheep market exhibits a certain amount of briskness. Messrs. Wilkinson, Hann, Minchin, and Co. report having sold a small draft of fat cows for Mr. J. Rand, of Oura, and a small lot'of fat wethers for Mr. J. J. Fennell, of Wattibery ; two teams of working bul- locks for.Messrs. Needham and Reed; and 2500 2-tooth wethers for Mr. B. Lowe, of Ariah, to Messrs. Huon and Collins, of North Bolero.- Wagga Wagga Empress. , FORBES STOCK REPOHT.-The drought, appears now to have been effectually broken ; on Wednes- day evening it commenced to rain steadily, and con- tinued with but very little intermission for about twenty hours. Even now it looks as though mor* would speedily follow, and although a vast amount of good will accrue from what has fallen, there is a generally expressed desire for more. In fact it seems as though we couldbardly have enough of it ; yet with tank» and dams full, and grass growing as fast as it can for ¡.he time of year, we have certainly got all we can reasonab1 y expect. Intelligence from many correspondents between tbe Lachlan and the Bogan inform us that they got the rain we had ten days ago, and it is to be hoped they got that of Wed- nesday as well. At all events, we hear more cheer- ing news from nil quarters, and if the frosts hold off, there will yet be nn abundance of winter feed. All the travelling sheep have gone back to their own quarters, and the next movement we may expect will be those coming on for market.-Forbes Times.
