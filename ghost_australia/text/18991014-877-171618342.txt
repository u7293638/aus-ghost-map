Humorous Column. Took the Little Man's Part. A sailor whose ship had been paid off at Sydney took the tram for Waterloo. Before he entered the tram he armed himself with a bottle of rum, so that when he arrived at his destination he was very mixed. ' Waterloo I' shouted the conductor. ' All right, never mind about the ' water,' let's have Bome more rum,' replied Jaok. At last they ' emptied ' Jack ont of the carriage. Slouching along towards Botany, he saw two men busily engaged in sawing a block ot wood with a cross cut saw in a wood and coal yard. One man was very tall and the other very short. After looking at them for some time through half-closed eyes Jack entered the yard, and, without any warning, knocked the tall man down. ' What's that for ?' shouted the injured man. 'Look yere,' said Jaok, 'I've seed you a-trying to take that saw away from the little 'un for ever so long. Just you let him have it, will yet ? If yer don't, I'll blind yer with soience. Remember, I'm the bloke wot fought the ghost in the tin hut and came out without a soratch â€” d'ye see, long 'un.'
