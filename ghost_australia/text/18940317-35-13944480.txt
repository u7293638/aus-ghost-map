OLD WORLD GOSSIP. (FROM OUB OOnlmSPONDENT.) LONDON, Fed. 2. Wo havo had a tremendous political scare tins | week An evening newspaper, the Fall Mall I frT*»«-. suddenly sprang on the London publio on Wcdncsdiy au uunouncemont tnat Mr Gladstouo had decided to retiro from public lifo, and that a dissolution, was consequent!) imminent It waa mado in, tho hrgest typo, perhaps, oior tiocd in a novvf paper, its tono vtns confident and autliontu « »o, nud tho effect was olcotrical I happened to ha in tho oity on Wednesday after- noon, and was orosaing by tho Bunk of. Ln_lnnd, through that vast mass of human bom_s which surge all day Ion - from tho great avenues which com ergo at tins spot-tho buoiost in nil London It has to bo an moment of oxtraordinnrv importance which inter- rupts tho movement here, hut two or threo ragged lads put in au appoi-anoo with copies of tho Patt Mall Ga Me and contents bills sotting forth tho supposed fateful fact Fora momont tho trafho was visibly disarranged as people ruBhed from all paris to buy tho papers, nnd tho verv cabs and omnihuseB went moro slowly as the drivers tried to get an inkling of what tho acaro was all about Tho first supplies of the papers nero sold off in tho twinkling of an eye At tho West End, as I learnt aftorwardB, tho oxoitomrnt n as intenso and tho political olnbs wore filled all tho evening with menibors anxious to got somo idea of what was occurring from tho " »ape " machines Scores of telegrams were despatched to Mr Gladstone at Biarritz by his colleagues and sympathisers, and (jreat exoitoment prevailod when it bocamo known that he had despatched a reply in cipher to ono of his private secretaries It cannot bo said that Jil Gladstone's anew or has completely relieved tho uncertainty in v. hioh wo aro placed A denial of the story that ho has deoided to resign is acoompnnied by un admission that for many months tho infirmities of ago havo rendered it in hw judgmont dosirablo that ho should bo released from publio oates Even with regard to the immediate futuro ho is careful to roservo his freedom of action Long before this letter roaohea you the uncer- tainty will probably have been oloared up, and we shall know whether Mr Gladstone is really pre- pared to encounter the stress and strain of another «eïaion But it is worth putting on record the ex- traordinary consternation caused by a moro rumour of his retirement to illustrate how completely tho «nmodiate destinies of the oonntry are felt to contre in tho notion of a single roan In Irish quarters, I am told, the moie snggostion that Mr Gladstono might resign has caused a feeling akin to despair whilo among the Unionists it has boen received with the wildest expression« of delight There is groat speculation as to how the Pall Wall carne by ita news Tho newspaper has had a curious history It was originally started as an independent Liboral organ, but under Sir Greenwood's editorship it gradually took an unratstakablo Conservative or, at all events, anti-domooratio, turn It " shed " Mr Greenwood-who started the Si Jamta'ti, whiah has since fallon into other hands-and Mr John Morloy restored it to the ways of Radicalism To Mr Morloy succeeded the exuberant Mr Stead, who v, as follov, ed in the dynasty hy Mr Cook, who was " Bhod " m turn and started tho TVeU mimtei Gazette under tho proprietorship of Mr Newnes so that the 1'all Mall has boen a fruitful parent ofothor ovening papers Mcanvthilo it went back itself to Toryism, and is now largelj in the hands of aristocratic amateurs Its editor is Mr Pcroy Cust, a olover and amiable young Conservative member of Parlia- ment and the hoir to a peerage, whilo its oluof proprietor is no less a person than Mr Astor, the American millionaire Novt, Mrs Astor is understood to bo on terms of friendship with members of the Gladstono family, and when the Fall Mall referred mysteriously to in authority that it wus not at liberty to divulgo people said to oaoli other, " Chercha la fernie " But that may have been all a libel, and the real origin of the report may have boon a story wliioh was brought back from Biarritz, and went tho round of the clubs a weok or so ago, to the offoct that Mr Gladstono had at a small dinner pnrty expressed his weariness of publio lifo Howovcr this may be, it is noticeable that stress is laid upon domestio pressure as one of the reasons for Mr Gladstone's supposed retirement, and there is no doubt that if tho Prime Minister had consulted the wishes of his own household ho would have rested from his labours long ago Despite his grand constitution and his wonderful mental power Mr Gladstono suffers m Borne respects from the movitable infirm- ities of old age His eyesight has grown so v, eak that if he has to make a quotation in tho oourse of his speech in the Houso of Commons one of his colleagues usuallv reads it for him, and in spite of the strained attention which he gives to other peoplo's speeches, he would often miss tha most salient points but for quicker ears than his own Those are (roubles to which he is himself ken ly sensible, and they naturally increase tho anxiety of those about him that he should be relieved from tho arduous strain of his prosent position But to his political assooiatas his possible rotiroinent up pours nothing short of a groat calnmitv Happening to hear that Mr Balfour was to take the chair, and that a paper was to be reid by Mr Andrew Lang nt the annual mcotmg of tho Psyohioal Research Sooioty, a day ortnoaeo, I possessed mybolf of a tiokot and wont There was not mnoh that wus " ghostly " in tho atmosphère of tho meeting, while thoro was a good deal that was fashionable The fair box largely predominated Probably there wore throe ladies to ono gentleman in tho nudionco, and tho majority of them wore cortnwh not of the hlne stooking caste Hero and there was a thoughtf nl looking, oldorly maiden who took tno proceedings seriously, but trom the general gossip around mo I should gather that most of tho ladj inombers tnko to tho pursuit of p«yohicnl mysteries beoauso thoy find-as I heard ono lady sny -who was oxtolling the eocioty-tho proceedings as a rulo " most entertaining " It is for this (lu tho oyes of their fair colleagues) that Mr Myers and the other lenders of the movemont occupy anxtons days and nighta in investigating " telepathy ' and hunting the elusive spook ' As to tho mon, I noticed that there was a lair sprinkling of olergy, and there were one or two Nonoomformist minis tors including a woll-knovin and eloquent Uni- tarian, who is an out-and out spiritualist Tv, o or threo rathor v. ild-lookmg creatures wero there with long hair and pnllid faoes, who gavo one the idea that they mav have boon "mediums" who had looked m to hear what the society had to suj about thoir porformauces I mean by this only thnt they looked like people who ought to be mediums, for us a matter of fuot thora aro certain profes- sional mediums I know of who havo a particularly sleek and well-fed and worldly appoaranoo, and one of whom would easily turn the scale at 20st Tho rest, however, of the malo portion of the audience had very muoh tho stamp of " gontlo mon of leisure " who look upon piyohical research muoh from the sarao standpoint as their ladv friends Mr Balfour's presidential address was tarnest and serious onough, and in the distinguished, tall, thoughtful-looking mau who addressed himself to tho question of psvolncal mysteries ono saw tho author of tho "Dofenoo of Philosophie Doubt" rather than the brilliant and militant lender of the Houso of Commons He argued for tho possi- bility of oertain half-dovoloped faculties outside tho raugo of the five senses, and laboured to show that the ciistenco of suoli faoulties would bo in accordance with tho law of evolution It is quite evidont that Mr Balfour is a bit of a mystio as well as, like all Scotchmen, a good deal of a metaphysician He laid most stress on tolepntlno experiment Mr Andrew Lang who has become a convert to tho fashionable belief m spooks, had a great deal to say in moro or loss Bincero dofonco of tho Cock Lane Ghost But the nudionoo refused, for some reason, to take him seriously, and I heard one of tho thorough-going spiritualists complaining when the mooting was ovorthatMr Lang was only "laughing in his sleeve " The funeral of tho lato Sir Gerald Portal took place at Lavorstoke on Tuosday, in the presence of many mourners whose names are familiar to the publio And I am oertain that tho mourning was sincore That so brave and brilliant a publie ser- vant-a man so able, and withal so amiable and nnaffeotod-should have died in his thirty-sixth year ¡imartvrtoduty.haJugenuinosadness about it which could not but affeot anybody who knew anything of his career The hoartburnnigs in our diplomatic service aro often severe enough Pro- motion is apt to bo slow, aud when a young fellow of good family, like Sir Gerald Portal, who was notoriously from the first a jienona grata at the Foreign Offioo, olimbs hand over hand to fame and distinction, joalousy und detraction may too often bo looked foi But Sir Gorald was ono of the rare mon who aro not spoiled by suocoss, and his pleasant manner disaimod nil onvy Tho last time I onught a "'limpse

protty freely from an Imponnl point of viow Ho hardly looked his ago, and ho had a lithe, agilo way about him, whioh oonvoyed tho impression that, in spite of his thinness, ho was na " hnrd as nails " But I havo known only too many cases in whioh mon who havo journoj ed into snvngo countries in thoir oountry's sorvico havo had this kind of physioal uppearanoo and roputation Most of Stanley's mon, for mstanoo, enmo bnok looking as if swamp aud forest had endowed thom with pre- ternatural vigour But tho p'ain fact of tho caso is that malarial poison is not a good thing for any constitution, bowovor robust , and Sir Gerald returned to England bringing Ins donth wnrrant with him, just as poor Dr Parko did HowoTer, m his 36 yoars ho has accomplished a groat deal- muoli moro than tho

largor dividends later on This is interesting, because it praotioally settles tho question as to the praotioabihty of oleotno power as tho menus of traction on underground uiiln ays, and maka it almost certain that tho general udopjon of oleotrioity on tho London railw aro, and probably ovon on tho London tram- ways, ia only a matter of timo No ouo who has used tho oleotno railway from tho city to Stock- well oan question for a moment its advantages over steam Iho service is rapid and punctual, and very little liable to disarrangomont, and the oar nagos aro cool and ploasant, even at a time of the year whon tho sulphurous atmosphere of tho old underground lines is suffocating I havo only heard of ono neoident sinco the sorvico began, and that was dne to the carolessuoss of a passen- ger Most of the acoidents on the ordinary under- ground lines ocour through poople leaving or getting into the carnages whilo the train is in motion, but tho construction of the oars on the elootno railway renders it nearly impossible that misohief should bo done in this way Ouo thing Is very notiooablo, by war of contrast with tho old lines, and that is bo w very clean and wholosomo the little

adapted to the ousting lines and tho heavy rolling-stock of tho old companies is a que« tion for experts But I think there can bo no doubt that tho City and South London oxporiment has given the death-blow to steam as far as now railways in Loudon aro concerned This is oarnnal time at Nice, and I hear that, in spito of bad weather, tho fates uro boing thoroughly onjoyed-tho English visitors as usual entering thoroughly into thospintof tho revel« Our countrymen can usually do this under a southern sun, though somehow wo can novormake this kind of amusement appoar anything but an oxotio in London Tho big fauoj. dross balls havo bogun again at Co\ ont Gardon, but I think that any unprejudiced obsonor who looked into the groat theatro lu the small hours of yesterday morning would admit that tho gaiety seemed of a forced nnd rather artificial order It is needless to say that tho ente of London sooiotj aro not to bo found at thoso balls-especially as regards the feminine o'otnont-but tho peoplo who do go pay heavily for their pleasure, and no doubt make a proper effort to enjoy themselves Yottho wholo thing lacked the tme which would charaotori"o a similar sceno in Trinco, and was loss intereatinir from tho point of view of tho onlooker than a students' boll in Pans Tho dressos woro in many cases costly, but the typo was backnoyod Thero havo boen a great many privato fancy balls during tho winter season-oven the hairdressers havo just had one of thoir own-but whether in pmato houno or pnblio hall I doubt whether tho fancy dress entertainment really catches on to public taste Wo ore too self -i onsoious as a peoplo and too littlo able to take thc«o things senously I am not speaking, of course, of tho fancy dress dances for ohildron, whioh havo been growing in popularity among well-to-do-people, and which aro nearly always voted successful, from the great ball at tho Mansion Hoiibo to tho unmlloat privato party But tho children havo just that ni amhn which fhe Southern raoes display in their festivities and whioh grown-up English pooploconspicuously laok Another plnv with a moral has oom« out, this timo at tho Court Theatro It is called " The Transgressor " and it deals mainly with the problem whothor n man w lioso wifo ha« becomo insane ought to bo allowed to marrj again The author, Mr Gnttto, apparently thinks that he ought, and hu endeavours to demonstiate this by tho course of his di ima But a thoäts of this sort, whilo it may bo maintained in an ossa}, does not lond iteolf to elaboration in a play, especially when tho charaoturs aro nebulous and tho aenouo mont is \\\ oak Tho good old fashioned morals of tho trauspoiitmo drama-that a man ought to prottut the weak, and to stand by his countr\ right or wronar and so forth-still appeal to public sentiment, but these moro subtlo ethical quest oils aro looked ou as befitting tho platform lather than the starre which is ono reason for tho unpopularity of Ibson Tho annual dinner of tho Plaj goers' Club was held on Siindus, night at tho Criterion, and proved so nueccssful that tho largo ball was o^oiorowdod, and the guests had somo liflicultj in getting their

Ffb 9 The mombers of tho House of Commons aro now Bteadily returning to town in obedient» to urgent summonses of tho party whips Mr Gladstone has started from Biarritz, and is expected to bo at Charing Cross to morrow evening Ho is in excellent hoalth and, it is said, m good fighting trim, though I hoar from a pri\ato source that his oyesight continuos to give lum trouble and anxioty The resignation scaro of last week has hubstdod, but the guarded termB of Mr Gladstone's denial havo had a permanent eifeot, and for some time to como speculation will have a moro or less freo hand If Mr Glelstono doos go, who will eucooed him as leader of tho Liberal party ? Tho Queen has this week conferred a baronotoy on Mr Burne-Jones the painter, to the very great satisfaction of everybody interested in art Per- haps there is just the slightest surprise that ho has accepted tho title, as there might be, let us say, if Mr Swinburne were raised to tho peerage His work belongs as little to orthodoxy and convention as the poetry of tho author of " Atalanta in Calydon ," and m spite of tho change which has come over tho public estimate of his genius, one is still apt to look upon him as a sort of heretic and revolutionary A baronetcy has, it seems, been offered to Mr Watts, who has declined it, as ho did tho knighthood which it was proposed to confer on him some years ago Somehow, it seems just as natural that tho great Idealist in art-the most daring and original English painter of our day- should prefer to re- main without a handle to his name as that tho courtly official chief of the orthodox school, Sir Frederick Leighton should bear tho title which ho wears as though to the manner born However, the fact that Mr "Watts refused is no reason at all why Mr Burne-Jones should not accept If a baronetcy pleases him, certainly no man has earned it better and tho conventional stamp thus placed upon his success at least marks tho triumph of his life's work over tho prejudices with which it was at first assailed I should not like to say that even now Mr Burne Jones is thoroughly " understanded of" tho shilling public I remember standing before that extraordinary picture of his, ' Tho Depths of tho Sea," which he exhibited at tho exhibition of the Royal Aoademy in 188o-immediately after his tardy recognition by tho Academicians. It is a weird picture, as most people know, of a mermaid bearing the body of a drowned sailor to the ocean caves-a thoroughly Grosvenor Gallery conception -and it was amusing to hear the comments of the knot of people gathered around it One lady critic declared that it was a " very disagreeable " painting another onlooker objected very strongly to tho shape of the mermaid, who, instead of the orthodox scales from tho waist, has a tail some thing like that of a dogfish, fitting on myste- riously just above tho knees, and there was a very general protest that tho depths of tho sea were more suggestive of a coalhole than a cave It was this kind of ridicule which for a long time prevented Mr Burne-Jones's earlier work from obtaining recognition in spite of its admir- able draftsmanship and brilliant colouring, and, to speak frankly, it is tho kind of thing which a painter, like a poet, must look for who cultivates eccentricity and runs counter to popular ideas Mr Burne- Jones's medievalism was im- planted in him largely by his association with Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and he will no doubt con- tinue to be a painter admired of a select few, just as Rossetti is appreciated only by a very narrow circle However, even from tho vulgar point of veiw of money success, Mr Burne- Jones has not much to complain of One or two of his pictures have fetched as much as £3000 or £4000 each, and his work when it changes hands genernlly does so at an increased price The new baronet is a grave, rather sad-looking man of IO, and ho liven and works in um old-toshionod houso in a donsoly

raihvavs, most of which have boon declared this week Tho London and South-Wostorn is the onl> line which bus kept its dividend well up It runs mainly through an agricultural oountry in which there is little opposition to contend with, and it onjoys growing advantages m connection with the Southampton Docks But tho dividends of all the irrcat north-going lines- the North- western, the Midland, the Groat Northern, and the Great Western-all aro disap- pointing However, tho goncral opinion seems to ho that wo have got to tho bottom of the hill now, and that things aro likoly to take a turn for tho better It is not only the railway meteorologists who detect a silver streak in tho olouds Politicians who are supposed to havo a grip of industrial questions aro talking hopefully, the recognised labour loaders take a ohoorful viow of tho general prospects, and there is said to bo a sanguino feeling at tho Board of Trade, whatever tho oxistmg gloom may bo at tho Treasury Meanwhilo, speaking of railways, it is interesting to note with what touching fidelity tho British investor sticks to his " home rads " Tho comparât« ely unfavourable dmdends havo hardly touohed tho value of ordinary stock Iho preference stock of tho great lines cannot bo bought nowadays so as to re- turn ovou a full 3 por cout but it is in steady and increasing demand, in spite of tho warnings of pessimistic financial writers that the high prices paid for this and other " gilt-i dgod " socnntie» cannot bo pe-manent But the British investing publio at tho present timo seems, as a result no doubt of a number of hard lessons, to bo won- derfully froo from speculative fever, and to desire, above all things, to ensure safotv, oven with the smallest returns m the way of interest Tho police and the Inland Rovonuo offioers have botwoon thom been making a raid this week on some of tho "midnight" clubs of thn motropolis, and m one or two cases conviotions have been obtained There is no doubt that those dissipnted eotcrio hare been on tho inórense in number of recant jenrs, though none of them have obtained tho celebrity which certain institutions of n similar, but on tho wholo worse, character had in the rollicking youth of our grandfathers As a rulo they aro fond of naming themselves after a flovt or, a bird, or a musical lustrumcnt, or some- thing equally suggestive of romance and gallantry A " Mandolino " Club has figured in tho polico courts and there is, or used to be, a " Gardenia," aud I think, a " Camellia " Thuso night clubs ate of very various dogroos of " fast- ness " and of social pretension, though in most casos thoy ape an o\omng dress, air, and aro nt least " faahionablo " in tho extravagance of their charges As a rule, they open as the theatres close and grow ompty about
