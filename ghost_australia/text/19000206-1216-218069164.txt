Sir John Forrest j informed the intervieKer that a tele* gram had been published to the effect that if the other colonies reFwfed to allow this mail 4 ett«mers to call at Fremantle be would bring them into a state of submission. He absolutely denied 'that hie had eaid any thing of the sort. " Similar reports to those published* in Western Australia have ai>p"eateii, tie' said, in tlie i Melborirne papers, bnt they were quite I wrong. _ He didriotgo , to eee Mr Witt, " the Victorian Postmaster- General, on that business at all, for the matter had all been cfecidfed apon previously*! the t h conference of Premiere, and' tna commuin commoni' i cation had been made to the Sej&-1 eretary of 8tate with a regard to j Du»»:»ii i it.

He had received no communications-from the companies on jthe; subject recently, i the present contract the companies Ids-. livered'the malls many hours in advance of the BOecified time ; atiU ihe desire or ma »p«»m«i , , j of Ac ^ ^ . to^hjiw time granted could weU be «"»dersfcood.
