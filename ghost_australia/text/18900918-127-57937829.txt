PAYING A DZEB,. Leonard s Halsey had the tootha?he That cbh 1 'as undeniable.

I Leonard Halsey's teeth were his prid, aebe I hated to lose them : but, being a man of prompt action, he made up his mind that having it out was peef6rabhl to the death which would inevitably I evertake him, should he suffer natil morning Knowing there was au dentist in the town he do termined to call upon the kiadly omces of the first I Ahysician. ' Wheredoes the nearest doctor live ??he inquired of the landlord. 'Just across the way, but--' Before he could go further, however, the agonised rictim was half way across the street. There upon~the door plate made of spar, ' so that he who runs may read.' Ilalsey saw the legend in black letters : 'Dr. E. Middleton.' Is Dr. Middlton in ? demanded he of the Irish g:lt who answered his summons. with such fierce ie-s that e fell back fearing that he was an es caped I c. *Is Dr. Middleton in, I asked yon' demanded -,e again, still more impatiently. SYi, sur, yis, sur.' \- 'Then what are you staring at! ' Nswthin, sur_ Walk into the fice, answered S3tungares with her politeot manner, feeling that any other course placed her in the imminent danger of being scalped. ' Obedient to her order, he walked into.the office' without further ceremony. Instead of the doctor, however,was only a young girl reading a book. She oses politely, ate acknowledged his presence and handed him a chair. She waited a second or so, with any expectant look upon her ceÃ½ and then asked in a sweet and very clear roice: 'Can Ido anything for you Yom seem to be suffering. ' Ko, thank you. I just want to see year father if onu please... Thiswas at random, of course, but then Halse. was not in a condition tobe very bacid, or anything tl-e that she thouight was ratihnaL ' My father,'eebeed the girl with wedes inher v. ice. ' Why he has been dead tea Jy ss. ' I mean Dr. Middletoma ' I beg your pardon for assuming that he was your fa her, hut this confounded toothache makes me for get everything. A burst of soft merriment madle him hok angrily at this girl who dared to laugh while he was in such misery. ' It is now my trn.to ask your pardon, but I think you will understand my laughing, and excuse it. Iam Dr. Middleton. 'Now can I doanything for you i' ' It was Halsey's turn to fall back a step or two, or he would have done so, but that he had seated himself at once on enteringthe eBee; but it is no exaggerution to say that his misery was swallowed up in thq momentary shock of amazement. ' But, good heavens-I hate women doctors and I want this tooth out,' he replied, angrily an if he reeated her sea, sal consilred himnelf pemsonally aggrieve. 'I am sorry but I can't ace Lew I can helpit now demurely answered the doctor.. ' Help what ? asked Halsey. iea a woman doctor he knew she was laughing at tin, though never a ghost of a smile was on her face sad she 1book her head gravely as though she deprecated the circumstance. ' Where is the next doctor, o is she a womes too P' asked Halsey, impatiently. 'Nc,' she'is a man, and is a dwellng-.hose about twenty yards off, but is away for she night. If you'd wait till absheet noon to-morrow b'she ug. G;eted, wickedly, in a questioning tone. ' Heavens ! wait till noon I why don't you suggest my waiting till doomsday ' bs replied, savagely. SIs there no other! ` Yes, one other-Dr Alf.rd.' ` Is he a man-or-woman ? ' He' a man, too. But---- ' 'But what ? Tell me quick. Good graciou r woman, did you ever have the toothache ! Hfrry up and relieve me.' ' I'm perfectly willing to be elany service. Dr Alford, who is your only remaining hope, is sick in l.el. Still, yu mighttry there. Ifnot, come bhack and I'll lend you my forcepe, as that you may pall it yourself. ' Halsey shot out of the door muttering to him eelf, ' A woman doctor! Humph ! wanted the job lherself, likely. I bet I'll find somebody to take out this confounded miss of pain. Lend' ms her foer rps indeed ! A woman that willa standand laugh at a man inm mmisery hut be a perfect friend."' - l~ut then, what could be expected of a woman 'wh, 'rould study medicine ? lMuttering to himself, he wandered up and d6wn the muddy streets, but all tono purpose. 1Iastry finally brought him back toDr Middleton's ' l've come to ask yon to lend nie your forceps. L'm going to get some man to pull this thing' .. Dr Middleton hesitated a moment, then said, arvely : 'I offered you my forceps in a spirit of- mischief, we'I knowing you would never undertake the thing _ounse?f But I cannot put them into the hands. of :: ianorant per.-on.

I won't hurt you un :ecessarily.' - - - a Doubtfully cyeing the doctor, Leonard took his pro seat and prepared for the operation which he per suaded himse:f, could not le much worse than the exc Iaiiery he was now suffering. In a moment it was over, but so was Halsey, for shi the sudden revolution had caused him to faint. In a moment he came to himself again taoiad soft hands bathing his head. - ' Am I dead t' he murmured. SOh, no,' gaily answered the doctor. 'People don't ask questions when they are dead.' Halsey sat up straight and looked around in bewilderment. Suddenly it all came to him, and he exclaimed : 'By Jove. You're a plucky one ? The doctor laughed, and seated herself at some little distance while he recovered his equilibrium. ' May I ask you, Mr-Mr-' ' Halsey,' supplemented Leonard,. i. 'Thank you. May I ask you, Mr Halsey, why .you dislije women physicians I Is it on prin ciple % bi 'It is, madam, though it sounada uagracious in me to say so.' '.

Whrling away to th'e e? t day, Halsey was P asddealy struck with a idea that caused hhis toy l cri(mso, and strike, his knees vigorously. 0 'By Jove, he exclaimed alowi, regardless of surrouadinge. - I never ofifred the woman. a cent for what sae did What must she thine of me tx The ides of going iah a doctor's otce, abuslnggber I whole tribe, and then after she had done her level best for me never ever mentioning money to. her. a I ell, what must she thinkof me : a SAnd the thought of Elaine Middheton?o mirth SfiUed, as she, no doubt, enjpyed the sautation, was , almnot ua hard tabser as thetoothachehad been.
