CHAPTER VIII. THE I0OBIKG OF THE SPIBIT OF EEI. Kci tho priest had fled with what speed he might from the gates of death—those gates that guarded the loveliness of Helen and ■opened only upon men doomed to die. The -old man was heavy at heart, for he loved the Wanderer. Among the dark children of Khem he had seen none like this Achasan, none so :goodly, so strong, and so well versed in all arts -of war. He remembered how this man had saved the life of her he loved above all women —of Meriamun, the moon-child, the fairest •Queen who had sat upon the throne of Egypt, the fairest and the most learned, save Taia -only. He bethought him of the Wanderer's -beauty as he stood upon the board while the long .. sliaftB hailed down the halL Then he recalled the vision of Meriamun, which she had told .him long years ago, and the shadow of a golden .helm which watched the changed Hataska. The more he thought, the more he was per plexed and lost in wonder. What did the gods intend? Of one thing he was sure—the leaders of the host of dreams had mocked Meriamun. The man of her vision would never be her love. .He httd gone to meet his doom at the door of the Chapel Perilous. So Rei hasted on, stumbling in his speed, till he come to the palace and passed through its halls towards his chamber. At the entrance -of her own place he met Meriamun tho Queen. There she stood in the doorway like a picture •in its sculptured frame, nor could any sight be ■more beautiful than she was, clad in her royal robes, land crowned with the golden snakes. Her black hair lay soft and deep on her, and Jier eyes looked strangely forth from beneath the ivory of her brow. He bowed low before her and would have .passed on, but ehe stayed him. "Whither goesb thou, Rei!" she asked, "and why is thy face so sad ?" "I go about my business, Queen," be answered, "and I am sad because no tidings -come of Pharaoh, nor of how it has fared with -him and the host of the Apura." ." Perchance thou speakest truth, and yet not all the truth," sbe answered. " Enter, I would liaFe speech with thee." So be entered, and at her command seated himself before her in the very seat where the Wanderer had sat. Now, as he sat thus, of a sudden Meriamun tho Queen slid to her knees before him, and tears stood in her eyes, and her breast was shaken with sobs. And while he wondered, thinking that she wept at last for her son who was dead among the firstborn, she hid her faco in her hands upon his knees, and trembled. " What ails thee, Queen, my fosterling?" he said. Eut she only took his hand, and laid her .own in it, and the old priest's eyes were "dim\with tears. So she sat for a while, and then 'she looked up, but still she did not find -words. And he caressed the beautiful Impe rial head that no man had seen bowed before, "What is it, my daughter?" he said, and she answered at last, " Hear me, old fnend, who art my only friend —for if I speak not my heart will surely burst; or if it break not my brain will burn, and I shall be no more a Queen but a living darkness, -where vapours creep and wandering lights shine faintly on the ruin of my mind. At indent thou that "hour? It was the night after the hateful night that saw me Pharaoh's wife, when I crept to thee and told thee the vision that had oome upon my soul—come to mock me even at Pharaoh s side." "I mind it well," said Rei; "it was a strange vision, nor might my wisdom interpret "And mindest thou what I told thee of the man of my vision—theglorioueman whom I must love, he who was clad in golden armour and wore a golden helm wherein a spear-point of bronze stood fast ?" " Yes, I mind it," said Rci. "And how is that man named?" she asked, -whispering, and staring on him with wide eyes. "Is he not named Eperitus, the Wan derer? And hath he not come hither, the spear-point in his helm? And is not tho hand of Fate upon me, Mcriamun ? Hearken, Rei, hearken ! I love him as it was fated I should love. When first I looked 011 him as lie came up the Hall of Audience in his glory, I knew liim. I knew him for that man who shares the curse laid aforetime 011 him, and on the woman, and on me, when in an unknown place twain became three, and were doomed to strive from life to life and work each other's j woe upon the earth. I knew him, Ret, | though he knew mo not; and 1 say that my | •soul shook at the echo of his step, and my ] heart blossomed as the black earth blossoms | when after flood Sihor seeks his banks again. ; A glory came upon me, Rei, and I looked back ; through all the mists of time and knew him for my love; and I looked forward into the depths of tune to be, and know him for my love. Ihen I looked on the present hour and nought could I see but darkness, and nought could I hear but the groans of dying men and aslirill sound as of a woman singing." " An ill tale, Queen," said Rei. "Ay, an ill tale, Rei, and but half untold, j Hearken again, I wall tell theo all. Madness hatb eutered into me from the Hathor of Atar bechis, the Queen of Desire. I am mad with love, even I who never loved. Oh, Rei! Rei! I would win this man. Nay, look not so 1 sternly on me, it is Fate that drives me on. Lost night I spoke to him, and discovered to him tho name ho hides from us, his own name, Odysseus, Laertes' son, Odysseus of Ithaca— ay, thou startest; but so it is. I learned it by my magic, and wrung the truth even from the guile of the most crafty of men. But it seemed to me Tthat he turned from me, though this much I won from him, that lie hod journeyed from far to seek me, the bride that the gods have promised him." I The priest leapt up from his seat, " Lady !" j he cried, " Lady! whom I serve and whom I have loved from a child, thy brain is sick, aud not thy heart. Thou oanBt not love him. Dost thou not remember that thou art Queen of Kbein and Pharaoh's wife. Wilt thou throw thy honour in the mire tb be trampled by a wandering stranger?" " Ay," she answered. ."I am Queen of Kliem and Pharaoh's wife, but never Pharaoh's love. Honour! Why dost thou prate to me of honour ? Like Nile in flood, my love, hsfth; burst the bulwark of my honour, and I mark not where custom set it. For all around the waters eeeth and foam, and oh them, like a broken lily, flbats the wreck of my lost honocr. Talk not to me of honour, Bei; teach me . rather how I may win my hero tomy arms." . "Thou art mad indeed," he groaned; " nevertheless—I had forgotten—this must needs end in words and tears. Meriamun, I bring thee tidings. He whom thou desirest is lost to thee for ever—to tbeo and all the world." She heard, then sprang from the couch and stood over him like a lion over a slain deer, her .fierce and lovely face alive with rage and fear. "Ir he dead?" she hissed in his ear. "Dead! and I knew it not? Then thou hast murdered him, and thus I avenge his murder." With the word she snatched a dagger from her girdle—that same dagger with which she once had struck at Meneptah, her brother, whea he would have kissed her—and high it flashed above Bei the priest. "Nay," she went on, letting the knife fall; after another fashion Bhalt thou die—more slowly,Bei;yes,moreslowly. Thouknowestthe " the torment of the palm-tree? By that thou shalb die!" See paused, and stood above him with quivering lunhe, heaving breast, and eyes that flashed like stars. " Stay! stay!" he cried. " It is not I who have slain this Wanderer, if he indeed is dead, but his own folly. For he has gone up to look upon the Strange Hathor—and those who look upon the Hathor do battle with the Unseen Swords, and those who do battle with the Unseen Swords must lie in the baths of bronze and seek the underworld." The face of Meriamun grew white at the word, as the alabaster of the walls, and she cried aloud with a great cry. Then she sank upon the couch, pressing her hand to her brow and moaning, "How may I save him? How may I save him from that accursedwitoh? Alas! It is too late—but at least I will know his end, ay, and hear of the beauty of her who slays him. Bei," she whispered, not in the 6peech of Khem, hut in the dead tongue of a dead people, "he not wrath with mo. Oh, have pity on mv weakness. Thou knowest the putting forth of the spirit—is it not so?" "I.am instructed," he answered in the same epeech; "'twas I who taught thee this art, I and that ancient evil which is thine.'1' "True—it was thou, Rei. Thou hast ever loved me, so thou swearest, and many a deed of dread have we dared together. Lend me thy spirit, Rei, that I may send it forth to the Temple of tho false Hathor, and learn what passes in the Temple, and of tho death of him whom I must love." "An ill deed, Meriamun, and a fearful," he answered, "for there shall my spirit meet them who watch the gates, and who knows what may chance when thebodiless one that yet hath earthly life meets the bodiless ones that live no moro on earth?" " Yet wilt thou dare it, Rei, for love of me, as being instructed thou aloue canst do ?" she pleaded. Never have I refused thee aught, Meria mun, nor will I say thee nay. This only I ask of thee—that if my spirit comes back no more, thou wilt bury me in that tomb which I'have made ready by Thebes, and, if it may be, by thy strength of magic wring me from the power of the strange wardens. _ I am prepared —thou knowest the spell—say it." He sank back in tbe carven couch,' and looked upwards. Then Meriamun drew near to him, gazed into his eyes and whispered in his ear in that dead tongue she knew. And as she whispered the face of Rei grew like the face of one dead. She drew back and spoke aloud, "Art thou loosed, spirit of Rei?" Then the lips of Rei answered her saying, " I am loosed, Meriamun. Whither shall I go?" .. "To the court of the Temple of Hathor that is before the shrine." "It is done, Meriamun." '' What seest thou ?" "I see a man clad iu golden avmour. He stands with buokler raised before the doorway of the shrine, and before him are the ghosts of heroes dead, though he may not see them with the eyes of the flesh. From within the shrine there comes a sound of singing, and ho listens to the singing." " What doeR he hoar !" Then the loosed spirit of Rei the priest told Meriamun the Queen all the words of the song that Helen sang. And when she heard and knew that it was Argivo Helen who sat in the halls of Hathor the heart of the Queen grew faint within her, and her knees trembled. Yet more did she tremble when she learned those words that rang like the words she herself had heard in her vision long ago—telling of bliss tlmt had been, of the hate of the gods, and of the unending quest. Now the song ended, aud the Wanderer went up against the ghosts, and the spirit of Rei, shaking with the lqis of Rei, told all that befell, while Meriamun hearkened with open ears—ay, and cried aloud with joy when the Wanderer forced his path through the invisible swords. Tben once more the sweet voice sang and tbe loosed spirit of Rei told the words she sang, and to Meriamun they seemed fateful. Then he told her all the talk that passed between the Wanderer and the ghosts. Now the ghosts being gone she bade the spirit of Rei follow the Wanderer up the sanctuary, and from the loosed spirit heard how he rent the web, and of alt the words of Helen 'and of the craft of hiui who feigned to be Paris. Then the web was torn, and the eyes of the spirit of Eei looked on the beauty of her who was behind it. " Tell me of the face of the false Hathor?" said the Queen. And the spirit of Rei answered, "Her face is that beauty which gathered like a mask upon the face of dead Hataska, and upon the face of the Bai, and the face of the Ka, when thou spakest with the spirit of her thou hadst slain. Now Meriamun groaned aloud, for she knew that the doom was on her. Last of all, she heard the telling of the loves of Odysseus and of Helen, her undying foe, of their kiss, of their betrothal, ana of that marriage Which should be on the morrow night. Meriamun the Queen said never'a word ; but when all was done and the Wanderer had left the shrine again she whispered in thooarof Rei the priest, and drew back his spirit to him so that lie awoke as a man awakes from sleep. He awoke and saw the Queen sitting over against him with a face white as the face of the dead, and about her deep eyes were lines of black.. " Hast thou heard, Meriamun?" he asked. "I have heard," she answered. " What dreadful thing hast thou heird ?" he asked again, for he knew nought of that which his spirit had seen. "I have heard things that may not be told," she'said; "but this I will tell thee. He of whom we spoke hath passed the ghosts, he hath met with the falso Hathor—that accursed woman, and he returns here all unharmed. Now go, Rei!"'
