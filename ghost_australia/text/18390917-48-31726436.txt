A Protestant Dr. Dens! The celebrated Chillingworth being a great favourite with Dr. Broughton (see appendix to his speech on educa tion), it may not be amiss to present our Protestant readers with his opinion on the great question, which seems to be driving the conductors of the Pro- testant press in this Colony out of their senses. We have other Prot testant Doctors in store, whose "theology" will be found equally em- barrassiug to the knight- errants of ultra-Protestantism. "'Can any man be so unreasonable as to imagine that when our Saviour, in so solemn a manner, having first breathed upon his discl- ples, thereby conveying, and insinuating the Holy Ghost into their hearts, renewed unto them or rather confirmed that glorious com- mission, &c.; whereby he delegated to them an authority of binding and loosing sins upon earth, &c.; Can any one think, I say, so un- worthily of our Saviour, as to esteem these words of his no better than compliments? Therefore, in obedience to his gracious will, and as I am warranted and enjoined by my Holy Mother the Church of England, I beseech you, that by your practice and use you will not suffer that commission which Christ hath given to his ministers, to be a vain form of words without any sense under them. When you find yourselves charged and oppressed, &c.; have recourse to your Spiritual Physi- cian, and freely DISCLOSE THE NATURE AND MALIGNITY OF YOUR DISEASE. And come not to him, only with such mind as you would go to a learned man, as one that can speak comfortable things to you ; but as to one that hath authority delegated to him from God himself, to absolve and acquit you of your sins. If you shall do this, assure your souls that the understanding of man is not able to conceal that excess of joy and comfort which shall accrue to that man's heart, who is persuaded he hath been made partaker of this blessing.* liar !I â€¢ " nit
