SHYING HORSES. " Why it is that shying in horses shonld he set down to an ugly disposition I don't know," said a prominent veterinary surgeon lately. " It must be because horsemen don't know what else to lay it to. The faot is that it seldom is met with unless the horse is near-sighted. I have tested scores of shying horses for near-sightedness, and in nearly all oases found what I expeoted. And, now, when I am asked to give points on buying horses, I give this as one of the requisites: Never buy a horse whioh is nearsighted. There are, however, two exceptions to the rule. If the horse is to have a mate, then it doesn't make any difference about the sight. One horse oan go blind if the other is clear- sighted. If the horBe is to be used for riding to saddle, be carefal that he is not near-sighted, for he will throw you sooner or later. "The reason why a near-sighted horse shies is very simple," the surgeon continued. " Of all animals the horse is the most gentle, and even timid. He sees a strange objeot, and his susceptible mind magnifies it into a monster that is going to destroy him. A piece of white paper at the roadside in the night is a ghost, and an 'old wagon in the ditch in a dragon. Every horseman knows that if you drive the animal close to the dreadful objeot the horse oools down at once. It is supposed that it is because the horse makes a closer acquaintance with the objeot. That is true, but not in the sense in whioh it is generally understood. The animal has not been able to see it from a distance. He is near-sighted.â€”New York Sun.
