SELECTED POETEY DESERTED. (By: W. H. Ogilvie.) This is the homestead—the still lagoon. Kisses the foot of the. garden fence, Shimmering under a silver moon In a midnight silence, cold and tense; .Vines run wild on the old-verandah, Holding their arms to us standing by. Garden paths where we used to wander, Carry the bush grass" rank iaad high. Here and there as a- bldssoxtt stayed Out of the wreck of the passing years; But these will wither, for ■ flowers must fade Whose only water is salt sea tears. There are ghosts in the garden wilder nesses, And gliding wraiths at the water side, Murmur of voices and rustle of dresses Shadow life that has never died. The stockyard is empty and dim and drear; Here and there is a gap. in the rails, But I can see as we stand a-near Moving steeds where the daylight fails— I see as I stand at the sliprails dreaming Many riders that mount and meet, Bun on the saddles gleaming, gleaming, Red dust wrapping the horses' feet. The world is silent under the stars, And yet there comes to my ear alone The tiny clink of the snaffle bars As the. eager heads are upward thrown. And the sound of the muffled hoof-beat after Strikes like a hammer on heart and brain; And' the faint, far. echo of drifting laughter Wakens the strength of a sleeping pain. Come, come away from the lonely home, Softly, softly as mourners tread; The world is wide—there is space to roam Without awaking the sleeping de' Til! the last of the scattered flowers ^uall wither, The last of the stockyard rails decay, Till the old walls, crumble and fall. to gether, j The ghost will move in the moonlight _ grey.
