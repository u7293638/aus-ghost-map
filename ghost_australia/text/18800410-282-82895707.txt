THB OLD 8EBM0N. Thi flolemu huih of midnight is brooding over tho earth ; Alone in my state and tplendoor, I wait for the new daj'a birth. No sound breaks in ou the stillnont, no voice in tho silonee sails, So heavy the; velvet hangings, so thlok are my study wolla. I would ait in tbo dotty silence, and rest both heart and brain, And gather strength for the warfare that day brings on Again ; Bnt a picture comes in tbe darkness of a pluce I knew when a boy, And it chills tha heart that is throbbing with the flush ol worldly joy..; ? ' 'Tie a simple ohurch in a meadow-land, Where I see a whito- haired pastor stand,'; . Who warns his flook with-uplifted hand: " Except ye.be liko the children, : To cannot enter in." ;.'??? There's a glitter and glory around mc that is, born of a guinea's shine; I measure a thouiand sores, and know that their wealth is mine; I hear in tho about ol tbo gaping crowd Ihe homage they bear my name- It Is written in radiant letters on the glilter -1 iugrollof fame; The sonnd of the words I utter.is echoed ? ? from land to land,' And the helm that sways o nation is trusted within my hand; ' ' ' Bnt my heart grows" faint like a woman's when the dnek of twilight noars, And I dread the solemn midnight when that -whito-haired man appears; For soul and Spirit become perplexed; I dread the words that are coming next, , Tha awful sonnd of that simple text: r"Exoeptye be liko tho children, Ye cannot entor in."' Long and' Dares was tho struggle that placed mb upon the height; I wrought with a will for tholuslro that has 'made my name so bright;,' ...

Fori see the old mm standing there, The lifted hands and whitened hair, And I hoar tha trembling voico deolare: ? "Except ye be like the children, , ,' To cannot enter in." .'.
