ORIGINAL POETRY. JULY, 1883. MOURNFULLY stands the changing year— "Old" we call him now, For almost white is his clustering hair, And furrowed is his brow. The frost has touched his heartstrings, And the snow lies thick at his feet, While through the dark wood no bird sings, Nor flowers his tired eyes greet. But winter chuckles and dances As he impishly chases the flowers, To kill them with one of his glances, When he whirls Jack Frost through our bowers. He decks this month of July With cold and glittering gems, That, gleaming and bright on her breast do lie, On her head like diadems. He follows closely her footfalls, And mocks at the sun's bright ray As he beckons forth from his vap'rous halls For a white cloud to hide it away. Like a ghost it steals from the river, And higher and higher now, It passes the green leaves that shiver As it folds round the mountain's brow. And old Sol, grown dim and disgusted, Lets winter have his way; Red blinks through the fog's white curtain, But vows he will soon repay Sharp winter for his cold and freezing, For his frost and wind and rain, For the chills that set men sneezing, And wishing 'twere summer again. He laughs as he counts the days of July, And sees how quickly they're flying; Though winter may storm it soon must die— Aye, even now it is dying. Dying? 'Tis dead! and o'er it's head Winter heaps his frost and snow, While the sad year mourns his white flower fled, Thus month after month do go. E.H.B. Nangus, 1883.
