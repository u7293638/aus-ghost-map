SOME GHOSTS OF THE PAST. The present is not the only ghost sensation experienced in Lithgow. Some years ago a house in town was said to have been haunted, but the scare died out quietly after a time. Oakey Park, too, once rejoiced in the possession of its own ghost. The story runs, however, that this was a case of personation, and the party who played the trick got a fearful ducking one night in the creek. No respectable ghost likes to be thrown into a mountain stream in winter, and Oakey Park lost its little romance after the ducking. Another yarn has it that a sheeted figure once got into the habit of sitting nightly on a tombstone in the Bowenfels cemetery. Then, one night, a boy from the Academy brought his gun into action and with deadly aim, knocked chips off the stone whereon Mr. White- sheet sat. This was too close to be pleasant, and the ghost took the hint by returning no more. On the whole we incline to the belief that this centre is not in favor with ghosts. The weather is too erratic, for one thing, and there is also too much coal-dust and fume from the different furnaces. The orthodox ghost likes a clean, quiet place, where there is no midnight policeman to trouble, and the majority of the people go early to rest.
