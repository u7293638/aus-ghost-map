VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB BRACELET MEETING. (Melbourne Leader, Jvlu 7.) THE meeting of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club on Saturday was one of the most enjoyable over celebrated on the Caulfield heath, and in every respect must be pronounced an unqualified success, the five races on the pro gramme being productive of interesting contests, in which unusually large fields took part in this respect, indeed, Saturday 's meeting is distinguished as having brought together the largest number of horses (in the race for the Ladies' Trophy) that has ever started in Australia, no less than forty two facing the veteran starter, Mr G Watson It is worthy of special remark that this is within three of the largest held ever known in the world, when forty-five horses started for the Stewards Cup at Goodwood might Four young club hkctheVATC to have achieved such a triumph is proof of the energetic sun it displayed by the management, and Mr Bond has reason to feel proud indeed of basing strange lated the Ladies' Race, which, within the short space of one year, has produced a field of such phenomena dimensions that it is all in years to come be quoted among the curiosities in this and the old country. The sight at the start was one which will long be remembered by those who witnessed it Not withstanding the presence of forty two horses, Mr Watson quickly had them going, and although the still it was eel Uimlj a stir aggler, it is probable that no ad vantage would h w e been gained by delay Like a troop of cavalry, the two score and two swept round the eastern turn, and along the side by the soil wall it was impossible to distinguish any but those du cotty in the van, until mining the home turn, where he prefer red ss as seen to hold the lead, and the Car held colt having been well supported by the public, his victory was loudly proclaimed. The anticipation was quite sustained until near the distance mat, where Ltddmgton disputed the lead, but The Ghost shot suddenly clear of his held and Batty, riding him home in most determined fashion, won with heaps in hand by two lengths from Liddington and Transferred who were second and third respectively. The time lunn 21sec is remarkably slow, and t seen of horses in the ince could, doubtless, under ( the circumstances in it it easily, but it must be remembered that with forty two horses on a six furlongs course with turns it is a case of close quarter s, and not likely to produce an time smashing record - 1 nature s literary form bracelet value 100 guineas a handicap for two s LUI olds and up wards all hopes to be nominated by ladies, the Hutmill tor of the winning horse to receive the diamond In ocelot the nomination of the second and third horse to receive trophies of the value of D and 10 Engineers inspected the bay tulle is Mr wuHtciMiim c li ot to li The Ghost by 1 liking- Vila o seam 1st till finally) I Mu GiptMHilig Paddington Issue 8st 'lb Power) 2 Mrs C s s looks s b c liiinsCoiieil, give us starting (Oblivion) 1 Mrs Willie t s s i U welcome back Isintu 1st lilly 0 Miss M MqliisbK Squiuon ! sells 1st lib 0 Miss V li Inglis's g m Friday sixties 1st 2 Miss At 1 unison s i li g Within a year b 8s Mt 0 Mrs "W C Unlilook s bail Cassiopeia 5 years, but 7lb 0 Mrs J A Miller's br li Westbitts (years 8st 7lb Miss Edith a b m Coorcemi years 8st (iib 0 Sirs G V Ils mes g g Phantom, 6 j cars 8st 5lb (eairledSat 7lb) 0 Mrs Halles b be Kgotton 3 years 8st 8lb 0 Miss G Mungi owes gin Josoplilnc 5 j ears 8st lib 0 Mrs lj L billilli s be King Charles (Into Sir Charles) years 8st 0 Mrs li Connolly s b li Mumolulto aged, 7st 4lb 0 Mrs J G millions left Uni One aged 7st 4lb 0 Mrs Dow It., was of UiibtAwii) 1 J call a, "st 111 0 Mrs C Fleming's ch g For for n 3 years 7st 10lb 0 Mrs J 15 liobeit80iisb g local aged "7st 4lb (carried 7st till) ) 0 Mis 1 U IIIKIISSI) m Brenda 5 years 7st "7lb 0 Miss P lliiiiiillon b c Glory i years 7st 7lb) Miss Patella m H 1) li Whisper of s uns 7st 7lb 0 Miss M limbs s ch f Virago 1 veins 7nt (lib 0 Mrs Lv uns H ch g John Peel I years 7st girl 0 Mrs G G Hildoeks g !'

All murderers do not belong to this class by any means, whereas some other animals do Our law is very faulty by being too indiscriminate, and especially by making no distinction between men derers, as is done in America While death is not a cruel penalty, life imprisonment always is, even when most mercifully conducted, by reason of its effects upon the mind. Long terms of imprisonment, again, are highly objectionable, because the released prisoners come out strangers to all and everything around, and as unfit as possible to cope with the difficulties of the social life And all its prisonment is open to two exceptions, first, its immense costliness, and, secondly, its uncertainty, Hence there is always the chance either of reprieve or of escape As to any reformatory results to he attained by prison discipline, experience lands but slight on consignment to hope for much With the applications of modern science at our command, might it not be feasible to substitute physical pains for terms of imprisonment in some cases ' They could be regulated to any required seventy, and of a kind to do no permanent hurt, while the brutalising effects of the last would be altogether avoided Such a system would have a great advantage in economy over the prison system, while its unerring certainty would be likely to render it highly efficacious, and it would not break up and spoil the careers of the criminals. A further extraneous advantage might be realised by this changes namely, the opening out of a new held for scientific investigation, the human subject being in many ways preferable to the brute Many useful experiments upon the living frame are by no means too cruel, and in the case of the condemned the operations of various poisons could be tested I fear lest someone should call this vivisection, imagining the horrors of the Inquisition ; but the real fact is that surgeons have more than once made of their own pt oper bodies corpora mia in experiments attended with home pain and hazard. The idea is not quite novel, since-unless I am in error, during the scientific activity in Arabia under the Mussulman rule-the condemned were given over for vivisection, in obedience, of course, with the hardness of the times, which made but small account of suffering Tub report of Mr. S 'Hun eau, mining in spector, for 1882, estimates the number of miners in the mines of Tasmania at 4000 The death late from accident is much higher than in Victoria, but could be lessened by taking or dinary pi cautions The last dividend paid by the Mount Bischoff Tin Mining Company was 10s per share, amounting to GOOD The total output of tindunngMay was JOttons, valued at £28,213, gold, slimes., valued at £12,101;,
