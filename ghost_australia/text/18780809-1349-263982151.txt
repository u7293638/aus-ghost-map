ORIGINAL POETRY. STORM. The wind swoops down on the towering woods, With a sound like tho roll of a thousand floods, Through mountainous places falling; Strange sounds I hear from the creaking limbs, Like the sounds on a shore that darkness dims Of ghosts to each other calling. With a crack and a crash the trees down dash, To the onset of the blast, And the dreadful work of the ponderous fork, Which the clouds, with the thunder, cast. All round the skies the clouds arise, And the moon is deeply hidden— The clouds prepare in the middle air, Like hosts for the Armageddon. A reckless fiend my spirit steels: It not a fear but a rapture feels, It defies—almost blasphemes? It mounts the winds, and thinks them tame, And leaves their backs for the living flame, And bathes in the fiery streams! Namoi River.
