' ',,.-. ^¿;r The schooner Flowerdale, Captain Mugg, arrived from the Aru Islands on Friday last with 22 tons of pearlshell obtained by the fleet of luggers owned by the London Pearling and Trading Company. Mr. A. L. Coventry, manager of the said company, is also back with us again. The Flowerdale was accompanied as far as Melville Island by nine luggers which have been taken off the Aru Islands fishery with the object of giving Port Darwin waters a trial. These luggers have therefore joined the local fleet, and their operations will be directed by Mr. Coventry, who will be in and out with the schooner during the presence of the fishing boats in our vicinity. The length of their stay depends a good deal, we presume, on the kind of luck met with. Reckoning the Pearling and Trading Company's boats, the Port Darwin shelling fleets consists of 16 working boats. At the last London sales of mother-of-pearl shell, the average for North Australian only ran to £60. At that price, after paying diver's charges and general expenses, there's little or no profit in a ton a month per boat -- a quantity which used to be regarded as wonderfully good. A continuance of the downward tendency of the market will knock the bottom clean out of the industry, and even now the divers are about the only ones connected with the industry who seem to feel at ease. The Aru Islands shell brought by the Flowerdale includes some wonder- -fully large pairs, much heavier than, anything that has yet been picked up here. A ,fr variety "-weetitig of tliè Litérarry ?
