Halley, Disciple of Christ, on the "Sub jects, design, and the mode or notion of Christian haptism." This debate, which was conducted publioly on the 24th, 25th, 20th, 27th and 28th April last, in the presence of about 1000 persons nightly in the Temperance Hall, Mel bourne, evoked the greatest interest in religious circles, and the proceedings were under the direction of a joint com mittco of Methodists and Disciples of Christ. The pamphlet containing tmhe the report will be valuable to those who were interested in time debate, and as it can be obtained in a complete form for is 6d, its circulation should be largo.
