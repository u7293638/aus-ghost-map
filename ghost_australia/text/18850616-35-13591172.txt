THE PORT MACQUARIE BAR. -5 TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir, A few days ago a report appeared in your columns recording the loss of the small steamer Josephine at the above locality Being a frequent visitor to Port Macquarie, and having come interests there, may I claim the indulgence of a little space in your valuable (columns in order that I may publicly ventilate a few of the grievances of that 1 beautiful but much neglected spot? Some 12 months since I visited the pi ice after an absence from inf nearly 40 years On arriving off the bar a most painful sight became visible, viz the wrecks of two two steamers (the Ballina and the Richmond), one to the right and the other to the left of the channel, standing out like two dismal, gaunt his elections as a warning to all vessels entering the port, as will as to those passing by. Now we have the record of yet another wrecked steamer to bear the others company, and it is perhaps needless to say that in all probability more will follow if something is not done to lessen the dangers of the entrance to the port, which with no very lavish expenditure, might be converted into a safe and excellent harbour. I from statistics I read that nearly 300 sailing vessels not counting steamers enter and leave the port annually. The district, being unsurpassed in the colony for its timber gives employment to three large steam mills, and consequently to a large number of men in this industry alone. Stretching inland from the port flow three strand rivers, viz the Hastings, the Maria, and the Wilson with their various tributaries, dotted with farms and homesteads some of the lands are rich beyond compare, growing annually large crops of maize and yielding other produce, with plenty of room for a large accession of industrious population Limestone and other minerals abound in the district For salubrity of climate and beauty of scenery it is unequalled on the coast line of the colony, and yet, notwithstanding all this, the place is utterly neglected by every successive Administration, and. comparatively speaking, unknown to the great majority of the people of the colony Here we have the spectacle of one of the old- est settlements of Australia almost ignored. Scores of thousands of pounds have been and are being lavished on the entrance to the Clarence, more notably on Waalhaven the latter, in the onion in of heavy, uselessly but not a shilling is forthcoming for the purpose of reduc- ing the difficulties and dangers of Port Macquarie bar. In grim relief the ghosts of three steamers rest on the out- lines of the port, a shocking spectacle To hosts of passing ships, and, whatley serse blocking and rendering more difficult of navigating the narrow channel made narrower by the intrusion of at least one of these wrecks, that of the Ballina, which the expense of a low charges of dynamite would remove "it with. no very great outlay of money the harbour of Port Macquarie might be immensely unpaid in fact it could easily be made a part of refuse When once entered it is safe from every wind, but the bar blocks the way Why should it not be removed, or even unproved ' What crime has the unfortunate district perpetrated that while its immediate neighbours are cuddled and mined by his dis- bursements it should be so continuously since ed and left out in lbs cold" A few thousand pounds spent judiciously in erecting a not a cry extensive sea- wall along the north spit would turn the now dangerous bar into a deep and safe entrance. In the meantime if a few pounds could be spared for the purchase of a package two of dynamite to be used for the purpose of blowing-up the wreck of the Hall on which lies midway in the entrance of the harbour, and divides the channel, a little immediate improvement of the bar would doubtless ensue, and perhaps the master s of by vessels trading to the port, combined with the inhabitants of the district, might rest contented for the present with such small mercies In conclusion, for the information of the many thousands of your readers, I will explain that Port Mai quarie lies about 175 miles north of Sydney. The colony being so saturated with " Macquarie)," some explanation is necessary, therefore, I villainies state that the locality I refer to is not Last Macquarie nor West Macquarie, neither is it Lake Macquarie nor Macquarie Harbour, it is not Port Macquarie nor Macquarie-place, nor does It empire to Lu Macquarie-street, but in the course of time it will, or events march on become what it should be, viz ; the sanitorium and watering ' la e of Australia I am etc PHILIP COHEN.
