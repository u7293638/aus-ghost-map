THE JULY. REVIEWS. . In the " Contemporary," Herbert Paul writes about the conservatism of President Kruger This writer is of an opigramiuatical, not to say cynical turn. He says incidentally that from a liberal point of view nothing could well be more deplorable than the political system prevailing in the Transvaal, and then goes on to describe it as a narrow, ignorant, and exclusive hierarchy such as governed England before the Reform Act, when the Duke of Wellington said that the human mind could not have devised anything so absolutely perfect as the English Constitution Sir Alfred Milner IB eulogised , but why, asks the writer, did he not accept the President's concessions at Bloom London for what they were worth, and as an instalment ? Then no one could have said the conference failed, he goes on, and negotiations could have been continued at leisure He thinks the High Commissioner proses a little too much about the condition of the Transvaal Yet it is a popular Pandemonium after all, and no human being is bound to go there, or to stay there There will be no war for the franchise, he concludes If there is war, it will be for annexation Prank Salford, on the other hand, puts the case for the 21,000 Uitlanders who signed the petition to the Queen " E D " writes about the situation in France, where he thinks the existing state of smouldering revolution may " at any moment and in any place burst into fitful fire and flame " For the rest, he seems to ascribe these conditions to the Church and the Jesuits " Ritortus " writes about the imperialism of British trade He regards America as a far more powerful commercial rival than Germany United States exports of manufactures for the last fiscal year, he says, will be of greater value for the first time than the country's manufactured imports He quotes a writer in the " Forum," is he says that the decay of English manufactures is as inevitable as that of English agriculture As might be inferred, he girls at " our one-sided free trade policy," and speaking of Australia he has this passage " As Australia's wealth is mortgaged to British capitalists, so also is Australian trade In fact there is no longer freetrade between US and Australia, by which commodities are fred bartered for commodities with our kith and kin the picture of which fills Mr Chamberlain's imagination On the contrary, the exports to Australia represent to a large extent capital for new his comments, while the imports from Australia represent to a large c-lcntpnymont tothamortgi goes or

writes about the cancer problem, giving a gruesome description of the gross Hi of the disease, but of course admitting that after the century of research v> 0 are still completely in the dark as to the actual causation of cancer He mentions the " tomato " theory only to ridicule it, he examines the popular belief as to cancer arising from pipe smoking remarks on the double frequency of the disease in women UB compared with men , deals with the records of increase and dwells upon the improving prospect of cure as the most hopeful phase of the problem Among other papers are one by Professor Dowden on Puritanism and English literature, and by Prtdeno Harrison about Lamb and Keats, and others on the troubles of a Catholic democracy, the possible by of a Catholic university, the independence of Cuba, Denmark, and Germany, and the temperance question in the "Fortnightly" William Archer has some interesting assertions about The Gay Lord Quex " There is no more consistent, more

Archer alludes with some contempt to that thraldom of a conventional aestheticism n Inch declared sympathy, or a large admixture of sentimental interest in the fortunes of leading our motors, an indispensable condition of theatrical success Here he finds the appeal entirely to trio intellect, and its BUCCCBS offering a welcome indication that there exists in the great public some intellect to

anonymous contributor has a paper describing Lord Rosebery in a Palmerston with nerves and sensitive to criticism a weakness so obvious that it is hard for criticism to refrain He wants to resume influence in politics without responsibility, it is charged, and his position as ambiguous He cannot escape in the end from the inexorable law, that some manner of sacrifice is inseparable from the attainment of power His critic finds it doubtful if Lord Rosebery cares enough even for the attainment of his great ambition to overcome his horror of the brutal but necessary brawl of politics " K " contributes some really big points for the Liberal party it is disorganised, he says, with a stop-gap leader, and controllers who misjudge the Liberal feeling in the country Then he explains the Liberal collapse fairly enough as being due to the triumph of Liberal principles But it is not dead, and he indicates imperial federation, social legislation, taxation of urban land values, old age pension", the local veto, the reform of the House of Lords, and Church Disestablishment as his rallying points " Diploniatious " writes about the new situation in South Africa. A month before he wrote, he says, there B as no- where an impassioned or even a respectable demand for an energetic. policy against the lines Vaal What, then, is Mr Chamberlain's " new situation P" He finds it in the facts that the equitable naturalisation and enfranchisement of the Uitlanders would not swamp the burghers that the hostility of the Boers to the Uitlanders is animated largely by hostility to the paramount Power, and is stimulating a dangerous disaffection among the Dutch at the Cape, and that the President is as intractable as ever on the franchise question Among other contributions are papers dealing with BphorLS of interest in China, the local advantages of being a drunkard, a regenerated France, the shop seats movement, the " mean " Englishman, Lamennais, and Sarah Bernhardt In the " Nineteenth Century " there is a paper bearing the title "Are We to Lose South Africa ?" by Sir Sidney Sheppard, late administrator and chief magistrate of British Bechuanaland He also thinks that the issue of the Bloemfontein Conference created a new situation. He argues that both the Orange Free State and the Transvaal base their measure of internal independence on British naval supremacy, since the whole of South Africa lies at the mercy of the strongest navy. His sympathies may be judged from the manner in which he speaks of the political blunders of Mr. Gladstone. If we fail this time, he says, we shall lose South Africa, and with it the true key to the East, to say nothing of our other colonies. The article takes a wider view of the responsibilities involved in this Transvaal question than any of the other articles in the reviews on this subject. The Rev. Father Thurstan, S.J., writes about the medieval Sunday in a curiously informing way. The Lord's Day, he says, was a day of joy and rest and thanksgiving, leading to the encouragement of every form of innocent amusement and recrea- tion. Provision was made first of all for duties, of praise and thanksgiving, but this being scoured there was no idea of interfering with the national enjoy- ment of the people; nor was this idea abandoned at the change of religion. John Knox, we are told, found Calvin at Geneva doing honour to the Lord's Day in a game of bowls. Sunday sports in England lasted down to the beginning of the present century, and, says this writer, there was not more but loss drinking when the Sunday afternoons were spent, as the statutes directed, in the use of the how and in feats of strength and skill. "The Native Australian Family," by Miss Edith Simcox, is the title of a paper dealing with the tribal customs of Australian aboriginals. Sir Charles Roo discusses the crisis in the Church, but he doubts if there is any crisis. If there is it consists not in the danger of the Church being enslaved by a small band of extreme I Ritualists, but in the danger of Protestants being led to attack it Arthur T Wood writes about old age pensions in France, where a State provision of this kind has been in use since 1853 He quotes Bismarck's remark, that all State or State aided old age pensions are a bribe And ng the other contributions in this number are papers by H N G Bushey on parliamentary government in Japan, by Sir Spencer Walpole on Lord Ellenborough, and others on the tooth of the schoolboy, the international council of women, school children as wage-earners, the outlook of Ottawa, Dante's ghosts, and the open spaces of the full sure I
