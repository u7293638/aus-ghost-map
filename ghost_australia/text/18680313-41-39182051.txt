THE GHOST* OF THE NORTHERN f- TBSRITORY. :\Ir- JhereL are among -.the candidates' foe election jro''hex| j Parliament 'any men' of weak nerves and excitable temperaments, we would! recommend them to withdraw at once. They are endeavouring to force an entrance into a Chamber of Horrors, and to associate themselves with a haunted Parlia ment. Too true, alas ! the next Assembly which meets ob North-terrace will hare to face ' spirits' of the vasty ^deep*'— ffomth! Gulf oL Carpentaria.- , The ghoats of mur dered innocents wfll shriek* and squeal round Mr. .Speaker's chair. ' The guardian angel »f Arnheim's Land will rise in judgment .against thet noisy imbecility which has disturbed its primeval repose. A. horsehair- wig, .with, a stem judicial face under it, will float like , Macbeth's dagger ?before the eyes of Parliamentary land jobbers who cannot fulfil their contracts. The division- list of October, ,1866, will hang from the reporters' gallery like Belahazzar'a mysterious writing on the walL The ruH cundTface. of Arthur Blyth will present itself- surrounded with, a halo of prophetic glofy, and from its lips will re-echo the peroration which dosed the great debate on the refunding resolutions — - ' The House might postpone this question for a time ; but the day of reckoning with purchasers, who were neither few nor insignificant^ would come, and then they would not look back with pleasure at .their having allowed ;an opportunity to settle the question to slip.' From one point of view it is a pity that the new Ministerial scheme cannot be sub mitted to the same Parliament which; rejected the far more reasonable compromise of 1366. New members will not be able to realize the full extent of the folly then committed and the aggravation of the difficulty which has since arisen.' From another point of viewit may be better that the original contest should not be revived^' for nothing but mutaial recrimination, mingled, perhaps, withblubber-. ing repentance, could have come out of it.: The question of ' Who killed cockrobin?': is not to be decided by the little boys who threw the stones, but by the impartial spectators who stood by and -watched the operation. We maintained at the time, and have frequently repeated since, that the arrangement proposed by the Blyth Ministry was the best escape for us out of the Northern Territory muddle. In the words of Mr. Blyth himself, a valuable opportunity was then allowed to slip, and if the public wish to trace the origin of our present degrading situation it must be sought for in that fatal neglect. All who participated in it will now be wishing to vindicate themselves, and not without reason. It is far from being our function or our desire to excite the public mind against them, or to aggra vate their regret at the unexpected sequel. There will be more occasion to defend them by bringing to light all the extenuating circumstances of the case. The Assembly by its refusal to adopt a certain course rendered itself responsible for the con sequences of its non-adoption, though not for these consequences being so bad as they have proved. A Ministerial policy was submitted to it, and rejected with ridi cule, as pusillanimous. Yet it allowed the pusillanimous Ministry to retain office without dictating to it a better policy. Those who voted against the resolutions said in effect to the Government, 'You may do anything else you please but this one thing, which you think you ought to do.' The result is that nothing at all has been done, and the Assembly, in endea vouring to avoid an imaginary discredit, has made it tenfold worse. One member after another asserted that there was still plenty of time to survey the land and put the purchasers in possession. While . disclaiming responsibility plenty of good advice was offered, and the fact of too much of it having been accepted was in no small degree the cause] of the succeeding failure. Mr. Bright, whose having sat on the Northern Territory Commission gave him a right to do the paternal and dogmatic, recom mended a new survey at Anson Bay. The Hon. H. B. T. Strangways, with his accus tomed contempt for other people's difficul ties, thought 'there was no necessity for pressing the surveys at the present time, and that a fuller examination of the country should be made.' The Government first tried to please Bright, then to please Strang ways, and between the two stools the whole affair has thus fallen to the ground. Within a fortnight after the October debate an ad vertisement appeared, inviting tenders for the survey of 300,000 acres of land 'lying between] the east_arm of Port Darwin and the Daly Range, south to Anson Bay.' The tenders were to be at per acre, either including all costs, both of survey and transit, or of survey only. A date was to be stated for the survey to commence, and a period within which it would be finished; under a penalty of £50 per day for non completion. On the 10th December follow ing eleven tenders had been received, and on the 12th they were reported upon by the Surveyor-GeneraL Of course, as everybody had an opinion of his own about the Northern Territory,: it was not to be expected that so great an official as Mr. Goyder would allow the ill- fated subject to pass sub silentio. After particularizing the tenders, he pre faces his decision upon them with 'were it satisfactorily established that the best site had been chosen, I should not hesitate to recommend, &c.; ; but from the. evidence obtained by the Select Committee, and the offer of one of the firms to effect the survey. at a less cost else where, , it ? appears that such is far ; from beingtfrecase,' In shortrMr. Goyder, being an exclusive believer in Wright^ Woods, and Hamilton and the Victoria River, 're- gretted that any particular site had been named' in the advertisement. To remedy this vital error, it was necessary that a person should be appointed to select a site before any tender was accepted, and that he should be instructed to give special attention to the Victoria River. Captain Cadell turning up opportunely about this time, the tenders' were Bhelved, and ? the famous ' circum ambient' commission issued in the beginning of 18$7. TJ^Groyernment, after being driven from pillar to post by friendly advisers, made' a slight demonstration, qf originality to finish with, as we read in the now classic passage i—f' Prior, to my departure fro,m Adelaide, it was agreed between the Hgn. Chief Secretary and mysetf fiat, tateris paribua, the Liverpool River was, par excel? lenct; tho starting point of civilisation.' ; - ?' The non-publication of Captain CadelTs instructions leaves a missing link in our chain of evidence. It ia important to ascer tain whether or not the Government were then suitably impressed with the necessity of dispatch. Had they anticipated a loss of tweiye mgnthn put of the remaining two years in merely searching fpr a site they can never have supposed that the land w®M be surveyed at all. They had before them the eleven tenders for surveying it, and the shortest period specified in any of theaewas 417 days from the date of commencement, or 492 -jaya from the acceptance o:c the tender, Bay 1§ mon%. Messrs. ^Hgbt, Woods, and Hamilton said they fajn4 to be- able to ac complish it in one season^bWIhey 'could not engage to do it undergo Jieavyti penalty »s £50 a day.' Two other tenderers specified tmeen months from the date of commence ment, and; a fifth asked for two years and a haltv All the others discreetly left the period ?blank1. Witi\oat flying in the;.tee!th of pro fessional authority, it was' impossible to allow less than two clear seasons for the survey, and to secure these the survey party should nave' left along with Captain CadeTL I^SMI^s T^nljMr.. iBlyth'*.

'And yet, forsooth, the present Government\bas been almost goaded into an infinitely worse blunder. Never in all ourpolitical experience has there been a nearer approach to insanity than the proposal to attempt a forced survey now when barely & single season would be available for' it. . Operations could not be commenced before the end of May, : and, according to Captain CadeU, they would be stopped by the rainy season in the beginning of October ; allowing just' four months for what four; times as much1 has been demanded by axperienced surveyors. \\-*\ I'n ?-.? £ And the question of expense, too, haa been wofully,. caricatured by recent theorists.; The Government did not require to have amateur estimates forced down their throat to aggra vate their desperation.
