HAUNTED HOUSES All houses wherein men I are lived and died Axe haunted • houses. Through the open | . doors The harmless phantoms ou their errands glide. With feet that make no sound upon the floors. • * x ~ — . We meet lhem at the doorway, on the stair, , ■ Along: the passages they come and go, \ Impalpable impressions on the air, A sense of something moving to and fro.— There are more guests at table th'in- tHe hosts Xnrltid ; the illuminated hall Is thronged with quiet, inoffensive ghosts, As silent as the pictures on tHe wall- < The stranger at iny fireside can not see . The forms I see, nor hear the sounds I hear '; He but perceives what. is. while unto me All that has been is "visible and clear. We have no title-deeds to house * or lands ; Owners and occupants of earlier.dates Trom graves forgotten stretch their: dnsty. hands. And hold in mortmain still their old estates. The spirit-world around this world of sensa Heats lite an atmosphere, and* everywhere Wafts through these earthly mists and vapors dense - ,. A vital breath of more ethereal air. • * Our little lives are kept in equipoise -T.' By opposite attractions and desires ; The straggle.of the a*«t£nct that enjoys. - \- And the more noble Instinct ••r^res. These perturbations, this perpetual jar Of earthly wants, and aspirations high, Ovujf fmm .tK#* of an unseen star,. An "undiscovered planet-in omvskv And as the moon from some dark gate of cloud - Throws o'er the sea a..floating bridge of Kg'*, . " . Across whese trembling planks our fancies crowd ~ Into the realm of mystery and zm;ht— So iron* lhe world of spiritsthere descends A bridge of light, connecting it with *!»?«, O'er whose unsteady* floor.that. sways and bends, Wander our thoughts above the dark abrss. —Hesbt "W.
