The Storyteller. A LOST LIFE. CHAPTER XX. EVELINE VIVIAN for many days knew nothing but what her father chose to tell her, and that was wide of the truth. He told her that Jesuita and Margaret had ran away, and that Arthur had gone on sudden business to London. She did not believe him, bat the dared not say •o t sad then the heard rumor* of the murder of Mias de Cattro, and her discovery by a gentleman who called himself her guardian, but Whose name was unknown in the Tillage, and both she and Stanfeld not unnaturally imagined him to be the same gentleman who had brought Jesuita to the station. But somehow or other Eveline's mind instantly connected the attempted murder with her husband. She struggled ■gainst it, but in Tain ; and she grew nervous •nd fearful. Why didn't Arthur write P If he Wat in danger she would go to him, though he had so rudely crushed her love. " Where was he P" she asked her father, but he knew no more than she did now. "Where, thea, was Margaret?—she oould write to her." He answered her angrily, "He didn't know or care when she was, and she could know nothing of it." And so, ia restless anxiety and miserable un certainty, a month passed by. She oould gather nothing in the village, or even at Mrs Warren's j ■he could only tell her that the young foreign lady and Miss Arnndel had been ten days at her house, and then the gentleman had taken them both away. Bhe didn't know his name, bat he Was a tall dark gentleman, with very black hair and mustaches, and very like the young lady. She knew nothing of who had stabbed her, the young lady wonld not say, bnt she (Mrs Warren) thought that a detective was searching far him. No one in the village had even a sus picion as to who the murderer might be. It was one night about six weeks after the attempted murder that poor Eveline sat by her chamber window. Her lamp was on the table bnt she did not undress; she had seated herself there, listening half unconsciously to the autumn night wind, which rustled the leaves of the vine which climbed up the trellis outside, with her thoughts and heart far away, poor thin;, with the man who to little deserved her. Twelve o'elook had just struck, when a small ■tone was thrown up against the glass. Strangely the idea instantly crossed her that it Was her husband, and, gently opening the window, the leant out. "Arthur—husband!" she said, softly. M Hash! open the window, Erie, wide; lam coming up." She saw a figure below climb easily np the trellis, and the next moment Arthur Vivian ■tood in the room. He walked to the door and looked it, then put-to the shutters, while she ■tood watching him with parted lips and clatped hands, and something of almost terror in her aspect. " What are you looking so frightened at P" de manded Vivian, roughly. "Oh, Arthur!" said his wife, "why do yon come here this way, stealing in as if you feared the day." "I do fear the day—l am hunted like a felon 1" said Arthur, fiercely. " I come here to you because your evidence against me isn't legal, ■ad because you are fool enough to care for me a4flL n "Oh, Arthur, Arthur! how can yon?" she Cried, with bitter grief. " Are you not content With breaking my heart, and most you crash it under your heel ?" There was such anguish in her tone as for a moment touched even him, and his face softened With something of remorse as he said," Can yon love me still—even now P" "I do—l do!" she cried. " Oh, Arthur, let me lay my head on your breast, and feel onoe more that I am the wife you used to love!" -" Eveline!" he said, keeping her back with his hand, " would you rest your head on the breast of a murderer—touch the hand that is nd with blood P My hand is red with the blood of Jesuita de Castro." "Itis not!" she said, vehemently. "It is Stainless. Jesuita de Castro lives still." Arthur lifted his hands suddenly upward, and cried, " Oh, God!—if there is a God—am Ito be thankful or not?" His wife stood in horror-struck surprise. "Arthur," said she, "can you doubt which to beP" H Yes, Ido doubt,** he replied. "If there is a God, I call down bis heaviest curses on the head of that false Spaniard 1 Don't touch me, Eveline; for though I never loved you, you are my wife, and my hand is not as stainless as yours." " I will touch you, stainless or not. Ton are my husband," she said, throwing her arms round him; " let me be with you—let me share your danger and flight." " And get me taken. No," said Vivian, flinging her off. "I came here to get ■ome of my property, not to cumber myself With a wife. lam going away ; but whenever I want money I shall oome to you. And now listen, and say if you want to go with me. I was a murderer when I married you! I stabbed that Spaniard because she knows it." Eveline cowered on the floor, but still tried to clasp his hand. With a fierce oath he flung her back, and she sank senseless on the ground. When she recovered, the was alone, lying on the bed; and turning her face to the wall, the poor thing wept as if she would weep out her broken heart there; and then she lay still and quiet from the very exhaustion of grief. The wife of a murderer! The word rang in in her ears like a knell—the very silence of night rang with it—and then all her broken love rushed back on her heart, and died there. If he had uttered one kind word, or given her one land look, she would still have clung to him, notwithstanding the wreck he had made her love; but he had not done so. He had trampled on her in every way, he had spurned her, crushed her, flung her away, and avowed, with a sort of fierce, taunting cruelty, that he had wedded her with a red hand; and it was more than even Woman's love could bear, and her love died— though it broke her heart in doing so. She was startled by a knocking at the door, and a harsh Toioe crying, " Open—open the door, Eveline." Trembling every limb, the poor girl arose, and, opening the door, faced her father. " I heard a man's voice here," he said roughly. « Don't lie, girl. Who was it P Who was it, I say?" She dared not refuse to say, yet she feared to betray her hueband by replying; bat he grasped her arm, and with an oath bade her answer. "It was Arthur!" she faltered} "only Arthur!" "Ha! the villain, was it!" exclaimed Stan feld. "I have him at last." He was springing away, bat she flung her arms round him, and detained him. " Father, I father!" she cried j "you shall not leave here to " He was a passionate, vindictive man; and flinging off her arms with a fiercely passionate oath, he struck her, —yes, struck his own daughter, the child of the dead wife whose heart he had broken. \ "Oh, father oh, father!" So she moaned, j and wrung her hands when he was gone. So she moaned in her despair and misery for many a long hour; but when the morning came she was gone, and there waa only the following letter, whioh the servant gave to Stanfeld :— " The last tie is broken between you and me. You have always been harsh, always held me an incumbrance; and now that my husband has left me, the only link that bound ms to Forest Moor ia gone, and your own hand has snapped the last link that bound me to you. If ever we meet again, it must be your seeking, not that of Imm Vitiah." There were tear stains on this letter, but not! a line to give a trace of her; probably she had followed her recreant husband. Dashing down the letter, Stanfeld put his foot on it, exclaiming, « Let her go! I hated her mother, and I hate her and her sister! All an well rid of—all an dead to me for *ver!" And the echo of the old deserted room answered back " for ever!" as if it saw beyond them the grave and uttered the words of pro phecy. In the neat comfortable little parlor at the back of his shop sat John Everard, looking hardly altered from what he had been five years ago, save that his hair might have thinned a little, and perhaps he had some need now of the gold spectacles; but in appearance he was the same as ever—kind, hearty, and warm- hearted. And yet he had had sorrows—who has notP He had, early in life, lost his wife; and his daughter, round whom every fibre of his heart had twined, had, as we have seen, left him and fled—with a man he knew to be a villain. Tbat was nearly four-and-twenty years ago, and since then he had been alone; he had never seen her again, and though he knew she had had a daughter (of Theresa's birth he knew nothing), he had never seen the child, and knew not even if she was alive until about seven years before, when he had seen the announcement of her marriage with Arthur Vivian Esq., in the papers, and it was then he made a will, so tying up to her and hers his property. Somehow or other his thoughts wen even now going baok to the memory of other days when little feet had pattered about the old London house, and a child's little fee© had peered above the counter, and the old man's heart ached for the child he had lost, and warmly indeed would he have weloomed that child's unknown daughter. So he sat in that old dark panelled room, thinking, when his foreman opened the door and came in contrary to his usual custom t for though he had been there thirty years, he rarely entered his master's private room without knocking. But now he did, and said in a whisper," Mr Everard, there's a lady asking for you ; and, lawks, sir, just to see her! So like Miss Evie, that it might be just her come home again." The old man took off his spectacles, and rose, trembling and holding by his ohair. "Ask her," said he—" ask her her name." The foreman went back, and then the old gun smith heard a voice that thrilled through him, say, " Mrs Arthur Vivian," and the name of Eveline burst from his lips. She heard it, and the next minute she was kneeling at the old man's feet. "Grandfather, grandfather!" she cried. So like—oh, so like the child he had loved and lost that the long years vanished, and he saw only in the kneeling form his daughter coming to him again for the love and shelter she had found nowhere else; and clasping his trembling arms about her, he let her weep her very heart out on his breast, while his own tears fell thick and fast on the poor weary head that at last found rest. "My daughter—my Evie!" said he. " Come at last—home at last!" She lifted her face, then seeing what he thought, she said touehingly, "Not she—her child! Oh, grandfather, love me a little for my dead mother's sake, for I am fatherless, and worse than widowed." And the old man, as he held her to his heart, and heard her sad tale, felt that he had re* covered mon than his lost daughter j and that in her stricken child she lived again, refined, purified by the heavy hand of sorrow and suf fering. Perhaps heaven, in its mercy and good ness, had so chastened her. Ohaptu XXI. Thb long vacation—and a Tery long one it it —came to an end at last; the Lord Ohanoellor opened the courts again; and Parliament met to be prorogued till February; and busmen men again returned to London. Julian had written that he and Surrey would land at Dover on the 10th of November by the earliest boat from Oalais; and therefore, the night before, Egerton and Inez went down to Dover, to that they were ready to meet the boat. There, sure enough, were the two travellers; and as they stepped ashore, they were met by Sir Angelo and Inez. No one, to see them meet, and bravely shake hands, would hare guessed the deep emotion in the heart of each; for none could see the iron strength of that apparently cold olaap. Julian could not, if he would, hare spoken ; for the crowd of memories that welled up in the heart of the exile, as he once more stood on English soil, was too much for speech; but it was not till they reached the hotel, and were alone—for Inez and Walter purposely left them—not till Angelo grasped both his hands, and in his native tongue bade him welcome to home and old England, that the long controlled emotions of the exile's heart gave way; and the strong man bowed bis head and wept like a child. But both were calm when Walter and Inez de Caldara returned, and only her tender woman's eye, with the quickness of deep affec tion, detected traces of emotion which did man hood no shame. " Hare you brought home everything," she said, as she too bade him welcome, "so that you will never go away again ?" " Everything, dear Inez, pioturei included," he replied. " And," said Egerton, " I will leave Inez to take care of you while Walter and I go and see about getting your property through the Custom houae. It will take two or three days; but I'll leave Burns to see to it, for wo must reach Fal contower to-night." That evening the ancient gates of Falcontower Cattle rolled back to receive the exile to the home of his childhood. For one day only Egerton and big ward re mainad, and on the following morning they left the north, and returned to London. In the meantime the case of Egerton v. Stan feld came on to be heard. The court was pretty well filled; and as the evidence was principally to be taken in person, Walter and Egerton wen there with their solicitor, Mr Seymour, and Stephen Btanfeld came in with his attorney, a : certain Mr George Verney. The defence mad* wst that Walter Surrey was not the son of j Colonel Surrey; it being asserted by Stanfeld, and he held to it, that he had information of the said colonel's death without children. But each a defence had not a leg to stand upon. It was proved that Colonel Burrey had a son j and the letter was produced, written to Mias Norman after his engagement, tolling her who* and what he was. The certificate of his marriage with Gertrude Norman was produced, with the certi ficate of their child's birth, and a certified copy of the register of the colonel's death, which had occurred at Calcutta. Not to weary with details—the evidence was so dear for the plaintiff that the Vice-chancellor decided against the defendant, and made the order removing him from the trust, with some j very strong remarks on his conduct. Stephen Btanfeld left the oourt a rained man, and if it had taken place a few years later, he would have been sent across the seas under the Fraudulent Trustees Act. As it was, he was of course utterly unable to refund the immense sum ho was liable for, and he was obliged to pass through the Insolvent Court ; while Egerton took possession of Forest Moor for his ward, in tendiag in the spring to have the whole estate thoroughly looked after, from the Grange to die laborer's cottage. Willingly would Theresa have gone to bar father; but he wrote to her, commanding her to keep away. He was henceforth dead to her and Eveline, who he said had "gone abroad with Arthur—enrse them!" And this wss not contradicted, for Eveline said to her grandfather, " She is happy where she is. Better without such a sister as I am—better that the murderer's wife should be dead to her. She oould not be happy with yon or me." And so Theresa was left standing alone. Yes, alone ; her home, such as it was, gone, crumbled away into dost, as a skeleton, long enclosed, does when exposed to light and air. She learned —and learned through the public papers—that her father was a swindler, an insolvent, a ruined man alike in name and estate; and then earns his letter ignoring her from that day, her and her sister; " they were best without him, as he was without them." " I hated your mother," he concluded, " and I never loved her children. For you—you chose your own course, and must abide by it. For Eveline—she fled one night that Arthur cam*, and where she is I neither know nor care. She may have gone after him—it is most likely. Forest Moor is wrested from me; you and Eve line have seen me for the last time—you now hear from me for the last time; henceforth to you lam dead. This is the last from " Brans BumiD." With a perfectly white face, the friendless girl'went straight to Lady Alice St. John, showed her the letter, and told her her whole story, with hard, dry eyes, and hard, unchang ing manner. Alice Bt. John saw into the child's heart as plainly as if it had been an open book, and she held out her arms. "My poor child," she said; "oh, my poor chad." Theresa knelt at Alice's feet—laid her head on her lap, and wept as if her heart would break. 8o for a few moments Alice let her weep, and then the sweet pitying face bent over the home less girl, and a soft pitying kiss fell on her brow. "My darling," said Lady Alice, "lookup. My dear child, you know that neither I nor mine will value you the less for this." Theresa rose calm now, and taking the letter, tore it in half and flung it in the fir*. "So I wipe out all ties that onoe bound ms to him," she cried. "So I sweep away all memory of a home that never was a home, and a father who never was a father, whose very name shall be mine no more. Call me bones* forth Theresa Herbert." " My ebild, said Lady Alice, " would you de stroy the memory of your sister P" "No, oh no," she replied f "but Ido not think she has gone after or with her husband. She has more likely fled to our Grandfather, Mr Everard, the gunsmith." " If so, would she not have written to you?" asked Lady Alice. " I don't know—l can't tell," said Theresa. " Arthur Vivian may have forbidden her; there never was any love lost between him and me. If you will spare me for a couple of hours, Lady Alice, I will go to Bond-street; for though my grandfather never saw me, I must hear some thing of Eveline." "Go, my dear, and God speed you, for we leave here shortly for Faloontower. Take the carriage," and Lady Alice rang the bell, and ordered the carriage. Thus it came about that a brougham stopped before John Everard's shop, and a lady, closely veiled, stepped out, and entering the shop, ad dressed the ancient foreman, "Is Mr Everard within P" "No, ma'am, he is out," was the nply. "Is there a young lady living here?" she asked, "a Mrs Vivian P" "Yes, ma'am, there is my master's grand daughter," said the foreman. " Mrs Vivian is now at home." " I must see her—and at once," said Theresa. The foreman bowed, rang a little bell, and a maid-servant appeared, who conduoted Theresa up stairs to a very pretty drawing-room. " Tell Mrs Vivian that Miss Herbert wishes to see her," said Theresa. The girl left the room, and Theresa threw op her veil and stood waiting. A slow filtering step came along outside, and Arthur Vivian's forsaken wife entered. " Theresa!" she cried. One spring, and poor Eveline was in her sister's arms. And then they told their griefs to each other, for Eveline, ever weak and clinging, must lean on something, and Theresa must have sympathy, and so in mutual confidence they found mutual relief and com fort. John Everard came in shortly afterwards, and the dear good old man welcomed the second grandchild almost as he had done the first, and wanted her to live with him also; but Theresa knew well that it was better for all parties that she should not; besides, she could not honor ably leave her situation j so she said shs would remain there. All she asked was a place in her grandfather's heart, and a corner of his hearth as a home. . Thus once more the light shone on her path, and thus Theresa Herbert was not left standing alone. Chaptm XXH. It wh a fine frosty morning of a bright mnny day in December that tb» «iniw wbieh w»« bearing Mrs IToiJiestar and her daughter and Cousin Tom to Falcontower new ad ita destina tion, label had never been then before, and everything had an interest for her. "Oh, mammal" the exclaimed, at they entered the quaint old town of Faloontower, "do look at that dear old inn, the Bgerton Arms," pointing to a wandering old inn facing the tea, and which had stood for ages. "Ah," aaid Marion, "the walla of that inn concealed a lord of Faloontower once, when soldiers were searching his own cMtle far him in vain. 1* "Who wm that, mamma P" asked IsbeL «Angelo*e great grandfather, 1* replied her mother. "Sir James Bgerton wm out in the • forty.five' you know, and after the Pretender fled back to France, he came hero, and wm actually in that inn while the royal soldiers were eearehing the castle. Ton will see hia picture up yonder." Here the carriage stopped at the gates of the Park, of which on thia aide there waa about a mile to traverse. They were obliged to go slowly, for all the way the road wm a steep ascent on the right, far below rolled the sea, and they could hear the sullen measured roar of the breakers m they crashed on the rocks and beach beneath, while to the left, m far m the eye could reach, it rested enchanted on forest-dad heights with giant oaks, and waving pines, and and wooded valleys, and deep and rocky gorget. It wm indeed a noble domain, and right noble too wm the stately old cattle which now bunt upon their view. "Why," aaid Isbel, when she could speak, "it hM all its fortifications, just m in ThfttgoMeßutl«a*tia* ' Wlien kalghta and nobles far a lady* love Would apaar the dragon." "Tea," said her mother | "though it hM stood nearly eight oratories, and many a siege, ite successive owners have oared se well for it, that there's little or nothing of ruin about it. Look at ite lofty stern old donjon, with the proud banner of a proud house waving over it." "What an impregnable fortress!" said label. Marion smiled, and Tom aaid, " Strong m it looks, a smart cannonading of modern artillery would soon make a ruin of that grand old baronial pile." Isbel aaid no more, but m the carriage rolled under the massive gateway, and she glanced at the grim walla and frowning towers and battle* meats that rote up on all sides, she could not help saying, «I shouldn't like to be a prisoner here, though." The carriage passed through another gateway into an immense quadrangle, and drew up before the magnificent entrance, where instead of mail*clad knights, Inez and Egerton received them, and gave them " welcome to old Faloon tower," and Inez herself took Marion to her room, and m the left her at the door, whispered, MI mutt go to receive the other guests who have arrived.and are in their rooms; but when you are ready go to Aogelo't private study (you know your way), Julian is there." Knew the way—of eoune she did, and through the upt and downs of dark gallerue and stairways gained the door. Julian wm in that study; at last the wm to meat the son she had parted from nine yean before, and now that moment had arrived, the stopped, trembling, almost fearing to enter the room | it wm only a moment, and then she went in. There he. stood | changed mhe waa, she knew him, and the emotion of yean seemed crowded into the single moment the paused, ere she sprang forwards to the arms that held her so dose. "Julian! my boy, my ton! my worshipped boy!" All the anguish of that long, weary separation wm forgotten, and in that moment she knew, fdt only that she once more cUaped her son, her idolised boy, to her mother's heart; for the very mother who bore him could not have loved him with a greater love than hit step-mother did. He let her weep the happy teen that might at last flow, and his own brcMt heaved, but then he held her off. "My beautiful mother, my own sweet mother," he aaid, in a low voice i "it seemed m if we were never again to meet on this side of the grave, and now it must be by stealth m if it were wrong." " But, oh, Julian," she said," for my sake, if not for your own, remember that in public we are nothing but strangen." That ia the hardest to bear," said Julian, bitterly; "to be compelled to treat you, and Angelo, and Inex m comparative strangen." " Dear Julian, my dear son," said his mother, again winding her arms round him, " hope and trust that all wOl come right; it it begun, if it had not, you could not now be here; and though the murderer bM escaped, be will surely betaken." " Look at me, mother, and tdl me if I am to changed that no one will recognise me, not even Tom Courtenay P" Tom had known a beardless youth of eighteen, with a fair complexion and golden hair. Now, in his place there stood a tall, strong man of seven-and-twenty, with a bronzed complexion, a dark mustache on the lip, and hair which, if it had retained any of its golden light, had deepened into a rich dark brown, totally differ ent to the tunny locks of the youth. The eyes were the same; but the very features had changed. They had grown sterner, more de fined ; and care and sorrow had not left seath lest the onoe smooth brow. The very smile was sadder, and his voice had deepened and mel lowed. And m Marion gazed on the face of her son, she felt that none would recognise in the somewhat foreign-looking Julian Rothesay the Julian D*Arey they had known m a boy and youth. " You are so changed, my darling boy," she aaid, "that even Tom will not know you." The door opened softly, and Inez glided in. " Angelo sent me," she said, with a gentle smile. " Isbel hM missed you, aunt Marion; go back, and you, Julian, come with me another way. We must enter the drawing-room by the bou doir." She puahed Marion gently from the room, and came back to Julian. " Now, you'll remember that I must 'Mr Bothesay * you." { " And must I' miss * you P" said Julian. "No," said she; "because Angelo and I were so intimate with you abroad when I wm quite a child." " So, m you are not yet grown up, I may still 'Inez * you," added Julian, smiling. < " Yes, and I'll tell you this," said Inez, "no one here understands Italian but you, I, Angelo, and Marion; even Isbel doesn't, for she learnt German instead, and, m you have been so long in Italy, it will not be counted rude now and then to speak to you in Italian, but rather a courtesy to you." "Thank you for the hint," said Julian. "Now come." They reached the dmwing-room toon after Mn Rochester, and then Angdo introduced Jntim to hi* raeste. of whom m y«t there were none but whom we know: Lady AHce St. John, and her eona and niece, with Theresa, the Rochester*, Waiter Surrey, and Roland Aubrey, whom, having met in town at Louit St. John's, Egerton had Mked to Falcontower m a return for hia courtesy to hit ward. ckapto mn.

"With pleasure," wm the reply. "Ah! hen it Walter Surrey.** Burrey approached, smiled, and offered her his arm, and taking it Inex led the way to the magnifloent picture gallery—a perfect gallery of art | sculptures and painting, ancient and modern; maater-pieoes of all agee were here gathered together. There seemed scarce a painter or sculptor, from ancient Oreeee to the present day, but had contributed tome gem of art to it, and while Walter wm bending over a dastie vase, Isbel wm standing entranced before an exquisite painting of Sir ThomM Lawrence's, representing a beautiful woman in early youth. " Who is this?" almost whispered Isbel. " It is Helen Rothcsay, Lady Bgerton, Bir Reginald's mother. She died young. This wm painted from a crayon of her." "Poor thing! And who are those two—in this one large frame P What a beautiful eoaple !'• She might well say so. It wm a picture of a handsome man in a Highland bonnet and plaid of the Stewart tartan, and leaning on his arm wm a young and most beautiful Italian lady, with one of those faces that, like Charles the First's, teemed to have a heavy doom written in them. " Who are these P" she next enquired. "That is Sir James Bgerton," taid Inex. "He wm out in the' forty-five,' and died abroad in the service of Prince Charles, while hia ton wm secretly brought up at the cattle.** " And this fair Italian " "Wm his wife, Leonora D'Este. She wm following her husband into exile, but the vessel wm wrecked on the French coaat. Her corpse wm found and secretly brought here and buried in the cloisters. There is a broken oolumn on her tomb.** " How come* Sir James in that dress ?" Mked Isbel. "His mother wm the daughter of a Sir Archibald Stewart, who had lands in Blair Athole. That is how it is." "I should have told Sir James's for an Egerton face," observed Walter. " I observe in all these portraits a strong family likeness, from that grim old knight of Norman William's to Bir Angelo; they have all the same fall gray eye and somewhat Roman CMt of faoe; they have been a dark race and a handsome one." " Ay," said the CMtilian, passing slowly on, " and an unquiet one; few of them have died in their beds." "Indeed!" said Isbelj "but it there no portrait of Sir Angelo P" " Tes, just near," wm the reply. A step more, and they stood before Julian's mMterly portrait of Egerton, which wm hanging next that of his beautiful and ill-fated Spanuh mother. On the other side of his there wm a blank space. Walter Surrey stood for a long time looking at both, then glanced several times from the portraits to Inex, and then said, " Miss Rochester, look at these three faces; how alike they are. Surely, Miss de Caldara, this dark lady wm some relation to you and your guardian!'* Inez dropped her eyes from Jesnita's picture, and said, " Certainly. She wm hi* mother, and my second cousin. Her name wm Caldara." She passed on as she spoke, but the sunlight from a window gleamed for a moment on a few gray hairs amidst Inez's raven tresses, and Walter, m he saw them, remembered with a pain of self-reproach what before he had for gotten—that he had heard that Lady Egerton had come darkly by her death. ' Chapter XXIV. Bronx Stanvbld left the Insolvent Court • ruined, childless, homeleM man. One child had fled from him—he neither knew nor eared where, and the other he had deliberately flung away, lets friendless in the wide world without than with him. He turned his back on the mighty city, a man whose own hand bad made him at sixty utterly alone and friendless in the world. Not even a memory of a being who bad lored him, and whom he had loved. Where did the man whose whole life had been a tissue of wrong pass that Christmas night ? Wander ing like a ghost about the desolate, deserted mansion that for nearly forty yean had been his—not even a single light there now. Every window was shut up and barred; the weeds prew more rank, the hemlock more tall and ■tragglmgi the Km flowers Arthur's wife had been used to train and toad war* dead now, and nothing but deaelation reigned in the lonely old Orange, where some fifty years before old Her* bert Surrey had kept open house, and, later, banished his only son from—all dead } and now the old place had passed once more into the hands of the Burreys, represented by the son of Armitage Surrey • and as Stephen Btanfeld stood beneath the tall trees and gazed on all he had lost, he lifted his hand and cursed aloud the name of Angelo Egerton, the man who had wrested so fair a domain from his hands. " Ay, curse away!" said a voice. Curses, they say, recoil on them as speak them." And a tall, portly man stood before him. "What are you doing on these grounds, eh P" MWhat I chooee!" replied BtanfUd. "Who are you, fellow P" \- Maybe an honester man than Stephen Stan f eld," was tbe reply. •• My name's Sam Warren, and I'm left in charge here by the gentleman you so liberally provide with a warm place in eternity. You're trespassing here, sir, and must leave." "Do you know, fellow, that I was master here P" said Stanfeld, fiercely. " Certainly, sir, you were i but Sir Angeb Egerton is master here now, and he has placed me in charge, so be kind enough to walk away, sir. I don't wish to be rude, but duty is duty." Btanfeld tamed on his heel, and walked away ! —• homeless wanderer—made so by his own hand alone. Where that snowy winter's night was Arthur Vivian P While the good old yule log biased in the immense hall of the keep at Faleontower Castle—while a gay and happy crowd merrily danced the " Sir Boger de Ooverley "—while the sad face of Jesutta de Caldara looked mourn* fully down on the many bright young faces, her assassin was standing before John Everard's door, closely wrapped in a heavy mantle, and with his hat slouched low, but still worn with a certain jaunty air, as if he knew—as he did— that he was handsome. He stood there hesita ting whether to knock boldly, or watch an oppor tunity of finding out if his wife were there. He wanted money, and he knew he could get it from her, if she had it. He knocked at last at the private door, which was opened by a middle aged woman. "Does a lady live here of the name of Vivian P" he said—" Mrs Vivian P" " Yes, sir, Mr Everard's grand-daughter." "Will you be kind enough to tell her that a gentleman—an old friend—wishes to see her at onoe, and privately P" " Step into this room, sir. What name shall I say?"* " None—merely what I said." The woman retired, and in a few minutes his wife stood before him, looking very ill, but firmer than he had ever yet seen her. "Do you know," she said, putting out her hands to keep him back, " that there is a prioe on your head—that you are pursued P Do you oourt death, that you venture here P No, keep back—do not touch me." " Erie, Erie!" he said. "Isit my wife who speaks P You used to love me. Are you not still Arthur Vivian's wife P" "That dark night," she said, still keeping him back, " when you told me you never loved me—when you told me you had wedded me with a red hand—when you flung me from your bosom with fierce oaths, my love died. Your wife—yes, lam Arthur Vivian's wife; but lam not to be brutally flung away one day and wooed back at his pleasure. Arthur Vivian, I know you now." " Eveline, hear me, hear me!" he implored. " I am a wanderer on the earth, an exile, a pro scribed man, hunted from oity to city, from land to land ; houseless in the dark dreadful night, without the means to evade present want, or live from day to day. Eveline, will you let your husband be taken for want of means to leave the country for ever P" "Swear to me that you will never let me see your face again," said Kveline i " that the few months I have to live shall be passed in peace, and I will give you the means to fly." " I swear it," he replied. His wife threw a heavy purse on tbe table t he took it up, moved towards the door, and then paused. "What do you mean by the few months you have to live P" he asked. "Look at me, Arthur Vivian," said his wife. "I am dying! One kind word from you that night would have saved me." " Eveline, Eveline! have I not enough blood on my head, but yon must lay yours on me, toor " Arthur, farewell," said Eveline. " Oh, Ood have mercy on yon I" " Ood!" he murmured, as he stood once more in the darkness and falling snow, and raised that face of dark and agonised beauty upward. " I dare not believe in Ood—it were to drag me into hell. My only hope is that 'after death is nothingness.'" [ Ohaptsb XXV. "Ahd now, ladies and gentlemen," said Angelo Egerton, the morning after Christmas Day, " how do you propose to spend to-day P It is fine and frosty for those who like to go out, and for those who don't, there is plenty in doors." " Put it to the House," said Tom Courtenay. "I move that the speaker do order out the horses for a general gallop over the heights. Come, ladies and gentlemen, those who second me, up hands." All hands were held up save those of Lady Alice St. John, Julian Bothesay, and Egerton, and the latter said, " Well, I see the vote is general. I must beg you all to excuse me, for I have business to attend to; but Inei will go with you as guide. She knows the district as weU as I do." "Am I to order your horse, Julian P" asked Inez, with her hand on the door. " No, I remain with Angelo," he replied. " Are any of the ladies particular about what horses they ride?" added tbe young hostess. "Mine are, my dear," said Lady Alice; " Arabella and Theresa are timid riders, if you have any quiet horses." "Oh, yes, they shall have the phaeton ponies," said Inex; " They are swift, bat per fectly gentle." She left the room to order the horses, and the ladies betook themselves to don their riding habits. Inez was down in less than ten minutes, and went off to the great quadrangle, where the gentlemen and horses were waiting. " Where are you going to take us, Inei P" said Louis St. John; " east, west, north, or south P" "North, I think," she replied. "Take them round by the Devil's Book, Inei," said Egerton. " Ah, here are tbe ladies." The whole party were soon mounted, the castle gates were flung wide, and with Inez at their head, they swept through, and descended the steep hill on which the castle stood, taking their way along the cliffs. Egertonand Julian ascended to the wall and sauntered round to the) north rampart. " Look!" eaid Angola, throwinf his arm ova* Julian's iboolder m thej etood aide bjaid«| v Inez has art them in a canter already. 1* "Ay," i*id Julian, "and Walter and Miff Herbert are latt." " How's that P" said Bgerton, unearilj, "I mounted him welL" "Ho probably likes the lady's oompany," observed the artist, glandng at Angelo's dark face. "Too much, I thought, last night," Mid Egerton, with ahalf laugh} "but it may be • mere boyish fancy for almost the first pretty English face he has seen muoh of." " Are you afraid of hi* seriously oaring for her P Don't you want it P" " No," said Bgerton, very decidedly. « You know who she really is P" " Yes," replied Julian. " Stephen Btanfeld't daughter." " His child, and sister- in-law to a murderer,** said Egerton | " her sitter is Yifian's wife. A. nios connection truly for the son of Armitage Surrey," he added, with a strong emphasis. " But she seems a very sweet girl, though," said Julian. "If Walter should really can for her, you will not stand between them P" " If he was any relation of mine, I rery da* eidedly should," replied Egerton. " And as it is P" said Julian. " Sufficient unto the day is the e?il thereof," said Egerton. " WiU he be muoh of a paints* P" "Yes, a most talented amateur," replied Julian. "If, instead of baring property, ho bad to lire by it, he would hare been a vary superior artist." "How is it, old fellow, that you haven't brought home an Italian wifeP" said Angelo, smiling. "No, noj my exile only makes me ding closer to everything English," said Julian. "I might atk you, rather, why you don't present me to Lady Egerton." Angelo half smiled, but the smile was a aid one. "Julian," said he, "I am thirty-seven* there are lines on my brow, and there is gray in my hair i it will be hard to make any fair young girl lore me now." " Dear Angelo, I am sorry to find so eminent a politician talking nonsense. You might | and might still choose any girl you liked." "Julian, have you yet found your ideal P" asked Angelo. "The ideal, if found, is often beyond reach," said Julian, evasively. Angelo's dark eyes turned on him with a keen, penetrating glance, that it was well Julian did not meet He answered quietly, "It is often nearer to us than we imagine, Julian." " Have you yet found your ideal of woman, Angelo, or have you placed it so high that mortal being cannot approach it?" Egerton recoiled a little, but answered," I did not create my own ideal j I can no more help placing it high than I can help worshipping all that is grand and beautiful." " A Jesuitical answer," said Julian, smiling. Then he said, perhaps because he intuitively felt the subject a painful one to his com panion, or it might be that the very depth of the love he bore him made him see through Angelo's veil of proud reserve, " I heard Walter Surrey speaking of the portrait. • Tekel' is the name it seems known by. Does he know whose por trait it is P" " Yes," replied Egerton. " Yesterday he and I were in the chapel cloisters, standing by my mother's tomb » he said he had seen the pietura at the National Gallery, and was expressing his wonder how any imagination could oonoeivo such faoes as those of the man and the phantom who holds the scroll. "'Bothessy didn't imagine them,' said L ' Have you never seen a face like the phantom P' " * Yes,' he said t *it was like my ward» but he knew that the painter knew her.' "• Well,' I said,' and the picture is the por trait of a living man.' " ' Ah! is it possible P' he cried, holding up his hand. * What a horrible oountenanoo! Do you know him P' "'My mother's murderer,' said I, quietly. 'I had it painted { and it will finally be brought to the gallery here.' I believe he thought bm half mad," added Egerton, with his low, soft laugh. M But now, Julian, I must go to my study, and attend to my business. Where if Lady Alice r " I am going to find her," he replied. Each went a different way—Egorton to tho library, Julian to the drawing-room. iTO BB OOXTODBD.] At the Adelaide Local Court, on Wednesday, July 9, in the unsatisfied judgment cut of Ann M'Carthy t.

The Wellington (N.Z) Pott says:—Some rery interesting additions have just been made to the contents of tbe Colonial Museum, in the shape ot some fossil reptilian remains /bond at Amuri and Waipara, in the province of Marl borough. These are in excellent preservation, and are being well mounted, 'lhey include, among other formidable relies cf the mysterioua past, a most terrific pair of jaws, several feet in length, which evidently enoe belonged to a gigantic specimen of tb« crocodile dais, appa rently a sort of cross between the icthyosaoras and plesiosauras, partaking somewhat of the characteristics of both, yet with peculiarities distinct from either. The enormous teeth are in wonderfu Jy good preservation.
