Mr. Griffith, Mr. Hemmant, and Mr. Hamilton were always present; Mr. M'Uwraith' attended only on the first two days, t gather from what I hear from the London representative* 'of other colonies that, the proosediogs hare1 created no interest outside of the commission room. I am informod that at the outlet the oennmiisionert invited Mr. Griffith to formulate some kind of obaiige-in fact, to appear as formal prosect^tor or accuser, and that at length it Was understood that he should appear as qussi-counpel i t)iat jn that capacity he examined the witnesses, taking in that TOy.o leading nut fa the inquiry j that ho called, amongst ethers) Mr, Maoalister, Mr. Lorimer, managing director pf the SteeljQotg. puny of Scotland; Mr..
