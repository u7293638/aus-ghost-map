SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. THE V. R- C. AUTUMN MEETING. [BY TKMSOUAVII.J FROM OUR SPECIAL REPORTER.) MELBOURNE, FRIDAY. The races will be concluded to-morrow, when a first-class programme will be discussed. The first race, the Nursery Handicap, is too open, but Duchess and Ween look best for the Three and Four Year Old Handicap. Judged from the state of the market it would appear that Ilesporiiin is a good thing for the Newmarket Handicap, and if Pigott rides him in preference to Surrey, he must be hard to boat. Pi egress, Wellington, and Com- motion may divide the honours" for the Town Plate. Navigator should win the All-Aged Stakes; and Lucy and Great Western are likely to come home as named for the Steeplechase.
