THE NORTHERN TURF CLUB. (To the Editor of THE NOETHEBN AEGUS.) How are the mighty fallen ? How are the sporting men of South Australia gone to the dogB ? Ghosts of Fisher, Frigate, and Mal colm, arise, and stir the spirits of our honey men! Bad seasons and private cliques have certainly worked against the eons of Vimrod in Adelaide; whilst they bare as certainly done as much for us in Clare. But the difference in the position of the two clubB is this-The South Australian Jockey Club burst up in a state of bankruptcy, whilst the Northern Turf Club rested on their oars with the neat little sum of Â£80 to the good. Now, the question is, have the public of the Northern townships an interest in the matter, or is it wholly vested in the trustees of the de funct club? To private individuals who have subscribed their one or two guineas answers have been given by the secretary that all ex planations will be given to members of the club. Now, as the last meeting was held nearly two years ego, and no subscriptions have eince been collected, or business transacted, how can mem-' berehips to the aforesaid club be-claimed f Any how, whilst tilings are lying dormant as at present* sport is going to the doge, and South Australia taking a comfortable back seat in the racing programme of the colonies.
