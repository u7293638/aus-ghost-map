S^E MISG^IEVOUS GHOST. While going my way in this world one time I happened. this ghost to meet. And forth from his eyes Bhqt a yellow ligljt, That enveloped him down to the feet. His movements were noiseless, his voice hollow and low; ' My heart beat exceedingly fast, ^or thus he addressed me — ?* I'm wel} pleased, niy friend. That you in my way should be cast. And now I will tell you what I can do, Yes, what I have already done, £!rUBbing happiness, and fostering woe. From palace to humble home. Long haye, I, roamed absnt on this earth, And great is the mischief Tye done ; J. have entered the mansion amongst joy aqd mirth, And I've broken up many a home. Wham Vinnninoaa riwolf.

At picnics I'm present, and at parties tqq, ' . And a deal of unpleasantness cause, In private my mischief I also pursue And separate belles from their beaus. {Sometimes have I caused human bipod to, fie shed, And sometimes to. death ha. ye I led, For many through me. have u^sed pietol or aword, And have fell by t^e bullet ot blade. And mischief I'll dq, long as I exist, Should it be through the. years of eternity ; J'or 'tis my delight much sorrow to cause ; I am known yery well—rl am * Jealousy .''- C C T gawler, March 26, 1876.
