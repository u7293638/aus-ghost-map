' In his young days he knew Gordon- the poet, and says that he " was- looked upon then as a plucky, erratic hors£ma.n, absent minded at times,, but no, one talked much of his poetry. A man has to die," Tommy'philosophically observes, " before anyone thinks very, much of him at anything." Tommy gives a humorous descrip tion of hiis first steeplechhse at Woodford, a village a few miles out of^ WarrnambooL' It was a -pub lican's meeting, where* the bellman ;wfent about Calling, " Malce ye'rinthries now for the hack steeplechase ;j the •: first ' man > * ho V a ' saddle and seccund a t^hip ahd 6phur^" ^Tooigiy had been sent to mind^cacttje forr: tJheiday,^j3atih^ whipped theft iintC a yasdv cawgh^h|s Jtfttlp,.

The other day a commercial traveller entered his establishment seeking for , orders. George was standing behind the counter, and the commercial greeted him cheerily thus—" Good morning, Mr. Shenton. My name is Bags, and I am represent ing the firm of Plum, Duff, & Co. Can I do any business with you?1 "No," replied Shenton, curtly assuming a 'aughty air, " I only deal with principals." "Oh," returned the other, and then added quickly, " Well, I say, Shenton, just give me a hat; a ten and sixpenny one." And the knight had to go* and fossick round after the tile. * * * You all know the shields which are used for advertising purposes by the proprietors of Wolfe's schnapps. The words, "Drink Wolfe's schnapps," are very distinctly printed thereon, and after having seen them you in all probability adjourn to the nearest hostelry and obey the admonition. Well, it happened that one of these shields fell into the possession of a temperance body, who resolved also to use it for advertising purposes. The invitation to absorb alcohol was pasted over, and the following legend was put in its place :— " I.O.G.T., Crystal Stream Lodge, No. 8." Alas1! for the good intentions of the Good Templars. The wind and the rain are no respectors of I.O.G.T. Lodges, and now the startled observer may see on the shield the words " I.O.G.T. Drink Wolfe's Schnapps." And outside the temperance lodgeroom, too ! •' -7~ -■ ■ Whence :6jqy»jr«jr recently visitfd= the country a lady was &ske;<l by her children to take them to witness the arrival of His Excellency. " No," she replied, " it is nothing for me to see a Governor. I am used to seeing princes * fact, I have dined with a prince." And yet are some malicious people who are saying thf^j|he occasion of the dinner was a meal in a restaurant, and that the doting mother was prii^paliy occupied in seeing that the royal plate was kept duly stocked. * * * A fair and popular Hebe presides over the saloon of a certain Hindley Street establishment where tire fvai#s of various descriptions are vended. a pretty wit, and matiy of those who attempt^ air their cleverness at her expense find to theirchagrin that they have caught a Tartar. The other day a 5igh and 'aughty member of the Gaiety Company, who was staying at the hotel, imagining that her wants were not being attended to with that dispatch which -their im portance demanded, came flouncing down to the saloon, and in afieeted tones remarked, " I say, barmaid,. just tell the housemaid that I require her services." This was too much for Maggie, but she had not to wait long before she retaliated upon the high kicker, for at that very moment who should appear but the housemaid herself. Maggie drew herself up to her full height of live feet nothing and a little bit over, and assuming the affected style of the first speaker, called out, "Miss Mary, the ballet girl wants you." Ta-ra-ra- boom-de-ay 1 * * * There is a lady in the country in whose parlor there is a book on the flyleaf of which is the notification that the volume was presented to her in—well, let us say 1870, as a prize for landscape painting. Some cttrious individual happened to be glancing through the work, and discovered that the work itself was not published until 1876. The lady ought certainly to receive an award for imaginative creations. * * " Tolstoe's Krentzer Lonata " —• Kapunda Herald. * * * James Munro, ex-Premier and Agent-General of Victoria, has just been whitewashed. His liabilities were £94,066 16s. 5d., and his assets ,<£43,960 lis. 8d. (on paper), leaving a deficiency of £50,106 4s. 9d. The burst boomer made an affidavit that in 1885 he was worth £80,000 clear and in 1889 £240,000 clear—also on paper. The estate has not yet paid a dividend, and an opposing lawyer contended that the insolvent had been guilty of an extreme amount of gambling and a gigantic lot of speculation. Where does the joke come in? Why, the.Judge gave this man Munro a clean discharge from all his debts ! What do you call that but a huge joke ? * * * " Everybody wants it, but everybody does not know how or where to get it. What! Why, cash, to be sure. Many go to financial agents and probably meet with a measure of success. Should you be in Sydney, however, and in Elizabeth Street, well, you'll find there a sign announcing that Cash is a financial agent.

" Oh, I learnt that I had to bring a shilling for the missionaries, eighteenpence for a present for teacher, and that Noah built the Ark." Fred B. Norton has an original ghost story. He had been seeing a friend off by the 2 a.in. train £rora Manchester to London, and Was tramping homewards. It was a bitterly cold and dark night—-just the lime for a'ghosttdmake his appearance. Suddenly Fred was : almost blinded by a glare of light, and immediately afterwards^ he perceived a mysterious figure in <white, which appeared to be rocking itself to and fro as though in agony. His first impulse was to fly, but summoning up his courage he thus addressed the spectre:—" Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned, be thy intents wicked or charitable, thou com'st in such a questionable shape, that I will speak to thee." Then a voice proceeded out of the stillness—"Shut up, thou doinned fobl, and come in and warm thyself." The ghost was a very substantial personage. In fact, it was the baker of the district who had come outside to get a mouthful of fresh air. The sudden fiash of light came from his. oven when he opened the door, and, as it, was. an eager and a nipping air, old Doughy had been. engaging in some extension movements. Fred stifled an interjection that might have appeared rude, and, \- • - ' ' r .
