SYDNEY WEEK BY WEEK (By Emily Soldene.) Well, we had a grand wind up at Randwick on Saturday. Nothing like a little variety, you know, and I arrived just in time to see the place abso- lutely deserted— not a soul — nothing but here and there a booky’s bag lying on the ground — I sup- pose they were empty! Suddenly, a great “O— h!” and I could see in the distance horses jumping. It was the Steeplechase, and everybody had gone to see it. The “O— h!” meant a horse — perhaps a rider—down. I walked slowly. Just behind me were Mr. and Mrs. C. J. Roberts. “It’s the Steeple- chase,” said I. “Yes,” said Mrs. R.; “come along, quick — I love it!” * * * * I don’t— I hate it! Every time the horses take a fence I get an agony; and the ambulance trotting from one side of the course to the other, ready for the probable accident, gives me fits! Lots of women feel that way — only they won’t own up. * * * * In spite of my loafing about I was close up as the horses came galloping into the enclosure; and there it was — the sight I dreaded — one of the boys satu- rated with blood, his white jacket all dabbled. He looked pretty rocky — swayed a bit in the saddle— and the people applauded wildly. * * * * “My word, he’s a plucky one,” said a well-dressed woman. * * * * “What!” said somebody; “not er bit on Levanter? W’y, it was a sure thing! He’s been gallopin’ and jumpin’ all over New Zealand for months carryin’ 13st, and winnin’ everything!” * * * * So unfeeling— telling one these sort of things when the race is over! * * * * Lovely day; lovely ladies (perhaps the tiniest, wee-est trifle too much rouge here and there. Mais que voulez vous; when one has been dancing all the nights and racing all the days). Lovely dresses; a little bit on Amberite (the last hundred yards was worth a Jew’s eye), and some iced champagne made up a very good time. * * * * A great crowd of men, all wearing frock coats and new, or nearly new, and shining silk hats. I suppose it isn’t raining in London just now, for then trousers were not turned up. * * * * In these latitudes some time ago it was consid- ered disgraceful to wear a decent hat. I remember last year, when I was home, lunching one day at the House. All the members, without exception, wore shabby hats, Mr. Balfour’s being perhaps quite the worst. I astonished my host immensely. “This puts me in mind of a Government House party in Sydney,” said I. “Why?” said he. “Everybody’s hat is so bad,” said I. * * * * Major the Hon. George Bryan was delightfully refreshing and Newmarkety. He wore a white hat (the only one on the course, and a mile too big for him; but that’s a mere matter of detail). I looked down for the white spats, and was — disap- pointed. * * * * It was nice to see our own pastoralist back again in Sydney (arrayed in the glorious and pre- vailing mode), here, there, and everywhere, talk- ing, and being talked to, by everybody. He goes to the races to enjoy himself, to see his friends, to admire the horses and — “The ladies,” said I. “Why, of course, the ladies. That goes without saying,” said he. * * * * I think the swallows on Saturday knew all about the coming gale. They flew high up and low down, and swooped and swept along under the eaves, and in and out of the grandstand, and went on in the most violent way, squeaking the whole time. * * * * It is perfectly true that the Parliament House end of Macquarie-street is to be called “Kilkenny Avenue.” * * * * But it is not true that on the night of the division on the next vote of censure all the dance houses in Sydney are to be closed. * * * * Why was I not at Balmain the other night to hear Mr. B. R. Wise discourse on the “Higher Ideal?” I am always on the look out for the higher ideal myself. But, somehow, the exist- ing conditions in Sydney seem unfavorable to its realisation. * * * * In some things I consider myself the most un- fortunate of women. Having heard Mr. Wise speak once, naturally I desire to hear him again. I am always miles away when he is “Up,” and when I arrive he is “Down.” It was just the same with Ranji. Remember? I was always miles away when he was “In,” and when I ar- rived he was “Out.” * * * * “Kidlings blithe and merry.” That’s what it was exactly. All the children in the world were at the Agricultooralliloorel Ground. All the fun in the world. All the games in the world. All the sunshine in the world. Never was such a day for boys and girls. Such laughter — childish laughter — shrill and piercing, filled the air. Children of all ages and sizes. What runs, what tumbles. Children lined the paths and littered the grass. They “rushed,” and stood fourteen deep round the “Pomme de terre frit” stall. Such fried potatoes were never before seen, fished up by the greasy attendant fairly out of the boiling fat; hot, thin, crisp, bright, brown, and beautiful. They worked their way through penny ices till they shivered again, and gobbled lemonade, cake, slices of sausage, pig’s feet, more cake, bread and butter, and bananas, and apples, and peanuts, and oranges, and lollies; and mother, with a big basket, stood ready with more. * * * * You should have seen them round the water tank— nearly, not quite, inside— swarming on top, on the sides, underneath, crawling in the puddle, catching the drops in cups and cans, in their doubled-together hands, and (lying on their backs) open mouths. What shrieks and shoving when Johnny knocked over Jimmy, and all the precious stuff got spilled. * * * * See them in the roundabouts. Hear the organs and the concertinas and the jew’s harps, the drums and the whistles. See the girls hanging in bunches round the doll stalls. Why, there’s the old sawdust- stuffed doll of our babyhood dressed in the smallest piece of paper compatible with propriety— its figure slowly, but surely, decreas- ing in consequence of its stuffing trickling through its toes; and the old Dutch doll in grad- uated sizes, with the practicable arms and legs, with the painted hair parted in the middle, the painted, high-back comb, side curls, shoes and stockings, the red, rosy cheeks and wide-open black eyes, and tin toys and babies’ rattles, and things that squeak, and tin carts that tinkle, and Jack in the box, and the most old-fashioned and delightfully childish toys, bringing back the most old- fashioned and delightfully childish memories. * * * * See them sitting round in hundreds outside the show. “Just er goin’ ter begin.” Bang! bang! bang! “Just er goin’ ter begin. Walk hin, walk hin, walk hin.” Bang! bang! bang! * * * * See them all roll over with frightened howls when the painted “Wild Man of the Wilderness” rushed out among them. * * * * See the man with genial smile and smutty face; the man who boiled the billy — a billy about the size of a small engine boiler. See the same man when the big kettle full of tea fell over, and all the tea and the tea-leaves lay smoking on the grass. Language fails to do justice to the situa- tion — even the language of the man himself, quite as strong as the tea, and nearly as hot, failed to do that. * * * * Well, of course, all these things were only visible to the Peri outside— the Paradise. When the Peri, assisted by certain mundane potentia- lities (who shall be nameless), worked her way into the inner circle, she found herself in fairy- land, surrounded by maypoles and dancers, and a whirl of silver hoops and clubs, bands of music, and thousands (hot hundreds)— thousands of children dancing, marching, running, walking this way and that, dressed in all the colors of the rainbow. * * * * Graceful children, graceful exercises, obedient children, all moving to a certain rhythm; train- ed children, all turning like clockwork, nearly automatic in their unanimity. * * * * Groups of children; lovely-looking, like bou- quets of flowers, like a bed of tulips, like a bed of primroses, like a group of peonies, like a bunch of poppies, white and red and yellow; like a bor- der of violets, like a bank of nodding daffodils, like a field of daisies and buttercups and cow- slips and bluebells; like a hedge of lilies, tall lilies, calla lilies, and low down lilies, lillies of the valley. * * * * And mixed with these were girls in pale green and olive green; girls in pale blue and peacock blue; girls in “ye olde English costume,” girls in sunbonnets as big as themselves, and some carried wands, and some hoops, and some tam- bourines. * * * * When these seven or eight thousand children marched round in different circles (holding their skirts extended, some with the right hand, some with the left)— marched round with military pre- cision to the music of the “Washington Post” — it was a wonderful sight. * * * * And so said everybody, and everybody included his Excellency the Governor and Lady Hampden, the Hon. Miss Brand, the immediate entourage and suite, Major-General and Mrs. French, etc., who were on their arrival received by the Minis- ter for Education, the Hon. J. A. Hogue and Mrs. Hogue, the president, vice- presidents, members of the committee, and the hon. secretary, Mr. H. N. Southwell. * * * * The public appreciation of the Public Schools’ Amateur Athletic Association increases year by year, and, to render unto Ceasar the things that are Caesar’s, the success of this meeting is mainly owing to the personal and unremitting ex- ertions of the hon. secretary and his committee. * * * * Lady Margaret Villiers is going to be married in October to the Hon. Walter Fitzuryan Rice, the only son of Lord Dynevor. * * * * The Hon. Walter is a subaltern in the Carmarthen Artillery Militia. Fancy the trepi- dation of the C.A.M. when the Countess of Jersey goes down to review them — which, of course, she will do. * * * * What a pity Mr. Mark Foy lost the yacht race. His racing is not nearly so big or so certain a thing as his bargains. Never mind, he must, as the old song says, “Try, try again.” I would have liked Irex to win, because, when one goes home and talks of the glories of the White Wings in Sydney Harbor, the ancient and high-estated and aristocratic and amateur mariner observes, “No, really!” in a manner exceedingly aggravat- ing. * * * * Not that yachting in English waters has been this year all beer and skittles. I got a letter from my daughter, dated “Yacht Anaconda, off Southampton, August 10: — “After all, there is not much to tell you about the Cowes week; in fact, it has really been a great failure, though you will probably see in the papers that every- thing is of the rosiest.” * * * * “The weather is simply disgusting, blowing great guns, raining, and dreadfully cold — like the end of October. The racing yachts have had an awful time, smashing up things and crippling their crews. Fancy the weather in the Solent, when a 300 tons yacht gets such ‘a bit of stick’ as her mainmast snapped into three pieces. We have been on the boat a fortnight, and out of that wea- therbound in Portsmouth Harbor five days; couldn’t stop at Cowes at all, not even to see the fireworks. * * * * “Don’t think that Anaconda is only a fair weather boat. Last year we went a splendid cruise down the south, coast, peeped into all the ports, crept up the Dart into the Sir Walter Raleigh country, where tradition says he smoked his first pipe and baked his first potato (in England); then away round to Cornwall, where we landed at a most primitive and unpronounceable place — all flow- ers and strawberries, and went down a tin mine full of Phoenician fairies, and supped on junket and Devonshire cream. It was delightful.” * * * * Why don’t our own Commodore, Mr. Sam Hor- dern, fly his flag in the English waters? * * * * Talking of wind; what price the wind Saturday night. Everything in the world was blown from one end to the other, and back again. The earth seemed to shiver as the terrific force swept over, and shrieks and whistles, and wails and wild howls filled the midnight hours. “The March of the Valkyrie,” wasn’t it? * * * * I jumped out of— I mean I arose from my slum- bers, and notwithstanding the affidavited legend of the ghost of a rat “as big as a kitten,” went out in the corridor (also my bare feet) to see the wind. * * * * See it? Of course. See the remorseless power scatter the big masses of grey vapor into spume, and spectral and frightened shadows, and gather the clouds in one huge grasp and fly shrieking right over the South Head light — right out to sea. * * * * And on the face of the flying sand it seemed to me I could read words, and the words were, “The copper on the starboard bow,” “the garboard strake,” and — But my feet were deadly cold, so I returned from whence I came. * * * * A great turn out at the Mayoress’s reception the other day. A most delightful crush. Such a lot of country visitors— “in for the races,” you know. The Town Hall beautifully decorated — a forest of green — the electric light on, and the music (Needs’s band) excellent. * * * * The Mayor and Mayoress received in a little improvised boudoir at the entrance to the great hall. The Most Worshipful wore his official robes, his chain of office, and his most welcoming and genial manner, also his most ditto smile. * * * * Her Most Worshipful’s gown was lovely — a pale peach blossom chiffon skirt, ap- plique with white Brussels point, leaves and flowers, over a pale peach blossom silk slip, white chiffon vest and ruffles; plain sleeves criss- cro-ss ed with narrow white ribbon, broad sash of peach chiffon; toque of white and peach chiffon and ribbons, tall jewelled aigrette; white gloves, stitched with peach. * * * * Miss Harris, wore a grey canvass, made over and trimmed with pink— so pretty; and little Miss Harris, seated in a huge chair, dressed in cream white soft silk and satin Empire frock down to her tiny toes, looked like “Little Miss Muffit, a Portrait,” by Millais. * * * * Fancy! The refreshments—one could actually make personal acquaintance with those desirable delicacies, instead of, as usual, regarding them from a respectful distance. I got in rather late, and I suppose the rush was over. * * * * The real difficulty this time was the entering of names in the book business. There they stood, four and five deep, hustling and bustling. So warm, too; it played the mischief with the ladies’ little curl, you know. She wore a little curl In the middle of her forrid; When she was nice she was very nice; When she was nasty she was horrid. * * * * Well, the little curl came to no end of grief— the natural ones, I mean (of course, the artificial ones stand a deal of heat, and a deal of other things, without material damage). The poor ladies squeezed and squeezed, and didn’t seem to get much nearer. Dear me, it was warm! * * * * The precious record — the libro d’or — was laid on a table in front of the orchestra. The would-be writers therein stood first at one end, then at the other, then went round to the back, then back again to the front; then stretched across again, this way and that; but the table was too broad and too long, they couldn’t reach; two lots of ladies making frightful dabs at the inkstand, and all writing at once, one lot on one page, another lot on the other. Everybody audibly disgusted with a lady who, having possession, wrote down the names of all the ladies, and the names of all their relations, in her recently elected husband’s electorate. * * * * “What a shame; just like her.” “What can you expect?” “Don’t shove.” “What a dreadful crowd.” “Nice lot, I can tell you.” “Good gra- cious; don’t tear my clothes off.” “There, I knew it.” “Look at my sash; there it goes; miles of it.” “What’s the good of these rotten chiffony rags.” “She’ll want a new pen presently.” “Who’s that?” “Never paid her card money to this day.” “They, do say her jusband won’t let her ‘nibs’ play any more.” “Rubbish; he don’t care so long as she’ lets him.” “For goodness sake, get off my dress.” “One of the new waltz fiends.” “Don’t she thump?” “Now push.” “It’s your turn.” “Disgusting; see that woman pull th’ pen out of my hand?” “Swelled head. Thought he’d be in th’ Ministry.” “Oh, my dear, up to their necks; not a feather to fly with.” “Girls and gambles, and goes to the races, I said to his wife.” “Mind please, you’re tread- ing on my feet.” “Feet, indeed. I call them boats.” “Oh, yes; I did it at last. All of them down— Jim and Tom and Harry and May and Mary Jane and Mary Maria and Aunt Polly, and the Joneses from Mudgee and the Smiths from Forbes, and the Browns from Brisbane, and the Robinsons from Coogee, and the — ” “What! does the woman mean taking up all the book? What next, I wonder?” * * * * “Have you seen mother?” said a well-known Sydney lady. “She promised to sit here until I came to fetch her, and now she’s gone.” “Ah,” said another, “You mustn’t be surprised at that — mothers are so disobedient now-a-days, you know.” * * * * Algernon : — “Aw, ye know, Miss Sweet, there’s no use in our disputing any moah, but I“ll—aw— bet the kisses — he-he— that I’m right.” Miss Sweet : “All right; but I shall claim the privilege of choosing the stakeholder.” * * * * Dr. Tombs (sadly): “My friend, I can An nothing more for you.” Invalid (thoroughly frightened): “Is it as bad as that, doctor?” Dr. Tombs: “Yes, you are practically well, now.” * * * * Mrs. Snow : “My husband has grown very fussy of late, but he was easily pleased when we were married.” Her Friend: “He must have been.” ____________________________________________ Barcelona is now the most populous city of Spain, the result of a census just taken showing 520,000 inhabitants, to Madrid’s 507,000.
