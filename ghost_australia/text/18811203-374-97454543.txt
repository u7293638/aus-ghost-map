He replied by describing a young Irishman whom I -husband of my domestic, who ayear or two before had been executed <on the charge of murder.

Some vfcime afterwards -.he eec claimed t " Hhtre -he>is again, repeating the same wcrfls !" Intensely interested by' "this' sodden and apparently super natural confirmation of iuy suspicions, I determined to put the seenbip -of my guest nto what I regarded as a crucial test. - J told Mr. ft. that shortly afterwards I waagoinginto towa,^and«e I ahonld be paa-iing the spot where the murder was committed perhaps his ghostly visitant might indicate the place here the detyl man lay. Some, time afterwards we started for the town. When we left the houseMr. A., remarked, "Therehe is following up,-" alluding to the "spirit." -When we had proceeded part of the^way : along the road,which was fluite unknown 'to myfriend, I made -a detour to make a £ business call u9 ; neat along andther • street, Mr. A. fdUowing me. Just as, without a word on my part, we were turn ing out of tie main road, Mr. A. said, " The spirit is standing at the corner. Hb says. we are not gorn^ the right*way towards the plaice, where the murder -was 'Committed, and which he has proaused to I polntoutto me." I replied, " Oh, we shall come out in the main road again by and-bye before we-reach; the <fpot" We firnnwdod on about>a <qusrter <of a mile, «nd'btfiog4oBe mj -business and struck rthe amin -road again—which differed, I tmay "remark, ffnem none of the other roads *we have ttraversed—Mr. jL soon after ^declared, ".There is that man just on ctheta, waiting for us." As we continued •oar -walk, I purposely refrained from wttexing a word, or even from thinking, as far as I oould, about the murder, so as to prevent any possibility of my companion obtaining any clue. As we were priming through one of the lowest parts of the town Mr. A* suddenly exclaimed11 He trill me that it was here the murder was committed.. It was - just there (punting to the place in the road where the mur dered nan fell). I see the hubbub and ■wnfnnon rise up before me as a picture, ^ith the people round. He, however, again tells me that he did not strike the ffatrilUow. He does not excuse himself fram being morally guilty as bong mixed up with those who accomplished the <*«»)>*•*» of the man, but strongly mMwfcyn^ he waa not the murderer.*' I will only add in relation to the last incident that Mr. A. described the exact spot when the • murder was committed, and tha circum atanoes in connection therewith. How can yon account for that? Mr. A. had never been in^ the town before; he had never lived within a. couple of miles of it; he did not know till within a day or two before he arrived that he would ever visit it; he could not by any possibility have known that the poor WOUUUl In my employ was the widow of a man who wag hanged. He had no con ceivable interest in deceiving me, nor was lie concerned to prosecute the matter any j further. Ihave in vain attempted to ac count for his stoty, nor can I, on any of | the popular hypotheses, explain to my < . own satisfaction how he saw that ghost at i noonday. That he did see it he assured ' me, mueh to my surprise, when no one i a^ected any auch revelation ; and, what ever he saw, it certainly led him to the exact place where the murder was com mitted.
