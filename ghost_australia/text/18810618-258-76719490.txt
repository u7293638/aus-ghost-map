.Yfmr SATURDAY, JTJNE 18, 1881. \- HE Divisional Board''have adopted litre in Ire-' tbi liability to rating of crashing aaadbi*' r.erj to In pU f?r.g the qMttfipn -.oareshotrld betafcen ? iiaiiliejrlide matter should be included in it, not on^rr ci Qshing planton, or i mmedia'e connection with, a claim raiding the exemption of which from rasing there can be no douJit-^bnt cribbing plaht standing apart from - jail mines, as the Mary Louisa, dio Defiance, '"® "Venns, - the Fair {Rosamond and the also pyrites works ~hicharc 'altogether or chiefly engaged -I iTtEe t^atoen^ftailings. The ad rice cf the |ao ^-tsjx |all machinery and leave the settlement of the question the law conrts /was not very sensible. it "would involve bdth the owneraof machinery and the Board itself ia heavy Inw expenses, besides oreatingwidespread cusjatisEaotion and irritation. . Some pferubets of the Board, in discussing the v iT istion, displayed remarkable ignorance oi the Bnglish langnage. The clause "In !?;& Act excepting "all machinery " from ruting they interpreted as including ma ^.uery for rating, just the very contrary i waning. According to the Divisiona B'-.ard Act, whicb,in this particular, is a naere transcript of the Local Govern ment Act, " the surface -ofland and Gildings erected thereon " for mining p . poses are liable to rating, bat" ill KiMfilg &nd; other things beneath the »urame of the land, and all roaehi : -jessarily used for the .purpose .corking tiie mine" are not liable rsting. It most be admitted by all thlat d ialling the quarts so as to extract tie ijold is essential for w working the mine." J iose words cannot be tak$n to mean rjlely Binking jghftfta, puttingin drives, jootiog .stone down and baulipg it to he; sorface. All those operations ape Tierepartsin the " working " of a mine. They ara' primaiy and essential opetia . fions; bat 8Upplementing and completing th empire the furtherprocesses . the. Gtis^ and conclusive of treatment by. pyritous works. Tt «jiL pcatajto as that it matters nothing where tiie laaebiEQry is placed, whether on the m ine Itself . and connected wi'h the hauling apparatus -or miles away froiii «ny; mine. Once it is admitted-that crushing machinery is " necessa rily qec d f:T the parpo.se of working the mine" it follows that, the machinery may be i t usiy distance from the mine. Theargn "nient - is. quite jut st'iong^ for pyritoi;s v.orks as for simple crushing plan'.. Ftone from the, Identity may be crushei »t. theMary Louisa." It may be objected t'lafc a mill six miles distant could-nojt hp "necessarily uBed" jrhen tbf Faif l{osamond and die One-and-All weri within a stone's throw. This is a puerile objection and scarcely deserves | j-«*ply. The word " necessarily " in th^ Act refers to agency and means, not to place or looality. The A at clearly exj enipts certain things from rating, and no one has a right to include anything fi p rating purposes unless it is clearly lai'j down in the Act. Now, all that the Act" specifies - as liable to-rating is. " tiie surface of the land and buildings erected tliereon," Here the general- principles which apply to all business premises ai.d the tools of trafle come in, and we gee no the ghost of, an ar^utnen-t for taxing m-i c..inery of any kind, either for minins oi for any other purpose, The argijuienj brought forward by Mr. Bockland itj conclusive, ; He^aul it would be as just to tax the^ printing machinery in tin NORTHERS Miker office as to tax crush ing machinery. Ju ^tfc ^cases the qix chineiy was fot'trude pnri'Oses. The Act says nobbing about the contents: of a | building ; , eon tain wheat o\i' potatoes, orliajicing bears a id cocka}x>os j I or spinning Jennies, machines for making! teeth or too th^b^ti 6liH>,- flannelfiliirts or cotton urawers, «., finallt, tor extracti; d I - ". .

We have several saw-mille on the field There is no law for taxing the .machinery .ised in. them. The buildings and the ground: they stand on only are liable to rating. After looking over the Act carefully, and considering the whole question, we comc to the conclusion > that no machinery of any description, whether -used for mining, or printing, or sawing, or »ny other purpose, is liable to be rated under the Divisional Board or Local Go vernment -pis. We do not consider any opinion fivm the Attorney General.neces sary. The questions -to be t>obiuitt«d to him should be general-^First,. Is any thing besides lands and buildings rate" able ? and, second, Is machinery of any kind rateable? We think the answer will be No in both cases.

It was rejected by the judges, bnt, in our opinion, it ie entitled to the prise for its originality. It has introduced a new word in mining which was veiy much re. quired-^ * Hackee." Jt is a mast suggestive word-the soothing, drowsy, narcotic effects of the " weed, and the "Blowing" of. cloudg about rich specimens, and all that.

THE business at the Divisional Board is not : conducted in a very orderly manner, and with ; «.at order there can be no proper work d.«e. is 110 lM«iness~ sheet, no warrant of ' accounts. The discussions are carried ou loosely and without aay regard to the rules of delate.

Mr. O'Dancell moved tfat; £ aid into o mmittec of. the .whole to con gidtr a matter of which no notice had beeu givi-n. That gave no power to the Board to consider it or to take action on it. The proper way to proceed would be to move for the suspension of tbe standing orders which is pro" vided for, by rufe 13 chapter 4 of the by-laws' If the " emergency case" was made out by j Mr. O'DonnelL, and the board approved, they J c-uU g.» into committee and deal with the matter of i riprove^i.euts to the streets.
