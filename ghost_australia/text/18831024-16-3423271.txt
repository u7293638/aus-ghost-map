DONAL GRANTS BY GEORGE MACDONALD. Author of " Alec Forbes," " Malcolm," c, c. CHAPTER XXVI. THINGS went on for awhile, but nothing new occurred Donal seldom met Lady Aietuiv, and when he did he received from her no on couragement to address her But he could not help thinking the troubled look had begun to re-appear on her face, while in her smile, as they would pass in hall or corridor, "'commited, he thought, an expression almost pathetic something almost like an appeal, as it she found herself in need of his help, but was not able to ask him for it 496 now she iv is again, and more than ever, in the company of Miss Carmichael Donal 1 new tins, and so find good cause to fear that the phantasm of her would be (direct ness was coming down in upon her, not like men on the mown LI tss, but luce snow on the spring flow tie The impossibility of piecing the lot is of an edition of any vital part, so pachyderm items are they-so utterly incapable of admitting any argument of a, spiritual nature is a sore trial to the old Adam still unslain in lovers of the Truth At the same time to discipline is more potent in giving patience opportunity for working her perfect work But it is well such people cannot be reached by argument, and superseded of the truth of these things, for so they would but enter the circles of the faithful to work fresh schisms and bleed fresh uuposthuraes But Donnl had begun to think that perhaps he had been too forbearing toward us the hideous doctrines advocated by Miss Carmichael It is one thing where evil doctrines are quietly held, and the truth that is associated with them turned into the food of life by good people doing their best with what has been taught them, and quite another thing where they are forced upon some sin inking nature against all its most sacred instincts-some nature tendered weak to resist by the city reverence in which it excels JL'he inner nature, from very inability to think of another as less pure in intent than itself, is at a great disnd vantage in the bands of the coarser He made up his mind that, risk as it was to enter into disputation with any worshipper of the letter, seeing that for purposes of argument the letter is so much more manageable than the spirit which while it lies in the letter in perceived has no force-the letter worshipper being incapable of seeing that no utterance of God could posal bl j mom what he makes out of it-he resolved, I say, notwithstanding this consideration, to hold himself a ready, and if anything was given him, to -cry aloud and not spare Nor had he long resolved ere the opportunity came. for a place so much unsought as I have represented the old as ernie, a rather large proportion of the incidents of my narrative there occurred it was in a great measure because of its desertion that Donal frequented it, and it was with intent, and in the pride of her confidence in her own acquaintance with Scripture, and in her power to use it, that Miss Carmichael on the occasion led her lately unwilling, rather recusant, and very unhappy disciple hitherward, in the hope, because of what she had been reporting concealing his words, of an encounter with him back attacks upon the old established faith must be met, and such an obnoxious influence ft us trated It was, bright autumn day The trees had been so ely revealed, but some foliage hung yetin thinjellow clouds upon then outspread patient boughs There was plenty of what Davis called suwldin-tint is, making a noise with the feet amongst the thick lying rather ed leaves But less foliage means more sunlight Donal TV as walking along"', his book in his hand, now and then leading a little, and now and then looking up to the half baled bt arches crossing and mingling so inextricably over his head, now and then, like Davie, sweeping a cloud of the fallen multitude before him He was in this childish act when, looking up, he saw the two ladies approaching a few aids in of rent But he did not see the peculiar look Miss Carmichael threw her companion-" Behold your prophet 1" it said He would have passed with a lifted bonnet, but Miss Cot each fell stopped with a smile which was bright because it showed her good teeth, but was not pleasant because it showed nothing else "Glorying over the fallen, Mr. Grant ' she said Donal in his turn smiled "That is scarcely Mr Grant's way," said Arctura-"so far, at least, as I 11 are known him "Poor children ' said Miss Carmichael, feeling or affecting a sympathy with the fallen leaves, and looking down on them compassion lately "Pardon mc," saul Donal, "if I guide them your pity, it seems to mc misplaced There is nothing more of children in those leaf is than there is in the hand that falls on the bar but a door. "I don't think it very gracious to pull a lady up so shall ply," returned Miss Our michael "I spoke poetically " "There is no poetry in what is not true," are joined Donal. ' These are not the children of the is so " Of course' I know that," she answered, with properly model rated sworn at being now understood, " a tree has no children, but-" "A thee no children ' ' repeated Donal "What then are all those beech nuts among the fallen leaves They are the children on of the tree ' ' 'Lost like the leaves!' signed Miss di michael, willing to shift her go out "Why do you say they are lost ' They must fulfil the end for which they were made, and if so "What end societies made for '" "I do not know , but who can tell what they do for the ground ' One thing we know that, if they were all to grow up beech trees, they would be a good deal in the way " "Then you mean there are more seeds than are required ' "N.O, surely, for I do not know what is required of them 01 how necessary it may be for the true life of the tice to produce them all" "But you must allow that some things are lost 1 said Miss Carmichael "Yes surely'' answered Donal; "why else should He have to come and look for them till He find them This was hardly such an answer as the theologians had expected, and she was not immediately ready with her rejoinder "But some of them are lost after all' she said "Doubtless," replied Donal, some of His sheep um away again But He goes after them again " "Does He always' " Yes I do not believe it " "Then you do not believe that God is infinite ' ' " Yes, I do " "How can you' is not the Lord God merciful and gracious ' "I am glad you know that " " But if His love) and His graciousness are not minute, then He is not infinite " "there are other attributes in which no is infinite " But He is not infinite in them all He is not infinite in those which are the most beautiful, the most tin in, the man Christ like ' Just in those He is measurable, bounded, not infinite ' ' "I do not care for human argument I go by the word of God " " Let me hear, then " New it had so fallen that the two ladies were talking about the doctrine of adoption when they came up to Donal and so this was the first thing to occur to the champion of orthodoxy "'There is the doctrine of adoption," she said, "one of the most precious, if one may say so, in the whole Bible, does not that each teach us that God choose.) to make some His children and not others' He adopts some, and leaves the others out If you say that then He is not infinite in mercy, when the Bible says he is, you are guilty of blasphemy " But if Miss Car michael was a little astonished at what she accounted, after her own reasoning, a denial of the infinitude of i God's mere), where Donal was only denying that to be infinite which she called infinite, and so asserting; the leal infinitude, she was very much astonished at what he said next In a tone calm even to solemnity he said "God's mercy is infinite, it of the doctrine of adoption is one of the falsest of all the doctrines invented, in its own bitter lack of the sun it whereby wor) Abba, J other, by the so called Church, and used by yet less loving teachers to oppress withal the souls of God's true children, and name them from their 1 other's arms " "I hate sentiment 1 ' said Miss Car michael almost fiercely "You shall have none," returned Donal " 1 ell me what is meant by adoption '' "The taking of children," said Miss Carmichael, who was sharp enough already to see a rock ahead, and treating them as your own " " Whose children ' ' asked Donal 3 The sole right of publication in Queensland of "Donal Grant has been purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company, Limited. " Anyone's " " Whose, I ask," repeated Donal, " are the children whom God adopts ' ' Here was the rock. Her bark was upon it, and Miss Carmichael was a little staggered But she pulled up courage and said the children of Satan "But if Sum mule them, how are they to be blamed for doing the deeds of their father ' "You know very well what I mean Satan did not make them God made them, but they have sinned and fallen " then did God repudiate them ' ' "Well yes And they became the children of another "west, of Satan, us I said " "thin first, God disowns his children, and their when they are the children of another makes them his own again by adoption ' Is that like a father ' Because his children do not please him, he repudiates than altogether till another takes them up, and then he wants them again-not, however, as his own, but as the children of the other i coming to be adopted to be his! The old Petitioner then origin has no longer any force, my Equity, with thin Any own father J ' "Lives you dare not surely say that the wicked mc the cluliAenof God just the same as the good " That be far from me! Those who do the will of God are ten times more his children than those who do not, they are born then of the highest part of the divine nature, of the nature of Jesus Christ, which is obedience But, if they were not in the last place and in the most profound fact the children of God they could no ci become his children in that higher, yea highest, sense by tiny station of adoption Do you think if the devil could create, his children could ever become the children of God' But you and I, and the most wretched self loved ever been, are all the children of God to begin with that is what makes all the misery and all the hope Hence we must become his children in heart and soul, or be for ever wretched If we ceased to be his, if the relations between us were destroyed, which is impossible, then there would be no redemption possible, for there would be nothing left to redeem ' ' You may reason as you please, Ali Giant, but while Paul teaches the doctrine I will hold it He may perhaps know a little better than you ' "St Paul teaches no such doctrine He teaches just what I have been saying The word is Used for adoption, but the original of it is a placing in the position of a son, and he applies it to the raising of one who is a son to the true position of a son " "It seems to me morepicsumptuous in you than I can say to take on you to determine what the apostle meant " "Why, Miss Car michael, do you think the gospel comes to us us to a set of fools ' Is there any way of receiving a message other than by first understanding the message' I am bound by the express command of the Master to understand the things he says to me He commands me to see then attitude, because, they being of us, I ought to be able to see them there In that hope I read my Greek Testament everyday But it is not necessary to know Greek to see what St. Paul means by adoption You have only to consider his words with intent to find out his meaning-not to find in them the teaching of this or that Community In the epistle to the Galatians, whose child floes lue speak of as adopted It is the father s own child, his heir, who differs nothing from a slave until he enters upon his true relation to his father-the full condition of a son So also in another passage by the same word he means the redemption of the body out passing into the higher condition of outward things fit for the sons and daughters of God-becoming such as all the grandeur and glory of the revelation completed even outward dly-the heaven!) condition of things as differing"' from the cal till then we are no more Ula aliens, but like what we are the children of the house Any use of a single word St Paul says to oppress a human heart with the feeling that it is not my birth, making, origin, of whatever word of closer the sum, can be found, the child of God comes of the devil, the father of evil, and not either of St. Paul or of Christ Why, my lad), Donal w cut on turning to Victoria, all the cities in this that he is our father and we are not His children To fulfil the very necessities of our being we must be His children in plain and heart in body and soul and spirit in obedience and hope and gladness and love-his out and out beyond all that tongue can say mind think 01 heart desire Died only is the creation fulfilled- then only shall we be what we were made for, and under capable of and what we are troubled on all sides that we may become He ceased Allis Carmichael was astonished and intellectually cowed but her heart was nowise concerned She had never had that long ing after closest her union with God which sends us feeling after the Father But, taking tom age under the overshadowing of the wing of the divine, Al retina spoke "I hope what you say is time Mr Grant ' ' she sighed " Oh yes, hope ' we all hope ' But it is the word we li i e to do with, not hope," said Miss Carmichael ' I have given you the fine word," said Donal But as if she heard neither of them, Arcttua went on "If it were but tine,' she almost moaned, ' it would set light ever thing on the face of the earth ' "You mean far more than that, my lady !' said Donal "You mean everything in the human heart, which will to all eternity keep moaning and crying out for the Dithol until it is in very truth one with its own request, only real relation in the universe or in the scope of the divine imagination itself, which is creations original and potent All other relations whatever he but the outcome and necessity) from the all embracing relation to Him " Judging his work to be over, Donal hero lifted his bonnet, and would have passed on "One would, Mr Grant,' said Miss Carmichael Donal stopped " It is but an to warn you,' she said, " that no man holding such doctrines can honestly desire to become a clergyman of the Church of Scotland " ' the worse for the Church of Scotland!' said Donal, laughing, ' but, as I do not desire to hold relation with to any other Church except that of love to every member of the one only real Church, you need have no anxiety lest I should use its status quo for the spread of the ti nth-far the truth of God that which I have spoken I believe with my whole soul to be " '"thank you from my heart, Mr Grant" said Lady Aictuia, as again he took his leave of them When he was gone, the ladies resumed then walk in silence At length Miss Car michael spoke and thus "Well, I must say, of all the conceited young men I have had the misfortune to meet, you Mr Grant is the list in self-assurance and forwardness " " Are you sure, Sophia," rejoined Arcturi, that it is self assurance, and not conviction of the truth of what he has to say, that gives him the courage to speak as he does ' ' " How can it be when it is not true '-w then it goes against all that has for ages been taught and believed " What if God should now be sending ft cash light into the minds of His people ' ' "The old is good enough for me ' "But it may not be good enough for God ' What if Air Grant should be His messenger to us " A likely thing, indeed ' A mere student from the north, now from the college ' ' " No matter ! I cannot help-a profound hope that he may be in the right after all Was not that the way they spoke in the old time, when they said Can any good thing come out of Galilee " Ah, I see the influence has gone further with you than I had hoped ! You are infected not met ii) with his doctrine but with his frightful irrev rence To dare the comparison of that poor creature with Jesus Christ ' ' 4 If he were a messenger of Jesus Christ," said Aictura, quietly I neither say he is or he is not-but the reception you now give him would be precisely what he would expect, for the Lord said the disciple should be is his Master The words entered and stung Miss Carmichael stopped short, her face in a flame, but her iron ties were cold and hard 441 am sure," she said, "one friendship should come to so abrupt t conclusion Lady Aictura, but it is time it should end when you can speak so to me, who have for so many years done my best to help ) on I If that is the first result of your new gospel well Remember who said, If an angel) from heaven preach any other gospel to you than I have preached, let him be accursed '"' She turned back to go again down the avenue. 4 Oh, Sophia do not leave me so," cried Lady Arctnra But Sophia was already yards away, her skirt making a small whirlwind that went following her among the wither ed leaves Arctura burst into tears, and sat down at the foot of one of the great beeches Miss Car michael never looked behind her, but went straight home She met Donal again in the avenue, for he, too, had turned Once more he uncovered his head, but she took no notice of him she had done with him probably to all eternity' Those hot i ible new views Her poor Arctura ' Donal was walking quietly back with his book, on which, however, he now looked more than he read, it lying with but partial success to dismiss the thought of what had occurred, when a little fluffy fringe of one of pool Lady Aictuias sobs reached his eat He looked up, and saw her sitting like one dejected, weeping He could not pass and leave her thus ' But he soon reached her shows), that she might have time to get over the worst of her passion She 1 card his step in the gath" ed leaves, glanced up, SAw who it was, buried her face for one moment in her hands then set ght her handkerchief raised her head and a nose with a feeble attempt at a smile Donal saw and understood the smile she would not have him feel any compunction as the cause of w hat had taken place 44 Mr Grant,' she said, coming to aids him, 44 St Paul said that, should an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than his, he was accursed 'Let him be accursed,' he said Even in angel from heaven you see, Mr Grant' It is tremble!' 44ft is tremble, and 1st) amen to it with all my heart, ' replied Don't 4 But the gospel you have received is not the gospel of Pull, but one substituted for it-by no angel from heavy on, neither with any design of substitution, but by men with hidebound souls, who, in order to get them into their own intellectual poel e's, melted down the gold of the kingdom and recast it in the moulds of an etched legal thought, learned of the Romans who crucified then Master Grand childlike heavenly things they would explain by vulgar wor Idly notions of law and light! But the by meant well, seeking to justify the ways of God to men therefore the cause of the apostle does not fall, I think, upon them they sought a way out of their difficulties, and thought they had found one, when in reality it was their faith that carried them over the top of the enclosing walls But gladly would I see dis comhted such as taking then inventions at the hundredth hand, and moved by none of the fervor of those who first promulgated the doe times, lay them as the void and will of God -lumps of non and heaps of dust upon the live, boating, longing hearts that cry out after then God-v amshed afresh in the clouds these have raised around the Master, the express image of the Father s person " - 44 Oh, I do hope what you say is true I ' panted Aictura ' I think I shall die if I find it is not " You can find nothing but what the Lord teaches you If you find what I tell you untrue, it will be in not being enough-in not being gland and face and bounteous enough To think anything too good to be true is to deny God to "ay the tints no is better than the true-to commit the sin against the Holy Ghost It will be something better and better, love her and lovelier, that Christ will teach you Only you must leave human teachers altogether, and give one self to him to be taught If there is any truth in these thing, then Christ is in the world now as then, and within our call " 441 will try to do as you tell me," said Arctuia, holding out her hand "If there is anything that troubles you said Dora, as he took it. "I shall be most glad to try and help you, but it is better there should not be much talk The thing lies between you and the living light With these words he left her Arctura followed slowly to the house, and went straight to her own 100m, her mind filling as she went with slow deriving strength and a great hope No doubt there came some of her belief in the departure of her incubus friend, but that would have soon vanished in fresh sorrow but for the hope and strength to which this departure yielded the room to spring up in her heart B) the time she saw her again she trusted she would be more funny grounded 111 her ideas concerning many things, and would be able to set them forth at night She was not yet free of the notion that you must be able to argue in defence of your convictions that you are hardly at liberty to say you believe 1 thing so long as anyone is able to bring up an argument against it which you only see and cannot show to be false Alas for us if our beliefs went no further than experienced loses, on an embracing understanding sion of the beliefs themselves could justify them 1 Alas for our beliefs, if they are not what we shale oil live on extensions aspirations, our hopes, out acceptances by!
