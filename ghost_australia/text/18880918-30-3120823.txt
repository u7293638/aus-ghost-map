DEATH OF A FAMOUS FORTUNE- TELLER. A once famous and even fashionable for ' tune teller, Mother Moree, has lately died in Paris. She attained the height of notoriety in the days of the Empire, when she was consulted not only by the records but also by the cacoethes, as, the society beauties of the time were called. Her rooms were usually thronged in the afternoon, whether fashionable customers came to have their fortunes told, or rather to consult her in their affairs of commingled business and pleasure. Madame Moree was a skilful oarsman- cayenne, and her masterly manipulation, of the cards must have enabled her to realise a considerable income. Just as in ordinary prosaic professional life, Madame Moreen bad formally taken over the premises and practice of an equally prophetic predecessor, Madame Leuormand, who, in her day was a veritable Witch of Endor, and even preceded modern, spiritualists in evoking phantoms from the vasty depths of the nether regions, or in enabling customers to have comfortable and profitable talks with the ghosts of their grandmothers. The deceased cartomancienne, who did not profess to dabble in the " Black Art" like her notorious predecessor, and, confined herself strictly to the cards, died in her seventy-first year.
