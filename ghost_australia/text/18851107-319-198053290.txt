' THE RACING. By tho timo tho bell rang for tho horses to saddle up for tbo Railway Stakes, tho first rsco of tho day, tho crowd had increased to suoh nn extent thnt locomotion in the paddock was so difficult that' it was almost impossiklo to see the horses. However, as scratchings had reduced the field to five runners, it was not long before visitors wore enabled to see the whole of the starters. Isonomy, both from his previous performance iu tho Derby and commanding appearance, was quito a king in the crowd, and htB' victory was regarded as next thing to n cer tainty, I'nrwan, who ran third for tho Caul- field Guineas, was the only horso sup posed to bo capable of clipping his wings, and ho had a few friends, First Prince wns notoriously short of work, nnd Perchance, a handsome son of Gang Forward and the im ported mnro Pcradrenturo, will require more time before he is fully developed. In the bet ting market Isouomy was regarded as such a good thing that tho fielders would not ac cept less than 5 to 2, whilo tho quo tations about tho others wore merely nominal, First Prince being the only other one backed. The race needs little description, as the favorite tvith Baron Nccknr nmdo the run ning to tho homo turn, when tho former drew away, and, without ever being extended, won by two lengths from First Prince, who came very fast at tbo finish and beat Baron Neckar for second honors by a - head. Tho timo " was oxcellent, and though the 6tato of tbo course was conducive to record breaking the performance of the winner justi fied the support accorded to tho colt by his South Australian friends for the Derby. There were half a dozen starters for tho Kensington Stakes, for two-year-olds, and, ns tho'only per formers of merit included in the lot wore Maddclinn and The Nun, tho punters were not long In selecting the former ns the best thing iu. In faot, so pronounced were backers in her favor that odds of 6 to 4 on were freely laid, and The Nun was next in demand at 5 to 2 against, tho others boiug comparatively neglected. No mistako was made in tho selections, as Mad- delinn shot out bolow tho distnuce, and, though the Nun rnado a vigorous effort a hundred yards from homo, sho had no chance what-, ever with tho Adelaide Ally, who won' without ever being extended, by a couplo of . lengths, , while Telephone, tho third favorite, was an indifferent third. Ac cording to tho conditions of the race the winner had to bo'sold for 300 guineas, and, after some smart competition, she was secured by Mr. W. A. .Long for £620, of which £320 went to tho olub. Tho filly has on several occasions shown! brilliant form, and was purchased very oheaply, the timo she ran the fivo fur longs in boing sufficient evidcnco of her possessing a great turn of speed. Withdrawals for the Hurdle Raco reduced the field to ten runners nnd on her performance in tho Weight for Age Hurdlo Raco on Saturday against Tho Agent, Gaenlier was very justly made the. first favorite at tho outset, hut a strong com mission coming into tbo market in favor of Tho Brigand at "the last moment ho left off first favorito at 5 to 2, n prico that had plenty of takers. Agitation and Ravensworth both had followers at 6 to 1 each, but none of tho others wore supported with any spirit,- tho frionds of tho winner, Ruby, being doubtful of her ability to get the distance. Mistake mado the .running for two-thirds of the journey, when Brigand shot to tho front, and appeared all ovor a winner half a mile from home; but he suddenly dropped back, and Ruby aud Ravens- worth were left to fight it out, with the result that the former, aided by her light weight, drew away, after crossing the last hurdle,, and won with daso by half a dozen lengths. Dura tion, who had been backed to win a good stake, extinguished his, chaiico by. falling near the abattoirs, and Brigand broke', down "bo badly that it i3 doubtful whether ho will ever race ngnin. . . The Hurdlo Raco was all over, and tlio horses had weighed in at a few. minutes after throo o'clock,' aiid there intervened nearly nn hour in whioh to inspect the candidates for the Oup, but.this wbb a matter of somo dif ficulty in consequcnco of the crowd being so donse in the paddock. Nevor before iu tho his tory of tho Melbourne Gup havo so many pooplo been anxious to obtain a peep nt tho favorites, and it was diffioult to eocuro. more thnn a cursory vlo,w of each as they were snddlcd. Amongst tho'favoritos was Despot, who looked healthy In his coat, but did not nppcar to havo dona sufficient work to' enable hint to get to tbo ond ot.n fast run two 'miles, and Lord Wilton, who succeeded, was, with Tom Brown, bigondnbovo himself. Prometheus was nlso on tbo stout side, his infirmity having evidently prcvonted his trainsr giving him enough work, but First Chester wns bright and. blooming, hnving apparently beon benefitted by his gallop on Saturday. Arsenal did not not look to be nearly fit, and Lord Exoter, Cyclops, Blink Bonny, Boswortli, Wnrwiok nnd Thunderbolt appeared a bit on tho stout side. No fitter animals were in tho paddock than Grace Darling, Nordonfoldt and Wing ; nnd Kit Nubbles, Trenton, CeriBo nnd Blue, Brown nnd Rose, Metal and St. John looked fairly well. Tlio wfn- uor, Sheet Anchor, had ovidently dono a great preparation, and ho walked about as quiet ae a sheep, but iu consequcnco of tho rumors as to his having boon badly lieaton in a trial with Britisher ho nttraeted little attention from any but his immediate followers. Trenton's flno shape and commanding nppenranco wcro pass ports to the good opinion of thoso capable of judging, and, though 6omcdoubt« wore expressed | as to his condition being good enough to 'bring him liomo, it wns generally conceded I that if bo wore really well ho ought to win — ilv. After tbo paddling tbo horses, in stead of going on tlio courso by the gnto near tho rivor, went through the land from tbs weighing stand to tho judgo's box, tbo f. it to appear being Lord Wilton, who was followed in rapid succession by Despot, Nordon foldt, Oraco Darling, First Chester, Britishor, Cyclops. Wing, Acolyto, St Lawrence. Kit Nub bles, olTerpool, Brown nnd Roso, Yellow Ham mer, uject Anohor, Dunlop Volocipedo nnd St. John, tho InBt one out boiug Cerise nud Blue. Nothing went better in tho preliminary canters thnii Graco Darling, Wing, Tronton, First Chester, Liverpool, Britisher, St. John, Brown and Roso nnd Minerva, but Acolyte wns soro, and Kit Nubbles, Dunlop. .Volocipedo. nud Plausible went in anything but a takingistyle. Sheot Anchor only cantered slowly past tho judge's box, but bo went with ' grant determination, and O'Brien wore a confident look as ho trotted down to the winning post. In tho market Nordcnfcldt retained the prido of placo, 5 to 1 boing tho best offer, and 'i'ronton was a decided second favorito at? to lv Dos- Sot was at tens, as was Liverpool and Kit ubbies. Storunway. Grace Darling, Sheet Anohor, Acolyto and Brown nnd. Roso were next in demand. Whilo varying prices down to 200 to 1 Yellow Hnmmor, which wns Inid wore on offer about ton others. Mr. G. Wntson, who' again officiated ns startdf in his host stylo, marshalled tho field at tlio post punc tually to timo, nud after two slight breaks nwny ho lowered his flag to tv beautiful start, nnd Prometheus, Thunderbolt, First Chester, Nor donfoldt and Tronton led pretty closo to gether past, the 'stand.' Tlio flvo' nam'Od com prised the leading division nlong tho back nnd Thunderbolt had au advantage to the abattoirs, where Cerlso nnd Blue took up tlio rnnning, and, coming to the straight', appeared to linvo all tho others in trouble. Horo 'Britisher shot out, nnd ho in his turn looked like -winning until ho suddenly collapsed, and then his stable companion, Sheet Anohor, canto with a rush, and established himself dt tho head of affairs. Graco Darling, who was one . of tho ' two last past tho stand the first timo round, but who had tnado up her ground in the most ex traordinary manner, then tried to get up on tho inside, but being twico disappointed, lost a considorablo amount of ground. The mare, however, struggled on with tho utmost garne- noss, and, though she could not quite got to Sheet Anchor's head, was only defeated by scarcely a neck, while Trenton was a head away third. . Such a finish natu rally excited tlio greatest enthusiasm, and O'Brien, who had won his first Melbourne Cup, was heartily applauded ns lio returned to sonic. Graco Darling ran a groat mnro under difficulties, as sho was shut 'in twice, and must havo won with a littlo luok, whilo Nordenfeldt's periormanoo was quite cqital to his previous victories. Tronton also firovod tho correctness of his running n tho Melbourne Stakos, but Tom Brown. Acolyto, Kit Nubblos, Livorpool, Plausible, Stornaway,' Dospot, Brown nnd Rose, Warwick and other favoritos were never dangerous. Tho now judge, who. previous to tbo Cup had mitdo one or two mis takes, hoi6tc'd Blink Bonny, who was not amongst the first dozen, as the second horse for that cvont, nnt| . tlio crowd "ngnin recog nised his incapacity by derisive cheers. After putting up tho wrong horses ns winner of the Derby, nnd second in tho Cup, not to' speak of other mistakes, it is not too .much, to say that Mr. Wnkely has proved his 'incompetency, and tlio sooner ' a change is made tbo better it will be lor tjjo club and tho more satisfactory to horso owners. Tho winner of tho Oup has proved himself to bo a sterling good horse, as ho lia9 run third for the Newmarket Handicap, second for the Australian Oup and first in tho Mel bourne Cup, nil under decent weights, nnd his performances stamp him ns ono of tho best of thb many good Tasmnnian horses which havo performed in Victoria. By his victory liis party throw in for a good stnko, but tho ringmcn got well round with thoir hooks, and the balanco ovor the raco will bo against tho general publio. After the excitement ovor tho great race bad subsided to somo extent, twenty youngsters weigliod out for the Nursery Handi cap, and Yellow Jacket was installed as first favorite. Tho good thing camo off, as tho colt ' was in front all ' tho way, and oventually won . by a couplo of lengths from .Kotbrt, Clolia and tho othars. Backers were also iu tho "swim" in tlio suc ceeding raco, tho Yan Yean Stakes, when they backed Merrimu down to 2 to 1, nnd de spite tho opposition offered by a largo field, tho sou of Argus, Scandal, camo through nt tho ilistanco, aud won a fine race from Chuckstor by a bend, nt lonst so it was returnod by tho judge, though to other observers it looked mora like half a length.
