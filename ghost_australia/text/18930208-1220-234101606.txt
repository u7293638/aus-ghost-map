a legend of mont 1'ilatus. There are many legends connected with this moun tain. One — and, of course, it is only a legend— tells how, after our Lord was crucified, Pontius Pilate, having in some way offended the Emperor Tiberius, was summoned to Rome to answer for his offence. In order, however, to withstand the wrath of the Em peror, Pilate had recourse to an amulet, and if. is said that on every occasion when he came into the pre sence of the Emperor tbe wrath of Tiberius disappeared. At length, however, his enemies suspected that lie possessed some charm con cealed about his person, and it is said that they dis covered beneath his toga (tho ordinary garment of the Romans) the robe of Christ. He was at once deprived of the sacred garment, and taken beforet.be Emperor, who condemned him to death. His body was flung into the River Tiber, but violent storms arose, so the frightened inhabitants determined to banish him to the lonely heights of Mont Pilatus, where his body was cast into a black sluggish tarn or lake. From this time the mountain and iake, accord ing to the legend, became .haunted, and violent storms constant!' took place. One day a student happened to arrive at Lucerne, and hearing the strange tales of tbe mountain, and on being promised a heap of gold, agreed to climb tbe haunted moun tain and make terms with the supposed ghost of Pilate. It is said that, after a deal of .bargaining, thespirit of Pilate leaped into the lake, having first , entered into a solemn treaty that he would only re appear on Good Friday, unless stones were thrown into tho lake, or in the event of disrespectful words being spoken of him in its neighbourhood, in which case the usual penalty of thunder, lightning, and terrific storms would ensue.
