The pltn, along with other valuable doenments, wu burnt in tbe fire which destroyed Colonel Light's residence on tbe Park Lands, but it was iu existence so late as 1839.' In reply, I beg re spectfully to refer to records In tne Register, as well as in the land Office, showipg that Colonel Light's residence on the Pork Lands wu de stiojed by fire in 1833, sever il months after he bad resigned. Them fore, according to Mr. Tbcrcas's evidence, as ' tbe plan wai in existence so late as 1839,' we may yet, metaphorically, if not altogether reasonably, indulge ths hope that it (cr tbe ghost of it) will make its resppeu nt.cf, to tbe iio small delight ot all oar worthy ftllow-citizeos. I am, Sir, fte., R. G. SYMOXDS. PS. — The ffjunreB were planned and p^gjed ont according to the instructions given to Goto i,t I J if lit by tbe South Australian Com muaiuieia in Marcb, 1636.
