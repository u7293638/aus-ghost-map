Sonnet. THE TWO WORLDS. Brisbane, ARTHUR A.D. BATLDON. Sprung as from mist two rolling worlds I viewed: One swiftly whirled a flashing realm of light, Roamed o'er by beings innocent and bright; The other swung a pathless solitude, Where ghosts and giant Bpeotros shuddering brood In Tafleys burdened with eternal night: A shadowy horror crept about the height Of desolate scoops where footsteps ne'er intrude. And, as I gazed with wonder, lo I there came A soft voioe whispering through the silent air: " Yon dazzling star is thine own dream of fame, Whioh Hope now peoples with creations fair; Yon earth, scorched by the thunder-rack's red flame, Foreshows thy dream when blackened with Despair."
