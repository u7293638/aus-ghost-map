SPIRITUALISM EXPOSED. , fliete (\r« some people. in ,the world iwho Kjll s*y any thing! dp anything} or believe sny'hing, nb matter how improbable or nn rsajounbla it appears. In fact, the credulity of the human race is unlimited and mr j bounded, and it is by strictly playing on this j ' characteristic, that quacks, impostors, and : swindlers All their pockets now a days. On I the o;her hand, any person who de rotes liiin Lself to remedying abuses and unmasking j ullany, deserves the thanks of, the general ^public. We have had conjurors, jugglers, jropetiers, and tricksters of variouB degrees : o£ excellence in Melbourno and these i colonies, such as Anderson, Hasleraayer, [Foster, the Davenports, Sylvesters, and [othciJ, but all these have delighted more iti mystifying th'au practically enlightening us [is to how their feats aid performed. Pro cessor Baldwin and liia wife are .a contrast, [i[er they veritably talie an interest in 'endeavoring to make everyone understand tho ways and means by which their very c'-'ver illusions are accomplished. The Pro ferVs second entertainment last night was a decided success in every way. He ex plainet' clearly and distinctly, how the ;variuiii rope and other tricks were produced | by the " quicktiess of tho hand that deceives the oyo." One of his avowed objects is to expose spiritualistic tricks j and we think, [that no reasonable matt, no matter how imbued with spiritualistic tendencies lie may bo, but will acknowledge ihat the same eflects bail be produced ly legerdemain and artistic cunning; as tliuss clainied tliroitjh tlie agency t'f spirits. , .Mediums '. loye"darkness, nitlier thai) ligiic, because their dbeds are evil," but Professor Baldwin prefers a.i the linht he can gel to eluci date his subject, With the exception of a chemical illusion almost everything is a reproduction of spiritistic work. No one " knows the ropes" botter than he does, and j the way he " shuffled off a mortal coil" he j 1.?n» forty eight seconds was | something . to command admiration. As |in. all jugglery, tlie solutions are ij Tory simple for as it is often said " it's | eaty enough to do a thing if you know % eiactly how." Placing tho iron ring on a | man's arm, his hands in yours, is a particular | illustration of this. It might be presumed I li1*' a.u exhibition such as that of the s Baldwin's would be tiresome, but this is %"10 cas®, as tho interest never flags, and I r- Baldwin is quite a host in himself. |rroui his own words, ha "talks and ho S t.iks, and he talks," then lie talks again, and Kei-ps on UlkiiiL', with liet'u and there a spice of grim irony or sarcasm throughout jits conversation, that makes you wonder how ever he keeps up such a cannonade of . words, and artillery of fun. Last night, the committee appointed to investigate the ; proceedings c nsisted of Dr. Cro3sehj Mr. &C-; Hopkins, Mr Hartshorn, of the state School, and Mr. M'Crackeu, and theso Jent emeu devoted their attentions faithfully to the business before them Mrs. Baldwin's principal work lay in the " Katie King cl'eP'' w'1jc'1 may be thus briefly de scribed. She is placed in the cabinet, with a rope tightly tied round her neck, and astened through the wall securely on to the outjiiiy Immediately after, bells are rung, arttcles flung from one spot to another, horns low n, and so ou. Following this, the faces I various people appear at the apertures n« speak in appropriately ghost like tones. ie real secret of this feat is comprised in nil apparently ti iUiny piece of sleight of hand. re the tying is completed, the lady manages to retain a large amount of -'slack" oy means of which she makes all the knots "O, and yets] |00so to act as a free gent.
