SOME FUNNY TRANSLATIONS. One account of the late German Emperor's funeral, writes David Ker in Harper's Weekly, stated that the sermon was preached on a text taken from " th Book of Jacob" - a hitherto unknown portion of Holy Writ - the real words being the " Epistle of James" {Jakob). An English translation of a German novel ren- dered " Ich habe einen Gast bekommen" (I have got a guest) by "I have become a ghost." Another transformed " food for reptiles" into " the Diet of Worms." In a French version of "Guy Mannering" the phrase of " a stickit minister" (unsuccessful preacher) figured as "une ministre assassine." Nor are the titles of books a less fruitful field of mistranslation than their contents. A Vienna transla- tion of George Eliot's "Felix Holt, the Radical," was entitled "Felix; Hold the Rascal !" The play of "Love's Last Shift" was reproduced in Paris as " La Derniere Chemise de l'Amour." " Rob Roy" still figures in Russia as "Bob, the King," "Roy" having been confused with " Roi." A similar mis- conception turned " MÃ©moires de Roy d'Argens" into "Memoirs of a Silver King" - an exploit almost rivalling that of the farmar who named a pet rooster "Robinson" because he "crew so." But the palm of mistranslation is cer- tainly due to an Englishman who some years ago came to a foreign teacher to be " finished" in German, and was asked to write a sentence in colloquial English, and then to translate it. He wrote : "He has bolted, and has not settled his bill ;" translating it by, "Er hat verriegelt, und hat nicht einsicdelt seinen Schrapel." "Verriegela" meaning "to bolt a door," "einsiedeln" to "settle as a colonist,'' and " Schnabel" the "bill of a bird." This extraor- dinary sentence really signified : " He has driven in a bolt, and has not colonised his beak."
