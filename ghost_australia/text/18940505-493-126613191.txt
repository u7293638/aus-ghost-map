DUNGOG SHOW. [By our own Reporter.] The eighth exhibition of the Williams River Agricultural and Horticultural Association has been added to the past and left behind it very pleasant memories of a highly successful reunion which was alike a credit to the management and a monument to the prosperity, wealth - and industry of the district. Dungog shows in previous, years have been invariably wet, indeed the Association was so disheartened by continued unfavourable weather that early this season tbe members seriously considered the advisableness of disband- ing the Society, but fortunately wiser counsels prevailed, and it was determined to make one more trial before giving up the ghost as it were. The result was that beautiful weather prevailed for the function on Wednesday and Thursday, and the show was the most genuinely pleasant and suc- cessful ever held at Dungog. As we have previously recorded, Wednesday morning broke somewhat dull and a heavy, gloomy fog lay over everything like a pall, so that the tops of Coorei, Mount McKinlay, and other rises which surround the town were well nigh invisible, and this state of affairs remained until well on in the afternoon, when the haze lifted and left everything bright and cool. The attend- ance was not large when compared with the crowds which flock to exhibitions at Maitland and Single- ton, but it was of considerable proportions for Dungog, and the accommodation at the various hotels was taxed to the utmost. Many of the visitors came from long distances, and Mait- land was well represented by exhibitors and the general public, and the former were very successful. Recent gold finds in the district served in no small measure to attract attention to the show, but strange to say the denizens of the picturesque old town are apparently oblivious or careless of the fact that a veritable Eldorado is, as it were, peacefully lying in their back yard. Strangers to the locality, however, were obviously excited over the prospect before the district, but they could glean very little information, and to many Dungogites the Monkerai, Cherry Tree and the Whispering Gully appeared to be terra incognita. It was evident that the townspeople had made special efforts to make the place look at its best, and business houses were plainly freshly stocked, whilst some small attempts were made at ornamentation. The show ground was alive with bunting which cracked and fluttered in the breeze. This, with the gay costumeB of the ladies, the moving crowds of pedestrians and horse men, together with the strains of the Dungog Band made the place seem happy and contented. On Wednesday, at noon, Mr. H. H. Brown, member for Durham, declared the Show open, and took oc casion to make a characterically pithy speech, in which he apologised for the unavoidable absence of tbe Minister of Works (Mr. Lyne), who was de tained by Parliamentary duties, and then visitors were at liberty to move around and thoroughly enjoy themselves. The grandstand which was used for the first time last year, was again well patronised, and afforded a splendid coign of vantage, from which the jumping and other com petitions, etc., could be witnessed. The accommo dation formerly provided by tho Society for fat stock and pigs lately promised to be come inadequate, and so the difficulty was met by the erection of some sub stantial pens and styes, which were well occupied. Th&re; was great competition this season in the sections devoted to agriculture, and to house the exhibits the Association had to build a temporary tarpaulin-covered structure, which fully met its object. The contents were of a very varied charac ter, but the quality in the great majority of cases could not be improved upon, and it is very evident that the farmers and settlers on the Williams have thoroughly mastered the art of cultivation. There were particularly fine specimens of hay, potatoes, and other common vegetables, whilst the baeon and butter to the eye at least appeared delicious, In the centre of the ground near the prin cipal parade could be found the vehicles, machinery, and agricultural implements. Messrs. James Riley and John M'Ncall, of Mait land,— the latter not competing— sent some splendid buggies and sulkies, the work in which could not bo surpassed, and Mr. Riley thoroughly deserved tho awards whicb he received. The Great Northern Hardware Company, which has its head quarters at West Maitland, and which is managed by Mr. W. S. Harrison, sent a large collection of agricultural requisites, and gained many prizes, but it was not allowed to sweep the entire board, as Skillen and Walker, local manufacturers and importers, successfully competed in some of tne sections. As may bo imagined, this portion of the catalogue attracted much attention from the farming community, and was a very fine show in itself. Two or three exhibits of dairying utensils came in for much examination and criticism, and bhey were tested on occasions during the days. Up sear the main pavilion was a Jerger gold-saving machine, which was the cynosure of many eyes, but we did not see it tried. The _ poultry pavilion was well filled, that is i numerically Bpeaking, but the quality of many of ? the birds was indifferent, and the great majority were in bad feather. Some of tho Colonial-bred game fowls were worthy of notice, but taking this section all round it was a comparative failure. .The greater number of the dogs were ill-condit ioned brutes, although there were doubtless some valuable cattle dogs shown, whilst there were one or two fair greyhounds, but the terriers wore valueless, and so Bpace need not bo wasted on them. When one looked round at dittereDt sections and got rid of an air of old acquaintanceship which is unavoidable at shows he discovered that the blood stock was middling. Kingston, who got first prize as stallion, would not win in fair company, but lie is a good horse nevertheless, although ho did not look his best as he has been in training. Voltigeur who was second is an old acquaintance, but tho son of Splendor although a big strapping fellow is not at all in our line. None of the others were remark able, ^ unless Ambition may get useful stock. Javelin, a black cott by Invader out of Stella, who ! won the prize for stallion under three years, was in much better trim than he was at Maitland, and ho may yet win a race or two if he keeps sound. The yearling^by Yellow Jacket out of a Yattendon mare shown by Mr, T. Irwin, is a useful sort, but we did not like any of his oppo nents. It is very difficult to judge foals with anything like precision, but Mr. W. Potter's bay by_ the Musket horse Scot's Grey should furnish into a fair animal. The females were decidedly better all round than the stronger sex, and were of far more even quality. Mr. J. IC. Mackay showed Second Queen in the aged class, and this daughter of Goldsbrough and Hebe should throw fine stock. She was decorated with the blue ribbon, as was her filly foal. A Drummer mare, the property of Mr. M'tjeod, was a good second in the breeder's class. The same gentlem-in won the next class with a fair mare by Kings Own, a bay by the Arab Kars being second. The two-year-olds were too bad to be looked at by the judges, but the yearling filly by Sweet William out of Leader, the property of Mr. B. E. Hooks is a beauty, and it will be a great pity if she does not be given a chance of distinguishing himself on the turf. The stallions and mares shown as those best adapted for producing weight-carrying hack neys were very good specimens and the mares were particularly suitable for the purpose. With the exception perhaps of Mr. H. H. Brown's big bay stallion His Royal Highness the coaching stock were not remarkable, but the member of royalty is an excellent fellow with splendid bone, good colour and nice action. He is an imported horse, and it is said cost 600 guineas in England. There were some magnificent animals paraded among the draught stock, and Mr. S. Foot's Glad stone and Mr. A. H. Dawes's Pride of Singleton would take a great deal of beating in any shew ring in the world. The former is an imported horse and was decorated with the blue ribbon, whilst Mr. Daivo's colt took the red, but as he_ is improving he will make a great battle with his Dungog conqueror when next they meet. However, Mr. Dawes could not well grumble, for he secured the prizes for yearling, colt foal, mare over four years with the grand looking Daisy, three- year-old mare, filly foal, colonial-bred stallion, mare ditto, and was second in one or two other sections. There were many very fine active farm horses on view, and here we may mention that the pulling contest evoked much excitement. The horses were harnessed to a large iron monkey weighing about 22 cwt., and as the ground was somewhat heavy this object took a great deal of shifting. Eventually a bay gelding, the property of Mr. W. Potter, and a black mare owned by Mr. R. Moylan were voted so equal that the judges divided the prize. Each of these horses strained and tugged at its heavy burden until it was thought that they would drop from exhaustion. The hackney classes brought out tremendously bier fields, but after all crood horses were scarce. Victor, who won the list, class is a very fair sort, but it is evident that his owner takes great pains with his appearance ; he was as fat as mud, and we fancy he has seen his best day. We are very doubtful about .the correctness of tho decision which gave Monarch and Mr. Hooke's chestnut the honours in the 14st. claaa, but we suppose the judges know best. The ladieB* hacks were not up to champion form, but Mr. R. Taylor's cheBtnut that won is a smart sort of a lady. The ponies were very plentiful, and some of the boys who rode the different paces and over the jumps are very good horsemen, and everyone of them was daring to recklessness. The competition among the hunters was a very bad exhibition of jumping, and perhaps with one exception, the old white gelding Rocket from the Manning River district, not one of the horses com plied with the conditions. Some of them looked like plough nags, others were pretty well crippled, and how ty the widest stretch of imagination they could be regarded as hunters beats us. As may be imagined, Rocket won without difficulty, but as he had previously 'won the event two years in succession he was disqualified and the money went to old M.L.A., who was ridden by the well- known jockey M'Mahon. The buggy horses were bad, and there were only two sets of ponies shown in traps, and the prize here went to Mr. Sheridan's roans, although a protest was lodged that they were over height. As we have indicated all the cattle sections filled remarkably well, and there have been few better collections on the ground than the Alderneys and Ayrshires, with which as usnal Mr. H. H. Brown was very conspicuous. There were not any sheep shown, and the fat Btock was not remarkable. The main pavilion waB well filled, but little attempt had been mads atdecoration. There was agreatshow of preserves and jauis, whilst the butter and other produce waB evidence of the splendid district in which it was produced. Saddlery and harness made a good showing, and a case of gold specimens from the Monkerai, Nowendoc, and other places attracted much attention, particularly one tremendously rich nugget from Mr. Mackay's estate. The various schools sent a fine collection of work, and the draw ings and paintings were in many cases admirable. Mr. R. L. Pender, of Maitland, and some local fanciers showed a number of beehives, honey extrac tors, wax, and other results of the labours of the little busy bee, and they were much admired andexamined by the curious in such matters. Beekeeping Bhould be a popular and profitable industry in the Dungog district. Mr. Walter Bennett, the courteous and energetic secretary of the association, was very much in evidence on Wednesday and Thursday, and much of the success of the exhibition is undoubtedly due to his untiring exertions. He was ably assisted by many of his committee, and these gentlemen are to be congratulated on tho admirable and gratifying result of their efforts. There was the usual array of side shows and refreshment stalls on the ground, whilst Mr. Harry Lillyman of the Bank Hotel, Dungog, dispensed liquid comforts.
