mhs and f ferite. MR. PUDSTER'S RETURN. Ma. Solomon' Pcdster and Mr. Gideon Maggleby were bosom friends ; nor conld they well be otherwise. They were both bom on tue 29th of Ma;, IS15, in Cower street. Bloomsbary : Solomon entering upon the world's stage at an early hour in the morning at No. 69, and Gideon first seeing the light about mid-day at No, 96. At the age of 10 the boys were sent to Westminster school ; at the age of 17 they became fellow-clerics in the great West India warehouse of Ruggleton, Matta, &. Co., and at the age of fonr-and-twenty they went into partnership as sugar merchants in Minniiiff Lane* At f^iAt. period they were bachelors ; and being already sincerely attached one to the other, they decided to live together in a pleasant little boose in the then fashionable neighborhood of Fitzroy square. For years they were almost inseparable. Day after day they breakfasted and dined together at home, and worked and lunched together, in the city ; and but for the feet that the firm purchased a large sugar estate in Demerara, Solomon Padster and Gideon Maggelby would probably hare never been parted for more than & few horns at a time until death decreed a dissolu tion of their partnership. The sugar estate, unfortunately, required a great deal of looking after ; and at regular intervals of two years one of the partners was obliged to cross the Atlantic and to remain absent from his friend for five or six months. Solomon and Gideon alternately undertook these trouble some expeditions and braved the heat and mosquitoes of the tropics ; and meantime the firm of Pudster and Maggleby prospered exceedingly, and no shadow of a cloud came between the devoted Mends— the former of whom, on account of his being a few hoars the older, was declared senior partner in the firm. Bat in the year 1865 an important event happened. Mr. Pudster and Mr. Maggleby ran down by train one evening to see the fireworks at the crystal palace; and on their retain journey they found themselves in a compartment the only other occupant of which was a remarkably buxom a cheery lookrog widow of *bant 40 years -of age. The two gentlemen, with their accustomed gallantly ffntar*1^ into conversation with her. They discovered that she and they had tunmrtS trimAa in *wnTrt', and «he was, in fact, a cftrtMP Mrs. Bunter, whose many domestic virtues and abounding good-oatore had *ftek -been gpok^ti of -in their %eanng. They were charmed with her ; they begged, as if with one accord, to be permitted to call npon her at her house in Chelsea ; and when, after putting her into a cab at Victoria station, they started off to walk home, suunltuieonaly ?vi*'mA^ with ^M-ftTOflJww'*! ' What a splendid 'woman !' 'Ah Gideon V ejaculated Mr. Pudster sentimentally, a few moments later. ' Ah, Solomon !' responded Mr. Maggleby with equal passion. ' If only we had snch an angel at home to welcome as !' fY-ilf»'»M the senior partner. ' Jnst what I was thinking,' assented Mr. Maggleby, who thereupon looked op at the moon and signed profoundly. ' No other woman ever affected us in this way Gideon,' said Mr. Pudster ; ** and here we are at 50- ? ** ?* Fifty last May, Solomon.' ' Weil, we ought to know better !' ex claimed Mr. Pudster with honest warmth. ' So we ought, Solomon.' ** But upon my word and honor, Gideon, Mrs. Bunter'e a magnificent specimen of her 'She is, Solomon ; and I don't think we can conscientiously deny that we are in love with her.' *' We are,' said Mr. Pndster, with much humility. Having thus ingenuously confessed their passion, the two gentlemen walked on in silence ; and it was not until they were near home that they again spoke. ' I suppose that it will be necessary as a matter of foi-mal business,' suggested Mr. Pudster, diffidently, '' for us to call npon Mrs. Banter, and apprise her of the state of our feelings. We mean, of coarse, to follow the matter up r1 'Certainly, certainly,' agreed Mr. Mag gleby ; ** we mean to follow the matter up.' w Perhaps the firm had better write to her and prepare her mind,' proposed the senior partner, with kindly forethought. 'The firm had better write tomorrow, Solomon ; but, Solomon, it occurs to me that the firm cannot marry Mrs Banter. You or I must be the happy man ; and then, Solomon, we shall have to separate.' 'Nerer!' ejaculated Mr. Pudster, who stopped and seized his friend by the hand — ' Never ! You shall marry Mrs. Banter and well all live together-' 41 Solomon, this is magnanimity !' mur mured Mr. Maggleby, who hod tears in his eyes. ' No ; Twill not accept such a sacri fice. Yon, as the senior partner, shall marry Mrs. Banter, and with her permis sion I will stay with yon. The firm shall write to prepare her mind. Business is business. The firm shall write to-night, and I myself will take the letter to the post.' Half an hour later Mr. Maggleby handed to Mr. Pudster a letter, of which the fol lowing is a cony : 14 Minctnt. Lase, Cm-, ap*j, 1, 180.), TO MBS. FeBDIXAXD BCVTKU, Matador Villa, Chelsea, Mapau. — Onr Mr. Pudster will do himself the hopor of calling upon yon to-morrow be tween twelve ud one, in order to lay before you a project which is very intimately con nected with the comfort and well-being of the undersigned. We beg you, therefore, to re gard any proposrMon tint may be made to you by our Mr. P., as made to you on behalf of the firm and with its full authority. We remain, ma^n1, most devotedly yours, : Pcdsteb and Magcleby. i ' How will that do *' asked Mr. Maggleby ' Excellently well, Gideon,' said Mr. [ Pndster. But don't you think that* most devotedly yours1 sounds rather too distant * What do you say to 'yours admiringly,' or ' ' ' Yours to distraction' sounds best, I ! think, replied Mr. MagglcUy after consider able reflection. 'I will put that in, and re copy the letter, Solomon.' ' We ore about to take an important step in life,' and Mr. Pudster seriously. 'Are you sure, Gideon, that we are not acting too hastily?' ' Mr. Pndster !' exclaimed Mr. Maggleby warmly, ' we may trust these sacred promptings of oar finer feelings. We have lived too long alone. The firm needs the chaste and softening influence of woman. And who in this wide world is more fitted to grace onr board than Mrs. Bunter?' 'So be it then,' assented the senior Mr. Maggleby re-copied the letter, signed it with the firm's usual signature, and car ried it to the nearest letter-box. When he returned, he found his friend waiting to go to bed, and trying to keep himself awake by studying the marriage service. On the following forenoon, Mr. Pudster, with the scrupulous punctuality that is characteristic of city men, called at Matador Villa, Chelsea, and was at once shown into the presence of Mrs. Banter, who was waiting to receive him. *? I am qnite at loss to under coining to see me to-day,' said the widow. 'From your Letter, I judge that you have some business proposal to make to me. Un fortunately, Mx. Pudster, I am not pzepared to speculate in sugar. I am not well off. But, perhaps, I am under a misapprehension. The letter contains an expression which I do not understand.' 'It is true,' replied the senior partner, ** that we have some hope of persuading you to speculate a little in sugar ; and there is no reason why your want of capital should pre ventyour joining us.' ' I quite fail to grasp your meaning,' said Mrs. Bunter. 'Well, I am not very good at explana tions,' said Mr. Pudster ; V fant I will ex plain the situation as well as I fg*n. You see, Mrs. Banter, Mr. Maggleby, my partner and myself, are bachelors and live together. We find it dull. We long for the civilizing influences of woman's society. We are, in fact, tired of single-blessedness- The firm is at present worth a clear five thousand a year. It will support a third partner, we think ; and so we propose, Mr. Banter, that you should join in and come and take care of as in a friendly way.' Mrs. Bunter looked rather uncomfort able, and was silence for a few moments. ' Yoa are very good,' she said at last ; ?* but although I am not well off, I hod not thought of going out as housekeeper. The late Mr. Banter left me enoagh for my little needs.' ' I hope so indeed, madam. But we don't ask yoa to come to us as a housekeeper simply. Marriage is what we offer you, Mrs. Banter. In the name of Pudster and Maggleby, I have the honour of proposing for your hand.'1 '* Mercy !' exclaimed Mr. Banter in some agitation. 'Surley you would not have me marry the firm f' ' I put it in that way,' said Mr. Pndster, '* because Maggleby and I are practically one and the same. But I will be accurate. The proposition is, Mrs. Bunter, that you nhoold become the wife of— -ahem ! ? the senior partner ; and that Gideon social way. Excuse my blunt way of expressing myself, Mrs. Bunter.' 'Then you, Mr. Padster, are the senior partner^' said Mrs. Banter, with a very agreeable smile. '* I wm very much flat tered, I assure you ; but your proposal re quires consideration.' ' No doub't,' assented Mr. Pudster. 'The firm is willing to wait for your reply. In matters of business we are never in a hurry. When may we look for your ans wer r1 ' Well, you shall hare a note by to-morrow morning's post,' replied Mrs Bunter. ' I may say,' she added, ' that I have heard a great deal of your firm, Mr. Pudster j und that 1 am conscious that it does me great il'°r 7 ° mC * P m ** Indeed, madam the honor is ours !' said Mr. Padster, bowing as retired. No sooner had he departed t-hftp the widow barst into a long and merry fit of laughter. Her impulse was to write and refuse the ridiculous oner ; but as the affair, and in the evening, after dinner, she sat down a -seriously and wrote letter as follows : Matador Villa, Chelsea, 1 August 5, 1SG5. / To Messrs. Pudster and Magglcby, 14 Mincing Lone city : Gentlemen — I have decided to accept The very nattering offer which was laid befor me to day on yourbeUalf by your Mr. Patlster. If he will call, I shall have much pleasure in ar ranging1 preliminaries with htm. I remain, gentlemen, very faithfully ynurs. Mama BrvrKR. ' I must fall in with their hnmor. 1 snp nose,' she reflected. ** And readly, Mr. Pudster is a very nice man, and almost handsome ; and I:m sure that I shall do no harm by marrying him. Besides, it is quite true that they must want some one to look after them. If they go on living by them selves, they will grow crusty and bearish.' And Mrs. Banter sent her maid out to post the letter. Three weeks later, the widow became Mrs. Padster ; Mr. Maggleby, of coarse, officiating as best mm* s-t the wedding, and bung tihfe first to salute the bride in the vestry after the cermony. Thenceforward, for a whole year, the three members of the firm lived together, in complete harmony; and the pfeasent history of their existence was only inter rupted by Mr. Pudster'a enforced departure for Demerara in September, 1SGG. Mr. Maggleby it is true, offered to go instead of htm, Imt Mr. Padster would not hear of it -, and Mr. Maggleby was obliged to confess that business, anduuLt it was certainly Mr. Pud ster's tarn to brave the mosquitoes. And so after confiding his wife to tiie care of his friend, Mr. i'udster departed. During his absence all went well ; and in March, 1SG7, he returned to England. But this time the heat had been too much for poor Mr. Pud ster. His wife noticed that he was looking unwell. Maggleby, with, sorrow. Never theless, he won took to his bed ; and after a long and painfull illness, died. The grief of Mrs. Padster and Mr Mag gleby was terrible to witness. Mrs Pudster talked of retiring from the world ; and Gideon Maggleby disconsolately declared that he hftd no longer any thing left to live for. No one, therefore, will be much sur prised to hear that towards the end of March, ISfiS. Mr. Gideon Maggleby led Mrs. Soloraun. Pudster to the altar. ** Solomon will bless our union,' Mr. Mag gleby had said, when he proposed. ' Ah, dear, sainted Solomon !' Mrs, Pud ster had exclaimed as she fell weeping npon Mr. Maggleby's breast. CHAPTER 11. Mr. Gideon Maggleby had been married rather less than two- and-twenty hoars, when at about 9 o'clock on the morning of March 23, 1868, he walked into the room in which be had so often break-fasted and dined with his late friend and partner, Solomon Pudster. Mr. Maggleby, who was preeminently a. man of business, ha-d not «-*?' fit to oo to the Isle of Wight or to Paris to spend his honey moon ; and Mrs. Maggleby, who was nothing if not a woman of sound sense, had loyally accepted the decision of her third lord and master. They had agreed to stay in town, and not allow ti their new happiness to inter fear with their material interests in Mincing Lane. Mr. Maggleby had determined, how ever, to make a holiday of the day after his wedding ; to pfay at home in the morning with his wife, to escort her to Madam Tus Baad*s in the afternoon, and to *fa*-l?A her to play in the evening. With the comfortable programme in his mind's eye, Mr. Maggleby came down to breakfast in his flowered dressing gown. Mrs. Maggleby , he knew, would not be many minif*'* behind him, and he therefore rang the bell for the coffee, and turned lazily towards the table, upon which lay two piles of letters. The smaller heap chiefly consisted of missives addressed to Mrs. Padster, for the marriage of the previous day had not as yet been noised abroad in the country, and Mrs. Mag gleby bad several females correspondents who C'|TiPinT1M*ftfo^ with her rnnrh more often flutTi she co-nmunicated with ri»»m, The larger handle was made up of letters adressed either to Mr. Maggleby or to Messrs. Pudeter and Macglebv, the 'letters to the firm having been already brought down from Mincing Lane by a confidential clerk. It was a chilly morning ; and Mr. Mag gleby, with the letters in his hand, sank into an easy-chair by the fireside, and then began to polish his spectacles. Bat ere he had time to complete that operation, one envelope attracted the attention ot his not very dim sighted eyes. It bore the pos-tmark ** Ply mouth ' and v~as add&essed; in a nuoiliar handwriting. Without waiting to put on bis spectacles, Mr. Uageleby seized this envelope and tore it open. Foraninstaut he stared at the which it contaii-cd ; then he turned white letter fell back with a. groan. But Mr. Maggleby was a ma.ti of tVHi si rf pth M p self-coniinancL and he soor partly recovered himself. ** Maria must not sec me in this ajritated state,' he roummrtal, us he rose. ** 1 shall go back to my dressing- room, and decide upon some plaii of action before I face her.' And with unsteady steps, he quitted the dining-room, taking with him the letter that was Almost immediately afterwards, a servant entered with the cotfee and some covered dishes, which she set upon the table ; and uo sooner had she withdrawn tlian Mrs. Mag gleby appeared. Mrs. Maggleby iunked blooming, and evidently in capital spirits. She caught up her letters, sat down suiilinp in the very easy chair from which her husband had risen a few minute earlier, and began to read. The first letter to be opened to her in her new name. They contained congratulatious upon her marriage. Then she attacked the envLopcs that were addressed to Mrs. Pudster. One contained a bill ; another contained a request for Mrs. Pad ster's vote and interest on behalf of Miss Tabitha. Gabbles, a maiden iadv who was seeking admission into the home for the daughters of decay Trinity pilots ; and a third brought e. lithographed letter from the Marquis of Palmyra imploring the recipient to make some small subscription to the funds to the association for the enconargement of a sparagus culture in the Scilly islands. There were also letters from Miss Martha Tigstuke svart Mrs. Benjamin Bowery, dealing with nothiug in particular and with every - tiling in aeneral ; and dually there was a letter beariug the postmark ** Plyninvth.' Mrs. Maggleby opened it carelesly ; but a single glance at its contents caused her to btart op grasp convulsiuely at the mautlepiccc, utter an t:\clatnatioa and tremble like a leaf. '* Poor Gideon !' she said. What a fear ful blow ! He musn't see me in this agi tated state. I shall go up stairs again and decide upon some plan of action before I face him.' And Mrs. Maggleby, letter in hand anil pale as death, quitted the room, leaving the coffee and the eggs and bacon and the crumpets to get cold. Three-quarters of an hoar later Mr. Mag gleby ventured down stairs again. He was dressed as if to go to the city, *nd in his hand he held a letter which bore the simple Mdrpw, ' Maria.' This letter he laid npon hie wife's plate. It was worded as follows : My Dearest Wife. — I am euddenlv and un expectedly summoned to Mincing' Tamp an business of the greatest importance. I do not know exactly when I shall return. Yours devotedly, Gideon. Mr. Maggleby hastily seized a tepid trum pet, and without the formality of ipating himself at the table devoured the clammy dainty. Then hearing his wife npon the stairs, he rushed Iik»» a mnJm«i from the room, and an instant afterwards, left the boose and quietly closed the front door behind him. Mxb. Maggleby, whose face bore traces of recent weeping, entered the fining room as if she expected to find the place tenanted with a ghost. Discovering, however, that it was empty, she resumed her seat by the fire, and with an hysterical oatbnrst buried her head ?? Poor, dear Gideon!' she sobbed. 'What will become of him and me ! We ah«U be imprisoned for life ; I know we shall. The house will hare to be shut up ; the business will go to rain : and the servants will have to know ali. Oh, it is too terrible 1 But I most compose myself, Gideon will be **u*img down, and I must be prepared to break the news to hirr) ;' and with great seU-command, Mrs. Maggleby wiped her eyes and seated herself at the table. As she did so she caught sight of her husband's note, which she eagerly opened. ' He has gone !' she exclaimed despair ingly, when she had read it. 'I am left alone to bear the trial ! Ah, Gideon, yon little know how cruel yoa are ? Bat I mast; I must follow you ! We mast concert measures at once.' Once more she went upstairs. She ant on her bonnet and cloak ; she covered Tier flushed face with a thick veil ; and without saying a word to any of her servants, she left the house and made the best of her way to the nearest cab-stand. Meantime, Mr. Maggleby had been driven to his place of business in Mincing Xane. He entered his office, and sat down as if dand, in his private room. Hearing of hs prin cipal's unexpected arrival, the head clerk, Mr John Doddard, almost fww**^fptf^T MTpfTareri. He too was scared and breathless. ' ? 14 Read, sir, read !' be gasped, as he thrust an open letter into Mr. Maggleby's hand. Mr Mnfigjphy rn«yhB*''*»yfr^lfc'ay iftfrr and read afootl as follows : : On Board &. 6. Camel, off Plymouth, Tuesday. DeakMb. DoddaBD — As yon *re prob ably not expecting me, I send a line mabore to let you know that I hope to return in tube to be at business at the usual hoar an Thursday. Please take care that there is a good fire in my private room, as a visit1 to Demerara, as yon know, renders me particn Iariy sensitive to cold and damp. I am writing to Mr. Maggleby.

' I knew it !' ejaculated Mr. Magelefay. 'I hare just received the letter that he speaks of.' 'What does it mean?' asked Mr. Dod dard, 'I seem to be dreaming, sir. We buried poor Mr. Padster eight «wartfiB ago, didn't we !M ' So I thought,' murmured Mr. Maggieby, vaguely. ' Bat this letter is certainly in bis ' handwriting. And look at the post-mark. There it is, as plain as possible : V Plv motrth, Mar. 22, 188S.' That was yesterday: and to day is Wednesday. March 23d. Jost read my letter, Mr. Doddard !' and he palled from his pocket a missive which he handed to his clerk. Mr. Doddard read as follows : On board S. £. Camel, off Plymouth, Tuesday. My Dear Gideon— Here I am almost at borne again. 1 fancy yon did not expect to see me just at present ; for I wasn't able to write to you before we left Demerara ; go, as we are now sending ashore here, I post von a few lines to prepare for* the surprise, 'it U, as yon know, quite imnsnal for vessels of this line to call at Plymouth, and, therefore, I haven't time to send yon a long letter: though, if we also call nt Southampton, I will write a^aiu from there.

' Well, I never did !' cried Mr Doddard. *' Vet I coald swear to Mr. Pudster's hand writing anywhere. It Is a terrible thing for a man wlio ought to be lying quietly in his coffin to come back like this, and upset every - '* You are certain about the handwriting?' asked Mr. Maggleby anxionsly. ' Quite certain !' replied Mr. Doddard. 'What a frightful thing for poor Mrs. Pudster *' ** Mrs. Magffleby, you mean !' said Mr. Mopjileby. **? Yes. I don't know how to break it to her. It's a case of bigamy, isn't ', Let us hope for the best sir. Mr. Pudster won't prosecute I fancy, considering the peculiar character of the circumstances. It's his fault. That is my opinion. I could twear, even now, that we borxed him. He must have revived in his coffin, and been dag up again by the grave-diggers ; and most then have pone over to Demerara in order to avoid shocking his poor wife.' *' I wonder oar Demerara agents didn't say something about it when they wrote by the last mail/' said Mr. M*ggleby. ' Oh, of coarse he kept them quiet, sir. But it's a cruel case— that's all 1 have to ?ay. And though I have known Mr. Fndster these 30 yean, and liked him too, I don't hesitate to Bay that he's not behaving straightforwardly in this piece of business. '* 'Hush ! Wait until yon know of his motives,' said Mr. Maggleby. ' He cant excuse himself, sir, I tell you,** rejoined Mr. Doddard warmly. 'If he comes back, I go. So there ! And I say with all respect to you, sir. When a man's once dead, he's got no right to come back again. It isn't natural ; and what's more, it isn't fwi|nn-ffw-I'lf^i ' The bitterness of Mr. Doddord's remarks in this connection may be partly accounted for by consideration of the fact that Mr. Moggieby had ?. few daye previously an nounoed his intention of fa^V'iF the head clerk into partnership at an early date, Mr, Pndster's return would of coarse knock this project on the head. 'Well, Doddard,' said Mr. Maggleby, *? we cant tpphi^ matters by talking.

'And when will he be at Gravesend*' Bleed Mr. Maggleby. Mr. Doddard tnrnpfl again to the Times. Bat |Tnriy*d of at onftft lighting upon tine shipping news, his eye fell npon a paragraph that occupied a not very conspicuous posi' tdon at the foot of the page. Suddenly he uttered a cry. ' What's the matter, Doddard !' demanded Mr. Maggleby, who was rapidly growing im patient. Mr. Doddard replied by bursting into a paroxysm of laughter. 'By jove '.' he -at- ^i-iFTHni, 'Isisis too ridiculous ! I never heard of such a tiling in my life ! It is like a play ! Ha, ha, ha ?' ' Your merriment is rather ill-timed,' cried Mr. Maggleby reproachfully. 'Tell me when Mr, Pudster will arrive at Gravesend ; and be quick, or I shall lose that traifl.' ' Aptump, too !' continued the head cleric hilariously. ' YonVe mad, I think,' said Mr. Maggleby. ** What do you mean f1 ' Well, read this, sir,' answered Mr. Dod dard, and he handed the Tunes to his prin cipal and pointed to the paragraph. Mr. Maggleby testily took the paper, ad justed his spectacles and read : — ' EXTKAO&DEKAKY; DISCOVERY AT PLY 5I0DTH. — The corporation of Plymonth re centiy decided to remove ati old and disused pump which for many years has etood handle less and dry on the Hoe. Yesterday morning, some workmen proceeded to remeve It, and in its interior they were astonished to discover a number of letters, which had, it is supposed, been put into the hole into which tbe handle formerly fitted, nyujpr the delusion that the pomp was a post-office pillar letter box. The letters were at once taken to the Plymouth post-office, and were without delay forwarded to th**r destinations.' ' Can it be true ?' ejaculated Mr. Maggle by, wi&& great sigh of relief. 'Then the fact -rf t*'» * Camel' having been signalled last night off Dover is merely a coincidence?'* ?'Most certainly,' said Mr. Doddard. ** Thank heaven !' cried Mr. Maggleby fervently. 'Send the cab away, Doddard. But no t Hi go home again at once, and set my poor wife at ease. Ha, ha ! I do remem ber now that when poor Mr. Pudster came home from his last voyage, he discovered that some letters which he had posted at Plymonth had not been delivered. We didn't misa them, because, as you recollect, Doddard, he wrote again from Southampton.' ' Of coarse he did, sir,' said Mr. Doddard -' Well, let us congratulate ourselves. It would have been a fearful business for Mrs. Maggleby to have to go through.™ ' And it would have been bad for yon, Doddard, for it would have spoilt your chance of a partnership for some tune to come. Now, I'm oil' Mr. Maggleby put the Times in his pocket, and departed ; and when he reached his home and showed the paper to his wife, the couple sat together for at Least ^'-If an hour, ^IVinr over the extraordinary nature of the ad venture. ' Well, we shall be able to go to Madame TusBand's and the theatre after all, Maria,' said Mr. Maggleby at luncheon. And go they did ; and what is more, Mr. Doddard became a partner a fortnight later, the firm thenceforward being known as Mag gleby and Doddard.
