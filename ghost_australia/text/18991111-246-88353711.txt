NATURE IN NOVEMBER. How pleasant is the country dear On this November morn ! How pleasant is the midnight's tear That decks the ripening corn. And Nature Speaks with silent breath While tear drops stain the earth; The dying hours of Spring's sweet death Are wrapped in Summer's birth. No more we see the folded budl Upon the leafless tree: No more we see the snowflakes scud Across the ruffled,sea. But fibrous leaves and sparkling flowers Have now the buds replaced; And o'er the hills dance sunshine showers Where once the snowstorm raced. And as the day draws to its close, And darkening shaaes appesr, . Thecunrling mists in pace reposd ,Oni Spring's sad silent bier. And in the blissful roll of Night, When silence reigns supreme, Â· The ghost-moth with its lumbering flight Disturbs the vigils dream. And is yon dappled sky the dawn Of summer's piercing ray ?: And doth yon blushing streak adorn The last of Spring's sweet day ? And Nature utters her reply--, 'Tie Summer's quickening breath That dapples yonder pale blue sky To mark Spring's silent death. ROBERT LIDGETT, JUN.
