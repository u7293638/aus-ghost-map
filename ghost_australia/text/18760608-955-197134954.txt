English Mail [The E.M.S.S. 'Sumatra' with, the April mails has arrived, but too late to admit of extracts being given in this issue.] \- . BAPTISM OF FIRE. Admibal Fishbourne, with his American friends, Mr. Boardman, Dr. Asa Mahan, and others, are labouring in the Banner of Holiness to explain and enforce what they call the baptism of fire, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Various ' experiences ' of ' the man ner ' of receiving it are published, having a most dangerous savour of mysticism. The following is one of these experiences, which lately appeared in the Banner. It seems to be regarded as a physical manifestation : — ' I read your testimony of laying all on the altar for a whole burnt sacrifice for Christ. I thought, although I was a poor, illiterate, and secluded person, that if there was anything more for me, and that it would make me more efficient in winning souls, or, better, arm me against the foe, and cause me to stand stronger and firmer, so that my life might be a living epistle, known and read of all men, I wanted it too. I laid all on Christ according to the best of my knowledge, not knowing what to expect, but trusting in my Saviour, who I knew was no respecter of persons, but giveth to all liberally who come unto Him in his own appointed way. 'For three weeks I watched the offering, continually crying, 'If there is anything more, O Lord, show it me, and bind me continually closer to Thee,' believing that when the fire came I should know it as sister P ? did ; when, sure enough, to the praise .of God'be it said, that on the 6th of November, while about my work, I left my work to go and thank God on my knees before Him, when the fire caught and burned all over this mortal body. Can I describe it ? No, never 1 It is beyond description ; suffice it to say, that the fire still burns, and my soul doth magnify the Lord for ever. Amen.' — Record.
