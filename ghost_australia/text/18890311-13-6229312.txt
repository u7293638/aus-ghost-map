The Prince took to drinking to excess, and being of slight build, a nervous lymphatic temperament and highly imaginative and excitable he could not stand wine. He lost his interest in his literary pursuits and artistic studies, and was always craving for excitement He did mad things when one bear shooting and deer stalking he was frequently seen with flushed face He took pleasure in loose society, became, smitten with a fondness for ghost stories and spiritualism and was haunted with a fear that he might be come mad like Louis the Second of Bavaria He had an intrigue with a Baroness Marie von V a young lady, 21 years old, one of the beauties of Austrian society She belonged to an old Czech family, and was niece of a well known Austrian sportsman The acquaintance between the baroness and the Crown Prince began same months ago line increased the estrangement between the Prince and his wife He scarcely made any secret of his determination to obtain a divorce He counted confidently on receiving the assistance of the Emperor, on account of the disappoint- ment experienced by his Majesty when the doctors certified that the Crown Princess could have no farther issue To the Crown Princes surprise and disappointment however, the I Emperor point blank refused to countenance anything of the kind His Majesty professed himself as he undoubtedly is very much attached to the Crown Princess and he rated his son for his an arrival conduct On Sunday, the 27th January there was a terrible scene between the Prince and his wife. The Princess | Stephanie threatened to return to her parents in Belgium and the Prince taunted her with having no son The Emperor had to interfere He told the Prince that he would appoint him Governor of Bosnia and oblige him to go and live at Seraje to 9 There he said 'you will have to lead a reputable life and there will be an end to all these scandals. At the same time the Emperor cautioned the Prince to be more patient with her husband. The Crown Prince was seen for the last time in public at the Princess Reussa reception On that same Sunday evening he was near ing the Prussian uniform and seemed in a gay mood, though Unshed and somewhat flighty The next morning his father sent for him and repeated what he had said on the previous day, but with more peremptoriness adding that he would give the Prince a week to make his submission and promise to lend a better life The Prince got very angry and left his father without 1 kissing; his hand, according to the Austrian custom Striding away to his apartments he took off his uniform, put on a suit of shooting clothes and sent notes to Prince Philip of Coburg, and Count Joseph Hayes inviting them to join him at Meyer ling for a couple of days shooting Soon after wards he started for Mayerling in a two horse cab driven by a man named Brat Tesch a novel eniLcr of comic songs On Tuesday night the Prince dined with Count Boyes and attended his nerves with a good deal of champagne At first he was in very low spirits but he gradually brightened up and after dinner Bratfisch the cabman, was summoned to sing to him The Prince, Count Boyes and Bratliach re illumed together until 3 o'clock in the morning but during the intervals between Brat each a song the Prince several times left the dining-room and went to his study to write letters which were afterwards found on his desk At 3 it in tins singular company separated on the understanding that the Prince would go out shooting at 3 o'clock in the morning From this point the accounts differ, some telling the gamekeeper a story and making, the girl who committed suicide not the Baroness von V but another young lady of the Austrian aristocracy of Portuguese extraction and fierce temper The day after the Princes departure from Vienna she went out shopping with her aunt, and gave that lady the ship while the two were in a warehouse together On reaching Meyerling she insisted on seeing the Prince the interview quite unnerved him She stormed and declared that her shame would soon become public and ended by saying that unless the Prince would take her openly under his protection, and elope with her for a few weeks of foreign travel she would commit suicide The Prince was so frightened that he dared not let the girl go back to Vienna alone, but proposed that she should remain for the night at Mayerling, and she was accordingly installed in the lodge of the head gamekeeper a man named Gotliachurt. In the night the Prince slipped -out and went to the g fined keeper a lodge to see the young lady At this hour the under keeper a man named W eedenng was going his night rounds. He had orders to call the head keeper at 6 o'clock, and at the hour appointed he went to the lodge and knocked at the door. He was carrying a double barrelled loaded gun slung over his back Suddenly while he knocked at the front door of the house he heard a window at the side open and somebody jump out Having no idea that the Prince was in the house he ran round, and saw a man scamper mg off in the dark He shouted 'stop and the next instant fired The man dropped but in the shoulder W eedenng burned up and the Crown Prince Struggling to his feet gasped out I am the Archduke Rudolph I am hit Lead me to the Schloss The Prince swooned just as he reached the window where the girl whom he had left a few moments before was Standing Wondering appears then to have called out in his distraction that he had killed the Prince upon which the girl withdrew with a dismayed at neck, and swallowed the contents of a bottle of poison which she had brought with her It is not certain whether the Prince knew what she had done The only certain thing is that recovering quickly from his swoon he ordered Weedering again to help him to walk to the Schloss, and gave him the strictest injunctions to hold his tongue The Prince then went home and shortly afterwards was found lying dead trenched with blood He was lying half out of bed and a revolver was on the floor According to another story the game keeper's tale is all false and the truth is amd to be as follows -The Prince went to Mayerling and the Baroness Marie disappeared, leaving a note for her mother in which she said that she was some to drown her self Her frantic mother instantly went to Count Taafe the Austrian Premier and the latter promised to cause inquiries to be made Detectives were accordingly placed upon the track of the young lady and on the following day they made the discovery that she was at 9) am with the Crown Prince at Meycrltnc, Count 1 mile conte) ed the information to li r mother who on We liked by naming, the day of the sure he went to the I emperor an Flat I the matter 1 before him On returning, home the other I was a in the letter from her daughter late I for in Mayerling" in which the youthful 1 soreness mutinous t 1 that mile and the Crown I once had resulted to c munt since he together the Prince had to miss 1 her mama as HOUR as he or turned his day one from the access and when he informed her that this was now impossible now HIt, to the II Emperor e refusal to consent to the divorce they resolved to commit suicide led Ina the-, did on tin We Tues 1 by mummy, in the bedroom of the Prince When Loschek, the Prince's valet, entered the bedroom in the morning after having vainly knocked for admittance, he found the bodies of the two lovers lying on the bed Before calling for anyone he carried the body of the baroness into an adjoining room, so that when Prince Philippe of Coburg and Count Hayes, on being summoned by Loschek, entered the bedroom they saw only the body of the Crown Prince and naturally concluded that it was a simple case of suicide, as was reported to the Emperor On being informed of his son s death the Emperor at once suspected the truth, and exclaimed, I would rather have lost a province than that this disgrace should have befallen me The correspondent of the Daily A News at Rome states that he has been able to learn the exact particulars of what occurred at the Vatican between the Holy See and the Imperial Family of Vienna on the occasion of Prince Rudolph a death The Pope received the first telegram, announcing simply the death of the Prince to which His Holiness himself wrote a reply of a few lines, and this for him was an extraordinary thing to do as he has the greatest difficulty in holding a pen On the following day there came a long telegram from Vienna, explaining all the circumstances of the case, from which it appeared that there had been both a suicide and a duel A difficulty therefore rose to decide whether the Archduke should have religious burial according to Zanoni cal law Suicide being considered in he light of madness a religious service is granted, but it is not allowed to those killed in duels the congregation of cardinals immediately assembled by order of the Pope to examine into the question After a long discussion the cardinals came to the conclusion that only one deranged in mind could have entered into such a duel The natural consequence of the decision was that the necessary permission was granted. The Emperor received the news with the deepest gratitude and telegraphed to the Pope that in his great bereavement His Holiness had spared him the greatest grief
