V.R.C. AUTUMN MEETING. SECOXD DAY. Melbourne, March 9. [By Telegraph.] [From our own Reporter.] The weather was particularly "warm and sultry to-day for the races, but nevertheless there was a fair attendance for the Autumn Meeting. The racing was very fine throughout the day, but in all the events the books had a bad time, as the winners were the favourites. The Hurdle Race opened the proceedings, and Eros was backed for more money than anything in the race. Dnndreary led for some distance, but he ran off just as he seemed winning easily, and after that the favourite's course was pretty clear. Guesswork was heavily backed for the Sires' Produce Stakes, and Mr. Dakin tried the experiment of putting Rawlings up instead of the usual jockey. At the post to- day the colt was quiet enough, and after getting off very well he ran with Bassanio and Fryingpan till a furlong from home, when he came out and won very easily from his stable companion. Handy Andy did what he liked with the lot that opposed him in the Corinthian Cup. The Australian Cup now came on for decision, and no less than twenty-two horses were weighed out. Sweet William -remained very firm in the betting to the last, but a number of others were supported on the course for small amounts, notably Coriolanus, Ween, and Pollio. The race was run at a terrific pace, thanks to Duehess. who raced up the straight the first time as though she was going for half a mile, burst round the bend, and at the back of the course she was out hy herself, and it was not until Hales went after her on the favourite that any horse succeeded in getting her measure. When Sweet Willfttm went up Wellington, Pollio, and Saunterer followed. Just as the straight was entered Pollio caught and beat Duchess, and then Wellington and Sweet William challenged. The latter soon retired, his efforts to catch Duchess having settled him, and despite the game efforts of old Wellington, Pollio got home by nearly a length. The time is the fastest on record, and is due to the pace made by the boy on Duchess. First Water pulled up very lame. Lang wins a good stake on Pollio, but the victory was not ropular, in consequence of the way in which horses have been run lately. The Grand Stand Stakes produced a grand set-to between Bathurst and Darebin, the former receiving the Judges' award, though many thought it was a dead heat between the pair. No less, than thirty two-year-olds weighed out for the Nursery Handicap, and backers were in great form, as they took 3 and 4 to 1 about bolitude freely. Saionara was also heavily backed. The race was won all the way by Solitude, but there was a splendid race for second honours between Fryingpan, Allander, and Bassanio. The bookmakers almost to a man lost heavilv on the day, as in addition to the favourites winning all the minor races, Pollio was consistently backed by the public for the Cup. To-night Hesperian was backed to win the Newmarket Handicap for £10,000, and he is now the first favourite at 8 to L Ghost is also heavily supported at 10 to 1. Larpeut is quoted at 100 to 8, and the others at 100 to 6. The following are the results:— HANDICAP HURDLE RACE. A sweepstakes of 5 sovs. each, h.ft., with 150 added. About two miles.

Bounding the bend Dnndreary and Black Prince drew away from tie field, but at the shed Eros and Fusilier were drawing up to these.

Sweet William was the first to show in front, but Suwarrow at once rushed through and led from Sweet William, Pollio, Narrabri, and Odd Trick past the Sheds; but as they came to the turn Duchess, who got away badly, took a commanding lead. Entering the straight her nearest attendants were Suwarrow and Narrabri, after whom came First Water, Elsinore, Sweet William, and Royal Maid. Coming up the straight the lightweight was drawing away, and past the Stand she led by six lengths from Narrabri, with Elsinore, Sweet William, Royal Maid next, and then First Water, Odd Trick, and Crystal on very even terms. The boy on Duchess rode her round the turn, and she increased the lead'to nearly a dozen lengths, Narrabri was following two lengths in front of Suwarrow, and then came in a cluster Elsinore, Royal Maid, Sweet William, Wellington, Pollio, Wfeen, Saunterer, Coriolanus, First Water, and Westbury, while Waterloo, Blue Ribbon, and Gloucester were stringing out in the rear. Opposite the stand Duchess was still six lengths clear of Narrabri and Royal Maid, next to whom came Suwarrow, Wellington, and Sweet William. Km Water at tins time was fadiryj away. As they came to the sheds the runaway filly was still going well, and Hales, finding that nothing would go to her, set sail in ursuit with the favourite, and at the same time Saunterer, Wellington, Pollio, and'Attache left-the main body of the field and went after the leader. Round the bend for home Dnchess held her own, but as they came into the straight Pollio cut her down, and went on from Wellington, Sweet William, Ween, and Duchess, Saunterer having collapsed at the turn. When the distance was reached Wellington and Sweet William challenged Pollio, and a desperate race ensued. Sweet William was the first to crack, and though Wellington once threatened to catch Pollio, the latter lasted the longest, and won by three parts of a length. Sweet- William was a fair third, and then came Ween, Duchess, Narrabri, Attache, Westbury, and Coriolanus in the order named. Time, 4 nun. J sec. THE GRAND STAND STAKES..
