ONE ON 'THE JUDGE.' Roy Bean, the high judge of the courts of Langtry, where justice is dished out to the living and dead alike in Judge Bean's own novel and distinctive way, was in San An tonio last week, on the occasion of which visit he was made the victim of a cruel practical joke, says the San Antonio ' Ex press.' Ho met a drummer at the hotel, who saiii 'ho had just come from Lanctry. ' Did you see my bear ? How ia ho getting along ?' was the justice's first question. Judge Bean's bear throughout West Texas stands second in fame to the judge himself. The animal was chained to a tree in the rear of the judge's beer saloon, and in its day drank many a bottle of beer at a cost of 25e per bottle, to the edification of the wayfarer who was compelled to spend a few hours in Judge Bean's judicial district. ' Didn't you hear of it ?' naked the drum mer. ' The boar died last night.' The dunimer had an old score to wipe out at Roy Bean's expense, and he succeeded in convincing the judge that his bear was dead. Roy Beau lost no time in making for the telegraph office, where he penned these in structions: ' Skin the bear, and express the skin to mo at once.' To this he attached his signature, which is the law in Langtry. Bean's man at the saloon promptly killed the hear and expressed the skin, and in the letter that accompanied the fur was this note: ''We hated to kill the bear, and he hated to die. It took three shots before he gave up tho ghost. We are now smoking.the batons.' When Roy Beau received 'the message he broke three chairs und then set out in quest of tho drummer. The offender is said to be conducting earnest diplomatic negotiations by mail with ?? The Lr.w of West Texas.'
