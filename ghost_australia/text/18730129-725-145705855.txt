MOB OF FAT CATTLE RUSHED AT NIGHT. { ORIGINAL. ) With a booming rattle to their fcet they stwt. Horns and hoofs with an unearthly dio, together clattering ; But, once around the camp they rinp, Then off at a furious headlong speed, Sounding as a clap of rolling thunder O'er the plains they go. Saddle horses with bells and hobbles . Lioudly jingling in tneir wild career Adding to the terror of the van. Bill, the man on watch â€” Although he's often seen the like before, Feels a certain awe as he rides by their side*, So does the fine horse he rides ; As straining every nerve, and trembling With eyes and ears alert, He gamely tries to^turn The fierce and stormy cattle in the lead. Bill keeping wide, and softly talking as he goes, To let the startled cattle know. No ghost nor stranger stalks along their side ; Bill now has turned tbe head, Ringing still, the mob in hand grows bigger, As the tail rjow nearly blown comes trotting up. Bill has stopped them well. Again with an air of quiet innocence Ccughihg and looking back they stand. New chum stranger looking at them now: W'oud never think those seeming qrtiot brutes Could makp. a crash like that just now ; Now up come racing Bill's two inatcs Exclaiming, have you got them all ? The saddle horses for a mile or more, Bight in tfie flying cattle went ; And now ^ill morning dawn, through rain and coH All hands have got to watch For fear they'd try the like again j Oh ! thank your stars, you town bred folks As on yopr downy beds you lie, Protected from the pelting rain and blast That rages through the night without, That yon have got no night alarms Or rushing mobs to watch like this.
