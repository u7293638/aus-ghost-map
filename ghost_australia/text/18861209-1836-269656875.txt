' SELECTED POETRY. WHAT HAVE THE YEARS BROUGHT! r What have the years brought ? Empty places Filled with the ghosts of long ago ; Hones dispelled, ami van is lied faces ; lasaions fierce, whose fires bum low* Many fair projects that end in naught The years have brought, the years have brought. Shadows of scenes, and dreams of youth ; Fnemls^that were false, smiles that were Aslies of love, and sparks of the troth. Fading away as the day into night; Many denials of that we had sought The years have brought, the years have brought. Behind the scenes cleared from the stage Sometimes in leisure our memory flits; We live for the present, and run with the age ; But the past on the throne of our me mory sits; Ami many a sorrow with hlcssiDgs fraught The years have brought, the years have brought. W e are sad oâ€™er the properties now in dis The treasures and lumber bidden from We cannot retrace the path if we chose; The curtain has fallen on wrong and on Changes of ihiractcr, changes of thought Uhe years have brought, the years nave brought. Life is school where we learn, to the Experience, the teacher that still leads And happy are they who have chosen the Friend The light of Whose truth on their path way lias shone. And profited by the wise lessons taught, The years have brought, th* years have brought. Let us live in the present, that when it has passed We may calmly look back without any blamo ; W c know that there will come a vacation And a glad joyful welcome at home we may claim, If expricnce gained, and wisdom bought, I he years have brought, the rears have brought.
