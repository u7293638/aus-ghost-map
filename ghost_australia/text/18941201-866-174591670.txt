H e r e is th e g is t of th e r e b u ttin g d c n c e :— Mr- W indsor ssid lio rem em bered th e plaintiff calling on him and com plaining of the advertisement. She inform ed him th a t she was about to b rin g an actioo a gainst the m anager of tho A lexandra T heatre, and th a t her enpe would bo w eakened if the Agt adm itted th o advertisem ent w ithout reference to its libellous tone. H aving known h e r fnthor, an old Preesm an, h e advi6fd hor to avoid quarrelling w ith managers, on whose patronage she d e ­ pended; a t the sam e time he prom ised to look into th o m atter, and said if b e th o u g h t tbe advertisem ent was offensive be would use own discretion, and if he th o u g h t it in her in te rest 1 u would notice it in the u*ual way. A t th a t tim e lie had no knowledge th a t she was bringing an action ag ain st tho Agt. When he read the words for th e first time on the following day th e y did n o t strike him as libel'ous or c allin g for any disclaimer o t the p a rt of the Age. M atthew Wood G reen, in charge of th e advertising departm ent of th e Agt. office, said he told the fiolicitor for the p la in ­ tiff th a t th e proof readers, in passing tb e advertisem ent w ithout calling editorial attention to the words complained of, had evidently regarded them as being an allusion to some song sung by Mies D ay, ig catchy phrases belonging to h e r parts, as such tilings wete fre quently lound in theatrical advertisem ents. M r. J u s tic e C aset, in g iv in g ju d g ­ m ent, Naid th e d e fe n d a n t, w ith o u t alico o r c u lp a b le n e g lig en c e, h a d p u b lish ed an a d v e rtis e m e n t a s a n a n ­ n o u n c em e n t fro m tb o m a n a g e r o f th e th e a tr e t o bis cu sto m e rs. Any person of ordinary intelligence (he continued) would not see a libel in it. T he plaintiff, however, saw a covert in su lt in th e words th a t she would “ take a n ig h t off.” T h at tn i. h t mean the nam e of a new song, especially as it was p u t in conjunction with the nam e of a n o th er p -polar song, “ She is such an artless thing,” o r it m ight mean w h at the plaintiff said i t did mean, th a t she would not bo allowed te p la y that,night. W ithout sing any opinion th a t would reflect action which the plaintiff m ig h t bring a g ain st the person who p u t the a d ­ vertisem ent in the paper, and looking a t it only as it effected th e defendant, be was of opinion th a t the a dvertisem ent was ta k en the ordinary way w ithout m alice, and b an announcem ent which was only capable of the defamatory m eaning a ttr i­ buted to i t when viewed through the plaintiff’s evidence. In these circum stances he did n ottliink tho defendants could be held responsible & verdict would therefore be given 'o r tho defendant with costs.

Only oDe claim w ent into court, and the paper won the ca6e ; tbe other casos “ squared ” a t a c ost of £543. The obtaining of a verdict in th e solitary case adjudicated cost tnftt p ip e r £322. One notoriously bad character who ih rta ten e d the paper, w ithout a ghost of a show of success, had to be bought off a t a cost of nearly £200. Likely enough. N o t one m an in forty who issues a libel-w rit can pay tb e costs if he lores th e case; w beress, when a newspaper loses a case and doesn’t pay up to th e last farthing tho proprietor goes to saol for a year, and even th e n is not (nor can he ever he, except by paym ent) released from his liability.
