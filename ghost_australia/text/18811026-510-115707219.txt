He had a vague idea that when be was sitting «t the table the window was is front of him, and the copying press to bis right. He m not* quite sure about this, but being of a baqrint and Impulsin nature, he aoted upon hUimpraMdonu«ttw«re»oerUinty. 'It UTtU7*]eat,'«aidhe,'thatifthe oopying prett is bere, the table mut be over there.*1 This was, no doubt, a, perfectly oarreetintntnoe to make, and if the premises had been faoltleat, the deduction would have had the logical eppoaiUmeai of a true syllogiam, 'I am hare,11 said Mr. Paroh meat 'therefore the table mast be «rer there.' The major premise was oorrect, but -the minor was evidently impcrteot, for the ooncliuion of the ejUogitm lauded Mr. Parehmnnt't head' through one «f the window panes. For the first time during this trying toene Tom Parchment used a -very big D, but nndet the ejwnmttanwia,t hemaypbadiustinoation.' Wfatle hi 1 head was outside, and ie- felt the invigosating' ?ffMtsof UwooolBtocuinianniflhtalr. Tom had eeriout (houghU of ending his dlffloulliet by (hooting, or» nlimJo:-.' Bing Hie alarm-bell. Jturdot and treason I, .Binqno and Donalbsinl' bnt reflsoting «iat the room^rm only about fifteen feet tfuare, he determined to maks another effort to find that key-or, at least, the table. To guard against any further nitbaps, he determined to etroumnavigate the room, la order to fix the poAdotu of the 4oor and window *n4 any other land mark that would be useful. Aooprdingly he put bis hand carefully along the wall, «od felt his war round to the left, knooldDg over a'olook and an ink-bottle in his progress. Thus .cautiously advancing, he hid nearly completed the drcult of the room when a fresh oatastrophe happened. Eh had forgotten all about the oopying prose until he was forcibly reminded of its ezitt enoe by tumbling orerit aseoona. tune wnere the floor had been rendered slippery by the upsetting of the wator-bottie. As he fell this time, he began a series of forcible remarks, and making a wild grab at the wall to save .himself, he nooesded in bringing down on the top of Ids head a map of the world whioh adorned the offloe. It mutt have been a very rotten map. for Tom's head wont right through it, and came out about the Bargain Bis, in ths North AtUntio Ocean, somewhere between the Ohilf of Mexloo and the ;8tralta of Gib ratter. In the interests of truth we must now acknowledge, that Tom's aversion to ?trong language fairly Jbroke (down. ' He swore, as As iPreneb any, long and large. While his head was atlU through the map he reached out hit left hand, and blasphemed right dowa tbe -m«rf«.n «ontlnent from Alaska in the North, to Oape Horn in the south ; then stretching out his right hand he distributed a stream of mild profanity, from Siberia right through the Desert of Gobi, across Chinese Tartary, over the Fhillipins Islands, New Guinea, Queensland, New South Wales and as he bushed at Mel bourne his land struck— the key he was looking for, whioh was in ths door ail the time. ' Now this adventure of Tom Parchment, although it was very annoying at the time, turned out, as it happened, a very fortunate drounutanoe. If it had not been for the delay thus caused he would have been out of Walker's office a quarter of an hour before. Aa lt was he was just preparing to go out when he heard the familiar voice of Toffy outside talking to someone, who it turned ont was Hooky. They wan going into Hooky's offloe and a kmd of instinct told Parchment that this mysterious oonjunotion of two suoh bright particular stars boded evil to somebody. He therefore remained perfectly quiet, and- presently he beard the striking of a matoh, while » stream of light broke through a ventilator in the wall between the two offioes, which had hitherto been' oouoealed by the map, the downfall of whioh had been the cause of so muoh cursing. ' Tom Parohment was the soul of honour, but he oonriderod himself quite justified in endeavouring to find out what the two conspirators were about ; he therefore used the knowledge of looality acquired Dy nis late invesugaaons *o put his back under the table, and, after the expenditure of an infinite deal of patianoe, he placed it, noiselessly, close against the Wall, underneath the ventilator; and, jinmnHng upon it, he could look into the nest room, and see and hear all that *ras going on. ? . , OHAPTBBHT. j Toic Pabobmwt, bom his taignt iA vantage, could see distinctly everything in Hooky's offlce. It was. very avideat that' then wai an 'unsomfortabls feeling of eon straint between the two men.: Silas Hooky had the appearance of a Man who anticipated an impending evil 1 while Puffy was attempt ing to assume the rile of one ' perfectly at his ease, wbUe he was oobstraineaty nervous, and spumodioallyjolly-or at least, loud. ?: ? ' 'You wifi. pardon me, Mr. Puffy,' said theliwjor, 'if 'I fail to understand the drift of your temarks which, to asy the Uast, «e in quertibnable twto.' - ,: ' ?fy0u don't like them,' said Puffy, drily. . 'I 'don't like thorn, and I don't, under stand them,' retorted Hooky, SavagMyj 'and lot me tall you, onoe for all, that 1|MU pot submit to this assumption of tuperiority ^-your'!*^1 whiohl look upon, as1 an LttapOTGlDBDOO* - ?

However, he ^was not a man to yield without a straggle. He returned onoe more to the charge. ' Alt this may be perfeotly correct,' said he ; ' and yat, as I deny ths charge, it may only tend to' prove that I have been the victim of a base oonspiraar. ' What was to prevent yon from making those hieroglyphics upon which you pboe so much stress, t/ier he bill came into your hands as well as before it left mj office f' ' Certainly , there is something in that; and, if it ware only a question of your oath against mine, I suppose the one is as good, or as bad as the other; bnt the whole sur rounding! of the ease are shady, and the transaction will not bear investigation; more over, I can bring a witness to prove that tefore the bill was known to be in existence, : had made these marks upon a blank form in your offloe.'
