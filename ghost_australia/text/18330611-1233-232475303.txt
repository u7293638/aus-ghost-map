Great anxiety was occasioned in both these .Colonies when the late Act of Parliament was received, io which, by a confusion of terms, arising out of the truly deplorable ignosance in which even die King's Ministers, and of them even the Secretary for the Colonies himself, are now fouiid to be of every thing relative to the real stale of theprop.tr, of whom the latter is the Autocrat. A very intelligent correspondent of ibis journal proved convincingly, in a recent number, that when the words ticket of leave were used by the franiers of the bill in question, they considered the holders thereof as possessing what is f technically called here "an emancipation" —that is, a free patdon, i«s operation confined to the Colonies In endea vouring to ascertain whether (his was really the fact, we have traced the origin of the recent enactment to its source, which we find to he as follow*. The then Attorney General, (now Lord Chief Jiptice of England,) Sir T- Deiimaii, introduced a bill into the House.of Commons for the abolition of the punishment of death in certain cases. This bill passed,—was sent to the Lords, and there encountering much opposition from the Tory Law Lords, Lord Wyntord, (better fcnowo as Serjeant Best,) their organ, effected a sort of compromise with the Administration, by which he was permitted to engraft upon the bill two amendments— the one, thai the judges have no option in passing sentence in the cases formerly punishable by death, but to wllich that dieadful punishment was no longer to attach, fcnt that invariably transportation for hfe ahuuld be-the. sentence de|p-Te leaving its modification only to tbr crowu. The aecond amendment was strongly insisted «pon, in reference to several cases (I key Solomon was adduced in p*rticulst)of receivers of Stolen goods carrying their so acquired property with them to these CdonlrtJ in order to prevent which Lprd Wjnford's arpendmerit went to the effect, that no felon Under sentence oftrvn-portation should either acquire or retain property. These amendments Lord Brougham very un willingly conceded, rather than risk the fate of the whole* bill, avowing openly at the time, that in the next Parliament a freft bill, precisely worded as that then Under consideration, would be introduced. The bill thus amended was sent'back to the Common*, wh<) refuted to.agree to Lord IVinfonfs amendments, and,having rejected them, sent back tbe Mil in Hs(original state lotlie Lords. Oh the 9tb day - of July, 1832,'the billwas again introduce what passed on that occasion may be fouiid in all the Journals of ihe following dayr • We cojiy from the Time's: — : w Houseof Lords, july 9,1832.— Puniihmtnl of Veuth /ftimitiun Bill—- On the Orikr of the Day for the con sidcration of the reasons of the Commons for refusing to agree to the Lords* emmdments. in the iiiil jor Abolishing; the Punishment of Death in certain cases, being read, Lord IVynfnrd who had proposed the amf/idmtfits, now meant to propose to their Lordships, resolutions htshthrg CM the first and last, of, these amendments. The abolition of the punts/intent of death extende < to casts Of private s'eating in a duelling house, anil of stealing horse's and shrep. and he insisted that this spe cies of property would be left without protectionif the punivhnent of death afire abolished, without sabstitatiwg the sefrrest secondary pumshmtnt. The liifl ps it cimefrom the Common», had enabled Magistrates as wtl! as the superior Judges, io sentence to Carious p tioils o/ transportation and imprisuuwint.;. and he hod proposed the amendiiuni^ thai ; the senttnce should invariably be ttanspQrtiition lor fife, leaving it io : th.-. t'roupi to modijy the sevtmce,. where that might appeal proper. He had pro pn*t4 the re-enactment of the old law, by u-hicJrfet 'Tisi under sentence of trans por'tqiion should neither acquire nvr retain property. and /his hr proposed to insist upon, and he meant also to insist on giving a le^tslatire sanctum to certain regulations made by Gtntrul Darling for New South Wutes. 'Ihe regulations utre, that felons Iransportta for seven years, ihnuld not hare their tk kets of leave, o*, in ether words, be pa.doned, until they have served Jour year's. That tJtote transported tor .fourteen years should not have their tickets of leave .till they had served six years, and that those transported for life shoultl not have thetrticke s oj leni'e till they had served eight year*. These regulations had been attended will the best results, and he had pi iqwted to make th em binding on other (iovern&rs.; ant! to txttnd them to J'an Diemen's Land Ajhr a few tsnrds from Lord 1 acre and the Dnke of Wellington, the question teas put on the resolution, that the Lends insist on the amendments in the clause of the Bill The. Lord Chancellor put the question on thefirst amendment, to which tfuir Lordships gore their assent for pe steering in it, as they did for perseveiing in the last, negativing th: other*." ' The compromise thus made, the bill was sent back to the Commons ; and on the 11 tli July Sir Thomas Dennan explained bis reasons for acceding to Lord Wynford's two amendments, as w« bav< staled, that he would not risk the fate of the bill at that the last roomeut of the session, but that in the next he teould introduce another in its original jorm. The bill was passed, and received tlu- Koyal Assent accordingly. Now, then, here we have the whole matter. What are Lord WynfoM'.- words ? Had he foreseen the difficulties' which the icnoratice of the meaning of terms, as colonially. applied, would havt created in these Coloniea,he could iioi belter have afforded a clue to his real intentions,or belter eipressed himself to shew what CONSTRUCTION he intended should be put upon his enactments: What are liis words?—Frlojis- trpni jtortedfor seven years should not have tickets of leavet ou «N otuck wohd& Bt rABnoniD, tmlil they Aatt ierted four years !" V " Here h afforded a perfect expftaniftion of the whole. Tire term ticket of leave is here proved to have treeo-. confounded whhthe termmwnri/MrfiOTiand , Lord Wynford's law wsts obviously in teuded to prevent the granting sueb until the limes fixed in the Government Regiitat'r.ms shall have actually expired not as before to leave the opiion with he Governors, but to deprive tbetn thereof, and to prevent the mercy ST the crown from-flawing-,-iiHtFr aftei' certain ; prescribed periods. Bis proposed amendment to that effect, so monslrotts in itself, he gave up rn the compromise of allowiug his two others • to stand, and the act passed accordingly in - its present utterly unintelligible shape.' 1 „ _ There can be no doubt but that, independent of the explanations and remonstrances wbieV Irave been treiisiiiitted By the Governors of botlr Colonies, as to the injurious eonnee}>iencei> of Lord 'Wjbfoid's amendments" being taken in tbe acceptation in which their literil.ffading would tend to give, tlval Ministers haye long before this carried through the Reformed Parliament their original law, whfcb wilt do> away wiili the inoiisirotis absurdity of giving a man a solemn instrument, tn which he h de clared tobetherehy privileged to employ himself far bis own benefitr while a law is sanl to exist in which that very bem-ftt is declared to be impossible to be pos aessed. How easily, however, is the incongruity done away with, by reference ti» L»rd Wynford's words! An inrcon grufry which il is impossible any legislators, let their ignorance be ever so extremp, (as we admit that of tire British Parliament le» be of eierj tbi/ig connetted with these Colonies,) could h ive ever intended to have created, by the ; solemn measure of a law I But Lord nford has particularly sliewii that none suah really existed. It was obviir-tly lirs understanding of the Iterm tidiet of leave," that if not .an actual pardon, it had fully the effect of one, and therefore he said, speaking of that class, "in otwer words be parb»»£D." His Excellency LienteiMrrt ^Governor Arthur has exhibited m tbi* instance another, and a most humane and eon siderate proof, of the caution with" whiich he brings British legislation iMo operation hire. 1b New South Watfes Hie moment Ihe Act of Parliament was received it was imrnediately promulgated, in the full plenitude of its absurdity. Not sohere. Lieut. Governor Arthur, in the exercise of a most wise and considt rate discretion, has withheld the official notification of this British blundering, and, as no do>ubt be was aware of of the intentions of Ministers, that the original "Abolition of the Puuishment of Death Act " should be passed as it was originally framed,- be bas paused until he receives information tllfreup'in, and there cannot be a doubt that at' this moment fjord Wynford's miserable claases, which have created so much alqrm and confusion, are no longer in existence.

How then stands the present The order in question consists, likean Act of Parliament, of preamble and enacting part. The latter alone conveys the law, the former conveys tbe causes for its adoption. What is the enacting part of the order in question ? The words are, •* If, after this notification, a convict shall be discovered to hav« written any article for a Newspaper he shall be sent'to a Penal Set'Iement." Wow, what-evidence liad tlre Magistrates before tliein to bear then? out in even entertaining for a moment, the charge against Mr. Savery; but certainly nut of finding him guilty of violating the GovernmentOrd. r. * He accused of writing is not even in the Tasniunian, and yet to unite is tlie whole offence provided against by the Order ! This appeared at first .to slrjke the Magistrates so -forcibly -that they paused ; jiut Mr. Geltibrand, with iufiiiite tac', diverted the Question from the real point, whether the charge was supportable nnder the Order, to a very different one, by whom the charge teas prepared, and under the smoke of this fire he boarded, and ultimately siicceedi-d in his attack. It certainly appeared nxtsl strange to many of the auditors, that Mr. Savery did not press this point strongly upon the Magistrates. He seemed so paralized by tbe superiority of force of his attarbing enemy, that ha** Mr. Gellibrand insisted upon it, in his full porter of words, that nnder tbe Order, Mr. Savery could have been found guilty of an offence in reading the newspaper, he wonht h ive applied himself rather to disprove the fact, tbau to the relevancy <>f the charge. But the Magistrates liavingentertained the charge, bow was it supported ? Was there one tittle of evidence adduced to prove eAen the slightest violation of the Order ? N it the ghost of such !

Ti,e fact was, MtijBelii brand carried all before hiii4, and by most skil fully, diverting the real atlavk, as has been freqn ntly the casein wai, tbe false attack succeeded. Again. We venture to submit that the order, the charge, and the evitleiice, duly considered, Mr. Savery was fully entitled, in the possession of his ticket of leave, to have "justified " according to the legal phrase, his so employing himself. We quite remember Mr. I.ascelles' evidence, and far be it from us to justify the folly of Sir. Savery, in uttering any vapouring expressions of annoyance to Me. Gor ton. Mere vapour as it waa,f0r how stood the fact at the time! When he was talking of doing more, he bad in fact done nothing! the offensive article having been not only not written by biin, but by Dr. Richards, who, as we underst..nd, never courted concealment! li wotrfd have been most improper for Mr. Savery to have written such an article. Mr." Gordon is the oldest magistrate of Ihe Island,,and sucb .au attack from Mr. Savery wouM have been, to say tire very least, in very bad taste. TIius then it is strangely inconsistent with the fact, the vapouring with Mr. Lascelles. Jlad Mr. Savery limited his explanations with lhat gentleman, to the fact, that he hsd the superintendence of Mr. Melville's whole printing office—his three journals —nay even tbe very " Trump, included—who shall say that the order. No. 41, would have been thereby vio. lated ! The Courier very ably comments upon the nature of the employment to which persons such as Mr* Savery can alone turn lhem any thing, even by the iitmost of all pn,. sible constructions, in the slightest degree at variance with the 𝑠𝑝𝑖𝑟𝑖𝑡 itself of •Nov 4l;ti>at. pw^te*' fyfiftinp.riiiefV^f.
