Ihe height from flooi tc ceiling in principal rooms throughout average 20 feet . ihe rooms are thoroughly ventilated with patent opcu and shut vents ihe foi mal_ opening was celebiated by a dinner, at which there was a large attend ance of both clergy and laity, ampngst the former being the Aiolibiahop of Melbourne Prior to the duiuer the guests assembled in a room in the ongiual building, where they were formally welcomed by the bishop and Father Reffo, the principal of the College, ihe former said.—“ My Lord .Archbishop, on behalf of myself, Fathei Reffe, and the Fathers of the Holy Ghost, and also ou be half of the priests aud people of my diocese, I return yom Grace our sincere and grateful thanks for kmaiy coming to the maugura tiou oeiemony to day, knowing that your duties at the present time are both onerous and pressing, the compliment you have paid us by favoimg us with your piesence is en hanced, and we feel greatly indebted to yum Grace f r such kindness ” The bishop then delivered the following adihess—“loan say without exvggeratiou that the presence here to day of so many dis tuiguished visitors, who have come to grace ourmauguial function, affords me the live best pleasuie. I beg to thank you all most sinceiely, aud toassuieyou that in accept ing the invitation of the Veiy Reverend Dr Reffe you hive likewise pud me a compli ment, which I gratefully acknowledge It would be vain for me to attempt to conceal the mingled feelings of pride aud pleasure which 1 experience outlie pi esent occasion. In the opening of this college to day I see revlised at length a hope w Inch I cherished for yeais Today it open*, with every befitting circumstance and under the bright est auspices From this day imward I -.halt have the happiness of knowing th it within this diocese we have made ample provision to affoid our boys a thoiough and finished ednea tion Our primary schools are in the hands of excellent trained teachers Die Clmsti in Brothers heie, as well as elsewhere, keep well up to the standard of their institute, which, as you know, is very high pruse Yet until now a margin—aud that a veiy important m irgm—of the field of education remained almost, if not wholly unoccupied Indeed, had we contented ou elves with appearances, we could have sup plied th s waut cie now aftei a fashion But we felt it due to the temporal well being and the spiritual safety of our boys, to save them fioni the demoralising influence of feeble and hollow- Gaining \\\ e chose rather to woikou anil wait until we should be m a position to offer them sound educa cation. I do not entertain the slightest doubt that this college will very soon prove itself vv'oith all our labor and anxiety, worth more than it has cost to bring it into existence lam very s inguine of its complete success, and I think that 1 cannot be fir wioug, for 1 am lollow mg the lead of facts Iho«e facts are not unknown to you any longer The results achieved in the various blanches of the higher studies at the B< ickrock Col lege under the Fathers of the Holy Ghost bear eloquent testimony to tile supeiionty' of their teaching Indeed, it would Le high praise for any ot the richly endowed oollet.es to have scored such a run of brilliant vie tones But when we see the fatheis left to their own tesourccs, and entering the lists with wealthy and tune honored institutions, vvluse professors are men of really eminent scho'aislup, their tiiumphs must be asenbed to quite superior methods of lustiuctiou cal ned out with uni emitting diligence F vther Reffe uid his devoted biother pne«ts cany with them to this new .foundation the same approved system ind the same labor loving spmt th vt made the leputatmn of Blaokn ck In a shirt time you will hear of results similar to those registered to Father Rcffe’s crvdit thiough Gieat Bntaur and Ireland As I am now ou the subject of education you will penult me to notice certain re pro tches which Secularists seek to fasten on us; and by dint of repi tition they have conn, I dare siy, to be accepted by a credulous public \Ve are upbraided with earing nothing for the spievd of education amongst the people, we lie taxed with hostility to the ptogiess of enlightenment, we are said to coeice our peoph into sup poiting denominational schools, and to deter them against thm judgment aud wish from aval mg of the free Stile education, which in fact they piy for Ihese broad insertions ire vuy commonly rcpcat»d in the columns of the Secularist pi css, and, of course, they l si und very plausible to men v.hose uuctci ite piejudices prepire them for any accu- itinn against the Catho he Ghuich Now let us test these asset lions by the light > fa few facts The priests aie iccUscd of coeicing the luty Well, then, Cithohcs must be \ery much less th in men if they act in this mattei iguust their better judgment For see what it costs tin m Within the 1 i-t yen in this diocese of Balluat the mninten nice of pti may scnools ilom has cost the Catholics no less thm £O5OO They piy, at Icvst, this aimu illy to suppoit v\hat they are slid to condemn, nid they a’so piy their sh ue foi the suppoit of the Stite schools, whese ai vintages they foieg > in eieiy po-sihlc c i»o Remember, that the Catholic popul itiuu is not very much above 30,000, moreover, very many f unities in the couutiy places are so far apart from other Catholics th it the suppoit of a Catholic school is out of then pmer Hence the £6500 is met aimu illy by onlv i portion of the total population of 30,000 But wherevir they ne m sufficient numbers they need no spin from the pnosts I gladly bear this test! mimy to the spirit and liberality of our people Now foi the higher education ibis college, as you now see it, repies nts an outlay, within little over one year, of £l2 000 In the same time I have paid away £6BOO in oi dei to establisl too other centies of luterinediate ulucvtion And just now we have signed conti vets to the amount of £4500 foi educational pm poses exclusively So that, in one yiar, this young dioc ■ of Baffin at, with aOvtholic population of some .10 000, has hvd an outlay of at least' £27 800, defraved by the voluntary contn buttons of the luty, the cleipy, and myself, and all for education. With such facts as these to support us, I think we may calmly dismiss the vague and biselcss dialges, to which 1 have called your attention. .We are-most anxious to have ouc-people edu cated and fully equippedlor the hard battle of life. We desire to see them grow up m the full enjoyment of those priceless advan tages which are the-fruitof enlightenment We are aht e to the fact that in these and ly s of Ucyi and knowing “competition the odds are heavv agunst the umnstiucted.

It is our pride and our duty to keep their nnselflsh spirit alive and to teach it to those who shall succeed us Monsignor (Dean) Hoyiie then read an address to Father Reffe, the principal of the college, from the priests of the diocese. It expressed pleasuie it S'eing the college erected, and at having one of F ither Riff-’a attainments and scholarship at its head Reference was made to the principal’s success at the BKckrnck College, and the distinc tious iclueved by Ins pupils there The address also spoke of F ither Reffe’s geniality and kindly qn ihties, which had dready en deired Inin to his brethren here In conclu sum, Monsignor Hoyne piesented Father Reffe with £1132 contributed by the pnests of the diocese Father Reffe, in responding, thanked the priests for their kindly references to him and for their gift of money He lemarked that he felt deeply the re-ponsibilities he hud assumed Ihework he had entered upon was i Tccedmglj great and arduous If the college was to he the grand success they were all so eigci to behold, it would requite much mxious care and difficult work on the part of all connected with it In the face of such assistance as h id been given and pimmsed, however, he would be no man if he avvervut from the task bcfoie him This work, though one of such magni tude, must, with such insist ino“, go on and prosper. It was needless for himtospeik to those pi i sent at length upon the need for higher education, but he could not refrun from some remarks It must exert a greit influence on the future history of this greit land But the higher educatiou of the mind was not all that was aimed at by them, nor all that vv is nece-sary. The college, he remarked, h id higher aims in view—the maintenance of the imperilled rights of Catholics, and the vmdic itiou of their just pretensions. He continued “The time has come, and I am glad you feel it, when Catholics, unless they have resigned themselves to be jostled out of the race of progiess, unless they have resigned themselves to be the flouted .ictims of every bidder for public favor who may look upon it as his interest to condemn them to obscurity and hardship, must send f mvard men to light foi them who, to ill the gifts of natuie, have carefully supeiadded every aptitude for battle which the fullest and the highest educ itiou can bestow. In this pirt of the globe, as is allowed to be' the case in eveiy other, education is the force which must be put into opeialiou to resist the growing prevalence of wrong and falsehood \Ve are living in an age which all the world over is pre eminently an age of intellectual aud moril conflict, and in such an age every man who would be qualified to make his mark—every man who would desire to render himself capable of striking a success ful blow for justice, houui, truth, or fiee dom, must hive a sword to wield, and must be trained to wield it with advantage It is education that must foitify the citadels of morality and tiuth; it is education which must multiply the champions of religion and pnuc pic, w Inch must louse them irom the peiilous seennty of fancied pence, which must marsh and and equip and lead them into the held The enemies of the church ire ivvare of this, and strenuously endcavoi to make of it a most effective engine fur the furthciauce of their worst and most ne fauous pmpuscs E lucitiun, nmtil ited and degraded b\ being divorced from religion, which gives it Us refining and ennobling power, has become the blight and curse of many hinds, it thieateustu become the curse of tin-; to some extent you know that it h is already become so. There is a melancholy sameness in the methods of impiety, in tolerance and oppi c-sion in every age and clime which they have tainted and dis graced Ever since that day when our Divine Redeemer blessed the little outs, and pronounced resemblance to them a condition of onr fitness for His kingdom, it has been the constant aim of His assail nits, the constmt aim of those who hate Himself, beciuse they will not bend their minds and hearts into a pructicil compliance with His to idling, to dcfico the moral beauty which He pi .used, and frustrate ill endeivors to itstoie it; they every wheie hive Ivbored, and are laboring still with an amazing energy and puseverance, to e\ tend and to perpetu ite their influence by miking of the ‘bad boy the f ither of the bid min,’by sowing in the youthful mind the fital germs which, fostered by the succours of a soil and air propitious to their grow th, may eventually fill the world with the worst and bitterest fruits ofanirchy aud lueligion Bid education has thus been eveiyvvhere employed to bring about that self abisemcnt which is known ‘ to pive the vv ly for vilhau’s bond ind despot’s svv ay ’ Shackle the intelligence, or blind it as a preparation to your fettering the limbs, hiving ever b-en >i piimiry motto in the ritual of tyi limy. It has been the baneful igency employed to temper the unholy mix ture out of which were to be fashioned the oppressor and the bondsman, as it has been used both to distil aud to commend to the un suspicious lips the horublc transforming dose which m ikes it put to sleep an angel, wake a reckless and unbudled libertine It is active in this conn try at this hour; its mischievous dev ice is at this hour a blot upon the statute book which pi ides itself upon containing nothing out of keeping with the claims of liberty and justice It has taken measures tovvarns entrammeling Catholicism, and we knowhow often this Ins been a prelude to disfranchising and fettering the Catholic. It is against this thing of evil we arc culled on to make war We know it to have been v ic* touous elsewhcie, it is elsewhere duly chanting its insulting poem, its couise has been i course of tiiumph almost even w here but where the faith and chivalry of Ireland have been the foes that flung into the breioh against it Such ire the forces th it are here opposed to it, and so I trust the issue is to he the snne as it has been on evuy bittlefield where the»c in tagomsts have nieisured swords It is a struggle in which everyone of ns must joy to h ive a share It is a struggle in which I, for one, im proud to be a partaker, and to vv Inch my time and toil sh ill be ungi udgmgly devoted (Appluise ) Whilst the hosts of Zn>n aie of such nnqnest.on ibly sterling metal as my shoi t s< join n amongst them has sufficient to nuke me deem them, and when th it valor is directed by -mc'i leaders as the two whose goodness his c impelled them to gi ice tins meeting vv ith their pi esence o in hav e little doubt that tfievictory will be iesolved into Bnallv declaiiug for the cross and the sh unlock ” (Applause ) Aiohbishop Cm bnefly cx|re»sed Ins pleasuie at bung pie-.ent and at seeing Either Reffe at the head of the colh ge He wished him ind the fithers i-sou ited w ith him eveiy success in the woik they had undert iken (Applause) The Dinner was Ind out in the large diningroom, where Mr M‘Kenzo had provided a most snbstan till and choice repist Fither Reffe occu pied the chair, and hid on his right hand the -vrchhi'liop of Melbourne, Mr C ghlin, KSG, Monsignor Hoyne, and Father OFmcl', while on Ins lift hind vveie the Bishop of Ballarat, Mr D. Brophy, KSG, Mr G G Minton ind Pi lor Butler Messrs Biophv and C'ghlan wore fun crosses of the order of Knights of St Gregory, con feircd on them by Leo XIII , for the fiist time The churn an pioposed as the first toast, “ His Grace the Archbishop of Melbourne ” Heiemuikcd tint the Aichbndiop came in the name of Citholic education, which they knew was dt ir to his hcait. He never celled to uphold the Catholic claims in this icspect When the news that Dr Carr Ind be-n called from 1)11111111 to Melbourne theie was sonovv tlnough lielmid but joy tinoitgh Austidn What wus lieland’s loss wa-. Australia’s gum Aichbishop Cm, lit responding, said he had 'come with a twofold pur p ose — as a person il pleasuie, and to murk Ins sympathy’ with the education that hud been so nobly advocaled by the Bishop of B illamt and the clergy of Ins dio cese But he had had a third uasou fur coming—he thought he saw a clear mdica tion of a desire on the part of one Jiencin to trausfer the seat of intellectual cultuie from Melbourne-to Ballarat. (Laugnter ) '—He bad come to investigate, the matter, and to make bia protest against that person’s attempts (Renewed laughter.) He had met their loved bishop at the celebration of the jubilee of their Holy Father, and there the bishop had formed the idea’ of selecting that which was most spintu i), holy, and intellectual in their church, and transferring it to Ballarat And he went about his work philosophically He had regard to the three wants of the people of his diocese —bodily, intellectual,and spirits il —and determined to supply them The . first he did by securing a number of Sisters ■ of Nazareth; the second by several fathers of the order of Holy Ghost; >and the third by a community of Redemptonst Fathers (Loud applause ) He had succeeded ad mirably in Ins efforts. He (the spe iker) remembered when first the fathers of the Holy Ghost were introduced into Ireland, and the speculations about them The results of the hrst examination ueie feared, yet the students at the Catholic C'd leoe secured high honors This success was continued and improved on up to the present time. He was sure that the BUckrook Col lege contributed its own share to the sm-cess of the Catholic ColUges in Ireland. Be rejoiced that the gentleman who hid done such good work ns principal of that col lege was to preside over this college. He was glad to see tney had made piovision for the combination of educa tion and religion, which vv is education in its proper sense. If moral principles were left out of sight, and the attitude towards the Creator not noticed, it was not proper education (Applause) Thespeiker then referred to the meeting held on the previous evening with reference to the intro duction into State schools of Bible reidings All the speakers there, he remarked, agieed that education without religion was worth less. One of the speakers, with more force than good taste, sudthat the present scheme was favorable to Citholics, or, as he put it, to Rom ins. He did not expect this from a man of education or refined feelings, such as the speaker. (Applause) It was unworthy coming from v gentleman occupying the post lion the speaker did. He ought to know that the Catholic church did not object to ielding the Scriptures, tint it was through the dim eh th it the Scripture cvme down from past ages, and that the dim eh regarded them just as sacredly isanyom It regarded them, however, as the repository, not the origin, of truth, and that they should not be interpreted by every personof igeor learning, but by the church which Christ had set up to interpret them The Catholics believed that men should be hi ought to know the truth by the agency of that which Christ had appointed to teach That was the rea son why Catholics could not join in the agitation for the introduction of the Bible into Stite schools, because if they did, they would fall in with what was alien to the teachings of the Church They could never consent that the bible should be placed into the hands of clnldien, to be allowed to form then own ideas as to the religion taught in it The aichbishop then refeired to the pleasure that Ins visit gave him, and I to the pleasure he felt at the niaugmatinn j of the college He expressed Ins aident wish that it was the opening of a gieit career of progress, ami that it would form anew centre of intellectual culture fur the future geneialions of Australian children— the ways ind means of education tint would (it them for every position in this life and for then immortal destiny. (Loud applause ) The Chairman next proposed the to ist of “The Founder of the Colhge, the Bishop of Ballarat.” He lemarked that if evci a ship had been launched under favorable auspices; if ever a college was founded with a gn i rantee of success, this one was. In loving and eh quent terms he spoke of the bishop’s ; beneficence and care for Ins flock. He con sideied that they should be proud of such a leader, and follow him (Applause ) Ihe bishop, in responding, cxpiessed Ins pleasure at seeing the college open It was v day on which he saw the icalisition 81 ins hopes He had a priesthood of winch any bishop might be pioud. Ho had never asked them for anything that they had re fused. He was sure, also, the 1 nty would come forward and do as they had previously done. (Applause ) He was glad to see the favorable impression Fathei Reffe had creited Surely the co operation of such a priesthood and laity as he had must lead to success. (Loud applvuse) The following toasts were also honored, all being proposed by the ch nrman, the speeches in connection with which space will nut permit of our icportuig —“ ihe Secular Priests,” responded to by Dean Hoy no, “ Hie Regular Priest",” responded to by Father O'Farrell and Prior Butler; " The Laymen,” responded to by Messrs D Biophy and Cughbvn, K’s S G , the furnn r of whom said he was ccitani the laity would liberally lespond to the appeal made by the bishop; 11 Mr G. G Moiton,” responded to by that gentleman. Aichbishop Cirr, in a neat and compli mentiry speech, proposed “The Health of the Chairm in," to which F ither Reffe suit ibly and feelingly responded. The proceedings, which were opened with religious ceiemomes, were closed in a sum lar manner
