TO THE EDITOB OP THE 'DAILY TELEGfiAl'H.' Sii? — In Novem ber. .1879, myself and family were sitting round our dining- room fire talking, when we distinctly heard a vehicle gtop opposite our house, and some one open our gate and wait up the garden path. I went out to the hall door myself, and there, under the portico, I saw an old friend of mine, whom I then thought to be in India, and he was standing with a paper in his right hand ; but before I could even speak he faded gradually away. The Bhock of seeing his ghost prostrated me for some days. 1^ mutually it turned out that he dropped down dead that very hour, and with that paper in his right hand. A stranger story of ghosts I would not like to realise, and though I firmly believe many etrange noises are mere suppositions and imaginative nervous people fancy they see apparitions, I can truly say I ea*w a ghost. — I enclose my card, and beg to subscribe myself, yours, &e.;, Anothse Ghost. 17, Camden-road.U.W., Oct. 12.
