A CASE OF RESURRECTION. The following story is told in the Era : â€”"In Thurgau, Switzerland, the body of a man was found, and it was supposed that death had been the result of foul play. But the medical men declared that the wounds were self-inflicted, and that the deceased must have committed suicide. The body was identified by a large number of relatives, as well as by sawyers with .whom deceased had worked, as having belonged in life to one Baume ler, a sawyer, of Lucerne. His kinsfolk followed him to the grave, put on mourn ing for him, and the local papers pub lished notices of the dead man. On the evening after the interment, while number of Baumeler's friends were mak ing merry in the village inn, who should walk in among them but the dead man himself ? The peasants dropped their tankards of lager, and stared at the ghost in dismay. Some took to their heels in fright, and, run ning home, barricaded their doors. The ghost quietly took his seat at a table, and ordered sausages, bread, and lager in large quantities, and his meal being finished, went straight to the priest, and thanked him for the eloquent oration he had delivered over his grave. He then called upon the head man of the dis trict, and expressed his obligations for the trouble taken on his behalf. So far, the ghost showed himself to be amiably in clined, but his mood changed upon look ing down the columns of a load paper, which contained an obituary notice of the deceased couched in not exactly compli mentary terms. The ghost, whose repu tation during lifetime wasreally somewhat shady, seeing his chance, intends to bring an action for libel against the editor, who forgot to state in the obituary notice that deceased was a representative of all the virtues. The circumstance of a live ghost walking about, and contemplating law proceedings, has thrown the village into a state of great excitement."
