COMMON-SENSE IN SPECULATIVE INQUIRY. " Semper ego auditor maintain a Niinquamne re Thomas yexaflis totters " In spite of the frequent remark that common sense is the nu est of senses, we may yet maintain that it is still HIL main guide of our lives and actions The rule is so general that the exceptions alone excite attention, and give rise to the cynical epigram In most matters where Right reason is of immediate and practical no portance, and where the bad effects of personal bias or aberration are promptly in evidence, common sense holds sway In the large field of commerce, for in stance, men have an intense (if unconscious) regard for, and habitually insist on a rigid application of logical method It they relax their strict system of inference, if they allow themselves to be persuaded against their better judgment, if they yield to the insidious fever of the prevailing boom, and shut their eyes for the moment to the conclusions to which the dry light of pure reason has pointed, the penalty is speedy and heavy Die disease works its own remedy by destroying all those who are subject to it A busy merchant is a strictly logical machine His day is spent in drawing inter ences, with a rapidity which is so astonish- ing as to make the process seem in structive, from data of the most varied and complex character He says the false from the true, the bare fact from the plausible presentation, the plain unvarnished tale from the concoction which is intended to deceive me as applying all day long the practical syllogism in full con seriousness that if there is an error in his premises, or if the conclusion is not legion lately drawn, his pocket will promptly and inevitably register the fallacy He is, there fore, in so far as he is successful the embodiment of common sense which is nothing more than pure reason, unclouded by personal bias the " sense which is common to all when under ideal non sense is eliminated Ot consider the scientific inquirer He is engaged in ascertaining and classifying facts and in drawing correct inferences from them, ? e in discovering the true explanation of the occurrence. His mind is ever open to fresh considerations one single new fact may reverse the opinion of a life time And if parental affection for some pet theory, or a personal desire to support some special school of thought, leads him to attach undue weight to one set of facts and to detract from the consequences of another he is, so far, unscientific, and weakens the force of his authority A scientific man who shows bias can only guide those who are already determined to follow him In every department of practical life we may trace the same method at work in a more or less perfect form 'Die lawyer does not admit a falling into his argument unless he thinks he can trust to his skill in concealing it The farmer does not sow his field on the anniversary of his wedding regardless of the weather, nor does he decide when to sell by the date on which I aster falls, regardless of the state of the market Trams are not run (at least not on commercial railways) at hours when there can be few passengers no one, in order to make money, buys dear and sells cheap, if he can help it. The schoolmaster who wishes to increase In a numbers does not confine his curriculum to the study of 1 Egyptian hieroglyphics but draws it up to meet the requirements of the day Ministry, unless riding for a fall, does not bring forward a policy known to be ac ceptable only to a minority Aman with a prospective income of £4 a week does not rent a house at £2 AN hen any of these things happen we all cry out that there is a want of common sense somewhere, and its effects are not long in making themselves felt AN here however, we turn to the field of speculative inquiry in which we may include for the purposes of this article not only doctrines and opinions which are " incapable of scientific investigation, analysts, or demon stration, but also subjects, such as political economy, which do not readily admit of experiment, but have to be treated by the deductive or historical methods-tbeu_we find the ordinary rules of evidence and reason laid aside as useless encumbrances, and any one who attempts to advocate their cause derided as a " crank or self complacent idiot The same man who in office hours is a strict and rigid thinker, when in hebdomadal routine he turns his attention to matters speculative, is ready to swallow wholesale doctrines, opinions, and statements which, if they affected his business, he would in strictly subject to rigid scrutiny, such us is now practically exercised only by a minority who have learnt that every department of human knowledge is to be taken on its merits, and that none has a prescriptive i right to unquestioned acceptance One cause of this is not far to seek The effects of being wrong or right in speculative beliefs me not of immediate occurrence AN hat is the value of holding a sound view of the future existence of dogs compared with a sound estimate of the value of a certain investment or of the effects of a certain policy ' in the one case a fallacy may never be discovered in the other the result cannot be delayed beyond a few short months was state of things is much to be regretted For the ultimate well being of society truth in speculation is fully as mi portant as truth in scientific and practical affairs And there can be little doubt that it men had always applied to their political and speculative opinions the same hard common sense that they have exhibited in commerce, science, and everyday life, the world would be several centuries in advance of where it is In taking a few examples to illustrate our meaning the water must deprecate any sup position that he is setting up his own ideas of the guiding of common sense as necessary j correct Die instances are merely given as subjects on which each mdiv ideal is not only at liberty, but is bound by the law s of intellectual honour, to exercise his own judgment as far as possible without bias in accordance with such powers of reason as belong to him A writer who sets himself up as a leader of speculative opinion in some directions and who, we may own without [prejudice, appears fully qualified for the apostle ship as far as literary qualities go tells us that we must believe that the great artistic geniuses of history were inspired Now, here we think that common sense would want a definition (as exact as possible) of inspiration As ordinarily understood it would mean that some outside intelligent supernatural influence breathed into the artist the ideas (if not the details of execution which he embodies in his production We put in the words intelligent and supernatural' because we can hardly think that our writer holds that a play based on an actual dramatic occurrence in real life or music purely imitative in its character could properly be called in his sense inspired It is in this latter sense that newspaper paragraphs are sometimes said to be in spired or this article might be inspired by a long course of illogical sermons and maga- some articles Taking, then, the above definition of in spiration, let us see how the idea works out For that is the prompt demand of common sense. Let us take Beethoven, who, as far as the present writers idiosyncrasy goes, demands as much stupendous reverence as any genius in time, as much, in fact, as Marshall Hall can instant, and more And let us take the 2nd movement in the 5th Sj phony, which is as sublime a conception as ever artists mind begat Good fortune happens to have given us record of the way in which Beethoven worked by preserving the rough notes from which this marvellous result was finally elaborated The leading subject in the shape in which it first occurred to the composers mind was of a most elementary eli fracture of i 1 and that anyone could hit upon common place and unpromising and it was only licked into shape after many trials and alterations the various developments of which are on record, each an improvement on the preceding It may be true, as we certainly believe it is, that no one except Beethoven could have obtained the same result out of the same materials But the point that we wish to make is that it is very hard to reasonably introduce " inspiration " into a method of this character Setting aside the supposition of direct inspiration of each bar and chord which is hardest of all to accept, how can even the main outline or theme be considered of supernatural origin when it was only the outcome of continuous human toil, starting from a point which was neither sublime nor even distinguished At what point does the inspiration comments ' At the 2nd, 4th, 5th or penultimate stage of development' Or is the claim to inspira- tion only reached with the final exquisite realisation ' In that case it seems decidedly unfair to give all the credit to inspiration instead otto the previous mental effort lia man totally ignorant of musical science, and without a particle of music in his soul, ' were to sit down and write out the score of mi elaborate s) motion) of the first order of excellence, we might begin to believe in his inspiration But when the claim is put forward on behalf of the productions of a man who was born with a strong bent towards music, and passed through a long course of study and development (distinctly traceable throughout his compositions), then we think that common sense would require much stronger evidence than is brought forward before admitting him to be something more than man Space necessarily confines us to the consideration of only one form and one instance of genius It would be an easy task to carry out the same line of argument in other branches of art from Homer to Browning, premising out) that the details in each case require to be known before any) opinion eau fair!) be formed Again, to take an illustration trivial in itself, but strongly to picul of the illogical attitude we wish to combat, the existence in dogs of the noble quality of disinterested affection is supposed to prove against all possibility, of contradiction that dogs have an after life We own to a deep regard for dogs though not quite so deep as for Beethoven-and if the after his were any good to them and it were in our power to grant it; it would be theirs But let us test the position by the ordinary canons From the existence of a feeling in itself can only he drawings) the facto! its existence, (b) the inference that the feeling had a cause We mean, of course, in the long age of the schools, efficient cause ' f t he final cause in this case, no doubt, is that Grief may make more delicious fun of us ) 'J he conclusion that such a cause is the possession of a soul is arrived at by analogy from human beings, who also exhibit dism crested affection, and have souls The real crux then he's in the question whether the possession of noble and unselfish emotions by man proves his future existence, and what we want is something to show that the existence of such feelings can only be accounted for by the hypothesis of the Supernatural soul. 1 or if, for instance, any good reasons could be brought forward for concluding that our emotions (including the highest) have been natur lily evolved from the environment of social existence, then the hypothesis of a soul as the cause becomes very doubtful, for we hold that it would be common sense to prefer a natural explanation of a phenomenon, wheliollcrcd, to a supernatural There may or may not be, sufficient evidence to induce belief in a natural origin of emotion, but we submit that until such evidence has been fully examined (and if inadequate, discarded) no supernatural hypothesis can logically been termed Common sense might also fairly argue in more simple fashion as follows If the exhibit tion of noble emotions proves an alter his, the possession of base and degraded feelings ought to prove the doctrine of annihilation And it, as often happens, an individual is composed of a mixture of the noble and the base, he ought to pass futurity somewhere between being and not being, unless his per sought) can be split up, and part perish while part lives on Then there is the belief in ghosts Ghosts always have the decency to appear draped, and tina draper) ought to make any man pause before accepting the ghost Have cast off clothes or winding sheets also an after life ' Or is there a ghostly) tailor who fits the shade with its impalpable habits ments " From the pulpit let us take one broad illus tration Whenever any matter) is being discussed of unusual difficulty we are invariably) told that there are some things into which we must not inquire-which we must not expect to understand Our reason is finite and cannot hope to cope with or embrace the infinite What overlooked is the fact that being human, we require human reasons to induce us to believe that there are mysteries which must remains closed to us It is just these reasons which are not supplied to us ] really, let us take one current dogma of the protectionists. " Protection lowers lines ' roo doubt the men who give utterance to this doctrine believe what they say , but we could not have a better illustration of our contention that common sense is excluded m eel tam matters of inquiry It is noted much use proving to demonstration that protet tion does just the opposite What has to be attacked is the under) ing habit or attitude of mind which makes such a conclusion pos Bible lectures but recall Leek) s fine account of the deed) of belief in witchcraft It was not refuted and destroyed from with out, but died own in consequence of a change in the general point of view of the growth, in fact, of the rational or common sense spirit 'There is apparently more than one fetch yet remaining, which will no doubt in time pass through the same process If these remarks hasten in but an infinitesimal degree the arrival of that time, they will be more than justified.
