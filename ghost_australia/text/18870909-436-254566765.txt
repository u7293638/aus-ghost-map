H0WL0NG. (FROM A CORRESPONDENT.) ti&st; Saturday morning there died in this township the child of Constable Brill, after about fiv4 weeks' suffering. The funeral took place on Sunday, and considering the bad weather, was fairiy attended. The Howlong cemetery, to ns, is looked upon as !a place where our brothers and sisters, &c.;, resk, but if the. trustees do not mend the -fences at an early date, it is.very questionable whether they will restâ€”not because their spirits will be troubled or their "ghosts delight to walk the earth," but because their earthly remains stand a good chance of being trampled down or robted up J On the occasion of the above-mentioned funeral the waggonette Containing the poor child's coffin was " stuck up" by four pigs. IT is a wonder we don't hear more ghost stories from Howlong; the cemetery is a splendid plaice for white! cows, and they make first-class goblins, second only to the donkey, whose intelligent face and long ears give him a start on cow- It reminds me of an instance where miserly man was asked to subscribe towards a new cemetery fence, and refused on the plea that those who were inside could hot come out. side, and those who were outside did not want to' go inside. But it is very questionable if that man would not alter his mind if he "buried a relation one day, and went down the next to find the pigs holding a post-mortem, examination in the grave, with a view to breakfast, and a cow munching the flowers planted by some loving hand. This is for a-ffence, not offence.
