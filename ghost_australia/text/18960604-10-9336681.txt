FINE PERFORMANCES BY GIFFEN AND GREGORY. 'VARSITY SECOND INNINGS, TWO FOR CO. LONDON, June 2. There was again a very large attendance, when the match at Oxford between the Australians and Oxford University was resumed to-day. The weather also continued to be splendid, and the wicket was good. When play ceased yesterday the Aus- traliaS had lost two wickets for 21 runs. Eady (12) and Graham (3), the not outs, resumed batting, and at lunch time had increased the score to 55. Both men batted well, Graham playing a very steady game They were together for an hour, and added 89 runs to the score. Ultimately both men tell to Cunliffe. Hill wanted one to complete a score, when he returned the ball to Raikes, and retired c. and b. The association of Gillen and Gregory produced some splendid batting. For an hour and a quarter they correctly played everything sent down to them, and not the ghost of a chance was given. Gillen, however, when he had made 76, was bowed by Bardswell, and Gregory was caught by the same player off Hartley for 68. Each of them made half a dozen 4's. Trumble hit away vigorously, and when the innings closed for 308 remained not out with 35 to his name. But the innings was marred by an easy chance. With a minority of 71, the 'Varsity men commenced their second innings, and when stumps were drawn they had lost two wickets for 60. Foster, who made two-thirds of this score, batted brilliantly, and out of 47 made in the first half-hour, he contributed no less than 40. Tile scores are OXFORD UNIVERSITY.
