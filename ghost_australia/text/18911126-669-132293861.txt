OUR OPEN COLUMN. ( To the Editor.) Sir, — Tho Dapto people are again in trouble. It possibly may cccur to you that the complaint-is chronic, and in order that you may not be misled, it becomes a necess ity to one who has from his infancy been avewo to rushing into controversy, to have a word in reply to the scathing romai ks of ' Spectator' with regard to the Uthargy displayed by people at this end of the dis trict and the apathy shown in the leading events of tho day. It is quite evident that your correspondent — whose ' notes' by tho way are looked upon here with mspicion, i and in fact are not negotiable — must either be imbued with the idea that his witti cisms (s/c /) will lead us on to the idea that his notes are merely the prelude to a funny series of articles to appear in your paper (when you have room for them) and that acting on the bolief that the sword has no ghost of a show with tho pen, fancied that we were going to be nogo;iated in one act. We residents of Dapto have, however, made up our m:nds that the man who writes disrespec fully about us to your paper, or any other paper, and at the same time having his articles headod so as to make it appear that he resided in tho locality about which his notes wero com posed, is not fit to take a place in the presencs of persons who have the welfaro of tho district at heart. Enouali said ; perhaps ' Speotator' may havo loarned by this time that ho has erred, and his Bin will bo best condoned, and at tho same time the public moat bontfited by his for over after holding his peace. Apologising for taking up so much of your valuable space in reply to tho 1 bellous remarks of your corrcstoudent, I am, yours annoyed, 1 QUIPPR0QD0.
