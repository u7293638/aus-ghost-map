COLONIAL LABOR AND SEA- MEN'S UNIONS. Judging from the remarks made in an inter view with our Adelaide correspoudeut by Air. Dawes, oue of the directors of the TJ.A.S.N. Company, tho principles on which the new company will be conducted in relation to trades unions and the employment of colored labor will be satisfactory to the community. Mr. Dawes, who was for some time a director of the Queensland S.S. Company, and who has just arrived iu Australia iu connection with tho interests of the IT.A.S.N". Company, said, in referring to the ques tion of the employment of Asiatic labor, that there was not the ghost of a chance of pursuing such a policy iu regard to the Australian colonies, for that would mean that the company would simply be committing commercial suicide. Black labor WA9 used by .the promoters of this company only where all labor was black Vo( . instance, io the Indian trade they have 78 steamers, which are manned to a large extent by Lascars, but in the Australian colonies they would pursue a different policy and only employ European labor. A3 an instance of this he mentioned that the company had re tained all the old staff of the A.S.2L steamers and should continue to do so. On the question of .seamen'?, uulous, Mr. Dawc3 said he was of opinion that if they had seamen's unions in England as well organised as those in Australia — uuious that would insist upon tho carrying of full and clficieut complements in regard to crews — there would be much less occasion for interference ou the part of the Board of Trade.
