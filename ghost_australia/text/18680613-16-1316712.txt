SPORTING. Now that the May meeting of the Queensland Turf Club is ranked among the events of the past, perhaps a few words briefly reviewing the racing, may not be inappropriate While the meeting could not be considered a great success, it was not by any means a decided failure Indeed, under the circumstances, and considering the disadvantages under which it was got up it was on the whole better than could have been expected From pecuniary reasons, the club had to curtail its usual liber ality in the matter of prizes, and this of course, to some extent, militated against the number of chances, which, however, were pretty) numerous, sandflies quality of some of the horses was rather above than below the average of those usually attending the meet The racing itself was throughout very uninteresting there being no close finishes or exciting contests , but, novel theless, those who went to the races appeared to spend a pleasant time, and were not pin homes to a length as to the distance the second horse was behind the Hist when passing the past the absence of a professional book milker was not a matter of general regret and did not prevent a considerable amount of speculation on the different events The losers had no reason to complain of being done by the artifices of those with whom they made their wages, as every horse which started tanto win, and there was no pulling 01 low tricking exhibited It is to be hoped that the funds of the command of the club will, before the next meeting, be sufficient to enable the committee to make the arrangements about the stand a little more complete than they are at present. The sooner a proper paling fence surrounds the saddling paddock the better, for something is necessary to keep the roughs outside The want of a saddling shed is much felt Although I am an advocate for strict economy and consider that the club in of acting wisely in refraining from all unnecessary expenditure, yet it might be a question for them to consider whether it would not be advisable to raise funds by issuing debentures, and so got the course fenced in like it is at Randwick and elsewhere At present, the lessee of (the gate cannot collect the fees for admission to the ground, and in consequence the club lose considerably every year, as, of course, they cannot expect to dispose of the gate to advantage, if they do not take proper precautions (conable the lessee to obtain the fees he is authorised to levy A few words with reference to flic (nee ii self and I shall then have disposed of the metropo him annual for the present at less t The Maldon Pinto was looked upon by the exceed ugly clever bouts us a certainty for Noiiniiii, but as your readers have been already infor mud, the race resulted in an easy victory for London, who won it with at least 7lbs in hand Kio favorite came in second being seven ely punished when he had not the least ghost of a chance Some jockeys who could be named, from the persistency with which they continue to flog their horses after they have lost all chance of mining appear to admire this mode of pro- ceding, but lockers on can generally see when the race is won and the losing jockeys do not rise in the estimation of the public by punishing their horses needlessly either from ague n nee 01 temper The two cocktails engaged in his face did not distinguish themselves and the time in which the mile and a half was done was not fast by any means the Corinthian Cup brought Six very good horses, are invited to the post and resulted, as I predicted in my last communication Hermit coming in first, with Killarney who was well steered second The Pi use of Wales Stakes was a more either, for Canute 11 horse not mentioned 111 the letting, with Roanoke, a mere pony second The Uni k TI ice was well filled and tidewaiter was found inn bay horse Hamid Barney years old, by Raffles the rule of Hermit the winner of the Corinthic The second day's sport com fenced with the Hurdle Race, of which so much has been written Kilhuniv was madoawaim favorite for this race, but his backers were to a man disgusted at the way he was held on, or rather attempted to be mildly His 1901 fell at the first hurdle, kind through a similar area dent happening to the rider of 1 and) at the third leap, the ince was a mole cantor for Nim 1941, who was beautifully mitten by an insistent the Ladies'' Purse 19 onBily described Why Not, a grey horse, bred by Mr (co, of Bathurst, the breeder of more good horses than any other 1 three men in Australia fined the starter in Company with Chancellor, who was bred by the same gentleman and a lot of moderates The Bathurst bred pair had it all to themselves, and Why Not proved too good for the other and won williams) amount in hand illa Brisbane Cup Hugo was divested of much of its interest through the scratching of Pandora who over reached herself in the Minden Plate, and was too huge to run Premier was backed against the field at odds, and the winner was scarcely mentioned From the start Sydney and Forester went away with the lead, while the favorite and Centipede kept a long way in the rear After the first mile and a quarter old forester cried ago" the black horse was too far behind to take her place and when Pro miner tried to go up he found the weight beginning to tell on him.
