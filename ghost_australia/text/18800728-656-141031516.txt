Fragment prom an old latin ; ode. ? A dull deep pain is at my heart, My eyes are wot with bitter tears, ! That gueh from that still silent fount — Tho memory of bygone yoara. ' Oh ! that within tho iron gates ; Where death receives tbp trembling ghost, ' Some spot woro found — somo quiet 1100k — Whero wo might oonvorso with tho lost ! 1 Where, far from life and ligbt, and pain, | In that still Bliadow of tho tomb, 'Our souls might 'meet with theirs, and thoy Fill in our hoarts tho vacant room. : Oh ! kingdom rioh in oonquorod spoils ! I Oh 1 land whence nono can o' or return 1 : The soul is shut and barred in theo ,, , . Even as tho dust within tho upi., ; „? ? — J«ni O. Simjptoth'
