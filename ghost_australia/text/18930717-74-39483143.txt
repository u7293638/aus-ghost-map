THE CHURCHES. MEMORIAL CHURCH. Pastor Soltau, who conducted the evening services at the Memorial Church yesterday, delivered a most earnest and telling address from Romans xi., a chapter of the New Testament which he said was little read or understood. Few people seemed to under stand Gcd's purposes with regard to that nation, to which, through Abraham, had been given promises that would have made of them a ruling nation having control of the people of the earth, but that their threefold subjection of the Father, the Scn, and the Holy Ghost had brought them to their present position-that of a scattered and penal nation. Then taking the words of the parable contained in the text the Jews were shown to be typified by the olive tree from which the branches had been broken off and replaced by branches of wild olive grafted in. This was shown to indicate the Gantilo Christians who had also fallen away, as shown by the pre. valence of practical atheism in all the details of modern daily life. All the signs of the times showed that the second coming of Chriet,when the Jews, God's own people, should be once more gathered into his fold, was at hand. This was strikingly illustrated in the remarkable history of the conversion of the Polish Jew, Hermann Worszawiak, and his subsequent work amongst the Jews of all nations, who were coming back to the to d of Christ, not in ones and twos but in hundreds, showing that the end was close at hand, and that it behoved all who would obtain Christ's proffered salvation to grasp for it now.
