The Miseries of D Y S P E P S IA EFFECTUALLY ERADICATED! T h e C a s e o f Mrs. CLARKE. {From the “ Nepean Times,u N.B.W>) Directions wore given to our reporter to lock up Mrs. Clarke, of Woodrofle Street, " " On calling the pressman received a cordial reception, and, on inquiring her illness, Mrs. Clarke said : “ I first guessed there was something tho matter when I found that I couldn't do my ordinary work. I felt Restless and relaxed, and if I wanted to go out anywhere I felt so tired by the time that I had finished dressing tbat I often changed my mind and took my things off again. Then 1 began to notice a twitching, pricking pain between the shoulder*, which got worse and worse. At night it cave mo the most distress, then iho anguish of it was bo great that night after night 1 was Not able to U e Down, hut sat up in bed, as it was easier to bear the pain in that position ; and, as for steep, why, 1 hardly ever got an hour’s rest from evening to i " Yes, and all this time I had a heavy sick headache that'never ceased, and my food disagreed with me every time I took it. After eating i felt great oppression- on to have thrown it up again. But there it stuck, cold and undigested, till it turned and brought on windy spasms. There was always a nauseous taste in my mouth which nothing could remove. It is no wonder tbat I was So T h i n a n d W e a k , ana of a pallid, unwholesome colour. People used to say that I looked more like a walking ghost than a human being, but I loo than I felt. I had to give up trying to work; it was no use, I couldn’t do it. Tortured with unceasing headaches, and harassed by * T h e N e v e n - e n d i n g P a i n o in my back, lifo secmod not worth the living, and everything was a misery. -Meal times, which, to those who are in health, is a time of cheerful gathering, only wearied me, for I had no appetite, and only ate when 2 was actually obliged to.” “ XhiDgs couldnt lost long like th at/ said our reporter. “ You’re mistaken; a woman takes a lot of killing, for, on and oS, I was ill f o r T h r e e Y e a r s , and always getting worse;” 44 Surely the doctors could relievo yon?'4 44 Nothing of the sort; the doctors could do nothing for me. Their physic quite failed in its object. I can’t stop to tell you now bow many different pills and other things 1 took trying to get relief. If they were all put together I ^believe the bottles of medicine and boxes of pills I took would havo filled buckets. Every penny of the money I paid for these things W a s U t t e r l y W a s t e d , and I can hardly understand how my poor body stood it n!>. It was quite plain that none of t1-- ; .L.nedics bit off my disease, so I ce;.,. i taking medicine altogether; but 1 grew no belter. A sluggish torpor fay heavily on me all day, my eyes were di and swollen, and yet I not able m sleep, and a t sight I never could find to easy position in which I could eet a feWri hours feet, wbicli-I-needed ^ ^ a d l y ^ V exceedingly acute wereiJje. - , - { T ortures w hich Affected Me. ■ I grew very dejected. A great weight of despair bung over roe like a cloak. 'Th'ei conversation of my husband and children' was so t able to arouse or interest me.. Lower and lower I eauk, and got weaker. and weaken till very often I thought that! my spark of life was going out, ana th at E was about to die. • Medicine had seemed) useless, and I could not sec a gleam of hop* anywhere, and yet, at last, 1 found a remedy! T h a t D efeated th e D isease J which had hold of me.” | "Y es, what?” “ Clements Tonic. I was repoate^lyi advisod to take it, but’ I put it* down as being about as much use as the other things which t had swallowed. But I was quite; out of my reckoning, for, when I did give i a n d commenced to take it, A n Im m ense D ifference' i was eaaily Been in m y general health after only one large bottio. The dull appearance about the eyes gave place to a brighter and healthier look. I Boon took a pleasure reading and the company .of friends, who complimented me upon My M arked Im provem ent. T -obtained four more bottles of Clements Tonic. - I t brought my strength back splendidly, and .my headache and the pains in my back gave m e'leu troablo and pain after every aose. I felt quite sprightly and lively V, in the —y ***v daytime, '»*»»»->' instead ol heavy »j and mm stupid as I used to do, and'-at night, , not feeling any pain to speak of, long steep began to be a regular thing. No day paasec but what 1 was a stop further towards my usual vigorous health. Ones I sent m y- food away, but now I called for more, and it did me good, digested easily, and I began to fill out all over. 1 avoided any chance of a relapse by sticktag to Clemente Tonic even after I thought I wof convalescent. All trace* of ed no P worse a i n a n d D is e a s e w e r e D is s ip a t e d , and I was robust aud vigorous again, thanks to, that fine remedy, Clements Tonic, and 1 need hardly toll you l ’m_ncver now without a bottle in the house.
