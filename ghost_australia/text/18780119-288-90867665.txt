['I am neither a thief nor a rogue, as these military, papers will prove. I have been unfortunate, that is all.

I am ' my own 'worst enemy, but I want to speak to'you dBfaTsubject which may benefit you *mtf^l^«§py^ me.' ; Q&ere;^was something so simple and open in ^LeJOM^jna^i^j that the fears, and sus picro^A j^r Jhei«jqperienced , old jeweller vanisjied-nt^ee. - Merely glancing at the prdjp^eU^aj^Brsi;he quietly motioned to the^old^soidier to follow him, and led the ?wa^?3fife iis private -room at the back, where, as soon; as they were seated, the soldier began fumbling in a breast pocket, and produced a paper parcel, which being * imfoLded- disclosed a bit of crimson cloth lied up with small twine, and this inner parcel being opened out disclosed a single pearl, unset, and rather longer than a wren's egg in size, but of such matchless beauty and delicate lustre that for some moments after it was placed in his hand the jeweller bent over it in almost breathless admiration. ' You wish to sail this ?' he said at Ia3t, looking up with the gem in his hand. 'I do; and I will make it worth your ?while to buy it. I know its exact market value, so far as such things can be valued,' he added) mentioning a sum of several hundred pounds. 'But I find so few willing to look at it, and still fewer (I may say none) willing to buy it, that I begin to think the cursed thing will cling to me till I lie rotting in the grave ; and so, as I «aid, I would part with it for any reason able sum which you may choose to name.' There was a pause, during which the jeweller examined and. admired the pearl with even greater interest than before 4 but there was a constraint in his manner as he looked up again, which prepared the soldier for his next reply. {f The pearl is certainly a beauty, and _ worth fully the sum you name, and, under the circumstances, I would be glad to treat with you for its purchase. But — but— have ¥. VM UIU J VWIVVWAWUW VV MbUY A*W II *V r* ' ? 4UVV your possession ?' The soldier smiled out into a laugh. ' I thought that was coming. You mean, am I not a thief ? Did I not steal it ? Well, that's just as you look on it. I might say * Yes/ and I might say* No/ I'll tell you the honest truth, sir. It all hinges on- that one thing/' he added, lowering his voice to a_ fearful, whisper^— 'I believe there'a curse hanging .on. the blasted, shining little thing, and that's why Fve wanted so long to get rid of it. The curse may fall on the one that buys it— I don't know. - You would lave to risk that in getting it .'.cheap.' It was now the jewellerVtum to laugh, which he did long and heartily, and evi de.-ntltf1 -f eaiino- tnm»h TP.lievArl . ' Come, now/ he said, frankly, ' tell me all about it, and if that idea of yours about a fatality attending the possessor is the- only - drawback to me buying it I promise you that the bargain is as good as made. Where did you get it?' . 'I got it at the taking of Seringapatam, which I dare say_ you. will remember zead Ing-of . -You know, as soon as the place feUfJwe^ushei in plundering and killing the black devils on every hand; but for all that the plunder was of no manner of use to us..' We- were^ not allowed to retain a haJporth. I myself came out literally loaded witbjgold and silver, every pocket crammed, 5Mir! P.VAT1 mv frhllSPT liters tiar\ of tKo anf-1a and filled to the top. But -what then ? I -lareh*t keep it— I would have been strung up in a moment. I therefore simply walked into, the camp, called all my comrades around me, undid all the strings, emptied -^ everything in a heap oh the floor, and told them to take what they liked. Of course there was a great scramble, and then a rush to get rid of it on the instant among the - camp— followers — giving a handful of gold or some such value for a cup of coffee ^or a bottle of beer — till it had all vanished. But I was not yet I done with the looting. I wandered back ? ; among the. dead and wounded, and. turaed over a good many, till I came upon one black that resisted. He was only a common , -soldier, and the very fact that, wounded as my mind that he carried something worth struggling for. I am sorry to say it — it was thought little of among us at the time — I got enraged and bayoneted him on the spot, and then coolly stripped him and turned him over in search of ths bidden treasure^ which I at last got cleverly con cealed under one of his armpits. That treasure you now hold in your hand.' The soldier paused, not for want of breath, nor because he had been interrupted, bat einmlv because the recollection of the inci dents had been too much for him. He shook violently from head to foot, and with the cuff of Ms sleeve wiped away a pro fuse -burst of perspiration from his brow. The jeweller handed him a glass of water, and said— ' Go on, I am deeply interested ; did the man die ?' 'Just a minute, sir — the thought always takes my heart this way, and I don't won der at it — there was a curse on the thing from the first. . Well, as I wassaying, I got the precious stone with a great wrench, whica brought *ne dying man up on nis feet with-it, and then in his native tongue — which I understood too well for my after comfort— he uttered a fearful male diction or curse, saying that evil or suffer ing had eviet followed the possessor of the pearl I held in my hand, and would haunt me in continual -misery and misfortune ^ while I. possessed it. These words he shrieked out^throwing bis arms about and rolling his Byes -as only them, black fellows jcaEf_.aad.&en.heM;^^:-'st^^n^_aboatlkr, ichoking with, the bloofd, and at last flopped ?straight down^— stone Tflfead.' .-' c The soldier paused~again, and wiped his forehead as before | and tha time his agita jtion had communicated itself to his hearer, iwho shuddered: in spite of himself at the _ 5 wekoTpicture the othW^simple words liad conjured upbefpre him. . r - ? ' Well, sir, though a little akeared at the Name, I? wasn't a bit put backtrom my pur pose— which was to cpnceal the gam under any armpit, just as ha had done before me, sad as I iad heard it whispered many ;a^ isoldier did in that unsettled time. Indeed,™ uE believe there was arbit of bravado in me, :«nd I wanted, to ^prove to myself that the fatality he .had- spoken about was afl. non sense, and not worth minding.; tFrom. that 'moment .till the. war was rendedr-rindeed, 'till I hjffc tiie Bervice — I rieVer -knew rest. ?I was always afraid of Ifeingf pund put, or , hanged,, or something. \\-l 4ised to. dream I .about that black fellow, and^feel him iclutching at the peatfjand/^i^waice. up sand h'urriedly feel my armpit' if it was gone.

Then my. wife took to drinking, and feu downstairs and broke her neck; then I took to drinking, and lost a capital berth which would have lasted me a lifetime. I have got deeper and deeper in the mire, and all the time I have seemed to see the cursed thing shining at me right through its wrappings and my box, like asort of awful eye, till I can stand-it no longer. Fve brought it here ; but if you refuse I'm not sure, now that the fit is* on me, but I- may smash it into a thousand bits, and take them down and scatter them into the sea/' and the man actually seemed so awfully in earnest as to leave no doubt on the mind of the -other that he meant to execute the threat. 'Nonsense — that would be a piece of outrageous touy,' ligauy returned tne practical jeweller. ** What wpuld you say, now — would eightv pounds satisfy you as to price ?' ' Abundance — abundance !' eagerly broke in the soldier. .' Gently — gently,' interposed the jewel ler ; ' there is always a certain amount of .risk in buying such things. I don't mean your dreadful fatality, which I am quite prepared to risk at the price — I mean, 3, risk that your story might not be true, or that the gem might be enquired for. Now, here is what I agree to— you sell me the gem, I use it in what way I please, and make what enquiries I choose as to your veracity, &c;, and I pay you-bi-monthly the money in four instalments of .twenty pounds; leach. Does the arrangement, meet .with An eager assent was given, a bill ''of agreement was drawn up embodying this rather uncommon bargain, and the soldier departed with some bank-notes and a bit of paper in his pocket, leaving the gem in the possession of the overjoyed purchaser. As they shook hands and parted it would have been difficult to say which of the two seemed best pleased — the jeweller had inade an uncommonly profitable morning's work 5 and the soldier walked several inches higher, tis if relieved of a heavy responsi bility or care. In a few weeks the jeweller had -satisfied himself that the gem was not in the ordi nary sense stolen property, and after grave deliberation had it carefully inserted as the chief pendant on a chaste necklet of gold. Two smaller pearls hung beside it, merely as foils to its own extraordinary beauty, and the gold necklet itself was quite slender — the idea being, I suppose, to throw out into bold relief the one gem about which there hung such a halo of fatality and romance. The story of the supposed fatality, how ever, was not, as may oe reaaiiy_gues3ea, ticketed upon the jewel when it was finished and exposed for sale, bat at this time strictly confined to the breast of Mr. Graham him self. He watched it with astrange interest, ' always exhibiting it himself,- and. stating with perfect teuth/yiaii! t^^riseipal jewel; was rare and came from Ipdi&;!but before many months had elapsed he had begun to notice a singular fact. JDadies-anct^gentle-' men would troop into his, «hopj ^lavish shown the pearl necklet, go into jsestacies oveT it^try it on, admire it, from every point of view, say that it was a marvel of cheapness,- and utter a tubusand other glowing eulogies in itsf avoc— Jmt they never bought it.' No ; there it .remained- — beauti- ful and unbought— till at. last the jeweller began to fear' that he would have to class it as dead stock, on which he was destined to lose in interest all the profit he had anticipated at the outset. A tinge: of superstitious dread began to creep over his mind, too, when he found that upon every occasion jipon which the soldier,. Simp son, presented Jhimself-for. the- instalments of the money he jappeared ..to. be_happier and better in circumstances-^as if in getting rid of Ihe fatal gem he had shaken a curse from his shoulders. In desperation Mr. Graham at last reduced the price of the gem to a fabulously low figure, for in spite of his scepticism he was beginning to get con cerned — but still the necklet would not sell. Then he consulted his foreman as to the altering or resetting of the jewel ; but here he was met by the assurance that nothing more chaste or elegant could be designed, ana vasx, to alter iswouio. pro bably be to spoil it. Year after year, then, it remained in stock, regularly recorded as unsold, till at last Mi*, txraham handed the' chief care of the business over to his son, and with it a minute account of the pearl necklet, which he had written down in his leisure moments. _ His son^ an energetic young man, was ]ust as free from super stition as himself. He laughed at the story of the fatality attending the posses sion, and finally selected it with some otter - trifles as a present for his intended bride— a young lady called Flora Ferguson. This brings me to the second scene in this curious history. Over in one of those grand .houses in Heriot Bow two young girls sat chatting in quiet delight and ecstatic admiration over piles upon piles of wedding presents. One was Flora Ferguson, the intended bride of the young master jeweller, and the other was her cousin, Marion Handley. Though a perfect contrast in complexion, both girls were beauties, both moved in rather a higher sphere in society than the intended.. bndegroom himself , and both werb, to out ward.

He says he would not lose the centre gem for a good deal, and long ago gave~up thoughts of selling it.'; ' Well, really, I never thought Walter was so silly,' venomously put in Marion Handley, with an engaging smile. 'When he first paid attentions to me I thought Iiitti rather a firm, solid-minded young man. But people change, my dear — people change. Now, I think a false pearl would look quite as well — better, indeed, for they have a way of making them even to look more brilliant than the real cama.' ' Yes, you think so, and so do I, in my ignorance,' smilingly rejoined Flora. ' But the effect is not the same to the eye of a jeweller — they can detect a false stone at a mere glance — it is their profession, you know.' . 'Oh, could they, indeed?' said her guest, with 'startling' abruptness, which, though unnoticed at the time, was after wards recalled, distinctly and vividly, down to the very gleam of the dark, deep eyes. 'They can tell a false stone at a glance. Well, that is wonderful,' and the last words, curiously enough, were spoken quite absently, and more to herself than her cousin; and then she hung over the necklet, minutely examining its construc tion, but so lost in thought as to pay no heed to several questions addressed to her on the all-important question of the bridal robe. This was all of importance that passed between them — at least all that I have occasion to record. One thing I may men tion, however, as it may explain much that followed.. Marion Handley had at one timfi hpp.n all but PTumoWl to the-, vnima' man whom her cousin was about to marry. The two girls, however, only made a joke of the circumstance, and were the closest of friends, and, though Irving a few streets apart on ordinary occasions, were for the present constant associates and bed fellows. The necklet was put past in its case, and the whole to all appearance carefully locked up by Marion Handley, and the rest of the afternoon devoted to other trifles of deeper interest to the intended bride. About six o'clock that same night, how ever, Marion Handley found her way over to ah obscure jeweller's at the South Side, with -whom she had had some, dealings before, and, producing the pearl -necklet, asked, him a, strange question. ^ Could, you make an exact copy of it— I mean, -a-plated; thing, with false pearls as pendants, which might be mistaken by any but a practised jeweller for the real jewel?' The jeweller was not astonished — such questions and jobs were not new to him. Neetiy -persons often resorted to such a means of- procuring money secretly. The only question which 'made him pause and look grave was one of time in connection with the principal gem in the circlet. 'I could imitate it all in a few hours but this pearl. To get one like it I may have to send to London, which would occupy_at least two days.' 'It would do then — make it — get it done — no matter what the expense,' was the feverish reply ; ' I must have it. But vou must work without the model — it might be wanted or looked for at any mo ment. Can it be done ?' The jeweller paused again, examined the necklet even more minutely than before, and then gravely shook his head. 'It can be done, certainly,' he began, ' but it will be difficult, and will require careful measurements and drawings to be made ? ' ' Then do it — now — at once. I can wait — there is no other chance that I can de pend on.' , Then she grimly seated herself, and 'patiently counted the minutes of nearly an hour, when the jewel was once more placed in her hand ; and then enjoining the strictest secresy, she was shown into the waiting cab and driven off. . Five days after this, and indeed exactly the day before that fixed for the wedding, there was a merry party assembled in the house in Heriot-rdw. The intended bride groomMmBelf was there and a number of the morrow's guests, including, of course, the as they were all young, light-hearted people, in the midst of their frolic and fun, it was not surprising that the proposal should be made to array the briae exactly as she should be arrayed on the following morning. Wiseacres would have shaken , their heads over such a proposal as a fair flying in the face of Providence, and would have quoted a hundred superstitious proverbs to enforce their words j but then there were no wiseacres there, unless Marion Handley, from the far-seeing burning hate . that dwelt in her bosom, could be so termed p^y(x-iK5erned were free of iCa marked dfe gree. Several 'iwiBy -.-and;- ^meD^ifiarM^ young ladies,therefore,ipouiiced-upon poor Flora Ferguson, and bore, her, put. of tfiS rooinin triumph ; Jthen they ^cMtte'red^aM laughed, and danced about tneiib yicti^m|tp , ' their heart's content, till every iiem of i3ie wedding^uress -was adjustedrto^tiieir - satis-:; faxrti6n,;ana^tlifipe on: I her^n^^y'J^iirion /fia^dleyj h-M»i^^and then, without allpwing iher u single glance I aikaerself ~w ih&msioi;, uiibeyi Jsdiher *-ff [for exhibition in the drawing-room.

But Walter Graham started further and (further back from bis affianced, as if jactuallyrspell-bpund, and then with a faint | burst caine the words-1- ' v ; 'Good Godl Whatr-rwhat have you jdone with the necklet, Flora?' - ' * ; _!' Pone Lwith ._it ; ?' _echoe_d the wondering _ 'young girl, turning vrhite with alarm. ' I jhave done nothing with it ; it is exactly as when you placed it first upon my neck.' 'Then, if you have not, some one else has,' hastily broke in the young jeweller, rflushing up to the ears with agitation and growing alarm. 'It is not the jewel I :gave you ; you have put a wretched imita tion in its place — a plated Brummagem thins:, not Worth the labor that has been expended upon it. What on earth possessed you to play such a trick upon me ?' 'The young bride started as if she had been suddenly stung, which he, in his blind impetuosity, took for a sign of conscious guilt. Then she reared herself haughtily before him, with only one red spot on either cheek to relieve the dreadful pallor of her face, and then with flashing eyes burst forth. — 11 Walter Graham, I cannot understand why you should attempt to insult me, and in presence of these friends. The jewel is the same — unaltered arid untouched as you '* placed it on my neck — and no one has done anything with it, for it has never been for a moment out of my possession.' The young man groaned and shrank . shiveringly away. ' I see it all,' he thought. ' Poverty ill concealed, the jewel sold or pawned, and deception resorted to to hide the fact from me, and this miserable thing of brass and naste siinstitiitfld to Hind th« world. Oh. God ! how I have been deceived!' ' Walter, you do not speak,' tearfully burst in the poor girl, breaking down and speaking in gentle, pleading tones, that seemed to eat his very heart out. ' If I have done wrong in any way ? ' ' You have done wrong — a foul wrong — a base, lying deception, which the blindest fool could discover at a glance !' shouted the young jeweller, springing to his feet in a fury of passion. ' Woman, I could smite those fair cheeks and fawning lips, that can smile and lie with such a look of purity! That a jewel? — that a necklet of mine?' and with a wrench he had it hang ing snapped in his fingers. 'It is brass, and. paste, and may burn and consume like the remorse which I leave you to!' and the imitation necklet was dashed into the fere, and then with a few maddened strides the distracted lover had rushed from the room and the house, while the poor stricken girl clasped her hands over her heart, and with but a sigh fell back in a faint in the arms of her .friends. Now, as the superstition should go, no evil should have fallen upon poor Flora Fer guson from the moment that the fatal gem went from her possession to that of Marion Handley, while, as I have shown, it was in reality the very non- possession of the trinket which brought on her woes. This is a hitch in the orthodox order of such things ; but, that got over, the mischief to tlie possessor was to be resumed. It has often been remarked that villainy in the very height of its success often trips and over-reaches itself. It was precisely so in the present case. An hour after leaving the house in Heriot Row, and when de liberately packing up his things for a long journey, Walter Graham was surprised to receive a visit from the principal brides maid—his former sweetheart — Marion Handley. ' I have come to plead on behalf of my UUUoiii, WOO 11X31 lllOit D£TCCl/I£, YYJXCU XLC .UCfcU. stiffly bowed her to a seat. ' Oh, Walter, I fear you will think her unworthy of you when you hear the whole truth, but I must entreat you to remember her extreme youth and thoughtlessness, and the extravagant and expensive habits in which she has been reared. You are listening ?' :«I am listening,' harshly replied the young man. He might have said more 5 he was thinking — sifting. Blind, maddened, and horrified as he was at the supposed discovery, there was a refined spitef ulness in every one of the carefully-weighed words of the woman before him, which, in spite of her hypocritical tears, could not escape the attention of the most careless. He knew the woman who addressed him — had studied her treacherous and evil nature to its heart's core years bef ore — and at once stood on his guard, suspecting much and fearing more. 'She has asked me to tell you the whole truth, and hopes that you will look over the slight fault and forgive her,' coolly pursued the smiling liar. 'She was in want of money for a few things which she thought necessary, and got the jewel imi tated by the man to whom she sold it— a jeweller at the south side, whose name I am not allowed to mention. But you will forgive her ? The fault after all was not a great one, and you have yourself to blame for forcing her into a denial before her friends.' 1 Doubtless the young lady expected a burst of indignation, and an oath that he would never again look upon the face of his' deceiver ; but, if so, she was disap |-:4't*P^SS; I 'd^|b!^'iBe^'^ou;'M*i%-;J^^-^r;; ewellOT-you JbameT r A mustije -BafiSSed ! reply. trBi^j^.-^:^;..xB^:i^^», i matter ^yr^p?th«r^i J_^y. pn^te satisfig3 ; that you eaiin^^prgira let me -jpnye$jr 'taJ&ier; ifhft^glad' news l^nat falpsrw^l^.^ p'-r:1, t^^^^'^C.r \ ^W^^^rah^m^ ^fffi^^f?^^^^ |^e, -and ^eajii^gr; .malicious, heart that lurked: beneath; and' then; br^liediL great ^h; o£- tbank^uness^ jand relief aiie pressM h^^b4,nl:m] j*a; ^heaxtjaallodked upwards, in the ecstacy |of la inewrbo^lwpei '~\ ...'?; -'.1._ ^ '' .'V: '{, , ?'-, i -**1 .haye-J been a gjreat -Ibo^he^aoray;^ \- murmured, more, to himself thanhis visitor. ] i '(.But i rnvsh discover the jewjelferlf';. ;- .'.'- ^ : y^pk' ' cannot r denaritly reti^pd; thje7^ treacherous plotter. ; ' - ; = v_ ,it ; ' '^X^oEirjiie sai^l, and; lieax-^thout^ uttering another woxd,^ae walked from ;Jter .: presence, left the house, haUed acab,-and soon found his way to mJL house in Chades street, when afterlistenuigto his siary^ started to accompany him on a tour of in- \ vestigation among the principal jeweller^ian the south side.

It was now, our-, turn to become.: listeners— which we did with a surprise , and astonishment that outdid his own— as the whole plot was. revealed and brought; home to the treacherous bridesmaid. When we rose, the whole countenance of the young jeweller was radiant as the summer sun. . . *' I cannot let the thing go any farther, Mr. McGoyan,' he said, warmly, wringing - my hand as we got outside. 'But I will gladly lose the necklet— ay, or a hundred times its worth— to get back my darling wifie. Still if you can think of any means of recovering it' without any exposure or scandal, I wili be most nappy to defray every expense. But, perhaps, it may be destroyed — most probably it wulbe — seeing that it was not stolen for mere value. Let it go ! —I am saved — happy once more, and why should I care ? The thing has a curse about it after all, and I am almost glad it is gone j,' and then he related tome the facts that I have already here detailed. : But the necklet was not destroyed;. Fearing mischief, Marion Handley had made her way straight to her own house, and there concealed the jewel bodily _ in a hole dug with her' own delicate bauds and a table-knife in the chimney of her bed room. Days passed away, and word came - to her that her cousin had really become a happy bride and staited far the Conti nent. But a strange fidgetiness, a gnawing restlessness and dread, now possessed her mjxiu . iiuu. suo wuiuu. ouiuctiiucs ovcii slant ?up in her sleep, and grope her way to the fireplace to make sure that the necklet was not gone. The shadowy curse had fallen on the possessor in this case beyond a doubt. Now, all this was hidden from ordinary observers ; but it happened to attract the attention and excite the curiosity of a light-headed maid in her employ, called Bell Price. This girl watched her like a lynx, and at last made an exploration of the strange hide in the absence of her young mistress, and clutched the stolen necklet. She had heard the whole story, with the exception of that part treating of a fatality attending it, and, without the slightest compunction, resolved to profit by the helpless guilt of her mistress. She removed the necklet, took the advice of her sweetheart — one of the Ruffian's gang^ as it happened — and re moved it to her mother's house in the Canongate, where it was caret ully concealed in the wall. Three hours after her return the jewel was missed, and her mistress turned on her like a tiger, storming, raging, and threaten ing, but utterly helpless tu injure her or s»nll i-n 4-VtA YwwisiA cauinrr +I10+ aha Vi£*T*aalP had stolen the jewel. The result was the bursting of a bloodvessel with Marion Handley through passion and agitation, which in a few months landed her in the grave.; and the prompt discharge of the possessor of the fatal gem, who, not getting' readily into another situation, went down wards by rapid strides till she landed on the street. By this time the story of the = fatality had got to her ears, and in a fever of dread she one night took it from her mother's house and buried it away up on the Radical-road, underneath Salisbury Crags, carefully marking the spot in a written description which she left in the hands of her mother. But neither threats nor entreaties could ever induce her to reveal the hiding-place. Even her evil associate, though she loved him to infatua tion, could not get more than shudders and evasions from her ; and threats from the Ruffian, whose vulture-like scent had been excited, proving useless, she was, as a natural result, hunted down and landed in prison, where she took fever and died, ?carrying the secret, so far as she was con cerned, with her. At this point I will drop, leaving to the following sketch the relation of the last incidents connected with the fatal gem. (To be continued.)
