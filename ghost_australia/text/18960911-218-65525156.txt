A NEW VERSION. =The olo l as given with all seriousness by. an old Belgian veteran to a number of open mouthed villagers. It certainly deserves to be handed down to posterity. The day was dark (he commenced). The Emperor was gloomy and disheartened. He was mounted on 'his horse, and his orderly. officer, a fine-looking fellow, caracoled by his aide. Suddenly the Emperor raised his field-glass, and said, "What is that large black cloud I see yonder?" " Sire, it is the English." "Forward - march ! A squadron of cuirassiers to the front!" "Rub-a-dub-dub! Rub-a-dub-dub! Off with the English. Clean swept away. Not a man left. The Emperor and his suite dismounted, and coffee was handed round. Of a sudden Napoleon again takes up his field-glass, and says to his orderly;" a splendid fellow; "What's that other dark cloud I see over yonder?" "Sire, itis the Austrians." "Forward-- march!" says the Emperor. " A squadron of carabineers to the fronit." Rub-a- dub-dub! Rub-a dub-dub! Not an Austrian left!. All of them blown to'smithereens ! Again they dismount and resume their coffee. All at once the: Emperor turned pale. "Pray, what is that tiny little black cloud I see in the distance ?." " Sire," said the orderly, "those are the Belgians." "The Belgians! " said the Emporer. "Then we are done for!" -And there you have the Battle of Waterloo. One argument to prove that the common relations of . ghosts and spectres are generally' false may be drawn from the opinion held that spirits are never seen by more than one person at a time; that is to say, it seldom happens to above one person in a company to be possessed with any high degree of spleen or melancholy.
