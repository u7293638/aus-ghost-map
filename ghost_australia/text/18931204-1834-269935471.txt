SUPPOSED HAMPTON COURT mmkmm Between 9 and 10 o’clock one evening two frail figures in white suddenly appeared in the public highway, opposite the principal entrance gates leading to Hampton Court Palace, and darted off at almost lightning speed along the road, in the direction ot Hampton Green. They were observed by a couple of Teddingtou dealers driving in the same direction, and so positive were they that the figures had dropped from the walls surrounding the palace, and were in some way connected with the family of ghosts now inhabiting the Court that they imme diately gave chase, shouting loudly for help as they drove furiously after the fugitive spectres. Their cries induced others to join in the hunt, and wild shouts of “ The ghosts I the ghosts! ” rang out in the clear night air as the pack, some driv ing and some on foot, took un the running. Upon this occasion the “ghosts” did not escape into thin air, as is their wont, but allowed their pursuers, who were aided by the light of the moon, to catch sight of them from time to timeas they proceeded at racing speed along the highway through the village ot Hampton, and thence towards Folwell railway station, where they suddenly stopped dead, and turned upon the excited and breath less crowd now at their heels. Then it was discovered for the first time that the two mysterious figures in scanty white raiment were but a couple of innocent youths con nected with a local pack of harriers, who were out for an evening’s run between King ston and Isleworth.
