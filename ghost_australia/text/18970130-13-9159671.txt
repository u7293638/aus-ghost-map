LIFE. ON A GREENLAND i WHALER.. By A. CONAN DOYLE. It has been my good fortune to have an expert deuce of a life which is already extinct, for although whale ships, both English and American, still go to Davis's "rait, the I Greenland fishing that is, the fishing in the waters between Greenland and Spitz bei gin-hint belli attended with such ill fortune during the last ten years that it has now been abandoned 'The Hope and the Eclipse, both of Peterhead, were the last two vessels which clung to an industry which was once so flourishing that it could support a fleet of a hundred sail, and it was in the Hope, under the command of the well known whaler John Gray, that I paid a seven months visit to the Arctic Seas in the Mir 1880 I went in the capacity of surgeon, but is I was only twenty years otngewbin I stilled, and as my knowledge of medicine was that of an average third years student, I hav e often thought that it was as well that there was no very serious call upon my services It came about in this way One law if til noon m I imbecile, whilst I was sitting leading hand for one of those examinations which blight the life of a medical student, there entered to me a fellow student, with whom I had some slight acquaintance the monstrous question which he asked drove all thought of my studies out of my head 'Would you cue,' said be to start next week for a whaling cruise' You 11 be surgeon, two pound ten a month, and three shillings a ton oil money " How do you know 111 get the berth' was my natural question ' Because I, have it myself I find at this last moment that I can't go, and I want me to get a man to take my place ' ' How about an Antic kit '" You can have mine In an instant the thing was settled, and within a few minutes the current of my life had been converted into a new claimed In little more than a week I was in Peter head, and busily engaged, with the help of the steward, in picking aw ly my scanty belong, ings in the locket beneath my bunk on the good sin]) Hope And this, my last appearance aboard the ship, was marked by an absurd incident In my student days boxing was a favourite amusement of mine, for I had found that when leading bird one can com press more exercise into a short time in the way that in my other Among my belongings, therefore, were two pairs of bitten and discoloured gloves Now, it chanced that the sum aid was a bit of a lighting man, so when my unpicking was finished he, of his own in cold, picked up the gloves and proposed that we should then and there have a but I don t know whither Talk Lamb still lives but if he does I am sure that he remembers the mci if it I em see him now blue eyed, yellow bearded, short but deep chested, with tin b lively legs of a very muscular man On contest was an unfair out, for he was several inches shorter in the reach thin I and knew nothing about spuring, although I have no doubt he was a formidable person in a street row I kept propping him oil as he rushed at me, and it last, finding that he was determined to bore his way in, I had to hit him off with some seventy An hour or so after wards, as I sat waiting in the saloon, there was a name in the mate s berth, we luck was next door, and suddenly I heard the steward Biiv, m loud tones of conviction, "So help me, Cohn he's the best sugar geon wi we had' He's blackened my e e ' " It was the first and very nearly the best) testimonial that I ever be given to his professional abilities He was a good fellow the steward, and as I look back at the long voyage, during which for seven months we never get our feet upon land, his kindly, open face is one of those of a bath I like to think He had a very beautiful and sympathetic tenor voice, and mine in hour have I listened to it with its accompaniment of rattling plates and jingling lives, as he cleaned up the dishes in his pantry He knew a great store of pathetic and sentimental songs, and it is only when you have not seen a woman's face for six months since you run lise what sentiment means When Jack rushed out 'Her Bright Smile Haunts Me Still, or "Wait for Meat Heavens late, Sweet Belle Malioiie," he filed us all with a vaccine, sweet discontent which comes back to me now as I think of it As to his boxing, he discussed with me even day, and became a for nullifies opponent-cpeci ally when there was in seven when, with his more experienced ser legs he could come charging down with the heel of the ship He was a baker by to de, and I dusty Greenland is as much a dream to him now as it is to me there was one curious thing about the manning of the Hope The man who signed on as first mate was a little, decrepit, broken fellow, absolutely incapable of performing the duties. The cooks assistant, on the other hand, was a punt of a man, led bearded, bronzed, with huge limbs, and a voice of thunder But the moment that the ship cleared the harbour the little de crepe miss disappeared into the cooks galley, and acted as scullery boy for the voyage, while the mighty smiling boy walked aft and became chief mate The fact was, that the one had the certificate, but was past sailing while the other could neither read nor write, but was as fine a spring is ever lived, so, by an agreement to which everybody concerned was party, they swapped their berths when they were at sea Colin M'Leod with his Oft of stature his erect stalwart figure and his fierce red beat, pouring out from between the flaps of his sealing up was an officer by natural selection which is a higher title than that of a Board of Trade certificate His only fault was that he was a very hot blooded man, and that a little we ollie! excite him to a frenzy I have a vivid recollection of an evening w hull I spent in dragging him off from the towns who had imprudently made some criticism upon his way of attacking a vv hale which had escaped Both men had had some rum which had made the one argumentative and the other the line and as we were all three seated in a space of about seven by four, it took some hard work to prevent bloodshed Every. now and then just as I thought all danger was past the stew and would begin again with his famous No offence?, Cohn, hut all I says is that if you had been a bit quicker on the fish-' I don't know how often this sentence was begun, but novel once was it ended for at the word "fish" Cohn Wiluna seized him by the throat, and I Colin round the waist and we struggled until we were all panting and exhausted Then, when the steward had recovered a little breath he would start that miserable sentence once more, find the "fish" would In the signal for another encounter I really believe that if I had not been there the route would have killed him There were 50 men upon our whaler, of whom half were Scotchmen and half Slice landers whom we picked up at "crwick as we passed the Shetlanders were the steadier and more suitable, quiet, decent, and soft spoken while the Scotch seamen were more likely to give trouble, but also more v mile and of stronger character The officers and harpooner. were all Scotch but as ordinary seamen, and especially as both men, the Shetlanders were as good as could be wished, for he was quite the engaged man that I have ever seen there was only one man on board who belonged neither to Scotland nor to Shot land, and he was the mystery of the ship. He was a tall, man tin, dark ii ed man, with blue black hair and heard, singularly handsome features, and a curious reckless sling of his shoulders when he walked It was rumoured that he came from the South of England, and that he had lied clients to avoid the law. He made friends with no one, and spoke very seldom, but he was one of the smartest Kennion in the ship I could believe from his appearance that his "hair was- Satanic, and that the crime for which he was hiding may have been a bloody one Only once he gave us a glimpse of him hidden fires The cook-a very burly, powerful man the little note was only nBKistant-lind a private store of rum, and treated himself he liberally to it that for three sureties iUijh the dinner of the crew was ruined. On the third day our "lent outlaw approached the cook with a brass saucepan in his hand He said nothing, but he struck the man such a frightful blow that his head flow through the bottom, and the sides of the nan were left dangling round his neck His half drunken and half stunned cook talked W fighting, but he was soon made to feel that the sympathy of the ship was against him, so he reeled back grumbling to his duties, while the average relapsed into his usual good) indifference We heard no further complaints about the cool ing There are eight boats on board a whaler, but it is usual to send out only seven, for it takes six men each to make them, so that when the seven are out no one is left on board except the so called ' idlers who have not signed to do seaman's work at all It happened however, that on board the Hope the idlers were an exceptionally) active and energetic lot, so we volunteered to man the eighth bott, and we made it, in our own estimation at least one of the most efficient both in selling and a whaling The steward, the second engineer, the donkey) engine man, and I pulled the oars, with a red headed Highlander for harpooner, and the Isle of Man outlaw to steer Our tall) of seals stood as high as any, and in whiting we were once the harpooning boat and once elie lancing boat, so our record was an excellent one So congenial was the work to me that Captain Gray was good enough to offer to make use harpooner as well as surgeon if I would come with Him upon a second voyage, with power to draw the double pay It is as well that I refused, for the life is such a fascinating one that I could imagine that a man would find it more and more difficult to give it up Most of the crew are never called upon to do so, for they spend their whole lives in the same trade There were men on board the Hope who had never seen coin growing, for from their boyhood! they had always started for the w blink? in March and returned in September One of the claims of the work it the gambling element, which is inherent in it Every man shares in the promise much for the captain, so much for the mate, so much for the seam in If the for) age is successful even one is rich until another spring comes round If the ship comes home clean it means a starvation winter for all hands The men do not need to be told to be keen Hie shout from the crows nest, which tells of the presence of a whale, and the little of the falls as the boats are cleared and) blend into one sound The watch below rush up from their bunks with then clothes over their arms and spring into the bolts in that Arctic mr, w using for a chance later for finishing their toilet Woe betide the harpooner 61 the boat steerer who b) an) clumsiness has missed a fish' He has taken a five-pound note out of the pocket of every meanest hand Upon the ship Muck is his welcome when he returns to his fellows What silly ised me most in the Arctic regions was the rapidity with which you reach them I had never realised that they lie at our very doors I thus that we were only four days out from felled and when we were among the drift ice 1 awoke of a morning to hear the bump bump of the floating pieces against the side of the ship, and I went on deck to see the whole sea covered with them to the horizon They were none of them large but they lay so thick that a man might ii ii el far b) spring ing from one to the other their darling w witness made the sea seem bluer b) con test, and with a blue sky above and that glorious Arctic air in one's nostrils it was a move is to remember Once, on one of the sw a) mg, rocking pieces, we saw a huge seal, sleep sleep), and imperturbable, looking up with the utmost assurance at the ship as if it knew that the close time had still three week is to run Further on we saw on the ice the long, human like prints of a been All this with the snowdrops of Scotland still flesh in our glasses in the cabinet I have spoken about the close time, and I may explain that by an agreement between the Norwegian and the British Gov- eminent the subjects of both nations are forbidden to kill a seal before the 3rd of April The reason for this is that the bleeding season is in March, and if the mother s should be died before the young are able to take care of themselves the race would soon become extinct for breeding purposes the seals all come together at a unable spot which is evidently pie arranged among them, and as this price may be aux where within many hundreds of square miles of floating ice, it is no easy matter for the fishes to find it the means by which he sets about it me simple but ingenious Ah the ship mill of its xv my through the loose ice streams, a school of seals is observed travelling through the water Their direction is carefully taken by compass, and marked upon the chart An hour afterwards perhaps another school is seen This is also in a ked When these beings I axe Ken taken several times the various hues upon the chart are prolonged until they intersect At this point, or near it, it is likely that the main pack of the I seals will be found When you do come upon it, it is a won derful sight I suppose it is the largest assembly of creatures upon the face of the vi o Id - and this upon the open ice fields hundreds of miles from Greenland coast Somewhere between 71deg and 78deg is the rendezvous, and the longitude is even vague, but the seals have no difficulty in finding the address From the crow's nest at the top of the main mast, one can see no end of them. On the furthest visible ice one can still see that sprinkling of pepper grows And the young lie everywhere also, snow white blues, with a little black nose and large dark eyes Their half human series fill the air, and when you are sitting in the cabin of a ship which is in the heart of the seal pack, ) cm would think You we are next door to a monstrous nursery The Hope xv is one of the first to find the seal week that year, but before the day came when bunting, was allowed we had a succession of strong gales, followed by a severe roll which tilted the floating ice and launched the young sells prematurely into the water And so, when the law at last allowed us to begin work, Nature had left us with very little work to do However, at dawn upon the third, the ship's company took to the ice and begin to gather in its murderous harvest It is brutal work though not more brutal than that which goes on to supply ever) dinner-table in the country And yet those glaring crimson pools upon the dazzling white of the ice hills under the peaceful silence of a blue Arctic Ay did sit in a horrible intrusion Hut an inexorable demand creates an in trouble supply, and the heads, by their teeth, help to give a living to the long line of se time in, dock is tanners, curers liners chandlers leather merchants and oil sellers who stand between this annual butcher, on the one hand, and the exquisite, with his soft It either boots, or the Bavant, using a delicate oil for his philosophical nistru ments, upon the other I have cause to remember that first day of sealing on account of the adventures which befell me I have said that a strong swell had annul, and as this was dashing bit floating ice together the captain thought it dangerous for in inexperienced man to venture upon it And so, just as I was clambering over the bulwarks with the rest he ordered me back and told me to remain on board M) Remonstrances were useless and at last in the blackest of temper, I seated him) self upon the top of the bowels, with my feet dangling over the outer side, and there I nursed mv wrath, swinging up and down with the roll of the ship. It chanced however, that I win really seated upon a thin sheet of ice which had former upon the wood, and so when the snell Huon , <"-,' to n III" ticularly acute angle, 1 shot off and vanished into the sea between two fetlocks Ab 1 rose I clawed on to one of these and soon scrambled on board again The accident brought about what I wished, however, for the captain n mm ked that as I was bound to fall into the. ocean in any case I might run, as we all be on the lee as on the ship I justified his congenial caution by falling in twice again during the day, and I finished it ignominy iousIv by ha. mg to take to my bed while all my (clothes were (living in the engine room I was consoled for mv misfortunes by finding that they amused the captain to such an extent that they drove the ill success of mu resurgent of his head, and I had to answer to the name of "the great northern diet for a long time thereafter I had a narrow escape one through stopping bail wails over the edge of a piece of floating ice while I hub engaged in -winning a seat I had wandered away from the other s and no one saw my misfortune The face of the ice was so even that I had no purchase by which to pull myiicU up, and my both was rapidly becoming number in the freezing water At last, however, I caught hold of the hind flip.per of the dwd wal, and there in a kind of nightmare cut-off ' war, the question being whether I should Kuli the sea!

Half the beauties of Nature are lost through over familiarity Your sense of loneliness also heightens the effect of the Arctic Seas When we wire in whaling latitudes it is probable that with the
