Fanny's Stratagemn. CO. TI NU.It V. I did not think she was bad,-poor Fanny !-I only thn, glit she loved her husband, as womncu will, whether they are had or good.-d-, they not swear to do so in the sight. of heaven when they take their marriage row ? --and I was sorry for her from my heart, and thiought about her a great deal but ino word 'came of her, or any tidings of where her husband had gone to; he had not left the country ; a watch had been set at every port and pretty' nearly every railway station in Eugland, for John Bell was a man of mark in his nefarious profession, and his safe custody meanit the suppression of the cntire gang. 'And' alt" the while with tho police searching for him everewhere, and a reward, enough to make the officers' mouths water, offered for his capture, he was quietly living not a great way from WYestholme in a clever disguise that com pletely bafled the district police, who had not the slightest suspicion that the big bearded man who had taken a lodging in the village not three miles from us, and Iho had something to do with the' railway, and was a great naturalist, was the clean shaven delicate looking man they were seeking for. lie was said to be German, and was certainly foreign, and had a' sister who visited him sometimes, and who was not at all like my old. servant Fanny... I don't know how the 'truth-loaked,?out but it did. and we were startled one fine morning by hearing that the police had discovered John Bell once more only to lose him again directly. "They can't lose hint for l?ug ndow," my husband said. "lie is somewhere in C'ldehurst Wood; they will soon run him to earth there." ' I don't know," I replied, half hoping th y wouldn't; there' seemed so much pluck in the man after all. " Colchurst Wood is full of all sorts of queer places where a man might hiJe for a long time." " But not where lie could get food. They can starve him out, and they will. A very few days will shoi what is to be the end of it. The police have formed a completeo ring round the wood, and he can't get out without being caught." Theendof the story was cu riotus enodighi and is disbelieved by many, I fancy, to this day. I had it from the aggrieved policeman, who considered himself most aggrieved by what happened in the search for James Franklin, to call him by the name that is most familiar. Colelhurst WooJ is full of queer places, as I have said. There are more hollow trees there, with all sorts of traditions attached to them, and moret strange cavities in the ground, than I ever knew in so smisall a space, for it is barely a mile round, though to strangers walking through it and losing their way, as they often do, it seems of vast extent and impenetrable thickness. It is a charming place on a summer's day, when all nature is bright, and one can forget one or two miserable tragedies that have taken place there. Within my remembrance of it a terrible murder was committed in the thickest part of it, and not discovered for days, it being wet weather; ad at another time a party of people intending to vic.nic under the largest of the fine old trees. that had stood there since the days of Robin Hood and his merry men were horrified at find. ing a man who had been missing from the village for some days, hanging front one of the branches. So in some sort the wood had an evil reputation, and ignorant folks did not like wandering there after dark, and it wias as likely a place for anyone to hide in as could be found. TIhere was not much chance of any fssd there the night after the discovery had been made, and I don't quite know how it came about that .lames Franklin was w ithout doubt somtewhere amnontgst the trees and bracken of the darkwood. tii, , if the piolicemen employed, a yotusg handl, as it came out faterwards, declatedl he had sen a ghost. Qsuestioned by hiis to,-re acute comrades and his superior ltileer, it came to he understood that what he had taken for a ghost must have been a suwomen. At first he declared that a tall iisur,, all black. had glided by him in s:l-'er.natulral fashion, and haid vanised elwfre his very eyes. at a place whlmers no entrasnce to the wood coud lst be ouit aiil iby reason of a vwall l;bt analysed, his experiences Ihad resolved thetielvres inito the fact that he had Seen a tigure at a corner of the same wall, ansd that to the best of his belief it had gone i:to the wio ,l. l(c was qjiite certaint it Iihad st come out, and. iudced, fc?,tiarks :at that par ticular splt shoved that soeonst'e ha-l been there.

Again they searched tile wood, to the intense delight of the boys of the neighbourhood. who assisted at tile per formance outside, for they were not allowed to comite near tihe scene of operations, andl thi s time they found-- James Franklin's wife, but no trace of himself. Fanny was perfectly self. posessed ; she knew nothing of her rhsband's whereabouts; she liad come there to seek him, laving heard what was going on; she had brought food withi her -what wife nwould not? and shie had cot into the wood uindr ltheir very eves, but liher husliiul was not there ; wlatl had they done with him ? She looked white and wan, but all their (lqestions, and a thorough search I y the female searcher at the nearest police station, lwent for nothinig; lihree was nothing about Fainny to show tlat sihe knew any:ling; not a scrap of anything that had ever been J.ames Franklin's; not a morsel of writing nor any vestige of his property. They slaslhed away at tihe bracken, and peet ed into thie hollow trees, but tile wood told no tales, and they were obliged to confess that it might be possible after all that they had been mistaken,and that tne mail they wanted had never been in the wood at all and yet he had been seen to go there and never come out, and there was no trace of his clothes, no sign of any fire where they might have been burned, and Fanny liad not anything about her lbut her lint and cloak. She was pale and weary, for site had spent tie night in the wood. hoping doubtless to find her husband, and tlhe remains of the food she had brought for tIim lay under the tree where they found her. They could do nothing with lier, and they had to let her go, after a weary examination and all sorts of discussions as to what was to be done; and the mystery was left a mysicry still. I think it was about a year afterwards that confirmation of the fact, that Tames Franklin had got away that night in a policeman's dress, came through a party of young men whose dog, going into a hole for so long a time that they feared ioe was smothered, came out at last, dragging something that they in terror unspeakable fancied to be part of a human body. Examination showed them that it was only clothing, andi a further search revealed tle whole of the dress worn by the missing nian when last seen by tile police.
