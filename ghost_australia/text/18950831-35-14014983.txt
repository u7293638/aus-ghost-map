THE JEW IN DRAMA. BY THE REV. J. li. LASDAU. i What meeting point can there be, or ought there to ho-asks the late Bishop Lightfoot be- tween the pulpit and the stage, between the direct presentment of religion and the very embodiment of the world ? It may be that, in his dramatisa- tion of the Biblical story of Joseph of Canaan, the Rev. George Walters has set himself to answer this question, and has justified his position by some such argument as this " The drama was in times past the great teacher of the people, sharpening and refining their intellectual faculties, and setting before them a lofty standard of domestic and political morality Why should it not be so now' The ancient stage in its purest ages was the pulpit, not only in name, but in touching In the Athenian theatre ' tragedy in sceptred pall ' preached the noblest sermons which the poet could conceive or two ago comprehend What is there to prevent the stage from taking its proper place as the most useful ally of the school and the pulpit by promoting all that is healthiest in morality and all that is most bracing to the intellect " in the scenic representation of " Joseph," Mr Walters has illustrated the capabilities of the drama for the highest purposes of instruction, while the vividness of its characterisation and its directness of appeal to the imagina- tion and the emotions will inevitably secure to it the influence of popularity The story of Arethusa is the image of the life of Joseph Adversity, prosperity, peace those three words include it, and each phase appeals to our imagina- tions But to one of the audience at least, the equally emotional thought would present itself that the central figure on the stage was a Hebrew, and he conceived the idea of tracing in sketchy fashion, something of the vicissitudes that have befallen the historic stage Jew since the day. of Joseph If we may judge from casual observation in early Jewish literature, theatrical exhibitions were never favourably looked upon by the Rabbis During the Greek persecution of the Jews every theatrical performance as then held was condemned by them This condemnation was no doubt owing to the characters represented on the stage being drawn from heathen mythology, and as recitation formed the principal feature of the Grecian stage scenic representation being of a much later date the dialogues of the Grecian performers were considered so blasphemous that a Jew would not even listen to them The 61 mean games were even more abhorrent, owing to the cruelties and licentiousness which formed their leading characteristics It can also be well understood that theatrical performances during the Roman period were still more hateful to the ascetic and sombre minded Hebrews The mysteries of the Middle Ages were of a character to confirm the low in all that he had read or heard of the blasphemous tendencies of theatrical performances Thus, up to a comparatively recent date, the Jews looked upon the stage as the medium through which even thing which was repugnant to humanity, opposed to morality, and antagonistic to religion, was represented Nothing is stranger than the reaction which has since taken place The basis for a special extra turn of Jews as Jews, which has almost ceased to exist in these days, came well within the province of the dramatist of the middle ages But the theatre did not then provide that mystic power for which pastoral Burns sighed in the lines O, w ad some power the giftie gie us To see ourselves as others see us The Hebrew had in the main very little mercy served out to him in the mimic world of the stage Like the dyer's hand, he was condemned to what he was obliged to work in It was the old story " I've beaten my dog so long that he must be mad so throw him in the mer " The earliest representation of the Jew on the English stage dates back to the commencement of the sixteenth century Before either Marlowe's Birabas of Shakespeare's Shylock appeared, Stephen Gomm, in his " School of Vbuso," had commenced a play entitled " The low, show no at the Bull " Unhappily no further trace of this play is extant Shylock, as acted by Shake petrol s friend Burbage, was a comic figure His make up consisted of exceedingly red hair and beard, a false nose, preternaturally long and booked, and a tawny petticoat Such a figure must have been largely meant to make of me for the pit and gallery, of which Shakespeare was rarely oblivious, and Babbage never But a conv cational stage figure is generally an evolution, and this farcical Shylock was no except *t The famous Isaac 01 Norwich was a typical Jew in his time A thirteenth-century caricature, preserved in the Poll Offices, shows us the popular notion of him He is pictured as a three-faced idol surrounded by devils, and we may detect in the figure the reflection of a period when the diabolical theory of the Jew was serious and no laughing matter Similarly in the old miracle plays Satan was a serious figure, though he gradually became a mere laughing stock, like Pantaloon in the pantomime The stage Jew shared the same decline as the stage dev in his supposed inspirer In his malignant and formidable aspect he appeared in the Endingei Judempitl, a German mystery play, shown for the first time in the sixteenth century on the market place of Endingen itself and subsequently is the main figure of a popular English play Marlow c's "Jew of Malta" Burabos, the Jon of Malta, is closely related to the figure of Isaac of Norwich,

English stage, through force of the more real character which Shakespeare drew and if that grotesque figure of the olden days should be acted now, he would be hissed in any theatre, and the ghost of Shakespeare, were be present, would probably join in the sibilant chorus Kio Treneliman, Duque, with that want of wit which rushes boldly in where even in angel would put his foot in it, produced a " Juif de Venice," in which the merchant proves to be only son to Shylock and the same bungler makes a very ordinary thing of the Jon Bamboccia in his Salvator ROSE" There was also a fantastical drama of the same character called " Lo Juif Lrraut " represented in Paris at a somewhat later date, in which Satan, the Archangel Michael, Barnbbas, Puck, Ariel, Napoleon, Franklin, Marcus Aurelius, Time, Death, and the seven deadly sins all bad parts Alexandre Dumas (fish) declared in his preface to "La returns do Claude" that it was matter of agreement that on the stage the few ought to be grotesque A special brand of low has therefore been invented in drawn, whose functions it is to play the buffoon, and to be clothed with impossible vices Justus in a booth at a fair a coarsely devised picture is exhibited to attract the attention of passers by, so certain monstrosities, labelled 1 "Jews," are paraded at the theatre to relieve the dramatist in a dilemma of dullness That excellent dramatic critic M Auguste Vitu well describes a painful and too common literary style as that comic vein which never fetches a high To works of real humour and caricature these dramatic present- ments bear the same relation as a mock valentino does to a genuine Hogarth or Cruickshank Almost the only exceptions to this general con- demnation of the Jew on the stage are Lessing's " Nathan Der Weise and Dio Juden," Richard Cumberland's "The Jew," Daudet's " Ross on Exil," and Erkmann-Chatnnn's " LAnd Fritz "
