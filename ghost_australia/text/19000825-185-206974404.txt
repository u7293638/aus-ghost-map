WAS IT A SPIRIT? The late State. Senator Walters, of Vir ginia, while far from being a superstitions man, was heard on more than one occasion to say that he could not altogether disbe- lieve. in ghosts., ; He made ao profession $f faith, .m spectral :appajritiohs,. but* poriKhg ■to kin town - account, was - withheld from, denial of-them ;by the recollection'of a single very efcrange occurrence. ' 'One. afternoon,: in the autumn, of 1834, .he was looking for deer.in a lonely .valley within ten miles of the town of Pinckney, Virginia, .when he struck into a. narrow road much overgrown with weeds, and evi dently unused for. a long time. After , a bit he came to a house* which likewise showed signs of disrepair, having been de prived even of its windows and: doors— probably because these useful"articles had been deemed by'somebody worth carrying away. • On this account the dwelling had a*singularly blank and unhomelike appear ance, and theieenator was rather surprised to see a 'man. standing on the dilapidated porch in front. The man had his hands in hie pockets, and wore a pair of blue-jeans overalls, a check shirt, and. no hat. His hair was red. . All of-these points were distinctly noted by the. senator, who . paused'ana shouted a-cheerful salutation. -No reply being elicited, hephouted again; but the person on the porch appeared .to. take not the slightest notice.. .• It seemed very rude, .but the. senator'-was anxious Ito get-a bit of'information as to game, and so he ap proached the.house through a/gap, in the miserable, fence/the gate of which iyas ab sent. As he came near, however, j the man in, the. check shift ... and blue-jeans turned and walked slowly into the. deserted dwelling,' disappearing .'fioifi view, "v 1. ¥ “Hello replied ,the Mhator,' phlmoiihting the poroh and arriving at the.Vdodrway; but there was,ho response.
