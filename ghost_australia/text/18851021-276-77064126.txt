STRAY LEAVES FROM MY NOTE BOOK. (By SDNDOWNKR.) o* S,-THE DRINKIXA HABITS OF TUB . ^ . I'KllioD, At ft largo and representative meeting of licensed victuallers, held in Adelaide on Monday ovoning, September 28, it was re Bolved to levy the following retail charges on Bpn'its to the publio :-" For draught spirits indoors or outside, 4d, per nobbier j for all cage spirits indoors ana outside, 6d. per nobbier; Honnessy's Three-star brandy, 8d. per nobbier j ruin, 4d. por nobbier 5 wines port or sherry-6d. per nobler or glass," The above notioe wenttheroundBof the Proaaa few c'ays ago, the meeting having been held in qonsequonoe of tho duty on imported spirits fcoiug raised from twolvo to fourteen ehiiliaga per gallon. The notioo is inetruotive, and should attraot the &ttention; of thoao residents j , 7Â® South-East who are in the habit of Indulging in intoxicating spirits, with respeot to the pnoa they have been oharged for a number of years past when purchasing the porniaious IJmd, the pleasure of whioh, when paitaken of, is of so transient A oharaoter. in tne IrafcA's Penola correspondent's Jotter of Wednesday last the writer has given a lengthy, extraot from a pamphlet on the drink question, said to have been written by Lord Brainwell (one of the mlges of Great Britain). Admitting, however, that the learned lord is tho writer of the articles from whioh tho Watch corres pondent has drawn so copiously, it is cer tainly an anomalous position for a judge to plaoe himself in, for on the one hand he has expressed, in his judicial oapaoity, that at least three-fourths of the orimea committed in the United Kingdom are ocoasioned by drink, \vhile on tho other ho has drawn a flattering pioture of the pleasures to bo de rived from its indulgence 1 Which of tho two piotures is the most agreeable to oon template is, of course, a matter of opinion. But I doubt very muoh the theory put for ward by the Watch correspondent, or the genuineness of his beliof in the assertion that the majority of right thinking men will agreo with tho deductions drawn by Lord Brainwell with respeot to the pleasure to be derived from a "moderate" indulgenoe in the use of intoxicants, The term moderate 'is of so comprehensive a character that it would be well if newspaper correspondents would defjne its truo meaning, or give their own definition of the word ore they rush into print for tho purpose of charging men with intemperata speaking and exaggeration, Notwithstanding the high authority quoted by the Watch correspondent it is fortunate for the world generally that thero are to be found both men and women who are at all tiraos ready to brave the obloquy that may bo attempted to be thrown upon them for their endeavours to cheok the dissipated habits of those wretched beings who, not having any moral restraint over themselves, have drifted, and aro daily drifting, into tho lowest depths of misery and degradation, whioh is so frequently tho ending of many of thoso who oommence the pernicious habit of excess by first indulging in the pleasures derived from the "moderate nse of intoxioating drink, However much tho earnest, workers and advooates in the oauso of temperauoo and total abstinence \- may ba reviled, whether by noble lords or newspaper correspondents, they are steadily uiftking themselves felt and heard in every dirootioh j and the good oause in whioh they Wo BO zealously labouring is progressing, even if slowly, in all oiviliaed communities, Tho latest liquor statistics of Great Britain in form us that only 10 glasses of spirits per hoad is now oonaumed in that oountry, against IS par' head that was drank duriog 1875-? tho greatest drinking year that has beoa huown j and further that they have out off one glaas out of tho ten during the last four or five years, a serious diminution truly when the millions of population is taken into oon Bideration, How muoh better would it be if mankind gonerally wore to study the eloquent and stirring appeal to their good sensemadeby An aged missionary when addressing his audionoo in the wilds of Texas, '' There," said he, pointing his finger at tho matohlesa double spring gushing up like a shout of joy from tho Losom of the earth ; " thero is the liquor that God tho Ftornal brews for His children, Not in a simmering still over Btnoky fireB, choked with poisonous gases, surrounded with a stench of sickening odours, doth your Father in Heaven prepare the precious essonce of life-pure cold water-but in the gicen glades and grassy dells, whore the red doer wanders and tho ohild loves to play ; thero God brows it, and down low, down in tho deepest valleys, whore the fountain murmurs and the various rilla sing, and high upon tho mountain tops, where the nnked graoito glitters like gold in tho sun, V hero tbo storm-cloud broods, and tho thundorstorms crash, nnd away far out on tho wild wido sea, where the hurricane howls music, and tho big wavd rolls the ohorus, swooping the maroh of God-there Ho brews it, that boverago of life, health giving water-and everywhere it is a thing of lifo and beauty gleaming in the dow-drop, singing in the summer rain, shining in tho ice-gem till tho trees all seom to turn to liv ing jewols ; still it is always beautiful. No poison bubbles on its brink, its foam brings not madness and murder, no blood Btains its liquid glass, palo widows and starving orphans weep not burning tears in its depths, no drunkard's shrinking ghost from tho grave ourses it in words of eternal despair."
