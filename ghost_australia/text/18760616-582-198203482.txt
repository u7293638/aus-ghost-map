The fact is that in the early days the Government roughly made the creeks the boundaries, and so they have continued during all subsequent changes. As a set off against this, we have got a patch of country which does not belong to us. The intellectual bucolic electors of Muckleford vote for the Castlemaine triumvirs, instead of the beloved of Maldon, althought many of them are four miles nearer to the latter. Whether the new arrangement, which would give Castlemaine its own people at the other side of the two creeks, and detch from us Muckleford, will be acquiesed in, or resisted will of course depend on whether the change would be favourable, or the contrary, to Messrs Patterson, Farrell, and Walker res- pectively. There are of course other anoma- lies in connection with the boundaries of our electoral district, but we have taken the most salient for illustration. As wo stated some week's since, the new Reform 'Bill will not bnly be no revplutibnaiy measure, but it, will be a most unambitious and prosaic "one. It ' will simply deal with .iarhgemenb.f/./o ' boundaries and the re-distributipn pfseats. /The former niay notbe resisted j the latter will mostassurediy.be fought. tooth.and- nail in every instance where it is proposed, to lop .off , a mejnbei; ; frppi a dis trict. . ; .

The advantages of this patriotic programme over tho present system of payment is said mainly' to consist of this, that it will give tlie country constituencies real local members. If, after having boon elected, the latter sell their goods and chattels, and go to live in Melbourne, then they will not be reimbursed. Thus, our three members for example, would be compelled to spepd their nine hundred a year during the recesses amongst the Castle. rnnine ;bu tellers and bakers, instead of patron ising the Melbourne tradesmen, and if thoy persisted in the latter course then tlioy should joqe i their dotation from the Stale.
