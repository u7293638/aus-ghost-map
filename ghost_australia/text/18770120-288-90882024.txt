Did you ever, gentle reader, in your wan derings come unexpectedly on alone flower, rearing its wee head in neglect and obscurity, and seeming to have no particular mission in the world but to wither and die ? I think you have. You came upon it in the most unlikely place — perhaps among shaggy, frowning rocks, or in the midst of a barren waste, or on the brink of a boiling torrent, ?where a single spray would have swept it to destruction ; but there it -was, catching the faintest glimpse of the sunshine, breath ing the tiniest portion of the air, unchoked by surrounding weeds, and smiling upwards, untarnished and unhurt, while it fulfilled its mission. That mission might be to set you a-thinking — perhaps to inspire you with some pure thought or kind feeling, or to point you to a holier and better life. Nature repeats itself. Human flowers crop out here and there in just the same way and under the same adverse circum stances. Perhaps you will say this is a truth unlikely to be discovered by a detec tive. Ah, it is the lot of a detective to come upon many sweet and tender things even in the prosecution of his stern calling. The following stoiy presents a case in point. Hundreds knew Spirit Nelly, and those hundreds, looking in wonderment and awe upon her slender figure, strangely winning ways, and soft dark eyes, unearthly in their lustre, first said she was like a spirit, and then for shortness called her Spirit Nelly. Spirit Nelly was just thirteen, and too white and pinched-looking to be beautiful. It was not want so much as a world of care and thought that dwelt in her oval ^face, and made strangers turn round and gaze after her as she glided along our smooth streets carrying her paper screens, flowers, and other tasteful handiwork. Nelly's father was a thief — a powerful, hulking villain, who upon one occasion had broken a policeman's arm, and nearly bitten off one of McSweeny's ears — but of course she could not help that. She had tried hard to help it or amend it ever since she had been able to put two ideas together ; but though she had a great hold on her father, crime had a stronger one, and all her schemes and plans seemed to be thrown to the winds. Every year saw Nelly more slender arid spirit-like, every year saw Tom Heath, her father, more depraved, more involved with the worst of criminals, and more reckless and daring than before. His wife Kate — Spirit Nelly's mother: — kept a cheap lodging-house or traveller's home away up at the top of one of those hisrh lands in the Lawnmarket, and had a hard enough struggle to live. Live, did I say ? She didn't five. Her life was a continual death. The villain she was tied to absorbed all the profits of her house and more, and when he failed to make up what more his pockets demanded outside in his own way, he came home and vented his fury and strength on her. To lift up a fender or a stool and fell her to the ground were but common occurrences with him. The only gleams of happiness that made life endurable to the poor, long-suffering woman were the society of Spirit Nelly and the absence of her husband, when we had him safe by the heels iri prison. Then they had happy times, and* the 'huggery- muggery' garret they retained for their own use appeared a little heaven. Singing was there, and sunshine, and quiet joy ; and the rosy paper which they 'cut and crimped with nimble fingers into flowers then seemed positively to throw its reflection up into Spirit Nelly's cheeks. '- : ? And did they hate the cause of so' much misery. and unhappiness? Reluctantly, I must confess the truth— No.* Did they love 'him ? Still' more reluctantly, and quite as truthfully, t must say — Yes. Spirit Nelly loved him because he was her- father — because, he never; struck Jier, and because she could see good in him that no one else had eyes for ; and Kate Heath loved him because — ;because she was a woman and he her husband. And so they prayed and hoped, and fought back the crushing despair- which often tried to creep into their hearts, and Nelly yearned afte.r her father as the one object which she was willing tp live or die to save from crime or evil. ' But Fm afraid it's all no use/' she said one day to her mother, over the paper work which kept them from starvation. ' I don't see what God sent me into the world for at all — :onlv to be a burden to vou and every one else.' 'A burden, Nelly?' cried the mother, looking up at the strange words. 'Do you r want to cut my heart open .that you. said them cruel words? A burden !': and -she dropped paper, scissors, and all to strain, Spirit Nelly to her 'brfeast. 'You are all, my world, Nelly, and if you were taken I would lay down and die.' ^sfelly thought something which had of ten dwelt in her mind .-before,; but it took along time to bring it to. her lips. Her lone was low when she answered, but .every breath of it fell sharp and quick on the mother's ears. ? 'Ah, but, mother, I will' be taken some day — I'm so weak, and — oh, mother, what have I said?' ?;''?? A stony whitening of her mother's, face had caught her uplifted eye, and, with a fearful pang at her heart, she drew her mother's face to her bosom, and then tried to lass away the imprint of terror. , ' Nelly !' gasped the mother. ' You're always strange, but if you love me— if you don't want to Mil me, never speak such a word again.' ' I won't, I won't ! There, don't look so awful. You don't understand me. I meant that I would perhaps nol; live so long — so long as other folks — that's all-— that's all, - mother. . But HI live a long time yet — oh, Tin sure of 'that !' but the nasty assurances; only brought the tears in tb- mother's eyes - and it took a great deal of kissing to get thepia,way. - ? NeUy tried to throw 'the; sunshine of a smile through her own tears, and, drawing her mother closer, whispered — '« Nowtisten, mother, and fll tell you why Tin sure — because on Sunday I heard that every one, though they should only live a day or two, has some good to do in the world. My good isn't done yet. It won't be done till father is an honest, good man. Something tells me so, and that, I'm afraid, will be a long, long time,' and strangely enough, with the smile of triumph there came a heavy, weary sigh. ' So you see, mother, I'll be spared — ohr ever so long !' ' And you're doing the good every day,' rejoined the mother, carried away for the moment by the girlish reasoning. ' No one has such power over him as you, and the wonder is that when you beseech him he does not change entirely. But he won' : : and it'll go on and on till he kills somebo 1 y, and gets hung for it and disgraces us all for ever. Oh, wistharu ! did ever I think, when I was a young, simple girl, and took him for better or worse, that I'd be the wife of a thief and a robber!' There could be no cheering answer to this, but by and bye Nelly found courage to break the silence and say — ' There's something on your mind to-day, mother; I've seen it ever since he went out. May I know about it ?' ' You're better without it, darling,' re turned the mother, darkly and bitterly. 'The trouble'll come soon enough without you knowing- now.' Nelly whitened at the words, and her eyes shone out, as they always did when sue was under great excitement. ' Is it danger to 7dm f' she got out, with a gasp. 'Yes; and disgrace to us. It's the old thing over again. You might know that when you see that devil-eyed hound, Barney Flynn, come sneaking about.' 'Then there's going to be a — a robbery,' faintly breathed Nelly, with great sinking at the heart. Her mother started forward and placed her hand over Nelly's mouth with a fearful glance around. 'I don't know that there is— I didn't say so, did I ?' she said, in alarm. ' No, but I guessed it. Don't be afraid for me, mother,' returned Nelly, with startling calmness. ' I will not faint. I am firm and strong now. I could see the world burst in pieces and not he moved. But, tell me, can we not save him ?' A mighty strength had suddenly sprung up out of Nelly's weakness, and her mother gazed on the radiant eyes and firm-set lips in amazement. ' I've thought of that, and I've thought of a plan,' she hesitatingly returned ; ' but you're only a girl, and there's danger in it. He might kill you.' 'Never mind me. He will not kill me — not though I angered him ever so,' firmly returned Nelly. . ' Til save him. Tell me the plan.' ' I'm doing wrong,' cried the yielding mother, with a burst of tears. 'Evil will come of it.' Nelly stopped the words with a kiss, and waited to hear. 'But it's difficult,' demurred the mother, with a look up at the clock ; 'besides, I'm not sure but it's too late now.' ' Oh, tell me quick what it is !' cried Nelly, starting up with feverish haste, and beginning to tie on her bonnet. ' Well, they're to meet at twelve o'clock, at Barney's house in the Cowgate— in the 'back place where they used to keep, the sticks. He let it all out in his sleep last night, and I heard every word.' ' It's near twelve now,' put in Nelly. 'Goon!' ' Well, if you' could get into the yard behind unseen, and get up by some of the barrels or barrowson to the shed, and then crawl along the boards unknown'st to them till y«u're above their heads, you might hear every word they say.' 'I'll doit. Well— the rest?' 'The robbery's to be to-night. If you could find out where it's to be, and keep it in your^mindj we may save your father.' '.' Would you tell the people, that's to be robbed?' '.. 'No; because they're away from town ; and besides, they'd 'be all caught alike that 'way.''' ''?'''' ' You won't tell the police?' ,. ' Not.- exactly ; for they'd have little niercy,-)n your father. He's been there too often already. Besides, we couldn't get near the office without being watched or, seen by somebody, and the news would fly to them like the wind. He'd murder us both that way.' ' ?'?You. have another plan — I know you have.!'- ' ' Yes, and this is it. If you can find out all about the robbery, there's a detective called McGovan who, might be able to help : us.; They say he's la,', kind man at the bottom, and never takes a cruel advantage of folks even when: they're in his power. I don't know where he lives, except that if s either in Bristo-street or Charles-street ; but if you went there, carrying- your screens, you could hunt him. out, and no one would suspect what you were after— not though they saw you going.' , 'Til find him out, and I think he'll help me !' said Nelly^ with a strange kindling of tne eye. , . . ' But mind, he must save your father — that is the . condition. Make that sure before ybu teirhim a word.' ' I will make that sure.' There were only five words, but Nelly spoke them with a heavy, distinct emphasis on; each; .more as if impressing' them on her own mind than addressing them to her mother. \ 'Then tha£s all. Fly now, like a darling; aiidOod'sTjlelssinggdwithyou.'' [ Nelly did fly. - She cut down the long stairs a8;Tvhite and swift as a ghost, crossed the streetyand flew down by the West Bow, to the Greenmarket, and thence turned into the Cowgate. Just as she passed under George IV.'s Bridge, she heard twelve strike. The autumn sun was shining bright, and strong, but a great darkness had settled on Spirit Nelly's, heart, and she neither saw nor felt it. She soon came to a low, dark entry,- very dirty and foul,, and without hesitation glided in, and made her way to a deserted yard awav up behind, shrouded from the sun by the crowding, rotten houses looming up on every side. In hurrying out' into the semi- darkness she stumbled, almost fell, over a shock-headed ragamuffin squatted on the ground, dig ging holes with his hands. 'jLqok whtjre you're goin', can't ye !' shouted the child, ^viih an jpaith. ' There's nobody lives up there, so ye needn't go.' 'Without uttering a word or -sound, Nelly glided swiftly on and vanished. A. num ber of unused' fish-barrows, and a pile of boxes and barrets, Md lie]; f r,om, the; boy's Sight, But his curiosity was roused, and he left his mud pie-maknig to hunt her out and watch. He saw her get up on the roof of a donkey shed with some difficulty, scram bling and climbing^ and begin to crawl along the boards to an outhouse in the next close. She looked round fearfully every foot of the way, and got more and more cautious in her movements, but she stopped at last. 'She's on the top of Barney Flynn's woodhouse,' sadd the boy to himself. ' Whatever can she want there ? Til tell . my father if he comes home to-day, for he sometimes goes in there to play at dominoes. She's listenin' like. She's not feared — I , wouldn't do that for something, 'cause father thrashed me for only asking what was inside of it. Pr'aps I'd better not say anything about it, in case I get another thrashing. I'd better get out of here, quick ;' and with . this thought he ran off and amused himself elsewhere. The odd cir cumstance was soon forgotten, but his boyish memory was destined tabe quickened on' the subject before twenty-four hours had passed away. Meanwhile Kelly was listening. Three men were below her, and had the boards only been a degree more rotten, she would have crashed through, and dropped into their very midst. The first speaker was her own father. 'We'll, I've brought. the tools, and we're all here,' he said. ' Let's hear about the job.' 'Softly,' interposed another man, whose voice Nelly could £not recognise, but who afterwards turned out to be Tim Regan, the father of the boy she had just passed in the yard, ' softly. We must first decide which place it's to be. It'll be time enough then to arrange about ...the 'stowing of the swag.' 'Well, which is it to be ?' returned Tom Heath, a little tartly. ' Decide that for yourselves — it's all one tome. I don't pro fess to be an area sneak.' . . 'But I do,' said Regan, with a soft laugh. 'Tni afraid you've risen off your wrong side this morning,. Tom ; you're so devilish cross.' ?? ~ 'Ugh, don't let's quarrel,' interposed ; Barney Flynn. ' Is it to be Blacket-place or Lander-road?' 'Well, Lander-road's the safest,' re plied Regan. ' If s lonely, and there would be few about ; but there's not so much to lift.); For a good haul, I say No; — , Blacket place.' 'All right — you're the best judge. Let it be Blacket-place ; we may try the other again. How are we to get in ?' ' At the back. There's one of the inside shutters ajar — the fastening's come loose, I think. We can easily manage, it ; it's only five feet from the ground.' « What time shall we meet ?' 'Say twelve— at the Cemetery gate in Preston-street. We can go round by the back way, and get over the railings one by one as soon as the bobby is past. If any one is past the hour, we don't wait for him, and he loses all right to share. Is it agreed?' : 'Agreed.' There was a pause after the last rejoinder. Nelly could not see it, but the three were making some peculiar motions with the^r hands, which iDound 'them to inviolable secresy and good faith. Fearing that they were coming out, she moved quicker and more unguardedly than she had hitherto done. ? 'What's that ?' criedone, starting up. 'Rats; don't bother,' calmly returned Barney Flynn. And Nelly heard no more. She was down into the next yard with:a run and a scramble, bruising and' skinning her kneejB in the fall, but feeling, heeding nothing'. People saw a sacred, white face speeding up the Cowgate, but such a thing was common there, and excited no remark. And so it came that; after '* what seetned an age of suspense, Kate Heath heard her daughter's light step on the lobby floor qnce more, and rushed to open the door^and catch her almost fainting in her arms. ''.. One fear was uppermost. - ' . ' Did he see you ?' ? ,'; , ' v ' .'Nor' ;???,????? v ' ?/.:.-;? ?...:: ?*?;?;.:???. 'Poor darling, ypuice! nearly deail ;-.with, flight.

' ?;.-?.' . ;. .?.?? ,: The words were quietly spoken, but there was a rigid determination in the tone that the mother knew it was jlseless to try to move, .?'...''.!'..?' In a few . moments Nelly was out in. the sun again, carry ing .her fluttering mass of gaudy tissue paper and hurrying soutk wards-von business. Yes, there was no loitering with her. People stared at her white face, fevered cheeks, arid brilliant ? eyes, and fancied, as she flitted past them, that she was rarely beautiful. But they, were wrong... It was a beauty of wild fear and terrible excitement— a beauty that had behind it a great rush of tears, only waiting a mere word or touch to burst forth and flobdall. She began at -the top of Bristo-street iand/ worked her way downwards; taking Charleis-' street «n the way. Had she heen able to ''? read, she might have found. my house quicker; but asit was, shehadnot'oiily to stopat every door, but 'make very cautious enquiries as well. . . ,. . : At about half-past one my wife opened the door in answer to a very gentle .knock, and was about: to close it again with little more than ' a glance at Nelly^s wares, when* some words caught ?her ear and made ,her .pause...

The lower sash of the window was raised to the top, the man outside tugged Ms cap tighter on his head, swung himself ! into the room, and then turned and waited for the other. The second made a scram bling slip in getting up, and was cursed ieartilv in a whisper by the other looking out on him. At hist both were in, and then Flynn — I knew his voiee — said — '? Close the shutters, before we turn up £he glyna.' They did close the shutters, and bar them, too — much more securely than the owner of the house had done ; and then the slide of a dark lantern was turned back, , and the light flashed full — on my face ! I don't think he recognised me. but the sight of a human face was too much for kirn. 'With a frightful yell, he dropped the lantern, and then I had him fast. The others, with a sharp struggle and fight, throttled and secured the other ; and then ?we took a breath and turned up our own lanterns. The eyes of the handcuffed and pinioned burglars instinctively sought each other. » 'Betrayed!' ' That hell-hound, Heath !' they gasped, almost simultaneously. ' Now, there you're wrong,' I interposed. '^ Heath is innocent of peaching as you are yourselves; and if he had got this' length he would have been nabbed too — but he didn't. We took care of him beforehand.' My word was law even among thieves, and they looked puzzled accordingly. But no more was said ; and, leaving a man on the premises, we took them away and locked them up. - ? And now comes a part of my story which I wish I could cut off. My pen seems to travel more slowly as I approach it. At 8 o'clock next morning, Tom Heath ?wasunhandcuffed by myself and set free, ;with a few words of advice, which he enly received with a sullen and ferocious scowl. He' did not go straight home. No ; after leaving McS weeny's he made for the ? Cowgate, where he spent some time hunting about and collecting information in -various ways. Then, with Bloodshot eyes, ^whitened lips, and twitching fingers, he made his way to the Lawnmarket. : Nelly and her mother, at the first glance, saw that he knew all, and shrank back shivering and white. r . *'\I've warned ye, times upon times, agaiast betraying ine or my pafe,' he said 'wi& frightful calmness, addressing his -wife. -f You?ve.'4oaie;. it, and I mean* to laS, 'y&aF; and the last two words came out T^Lth a fierce, wolfish snap. , '' 'Father, father ! it wasnft her — I did it «U !' burst in Nelly, springing forward and ?dropping on her knees before him. 'Oh, 3nll me— but let mother live !' He pushed Bet from bimi ' I don't hlame the girl,' he heedlessly ?continued, still keeping his eyes fixed on ids wife. ' You set her on to it. I've heard it all from the boy whxrwatched her . at it. . Traitor! why have you only one iifef; — why can't I kill you twice?' and, foaming at the mouth, he hurled Nelly. aside and sprang on the defenceless woman. They struggled together; terrible screams Tang out, mingled with hoarse curses, and - then, with a terrific wrench, Kate Heath tore herself free and snatched up a knife. He saw. the position, felt for the poker, arid then with deadly distinctness, keeping his' eye steadily on the bright weapon, , Mssed out — . a Lay down the knife !' ,- 'Iwon'tP The poker was swung back in the air. \- ' lay down the knife 3' '?

' You must rest, Nelly,' he feverishly got out : ' you must sleep and get well.' ' I — I— will rest,' breathed the girl, with a faint smile wreathing her lips. ' Is — is mother there ?w ' Yes ; here, here, darling !' ' Let me feel your hand ; every thing seems to be growing dim. I don't see the light on the sea now. Is it turning dark?' A choking burst of sobs was the answer. ' Hold me higher, father — higher. Take mother's hand — so. You won't — won't steal any more ?' ' Never more, so help me heaven !' ' Ah, Tin glad of that ! I think— I think I'm going to die now, mother. Hush, hush ! don't cry. You ought to be glad; for father— father ? ' ' A strange sinking and the fading light in her eyes drew a sudden scream from her mother. At the startling sound a few words seemed to shape themselves on Spirit Nelly's lips, but no sound came. Her eye lids drooped; a slow, heavy sigh escaped her ; and 'Spirit Nelly was gone for ever. No one charged Heath with her death, though all the circumstances were fully known to us. No punishment that man could have inflicted could have equalled what he endured. In one night his dark hair had turned completely grey. For ' some months he wandered continually be tween the Lawnmarket and the churchyard where Nelly was laid ; but no one would have recognised him as the same man. He hardly ever spoke, and certainly never smiled. At last some friends advised his wife to get him away from the scene of his troubles. Their things were sold off, and they took 'passage for South Australia. In that country they have done well, Heath working at sail naaking, to which he had served an appren ticeship in his youth. But they have no desire to return ; and the last letter I got from them was simply a request to send them a tuft of grass or a flower from Spirit Nelly's grave. :
