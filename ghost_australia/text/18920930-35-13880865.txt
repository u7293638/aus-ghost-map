SIR GEORGE DIBBS AND AUSTRALIAN FINANCE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir-At seemed only a reasonable expectation that when Sir George Dibbs reached Sydney we should have some valuable information given to us on the subject of the present and prospective position of New South Wales, with regard to our indebtedness to Great Britain So much has been said of late about colonial loans-so p enounced has become the antipathy of British empire -as to further borrow- ings that Sir George D sought to have come back prepared to speak t actively on the whole subject But what has see the case is Sir George has been as silent as the grave on the central and vital points, and has prattled airily on points that are, comparatively, exceedingly trifling With our team below par, a long way below par, it is a more waste of time to talk about converting them into one stock, orders it appear much visor to choose a per ed when Australian loans art views I with suspicion to try to force them on British trustees On these two points Sir George has dilated, and he also has asserted that he has removed some of the anxiety felt by investors as to the value of our securities But Sir George is dumb as to the probability of our being able to shortly float the further loans that are required to take up the floating Treasury bills, and to carry out the works' policy of his Govoruuiout Then, Sir George has absolutely nothing to tell us about the serious position which has to be faced c sequent on the unlimited borrow- ings of past years Surely he learnt something, yet he tells us nothing Australia is face to face with serious difficulties, but that fund of wisdom is not forthcoming, which a New South Wales Premier might have been expected to gather with opportunities such as Sir George has possessed It is all very well for anyone to elude British investors as to their anxiety about our ability to carry our vast obligations, but I assert without the least hesitation that no Australian Premier is fit for his position till he has fully acquainted himself with the character and inevitable consequences of our policy of getting into debt A few days ago, in reading Dr Lang s historical records, I came across the following referring to the " bad times" of 1812-3 -1 -"Numerous papers were published in the colonial journals, and numerous speeches were delivered at public meetings, explanatory of the causes of the present monetary crisis, as it was courteously termed, an 1 assigning for in every case but the right one, viz ; the gross delusion into which the whole community had simultaneously fallen in supposing that the real and permanent wealth, either of individuals or of the colony generally, could be greatly increased by any other means than by patient and persevering industry and economy " Dr Lang also refers to " the extraordinary facilities that had existed for obtaining the use of money, or, in plain English, for getting into debt " Who can- not recognise how history is repeating itself. Melbourne is the great example hut all Australia is suffering to some extent from the same cause. Everyone knows that Sir George Dibbs has been a great behovcr-perhaps the greatest believer in the colony in the policy of big borrowings, and it may be set down as a certainty that when he went to London he meant rather to place the the way for further big loans than to make any bookkeeping arrangement w lib regard to existing indebtedness It is clear that Sir George has utterly, absolutely, failed to create any desire for further supplies of our securities That the Premier did to some extent relict of the fears of timid holders of our securities, I grants, but that is all, and there is at present not the ghost of a chance of our being able to raise any con side able loan in London except under humiliating conditions Viewing this the of affairs from the standpoint occupied by my self, as shown in the series of articles from my pen, which were published during June in the Herald, I am satisfied that it is for the good of Australia that the borrowings of the post cannot be continued. From the standpoint occupied, recently at any rate, by Sir George Dibbs, it is bad for this colony (if not for all Australia) that loans are being refused YY hat does the Premier propose to do in view of a works policy which demands money that cannot be obtained' Then comes the question whether, while in contact in London with leading financiers, Sir George did not begin to recognise the gravity of the existing position, the counterpart of which does not exist in any other part of the English speaking world It would not be strange if his views were modified and if they are we ought to know At all events it is passing strange to com- pare the silence of the Premier on the financial position with her volubility on what are comparatively mere idle detail I may say that I have to-day received letter from Mr A T Wilson of the investor 5V.r?tii,u.,iiithe course of which referring to mv articles on " Capital and Finance in Australasia,'' he says that it is' a great relief to meet with a serious student of Australian finance among the colonists themselves ," and he adds, " Nothing could well be more heart- breaking to a political economist than the frivolity and ignorance almost uniformly displayed by your people A low cheap sneers, the epithet a pessimist freely pitched about, and the earnest and informed writer is treated as answered. So long as you treat a question which lsbojoudall others vital to the future prosperity of those young nations In this spirit of childish frivolity, so long must I continue to fear that the course they have pursued for the last quarter of a century can have only one end disaster " Mr Wilson is well known as a very keen critic of Australian finance, and though at times some of his blows are a little wide of the mark, yet his criticism contains only too much that is true Whether we will or now he must sooner or later face the position, and it is not right for the Premier to keep us in the dark as he is doing as to the actual results of his visit to London The ignorance that undoubtedly exists all through Australia on the subject of the consequences of our indebtedness is, I have long felt, responsible for a widespread and erroneous and session In business circles, where the existing depression is severely felt, it is the belief that lo bout troubles are at the root of it all I believe the depression springs from several causes, mainly The falling-off in the amount of new capital mv ested in Australia 2 The burden of interest, £1.1,01)0,000 to £18,000,000 a year, on existing indebtedness is the unprofitable character at present of the pastoral industry Those are the main factors The strike trouble is certainly a factor, but one of much smaller dimensions than any one of the others the anxiety about labour his run into extravagance in several directions I mention this as one of the consequences of an in sufficient grasp of the vital points of Australian finance I am, c, E EDWARD PULSFORD.
