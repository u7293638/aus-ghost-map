A girls' match, between teams from Hockley and Tarana, was played the other day, and was remarkable for the high scores made. The liockloy girls put up the respectable score of 470, while the Tarana willow-wielders put together a total of 567. Edith Wil son made 200 not out, and Mildred Barnes 106. Several others also got into double figures. Quite a romarkable match was played at Dundee on Saturday after noon. Emmaville met Dundee in the Shield Competition. Tbe home team went in first and when they had scored 150 with no wickets down they closed their innings, thinking no doubt that tbe task of piling up three half cen turies was too great for their opponents (playing with eight men) — who wouldn't? But Emmavillo did com pile the 150 and 8 more besides. With GO minutes to play Dundee forced their second innings but after they had made 42 they gave up the ghost and game, Emmaville tbue winning on the first innings by 8 runs. At lunoh hour, when Dundee scoro read 0 for 120, Einmavillo's great enthusiast and leader of sport, threw off his re4 skull eap, walked over it three times, jumped in bis buggy, and drove home— -disgusted. How he re ceived 'his boys' when he heard they had won in the faoe of all this, is not yet known. [As we know ' Redcap Jim,' wo can guess how he felt on re ceiving tbe news. — Ed. A.]
