THE EX-EMPEROR NAPOLEON HI. The Times, speaking of the Emperor Napo Icon, observes : — ' The character of Napo leon III. will long remain one of the eiuViv-J of history. Weaker in its composition °thaii that of his uncle, it will be universally al lowed hereafter — as those who can riJ above prejudice allow now — that it contains, better elements. No misgivings ever dis turbed the serene selfishness of the first Em peror, lie co.uld sacrifice armies and na tions without compunction. The ghosts of the tens of thousands who died for his ends never haunted his . conscience. He could leave an army buried in the snows of Russia and warm his hands before a fire at Warsaw with no other thought than 'This is better than Moscow.' The exile who will soon he among us possesses little of this compact strength. Always halting and irresolute of purpose, and never more so than during the last months of his reign, he has been averse from war, aud only entered into the contest with Germany because he dreaded what might otherwise be the resentment of France.. In his heart he has believed in the fulfilment of the cloudy dreams of his early manhood. He anticipated France in the inauguration of free trade,_ as we shall probably soon find by the adoption of a retrograde policy. His avowed detestation of the Treaties of 1815 was in a confused way mixed up with the rights of nationalities upon which he rested his claim to rule France. If, indeed, we com pare the present fugitive with, the refugees of 1830 and 1848, apart from the terrible dis asters which his last great fault has brought upon France, we may be induced to think that he deserves to be received with as much respect as they. The Citizen King showed, how little he cared for the interests of mil lions when he sacrificed Spain to enrich a son, and Charles X. was innocently incapable of looking upon subjects except as multitudes born to obey his will.'
