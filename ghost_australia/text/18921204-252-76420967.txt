LIFE AND DEATH. There met, one day, inside the church-porch low, Processions twain : one sable, one like snow. A mourner led the first, attired in night, Her sunlight gone because her arms were light, Bride-like, the other came, a radiant form A mother, with her treasure strong and warm. Now in that place, removed from storm and fret The two processions halted where they met. The mother, clasping closer yet her dear, Upon the tiny coffin dropped a tear. The mourner, wistful as the ghost of joy, Smiled through her tears upon the living boy.
