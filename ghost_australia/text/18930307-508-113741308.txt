The Row at the Royal. SCENE ON 'POVERTY POINT.' Up to a late hour on Monday that portion of King-street, near its intersection with Castle reagh-street, and known to the 'profesh' as 'Poverty Point,' was thronged with Thespians, and a large number of a curious and interested public. Messrs. Howe and Baker were the centre figures of an interested group near the circle entrance in Castlereagh street, and a little further on Harry Leston, the well-known comique, was bailed up by a crowd, to whom he had to give the rights of the case ad lib. It is stated that Messrs. Howe and Baker paid the salaries of the company yesterday morning, or in stage jargon caused 'the ghost to walk.' It is now a pretty definite understanding that actions between the lessee and the company, and vice versa, will be the outcome of Saturday's proceedings. The lessee, it is said, is to proceed against the company for a breach of agreement, and the latter will retaliate with a claim for wages.
