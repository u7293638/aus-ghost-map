CARA LEE. Keenly was the mistral blowing, 'Neath its kiss her cheek was glowing Thro' grey olives that were growing On the uplands near the sea; Strange—how clearly I remember That sixth morning of December, When, in insolence of beauty, I met haughty Cara Lee. Soon I saw that I could tame her; Tho' she knew my love must shame her, Foes might scorn, or true friends blame her, Little cared or counted she; While it lasted, that brief madness, Even presage brought no sadness, And remorse—we both defied it, Ah, too rashly, Cara Lee! Pain enough for worse offending, Came at last the bitter ending; Rare and sullen stars were lending Light enough her tears to see, Thro' the closed lids welling slowly; But her lips were silent wholly— Only mine own heart reproached me When I last saw Cara Lee. Every sin, if priest speak truly, Wrought in olden times, or newly, A strict judge will reckon duly, Gathering ghosts from earth and sea; The small voice I now keep under, Then perchance will speak in thunder; What—if I meet no more mercy Than I dealt to Cara Lee?
