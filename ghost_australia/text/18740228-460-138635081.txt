A novel—Well dam my akin I ■ You a man grown and bearded and hiatin' such Stuff ' ez that in— Stuff about gals and their sweethearts! Ko wondet you're thin ez a knife. Look at tne—clar two hundred—and never read one in my life. ■ That's my opinion o' novels And ez to their lyin* round here, They beloved to the Jodge'e daughter-the Jedge Who came up last year On account of his lungs and the mountains and the balsam o'pine and fir; And his daughter—well, she read novels, and that's what's the matter with her. Yet Bhte was sweet on the Jedge, and stuck by him day and night, Alone in the cabin bp yer—till she grew like a ghost, ail white. She wub only a Blip ot a thing, ez light and ez up -and away Ez rifle-smoke blown through the wood^ but she wasn't my kind—no way ! , ' 'e Speakin* o' gals, d'ye mind that house ez yon rise the hill, • A mQe and a half from White's, and jist, above kiat tingly's mill*? , You do?
