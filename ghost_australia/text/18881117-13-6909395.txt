THE RITUAL OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-At would be a pity if the desire of " Layman" for an answer to the question, " Mil) I ask. . , where the Church Hiawatha rised anyone to call the Lord's table an altar ?" should remain unsatisfied If no other correspondent has answered it, may I be permitted to do so with all possible brevity ÃŽ In the prayer-book of 1519 the terms 11 Lord's Table," "Und's Board and "Altar" were useelindiliereiiily. in the book of 1552 the term "Altar" disappeared. In that of 102 "-miles Bourel" also disappeared, and the Lord's Table" or Holy Table" only mentioned. The compilers of the book of 1552 probably dropped the term "altar" for the same reason as they omitted " Prayer for the faithful Dep rated," viz, on account of its close association in the minds of the people with those "Sue wheels of Misses" condemned in Article XXII At the same time they n in time is that the book of 15411 war compiled " by the and of the Holy Ghost," that it contained "nothing superstitious or ungodly "or linen was not agreeable to the Word of God and the primitive church.
