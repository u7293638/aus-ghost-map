' UAPTURE OF AN ALLIGATOR. Some very good sport was experienced (says , toe Cleveland Bay JSxpressJ by Mr. P. Thistle- towayte, Dr. CaUagban, and . some others, who succeeded in bagging an alligator. Mr. Thistle- thwayte, Who was standing on the verandah of Dr. Callaghan's cottage, overlooking the creek, saw an alligator swim to the opposite bank. Mr. Thirtieth wayte and Dr. Callaghan crossed over in a punt,_and were joined by a Jisherman. They managed to crawl within twenty yards of the alli- ! gator without disturbing him, arid the fisherman, armed with a shot gun, ami" Mr.'Thistlethwayte, with a rifle, both fired j the latter hit him' just behind the forearm, and the reptile crawled three or four pace's into the water, leaving his tail ex posed on the Lank. The three sportsmen rushed at and. seized the alligator's caudal appendage, and a most exciting struggle took place. The saurian made savage but ineffective attempts to bite his persecutors, who courageously stuck to his tail while others beat bim about the head ! with sticks until he gave up the ghost. When it Was ascertained that he was quite dead, he was towed across the creek, and it was found that he measured nearly 9ffc. in length.
