Original Poetry. THE BACHELOR'S VISION. [Mr. Shackell lias given notice of his intention to move in tlie Legislative Assembly for the imposition ol a tax upon all bachelors, between the ages of 25 and 50.—-Vide Press reports]. The bachelor slept one winter's night, Esuouced in l is snug arm-chair; The crackling fire-logs glowed all bright* Aud around threw a vivid glare. The faithful dog at his master's feet Lay in proud complacency^ And the brindle cat took his wonted seat Where a loving wife shoald be. The bachelor snored (moat bachelors do) Like a hunting-horn asthmatic; And in chorus screeched the coekatoo From his perch up in the attic. The midnight chimes had long been tolled,. And the 44 wee-sma' hours" crept on, And over the woodland^ copse, and wold, Old Sol rather dimly shone. Still the bachelor slept,and still he snored (For no cares nor griefs have they); And the faithful dog the fact ignored That it now was break-o'-day. . (Enter Shackell's ghost].. Gbogi Loquitur. Arise, awake, dull mortal, rise, Come,TcruBe thee irom thy couch ol sloth; (Heie the bachelor rubbed his-seedy eyes* And grunted a favourite oath}. Get up,-1 say, and hark to me, t .
