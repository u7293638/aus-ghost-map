QUEENSLAND EIFLE ASSOCIA TION MEETING AT LITTON. Tub annual matohea, whioh were to have been commenced last Thmsday afternoon, but whioh did not actually bogin until Friday morning, were oontinued until late on Satur day afternoon, when tbo meeting broke up, leaving unfinished the seoond stage of the Queen's Prize, the All-comers' Prize, and the Ooinmundunt's Prize. The uttempt muJo to uso the Lytton Bangs for tbo iiasociiition ma'ohes thix yunr oannot be said to have resulted in anything else than failure. The slow pace at whioh the mutches uaed to proceed at the email ruuge at York's Hollow wua very tedious, and involved a great loss of time to competitors, especially to those who had to loavo their buamosB during the whole time of tbe matches. This yt-ar the Volunteer authorities announced their intention of forming a rnugo at Lytton, whioh would' not only provide thti means of .^hooting at long distances, but also such a number of targets as would allow the usual programme to be gone through in a oouple of days, instead of a week or ten days. It waB also announced that a camp would be available,, and that a Government steuuier would ruu to Lyttou twice a day for the convenience of the xhooting men. Advantages such as these could not be dis regarded by the council of tho association, and they accordingly postponed the date of meeting from the Exhibition week until the middle of this month, by which time the new range wub to have beon completed. Up to Wednesday evning last, or even Thursday morning, it wua not known that the rango was incomplete. It was known that Colonel Klaxleud was at Lytton putting the place in order — and every reliance was placed upoti Mb acknowledged capacity of getting over difficulties, and upon his getting thn work completed. What with the difficulty of getting tho ironfounderu who contracted for the supply of target plates to carry out their contraot up to time, and many other causes of delay, which need not be referred to, the energetio com mandant of the Volunteer Foroe wus un able to have the rango ready for use. Several of the mantelets had to be put up in a hurried way, which did not allow of their being made perfectly safe for the men who had to signal the shots on the targets, and one or two of those temporary structures were knooked over by stray bullets, cansing a stoppage of the shooting, pending repairs. On Thunday afternoon, what with the awkwardness of the markers, added to their reasonable terror of being pep ered by frag ments of lead, things went bo badly that the members of the executive committee, who weie present, decided upon postponing the shoot ing until next morning,, to allow of the mantelets and targets being rendered a little safer. This delay necessitated the omiBsion of the Commandant's Cup from the programme. It waB hoped that the remainder of the programme would be carried out on Friday and Saturday, if no further hitoh should ocour. On Friday things went on a little better, but owing to sundry minor difficulties during the day, caused by the hurried way in which the propationa had been made,, it was fonnd on Friday evening that the All Comers' match would have to be omitted, and on Saturday things went so slowly and there were so many interruptions to the shooting, that the second stage of the Queen's oould not be completed, and the OonBolation prizoB were bo hastily transferred from the 500 yards range, whioh was in use all day, to the 200-yarda range, that several competitors were unable to enter for them The exeoutive oommittee were virtually absent from the range, with the exception of Major Moore, who was present during the whole meeting, and did his best under the difficult ciroumstancea. Major Mein was present on Baturday afternoon, and laeut. FbKtvn on Thursday and Saturday afternoons, and Captain Burrell on Thursday afternoon. The opinion was freoly expressed on the ground that in t'uture shooting men only ehould be put on the executive. It is the proviuue of the executive committeR to see all the arrange ments ourried out, and it is evidently unwise to put ou it any one who ia not prepared to be present on the ground eaoh day. On ull rifle ranges there are large danger flags kept flying on tall flugstafis. They serve the double purpose of warning strangers off the dangerous portions of the range, and of enabling competitors to estimate the forcu and direction of the wind. It was found that their absence at Lytton had a material effoot on the scores made, especially during Thursday. Several times it happened thut an unnoticed direction in the breeze threw the steadiest shots altogether off the targets, to tbe intense sur prieo of the competitors, who had not had time to become acquainted with the peculiarities of the range. Several competitor* happened to get onrbino ammunition instead of rifle ammu nition, and this wub the cuuse of tho failure of somo of them to make even ordinary shooting. It was expected thut there would bo four third-class, eight socond-claBS, and two fir-t-clafis targets available, and tho diury of the shooting was pre pared on that basis. As there wore only five second- clttsu targets, :ho calculations on which tho order of shooting was bused were of o- urse upset, to be still further thrown into confusion by the loss of all Thursday afternoon, and the delays on Friday and Saturday. The shooting — with only one or two excep tions, notably the scores of Mr. Stirling, who mado 12 successive bull's eyes at 500 yards, and 41 points out of 50 at 600 y«rds, being a totul of 91 out of a possible 100 in the International Matoh ; aud Private Barron, who made 33 out of 35-poesiblo at 800 yards in tho seoond stage, Queen's — was inferior to what hue been done on former occasions. No doubt the jumble of the airangements, the novelty of the runge, and tha absence of the usual conBpiouona dnnger flags, were tbe ohiof- causes of the falling off. This, the first, meeting at the new Lytton range, has nob been by any means an auspicious one, ur.d it will take a eood deal of pains to overoome the prejudice whioh has been raised against that range by the unfortunate oiroum Btancea whioh have- led to the want of success of this year's mooting. Hia- Excellency the Governor, the Colonial Seorotary, and Oaptain O'Oallaghan, viBited tho range on Saturday afternoon.
