A Men (hi her Eggs. An I ah I this time I'vo got, I think, just fivo, Whitoris the moon upon an August night. v I long to see tho contents well alivo, < For those chioks, still unborn, are my delight. My oldest egg — now let mo pause and-see : , - ' He'll bo a valiant rooster- bird, of cou'reo, Having tbo grace oi tho ailantUB tree, " A linnet's voice, tho bruto strength of ahorso. My second, I must vory fondly dream, Will bo apouZij de Icttres, arid very wise; ' , Bho in linguistics will bo hold supromo, And aha will learn tho idjom .of tho flics, . That third, delicious, epocklod egg of mino; Will bring mo forth tho handsomest of malos, With military genius, I opine— A fowl the foo of gardon slugs and snailq, - Tliht other there— that dotted littlo dear— WiU'cause my poor maternal mind regret ; For sho, will be, I positively fear, Tho wayward Cleopatra of ay set.

And, whilo she hurried after him to say, ;; " Spare, spare my ohildron, arid bo over blest 1" A weasel, who had scon no food that day. Happened to tramp along, and suck tho root. — Cripia Joiim.
