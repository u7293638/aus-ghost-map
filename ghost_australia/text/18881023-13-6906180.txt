PHOTOGRAPHY. Were it possible for some of the early In valuators m photographic research to revisit this earth at the present time, great would be their wonder and delight at finding that the baby they had nursed with so much care and watchfulness had grown into the giant art science of photograph). Sure and marvel loudly rapid has been its progress, for like steam and electricity, it soon found its way, round our globe, and although great must have been the hopes of its originators, we can scarcely imagine that they could have foreseen the future importance of their dis- cover). A discovery is valued according to two things, its artistic or scientific value, and its commercial value, the one giving knowledge and the application of that knowledge ; the other concerns all the daily intercourse and workings of the great human family. An invention, therefore, combining these two is certainly deserving of our warmest gratitude. Such is photography. Artistically scientifically, and commercially it has opened a new epoch in the history of the world's knowledge. To art it has become a necessary auxiliary. Science accepts it as an exponent of her truths, and in commerce and the hundred and one phases of daily life we find it playing a prominent and important part; kind, to use the words of Dr. Vogel, "There is scarcely a single field in the visible phenomena where its productive influence is not felt. It is, as it were, a new language, and may be said to be to form what printing is To thought. To the photographer the camera and its appurtenances are what the brush is to the painter, or the chisel to the sculptor. 'They are all causes of production directed by inspiration of the mind, and guided by cultivation and the absence. In tracing to its abstract the history of any discovery which has not been sudden or for. tin tone, but which has been gained by deep study and the repeated trials, the inquiry naturally divides itself into two parts, viz., the iib a that caused the wish, and the means for i ha perception of the fulfilment of that wish The one is, as it were, the essence, and the other the substance, and both are as important to each other as soul to body, line ino leprerit'iitul by certain substances which have been noticed to thicken under the influence of white light and the camera obscura The question so often asked, who invented photography, and where did it first see light may be answered by the words "legion, and divers justices " Assettionu have from lamely time appeared in print, crediting both the Chinese and Japanese with having possessed a knowledge of photograph). Others have given the ancient Egyptians the place of honour us being the first to employ the units of silver, and traces of nitrate of silver have I seen found in some of the clothes wrapped round their mummies, The Greeks knew well that certain gems lost their brightness li) t'tgiosure to sunlight. Pills) noticed also that ) ed low was because. bleached by long exposure to light, and Vitruvius, tile painter, always placed his paintings in it room with a north light We will, however, leave these uncertain theories Mid no back some 300 years, where we shall find theearhesttruBtworthyrecord concerning the future discovery of the invention of photography. Towards the close of the 15th century, Giovanni Battista della Porta, a Neapolitan monk, seeing the objects from without reflected upon the white walls of his cell through a hole in the shutter, became the means of giving to the world a pleasing, and as it has since proved, a valuable instrument by inventing what has since been called 1 tile camera obscura or dark chamber And Ports recommended the artists of his time to use it in making large pictures It was this invention of the camera obscura that became the idea that caused the wall in the winds of the future discoverers of photo graph). 'I he alchemists in their eager desire to obtain an elm tree 1 new of the existence of that) chemical compounds that are now employed in photograph and Fabricius, disciple of the great Hermes notices in n work, De Uebus Milallnui (1066), the fact that chloride of silver, when exposed to the influence of white light darkens, but little did he imagine that in this fact lay the germ of the future discovery and popularity of photograph) Nor could he could have dreamt for a moment of applying it to the invention of Porta but it seems probable, indeed certain, that the camera and chemical research were not altogether unthought of, for we read in a very singular work by that remarkable author, Tephaigne dear Peoche (17M), entitled Gip handle a Bahylone, the following remarks, proving that he must have been ruminating on these things He supposes himself transferred to the palace of the genii of the elements, the chief of whom thus addressed him -" You know that the rays of light, re- flecting various bodies, paint them on the retina of the eye, on the surface of water, and on mirrors The spirits have sought to fix. these images, they have composed a very subtle adhesive material which hardens very quickly, by means of which a picture is made in the twinkling of an eye They spread this substance on a piece of cloth, and expose it to the object they wish to depict The first effect of this prepared cloth is that of a mirror, near and distant objects being shown upon it, but that which n class cannot effect the cloth does, viz , it retains the image fin til fully It is taken a 10) to a dark place, and an hour after you have a picture far more precious, truthful, and lasting than any that art can produce The spirit then entered into a physical disquisition on the nature of the Tintinara body-on the difficulties of preparing it and on the mutual action of the lighting clutinousbod)-' three problems, side Tephaigne, on waking from his trance, " that I propose to the philosophers of our days " We must now pass on some hundred years, when we come to the first important step in chemical research. In 1777 the learned believe, a native of Sweden, experimented with chloride of silver in several forms, and was the first to call attention to the fact that paper prepared with the salts of oliver, and exposed to the solar spectrum, by passing a beam of light through the prison, became a li- the e tire c in different degrees, that the action was greatest at the blue end of the spectrum, and that it went even beyond the visible spectrum c rcumstance strangely corroborated at the present day by Professor Jamison, at Paris-whilst no change took place in the green, yellow, orange and red portions Priestly and Senebier also experimented with the nitrate and muriate of silver, but these did not seem to create much interest at the time, for it was not until the year 1902 that we find in the journal of the Royal Institution " an account of the method of crop) ing paintings upon glass, and making profiles by the agency of light" by Sir. Thomas Wedgewood, with notes by Mr. li. Dive), afterwards Sir H Davey. Here, again, it was nitrate of silver used, and research into the doings of Wedgewood guarantees the fact that as early as 1799 he was experimenting with a Monsieur Daguerre, who died between 1)8 and 1802 This however, was not the Daguerre destined to become the discoverer of the process bearing his name, but his father, the Wedgewood mentioned being a son of the great Josiah Wedgewood. Wedgewood and Davey became great friends, and for some time continued their researches together, producing many beautiful results, but, alas their discovery was only of partial value, for a new difficulty now presented itself. The beautiful pictures obtained with so much trouble and patience, when exposed to daylight gradually darkened all over. Another lapse of a few years for lows, during which time we hear of various experimenters, such as Seebeck, Gil) Lus Bark, Draper, Ritter, ever In 1814 the future celebrated Niepce was prosecuting a series of experiments in this new light process and some II ) years later he engraved plates by the same means, to do this he prepared metallic plates and coated them with bitumen and then exposed them to the action of white light in the camera obscure He was the first person who employed chemicals in the perpetuation of the shares received in the camera obscura Later on another noted 1 Frenchman the originator of the diorama J ouïs Jnc gums Daguerre became on enthusiast in dunn cal research in connection with the camera, and after some little nitric ference shown towards each other these two ardent investigators were introduced and finally entered into a partnership science however died in 1839 and Daguerre was left to solve alone the problem of the process that was called after him He exposed a highly polished silvered plate to the action of the line and after exposure to light brought out the latent image by de veil pment with oil of petroleum He toiled along, looking for some more active means of development when an accident greatly assisted him Having prepared some plates as usual and exposed them to light he placed them away in a cupboard for a short time being called away and intend us- to develop them on his return but what was his surprise and joy on returning, to his cupboard to find his plates fully developed and having a more perfect image on them than he had yet obtained He in occured at once that the impression must be due to some chemical or other left in the cupboard He therefore took the chemicals away by degrees still preparing and exi owing plates and placed them in what he now called his magic cupboard One and all of them became developed At him all the bennetts were removed in a fever 01 anxious excitement he again prepared and expiRed some plates, putting them in their usual place Going Home time never to look at them, and expect ing to see them in their latent state, he found Them also developed Mystery of mi sterns, but soon to be cleared up, for on a close exam dilation of la Itoite ma little, he found a small dish containing mercury that had escaped the notice Thus it was that mercurial vapour became the recognised medium for development by this process The news of this discovery soon spread, and Humboldt, lliot, Arago, and others became the confidants of Daguerre Alter much persuasion and delay he consented to move his discovery to his country, in consideration of a ) early pension of (LOOK francs, Nicpce'a son receiving also 11 pension of £1,000 francs, and on the Bills of August, ISIi'l at the memorable satiric pasture of the French Academy of Science, in the Palais Martini, Daguerre illustrated his process by development As might be expected, the mine was attended by all the fine of art, Science, and even diplomacy in Paris Anigo in his opening speech mi) s, "1 France has adopted the discovery, and is proud to present it to the whole world " '1 he-l/oiiiíen» Unaersnl thus speaks of it "After years of patient research, of disappointment, and hope almost crushed, Monsieur Daguerre has succeeded in fixing the light on a solid substance, In giving a body to the impalpable and fugitive image of objects reflected in the eye, in a mirror, in the apparatus of the camera obscura " j In these days of perfect lighting and rapid exposures, it may not be out of place to deal Bcrihe the modus operandi employed at that time in order to procure a portrait. Some few years preceding it required six or seven hours to get an image in the camera obscura, but by Dngucrre'a process that time had become reduced to as many minutes.

it has proved itself to be one of the greatest boons we have received, and allowed the invention of photography to be advanced to a degree of perfection hitherto unthought of Perfect negatives being now easily procured, it became necessary to use another and more perfect piper to receive the positive image A smooth and finely (grained piper was chosen and prepared by laying on its surface a

which it was worked out by Mr G Osborne, of Melbourne, during the time he was in the capacity of Government photographer in this city Both he and Colonel Sir Henry James worked out an improvement on
