WESLEYAN EDUCATION. A Public Meeting was held on Monday evening, in the Wesleyan Chapel, York- street, for the purpose of agreeing to a petition to the Legislative Council, on the subject of education, j Prayer was offered up by the Rev. J. IM'Kcimy, who afterwards announced that Mr. Alderman Allen would preside. The Ciif iiiMAX expressed his gratification at finding the subject of education occupying so much of the public attention, and hoped that the meeting would attentively consider the subjects to be brought before them by the several speakers. The Rev. D. J. Drai'br moved the first resolution, which was as follows: "That this meeting is of opinion that a large proportion of the children of the colony are growing up in sin and wickedness from want of general education, in connexion with moral and religious training, and that it is the duty of the Wesleyan Church to do all that is in its power to remedy the evil." The first sentiment expressed in the resolution is, I believe, admitted by all persons who have thought seriously on the subject. We are painfully alive to the fact that, a large proportion of the children of the colony are growing up in sin and wickedness from want of general education is and we are fully sensible that our representatives in the Legislative Council are only doing their duty when they do all in their power to remove the evil which we deplore, and diffuse through the country the blessings of education. We are not of the number who wish to hide from the eyes of men the lamp of knowledge, and I trust, Sir, we shall over be ready to co-operate with our fellow colonists, in or out of the Council, in endeavouring to promote the instruction of the rising generation and permit me, Sir, to say that whilst we feel it our duty to assemble here this evening, in order that the Wesleyan voice may be heard, we wish to lose sight as lmit'h as possible of whatever is merely sectarian in its character. It was said by the Rev. Dr. Ross, on Saturday last, the Wesleyans were coming I forward, not to strengthen the weak or assist those who were already strongly opposed, but to add strength to that opposition. In reference to this, we can only say that we do not oppose any man as a man ; but I trust we shall never be backward in avowing our sentiments on such matters as affect the general welfare of the community; and if we happen to differ from some on the educational question, we are quite as willing to give them the highest credit or sincerity, as we are desirous of being thought sincere. We believe, Sir, that education, unless it be accompanied with moral and religious training, is not of itself sufficient to afford a guarantee that we shall have a virtuous or religious population, and much as we wish that all should be instructed, we desire still more that all should have such an education as will best comport with their nature and destiny. It is said that in Australia 13,000 children are at present growing up without education of any sort. This, I think, is appalling enough ; but I fear that no system of education would be found imparting the benefits of instruction to the children of shepherds and stockmen who are scattered up and down in the bush; indeed, whilst our population continues to be as widely scattered as it is at present, there will be always a great proportion of the children without education. The evil of such a state of things is most deplorable, and calls loudly for the adoption of such measures as are best calculated to remove it. The resolution speaks of its being the duty of the Wesleyan Church to do all in its power to remedy the evil. The measures which have been adopted by our Church in England, in reference to education, will, I am sure, bear comparison with those of the more numerous Episcopalians and we are quite prepared to do all in our power to meet the case of the uneducated children of Australia. And, Sir, I must be allowed to say, that up to the present time, our schools will bear comparison with others, as it regards the efficiency of the teachers, and the progress of the children. There is one fact, however, which I am sure will be received with satisfaction by the public that whereas the average expense of each child taught in the colonial schools is said to be 20s., the average cost of each child in the Wesleyan schools has been but 11s. Id. The sum granted by the Legislative Council last session being Â£350, and the number of children taught for that amount in the colony, exclusive of Port Phillip, being 614. The statistics of our schools show that we have not neglected the important subject of education. There are in connexion with our Church, 27 Sabbath Schools, 1769 Scholars, 23 Day Schools, containing 890 scholars. It will be seen from this, that considering our numbers we have done well in establishing schools, and moreover, that' those schools, whilst they are as efficient as most others, have been maintained at a less cost to the State than is said to be the average expenditure. So far as I am concerned, I should prefer a system in which the rights of denominations are respected at the same time fully admitting the right of the State to see that the secular education is efficient, and that the money granted is properly expended. I believe that the State is bound to educate the children, or at least to assist in doing so, and that assistance should be rendered in such a manner as not to impede but rather to facilitate the endeavours of the different denominations of Christians to train up the young in knowledge and understanding ; with these views I trust that we, as a section of the Christian Church, shall ' let our voice be heard in favour of such schools as are, in our opinion, the best calculated to impart that measure of knowledge which shall prepare the youth of the colony for becoming good citizens and good Christians. Mr. D. then entered into an exposition of the necessity and benefits arising from a combination of religious and secular instruction, and repudiating the doctrine that " Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion," contended, with Hooper, that " Education was the faculty by which human reason was developed, and by which man was enabled to distinguish truth from error, and evil from good." Mr. J. Byrnes seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. The Rev. R. Mansfield moved the second Resolution, viz. "That this meeting does not approve of the plan of public education called the Irish System, as it does not admit the whole of the Sacred Scriptures, but only extracts, and because it excludes prayer." The Bible was the terminus of his bigotry, and the starting point of his liberality. Up to this point he, as a Protestant and a Wesleyan, could make neither compromise nor concession ; beyond it, he was willing to make as many sacrifices, for the sake of peace and co-opera- , lion, as any reasonable man could require. It was here that the Irish System of education demanded from him what he could no more . surrender than he could surrender his belief in the being of a God, the immorality of the | soul, and the day of universal retribution. He . could attach no value to education that treated I human beings as mere inhabitants of the present fleeting world, and which made no pro- i vision for their happiness beyond the grave. Education of this kind could do no real and lasting good, either to children or to society. I It could not make the children good citizens- i it could not make them moral men for irrespective of the authority of God's word, and the awful sanctions of eternity, morality was but as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. The only education which could satisfy him was such as should teach the working of righteousness in connexion with the fear of God, and instil into the minds of the using generation the great truth that time is but the nursery for eternity. Now, without the Bible,, such education as this was impracticable. The Irish System, in the most favourable aspect in which its friends had presented it to the Australian public, gave no assurance that the Bible should be used in its schools :_ it therefore gave no assurance that its education should fulfil the only purposes for which education was at all desirable. For this reason, he could not give it his support. But, on the other hand, he was liberal enough to make large concessions, provided the Holy Scriptures be retained in their fulness and purity. In matters of religious faith, he, like the venerable founder of Wesleyan Methodism, was a man of one book-the book of which God was the author, truth the matter, and salvation the end. None could more highly prize than he (Mr. M.) did, the writings of Mr. Wesley, the commentaries of Dr. Adam Clarke and the Rev. Joseph Benson, and the other standard publications of their communion ; but he should consider himself guilty of monstrous folly and impiety if, for one moment, he were to place them on a par with the Bible, or recognise them as being, in any one sense of the word, of co-ordinate authority with the Book of God. In a system of public education, he could, there fore, give up these most estimable expositions I of Christian theology and leave the Bible to II tell to the children its own heavenly story we should have no fear of their being either by residing or imperfectly instructed in the doctrines. of redemption, is left to the unsophisticated teaching of the pages written by inspirations the Holy Ghost Clinging to this supreme. and sole authority in things religious, he could fearlessly surrender, in State education or mons, commentaries, catechisms, and erect Huis fur could he go, but no further 10 earthly consideration could induce him, and he was sure no earthly consideration could even duce the Wesley an Church, to countcntuiccedu cation not strictly and intimately blended in, the truth of God, as derived from the sacred volume in its unmutilated form the jm? System failed to do this-signally failed JJ therefore did the Wesleyan body oppose it was a face of That Mr A MAcviiTHURinn very neat and excellent speech seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously The Rev J M'Ivlx m said, the resolution which I have to introduce is in supported nominations schools, which I approve of on principle The subject has received my careful attention, to which it has been particularly directed for eight years past in this colony { was here when Sir Richard Bourke's measure was introduced and successfully resisted, and I consider it an honour to have been once that committee which stood so firmly by the great principles of the Reformation I consider that no general system will so well meet the wants of the rising generation is dcnoiiiiMuorui schools and the reason when greater number of children are not instructed in them is the want of that liberal support which they ought to receive the designation of this class of schools has not been fairly represented has been so spoken of as if it were necessary to form such a school that all the children taught in it should belong to parents members of tr> communion by which it was established Now with the exception of Roman Catholic school! this is seldom if ever the case Are not the Emscoi alian, Presbyterian, and St esler schools open to the children of all communions who choose to send them, and agree to conform to their rules A denominational school, then, takes its name from the body by which it is established and supported without reference to the profession of the parents of the children who attend it The Wesleyans are said to wish to obtain the attendance of children who are not of Wesleyan parents We deem it, we have never made such a trial, but when children are brought by their parents for admission into our schools they are received without reference to the profession of their parents or guardians, and know that all denominational schools in the colony are conducted on the very same principle It has been said that the W cÂ«lcju system is a prosaic thing system has charge we repudiate , our object is not to steal sheep from other flocks and persuade them to take our name, by any of increasing our number In this sense we wish to make no proselytes and such are our news, that we would not give one straw to bring the world to be called by our name, if that was all they were to obtain for we know, that with the time the world would still he in Ute an ins of the incW one No, our object is to save the souls of men, and so as that is done it matters not by what name they are called "We wish to have our own schools because we cannot consent to cast religion overboard Our men of education is, that moral and religious training forms a most important part of it and that no matter how extensive and perfect the secular part may be, without the formation of religious principles it will not produce good men 01 prepare them for the faithful discharge of the duties of life I do not consider that the erection of large public schools in the centre of 1 rural districts would meet this case Who could I reasonably expect that children would be able to walk from five to ten miles a day to attend school * Die schools might be built, but they would, I fear, be found in general empty One rev gentleman said on Saturday night, that he supported the Irish System in order to avert cm ss from the colony It would appear a strange way of doing it At evil we shall abide by the Book of God and linen Protestant pim ciples, and see what we can do to avert the) curse referred to Another reverend divine u reported to have bound himself not to vote for a sixpence of money for schools if the Irish System is not received What is to be done iC Are we to consider ourselves ruined This puts me in mind of an anecdote I oncchentdl of a gentleman who had been long in India and high in office, and on visiting London' after along absence, he called at a celebrated bootmaker s, in the we east end of the metropolis! and left an order for work after a few weeks recalled again, and inquired with an mr of great importance if his boots were read, and on being informed that they were not, he expressed himself as highly displeased, and in formed the master bootmaker that he would deal no longer with him He bootmaker made no reply, but ins and called his foreman, and said, " Shut up our establishment, for weare ruined, this {,cntleinaii will not deal with us any longer' However, we shall not shut up Ã­ yet, but goonourwaj doing all the good he can, in promoting the religious education of the children in our own denominational schools. The reverend gentleman then moved the third resolution, "That this meeting considers that de moments nal schools are best suited to meet the wants of the rising generation in this co- lony The Rev. E biVEtTinx seconded the useful tion, which was carried unanimously The Rev J Ivxks moved the fourth resolution, " That a petition be respectfully addresed to the Legislative Council, expressive of the news of the Wesleyan body on the subject of education, and requesting adequate provision to be made for the support of the Wesleyan schools, and that the petition now read be adopted," the petition being as follows - 1 STATION To the Honorable the Legislative Council of Vic South Wales, in Council assembled The humble Petition of the Wesleyan Minis- ters, and the Members of their Societies and Congregations in the County of Cumberland, in the Colony of New South Wales, sheweth that your petitioners having learned that the Select Committee appointed by four Honor able House, to inquire into and report on the subject of education, has recommended, as general scheme system of Instruct ' nonsuited to this colony, the plan of education known as the "Irish National System, they feel it their duty to inform your Honorable House that the system thus described has not their approbation, and cannot receive their support That your petitioners cannot conscientiously approve offer adopt any system of education that does not admit the use of the entire v volume of Divine Rev elation, Pray cr to Almighty God Catechetical Instruction, and Ministerial Super intendence that as the present system of "W Wesleyan Denominational Schools secures all these important particulars, your petitioners consider that it best suited the wants of their connexion and therefore beg that it may not be disturbed that in voting the supplies for the education the children of the colony, your petitioners request that adequate provision may be made by your Honorable House for the efficient maintenance of the schools belonging to the Wesleyan Church And your petitioners as in duty bound, will everyday. I feel gratified, said the Rev Mr I, that a public meeting has taken place, in connexion with the Wesleyan body, on the important subject of education in this colony, in order that the public may have something like a proof of the interest we feel in the measure as a public question the conduct of the Wesleyans in this colony would not be true to the character of the Conference and connexion at home, " they were to be neutral or careless spectator in the present movement At a very recent period the Wesleyan body in the mother country were called upon to show their zeal for this cause, and by their conduct on that occasion, they gave practical proof that the education of the using generation lay near their hearts It's true that the real was manifested in the form of opposition to the education clauses in Sir J Graham's Tuetoij Bill but that opposition arose from a conviction in their minds that the education of the young is a question of the greatest magnitude, and that no parliaments) enactment should be allowed to pass into law that would nominate itsbcncfits, and make the instrument of propagating intolerance and error that the opposition did not arise from party zeal, but from a conscientious and deep interest in the subject itself, was the view of Sir James Graham, who, when commenting on the ob lections of the Wesley an Committee of privileges, made the following statement " I must say, that I think that the objections taken by that body, are in general worthy of attentive consideration and when I reflect on the importance of that body -on their conduct generally as respects the subject of education, on the exertions they have of made to supply the deficiencies of districts where educational instruction was but little known I am bound to say, that I think their objections are worth of our greatest consideration and respect Whatcverthercfoie may be the failings of the Wesley ans, I am thankful to be able to say that they possess a deep and practical interest in the question that has called us together this evening. It is certainly gratifying to the patriot and the Christian, that the Legislature not only of our mother, but also of our adopted country, declare both by word and deed, that it is the duty of every Christian government to provide for the education of the people such a declaration in connexion with the strong excitement now prevailing in the public mind on this question, shows that it is a subject that touches the vitals of the community, and is regarded as essential to our existence and well being as a nation And should this interest ever be diminished, we shall in the same proportion be lowered in the scale of nations the subject of dispute therefore, is, not whether the using generation shall be educated, (for this is a point admitted by) all), nor is it whether education should be based upon religious principle , but it is whether the formation of a plan of combined education is practicable The difficulty of adopting a general system rises from the question in a religious point of view so that were it possible for us conscientiously to dispense with religious instruction in our schools, a general scheme would at once meet the wishes of all But the religious instruction of the children is a point upon which we cannot make the slightest surrendered concession, without a violation of the trust confided to us by the Divine Being whose injunction to all upon whom rests the responsibility of controlling the interests of the people whether the State the Church of the parents of families, is Iran up a child in the vine he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it A hates cr, therefore, may I be the difficulties which the religious branch of ' education may place in the way of a general scheme, we must maintain inviolate the union between secular and religious education BE got) on this point is better than latitudes anism To deny, mutilate, or encumber the principle, that the fundamental truths of Christianity form the only basis of a wholesome education, besides being a v violation of our duty to God, would be treacherous to the interests of the government of our country the Bible, which teaches the will of God to man, incul- cases submission to the higher powers, as ordained of God, and the effect of such teaching in the minds of the rising generation, is the only thing that can shield the throne from treason and sedition Such teaching will not make the children the vassals of despotic power, but will enable them to distinguish between right and wrong, will keep down the spirit of mildest), blaspTiemv, revolution, and anarchy) - evils, under the influence of which, men despise governments, and are not afraid to speak evil of dignities Bring the minds of the children under the teaching of the word of God, and on place all their passions of envy v, malice, and revenge, under an effectual restraint and their conduct will be regulated according to the principles of righteousness and peace you make them pence milkers and not peace breakers Whatever may) be the steps taken by the Legislature on this question, it is the duty of the Christian Church to guard this point, and to accept of no measure from the state that does not include instruction from the Bible as the word of God We should have but little difficulty in adopting the Fine merino doctrine, that the Church is the supreme instructress of the people, if w chad the liberty of interpreting the term Church as meaning, not the Church of England, of Rome, or any other Church exclusive Debut the um versal body of Christ's people by whatever name they are called But though such an interpretation cannot be realised so as to effect a satisfactory) union of all religious denominations on a general scheme of education- I religious instruction is not to be abandoned We do not believe that an) Church acts up to its obligations, that is either negligent or half beset! with reference to the proper training of the children of its own members. the infant, so soon as he is baptised, I becomes, in a certain sense, the child, the pro a part) of that Church into which he is received, and acquires a right to have the first dawnings of reason vi arched over and improved, and the seed of saving truths planted at the earliest period within his mind, so that the religious instruction of the young a solemn trust which the Christian Church, can never, consistent with her obligations to God allow to be transferred to the exclusive control of the State though it is the duty of the State to assist in carrying out this object the system that is recommended for this colony appears very plausible in theory) Theoretically) it promises the soften- ing down, if not the removal, of sectarian pre- judices more efficient instruction-and greater economy in the expenditure of money But I am of opinion that such promises would fail to be accomplished in its practical results It would bring sectarian prejudices into more active operation, inasmuch as by its own regulations it does not provide for the concealment, but rather for the greater prom nency of the division of sects and parties, not casuals) but regularly), and at a time of life when it is most calculated to prove injurious to the minds of the children Most gladly would we have a system that would break down the middle wall of portion between sects and parties in the rising generation, and that would promote cordiality of sentiment and unanimity of feeling than what exists at the present day, but the intolerance, exclusiveness, and bigotry of the present day), extinguish all our hopes of such an event As to the saving of expense, this is a recommendation of the system that wants ' proof and even admitting that it might be, proved, it is a mere paltry consideration, and should not be permitted to weigh for one moment against any other plan that has proved itself, army prove itself, to be more satisfactory and efficient V general system is surrounded by almost insurmountable difficulties in the present state of things and supposing that Lord stonie) s is the best that can be proposed, yet, setting aside the circumstance that facts can be adduced in proof of its failure in Re- lindas n National scheme, it still leaves these difficulties untouched. If in the books of bent wire lessons, that are prepared for the schools, there were not such a paring down the word of God, as indicate greater respect for the doe tunes and commandments of men, than de during the Jehol counsel of God-then one great difficulty would be considerably removed But since we must conscientiously adhere to our duty of introducing the Bible into our schools, there is no preparation or alteration of the word of God for this purpose that could throw it into any form, that would satisfy all parties, Without changing the essential truths of the sacred volume which case the exclusion of the Bible altogether would be preferable to its admission But even supposing that there could be a form in which the Bible could be introduced to the satisfaction of all parties, when we consider the rival jealousies of the different Churches, and the peculiar) exclusive and intolerant claims of certain denominations, is it possible for us to imagine that these jealousies on the side of the preponderating part) would not affect the man agement of the system We should find their influence in the Governor s Board, in the local price is, and in the schoolmasters, by which considerable partiality would be over cised in favour of the majority on the subject of religious scruples But say you, if such a case happens, why not complain in the proper quarter Under the influence of such jealousies, comply nuts would be easier made than redress obtained ; so to it in all probability, before the System were long in operation, the minority on conscientious scruples would have tolerated in the hands of the majority and as in Roland at the present day, the nation would become a denomination in system The Rev B Hurst seconded the resolution. in a most animated speech, expressly of of the strongest views in opposition to the general scheme, founded on his conviction of its being by no means suited to allay those feelings in too many instances now found to exist, but I rather to increase jealousies and surmises among persons of different denominations. Alderman Allen having vacated the chair, which was taken by the Rev. John McKenny, The Rev. Mr Draper moved that the sincere and respectful thanks of the meeting be given to Alderman Allen for the manner in which he had presided over the proceedings of the evening. The motion was carried amidst loud applause, and Alderman Allen, in returning thanks, expressed his gratification at seeing so numerous and respectable a meeting assembled together in the sacred cause of education Upwards of the hundred persons in the present, and the meeting, which was most quiet and harmonious, broke up about ten o'clock.
