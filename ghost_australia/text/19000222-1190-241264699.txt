THE GHOST. This Is not merely a yarn "while the the billy bolls," but a fact which occurred to me when In the bush. I wnaTeturnlng home on n bright moonlight night, after a hnrd day's grubbblng, thinking ot Eng land and friends far away, when I thought a smoke would 'be refreshing, but ufter lllllng my pipe found I had no matches. Just as I was putting my pipe away, with u ?lgh, f looked up, and on the opposite side saw u man leaning on a fence. Ids head bent. He was dressed as a bushman, and I noticed a red handkerchief knotted round Ids neck. Of course, 1 could get a match off him. I nvent forward and ask ed for a light, and, to my astonishment, recognised him as an old resident of tho township where 1 was making for. As he made no reply, I took my box out to show him. nnd on looking up found he had dis appeared. 1 searched for some time, with out success, finding only a knife. On reaching home I at once communicated with hi friends, who stated that he had gone to look for u knife he had lost. Strange to relate, ho was never found, and a man with whom he had liad some tils-' agreement disappeared nt the same time. The strangest part of my story is "at the full of each moon he is to be seen stand ing, head down, nt the very spot I saw him the night he disappeared." F. GRANT. Barnard street, Benrtigo.
