THE LITTLE GREY NURSE. By MAnr Lmton. CHAPTER I. THE ORT 0nas . It was a strngo chain of cironmstancee that led me to renouneno my bnhlorhood, nand enter into the holy otanto of matrimony. I, John ?lanrtyn, M.D., IM.R CP., after thirty-four years of wenet, unrestrained liberty, in loos than thirty- four hours, suc cumbed completely to the fascinations of a certain fair little woman of whom you will hear anon. "Come dorwn for a week Jack," GIregory Ormond had said that eventful Decembler. "l know you enjoy a bit of shooting and hunting and l can give you both." I w(ra oxtremely fPnd of both sports, but they were not suflicihnt to tempt me to spend the woeIk with 0rmond at his fine old place in II-shire. Tllere wT something aboult Ortnonl that closhod with my finer feelings. He woo very well at a cinloh cqlaintance, but I eould never dr?om of elaoeing him with my friends. Perhaps the ugly rumour nfloat ,to to his provnte life had something to do with this prejlldice. A man who is reported to have wooed and wedded a young inoxnerienced girl for her money and then neglects and ill trents her, in not the man I could call friend and love ao a brother. "No thanls, Ormond," I replied, civilly enough. "I really do not think I could leavne my prtico. I am particularly busy just now." "Nonense, oldr man, why do you keep two ossistants if you cannot trust youlr practice in their hands for a week? Look heroe. if the ohooting and hunting are no' a sufllient draw, let me tell you tht Pro. fessor Wagetnffe is to be one of my guests Come, now, don't you want to meet him n" I prioked up my ears and flshoed my eyes into his face with sudden but intonoe interest. He was smiling and watching me with a cunning little sneer in his eye'. " VWellP" he inquoired. "I'l1 como," 1 answered cooly. "Pro fesoor Wagostaffo is the one man above all men at prerent that I long to meet; I have been introduced to him, bit have never had the pleasure of conversing with him " "Tou wnill have any nmount of oppor tunities down at my place," said Ormond, carefully flicking the ash from his cigar "1 think you will like him, he is a goud sort of a fellow." So, through the medium of one of the most eelebrated scientists of that day, I went down to Gregory Ormond's ancestral home, was the moans of discovering one of the motn cruel and unnatural crimes ever premeditated, and also met and won my w'ife. It was In the evening of the fourteenth of Docember that I arrived at Ormondl If all. It wnas a cold raw night outside, and when I entered the fragrant warmth of the dimly-llphted entrance haill I was fain to staoy my footatpae beside the blazing fire before proceeding ferther. " Tell your master that I have arrived and would like to see him if he is at liberty," I said, addressing a grave elderly manservant who stood respectfully by my eide. The miu bowed and glidel acny and I wIs left the ole oecotpont of the ntsonili centold hall. I wnrmed msyslftnd lokecd ab ut me curioucly. " Surely Ormond in a lucky dog," I thought, as I surveyed th.' carved oaked walls nnd grand staircase and the splcndidly painted ceiling with it critical and covet?tt egye. _4F. brotshtmy ?,e ovn from the goryoouo ceiling with a start. Sonieowe Sslowly and hocitatingly descending. the wide stairaecse. otn my host, as I firt thought it miglt be, but r. dainty little grey-clad flgure with ae snowy cap retisg upon her golded head, and suowy linen at her throat andl wrists. I gazed blankly into the little pac. face and earroufoldhrk eyes, and stool spelbound before the ire, as the ti.y Plippered feet, peeping beneath the whit, apron. slowly nod hcsitotingly touehvd .cnh atstir. She reached the last step, ai.d then, as I moved forward impulsively, she turned again, and, like an arroe from a bow, sped swiftly up the wide staircase and wad lost from my sight. Ig zed rucfully up the gloomystaircace. " Vlhat a lovely littll nuree;" I smurmuresd, nod then t wo: ot,.red who Ormond had it in the heuno. Not his wife certainly, fcc she, poor girl, so rumollr sid, was recruit. iog her shattered health and nerves in the .oceth of France. Perhaps one of thc serieo .ta, but Ormond would ecanrel) .engage an hospital ncrse to attend upon a dome?tic. ~ ill muooing thoughtfully, Jick Ormond h;msel appeared, and I determined to nab him. 1 was unao1le to carry out my resolve, however, for smy host gree'ed me loudl n?d warmly, and gave me but little chance to put in a wcord. i-s hIlndaoms face wea flushed, and hi. aeTnner was buoyant and gay in the e.ntcme, contrasting ctrangely, so it seem.t to me, witlhthe haggard wildnessc of his eye " and the ,orried, anxiou exprlession of hibS wholo countenance. "' Glad yus hiats. come, ,ack !" he cried ettcsively " let mtle hbow yeo cour roeom Professor Wcagst.aftf is o'tlg t bnow yoe C lA P1T 'lR IT. Giregry Ornmond had ollhctehd hisa hrus party with better taste and discriuination than I gave hitm credit for, but, un doubtedly, Ideatrie? Stanley, Ormond'} married elster, had a great deal to do with the selection.

I felt myself colour up, and to hide my embarrassment, I said quicktly : " Do youen believe in ghosts, Professor!

I think everylbody round the table changed colour. I know [ did, and Gregory Ormnond went liid. It wnas not the words exactly that affected us, but the solemn blood-curdling manner in which the Pro fessor uttered them. "I oal'vys thought W1agetta ffewacranky, I am con vinced c f it now," muttered a voice at my elbow, and I turned indignantly to my I. ft-hand neighbonr, a little pale, in signiflcnt man with an habitual dlsagree ahle cozpression upon his face, and a dis gustingle croes-grained manner with him. h knew him slightly. He was Bloatrce Stanley's husband. "Cranky chop," ha repeated, nodding his head toward the Professor. I shrugged my shoulders, and turned my head from him and my attention to the conversation that was going on. " But. I'rofe sor," Ormond wan saoing, iu an exzited. inj,,red way. "csnely you |ulievo in our family ghost when I tell you that I have seen her myself ! " " ly dlear boy," answered the Professor, ood- humeouredly, " I do not dispute your word but I must see your ghost myself before I believe."| ' hen you will oe convinced soon, tor you will b.~ auto to see her before many days, or p,.rhaps hours, have passed," de clared Ormond, triumphantly. " Pr. fessor," I said diffidently, "pardon me, lut you raid just now that you be lioevedif we wiehod ?e could bringback the pirit of anyone we loved. Can you prove this to ut P" " Bosh l" cams in a hoarse whipper from' my little left- hand neighbour. 1 turned still farther from him, and met the kindly glance of the Professor. " Cerlainly, with pleasure, my dear sir. I will relate a personal experience if the ladies care to hear it." There was a general polite murmur of assent, though I knew more than one fnir dame was shaking in her slippera with superstitious horror. " It was when I was a young man at college," began the Pro feesor. his eyes upon the sherry glass he was twisting in his fingers. I had returned about a week to Oxford after the Long Vacation when I received the news that my mother had died quite suddenly. my name the last upon her lips. Now, just before 1l-aving home, I had displeased my mother in some way, and she had lectured moe somowhat severely for her. So incensed and mortified was I at this that I would not speak to her for two days, 'and even at the moment of parting I refused to kiss her. l"'iko m'o, my own dear hboy,' he had pleaded ;hut was hard as fint, and putt tng her loving arms from my neck, I turned amay and left her and never saw ser again." The P'-ofessor paused f'r one second, his fee wonderfully tender, sad, and regretful. " TVb u can imagine my grief and horror vhen I heard the tidings. 'To my dying lay I shill never forget those first bitter macurs. I threw myself down in my room ind pnried that she might come oack again to me for the kiss I had refused to give her. Day after lay, night after ntoht, this was my one raycer 'lod, let her com' back for one noment ihat L may kiss her.' ' At last one night my passionaste prayer .nas gran,-d." The Prflcssor paused agaln,land a shudder passel rocod the table. " It mwa a beautiful summer night, light as day, wi.h the moonlight streaming over he room. I lay In my bhd, my psasmonate .,leading rayer upon my lips, when in the .tream of mnoonlight, me mother came toamr me with outstretched hands, and a glad fond smile upon her face.

I went struight to my fire, poked it navagely, and then sat down for half-an hour'a smoke and think, before turning in. When I threw away the end of my anst cigurette nnl rose to my fnet to preplre for bed, I sail to mnayself with an audible chuckle : "Ormond should have obtained a more nppropriato uniform when he obtained his littlo ghost nurse. I wonder if the hospital nurses of a hundred yearn ago (if there were any) wore the enmo uniform, neat little caps and aprons included, as they do in this eminently practical ago of ours Ah, Ormond, you are not half sharp onough for an old practitioner like my self." Still chuckling and fooling mightily pleased at my dicovery, I went to bed and dreamed all night of pretty grey hospital aurnea, noetle-faced Professors, and weird ghot atstorisca. The following day a shooting party wma organised, and I was one of the number, WVo had a cpitnl day's sport, and it was naot until the dusk was beginning to fall that weo wended our weary steps homeward. Elther by chance or design, and I am tempted to think the latter., Batrico Stanley's husband attbtohed himself to me, lighted his pipe at mine, and trudged on rcandily by my side. I made one ort two gneral remanrks about the dty's sport, then tapasd into silence, too tired, to exert my ielf to talk to such a moody companion. Presontly with extraordinary abruptness and irrevolanco he said: ' i wonrer what the old lunnatic hag been StI to-day f" I surnet :and surveyed him In amnazeenllt. " Who ?" I asked coldly. "Your Profeesor. I should liko to know what outrage to society and the human race at inrgo he is planning now. He has some thiog io his wicked old head, I know. Somo dynamite outrage or big poisoning case, or something." If you cannot speak truthfully and re spectfully of one ot the greartsn men of the age, you had better not speak of him at ll,' I seld sternly. "Now, look here, Martyn." ctlod th littlec man onergetlcally, laying his hand on my arm," yeu believe Io this old fraud and 1 o not, ihat is the difference. He is a crazy, unscrupulous old vilain. I know more of him than you do, my boy ; I belilon he would sell his soul, the old tool, in th 'inteorest of oclonce,' as he calls it." " 1 tlink you shuuld explain yoursolf moro fully, Btaoloey," I said stiffly ; "come, what h:ve you against tho l'roloeorf1" '" i a ash could roll you, ,iart)n, but I dare not; I know only a little of his dark deeds and evil ways, Uleatric knows more and Ormond more still. I am only warning you, lad, don't cultivate a wolf in sheep's clothing for a froeud; he may turn round anl bite you when )o least expctc it." I made no reply, I was doeply annoyed and uneasy. O? course I did not believe what he had just said, but still the words had been spoken and were destined to rankleo In my heart; the seeds of uoubt had been a?,wn and already the glamour that had en cnreled the lrufdssor in my eyes was bogln aing to fade. On reaching the Hall, I safely deposited my gun and trappings, and leaving the rest auoking in tho ittle smoke-room, mounted r0e lsttra to my room. I entered wearily and was making my way towards the firu place woea my eyes lighted upon a twistol or of white note.paper lylg on my dressing ,able. I took it up and looked at It curiousy. It was adriesred to " Dr. Johu Marlyn " in a pretty, clear, feminine handwritlug. I 0ule04 Iu over and over, a presntliment ot the truth gradaslly dawning upon me. I uotwisto l and then rear its contents with mingled feeliugs : " You area doctor and a gentleman, and I think you will not renul meyour advice and help.

Mly thoughts wore too busy with the little grey nursue and nor note, lying sosangly in my breast pocket, to talk even to the handaoomo, witty woman whom i hau taken in to dinaner.

" \VlWhat do you think of her now, Jack1" ahkeot Ormond, caitleosly.

"" Yes, I .id ldtdao did the Prolessor," I replied calmly, and the number of pretty eyes were at once removed from my face to that of the Profeusor.

" It was In the interests of science, you forget," she .aid mockingly, and then with a Jittle choking cob she was moving away to wards tho bed, whoen I stopped her gently. " One moment," I said. " I will run up to London early to- morrow, and will call at Scotland Yard. We will avengego this poor girl oven if we cannot save hot life." I looked tagurly for the thanks I ex-. pected in the young nurse's eyes, and I found them. " Thank you, thank you," she murmured. "I wounl like to see you to-morrow even Ing," I said. " Can you lenve a note on my dressing-table to say when and where I can meet you I" She nodded and then hurried away, and I went slowly back to my room to ron my dinner clothes. I found it bard work to hide my feelings, and to be as friendly as usual with my host and the Professor. I flatter myself, however, that I acted my part to perfection without creating the least suspicion in the minds of either of the men. I discussed a knotty question with the latter with unusual brilliancy and enthusiasm, though I longed paseionately to stand up and proclaim him before the whole table to be a fraud and a scoundrel. I joked and laughed with Ormond, and an we rose from our wine to join the ladies, I declared my intention of running up to London in the morning. " Very well,. my boy-come and go just as you please," answered Ormond, gally. '" Bttryand return in time for dinner. Beatrice has invited some of the county magnates." I promiased to do so if possible, and smiled grimly to myself as I thought that perhaps I should no: return alone. li wa up early and awaey by the first train to London, and I returned just as the wintry twilight was drawing in, but not alone.

I spent very little time before my looking- glass that 1 evening, and even debarred myself the p!easure of wrangling over my white tie r was anxious to reach the drawing-room ras early mas I could. As I opened my door and stepped forth hurriedly, I stumbled over a little grey cla flgeure waiting patiently outside. ' beg your pardon-why, nurse I" She took hold of'my arm, and drew me tforcibly away down the oorridor. "Quick I" she cried. " Mrs Ormbnd is dead or dying. Come to her." We traversed the deserted corridors and Idark pussages until we reached the west Swing, and then I stood by the bedside and looked down pityingly, regretfully into the peaceful dead faco of Gregory Ormond's murdered wife. *"The villainsl The villainsl" I muttered passionately, and the little nurse gazed into my face with mute questioning eyes. " Yes, she is dead,' I replied. and for the first time to my knowledge the brave little woman broke down completely, and, flinging herself beside the bed, wept bitterly. I gazed moodily at them both, the dead woman with her wasted face beautiful by death, and her living, breath lug silsar mouonmg for her loss. Presently Naurse Kate arose and dried her eyes reso lutely. Now I am ready," she said1 " what am Â£ to do Y' "Are your nerves steady P" I asked. " Porfotly--oe," holding out two steady little hands, which I promptly seized in mine, and helt fact and leose. " Well, I want you to oun down to the west lodge, and tell two men yeto will find waiting there to come up to the Hallatonce. It will not take you ten minutes, and when you return get one of the women servants to help you with your poor patient. Can you do this I" " Yes," she replied, " but, doctor, what are you going to do with her-murderrs P' " Deliver them over to justice," I said, sternly. " Now, dear, wra? up and run %uay as quickly as you can.' I btll htld her hands, rouctant to let them out of my grasp, then I oent and kissed the solt white fingers tendelly. " Doar, brave little Nurse Kitty " I crield. lWhen I entered the dralwng-room some fifteen minutes later I found Ormond and the Professor thb centre of a group of bril lauot men and women. I w?olted straight up to them, and stood facing the two murderers. Ormond glanced carelessly at me and the Irofossor smiled kindly. " What is the matter, Jack, you look white and harassed. HLave you seen a ghostl'" No," I a uswerd coldly and distinctly, " bat I nave just looked upon the dead face of a murdered woman. Gregory Ormond, your wife is dead, aud I accuse you and your ,lever eouietife accomplice, Professor Wag. stats, of her death." I glanced toward the open door nos I sees louoly and Iistinclly, and the two ollicers from Scotland Yard came in and advaoced towardeas us. Some of ohe ladles screamed, some finnted Blatrice Stanley stood prfeectly still, livid to the lips, with a great horror in her hand some eyes, and the men looked white and frlghteuod. " We arret you in the Queen's name for the murder of Charlottu Ormond." Grcgory stoodl mute and still beneath the Iron grasp of one of the olicers, a terrible e.tomness upon his ghastly face ; but the t'lrotcssor lightly shook off his man's hand and walked toward me, smiling blandly as usunl. " My dear Doctor," ho soid, "this is un kind of you, It was all In the Interest of sclience. I murdered the unhappy young woman if you like, I do not deny it, I do not regret it, I would do it again Oand again to ganla the knowledge I haveo gained. it is a ucuatiful thing, a noble poison I shall I eu plain it to youl A hl I you shrink, aond you're a doctor, too. i I WVhy, doctor, it l liked I oould 1ill yoo there as you stand.

'lako canre of him, ," whiepercd to tho officer, "loe in mad, poor old man." At that moment tBatrlce Stanleoy's horror and natoni.hmont found voioe ; wolking un. steadily to her brother, she saild hskiliy: "Is this true ? Have you murdered Charlottoe" He retotrnd her gaon with wild haggard eyts , and whispered : " It was for her sake, Beatlte." As he spoke he withdrew his alngers from his breast, where they had been lightly re'r tog during the whole of the painful scene, and te next instant a sharp report rang lthrough thle room. A woman'o soriek followed, and Gregory Ormond fell backwordl into hsle siter's armse shot thro?gh the he?rt. It 0wa on bhristmas Day, our last day at Ormonl H.II. We had followed poor Cnar. lotto Ormond to hor grave, and now stood side by side mentally bidding good-bye to the silent, deseolted Hall. I had promised to eocort the little grey nurse back to the arms of her grey sialoters and the shelter of a woll- kno on institution in London, and in the morning we were going to torn our backs on the oIl place for ever. The guests had all taken their departure, lteatrlce Stanley remained shut up in her room, the Professor had been removed to a private asylum, and Orogury Ormoud lay coll and still in the darkened room a aitlnog his burial. I glanced at the girl at my side as we stood by the drawing.room window overlook ing the snowy grounds. She was pale and heavy.eyed, and weary little lined of pain shewed round, the corners of her sweet month. " You look tired," I said tenderly ; "you will he glad of a rest." "Yea," she answered dreamily, "I shall he glad of a rest." "Never mind, this is your last rase, little ene," I said cheerfully, "no more haunted houses or poisoning cases for you." " I hope not," she replied geravely, regard ing me with soft troubled eoes ;" bat s hall he ready for any case oar matron cares to send me to." . Oh no, yen will not, my pretty little grey nurse," answered coolly. I shall ho?a a voice in that. Don't yon know that you are to belong to me from henceforth I" I put my arrs round her and drew her to me. ' ona are to tell your matron to-morrow that I wich you to reeign. I am to be your patient for the funtnre, will you tako care of mo, Kitlty" And for anawer aho. uoltly klostd me.
