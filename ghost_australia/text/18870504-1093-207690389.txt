I The the St. Writing on May 2 with reference to the "ghobt," particulars of which were published laBt week, our Cradock correspondent says "Trooper Mitchell and six others from thi3 place started at about 3 o'clock yesterday after noon for the haunted cottage. They arrived there about sundown, and found the place deserted, the windows and doors being fastened up. The trooper and another of the party stayed all night, but heard nothing. In the morning on their way home they saw Mr, and Mrs. Bamdorf, and the trooper had an inter view with them. They are thoroughly con vinced that there is something most unearthly about the place, and promised him that if he came down again they would accompany him with the little girl and stay in the place at night to give him every chance of hearing what goes on. They state that the little girl used to sit on an empty birdcage in the hut, and that the knocking could be distinctly heard inside the cage no matter where it was placed. When she was sitting a) the table the noise wa3 heard underneath. It is the intention of the trooper if possible to visit the house again very shortly accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Hamdorf."
