Spectator. :The first levee of his Excellency Sir C. H. Darling was held on Wednesday the 16th inst. at tire Exhibition Building. There is nothing new to describe in the manner or arrangements of the day. His Excellency, punctual to time, arrived at the Exhibition Building a few minutes past three o'clock, escorted by a troop of the Prince of Wales V. L. Horse. A guard of honor, consisting of fifty rank and file of the Royal artilory, was drawn up in front of the chief entrance. Not withstarling- the showers of rain there was a considerable number of spectators, and shortly after the appointed time the main streets and others were filled with carriages; and cabs, &c.; Altogether the levee may be pronounced to be as sue. cesful as could be desired, the attendance being maort numerous than on any like occasion. The officers and members of the University, the military authorities, ministers, ex-ministers, members of par liament, their honors the judges, minis ters of religion, merchants, laity, coun. cillors with their worthy mayor, and a nondscript crowd of nobodies made np a presentable group thatmust to some ex tent have surprised our new governor. Addresses were presented by Dean Ma. cartney from the clergymen of tie Church of England, and by Mr J. B. Were, Danish Consul, on behalf of the foreign consuls in Victoria. Among the con spicuous persons present was Mr O'Sha nasiy, and among the conspicuous per sons absent was the Roman Catholic -Bishop Dr Goold. Tile oath of office taken the other day includes the oath relating to supremnacy and is understood to have given offence. At about quarter past four o'clock his Excellency withdrew and returned to his residence in Collins street east, escorted by the Light Cavalry. A case of.bushranging,;an offence now happily so rare in the annals of Victoria, was tried yesterday at. the Criminal Sittings before Mr. Justice ' Molesworth. The prisoner was one Peter Keenan, who had been arraigned the day before, ill company with one Cain, for assaulting and r-obbing Edward Jeffcot Stack,-or, the 29th Auguat.. -Cainuhad. pleaded "Guilty;' .but Keenan, whol pleaded f "Not guilty," .had- his trial fixed for yesterday. In opening the case,- tie learned Crown prosecutor congrattilated the Conrt upontthe activity of the police as instanced in this case by detectives Black and Williams, whose conduct, as evidencing the perfection of our detective force, went far to save this country from the curse of bushranging experienced ili New. South Wales, He tben called evidence, which proved thle following' facts: -Mr Stick was ' gold -buyer atid draper 'atDayleaford, and every Satiir day he rode fifteen :miles to the 'Blue Mountain rush:to buy gold.: Ot Satur day, August 22, he met on the road,- two mert, Keehan andil Cain, who appeared to be clearing: the road. As he rode on Cain enme acnoross the ro?d, as if he were goinrg to 'iitop the horse; but the 'latter was at lull lop, lnpnd passed:on" safely. On the' followhig Saturday Mr. :Stack saw the same men, just beyond a oreek. lie looked about for a safe crossing, anid CCiin, coming forward,,showed him .the ford: Just as he was getting up the.op oirete baik, however, Caiii .caught .tlie bridle, and, presenting a revolver, told Mr. Stack to get" off his"hlorse. Mr. Stack would not;'buit Keenan comding up with an axe' led him to:change his re solve, and, half dragged, he managed: to dismount. He was next searched- and Â£300 5s. taken from Ihim. The bush rangerasthen ordered him into the-biush, and, after some dispute and tltreats to shoot, hie weont? and waiss tied hanid and foot near his horse, whicih was "alsd6iied up 100 yards from hiin. Th'l'l scoutmn drels then decamped ;but iin quarter of an hour afterwards Mr Stack managed to untie himself, and: mounting his horse, i followed his assailants till he lost eight of the"in'iisi?oemr icriedai.

Tlte ideintifleantioi wnisnoon complete, both on the part of Mr. Stack and Mr. Kirk; a mmn named Cummina also admitted that he Ihad been induced by Keenan and Cain to join in their at tempt, hut had abandoned it before ii came off. The defence set np wase, thit there was a mistake in the identity ;but after the judge's esumining up/, .he jnry hardly Ihesitated a second in returinig an verdict of " Guilty."

T'he Criminal Seasions' ofrthe Supreme Court were continued on Thursday before Mr. Juatice Molesvorth.i" The principal event lof tie day was pnqlntr senteoce upon Keenan and Cain; thie Isuelhranigers, who hald Ieen convicted on tile previous day.

A RoYAL CoJsrostron.- According to ancient usage in Prussia, all the Princes of a Royal family must learn a trade. The Prince Frederick William, I married to the Princess Royal of Eng- r land, learned the trade of a componsitor, c at the office of Mr. IHunel, at Berlin. Not only was the reporters' gallery crowded by visitors (writes the Mel bourne correspondent of the Star), but that portion of the Council Chamber set I apart for members of the Legislative t Assembly was also invaded by the out- I side goths and vandals on Friday, to ( view the pageantry ind ceremony of proroguing Parliament. An anmusing incident arose out of this. A member finding his seat occupied by a rather i ponderous gentleman, very like a parson, directed the attentiun of the new usher c (Mr. Le Souef) to the intruder, who a when beckoned to retire cahnly shook I his head, and seemed placidly content with his situation, quite satisfied that it i was impossible to turn him out and dis- c turb the House. However the member, c who isa bit of a wag, had his revenge, for when his portly foe rose to his feet s to get a better view of the proceedings, + his hat was dexterously placed on his seat by the watchful and wrathful memn- ( ber whose place he occupied, and the t rev. gentleman discovered that on sitting I down again he had made a pancake of I his own "bell-topper." Another inci dent was the difficulty in obtaining at quorum to accompany the Speaker, and t it is yet doubtful whether there were I more than nineteen members present t after all. It appears that the charms of t the ladies, who occupied the principal t seats in the galleries, had attracted a great many members from their allegi iace to the speaker. FEARFUL ENCOUN'TER IS A. RAILWAY CAnRIAGE.-On Friday last a munrierous 1 assault was made in a railway carriage on the Lailon and North- Western line by Mr Michael Lyons, National School t teacher, of Bampiark, Ballymascallan, near Dundalk, upoun two fellow passen- 1 gers. The assailant had taken a return excursion ticket torn month from Ireland to London. As the 9.15 express train was about to start from Liverpool to Lood n he, Mr. Peter NM'Lean, and iMr James Worland, of Plaistow, Essex, en tered a second-class carraige, in which there was previously an elderly lady. After the train had started, the prisoner who had a large carpet bag, placed him self close by the window. He was heard to say something incoherently, but al most in a menacing sort of a way. Mr Worland and Mr M'Lean, who were coan. versing, looked towards him, as did also the lady, who was seated 'near the window.un the opposite side of the car raigue.i The prisoner, however, sat do.wn quietly,, and continued so until after the tr.,it hid passed the Bletcl:ey station. Then'he suddenly jumped up. from his seati and, wuith a. large open clsapkntife in his himil, r;shed Mt Mr W-orland, and stabbed him. in tlie: forehead,;'causing a most .frightful iw.vihnd.': H .his is. the act of striking aiiother blows htiMr Wor land,' whetir M' M' LeTi ino lked bliinm'~ ck on to thet seaidt This li'ad tlite' fli'ct of infuriatitius him th mlird.: ? . ` stihited to his feet.~ and wsi lou' t'.toril03 another` blw ait Mri Wuoriid, ~ilids"i'fi M.iLean seized' lii by tie thiroat, cid cliutched ithe` knife in'( hisc', riglit hanud.

DiscoVERY OF A SAND-IONEDDEDDED Tows Is FRANCE.-A. singular dis- r envery, it is said, has been made on the i French coast, pear the mouth of the Garonne. A town has been discovered buried in the sand, and a church has already been extracted from it. Its I original plan shows it to have been built near the close of the Roman empire. The original paintings, its sculptured choir and capitals, are adorned with pro fuse ornaments, which are attracting a large number of visitors. This is all that remains of those cities described by Pliny and Strobo, although the gulf of Gascony abounds in ruins of ancient cities. " A rather singular scene," says the Alaryborough l Advertiser, "was witneessed in the main street of Majorca, one dlay last week. Two rival gold brokers, I carrying on businessat no great distance apart, had heard curious rumours res pecting each other, in fact, one of them, A, it is said, hadl been endeavouring to induce the carters to persuade their customers to bring all their gold to him, and hlie would allow a commission of threepento per ounce on all purchases so made. B having heard this, immie ldiately announced that he would give Â£3 19s Od for the gold (an advance of 6d per ounce on the market rate). Not to be outdone, A offered Â£4 for the same. Finding how matters were going, B thought, in the plentitode of his wisdom, that it would be better to ar range matters, and, with this view, paid a visit to A. After some remarks about things in general, the subject matter of the visit was brought forward, when a f rather angry discussion ensued, in the I course of which B called A 'a gentle r man,' upon which A delivered a right hlander on the os .frontis, drawing copious streams of ' claret,' and cansin,. what surgeons term extravasation of r blood around the eyes. B made his exit quickly, after having his wounds washedl by the good lady of the house. It is I said an action for assault will soon be brought in our Police Court, when the new court louse is completed." Employers of labor are " earnestly requested" to do what they can to pro video occupation for the inmigrants awaiting engaoemnent at the depot in r Melbourne. The list shows about thirty different avocations amongst some eighty i men-many of these, we apprehend, will be found unavailable at present in this country. From inquiries at the depot, we learn that there are upwards l of two hundred immigrants remaining \- undistribnted,-of the Lancashire opera r tives .and others forwarded tnder Mr. WKnight's auspices. The statistics of e these Lancashire importations are the a following :-By the Queen of the South, 20 married couples, with 14 children, a and six infants, and 1 single male were e received. The Sourtlhern Ocean brought I. 50.married couples, 50 children, 4 a infants, .4 single:. men, and 2 single e females. The former vessel reached the 1 port about 12th Angust, the latter on a. the 24th. Of the entire number received a Intthe depot, six, couples ,Ihve gone into hilred 'service, and four couples have left k ontheir own account, leaving, as will be Ã½ seen, a large number still in receipt of I Government rations and aceomnnodation. 3 As an inducemetitto parties up- country, who may require servants, the Govern I ment have decidqd to convey free, by railway, any of these immigrants to their \- destination, provided it lies on the lines We 'need hardly :add that many of tihe s immigrants themselves are growing ir s patient, as they left England with timhe expectatioin that the demand for labor f was so urgent thnai they would be almost immediately engaged on landing. 'For, a long time past it has been sus pected that numbers of cattle suffering from pleuro.pneunionia have been slaugh tered at the Melbourne abattoirs, and the carcases sold fir food In the city and sunburbs..

TIne FaEsco AnRtr I hMlExICO. We read in the Mloniteur:-" The pro longation of the military operations before Puebla and the resistance our troops encounter, excite the ipu'lic, Con fidence in a rapid success having been great, the impatience felt is all the stronger upon seeing the expeditionary corps triumph over the unexpected oh stacles against which the couranee of the sohliers and the skill and devotion of the leaders contend so energetically. To these preoccupations are naturally added the qiestion of supplies of food and ammunition, which have always, how ever, been ensured sufficiently for all requirements. Thus at the date of the last official news, the 19th of April, the troops before Puebla were provided for fifty days with rations, the renewal of which was effected easily. Moreover, a reserve of three millions of comple:e rations, corresponding with a period of three months for the entire expedi tionary corps, was concentrated at Vera Cruz. As to the ammunition of the in fantry and artillery, successively shipped and added to that taken by the various detachments of the expeditionary corps, they consist-to mention only the prin cipal items--of 12,800,000 infantry car tridges, or an average of 600 cartridges per matn; 42,348 rifled cannon shot, or 675 for every piece de montague, 120 for every field piece, 1,023 for every reserve gun, 1,000 for every siege gun. To these supplies, anti to the re I sulrces of cannons, powder, and ammo nition found at Vera Criz or furnished t by the navy, will soon be added one million cartridges, 19,800 rifled cannon f balls, 9,000 shells, and 55,000 kilo granimes of powder, which are at pre sent being sent from tihe orts of St. Nazaire and Toulon. With the twofold object of maintaining the supplies of all kind on a level with the consumption, the Minister of Marine organised from the month of Marcl, independently of the monthly departures from St. Nazaire by tile transatlantic steamers, a line of vessels sailing on the 23rd of every month, either from Toulon or Cherbourg, for Vera Cruz, and which bring back on their return the mien whose wounds or whose enfeebled health render chanige of air and the attention of the mother country necessary."
