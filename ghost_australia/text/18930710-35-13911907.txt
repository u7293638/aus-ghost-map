I MODERN WITCHCRAFT. -.- X London Evening Standard.) The witch-finder, in the form of judge and jury, has lately been at work in Bel fast It appears that a gentleman of Lurgan, growing weary of the slow and cautious methods of modern physicians, entrusted his case to a celebrated medicine-man of the neighbourhood, whose methods seemingly find no place in the British Pharmacopoeia But whether because it was too late, or because the disagreement of the rival practitioners extended even to their prescriptions, the charmer " was unable to charm with sufficient wisdom, and the patient died Hence the legal proceedings which late y occupied wig and gown in Belfast. Most of us matter-of-fact Saxons who read of the case in the final paragraph of an English paper, will probably set it down as yet another example of the unfortunate methods and manners of the Sister Isle We shall doubtless feel pharisaical grateful that that sort of thing does not occur in this enlightened land and to some of us it may seem to furnish yet another argument against the fitness of the Celt for Home Rule A free and independent voter who would prefer incantations md abracadabra to antipyrin and castor oil for the cure of his personal infirmities, might be expected to advocate no loss heterodox remedies for the varied ills of the body politic, to the confusion of political economy and the science of go vernment that that sort of thing went out of England, say we, when out great-grandmothers gave up the manufacture of " Plague water " or " Venice treacle from their respective nine and fifty or sixty - two ingredients, thanks mainly to the enlightened energy of Matthew Hopkins, of Manningtree, an estimable gentleman who has not received due credit for the martyr like constancy which led him at last to exemplify in his own person the treatment best calculated to eradicate the " abominable heresy " of witchcraft and all its " horrible sect " But the lack Art dies hard There is a small village in Lincolnshire its care shall not be immortalised where a modern Alruna wife still drives a thriving trade It is a long and straggling village, dotted along the bank of a in or, up and down which have floated the ideas of many nations for unknown ages-a village, therefore, which has had every chance to know better, and to put away the childish things of its Danish and Saxon forefathers for the more liberal wisdom of later con» tunes But it is a pig-headed village Its horizon, physically wide enough, is intellectually " cribbed, cabined, and confined," nor do its leading lights confess to any higher ambition than may afford them an accurate knowledge of the current price of potatoes. It is on I j some 20 years ago that they submitted to the liberal innova- tion of a church and a school, and to this day they keep a jealous guard over the dangerous dissemina- tion of knowledge, and resolutely refuse to have a school board But they are an estimable folk in their way, not unduly given over to inebriety or evil doing, and proud of asserting that they "don't 'hang upon nobody a gold albert, and they view the half-dozen annual inundations of their dwellings and the year-long minutes of their lands as part and parcel of the beautiful orderings of Providence there are two great men in the village One is the parson, of whom they speak as "Reverend" simply, and whom they used to respect because of his indefatigable efforts to collect his times , the other is the democratic churchwarden, whom they reverence because he is constantly at loggerheads with the person And there is one great woman in the parish She is a particularly offensive looking woman, even in a land where rougher and ague have gone far to destroy all traces of womanly beauty She has no occupation, seemingly, but to whine and the burden of her winning is that she is a cripple There are portions in the village who know better, but they say nothing, and they accept as a matter of course her occasional appearances in the street, where she moves about by the combined aid of one leg and a chair She holds the chair by the back, supporting upon its cost the alleged impotent knee, and advances the chair and the other leg alternately. To an outsider there is nothing impressive in this method of getting about, and even the villagers know that it is an unnecessary piece of display but she has employed it for so many years that she would probably find it a difficult matter to convince herself that it is needless him is about 00-no more, and she has a husband, but he says nothing and does nothing Upon the inviting creature's flat depend the wills of half the village Of course the older folks have ceased to consult her save in very perplexing emergencies, and being fully alive to the value of money, they are not very profitable clients, but there is a large circle of young girls, practically all in the neighbourhood, who regard Mother H 's powers as far too dangerous to be neglected, much less defied For the most part they are domestic servants, earning the usual £10 tells a year, and requiring the whole of their earnings, one would suppose, to provide them with finely and ribbons But the majority of them have to pay heavy taxes to their uncanny friend, and there are very few bold enough to dispense with her services and ignore her denunciations One way or another she country is to make herself necessary to almost all at one time it will be for supposed services in securing them situations at another for similar kind offices in the matter of lover's quarrels and, failing these more immediate excuses, also ensnared them by undertaking to "work" their futures for them in a more general way Her method of procedure is simple but efficient She professes to be in direct communication with their departed relative c, and to secure the beneficent attitude of the same towards their various representatives on earth It is hardly to be credited how implicitly thee young v women, most of them getting on for 18 years, and all rejoicing in the culture imparted, even to out-of- the-way) villagers by the educational machinery of our day, believe in the potency of ghosts for good or evil It is a subject upon which they rarely speak to any one outside of their own class, and they are least of all willing to act knowledge any dealings with wise we now " to mitigate possible dangers arising from the malignity of a defunct relative but some of them submit to a yearly tax amounting to a full half of their hardly-earned wages rather than run any risks on this score Naturally there is no limit to the wise woman's exactions beyond her own discretion She is assured of the secrecy of her victims and aware of the exact amount of pressure which each will tolerate The dire vengeance with which she threatens them for any breach of confidence is rather a matter of form than a necessity, for few of them ever dream of rebellion When they awake at last to the unpleasant conviction that they have been swindled, and that Mother His hardly the kind of tool which a self-respecting ghost would condescend to employ) swore he never so malignant, they prefer to keep the secret of their folly and allow their persecutor to pursue her business with other victims Indeed, none but the most childish minds could be persuaded by Mother H methods so very crude are they In one in stance w owing to him one of her clients, in this case is a housemaid in a pretentious London establishment, she urged the immediate remittance of is " Your father " said the letter which we reduce to corner syntax and orthography, both being subjects below the wise woman's range of view-" came to me last night and said he must have the money at once He was very angry with you, and said that if it was not paid at once he would be damned " Truly a mercenary ghost. One would like to know for what purpose he desired to 55 He, or his agent, failed to get it, for the girl's story came to light when she was detected in the attempt to supply the money at her employer's expense, and she was weaned from her benighted allegiance But nothing was done to disturb Mother His career, and who is probably at this moment deriving as large an income as ever from her confiding flock But what a sordid contrast to the good old-mshtoacd witch of the story books ' No broom for a Pegasus, no block cat for a familiar, no traditional crutched stick or incantations, not even the dignity which leaves the question of remuneration to the good taste of the party interested nothing but the vulgar common place of postal orders, and of ghosts that soak to extent by threats the price of a bottle of brandy, one dances gay in An aid to shooting has been devised by a Vienna watchmaker in the shape of a little automatic clockwork apparatus that is applicable to all firearms, and by the aid of which it is said to be , possible for troops in the rear of an army to shoot with precision over the heads of those in front without danger to the latter. Reserves will thus be enabled to stand at a greater distance from the place of an engagement than heretofore, and yet take an active part in the fight It is described as " a piece of clockwork, or small apparatus, by which, if a rule is held so as to come up to a certain angle of elevation, the whole magazine of cartridges or a. single cartridge will be automatically discharged " It is reported to be simpler and, therefore, more applicable than a similar instrument lately invented in Germany but, whether it can be brought into practical use depends upon the result of the tests to which it is now being submitted by a committee of the Austrian War Office invention. A summary Los just been published showing how railways are distributed over the United States. The mileage is that at the end of 1891, and only includes single track, double, third, and fourth tracks and sidings not being counted The total mileage was, at the time stated, 170.C01 miles. Illinois had the greatest mileage (10, 18 miles, or 6 per cent of the total) It was followed by Pennsylvania, with 8920 miles (5 25 per cent ), Kansas, 8891 miles (a 23 per cent.), Texas, 8313 miles O 18 per cent.). Iowa, 8437 miles (5 per cent.), Ohio, 8168 miles (4 8 per cent ), New York, 7705miles (4 87 per cent), Michigan, 7187 miles 4.22 per cent.) Missouri, 0178 miles (3 6 per cent ), Indiana, 335 miles (J 6 per cent), Wisconsin, 5786 miles (3 4 per cent ) Minnesota, 8671 miles (3 18 per cent) Nebraska, 5430 rules ( 1 2 per cent ) All the other States had less than 5000 miles of railway. The lowest in the scales are Idaho, Nevada, and Rhode Island. Professor Gustavo Sohlegol, of the University of Leyden, has recently shown that the Wen-chin, or tattooed people, mentioned by the old Chinese historians as living 7000 li north-east of Japan, were inhabitants of Ouroup, one of the Kurile Islands Tattooing was, however, common at this time ( lOO a n.) in that part of the world from Yeddo to Greenland Professor Schlegel also main- thing that Japan was formerly occupied by the small men of the Tungusie stock. No doubt the Japanese, like every other important people, are a very mixed race. Their traditions bring the true Japanese, or later immigrants, from the south, but it seldom or never happens that the earlier inhabitants of a country are wholly expelled or exterminated by successful invades.
