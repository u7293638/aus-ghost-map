music scenes Morning Heralds WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1867. In the Assembly, j yesterday), Ministers, in answers to questions, said That the tender of Galbraith and Bridge for supplies to Uemma gaol was declined in consequence of it not being the lowest, that on the 20th July, the Secretary for Works received a letter from Mr Rae, Under Secretary relative to the inquiry into the defalcation of Charles Eastwood, truth letter should be laid on the table that borings for the Wollondilly Bridge were made in July, 1861, and the bridge had been inspected and some of the timber prepared for it had been condemned and that the Government had made only a conditional arrangement Tilth Kohn and Co , the condition being that the terms of the proposed loan should meet the approval of Parliament, and that beyond this Government had done nothing Mr John B Suttor took the oath and his seat Mr GarrETT apologised for having done an injustice to the traffic manager of the Great Northern Rail way He had now ascertained, beyond doubt, that that officer had sent no telegram to Sydney relative to the escape of Eastwood Petitions from Benjamin Richards, praying to be heard before the select committee on the Garaldool i run, from Murrurundi, in favour of a speedier continuation of the Great Northern Railway, from Queanbeyan, are , favour of a bridge over the Shoalhaven and from Sydney, in favour of an amendment of the District Courts Act, were presented, and ordered to be received Mr rousTi.li moved a series of resolutions in reference to the case of Mr Charles Moore, Director of the Botanic Gardens, and affirming that the Government had no ground in the facts before them for recalling Mr Moore from the office of Commissioner to the Paris Exhibition He stated the facts of the case to be that Mr Moore had received leave of absence, and had gone home as Director of the Botanic Gardens on business of his office, and on full salary, advantage being taken of his presence in Europe to appoint him Commissioner to the Exhibition This appointment, however, was entirely collateral In this situation he was left to act on his own responsibility, and received no letter of instructions On his way be stopped a fortnight at Galle, probably to carry out his mission as Director, but reached London before all the exhibits had arrived, and in time to prevent the exhibition of Australian articles from suffering in any ii a) the Government, however, were informed of the delay, and they con- municated the intelligence to the Executive Commissioner. Mr Murray This gentleman thereupon sent a letter to the Colonial Secretary in which were two charges against Mr Moore,-first, that he had delayed on his journey, to the later of the exhibition of articles from this colony, and, second, that having been provided with funds to pay his expenses to Paris he had made arrangements with the P. and O. Company for a free passage This letter was written by Mr. Murray without the knowledge or consent of his fellow Commissioners who were in fact opposed to the Mews there taken, and upon it, the Colonial Secretary, without consulting his colleagues and without making an) inquiry), recommended the recall of Mr. Woore from his office as Commissioner. Subsequently, the body of Commissioners met in Sydney and" recommended the re- instatement of Mr. Moore, but the Colonial Secretary declined, on the ground that it was then too late. Upon this plain statement of facts, and upon the papers before the House, he considered his resolutions were completely borne out, whilst it required very little from him to support them. He brought this matter forward for the sake of the public service generally. Mr. Moore was condemned whilst absent, and, of course, unheard and such conduct on the part of the Government would be likely to have a most injurious effect upon the Civil Service generally. Mr. Parkes said there was no precedent in any English Legislature for such a motion as this. It was utterly inconsistent with constitutional government to select one Minister for attack, whilst it had been put before the House by a violent distortion of facts. In the first place, Mr. Moore was not sent home as Director of the Botanic Gardens, and in the next his appointment as Commissioner was not collateral. He was sent home specially as Commissioner, and for the time sunk his position as Director. Then, instead of receiving no instructions, he had a letter of instructions from the Executive Commissioner, and the Colonial Secretary, instead of making no inquiry, had made every inquiry that it was possible to make. The recommendation for Mr. Moore's recall was made not by the Colonial Secretary, but by the Cabinet, and the letter to the Commissioners, declining to rein- state Mr. Moore, did so, not because it was then too late, but upon substantial reasons there given. Going through the circumstances of the case minutely, he showed that Mr. Moore had disobeyed "THe iilbtuie.lí(iiib"rtciiv(irtrom the Executive Council ] sion er, and the strict îiijtinctiiitis of the Government, by declaring at Galle; whilst he had noted most in properly in taking for himself the free passage thin hand in on offered by the P. and O. Company for the Secretary of the Commissions to refer these circumstances, of the Government had allowed such c millie t (0 jams without notice, they would have really been worthy of censure , whilst, in dealing with it as they had done, they had acted only in accordance with their duty. Mr. I'aiikis then quoted fry in a debate in " HmiB'tid," the only one he could find in the P trliainsntury records that in any way resembled the one now before the House and from the speeches of Lord Palmerston and Mr. Gladstone-, showed that tin so statesmen held it to be unconstitutional to proceed as the House was now doing. If the Executive could not [deal properly with the departments under them, they should be put out of office ; but as long; as they retained their posts. Parliament should support them in dealing with their officers. hit TAMLIN denied that the course now taken was unconstitutional, and accounted for the fact that no case similar to the present was to be found in the Parlmnicntnr) records, by the circumstance that the British Government did not deal with its public servants in the same way as this Government did, and there were consequently, no acts of injustice to repair He then gave her view of the matter, and whilst blaming Mr Moore for delaying in G able, when it was so often is that he should hurry on to England, he asserted that his offer had not been so great as to demand so heavy a penalty as that of Mr Moore's recall Mr "Wimiuvik could not understand how Mr Forster took the extreme view that he did of this case All that Mr Forster had said had not in any way moved the impression made upon him (Mr AN indexed) by the circumstances of the case, as they first came to his knowledge Mr Moore had evidently done wrong, and the Government had dealt with him in the way they had thought best If the IIjuso expected the Government to act with firmness, instead of seeing them weak and vacillating, us too many Governments before them had been, it ought to take over) different course to that which was now marked out for it Mr roithTEit replied, and the resolutions were put, and negatived on dniMon by a majority of 35 to 12 Mr Gauiiktt moved the adoption of the report of the Select Committee on the petition of the Shoal haven Municipality). The report recommended the payment to the municipality of the costs of the injunction in the case of Bell) against the municipality At the instance of the Crown, an appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court had been made to the Privy Council, and, pending that appeal, the costs of the injunction had been incurred Mr Mari h opposed the motion, as the costs had been incurred by the foolish conduct of the municipality After the Supreme Court had given its )udg ment against them, the Major of this defunct murder part), disregarding the decision of the Court, took steps towards collecting rates from Mr Berry That gentleman, to protect himself, applied for an injunc- tion, and these costs were incurred through the rashness of the municipals) in contesting it After a brief reply from Mr Gaiikttt, the question was put, anducgiimed on division by a majority of 19 To 139 Mr AViiiTL moved that the House would, on Monday next, go into committee to consider the advisability of placing on the. Estimates £181 Is 11 as compensation for land in Muswellbrook taken from Mrs li Nowland, for rating) purposes The land had been taken, but owing to this 11d) s ignorance she had not made her application for compensation within the time prescribed by the Railway Act, and the Government were unable to pay the money the Government made no objection to the motion which was put and carried Mr lluitm i in moved for a return of the number of persons admitted into the Lunatic As) firms within the last two years, showing those who have sufficient means for procuring meet al assistance its object was to have such a return as would enable the House to deal with the question of lunatic asylums, when brought before it, especially as he had been informed that there were now man) patients whose friends were quite capable of supporting them, and who ought not therefore to be kept at the expense of the public Mr. Parker said that, as far as it was possible for them to do so, the Government would supply the information asked for After some remarks from Mr Diqvvm and Mr DnrvBit and a reply) from Mr Luhdkkin, the motion was put and carried The House adjourned at twenty minutes to 11 until t o clock to day A MEASURE which has excited but little attention in the colonies, hut is of high importance both to them and to the mother country-the Reform Bill - will develop its great consequences at a very early) date We have enjoyed if such a word may be used to designate the peculiar state of feeling through which we have passed-an unlimited extension of our political liberties We have seen both sides of the question This is invariably productive of some diminution of that enthusiasm with which a new and glittering phase of human affairs presents itself to the imagination We have seen what has been the issue in the composition of our legislative bodies, and in the measures which have found favour in their sight It would be wrong to say that they have been so mischievous in their character as might sometimes have been pre- dicated from the threatenings' which have accompanied them, or that they have not been in many instances a real amelioration, inasmuch as they have adapted the facts of our position to the exigencies of the country there are some cases where all continuous struggle has ended in mischief There are other revolutions so thrust upon the world by the course of events that those who will not meet them will by them be suppressed and over turned We do not say that we have not gone further than it was necessary to go, or that a stouter and more intelligent resistance in some points could not have been followed by popular acquiescence In fact, on many occasions there has not only been a spirit of cowardice shewn by those who have assumed to be the conservative party, but a spirit of compromise which has had its rise in interests thoroughly individual and personal We have therefore found the cause sometimes surrendered by those who ought to have defended it, and seen not without disgust the face ty with which men have retracted their opinions, and become the instruments of realising those of their neighbours. If anything could reconcile us to what is undesirable and mean in colonial politics, we might turn to the present state of English parties and perhaps find some consolation. The Reform Bill is not the work of any great section of the political world. It expresses no opinions that have ever been defined or embodied in any previous stage of our history. There have been concessions made so extraordinary as to confound those who have anticipated an obstinate resistance; and, on the other hand, there have been compromises admitted by radical men which could hardly have been expected from their professions and antecedents. The result, however, of all is a bill which has no parentage, which has no very precise and clear character ; whose issue cannot be forecast by any human prescience, and which is thrown upon the world as the chance result of Parliamentary wisdom. "We can only wish that it may be fraught with all the blessings which have been predicated as its natural issue, and that those evils will be avoided which it has been declared with equal confidence it will provoke. There is this consolation in looking at all changes in England, which seem at first to threaten dangerous results. No one can look at the operation of the Reform Bill of 1832, and compare the situation of England with countries that are struggling against old traditions and endeavouring to acquire political liberty, without feeling that this great channel for the expression of the hopes and desires and views of the people of England has been the means of great blessings Abuses have been indicated The lnlcuMsof a huge section of the Hon It, formed) antagonistic, have been in on a denice reconciled the intense bitterness of the in as if lilias not been much reduced li is in vc) I lick t>s been ignored by legislation the centre of the country needs millions who would have perished but for those laws which 900 remand from the increased power of the people Men), of course, regret that 1 ]nivilt(,es they once enjoyed, and grudge the extension of benefits to their fellow counlMmtn Those, however, who have no s) nip ith) with an) objects or view fa but such as accord with the stability of the country, the firmness of its credit, and its respectability in the eyes of all nations, va will have little concern for lamentations Ml'th line only, a person of hearing and only express the egotism of the Immun heart 'Then we have also the fact that no political system can absolutely control the long continued habits of the people They have their history the great numbers of the country have their influence There is no over eagerness except in a few politic d circles, to transfer the actual possession of power from the educated classes to the ignorant and brutal The monetary system which per evades a large portion of society, and, above all, the authority attached to landed possessions, will tend not indeed to resist but to moderate the progress of democratic principles, and, peril ips, Live time for the introduction of those authors tions which may render them less perilous There is a class of men whose cry is over turn ' overtime ' overturn'" they have no distinct perception of the consequences of change, or what will be their actual position when change is accomplished But the fervour of their passions and their anxiety to see things offered which are not to their taste, and, more than this, a love of mere motion, inspire them with the hope that we shall be always on the wheel of agitation-that we shall always be on the verge of revolution This is partly the feeling of youth where it has not been well taught and regulated But the state of education is very different now to what it was thirty years ago, and we may hope that influences so numerous, tending to moderate the force and to correct the per ver- bify of the passions, may render the new Reform Bill an instrument not of evil, but of good Such must be the desire even of those who have deprecated these changes, and seen them not without dread 'the addition of a million of letters is, however, a very serious advance, and we must wait to see under what influences they full It would be most unjust to suppose that the working people of England sympathise generally with such wretches as were ferreted out by the Sheffield Commission No doubt, wherever there is an attempt at combination there is a degree of terrorism, and the opposition which men encounter induces them often to look with a favorable eye upon any auxiliary that will render that opposition fruitless But when after a calm survey sense of the consequences of these miserable combinations shall take firm hold of the public mind, we imagine that all classes will submit to regulations which may render them less perilous, and that while the lights of labour are protected by law, those rights will be made subject to the conditions under which all others are enjoyed namely, obedience to the law itself It is now thirty years ago since the first successful attempt was made by Professor WiiEvisioNE and Mr. Colin fight Cook to send a message through a wire of a mile and a quarter in length, which was stretched between them "Never did I feel," says Professor Wiilytstonl, such a tumultuous sensation before, as when in that still room I heard the needle click and as I spelled cut the words, I felt all the magnitude of the invention now proved to be practicable beyond call it or dispute " This was in London in the year 1837. Since that time what have we to record of failure, of success, of failure leading to success. Com- paring the progress with the difficulties that have lain in the way, we are astonished at the result ; nor is this feeling moderated when we see that the greatest minds of the age are bent to give complete efficiency of this application of electricity to the purposes of overland and ocean telegraphy. The obstacles that have opposed those who have devoted their attention to the coupling of distant continents and islands by deep sea cables have been almost insuperable. The story of the great electricians is perfectly romantic. Their labours have been as pro- digious and as marvellous as those of the heroes of antiquity. Everything was experimental and untried. The construction of the cable, the insulation of the cable, the mode of depositing the cable, the bed it should rest upon, and the behaviour of the electric fluid through it when so laid everything was to be ascertained. Commerce is not tardy in availing itself of the achievements of science. In statistics published in 1865, it was stated that there were 500 miles of old working cables and 11,261 of new working cables. Dr. RussELL estimated the working cables at 68-12 miles and the cables abandoned at 9107 miles. The Atlantic cable having been added since that date, we may assume the successful list to amount to 10,600 miles. Each year brings more experimenters into the field, and gives all a greater mastery over the elements they have to deal with so that in celerity and certainty the lines laid down are continually improving, and are consequently increasing in favour with the public. At this time many schemes are abroad. Since to some of them we may be indebted in no small degree, it may not be undesirable to see what they are, and how they are likely to bear upon the interests of the community. When the mail left England an attempt was being made to establish an Anglo- Indian Electric Telegraphic Company, which should have a possible connexion with Australia. The present state of telegraphic communication with India is most unsatisfactory. An electrician will inform us that strictly speaking the flash of the fluid along the wire is instantaneous. But this is not true of the message, which, owing to various causes, between England and India, is liable at present to so many slips and I checks and mistakes, that days pass instead of horns between its dispatch and reception, and then, ten to one, it comes to hand in a mutilated and unreliable form. Differences in language and administration in many of the countries through which the messages pass may account for much of the delay) It is proposed to provide against this by placing the entire line from London via Egypt, Aden to India, under one single management, the clerks being English The route is that by which all the mails, passengers, troops, and overland merchandise between this country and the East are forwarded In order to stay out their object, this projected company have obtained concessions from various Governments of the use of the telegraph liness 'Thus the luUtui Government grants the exclusive use of the line from time to Mother, in Sicily, the writers Gtviinmint plants the existing Milla uni Alt xi china cable for a term of lost) two years , the liliLiuph to India Company) grants for a lease of twenty one years the existing land lines between Alexandria, Cairo, and Suez together with the concessions and firm was held by that Company) for establishing telegram tphs norn 1 Egypt to Aden and India A pro visional cession from tell) of the right to extend the line from steel) to Tripoli, in order to secure i I h road unite in case of interruption between Sicily and-Altxnndna, has also been obtained i It Is "stories about the through route from London to Suez will be in se' J' "Olle during the present year, and a contract has been en- killed 100 for making and laying a cable from Suez to Bombay, 1950 miles in length, the mine line to be completed in the course of 1868, or, at latest in the May of 1809 Now that money is cheap, it is by no means improbable that such a scheme may find sufficient supporters to carry it to success, and should India be reached, the extensions to Singapore, China, Japan, and Australia are not unlikely to follow it Whether this will be the first line to reach us we do not know , many lines are projected, but this at present stands in advance of most of those lines from which these colonies can expect much Information reaches us concerning an arrangement which is said to have been entered into by the Russian and Prussian Governments and an English and German contracting company, 1 china to the construction of a new line of telegraph between England and India, through their respective tendency The Russian Government have given a right of way, a lease of the new line and stations for twenty five years, and various other lights, and the coin paid by agrees to work the line by means of its own officials On its part the Prussian Government engages to construct and maintain two special lines through North Germany, parting with them to the company for the period of twenty five years lins design will be completed by the lining of a submarine cable in the Black Sea, 280 miles in length, between the Crimea and the Circassian coast the line from Teheran to India being already in the hands of the British Government, this company would thus hold uninterrupted possession of a telegraphic communication from England to Persia the British Government is understood to have agreed to facilitate these arrangements These measures are regarded with much interest, inasmuch as the new lines will not only facilitate intercourse between Europe and the East, but considerably reduce its cost Messages are now deal because the wires are but sparingly used, and the wires are sparingly used because the communication by means of existing lines is imperfect and unreliable 'Thus the British Government promise to reduce the tariff over the Persian lines and the Persian Gulf cable, so soon as an increase of messages shall occur in consequence of the new line There are many reasons for supposing that this line may be very well supported The Governments through whose territories it will will pass are anxious to secure it, and it will cost fully a third less than a purely submarine line the knows Willows ai.dOiiha\s Hid- Ino sum of £20 lad has been subscribed by the Port Master and pilots of Queensland for the above fund This amount is cent to Captain Hixson, with instructions that two thirds is to be given to Mrs Robinson, and one third to Mrs Render Ike South City-rd.
