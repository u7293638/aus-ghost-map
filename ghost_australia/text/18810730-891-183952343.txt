When her breath came back " the soft pink roses in her cheeks faded into the A normal1 pallor of her present condition, and she a' " looked even more fragile and diaphanous than - l" before. Pr. Quigley was looking after-her in '•0 his own way, but silently. He was waiting far spring time—andbeyond; waiting uii»ilsundry things should declare themselves more plainly than: at present,- before he again took on him-' self the unauthorised direotion'of cveota.- *' He waa waiting and watcbiog vigilaoiiy- and for more things than one. Hut ho tuck-no one into his confidence, and the revolutions outiveyed ' by !tho*e keen eyes and that active' rain re mained bis own property only, shared and sus pected by none. 'Supreme!' That was Valentine Cowley's present working word—the traction engine whioh- drew the whole verbal load, the camel' which was laden with all the dispersed straws of admiration. Everything of whteh he ap. proved waa ' supreme ;* and this' hriatm&s; time, Stella Branscombe, who had always been 'nloe,* was supremest of the snpreme. - Tha truth was; Valentine Cowley had suddenly become a" new manJ He had faHen under influences which;as he said, had completed hie-being.- 'To his former magnificent mnsonlarlty and worship of manly strength he had added a passion for blue china, Qaeen Anne architecture^ Morris's papers, Hosseti's poems, Buskin's prose, half tones in blue and greeny earneatneaa in men and tender stillnesa iu women—with a sublime con-" tempt for trade, luxury, the doctrine of evolu tion end the fr> irth dimension. Hehad met a certain man of m-rk— onoof the leaders of this school—just as he was casting his boyish • mental skin and becoming more manly and reflective, jnst as he was slipping like a hermit crab from one intellectual shell to another, - getting tired of play and oasting about for *work' and * his "life's meaning/ And this - man had cultivated him on his own lines and " made him, intelleotnaly, a new creature^— having, as he said, completed his being, leaving' him his mui>oles but adding thereto reveranoe for art, and knowledge of the true meaning of poetry. Having thus cone past the point when noisy hoydens were his chosen chums, Val had entered cu the huos of refinement and idealistto7 womanhood; of eamts iu their sweetnf sa and of ladies in their grace; even of blossoms tenderly > blighted and delicate to the .verge of sickliness* • And Stella, who was just aa beautifo) now in * the t»f her freehnesa—though beautiful in a different ' way and with more soul about her, Baid Yal— seemed to him just;'the kind of thing =that he liked best of altl and just the person for'whose • appreciation nature had fitted him Gip and Pip were still awfully j'»Uy' and awfully nice; the beat gfrMin^lre world, and with the Uaat nonsense about them that could be; but Stella Bran&oombe; touched a higher level than they oould ever aspire to readh7 Gip and Pip were of the arrested, son-developing class ; while for Stella all,manner of spiritual progress might be. expeotM.; 'and Gip and Pip laughed too much and too. loud, and had eyes far too bright and bold ^^ww'demig for his taste as it stood bow, j^^Ue SteUa'a.B weetj'low, tender tones and mild, .sad,' steadfast eyes seemed to him the very perfection .of. theirkind.

In braique, and. h^r. point* in piquet with the •tapid .and tht> old. But now she was even i more good-natured and more helpful, if that wen* possible Whenever anyone was wanted to. do a kind turn to, others, or to do what was uu plee-ant to herself, Stella Branacombe came to the frpnland took up'all the little fardels in a tow, shouldering them without a murmur. If » bore had to be got out of the way Stella took him (rn her.own hands and off the necks of the.! rest: if there were too many in a set, and some* | one had to give up, Stella was that someone; | if there was an uncomfortable bit of doty-to be i done in the parish, Stella was asked to do it, . and she. always did:.what she was asked: Yon it g as she was, she was getting to hold that imp* rpo&al; kind ol place which belongs to the * all rtqstio*. natures to be a kind of yonthfnl •ocinl.grandmother to all who came for help in moments ofseed, and from whom no one was turrf*daway unsatihfied.- - Still she felt that beyond all this she had to And spme more absorbing occupation than even sooiaI. attractions .-gave bar—something that shouldmake her quite forget her own trouble In the,activity of serious well-doing. Helping papa had failed to console her. Sheneverquito understood.why, but she knew that ithad; and ■he did not feel as if being a kind of social fairy godmother was the exaot ultimate of her aspira tions or abilities. Bat all thiVwaa by tbe bye Wha\sbe had to do in the immediate present was to make herself generally useful and univer-. tally amiable, to thrust back Cyril deep, deep into tbe recesses of her thoughts—as far in the hack ground as was possible * and to forget her ■elf all round And ehe fulfilled her self-im posed task to tbe letter. Over his spillikins, which served as a pre tence, Valentine fixed his dark eyes on tbe sweet fair face before him bending over the •table with all d'ella Branfccnmbc's sincerity of interest .in the thing in band. He looked at her long and ardently; then suddenly, without prsfaos:or.waraing,be asked; in a soft, eenti jpsnfal kind of way L 11 Tell 'meV[ MiujJranseombe, 'What is your ideal of life ?' Stella, who had sever gone into abstruse 'questions of this kind, even under her lather's frothy tuition, looked up with a puzzled face, andithen said: . i ' What do you meant* - • * * Your ideal of life/ repeated Valentin©, as ' if repetition were explanation,1 and - a puzzle said twice over gave its owh key ii> the.ecbo. • I do not know that X have any/ she said In a pretty, hesitating way, feeling' d'readl:&lly; dense and silly. ' I haVe nnvet thought of it. I . upposs one oUght to do what good one'can—to be as useful to others and as sincere to ourselves as is possible. I cannot give any other answer. What is your ideal ? - Then I shall know better what you mean byyour question/ ' * Mine ?' returned Valentin©. * My iueal of life is Karneatnese—the Worship of the tender and tha-beautiful—the Winging of religious riesai and spirituality into our daily doings, like dear old George Herbert—striving: after the better way through the culture of poetry by means of love and art/! An odd little' movement of repulsion pk'sed almost like a shudder over Stella.' ' I do not think I ©at© mttoh for'poetry/' she said naively; = '£ think X like something more prnoticaL* , ' Oh V he returned' in an aggrieved tone; ?' and you look the very soul of poetry in your own person 1-You not care for poetry ?—you .who are made to be a'man*s:muse; to inspire 1 his loftiest thoughts, his noblest aspirations 1' ;41 sincerely hope; nut/ said -Stella with curious gravity. " * X do not think' that'is my function at all' 4 No. What then! Where does your great gift of influence lie?' he asked eagerly. \- , He had made a bad shot by his first guess, but supreme as she was be must know in what censer be might burn his incense and by what litnrgy intone his deVotioua. -7 11 am so matter-of fact/ she said, as if accus ing herself of a fault. 41 care so much 'more for realities than for all thia kind of thing, as I just said, r would ©are do good to the poor, to help the sorrowful, to nurse the sick—anything of that kind—bo; muoh^ more than to write poetry or even Inspire it l' t; ^ . . .* You might still be practical, yet inspire the poet; and with one of his loftiest thetaea 1* an swered Valentine, :wartnly r 'The - gracious Ladyes of the past—the sweet chatelaines who walked in their gardens and sat in their bowers, bore also the castle keys at their girdles, wero .servers of bread, and 'leeches in their degree ' .ThejLadye of La Garaye was the LadyBauoti-' ful of whom you paint the outlines so delichtely, ao deliriously/ * : - . - . ' . ' But I do not think X should ever care to inspire a poet stall/ persisted Stella 1A man ought to lead amuoh freer and healthier, more out- of-doora and practical life than poets and artisU can do. ' To me, health and strength and energy are snch grand things 1' , * In man perhaps, not in woman/ said Valen tine, entangled ~in"hia~sentimental "craze for' .want of hmmatineand.forrelaxed-fihre.^ 'A woman should. ,beja' daisty, tender,"delicate creature, all soul and spirit—a. low-voiced, Sweet-faced, fragile saint, to be taken care of by her hnsband to whom she should be at once his Egrria and bis charge—her pure counsels bis fount of inspiration and the guidasoe of his life,- while his strength gives her service and protection.* Stella looked at her .' companion with frank surprise, bhe forgot even the' thirty* Trident, .at which she had been so delicately'working, and which, was one of the great prises; of their odd little game. ' Yon say all this ? she said. ' I thought you oared only for fun and gaiety, and that what you liked best in woman was good humour and high spirits and all that kind of thing—girls who; could walk and ride and row, and were never tired and' never sad, and whose whole lives were just like so maeh dance music/ . '.No! a thousand times no 1' answered Valen tine, with strange energy. 4 Women of that kind are good to laugh with, X grant They are first-rate fun and capital fellows all through; but the supreme to idealise and idolise is of a very different type. My ideal would be & girl, pale, slender, geotie, fair, reminding one of a lily that had been a little bowed nnder the weight of a passing storm; of a blush-rose sur charged with the tears of the.morning; of a saintly martyr floating in a still lake, her hair spread out like an aureole about her; of all thing* tender aiid soft and plaintive,.to whom I should minister—she demanding care because of ber sublime weakness, and I, strong and reverent, proud to(give her on my knees the service of my life. That is my ideal woman; and I would give Her your foho 'and features/ .. 'Would you?' said Stella' with the most simple, the most sincere amazement. 4 How oddi : Nothing being farther from her thoughts tban;loving, nothing was farther from her per ceptions than being made love to. And if any one bad told., her that this was Valentine Cowley's method of making love she would have thought her informant was dreaming or perhaps wilfully trying to deceive her. (To be continued.)
