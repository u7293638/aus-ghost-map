It was re cently attended with deplorable consequences in a little village in Holland, the 41 ghost" paying for his stupid freak with his life. Villagers are frequently inolined to be super* stitious, and a report spreading in the locality that a cortain unoccupied house was haunted it was implicitly believed. The phantom made its appearanoe at regular hours, and on regular days in the week, these visits, of course, being accompanied by unearthly uoises and all manner of super natural, and mysterious occurrences. Few people dared to approach the house whilst the ghost was supposed to bo in it; but ultimately a courageous peasaut WEB found who consented to Leard the lion in his den that is to sayt the phantom in his haunt and, despite the supposed impalpable nature of the beings he was going to face, he armed himself ^with pistols and knives for the en counter. The foolish fellow who had acted the ghost was oaught in the house, and so sonndly. beaten and ill-used by the sturdy peasant^ despite hi*_prayer for meroy, that he was oonveyedhome in an unconscious condition, and B'ucoumbed to his injuries a few days afterwards.
