JOHNSTONE RIVER DEPUTATION. TOTIll I DI I Oil OF till miHllVNh count Sir-in your issue of yesterday is an account of a visit to the Minister for Works by a di privation of gentlemen " enter rested in the Johnstone Kim lite utter races of that deputation require a few friendly comments, especially as the subject discussed is a very important one to some thousands of people in the North Mr Allan, MLA, led off with the information that the deputation were of opinion that the mi tural outlet for the He I beg ton district was the Johnstone River and Morn ill in Harbour " Of course the deputation thought so, but then opinions mc governed by the fact that every member of the deputation is the owner of a selection on the Johnstone Mr Allan had the Icelandic coolness to suggest to Mr Norton that the surveys to"" C runs and Port Douglas might be ignored at (icsCPt, and the survivors devote the whole of their attention to the it way to Morn clean That is, that everything and everybody is to be sacrificed to Mr Allan's deane for 11 uneasy because he happens to have 1280 acres on the shores of Morn in mi harbour He say s the line would tap white extent of sugar country " He talks on a subject he knows nothing whatever about I can tell him that all the sugar come to you the Johnstone is already selected to the foot of the range, and that the railway could touch no new signal count to unless it crossed the low spur on to the Upper Russell, which has nothing to do with the Johnstone There is but a short distance from any point at which a railway would cross the Johnstone to the foot of the range, and all scrub soil beyond that would be on the Herberton table land at an altitude fatal to sugar Mr Nish follows Mr Allan with some additional useless nifor mahon He nails his war flag to the fact that < hustle Pallin is ton gave a full our able report of the Morn ii) in him bom route, but he forgot to mention the arrangement the John stone Board made with Christ le Piilmciston, 01 not be the u rangement made by the chairman and which the majority of the boards predicted, an arrangement who by Ptiluicislon was to receive very substantial induce incuts to pup in a fit and able report Thetis no value of Christie Palmerston s at ports will be discovered in due time Mr Nash said the distances from Herberton were 15 miles to Morn ii) m, 05 to Cm us, and Tito Port Douglas He might at least have supplied himself with correct figures if nothing else The distance to Morn ii) nr is at present entirely unknown to anybody) ; the island distance to Chu ns is either iron 52 miles, and to I'm I Douglas Similes Mr Ryan said a line from Moe loan would open up far more of the tinfields thalia line from nowhere else It is li really necessary) to l cumul Mr Ryan that he has not the of latest (ghost of an idea where the line would go to, and that he cannot possibly know any thing whatever about the subject I he I cm of the Morn and Railway discussion was brought up by our stately friend Dr 0 Dobell), us a sort of invincible gum el or SI ton and intended just to put in conclusiveness it is mc diable finish on the engagement He was in order to atrophine in a knowledge of the fuel tins Clinstic Painuiston went from the Johnstone to Herberton in nine days Dunn Hess and unsophisticated sent it to nil 1 seclusion ' If Palmerston require nine days to travel forty five rubs it only went five miles elms), and consequently must have met with very rough country) indeed Besides we require to know if he sent out from Mourilyan on some consider able distance up the John stone As to Pnbiicistun cutting his way the whole distance through solid scrub, every northern bushman will have his own opinion of that li our ci ci) i iv ei on the north coast there is a main black's track i nursing back over the range on to the tableland behind It is well known there is such a a neck from the Johnstone on to the I let her Ion county), and Ptlincision was just the man to find that truck and put it up In this he would be materially assisted by his black boy If Palmerston were paid to do it, he could start from Can- us and go through to Herberton in four days, and take quite a different route to the load If he travelled during the nine days he was out, he must have traversed at least eighty miles between the Johnstone and Herberton All this foolish ruby between the three ports of Mourilyan, Cairns, and Port Douglas ought to be entirely ignored by the Government. The ut to tude of the Cairns people toward the tins railway has not been always politic, ft 6in want of energy and agita- tion, but it has always been strictly dignified and honourable They have offered no by fees for favourable reports, and called in no extraneous aid whatever, they rely implicitly on the integrity and impartiality of the Government They simply ask for a fair survey of the three proposed routes, and only request that the question be decided purely on its merits They have unbounded confidence that their magnificent harbour and short and easy distance to Herberton will settle the problem to their satisfaction. It was gratifying to see that the intense i bable selfishness of Mr Allan's i request received no sympathy from Mr Norton, and that the Minister intends to pursue the wisest com so-of making all times surveys simultaneously, if possible.' -I am, sir, c, A. MESTON, Chairman Cairns Divisional Board.
