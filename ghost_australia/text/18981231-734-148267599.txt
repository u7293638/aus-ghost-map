Overawed. A celebrated actor was spending his Christmas holidays in the Sunderland district. Being fond of fishing, he de cided to have a day's angling in that well-known stream, the Wear. He had only just commenced operations when he was accoBted by the keeper, who asked him, " by what right he dared to fish in that place." The former, assuming a most tragic attitude, and with a tone full of dignity, replied: " By what right do you say ? "* By that great right the vast and towering mind Has o'er the instinct of the vulgar kind."' The keeper, quite astonished by the imposing tone of this reply, withdrew, saying: " Beg your pardon, sir ; I didn't know that." NEGLECTED. My head is bowed and my tears fall fast, The moon is rising, an empty crescent; And I sit with the ghost of aChristmai past For 1 haven't the ghost of a Christ mas present. O Tramp: ' Can you spare the price of a glass of beer, sir V Party Accosted : ' Yea, easily ; and, what's more, I'm just going down the road to get it. G'day !' 0 Life is but a game of chance, Full of ups and downs ; Full of dirge and full of dance, Full of smiles and frowns. One day full of gladsome cheer, Next day full of ills ; Christmas comes but once a year, Theu the Christmas bills ! o Why is the centre of a tree like a dog's tail?-Because it is farthest from the bark. The holly or holy-tree is known as " Christ's thorn " in Germany and Scan dinavia.
