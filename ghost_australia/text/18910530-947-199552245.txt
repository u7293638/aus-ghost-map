NOTES. 856\. Friends. Arc thore^ such things, now;?- Of-course ?there are, I shall bearit answered. Bub then there are friends ; arid friends, and I ?very much question: whether.- the friends of to-day are as tho friends' of, :by;goiie years; Like many other things which-i have dis appeared before the march of these go nhond-Hiivs. the old fauhioned friendship. which nothing but death could sever, has now become a rarity and an exception. Yet after all' ' it .is not strango that this should be so'i'ouriives'' are- riow-a-daya so lived in public ; there are so many and -varied duties which .occupy our time, .that imt little is left : even for home,-; much lejs !the cultivation of, friendship.; And it is here that the difference!-, pf friendship come iin; to call a. mere passing :, acquaintance, othe caller; for the. day or an, hour, a friend, is an abuse of the term. / -To,;be a friend, , .Vi.realfriend.'is not the; work of a day nor of a year: Friendship: needs, cultivation, ? a similarity of occupation, a community ;of ! ?ideas. - We all have read or heard in one way or ; the . other, how true, the fact con- , .tainediaiDryden'sline i3rf; . , ; ;.;? ; .'/?Want gives, to, know.the. flatterer from the h (, .friend.'- ?..? -,. ,--,n .-.; .jf.ii ?. ?-(.? . . .-. , 'Thei moral of-, old .

Christians, who allow their ladies to move freely in society] Elsewhere well-bred women are1 shut up in zenanas '.and haremBj and.' no foreigner ever sees; them. But' ho sees and can admire Parsee ladies, who are noted for their' good looks and graceful manners^and dress with admirable taste. They are now coming forward to display their cleverness as well as their beauty. Miss ' Sorabji has taken her degree in the Bombay, University', her name appearing in the first class. 'One or two Bengalee ladies have taken degrees at. the Calcutta University; 'and, the Mahratta lady Pundita Rama Bai has* won distinction . as a Sanscrit scholar. ' .Miss , Sorabji, however, appears to ;be the only! lady Bachelor of Arts ? in ' the , western presidency! As an undergraduate she ; distinguished herself by ; winning : the .
