___________THE NEW MANURE. _____To the Editor of the Bristol Mirror. __SIR, — I avail myself of the earliest possi- ble opportunity to communicate to the pub- lic, and more especially from the members and friends of the Bristol Philosophical In- stitution, those precise details which I was very unexpectedly requested not to divulge, on the day I undertook to describe the prin- ciples of Mr. Daniel's manure, in contribu- ting to the " Promotion of Vegetable Growth." This request was made to me after the adver- tisements for the lecture had appeared, in consequence of an unexpected delay in refe- rence to the foreign patents. __The general principles under which the manure would be beneficial to vegetable growth were then fully canvassed, and it was stated that the materials of combustion were used otherwise than by combustion to attain this end. __What I have now to supply, is simply to name the materials of combustion used for this purpose. They are as under :— ____1st. — Wood of every description ; ligneous matter is reduced to a powder by mechanical means, and forms the basis of the manure. ____2nd. — Bituminous matter of every kind is used, either in a powdered state or rendered soluble by caustic alkalis, and is then applied in various, ways to saturate thoroughly the powdered wood. ____3rd. — Soda and quick lime are both put in requisition in forming the composition. ____4th. — Sulphur also forms an ingredient to a small extent, in the composition to form the manure. ____These, Sir, are the substances which have been compounded for the furtherance of those results which have attracted, and have been entitled to, so large a portion of public at- tention. __The principles upon which the idea rests, are as simple and philosophical as the appli- cation of them can be extensively applied. __May it contribute most beneficially to in- crease the resources of our country. — Yours, ____________GEORGE WEBB HALL. __THE BIBLE.— Take from this wonderful book its divine origin and religious character, and it is still, in respect of curious information, attractive amuse- ment, beneficial instruction, genius, and talent, un- rivalled in the whole range of literature. Looked at merely as a literary work, with reference to all the attributes of literary excellence, no other book in any tongue, can enter into comparison with it. Paradise Lost is called the first poem in our lan- guage ; and yet what is it, as poetry, compared with various parts of the Old Testament ? Which of our writers could have written the Psalms, the Book of Job, that of Isaiah, or even Ecclcsiasticus ? Were we to assume the four Gospels to be ficti- tious, no other could be named capable of wri- ting them. After reading all men of the first ge- nius arid acquirements have written, we still find the finest specimens of varied originality, power- ful description, beautiful narrative, profound wis- dom, simplicity, pathos, and sublimity, lofty po- etry, and overflowing eloquence, in the Bible. It never would have stood its ground as it has done, had it not been for its transcendant and inimitable beauties as a literary compositon.— Blackwood's Magazine. __DISTRESSING SUICIDE OF THE EARL OF MUN- STER.— It is our painful duty this day to record the melancholy suicide of the Earl of Minister, son of his late Majesty William IV. This distres- sing event took place last night at half-pust seven o'clock, at the new residence of the late Earl, No. 13, Eaton-square, Pimlico. His lordship retired to his bed-room shortly after eleven o'clock, and soon afterwards the inmates of the house were alarmed on hearing a great noise proceed from that direction. It was immediately discovered that the noble earl had committed suicide. We hear that he placed the end of a pistol-barrel in his mouth, and, so effectual was the discharge, that he died almost instantaneously. Several reports of the details are in circulation, but, as the inquest will be held this evening af seven o'clock, we re- frain from noticing them. We may, however, re- mark that the unfortunate nobleman has left be- hind him a young family of six children to deplore his loss, and that he had only taken possession of his late residence in Eaton-square five weeks ; since which time he hail been in a very low and desponding state of mind. His lordship was created Earl Munster in 1831 ; he married the daughter of the third Earl of Egremont. Second title Viscount Fitzclarence, a Colonel in the Army, Governor of Windsor Castle, Aide-cle-Camp to the Queen, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, and Colonel of the 1st Regiment of Tower Hamlets Militia. He was also a Privy Councillor, and F.H.S. The late Earl was in his 48th year, having been born in 1794\. The above distressing intelligence was for- warded at an early hour this morning to the mem- bers of the Royal Family.— Standard of Monday, March 20. __ALTERATIONS OF THE TARIFF. — Every day we hear of new cases of injury likely to result from the alteration of the Tariff. In the insignificant branch of industry, corkcutting, it is believed that not less than fourteen thousand persons will be thrown out of bread, directly or indirectly, through the reduction of duty on manufactured corks. The admission of wrought spelter at the same rate of duty as that on the rough metal, will annihilate this branch of manufacture. — Globe. __GHOSTS. — One argument to prove that the com- mon relations of ghosts and spirits arE generally false, may be drawn from the opinion held, that spirits arE never seen by more than one person at a time ; that is to say, it seldom happens to above one person in a company to be possessed with any high degree of spleen or melancholy. __REMARKABLE CURE. — Mr. Robert Whitta- ker, in Wyersdale, has a young cow which had a complaint, called " the turn in the head," which causes the animal, when it at- tempts to move forward, to move continually round. The cause of this disorder is a small bladder which grows beside the brain, and becomes full of water Mr. Whittaker knowing that the only way to save the ani- mal would be to take away the bladder, which is a most difficult operation, on ac- count of its proximity to the brain, he made an opening into the scalp, cut out the blad- der, sewed up the opening, and now the ani- mal is as healthy as any of his stock. — Lan- caster Gazette. __YEAST MANURE.— It is not generally known that yeast is one of the most power- ful manures in existence. Some experi- ments have been tried with grass plots and different culinary vegetables, from which it appears that a small quantity of yeast, after it has become putrid and useless to the brewer or baker, will effect wonders when mixed with water and applied to plants as liquid manure. __Small sheep are most profitable, even on an average land, as a small sheep will fre- quently live and fatten where a large sheep would starve. A shorter bite will serve them, and thus the most is made of the herbage. Large sheep generally require rich land and a full bite, and are probably on such lands most profitable. __OLD NICK. — This term now so common, and al- ways applied to his Satanic Majesty, was in its origin meant for Nicholas Machiavel, whose name is now used to express dark, designing, and tyran- nical policy. __A PRETTY RIDDLE. — " I will consent to all you desire," said a young female to her lover, " on condition that you give me what you have not— what you never can have, and yet what you can give me." What did she ask him for ? A husband.
