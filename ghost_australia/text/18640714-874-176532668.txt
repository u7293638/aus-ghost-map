Acclimatization Society v. Melbourne Sunt. MR. PUNCH, â€”Such opportunity as is now left to me of communicating with the world of your readers, I adopt to vindicate my memory front the stain which the complainants in the above case would cast upon me by saying I did not die a natural and proper death. I maintain that I have accomplished the pin-pose for which I was some years ago shipped to this colony, which few colonists can boast. I was intended for sport; I provided sport; and in the cause of sport, at the hands of sportsmen, I became qualified to serve at the table of some of the best fellows in the country. My race are not in the habit of grumbling at their fate, whenever it overtakes them, and I must say I would rather that the males of my immediate posterity, when their turn shall come, and their natural powers shall yield to the skill and perseverence of the hunter, shall supply the best dish at the tables of the Melbourne Hunt Club, than that they shall be compelled to associate with pickled wombat, soup of snakes' legs, pie of black swan's giblets, curry of eagle hawk, roast 'possum, ragout of lizard, and the other nastinesses served up to people, who I believe before dinner, and by way-of an appetiser, as an Englishman eats oysters, swallows an indefinite number of fat juicy-grubs. I remember with pride the glorious chorus "This day a stag must die," aud I do not regret that T am now only, THE GHOST OF THAT DEER.
