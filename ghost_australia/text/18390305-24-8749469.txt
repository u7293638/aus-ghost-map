We now come to the other reason, the forthcoming action at law) for" so gross a libel as ever was penned. Cunningly does the scribe omit the insertion of the worst and most venomous portion of the Libel Letter, and, merely quotes a passage, bad and wicked enough, in itself, but not so outrageous as the omitted portion. The writer, then proceeds, in a strain of attempted humour, to endeavour to palliate the offence which has been committed and which has called for the interposition of justice in order, when the that comes on that this interposition may be pleaded in extenuation! This, he knows is the object of the Article ; because, having retained the Attorney-General, advice to this effect has been promptly afforded. " Don't aggravate the libel ; but smooth it down : say, like a good and penitent boy, that you are sorry; and that you did not mean what you: wrote. Be sure to say this, and, it will go far, With an intelligent Jury to award trifling damages." Now, here is a specimen of this " smoothing down.' ' " We have yet to know, that a paper, whose columns are open to the refutation of un- truths (poor Vottrier JJ in inserting a letter of an indiscriminate (?) correspondent, identifies itself with the particular views, tenets, or prejudices, which that correspondent may think it right to expose." Certainly not; but why not say so, at first? This is, indeed, a feast miserable quibble and evasion badly expressed, to boot, and not at all credible. But here is more of the same twaddle. In allusion to the True Colonist, the Recanter thus delivered himself "In looking over the True Colonist some time since, we saw an attack levelled against the Counter, as advocating all those principles of intolerance, in which we before alluded, (The stained offspring affair J. We concluded, for we had not heard it !
