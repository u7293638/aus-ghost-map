FOR THOSE WHO FAIL. All honor to him who shall win the prize, The world lias cried for a thousand years; But to him who tries, and who fails and dies, I give great honor, and glory, and tears. Give glory andhonor, and pitiful tears To all who fail in their deeds sublime ; Their ghosts are'many in the van of years; They were borne with time in advance of time. Oh, great is the hero who. wins, a name; But greater many and many a time. Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame, And lets God finish the . thought sublime. â€”Toaquin Miller.
