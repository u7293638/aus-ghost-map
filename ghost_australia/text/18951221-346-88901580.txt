CHAPTER TTTI. Ir: Geihsha-w Waíts His Moítt. ; Nearly two years hsd-passed since Conrad's departure. His daughter. was nineteen rao'aths'oM, and the same'period had elapsed since the loss of the Dunbar. So far as .was known ncxie of her passengers or crew had escaped the mysterious fate which had over taken-the vessel, Then the following para graph 'appeared in one of the daily papers ::— :' Many will, no doubt, remember. the mysterious-disappearaiicá' of the Dunbar, which wa3 lost about, two years ago on the j outward Voyage from tbe London Docks to j Sydney. This week, for the first time, news has been received of the fate of this un fortunate vessel. After a number of most romantic adventures some members of the crew, including two gentleman passengers and a lady and her daughter, have at last succeeded in making their way to Sydney, and have sent home seme particulars con cerning the fate of this unfortunate vessel and their own escape. By this it would appear that the Dunbar, having been driven' considerably out of her coarte, came into colli;ion with an iceberg somewhere in the rjs.'shborhood of -Kerguelen land. She sank almost immediately, the crew taking to the" only two boats which remained, the others having been destroyed by the storm or the berg.: The women, all but the two who have been saved, were placed in one boat of which no news has been received, and which may,' thertfore, safely be supposed to have foundered. The other boat, containing four ! teen men: and two ladies, succeeded inieach ! ing Kerguelen, where the islanders treated j them with great hospitality, and whence they were transferred to the first ship that called at the Islands, and conveyed, after much J delay, to their destination in Australia. The remainder of the crew, including the captain, perished with the ill-fated vessel. She was seen to go down, but no help could be rendered. Of the cifew of the rescued boat, two 'sailors and two gcHtlemen passengers .succumbed to the privation and the exposure of the voyage; two sailors elected to remain on the Island;.and the remainder, includ ing the ladies and gentlemen aforementioned, reached Sydney in safety, baying been nearly 1 two years cn the road. Strir.ge ts say, the younger lady, Miss. Rsinbird, who W&3 Kufferiug from consumption and supposed to be in a very bad state of health when she left England, has improved ao much in health in spite of a!i her privations that she has no~ quite recovered.' The account ended with a list of the names of those who had been saved. That of Con rad Hardcastle was nor, among them. With thi3 paper in bis hand Ashwyn called on Eulalie. ' Have you seen this account in the " Daily News,'' he said, offering it to her.' 'No,' she replied; and having read it, looked quickly up. ' You see it is as I told J you. The Dunbar was wrecked by an ice berg, and the people escaped in tiro boats.1 ' But only one of the boats has been saved.' ' How do you know that 1 A week ago you thought that neither of them would ever again be heard of, and now wo have this news. Iam certain Mr. Hardcastlij is not dend ; if he were I should know it.' The old man shook his head. 'I wish ho would comeback,' he said, 'the business is getting quite beyond me.' 'Ah!' she cried, anriously, 'is there any new trouble ?' ' Not anything new exactly, but things are going from bad to worse.
