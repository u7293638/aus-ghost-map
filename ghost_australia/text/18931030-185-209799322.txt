BAPTIST CHURCH. There was a crowded congregation at the Baptist Church last night, when the Rev. Dr Porter conducted a baptismal service. During a powerful sermon, based upon the words, “ What must I do to be saved ? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,” Acts xvi., 30 and 31, the preacher exhorted his hearers to rely upon the Word of God instead of listening to the opi nions of men. People who had started, on the path of Christianity often went backwards, because they did not tako the Gospel as their guide. The Holy Ghost would ever be with the students of the Bi'-le, and lead them in the ways of righteousness. The candidates, six of whom were ladies, presented themselves for the right of baptism. As each one was im mersed the choir and congregation joined in singing a verse of the hymn, “Hallelujah, ’ti3 done.”
