PAET I.— OITTINO TH* IKOBKDIBJTTS Ne. 14 Colbrook-street was not a very pleasant looking place, nor were the bouses m it very big. It layinthe poorest part of the town/ and the streets' were full of ragged children,.%^and untidy-looking men; and women. There were no grand shops, no c'arriacres, no fashionably-dressed ladies, on the contrary the shops were dirty and miserable, and there was nothing in their, windows which would be at all likely to, tempt people inside. Nevertheless, when the door of No. 14 opened and two children' came down the broken steps,- they stopped; at the various shop-windows and peered' through the smeary glasB at their uninvit-: ing contents. ? ' We oan never manage it Bertie,' said the elder of- the two,- ' I'm sure we can't, so we might- juBt as well go home again., We shall only get durieet wet and then we shan't be allowed to; come out to-morrow.'

Bertie hurried out of the shop, and catching hold of Lizzie by the arm, began to haul her along as fast as he could, while he explained to her that be had got a job which would bring him in a shilling at the very least. He did not listen to any of her remonstrances, but telling her to ex plain to his mother that lie had gone on an errand for one of his employer's customers; he left her on the doorstep of their dingy home and boltedoff back to Mr Jones's as fast aa his legs could carry his. PAET II.— MIXINO THI rUDDIHO. Bertia was wonderfully quick in carry ing out hia orders. He did not lose any time ' in ' looking for a cab in that unlikely neighbourhood, but lie ran from street to street.up and down short cuts known to him of old, until he came to a more respectable quarter of the town, whore there were plenty of cabs and omnibuses passing to and fro. Bertie hailed the first empty cab heeaw. The cabman drew up near- the pavement. ?- .'-..-. ' Well, young 'un, what d'ye want P' Bertie told the tman, and1 showed him the order,' though he 'kept 'tight hold of it, for f ear of acoidents. ; ., ?

'; ' ;: ; 1 The- hotel mentioned on the slip of paper1 was soon reached, and Bertie at once pre-1 sented it to the first waiter he saw. That; -functionary glanced at it, but seemed dis posed to take no further notice. The boy: waited for a moment or two, and then seeing that no one seemed inolined to pay any attention t* him, he returned to the door and held a consultation with, the cabby, the result of which, was that while Bertie stayed outside' and minded the horse, the cabman entered the hotel 'and at once presented the order at the office. The young'woraan looked at it and then .rang r the bell.' The boots of the establish ment soon made hiB appearance. : ?' : ; .??'?

The boots disappeared and presently re turned from upstairs with one- of ?' the boxes, which -he placed with the cabby's assistance inside the cab and then-returned for 'the 'other. ;;-Wtien!' that- was safely placed besides its companion, Bertie gave Mr Jones's: address to the cabman' and they started off leaving the boots- looking- some- what : disgusted, for he had fully 'expected a-1 tip.'-,- ? ?' ? ' '- ' ?? ?? ': ?'.????' ,, The cab rattled on, and Bertie kept a watchful' eye on the two boxes and' could not help wondering what they' contained. They- were1 ' iciirious !')looking boxes and bore .the' marks of having travelled through many lands. . However, his chief anxiety. now was tp receive' ?? his promised reward, and he was not pprr'yto notice that the cab was fast .approaching the part of the towniin whicb'Mr Jones dwelt. More than once'.the cabman istopped to ask him theway,asthe by-street in which was the curiosity-dealer's.- shop ^was unknown''to him.

There' was a long wrangle between the1 'cabman -and- the dealer:pver ? .the fare,' and: it ended in the cabman driving off grumbling and calling Mr -?

Good night; sir,' and thank' you,', said Bertie: merrily as he.felt the coveted coin within the. envelope placed in his hand. ' \- .'.Grbodi night,' gruffly- responded:' his master, 'and mind you're not late on Mon day morning.' ? As soon. as Bertie -got away from the shop, he opened the envelope to extract the coin, when, tp his utter amazement, he saw net a shilling but a' gplden sovereign; His first impulse was: to return to Mr Jones and 'tell- him of the mistake, which he thought had 'b'eesi- made in the darkness of ? theshop; 'Before doing so he looked into the envelope and taking out the slip of paper w'ent 'to thenearest lamp-post and: read : what was ? on it: 'There were only a few-words — ' Spend as much of tlie enclosed as' you. want, arid' call at the Boyal Arms to-morrow morning' early.' .Tbat'.waB all; but it waB enough tp make Bertie'pull his' cap tightly dewn upon his head and set off as hard as: he could, run towards 'No. 14, Colbrook-street.' His impatient thump at thedoor wa« answered by Lizzie. .. '... ,, 'Hush, Bertie,, mother's ill. Don't make a noise; she is lying down. She has had a great fright.' ,,'..' '. '..'' .'. Bertie repreased hie excitement as far as he could, and went quietly into the poorly furnished sitting room in which, his mother, wa« resting. -' , ' ].':,' ' :.' .. 'Well, my ion, where have yowbe«nP I was beginning to feel aasiona about you.' . ? Oh, I'm all right, mother, and mother, what do you think}; I have got a sovereign — a whole sovereign. Won't we' be able to have a jolly Christmas aft* r all P'. ????'' ? What do you mean, Bertie t howeret did you get it? I hope you, have done nothing wrong.* . . : ? Bertie then entered into as full an ex planation of his adventures aB his excited feelings would allow him, and when. he had finished he asked his mother whether he and Lizzie could not go' out and buy. tho necessary things for the wished for but little expected Christmas dinner. Mrs Lombard hesitated a little before she. gave her consent to the money being expended, but at last she said that they might go, but. she seemed so nervous and so upset that Lizzie whispered to Bertie that she ought not to be left, and that he had better go arid get the things himself. This Bertie was not at all anxious .to do; he knew very little about shopping, and the few purchases they made wore always made by his mother; bo somewhat ? disap pointed he said that if Lizzie would go be would stay at home. Lizzie seemed to hesitate, but Mrs Lombard told her to go and not be away any longer than she could help.- She told her what to get, and at Bertie's special request one or two addi tions were made to the liBt of purchases.' When Lizzie had put on her. hat ' and shawl and hud gone, the .boy asked hia mother what had happened to upset her. ' Ioannot tell you, my boy, I don't know exactly myself.; but just as I had got nearly home I saw a face, just like a face I knew years ago, and U gave me a great turn ;. it was just like seeing a ghost.' 'Who was it, mother ?' - .-?: . ?.'?.' . f ?I can't tell you, Bertie,' repeated -his mother, 'it upset me at the time, but I feel a bit better now; ?

You stop where you are.' . . ? - ? . - - ; . ; '?Bertie bustled about,, and . by; the time Lizzie returned with her basket the kettle was boiled and the tea. made. But before they sat down he insisted on emptying the basket and inspecting the contents. ? There they were, juBt the very things. he and Lizzie had bo often talked - about, not one of them missing. The anticipation of the coming treat . was almost as : good as the pudding itself. . ?. . .: . ? ??;. : , i, /PAST .III.— THE BATING.- .., As soon as Mrs Lombard had recovered from her fatigue and fright, she yielded to her children's impatience, and the few tea things having been wasaed up and put tidily away, the mother and the two chil dren sat .down to atone the raisins, and make the ; other preparations for the next day. :??? ,.i ? ;:?. / i ..:? -.. : ? .,?; ,. ,.-; -? ..' airs Lombard was unusually, grave and' thoughtful; her children who were very happy, glanced at her- novtjrtj timas and then at each other.: :. ,; : i . ? ;. . ? ?

Afteriny. father's death we : were married and had a' very happy life until you;Bertie, were just twp years old; andtheri'an awful' thing happened. ?

Then ; perhaps, yon will do the same, eaid the tall man smiling. (;.On«vlook at their mother's face convinced the tchildren that; she was quite happy, and that any suspicion she might have .had about her huBband'a innocence had been removed. They -were shy at first; but in a few minhWajthey were quite at their ease, arid before long Lizzie found herself sitting on her 'long-lost father's knees as if she had known him always. , -5 My dear,' said Mr Lombard, 'we'll all go to church together and thank God for our happy re-union.' :?' 'But what about the pudding P' Bertie ventured to ask. -'That will be all right, I have arranged , everything so that you can go, my son, with an easy mind.' .- WhBn fche time came, the father and mother and their children were among the Worshippers at the Christmas service, and the words 'Peace on earth, goodwill towards men,' seemed to have a deeper meaning to all of them than ever they had had before. ? When the service was over and they had returned home, Bertie, though he did not say much, was greatly concerned about the , long looked for Christmas fare, and he was ' much, puzzled to notice that his mother, beyond laying the table with unusual care, made no other preparation. His anxiety was, however, not of long duration, as a knock came to the door, and on opening it he found two men bearing two covered trays, from which there issued an unmis takable odour of good things. The men ?were dismissed and ihe trays unpacked, when they revealed piles of undreamt of ? dainties, sufficient, as Bertie somewhat rashly remarked, for the whole street. 1 The four sat down to their Christmas dinner at last, and it was surprising how soon the ohildren forgot that they had only known their father for an hour or two. They were very merry and happy, and the time passed quickly by. Amd now, ohildren, as your mother told you last night the beginning of my story, it'iB only right that you should hear the end of it. When I left the office that. ' morning after the discovery of the robbery, I only intended to be away a fetv minutes. I at once suspected one of the junior clerks, young Jones, and knowing that he had a : young wife who was very ill, I went to see if I could find him and prevent her having a shock. I did find him at home, and he confessed to me his guilt. I promised to keep his secret if he would solemnly swear to lead a better life, and then left his home to return to the office, but I never got there. I was knocked down by a passing cab and received concussion of the brain. When I recovered my senses, I found myself in a hospital where I had been lying for some weeks , in- an almost unconscious state. Before I was able to leave there I learnt that Jones had, been seized before he was able to make his escape.and finding that I :'.) did riot turn .up,' he had thrown all the guilt upon my shoulders. I should certainly Save gone straight to the office and faced the' matter outtheri and there.but when I re turned home and found that' your mother hid disappeared with you, 'leaving no trace whatever'' of 'your whereabouts, I let the n»ttei go, and after some time left the town and 'wentfrom, place to place seareh ifigfO^ybur mother until' 'at last 'finding my''' search -.In'selesa/' 'I ! \ went/ to Aus tlcalia'i' -where ^I vrem'ainRd! until'. 'about : two months ago. My reason for leaving there' and1 coming home was 'that I chanced to 'fall in once more k with Jones, the'eause- of all my trouble, but he; poor fellow, was dying,; dying from the effebts of'drink and dissipation. -What he'told- me induced me' to at 'once leave therei'and I have lost no time in making, my way here. Old Jones, in whose place Bertie saw 'me yesterday, ? was the father of ray guilty fellow-clerk, and I went to him in con sequence of what his .son told me: It seems that the son told his father before he, left the : country that he was the guilty party, and begged, him to do .what be could for. yourTtnother and you. . It does not seem as If he has done very muchibut, at any rate, he has been the means of bringing 'us ;together once more.' '' ' . . . ! '?' And 'you were .innocent ' all the time/, said' Bertie, with a glowing face. 'Do you need to ask that question, idy boy,' said Mr Lombard, 'poor Jones wrote out; a full confes&ibh; of his guilt '.before he idied, and those'bores you brought in the cab yesterday were '.Borne things he/had asked me to give to his father.
