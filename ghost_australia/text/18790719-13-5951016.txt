"We may fairly assume after the recent diXate that tho Assembly is soued ot tho lact that a largo propoition of the selectois aro iii gi cat difficulties, and that then troubles aie aggravated by Mi LoNGMOiir's legulations Mr BLRRY complains that tho Opposition has not taken the tioublo to prove the existence of tho distress, 'which is a matter of common notoriety, and ho thinks that the discussion that has taken placo "will go a great uay " to steady tho country and to " show that the reckless charges which " have been made against tho Govern " ment aie not behoved ni " by those who make them " Now, in the first place, if there had been any necessity of proung facts which lud been established by incontestable evi dence, what obligation tested on the Opposition to undertake tho task when it was being done so effectually by Ministerial supporters who could not he taunted with ulterior designs 1 Would it not ha\ e been a tactical eiroi on tho part of Mi SERVICE and his friends to lia^ e wasted then: forces over an opeia tion that was being carried out foi tliein by the enemy 1 As to Mr BLRRVS belief concerning the eftect of the do bate, of course the bon gentleman eau pretend to behov e what he pleases But belief, 110 matter what may be ita nature or intensity, cannot alter facts, and nothing that has been said m the House-no ossuranco, no conviction, no argument-will mako straggling selectors, some of whom are living lues of penury through their inability to command assistance, think that they are not undergoing haidship for which Mr LONGMORE IS partly ro sponsible The Premiei's remarks, therefore, concerning the silence of tlio Opposition aie childish lacts aie not dispnn ed by the omission of any party to bupport them, and in tlus matonea the positive testimony borne to the evil results of Mr Lo\ CHORE'S meddling was complete without a word from the eentlemen on the left of the Speaker Immediately after making this nth culous attempt to disprove facts by the simple piocess of assuming that they could not exist if they were not allegel by ceitam people, Mi BERRY went on to admit, m his usual inconsistent way, that the distress complained of w as any thing but imaginary Ile said that ho did not suppose that " any one could " issue regulations undei which thero " might not be individual casas of hard " ship " Seeing that the Commissioner of Lands had said that ho was aware of ?widely spread embarrassment amongst his tenants, tlie Premier could not, op coiirse^voidcoutradictmghwualf'^^kQ had madère false stait ^dt he C0I1tends, if we understand '^ argument aright, tUat these '^dividual cases of hardship, winch in the aggregate make up an appalling sum of suffering, bhould not command tho sympathy of the House, because " a cry has been raised about " them in Opposition journals for poli "l:*\ purposes"" We ask the par ticular attention of those who' aie groan ing under the tyranny of the Lan 3 d® partaient to the position hero asaiimeu by the Premier It amounts to this - " No grievance should be entei tamed " oi redressed by faithful followers of " my Mimstiy that has been exposed " or commented upon by Oppoai "tion journals \ou (my adheicnts) " should be guided m your actions " not by a regaid foi justice, " oi the inteiests of j oui cousti " tuents, but solely by considetition " foi the convenience and safety of the "Government In every hostile uttqr, " ance legaiding oui administiativo'j J " you bliould recognise political totnes' " and refuse absolutely to entf¡ÚOi^ "tho comphints lloierred, nrespectivo " nltogêti °l of tlieu merits If you ict " otherwise you l)la"e }ourselves in the "position of Mi AiuNIso, who ven " tared to diffei from us o °° aild ]la3 ' *li«efoio beennghteouslycalnn, J*1*8* "evei «mee by our wirepullers ana " toadies, and 5ou play 'into the hand» " ' of an unsciunulous Onnositi m " 'which is simply biding its time to "'have a blow at tho Government "Ne think that what vie hate said faitly lepiesents the contention of the Piemier m this mattei lo put the aifcuineiifc shortlv, he aiguës that the fust duty of i epi esentatn es is to then pat tv, and then second to then constituents, 01 the countij at lai go W e do not think, how ever, that thu is a nile of political action which will meet with the approval of tho public Hie theoij, we submit, which commends itself to theelectois is "party foi public "puiposes, not "paity for party's " sal e As to the idea that members should always rally to a paity call, when the Opposition has pointed out and condemned Ministenal blunders, it is not only immoial, but a complete nega tion of the pnnciplo which underlies lesponsiblo government What is tho object of having so called responsible government? Suiely it is not to mako men in ofiice piactically îriesponsible to tell thom that they may do as they please and fear no consequences so long as they profess to hold certain v lews on a few abstract questions, and continuo to exercise the powers of pationage at then disposal foi the benefit of their suppoiters No, the objects which responsibility is intended to secure are the happiness and well being of tho governed It seeks to attain theso things by enabling the people to got rid < f iti-ii vho abuse ot misuse tho prerogatives enti usted to them, and its intentions would be entirely frustrated if Mr BLRRY'S code of political ethics w ere generally accepted The success ful working of respotisibl government depends entirely on the existence of i number of independent membeis, who _no matter on which sido thoy may sit -will Bupport nghteous act3 of ad ministration, and fearlessly condemn improper proceedings without regard to consequences If tho piinciplo wero once establish«** that party allegiance necessitated unquestioning adhcience to a COT eminent, no mattei how conupt or injurious to tho public wolf ne, tho continued existence of responsible rulo w ould bo as brief as it would be in «lonous It would be swept away as a thing which was oii0inally intended to deliver the peoplo fioni oppicssion, and to give them e\ cry advantage that could possibly be made to flow nom a conscion tious discharge of administrative duties, but which had been conveited by do signing men into machmoiy for pi omot mg peisonal interests, apait from and regardless of the rights or tho welfaio of those* hving under it We think that if Mr BERRY; "rallies the party" very frequently in tho way ho succeeded in domg on Thursday 1 ist, he will succeed Jieforo long m "i ally ing" it out of oflice, amidst loud expressions of general disappiobation and disgust Theio is ono moro point connected with this matter to which we would direct attention Mr BLRRY and his follow ers aro very fond of attributing unsciupulousness to tho Opposition membeis, supporters, and press Whether they do it on the principle adopted by the man who cried " stop thief " lustily VÍ hilo making off with stolen goods, or whether they like to roll the word m their mouths apart from its meaning, wo cannot say We submit, however, that the charge is absurd Tor instance, Mr. BURRY alluded during the recent ¿1 chato to an unscrupulous Opposition f bidmg its time to have a blow f at tho Government " Now, what is thero unscrupulous in its attitude? "Every opposition is biding it3 time with a similar object in view It has in fact aio othei i aiton d'the It is bound m honour and conscience to endeavour to give effect to its principles, and the only is ay to do this is to eject the possessors of office from their places If, m addi- tion to differing from Governments on matters of political opinion, they hold ¡them to bo incapable, reckless, corrupt, ¡revolutionary, and dangerous, they aro »bound not to leave a stone unturned to supplant them with as little delay as possible To make the attempt is not unscrupulous conduct, but simply the ¡performance of duty We trust that people will ponder over these things, and not allow their judgments to ¡bo led captive by Mi BERRY'S rhetonc JThej may rest assured that when they Lee great practical interesta neglected or [subordinated to the convenience of party, ¿hat íesponsible and parliamentary government is not working as it should do Responsible rulers should seek first lho good of those whose affaira they manage, and make every consideration ¿îeld to this paramount object When ev er a class sees its grievances left with out lcdress, as the selectors do m this Instance, they may be sure that some thing has gone wrong-that effects are ¡being produced which aie not the legiti mate fruits of the principle of responsi Quilty, but the results of selfishness oi ignorance in its application to the con duct of public affairs 'BOSCIIER, ono of -the, ablest of the Gemían economists, wilgee wutmgs are just now attracting a good deal of at ¡tention in the Unjf"ea States, has said ïhat, "just as Luman labour can only *'arrive at complete pioductivity when <=' it is free., so capital does not attain to f< full \ioductive powei except under " the. system of free pnvate property" And this necessitates for its complete «ess, freedom of acquisition, freedom of Jiequest, freedom to encumber, and free dom to convey it All these we enjoy ïn this colony, and it is a signifi ^anl Lue that the yery mun who «?am imposed limitations on t^S freedom of labour m Victona, by acstncting liberty of commerce, are also engaged in "the endeavour to destioy u the svstemof free piIVate piopeity" foy penal taxation on the one hand, and íjy pernicious agririan ie0'tilations on ¡the other Contiast a íetiogiessive ¡pohcj of this kind with the avowed nuns of the most uili0hteiied land íe lormeis in Europe, and jon will at once jpoiceive the incalcul iblc difleience be tween the genuino hbeialism of these, ¡and the pseudo hbeialism of those In Mr KAV b posthumous vvoik, just pub Sished, entitled Ft ee fi ade in Land, to Hvhich Mr Jonv BRICHT has contu fouted a pieface, we have a lucid e\posi \lion of tho true principles which should "** \Lind Jegisi'u* on in a^ civilised «untncs-^nciples whicn »io not ¡merely theoiçtically excellent, but whicn Siave been reduce to practice in moie ¡finn one country in ^urol>e Lh^ Wt-to quote Mi P*T*0T voids-ii. 3lvlng "thatfieedo ""; , "sod winch ujr hw s (te, those.

By penal taxation? By pro claiming laige landowners to bo " public " enemies," and by the adoption of official regulations determining the con ditions under which and the persons of whom money should be borrowed foi the cultivation and improvement of land? Nothing of the kind "The " edict," as Mr KAY tells us, " allows " the owner to give, sell, or devise his " land, or any part of it, to any one he " pleases, but it does not allow him to " tie it up by any instrument, so as to " prevent it being sold aftei lus death " The land is always saleable, it is " always changing hands Some estates " subdivide, some increase m sue, and " tho consequence is that while theie is " a consideiable numbei of laige " estates, there aie vast numbers of " yeoman farmers, peasants, and market "gardeners who cultivate their own " land " In a w ord, the Prussian system is the product of sagacious statesmanship, and is populai in character and beneficent in opera tion It was the work, not of political charalatans influenced by a rabid mania against property owners, but of lllustuous patriots like STUN and HARDENBERG, one of whom earned the distinguished honour of being declared an enemy of Trance by N\POU,O\, and of being expelled from the Prussian sei vice by his mandate The edict of 1811 estab lished free trade in land, and Mr KAY shows that this alone suffices to secuie the subdivision of the temtory into small estates, is an efficient safeguard against monopoly, ancl çiçatç^ such a conservative ^"^ment m the minds of the rural population that tho socialism which springs to life among the dis contented population of tho gi eat cities finds no foothold m the couiitiy, wheio such incendiary language as that em ployed by Mr LONGJIORL would expose the utterer of it to condign punishment at the hands of the " piopeitied classes, ' that is to say, of the great bulk of the population The dissatisiuctlon.folttat the conÇllt,lon nd doings of the p^lT f,° "" hitherto been oxpressea and doings of tlie Pi>e f,orco whlch }un hitherto been oxpressea .m an f*01' nnttent way must bo fast oomii,*'. head, The public is continually hairing of cases whicîi leflect oithei on tho con- duct or tho capacity of tho const.ibulaiy.
