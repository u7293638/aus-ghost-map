Poor Sjpoirt KAn~A oo drives are the fashion now; At every station, where even the ghost of a tripod has been seeoon, it is conu. sidered the proper thing to orgahise a drive, battue, or whatever else it may be called. One was got up the other day by the hospitable owner of Lignum? There were some kangaroos seen about, and to demolish them, he in. vited the neighbours living far and wide. On the day appointed for the " drive," there was an excellent atten. dance. Breeches and boots and kangaroo dogs were as plentiful as snow in the freezing room at Goslie Creek. And after a refresher, a start was made. The dogs were slipped, and this paddock and that one were scoured with an assiduity worthy of even a better cause. But when night fell, and the company met at the home station, scalps and caudal appeondages were scarce. Not a kangaroo had been captured, though one follow swore he saw' a wombat during his hunting. That was enough to whet their appe. tetes for another day's driving. And, on the following morning, they set out, and, at night, when they again met, and reckoned up the sports of the hunt, it was found that one sickly padde. melon had been captured. It is being preserved to present to the young princes as a record of the most extra. ordinary kangaroo drive that ever took place in the colony.-"' Will Honey. comb," in the Dubbo Dispatch.
