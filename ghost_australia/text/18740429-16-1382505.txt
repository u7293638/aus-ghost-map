on Wednesday, the 8th April. The stone was laid by the eldest daughter of Mrs. Brodie, of Wangarah—the oldest native of the distnct—who used these words :—" I lay this as the foundation and corner stone of a church to be built in this place, to be named the 'Church of Saint Andrew the Apostle,' and to be set apart for the preaching of the right Catholic faith, which we believe and confess, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen." Our readers will recollect that the word "Jingera" throughout the length and breadth of the colony was formerly associated with cattle stealing, robbery, and murder.
