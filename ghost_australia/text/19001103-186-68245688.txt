Tueir agreement *jn tile matiter ie? complftc. Bcali ere sincerely anxions to protect tite interests of CcnSral Queensland in this matter, and only tliose like Mr. Ledliy ui;o desire to sef CemtJ^tl Queens land &a-Ti;£c«i, and vfao trish to make mis chief between men politically opposed to tlienKelvos, ivould have exerted themselves as 3ie did. Turning to the debate iJsdf, it showed clearly that the Government had delibe rately gone back on its promise to the Central and Northern divisions over the senatorial seats. Speaking in the Assembly last year of the |*-n-or to divide Queens ].uid for the senatorial elections, Mr. Dick son s.ijd — ^^ I think boa. memliers will agree ' with me that this is a concession to ' Queensland which, considering the great ' extent oi our territory and the various ' interests of ihis colony, will lie a con 'piderablr improvement in the bill.'' That was last year, and now we have Mr. Dick son bringing down this bill in which he deliberately declines to take advantage «f this - considerable improvement.'' Fur ther, we have tiie admission of the Pre mier that the fart, that tlii* oomvssion had been obtained helped very materially to carry the bill in the Xorth, and we all know it wa-i of great assistance in the Centre. The result of making the colony one electorate for the Senate is to place he election of senators wholly in the liands of the South, and practiraHy in Use lumds of a for men in Brisbane An aso* ' fiation presided over bv tht Premier h»« been loimed in Brisbane to 'bring oat can iidatcs of a certain political odour, Bud ? it is signfiiciint that at the 'first meeting ' irhich was hdd to form it Mr. Leahy, «W- :. has since been elected one of the vioepre Bidents, said that a mom to bold twenty people would have been sufficient for their . purpo=e. Following «si the fomatioaxoi this association, another association km been founded, of which 3Jr. Browne will probably be president, la bring out ana- . torial candidates of another colour. Kow . it is quite phlin that the j*™^-™*^ of candidates for the Senate will be Sa th* hands of these two Brisbane associations. Ko man who is Dai ti&en; np l-y one or other will hare a. ghost of a. chance. The Home Secretary said he was quite Eure that both Xorthem and Cental men would be returned to the Senate even if the colony were one electorate. That H very probable, if they are nominated by one or other of these two Brisbane asso ciations, bnt the man who is banned by both these aesodxtioDS may grre op all hope of entering the Senate. The first thing a man'mnst do to eeeoxe election to the Senate will be to captare Jfce asaocu tkm lie desires to run nnder. ff he ftai^ in that, then he is done for, no miter how excellent a candidate he nay be, and if he succeed he win have a. capital dance, let him be ever so poor a. representative.
