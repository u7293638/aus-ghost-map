THE VICTORIA COURSING i CLUB. The members of the Victoria .Cournir.fc Clubs met at the office of the, Club, Collins street west, yesterday afternoon Dr. Fether- stone the vice-president, occupied the chair. The draw for, the V.C.C. Derby and Oaks was proceeded with. The method adopted for the draw was by putting an equal number of numbered balls as there are done in a stake into a " wheel of fortune and drawing for the pairs. The numbers on the balls corresponding with name of the dog at the same number in the secretary's book were read out. Mr. M. Greene was selected to draw the marbles. This plan gave more satisfaction than placing the nomination papers in the box, as they do not mix easily. The meeting will commence to-day in Wallaroo paddock, Diggers nest Station. A special train will leave the Spencer-street Station at a quarter past 8 this morning. The first pair of dogs will be put in the slips at 9 o'clock. The Derby Stakes will be commenced first, and then the first round in the Oaks Stakes will be commenced, and gone as far through as possible. The following are the results of the draw : THE DERRY.
