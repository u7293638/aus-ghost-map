i SOCIAL GOSSIP FROM HOME. (Fkok A London- CoitBKsroNDiNT ) LONDON, May 31. The headquarters of the British army made a gallant show on Queen's Birthday morning at the ancient and picturesque ceremony of the trooping of the colour," It was a tropical morning, and many a fair one swooned in the rushing and crush- ing of the vast concourse of "privileged" ticketholders, who swarmed on the Horse Guards' parade he was not destined to be the only scene of confusion which took place on the same spot during the same day. In the afternoon, Captain Shaw, of the fire brigade, and Colonel Howard Vincent, M P, of the London County Council, had arranged a very neat little ceremony by which they were both to find favour in the eyes of the Prince of Wales, his wife, and children The Princess was to distribute prizes for bravery to the trench, and then the brave array of engines was to march past the Royal party at galloping pace. Unfortunately, Colonel Howard Vincenthodover estimatedbispowers as a military commander. He appears to have contemplated, or, at all events, to have given the police authorities to understand that he contemplated, keeping the crowd in order by means of his own volunteer battalion, the Queen's WeannniBtera. Very smart the Queen's Westminster looked when they arrived on the ground for this purpose. Unfortunately, however, the crowd was there before them, and it was BOGGO strong to their GOO There would have been no earthly possibility of clearing the ground except by volleys of musketry. There was nothing to be done but to stand helplessly looking on whilst the Royal carriage drove straight into the dense masses of humanity. Happily there was no ill-will in the crowd to the Royal party, but the ceremony was a fiasco. It is not certainly known to any but the Royal party themselves whether the ceremony of giving the rewards took place or not. A little later the gallop past was accomplished somehow, the Royal party having succeeded in reaching and entering the Horse Guards' building. But Colonel Howard Vincent was a sight for gods and men to pity. So far from giving his Royal patrons a pleasant diversion, he had nothing but their good nature to trust to for forgiveness, and the attitude of his friends towards him ranged from effusive indignation to good-humoured pity. Colonel Howard Vincent is one of those men whose misfortunes excite a certain feeling which is not wholly displeasing in his friends. He is pushing and blatant and the usual com- ment on the occurrence was, "I'm so glad it was Howard Vincent that it happened to." The two occurrences above described were divided from one another in point of time by a great and glorious ayht in Hyde park-the first meeting of the Four in-hand Club. The coaches, as is their wont, paraded at the top of the Serpentine Lake or river-the place is called the Powder Magazine and, driving along the water to Apsley house and Hyde park corner, doubled round along the drive," which skirts the famous "rule of Rotten Row, and then made their way to Hurlingham at Fulham, where there was polo, or to Richmond, where there is a river called the Thames So much of their way as lay through the Park to Hyde park corner abb on Saturday lined by one hundred thousand pedestrians, seven or eight thousand equestrians the latter drawn up with the precision and repose of a cavalry division and some thousands of densely packed open damages The day was glorious The vegetation fully developed, but in its first freshness, and intensely green It was a sight to make glad the heart so much beauty, such health, such wealth, such spirits such good humour, courtesy, and good breeding Almost every other person on the grass, on horseback, or in a carriage was a person to whom one could put a name, and of whose achievements or surroundings something could be said As to the coaches themselves, they were nothing wonderful the "Tour in hand" in the smart club of our two drag clubs , but the Coaching Club," which is that of those who are hopelessly middle class, "or are, socially speaking, on the make, can show a better turn out of nags and coaches Indeed, as to the 'Tour in hand, the wonder is how some of its members, with modest in comes or huge families-such us Lord Charles Beresford or Lord Londesborough think it justifiable to keep draga at all. But in an old and aristocratic family a four in hand is like an ancestral ghost-the scions of the house cling to it longer than to anything else It is curious to observe the difference of hearing among the owners in the two clubs A member of the " 1 our in hand always ' takes himself for granted, even when driving the defeat of coaches and the wretchedness of screws, and looks every inch a swell A member of the Coaching Club however unexceptionable his turn out and horscllesh-feels and looks not the real thing, and he knows that his sentiments on the subject are shared by the crowd When London's long out door holiday was over, Ministers, diplomatists, and grandees of all sorts set to work to celebrate the Queen's Birthday at a series of the usual levee dress banquets At the Colonial Banquet, the most remarkable figure was that of Sir Henry Loch, whose many medals and decorations testified to the fact that his career had been long and honourable before he had ever seen Australia Governing colonies seems a life which conduces to the minutes mice of youth and vigour, although it should not be forgotten that the Colonial Office appears, in the first instance, to choose men as Governors who are what the Irish call fine personable looking men No one would have guessed that Sir Henry Loch was 62 or that his ion/rat Sir Hercules Robinson was 70 years old 'The latter is a straight-out figure and as fresh of skin as when last he watched the finish for the Melbourne Cup These two men Sir Henry Loch and Sir Hercules Robinson are in a sense the " lions ' of political and official society Every great colonial Governor has such a time once in his career Sir George Bowen enjoyed a ten years ago, when Lord Beacons- held was so struck with his air, men, and gestures us to accord him semi regal honours To Sir Henry Loch, the tributers which he is receiving are purely personal, but round the person and opinions of Sir Hercules Robinson much political excitement is centering Arrived at the fulness of his years and service, he is no longer content to be a mere instrument of other men a policy Before he left the Cape he uttered a bold and notable declaration of policy, covering the whole held of South African policy It was accepted with enthusiasm by politicians of all parties there but here it strangely) divides opinions It is a policy of South Africa for the South Africans, and the gradual assumption by the colonists of the responsibilities of the Imperial Government It is just as it an Australian Governor were to declare that united Australia ought to take over all responsibilities in New Guinea and the Pacific, and severely exclude the interference of missionaries and meddlers It might be supposed that such a policy would be universally acquiesced in here But, unfortunately, prejudice comes in All South African colonists are not I beg ltahmeti,or even Inshtn n they are many of them Dutch, and the policy of Sir Hercules is, as it happens, an ante mis aionary one 'the Rev John Mackenzie is his bitter personal enemy, the Reverend John Mackenzie as the wearer of a white neck cloth has for long had the ear of the editor of the Pall Mall On Me-whose father wore a neck cloth but that have and, owing to the attitude of the Pall Mall OaMtc, it seemed to man) including Mr Chamberlain, that the Hercules Robinson policy was one to he opposed to the di att The odd thing is that since his return to this country, Sir Hercules appears to have entirely converted the leather headed editor in question, who is now writing up his policy in a genes of frantic articles , but the body of opinion which he has created hostile to his present views remains unaffected and in our regular political budgets of news you are likely to bear more than enough of the Hercules Robinson policy and the controversies which it has aroused for Home time to come At the banquet which I have made the occasion of the foregoing remarks, there were not many Australian notabilities beyond the Agents General and the half dozen men who have been Australian Governors Beyond these there were only Sir Daniel Cooper and Sir Charles Nicholson, who have long been dissevered from Australia, and Mr Ex Justice Faucett, of New South Wales A well known and venerable figure in Queen's Birthday celebrations, Bishop Perry, late of Melbourne, has disappeared from the scene, owing to failing health His place as Bayer of grace at the feast was taken by the new Bishop Montgomery, of TiiBmiinia-blushing in the novel honours of an exceedingly stiff and unmanageable silk gown, as I saw him afterwards at the Foreign Office The Foreign Office party which follows the various business is that which reconciles most men to these necessarily depressing ceremonies. This year Lady Salisbury caused social lamentation by reducing her invitations by one half. She had read a ghastly story of how it was found that Mrs G rover Clevelands right hand had become enlarge! by 23 per cent, of its natural bulk through excessive Time! shaking at the " White House," and as Lady Salisbury can reasonably reckon on nearly twice as long a tenure of office as Mrs Grover Cleveland that is, seven years against four -she naturally felt that unless she took strong measures in the matter of hand- shaking, her right hand would increase 676 per cent. On Monday there was a State ball at the Palace, as always without the hostess, where there were more beauties than usual and fewer trumps, and on Wednesday there was a drawingroom where there were more trumps and fewer beauties I do not know it in Melbourne you have daylight drawing rooms, with their dreary accompaniment of " drawingroom teas," where three or four ragged, haggard, and too tightly-packed women exhibit themselves in an unbecoming light to the gaze of a miscellaneous company, including generally a number of poor relations, who relieve their feelings by jarring and cutting remarks on their hostess and her surroundings. At a tea of this kind which I attended the lady of the house varied the usual routine by falling down in a dead faint She was a line fleshy woman, and had had herself laced to a waist of 20m since !) In the morning Nature rebelled at 0 30 The new Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Zetland, was happily described by Lord Spencer as "a nice young Yorkshireman " He is very mild in manner, with odd brown was, which gained him the nick- name at Harrow of " doe rabbit" He is not very bright in point of brains having always been overshadowed through life by an able younger brother, Mr. J. C Dundas, formerly member for Richmond in Yorkshire. Lord Zetland was an hereditary White, and accepted some minor court office under Mr. Gladstone in 1886, but early quitted the Government on a question of Irish agrarian legislation, and is generally reckoned a Tory His brother, who remained longer with the Liberal party than he did, was obliged to give up his seat for Richmond, which was so much of a pocket borough that he could not hold it against his brother's adverse influence. Lord Zetland has a hand- some bright wife, and is an earnest sports- man. He is very much a duplicate of Lord Londonderry in all things, and as neither of them heartily likes the past, it is difficult to see why Lord Salisbury does not insist on their serving it turn about.
