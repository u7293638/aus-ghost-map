THE MISER'S GHOST. A clergyman, detained late one night, at a friend's house, accepted, unhesitatingly, the offer of sleeping accommodation in the only disengaged room—the hauntedchamber. Now, as the reverend gentleman made it a practioe never to travel ever so short a distance without some abstruse theological work in his pocket for perusal at odd moments, it is not surprising that on this occasion he Bat up till after the witching hour; indeed, it was nearly 1 o'clock a.m. when, in a complete but threadbare mediaeval suit, the vapoury spirit of yet another miser—a skinflint ancestor of the clorgyman's host—appeared before bun, whom the ready witted parson at once interviewed somewhat as follows—" Pardon me, sir, you are, doubt less, a resident in this neighbourhood?" "I am !" replied the Bomewhat flabby phantom in sepulchral tones. "Ah! just so. you live, if I may be allowed the expression, in this house —have done so, in fact, for some time past?" "Three hundred years." "Dear me! you don't say so?" "I do." "And have sub scribed. naturally, to many local charities— eh ?" " Devil a bit," said the skinflint's ghost, clutching the bag of sovereigns he carried more closely to bis bony sides; "devil a bit, air." " Well, then," replied the cleric,'' you'll pardon my saying so, I know, but don't you tbink it's about time you did?" And with this he politely presented a subscription-list for the renovation of the parish church. "You will see," he went on, " I have here the names of some of the most influential" He could proceed no further. The smell of sulphur was simply unbearable, and the miser's ghost was laid for ever. The room has since been con verted into a nursery. —Irving Montague.
