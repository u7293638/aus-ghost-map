THE-CLOGK'S ROMANCE. \- T- "T I should like to make one introductory remark — that I consider it a very serious thing to be a clock. . It seems to me to be a responsible form of being, when .1 come to think what destiny may hang upon a single action of mine. I am the house clock at Martyr Hall. I hope yon will not lough when I say that I do not know my age. It is true, however. What with marking the ages of people sbont me, when they enter the world end when they leave it, and with keeping time generally, I have had my hands fully employed ; thus my own years have slipped out of my reckoning. That does not matter, you; will think; "And I had better go on with my"Btory, first of a\l striking the hour which is at hand — One-r- r-r, two-r-r-r, tbree-r-r-r, four ! I do not know any better hour than four o'clock for the telling of a stoiy. At this hour the .kitchen Is quiet, the work of 'the tnoming being oyer, the work of the evening" not yet ""begun : the family are probably out of the house, the servants dispersed for gossip. If you are io the hall, indeed, as I have been, -and not in the kitchen — bnt I must get on, for the tale must be told before l strike five. For mauy years now i nave stood in the large, best kitchen of a fine old man sion ; a -mansion that ' had belonged for generations to a good old family : their, name Martyr. It consists now of only mother and son, and just now they are both abroad. The mistress, .always called "my lady," is older in looks than 4n years j'fpr she has ill health and an ill temper. A thorough woman of society in her day, she had gone through, all the rounds of fashion and folly. Fretful, imperious, and restless, "she could no longer stay content in any place - it was thought that something queer must ad "her, either that she had secret troubles on ber mind, or latent malady, of bo.dy not yet developed. Suddenly, .lthojit. any -sort Of cause, without an instant's warning, she would give orders to pack up, and bff she would go on a journey towards some place near the end of the earth, as if it were only across 'the bills. . She might return by the next week's steamer, her project cut short, or she might remain for a year, just as the whim seized her. Be this as it might she never returned one whit im proved in health or disposition ; though she would come laden with canons, things of ornament or use, and with her old head filled with 'new-fangled and outland ish foreign notions. Peace and harmony reigned in the house when my lady was absent ; but when she came back to it she brought terror. Sir Austin, the master, was my lady's only child, the son of her second marriage, for she had wedded twice. Everybody liked him. There whs" not a trace of his mother in him, either in looks or dis position ; he was his father over again ; the grand, kindly 'Sir Antbony, who had died too sooo. Sir Austin was thirty years'" age cow, just the "handsome, grand-looking gentleman tliatSir Anthony had been, gracious in manner, easy to beehel/.d-lboy, his" blue eyes" genial, his fair waving hair taking a tinge of gold in the sunlight My lady was intensely fond andjmmd of her. son, hut in a selfish way ; and he was not a bit hafyiier in her society, and could not he, than" anyone else was. The servants said — and if yon want to hear how. servants gossip and whisper and get to know' everything, you should take up your abode in a kitchen dock-case — that things could never be. quite straight be tween my lady and him, so long as he set his toss against the wife she had im periously carved ont for him. This was one Miss Threthasis ; who was a niece of her first husband. She -declared --be should many none other than Alice Threthasis ; hej-so theservants thought, would rather go'-wifelfess-for ever than t𝔢 hefi f Mrs. f Thxathasis . was an invalid," nearly as peevish and exacting as iny lady, and' wbhld. liardly ever be left alone otherwise her daughter wonld have bfeetf at 'the HfelT for ' ever. Sir Austin was very patient and attentive to his mother, never -quarrelling with her, taking all her rainplainings quietly/ami attending her hither and thither as her capricious fancy dictated. \- There were several servants in -the holme j"; that yon will readily understand. The' head and cHLaf of them was Betsy, housekeeper now, my, lady's own attendant iu=earfier days. -To tradesmen and the yfifiBghr' servante,she; was " Mrs. Betsy," jroV .amies' SBform was ".Mr. James." Betsy was olderthan her lady. ' She was a woman of good intelligence, mild dis position, and shrewd isense. A slim, neat figure, was :ters, andshe had a fair face and pleasant hat todeflblae eyes. She wore a stiffly-rufflpd cap with .a broad ribbohcabont.it surmounted by a "large bow ja staff dress, usually 'of darfcgreen, made spqrain the skirt aa. . huge, "in the sleeve, a white-frilled cape, a.wbite apron, and . jugh:heelt£ shoes... . On . Sundays her gofrtf vras-of ; silt, ma'ek, and her cap of— rich lace. A -thick -silver chain, on whicjijy3emcPf?Pe?fi?dr Vhe-hpJ® f the house, hnng .by her side always. . The head ol-jtiie men-servants was Juntos Storm : 3Ir. fSttrnm bat of doors James,' or "Mr. i J&mes; Within. ill was a peculiarity of -the hbiiss that the -servants" were" all called fey. their ..Christian;. >nama. : He was the steward ;'and his duties seemed to lie -iii sefjug people who came on businessTaad in keeping the accounts. For years and years he had been in the family, even before Sir Anthony's time, and to- Him lujfl IBetsy there' belonged a sort of romance! Behad the sweetest: temper I ever knew,- "was . gentle aud innocent as: h'lamti." In the evening, when dntles werfe over," "he wonld foe Betsy's shadow. ; He had beea in love with her in their youthful days. All the house knew it i'lt-was a sort of ever lasting courtship ; aQd why - they had never married, wss hot'to he guessed at, unless it was that my lady's imperious whims had stepped in to prevent it To follow in Betsy Yibbtsfeps;! to-live in the light of iher countenance, ;"to' sit dose beside her in the evenings, this seemed to be all the ambition and desire of Ms. Storm. . He was herWto, as well as her shadow ; let her -say what ehe wonld; oh anyanbject, he agreed with her, and re peated her words inJnll or in part The amusing thing was,Vthatlhe seemed to. think her still in her youth ; she was to hisynstasheiirotBawber, a trim, pretiy- fcced girl, of quick parts and taking minnqry " No,- child," " yes; child," he wonld say - to her- even flow." jPerhaps with him, and he was still the smart yonng steward of Sir Anthony, with an elastic tread and a flower in his button hole : though he was indeed ten years at least older than Betsy. The other servants need not be mentioned. The butler. Miles, was stud and elderly ; my lady's mud, Pheby, bad seen nearly fifty years ; the cook, Rebecca, took a vast deal upon herself in the way of domineering, and in trying to keep the yonager servants in snbjection. Rebecca was the only one of the house hold who ever ventured to contradict my .lady ; she did not eeem to stand in fear of her. Things were well-ordered in the honse ; that's certain : I could tell, from having been before in an ill-ordered one. This was partly owing to my lady's exacting ways, partly to Betsy's system of manage ment, partly to Rebecca's activity of body and tongue. During my lady's absences, roles and discipline were relaxed ; but no sooner did the poBt give notice of her retnm than things' were called to order. And quickly, too ; for it' often happ'enh that "the letter arrived one day, and my lady and Sir Austin the next. Then wonld be bustle Every servant was brought np. sharply to bis and ber dnty, and gnade to' feel they must do it It was an anxious, hot to say solemn time ; there was no laughing or playing over the work ; the maids, could not chaBe each other with brooms, or talk tothe gardeners from some upper window, flirting a duBter coqnettishly in their grimy bands. Well, to go on. After nearly a year's respite, my lady and Sir Austin having spent a good part of their time in Rome; one of these warning letters was bronght by ;the postman to the Hall. It was Easter weather; bright and clear and tolerably warm. The travellers wonld arrive the following day, and Betsy set everybody on to clean and scrub. Brown holland coverings were taken off the furniture, lace and damask curtains were put up. As the gjrls flitted about, talking over their work, I gathered that some excite ment was hp about Pheby. She and Miles always accompanied my lady and Sir Austin on their travels. Pheby had been ill in Rome, of a fever, it was said, but waB getting better; now, hojreveg ehe was ill again, and it was doubtful whether she would not have to he left behind in Paris. Miles said that 'much in a few lines to James. ,-. ; i . The grand whirl of commotion subsided towards the close of the following day, and all was in readiness James put on what gentlemen oall evening dress, Betsy her black silk and lace' cap', the maids their best bibs and tuckers The large carriage, attended by its ser vants, went to the Bix-mifeoff railway station, to await the travellers. It was a wild night, dark as pitch : but, as Rebecca irreverently remarked, my lady generally did come home when the furies were abroad. Betsy reproved ber, and held up her hand for silence The wind swept in gusts over the har dened earth ; then, gathering its strength, went soariug up on mighty .- wings towards heaven... James sbivgredas if his clothes were thin for him, and drew a step nearer to Betsy. , " -i - " I wish you wonld listen," she said to the chattering maids, "I am almost sure I hear wheels." " Wheels 1" exclaimed James. " Why, so it is," he . added, after a pause of silence. " The fotaiumuBt have kept it'e time for once." " Perhaps it knew it had my lady, in it," said Rebecca, in her bard way. ! They trooped into the ball, leaving my kitchen door open, as the carriage came rolling np the aveuue. The great doors were flung back, and the light streamed out upon it as it stopped. " Fall into line on either side," said Betsy to the servants ; and they fell back." My lady's high, sharp voice was heard, beard before -there had been -time to let down the steps. « John, it is astonish-' ing how slow yon are ! yon always were so. Am I to day in the carriage all night ?" - ; She came sweeping in ; looking neither to the right nor left ; an imperious woman, with a dark .and sullen., fag And she canght np the skirt of her tra vel- ' ling dress, as if she feared-it might tonch the gowns of the maids. " Welcome home 1 my lady ; -welcome home, air Austin I - spoke James in his; meek and somewhat quavering voice. - "And I hope your .travels have beep pleasant to you, my lady," - added Betsy. " Welcome home !" "There! get ont of the way; when do I have pleasant travels ?" retorted my lady angrily. , How different was the young master's greeting — and how handsome he looked as he threw 'hack the" breast of his ovor- coat, and lifted his hat from his golden hair, and stretched out his hands to shake I those of the steward and housekeeper! "James, I em glad to see you again ! ' tsetsy. you iook younger man ever. And how are you all?" turning his smiling face on the line of intids.'. J. have brought a little present for each of you." "When you have finished detaining Betsy with your nonsense, Sir Anstin, perhaps-- you will" ifllow-her to show nie to my rooms," cried, my lady sharply. " And I hope the dinner is ready, for I am very hungiy." "We are all hungry, "smiled Sir Austin, as though he would, as usual, throw oil' o'ri the troubled waters. " All three of us. As -hungry as hunters." . Three ! Three of them ? - Why yes, to oe sure ! That little figure cloaked and hooded, - stepping in so quietly ..after my lady, was not Pheby. It was.a young girl ; a stranger." My; lady, preceded by Betsy," carrying two lighted candles in massive silver candlesticks, which had stood in readiness, -halted on her- way tqj the grand staircase, . as phe was passing one of the reception rooms, and caught sight of its blazing fire. " Ga in there," she , coldly said, , push-: ing the stranger into the room, and not very -gently. " Von xanuot he- of any use to me, as you are : and do not let me see your face again until you are warm. " Oh, thank yon I" returned lie ypjiing lady in a grateful tone," and in the sweeteet voice I ever heard. " How kind yon are ! I am truly very icold.",, : " Cold 1" retorted my lady. " Have been made wretched for days past by your miserable shivering. It has dier traCted my harre abominably." The.clim&te; is-so different .inim pleaded the 'girl softly. - " When"! safe little used to it; I shall not feM it So- keenly" ' . My fire, and swept on to the etaircaaa The girl knelt down in the blare and held out two small gloved hands to the warmth. Presently Sir Anstin went into the room ; and James also, for his master was fadHng to him. Sir Anstin smiled down at the kneeling figure : who looked but a child, though she was eighteen. " What 1 still in your cloak and hood?" he said, pleasantly. She smiled and rose np. "It is each a pretty fire !" answered ehe — " and oh, so welcome 1 1 think I gee pictures in it. I never before saw so great a fire." ." As a nation we glory in our generous fires," he answered, smiling. " But to eDjoy it fully you ought to throw off your wrappings. Let me help yon." He nnfostened the clasp of the cloak, and untied the white-lined hood ; and Bhe stood forth the prettiest creature, James declared afterwards, that he ever saw, her dress black, with a bit of white at the throat. Small and slight was she, with a grace ful form, and a sweet face that nearly took old James's breath away. The features were lovely ; the red Hps ever parting to show the small pearly teeth. Pale generally, a bright crimson flashed into toe cneeks wttn nearly every word, Her eyes were large and dark and soft, and her dark brown hair was beautiful. A delicate, refined girl altogether, with a gravity beyond her 'years, and a sweet; patient expression of face. \- ".Oars is a cold bnt not an unkindly climate," continued Sir Austin. "Of coarse yon will feel it greatly after your own ; but in time I hope you will learn to like it" "Oh yes," ehe earnestly answered. " It is so kind of Lady Martyr to have bronght me — I wonld not be ungrateful to her for the world." Bat Bhe conld not help shivering. " James," said the master, turning to him, " I think this yonDg lady wonld be the better for alittle hotwineaod water before dinner. Will yon get it ? It was bitterly cold on board the boat and all the way down here in the train : - and the wind to-night is keen and wild." He placed a low chut for her before tbe fire, standing np himself! and James soon took in the wine and water, and a biscuit with it. Close npon that; my lady's bell rang sharply for the yonng. lady to go np to her. She did not come down to dinner, it was said. . Sir Anstin "asked where ehe was, as he gave his arm to his mother, and my lady enrtly answered that sbe preferred to stay shivering over her bed room fire. Sir Austin knitted his brow at that, and the servant saw it. f Who is ehe V questioned Rebecca of Mile8, when they were in the best kitchen, after tbe dinner was over. " As nice a little lady as you'd wish to see;"' answered Miles, who was the most talkative of the men- servants. " Her father was. some high-born Italian ; be spent bis patrimony on his country and died fighting for it. His wife was English, high-born, too, and she and tbe daughter were left without fortune. They had to let their old villa to live, and took up their "abode in a sort of summer-house in the grounds. My lady and Sir Austin hired the vills, and that's how they became acquainted with them." " Ob," said Rebecca. "And who is it that the yonng lady is wearing black for?" " Har 'mother. She died a month ago. My ladyhad got very intimate with tbem, end she-promised the mother to take the young one as a companion." Rebecca was sitting down by the fender on the iron stool they call a "footman.". She stared at Miles. "That's un odd thing for her to do ; isn't it V " Well," yon 'see, in talking together, the two old ladies found out they were related in some distant way : connected, at any rate ; and I think my lady tooa a fancy to Miss Carlotta at first : Char lotte, ypn know, it spells in English. Ye<a wonderful -thing for her to do." Rebecca nodded her head. "Look here, Miles ; she comes home cantan kerous enough at all times, as we have cause to laiow ; but she is worse this time than fever! TVhat has put her ont ?" Miles did not- answer. : " Now, then can't yon speak.?" cried Rebecca, flying into a contrary mood. " Are yon going to deny that she came in npon us in a way jnst unbearable, not fit for a Christian ? " She has been so all the way from Paris," said Miles. "How the master bears with her — and he that patient — is beyond1 me. Pheby thinks something most be amiss with her health; least- ways, she hinted as much." "-Something amiss with her temper," corrected Rebecca. " TV) begin with, she had a scene with Pheby in Paris," went on Miles. "JPheby crossed her in some way ; and for nothing in the world, as she told me, but that she aakoT "ijy lady to see a French doctor. My 'lady was quite violent It upset Pheby, and the next morning her fever was back again, and she had to be left behind at tiie hotel Sir Anstin would have stayed on there, bnt my lady in sisted upon travelling all the same. Then -he proposed that ehe should engage _a maid to attend her on the journey in Pheby's place. My lady refused, saying she should make Miss Donati her maid .until Pheby was about again. Sir Austin , was angry. ' Surely you cannot think of doing anything of the kind, mother ' said be. ' I could not permit it ; Carlotta is -our guest; "onr more than equal.' My lady flared ont at that, and called him , names ; and she has been fit to soap all our heads off ever since." " She seems a sweet; dear young lady," interrupted Betsy, who had come in while Miles was speaking, "fio- grateful fin- any little thing done for her ! ' She was crying bitterly over the fire when I- went into her room after my lady went down to dinner ; but she smiled np at me in a pretty way, and dried her tears, as if to excuse herself, saying she felt strange jnst at first in a new country, aud had -bnt recently lost her dear mother. ' How good you are to me T she said, in her sweet, childish voice ; for I had knelt down to rob her poor, chilled limbs. 'I shMl -ferfi.'happier when f get warm. The light and heat .are blessed things.' " ' "Yon can't help liking her," said Miles. " And my 'lady has been that nasty and snappish with her nll the way over that I know what I know," be jsddefl, dropping ids yoice, as though be fhonght Jhs walls might be alive with; eare ;; - Vand that jb, that the master is in love' with the pretty girl, aad meanB toejwFih" "Then the fat will be in the fire," nodded Rebecca. My lady had fonnd fault with Miss Donati for feeling chilly on the journey, bnt she canght a cold herself Tbe next morning she did not get np, : and Betsy feared she was going to be very ill. Auy- way, she was very angry : she was not need to be ill with colds. Sir Austin wanted to send for the doctor, who lived bnt a mile from the park gates, but my lady forbade it. She hated doctors, she said ; most of them were nothing but incompetent pretenders, and she should recover sooner without old Fall than with him. By night she was so ill as to be, Betsy thought, in danger, and Sir Austin took it upon himself to act Thomas drove off in the dog-cart and brought back Dr. FalL " So far as I can jadge, the langs are inflamed, bat she wiU not let me examine her," he said to the master when he came down from the chamber. My lady was addicted to taking her own way, Sir Austin.'' Nobody knew that better than Sir Austin. The doctor ordered a blister, and told Betsy how and when it was to be pnt on. My lady finqg the blister back in Betsy's face when it came, and wonld not have it on. She continued very ill in bed, very; owing, said the servants amid themselves, to the. want of proper remedies. Sir Anstin had got the doctor to send in a sick nnrse, and my lady. refoBed to see her. She wonld only have Betsy near her, nobody else. . For two weeks -even Sir Austin was hardly let .go .into the chamber ; at the end of that time she got a little better, and would let Miss Donati read to her for an hour daily in a book of her own soft Italian tongue, which my lady spoke as a native. Bnt she did not get out of bed yet. However, danger was over, and the anxiety of the house hold relieved. The beautiful May weather came in ; the enn was shining and the flowers were blossoming. Miss Donati ran abont in the warmth, ont of doors, light as a bird. Released from the ill-temper of my lady, she wag as happy aa a fairy princess. " I shall like this climate always when it is warm as this," she said one day to Sir Austin, as he met her coming in, and her soft dark eyes were sparkling, .and her cheeks blushing. His answer, was T too low for me to hear ; but his blue eyes smiled back into hers, and he drew her little hand within his arm, and led her back to the pleasure gardens again. What Miles had said was true : Bir Austin loved her, ' and meant to let the world know it. With my lady np, aud my lafly in bed, things were widely different Sir Austin was master hoar, in fact, as well as in name. Every word of bis, every little wish was implicitly obeyed . by|ie servants. They would have liked to obey him always had tbey dared. " While I am . confined to my room here, Miss -Donati will sit in your parlour," my lady had said to the honsekeeper the first day she was in bed. "Do yon bear, Betsy ? She is not to use our own rooms at all ; she is to confine herself to your parlonr," and her meals mast be served there." Betsy heard fast enough ; but Betsy was not allowed to carry ont the order. Sir Anstin interposed his veto. " My mother most have spoken with out reflection : -or else you failed to catch her meaning" he said to Betsy. .- " Miss Donati is a" young gentlewoman of high birth ; she must be treated with perfect consideration. She will be my especial guest; sit with me until my mother shall be with ns again: in fact, occupy the place that my sister would, if I had one. You have heard, perhaps, that some of my mother's relatives ate 'Miss Ddnati's relatives ?" ' "It seems a vast deal more - proper, Sir Austin, that the yonng lady should be your, companion than mine;", was ..Betsy's answer. " But what-wiH my lady sayifr she finds her orders disobeyed I" " I think, Betsy, that while your lady is ill it will be 'best not to trouble her with . any kiud : of contradiction. - - Yjrtt, can let her Suppose that her orders are carried ont." So there was a pretty plot ! My lady in 'bed, not allowed to bear secrets, "Sir' Austin master and taking biB own will. "When the cat's away, the mice will play," said Rebecca, looking as if she would like to dance. I suppose you don't forget that I.'am the clock ; and that all clocks require to be wonnd np. I was wound jup-sjways by James Storm. Every other Monday at mid-day, as regularly as every pther Monday came round, he bronght forward the loir chair and stood on it to wind' me. And oh this Monday that I now tell of, which was ten or eleven days after the coming home of my lady, he was-ahbat to step on the wooden chair," when the kitchen door opened and Betsy, stole Jn from my lady's room, fooking 'hoirilHy frightened and as white as a ghost. . - " What is the matter ?" asked James as she staggered to the red-cushioned . arm-chair. " Oh, James ! Oh, James 1" she gasped. " I — I — " and then ehe went info 's fit of hysterics, sobbing one ininnte and -laugh ing the next. " No — no, don't call anybody," sbe managed to jerk out as h6 was tnrniug away for assistance. "I shall be better presently. I have had a shock, James ; a dreadful fright — and I dare not tell of it" " But you can tell it to me, Betsy." "No, not even -yon..- Idarenot. Oh!" she -shuddered, "what au awful thing, what an aWful .thing." ' There was a cupboard .in .'the best kitchen corner, in 1 which Rebecca kept some cherry brandy . Jirnes £ot a bottle of it down end poured a spoonful or two into a wineglass.: - As Betsy sipped it she became a little easier, only cryingquietly. " I "cannot . explain anything, James ; I can't indeed. I— I've got to know of a most dreadful secret; a fatal secret, and — oh dear, I think it -will kill me !" she broke off " How shall I live, on, and .'keep it 1" , . r f A" fetid' ' secrel i" - repeated James.' " Does it concern SirjAustui ?" "It concerns as ell," she answered! trembling and shaking. ''Ok, what are we to do ! What are we fo doT' " " Bat teAy can'f you teU. msd 'We 'are both grey-haired now, Betsy, yon and I, and we have'beeri tfendOT friends and com panions ever mace our locks wsr$ bright - and our stes elastic ; and I ask you — - why ?" " ' - V ' '/ ' dan not/' she said impressively ; "p>y Jsdf would kill me if I fold,; Besides, she has Bworn me to secrecy." James was beginning to tremble too. " Does Sir Austin " " Hash 1" cried Betsy, as a clatter was beard outside ; " some one is coming in. You must forget that I have mentioned this, James." "Why, what's the matter now I" ex claimed Rebecca, stalking in upon tbem in her pattens, for she was helping the scnllery-maid to clean. "Betsy whiter than her apron, and my cherry brandy got at 1" " Mrs. Betsy was feeling a bit faint," said James ; " I reached down the cherry brandy for her." " Faint 1 and no wonder," cried Re becca ; " stewed up, as she is, ail day and night in my lady's sick room ! I should strike ; I know that." Betsy rose and left the kitchen, her steps halting. Rebecca pat up the cherry brandy, and James got on the chair and wound me up with shaking fingers. I wonder what ill it was that was coming npon the house. A day or two after this, when the window near me stood open to the warm sunshine, I happened to strike the hour — eleven — jast ss Sir Anstin and the yonng lady passed. She turned her bead quickly and looked in. What a fine sound that clock has in striking, so deep and melodious," she exclaimed in her pretty accent that seemed to bB softer than oars, as if a touch of her - own sweet Italian tongue mingled with it. "It is a fine old clock altogether," observed Sir Austin, "Come in and look at it, Carlotta." She came in through the side door with htm, and stood in front of me ; the kitchen bring empty just then. What a lovely , face it was, raised to mine. -" It is too' handsome to be - here," she said. "I declare the care is of .carved ebony. It ought to be. in the hall, Sir Austin." " It shall be sometime," returned the master,!oolringdownat her with the love shining in his dark blue eyes, " It, and all things else, shall be placed whereso ever yonjlike best; Carlotta." As they turned away, a great tide of crimson flushed her cheeks. Ah I it was easy to see how the- wind blew. And my ' lady, up io her bedroom, suspected not. .-the treason tbat was abroad. June was coming in before she quitted it, to stir the bouse with ber Bharp com mands. Her bell would ring ten times at once, the maids flying all ways to answer it- Up. and dqwn here. and there and everywhere, went she, in ker pink cash mere dressing- gown! a fantastic French cap upon ber bead that - made her look all the uglier. The day .that my lady took up her place again in the drawing-room after her loDg illness— in a trailing velvet dress and the riogs glittering on her fingers — Sir Austin left the Hall. News had 'come that something was amiss with my lady's ' sister-in-law, Mrs. Threthasis; theydidjnot know whether it was illness or trouble ; and iny lady ordered Sir Austin off to Cornwall. " Is it necesary that I should go, think you, mother V he asked in Betsy's hearing, who was busy abont her mistress. " I cannot see what trouble Bhe can have : and if it be sickness, I can do no good in a sick-room." My lady answered that it wire necessary, .and he must lose no time in starting. So be went off in tbe dog cart to the station.- That same evening Pheby came home. She was thin and pale, and her hair was cat short. . She and Betsy began at once to hold conferences together in whispered tones and with grave faces. It struck toe that Betsy was disclosing to her what she had- not dared disclose to James — the ratal secret. Two days later tbe postman . bronght two letters to the house : one for my lady, one for 'Miss Donati, and both of them from Sir Austin. What my lady's contained she and he only knew, but when she read it she was like a .mad woman. ' "Never,'' she , screamed out, with a vehemence that made Phebyrstart, "never! I would see her die first," She tiushfed" down stairs iafter- reading the letter;- Ota the breakfast-room, where Miss Donati waited. What- happened, none of the servants could say ; there was a commotion iusidc, my lady raving, stamping,., and -storming.; and .then the poor . yonng girl,' looking frightened to death; came running forth all in A tremble, with a wound in her cheek. - ' ; "ShV'had struck her ewith, her heavy hand, and at times it's re shorpaa a dag ger," -whispered Pheby to -' the honse keeper. . What an uncomfortable day it was 1 My lady in .her ragingih6c>d,thepooryonng foreigner hiding -her "cheeks and her tsars in her chamber, locked in by my lady's orders, and the servants "pretty nearly in rebellion. ; My lady was on the .eve of madness,. they saidto one another; she wonld strike a deadly blow next! and it might be to one of them. \- That night there, was a mysterious de parture from tlie "house. ' "Tlie "closed carriage came quietly 'to the honse at ten' o'clock, and two veiled women stole down the stairs, and were driven quietly off in it : it was my lady'amaid with a prisoner in charge, Miss Donati. \- For some of the servants that night there was ho bed. -But not on account oftbe departure. For several days James Storm had been ailing, and this night he died. After the whispering amid the ser vants had passed away, consequent on the departure of the carriage, James came into the kitchen, and drew the old arm-chair right before the -blazing fire, re though the fire in his! own sitting-room ; did uot rgive bnt enough warmth ; and certainly - the ' kitchen fire, summer and winter, blazed sWay with a roaring heat. His , face looked whiter thati Rebecca's jellybag! Betsy, coming inj poticed it " Do-yon. feel worse .to-night, James ?" she said. " " I think I am going;" he whispered. "Oh, don't say it 1" - she cried, sf-ter a startled panse. - Oh, my. dear old friend, is there anything I can do for you?" \- ' The change seemed to be coming fast. Betfy held his band. ' She would. have : sent one of the men for tbe doctor, bui he stopped her. " Nobody can ,d anything for main this wsrid;" he "srid. "The Lord above jrncfrs whatYsTiest! ' and he has called ma" She was dying silently. - " Oh, James! I fear ' 1 hfeye Jbee£ often impatient with yon," she eaid /"bit I meant . wU,.I did indeed. Can't I do anything for yon before we part ?" " I think not," he answered, his speech getting more feeble. " I wonld have been glad to be pat at rest about that dark secret; for it has tronbled my mind mnch ; Sir Austin was always dear to me. Bnt it does not signify now : the uneasiness has passed away." She bent close to his ear, and whispered. It aroused the fleeting spirit ; he sat np in his chair. " What ?" he cried. "Yes, it's thai;" said Be toy. "The Lord be merciful to her 1 " he aspirated, clasping his handB in supplica tion. Betsy bent forward as his head fell back again ; she kissed his withered lips. " Perhaps it might have been happier far yon had we married, James. We have been happy as it is, always -bring together, always pleasant one with the other; but — perhaps — your life might have been a more contented one had we married. Dear James 1" Once more she kissed him. It was all she conld do now : . and it satisfied him. A smile passed over the pale old face, beautifying it strangely : and, still holding Betsy's hand, James Storm's eyes quietly closed as he entered into that better place where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage ; where it . will be face to face and heart to heart, without the dimming, mystifying veil between. . The next evening saw the re torn of Sir Austin : and he held a private con ference with bis mother before he dept. It was as stormy a one as she could make it His voice washeard, low, firm, uncompromising ; hers full of a rsging tempest that melted at laat into sobe. "Yon have learnt to love her!" shrieked my lady. "How dared you F L.dbn'rt . think there .was. .much ! learning" in it, mother," he answered." " I have loved her from the first hour I saw her ; I shall love her' always." " You shall never many" her." " I beg your pardon. I have obeyed you in all essential things, mother ; I wish to obey you stiff; but I mast choose my wife myself." "Alice shall be your wife, and ut>" other." "I told you, but that you were too angiy to hear me; that Alice Is to many a Cornish man, as her father -was. Yon may pnt her ont of your thoughts so lar: re I am concerned. Her mother is angry, bnt she is resolved; I should never have married Alice under any circumstances, and lam sorry you haye been bo un willing to believe it." "She has three hundred thousand pounds.'" . " Yes, those Cornish miners know how to bag the gold. Carlotta has nothiiig, I perceive, yon are going to say, mother ; and itiB'-trne, font I have qnito enongh for her and me." Not until the next morning did be find out that Miss Donati was missing. How he' wonld hove acted, or what he would have done, was not known, for the bouse was 'in too mnch commotion with other matters. He first learnt then that James Storm, the troe aud faithful steward of his father and himself! the meek and gentle man, was gone. He learnt also that the house contained a secret — that which Betsy had called a fatal one ; which she had whispered into the ear of James when he was dying. The angry passions of my lady, acting upon her previous bodily weakness, had brought on illness ; Betsy called it an " attack." She lay insensible on her bed ; Dr. Fall was Sent for ; and then tbe secret was discovered and had to be declared. Truly it was total in nature. Mj lady was suffering from a dreadful malady which ehe had been concealing. Its ravages were eating away ber heart strings. . She had made -no sign! .pre- ferring to saner in silence, lletey naa discovered it accidentally. Pheby had' known of it for months, and had angered her lady in Paris by begging her to ' see' a doctpr. A. very, very little span of life, at most bnt a week or two, cOnld remain to her now. So there was a fine household for Sir Anstin to wake up to this morniug : jus sained old servant dead, hie mother flying: ' - "i \- With the - discovery acting on ber mind, and this new attack -bporn her- body, and the certainty of the speedy death that was' staring her", in the face, my lady changed. The haughty, self; willedj - passionate .woman became silent and snbdned. : " "It's mostly the case with them. ; wicked ones," affirmed Rebecca. '".Bnt .for their conscience stepping. "In to: prick 'em towards the end, -they'd die in thrir evil. ; The Lord sbuds JEs chasten ing to these -black sheep to save "em." . She let Sir Anstin know where Miss Donati . was, -and let him telegraph to Pheby -to bring her back. -' It was even ing when they arrived. The poor! pale, pretty child crept in shrinking and trembling, her hand covering her cheek. A , shudder caught Sir Austin's 'strong -frame as he drew away the unwilling hand and saw the bruise. Oh, my darling!", he cried onl; " how can I make it up to yon ?" " "Why have yon sent- for me back again ?" she shivered. "I dare not stay here," . "Yes," he fondly whispered, kissing the tears away, " you wiil stay hero for ever — so long as time, with ns, shall last" Well, she was changed — -that imperious lady of onra. Far from opposing their marriage now, ehe urged it on ; went iDto a fever of impatience lest it ehonld not take place soon enough. That is, lest she should not live to see it A special licence wre procured ; and the' clergyman of the parish . came to" the Hall, and married them by my lady's bedside. . . . . "I conld not leave her here unprotected after my death," she.Baid to the priest; re' if in apology. " Her mother was my friend and relative!" Hot weather is abroad still, thdngh -partridge shooting begins to-morrow. My lady has been in the churchyard two months now, nhder a white marble tomb stone tbat sets forth her virtues, and the maids wear black bows in their caps. Betsy has another to mourn for besides my lady, and sadness eite in her faded eyes. Commotion, is setting in again, super-, vening npon the qniet of the -last few weeks. Brooms, and mops, and duster and ws aiiijlyrisfiirijy as they!%ere in my ladyVMme, for'ahme visitors some-olhe house to-nigit for a Week or two—my yonng Lady Martyr's relatives, Lqrd and Lady Etcherlej, dis tantly related also jo gir Austin. As to myself — well, they have not moved me into the hall, re tny yonng lady once snggeated. The servants said I had been with them so long tbat they should be " lost" without me, I was like an old friend to them : and as my yonDg lady listens to alt their wishes, and is soli- citioos to give happiness as my lady was to give tormeut, I am to stay in the old place, the hall-k:' ben. Sir Austin— — There ! I hat . qiven warning to strike. Time for only 1 jw more words remains to ma To say that, puts me somewhat in mind of death : when he gives warning time is all bnt over. And here come Sir Anstin and my young lady into tbe private garden before my open window. How girlish she looks, in her thin black summer dress, and the happy bloom npon her bright face. They are going to ran a race down the broad walk. Sir Anstin gives her half the distance and wins by a length, in a burst of merry laughter : his legs an long and active. "Yon have lost, Carlotta," he says, "and yon must pay forfeit and, with that, he tarns her face upwards. She pretends to hide it from him ; to be coy ; but the master is tbe stronger, and he brings it close to his own, and takes the kiss from her ruby lips. She I am going to strike 1 Aire, aire 1 One-rrr, two-rrr, three-rrr, four-nr, five!
