SOUTH AUSTRALIAN MEETING. There will be no local meeting's of any consequence until the middle of next jnonth, and consequently cycling matters are quiet for the craclts. As a matter of fact, however, there are not many of the genus to be seen about the metropolis at the present time, the majority having gone off to Adelaide, where the League of Wheelmen is holding its Adelaide Wheel Bace Meeting. At the first day of the fixture last Sa turday, there were thirty-one intercolo nial men present, and the local talent was also well represented, but the enervating weather had the not unusual result of keeping most people at their homes, and the estimated attendance was only some two thousand. The presence of this handful even is surprising seeing that the thermometer was 111 in the shade. It is likely that a loss will be made over the meeting. Notwithstanding the great heat, some good racing was witnessed, and an Aus tralian record was actually broken. This was in the five miles scratch, which was won by W. C. Jackson, in the excellent time of 12min 27 2-6secs. Bob Lewis was second, W. M'Donald, third, and Walne, fourth. All the heats of the Wheel Bace (first, L100, second, L30, third, L10, two miles), were well contested, and fast times were accomplished. W. C. Jackson, who is at present rid ing excellently, won his heat from scratch in 4m in 17secs, being only four fifths of a second outside the notable time pu: up by Walne the year previous. The other starters included M'Donald, who could get no nearer than fourth. In a later heat, which fell to Cornelius, Gordon and Beauehamp were amongst the competitors, but only scored third and fourth places, respectively. A splen did race was witnessed In the seventh and last heat of the day, the starters in cluding L. M. Jackson, B. W. Lewis, Fontaine, Matthews, etc. The front markers, however, M'Narnara, 230yds, Fay, 200yds, and Merkell, 250yds, paced so consistently that the others didn't have a ghost of a show at (he finish. M'Narnara won, and an idea of the pace can be ga thered from the fact that the two miles were completed (from the 230yds mark), in the remarkable time of 4min 5 2-5secs. The final will be run next Saturday, and those eligible to start will be the fol lowing, who finished first and second in their heats respectively: — First heat :A. T. Potter, 300yds, 1 ; S.
