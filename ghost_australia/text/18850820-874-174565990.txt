THE SONG OF THE MOSQUITO, [" KOMAKOFF " IN RUSSIAN MEANS A MOSQUITO.] A GENERAL sat in his tent alone, Laying his plans for the fight; His left hand pressing his weary brow, While he traced the route with his right. He thought that the " presentation " sword, That lialf-sheathed in its scabbard hung, Was singing a weird monotonous song, And this was the song it sung. " Slay ! slay ! slay ! Husband, brother, and son ; A victorious name and a wreath of fame Shall be thine when the conquest's won. Slay ! slay ! slay '. Mother, and child, and wife, Spare not the old dropping into the tomb, Nor the young budding into life. " Slay ! slay! slay ! The strong man, hearty and hale ; Slay 1 slay ! slay ! The conscript, beardless, and pale, Slay ! slay ! slay ! Till my blade be red to the hilt, Till the diamond hilt is dyed with blood, The well wrought blade has spilt. " Slay ! slay ! slay ! There is glorious work to be done; To strew the plain with heaps of slain And wounded, ere set of sun. Slay ! slay ! slay ! Nor heed those who for ' quarter' call They had better far die by an officer's sword Than by cannon or musket ball. " Slay ! slay ! slay ! Let each blade in the stream be dyed, Whether a private wields the brand, Or it hangs by an officer's side. Slay ! slay ! slay ! What care we if our cause be right ? A soldier should trust to his strong right arm, And bear himself bravely in fight. " Slay ! slay ! slay ! Nor think of the widow's tear, ' Though thy charger trample her husband's corse, As he sweeps on his wild career. Slay ! slay ! slay ! Nor dream of the orphan's cry, When told why his mother wears widow's weeds, And the tear glistens bright in her eye. " Slay ! slay ! slay ! And think of thy great reward. The painter shall blazon thy noble deeds, Thy praises be sung by the bard, ' I have slain my thousands' for thee shall be No empty or idle boast, As a proof of thy valour thy breast shall bear The cross of the Holy Ghost!"
