CATHOLIC INTELLIGENCE. TO OUR BLESSED LADY. (BY J. C. DEADY, KANTDRK, IRELAND.) All hail to thee, thou glorious Queen Of Heaven's resplendent throne ! Thou fairest flower the earth hath seen, Or Paradise hath known ! We greet thee next to God Triune, And sing thy joyous praise ; Through thee did Heaven to Man commune Its awful mystic ways. All hail, thou Rose of Jesse's stem, Replete with heavenly grace ! Thou morning star, translucent gem, Bright ray from God's own face ! O Queen of Heaven's rich golden light, Meek honour of the skies, O casket filled with diamonds bright, Pure source of all our joys ! Bright temple of the Holy Ghost— Sweet, blooming Olive Tree, O Mistress of the heavenly host, All hail—all hail to thee ! Thou Cedar of the Holy Land, Of sempiternal bloom, Exalted o'er God's chosen band, Dispeller of dark gloom ! By those sweet names, O Mother dear, We lowly crave thine aid ; For round our souls, we know with fear, The Tempter's wiles are laid. Implore thy Sou to give us strength Earth's passions to subdue— And when the strife is o'er at length, , 0 take us home with you. —Boston Pilot.
