To the more formal busiuess there'was IV' 1 tlu: duty of drinking to the immortal memory of . mm and we believe that this society kikes the , u;.',- of place in beiug the first iu Australia to cele 1 r.i :.av manner the 23rd of April, For much in ; r.iiti which proved valuable iu recommending the which the society was phiuned, we are in ,i. it!»*» kindred bodyiu Melbourne, aud specially • Mv.-i h'ur, Professor Morris, who most kindly I .-red his services, and offered himself to be ;ii any meeting we chose to invito him to.

At the succeeding meeting a first taste :h-.- ;• uwr of Shakespeare in moulding the materials Listory to the objects of the drama was experienced iLo reading and examination of the play "Julius of whoso meaning Mr. T. J. Connelly was the worthy exponent. In an essay which left but r->:u for discussion, he unfolded the various m\s <>t'this great tragedy, ana brought out in reply j.iin ideas which seem to have impressed the author 3 t' jiib'i ruction.
