A USEFUL GHOST. Br 5. Kkowus. Mally Smith stood in the midst of her neighbours. She trembled, end her face bore evidence of her terror. The scene was in front of a row of cottages in a country village not far from Manchester. Mally had been to see a friend, and was returning up the lonely lane when she saw the " ghost." She had some difficulty at first in describing what ebe had seen, but arter a few minutes, to give her time to 'get her wynt," she. Mid 41 It wor a great white thing, eton'ing up ogen to'. edge, about hawfe-way npth' lone." ? Mercy on us V' exclaimed Betty Hamson, lifting up her hands in honor, " thou doesn't say bo, MaUy? Whatever rail we do if th thing stops theer' altogether ; we'st a be fre stent t' deeth." "Azt euro thou seed it V asked Ivanof Roper incredulously. Seed it f To be sure I need it. Dost \- toink la'ouldfaa.1 runael didif toere'd been too'wt ? . I seed it as plain as I see thee this . veryminnit. If t'doeaoa believe me. goo thysel1 an1 ha' a peep at it— tha'H noan be so skeptical after that, fa warrant." Nancy, however, evidently had no wish for ocular demonstration, for ehe stood still and . pnt uo further questions to Mally. When the husbands came home from work they were told of what Mally bad seen, aud \- after swaDowing their tea they congregated together on the - flags, and over their pipes discussed, the matter. One or two were in I the habit of going.down the lane every night to the "Jolly Farmer," and though titoy . professed Mally-was " makmr summat crwt o nowt," they were not eo ready as usual to getaway to their cups. After -talking the ' matter over, assisted by their Wives, -who had naturally come out to bear what was stud, they (the men) decided Jbgo in a body to. see if there were"owt in iV The night was very dark — toerewere. no gas lamps, nor moon nor stars, to light up , the . .lane. Before leaving they provided themselves with stout stioke, and MalJy said tovherthueband, "Tim, dunno1 go too near for fear to1 thing sould do eommat at thee;" to whioh Tim replied, ' If tbou'e made a foo' on us, Til do summat at thoe when I come back, owd wench !" It was a time of anxiety to the women when they saw their husbands disappear in the darkness down the lane. Jemima Pratt, who sometimes attended the little chapel of the Primitive Methodists in the village, eaid, "boo wish they had'nt gone; it 5ould ha' been beatt leave to' thing alone; they'd geet Sdkn Shufilton, th' Methodv, to goo wi' 'em ; fiam wor sich a good mon 'at uowt could do him ony hurt." "Our Bill '11 tak oo hurt," chimed in Mary Womenley. "I'll bet if he gets a aeeto'towt he'll tak to his heels whoam again, faster nor he went. Oi welly wish there metb eummat i' th' lone ; it'll keep him fro1 go In1 deawn ev'ry nest to th' 4 Farmer."' Bill was one of those who was given to drink, but was a coward, as even- one of his neighbours kne w, when not primed with beer. "What's that !" exclaimed Mally. 41 I'm BUre I heerd summat." " Net thee, tha 'a net gotten o'er thy Sreet jet,"l&ughed; Maiy. " Bu' 1 did hear eummat, I tell vo': assure me I'm stand in' here. Theer — theer, theer It is agen ! Dunno' yo' hear it F' 41 We heerd summat then," was the general response ; and one said, " it wor like a rabbit equeaffnV 11 Happen it wor th' ghost," suggested Jemima. The_ women, now terrified, ran into their .i „ - n-..- :\ker, who saito, f-,.rth' life -j h- i.

And - the evidence of the soundness of their belief was in the future character of their lives. The " Jolly Fanner " never saw them within its walls again. Both Tim and Dick became "religious," and m&Dy; and Sarah «nd Mary Womersley weie made alt the happier for the change iu their husbands. Dick would say to any one who tried to chaff him about the ghost, " Tha may say what tha will, bu I know what I Bc,ed, an' if tha only seed th1 same tha'd shut thy mouth an' say no more about it.'1 It Was the opinion of some people that the ghbst" was no other than Billy NnttalTs -old white horse that had strayed out ofthe field into the lane.
