HIGH RANGE. Dull drizzling weather 1ms again set in, which is not suitable for tho farmers just now, as some of them intended to com mence haymaking this week, that is with tho early portions of their crops. Tho main portion of tho crops will be left standing till after Christmas. Tho public schools have closed for the Christinas holidays, and the worthy teach ers intend going homo to spend their holi days. Tho cliildern are delighting thom solves at home, where they are getting up to all sorts of mischief, and their mothers no doubt already wish them back at school again. I have often heard pooplo saying that they have seen ghosts, and I have boon a bit of a believer in tlipm myself, but I am now fully convinced what sort of ghosts do exist. Tho other evening I visited a friend's place to have a chat with the girls ; how ever the time passed away raLher quickly as I thought. I suppose most of us are aware how time passes on s>ich occasions. When I enme to make a start for home it was very dai lc, but I went along slowly for some littlo distance when to my surprise I saw a real live ghost on the middle of the road, robed in white and shining in the darkness. And didn't my hair stand on an end, and didn't the big drops of perspiration come wet on my forehead. I am sure you can imagine how I felt. After some time had elapsed I plucked up a little courage, got a stick, threw it, and with a good aim it took effect. And while this was tailing place I stood stricken down with fear, thinking every moment it would be over with mo. But to my great surprise what should spring from the road but a white horse, and went dashing through the bush as if greatly surprised. I then went heme greatly relieved to get rid of the ghosts in that woy, but not now a believer in them.
