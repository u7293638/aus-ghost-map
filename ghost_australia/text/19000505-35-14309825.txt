THE CYCLORAMA. The Cyclorama continues to be open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, and full lectures are delivered at frequent intervals on the "Crucifixion." A series of clever illusions are also shown. Mr Paul Ferris will, to-night, give an entertainment in the lecture hall of the School of Arts, in which he will include a "dark seance " with mysterious cabinet and "ghosts." A new slate trick will be a feature.
