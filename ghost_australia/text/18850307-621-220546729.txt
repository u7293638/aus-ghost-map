I Crossing the tan the favourite was well in j front, with Uralla, on the outside, next, and j Antonio third. Opposite the carriage paddock the favourite appeared to have the race in I hand, but Uralla came up, and as Hales was j only capable of a feeble resistance, the filly I beat her stable companion by half a length.

Without any delay the quartet were sent on their journey to a good start, the colours of Mozart being the first to show in the van, with David and Silver King following, and Tre mando last. Passing the stand Mozart was iteadied, and David took up the running, with the favourite at his quarter. Rounding the turn Silver TCirtg took command, and though he ran out wide at the river side, and let David up on the inside, he maintained his position | past the bridge and along the back, just clear | of David, the pair being some distance in advance of Mozart, while Tremando was still toiling in the rear. At the abattoirs the pace was improved, and the field closed up somewhat, but at the sheds Silver King still held a slight ad van - age of David. Approaching the home turn Tremando made his effort on the outside, and as the four swung into the straight, he was well on the leaders. Below the carriage paddock Braithwaite called on Mozart, who answered gamely, and passing Tremando, joined issue with Silver King and David. Fcr a moment the result appeared uncertain, but at the distance it was «fwn that Silver Kim? was going well within himself, and despite that David and j Mozart made a gallant effort, the favourite I ran home a comfortable winner by a clear I length from David, Mozart was close up next, I and Tremando last.

After indulging in the customary parade, the thirty runners slowly wended their way down the straight, an'd look up their positions at the starting post, Surrey, being on the extreme inside, with Amelia Victoria next, Garfield, Mascotte, and Leporello being in the centre, with Duenna and ' Mistake on the outside. Some difficulty was experienced in getting them away on anything kkb even term3, and it was not until the third attempt that the word waB finally given to go. Save that Velocipede and Mistake were left some distance in the rear, the start was a moderately good one, Duenna obtaining a Blight advantage, closely attended by Prome theus, Middlemarch, Salvo, Alphabet, and Coronet; Amelia Victoria, Mascotte, Sir Garnet, Battalions, 'and Lavington holding prominent positions on the inside, while Garfield, Sheet Anchor, . and Blink Bonny showed well forward in the centre. On tbey came, each horse doing its best to outstrip the other. Crossing the tan the colours of Town Moor in the centre were most conspicuous i with The Ghost, Hannibal, Mascotte, and j Prometheus close up. Entering the straight Westbury momentarily shot to the front, but he 6oon retired, and as they neared the carriage paddock Mascotte was leading, with 'Blink ' Bonny and Battalious I almost in a line with her, -the other division I being led by Amelia Victoria. Middlemarch. Coronet, The Ghost, Coningsby, and Leporello, Velocipede being a long way off last. At the distauce Cracknell called on Coronet, and though he appeared to swerve he soon got to the front, and easily stalling off the resolute effort of Middlemarch, won comfortably by three quarters of a length. Sheet Anchor was third, half a length away ; then came The Ghost, Leporello, Sir Garnet, and Blink Bonny, in the order indicated, with Mistake and Velocipede last. Time, lmin. 19£sec.

Although the autumn meeting of the Victoria Racing Ulub does not arouse t e same general interest which attaches to the more important events decided at Flemington in the spring, the occasion of the running of the Australian Cup is always looked forward to with pleasant expectations by a large section of the sporting public. The gathering, which was continued on Thursday at Flemington, was a great success, the attendance being larger than that of any previous year, while the weather was delightfully fine, and the racing more than ordinarily interesting. The arrangements for the conveyance of visitors to the course were carried out with praiseworthy completeness, and special trains were despatched from the Spencer street station to the racecourse platform every few minutes. The road out was invested with many of its characteristics, and -several well-appointed four-in-hand drags and ; other stylish equipages were seen bowling merrily to the scene of action. The course was in excellent order, ©vu4 tLa ta«m lrmlrAr) Knailfclfllllv frPftK and green. There was a number of ladies present in the grandstand, and during, intervals between the races the promenade was extensively patronised. Thfe racing commenced punctually with .the Hurdle Race, which resulted in a somewhat 1 easy victory for The Agent, with Hazard second, and Don Quixote third. During the race, Brenda, one of the competitors, fell at the second hurdle from home, and broke hetneck. Fortunately, however, her rider (M'Gowan) escaped -serious injury. Monte Ghristo had an easy task in appro priating the Sires Produce Stakes from Ring master. First Prince and Manchester, how ever, gave a special feature lo the contest by running a most exciting dead' heat for third honours. The Corinthian Cup -attracted a field of eight rnnners, Happy Thought, in the capable hands of Mr. VV. Glasscock, gaining the victory in the end 'from. Achilles. Much interest was displayed in the Australian Cap, and notwithstanding the acknowledged calibre of the djozeh competitors, the Newmarket Handicap winner, Ccfronet, left the paddock a very strong favourite -at evens against the field. The favourite ran well for about cwo miles, when he suddenly collapsed, leaving the issue to Ring wood, Storn away, and Sheet Anchor. The trio swung into the straight in close company, but by a well-timed effort on the part of Robertson, Ringwood gained the victory, after a gallant struggle, with Sheet Anchor and Stornaway. Coronet, who was very much . distressed, finished last. The Steeplechase was a chapter of accidents throughout, only three out of the nine starters completing the course. Corrigan, who rode the winner, Echo, was loudly cheered for the ready manner in which he mounted his horse after tbe animal had fallen at the fence opposite the carriage paddock. The meeting concluded with the Bourke Handicap, which was won by St. John, with Mascotte second, and St. Lawrence third.

After the usnal parade in front of the stand, the dozen starters took their posi tions at the starting -post at the back of the course, and at the first time of asking, Mr. Watson got them away to a capital start. Minerva, being the quickest on her legs, was the first to move, but when the Tot were fairly set going, the favourite cut to the front, and soon placed a distance of six lengths between himself and Sardius, his nearest opponent. Sheet Anchor and Helene were next, side by side, just clear of Welcome Jack, Hilltop, mid Minerva, David acting as whipper-in. Coronet increased his advantage somewhat as tbe straight was gained, and led past the stand pulling double, Sardius, well out, being next, and Helene following closely on the inside ; Ringwood was next; and Sheet Anchor, Brown and Rose, and Minerva almost in a line following, David still toiling in the rear. Along the river side the favourite, with his mouth open, still held stubborn possession of the van, several lengths before Helene, who had Hilltop at her heels, and Welcome Jack, acd Sheet Anchor together next, Ringwood meanwhile having dropped back last with David. At this point WelcomeJack stumbled and fell, bat continued rider Ires in the rate. Along the back Hilltop and Sardius made strenuous efforts to get up to the leader, but Coronet gallantly held command, Efog wood still acting as whipper-in. There was no material change in the order indicated as the field raced past the abattoirs, but as they seared the Binds Stornaway was seen to be threading his way to -the front, and, quickly gettiug . through, ahallenged the favourite, who suddenly ooltapsed, and tiring to nothing at the turn, feU back, to the rear hopelessly beaten.

Eimaworth 0 Betting : 2 to 1 agst Echo, 5 to I agst Mernder and Morven, 10 to 1 agst Pemberiey. Mernder took the initiative at the start, and made play past the stand and over the first fence, two lengths in advance of Clarence, Echo being next, and Morven last. At the second obstacle Beresford baulked, and though he was got over at the second attempt, ne again refused. Along the back Merpaer was still in front, with Echo and Clarence following ; then came Fictitious, Trickett, and Hector, Morven still being last. No material alteration in this order occurred until reaching the first fence in front of the stand, where Mernder and Echo fell, and Trickett and Hector baulked. At the next obstacle Fictitious came down, leaving Clarence with the lead. Corrigan quickly remounted Echo, and sent him in pursuit of the leader. Mernder was also ret going again, but he lost too much mound to enable him to get up to the leaders. Along the river aide Clarence was well in front of Morven, who was followed at some distance by the favourite. The top weight made play along the back, but at the sheds Echo got on tennis with him and Morven, and jumping the remaining obstables cleverly, entered the straight with a slight lead, which he increased in the run home to three lengths, winning comfortably from Morven ; Clarence was a good third, the others straggling in at intervals.
