THE MELBOURNE CUP. A Tip. Tlie flngis dropped, _ nnd onward speeds Each ono of tlie two and twenty steeds. I Post tlie stand tlicy sccin to fly, I Eneh rider determined to door die. High bent the hopes of the Tnsinnn men As Minstrel is seen lending tits vim j Hopes soon to lie melted like snow by tlie sun, For Waldock is nt liim, nnd Minstrel is done. And a cheer from the ring o'er the racecourse resounds, As, e'er the abattoirs ore reached, Poet com pounds. Then Frolic tries linrd, as the race becomes Hot, To cntcil the Itosc and upset tlie great pot ; Up tlio straight they now come, the Rose with the lend, And Riverinn hero proves the Riverinn indeed ; When n game little steed from the thick of tho brunt Brings Marshall's bright colours right up to the front ; And Musidora's black vest, as Frolic falls back, Hugging closely tlio rails, follows close on his I track. Side by side tbev coino on — 'tis a match 'twixt tlie pair — 'Twixt Wollnton's grey son and tho game little mare. But stop ! for tlie ring there still may be luck, As a pink jacket comes witli a rush from the ruck, And Victoria is catching them hand over hnnil ; 'Midst roars of surprise from the ring and the stand. But still struggling gamely, onward they come, When Cooke lilts his whip nnd Victoria has won. MORGAN'S GHOST.
