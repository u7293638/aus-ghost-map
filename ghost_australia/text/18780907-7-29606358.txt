The Advertiser SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1878. The report of the Chairman of the Desti-<*> tute Board for the half-year ended 30th June last, which appears in the Government Gazelle of September 5, shows that there lisa been an increase of destitution in the aggregate since tlie previous half-year. Butaithougii the total number of persons relieved during die six nondus, which was 2,370, shows' an increase of-48 persons as composed with tfiefmeviQite half-year, ii is less bj 12? femma tbaa in tbe correspond ing period of 1877. Mr.Solomoneoasiders this ia4ne to the fact-that newly-arrived immigrants have found work more readily than they did earjy in 1877j and this opinion is borne out by die returns, which show that the number of immigrant fami lies assisted during the half-year was only 13,representing a total of 58 persons. A painful feature in the returns is the large number of families who have applied to the Board for support in consequence of desertion on the part of die bread-winner of the household. The number of such families is no less thaa 73, representing 11 adults andSlOchfldren. As has been repeatedly shown by the Commissioner of Police in his reports, die crime of wife desertion is becoming far toe common in die colony, and Mr. Solomon urges die Govern ment to make some arrangement with the other colonies by which absconding fatiiers and husbands who have left this colony for Victoria or elsewhere in Australasia may, on die dwQoverj of their wberaabouts, be compelled by law to contribute to the support of their wife and children. Be <alfiO ' faints Out another cause of tike inarease of destitution which demands attention, and that is the custom which appears to have sprung up in the border districts of Vsctorieamong destitute pusons ef crossme; over into South Australia, where they in many in stances bacoaoe «, permanent burden to the State. In England them is a legal right of passing pumen, lkUs to become charge able to a parish on which they have no claim for support, to the one which is legally bound to provide for them at the expense of the bitter. It would be well if some similar power existed here of sending back pauper colonists to the place where, by domicile if not by birth, they have ac quired * right to be supported by the State. It is certainly absurd that South A-uatnlk should be called upon to give an asylum to destitute poor from Victoria. The number of adults admitted to the Destitute Asylum during the half-year was 170, and the number of inmates at the date of tbere|iortwas29s f asajninat297.iiitlie corresponding period of last year. The number of deaths, namely 40, is at first sight startling, but this high mortality is easily accounted for when the hospital character of the institution is remembered. Thus of the total number of admissions during the half-year 63 were patients dis charged from the Adelaide Hospital, and many others were persons brought d?wn from the country coffering- under incurable diseases. The effect of this state of matters on die death-rate is apparent, for 1C of the deaths were those of persons discharged from the Adelaide Hospital as in curable, SI of wliom died within a month after admission: while of the total deaths 32, or fully 80 per cent., were of persons between £5 and !K) years of age, who had been suffering for a long-time from illness; ani of the younger persons dying most were such as bad taken shelter in the Asylum when in the last stage of consumption or cancer. The Dumber of admissions to the Asylum is also augmented by the fact that there being no Maternity Hospital in the city, women who, in the poverty of Jtfaetr homes, canoot obtain the attention neces sary in childbirth seek it in the Asylum. The number of such admissions daring the half-year was &1, and six women received outdoorrelief under the same circumstances. It has been over and over again pointed out that a Destitute Asylum where patients suffering from complaints of all kinds are received, apart from its general concomi tantEandtbestifrmaof pauperism implied! v attaching to admission, is a most uu suitabk place for the reception of women daring, confinement, and we Oust before long that some of the benevolent ladies of Adelaide will take steps for the formation of a proper institution. The number of lying-in patients admitted to the Destitute shows that there ae ample necessity for it In addition to the patients reli<'rei in the Acylum, .SKI persons have bo?n re commended by tbt- Board to the Hospital as out- patients, aud 306 persons as in patients, while the Medical Officer of the Board attended 141 persons unable tocomo to the Hospital. The Board has likewise made provision for supplying medical attendance and medicine to destitute persons In country districts, and eight mo^ifl men are now paid for this purp-i- •. The number of interments provide! for during tb# half-year was 12!'. an increase of SO on the previous sir months, but two less than in the corresponding period of 1877. Mr. Solomon speaks with gratitude -?f the increased accommodation recently provided at the Asylum by the Ootemment: but point* out n serioje defect in the drainage of the building, which should bo remedied a« speedily a? possible. Hie number of children in the aciioolfi talonpng to the Hoard at the date of tue -report wai'Mft of whom 111 were in toe Industrial School. I? in the Boys' Itefur ffittoTT, asd 10 in the Oirls licforntatJrr. W the latter Mr. Solomon speaks despair ingly. It is true that there has been an improvement in the conduct of the girl*: but he well utpes that so Ion? as the Befor matorj is in its present position, and sur rounded by «nch influences as it uow i«. the efforts of the officers to briu^ alwuit any real reformation in their charges must prove futile. The matter is one demanding the serious attention of the iiovernment, n* a reformatory which only influences t!ie inmates for evil is worse than naaleaa. The number of girls placed out during the year was two; they wete put toaarriee. Hie number of f ■«??«— in the Boys' Re formatory has diminished by ten, and it is satisfactory to learn that the conduct of die boys generally baa bean very good. F<iur of the boys wen placed out during the half year, of whom one waa adopted and tbre« were licensed to farm service. The boys in the school are chiefly employed iu envelope nrV" Mc or in shoemaidug. Mr. Salomon again urges on the Gorenmient the neces sity of removing the Reformatory from th« neigbborliood of the Industrial School, a? the presence of the criminal boys produces a bad effect upon the other children. During the half-year 13 children from the Industrial &ohool; were licensed to service; 31 wete adopted without the Oovernmeut subnoy, nine With the subsidy, and one was apprenticed to a trade. The report speak* nuist faVoaably of the children in the school, and those placed out, now amount ing in the aggregate to 400, among whom there has not been a single case of serious illnes? -or of death during the half year. Satisfaction is also expressed with die hiiuiiMM? shown to the children by their foster-parents, and a high tribute of praise is given to the viators connected with the Boarding-out Society, who have been most unwearying in the discharge of their duty. Hie system of boarding-out these children has now been on trial in the colony for six years, and Mr. Solomon bean emphatic testimony to its happy and satisfactory results. Hie total number of visits paid during the half-year to children under the care of the Board was 355, and of the reports received as to the can duct of the children, all were good, and only one child had to be withdrawn in consequence of the unsatisfactory character of the persons to whose care it had been confided. Hie educational status of the children is on the whole satisfactory, especially in the Industrial School, and inmost cases the report? of (he educational progress of th children boarded out aa fawrsbla, The industrial returns an more satisfactory than uauaL The boot and shoe maldaw account of the Asylum and Refor matory has left a balance in hand of mom than £87; and since March, 1677, the Asylum and schools have in this depailiiifnit fully supplied them selves. The credit of tire dairy account is only about £34; a great falling oft, which is accounted for by the decrease in die production of milk and butter, and a fall m the inarhwt value of daose soticlsa. The savings of the diit&ren; amounted to aaon titan £95, and dte balance now in the Bawk in their favor exceeds £379, sometrhat leas titan in die previous half-year. A sum of neariy £22 was received tram other labor in the acboole and A«yiam than boot making, and 653 articles were aaaaufac- Uned^chieuy consisting of dotiuag. The amount reimbursed to die Government by relatives of destitute persons relieved was a little over £187. Tin report of the Royal Commiaswn oa the ftrtzadition of CriminaU, which baa recently been sitting in England, deals with a moat important subject, and is re markable from showing what a marvel lously rapid change of opinion has taken (lace within the past two or three yean, even among eminent lawyers, oa the aab jject. The report is fact contains reconunendatione which if carried oat will radically change the whole l*w of eztndjtion existing betweeu Eng land sad other coatftne*. Tbt aoces «ty for the existence of some system of enttadition hj wkico fugitive, lying from ptmishount b one country may be arrested in another, especially in thaee days of rapid and easy intercommamcaUoiL, is too obvious to require argument. It would be amply ■heard for example that an English criminal might hy a two or three hours' sail across the Channel place himself in a position where he might enjoy his 01 -potten gains free from any risk of punish ment by the laws be bad outlawed. Sach ?. state of inatlmwe^drisnpljtewitotlie vaet incwawt of cjime and ifce fonsatiasof asylums for escaped Mom of the moat ob jectionable kind. Bat while for many jeaxs pest the extasdi&m; of viiminah has bees nooniwsd by all mffiaed wations, juri?ta ban greatly differed as to the prin ciple by which the law on the •object eboold be governed, lie great ajmeulty always has amen from the jeiloaaka ex isting between the various nations, espe cially on the part of England, as to anv interference with home jurisdiction. Hence the principle hitherto has been that unless there is a special treaty existing- between the State from which the criminal has fled nnd that to which he has goae, for the surrender of criminals, the runaway could not be extradited. Further, it ha< been the practice in England to refuse to deliver up a British subject who, havinz committed a crime in a fonifrn country, has succeeded in escaping to England. It has leaf item obvious that both the prin ciples indicated, insisted on as they hare been by Eaplieh jurists especially, hav<? been productive of great difficaltiat. For example, until the last few years no extra dition treaty existed between England and Holland, and thus a journey of a few hour. from London placed a criminal is a place of perfect safety; and it is in this manner that the notorious little Republic of Andorra, is the IVreaee*. wen. until it was Utely aV porbed into Spain, a perfect nest of escaped felons from France and Spain, Again, cases have bees frequest is wliieli Itritisb subjects guilty of very serious offences in foreitm countries have escaped home, where either from their offence not being cognizable by the laws of England, or by some other legal technicality, they have sacceeded in avoiding the penalty due to their crimes. Other nations havin*r of course retaliated on Kngland in taia matter, a most absurd state of things has arisen. In order to show bow rid*Rtl«n« the principle of die non- surrender o? British subjects guilty of crime abroad is. it is only neceasary to consider the effect of carrying' it out to its legitimate conclusion, which would be tint all Englishmen arrested for crime in a foreign country, or foreigners arrested for offences in England should be aent to their native country to be tried. Another peculiar view of the Ur of extradition held by KnjrlUh jurists, which baa ionir given rise to much difficulty, and has on more than one occasion nearly plunged Eugland into vu, w that which holds that a crimi -I*l once extradited can only be tried in lln i imntTj rlaiminf, him, fin thr iiffi uri mentioned in the .application far hit sur render. The fallacy of tuck a principle has frequently been pointed out, and is obvious when it is casuidtisd that the charge on which the criminal ni extra dited may break down, and he at the- mbh time be guilty of a more serious offence, of which nothing waa known at the time of extradition, in which ease if the principle indicated he upheld the authorities wh<? claimed the felon would he estopped fr,?ai tiring him oa a charge which they kaaw they could prove without fin* giving him • chance of again namptng juatke by putting him on his defence on a charge which they knew could not he sustain^. Again, a difficulty has arisen by the En?li~h law requiring that if a foreigner, helng conveyed from one foreign country to another on a warrant of extradition, I* placed on board an English ship or landed on F-ngliah aoQ, he becomes ip#* fmtv free unless a mnut «f extftdition he applied for to the British authorities aad propar evidence be adduced. These various incon sistencies and dinicultiee th« eminent Uwyers who sign the report now recom mend the British Government to swasy away ; and a* among then axe th* Loci Chief Justice of England, Lord SelbonH, Lord Blackburn, and Sir James •ituphrii. the recommendations could not com* carry- ing a greater weight of authority. Their first proposal it to do away with the —rni sty for die <nirtence of formal tntatirw of extradition, and they do so on the groan! that the extradition of criminals ia bawd on international equity, aad that it is a right to which all nations an inherently entitled. They suggest that while the power of n—iri«g tynriil extaditiaa tiaaties afaonld be retained, that ia <^r>* where no such treataas exist there +**** be a peraiaHiro statutory power nstin^ with the proper aathorities to Mirnader a criminal daimed, by a foreign state.

The address was presented to Mr. and Mrs. Ford jointly, as a token of the esteem and regard in which tbey were held by the commercial tra vellers visiting Clam.

It was not the address itself he valued, so much as the names attached to it, which he would always remember, and be glad to look back on with pleasure in yean to come. He had always taken a great interest in commercial travellers, and had invariably done tbe best ke could for persons of that class. If it had not beeu for the Clare people, coupled with tbe commercial travellers, he would never hare been in his pre sent positien as proprietor of tbe fork Hotel.

I " Aladdin, the Wonderful Scamp" when ! well played, is one of the best of burlesques, i abounding in fun and drollery, but as pre sented at the Theatre Boyal on Friday night it was bereft ef much of its humor. We presume it was placed on the stage without aufficient rehearsal, because several of the leading characters were anything but perfect in their parts. The songs were not well sung, and the puns and localisms fell flat, and were unappreciated by the audience. The cast j was as follows:—Aladdin,MissljydiaHowards; I the Sultan, Miss Graham; the Vizier, Mr. i Martin ; Pekoe, Miss Maggie Knight; Abanszor, i Mr. Reynolds; Tee-to-Tum, Mr. Ocandleigh; Slave of the liunp, Mr. Forbes ; Princess Bad roulbadour, MissHatiiaway; Widow Twankey, Mr. Owen; the Genius of the Ring, Miss ; Featherstbne.
