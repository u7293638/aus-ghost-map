FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH. By wintry son's declining glow A wanderer found Modelled tn freshly fallen snow A cnrions mound. Was it the bumonr of the storm, Or Nature's jest, To mimic thus a fowl's plump form And rounded nest? Not so—for when the snowy mask He brnshed aside, A duck Bat patient o'er her task There—as she died. Huddled beneath the downy breast Sweet treasures lay, Which she with anxious care had pressed That cruel day. And brared long hours the blinding Bakes, The wild wind's moan, And crushing cold—all for their sokes, Her nestling own. No mate to cheer with voice or food— The last friend gone Sole guardian of a numerous brood, She still sat on. Nor ever in that bosom stirred Of doubt a ghost, - But. mother like, the simple bird Died at her post. Best well, fond martyr, lore endowed, With lore content; The whitest snow shall build thy shroud And monument. E. S., in the Sp*^ator. |
