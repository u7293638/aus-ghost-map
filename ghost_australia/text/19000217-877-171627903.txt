ONE ON 'THE JUDGE.' Rny Bean, the high judge of the courtB of Langtry, where justice is dished out to the living and dead alike in Judge Bean's own novel and distinctive way, was in San An tonio last week, on the occasion of which visit he was made tbe victim of a cruel practical joke, says the San Antonio ' Ex press.' Hemet a drummer at the hotel, who Baiil he had just come from Lanstry. ' Did you see my bear ? How is he getting nlnnrr ?' was t.lita liiHfiftfi'R firdt. miPKt.inn Judge Bean's bear throughout West Texas BtsndB second in fame to the judge himself. The animal was chained to a tree in the rear of the judge's beer saloon, and in its day drank many a bottle of beer at a coBt of 25c per bottle, to the edification of the wayfarer who was compelled to Bpend a few hours in Judge Bean's judicial district. ?' Didn't you hear of it ?' aBked the drum mer, ' The bear died last night.' The dummer had an old score to wipe out at Hoy Bean's expense, and he succeeded in convincing the judge that his bear was dead. Roy Bean lost no time in making for the telegraph office, where he penned these in structions: ' Skin the bear, and express the skin to me at once.' To thin he attached his signature, which is the law in Langtry. Bean's man at the saloon promptly killed the bear and expressed the skin, and in the letter that accompanied the fur was this note: ' We hated to kill the bear, and he hated to die. It took three shots before he gave up the ghost. We are now smoking the basons.' When Roy Bean received the .message he broke three chairs and then set out in quest of the drummer. The offender is Baid to be conducting earnest diplomatic negotiations by mail with ?? The Law of West Texas.'
