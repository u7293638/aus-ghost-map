FINANCE AND TRADE. Tuoidav Ereninff. The communication made to the constituents of the New Zealand Loan and Morcantilo Agency Company by tho general manager in Australia, Mr David Elder, through the me dium . of our colamna this morning, oannofc but bo regarded by all interested othor than satisfactory. Granted, that the details of a scbome of reconstruction, based on principles which insure something like absolute security in the future, havo taken a somewhat longer period than was expeoted to work ont, it must be admitted that its perfeotness in completion fully justifies tho delay. Tho company, under the accepted scheme of reconstruction, will bo in possession of funds for the working of its business largely in excess of any othor institution carrying on business on the same lines. This is plainly shown in the following figures ; — Capital (paid up), £1,380,000; capital (dobeuture stock, perpetual), £4,500,000, making au aggregate capital of £5,830,000, all of which cnu be safely employed in tho business of' tho company, soeing that its oroditor havo accepted debouturo stock (perpetual), in full set Moment of their olniins. Whilst the capital at the disposal of tho company has been so largely increased and placed on such a satisfactory foot Ing, the interests of the consignors of wool, whoat and other produce, have been further proteotod by the inclusion of the following olauso in the memorandum of association of the new company : — To sell or otherwise deal with ou commission any live and dead stock, wool, or othor pastoral, farm or agricultural produce, or any merchandise or other property of any description, upon any terms as to remuneration or athorwlso that may seoin expe dient, and particularly upon terms whereby the po- porty in question and tho net proceeds or balance of net nroceuds of any sale thereof or othor dealincs therewith, or any property representing tho same are to be hold by the company as trustees for tho special account and on tlio special behalf of tlio principals, and are not, oxcepc to the extent of tho company's beneficial interest therein, if any, to bo in any way subject to any obligations, debts, or other liabilities of tho company. This elfeotually places the constituents of tho New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency out side any possible risk, and must doubtless tend largely to secure a continuance as well as tbo extension of its largo business done in tho prist Perhaps tho most grntifying portion of Mr. David Elder's letter is that which refers to tho loyalty of tho company's constituents during a period of exceptional difficulties, and this it may bo taken is tho very best ovidenco obtainable tbftt in the futuro the oonflder\co shown in the management of their affairs by the company will be fully sustained. Considering the impor tant position the New Zealand Loan and Mer cantile Agency Company occupies in Melbourne it is a matter for sincere congratulation that it has placed its business for the future on such a sound footing. Our cable message this morningfrom London announces that the Stoolc Conversion and Investment Trust Limited have under conside ration a scheme for purchasing the deposit receipts of tho reconstructed Australian banks to the extent of £2,000,000, and converting them into marketable stock. Our looal banks, it need hardly be said, have nothing whatever to do with the proposal, and the details of the scheme, so far, are not sufficiently known for any opinion to bo given as to how it will influence our finanoial position. If it is tho intention of tho trust to purchase tho deposit receipts and oonvcrt them into per petual stock undor arrangements with tho banks, naturally tbe movement would bo of very considerable benefit to all tlio institutions, as it would relieve the necessity of building up heavy reserves to repay the enrreut deposit re- coipts as they fall due. If, ou the other hnud, it is simpiy a speculative business which would mean, so far as the banks aro concerned, merely tho transfer of the receipts from A. to D., no re lief in the direction indicated would be experi enced, though the pooling of £2,000,000 worth would doubtless have an improving influence on the market value. The Stock Conversion and Investment Trust Company has a subscribed capital of £1,000,000, its issues include London and North- Western Railway 3i percent., Pre ference Stock, 1st chargo.; do., do., 4 percent., 2nd charge; and Norch- Easteru 3 per cent., 1st charge, preference etock. It may nddod that the idea by tho Stock Conversion Company io by no means new ; indeed, proposal of a somewhat similar character were made some months since by local stockbrokers, but theso failed to bring about satisfactory results. Whether the pre sent scheme will bo more successful remains to be proved. It would appear that tho move ment, this time, comes from n section of tho holders of bsuk deposit receipts in England, aud this, doubtless, accounts for tho omission of tbo names of some of our institutions from tho list. If tho sohemo receives support it will bo doubtless extended to include all Australian banks who havo Enelish deuosifcors. Somo short time since attention was direoted in this, cohimu to the intention expressed early iu 1893 by the Trosumrer to obtain informa tion as to the practicability of converting and consolidating our Government loans into a per petual stock, bearing intorost at the rate of 3 per cent. The unfortunate financial crisis which occurred -last year naturally had tho effect of stopping any negotiations in the direetion re ferred to, hut it is satisfactory to learn that Mr. Garter is again giving his attention to this im portant matter. The figures given in onr issno this morning indicate the largo annual saving whioli oonld be effected in a diroction which presses at tho present time very heavily on tho community. Tho Treasurer's estimate that it would mean a difference of no less than £286,866 yearly in tho amount to be provided to pay the interest on our foreign loans is toojj/n portaut to bo ignored, whilst we get rid ' of tho necessity of periodically having to provide large sums to meob loans falling due. As stated last week, the position of tho London money markot is highly favorable for loan conversions ; and wo havo tho late experiences, both of France and Russia, na ovidenco that tbev can be oarried out on satisfactory terms. Of course tho details would have to bo worked out, and tho conversion carried through by the finanoial agents of tho Goverumout in Lon don, and thoir experience in this direotion would tcml largely to its success, if opinons aro favorable. A caution has been received from London to day that greater care is necessary in selecting properly seasoned boxes for the packing of but ter for export. The shipment, per XL M.S. Orient, it is said, contained a number of boxos made from unseasoned timber, and this has affected the quality of tbo butter. The shipment of cheese, per steamer Thermopylae, has, it seems, arrived in a partly melted condition, which is extremely unfortunate, as tho London market, according to our latest advices by mail, was favorable for making sales at good prices. Messrs. John M 'Nairn and Co., writing uuder date of the 11th ulfc., say : — Thero is nothing very fresh to report as regards local trade during the past fortnight. Wo would call attention specially at this thue to the fact of the Canadian and American cheese season closing at high prices, and this will havo the eiVect of main Uiiuing the present good pricos that are being made for the colonial article. The bacon markot is some what easier, the value of long cut hams, lb lb. average, being 60s. to 52.; Cumberland cut bacon, 33-44 lb., 36s. ; square shoulders, 16 lb,, 37s. 6d. Butter : Sinco our last prices have declined all round. Colonial is very dull, and sellers are pressing sales. Banish to-day is offering freely at 90\. to 96sm and buyers aro inclined to give It tlio preforencc. New Irish is being offered from dif ferent markets. Cheese : Canadians, for which there has been a good demand during the past fort night, aro now newly cleared. Colonial : The last arrivuls have met with a ready salo at from 58s. to 60s., and buyer are now anxiously waiting tho next arrival, when we look for a further increase in prico. It would seem from our latest cables that the " free wool " party in the United Statos Senato have carried their point, and that the oauouses have arranged that on and after the 1st January, 1895, raw wool will be admitted free. It must not, however, be forgotten that the free list, which forms the final sobedule of the Tariff Revision Bill baa yet to be debated and passed by the Senato and the various amendments made by that body in the bill approved and passed by the other branoh of the Legislature. The amendments introduced and carried in both Houses have been so numerous that, according to the best informed writers on the spot, until the bill is printod as finally aoceptod it is impossible to arrive at a correct conclusion as to how the tariff will stAad in the future. When the debate was oponed in the Senate, Mr. Yoorhees, who had chargo of the bill, stated that tbe eontemplated reductions in duties were as follow : — On chemicals, 1,000,000 dol.; on pottery, 1,900,000 dob; oh gloss, 1,500,000 dob; on metals, 12,500,000 dol.; on wood, 300,000 dol.; on tobacco, 3,300,000 doL; on agricultural products, 3,300,000 dol.; on spirits, wines, &o.;, 1,500,000 dob; on cotton manufactures, 3,450,000 dob; on flax, hemp and jute manufac tures, 6,000,000 dob ; on woollen manufac tures, 23,500,000 dob; on silk manufactures, 3,500,000 dob; on paper and pulp, 300,000 dob; on sundries, 2,450,000 dob; transferred to tho free list, 12,170,000 dob; total, 76,670,000 dol. How far theso amounts have been influenced by subsequent amendments remains to bo seen. Our conte:i(;. ' in the past has been that the revenue receh from tho Customs House was influenced more by tho contraction of the pur chasing power of tbe oommunity than by ibe increased duties imposed by the Shiels Govern- meut. It was also contended that the over imports of previous years had overstocked the market, and that shipments would be curtailed immediately it became evident that tho exceptional demands of ths boom period had ounsed. As a fact we know in addition that our fiuancinl troubles last year rosulted in large cancellations and reductions of orders for goods sent to Europe. These influences all combined to produae an immediate effect on the receipts of tho Custom House and free-traders with more haste than discretion immediately rushed to the conclusion that it was to the higher duties the falling off was to be ascribed. It is evident, however, that this assumption was hosed upon incorrect ground, for with tho slow, but stead', improvement in our financial posi tion during the past six month wo again havo a gradual expansion of tho Custom Houso re venue, as will be seen from tho following official figures : — — Duties Paid. Duties Paid. 1893 1834 January £149,325 £169.282 February 171,114 170,931 March 152,679 159,056 April 133,577 166,867 May 125,492 153,402 June, to 18 .. .. 68,779 102,601 £800,966 £927,142 Some notice has been taken to-day in wheat circles as to tho differences which exist in tho published estimates of the availablo surplus still iu hand. A little examination of the figures will, we think, prove that tho calculations of this journal are fairly reliAblo, notwithstanding they are something like 30,000 tons in excess of the quantity acoepted as the surplus by a contemporary. Take, for instance, lilt) quautily uf glum tluiad »l tub up country stations. On tho 16th inst. the official returns showed 737,390 bags in all at the stations. As tho largest returns are from sta tions in the wheat growing distriots, namely, tho Wimmero, Donald, Wychcproof and Oonl- buru Valley, it is self evident that a very large proportion of the stocks consist of wheat. If, therefore, we oompute the latter at tho low figure of 500,000 bag, or, at 9 bagB to the ton, say 55,555 tons, and add to this tho well estab lished fact that farmers have considerable stocks stored outside the stations, we can only arrive at one conclusion, after making a proper allowance for the quantity of wheat and Hour held in Mel- , bourne, that our estimate is substantially con firmed by official figures, which aro published weekly in all the papers. As to the Melbourne stooks, they are readily arrived at by deducting the exports and weekly consumption from the return of arrivals furnished by the Railway department. Business operations to-day havw been of a limited oharaotcr, but still to meet Mio demands for consumption the inquiry is fair. Wheat re mains firm, though the latest sale of a cargo of South Australian per Santiago shows a .drop to 23s. l£d. par 480 lb., c.i.f., but here it is possible that the quality of tho sample may have had something to do with tho lower price. At our auction sales this morning little was done, in consequenco of returns being in advance of bidders' reserves ; 817 bags in all submitted, of which 57 bags sold to sample at 2s. 2d. Privately market closes hardly so strong, hut sales of about 3000 bags have beou made at 2\. 3d., At which rate tho markot stand, flour has a little more inquiry, and sales of stone mado are mentioned at £5 5s. to £5 7. 6d., and roller dressed at £5 10. to £5 15?., the usual advanoe paid for bakors' lots.
