finance and trade Tuesday Evening, Tbe discussion on Mr. Chamberlain's sugges tion that steps should bo taken to draw closer together the trado intervals of the British Em pire and its oolonics discloses some interesting illustrations of gradual changes of opinion on fiscal questions. The desire for this closer con nection, remarks the leading orgau of the Lan cashire textile trade, is universal. Admitting that tbe difficulties are great, owing to the dif ferences of opinion ai to the best meanB to be adopted to ensure such a result, the journal referred to goes on to say, "The most difficult person to deal with is perhaps the pure free trader, who is so onnmored of tho theory that he has transformed it into a fetish for worship." That free-trade in its earlier inception, by the free introduction of raw materials into Great Britain, did muctr to expand her ex port trado is recognised ; but at tbe same time it eannot be overlooked that at tho period referred to she was almost without competitors. Tbo textile organ on this point says " It greatly helped our exports for tho first 10 or 15 years, but after -that it gradually beoame less and less ; aud to-day, it is generally ad mitted that whether the present system ia or is not an advantage is a disputable point," and, it is added, that now it becomes the duty of the free-trade fetish worshipper to re-examine his position. Coming, as these comments do, from Manchester, the birth place of Cobdenism, tbey indicate at loast that a very marked change is taking place in the opinions of the Lanca shire manufacturers. Doubtless, the now keen competition of other European States for tbe world's trade has a good deal to do with this alteration of views. A short time sinee rcferenee was made to the prospects of Japan offering a markot for'Austra- lian wools. The duty on wool, it was then stated, was removed on the 1st of April, aud already steps are being taken to extend the wool spinning industry. According to the latest sta tistics, the valuo of the woollen goods manufac tured in that country during last year (the Senju woollen mill owned by the Governraentexcepted), amounted to 1,194,632 dol., including 647,089 yards of flannels, 143,083 yards of broadolotbs, 133,023 sheets of blankets, 170,642 bales of woollen yarn, 71,445 yards of serges and tweeds, and 28,256 shoots of rugs. In 1894 the value of woollon goods produced aggregated 871,290 dol. The principal woollon mills are tbe Tokio Woollen Oloth Manufacturing Company, tho Osaka Woollen Yarn Company, the Osaka Blanket Weaving Company, tbe Nippon.tWool- len Cloth Company and Mr. Goto's wool weav ing mill. The improvement of late in the position of tho banking outlook in these colonics has been recognised in London. Our latest mail, advices state that, referring to the rise in value "amongst Australian banks, the shares of the Bank of New South Wales have been in demand, and a moder&to; advance has takon place, one of tho other leading banks, the Bank of Aus tralasia, also improving. A satisfaetory develop ment is the now departure which the National Brink of Australasia and the Bank of Victoria arc taking in realising some of their deposits. As usual in such cases the confidence of deposi tors increases so much that they refuse -to take away their deposits." With the final accept- anco of tho Commercial Bank's sohemo of re-arrangement, still further improvement'may be looked for, as it will remove the last element of uncertainty in tho Australian bankiag out look. It is gratifying to hear that the Metro politan Board of Works, the Harbor Trust and other public bodies interested will support the sobeme. Our latest cableB indicate that tho with drawals of gold from tbe United States Treasury oontinuo to be excessive. Aooordlng to our message this morning £1,600,000 has been withdrawn, whilst a great fall in securi ties has occurred in "\V"ali-street. The gold withdrawals are doubtlcrs duo to the scare in conncotion with the silver question, and this lias induced not only shipments of the precious metal, but possibly local hoardings to a large extent. There is justtheposaibility that thcscare has been magnified to suit certain market mani pulators. The Statist remarks on this point : — "By very olever strategy ibo siNeritos liaTo caught the gold bugs napping and have givon them a fright. It is doubtful, however, if they can make anything by it for tliemsolrcs." Ono safeguard ngainet a bad scare, romarks tho same journal, is the miserable lovol that throe fourths of tho American soourtios have roducod themselves to, and tho further fall now an nounced may possibly be tbo result of further market manipulations. Thoro can be no doubt, if the reports in the English press aro eorreot, that tbo silver men aro either used, or their leaders aro, in touoh with the big Wall-street operators, who hope to raako huge profits whioh- ever way the oat jumps. Mr. Bryan's candi dature may be another device of tho wire pullers. Still, it must be admitted that, though the chances of Mr. M'Kinlcy's opponont aro ro- gardod as hardly worthy of consideration, tho enthusiasm of the west and south States for silver is having a very bad effect on tho Amori- can trade. Tho position of uncertainty has not only checked local enterprise, but has tended to enormously contract purchases and orders eont abroad for foreign goods, whilst at tho same time it has sensibly restricted orodit. Coming at this juncture, when matters seemed shaping f nvorably for a revival in the world's trade, it is a matter for general rogrot, as tho Atnerioau markets have an enormous infiusnoe on com merce. In our issue of Friday attention was dircotcd to tho feasibility of opening a trnde with the British pickle manufacturers, by exporting cauliflowers in brine. This system, it was pointed out, ia largoly followed on the Con- . tincnt, tho English firmB drawing tho bulk of thoir supplies from abroad. From in- i quiries made, it is clear that at the present time the loeal production of this vegetable is so large that, in some instances at least, tho price obtainable in the Melbourne market is not suffi cient to to repay the cost of cutting and oarriagt to town. Under such conditions, it might be suggested that the Market Gardeners' As sociation might go to the cost of a cable mes sage to London for tho purpose of finding out if thero is a market there for cauliflowers in brine for piokle making. The initial cost wonld be small, and if the reply is favorable, might open up a trade which would absorb tbo prossnt surplus supply, and induce better results from looal sales. Although the opening of tho tea sales in con nection with the first shipments of tho new erop from Foo Chow has lost somo of its in terest, owing to the competition of Ceylon and India, still it forms a feature in our trade, Tho accident to the steamer Tsinan will delay the date of the first sales in Melbourne, but hor advices hare been forwarded from Brisbane. Mr. F. Cave-Thomas, writing from Foo Chow on the 27th June by the Tsinan, reports as fol lows — The throe weeks intcrvoninc havo been tho quietest wo have ever experienced during a cor responding date of the aoason, and characterised by a spirit of caution hitherto unknown among buyers for all quarters. It appears at last to be recognised that the export must be Rent forward in quantities more in accord with tho altored con- cutions ruling upon consuming markets. During the week following the departure of tho first London, stoamor on 8tli Juno transactions were on a very small scale, and nothing of any importance transpired until buyers 1or Australian entered tho market on 17th June, and then only reluctantly and with caution. Since that date business has con tinued, though upon a moderate scale, on a basis of quotations showing very good value all round, noticeable in fine grades especially, prices for which are many taels under last year. Tearnon are losing heavily, and thero is a feeling of panic among tho weaker hongs. Losses, though severe, have como too late to iniluonce production of "flret crop loaf alrendy packed, but it is considered pro bable that the secoud crop will be 60 per cent, short of last season. Stocks aro for tho moment heavy, and, though further concessions may ho difficult to htain, it would appear likely that teamen have still to face a further loss on a great proportion of dusty and undesirable toas passed ovor by buyers, and which must meet with a lower market. Really useful, desirablo teas are not in over supply, and havo been already well picked over. Common teas are in no demand. The cargo of steamer Tsinan is reported to be 800 tous less than last year's first steamer to Melbourne. The steamier Guthrie takes 3000 tons less forSydney, The above represents a serious falling off in tho supply available on the Mclbourno and Sydney markets ex first arrivals, whilst it is not at all prob able that the next steamer will carry anything approaching last year's quantity. Exchange : 2s. 2jjd. for 4 months' sight hank credits. Freight to London, 40s. per ton ol 40 cubic feet ; to Sydney and Melbourne, 40a. per ton of 40 cubic feet. The arrivals to date are as follows ; — 1896-97 : Half-chest8coiigou,390,000;half- ohestssouchong, 94,000 ; half-chests Oolong, 19,500 ; boxes scented teas, 9000 ; chests pekoo, 5600. To tho same date for the season of 1895-96 tho arrivals were : Half-chests congou, 390,000 ; half-ohests sou chong, 72,500 ; half- chests Oolong, 13,000 ; boxes scented toas, 9000 ; Ghosts Pekoe, 4600. The settlements arc smaller than last year, and hcnco the stocks hold are larger. Cable advices state that tho shipment to Melbourne by the Tsinan was largely increased at the last moment, and she brings about 2000 tons in all. The July issue of the Australasian Insurance and Banking Record is to hand. Amongst the subjects dealt with is the New Zealand State Fire Insurance Bill. Tho artielc, it is stated, was written in advance of the issue of the pro- pond bill, and hence possibly the hostile criticism of the new departuro of State insur ance may be modified. The following announcement in a trade cir cular dated the 18th inst. has enured some sur prise in trade eirclcs : — "Companies in Liquida tion : Maffra Beet Sugar Co. Limited. "Walter James Anderson appointed liquidator. Volun tary. 17th June ; Claims to the liquidator at 59£WlUiank- strcet, Melbourne." As tenders were called for the plant and machinery, re turnable at the office of the company, ai above, on the 25th June, it must be assumed that the company has been reformed or reconstituted, and if so some explanation should havo been givon to the public. Trado continues somewhat quiet, but tbero is & very hopeful feeling expressed as to its imme diate future. Tbe season so far has been highly favorable both to pastoral and agricultural interests, and there is a good prospect that our exports, both of dairy pro duce and grain, during next season will show a very material improvement. Assuming that we have a good harvest, our railway reveuue will expand and a con siderable portion of the existing deficiency dis appear Gold mining in Victoria has and is making considerable strides, whilst the output of our ooal mines is now assuming proportions sufficient to add materially to the wealth of the colony. Aeoording to the figures pub lished this morning for the past six months, 110,166 tons have been raided, and the present six months will, it is anticipated, show a considerable increase. All that is now wanted to ensure the permanent prosperity of our coal fields is a ooast outlet entitlinir us to eater into the shipping trade. Already private onterprig is moving in this direction, and if successful it will have a very important biariog on the future of our coal trade. Wheat : There is little ohange so far in the market, and the trade showed no increased desiro to purehaso.

The bulk of the winter wheat was got in under favorahleconditious, and a wock of tine weather would now enable farmers to get a largo acroago of oats sown. Wheat ; Offerings have been small and intermittent, and merchants are experiencing difficulty at times i|l securing wheat wherewith to fill current ordersjjjho . demand is especially keen for Pearl and;Cus<iah,j and sellers find no difficulty in procuring .the full , market rates for either of those kinds.
