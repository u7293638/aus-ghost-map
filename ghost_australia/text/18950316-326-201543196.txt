. Spiritualistic Frauds, Mr Maskclync, in au interview which' appears in the " English Illustrated Magazine," gives the following account of how lie first began to suspect flie bono fides of spiritualism : â€” ' ' The first awaken- ing oi my niteresD in uie exposure ui spiritualistic frauds arose in this way. It was during my apprenticeship. Adja cent to our place of business there resided a man and woman who professed to effect cures by mesmerism. About that time table-turning became :a fashionable amusement, and the Fox family had startled America by a second edition of the Cock-lane Ghost.' Well, these mesmerists commenced to hold spiritual- lafcie seances, and one day the woman brought to "our shop- what she called-a surgical appliance to be repaired. It con- sisted. of two levers, a long one and a short one, each: mounted upon a pivot attached to a strap, and connected by a piece of catgut. As you may suppose, I en tirely failed to seewhatkind of surgical ap-. pliance this thing cou'd he, and wascurious to discover ' its real use. Having re paired it, I devoted a few minutes to experimenting with if, and found that by buckling the strap of the short lever round the left ankle, and that of the long lever round the leg just below the knee, by pressing the right heel upon a projec tion at the side of the short lever the long one could be jerked up and made to strike the under-side of the table. Accord- ingly, x uooicea it ns a taoie-rapping apparatus, and the bill was sent in Re pairs to table-rapping apparatus, Is. 6d." This I considered very sharp on my part at the time ; but it was about the worst thing I could have done, as it pre vented a complete exposure of these im postors being made. Although several persons, at my suggestion, attended the seances afterwards, with the object of catching the lady red-handed, no tabio- rapping was ever attempted. This was a lesson by which I profited, greatly in my subsequent investigations."
