In the matter of weather the Natimuk folks were as fortunate as any of their neighbors at the various district rare meet ings, as Wednesday was a beautifully fise, cool day, and -was the means of inducing a very large number of people to attend, visitors beirg present in large numbers from Horsham, Noradjuha; Goroke and elsewhere. In every way the races must be voted an unqualified success; there were good fields, the finishes were exceptionally brilliant, the management was good, and disputes were few. The secretary (Mr. Meredith) deserves a mend of praise for the courteous and energetic manner in which he carried out his arduous duties, and in his efforts he was ably backed up by the stewards. Mrs. Resel had charge of the booth and seemed to do a rooring trade. Appended are the results of the racing: FaME 'aS RACE, about :one mile; weight, 12st.

The ue latter (who has lately changed hands, being vi now the property of Messrs. Beard and at Sisson) was very fractious at the start, and D when the word "Go" was given, set to s bucking and unseated his rider (Ferguson). S In the front of jthe stand Avaline had the oi lead, but atthe back of the course Spider Ii assumed command, but the pace was too hot I and it was soon seen that the issue would be ri left to the favorites.
