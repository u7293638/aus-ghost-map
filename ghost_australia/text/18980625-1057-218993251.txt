DIFFERENCE IN CALVES. Anyone who has had much exper ience in raising calves has undoubtedly I Boon a vast difference in thom. omc ; aro dainty, and need coaxing in order i to get them .to eat. Tlioy never seem to be hungry. If thoso calvos live tlioy do not amount to much, says a writer in " Hoard's Dairyman," and not in frequently they mope around with no appotite, until finally they givo up the ghost entirely, "The other and more desirable kind of calf is always hungry. No matter how often you go to her stall, she is always look- ing for something to eat, always try- kâ€” ,.- . ing to catch hold of your clothing or your finger. Unless ono is exception ally wiso, this calf is apt to get an ovor- feoding of milk, on account of horvor- caious appotite, and bowel troubles on- suo. I've got such a calf at present, and it requires considerable firmness -to provont her getting more milk than is good for her. She seemod so hungry when a very littlo thing that tho cus tomary amount of milk was increased for her benefit, but it was mistaken kindness, for excessive luosoness of the bowels sot in, which was bard to check. We succeeded in bringing her out alright, howevor, on boiled milk in small quantities and plenty of raw eggs. I would like to know what is considered the best remody for scours, caused, of course, by indigestion, usually duo to over-feeding. It is quite a nieo mat ter to decide, just tho amount grad ually, -as they can bear it. Over feed ing is more injurious than under-feed ing, and when wo bgII a calf wo always warn tho purohasor against feeding too much milk at a time. Thoso ac customed to short horns aro most apt" to err in feeding tho little' Jerseys. Hav should bo givon as soon as tho animal will pick at it, .and. ground oats and bran, in small quantities, can be fed to good advantage almost from the first.
