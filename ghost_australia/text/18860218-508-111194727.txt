jTIie Rosa and the Key, CHAPTER XXX.— A Visit. In t]^e morning Jjady Vampn was tnote than |in§naPy affectionate when she greeted Miss Max. When the little party met in the small rooni i'that qpegis ia$p the chapej, «r}ie,rei as we know. : Mr. Peoirhyn, the secretary, omciated at jnorniog , prayers, Lively V ergon acfrtajly 4*§-? her coneiji T^p.-prriiiig. t© her and kJB6edhar. ' Mafcingreparakon, I euppese,' thought Masi ; inilla. 'Putt-here was uo occasion ; I was. nob : i£ur£' ' '' ' ? ' ' '' i : And by fcke suggestion inval^ed in tbis unusual | 'dgnjonstrationj good Miss Max's fancy was started t pn §, ^Ud tour gf entertaining conjecture respeefc ! ing her reBerved cousin Barbara, and the possible ! bearing of that carious question upon the eensi ' bilities of the handsome woman of three-^nd-forty, ! 'Who had net yet contracted a single wrinkle or : gray hair ; and I am sorry to say that the : measured intonation of Mr. Penrhyn, the secre tary, as he dnly read his chapter from the First \- Book of Ghranibles, sonnded in her ears faint and far away as the distant cawing of the rooks. This 'morning service -was now eve*- and the little party gathered round the. breakfast table. Seen in daylight, jQap&|n Vivwin looked ill aad 'weak enough. He was not up to the walking, ridinjr, ^iQ ro^k pntdopr amusements of a country uouse. That was pls4|i. He must lounge in easy chairs or lie his length on a sofa, and be content, for the present, to traverse the country 'with his haadsome but hgggard eyes only. These eyes are blue, his hair light brown and gdlken, his moustache soft and golden. Jt is a Saxon face, and good looking. There is no dragoeaesy or swagger about this guest s he is simply a weJJ-bred gentleman, and, in plain clothes, as completely divested of the conventional soldierly manner as ^f he had nerer Btood before a drill-sergeant. . ' : 'Whetticr it is a consequence, of his illness I t^n't say, but he looks a little ead. In a. house now and then so deserted and always . pp quiet fts iLoydon; the e&joarn; of a guest go pn ezcepMonable, and also so agreeable, would have been at any time very welcome. . A little 'time ago, indeed, Maud might; have thought this interruption of their humdrum life . pleasanter. She had a good deal ngv to think u. ??'? ? ? 1 What ail inheritance of pictures yan have,3 -Eaid Captain Vivian. There is a seat outside the fvindow, and on this the invalid was taking his , ease, while Miss Max and Maud Vernon, seated listlessly within, talked with him through the j open windpw. ' I i^hink portraits are the most : glorious and interesting of all possessions ; I | jaean, of course, family portraits.' 'If one could only tell whose portraits they '»re/ said Maud, with a liyie laugh. * I know jLhoufc twenty, I think, and, Max, you know nearly forty, don't ypu ? And 1 dop?t know who knows the rest. There is a list somewhere; grandpapa made it out {believe. But they are not all even in that.' ' ' I look round on them with a vague awe,' he eaid ; ' artists and sitters, so ' long -deaii and gone ; I wonder whether their ghosts come baek to look , ;at their work agajn, or to see what they once were like. I envy you. sU those portraits. A?§a't you ; proud of them, Miss Vernon ?' » I suppose I plight to be,' replied Maude. ? I i dare say T should be if they were treated with a ? little more respect- But when one meets one's gaceetors peepiag from bebiad dooore, shoulder ing pne gaiptber for want of room in galleries and ? in lobbies, hid away in corners, or with their backs to the wall half -way up the staircase, they lose '; poinetjung of their dignity, and it becomes a little : hard to be proud, of them.' ' Such king lines of ancestors, running so far back inte perspective t' saidtlie invalid Janguiclly. I * Think of those who look back without a eingle i lamp to light the past. I knew a man who was -well born,' his parents both unquestionably of good family ; first bis mother, then bis father iiied, iyhen he wa§ but two years old/ Gaptaiii Vivian continued, looking down as he talked on the yeining ©f the oak seat, along which lie was idly .' running his pencil. ' His fate was very odd. He found himself with money bequeathed to .him by hie father, and with a guardian, who had hardly known that father, but who, I dare say half from charity, the father beiag en ids 4eath Ised, undertook the office. 01' course, if my friend's father had lived a little longer, the guardian would have learnt from his own lips all . particulars respecting his charge. Bat his death came too swiftly. There was no mystery in tended, of course; the money was in foreign stocks, and was collected and brought to England as the will directed, and neither he nor his guardian know as much as they would wish of the family of either parent. So there he is, quite isolated; a goed-natured fellow, I believe. It gives hi?' something to tbipk^ftiQut ; j|n.d Insure . |rou it is perfectly trug.

J In the meantime, agreeable Mr. Tintern has arrived, and Ms extremely pretty daughter has come with him. She and Maud kiss, as young lady friends will, with more or less sineerrfcy3 after a long absence. They make g. very ppe^ty contrast, the .blonde and the dark beauty, Miss Tintern having golden hair and blue eyes, and Maud Vernon largo dark gray eyes and brown Hair. . ' ' So these young persons begin to talk together, while 'Lady Vernon and Mt. Tintern converse I more gravely, a little, way off, on themes that in terest them more tiiaa flower shows, fashions, anjl ^*ie_com^ngbajl af Wymering. Cropd Miss Max, who, in spite of her grave ye#s, likes a little bit of frivolity, joins the young people, and has her laueh and gossip with them very cosily. Having disposed of the Wymering ball, and talked over the statue of Mr. Howard in the church a Jj#ie, an-|. passed . on to some county, marriages likely to be, and said a word or two on guipure work, and the fashions, Miss Max said : I ' I did not see your flowers at the Grange ; I'm told they are perfectly lovely. The shower came on, you know ; I was to have seen them.' * Oh, yes, it was so unlucky/ says Miss Tintern, 'Yes, I think they are very good. Don't you, Maudf ? ' Yes, wonderful,' answers Mau.d. ; ' t^hey throw us, I know, quite into the shade/ 'I think you are great florists in this part of the world/ says Miss Max. ' I thought I was very well myself j but I find I'm a mere noboiy among you. Ton have got, of course, that new Dutch hyacinth. It is so beautiful and so immense^wbite, and go waxes. What i§ its name, Maud ?' Maud gave the name of this beautiful mon ster, » ' No, I'm sure we haven't got it/ answers Ethel Tintern. ' I should have liked so to see it/ ; ' ; ' We haye pne/ say» Maud, f the last, I think, still in its best looks ; they are vesy Lite. I saw it in the next room. Come and see/ In the histories of a thpusand men, I suppose it has not happened six times, possibly in that of ten thousand' not half so often/that a' young man should be surprised^ ia a deep sleep, over a book, by two young ladies so beautirulj and in whose eyes, he wished, perhaps, to appear agreeable. When the young ladies had pushed open the door, they stood for a moment beside it talking, and then, twining in, Maud Vernon pointed out the flower they had come to examine. And, as they looked, admired, and talked, acci dentally her eye lighted on the invalid, as he sat in the window, one hand on his book, his book slanting from his knee, and be with closed eyes and head, sunk on his other hand, in a deep sleep. She exchanged a glance with her companion, and a faint smile and a nod. The young ladies returned to the drawing room ; and when they had left the room a very few seconds, the slumbering invalid, without disturbing his attitude, looked' after them curiously from the corner of his-now half-opened eye, and listened. Then he tewied his chair, sp as better to avert his face, and, without stirring, continued to listen. But they did not return. And as If r. Tintern proposed lunching at Hartstonge Hall,- he and his pretty daughter very sooh took their leave, and Captain Vivian watched them quietly from the window, as they got into the open carriage and drove away. ? What a nice girl Ethel Tintern is. I like her so very much/ said Miss . Max. 'Yes/ BaidLady Vernon, fbutl did not think her looking well, did you ?' 'Very pretty, but perhaps a little pale/ ac quiesced Miss Max. 'Very pale, indeed/ says Lady Vernon ; ' when she was going I was quite styiiok with it. Did you ever see her before, Mr. Daaref' ? ? ? - ' No/ answered that gentleman promptly from the recess of the window, where he was reading a note. ' ' I saw you. look at her a good deal, Mr. Dawe/ said Masdmilla, 'and I know you thought her very prat^y/ -'--??. ^ ? H'm !'? said Mr. Dawe oracularly. 'And I think she observed' your admira tion, also, for I saw her eyes follow you about the room whenever she fancied no one was look ing, and I think there is more in it than you intend us to understand, and that you are a very profound person/ * It's Mme I should be/ said Mr. Pawe, and the gong began to sound for luncheon as he spoke.
