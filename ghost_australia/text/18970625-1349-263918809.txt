Gmnox.in his History of Rome's decline and fall points out how the use of the hyphenated- surname (running sometimes to six joints , each a name of itself) was one of, tlie signs of tlie decadent times. Tlie use of such absurd . "monikers" is certainly (aisit omen !) a sign of the Victorian peiiod. AVe certainly haven't- come across a modern surname of six joints ; hut those with three ale not uncommon ; whilst occasionally one with four strikes the astonished eye ! Of three-jointed names here are one or two examples : — Bdker-Stallard- Penoyre ; .PJundell- Hollinsliead-Blttndoll and -Grech-Delicata-Cassia. Here is a four-jointed affair : — Hepburn-Stuart Forbes-Trefusis. All those names arc from a reeen.t .British Army- List. 'Another sign of the Victorian Epoch is the strange uso to which the word "function" is now-a-duys put. Every " muffin-worry " and " swa'rry " is now a function ! And a reporter who did not plentifully employ that term when fixing up his " copy " rc social chivoos would stand good chance of catching a wigging from his editor. 'Yqiu.-het. ' .1 ' ' Chief ' Jiustibe'jWay' (we must use the word,' you knolw) ', told .the Lon doners that "Judicial Federation had at, least been effected." Such at least;, are the words put by the cablegram mer in Ways tatur-trap. AVords, good reader, which (twixt.you, us and the post) moan absolutely nothing. HoYv can there be a Federation of Judges, when the law of England is one thing, and the law of any 0110 of the several British Colonies quite an other? Tlio fact- ' that one or two Colonial Judiciars have been attached to the Privy Council in an assessory character 110 more constitutes 'judicial Federation' (assuming that the term has some ghost of a meaning) than would tlie despatching of Butler to Eng land there to ho hanged along with the next convicted home murderer constitute " executive Federation."
