CHILDRENS* COLUMN. A DESPERATE FIGHT. [Ky PAUL HULL, in Harper's Tauug People.] One of tho most thrilling events in the history of military courage is that of Rorke's Drift, where less than J 00 English infantry hold their ground uguiust and ultimately defeated 3000 of the bravest and best dis- ciplined savages in King Otyweyo's army During thc Zulu war of 1879 two lieutenants (Rromhead and Chard), with eighty- six men under their command, were Bent out on a foraging expedition from their camp on thc Buffalo River. Two days later laden with thc spoils of their raid," they started back. While iiscending a hill over whioh the trail ran, titree columns, each composed of not less Ihau 1000 warriors, were aeen following up the spoor (track) nf thc soldiers. Against, Buch an agile and unencumbered foe Sight was hopeless. A place presenting such natural advantages for a stubborn defence having been observed but a short distance back, the little Íurty retraced its march and proceeded to ortify it with thc means at its command. The packhorses were killed to serve as the foundation of a barricade, and on top of them were placed the bags of mealies (African corn) with which they had been burdened. Before these crude defences could be entirely com- pleted thc Zulus, necessarily merged into one column of attack, owing to tho defile through which they were compelled to charge, caine swarming up the pass. " Aim low, and pour it into 'em, boys !" was tho order, and pour it into them they did. For several minutes the rush lasted, yet not a man appeared to advance beyond a certuin line. It waa like the horse in the tread- mill, who keeps continually moving, but fails to gain a foot. So it was with the Zulus, for the quick volleys mowed the head ranks down as though some mighty scythe in giant hands was swung with pendulum regularity across the path of the oncoming host. Soon between the fort and the enemy a new barrier com- menced to grow-a barrier of dead and dying men, up to which the marching companies advanced only to swell thc gruesome heap. Baffled and amazed, thc savage horde at length swung back out of range, but not for long. There was not a warrior among them bat knew full well that Cetywayo would put them to the spear if they came back defeated, so K was as well to die in battle a« to offer themselves a sacrifice to the contempt and passion of their chief. After a time those within thc entrenchment caught the far-away sound of an ominous murmuring, which presently swelled into the dreaded war cry the song those wild warriors sing only when they march to victory or annihilation. Then they appeared in their original formation of three columns on the plain beyond the mouth of the pass, their ox-hide shields across their breasts, and their great stabbing assegais (spears) held a little in advance. So they came on until they choked the entrance of the gulch ; then the two rear columns halted, aud the front one, crying, " Bulala umlungo !" (kill the white men 1) charged. Those who reached tbe human barricade threw down their ehieldB, through which tho bullets passed with case, seized the lifeless forms of their comrades, and continned to advance, sheltered from the fire of the soldiers by the bodies of the -dead. Many of the Zulus in this way succeeded iii reaching the foot of thc breast-works, but in order to leap the same they were compelled to expose themselves to the deadly fire of the brceohloaders, and although severa) of them gained the enclosure by vaulting over the barricade, it was only to be impaled on the glittering bayonets that fringed the wall. Again thwarted and amazed that their courasre availed them not, thc remnant nf the column retreated slowly and sullenly down the pass, some of thc Zulus halting every few yards in the midst of the fire, which continued to waste them away, to shake their spears al the little band. " We must make this wall higher, ladB," said thc officers, wheo thc last Zulu had gained the foot of thc hill ; " jump out here, and pile these bodies on." There was no lack of material, and in a short time thc barricade was raised so high that a number of thc dead were thrown inside to serve as a ptatform for the soldiers to stand on and Bight their rifles over thc top. Shortly after this the.sun went down; then thc soldiers knew that they would not bc again asaultcd until thc daybreak ; for the Zulus believe that at night the air is full of ghosts, and although they are, probably, thc physical superiors of any other rac«, and endowed with a courage which often ap- pro .ches the sublime, darkness bas thc effect of forcing them to give full rein to their superstitions fears, and so they gather in squadB around their little camp fires, finding comfort in companionship. After the night had fallen the question of retreat was con- sidered, but soon abandoned, for it was scan that to escape il would be necessary to gain the open country by stealing down and out through thc pass that was certain to be guarded well. So thc brave company took a pitifully small pull at thc precious liquid in their canteens, and after thc sentries had been posted, stretched theil- exhausted bodies on thc rocky floor, and with -fl. dead Zulu for a pillow, sought the rest that was to strengthen them for the desperate struggle on the morrow. Just before thc eastern sky began to pale, the soldiers were awakened,. ano none too soon ; for, thinking to take the garrison hy surprise, thc Zulus were to be observed creep- ing up the defile. A belching line of fire told them that their object was hopeless. Thu sun was over au hour high before ihcy made their first charge ; then, although killed, wounded, and Bwcpt back, they came up again aud nguiu, only, to be torn anil shattered by thc awful showers of leiden hail poured upon them from behind the bulwarks of their own dead. Throughout tho day every storming device known tu the men trained in carnage was adopted hy them, hut without success ; and when tile secoud Hight j carno on the Zulus could count the cost of their desperate valour hy tile hundred» of men who carpeted thc paBs. , During tile day thc soldiers, driven to it by ; the scotching lieut, had consumed the little water remniniug in their canteens, and now another long night wus ta pass without a drop lo muisteu their pai ched throats and cracked and bleeding lips. " Lieutenant," said one of them, " let me go and Hy to fill » few canteens. I may get through, and if I don't-why, then, I'll know I've done my duty." " No, no, mun ; if wc are to die we'll all die together," was thc answer he n-ceivcd. At last the morning carno and wore away.
