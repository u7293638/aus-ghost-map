LLOYD v. VICKERY AGAIN. It will be remembered (writes a correspondent of the Insurance and Banking Record) that the stations forming the subject matter of the cause celebre, Lloyd v. Vickery, which extended over so many years, were purchased about two years ago by the Namoi Pastoral Company. These proper- ties seem to be haunted by the ghost of litigation, for the Bank of New South Wales, to whom the Pastoral Company are heavily indebted, have ap- plied for an injunction to restrain the Australian Mortgage and Agency Company from disposing of the wool from the stations. This company pleaded that they had advanced on the produce before default had been made by the Pastoral Company, but the bank contended that by virtue of the mort- gage the whole of the produce was their property. The matter has been settled by the parties agree- _ ing to the Mortgage Company selling the whole of this year's clip, and placing the net proceeds to a trust account in the bank, on deposit for six months at 5 percent, per annum, or 4 per cent. if the money should be dealt with earlier.
