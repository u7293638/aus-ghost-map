MARONG. (1'ROH ODE OW.V CORRESPONDENT.) Tuesday, 14th October. Larrikixism.—It is certainly high time that the senseless aud mischievous vagaries of one or two of our local night prowlers were put a stop to. On Thursday night last, whilst some youm; ladies were proceeding to church for the purpose of musical practice for the Church of England Anniversary Servics, they were startled by the appearance of two objects in the foniH of men, who attempted to bar their pro gress. One of these fooliaii fellows was covered with a white sheet to give the appearance of the mythical ghost: and so alarmed were the young Women that their thrieks were heard for a long distance and one of them fainted. On the following mornirg it was found that a garden fence in front of Mr. Peter Dinner's residence hud been maliciously injured. The practice of turning on people's water taps when they are in bod, and otiier senseless aud annoying practical aeis <if foolish mischief, have surely now gone fa'-' enough. The local constable has beeu to Melbourne on strike business, and, if thi3 boyish freak of young or adult larrikins is not checked by the police, the perpetrators thereof may fare c\ea worse if caught in their evil praotices by the sufferers from suoh absurdities. Tnn Wkathkk and the Ckops.—Many of the paddocks on the Newbridge-road promise a beautiful yield. Cattle and horses are in prime condition. JIp. Josicrii Smith, of Leichardt, has re cently established a creamery at that place.
