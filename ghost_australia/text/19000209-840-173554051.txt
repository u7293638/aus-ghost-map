He stared round and round tho ii m a 1 1 apartment inn. manner which was distinctly strange. My . wife caught him ) up. She g lay down her knife I and fork. .. ; " You'ro sure of what ?" i Inglis seemed disturbed. He appeared . tin- \- willing to give a direct answer.- "Perhaps, 'after all, it's only a boinoiden'co." , ... , /. But Violet insisted. ''Whit is acoinbi- )-denco ?" ... : : Inglis addressed hiriiself to mo. , , : " Tho fact is, Millen, directly I canto on board I thought I hiid seen this boat before." I "But I thought you said that, you had '.never heard of tho Water Lily." .. . . ,. "Nor have I. Tho truth is. that when I . 'knew it, it, wasn't tho. Water Lily." " I don't understand." "They must .liavo. changed the name. Unless 1 am very, much rilistakbh this — this used to bo tho Sylph." : "The Sylph?", , n.'. , . ! . : "You don't mean to say that you have -never heard of the Sylph?". j..-., ... Inglis risked this, question in a tone of voice which was peculiar. i .. . .. . i " My dear feliow; I'm. not a rivpriim au- ' jthority, I am. not acquainted,. with every /houseboat, between Richmond .and, ..Oxford. . I It was .only at your, special rccotritrieridatiori 'thrit I took the Water Lily." i "Excuse me, Millen, I advised ri houseboat. I didn't specify, tho Water Lily." . :i Brit," asked my wife, "what was the I'jnatter .with tlio Sylph that she should so i iriysteriously have become, the Writer Lily ? " / Inglis fenced with this question in i . ) -manner which seemed to suggest a state of . ! mental confusion. . , , . ... . "Of course, Millen, Iknowthrit thdtsortof thing would not have tho slightest! influence on yon.. It is only people of a very different sort who would allow it to have any effect on tiiem. Then, . .after all, I. may. bo wrong. ! Arid, in any case,. I don't see that it matters.'.' "Mr. Inglis, tiro you suggesting that the ) Sylph was haunted ? " ... I " Haunted !" Inglis staffed., ".I never j dropped ri hint about it's being haunted. . So ' far as I remember I never heard a word of .-anything of the kind." Violet placed her | knife and fork together on her plate. She ! folded her hands upon her lap. i . " Mr. Inglis, there is a rriystery.. "Will you I this mystery unfold ? " ( "Didn't you really, ever hear about the \- Eylpli — two years -lgo?" _ j "Two years ago wo were out of England.?' \- "So you were. Perhrips that . explains it. > You understand, this mayn't . be the f Sylph. I niay be wrong, though I don't j think lam." Inglis glanced . uncoriifortably \- at thecbriirori which he was sitting. "Why ; I boliove this is the very ohriir on whioh .1 , sat. I remcmber noticing whrit ii queer shape ' it was." , - - I . It was rather an odd-shaped chair. For i that matter all the things on borird were odd. I "Then have you been on board this boat 1 before?" . "Yes." Inglis positively shuddered. ".I 1-was, oriee ; if it is tbe Sylph, thrit is." - He thrust his bonds into his trouser pockets. He leaned buck in his chair. A curious look ! came into his frico. " It is the Sylph, I'll j swear to. it. . It rill comes back to trie. What i an extraordinary coincidence! One might ! almost think there was something super- j natural in the thing." His manner fairly roused mo. ! "I wish you would stop speaking in I riddles, and tell us what.ybu'ro driving at." He became, preternaturilly solemn, j "Millen, I'm afraid have nutditi rather an l ass of myself. I ought .to , hiive , held my \- tongue. But tho coincidence is eitoh a strange > one that it took me unawares, arid sinco I \- have siiid so muoh I suppaso I mtiy as well say > more. After dinner I will tell you till there j is to tell. I don't think it's a story whioh . Mrs. Milieu would like to listen to." Violet's face was a study. "I don't understand you, Mr. Inglis; be- . cause you are quite well aware it is a principle . . of mine that what is good for ri hu-baiid to hear is good for a wife. , Como, don't bo silly; Let us bear whrit tho fuss is about. I daro say it's about nqthing, after ull." ' You think so ? , Well, Mrs. Millen, . yon shall hear." Ho carefully wiped his mous tache. He hegan : " Two years ago there wus a houseboat on the river called the Sylph . It belonged to a man nuiriod Hambro. Hb lent it to a lady and a. gentleman. She wus rather a pretty woman, with . ri, lot of fluffy, golden hair. Ho was a quiet! U11- usaiiiniiig-lookiiig. man, .who looked . as though ho hud soriiething tb do with horses. I mado their acquaintance oh tho rivor. - One evening ha risked mo on borird to dine. Isnt, as I beliovo, on tliia very cliuir, ut . .this very table. Three diys afterwards they dis appeared." "Well?" I asked. Inglis had paused. . ..." So far as I lcribw, hb nris hevor been sebri ! of heard of siiioo." , " And th'o lridy ?"..' . . "Some of us Were getting up a.picrii'o.

Still, I, didn't like. to say, nothing, because it might havo, been;, rind it, wash'. t ray place, to say that Iliad heard. But now I know that it wiis ghosts." . , ' , , Sho went. She wtis not to ho persuaded to stay, any .moro, than .Inglis. ., She did not even stay, to clear the table. I have seldom seen a woman in . ii greater hurry. As for wages, there was not a hint; of them. Staid, elderly, self-possessed female thousrh she was, she, seeined to bo in a perfect panio of fear. Nqthing would satisfy hor but that sho should, with thp greatest possiblo expedition, shako from fief , febt tho dubtof tho Water Lily. When ivo wore quit.bf.iior 1 looked at Violet, arid Violet looked rit trie. I laughed. I will not go so far as to say that I laughed genially ; still, I laughed. "We scorn tb be in for a pleasant river holiday." . , , " Erie, let us get outsido." , . , .. , We wbijt on deck. The sun hria already set. . There was rib riioori, hut there. was a cloudless sky..

Tho Garden of Sloop.'-' . . -Tho other houseboats . were, radiant with. Chincso lanterns., Tho Water Lily alone was,. still in shadow. We drew bur deck chairs elbso together. ..Violet's hand stole into minb; ' " Eric, do you know that last night I, too, heard voices? " " You ! " I lririghed rigriin. » Violet ! " "I couldn't make it but at all. I was just going to wako you when they were still." "You were dreaming, child. Inglis's story— -confound him arid his story! — has re called your dream to mind. I hope you don't wish to follow Mason's example, and make a bolt of it. I have paid pretty stiffly for thb honour of , being tho Water Lily's tenarit for a month, not to mention tho fact of dis arranging rill our plans.!'. Violet paused before sho answered. . ."No ; I don't think I want, as you say, tb makb ri bolt of it. Indeed," sho nestled closer to iriy side, '' it is rather the other way. I should like to see it through. I have some times thought thrit I should liko to bo with' someone I can trust hi a situation such as this. Pefhaps wo may ho able to rinfathbm tho mystery— who knows ?" ' This tickled me. " I' thought you had donb with romance." " With one sort of roiriarice I hopo I shall never have , done." Sho pressed my hand. She looked up archly into my face. I knew it although' wo were in shadow. " Wi<h another. sort of rbmaitce I may bo only just beginning. I havo novcr yot had dealings with ri ghost." ., . . . CHAPTER II. , At first I could riot make out what it was that had roused me. Then I felt Violet's hand steal into mine. Her voice whispered in my ear, "Erie !" I turned over towards her on 'tlio pillow.. "Bo still. Thoy 're here." I did us she bride tub. I was still. I heard no sound but thb luzy rippling of tho river. . . - "Who's hero?" I asked, whon; as I deemed, I had been silent long enough. "S-sh !" I felt her finger pressed aguinse my lips. I was. still again. The silence was broken in rather a peculiar manner — " I don't think you quite understand mo." Thb -ivords wefe spoken in a man's voice, as it seemed to mo, closo behind my back. . I was so Btnrticd bv the unexpected presence of a third poraou, that I mado us if to spring up in bed. My. wife caught mo by thb arm. Before I could remonstrato or shako off her" grasp a woman's laughter rang through tho little cabin. It was too metallic to bb agree able. And a woman's voice replied : . "I understand you woll euough; don't you make any error !" . . There was n momentary pause. - " You don't understand me, fool !" . . Tho first four words wore spoken with a deliberation whioli iricimt volumes ; while the filial epithet carite with ii suddon miflignant ferooity which took mo aback. Tho speaker, whoever ho might bo, iricrint mischief. - 1 sprang up arid out of bed. . " Wliat riro you doing hero?" I cried. . , I addressed the inquiry, apparently., to th'o ,v iicrint air'. . The moonlight flooded. . tho. little ciibiii; It sho wed blbirly enough tliat it was empty. My wife sa'_uP W bbd. . t'Now," she bhsbryed, ."you've done it," "Do'nowhut? Who was that speaking?"
