A POSTAL PEST. Nobody who, in tho habit of reading the questions on postal matters put by Mr, Henniker Hcaton in the House of Commons, could be in the least surprised when Postmaster-General Raike3 "sat upon " the honorable gentleman who represents Canterbury by the aid of a ghost. Here is a specimen questio and answer : â€” Mr. Henniker Heaton asked the Post- master-General whether he was aware that a letter posted in France for New Caledonia was only charged 25c, or 2 jd, and from England to New Caledonia the charge was 4d per letter, whereas a letter to Australia by the same route, 1000 miles nearer England, was charged Gd. Mr. Raikes : The hon member sesms to have forgotten that i answered in the- affirmative an identioal question raised by him in March, 1887. But I may qualify my previous answer by stating what the hon member probably knows, that a letter may now be Eent to Australia by the long sea route for a postage of 4d.
