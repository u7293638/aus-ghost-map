ROSE, SHAMROCK, THISTLE, AND LEEK. The Rose. — The intestine wars which so long devastated England were carried on under the symbols offche-Red and White Rose. The adherents of the House of Lancaster chose the red rose as their mark of distinction, whilst cnose or xorK chose the white. This fratricidal war continued until the union of the roses by the marriage of Henry VII. with Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV., in I486, since which time the rosejhas continued to be the emblem of England. The Shamrock, — When St. Patrick landed in Ireland to convert the Irish, in 432, the pagan inhabitants were ready to stone him. He requested to be heard, and endeavoured to ex plain God to them as the Trinity in Unity ; but they did not understand him until he plucked a trefoil, or shamrock, from the ground, and said, " Is it not as possible for the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be one as for these three leaves to grow upon a single stalk ?" " Then," says Brand, " the Irish were convinced, and became converts to Christianity ; and in memory of that event they have ever since worn the shamrock as a badge of hononr. The Thistle.— When the Danes invaded Scotland, on one occasion, they resolved to adopt a stratagem, and in order to prevent the Scots from detecting them they marched bare foot. The Danes thought they should reach the camp in a few minutes, when, on a sudden, a man who went forward was wounded by a stout Scotch thistle, so that he could not help crying out loudly with pain. This nGise ronsed the camp ; the Scots flew to arms, and the Danes were vanquished. The thistle was after wards adopted as the insignia of Scotland. The Leek. — On a certain occasion Xing Cad- wallader met a Saxon army. In order to dis tinguish his men he placed a leek in each of their hats ; and having gained a decisive victory over their enemies, the leek became ever after the badge of the Welsh.
