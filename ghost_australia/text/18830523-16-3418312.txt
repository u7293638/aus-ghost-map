THE LATE MR. DAVENPORT, OF HEADINGTON HILL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. SIR,-It is gratifying to some of us old sheep men to hear of the Hon. Mr. Perkins's just and graceful tribute of praise paid to the memory of the late Mr. Davenport. Heading a few weeks ago your description of the Headington Hill flocks, without mention being made of the head manager who selected the country and planned the improvements that have so greatly contributed to bring the "Fisher flocks" to the perfection they have attained in Queensland, was like rending of Laban's flocks with Jacob left out, or of the battle of Waterloo without the Duke of Wel- lington and Napoleon. The late Mr. George Davenport and his successful land-selecting forms a portion of Queensland history ; his extensive farming operations and artificial feed- ing of stock have long since been described. If Mr. Davenport lived now, probably he would be one of the first extensive stockowners to prove the value of the silo system in preserving fodder, because he was always ready to adopt and to explain the best means of improvement adapted to the land and the climate, and to the animals depending upon his active manage- ment. Mr. Davenport's system of extensive farming and production of artificial food for stock can and will be carried out to an immense extent in time to come, upon the large expanses of the Darling Downs. I once sold a flock of wethers to Mr. Daven- port, and meeting him some considerable time after the sale I inquired how they had turned out. The reply was, " Very well, but I think some of their ghosts are haunting my paddocks still." The fact was a few of the sheep being aged did not fatten readily, and this was his cheery way of expressing himself. The pastoral and agricultural community of Australia sustained a serious loss when Mr. Davenport was taken from their midst. â€” I am, sir, &c.;, C.A.F.
