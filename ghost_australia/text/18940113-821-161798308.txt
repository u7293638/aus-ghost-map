ENTERTAINMENTS. MUSICAL AND DRAMATIC. With the advent of a new week the Irish Comedy Company placed a fresh play on the boards at the Bijou. "Snared'' is a drama in four acts, which, as they pass, disclose how readily that stage villain of good presence and fashionable dress may ingratiate himself amongst people with whom he mixes and gain his bass ends, and how he is followed up by Nemesis. As "Spipkins" says, " there is sure to be a petticoat in it," and in this drama there are twoâ€”the one who is wronged but finally avenged, and the other who by her eccentricities but withal good nature sees the end of the villain and glories in it. Another of the delightful Continents entertainments took place at the Exhibition Grounds on Saturday evening, and Mr. F. Based is to be congratulated not only on the capital attendance of the public, but also on the evident appreciation of the Musical bill of fare submitted. The singing of Miss Ida Osborne was again the feature of the evening, and this was supplemented by the reappear- ance of Mr, Fred Smith, of Melbourne, and the finished playing of the Militia Band. Weather conditions could hardly have been better than they were for Wednesday even- ing's "Continental," with the result that one of the largest attendances of the season was re- corded. The charming grounds at the Exhi- bition were appreciated by the people, who also apparently enjoyed to the utmost the capital entertainment provided. Napoleon's ghost at the Cyolorama seems to have the same amount of fascination for the public as the ghost of Hamlet had for the young Dane. The illusion proved a complete success. Not only is the likeness to the original a perfect one, but the details in dress, even to the colours, are faithfully shown.
