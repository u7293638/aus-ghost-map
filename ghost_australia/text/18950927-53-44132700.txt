Victoria. MELBOURNE, Friday. In the Ballarat County Court yes- terday, during the hearing of a case Judge Gaunt said that in the course of 20 years' experience in Ballarat as a barrister, he had heard only the best of characters of sharebrokers. Legitimate brokers were strictly honorable men, and the whole of their transactions were carried out on their word of honor.
