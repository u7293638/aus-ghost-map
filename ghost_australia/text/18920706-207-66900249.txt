MARY'S GHOST. A Pathetic Ballad. 'Twas in the middle of the night, :o sleep young William tried; When Mlary's ghost came stealing in, And stood at his bedside. 0 William dear ! O William dear 1 My rest eternal ceases; Alas ! my everlasting peace Is broken into pieces. I thought the last of all my cares Would end with my last minute; But though I went to my lung home, I didn't stay long in it. The bodyu-snatcliers they have come And made a snatch at mei; It's very hard them kind of men Won't let a body be! You thought that I was buried deep, Quite decent like and chary, But from her grave in Mary-bone. They've come and boned your lMary. The arm that used to take your arm Is took to Dr. Vyse; And both my legs are gone to walk The hospital at Guy's. I vowed that you shouhl have my hand, But fate gives us denial; You'll hind it there, at 1)r. Bell's, In spirits and a phial. As for my feet, the little feet You used to call so pretty, There's one I know, in Jledford flow, The t'other's in the City. I can't tell where Imy head has gone, But Doctor Carpue can ; As for my trunk, it's all packed up To go by Pickford's van. I wish you'd go to Mr. P. And save lme such a ride; I don t halt like the outside place They've took for my inside. The cock it crows-I must be gone I My William, we must part ! But I'll he yours in death, altho' Sir Astley has my heart. Don't go to weep upon my grave, And think that there I be: They haven't left an atom there Of my anatomie. -Tuosas Hoo
