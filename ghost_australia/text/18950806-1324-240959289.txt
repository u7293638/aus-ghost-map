They knew 'the hospital committee had no power toeue outside bodies for funds, and the council should do whst it could to assist them according to' the;terma of the agreement, but it would be far hetter for the committee toapply toParliament and to tbs Health Statutes, giving tbem power •oeoniaifcof AeconnaL Until that was done they should, in tbe interests of iiw people they representedjdot^beatthi^coaldfix them independent of the&aspitator; SDjotlttr committro.
