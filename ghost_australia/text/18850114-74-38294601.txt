THE 1'OOK. (FROa OU OWN CORRESPON.fENeT.) Yesterday afternoon e had a nrvein our chapel conducted bye Air. Moore, an evangelist, or as thoycall themselves "a Disciple of Christ." He, however, preached a very appropriate sermon from Romans i, 16, to good congrega. tion. In the evening the Rev. R. W. Thomson preached to a fair audience. Our cricket club, or rather some of them, met for practice on Saturday last, rather late In the season, but we hope to play a couple of matches soon. The weather seems unsettled still, and the roads are quite muddy in some places. There is a story going about that a ghost has been seen on the Don Hill, or at the camp, where Torner's men are road-making. Some of them declare it is to be seen every night, as. suming different shapes. They say, also, that the object advances towards them when they go out, and that some of them have shot at it, and it is still to be seen. This is rather strange, butI am no believer in ghosts, and think I will see what tihe object is like before long. There are great improvements going on in scrubbing, and we may soon expect bash fires to Jan 12.
