PART II. MELBOURNE. CHAPTER XIX. — Continued. "KATE !'' said Walter, at last, as the shrubbery bard ceased playing, and that in the ballroom started the Caledonians : "Yes, Walter," replied Kate, with a start. "I suppose you know Victor is to be married." He felt her tremble like a leaf." "No," she answered, in a choked voice. "I am surprised," said Walter. "He asked Warana to-day, and she accepted. Heavens ! what is the matter, Kate ?" "Nothing," she gasped, and then, as if to prove it, she burst into tears. "There is something the matter," said Walter. "Poor Kate, what is it ; tell me." She only looked up, with a tear-stained, woebegone face, upon which the faint light of a lamp fell ! Walter could not help it ; he involuntarily kissed the sweet little face, whereupon she hid it with her hands. "Oh, Kate," said Walter, bending down and putting his hand round her waist, "dear Kate, I knew you were fond of Victor, but it was vain. He never loved you ; he never loved anyone except Warana, since he met her in Melbourne. I have known his heart for years, and knew this. But Kate, if he does not love you, I do. I have long loved you, Kate, but I never dared to think of speaking to you until Victor had taken this step. Try and love me, Kate ; I will be a kind and good husband ; I will fight the world for you ; I will rise to high position ; hand in hand we will rise together. Kate, Kate, give me some hope— if ever so little." She only sobbed all the more, and yet she did not feel so unhappy ; a new light appeared to dawn upon her visions. "Give me a little hope, Kate," pleaded Walter. "You are the only friend I have, except poor, dear aunt," said Kate. "You will forget this love in time," said Walter ; you will find refuge in my poor and strong affection. Victor is not of us, Kate ; he belongs to the proud, and beautiful and great, of the earth. He is already of the heights, we are but wearily toiling up the slope. I will do all I can to gain your love." "Oh, Walter," said Kate, "I wish I could love you after a while I may try, but now do not distress me." "My darling, no," said Walter ; "I will give you the devotion of a life, in the hope it may overcome all obstacles at last." At this moment steps were heard approaching, and Walter took Kate's arm, and they resumed their walk, making for the ballroom. The steps proved to be those of Victor and Warana, and they passed by on the next walk. Walter noticed that they seemed quite hurried and excited, and they were talking rapidly. Victor and Warana had extended their walk to the very limit of the grounds, and sat down close to the iron fence that hedged in Warana House. Here they occupied themselves as lovers usually will, especi-. ally lovers so ardent as they. The moments slipped by without notice until the moon rose, when both considered that the absence of the host could be noticed, and they decided to return. As they sauntered along a walk, which ran close to the fence. Warana thought she heard steps outside. "There is someone walking out there, she said, peering into the half-illumined space. Someone come to hear the music," said Victor. At that moment both stood stock still, startled. "Victor !" came from over the fence in a weak, broken voice. Warana felt her lover tremble violently. No aspen ever quivered as did he. "Victor !" again in a lower, more tremu- lous tone, undoubtedly a woman's voice. "What is it ?" asked Warana. "There is something strange here." "Nothing at all, Warana," he replied, hastily, grasping her arm tightly. "Some of the fellows are playing a joke, that's all. Let us get back as soon as we can. A pretty joke— ha, ha !" His laugh was so hollow and unreal that Warana shuddered as he dragged her along "Victor !" came upon their ears again, like the wail of the pines on the night wind —pleading, desponding, broken-hearted. It was a relief when they came to the lights. Warana looked at her companion, and saw that his face was as pale as death. A woman of strong passions, jealous thoughts at once entered into her mind. The very idea that this might be a woman who had any claims on Victor maddened her. "Victor," she said, determinedly, "there is something wrong. I demand some ex- planation." "My darling," said he, bending over her lovingly, "how can I explain ? It must be some stupid joke." "What makes you so pale ?" she asked, doubtingly. "Am I pale ?" he replied. It must be the lights— you look pale, also. There, Warana dear, don't be so agitated over such a thing, or the jokers will have the laugh they plotted for." Warana was not satisfied. She folt that there was more in tho occurrence than she could comprehend, and her mind was torn with doubts and suspicions. Yet what good would it do to pursue the matter further ? It was the first cloud that had come over her happy life that day. "I will not go into the ballroom just now," said Warana, "I feel so agitated. I would like to go to your mother's room for a while, just to rest." "Very well, dear," said Victor. "You will soon recover yourself, but don't let anyone know of the occurrence or the un- mannerly jokers will be gratified. I must go to the ballroom and see how they are going on." Leaving Warana with Mrs. Graham, who was the centre of a happy circle of ladies in one of the pleasant rooms in which Aspland abounded. Victor hastened back to the ball- room. Had Warana seen his dark face and set mouth after he had passed the door she would have had good reason to think all was not well. CHAPTER XX. HUSBAND AND WIFE. He merely spoke ..................... escaped unnoticed by a side door, and took a dark path through the grounds. This led to a small wicket gate, and here the moon shone full upon his face. If the gay crowd in the ballroom had seen him then they would hardly have recognised his features. His brow was contracted, his lips shut, and an expression of agony was upon his face. To look at it, one would think that all the demons of hell were working in his heart. His breath came short, and he gasped in the excess of his passion, while his hands were clenched. When he came to the wicket he stopped, and a fearful look came into his face. "Every evil deed, every foolish act," said he, that I committed in my youth comes back to me like so many inappeasable creditors. Something told me when I gave this, accursed woman the money, and sent her to America, that she would return— they ever do. What can I do ? what can be done ? It was her voice, I am certain, and the pawning of the Golden Serpent— curses upon that thing— proves it beyond doubt. Shall I— no, no, no— not that ! Yet, what will be the result ? She will claim her rights as my wife. I cannot get a divorce without notoriety, and the slightest breath of slander would destroy all my hopes of possessing Warana— Warana, for whom I would give my life, more than my life. If there is a God, surely He is against me ; surely He has placed a Nemesis on my track. What, too, if Dan Regan is in Melbourne ? Could it be possible ? This is Monday ; the outrage occurred on Friday ; he would have had plenty of time, and he has enough daring. Detective Longsight thought he was in the city, but that must have been mere speculation. I thought, too, I saw him in the crowd at the Flower Show, but, whoever it was, he vanished in a second. I feel like a rebel at bay ; all the forces of the enemy are closing round me. How can I escape ? Perhaps Dan is out there with her, and will shoot me down at once if I do not obey him. There is no end to his daring and cunning, and he has a long score to settle with me. For once I fail to see the light ; my steps are in thick darkness. One false move and the mask is torn off, and I am revealed, and become the execration of the world—never more to raise my head, except—" Striking his hand on his breast, he strode backwards and forwards in front of the wicket, breathing in that hard manner, that characterises the tortured mind. He was, indeed, an animal at bay, looking for a weak point in his adversary's ranks, and failing to find one. "I cannot lose her," he said at last. "Where is my courage ? where is the courage that sustained me when I was five years younger ? Has this maddening love un- manned me ? I am, indeed, in the folds of many and deadly serpents." Again he resumed his rapid walk, as he did so muttering occasionally. How deep the woe of parting. * * * * * Ever more. A joyous burst of music came from the band in the shrubbery, Libiamo, Libiano, ne liete calici, from "Traviata," followed by the beautiful waltz air, Parigi o cara, Victor stood still and listened, and as he did, his face relaxed and resumed its usual aspect, except that it was dark and determined, and he murmured to himself : A light is on the mountains. * * * * * See, the dawn is breaking. * * * * * Other loves are waking. "It must be done," said Victor, after a pause ; there is no other way. I will sur- mount these difficulties yet. I will obtain all I have played for, all I have worked for. They shall not triumph over me. Yes—I will conquer. I must see this wretched woman, and at once, or it will be too late. The web is being woven around me, and I must break its meshes." He opened the gate, and strode off into the by- street at the back of Aspland Place. Looking np and down, he failed to see any person. It was bright moonlight, and he could see on all sides. He walked rapidly down the street, and turned the corner of the fence. He had hardly done so when he almost stopped on a ragged woman who was on her knees praying. He started back, and she turned, her face towards him. "Victor, Victor !" cried Rose, for it was she, with a hysterical scream. "Hush !" said Victor. "Hush !" the grounds are full of people." She rose totteringly and stood humbly before him, her face having an expression of mixed terror and yearning love. "Oh ! Victor, forgive me," she said, plead- ingly, humbly as a dog would do if it could speak. "Forgive me, Victor ; I could not stop away—I wanted to see you before I died. All the money went, and I hungered and thirsted for you— I did— I did." "Cursed creature," cried Victor, his face ablaze with passion, "why do you rise up again to blight my life, to destroy me. You said you would do anything for love of me, save me from a wretched life, and now here you come like a Spectre— a Ghoul." "I could not help it," she moaned. "Kill me if you like, Victor ; death would be sweet at your hands." He set his teeth hard, and clenched his hands, glaring on the woman like a beautiful fiend. "Why did you call me when you saw I was with someone else ?" Poor Rose shivered. She knew who that someone else was, and the arrow went deep into her heart. "Because, I must see you,' she replied. "I came here to-night to save you. I tried all I could to see you, but I could not mus- ter courage to speak to the servants." "You did not speak to anyone in the house ?" he queried. "No," she replied. "I wandered round the place in hope of sending a message to you, and at last I saw you. I wanted to save you. Victor, Dan is about this place, and I fear he intends to kill you." "Dan is here !" said Victor. "Well, if he is, he will never leave, for there are two detectives at the ball waiting for him. You know what he has done." "I do, I do !" she murmured. "Then you should be troubled for him— not me," said Victor. "He cannot escape, and he will die an ignominious death." "He will never be hanged," she replied "he will be shot dead before he is taken." "Why," said Victor, "the man is as mad as a run down dingo, and worse. He has put his neck into the noose." "You know how determined he is," exclaimed Rose. He has all his plans prepared, and they rarely miscarry." "And what do you intend doing ?" asked Victor. "Nothing," she said. "I have seen you, that is enough. I will not trouble you again." An evil smile came over Victor's face. "You look poor enough," he remarked, cold-bloodedly. "I suppose money is wanted." "A little, Victor," she replied, "to get me that which brought me so low ; that which is killing me. Oh, Victor, I can be nothing to you now. I look old, I have grown ugly. I am thin, and poor, but, Victor—I ....." And she sunk on her ....... "I do," said he, in a quiet tone, which contrasted with his previous mood. "This is not the time, however, to speak of the past, to tell me what you have done. Your appearance has disarranged all my plans ; still, all is not lost. I think I can yet set things right. Now, Rose, it will not do for you to be left out here to meet your brother, who, out of revenge, will proceed even to death. There is a small room off the house never occupied, and I can convey you there and make you comfortable for the night. In the morning I will think over matters, and see what can be done. There is no time to lose ; they will miss me, and all may be lost. Will you come ?" "Will I come ?" the wretched woman said, looking fondly up to the magnificent form she loved so dearly. "Yes, I will go with you anywhere, even to death." A sallow hue overspread Victor's face as she said this. "Well, then," said he, "let us go. Lean on my arm." "Lean on your arm !" exclaimed Rose. "Oh ! you make me too happy. The old times have come back ; I am too happy." And, after walking along the fence, the two disappeared through the wicket gate. CHAPTER XXI. THE GOLDEN SERPENT. THE ball was at its height at ten o'clock. By that time everyone felt at ease, and the stiffness incidental to such assemblages at the beginning had entirely worn off. Mrs. Graham and her circle of elderly ladies, who amused themselves by gossip and in other ways, were cosy and happy, giving an occa- sional look into the ballroom to see their charges were all right, while Mr. Mackenzie was in high glee in the card-room, for his partner and himself had vanquished two sets of opponents. If there was any anxiety in his mind it was about the supper, which was to be a great affair, and, as he was a gourmand, it could not be supposed that he would forget that most important feature in the entertainment. Victor looked into the card-room as the old gentleman had de- molished his opponents again. "Whenever you're playing, lead in that way," said Mr. Mackenzie ; "it's bound to come right nine times in ten. Why, he continued, as he quitted the trick, and looked up at Victor, "you've been dancing too much or something. You look very pale." "Oh, I feel a little fatigued," said Vic- tor, turning away. "I must go and see where Miss Mackenzie is." "That's right, my boy," said Mr. Mac- kenzie, as he quitted the next trick, with a chuckle. "Where's Miss Mackenzie, mother ?" asked Victor, as he entered the ladies' room. "You'll find her in the blue parlour," replied Mrs. Graham, beaming kindly on her son. "She complained of a headache, and said she would rest in quiet for a little while." Victor was soon in the blue room, and there he found Warana reclining on a lounge, her eyes shaded with her hands. When she heard his step she withdrew her heads, and it was easy enough for him to see— by the love-light in her eye, and the sweet smile that overspread her face— that she hed forgotten the little episode in the garden. "Victor," said Warana, rising, "I was a little cross in the garden, but I've got over it all now. I ought not to take so much notice of what, I suppose, was a stupid joke." Victor replied with a close embrace and a passionate kiss. "Oh ! Warana," said he, gazing into her eyes with a delirious look of love, "I missed you even for the short time you were away. What would it be if we were to part for ever— if I lost your love ?" "Surely that could never occur," she said. "We will never part in this world." "I hope not," he said. "You would hold fast to me, Warana, whatever happened ; you would never forsake me, even if the world turned against me ?" (To be continued.) A LASTING MEMORY. THE night of my return I went to the Haymarket Theatre. After my long wander- ings my arrival had disappointed me. It was a dull November Saturday, London was not full, and I found scarcely any of the greetings I had longed for and expected. My few relatives were absent ; in the Clubs I belonged to I only found strangers. Time hung heavy on my hands after the strange scenes of the past five-years. So I went to the Haymarket. The little theatre had always been my fancy. I remembered it from very early youth— Farren, Webster, Buckstone, Howe, Holl, Mrs. Nisbit, Mrs. Glover, Julia Bennet, and Miss P. Horton. I have never been a great theatre goer or devotee of the drama, and my knowledge of the trical history, is pretty well confined to the Hay- market. CHAPTER I. Thebe was rather a long entr' acte, and my mind, by lnstinot, but mistily went - over difforent occasions of play-going.

Indeed I; never entered into his establishment above j two or three times— onoe with my oonsin,; who, having scoared me the. entree, allowed; me alone to improve the 'ooaasion. It was on my third and last appearanoe that I made the aoqaaihtanoe of Jook Oampbell. i After dining alone with the oonveyanoer,: I loft bim to do his work, went to the; theatro, and satin: tho stalls next.
