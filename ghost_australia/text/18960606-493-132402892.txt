SOUTH AUSTRALIA., Saturday was a record day on the Adelaide share market, 82,000 shares changing hands. It is understood that street betting in Adelaide has become so objectionable that the Commissioner of Police intends to have the offenders arrested instead of summoned. Tbe trial of the prisoners eharged with burning tlie Ayrshire Downs woolahed was commenced in the District Court at Rockhamplon on Tuesday morning, before Judge Miller. Mr. King, Crown Prosecutor, and Mr. Feez appeared for the Crown ; Mr. Fitzgerald, a barrister of Longreach, defended the prisoners. The court was densely crowded all day. The trustees of the South Australian State Bank, who recently invited tenders for mortgage bonds to the extent of £20,000, have opened the applica tions, and found that the amount was more than doubly subscribed. The total that the public are willing to take up at 3J per cent, is £45,300. In dividual tenders ranged from £100 to £8000, and they were offered to be taken up at from par to £5 2s 6d premium. At the Aael&iae; I-Oiiee uourr, a man nameu Rudd was charged with unlawfully disguising himself with a piece of white cloth, and was therefore deemed to be idle and disorderly. On the night of May C Thomas Meddal was on his way home, when he noticed a figure in white emerging from the Wesleyan Cemetery. As it approached him he heard it say, 'Thomas Meddal, I claim you.' He answered, ' Take me tben,' and struck it with a stick which he carried. The ghost ' closed' with him, and in the scuffle the sheet was disarranged, and Meddal identified Rudd. The defendant waa fined 10s and costs — £4 6b iu all.
