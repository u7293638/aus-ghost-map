PORTFOLIO. We all believe in another world beside this. We all acknowledge that there are things which we cannot see and hear and feel, and yet which are quite as real as what we do see andhear and feel. We all believe in God, who made all things, and who rules all things by His power and wisdom, and il Jesuns Christ, the ever-blessed Lord of God, and in the Holy Ghost, and in heaven and hell, and in angels and .pirits. We know too, that man is not simply what he outwardly seems to be -a mere perishing creature, passing a few short years upon this earth, and tlhen ceasing to be; for we believe that "ach separate person is an everlasting tpiritual being, having a soul as well as a body. So that, just as there are two great worlds,-the eternal world which is unseen, and the temporal world which is seen,-so there are too great parts in man,-the eternal invisible Fart, which we commonly call the soul, and the temporal and visible part, or the body. It is plain that to speak of the two great worlds, is to speak of the very root and foundation of all religion. For if there were no other world beyond this which we can see, then there could be no such thing as religion. Before a man can take any other step at all in religion, he must see, and feel the reality of the unseen world and of spiritual things. This is the very first act of faith-to realise (that is to make real to our own souls) the things unseen. Faith is called the eye of the soul, be cause, just as the eye of the body looks upon the things of this temporal world, so faith,-the eye of the soul-looks upon the things of the eternal world. And this first great work of faith is most clearly described to us in the words which say, "While we look not at the things which are seen, bat at the things which are not seen." It is only faith- the eye of the soul,-which can do this.-Bishop Wlalshan llow."
