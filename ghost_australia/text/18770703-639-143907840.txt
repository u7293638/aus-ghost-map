I ; , DR, SCHOMBURGK ON . GRASSES. . I oajtnot close the chapter on grasses : with out calling to. the minds of our sqtmtters and farmers the fact that , there' are few circum stances to which they have been so inatten tive as to the nature, arid produce' 'of their pasture' larids; viz. 'the' , grasses' arid fodder plants. // ;.-j . . It is also true that the cultivation of arti ficial grass and fodder plants can never be so general here as at home, on account of the large extent of pasture land in possession of the squatter, and on account of the insuper able difficulty arising from climate- and the droughts to which some parts of the colony are often subjected ; and there are not many European and foreign grasses which would live throughout the year and renew them selves annually. Many species of our native grasses, I am sorry to say, have already died from cultivation and depasturing since possession has been / taken by Europeans. Every one, especially the squatter, is aware *of the failure of the native grasses, and ' also that the feeding properties of native pasture have seriously declined of late years. Many close, observers will have already missed several/kinds of herbage, especially annual or summer grasses, in our neighbourhood; and the representatives of other kirids are b'ecoriiing less every year. But this is not prily the case with the annual but also with .the perennial herbage. I will only mentioh the kangaroo grass (Anthistiria ciliata), which in the early days , of the colony we found, everywhere, and , which formed a. great {iart of the pasture grass. ' It ' has now dis appeared even'from ibcalities wMch it for merly almost monopolized. It has been so much relished by the stock that it has been fairly eatem out of ; the ground, ' and I fear will' soon disappear entirely, and a good many grasses will, follow. It will be asked —'What is the cause of this ?' Nothing is more easily answered. By the practice of grazing the same larid throughout the year, and overstocking, the grasses and other herbs are prevented from ensuring their reproduc tion from seed.; and as the sheep crop' very closely the plants soon succumb. From the fact also that the sheep naturally devote their attention to the kinds of . grasses they most liike, they leave the inferior one untouched. Most of our bitter kinds of native grasses have no tendency/ to form a close turf ; and, growing usually in tussocks, are iriore easily eaten out of the ground and destroyed. The perennial grasses suffer also from constant travelling of stock. As I have mentioned before, I fear very few foreign grasses can be grown with profit and advantage on runs, and. so the squatter must depend upon the native grasses. The only resource, will be to encourage these. No doubt, . if properly cultivated, native grasses would be the most suitable for pasturage on runs. ? ; The runs should be divided into paddocks. Anriually one of these divisioris should |not be grazed, to allow of replacing the' pastur age. The grass should grow unmolested—; flower, ripen, and scatter their seed, so as to ensure their reproduction/ ' . Undoubtedly' such a system of / rotation' would : be' very beneficial, and would materially improve /the growth of pasture. / 1 ' / j ; The seeds of, grasses,, /should be collected, and care , should be taken to, ; procure those sorts, of which cattle /and/ sheep are fondest, ; and/ on,, which . they (. thrive; best. ; Of such; grasses several sacres should; be grown/; iiear, ' ,th(9; .lioiriestea4, Jin -:'well ,-prep^d soil,/ and./ .fenced in, for the sake of, procuring annually .a quantity of seed, which should /be, sown bri: ' such sppts as are deficient of . herbage. Tliese: spots should be plpi^gliei,; eaxi seed. . prb-; perly 'sowed. ;iand . harrowed . in. , , , No Z doubt these seeds,/ sown before the rain set/in, will.; gijow afterwards without any trouble. 'Where t.cHmate and .soil are , favourable to; any/.liind 'of grass, lit ,. .is sui-prising in what avshprt/tiirie; ' plants, frpm /a small /quantity ;of//gopd seed,/ are spread over a large area./ , .,No.t . only inJ .South Australia do we see/the aest^uctiori of' /native herbs by overstocking the . runs, but , also in South Africa the, same process is going ?on through 'the iritrpducition o^ sheep, arid the. /grasses .are fast/disappearing^ ,.- The, ground by the hurried march of/ the sheep! far food- ' amongst a scattered bush/has become beaten-. ; and , hardened ;/ the country is drying ui), and ; beebmng .a semi-desert. -p' ; / The following letter; which I- noticed the : ether day in one of the voluines .of the Farm and'Gmrdfin'i will illustrate, the state in which j ./the native- grasses ; were! ,;found ' here in the1 first days of. the colony., I The» writer !says-:f— The first, suryeyprs coming, down to Yanka lilla pitched ;their tents in; a. fine topen/' valley or plain, where - they . found; ;ther jgrass ?' so luxuriant and tall;that it could . be : tied ,,over: a horse's back ; this they/ mowed ;, arid- made ?; into hay, and . from that, circumstance they called the place ' Hay Flat.' This nairie it has.contiriued ^6-bear,' undeservedly, up; to the present tiine ; although I think it high time for. it; to. be altered; to a less pretending one, for its .present .aspect reminds one .no . more of the above narrative than does- a fairy, tale,, or ghost story, of -real -life ; indeed a . modern ; explorer, \/, visiting the spot now, , would, call, it 'rush' or stonj^' valley. Such .impoverished grazing tracts are appa-/ . rent every where, and increase in extent from' year^to year/'/' The squatter will, , perhaps, z shake his head and iaugh, at myr ^arnings-; but 'I, can assure him if the present system' 5 is carried on, ' viz. , grazing the runs through- : out the year, and so repressing and injuring the native herbage, whilst every encourage- ^ ment is given to the growth of bitter and ' noxious herbs, which the sheep will not touch, except when pressed by great hunger, * the obnoxious herbs will gradually increase, ; and the better verdure must give way every . year, the grasses dying out one after an- ' other; arid this period will -be hastened should we have the misfortune to 'cbntend with succeeding dry seasons. ? ' ; ' : ' : The collection of grasses, which haye been cultivated for the last ten years1 - iri the Garden have stood the lasts trying season very well. . It is my intention this year to experiment ori a large scale with' the artifi- , cial griissesi' Through want of room I have only had six' or eight plants of each kind; in future, I will devote pne or /two acres of \ land in the park for the purpose of growing these grasses on a larger scale and, when r plarited or sown I will leayo . them entirely to the raercy of Nature, arid it will then soon . become apparent which kirids suit our climate best, and can be grown with least trouble. While'.I have had very few applications for grass seed iri our own; colony, the contrary has been the case from1 the neighbouring \ colonies. Hundxedsjof packets of grass seed ! have been sent and I ? was unable to ! supply _ all the j applicants. It /is ? at 'least gratifying thafc^B pther colonies benefit by the introductior^f these grasses. I will ( only mention on^nstance, and quote a letter 3 which lately appeared , in , the Queenslander, / February 10, 1877. //. ''/?' ' - / ??'?' ^ ' To the Editor, &o.;— Sir,— You will re- j/ member that some twelve months or more j' ago you drew attention to the panic grass ? j; (Panicum spectibilb), which Dr. Schom- - $ burgk had acclimatized in-.' Adelaide, and /-..|f said that seeds might be procured from there ^ hy anjf one on, apphcation. I. at once wrote J for some. of the seed, and received a small 1 parcel' through -the post. ; | ' I sowed: this in October last in scrub ;! soil, in a single row, and I think . every seed i must ,have germinated, as it grew so thickly ? and luxuiiaritly which ' it 13 doing, still, al though it has been cut down several times, and the severe drought before Ghristmas did not seem.tb ajSect it in the slightest.
