bert Spencer in his "Principles of Sociology" deduces all that is essential in religion from ghost and ancestor worship, and Mr Allen, thinking that Mi Spencer has not assigned sufficient importance to the part which sacred stones have played in the evolu tion of the higher forms of religious practice, sets himself m this article to fill up the gap The result is an intensely interesting paper packed full of information on the part which the sacred stone has played m the religious history of the race and showing very strikingly tho genuine alikeness of all peoples in this matter Readers of the Hebrew Scriptures know how frequently sacred stones figure in the old Hebrew religion but many of theso will tighten their lips as the) lend the fmal woids of the pnpei " I don't seo, theie foie how wo can oasily avoid the obvious m feience that Jahweh, the God of the Hebrews, tho God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God who later became sublimated and etherialised into the God of

F) appears with a papei on "Tho State and tho bei mon on tho Mount," anda sound, health), and haid hit ting paper it is withal, well calculated to pro duce discomfort many minds of those im prudent critics who have taken the Bishop to task for two assertions of his which were made during a discussion on Christian Socialism at a recent diocesan conference Commenting then on a recent definition of Christian Socialism as an attempt on the part of tho State to compel all men to live according to tho precepts of Christ he insisted-" 1 That it is not possible for the State to carry out in all its relations, literally, all the precepts of Christ, and that a State which attempted this could not exist for a week 2 That if it weie possible to do this tho result would be a perfectly intolerable tyranny " Clearly, vigorously, does the Bishop state his case, and his state ment might be wisely read by local wiseacres who prate Socialism Another Bishop -Crpenter, of Ripon-contn1 iles a short hut

excellent as treating of the position of women in i elation to the life of tho period Both, especially the lastnamed, deprecate the modern tendency towards manhkeness in the pursuits of the modern

A rapid glance is thrown at the work of precursors in this particular line - Plato's " Republic," Christ's "Gospel," Sir Thomas More's "Utopia," Campanella's "Civitas Solis," Harrington's "Oceana," Bacon's "Nova Atlantis," the French "Histoire des Seo rambes," Cabet's " Icaru," and Lytton's "The Coming Race " And then M Laveleye comes to Bellamy, urging, and giving good reasons for it, that his dream "will probably remain always a Utopia, unless man's heart be entirely trans formed " " Profit Sharing" is an examination of one of the latest and peihaps most hopeful of schemes for softening the economic troubles of the day by "making use not only of tho physical strength and the technical skill but also of the moral energy of all tho workers.o and by securiiu to each a return equivalent tf his services.
