THE PORT. OnR of the speakers at the late meeting made tihe absurd recommendation that the station of the steam tug should be at the heads. This equals the economical arrangement by which it was recently proposed that the Tamar should go to the Mersey for its own coals.' It is amusing how confidently the most ridiculous things are uttered, and with what well- satisfied credulity they are received ; it being clear that neither the utterer nor the receiver could have thought about the matter at all. What good could come out of keeping the steamer at the heads? The prevailing wind is up the river, and nine cases out of ten the traders to this port will come as quickly to Launceston withourt steam 'as with steam. Again, if the tug were anchored at the heads, the crew would be " eating the bread of idleness," for there would be nothing for them to do. But when the Tamar is at Launceston the men are either employed on shore or in the harbor master or pilots boats, and by this means the number of hands in the department is kept down, while, the finances. are econornised. Formerly we had a Port Officer at £300 a-year, with boat's crew; i Harbor Master paid by tle fees, which amounted to £1800 per annum : there were also deputies, and clerks, and messengers, and the pilots were more highly remunerated than at present. But now the affairs of the port are better attended to than at any former period : the expense lies been greatly re duced, and brought to nearly a miinilmum. The exertions of a Warden are unremit ting, and he receives a moiety of a clerk's salary. That there are no superfluous hands may be inferred from a recent fact that every pilot and assistant-p ilot, the master of the tug, his mate, and the Harbor Master were all afloat in charge of different vessels, so that if a stranger had arrived there would not have been the ghost of a pilot to meet him. Wise men are reusonable: those who are not should be left to be corrected by their own fully.
