Sho hacl,no, power to think of anything but that ono person. , , They remained in the church for more than1 an hour, and then went back to the quay. It was now seven o'clock, and almost dark, but thero were no tidings of the Marie Antoinette. They waited and waited, listening to tho talk of the seafaring men who still loitered about the landing-stairs. It was not by any means hopeful talk for them to hear. One man, who knew them very well, tried to give them a little hope, but his own ideas about the Marie Antoinette were not sanguine. ( ; The girls lingered until the church-clock struck 'eight, and then Jeanne insisted upon going home. . Marie had been shivering, all the time. It was worse than, useless waiting theTe. She submitted , to, -her sister's' will, too helpless for resistance, and they walked slowly homeward. Half way towards the house Jeanne gave a great Bcream. 'Look, Marie I' she cried hyste rically. 'Thank God, thank God I he js safe !' She pointed to a figure advancing towards them —the stalwart broad-shouldered; figure of the young fisherman. It. was indeed Henri La touche.

' Where is Monsieur de Lutrin ?' Henri Btared at her with a bewildered air, and then turned to Jeanne.' ' Bring her, hpmo,' he said. 'Come, Marie.' ' I will not stir a step. Whore is Mon sieur de Lutrin 1' 'Jeanne, bring her home. There has been an accident— the boat capsized off the peak; the two young ladies are safe. I swam on shore with them — they are at a farm house yonder ; and I walked across the fields hero. My boat is lost. It has been a sad day's work.' . , ff. Where is Monsieur do Lutrin ?'' ' Ho is, drowned,' Marie. I. did my best to saVe him; ' but he could not Bwim ; there were the other two. It was no ubo. I could not savo them all.' Mario gavo a great crv, and fell on the ground at his. feet. He lifted nor up, and carried her in his arms as easily as if Bho had beon a little child. She was quito unconscious, fior head lying on hia shoulder. 'Jeanne,' he said in a husky voice,,' what does this mean ?' 'I don't know. ' ' What was Monsieur do Lutrin to her, that she Bhould take his death like this?' 'Hoj; was nothing :to her. Ho had spoken to her ou'eeior twice, that was all.' . ' : '? ? They learned more a few days lator ; for Marie Holbort's swoon was followed by a brain foyer, in which tho girl raved about her drowned lover.'

You aro right, Honri ; I could never have loved you as you deserved.' \ ' | A few days after this she wont to. the bdnvent and told the nuns that she wanted to join their Bisterhood.
