A letter to tho: Madagas-' car Times, giving an account of a "Tour up \- the East -Coast," casually mentions the detcst- I able tactics of the Jesuits as follows " 1 have not been able to give ycu any news since last March, aB I have been in Tamatave, and the French open or steal people's letters. Once I received two papers two days after the letters had been delivered, and after the Post master told me thero was nothing for me. All my Malagasy Gazettes have been stolen from the packets. About Tamatave there is little to say that is not well known to you nil. The The French are tired of the war, and aro dying with the fever like flies. I never saw a day in Tamatave without two or threo'funerals, soldiers' and inhabitants. About two or three WOUCtn UOLUJl O JL toil J u YVUO 1 L'pui bUU tlltlb Ut French soldiers died at .Vohimar in the spaco of a week with a kind of cholera. A band of 1 disciplihaires' (about 150) were landed at Tamatave, but had to be sent baok to Re union after two or threo weeks' stay. All the, volunteers have finished their time, and not a single one agreed to renew his engagement. This vexed the Admiral, and so lie kept them there against their will. It was reported that a French officer received a ball through the neck at Diego Suarez when tlioy attacked that fort. If any one wishes to starve, let him go to Tamatave. You cannot got a piece of beef except as.a favour, and paying lsl a pound for it, s and three-quarters bone. Eggs ton for, ;a dollar. . In fact, Tamatave is a place where,; no one can stay for several, reasons; ; Manyi foreigners are leaving Tamatave,, and most of: the French (those who signed the petition) are praying God to sec the war over. - They; are all saying, ' Where are the good times we' . naa witn tno novas r -ana, now giaa wo should be if wo wore British subjects.' - Now' it appears they have discovered their mistake and reerret what they have done. T'lie Jesuit' priests have a good time of this1 war; They' are sowing disorder in every family in Tama- ltavo'-by taking their, servant's for catechism, ... and the '.women' also ; but . the ;wotneri go at another 'time of the, day. ;Tvvo priests, Fathers Chevalier arid.Lacombe, came to me about five or six times' to take away the natives in my: oitmlnv Knf.

Thoy have no children; at school, and wish to debauch all people's servants. It appears that they are the prin cipal people desirous of seeing the war over, as they are afraid the Protestant .'missionaries.. . will take away alljthbirrit'fes. : t was always'' surrqurided. by certain people who call them selves British subjects trying to find out, what , was going on, and at last one told .me that . I liad better leave Tamataye as soon as possible. Ihnerely replied, '. All right, let- them -turn -mo out.' , . I next made a' trip to St. Mary's Island, taking a passage on. board theFrench man-of- , war , Roraancho. -It would require a ream of paper to : relate the - disorder existing on board : of her.

After nearly three. months in Tamatave I- paid a two days" visit to Fenoarivo.; From there I went to Manaharana, where 1 was well received by the Governor, ; who gave me! a bul lock; as well as geese, ducks,' fowls, and rice.
