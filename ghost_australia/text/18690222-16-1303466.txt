THF TURKISH BATHS, ALBERT STREET. CojiPAEATlVELY few of our citizens seem to be awaio of the luxuiy now placed within thou leach by the establishment of tho aboye baths Indeed, long as luikish baths havo been known in the old couuliy, thoio sooras to bo a veiy considciablo amount of misappiohcnsion on the patt of the general public as to their value and importance as well as to tho modus operandi and tho effects which aro pioduced Thoie is a vaguo idea among many that tho bather is cither baked or par boiled undoi gteat agony, then put through »orno othor mysterious process equally painful, and at last, when endu lance has reached its utmost limit, ho is j relieved, placed on a sofa m a cool loom, and fancies himself better than beforo ho onteied tho bath In old« to îemovo any false impiessions which may bato been formed on tho subject by poisons who havo not as yet ventured into the bath " to seo what it is like," wo proposo giving a vory plain and oiieumstautial account of tho whole piocess, from first to lost, as it is perfouned at the baths m Albert «ticot In the first place, thon, tho bathci, on entering fiom the stieot, is shown into a largo loora on tho second (loot, mostly occupied by couches, but having at the faitber end a row of small closets The attendant puts into his hand a sheet and a canvas apiou, very much tho size and pattern of thoso worn by Freomasons and Odd follows on gala days and important occa »ions, and shows lum into ono of these cellsi whoro thoro is just room, and hardly, for a modorato sized mau to undioss Hating per- founed this opciation, tied on tho npion, wiapped tho sheet round him aftoi tbo manner that ghosts aro said to de, and put ou a pan of slippers, ho is conducted down stairs into a little dark room that smells wann ind vapory, but not disagiceably so Tho shoot ond slippers aro loft at tho dooi, aud then tho piocoss of bathing commences Trst, tho attendant reaches forth an aj^paiatus liko tho "rose" of au ouormous watouug tin used by gar donors, which 13 connected to tho wall by an mdiauibbei tubo, 11 tap is turned and you aio "waleied ' from head to foot with luke wann watci, which feels veiy nico aud agreo able Aftoi 11 couplo of minutes or so tho attendaut gives you a Turkish towel to cany m youi hand, and a pan of wooden clogs in which you stick yom feet, and ho then leads you into another room, which you at ouco perçoit01s decidedly warmei than tho first one, to say tho least of it Aftei the fust ' snifl," howevci, it is not uncoiufortablo, piovidtng you keep youi fcot safely and lu inly m Iho clogs, put tho towoi undet you when >ou sit down, and tako 01110 that no part of youi boro flesh touches on) thing-if it does you nio aw mo of tho fact m amomont, and fool an almost nrcsistible im pulso to indiilgo 111 strong language A bouch runs lound thieo sides of this room, and on this you toko your seat, and if thnsty at all, 01 porspnation does not commcuco at once, you drink of eold water Bofoio you havo been 111 tho room many minutes, howovei, you aio oer tain to break out into a most piofuso perspuation, aftoi which von fcol so porticnlaily cool and oasy that you are astounded, on look ing at tho thormometei hanging on tho wall, to seo it stand at 130 degree, and make up your mind at onco that it could bo raisod another 50 degtocs or so withou' any inoonvomonco Thero is a wooden loungo somo thing 111 tho shapo of nu enormous lottei " N," with tho feet pulled out very wide, on tho fluo on one side the room Takiugyour towoi and carofully arranging it on this loungo, so as to shiold you from touching tho boro wood 111 any part, you ho down for ton minutes 01 a quartet of on hour 111 tbo most blissful stoto of com posure, tlunkiug about uothmg 111 particular, aud contemplating with much complacency tho hugo hoads of poispirattou thot aro bursting out fiom ovcry pore and saturating tho to (roi undor you At lougth tho attendant comos in and takos you book again to tho room you first outored, lays you on a broad bonoh at full stietch and commonces kneading you all ovoi , rubs his kuuoklos down your spino, down your arms, legs, and chost, pulls your joints until they ciack, and, 111 fact, makes vory freo with you altogothot , but having a soft baud and a doft manipulation thoro is nothing about tho process which is in tho slightest dogrco painful Aftor that ho gives you 0 very smart lubbmg all over with the palms of his hands Ihou ho produces n pair of tlosh brushes and soap, and ropeats tho rubbing withincroasod vigoi, until you are ouvolopcd in a thiok wbito lathoi as though you wero ono enormous ohm about to bo oporotod upon by tho barber Thou tho " loso " 13 brought again into play, and tho lathor qmokly disappears in a show01 of warm water Aftor that you got oft tho bench aud stand lu a placo pointed out by tho attendant who turns a handle, and down comes a dolugo of boautifull) cold water, which you onjoy amazmglt for a fow minutes You then stop out, dry yourself with a towoi, rcBitmo your slippers and shoet, walk up stairs and he down on ono of tho condies for half an hour or so, and thou dross, foehng a now man altogether, and couttnood, from tho appoarauoo of youi skm, that you aro eleanor than you over romemboi to hat 0 scon yourself boforo All lassttudo has loft you, tbo " priokly hoot" ovoti, has disappeared undor that rubbing and brushing aud soaping, aud as you walk out into tho opon air tho weather seems to k got decidedly cooler during the hour and a Tir you havo spent in the establishment, \ »I , cold," rheumatics, ov any affections of til kind, must bo very "bad" indeed if tW not driven away at tho first bath, while T most obstinato cannot hold out against ra provided thoy aro takou ínothodfcally and"^ stated intervals. Whether as a medic! i agent, therefore, or morely as a simple, healft ful, and invigorating luxury, the Turkish batt' ¡B admitted on all hands to bo of tho utm f value, and wo trust that Dr. Smith will a\ havo cauBO to repent having introduced it int° Brisbane.
