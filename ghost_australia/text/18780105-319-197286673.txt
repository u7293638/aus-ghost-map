Ho was staring straight boforo him, as if ho had seen a ghost. 'I am a fool, Lotties,' he said, in a tone quite unlike himaolt VTain.a fool to admit tbat boy to tho house.

' I have Boen him,' he wrote.; ' I have seen him, thanks to Mr. Ramsdea's letter. He is grey-haired, but looks Btrong and vigoroua. His manner is very cold, and he saya that there is no ono in the world to be traatod— of course I don't believe that. Ha said, too, that my eyes re* minded him of 'a person' — tbat ia what he said — 'a person.' I acted entirely on Mr* Ham3 den's advice. He ia a stiff old Qa&ker;, but ho read all tho letters, and when he had read them, be said dryly: ' Thy mother ia a woman whom we may pity, friend John. I will think what thoa must dp.' And the next day ho told me what I should do. Mr. romeroy — Iara afraid to pay my father, leBt I should one day blurt it all out by accident— is the clevarest man in all England about agricultural things. The farmers go tohim, and he buys im plements, gives advice, or sells advice, and acts for them. There ia no one, Bays Eli Ramsdon, like him; and, if ha were a different man, ho would make himself better known and acqairo an immense reputation. Bat ho lives locked up and has no friends. No one, said Eli Ramsden, has ever soen him in his private room, whore he lives alone. So I was the first. I wont in quite boldly, as if I expected to be receivod with ppon arms ; and after a bit ho gavo way, fls does not livb alone, because there is a young lady with him, a Miss Lottico Something.

Do not ask mo how or why, becaase I do not know ; but I feel that my father, hard and stern as ho looks, will givo way soonor or later, when ho knows who and what I am, and has learned how jmJoub, bos. pidoos and hasty ho has boen.

These two apprentices oro for ttw momont rcproacnted by young John Pomeroy, thd induslrioa3, and Will Langton, Iho' idlo. Tao former, spending his ovonings in practical, con. versation) learning all that hia tutor could 'teacty always in tho society of the prolty maidon ; th,» ' latter, unlucky Will, idling away-'tho'goldon hours in billiard -rooms and. muaic-halls. And on Sundays, while tho idlo apprentice spends Hio forenoon smoking tobacco, only pulling lnmsett together to visit his sistor in the evening, ths industrious young man might have been soon at tho Dutch Church! in Camel Friars, singing off the samo hymn-book with tho sweetest girl in aH London. How excellent and how manifold art) the rewards held out to those who do thoir duty? To be sure, John understood no word of Dutch, but ho was in a church ; botoro him stood tho prcacaer, doubtless saying words; good to -hoar; around him, within this narrow wainscoted Cold, sat tho honest Hollanders, listening devoalljr; and beside him, her face touched with iho glow of a dim autumnal ray shining through tho windows, was Lattice Langton, It was new aad strange for both of them. John's opportunities for flirting were few in tho , Arcadian moaSowa; Euch maidens as ho met were— well— goDdTatti true girls as any tho sun shines upon ; but not liko Lattice, not so swoet, not so delicatP, cot s», ? dainty, not so altogether desirablo and loyoljr. ; I - fear that, while tho voice_ of the preachar rang among the raf tars, and echoed from, tho walls of the great empty church, that industrious aptien tice, like his predecessor, was thinking moro of tho faco beside him than tho Gospel that was being preached. When church waa over, John walked with Lattice onco or twice up and down tho court, and left her to go home to her early and solitary dinner. . ' ? -.'..??. ? . J Tho evening lessons began. Tho young n»a» took advantage of tho permission to como'as^. friend in its fullest extent. He made as. if fas were an old friend; ho pretended to bo a- con* fidential friend ; ho told Mr. Pomeroy the- whola of his privato affairs— except one thing, *bieh ' entenftu— ho askod his ad vide, as woll oa SDDght for ? information; ? So that, ou tho very -first evening, Mr. Pomeroy found himself ' entrusted with tho management, bo to spoak, of estates belonging to a lady whom he had never heard of; Not only that, but he was managing them for nothing. Most men approached Mr. Pomoroy with that diffidenco which belongs to a reputation for ability, wealth, and eccentricity. The young colonist met him with neither diffidonco nor timidity ; he was, a3 is the custom in that~froo country, ono man with another. Mr. Pomoroy, strange to say, liked it. What ho liked more was the dash and pluck of tho young fellow and hia eminently practical mind, Porhaps what lie likod as woll was the cbango ia Ms habits. Ha was roused out of himself. Ho actually began to ? talk, to Lettico at breakfast and at dinnor. Ho oven seomod to take an interest in what sho did ; asked her, more than once, if sho was not dull; and becamo, in a ward, human, ' Ho ia a practical young follow,' ho said ono morning. ' That is what I liko him for. Nona of your dreamy lot, who go, to bod at night thinking that all the world aro struggling who ? shall be first to help them. No, so; be means to help himself I first— that is his lino. Moantimo ho is young, and of courso believes that peo^to are not all envious of success, and chiefly anxioua to throw stones at men going up the ladder. Gar J waiUUlhoiaaUtt'looldor.' v ?'. '. The prospect of cooing John speedily become as 'groat a misanthrope as himself put Mr. t?om« eroy in good humor. 'I wish ho would come every night,' ho. said. 'Wo aro popr company with each othor, Lettioo. Why don't you talk to mo sometimes?'' 'You do not liko being disturbed.' ' 'Tut— tut. Erory man likos convorfiationi I do not liko prattlo.

' 'Offer to play to him to-night— you ptajr very well.' ' : So that ovcuing— Iho third— Lotties, timidly glancing at hor guardian, aakod John Anbtoa if bo would like her to pluy a little. 'The vory thing I was longing .for,' ho said, springing to hia foot and throwing opon tho piano,' 'Tito very thiug ; but I did not daw aokit.'

It has often occurred ta mo, consider ing the aims bt many young men, that a form of thanksgiving1 mighb bo usefully framed and adopted in all our churches, for the fact that most young men are poor. Heaven help tho .world, if the world continues as it is, should the majority; of young men be born rich, or, which is another tiling, should riches be showered sud denly upon young men as they are. Think of London clerks unexpectedly all together finding themselves each in the possession of alargo income, with /nothing to do. Think what a sweet and lively Paradise they would make of London, with, music-halls in every street, a Gremarne in every garden square, every garden tho homo of burlesque, monster 'comiques' tho leaders of fashion, and the manners o£ Margate fransfdrreS to tho upcongcnidl Btoncs of Bond-street, Ernst Kugel hoped: to arrive at this end, not by inheritance, which was absurd, nor by Btendy industry, which was equally absurd, but by short and easy methods. For one thing, he betted on hdi%e.B. Whenever he had a- pound, to sparej ho backed some animal about whom he had previously /ecayred & tip of the straightest kind; This amusement, while it occasionally gave him a packet full of money, kept him habitually in tho direst depths of povert^Rnji cJ5b{;.= Of conrso he took whatever' oradit kei could- get,, and, of course, he abused that confidence and broke his faith. Ho was, in a word, ouo of the very worst specimens that. London can Bhow of the olerk who ia afc onco cad and -snob, crafty and unscrupulous. Ho drank as much beer,, or anything else, oa to canld lay his hands upon ; he smoked as much' tobacco- as the ' office hours and those spent in sleep wonldpetm% his viows on all subjects were low and earthly^ his opinions on all men wore mesin and base ; he was the vory worst companion that poo* young Langtoa could have. And yet, because Langton was innooent, fond of amusements, and frank, Kugel fixed'upon him far his viotiuij and began to teach Mm all hu know himself. Kugol was handsome, in a way. His German face was o£ a typo common enough, but pleasant; according to the design of Providence. He had long I&ut-brown; hair', and bright hluo eyes ; he was rather' above than below tho middle height ; he wore a moihtache £ut no board or wluskors; his face showed few signs of hia debauched lif^ save for the twitching of the museles j but Bis figurowas atready rather WoWocl, and his u con- ditiou' proinfituroly bad. His ehouldors wore round, and he stooped a little as he walked, Sco him now, stopping out of tho office at half past five with young Langton beside him. Mark the contrast between taoni. It is in the oxprua sion, rather^tban in tUo featurofi thenuejyos, tb«t the elder clerk's' evil Ufo has marked itself. There you mark tho stamp of vicious thoughts and vicious habits. Their seal upon the brow of man iB so common that you hardly notice it as you pass it along tho street, unless yon boo nUbe S?m» JiizOS. fiESfeSJL&aJi; Vj^t of ?vn innoonnrij^ or a man whose thoughts are Bet on higher things: Young Langtoa had known hia friend for a month or so only, and has had; on yt; no time to lbao tho freshness of hi? expressions ?.

Tho fact is, that as Ernst Kugol Bkonld have been born neb, in order to giro tho world an awful examplo of how money should not bo spout, bo Will Langton should havo boon botn riob, so ns to show Aho world what a curse idleness may really bo.

There was . Rood reason; that it Bhould be buttoned tightly, because in the breast pocket ho bad a bagful at notes and gold, which it was his duty to take to theibank j tKw.t.olcrjbly irapprtanj trust being, as everyone knows to be the cualonun our lherttantile Bouses, * confided to the youngest, and therefore, ttie leaat trustworthy clerks^ In bis owndrak was 'a book in which were entered the numbers of tho notes, and the amountin gold. The bank was in Lom bard-street, tho warehonse of .Ferris And Halkett ia one of .tha narrow etiroeta which lie between Choapaide and the new thoroughfare of Queen Victoria-street. There wo3 thusa Bhorfc walk of ten minutes between the office asd the bank. Will Langton did not look happy on this Oc tober afternoon. Liko many an older, and con Bequentlj woko man, he was in debt, and being dunned formdndy which he had not; like many an dlderand more fooTwk tcan, habadbeori living in a fool's paradise* That Caseandra should win the Cambridscshire SSakea ; Cassandra, Kugel's fltraightest and mo3t trustworthy tip ; Ciuwindra, on whom^byKugol's advice, he had laid, when the. odda were twenty to ono, the last sovereign that! was left of Mr. Pomeroy's allowanca and his sister's gifts; CaSsandra, who bad been rising steadily day after day till sho. stood at six to one, and backers were plenty at the price — had boon to Max for the' lost threa weeks a ' moral j1'. nor ? did it coma' homo to him until that , day, the vory day of the raco, that then) was just a chanoa for Cassandra to come in somewhere after tho first. And all day long ho had boon trying to realise hia position, in case of that disaster actually happen ing. , Of course, that disaster was bound to happen. Did anyone over hear of a single case. wWo a bankrupt man rested lib hopes upon a prize in a lottery, tho winning of a horso, the accidental determination of -a chance in his favor, and of that lucky chance turning up? It is certainly open to say that no sane man would bo ground his hopes ; it is also open to say that tha line between sanity and insanity is a good deii con fused, and also, if that goas for anything; that there ia inuoh humanity iu man. Will Langton w»3 that bankrupt and tluHool] Tbo winning of that one harso soenied to him the ono thing which stood between him and a moat almighty sorapo. Let us not bo too hard upon him 1 first, because ho was vory young, only 'aejantggTtjgeawi ot ago ; &n;$ aeooadly; because he ib tneonTytrSSeTDf &ait;!i!& Will had been brooding all day long over the state of things. To a seasoned vessel^ the mere fact of wing more than one can par, of receiving , letters which dun for money and remind of broken promises, of meeting tradesmen who make unpleasant remarks about gentlemen's words of honor, and so forth, have no annoying or worry ing effect at all. Quite tho reverse. If it wero not for tho UUlo excitement caused by their lottors, rencontres, and remarks given them, and the opportunities which they offqr to conver sation, many geutl-micn would bo hipped in their daily lifo, and at a loss for thair daily toil. When you aro young, it is different. To a boy of seven teen, a debt ot livo pounds is a bugbear ; a letter from a disappointed ereditor is huuiijiutiuj?, and a throat .of log*l procaedings maddous : wo get used to such things as wo grow older.
