LETTERS JUDGES' WIVES , RECEIVE. 'It is a great strain on one's sym pathetic nature, being a judge's wife,' said a well-known society ladv the other day. Her husband is a distinguished judge on tho. Crimi nal Bench.

Some of them are quite pitiable in their pathos, 'I remember ono in particular â€” from a mother whose son was be ing tried for murder. Sho wrote, poor thing, in an evident agony of Hufferinp:, pointing out that he was an only son and that he had bewi brought up to follow a godly life ; only, bad companions had got hold of him nnd led him astray. But, for all his wickedness, he was H good son to her still, and if he were taken, thero was nothing but star vation beforo her. She besought me, as I wns a mother, and know a mother's love, to plead with my husband to let him oft1, or, at any rate, to spare his life, \ 'Usually, in faot nearly always, T am bound to decline to even men tion the ease to my husband,, but in this caso I felt forced to speak in the -lad's behalf. I really lie liove, if thero had been a ghost of doubt, the prisoner would have been let off, for my husband was deep) ^ wrought when I told him about the letter. But it was of no use; tho facts were clear. It was a most brutal murder, and the lost penalty had to be enforcoU,'* :'
