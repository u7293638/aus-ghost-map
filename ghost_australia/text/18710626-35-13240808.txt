THE REV. GEORGE F. MACARTHUR ON THE PRELACY OF ST. JAMES. -I TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir In the Rev G I Macarthur's letter, in your issue of to day), occurs a passage which should not, I think, be permitted to pass without comment by some one of the many of your readers to whom it must appear objectionable and unfounded-objectionable, because it introduces, by a side wind, matters of ecclesiastical controversy) into a journal that professes to exclude them and unfounded, except in his own. ipse. dixit The passage to which I refer is this - "W hut a bad heart rending spectacle does the present condition of the Halt Church in England afford, if we contrast her with the Church of Jerusalem in apostolic times, when St James as bishop of that diocese, presided over the whole college of apostles-even St Peter being subordinate to him, and declared the judgment of the Church catholic in these thrilling words, Therefore my sentence is that we trouble not them, which from the Gentiles are turned to God (Acts xx , 11) the bishop and clergy of those days, fee 3 tins assumes diocesan episcopacy) as the government of the dil) Church and bases it on the supposed fact that James was bishop of the diocese of Jeru- salem-that all the apostles, even Peter not excepted, were subordinate to James that he presided as episcopal judge, and produce seed the decree) sentence JNuw Sir while persons brought up in traditional or questioned belief in diocesan episcopal) and pre lac), may take all this as a matter of course and as gospel, you have thousands of readers, I am persuaded, that, like myself, look on it as a tissue of assumptions originating in a desire to find in history a vindication of ambitious ecclesiastic arrangements that are totally discountenanced by the Spirit and by word of God there is no conclusive proof in scripture that St James ever was bishop of the Church at Jerusalem much less that there was a Jerusalem diocese, of which he was bishop It is reasonable to suppose that the Churches organised by Paul were formed after the model of the mother Church at Jerusalem and if so, there was no distinc- tion in rank among her clergy In Acts ii 17, it is recorded-" And from Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus, and called for the ideas of the Church At the 28th. verse it is said lake heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, ile This last word overseers is that which is everywhere else in the New Testament translated " bishops, ' which, but for the episcopal predilections of the translators, it would no doubt have been translated here also. Had it been translated so, then every reader would, with a glance of the eye, have seen that elders or pres bitters and bishops were the same officers in the Church, whose business was, as Paul exhorts them, to pastime the Church of God, which he had purchased with His own blood Lest Mr Macarthur should think me a prejudiced interpreter, I refer him to the comment of the late Dean Alford on Acts xx. 17 in which, with admirable criticism, and still more admirable candour, he refutes the false gloss of Irenteus on this text, who introduced into it words that favoured a prelate distinction among Christian pastors Alford concludes his comment in these words -"So early did interested and disingenuous interpretations begin to cloud the light which Scripture might have thrown on ecclesiastical questions The English version has hardly dealt fairly in this case with the sacred text, in rendering episcopate (v 28) ' overseers,' whereas it ought there, as in all other places, to have been Bisiiois, that the fact officers and bishops having been on originally and apostolic ally synonymous, might be apparent to the ordinary English reader, which now it is not Thus the Church of Ephesus had several elders or bishops, and no one is addressed as having authority over another and none of the Apostles claimed on exercised such authority St James may have presided by common consent, as first among equals, over the gathering of " apostles, elders and brethren at Jerusalem But there is no valid proof that he did Mr Macarthur italicises the words therefore my sentence is, as if they must necessarily imply presidency But for proof that they must not do so, I refer Mr M to another episcopalian commentator s note on them, who resides "in) judgment or decided opinion (on. the matter) is So lucid IV GO, etc see Dr. Bloornhelci in loco I may also refer to the same word in the original in Rome -say , 5, one man, esteemed one day above another , another esteemed every day alike Here the Greek verb, twice rendered extremely, is precisely the same as is rendered my sente ice I admire the fearless tone of truth with which. Mr Macarthur defends the Public school system against the puzzling subtleties and special pleadings of the Chancellor of his diocese and I should not have noticed his ecclesiastic assumptions, but that, I fear, if they were not answered many of your readers would deem them unanswerable I remain, Mr Editor, your obedient servant, JOHN GRAHAM.
