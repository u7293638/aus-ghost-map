PORTFOLIO. Wbhitanntide.-The Holy Spirit is gien to Christians for a still better and higher par pose than to enable them to do miracles. That was needed for the preaching of Christi anity, but it is not needed now. And yet the Holy Spirit is as much needed now as then; and St. Peter, on the day of Pente.ost, maid to the people, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins and ye shall recieve the giftof the Holy Ghost. Forthe promise is unto you and your chldren, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our ;odshallcall." So the promiseof theHoly Ghost, the Comforter, is to as as much as to them. And the best and highest work of the Spirit is to sanctify, or make holy. We all need making holy. We all neel the Holy Ghost to sanctify nus. And it is better to be holy, and to love God and man, that. to do great miracles; for St. Paul nays. "Thoungl I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity " (that is love) "lam becomeassonnding brass, oratinklingeym aL " "And though Ihave all faith, so that I remove mountains, and have not charity,I amnothing." And remember,itisthe Holy Spirit alone that can shed abroad in our hearts either love, or any other good thing. Oh !let us not flatter ourselves by thinking we are in any true and living ense Christians and God's children, if we havenot the Spirit of Christ if we are not led by the Holy Ghost. Remember, if we would be saved, we most have the the Holy Spirit for our Sanctifier. as well as Jesus Christ for our redeemer. And we cannot have one without the other. Gooldoes nothalf save us. Eitheraltogether aved or not at all. And if we are altogether saved, then assuredly the Holy Ghost chang es and renewes our hearts, just as truly as the Blood of Jesus Christ washes away our Eins. We hare nobenefit in the cross unless we are crucifying our sins. We cannot he justfiied without being anctifieoL--Bsnor \\\~sL?'nat How.
