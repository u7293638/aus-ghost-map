At Eidsvolc? the other day a ballot — no, plebiscite -it \- 8ouuds better (if they would not call it 'plebiskyte') — was taken to select a Labor candidate, with the following magnificent result : Dent, 26 ; Forrest, 24 — no less than 50 votes in all. But what- happens? Do the whole party abide loyally by tho choice of the majority? Not' to any great extent. ; ' The Forrest party allege that duplicity was practised, and unless the reault is reversed,^ Mr. Forrest will be run as an Independent Labor candidate.' Of course. And if the result is reversed,. Mr. Denfc will be run as an Independent candidate. And if both of them don't look alive, somebody else will be r.un on the Independent racket. This is as it should be, strictly in accordance with precedent. The astounding part of the business is the number of votes recorded by red-hot, raging, democratic Eidsvold. Fifty all told ? In the name of wonder, where were the six thousand horsemen who were ready to patrol the border in the halcyon daya when Hinchcliffe used to bow-wow at Sam Griffith like a terrier pup at a great St. Bernard ? Gone to Paraguay or Coolgardie, perhaps. It is to be hoped bo. They will learn a salutary lesson in socialism at the one place, and have plenty of border to patrol at the other, if they want it. The Powersite faction, or ' strong ,' Opposition, are also confident, almost as years. Then they were going to sweep the country. And did ic too —with the fcodies of their slain. Very few survived to tell the tale. Nothing daunted, they are about to assume the offensive once more, and it is siid have got Mr. Macdonald-Pateraon as the trump card for North Brisbane. ? This gentleman is one of the political has-beens, like Mr. George Thorn ; like him too the irony of fate once made him a Minister of the Crown that posterity might busy ibself with the problem — how the deuce did he get there 1 Never mind ; the banks will support the Attorney against the Attorney-General, They have never forgiven the Government that taxed their ' promises to pay' out of circulation, substituting the accursed I Treasury note. The general public, who went more or less distractedly about the country wna pocgetBiui oi unnegotiaoie paper while the banks were ' closed pend ing reconstruction,' may rememember the financial reform to the Government's credit — all except those who aie sick for a change and must bave the old lot out, though they wera angels, and the new lot fallen ones. By the by, terrier Hinchcliffe in his annual (biennial?) report to the A.L.JF, last night was decidedly given to com pliments of the left-haDded order to the Parliamentary Labour party. ' If we are j to have honest legislation one must secure honest representatives — men who I will be prepared to advocate from 'heir place in Parliament, as ardently and con- I sistensly as they do upon the hustings, I the principles embodisd in the Labour I platform ; men who will be prepared not to bend at every political breeze wh'ch may spring up.' ? In other words it is high time some of the ins retired and gave the outs a chance. One man one Parlia ment ; that is the coining motto of the great Glassey party. You may or may not have noticed the article in last Saturd«y's Telegraph j under the caption of '' Free Library Trustees' ; theae consist of Sir Samuel Griffith, Hon. H. M. iNelson. Hon. T. J. Byrnes, Mr. J. L. Woolcuck, and Mr. Charles McLny. They seem eminently! ... ? 'sultaDie, every uuu oi uituu ; bh iug grstn; consultation again procsudeil to ho'wl and grin and spit at them iu a very frenzy of condemnation. Of course everybody about town knows the reason why, or more exactly the two reasons why. First tho odious Government which hunted 'Tattersall' appointed the trustees; second, we were passed by in the selec tion. Wherefore at a meeting of tho Free Public Library Provisional Com mittee last night, thejRev. G. Woolnough indulged in 6ome political Christianity as Bhe is practised in consultation offices, j The Government had insulted the Com mittee, that they had. Mr. Woolnock said Mr. Tozer was willing the Committee should nominate two additional trustees, but the rev. gentleman was fairly on his tail. ' Mr. Woolnough said his personal I 'nf*if? a TP/Miin iir»£ ii I InTC him f r* ronoittn n I nomination of that kind.' ! Of course there vas never intended to be any special session cf Parliament to deal with the Fede al Enabling Bill. There is no analogy betweea the Parlia ment of Tasmania (which he!d such a : 6easion)and that of Queensland. Tho former is in its prime ; the latter moribund. Being about to take the se :se of the country anew, it is only right the coun try's opinion should bo taken on so I momentous a departuro as federation. I Nor is there any tru:h in the report that Mr. Morehead has been asked to re.irein favour of one of the ni'.st unpopular sqnatters in hi3 electorate ! or that Mr. Isidore Lissner has been asked io cmtes? tho Burnett against Mr. McCord. I mean the Government havo made no such requests, as you may irell believe. j January 21s!-. j
