SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER25,1897. A few weeks ago there was borne to a grave at Bradford, across eleven miles of Yorkshire moors, one of the most remarkable Englishmen of this genera- tion. Sir Isaac Holden was one of those great captains of industry who, in the peaceful field of trade, sale vic stories, not perhaps quite so renowned as those of great soldiers on the battle- field, but far more beneficent. The story of Sir Isaac Holden is in one sense a romance. He began life as a miner's boy; he ended It a millionaire; and in that long climb from the gloomy drives of a lead mine to a seat in the House of Commons this Cumberland miner's son kept his character and honour as stainless as though he had been Sir Galahad himself. Sir Isaac Holden, by his Inventive and organising skill, practically created whole cities both in England and France. The Wool on the back of every sheep in Australia is worth a little more to its owner and to the world as the result of his energy and skill. Isaac Holden, too, was no Barney Barnato or Jay Gould, consumed with an insane greed for money. He gave away in Aviso beneficence every tenth shilling he earned, he was the trusted and generous friend of his workpeople. He built for them technical schools and mechanics' Institutes, and his coffin was carried to the grave through thousands of working men, standing bare-headed in honour of one who himself had risen from the lowest ranks of workers to be one of the princes of Industrial England. The story of Sir Isaac Holden is, in truth, about the most suggestive text upon which the politicians and working men of this colony could meditate, for the ideals which seem to be capturing the imagination of the working classes just UOAV will certainly make the career of any future Isaac Holden impossible. At 10 years of age the future millionaire and inventor was working as a draw boy in a cotton mill. After working fourteen hours inlay the lad attended a night-school, qr took lessons in a joiner's worUsh√ßp..'"'At 16 years of age he had learnt enough to avoid a place as assistant in 'a private school; at 19 years of age he was the sole support of his widowed mother and a brother. He worked from sixteen to eighteen hours a day, and by force of that Iron Industry qualified himself as a teacher of mathematics, classics, and French. The bent of his genius, how ever was towards practical location He became book-keeper to a fine of wooldiesscrs and quickly saw tlinttUe tedious and claims processes then in use might be improved He was told that the fibres of wool were so fine and delicate that the attempt to treat them by machinery was hopeless Next the less he bent his strong and eager by tin to the task of improve on the Moor comb bag process the story of the intense and tireless industry which he bred gift to hear on this task is worthy to stand beside that of Pallas the potter Holden exchanged the post of bool 1 open for that of manger of the works, and for fifteen years he spent sixteen hours ex six day in the mill He afterwards declared that but for the a certain? use of the Sunda, which he religiously honoured the strain of his soil must have killed him Holden during those blooding tireless years hit upon several most valuable Tuxen tions one for example, for the main factor of genappe 5ams 0111 again in 1894" for a reduction in the number of processes thieving had to 1,0 through rather invention would have made holden a multimillionaire but he was working for his flies and his firm had 1 looted and eccentric hatred of patents and Holdens inventions enriched others but not himself Holden claimed and with good reason to be the true inventor of the lucifer match In his early days while study In- and lecturer" on chemistry he used to Use at 4 o'clock in the morning, and laboriously Strike a light with the clause Hint and steel of the period He hit upon the idea of adding sulphur to in explosive mines i ii putting it on a splinter of wood and suiting It by friction and he actually struck the first lucifer match before his class of students After twenty years experiments and toil Holden produced what is called the square motion woolcombe -a machine apparently so complicated hint when last exhibited nobody but Holden himself could understand it hint machine however has revolutionised the wool industry throughout the world in Sir Leslie Holdens own f victories at Bradford and it -includes and at Croix in 1 mice nearly 40,000 000 Hotels are dealt with fetch it Croix alone Holdens factories raised the popular tion from less than 2,000 to 10 000 persons It is 1 proof of Holdens energy, that at one time he used to cross the Channel The nights each week doin" business both In lillico and Include In the great 11 men Prussian xMii of 1870 when work in his reach factories was stopped Sir Isaac Holden supported the whole of his miles till the will ended and work could be resumed No wonder that a man of energy so in tense and character so noble made him self one of the princes of the Industrial world And the social system which produces such men is Isaac Holden and gives them a career so splendid is one of which modern England may well be proud But it is clear as we have said that the new politics of the labour party would make such a story as that of Isaac Holden impossible Had voting Holden been nom ished on the iiitltistilal ideals represented may be our own Factories Act It is sale to say that he would have re mained a working man to the end of his days The very. impulse of self and! ince would have been killed in him. He would have expected a paternal state to protect him from himself to fix his wages to prescribe his hours of work to enforce his weeks' holiday He would have regarded the man who worked sKtet 11 bones 1 duty as little less than 1 criminal In the modem ethics of the Labour politician the only virtue is to work with the band and to do is little even of time as possible s.he is in work 01 who brings some great natural force into service today and so multiplies it a stroke the comforts and the resources of the world is looked upon with suspicion If his in Mention em aches himself then in the judgment of Ali Ben illicit and his school he becomes a more v Empire in one of the human 1 ice age If the now Ideals of 1 ibom conquer the world diameters life that of Sir Isaac Holden will become is absolutely ex lines as the dodo or the mc"nlosuurus AA bethel this would be a gain for the Ilsitiou 01 for the soil dug classes themselves is however, quite another question An odd strain it may be added ran through Sir Isaac Holdens character How lb erect and vigorous it 01 years of age. and he believed that by due regard to the laws of health there was no reason why he should not be 6 to 100 or even 120 the secret of long life he held last Indict and especially to avoid ing food- that left a line. deposit.

It is the general opinion that this consign- ment was much too dump, and contains, it is estimated, quite 25 per cent of moisture, whilst tobacco should not have more than about 10 to 12 percent In fact, as there is a very high duty on tobacco entering this country, the drier the tobacco is, so long as the strip is not broken, the better The tobacco is considered on the whole good and I promising and I may mention that the buyer told me that he fully expected to have I to give 4d Bread per lb for it but is this was in experimental shipment it is difficult to ascertain the exact value but the opinion of the experts appears to be that it is much superior to and in better condition than and which has up to the present come from the colony Tile Leaf is quite free from insect holes On the whole I think the colony is to be congratulated on this consignments and that it will be fully worth while to send further shipments 50 is to thoroughly test the market If you will advise me of the next consignment I will take special steps to see that it is put on the part of her under the most favourable conditions The question of river pollution is to re cciv e attention at the meeting of the Meho politan Board of Works on The day Com 111 sioner El hill his given notice of the following motion - that it is the lnWe step-, be taken under section 97 of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of works Act 1890 to prevent the pollution of the rivers creeks and watercourses within the metropolis and that it be referred to the sewerage committee to consider and if we At the next meeting of the Metropolitan Board of A\ works the following tenders will be recommended for acceptance Construction of "bert street branch sewer (sec J) P Morgan ¬£4 OOj a 0 plumbers sundries Yolla Deal sand Son Limited at schedule rates vitrified stoneware pipe bends A.
