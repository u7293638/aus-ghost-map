TO DAY'S RACES. CUP DAY AT MORPHETTVILLE. The S.A.J.0. Autumn meeting will be returned to-day, when the big event — the Adelaide Cup—will be run off, and for which the Government have granted a public holiday. Bbonld the weather ptove fiae the attendance U expected to be the largest on record at Morphettville, and there seems to be every probability that tbe elements will be favor able on tbia occasion. Mr.WbitingtsnandUie ocmmittee have t*ken pains to stady the convenience and comfort of their patrons, and in Older to avoid the delay at the past which occurred last Saturday have enlisted toe services of Mr. O. Watson, from Melbourne. Special trains will run at frequent intervals aj announced by advertisement* and the first raoe will start at 1 o'clock. The programme to -dsy opens with the Seoond Hardle Bftoe, for which seven candidates have accepted. The distance is quarter of a mile less than on Saturday but, and the top weight, Ivanhoe. has 2 lb. lew, while WalUby (11 at, 4 Ib.) who has been rained 9 lb, for fail victory, meets Ivanhoe on 11 lb. worse terms, and the latter waa three lengths behind him at the finish. Hortenae 11, baa only 8 lb. less, while Bachelor, 10 t\\. 6 lb,, is dropped 7 lb., and Star is on tbe same level. Bachelor baa earned weight better than Star, and should have more foot in the ran home, but Ivanhoe with a stand ap should win from Bachelor, with Star and Mystic to ace it ont for tliird place. In tbe Novel Selling Race we find ten candidates, whose weights have been fixed by their owners, and on reoent public running Lacecsbe ihould win from Parasite and Konca, with Mermaid as one who may give a winning tarn to her owner on this occasion. The Adelaide Gap. the big event of the day, is the third on the list, and from the number of horses who are left in promises to be tbe greatest Gap raoe that has ever taken place at Morphettville. A thousand sovereign prize (with deductions to second and third bone) it well worth winning, and the ownen who send their bones to tbe pxtmnrt have fait reaion to believe they have a chance of securing (he coveted eight hundred which ia allotted to the fiiet hone. Instituted ia 1864, many a gallant struggle haa taken place for the. pup. one of the most memorable being in Euolid'a year, 1683, when Commotion and two others ran a dtad heat for second place. Stints unex pected victory the year following was {allowed in 1884 by the great Malm's gallop borne in the mud, and in 1886 the v«nue waa changed to FUmioston, where Xtord Wflton annexed the stake, For three years there waa rash a deaith of racing in South Australia that no Cap race wsb contested; bnt on its revival in 1889 Mr. J. Oroaer's bone the liawyer won, and last year it was carried off by flhootover. Tbe Cup waa twice won by tbe same hone, Mr. E. M. Bagot's Oowrain 1886-7, and there are many who have the belief that The lawyer will win it for the second time on the present eeeasion. Fifteen is the largest number of starters who have competed at Morphettvflle, and as there are 36 yet on the list it seems quite likely that at least a score will go to the post to day. Stanley heads the list at 9 at. 3 lb., and •• he carried only 8 at 11 Ib. when he was beaten last Saturday by Enuc. 8 st 6d, (who haa 1 Ib. more in the Oop), it looks on paper as though the gallant old ehennt would again; be defeated by hia younger rival, although the distance is halt a mile farther. Harbinger ia not believed to be cherry ripe yet, and has given no sign that he ia «ble to beat bis stable companion today. Britannia ia a fast mare with weight-carrying and staling powers, and should ran a big race, although she did not get nearer than third to Knno in the Elder Stakes, Kmani haa been tried 'to often that he may be lucky on this occasion, tat n ye inclined to doubt it over this distance. The Lawyer won SB a tbree-rear old with 7 at. 10 Ib, on bis back, or 8 Ib. lees than bis weight-for age, and be is now placed exactly on the same footing by having 8 at. 9 lb. to carry. He has bad a long spell and a careful preparation, and has been backed by his owner. Judging by what The Lawyer baa been doing on tbe track and by the condition shown by The Deptsed and Lord GrenvOle, The Lawyer nanst meet a real clinker if he is beaten to day. Enue, 8 st. 7 lb., may be the one to pot dosra Mr. Crczier's representative, but he starts at a disadvantage with regard to weights, as he has S lb. more than his weight for age, or 7 lb. more than Lawjer when he won the Oop. Certainly Btmo has ran in the very best compeny on the other tide, and besides being third in the Oanlfield Cop, and fourth in the Melbourne Cup, he ran third to Highborn and WUga in the Place Handicap at the V.E.O. Autumn meeting, and third to Marvel and Wycombe in the Autumn Handicap, bo that be has ran well at all distances, but had not been lucky enough np tfll Saturday to score first place. There are differences of opinion bb to whether Enuc'a heart v in tbe right place when he is collared, bnt he came again when called upon last Saturday, although Stanley waa at hia head, and he baa foot enough to get away from many others who will not be near enough to bother him when approaching the post. By hia past performances Enuo haa proved him«?if to be a great colt, and it will take a racehorse to beat him if be does his best to-day. St. George is a brilliant goer when well, bnt is hardly np to concert pitch Juit now. The Masher ia very wellj and baa given his supporters every reason to believe that he will take a lot ol beating, Simpleton in this company ran hardly be more dangerous than he was in Melbourne. Mistletoe, by Boe —•'.."•— ~' t—. *?>r*rd six times last season and raven tunes (he year before without gaining a winning bracket, bat her party are very confident that she will ran a great mare on tbe present occasion. Maelstrom on his pact runnine would not be regarded a* a very dexgeroua customer, bat his supporters display a large amount of confidence in hia chanoea to-day, and he has shown each improvement of late that he is expected to ran a great horse. Viator, according to traok form haa very little chance, bat woo recently in the south-east and may show unexpected vigor to-day. Ad jotant is the kind of animal who may one day create a surprise, bat whether it ia on the present occasion remains to be seen. Shoot over appears to be off color; Emmie may find the distance too far. Boonoke is capable of better things than be hat sometimes done in small country events, and may display on expected form in the Onp. Adventnrona waa apparently outpaced in the Goodwood Handicap, and ought to be seen to more advantage over the mile and five furlongs. She has undergone a steady preparation and ia well accustomed to the course, and it in a galloping bumor ihould render a good account of herself. F.Btrieve haa been doing big thinga on the track, and is very well thought of, Tartar is supposed to have a chance, but Lon may be an absentee, Cheddar most display mnoh better form than he did in the Lager even at his reduced weight or he haant the ghost of a show, Milowill probably ran well, and Convene also. Go-Abead wiUfindthedistanoetoomuoh, but Clemency is highly thought of in some quarters and most be served by the light weight. If Quality baa recovered her Onfca cannita form she will be hard to beat. Bumming up we pick Ssco to win, with Quality land Lawyer to fill tbe places, and Mistletoe and Retrieve as da?geroas.l Toe Nursery Handicap should fall to Saa or Lord Grenrille, The Belling Steeple may be won by Bktiabk, with BUy? sad IV.tUe Lsdi?theplMMs. Tbe Fiiher Stakes may be anrwzed by Siab of Ebin. with Wattle anl Granite in the pUoes.
