A Disagreement- Did some'iody say the sunshine Was flooding the world to-day ? Did somebody say the- e were roses Abloom on the world's highway ? xiid somebody sing ot the gudness Filling this earth of ours In the time of summer and sweetnessâ€” The time of the birds and flowers ? It was all a mistake, my darling ; The sunshine has gone away. There is thunder off in the distance, There are clouds on the wretched day. Not even the ghost of pleasure Surveys ihe withered flowers ; The gloomiest place under heaven Is this weary earth of ours. Did somebody whisper ' Patience, The clouds will he rittcd soon ' ? Did somebody hint of music ? Why, the hearts are out of tune, Yet there are pipers calling That the clouds will pass away ; For love than wrath is stronger, And love is king to-day.
