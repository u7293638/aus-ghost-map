FISHER'S GHOST. A Legend of Campelltown. PART Iâ€”THE FICTION. FISHER'S -Ghost has just turned up again in London in his original form, and has natur ally attracted the at tention of Mr. Andrew Lang, the eminent, con noieseur in ghosts, who, by the way, does not seem to be aware that his namesake, John Lang, introduced the celebrated shade to the English reading world in '59, though in a very different make up. On this occasion Mr. Ottway acts as sponsor for him in a collec tion of tales, entitled "News from the Invisible World," which Mr. Andrew Lang recommends as 'a good blood- curdling book,' more especially in connection with Fisher's Ghost. He concludes his notice of 'the famous Parramatta story, as he calls it, by asking, 'Does any Australian ar chaeologist know whether a report of this trial exists in the archives of Sydney?' This is rather an amusing question, coming from such a source, because it implies, or seems to imply, that the ghost was expected to form a part of the circumstantial evidence on which the murderer was convicted. 'They were not so particular at Sydney,' he says, 'as they* were in a famous Highland case, in which the prisoner escaped because it was only a ghost that had grpen information to the police.'
