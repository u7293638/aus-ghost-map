THE SCEPTIC AND THE GHOST. A SOUTH GIPPSLAND INCI- DENT. The latest ghost story (says the Standard) comes from South Gippsland, and is connected with a deserted teacher's residence, which the Minister of Education, in the interests of economy, decided to remove to another part instead of putting up a new building. Mr Peacock was recently appealed to on behalf of a teacher in the locality mentioned to increase the size of his house, two rooms being rather too small for himself, his wife, and four children. The members for the district supported the request, and the Minister decided to remove from a distance of about four miles a house of about the same size, adjoining a school which had been closed, and thus increase the size of the applicant's home. After the contract for removal had been let, it transpired that the deserted house was ' haunted.' One of the contractors, however, was a sceptic, and scoffed at the idea of there being any spirits, divine or otherwise, or any spirit laud. He got the school-house on the waggon, and all went well till about 1.30 a.m., when a strange noise was heard in the adjoining room to the one in which he slept. The sceptic started up. He trembled and his teeth chattered. He waited only to partially dress himself, and, without looking in the room whence the noise emanated to see if a native bear was scratching himself, he leaped from the waggon and ran as fast as his legs would carry him for about two miles, leaving the horses to take care of themselves. He did not dare to come near the waggon again till the sun was up. The school house has been delivered, but in view of the contractor's experience the teacher's family hardly relish the idea of living in the building, and further representations have been made to the Minister of Education. All the concession, however, Mr Peacock would make was to order that the doors of the building were to be changed and re-painted. Possibly Mr Peacock's idea was to thus confuse the alleged ghost.
