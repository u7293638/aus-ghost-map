®oett?. The Shield. - Qh Idid you hear a voice of death 7: v* And didyou not matk thiBpaly fonn rl^u^irode 011 the silver mwt ot the heath, And sang a ghostly dirge lb the storm? Was it a wailing bird of the .gloom, Which shrieks on the house oi woe all night? Or a shiveiiog fiend that -flew to a tomfa^ To howl and to feed till the glance of light ? 'Twas not the death bird's cry from the wood, . Nor shivering fiend that hong in tne blast; 'Twas the 'shade , of Helderio—man of blood— . It streams - for the gailt of days -that are -past! Sse how the red, red lightning strays, And scares tbe gliding ghost of the heath! Now on tbe leafless yew it plays. • Where hangs the shield of the son of death! That Ehield ie blushing irith murderous stains; Long has it hung from the cold yew's It is blown by storms and washed by rains, Bat neither can take the blood away. Oft by that yew, on the blasted field, Demons dance to the red moon's light; While tbe damp boughs creak, and the swing ing shield Sings to the raving spirit of night 1
