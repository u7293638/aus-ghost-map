ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE« iTothc Editor of aeMaillaml Mercury) SIR-In one of your late issues appeared an advertisement for races to take place at Dnngog in September In reading over the list of prizes, amounting m the aggregate to a large sum, I could not help thinkiug how much moro good the same amount would do if expended in promoting an agricultural show, to be held at Dungog, and giving prizes for the beat plough men, and all sorts of farm and garden produce, not even omitting flowers It may «eem strange to you, Mr Editor, but it is nevertheless a fact, that bere, in this most fertile district, where vegetables of every description can be grown, with very little trouble, to great perfection, that very few farmera grow anything but pumpkins and a few potatoes, indeed, regarding the latter, I may say, that, for six months out of the twelve, they either go without or purchase from storekeepers who get them from Sydney or New c«stlo Well, what has this to do with horse racing? Much ' Last summer, I was for about a fortnight with a threshing machine, in all that time, nearly tho wholo of the conversa tion among the young men was abont horse racing Now, would it not bo far better to give them something else to talk about ? and would it would not be very nice for our wives, sisters, and daughters to bo able once a year to have a trnly healthful holiday, and to vio with one another in the production of butter, cheese, preserves, pickles, ¿vo, and even flowers ? I say flowers, because I believe the love for them, like the love for music, tends to refine men's minds I have no particular objection to horse racing, when the best horse is allowed to win, but I do object to onr young men having little else to talk about Maitland is too far off, and the difficulty in getting exhibits there too great to enable us to send any to that show. I believe if two or three energetic men could be prevailed apon to tako tho matter in hand, we Bhould soon have a very creditable associa tion, which undoubtedly ffould do an immens** I amount of good A B Tho W illiams, Juno 22, 1872 {Tb the Ed tor of Ute Maitland Mercury J SIR-In your isauc of the 2nd May I observe a letter, signed " Stockowncr, Worrcgodistriot, inviting expression of opinion on the cause and cure of cattle stealing in this colony And ns no reply, so far as I have seen, has as yet been made to that letter, save a few remarks of Mr D M Jones, of Walgett, appearing in your issue of the 30th May, I have decide! to givo my opinion and if it does no other good than call forth the ideas of abler and more experienced men my labour will not be lost But first, sir, a word upon Mr D M Jones's letter * * * * * But, sir, leaving Mr D M J and all tho other soap and tobacco soupers, of whom be ' speaks so contemptuously, I know not why, I would make my remarks on cattle stealing, it» cause and its euro First, its cause-I do not think there can be two opinions on that head Its cure is a matter of much moro grave im portance There aro few, sir who, like myself, hold stook property io the bush, wbo do not feel that the cure of this disease is as puzzling as it is desirable In the early days of the colony large tracts of country were taken up by men holding stook, and wonting room for them, while the depres sion in the value of stock rendered desirable the cutting off all expense possible in their manage ment We found accordingly large runs, with thousands of pounds worth of stock, placed in charge of men who, in numberless instances, had no characters to lose, men who had left their country for their country's good From the open nature of the country in which the stock depastured, and the tendency there was to a general scattering of the herds io seasons of drought, an opportunity was given to those in oharge to brand all strangling uobraoded cattle found on the runs of their employer, for these I cattle, so branded, runs were required, and | easily taken up This, sir, ia «here it has had ts beginning, of this there can be DO doub*, but tbis is of small consequence com pared to tbe other point, its care Its prevention to a largo extent can be cured no doubt by a wiso system of legislation Its cure I am not so sanguino abjut whilo tbo law of our land stands as at present Now, sir I believe a bill to eocourago the fencing in of the squatting nins of the colony, would do more to prevent cattle stealing, and give us more real protection, than all the police .vc shall ever be able to employ In tbo first place, the way cattle are gener ally stolen is as follows -Tbo stock bav ing nothing to prevent them wander jug on to the adjoining run, when tbey thus wander they pass from under the care and protection of their owner, and are then at the mercy, of course, of tho^o who hold the ad joining land (whose tenderest mercy would at many times be neglect) Bcfjrcyoucan legally enter on that run you must give notice, and be fore the time expires for which the notice is given, jour stock are driven where you bave not much chance of seing them If any should be found on the run with the ran cattle, coming to camp, they aro what is gene rally termed cut ou*, that ia prevented coming to the camp, for should they come to camp, trio man lookiug for thom would s»e and recover them If the runs were fenced tbi« at least would not happen, for the stook would bo stopped by the fence Irom crossing their own boundary It a lot of cattle were stolen tho difficulty of recovering them would bo much less than at pre sent, for they must leavo a track, which could not possibly escape the eye of the boundary man, and so leave no difficulty in deciding what was going on , if in fact all runs were fenced it would bo an impossibility to steal oattle as they are now stolen Now, Sir as feoemg runs has been proved, beyond tbe possibility of a doubt, to incrcaso their valoir, why should not the Legislature take up tbe matter, and cither fence the runs for the squat- ters, charging interest on the outlay, or what would be much better still, pass an act whereby all owner* of runs who would fence should bo protected in their outlay, whether in fencing tho half of their neighbour's line or otherwise If the said ncighbonr did not fence his half why should he not bo obliged to pay tho more activo man, who had improved his run for him by doing his fencing I say, sir, it is an estab- lished fact that runs are greatly increased in valno by being enclosed , and why should not | the good of the wholo be considered, rather than that of a fow do nothings, who will make no advance, and the moro so where it can be shown to prevent crimo A\ hy, sir, should not the outlay of fencing the run of the dilatory be put on to the rent of the man who had neglected to improva, and handed over to the man, or in other words taken off the rent of the man, who had done the idler's work for him There is anothergreat advantage would be le rived from fencing barefaoed daylight robbers would not then, as now, be allowed to travel the country for the sake of their neighbours' grass and water, with tens of thousands of sheep, or travel for no other purpose than that of dis- honestly living on their neighbours So much for prevention, but what for its cure This Sir, I fear, in the present state of our law, is a disease perfectly hopeless Our law requires, that the onus of proving a felony should be thrown on the accuser, failing which, the accused is held to be gmltleis Why would this be ? Can yon fancy or show a case, in which anyone might become possessed of pro perty, and be unable to give an ac count of how he became possessed If the thief, or suspected thief, was called upon to account for the goods found in his possession, and failing this, was held to be guilty, what a vastly different state of things we should have If, sir, in addition to thii, tbere was a good State reward, say from £500 to £1000, for all convictions, how long do you suppose the preseut state of things would continue ? How long would lawyers be able to twist and distort the noble principio of justice by the instrument we call law as tbey now do ? How often should we hear a Judge tell a prisoner (as I did) who bad literally admitted his guilt, as shown by good evidence, that be (the prisoner) left the court without a stain on his character ? This might seem sovcro upon a District Court Judge, but, sir, it is true Alas, for this fair, this lovely land of Aus tralla, this home of our childhood, this land of our adoption, where law reigns quite supreme, and justice dares not enter How well might we exclaim, while wandering in the desert of our crime stricken hopes, and haunted by the ghost of our murdered expectations-" Her bleeding honor cries aloud for vengeance ' her wounds, wil never close ' ' I am, sir, your obedient servant, THOS HUNGEErOBD Gnommery, 13th June, 1872 [Some parts of Mr Hungerford s letter aro so warmly expressed that we have omitted them If published, they would (if not libellous them solves) open the way to a purely personal cor respondence-ED MM] A BEUTAI.
