BlY AD DY. There is a little mlachief.maker S That is stealing half our bliss, Sketching pictures in a dream-land That are never seen in this. Dashing from our lipr the pleasure Of the present while we sigh; You may know the mischief- maker, For his name is ly and By. He is sitting by our hearth-stones; With his sly, bowitching glance, Whisp'ring of tihe coming morrow, As the social hours advance; Lolt'ring mid our calm reflections, Biding forms of beauty nigh; He's a smooth, deceitful fellow, This enchanter, Bly and By, You may know him by his winning, By his careless, sportive air, ly his sly, obtrusive presence, That is straying overywhere; Ily the trophies that he gathers, Where his sombre victims lie, For a bold, determined fellow Is this conqueror, By and By. When the calls of duty haunt us, And the presentseems to be All the time thalt over mortals Snatch from dark eternity, S Then a fairy hand seems painting l'ictures on a dainty sky, For a cunning little artist, Is the fairy Ily and ly. Or all the singular instances reported of human in telligence developed in animals, one of the most peciu liar exists in the facmily of an American gentleman. The wonderful little anilnal is a comnon house mouise, and the pet of Miss Lizzie, the gentleman's youngest daughter. It was caught in a trap last spring, and when about to lie drowned in a pail of water was rescued by Miss Lizzie, for whom it soon formed a strong attachment. Miss Lizzie is very fond of crocheting, and the mouse, whiich she has named "Little Billy," would sit on the table watching her by the hour. On several occasions, whlen the young lady laid down her work, " Little Billy " woulfafttempt to take up the crochet-needle anod follow her motions. Trihe thought at last occurred to her that lie desired to learn crocheting. She produced ia small crochet needle, and fastening it to a forepaw with a narrow ribbon, gavehcim sonime Ma:erme cord to practise with. It learned slowly at first, but with the careful and patient attention of its mistress, "Little hilly" ulti. mately overcame the intricacies of the stitchl:, and now crochets as industriously as its young mistress. It has already crocheted itself a nubia and small bed. spread, and is now engaged on a woollen hood for Miss Lizzie. OCEc upon a time some boys boarded with a teacher, in Scotland, whose house was not far from a country churchyard. They determined to alarm the old gravedigger, who was in tie habit of reaching his cottage, often late at inight, by a ihort cut throughl tie burying-ground. One boy, who was specially mischievous, and had often teased old .Andrew, dressed himself up in a while sheet, and while his companions were to lie flat upon tlhe graves, mnoan lng, whlcen the old man iapproached, " Bully Warren," as he was called, was to rise up slowly behind ca head stone, and finally to stand on its top, with his long drapery falling down on every side, sot as to give great height. Hand dignity to his pcrson. After waiting patiently, but not without some anxiety and fear for Anidrew, he was at last seen iapplroaching the memorial alone behind which Warren was enasconced. Soon a nlumber of low moans were Ihea]rd coming from among the graves. "Keep us a'!" exclaimed Andrew. "What's that? " And as lie approached slowly and cautiously toward tihe tombstone a white figure arose, and got. taller and taller before his eyys. "?VIhat's this?" askedl Andrew, with it voice which seemed to tremble with fear,although if any one had seen how he grasped his stick le would not have noticed his Ihand trembling. " It's the resurrec tion ! " exclaimed the irreverent Blily Warren. " The resurrection ! " replied Andrew. "Mahy I tank' the lee?erty o' askin'," Ice continued, slowly approaching the ghost, "if it's the general irne, or are ye just takin' n quiet dauinder (saunter) by yersel'?" Sosay ing, Andrew rushed at the ghost, and seizing it, while a number of other smaller arid darker ghosts rose aid ran off in terror to the school - house, he ex claimed, "Come aw' wi' me! I think I surely Ihena buried y- deep eneuch, when ye can rise sac easy! Bu It I hae dug a fine, deep grave this morning, atd I'll pit ye in't, and cover ye up with sao micleo irth, that my word ye'll ni get out for anithrli daunder." So saying, Andrew, by, way of carry)inc his threats out, dragged Muster Bully Warren to\war?l n nowly-made gravel I The boy' horror may he imagined, as Andrew was too powerful to adrmit of his escapo. lie cassailed the old mlan with agonised petitions for mercy, for he was a great coward. " I'm not ac ghost.! Oh, Andrew, I'm Peter Warren. Andrew ! Andrew ! don't Iury me ! I'll never again annoy your! Ohc--o-o-o-o--!" Andre , after having adminisetered what, he considered due punishment, let Warren off with the admonition: "Never daur too speak o' gude things in you way! Never play at ghicsts again, or leevcc folic like me iary grip a ghaisr like you, and tak a stick tnO yo I Aft wvi ye !" UNCLcc WILLIAM.

They are often raised about the merest trifles; and yet, when olnce biegun, are with the greatest difficulty imaginable brought to it friendly conclusion. L, cANCAsuin ItIFcnRtATIONS.-Many misecncetptions prevail as to the character of the recreations of Ithe Lancashire peoplo. It is supposed in the south that kicking their wives and punching all who differ from tlhm are the favourite recre."tions of tIe mten. Tlhere are, no doubt, some grounds for this belief. " If t lit doaena' shut up, I'll purr thee wi' miy clogs," was the answer of an Oldham roughl to ia fellot-l-passenger who objocted to smoking in a railway carriage; alnd but for the interference of another passenger the threat would have been carried out. No slmoker, howes cr well- bred, likes to be compelled to put out his pipe; and it would be sl rather dangerous operation to eject a haw-brcaker in the person of a collier, especially it lie haind his bull dog with him. One of the diversions of the factory lads in the north of Lancashire isjumping ; anld, in order to becolme eflicient ill the art, theyi dis pense with all theirclotling, however cold the weathcer. A Preston newspaper of the 5tttitIatuar'y, 185.1, reports the arrest of ten youths charged with obstructcing Iie footpath, "jmnnping in n state of nudity." Fities varying from Is. to Â£1 were infsicted upon thes! offendcrs against pullic nmorals. Jutllling in it state of nature must not, Iowenover, Ie considered oine of the usua!tl recreations of tlhe Preston lads. tlliclckburni, ill thie north-west of Lancashire, is generally considered the centre of the rough cleinolt. of the county. It was at Blackbturn where an imagitnltive journalist uaid the scene of the cock fieght, in the itummer of 1883. The sublject led Mr. T. D. Sullivan to put t question to the Holme Secretary, whose reply was mlost facetious "T'le honourable tetlnber will ob:serve," said Sir ~i'm Ilarcourt, " that in order thereshoutldbe i proi;eceut ion it is neccs~ary there shlould be all Ocffelit? and an offender, andi in order that proceedings should be talen it is essential that there should have beten a cock light. It is true that thle details appearcd in tmost of the public journals, but I live before observed that, these lire harrowing ind heartrendtng incidents, and If ia romantic character, which tretsnt intended tobetaken as true. 'rThey are works of ficl ion, and are favlrtiailea subjects among journalists." Surely, also, that was a work of liction whic appearedit ii a ltndon evening paper on it certain day in April last, describing aia "incursion of Northern barba:rians, hot-blotoded Lancastrians, sharp of tonlguel, lroulgh andl readily, of uncouthl garb and si)eechi." If wie andit the truth of some of these allegations, we deny that. the picture represents the real character of .ilancashire working men. The form of their recreat ions differs in dilferent towns. fThe disciples of lsee Walton nulmber iitiiiy hundreds in Bolton; and, in fact, all through tile colliery districts lishing is becoming a populahr plursuit..
