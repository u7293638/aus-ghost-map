A Disagreement. Did somebody say the sunshine Was flooding the world to-day? Did somebody say there were roses A bloom on the world's highway? Did somebody sing of the gladness Filling this earth of ours In the time of summer and sweetnessâ€” The time of the birds and flowers? It was all a mistake, my darling; The sunshine has gone away. There is thunder off in the distance, There are clouds on the wretched day. Not even the ghost of pleasure Surveys the withered flowers; The gloomiest place under heaven Is this weary earth of ours. Did somebody whisper 'Patience, The clouds will be rifted soon'? Did somebody hint of music? Why, the hearts are out of tune, Yret there are pipers calling That the clouds will pass away; For love than wrath is stronger, And love is king to-day.
