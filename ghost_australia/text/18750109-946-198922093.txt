THE BRIDE ; OF THE ; WHITE HORSE; '/ CUAPTBR II. : . v It was no more than half-past seven on the morning of Harriet Kettering's wedding-day, and, restless 'and unable to sleep, shebad already risen. ',. - .:: . It vras a beautiful chamber wherein she Bat, and furnished, by her : loving father's care with' all the modern appur ?II tanancos and luxuries of a ladys If boudoir. The curtains of the bo.l and III windows were of light bluo damask, the HI former edged with lace, and the panels III of the room were painted with a variety || of coloured humming- birds, which gave 1| it more the; appearance of a; drawing. II room than of a Bleeping apartment. luV Further, although the year was so far Bj| advanced, there were several stands in HI the ante or dressing-room filled with Hlj choice plants, so that, even in the dreary, H month of November, the place was like a,' ?|| fairy retreat. The room; was moderately l|| heated by a patent stove, which' served Hf to bring out the fragrance of the flowers, ?It and thus the atmosphere was almost like. Hi that of a garden. . ' .' ?-?,?..-?:'. Hi Harriet Kettering threw, on a loose ? I wrapper, and gazed musingly out of the Hi window at the gloomy sky, which threw Hi a 8ray pall— neither mist r\6r,, fog,' ex-' III actly, but a combination of uboth— over l]{ clump of dark evergreen ) oaks; which If Burronnded thg' mansion.' .In .the dis ||( tanceshe could see, the long, line of If white breakers, which indicated that the If tide was rapidly approaching its lowest If ebb. ' A few seagulls were flying H listlessly over the expanse of sand; now ?E and then dipping their, wings in the re H ceding water.' s . '. ' Iff There was something inexpressibley ?1 mournful and depressing in* the aspect 1|| of the morning, and in the dead silence I of the lonely shore, and the 'bride elect I felt its influence, for she sighed.

Then, indeed, the whole frightful consequence of .the yoiing lady's rash ride flashed, upon tho horror-stricken housekeeper^ and,' losing, all 'her pre sence' of mind, she dropped the' silver waiter, smashing the decanter to atoms, arid rushed into the dining- room, where she poured forth the horrible tidings to the assembled guests. /With various exclamations of consternation and com passion, all rose to their feet. 8hortly the entire house was in a terrible commotion! ' Ladies, .in various stages of their toilettes, peeped trem blingly over the bannisters. Frightened maidservants ran to and iro, arid there was much weeping, and. lamenting, and bewailing, and suggesting, and con jecturing; but, as is usual in such scenes when women are the actresses, there was nothing done. Meanwhile, the gentlemen; in a body, including the stricken father^ had donned hats, and capes, and coate, and taken the precaution of carrying strong ropes, in the hope, of rescuring the lost lady, if rescue should be needed; and sbmebf them on foot and some on horse back, made the best of their way to the promontory of tho White Horse. As has been stated,, the headland of the White Horse ran out some distance into the sea. Therefore, by proceeding as nearly as possible to its extremity the excited anil anxious crowd of searchers could look down, upon the quicksands on either side. There was indeed, no positive certainty as yet that Harriet Kettering had ridden along the beach at all. Their sole reason for so thinking was Bridget's assertion of her mistress's intention. Miss Kettoring might have ridden across country; but mostof the searchers, could riot dis ' giiise from.thernsoiyeB -the fact that, had 5ih'is^b«en^;8o,,;8lieJ5i^^,^n^y^ bability; have returned ubrne long' '{ife- yibusly' to Knoll-Pevis. ' The 'tide Was now flowing rapidly, and the fAnds were in '.their, first 'stage of transition. They unstable, but not a3 yet positively dangerous.. The searcher strained their eyes to , the utmost to penetrate the gloom which enveloped both sides of the headland. At last Ralph Skevening exclaimed, in an agonized, yet hopeful tone^— ' . ?? '1. see her ! She is makingfull for the point.' , ? ,. ... /?All looked eagerly' in the direction which he indicated. It was quite trae, Harriet Kettering was distant from the ?point some half riiile, on, the side of it farthest from / Knoll- Pevis, and was putting Bella to her utmost speed to reach the White Horse. .'.' / ., ? The brave girl knew that could she , but reach the headland, and. ; again the bay on the. Knoll-Pevis side, she / would! in all probability, be saved. . , On, and on, and on she rode .towards .them, whilst the air rang .with the cheers of those who, with; beating hearts, encouraged the intrepid girl. All . waved their hats and handkerchiefs frantically. / She saw them, and, waving her whip in' return,' dashed on.,.. ; ?'? She had now approached so close to the base'of.the point that the squire was 'enabled to call his daughter by name, arid, sounding the more distinctly for the increasing joy, the bystanders could plainly hear her, answer— ' ? , ,' ; i /^Papa r -'\J'ri.:-'. . .,? '/.'.??:? ? .'.' Suddenly,. when she was about .fifty yards/ from. the cliff,,' Bella, shorted, throw uiv her head, arid, trying' to plant her.fore feet in the ground, whose power of motion' she already felt, refused to. proceed.///., .., /.

The rapidly-advancing tide had already sufficiently loosened the ground to render it half qnicksand, half quagmire, and every time the mare endeavoured to raise her foot it was drawn back as with an iron grip by the suction of, the wet Eand. She was over the fetlocks now. She could not advance or recede. ' The spectators of this cruel scene wept aloud as they beheld the unhappy girl, who was now doomed, drop tbe bridle, and bury her face in her bands. It was but for a moment, and then she regained her self- possession and sat boll upright in her saddle. ' '.Happily, her. father beheld not the harrowing 'scene ; be had sunk to the ground insensible. The wretched bride groom was forced to lock on at the destruction of his all but wife. The spectators fairly broke down with grief and compassion, as they looked on the white face of the . young man, . and distinctly audible came the voice bf the devoted girl,' uttering desparingly tbe touching words— * ; ' GooJ bye, my Balph !'' Ten minutes passed. The sand was up to Bella's girths, and the poor creature, utterly subdued, uttered only faint moanings now. She sank, 6ank, sank, till she was suffocated, and the bystanders beheld the horrible spectacle of a living rider on a dead, horse, and shortly to share its fate. Harriet sat motionless as a statue, her eyes fixed on tho sky above her. She was already almost beyond the things of eartb, and her white, noble, determined face showed, only by the convulsive tremor of the lips that it yet sustained any consciousness or life. The lookers-on kept a silence on broken as that of the grave. Not a man could stir for his life. All heads were uncovered, all heads bowed, save that of the father, who lay senseless on the ground. In the presence of deatb, and of death in such an -awful shape, the ,bravgsts.i)iearjs: quailed^ ,wjth the bit- .. XBrOTt'an'gmsb'^!: ,. ' ?;J':'»-'-^:,J-/. ;;''?' ' .. Ten minutes more passed. The cruel snnds were up to her waist » now ; but she still kept her arms free., and held her riding hat firmly in hi-r right hand. ''.... Tbe agony of the lookers-on on the cliff was intense— worse even than that of the poor victim; .Tears rolled- down the hardest faces, and the. little knot of horror-struck witnesses to the catastro phe, beyond human aid, to avert, breathed ?? short and audibly, as. if but one heart served to quicken all their . pulses. Some groaned ? one or two fainted ; but 'the majority looked, fascinated, on the awful trageJy which was enacting be fore them. One moment morel The brave-hearted girl raised ber white-plumed hat, and waved a last farewell to the sobbing spectators of her living entombment. One last de spairing shriek, wrung from ber , courageous soul in its dire extremity, rent the air, and the cruel sands closed over the bright young head.
