^^^IJVnSM AHD TRABS. Thedepmsion ct trade'wbichprevaiball over Earope and '^orth America, has been accounted ferinf eo many ways as to be wilder rather ^than to Alighien those who wbuld like to be eatiafied in their own mhiaa that they, have fathomed the mystery. The Franca-Germanio ?rar and i© sequela did duty ^fqr a long time as ^ftuxbing elementa 5 then the collapse of tne borrowing and -xepudiatieg etatea .gave a rsevere shock to credit; everywhere, aa-i soon :afbSrward3i9ie troubles in. the £aa&j; afforded 'fresh' cause 'for anxiety : and ;-Jia- Jtrust. '???'? A €i&tent; set of iaflaeucea led- to the American reactioD, acd 'Sieexciteinect nnsfidliy tibe jp-eaiaentija election afforded a fical excuse for the neglect of bnsineaa. 'Various minor cau3£3 have from time to time been cited as auxiliary coniribu lories to the disturbance ; bat aiter-they have ail been duly considered, .-.there, remaioa a feeling that there is still something to be accounted for, and people begin to wonder when the revival' is to begin. We are afraid that it would be raah to fix an early date for the turning of the tide, for there ia: an influence at -work which lias been* overlooked, but 'which we believe to be more potential than aay of ihoae which have been adduced, and the remedy for which is not easily found. It is the fashion nowadays never to mention the name of Malthgs unless it be to point a joke or provoke a sneer, but it is neverthe ksa the fact that his chief proposition — that the increase of population is usually more rapid than thegrowth o£ the means of subsistence— is inconteatiblc : The relief afforded by the flow of emigrants to the colonial world has daring the last thirty or f orcy years kept the unpleasant fact in the background, but there are now indications that it is about, to force itsdf into recognition once more. In 1S73 and 1874 the unregulated migration to the United States was overdone ; in 1S75 this door of relief .was nearly dosed, and in 1S76 there was positively a refiox of the tide, the passengers to Earope actually exceeding in number the emigrants there from. Simultaneously with this stoppage of the outlet which had been affording relief there has been aa unprecedented increase of population in Europe. The census 01 tne Uerman Empire taken at the end of 1S75 showed that in the preceding four years the increase had been at the rate of one per cent per annum, whereas previously the rate had been little more than one-half of this. It is knovm that the same is the case in the Austrian Empire and in Italy. In the language of the actuary, the -value of life ' has everywhere been increased, and even in France, -where under the Imperial rule it had begun to deteriorate, there is a decided reaction.' Iu Great Britain and Ireland tho increase duringihe ten years ending with 1S41 was only 2.6per cent, in the next ten years it rose to 5»S ; in the last censu3 decade it was S.5 j and it is now reckoned that when the census is next, taken the rate will be found to be over 10. There has been no corresponding increase in emigration, although the demand in the colonies for English manufactures has sufficed to keep up the prosperity of the industrial classes j bxitttus, too, is now being checked, and its continuance is not to be -looked for. There is, however, suva a,' mass of accumu lated wealth in Eughvud that the check has iiot yet been felt in all iu severity. It is otherwise in Germany and Austria, where danger is to be apprehended froia the number thrown out of employment. In the latter country tho unemployed are set dowa as over a million. In France the talk 'weavws are suffering severely 5 and from Russia come wailings which, sdtliough indistinct, are agonising. From the partial stoppage of emigration things must go on from bad to worse. The extent of the relief offered in former years way be estimated from the fact that in 1874 tHe emigration from Germany amounted to 130,506 souls, from Denmark 4000, from Franco 12,C00, from Ttady 26,010, ftxwu ' Sweden 12,000, from tho Uuited Kingdom 241,000 aud from those countries where no account is kept there was probably sufficient to raise th&- total from Europe to naif a million. 01 courso the full tide of emigiation may lbe resumed, but something mow is wanted, and tho collapse in the United States $uy*9 that ;it -'may ^?be^^0TOrdo^^«:pt;; ^ ^em^gcajitB b««Ent -out mote :;-;$UH&^tifc^ ? : ^ ^iey ^ «an ^jaflbBarbetJ, ite aiffiialty i» Aiftet^-not gotrM -of. ^e'duflc^k^is^y - no means Teassiiring. ^^ There is 'only -a» Anatr^ia ^3;1;«My-.Kw&'--iimenca5n:^i» .world^ and althougli ^^ theJoeis'r^omjEmbt^' m liem/ tot the, whole''' ^^uiafidn;'''^f.:.'
