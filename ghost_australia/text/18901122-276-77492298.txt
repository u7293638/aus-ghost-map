Little Gray Ghosts. A big farmhouse in New Jersey long stood ienantless, and had the reputation of being haunted. At last a young farmer and his wife moved in at a merely nominal rental. An unearthly clattering on the Btairs frightened the couple half ont of their wits the first night, and the wife tried topers jade her oonEort to get up and investigate. For an hour he argued desperately with her on the advisability of lyirg still. She declared/ that i! he wouldn't investigate she must die' or get up herself. Finally they affected a compromise by creeping out of bed together. They lit the lamp and looked oauiiously out of thg ohamber door. The first glaeco solved the mystery. Big gray squirrels literally swarmed up all the landings, and everyone of them has a big nut of some kind between his pawa. The main supplyof nuts was Btored in an unused garret, where some tenant had placed them long ago. The squirrels arranged themselves in gangs on each landing, and those at the top,of the house carried the nuts one by one out of the garret and sent them rolling downJhe stairs to the next landing, where they were met by the gang waiting for them, and pushed down another Sight. In this way they reaohed an eld cellar, which was evi dently the iqirirrels' storeroom, for it was well stocked with nuts. They were moving -from attio to basement.
