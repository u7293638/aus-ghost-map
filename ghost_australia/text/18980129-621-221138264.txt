YOUNG f OIKS' . THE BEGGAR CAT Poor little beggar cat, hollow-eyed and gaunt. Creeping down, the alley-way like a ghost ot ' want. . . Kicked and beat by thoughtless boys, bent on cruel play ; AVhat a sorry life you lead, whether night or day. Hunting after crusts and crumbs, gnawing . meatless bones. Trembling at a human step, fearing bricks and stones, ' Shrinking at an outstretched hand, . knowing only blows, Wretched little beggar cat, born to suffer woes. Stealing at an open door, craving food and moat, Frightened off with angry cries and broomed Tortured, teased, and chased by dog, through the lonely night. Homeless little beggar cat, sprry is your plight- Sleeping anywhere you can, in the rain or snow ; Waking in the cold, grey dawn, wondering where to go, Dying in the street at last, starved to death at that; Picked up by t'nc scavenger— poor tramp cat! —Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
