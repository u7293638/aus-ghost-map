ROYAL ITALIAN OPERA COMPANY. DOS GlOVAXXT. The performance at the Theatre Royal last evening was witnessed by Sir Anthony Musgrave and by one of the largest dress circle audiences that has assembled since the commencement of the season, and it was worthy of even more liberal patronage "Don Giovanni," the opera which filled the bill, is a work that is seldom attempted unless by exceptionally powerful companies to require, in the way of stage mechanism and effects, are not very many and not of a character which would prevent an order lly competent management from satisfactorily mounting it Kio music in score does not look so very formidable, although it is in reality one of the finest inventions of Mozart's magnificent genius, and is regarded as a Colossus amongst operas Neither the conceded nor the solo music seems to present difficulties which could note surmounted by ex enan average company of artists, and, moreover, there is none of it so very familiar to the ordinary theatre-goer that slight errors of reading or vocalisation would be noticed The situationsaiepowerfulundev en sensational, but the public does not always expect to find lush tonic as well as musical skill developed each to any great degree of perfection in the operatic artist And yet there is an made gamble something which militates against the success of most of the performances of Don Giovanni There is probably no open at present on the stage which so seldom finds adequate representatives, and most Italian opera companies -Bill brilliantly sing the music of a Donizetti, a Verdi, or a Bellum, and miserably fail when they take up this composition of Mozart's It is gratifying to be able to say that such has not been the case with Mr. Simonsen's company In two of Donizetti's operas they have achieved great succès«-"Lu^ia di Laimnoi moor" and " Lucrezia Borgia" were the late son's of the season-hut " Don Giovanni," if not one of their finest accomplishments, was at all events so creditably performed as to delight the audience, and to show that the company 13 capable of intelligently undertaking trying musical work Signor Pimnzzom, who on all occasions has proved himself a capable actor and invariably enable singer, was cast in the part of the amorous, -A vicious, and yet courageous Don All through his performance how as excellent, but in the scene in the third act, where his henchman, the equally licentious but more chicken hearted Loporollo, commences a serenade to the Donna Elvira which Giovanni ends for him, Signor Ptmnzzonl succeeded entirely in sinking his personality and assuming that of the audacious heroine who will run all risks and face all dangers to gratify his propensities In the last act, too, where he at first jeers at the equestrian statue, erected in commemoration of the value of H. Commendatore who in fair fight and while defending his daughter's honour fell by Gio- vanni's sword-and is afterwards horrified to hear from the marble lips reply to his mooking taunts foretelling his doom, SignorPiniu7.coniwa8\ciyuffecii\e His gaiety vanished, and as the ghostly declama- tion reached his cars he assumed an air of unbelieving bravado In the next scene the interruption of the feast by the entrance of the muted but now welcome ghost was treated with a white skilful outward simulation of courage which only cooled when the stony speciro grasped his hand, and the melodramatic ending came to all the gay broke's crimes and Holies Signor Pinafores had a huge share in the con- certed music, which was the most enjoyable part of the performance, and he sang very well indeed Of Ins BOIOS the ana "Doh violin" was the best. The part of Donna Anna does not give opportunity for so much display as others in which Signora Taghavia has appeared, but how representation of it was very pleasing, and her miKrnig of the areas " Or say chiffonier" and "Norma dir" were equal to anything she has done in Brisbane But perhaps the most unexpected triumph of the evening fell to Miss Graupner Hitherto this young lady has had little opportunity of displaying the powers of ha sweetly fresh voice, but in the part of the Donna Elvira there was some of the most tuneful, and also most difficult, music in the open, and she sang it with an accuracy and usefulness which far exceeded the expectations of her hearers There was no indication of that nervousness which might have been excused young singer attempting a lending part, but she sang with perfect confidence, and her voice was fully equal to all the difficulties of the music Signorina Rebottaro as Zerlina was also very successful Her acting, as it always is in the lighter class of characters, washam singly free and unconstrained, and her singing of the splendid In at III a passages with which this part abounds, was, as is usual with her in music of a like class, extremely beautiful Signor Buzzi entered into all the fun of the first three acts with gusto, and was very amusing, although he was careful to exaggerate in nothing in the last act he was to the bro the object coward intended to be represented All his music was given with his customary care His principal solo "Made anna" was loudly applauded, but an encore was denied Musette was played by Signor Cerne, and his make up was undoubtedly the boat thing of the kind that has been as yet attempted by any member of the company His noting and singing were equally satisfactory Signor De Alba was It Commendatore He had not a great deal to sing, but his grandly rolling tones were heard to great advantage during his brief appearances on the stage in the first and last acts The part of Don Ottavio was fairly well played by Signor Santi nell, and his singing of the aria "II mio resort" was well received, though it was not equal to some of his other efforts Many of the solos were redemanded, but in no case was a repetition given The trio "Prorogation is gusto" in the second act between Donna; Anna, Donna Elvira, and Don Ottavio was splendidly given, and in this, the only eade, an encore was allowed. The staging of the oper 1 was satisfactory, the dresses being admirable, and the scenery appropriate The small amount of chorus work there is was very well done, and the orchestra, under Signor Hazon, did ample justice to the marvellous effects with which Mozaithas overlaid and beautified the vocal score The opera will be repeated this evening
