OBJOIN OF THE HAJJ-HAiJ., FANATICISM The following, despatch h^&.been forwstt4'e$ by the Assistant Motive Secretary ©| jScv Zealand to the/Seer$tary of State for th®; Colonies z—^Ehb Main* account 6$ the bright of Pai Marire, as sigaifyfoglfce oa/metff their | new religion, is singularly and sttperstitioufely j. associated ? withthe wreck of the ^ Lord Wor slejr. Horopapara Te -IJ% the- originator, is ^ ; Tarariaki native,. and was, for years a teacher. On the occasion of the Lord Worsley/being, wrecked, he tried very hard to tn&hcfe; the tribenot 10 interfere with the wreck further than to render assistance, and desired theiato allow us free access to the wreck; but having; ; been opposed by th.e tribe, he was said to havf taken their stubborn opposition very mujch; to heart., and wentwrong in his mind in con sequence thereof. "A few weeks after tb# wreck of the tord Worsley, he came from tfae* Taranaki district with another native teaches named Totaia, to Poutoko, Bopata Ngaron gomate's place, inhere he sent, for me. X went to them And bad a long conversation with them. Totaia was a strong Kingite, and wanted peace on their own terms,, which re quired considerable coiwjes ions en the pari oft the Government. Horopapara wanted; pea^e* and would consent to any terms the Govern ment might propose. He said he . wa* a Government inan, anddidnot want a Mairo King: and On being crossed by Totain, h'«r became very mach excited, and. showed unmistakeable signs of insanity and madness, At that time nothing had been said of the new religion by that name, and the, tribe regarded Horopapare as a madman, and kept watch over him. A short time after this he used violenc* towards the wife of Te Meiha (Big Jack) y and in retaliation Te Meiha punished him severely by beating him, and tied him hand and foot. From this time the superstitious part of : the tradition as regards their Pai; Marire commenced. Horopapara states thai tbe Archangel' Michael and the Archangel Gabriel, together with an innumerable host of ministering spirits, came ashore from the Lord Worsley, and that whilst he was tied hand and foot, as before mentioned, the angel Gabriel appeared before him the first time, and told him to release himself from his bonds,, which with the slightest effort he did. That on Meiha seeing him released, he again seized and chained him, and put a lock upon the? chain. That Te; Ua then said: " What is this to me ? ' and with, the slightest effort again burst asunfigr the chain, and every link wa* broken rand- scattered upon the ground, and Horopapara. set at liberty. The spectator* then began to say among themselves, 'Can h* have done this of his own strength, or is it some supernatural influence ? ' and from that time; thfy began to be afraid^if hfe- le Ua then wpat to hja^owa place in Upper Taranaki, and on a certain day he was in hisownhouse, and fell asleep, Mid was in a trance, when, a great light descended from Heaven, and a voice called to him, ' To rise and stand on h» feet,r yrhen he saw a great multitude of every race upon earth, A voice then said to him~ ' Horopapara; go/out of your house, take your son and kill him.' Horopapara: took his son,, and twisted the legs until tbe bone broke ia several places. A voice then cried—> Horo papara, space your son. The augelGabriei then said—;* Take your son, and wash binfe with water.' He took his son to a rive»£ called Wairau (in the Upper Taranalri dis trict), and washed hitn, and the lfeg' Waik; restored whole as the other. The aa^gel Gabriel then said to him—4 Go back to yOtiir house,, and erect a new niu.'. Horopapara inquired of the angel what a niu was.. Th* angel replied, VA post/ Horopapara inquired for what purpose? The angel replied,, 'Wort for you for the acquiremeatb^ the. languages of all races upon the earth.7 Horopapara inquired of the angel who . was . to impart to him the" gift of languages. Tha* angel replied* ^The spirit of God. passing; : with the winds, will teach you.1 Horopars^. then asked the angel, ^ What ofthe winds ?' The angel replied, v As the wiiids of Heaven. proceed to all the quarters of the globe,: so from the niu proceeded all the differentfornt*, of . religioji upon earth.' The angel Gabriiel then sungpthe following hymn::— " Gabriel's song of love 'to his people, standing ; naked.
