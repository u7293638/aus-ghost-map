V.A.T.C. SUMMER MEETING. -Br TelezraDh. Melbourne, December 26. These races held to-day passed off most successfully. The weather was beautiful, and the attendance fair considering the numerous counter- attractions. The Grand oiana enclosure, nowever, was ininiy patro nised, owing in a large measure to the want of proper accommodation on the railway, cattle trucks only being employed to convey visitors to and from the course. The new betting-ring, outside.which betting was pro hibited, was used for the first tune, and gave great dissatisfaction to the bookmakers who, while cheerfully paying the pound license fee, complained loudly against the restriction imposed, and after, two or three races they left the ring, and carried on operations out side as usual. The ring, which is enclosed with a low picket-fence, was open to the public. The chief ground of objection was that being situated some distance down the saddling paddock, it prevented business being done after the horses went to the post. In the Hurdle Race a protest entered by the owner of DhuninghUe against Lady fiamp den, onthegroundof crossing, was dismissed. The follopring are tho particulars :— SELLING RACE, Of 100 sots.
