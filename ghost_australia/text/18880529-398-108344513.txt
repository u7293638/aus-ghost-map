Xafries' Column. Spoken in Anger. 15Twns but a little word in anger spoken. : While proud eyes flashed through bitter, Â£ burning tears ; i iSut oh, I ieit that fatal word had broken I The cord of love tbat bound our hearts for years. Thy tortured face3 that long, wild look of sorrow, Like some pale ghost, must haunt me while I live; And yet, how bright, bow full of joy the mor row, Had I but breathed one simple word <i Forgive !" I did not hear the tender voice appealing. Nor marked thy anguish when I cried, " De part 1 Too blind to see thy pitying glance, reveal ing : The generous prompt'ngs of thy noble heart, j How could 1 know t!sat faithful heart was | yearning, I Though crushed and wounded to its inmost | core, i To take me back, like a weary bird retum ! in2 I In fear and trembling, when the storm, ia o'er, " lleaiember, love, that it may be forever ; !To see my face no more by night or day. t Be calm, rash heart, think well before we j sever, ! Uecall the angry word and bid me stay." j Dead silence fell; the song-birds hushed their { singing. " Enough," I proudly cricd ; " I choose my fate." While even through ray maddened brain kept ringing The death-knell of my love-too late, too latci " Forgive, forgive 1 " I wailed, the wild tears streaming, As, "mid the moaning trees. I stood alone ; " Love, let thy kisses wake me from my dreaming." Thy pleading voice, thy tortured face, was gone. That angry word, I may recall it never ; For o'er thy narrow grave rank weeds have grown. " Remember, love, that it may be forever." A.b, words prophetic ! love, had I but known I My locks are gray, my eyes are dim. with weeping, The face once loved by thee, no longer fair! Beneath the daisies thou art calmly sleep ! ing: ! There a lone woman often kneels in 1 prayer. -Ah, sweetheart mine, thou art so lowly 5ying, Thou canst not hear the tearful voice above, Tbat with the night wind evermore is sigh ing, " I spoke in anger; oh, forgive me, love I " ?Fanny Forrester.
