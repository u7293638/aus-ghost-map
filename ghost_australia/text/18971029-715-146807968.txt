The old! lady-looked at it, and her lips trembled. She gave a slight imperceptible start.

The j tea parties had:dispersed; in a very little ] it Would be time for dinner, and the few | ladies left bad gone to the silence rcomto ] write letters. Something had made the ] colonel a little nervous. He drew out, a j cud hastily, and; with it a little souie-i thing wrapped in tissue paper, at which ] beared suddenly, as if he had seen a j And then he laughed abruptly and oddly. 1 " It is the ghost of my own romance ! An odd thing—an odd coincidence, after ornr conversation 1 My dear madam, it is difficult to realise that I was once a young lover, with these few spare flakes of snow on my head now—but it is true ! And this — he unfolded the tissue paper care fully—" this was a lock of hair from the golden head of the girl I loved 3 Foriy years ago ! If she is alive it will be white hair now-!" She had bent forward, and she, too, gave the faint, ghost of a smile. " Since we are on the subject of love tokens, look at mine, colonel!" Shehad unfastened alittle old-fashioned heart-shaped locket, hung by a slender gold chain round her neck. On one side was a curl of dark hair, on the other a few brown, faded leaves. "An old woman,-who should be done with romance, if a woman is ever done with that; and I don't pretend I always wear it. I only, put it on again to-day. The lock of hair I exchanged forty years ago; and the rose leaves were red and dewy and scented—foriy years ago J" " In the Hall garden ? Leonie!" He uttered the words brokenly, in a lew, shaken voice, and they stood there mute under the electric light; these two, who, foriy years ago, had loved each other dearly! What thdughta, what stirring memories, were in either heart—Heaven knew! So strange is love, and the power of love —ray, even in this weary end of this weary old century—that I think they were both transported by its power. They only saw the winsome maid and the handsome man each had loved ! They saw golden locks and upright figure, and eager, springing step 1 They saw the Hall garden, and the standard roses, and the bees droning over the mignonette. They heard each other's voices 3 They were young once more, and happy ! Then the vision faded. Some ladies had entered, who, in their turn, found an old, soldierly man, dressed carefully by a Bond-street tailor, and an old, white-haired lady, who had the wreckage of beauty in the pallor of her white face, still standing silently in the centre of the room. I will see you—to your carriage." "Thank you." ; In utter silence they walked downstairs, and into the hall. The porter handed the colonel his gold-headed cane, and the old man said " Good-night to you" absently as lie received it, " ■"Good-night to you, sir. The lady's carriage ? A brougham, madam ? Yes, it! is here." j They were out then on the pavement, J and he handed her in. j '-'Leouiel I never knew you1. And' yet your -voice wrung my heart!" I She had given him her hand, and was j looking at Mm pitifully and gently. "Shall I see you again, Leonie ? I shall-j do all I can. for your boy. If she loves Mm, he shall win Alice." "Thankyou, Hugh." " And when shall 1 see you ?" " I leave town to-morrow. I fear this is ! -good-bye!" He stooped suddenly in the dark, the ■ old bare-headed man, and kissed the frail ] old hand. Then he'stood back, the foot- | man, touching his hat, leaped up behind, and the brougham rolled away. Inside ] the old lady lifted the hand he had kissed j and held it softly to her face. : " It is the most marvellous thing in the world, Alice ! And I can give yon no ex plahation at all! Absolutely none 3 He wrote and asked me to lunch at his.club, and gave me the post of editor. And the salary is more than I thought. Ihad just time to. tell Aunt Leonie before she started for Cannes. And then came this invita tion to dine and go with you to the Lyceum. After dinner I asked if I might speak to you. With the work Aunt Leonie get for me on the ' London,' in her place, I could tell him of quite a comfortable little income ! And he just nodded in a queer, absent way, and said * Yes, oh yes.' Alice, darling! it is like the work of magic!" " Very nice magic !" the pretty Alice j whispered smilingly. "He has been so J odd and absent .lately, I have noticed it. i I have not once heard him say a cynical thing; and when his man tied his tie | bady this evening he scarcely said any- j thing. I hope he is not going to be ill." At which her lover laughed. ■ But the. colonel was not ill, and some j weeks after he was walking down Picca-; dilly with Alice, with the old soldierly j step, when she told Mm that Hugh had left town for the Hiviera. They were openly affianced then. He started and < looked at her quickly. "The Hiviera ! Why ?" \- V His .old-aunt Was found dead in her) bed.. She wrote, you know, such charm ing little idyllic sketches—worth their] weight in gold, Hugh said. He will in herit her money. She had a'good deal left j her late in her life." He was walking on quite steadily, but his eyes were very far away. . He saw no thing of the passers, of the eddying stream of veMcles, of the clubs, of Alice in her smart hat by his side. He was looking again into the wHte, old face, and] the eyes that bade Mm a mute farewell, and he whispered under his breath faintly j and slowly: " Leonie, Leonie!"
