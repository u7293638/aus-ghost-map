Midnight Mass for the Dying Year. liv II. \Y, Loncfku.ow. Yks, the year is growing old, And In's eye is pale and bleared ! Death with frosty hand and cold, Plucks the old man by the beard, Sorely,---sorely ! The leaves are falling, falling, Solemnly and slow ; Caw ! caw ! the rooks arc calling, It is a sound of woe, A sound of woe ! Through, woods and mountain passes The winds like anthems, roll; They are chanting solemn masses, Singing, “ Pray for this poor soul, " Pray,-- pray ! And the hooded clouds, like friars, Tell their heads in drops of rain, And patter their doleful prayers;— 1 iut their prayers are all in vain, All in vain ! There he stands in the foul weather, Tim foolish, fond Old Year, Crowned with wild flowers and with heather, Like weak, despised Lear, A king,—a king ! Then comes the summer-like day, Bids the old man rejoice ! His joy ! his last! Oh, the old man grey Loveth that cver-soft voice, Gentle and low. To the crimson woods he saith,- — To the voice gentle and low Of the soft air, like a daughter’s breath,' “ kray do not mock mo so ! Do not laugh at me ” And now the sweet day is dead ; Cold in his arms it lies ; No stain from its breath is spread Over the glassy skies, No mist or stain ! Then, too, the Old Year dieth, And the forests utter a moan, Like tlie voice of one who orieth In the wilderness alone, “ Ye>: not his ghost ! ” Then comes, with an awful roar, Gathering and sounding on, The storm-wind from Labrador, The wind Euroelydon, The storm-wind ! Howl ! howl ! and from the forest Sweep the red leaves away ! Would. the sins that thou abhorrest, 0 soid, could thus decay, And be swept away ! For there shall come a mightier blast, There shall be a darker day ; And the stars, from heaven down cast, Like red leaves be swept away ! Kyrie, eleyson ! Christe, eleyson !
