THE STORYTELLER. A FRIEND OF THE JINTONS. A COMPLETE STOKY. BY aoHJsr AKT>:K.XON. How c'omplefiel^m'maiii of acknowledged gentfeydisppsitflpn can dislike another/wlieu,v;h.fe'" gives his whole mind to;it-!:iand ; flffiW.iBiiicli better -two thoroughly devoted to- the task can do it tlian one ! The sum of dislike in such a case is not simply doubled; it is multiplied by a figurelying somewhere between nine and fifteen;for each individual poses as a magnet, witli its positive polo to the other's negative, and so in exerting its whole strength acquires greater power from the expenditure, I shall come to the two individuals who proved this statement by-and-by; intermediately, let ine say that my uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Baruon, are about the bestheai'tcd, levellest-tempercd folk in the world. They brought me up—made me what 1 am. 1 don't know that tlicy are particularly proud of the achievement. Some people who haven't kuowu me long say they ought to be. My uncle and aunt, well-nigli perfect as they are, have one failing, that unfortunately increases with advancing years. This weakness is the sweet willingness to be taken in. Odd to say, they have not been duped half so much as some of the veryalways wide awake ones who smile at their simplicity ; and the fact rather astonishes us. Tkev had been friendly with their neighbours, the Jintons, for several years. Now there is a coldness between the two families. I and my friend Jack Garner reared the stout column of coldness, where I'm afraid it will ever remain if it waits removal by us. Mr. and Mrs. Jinton brought with them to my uncle's house a gentleman, Mr. Smyne Jackson; he'd another name or two—more, maybe, but Smyne Jackson is long enough. They (the Jintons) had met him at Brighton, found him nice, and at the end oftheir- visit invited him to stay with them. He was tall—not too tall; he had regular features; but ears three times too large for his head ; and eyes that were seen at their "best in a jiliotograpb. The camera was either kind and omitted, or imperfect, and therefore incapable, of catching the shifty look that coustantly lurked in them. Either way, it was to Smyne Jackson's advantage. He didn't wait to be brought by his host and hostess the second time. He came alone, and right straight away to about the twenty-third time he did likewise At somewhere about his third visit, Jack Garner, my friend, looked stern • at the seventh he grew indignant - at the fifteenth,savage—Jack always does the right thing at the right time and at the twenty-first he was fairly wild. And why ? Well—I have 'a sister. Jack thought no girl Hk e Bessie. I thought, and still think a tremendous lot of her too. But. naturally, I am partial. Jack's a pitiable example of a man of one idea, o,ncl Bessie" is it. Brothers are not usually born blind to their sisters' imperfections, neither are their eyes rendered sightless by the blaze of their beauty. Maybe this is why I ] caow dozen; girls who are as nice as Bessie, and oue or two—one at least—who is decidedly nicer; but J ack won't have it. But there, he is thoroughly permeated with prejudice; whilst I—well, Ialways hold the balance fairly when my dear sister's merits are weighed against those of other girls who cannot boast the claim of relationship with me. Jack was getting on with Bessie beautifully before Jackson came, and there was a serene and touching unanimity about our smiles—uncle's, aunt's, and mine—on the matter; but our trio of smirks dissolved partner-' ship with quite a startling suddenness at the intruder's tenth visit, and mine was left alone with only the ghost of its original capital to carry on the grinning- business. " I wish to goodness, Will, I'd spoken to Bessie before he came," said Jack to me one night, as we sat and moodily smoked in the study. " Speak to lier now," I answered, " Can't get the chance: that fellow's always with her,' lie replied. " Per liaps. Will, yon wouldn't miud speaking to your nncle ? he added. "Mv dear old chap; I should be delighted to oblige-you-, but Lean t quite see :at-tins.moment how I ;can propose to myuucle, ferBessie, fovyou. I don't, think-, you. know, it's often done by a nephew: but I'll ask ;Sam Hicks; he's got about "thirteen - uncles, some o them -.younger thau himself, and he ll know " Den'-t,act the.idiot. Ask. him to give Jackson a hint,not to come here quite so often,' Jack- gloomily -said; "I haveluuted loud- andfrequently —all uselessly.

' ; ' ; •• •:.' ;;':' " Yes, iu_y lad, he's in the drawing^ room, thrilling the ladies witli descriptions of the ."Far West," said uncle; not a bit perturbed. . " I wish every man who talks guide-book would' talk the better kind. Cheap guide-book mangled is about as! irritating, as a bad skin disease," Jack broke in. ' . " I do believe," said my uncle, looking from one to the other, " that you boys are jealous of him—that's just like brothers. " But I am not Bessie's brother," said Jack, with downcast eyes. " Of course not; but we all consider you as one. Your father, Jack, and I were more like brothers than friends. Poor Charley! And it's very delightful to me to see you stand as second brother to 1 my little girl.' " " Mr. Baruon, T—I love Bessie like a man, not like a brother,'' J^ck The iuterval of silence that followed was occupied by Jack with a fit of noiseless fidgets,and ere it was broken the happy look my uncle wore was ousted, aud an anxious expression that didn't seem made to tit the pleasaut features clothed I hem. "I'm sorry, Jack," he began; " sorry, because 1. think there's trouble running your way, my lad." lie paused. " Your father lay dying ; it was late winter time, and the coming day was weakly beginning to struggle through the window and reveal the pallor— death's herald—on the poor drawn face. ' Yes, Charley,' I said, as our eyes met, miue wet with the stinging tears of grief, his dusky with the film of death," 'I will! I will!' He smiled, and his soul passed away through the lisrht of that smile to the brighter light his clouded eyes had seeu undimmed." " I know, sir, my father wished you to look after bis little orphan lad." sa.ying which, Jack spraug up and grasped my uncle's band. "Thank you, Jack; that grip's really beautiful," my uncle said, with a sigh of relief and a look of gladness. " Well, you know, Uncle, I think we can settle Bessie happily without any assistance from Sir. Smyne Jackson," I said. " Bessie shall settle her own future, Will. As for your aunt and me; well, we shall give our consent to any houest man who's lucky enough to win her gentle heart. That's our duty, and we shan't exceed it." " That's just it; Jackson isn't in that class," I said. '•Then be is certainmot; to"havei -our stuictloiii," incle i'eplied oalmly.: i "Yes, but he'll prove clever enough not to be stamped as tile impostor I believe him to be uutil too late," cried Jack hotly. " You'i-e going a little too far; please don't forget yourself, Jack," uiy uncle answered seriously. " No I niusn't do that, ha never does," replied Jack sarcastically. " Never," was uncle's calm reply. "No, sir.; self's the very last person in the world Mr. Smyne Jackson would be likely to forget," I broke in. My uncle sat calmly silent for i minute of two after hearing what I considered was an -unmistakable stin- " Good-night, lads, ;aud "Go;d bless you," he said as he slowly left the room. ... - I think .we bbth looked; ju-st then extremely foolish, though I can't speak to it ppsitiyelyr. because each •tried to avoid catching ' the other in the act.

What did such 'inconsistency betoken ? Afterwards, in the intervals of Bessie's singing, Jack kept his politeness running at fall speed: When would what would lie the nature and extent of the smash ? I more than .once asked myself. My uncle and aunt—dear simple souls—saw nothing but their favourite once more among them, happy and gay, as of old Jack led Jackson on after a time to talk of his native land, America; of its vast undeveloped resources, of its men of wit, meh of strength, and m'eu of money. The latter grew almost eloquent on America's millionaires, appearing to be as proud of them as an-Englishman is of the treasures in the British Museum and National Grallery; -'he seemed to think the sheen of'their piles of dollars shed a lustre" on, every son of American soil in the eyes of the rest of the civilised world Jack agreed,. and added -rather casually— "I hear that, one of-. them, Philadelphia—by -the way, he's a namesake of j'ours—is about to give a library to his. native city worth close upon a hundred thousand doL: lars.' '•' Yes," calmly replied'Smyne Jack son ; " my father consulted me about making the gift before ;I sailed.!'. "Your father?" answered-'Jack with a delighted expression. " Yes, certainly. -It's a large stun, but we shan't break up through-it," replied Jackson-proudly, My aunt beamed upon 'bird, ray uncle murmured: "Truly miinifi cent!" and Bessie looked with at least interested, eyes on the son- of a man so wealthy and so good " My father is. a.-r-rrr" "Yes, wp know,' bioke iji Jaok ailici. rudely " ]_ie a jnLi- Sale'ni Jackson, President of the jpurth National Ba,nk of Philadelphia."
