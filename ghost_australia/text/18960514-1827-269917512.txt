His back was, turned to :us, /but ill the stillness of the warmafternoon we could liear distinctly the words lie kept muttering over and over, and note the twitch of his.shoulders that filled the interval between the repetitions.

Every day, and a thousand times a day at least, lie has repeated it for more than seventy years now. Would you care to hear the story? It will interest you, I think ; and the seat here is comfortable." And this is the slory that the doctor, told me. II. Oiie'stiliing evening early in June,: 14J15, a young man, David. Burwell,' apprentice to a harness maker in Oheapside, was putting up the shutters in front of his master's shop wheti .hefell himself touched lightly on the 1 shoulder from behind. The'touch was; so light and seemed to contain such, hinted entreaty that David Burwell set dowu the shutter he was lifting, and turned in some astonishment. ; •'. "Clara!" ''' The girl laid a hand quickly on his arm. She was a wcll-favOured maid o£ nineteen or thereabouts, dressed in country fashion, and strongly made; as country girl's should he. But just now her face was drawn with weariness; hor clothes wre powdered, white with dust; and though no breath of air was abroad,' she held her shawl about her tightly, as if shivering. " Haven't you heard ?" She hesitated.. " Of course I..have heard nothing. I never get news -from Alehester, .nor wish to. . What is it—father, dead ? " " No • I left him at home." "Who is with you,.then?" "Nobody." The young man put .his -hands in his pockets, leaned . back against the shutters, and regarded her with some sternness. "I can't explain here, David; but it's terrible trouble, and J thought you would help, me, perhaps." :' Her voice grew weaker, and she had to put out a h;i :i ci tllti- shutters £or suppoi-ii-. • \ " O b - serving liiis. He finished his task quickly, and turned again to her. " Now I'm free; you can takeiny arm, iE you've no objection, and tell me : as; we walk .towards—by-the way, where are yon stopping ?" .-. ."•'.:;-•,..;.. " I don't know.' I've just tramped all the way from Alehester. . 1 thought you would find a lodging' for ine, perhaps." . " Walked!" David pulled up, and looked at lier again. But she was clearly breaking-down.;;- so he put restraint On .himself; and -witliout further question hurried her along eastward. " Better come 111 here," he explained, as they camo to (he door of a small eating-'H'ouAe/^":ry^^,t : no>y•'^Jfie'•.' 1 pl'ople.j and you look famished." ... The place'.'• was.
