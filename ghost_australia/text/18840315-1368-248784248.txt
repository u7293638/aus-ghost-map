Select Poetry; CHILDHOOD'S FAITH. WHEN life's loni And all around was Iiong ere I grew to be a man, Or read the books of learning through— What grand conceptions filled my head ! What wonders startled eye and ear! Ere cruel science argued dead . Xhn baby senses, love and fear. I feared the dark, I loved the light, And when the bright green earth I trod I dreaded the approach of night, Fat sunlight was the smile of God; Audi when the sun had passed away, Its ghosts thought tfiernobn to be; Much nearer than th&Gjwl; of day, More cold and spirit-like than be. {'thought {he Stan were signal lights By angels in their windows placed, That through the long and lonely nights Our paths to heaven might be traced; And when a star shot down the sky, I breathless watched the fading spark. And thought perhaps the angels die, And then their windows will be dark. When lightning flashed along the cloud, * ; !Hie Lord in anger glared at as; The thunder following long and loud, v To me was bnt bis warning voire." The sparkling rain that came amain ; L Was but the tears the Father shed. Because His children strayed again, . And lore to Him was cold and dead. Now I am old, and dayby day : The God so near my" infant eyes Has far and farther waned away, : And lam sceptical and wise. Bui am I happitr, knowing more ? Would I be happy, knowing all ? With naught to love nor to adore, If'tt power to rise, nor chance to fall f If this is all that knowledge gives, . Let me toward the cradle move— Back to a world where credence lives, And hearts feel reverence and love. Gire.me again God's sunlight smile; The twinkling stars that angels light; The thunder, though I quake the while; The sun's pale ghost that walks by night. Give m»the anger of His eye, And I will tremble and adore; Give me His tears, that fill the sky . With mercy for the weak and poor; Give me the wonder and the faith, Give me the sorrow and tile pain; 'Tis mockery all that science aaith— I'll be the busting child again.
