The Constitutional Bogey. From time immemorial it has bean the fashion with nureegirls, foster-mothers, and old dame instructresses to.awe.bairns into submission by threats of calling up bare-bone bogies. Tho foster parent of the fiuanoial polioy of the Gov ernment ia just now trying her hardest to terrify the "old boys " of thoCounoil with thoconatltu- tional bogey. Theolddamois violently exeroised, not to say exasperated, because the " stupid " old fellows aro so " blird" as not to soa the force oi the threat. Well, like tho shepherd's ory of wolf, this bogey or y has been mado so often that it has lost its effeot. Anyway, if rawtoueabe aa gbaetly aa he ia depicted, that is no reason why the old boyB should refrain, in terror of consequences, from going on with their dnty. As was remarked yeBterday, it the bogey forbids amendment of the bill it does not prohibit dobato. Snroly the members may expreBS their honest views without offensive aspersions boiug oast by the old dsmo on their motives. Ib there leas sincerity in the Counoil than at tho White Corner? is all tho pare patriotism of tho legislature ocnoentrated in the lower Chamber ? Bhould not some little oredit for integrity of motive be given to gentlemen who aro entrusted with an important public funotion? Ia the education or experience of tho detraotora of those gentlemen bo defootivo, or so vitiated, that it oannct mako allowances for sincerity and honesty in people whomay he open, by their privato ciroumstanoes, to the suspicion of putting selfi-h or oIbsb interests before patriotism? la it to be assumed that because a nursing moth r is blindly devoted to her foeter-ohild that every body else is etnpidly blind to tho blemishes of that swaddled infant ? Are the observers of those blemishes to be awed to silence by threats of a ghost?
