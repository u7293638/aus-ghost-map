CRICKET. All Ifatclies Postponed- There wore no cricket matches played in or about Sydney this afternoon, the weather boing too unfavorable. On Moore Park not'tho ghost of a cricketer wns to be seen, and when tilings reach this nass the state of the ground can woll be imagined. Evnn had the rain cleared upaftcrdiunoritisqnes- tionable whether any of the games arranged would have been proceeded with, as tbe turf- was thoroughly sodciened and sloppy after last night's heavy downpour. As is usual in very wet weather large pools of water' have accumulated on tho Association and- Agricultural grounds, and cricketing there would have been next to impossible.
