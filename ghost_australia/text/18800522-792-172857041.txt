INTERCOLONIAL. NEW SOUTH WALES. A GHOST STOBY . La these incredulous days few believe that even if " spiritual beings walk this earth, both when we sleep and when we wake," they do not make their presence known without the observance of some previous conditions, and that unless called for they rarely come. But (says Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald) for the last day or two a strange mysterious being has been observed at the windows of a house at present uninhabited by mortal tenants, wrapped in a windingsheet. White, ghastly, and ghostly, the apparition has presented itself in the broad daylight, to the terror of hosts of passing school children, and the wonderment or alarm of neighbouring old women. Some of the more courageous assailed,the house with sticks and stones, to the great detriment of the forthcoming sale of the property. At length the boldest of the bold entered the house, and there, wrapped in her grave-like encasements, discovered the daughter of a would-be purchaser of the " haunted" house.
