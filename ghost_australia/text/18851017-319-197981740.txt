THE V.A.T.C. SPRING MEETING. Tlio annual Spring Mooting of tho Victoria Amateur Turf Club was commenced at Caul- fiold on Saturday, but what would otherwise havo boon perhaps tho most successful gather ing ovor held on the heath was 'com pletely destroyed by tho adverse weather. On Friday thero was erery indication of settled frno weather, and tho management wero sanguine of a monster attendance for their "oponing day, but Saturday broko threatening, and tho rain commenced to fall as tho people wore going out by tho special trains. It increased as Caulflcld was neared, and it camo down in earnest by the timo tho bell rang for tho first race. From tliat out till after the decision of tho Guineas it was heavy pud continuous, and tlioso who wero presont had to seolc tho shelter of tho stand aud booths, which wero thronged for sovcral hours. As a natural cousequenco, this untoward Btato of things had nn injurious offcct on tho attendance, and no doubt many who would otherwise havo journeyed out iu timo to SCO tho Guineas tvero detorrcd from doing 60. Yot, despito this draw back tho roturns show that mora people went out by train than on any previous. Guineas day, tho uumbcr beinc 3814. and na the flat and new stand wero well patronised it ' may safely be assumed that the attendance was ; tho largest on record. Siuco the last meeting - 40 feet has been added to tho stand, and though Ibis is asubstanlial increase in thenccommoda- ' tion it was evident on Saturday that a further addition or a now stand altogether will vory " soon bo required. Among other improve ments is a now scratching arrangement, designed by the secretary, which worked vory ' satisfactorily, though it would have been an advantago to havo made the figures a littlo larger. Somo inconvenience wai caused to horso owners by tho fact that tha farriers in a body struck and refused to remove shoes becauso they had been refused the privi lege of froo entree. It should bo mentioned that tho arr&ngemonts; for tho comfort of tht visitors wcro as complete as could be, con sidoring tlio weather, and Wamecke's band, in the few intervals of sunshine, played a series o'. selections on the lawn. The rain commeuccd in earnest as the bell rang for the Maiden Plato, but this only de terred four out of the twenty-two colored on the card from putting in an appearance, and tho talent were not long in making Jocular, n South Australian representative, a great favorite, # though tbo ring had to trans-' act their operations undor tho booths, instead of in the usual place near tho clock towor. 'Lucky Hit and St. Odille wero next in demand to Jocular, and Cyclops aud Highland Chief had friends at longer odds. Recall was almost friendless, as only a few investments from Bnllarat people wcro made in Ips favor. The colors of Highland Chief were prominent during tho first portion of tho journey, but at the homo turn nothing looked so woll as tbo favorito, who appeared to bo pulling over all the others. Ho, however, seemed to cut it when Ire was challenged by Recall, and the latter going on, won very easily by thrco lengths. . Tho victory was a vory meritorious one, and tho time good, considering the stato of the ground. After an excellent lnncb, on which tho catcror, Mr. Skinner, is to be complimented, a dozen weighed out in a blinding rain storm for the Hurdlo Raco. Of these Duration was host favorite at 4 to 1, though his stable companion, Mistake, was well supported at a point more, Master Pinetop being at the same price. Of tho others, Gasalior, Flamborongh aud Vernot bod friends, and somo legitimate investments were made in their favor, Vernet, . Flamborough and V&nderbilt; mndo most of the running to tho home turn, where thero was only one in it, as tho favorite drew away from everything nnd won easily by a couple of lengths. Mistake camo down nt tho last hurdlo. but, fortunately, Batty was not hurt. A slight break in the weather took place after tbo Hurdlo Race, and a - movo was mado to tho paddock to inspeot the candidates for the Foal Stakes, and the first seen was Clolia, a small but handsomo filly. ' Aomo, a brown filly of exquisite quality, attracted a largo concourse as she wns being saddled, and the mare was turned out in - excellent style. Munwyrtina and Manxman II. are a couple of good looking colts who will bo well served by a little longer time, but Damoclos is slightly plain though powerful/ Of the others Edith and Anita attracted tho mostattention.and the former looked really well. Thorn were just fourteen starters, of whom eight wero fillies, and the lot were a credit to any racecourse. In the ring nothing went so well as Acme, and those who wished to support her had to be content to take 5 to 4. . The Hun and Maddelina were at 4 to 1 each ; 6 could have been had about Edith, tbo ouly others backed being Anita and Dividend, wbo were quoted at 8's. Thore was a most unex- ' pccted dolay at the start owing to the anxiety of tho jockeys to got away, and tboro were no ; less than ten or fifteen attempted starts. Every rider in the raco was fined, some of them " twice, and Williamson, who was on Edith, was suspended for tho rest of the meeting for disobedience at tlio post. At length Mr. T. Watson, who acted in place of his father, seized- a favorably opportunity and sent them away well together, except that Manxman II. refused - to commence and was left at tho post. Tho colors of Clelia wero first conspicuous, but when they had gono half the distance tiie favorite, hotly pressed by Tho Nun and Munwyrtina, was in front; From that out Acme held lior own and won by half a length. heat. Maddelina was fourth, but Edith or Anita . were never dangerous. Tbo winner, who was bred by her present-owner, is by Chester, from Princess Maud, and Saturday was her second appearance on a racecourse, she having pre viously won tho Richmond Stakes, nt tho Into A.J.O. meeting. The success of Acme natu rally strengthened Monto Christo's position for tho Guineas, and when it was noti fied there wcro eight runners odds of '5 to 2 woro all that could bo obtained. Ringmaster was a vory firm second favorite, and his party woro very sweet on his chauce. Tlio liorse looked really well, and was the fittest animal in the race, while Monte Christo was voted light by many of the t&lent; Dunlop bore tho ««nAAM.i/ia nf Imtnr. eliftft- /if irni'L fltlfl f hn sequel proved tho correctness of this nssump- tion ; none of the others came in for much at tention, as it was very generally held that the race was a match between throe. Melodious and -Dunlop wcro alternately -in front to tit. sod wnll, where Monto Christo showed up, only to retire when in the straight, and there Dunlop and Ringmaster were left to fight it out, with the result that the latter quitted his oppo nent in the last 100 yards, and won' easily by two lengths and a half, Eagle Grange, who was very sore, caipo with a desperate run at tho finish and ran into third plnco, and Parw'an, a fino raking eolt, who will yet be hoard of, was f n very good fourth. Ringmaster was very well steered by young Chris Mooro, and his owner _ and friends threw in for a very fair stake. The colt is in tho Derby, nnd is bound to run promt- „„n»lv fr»- flint nwint. Tho Hunters' Cud had " fourteen runners, anil Knrrung and Tanglefoot: wcro most in demand. Tho raco was a capital : one, as all tho horses jumpod woll, and after Gippslnndcr, who led nearly all the way, had been allowed to run himself to a standstill, the favorito won easily. Tho concluding event, the 'l'oorak Handicap, fell to Montinore, who won rather easily from Too Too. A protest was entered against the winner for jostling the second, hut after an inquiry it was dismissed.'

Gipps landcr soon had a decided lead, Chesterfield taking up second position, with Robert the Devil third. Abdallnh nud Spring whipping the field in. . So far as the lending positions were concerned, no change took place for soma time. The fvneo on the hill at the turn nway from the straight brought Curiosity down rather heavily, but the rest of tho field got over without mishap, Gipps landcr showing tho way, and increasing his lead from Chesterfield and Robert tho Devil, whowcro separated from onc'anothcr by about ten lengths as they went 'along the back of tho course, Conrad being in fourth .position.

All the horses were fencing splendkily, though Chesterfield nearly came down over one of the fences In the straight.
