" SELECT POETRY. " THOUGH YEARS HAVE PAST BY BABOO KASII'ttASAD GHOST, OF CALCUTTA. BENEATH the beams of morning bright, Creation smiles around, And every being feels delight With wreaths of bright hopes crowned : But they no joy to me impart They have no charm for me ; Though years have past, my lonely heart Still fondly turns to thee. Cool breezes fan my burning brow, And strive to charm the sense "With grateful odours, which they now From blooming flowers dispense. But what can cool the fires, which dart From sorrow's flames in me ? Though years have past my lonely heart Still fondly turns to thee When lone I view the-silver beams Of Chandra fair and bright, And gaze upon the stars, whose gleams Once brought me such delight flow from my eyes the tear-drops start, And flow incessantly ! Though years have past, my lonely heart Still fondly turns to thee. Although I mingle with mankind, And glad and gay appear-, Tfet can my heart no solace find When, sweet one, thou'rt not near. The shape of joy doth soon depart. And sorrow chastens me ; Though years have past, my lonely heart Still fondly turns to thee. To think of thee 'is sadly sweet 'Tis pain so mixed with joy ; I would not for one moment fleet ' Give up the strange alloy. Even as thou were, so now thou art, Though dead, beloved by me ; Though years have past my lonely heart Still fondly turns to thee. I From the Calcutta Literary Gazette.
