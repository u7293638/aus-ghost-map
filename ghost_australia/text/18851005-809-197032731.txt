the, melbourne hue t cl ub meeting. The annnnl race meeting held under the aus pices of tho Melbourne Hunt Club, took place at Flemington on Saturday, and was an un doubted success in every way, the, weather beiojr simnlv perfect, and tbe racing of tho most interesting character. Tho attendance, which included his Excellency the Governor and suite, was larger than at last year s meet ing, and the whole of tKe. proceedings were of the most enjoyable character. The protracted wintory weather which has prevailed for the past few months, and rendered iu many in stances outdoor sports tho reverse of pleasant, gave place on .Saturday to one of our best spring days. Flemington never looked better, thegrass In the reserves and course being of the most luxuriant description, aud if the same condition of things prevails during the approaching Spring Meeting then will the suc cess of the great racing carnival of the year be assured. Mr. G. Watson was unfortunately too ill to occupy his usual position as starter, but his son, Mr. T. Watson, performed the duties admirably, nnd dispatched the whole of tho fields, with the exception of the Hunt Club Cup, in which he lmd a mount on tho most even terms, Mr. R. & H. 11. Wakeley, tho new judge, made his first appearance iu the box, and mado a successful a shut, though no difficulty was ex perienced in placing the horses for each event. The racing commenced with tbe Selling Race, for which there wore ouly a couple of starters, but backers sustained' a severe reverse, as odds of 3 to 1 were freely laid on the Ace, with tho result that he wns never dangerous, and the non-favorite. Sorcerer, won very easily by a leugtb. On being submitted to auction'he was bought in for .490, and ns he was entered to be sold for m7 the club netted tbe whole n mount. The Hurdle Race had a -field of e ight, and of these Duration was tho best favorite, though Tanta liser had a strong following, who backed him down to 5 to 1 to win a good stake. Vernet. Amateur nnd Xonophon mnde most of the running, but at the home turn Duration and Tantaliser drew out and had the finish to them selves. The latter cautioned against Voruet at the last hurdle and lost some ground, and though ho came again he could never get up. nud Duration won rather cleverly by a couple of lengths. The amateurs next had a turn in tho Hunt Club Cup, and nine weighed out. com prising somo of tho best of our amateur cross country nuors, ana tne norscs mciuueu some whose performances across country have been of exceptional merit, Abdallah despite his steadier of 13 rst., was mado favorite, nnd Kuikyne wns next iu public estimation. Itubv, on tiio strength of her jumping capabilities, being the only other one fancied. Trouble soon commenced, "as Ruby canto down at the first fence, and Emily, Conrad and Abdullah at tho next, the latter being knocked down by Emily as sbe was rising off the ground. These mis haps loft Gold Top in front, aud ho came past the stand with Kuikyne, Jack tfheppard, Curio sity and Chesterfield, these being the only ones in it, though Abdallah. Conrad and Ruby rider lesM came np the straight at a great pace on their own account. Gold Top. closely followed by Curiosity and Jack Sheppard, with Kuikyne a bit away, and Chesterfield outpaced, ran along the back, and then Curiosity came down at tbe abattoirs, leaving Gold Top with a good lead to tho last fence. Here Kuikyne drew up.- and, assuming the command, ho cantered in an easy winner by three lengths, Mr. W. S. Cox, jun., having ridden his monnt with much judgment aud patience. The Handicap Flat Race had just a Acoro of starters, and the talent at once selected Ringmaster and Bohcmiau ns being best in, and they left the paddock at 7 to 2 and 5 to 1 r« spectively. Kuncio, Merriinu, tho favorites and Chuckster wcro most prominent during tho journey, and once they were fairly inside the straight, Ringmaster shot out ancl j woir cleverly by a length, Bohemian nud Chuckstor running a dead heut for second j pkve. Tbo Handicap Steeplechase had I eight runners, and Bob Cooper, who was cer tainly the finest looking horse of the lot, | came in for the greatest amouut of support. Owing to refusals and falls only the favorite, Goodwood and Chester were in it half a mile from home, and though the two latter made desperate efforts to get on terms from tho last fence, the favorite came homo an easy winner by four lengths. A good field of 18 youngsters contested the last evnnr, the Sapling Stakes, and a strong commission in .favor of tho Kuu sent her to the head of the quotations, and 2 to 1 was difficulty of obtuinnient at the finish. Tho good thing came off, as the filly won easily, and the stable landed a good stake, while tho doublo oventers were also sent home lamenting. The followiug are the details : — Sni.uxr.
