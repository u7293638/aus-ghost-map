SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1896. The "Made in Germany" contro- versy has an interest of its own. Strangely enough the subject is far more heard of in Victoria than in Great Britain, where, after a short discussion, its value has been fairly assessed. But here the arguments have been pressed into partisan service. We are told that Great Britain sees her doom before her. She is being crushed out of existence, it is alleged, because she allows German goods to enter her markets. And the argument proceeds, that to save Vic- toria from ruin we ought to sternly and absolutely keep British goods and German goods out of the markets of Victoria, and if we do not rigorously exclude these and other commodities, why, the terrible calamity which has befallen Great Britain will equally afflict our poor selves. Now, has any calamity rcollv happened to Great Britain I Is the prosperity of the I mother countrv in anv way impaired tin ouiih her admission of Get man goods I Gin Mu vui vy s famous [now J Zealand cr prepare to pack up for ] London with the ltitontion of sketching tho ruins of St Paul s nom a broken arch of London bridge ? Ought yyo to recall tho fluent whom oui frozen meit companies aro sending to Lngland, loalising that it is foolish to push trade with a decadent and dying community ?

Mr. Justice Holroyd yesterday finished his summing up, but in view of the intricate nature of the case, declined to im- pound the jury, and the Court conse- quently was adjourned till Monday, when Mr Florance Thompson, and his eleven coadjutors, will commence their task of con- sidering the evidence. At the close of the summing up, Mr Deakin suggested that possibly the jury might prefer to imme- diately consider the case, and this led lo some slight flutter in the jury box, as the result of which the foreman intimated that it would probably be better to resume on Monday, although,he added, it would be at greatt inconvenience to all of them. The verdictt will probably be given on Monday evening in time for a good night's rest before the Cup, and the value of a special juror's fees per diem will then be estimated in hard cash by the sheriff. The dull and regular stream of the City of Melbourne Bank trial was yesterday in- terrupted by a slight ripple. Mr Justice Holroyd had for some hours been summing up the evidence to the jury when be sud- denly stopped, and, fixing Mr. Phillips, the attorney for the auditors, with a shrewd eye-glance, remarked, "I wish, Mr. Phillips, that you would not make those extraordi- nary faces at the Court. You are sitting right before me, and it embarrasses me in my summing up." Mr Phillips with great presence of mind immediately assumed a complexion which may best be described as a happy medium between the blush of con- scious rectitude and that of a newly boiled lobster, and suggested that, having been deeply moved by his Honour's address, he had been unable, as a mere novice, to control his facial contortions. He further inquired whether he had not better go away and find a better looking man to occupy his seat. Mr. Justice Holroyd, by a polite bow, intimated that this would be an impossi- bility, then, draining a large glass of soda and milk, he adjourned the Court for luncheon.
