Amusements. Theatbe Botal. — Another' large audience atten ded last evening at the Soyal, where ' The Colonel '? was again successfully performed. It will be xe-H peated this evening. ?'?'?-? ? j' - ? The Ofeea. HotrsE. — The final performance of ** Crutch and Too&pick;' was given at this theatre, last evening. It almost seems a pity it has to be with arawsintne neigntotitsprosperty, dud tne managerial dictum has gone forth, and it will to-night give phice to a comedy never before played in Sydney, entitled 'The Professor.' This -has had a^ong run in. America— indeed, ia now running in 2f ^ew 'Sork — and judging from the press notices in that. country it should be a success here, as it appcaTeto be a play of very great emotional interest. Sir. 'l?red. Marshall, too, has a strong part in it— being the ' Professor' — ?and, doubtless, there ivill *e':a large and critical audience assembled this evening to witness its first production; in Sydney. ?'.-..? The Victosia HAit.— The pretty little enter tainments given by the Hart' s are now drawing, to a close, and. to-night will see the final performance of those clever people in Sydney. To_ those who have not witnessed these pleasing entertainments we can, strongly recommend the programme' of this evening, whicH is one of -the 'best that has yei been given. On Monday -Mri aud Mrs. -Hart start on e. country tour. . - .-. -????? ? ... . ' -,.The Qtjeen'b Thsatee.— The performance. at bub popular place of swnasevnent last evening, was for. the benefit of Mr. Burdett ? Howo; a gentleman r*rho has played a very arduous season .at the Queen's, ?whei.o ha has hardly niet with that amount ?fcf. patronage from playgoers which his efforts deeerred. The occasion too, last evening, was his fare well appetu-ancG, and as a lover of Shakespeare, he chose the sublimo tragady of 'Macbeth' to mark it. The house, was not so .well attended aa an Actor, of Mr. Howe's sterling ability had a right to expect ; and seeing that fie had previously made such a good impression aa Hamlet and Si chard Third, this is somewhat to be wondered at. Mr. Howe's Macbeth waa rendered with great vigroux at times, and ?fihe soliloquies wcredelivered with good effect, though, -here and there the. actor was too boisterous and in places; incorrect as to the text.. He does not make Macbeth a bold soldier in. auy way-r-for noisa doaa not indicate courage — but from the first shows IWtti to.be a thorough craven, with no mind of h& own- ' Though steeped in blood, arid the wearer of a '-crown, he ? never ' impresses i Ms :audience wiiih the idea that Macbeth was J ever a. general fit to lead armies to the. battlefield.'] iTrom the very start he is a coward ; in the banquet] scene, -when confronted wii3i Banqiio's ghost, he has all the appearance of one strong 'in the horrors,' and though he t«liB us, when the vision of the jnhid departs, that ' he is a man again *'-r-weil, ha doss at' least, in the ' earlier stages of the play — albeit a cold-blooded one, there can be no question. Bnt Mr. Howe does . not take this, view of the char actor. In tha earlier scenes, therefore, he was (dis appointing ; but in the last a,ct, when driven to des paration, he rose to tiie occasion, and played with a fire and vigour which drew forth unlimited applause., ?which only culminated with tha fight between himancL jUacdufc. This was a most skilful piece of fencing, and showed how good a master of the sword -Mr. Howe is. Mr. J. B. Steel wieis the MacdufE of the play, and, but that his impersonation wanted force and pathos, he was a success. His performance was a very even one throughout. Miss Marion Y/illis sustained the part of La&y; Macbeth, and again showed what an exceedingly clerer and versatile actress she is. The support accorded was on the whole very fair fora company which does not profess to be c. Shakesporiaii one, and considering, too, that they aie not an opera troupe, lioeko's beautiful music was snngvery creditably, To-iiigfct the bill of fare will consist pf 'a piece played on this occasion for the first time in Australia, and as it ie a sensation drama of the most pronounced type, it. should draw a big house. The name of this new and- exciting drama is 'Heck and Keek.' . : The Ofeea.— -* The Gi-and Duchess of Gerolsfcein ' ?was parf ormed at the Gaiety, .last; night, by the Siinonsen Ojiera Comxjany, before a large, though n|)t crowded, honse. The threatening state of the weather, no doubt, kept many persons away who -otherwise wouidhave been present. 'The Grand Duchess '? has been played so; often in. Sydney that every inci dent and -scene in the opera_, and almost every note of the music of , it, ' are-vknown ; to the patrons of the lyric stago.
