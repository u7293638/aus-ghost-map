SOUTH AUSTRALIA. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT,) Adelaide, 8th September, 1855. The election excitement is still paramount, and meetings, more or less noisy, are held in every quarter The town elections, begin on the 19th of this month, and we will keep them oil over before October, though the intelligence may) not reach Adelaide from the remote districts by that time All fresh claims for votes hav e been bent in and no new Votes can be made now The number of new A oats for West Adelaide is enormous; Mr Fisher's committee have sent in about 400 and Mr Forster's 480 They cannot all be genuine, and there will be some fun on objection day A vote on a freehold property requires six months' possession, but with regard to leasehold property the claim is founded on the unexpired term so that most of the made up sorts are upon leases The contest for West Adelaide will be the hottest and it is the only one in which principle is my oh ed, but, on personal grounds, there will be a hard pull in North Adelaide, between Messrs Neales and was in West 'Jouons between Mr. Reynolds and Major O Bailor m, and in East Torrens, between Messrs Hughes and Gwynne Mr Bonney has, retired from the contest for East Torrens, as he saw he had not the ghost of a chance. TI ough he is a better and more popular mind that either of the other candidates, there was no chance, in the present state of public feel it g fore Government officer Mr J B Hughes is a new man , Gwynne has been a nominee, and has almost uniformly) noted with (Gemment An absurd outcry has been raised against Mr Forster by the bush, on account of an article which appealed in the Register some weeks ago, and width I mentioned at the time, recommending that the unemployed I wish female immigrants should get some work to do in digging the Botanical Gardens so as to prevent them from being only useless mouths, to be fed of the public expense Mr, forster bOyS he did not write the articles question, but that he does not think it over tionable and no more do I Respectable English Scotch, and Irish women think it no dibgiacotodo held work, and even William Cobl etc recommends that the wife should be at her husband's side assisting him in his out of-door labors I am but nobody) has proposed anything better for the girls to do, and it is really pitiable to see them idly sauntering about the depot, on crammed into close nullialth) looms, for better let therefore handwork and finish it But in electioneering there is nothing considered unfair Mr J Fisher is stigmatised as a bigoted old For j, and Mr Forster is a tyrannised over helpless females, while the truth is the true good men both, and would either of them do credit to West Adelaide, only the Register and Observer is powerful enough ahead), and if Mr For later got in for West Adelaide, and Mr Ihj (another proprietor) for North Adelaide, I do not think the newspaper would be impious. Mr Edward Stating has consented to come forward as a candidate for Hindmarsh, in opposition to Doctor Rankine Mr Peter Cumming, of Adelaide, has started for Stanley and thcnoithoin mus against the former member, Mr Younghusband Captain Rodda for merely a mine captain, but now a miller in the north, is going to oppose Mr G P Angas, for Bal ossa For NomlunDa Jh Peacock, the old member, is still, I think, the popular candidate though the constituents have lit old addresses from Mr M Dermott for mercy of the Bank of Australasia and Mr T.
