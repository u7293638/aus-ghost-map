When they came the urn they were puzzled for a moment. ,i 'Wot kind o' swag's this, cul?' said one of .,'-! thorn, holding tho urn up to the light. 'Looks like a vase or a milk pitoher or somethin',' said the other. ' Milk pitoher yor gran'mother,' soornfully.

As he did so the / inscription caught his eye. . J.- ' Hullo !' he exclaimed. ' Why, Bill, it's ',', a graveyard— of it ain't d- ? n me.' '.''.-' ?? 'A wot?' cried the second burglar, lean- ing forward, hia ey es sparkling- wiih surprise ' and incredulity. ? 'A graveyard!'. repeated the other burglar; .' 'a stiff- kit— a little private cemetery.

The burglar who held the lard can into which my ashes were being ' dumped' trembled perceptibly, and threw a hasty, apprehensive glance around as if fearing the approach of my angry spirit. His companion noticed his agitation, and with a scornful smile remarked : .. : ' Well, ef you ain't the wust, Bill — yer1 a.' - flunk.' Then, with a few light taps on the bottom of the urn to detach any adhesive grains that might bo clinging to the recep- ? tacle, he laid it aside with, '.' Thero, ol' lady ; ?
