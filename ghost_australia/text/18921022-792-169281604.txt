GREAT; BBITAIN. A MEDltTM EXPOSED. Mediums,and Mahatmas are just now (according to the Daily Telegraph) considerably excited over a mishap which has befallen one of their order, that threatens to bring discredit upon their calling as well as diminish their profits. At a recent spiritualistic seance a medium produced the ghosts of several notabilities of the past, among them Voltaire, who discoursed on modern art and literature in fluent, if not altogether grammatical, English, marked here and there with the displacement of an " h," a habit he must have picked up since his decease. As he seemed familiar with the works of artists who lived long after he ceased to reside above ground it was evident that the ghost possessed an acquaintance with the contents of the art reviews. One of the audience said he had rather an important question to ask, but he did not care to put it unless he was sure of an answer. Voltaire replied that he would state with pleasure anything he knew. The questioner then asked, in Frenchâ€”" Will you please tell me how many two and two make p" No answer was given; Voltaire, it appeared, did not understand French. The seance broke up in confusion. The medium ought to have known his business better, because exactly the same trick was once played upon a Parisian spiritualist, who, while personating Mahomet, was forced to confess that ne did not understand Arabic. Mediums and Mahatmas ought to .be aware that in these days knowledge is advancing, and should be correspondingly cautious if they wish to retain their clients.
