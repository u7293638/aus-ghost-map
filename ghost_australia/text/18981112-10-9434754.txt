He was a wicked d mining in malefactors thief If not a murderer We know this for such only were in called He was suf firing a just punishment for breaking the laws And as be li id Ihed wicked so lie in Line. determined to die wished for when he (list was crucified he called on our Lord And he was a dying man He hung there mile 1 to a cross from which he was never to come (lou n alive He had no longer power to stir hand or foot His hours were numbered the grave was ready for him There was but a step between him and death If over there was a soul hovering on the brink of hell it was the soul of calls thief If ever there was a case that seemed lost gone and past recovery it was his If ever there was a child of Adam whom the devil made sure of is his own it was this man But see now what happened He ceased to lull and blaspheme as he had done at the first He began to speak in another manner altogether He turned to our blessed Lord in prayer He prayed Jesus to remember him when He came into His kingdom He asked that his soul might he cared for, his sins pardoned and himself thought of in another world frilly this was a wonderful change And then mark what kind of answer he received Some would have said he was ton w Ickcd a man to be saved But it was not so Some would li he fancied it was too late the door was shut and there was no room for money But it proved not too late at all The Lord Jesus returned him an immediate answer spoke kindly to him assured him he should be with Him that day in Paradise p pardoned him come pletely cleansed him thoroughly) from his sins reece ed him gnciouslv-justified him freely raised him from the gates of hell gave him a title to glory Of all the multitude of saved souls none ever received so glorious an assurance of his own salvation as did this penitent thief Go over the whole list from Genesis to Revelation and you will find none who had such words spoken to them as these To day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise Reader the Lord Jesus never gave c so complete a proof of His power and will to save as he did upon this occasion in the day that He seemed most weak He showed that He was a strong delivered In the hour when His body was racked with pain He showed that He could feel tenderly for others At the time when He Himself was dying, He conferred on a sinner etc uni life Now, have I not right to say is Christ is able to save to the uttermost all them that come unto God by Him / Behold the proof of it If ever affair was too far none to be saved it was this thief Y it he was plucked as a brand from the fire II The second lesson on as much to learn from this passage is this If some are said to the in j li mi of death others are not This is a truth that me it ought to be passed over and I dare not leave it in noticed It is a truth that stands out plainly in the sad ind Of the other male factor and is only too often forgotten. Whatbeianioof the other thief who was crucified? Why did he not turn from his sin and not upon the form di Why did he remain hardened and impenitent Why was he not said? It is useless to try to answer such questions Let us be content to take the fact, as we And it and see what it is meant to teach us We have no right whatever to say this thing was a worse man than his companion There is nothing to prove it Both plainly were wicked men Both were receiving the due reward of their deeds Both sung by the side of our Lord Jesus Christ Bothhiaid Him pray for his murderers Both saw Him suffer patiently But while one repeated the other remained hardened While one began to pray, the other went on calling While one was converted in his last hours the other died a bad man as he had lived While one was taken to paradise the other went to his own plan-the place of the dual and his angels Now this fillings are written for our warning. There is warning as well as comfort in these cases and that very solemn warning too they tell me loud 1 ; that though some may repent and be convened on their death beds It does not at all follow that all will A death bed is not always a saving time riley till Friendly that two men may have the same opportunities of getting good for their souls may be placed in the same position see the same things and hear the same things and ct only one shall take advantage of them repent believe and be saved They tell me, above all that re- penitence and faith are the gifts of God, and are not in a mans own power and that if any one flatters himself he can repent at his own time choose his own season seek the Lord when he pleases and, Uki the penitent thief be saved at the very last he may find at length he is greatly deceived And it is good and pro liable to bear this in mind there is an [ immense amount of delusion in the world 1 on this very subject I see in my allowing lifetoshpawnv ullunpicpurrd to die Isec many allow ing that they ought to repent but always putting off" their own repent ance And I believe one good reason is, that most men suppose they can turn to God just when they life They wrest the parable of the labourer in the vineyard, which speaks of the eleventh hour, and use it as it never was meant to be used They dwell on the pleasant part of the verses I am now considering and forget the rest The) talk of the thief that was cut to paradise and was saved and forgot the one who died as he had lived and was lost I say these things in all affection to give you warning of danger I do not say them to drive you back from heaven -I say them rather to draw you on and bring you to Christ while He can be found I want you to beware of presumption Do not abuse God's mercy and compassion Do not continue in sin I beseech you and think you can repent and believe e and be saved just when you like when you please when you will and when you choose I would at w as s set before you an open door I would always sin While there is life time Is hope But If you would be wise put nothing of that can version soul Iwuntvou tobewaieof letting slip good thoughts and good) can victions If you have them Cherish them and nourish them, lest you lose them for over Make the most of them lest they take to themselves wings and flee away Have you an inclination to begin playing Put it in practice at once Have you an idea of beginning really to the Christ? Set about it at once Are you enjoying unv spiritual light? See that you live up to your light Tillie not with opportunities lest the day come when you will want to use them and not be able Linger not lest you become wise too late You may say perhaps ' It is never too late to open Iansvvir that is light enough but late repentance is seldom true And I say further you cannot ascertain if you put of repeating you will repent at all You may say " Why should I be afraid the penitent thief was saved I answer that is true but look again at the passage which tells you that the other thief was lost See how strong was the faith of this man 1 He called Jesus Lord He declared his belief that He would have a kingdom He believed that He was able to give him eternal life and glory, and in this belief prayed to Him He maintained His inner fence of all the charges brought against him "This man, said he hath done nothing amiss Others perhaps may have thought the Lord Innocent -none said so openly but this poor dying man And when did all this happen? it had gone when the whole nation had denied Christ, shouting, "crucify Him crucify Him We have no king but Cicsarl - when the chief priests and Pharisees had condemned and found Himguiltyof death -wbenevenHIs own disciples had forsaken Him and fled, when He was hanging faint, bleeding, and dying on the cross numbered with transgressors and at counted accursed This was the hour when the thief believed in Christ and prayed to Him Surely such faith was never seen since the world began You see in the penitent thief a finished work of the Holy Ghost Every part of the be lievers character may be traced in him Short as his life was after conversion he found time to leave abundant evidence that he was a child of God His faith, his prayer, his humility, his brotherly love are unmistakable witnesses of the reality of his repentance He was not a penitent in name only but in deed and in truth Let no man therefore think because the penitent thief was saved that men can be saved without leaving an) cv ideas of the Spirit s work Let each one consider w ell what people sometimes say about what they call deathbed evidences It is perfectly fearful to observe how little satisfies some persons and how easily they can persuade themselves that their friends an gone to heaven They will tell you when their relation is dead and tone that he made such a beautiful prices one- day For that he talked so well, that he was so sorry for his old ways and intended to live so differently if he got better For that he craved nothing in this world of that he liked people to read to him, and pray with him And because they have this to go upon, they seem to have a comfortable hope that he is saved.
