VANISHED EMINENCES. (FROM THE DAILY NEWS ) "Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stones of the death of kings," says one of Shakspeare's characters. The invitation is appropriate to the day, though not so appropriate as in the time of Richard III. Though monarchs have suffered violent deaths since then, it has not been the rule that they should be deposed or "slain in war," or haunted by the ghosts they have deposed, or poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed, all murdered ' As for royal suicide, it has in recent times become comparatively rare A savage monarch whom we worsted at Magdala blew out his brains in the agony of his misfortune. In this respect King Theodore unconsciously displayed the spirit of Frederick the Great, who carried about with him in the Seven Years' War a pill which would, if necessary, justify his boast that he would never be taken alive His luck, however, was better than that of the ill-fated King of Abyssinia Nearly two years ago the King of Bavaria voluntarily sought oblivion in the Lake of Seam berg Of his insanity there was even less doubt than there has been of that of other princes who have trifled with lives that were not their own. Prince Rudolph's death by his own band is as mysterious as it 19 necessarily sudden It has been observed by Buckle and others that military men commit suicide oftener than other classes Certainly there has been no little suicide among Continental officers lately. 'bat in the cold law of averages a royal victim should be counted in would probably not have surprised the author of the History of Ctviltsatton, The sensation of shock that has unquestionably been caused by the Archduke's death is, of course, due in great degree to the eminent position he filled His was necessarily a conspicuous figure, since, apart from any individuality of its own, it was that of the apparent heir to the Austrian throne When such men so suddenly disappear it is as if the familiar features of some landscape had been obliterated by volcanic agency They are vanished eminences Our awe at their precipitous disappearance is partly due to that, and partly to our helpless speculations as to what may be the consequences, or as to what other alterations in the earth's surface will surprise us next. We have had many such surprises lately. Although the Emperor I Frederick's death from cancer so soon after his father died was in the end quite anticipated, the first revelation of the prospect of that death was distinctly one of those surprises More akin to the event of this week was the Prince Imperial's death, not in the nature of its violence, of course, but in the facts that he did die by violence, and that the news came upon everybody with appalling suddenness, and that in him were centred the hopes of a dynasty That event again recalls the death, by a fall from his carriage, of Louis Philippe son, the Duke of Orleans, in 1912. Though, unlike those two princes, the Duke of Albany was neither her nor pretender, his death also produced by its suddenness the same peculiar sensation or shock, intensified in this country by the nearness of his relationship to our Queen, and by the respect and confidence be had inspired in the people by his well spent his Hardly less sudden than in all these cases was the blank caused by the death of the Prince Consort. It may there fore be mentioned among the pain fal surprises which in our times death has sprung upon us. The Princess Alice's death ranks with all of these in tragic interest and above most of them in pathos. Napoleon the Third's disappearance from the map of Europe practically occurred at Sedan That surrender took away the breath per bapa more than any event which can be re- called in modern reminiscence His death, as has been somewhere said, was after this but an ant climax 'The Bad fate in Mexico of Prince Rudolph's uncle, the Emperor Maximilian, in linked in association with the unfortunate Napoleonic name. Of modern assassinations none equals in daring and horror, or in its paralysing effect upon the civilised world, the murder of the Czar Alexander II If the sudden vanishing of eminence, due to rank, so impressive, as well proved by the public reception of the events in our times above recalled, it is certainly no less startling when men eminent by their own merits are removed at a blow 'I he names of two Presidents of the United States who have succumbed to the violence of the assassin within the memory of the present generation will at once leap to the reader's mind, as well us that of our own Indian Viceroy, Lord Mayo, and of that brave English general the hero of Lucknow, who, though he did not die by the assassin's hand, was almost as suddenly lost to his country. Sir Robert Peel's death was like those to which we have referred in the sense of sudden void which it created and in this country at least the fate which in a similar way overtook Bishop Vvilbcriorce made a profound suiiHiitioii these are some of the conspicuous figures suddenly removed in recent times Others will occur to the memory of individual readers If we include among our vanished eminences all who have had the eyes of the world turned for the moment upon them, the name of Lord Frederick Cavendish will not be forgotten. His violent end made the public hold their breath as much as any of the said events here recorded. Nor can it ever be forgotten in the lives of the present generation, how the world in thrilling suspense awaited the Issue of that wonderful Nile expedition, which came within touch of Khartoum only to hear of the noble death of the gallant hero Gordon.
