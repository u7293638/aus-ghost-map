The Diocese had hardly recovered from the loss of Dean FarreU and Archdeacon Twopeny in 1869, and was again recruiting the number of its clergy hy the accession of the Beys. C. W. Hawkias, O. G. Tallin; and F. W. Marshall, when, early in 1871, the health of the Bev. D. J. H. Ibbetson, gave way. Compelled to relin quish duty for a 'time, be sought to recover his ; health by a. voyage to New3 Zealand, : The vital powers^ however^ were fatally unpaired, and on . his retuni he lingered, with few mtermissiotBof pain, until in August he eotered into 'rest.' By '. his. removal two. important congregations were left without a pastor, but by, the kindness of the -i Archdeacon and Canon Farr, together witij the tuifl&gging; zeal -of tie .Lay Headers, services were^uppliE^ and *tlfe Sacraments1 3nly acl j^iBter^aStmialthe&tanJjeiitaeBfemHije; filled.

A riew parsonage bi& been already bililt and oc «tpiedinffie former parish, and the ! congrega iion coisiderably increased. . ' The difficulty of finding an Incumbent for StJbEn's.-was greatly enaaneed'by a heavy deW imprudently contracted in building the Bftw parsonage, and at the present time a heavy ' mortgage On it threatens to alienate both house and garden ir-om the Church. I doubt the: pro priety, if iot^h|1egality, of so desdingTrithpro; stall events; itfrastrates tb- cobjeotfor which', grantB *were obtained ' from the Attorney* of; the Society fertile Propagation of the.GbBpel. ^ Meanwhile, the important core of Kapundawas filled, by .the Bey. JjiL Donaldson, late minister of Mortlafcej; in 'Victoria, who, I trust, by; afeiKty^a^fencfevwill overcome the difficnl-: iiestaherent in a cijre which comprises a jnining : township as well as a scattered rural popula tion. ' Two other incumbencies also became! vacant in the course of last yeaiv-Blaldstonan.d' MagilL' '-?' The ^empdrary'iiiconvenience thus oaxiBed was ifemoved by the appointment respec ttvely to these cures of -the Rev. Henry J. ; Pooleana-A. Honner. St. Mary's, Sturt, and O'Halloran Tfill, have since fallen to the charge of the'Sev.tJ; Leslie Smith, and at this time Hoonta and Wallaroo alone are y-acant.* . ... ^Such rearrangement of parochial charges is not' unattended with .much trouble and cones v jwndenee, but X am not without hopes that some benefit . results from such occasional changes. It 4s gratifying to me to be able to report the completion of a spacious Church at Sfeathajbyn, to which the Eev. F. Slaney Poole was unanimously invited' by the congre gation. It forms the head station, of a large missionary district, comprising Wellington, Langhorne's Greek, and the. Lake Plains. I am , thankful that this widely-settled agricultural district, as 'well as the important town of . Strathalbyn, have been placed under the charge of an energetic -and capable minister.

'??'*' 'The Podnindie Institntion during 4he past year has increased its numbers without impair ing the moral and religions tone of theinmates, bred up for the most part on the Bfcation. In cluding a camj? of bush natives, employed partially in clearing land for agriculture, above 100 aborigines were under the religious in fluence of the Superintendent, Mr. Holden. Mr. Taplin, on his way to Streaky Bay, visited and inspected the institution. He expressed a very favorable opinion of the state and habits of the generality; ???- ' -'-''?' At Kingston, Lacepede Bay, Miss Armstrong has also carried on a native school. - The children are few in the school— do not exceed 12\. When visited lately hf myself and His Ex cellency the ^Governor,1 thosepresent manifested ;very great intelligence and sound instruction. The woodenschoolhouse, built of weatherboard, ;is much out of repair. The shingle -roof admits the rain both to- the storeroom and sleeping place of the native children-; white the weatherboards, -being warped^ make such draughts that the open air is less likely to cause catarrh than such a sleeping apartment. The weatherside, at least, of the -roof and house should be. covered at once with metal, if the school is kept on. It is not the fault of the mistress, MiBs Armstrong, that more children, are not attracted to it. The Bev. H. Howitt, who visits Kingston monthly, is very decidedly of opinion that this school deserves support. - I know not where on the sontb coast a better spot could be chosen as a missionary centime than the head-quarters of the Maria Creek tribe. It was there that the survivors from that ship-wrecked VeBsel fellviciims to a barbarity not less cruel than that which has compassed the death of otu lamented Bishop Patteson. The' South Australian Government of that day felt sailed onto make a terrible example of those natives, and the treacherous cruelty of the Nakapu iBlanders in their. use of poisoned arrows, has provoked from one of H.M. ships of war a still more fearful xetribuiion. It is onuch to be lamented that the :cause of evangelicalimissions should thus apparently be mixed up with such military . executions ; but : cruelty, treachery, -and murder will in these days, as of old,, bring down summary vengeance upon the tribe or nation which habitually culti vate those -dispoBitioBs. Even-handed British justice, however, should sw^ep from the seas those man-stealers and kidnappers who for filthy lucre entrap the savage and-reduce him to unwilling bondage. Let as hope that these disastrous events -will hereafter open a large and . effectual door for' missionary enterprise among the Melanesian Islanders. The school in 'Norfolk Island is larger than ever before ; num '. bering in all 153 MelaneBianB, -drawn from all i the islands i over sine' degrees of latitude. - In :Mota last year the Bishop baptised 293 infants and adults ; 17 lads of George Sarawia's Bchool; and 41 grown-up, mostly married- men and women.r -To Canon Fidal the BiBhop wrote j— ; 'Peay more tiian ever for this '- little Infant Church and George Sarawia.' . The work and ! character «f our dear brother and' lamented Bishoo Pattesonxsah never be forgotten by the i members of this Church and Diocese. His praise is in all tie Churches *' he (himself with ; the saints in glory. - . But we have been invited to contribute towards 'Some memorial to bis* | nuine-^-and what memorial so good or so. dear | as to support and extend his mission? -Our [resources are not great. To our. power we have icohtributedio it By God's help we will con |tinue to do so. The want of a new mission ship, ;in' which to carry on the work, is ;the most jpressing at this time. In addition to our usual ; subscriptions, some of us may bedisposed to aid I in this way, and 3o enable his co-workers 'in? I Norfolk island to .preach the Gospel of peace ;in those places where the Bishop died as a true i soldier of 'the cross ; thus fixemplif ying his own= (loving character and the Teal nature of that' : blessed Gospel which he sought to propagate;' The savage will then learn to discriminate the; iniessenger of peace from the sword-bearer or^ ;the freebooter. He will then fly to the former as a friend and succourer rath=r: than with iremoreeleas crueliy slay one whom he had' Soace; Jo^own and ?. honored, and then be^; jgoiiedto M3r-death. - In conclusion, I may;re-*' /mark that ni spite of : death and transfers of ', clergy to different cures, nearly ail the statis-; ; tical returns show an increase. Tkere are' more: i churches; and. congregations, more communi ; cants, more confirmed, more sittings let, more | funds raised. The Sunday-scholars haveslightly [decreased.: J commend this last point to the careful consideration of Ihe Incumbents.

OHtTEOH LAOT33. ?-.'.- ; Mr. N. BLTTHimoved— '.That for. the future, in the. cases, of Churches seeking union with Synod, the land whereon the church stands jbeing under the provisions of jthe Seal Property Act, it shall be absolutely necessary that the certificate of title be in the name of tne synod sof the Church of England in 'the Diocese of Adelaide incorporated.' Since the passing of the Real Property Act all land alienated from the Crown was ipgo facto under that Act. All land alienated before might be brought under it if it was the wish of the owner, and the title jwas sb^own: to be good. One of the pecu liarities of ' -the Act was that it did not jecognise anything like trusts. The person appearing on the face of the deed- as ;owner of the -title was the b\|rner. ' To' pro' vide against contingencies, the Wesleyans had a number of names on the deed, but this .was a cumbersome plan,;aiQd 'the, mode he prpppsed, :that the certificate of title- should -We in .'the name of the Synod of the Church of England in, .the Diocese incorporated, was much simpler. The Synod7 never died, but when the title, was in the name of one or more persons* if a death: or insolvency occurred amongst, them a difficulty, was. created. It was proposed that the Synod ? should give the officers of the, church of which' they received the certificate of 'title a deed shewing that, it was held for them ; and altogether he thought the. plan a good one and worthy of adoption; Mr. G. ff. Hawkes seconded. Mr. Thbotj? concurred with Mr. Blyth in the necessity for something oeing done in the matter, but he wasafraidMs motion would do an in jury. ... The minister was appointed by a Patronage Committee, consisting of the Church wardens, Trustees,- ana some members, of tbe congregation/ If they did away with the Trustees by Synod the Synod became one of the Trustees. This would cause confusion, and would do away with the. principle fought for by the Laity— that the patronage o£ a Ghtufili should be res'eryed-to the Diocese itself. There was another difficulty. The Synod being, the last appeal for a clergyman, it would, if the. motion were, carried, .be plapsd in 'the .position -oi a judicial and executive tribunal. He quite' agreed with the object of the motion .if it could he carried out without interfering with the local patronage: 'It'woulff iJe^etter' to with draw the .motion, or refer it to, the Standing Committee.1 -Mn MoctDBir isaid;- provided those obstacles mentioned by Mr. Thrupp could tie overcome, fie-wouia agree to -the motion. His Lordship also agreed with! 'the motion; if the difficulties mentioned could be Surmounted. : ^ Mr^BliTTH'repiied, asBer ting-that the Synod -should have what he claimed for it,' and that the ^difficulty mentioned would ? be got pver 4-y th6-Sjmod giving the Diocese a deed showing how tSey-held the title. ??? He had not the slightest wish 'that the -Synod should inter fere with the patronage'bf Churches. - As to the second objection, he thought the fact of the J property being vested in the Synod would be all the better. -'The matter was too important to be ?decided by a Committee, arid he should press hiatnotion.
