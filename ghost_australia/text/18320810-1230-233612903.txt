Miscellanea- GRAY THE PoETi-^-lt is well known that Gray removed from P-eter-hduse to Pembroke-hall, in consequence of some annoyance to which he was subject—the following letter,' preserved in Nichos's work gives more particulars than we remember to "have elsewhere met with :—" Mr. Gray, our elegant poet, and de- licate fellow-commoner of Peter-liouse, has removed to Pembroke-ball, in resentment of some usage he met with at the former place. The case is much talked of, and is this. • He is much afraid of fire, and was a great sufferer in Corn-hill; "he has ever since kept a ladder of ropes by him, soft as the silky cords by which Romeo ascended to Juliet, and has had an iron machine fixed to his bed-room window. The other morning. Lord Percival, and some Petrenchians, going a hunting, were determined to have a little-sport before they set out, and thought it would be no bad diversion to make Gray bolt, as they called it; so ordered itheir man Joe Draper to call out fire. A delicate white nigbt-cap is said to have appeared at the window; but findingthe mistake, retired azain to'the couch.' The young fellows, bad he descended, were determined, they said, ,to have whipped the butterfly up again." THEiPoWElt OF WOMRN.-AI) Editor in one of the country towns in the western states of Aiherica, makes a most strange apology for the non-appearance , of his paper, on tbe regular day of publication, which fre give in his own words:—" I feel ashamed to own the fact, but ' murder will out.' The'plain reason was, my readers, that my dear wife said Ijnust stay at home and take care of tbe children, while she went to a Camp-Meeting, an& as 1 am a peace- making sort of a man, I did as 1 was'bid,'which is the "only apology I htivje to make/'. -Ivn'i . . ••' ' ; I THEORIES OT THE EARTH. —Moses related that the world wias created in six daysj, ;tbat allmankindsprang from;one pair, andtnat when the earth was peopled toja certain extent^ the Deity^ p^en^ed ,with thi wickedness of bis breatures, destroyea the world by a deluge.
