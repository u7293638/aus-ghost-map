A BON A FIDE GHOST. Abonafide ghost, and one, too, of a rather lively temperament, appears to have put in an appearance in the neighborhood of Castlemaine. The M. A. Mail gives the following particulars relative to the. pranks of tho supernatural visitor : — ' If a large number of persons are to be believed, there is a noted ' bleak ' house, situate not a hundred miles from the junction of the Campbell's Creek and Tar rengower roads, which for some months past has been the scene of nightly visitations of restless souls: who have reorossed the Styx. The tenant o'f the house is a brawny blacksmith, not likely to be easily scared, but both he and hia family maintain that, in a oertain room of the house, there are nightly such strange goings-on, such unearthly noises, such: jumping about of chairs and tables, ac companied by,, strange moans and groans, that it is impossible for any of them, to sleep, yet on entering the room all is as quiet and still as the air when the winds are huakod. No sooner, however, is the door of the apartment closed, than the pranks and frolics are resumed with redoubled vigor, nor do they cease 'tiU daylight does appear. It is currently repovtail that incredulous neighbors have pa,fi§ei\ partioas of the night in the house, and. that tho experience of all verifies the statement of the blacksmith. Among tho number of persons alluded to is ah onergetio member of the borough council, and a well-known Bonifuce, born of no pale-faced fear.
