He is a steady chap, minds his own business, and as shrewd as they make them. The other day the senior partner of the firm, who seldom comes around, made a tour of inspection, and, as he approached the assistant bookkeeper, he noticed the solemn expression on hisface. Desiring to be genial, he said: " How are you, young man ? I see you are at your work. That is good. Close attention to business will always bring its own reward.

What's gaun wrang wi' ye a' ?' Mr M'Kenzic, M.L.A., introduced a depntr tion on Wednesday to tho Minister of Lani fiom tlio Seymour council, which complains that the efforts in that district to cope with tl rahhit pest were not sufficiently energetii The rabbits were numerous on some of the pri vote lauds within the shire, and nothing wi done to.. diminish the pest beyond trappinj which was ineffective. It was sncgested thi owners or occupiers of land should bo compelle to lay poison during the summer months, t that was the most effectual way of keeping tl pest in check. Tho deputation also asked thi the Vermin Destruction Act should be amende by requiting land owners to tako all " rensor able " instead of all " necessary" stops 1 destroy the rabbits. The act as it was at pr< sent allowed an inspector to summon a lane ownor ifho saw a rabbit on the holding, no1 withstanding that the owner might be doin his best to keep the pest in check. Mr M'Co replied that he could not accede to this r< quest, as he had pledged himself in Pariiamei not to relax the provisions of the act. I feared that the amendment desired would les to efforts on the part of landowners heir lessoned, which would result in an increase the number of rabbits. He would instruct A Allan, chief inspector under the act, to see th the act was vigorously enforced when the war weather again set in, aa tho rabbitB would tal the poison more readily then.
