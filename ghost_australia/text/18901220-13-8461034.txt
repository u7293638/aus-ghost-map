THE STANLEY BARTTELOT CON'l'ltOVMliUY. MR. J. ROSS TROUP'S NARRATIVE By this time Mr. Stanley must begin to feel as uncomfortable as Macbeth did when the long procession of ghosts defiled before him and us book after book appears in reference to the proceedings of the rear column, the explorer must be tempted to exclaim, "What will the line stretch out till crack of doom?" The latest contribution to the controversy is the narrative of Mr. J. Rose Troup, for an early copy of which we are indebted to Messrs. Melville, Mullen, and Slade. Mr. Troup was transport officer of the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition, and he writes to correct "the most inaccurate accounts of what took place at Yombuya, and to vindicate his own character and that of the two gallant officers whose lives were sacrificed in the discharge of what they believed to be their duty, and, as it would seem, in loyal obedience to the orders of their chief, who has since accused 'them of reprehensible inaction. Mr. Stanley's instructions were " to await the arrival of all the loads and men, and in the event of his (Major Barttelot) not obtaining all the additional porters, and supposing that he preferred marching rather than waiting for the return of the advance column, he might make marches twice over or else wait patiently atYambuya." Ashwell known, the additional porters could only be obtained from Tippu Til), a two-faced and untrustworthy old Arab, who was distrusted by Stanley himself and as the latter had pointed out to Major Barttelot that his chief duty was to care for the clouds and men, because if these were lost the advance force itself would need to solicit relief in its turn," the leader of the rearguard appears to have erred, if he erred at all, on the side of circumspection and prudence. On leaving, Stanley told the Major that he should be away five months, and the rear column, allowing a fair margin on the leader's own calculations, was daily looking for his arrival. " Tippy Tin was still making pro- mises, and our commander hoped they would be fulfilled, but as Mr. Stanley might be with us at any moment, why should we abandon our precious loads for the sake of advancing a couple of days' journey into the forest?" Eventually they did march out, and what happened ? " Major Barttelot, using his discretion, takes 380 loads, which Tipjiu-Tih bus obliged him to reduce to 40lb. oneil. Following Sir. Stanley's commands, as soon as he receives Tippu-Tib's men, he marches out ; he advances slowly ; his path is beset by endless difficulties ; the Munyucinu-s prove unmanageable ; they creep on at a snail's pace (but no slower than they would have done had they made marches seven times over at the end of 18 days they are at Ronalyti, about 20 miles from Yamba) a. Disaster overtakes them here. Major Bart- below is assassinated ; Mr. Jameson seeks assistance and then meets his death, while with difficulty Mr. Bonny saves less than 300 loads; and of carriers Mr. Stanley writes (under date of September 4, 1888) :-' There were only 71, many of them too sick to move, the majority worthless as carriers, and only about 10 at all presentable or suitable for the long journey before it.' What, then, would have happened had we marched without Tipperary h assistance ? Could anyone reasonably expect that we could have succeeded in those weary marches forth and back? Must we, then be condemned because, in obedience to Mr. Stanley's instructions, we remained at Ynmbuya rather than throw away our loads, and eventually, still obeying his instructions, when Tippu-Tib's men came, Major Barttelot marched with what he could marry ? Can he, after recalling this disaster that occurred when we had the benefit of the assistance of Tippu- Tib's 400 Mun years, still hold that we could have done better with our miserable 175 men ?" Sir Iroup publishes copious extracts from the diary he kept in "warnings, and one of these entries, on the 3rd of burning, 1888, after they had been in camp nearly five months, denotes Major Barttelot anxiety to proceed in search of Stanley under the apprehension that some disaster had befallen him. The Mayors proposition to equip a huge expedition for this purpose was vigorously combated by Sir '1 soup, who says I stated that even if Sir Stanley had been stopped by numbers of natives, I could not see what such a small force as Barttelot proposes to take could do to help him out of his difficulties I do not see the necessity why at this present time um caravan should be sent up and certainly not one that can be of very little service to Stanley should they meet him in fact none, unless he is short of ammunition It is not at all unlikely that Barttelot may miss Stanley, or some of his party on their way down, with definite instructions as to what we me to do In this case all the men would be away with the exception of the sick and a few others left at the camp here and the consequence would be that the expedition would be split up in three sec- tions, scattered over Central Africa and those left at the base would be unable to carry out the orders of the chief Barttelot s written instructions left him by Stanley me clear enough He was to follow on with all the officers men, and stores when he had the earners promised by impulse, and in the event of 'lippe lib Bending only a part of the requisite number, a list was given of loads which he might not dispense w i t On the 14th of February Barttelot was still enter to advance and was prepared to give happy is a bond for Â£5,000 if he would furnish 200 porters and 200 armed men, or 1 200 men without loads, but differences of opinion prevailed among the party, and the Major. resolved to proceed to Stanley Falls in the hope of gaining some intelligence concerning Stanley, but without success. He returned from thence at Hill end of Stay, having obtained 400 Sfonjuemns from Salmi ben Mohammed But in the meanwhile sickness and mortality had reduced the original garrison to about a hundred, few of whom were able bodied, and Mr tions was rendered helpless by a severe illness, and was obliged to return home, so that his narrative breaks off at an interesting point, which would be a matter of regret were it not that the subsequent history of the rear column has been related in Major Barttelot diary and by Sir Jephson the last two chapters of the book and the two oppendiccKoio occupied with the writers correspondence with Stanley subsequently to December last, and with official despatches and telegrams lit Sir ironpsfiist letter to his late chief he requests him to heal the report of the senior surviving officer of the rearguard before condemning publicly till the subordinates To this Stanley vouchsafed no reply 'three months Intel Mt hour addresses a second communication to that gentleman, which is both a narrative of facts and a personal vindication The most union taint portion of the former is here sub joined Studying your written instructions, with these verbal additions, as furnished by the officer on left in command, what was to be gathered from them A Simple) this You mention certain contingencies and give us certain alternatives which 1 condense into thelollowingfoimula -

" You may probably tell the entire press of the world for you are eloquent, and smart in your writing and clever and learned to accept our view of your case but I adhere to my own opinion still which is that my conscience will not acquit you and your companions from blame in the case of John Henry, the Soudanese soldier the boy South, and a dozen other cases for sum winning without a decent struggle for your reputation as officers and 1 irishmen and freemen of equal breed and intelligence rights and privileges to which you were fairly entitled Something to blood sullenly in your huts, when a calm, temperate polite but resolute attitude, such as duty and common sense dictated would have saved the rear column from the miserable and helpless state in which I found the dying and despairing remnant of it. As neither concessions nor apologies were to be extracted from the author of In Dai lent Aft as, nothing remained to Sit Lroup but to publish his version of the events which have led to such on amount of ink shed and one thing his book appears to establish very clearly, namely, that Major Barttelot, instead of hanging back, was, perhaps injudiciously, eager for on ndv once in search of, or to meet, Stanley, but was restrained by the more prudent counsels of his colleagues, counsels justified by the express instructions of Dieu chief _
