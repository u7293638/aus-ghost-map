THE COMET. A few days ago a correspondent signing himself " Observer'wrote to us as follows lief ore the comet disdjii icara, ic would increase my interest in our illustrious visitor to have lite following qtiestious answered, if the elements have hevn obtained to do so:— " o. What is the weight of the comet ? " b. What is the specific gravity ? "c. What was the maximum velocity at perihelion V " d. What has lioen the length of tail ? "f. What angle docs .the plane of the cornel's orbit form with the piano of the Earth's orbit? "/. What distance was the comet from the Earth when passing through the plane of the Ear'li's orbit before and after perihelion ?" We referred li's letter to Sir. C. Toild, C.M.G., who has hindlv supplied us with the following information:— . "nand b. We possess no data, for answering either of these questions. All observations of comets—even the largest—go to show that their mass is infinitesinully small. The satellites of Jupiter exhibited no signs of disturbed orbits when Lexell's Comet twice jiassed through flieir n.idst, although its own orbit on each occasion was altogether altered. IN or was the earth senBibljj disturbed when the same comet eame within 1,500,000 miles of its surface. The present comet is probably no exception to the rule, and although when first seen its nucleus was large, apparently globular, and solid, or planetary looking, both before and after the perihelion, it has since altered its form, and is now reduced to a thin streak of light set in its surrounding coma, giving one the idea of an emission of the matter forming the nucleus in two streams into the tail, which has grown in length from about 5° to 20°, and is now over 100,000,000 miles long. "c. ike perihelion passage occurred late on the night of September 17, or early in the morning of the ISth, the distance from the sun being less than auy previously known comet, or about 453,000 miles, that is, within about 23,000 miles of the sun's surface. It must, therefore, have rushed through the coronal or gaseous matter sur rounding the sun with a velocity approach ing 1,000,000 miles an hour, or half round the sun in lees than two hours. " d. The length of the tail has varied from about eight or ten millions to over 100,000,000, and to this must be added the faint long extended envelope in front of the head towards the bud, which developed itself in a most remarkable manner between the 3rd and the 7th inst. The first time I noticed the formation of this outer envelope was on the morning of the 3rd, when the nucleus was reduced to a long bright streak, the coma and tail being very bright, and the latter very Bharply defined and bright on its southern edge and cirrous or feathury on the north edge. Surrounding the head, and for Borne distance to the rear and along the tail, was a fainter envelope forming a margin of considerable breadth. This during the fol lowing forty-eight hours extended to at least 3' liom the head, with a pointed termination. " e. The inclination of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic is about 38°. "/. At its ascending node it must have ' been between 91,000,000 and 92,000,000 miles from the earth. The longitude of the ascend ing node is about 353° 38', the whole of the orbit, excepting where at perihelion it passes round the sun nearly grazing its aur tace, is south of the ecliptic; and as the heliocentric longitude of the earth at the perihelin passage of the comet was about 355°, the comet must have passed nearly between us and the sun. " While writiug about this comet it may be interesting to compare its orbit, which, by tlie-by, is only a first rough approximation kindly supplied by Mr. nllery with the celebrated comets of 1008,1843, and 1880.

'"Laugier and Mauvais assigned a period of between thirty-live and thirty-six years to the comet of 1843, hut Hubbard made it 530 years, and the comet of 1880 has probably a period of thirty-six or thirty- seven years. It siill be seen that these four comets have nearly identical orbits, and that all at their perihelion have rushed into dangerous proximity to the sun—through, in fact, its coronal ilarocs. That they must have suf fered violence for their temerity seems cer tain, and the question arises—Are they one and the same comet, or fragments of the same body ? If tbe present comet is identical v ith that of 1880, it may, as Mr. Tebbutt sug gests, return to us again in a short space, and may perhaps fail into the sun next time. 'Phis, however, need cause no apprehension. If the comet of 1880 was identical with that of 1843, it had been reduced to a ghost of its lormer size. In its physical aspects the pre sent comet far more resembles 1843. Has the latter Bultercd a fate similar to that of tieila, and been split into two fragments, the comets of 1880 and i8S2 being the components ? "Exaininiug the nucleus with a spectro scope fixed on to tiie equatorial, I find it has a somewhat complex spectrum. The three carbon lires come out bright and strong, Each band is a bundle of lines, especially the middle one, the central portion of each being brightest.
