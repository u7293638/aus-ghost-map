NO exception can be taken to the con vening of a party caucus on the eve of a general election. What we are ac customed to regard as the Liberal party in Victoua is numerous and strong enough to make its united action a matter of serious moment. But there are many reasons for supposing that the gathering over which Mr Deakin will preside this afternoon, will have to content itself with general congratulation and encouragement There is the foi midable fact that, out of all those who will assemble at the bid ding of their chief, many may be said to lack any reasonable assurance of re election. It must be felt amongst them that the utterances, which to day cairy the weight attaching to the opinions of representative men, may, in .a few short weeks, be discounted down to the personal opinions of individual politicians. Then, again, there is no fixed standatd of political faith to en sure united action on any debatable point, and, further than this, theieis the fact that the general policy of the country has been deliberately agreed to on all sides, and the Libei al leaders are as much identified with it as the Victorian Conservatives. We are led to suppose that the caucus will be asked to decide whether we ought to persevere in coalition, or hark back to party government This issue, most mildly put as it is by Mr Deakix, is really the crux of the whole position. There is no present reason to suppose that a majority of the Liberals, 01 even any considerable minority of them, are anxious to retiograde into unprofitable party warfare Tiiey aie shrewd enough to see that such a warfare would involve the possibility of disastrous loss, while victory, if it were achieved, would re suit in very questionable gain The fact which cannot be gainsaid or ignored is this, that we are doing very well as we are, and cannot reasonably hope to do better, ev en if our affairs are committed to the extiemists of either party. A few discontented electors and a few dissatisfied members may find their present interest in promoting poli tical civil wai, but the bulk of the people of Victoria have no desireforrevolution, and recognise, only too plainly, that their interests would suffer, which ever way the issue fell The fact is, we do not want any disturbance of the existing oider of things at the instance of any rainouty of malcontents When the electors of Victoria see cause to be dissatisfied w ith a mixed Government a change will follow in the natural course of events In the meantime we do not want to anticipate any possible development of national politics which may arise during the next decade. This afternoon’s congress will, there fore, most probably take the form of a socialgatheringof political sympathisers and friends There will be some talk of a return to party Government, some talk of insisting on a prohibition stock tax, something perhaps about a re con struction of the Ministry, and peihaps a word about a sliding scale bounty on wheat But all this will be, at best, respectable make believe A return to party Government on the old lines is impossible because advancing knowledge has swept the old boundaiy lines away. A 25 pei cent ad valorem stock tax would not now, we presume, be seriously pioposed by any Government which wished to escape a prompt vote of no confidence Re construction of the Ministiy is not a matter to be decided by promiscuous meetings of electors, or even of membeis, while the proposal for a bounty on wheat can only pi ovoke a smile In all the mam lines of the Government progiamine, so fai as it is known, both Consetva tives and Libeials are at one. If we except extravagant border duties as things which are, by mutual consent, shelved for the present, there is no seuous diffeieuce on any essential line of national policy. All hands are ' agreed that Australian fede~ation will be a good -tiling, as soon as equitable conditions can bis arranged, that irriga tion ought to be vigorously helped for ward by the State, that bonuses should be given to new industries, and that every possible help should be extended to the farmer. And it must not be forgotten that Mr Deakin has explicitly and uniesenedly committed himself to intercolonial fiee trade, and a customs union against outsideis. And, no longer than a week ago he in public spoke of the solid advantages of a coalition Government in teiras which remain on record to prove that either he is a fii m believ ei in it, or else that he has an extiaoulmary talent foi teigiversation It is quite possible that, before veiylong, some great nation il issue may piesent itself, which will divide our leading states men into hostile camps At present no such issue is appaient, and any at tempt to anticipate such a division is mischievously unnecessary The appearance of the famous New Zealand chief Te Kooti, w ith a band of armed followers, in the neighbor hood of Poveity Bay, in the North Island, may lead lo moie mischief than can be, at present, foreseen Poveity Bay enjoys the distinction of being the fiist place landed upon by Captun Cook on Bth October, 1769 It also possesses the melancholy noto nety attached to a brutal massacre of Europeans and friendly natives by the insurgent natives captained by Te Kooti, this lattei event occurnng on 10th November, 1868 On that day 33 Europeans and 37 fnendly Maones were surprised by Te Kooti’s wamors and mercilessly killed without lespect to sex oi age It was a bar barous incident m what, flora fiist to last, was a sanguinaiy and murdeious war The Poverty Bay massacre natu rally stirred up the most iclentless de sire of vengeance against Tn Kooti and his horde of vvatnors, and thencefor ward Ins death or captuie may be said to hav e held first place in the pi osecution of the irregular campaign A big re wai and was offered for the production of this arch murderer, dead or alive, be sides which the story of the massacie caused him to be legarded with a hoi ror second in degree to that which vvis acquired in India by the infamous Nava Sahib But, although his band was repeatedly encounteied and de feated, Te Kooti yv as nev ei i ecognised among either the prisoners or the dead After one of these defeats the remnants of Ins bodyguaid secreted themselves in the impenetrable bush, ic appealing after a while on fresh errands of rapine and muider. On one of these laids, at Ngatapu, in January, 1869, Te KootTs band suffered seveie defeat, it being reported that their victorious chief had fallen in the fight Other rumors had it that he was severely wounded, and taken by his adheients into some obscure retreat to suffer,a lingenng death. At all events he disappeaied fiom the public know ledge foi several years, and the report of his came to be regarded as tiue. Still later theie were rumors that he was, after all, alive, and these grew stronger until it became an established fact that Te Kooti was still in exist ence In the meantime the gieat Maori war h id passed and gone The ascendancy of British rule was re garded as established beyond any possibility of serious question, and the Maories were no longei looked upon as a well oiganised band of brave men disputing, inch by inch, the European advance into then territory', but as those who, having thoioughly learnt the lessons of British supremacy and powei, might be kindly regarded in the light of vanquished enemies who mightm time become fi lends and allies So it has been ever since, and the intermixture of the white and Maori races has been peacefully earned on Only one or two cucumstances, and those very unlikely to happen, could have seriously threatened to revive old race hostilities m all their im placable bitterness, but unfoitunately the advance of Te Kooti upon Poverty Bay must be regarded as one of these It is more than twenty years since the shocking massaci e at that place was perpetrated, but there are still alive many contemporaries, young and old, of the murdered men and women. To these in the first degree, and to all the white residents in a secondary degree, this re appeararice of Te Kooti, w ill appear as an affront, if not a challenge to re prisals. Old sores will be re-opened, old grudges ic heated, and the old un satisfied desire for vengeance will certainly ic appeal. Te Kooti was amnestied about six years since, and so long as he makes no sign of overt hostility the Government professes to be unable to legally restrain his actions All the worse for the peace of the country if this be so The 300 armed settleis, of whom we already are in formed, may easily increase to 3000, and Te Kooti may find at the hands of lynch law the fate he has so long successfully evaded Mr S L Bailey, one of the candidates for Bdlarat West, addressed a meeting of electors last evening, in the hall of the Mining Exchange Ihe mayor of the city picstded At the.conolu-ion of his address, a vote of confidence in the candidate was earned.

Mr M’Dermott, instructed by Mr Shaw, appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr E P Wynne, instructed by Mr Robert son, for the contractor. The plaintiff in his evuience stated that he was returning home to his residence in Scott parade, Bal larat East, between 9 and 10 o’clock on the evening of Siturday, Ist December last He was unawaio of the railway cutting across Victoria street, and on seeing the fence on the road walked to the side along a drvy track He next remembered falling into the culting, on his head and shoulder, and remained there until he was assisted home. On the second day after he attended at the Hospital w here he was treated for the injuries to his shoulder. The plaintiff stated that he was sober at the time of the occur rence, and had not beeu able to work since. Dr Scott, resident surgeou at the H ospit il, stated that the nature of plaintiffs in juries was such as would incapacitate him from using his arm, probably two or three months after the accident For the defence Mr Roberts, one of the contractors, was cilled, and stated that the cutting was fenced off, and every possible precaution taken against accident. A number of other wit nesses who weie examined, gave evidence as to tbs' tepee having been pat up securely on work being. stopped on the day of the acci- j dent, and was found so next morning. A lamp had been removed by some persons during the evening, but was replaced as soon as attention was called to it. In the opinion of these witnesses the plaintiff could not have fallen into the cutting without orawl ing through or climbing over the fence. Mr Wynne submitted that there was no negli gence on" the pat t of the defendants, and his Honor said he would either enter a ver dict for the defendants or non suit the plain tiff Mr M'Dermott elected to take a non suit During the public meeting in connection w ith the Garibaldi Sunday School (Wesleyan) Anniversary, on Monday evening, a band of hoys old enough to know better, disturbed the vvorslnppeis by throwing stones on the roof of the church, ringing the chinch bell, and other similar senseless and reprehensible practice 0 Several of the offenders are known, and a lepetition of such conduct may leul to unpleasvut consequences for them A garnishee summons, Crook v Cooke was heard in chambers yesterday by his Honor Judge Quinlan MrJ.

The cause of death was certified by Dr Pettigrew as enteritis of six days’ duration The remains of the deceased gentleman are to be interred in Terang Cemetery on Thursday, the funeral procession leaving the Homestead at 2 o’clock His demise is universally deplored by all. Mr Robertson (the only surviving son of late Captun Robertson, of the Honor able East India Company’s Service), has just arrived for the purpose of formally taking possession of his hereditary estates of Con newarran and Wollongong. The demise of late lamented Mr McKinnon is particularly unfortunate at the present juncture, as he was an executor under the very complicated will of Mrs Jemima Vars Robertson.” On Sunday afternoon last the Anglican Bishop of Ballarat (writes our correspondent) held a confirmation service in St John’s Church,Egerton The service (an impressive one throughout) began by the singing of the hy inn, “ Thine for ever, God of love ” Prayer was then offered by the bishop, followed by an eloquent and exceedingly eirnest dis course from Ephesians i , 13 and 14 verses. An offertory was then taken up in aid of the sustentiitiou fund of the diocese, followed by the singing of the hymn, “ My God accept my' heart this day.” The reudei in chaige (Mr Barker) read the declaration, and handed to the bishop the list of candidates examined and presented by him, and then read the preface to the cunfiimatioii service. The bishop then put the usual solemn ques tion to the candidates, and the required answer was audibly given Prayer followed, and then the cindidates (five females and two males) were each led forward individu ally, and kneeling reverently at the comnm moil intis, received imposition of hands from the bishop. The hy inn, “0, Jesus, I have pionnaed,” was then heartily sung, followed by the remainder of the confiimation service, and after the benediction w is pronounced, the congi eg ition, numbering close on 170 persons of various denominations, reverently dispersed The singing was excellent, a full choir being present, with Miss Alice Tanner ably presiding at the orgin Avery interesting leeture on “China” (writes our correspondent) was delivered at the Temper nice Hall, Bunmyong, on Mon day evening, before the ANA, by Mr Heiberte, from Ballarat The lecturer had lived in China for about 15 years, and his address showed that he must have carefully studied the characteristics and habits of the people He exhibited specimens of Chinese workmanship, presenting the ladies of tire audience with some Chinese notepaper. The lecturer stated that he was rather astonished at the faith n posed in Chinese doctors by the people of this colony, and gave some most amusing illustrations of Chinese method of curing sickness. After a lengthy and most interesting addiess, Mr Herberts was heartily thanked by the members present for Ins kindness Operations have been commenced on the Cnnperdowu and Cunlie’a River hue, and numerous gangs of men are already at work on various sections between the junction at Gnotuk and Cobden The first formal step with regard to the formation of a water woiks trust in Colac for thesupply of the town with an abundance of the precious flui 1 (says the liejormer) has been taken by the shire council Applies turn is being made through the necessary channels, for, among other things, a loan of £l3 000 to carry out the work Ihc Melbourne correspondent of the Aratat Adveituer, referring to the caucus to be held today, say s—“ Though Mr Deakin is sincere in his desire to maintain the Cos ilition fur afinther period, it is not very cleir whether his hand mly not bo forced by the action of his followers, who no neees o nily somewhat halfhearted in preserving the existing condition of things in perpetuity. Coalition may secure peace to meinb“ia—though the all night sittings necessitated to quell the obstructionists during the 1 ist few sessions have not been a very staking ex nnple of that—and they may help to ensure the pro-perity of the country; but under it there are no spoils to the vie tors; nor—and this is an important con side ration to members, some of whom have only a few yeuis of Parliamentary life before them—there are very few changes in the personnel of the team on the box seat. Therefoie, the discussion on the question of whether the Coalition shall be continued will be a somewhat brisk one on Wednesday, and lam not at all sure of the result. If the Liberals weie then to decide upon calling their representatives out of the Government, we should have to face a somewhat remark able condition of affaus, rendered the more so by the fact that Parliament was ex piring, and a geneuvl close at hand. Until that caucus has settled the future for us, it would be idle to speculate upon the Ministerial statement A return to party government would render many of the bnl limit Budget proposals of last year impos sible of execution, and if political contest again disturbs Victoria it is exceedingly questionable if there will be a rush for any more loans at so low a rate as three and a half per cent ” • The miners’ strike at the Vale Colliery, Lithgow, New South Wales, has been mine ably settled by the proprietor agteeing to give an advance of three halfpence per ton all round.

Candidates at election tune (sajs the Campetdown Chronicle) ire generallj prolific in promises, but wheu they succeed in gain mg their ends they are liable to forget them. Urn Hon J P.

In South Amend M .dame Patti will receive moie, as the contract into which she has entered for a senes qf ope ratio performances in Buenos Ayres and elsewheie next summer provides for a minimum nightly payment of £I2oO, pin* half the gross receipts over a certain sum The Herald states that 134 G people died of delirium tremens in England last j ear ihe price of potvtoes at Warrnambool on Saturdaj (sajs the Standard) advanced to £4 per ton Although this is a high figure when compared with that of the p.st few years, still it does not represent such a good thing for the farmers as it would seem to denote at the first blush. While £B, £9, and £lO were being given some weeks ago for the tubers, of comse, those who brought in their produce did well. \A ith the price at £4, however, matters have not the nine roseate hue The reason is this —The greater portion of the crops in the distuct IS not yielding more than two or three tons to the acre Taking the latter number, three, a field of 20 acres would re vhse £240 at £4 per ton, while with a yield of seven tons to the acre with the prices ruling at £2, the farmer would be better pud—as the result I would be £2BO Thus it will be seen that in [ most instances fai mers are not coining money, as the market price has led many to infer. In fact, many of the settlers state that it would not pay them to dig the pota toes at leas than £4 a ton. Of course, there are exceptions, and in a few cases where lucky’individuals have been favored with better Yields than their less fortunate neigh bors, the £4 a tou should prove a payable price indeed.
