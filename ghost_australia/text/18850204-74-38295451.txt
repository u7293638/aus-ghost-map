A day or two subsequently Mr. Murray-Smith, the Agent-General in London, wrote a dis patch, which has now been received. In it he stated that the Colonial Office at first doubted the authenticity of the news, but that they subsequently admitted it, and acknowledged that the conduct of Germany was unfriendly, though they held out hopes that it might be possible by diplomatic negotiation to reverse the action of-Prince Bismarck, so far as Now Guinea was concerned. Mr. Murray- Smith also alluded to the apathy of the Colonial Office, and deplored the want of unanimity in Australia, and especially the action of New South Wales. The South Australian Jockey Club have applied to the Victorian Racing Club for permission to hold a three days' meeting on the Flemington course in May next. At a meeting of theV.R.C. Committeo held yesterday, it was agreed to accede to the request. The reason for the South Aus tralian Club migrating from Adelaide to Melbourne arises from the circumstances connected with the recent legislative powers passed by the South Australian Parliament in respect to betting and the use of the totalisator on the Morphetvillo course, which has practically abolished racing in the sister colony. No doubt the Adelaide Cup, which last year was a handi cap of 2500 sovs., will be included in the Iay programme. The following horses have been struck outof their engagements for the Caulfield meet next Saturday ;-Donation andOhuck ster for the Hawksburn Handicap; Lepa rello, Umberto, and Duenna for the St. Valentine Handicap; and Caractacus for the Hurdle.

Speaking at a luncheon following the ceremony of laying tihe foundation stone of the South Barwonshire Hall at Belmont to-day, the lion. Graham Berry said that if the colonies had been federated they could have spoken on the annexation question with a voice of thunder to Earl Derby,who must then have listened to them. So long, however, as Victoria sent home one tole gram, and New South VWales another of a difflrent character, Earl Derby was afforded the excuse that we wcre not united ourselves. The London Press said that that was Earl Derby's only excuse, and he should be deprived of it by the unity of the colonies.
