MEN AS MACHINES. "Writing in the " North American Beview," Mr Mulhall, the statistician, gives soiae curious facts respecting the working power of various races. . Since 1810 the working power of the individual in the United: States has been almost doubled through useful inventions. The woridngjpower, measured in foot-tons, is in the States 1940, tons daily, while the working power of an individual in Great Britain is 1470 tons. The working power of a. single person in America is twice that of a German or of a Frenchman, more than three times that of an Austrian, and five times that of an Italian. In 1890 ihe United Stares produced 350 bushels of grain and 12301os of meat per, hand employed, while each hand employed in similar tasks in the United Kingdom produced only 119 bushels of grain and 10901bs of meat. Insurance the pro duction amounted to only 98 bushels of grain and ooOlbs of meat; while in, Germany, Austria, and Italy it rvas still less. As Mr Mulhall puts it:—"An ordinary farm hand in the United States raised as much grain as three in England, four in France, five in Germany, or six in Austria, which shows what an enormous waste of labor occurs in Europe because farmers are not possessed of the same mechanical appliances as in che United States."
