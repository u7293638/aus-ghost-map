Tlio greatest dcmi god of all was Spcisl yai, tho coyote. At ouo time tbo pcoplo were dying at, a rapid rate, and there was groat mourning. Whai-a-ma, the eagle, who hud lost many friends, was told by Speelyai that the dead would not remain in spirit land, but, liko tbo brown and dead leuves of autumn, would come to enrth again with tbo opening buds and flowers of spring. AVhai a-ma -was not willing to wait until spring, smd persuaded the coyote to go with, him to spirit-land and bring tboru back ut one.o. After many days thoy came to a great wator, on tho other sido of which was a largo village. Spirits conducted them across tlio water, smd they entered the principal house of tho village, which wuh lighted by tho moon: this luminary was guarded by a monster frog that bad jumped to it from the earth. Speelyai killed tho frog aid swallowed tbo moon, leaving tho house, in darkness. In tho confusion thit ensued, Whai-u-mu caught tho spirits and confined them in a largo box. Speelyai put tbo box ou bis shoulders and tho two invaders started buck for tbo land of tho living. Soon the spirits in the box be gan to come to life, and Speolyai's burden grow too heavy for him too carry. Thinking they were so far from the spirit laud that tho ghosts could not find their way bach again, Speolyai lifted the lid find let them out. Thoy vanished immediately and re turned to the land of tho dead. Whai-a-mu. was much disappointed, but said whan tho buds opened iu the spring bo would try again; but tho coyote naid it was better to lot tlio dead remain whero they wero. Had not Speelyai opened the box, tho dead would now como to life avcry spring-, according to tho belief of those who put their faith in tbo legend.
