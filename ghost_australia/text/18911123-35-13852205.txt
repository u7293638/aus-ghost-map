A FRENDS CRITIC ON SAMLET. (From the Speaker.) A brilliant and somewhat audacious criticism of Hamlet has recently appeared in the columns of the Figaro from the pen of M Henri Bocquet. The critics have, M Becquo holds, failed in their analyses of the character of Hamlet, because they have port actually been searching for a consistency and a unity in which the character does not possess who have approached the subject psychologically Uko Goethe, comparatively like line, they have neglected the positive treatment u which would have led them to a sound conclusion Goethe s famous dictum was that the explanation of Hamlet lay in the effects of a great action imposed as a duty upon a mind too feeble for its accomplishment In this sciiBO he finds the character consistent throughout Taino explains Hamlet by saying Hamlet is Shakespeare hanson thus and thus would the man of Shakespeare's epoch haTo acted All is consistent if you take account of a given type of character biassed by the conditions of the age The specialists in lunacy explain him by inquiring whether there may not have been an hereditary tendency to beauty, and whether his pretended madness was not combined u with something of latent lun say Away with such subtleties ' cries M Booquo Let us consider facts, and call to mind that Shakespeare has not a psychologist, but a dramatist writing for the stage, timing more of his action than of his abstract personage When we have fully realised this, we shall understand Hamlet, inasmuch as we shall cease to demand a pj sociological couBiatoncj which the play cannot be made to read Shakespeare, as all the world knows, did not create Hamlet out of his own brain The Story of Amleth had been told by Saxo Grammaticus in the tin self the century, and had been worked up by Bolloforcst in his " Histoire Tragiques" in the sixteenth Shakespeare almost certainly had before him the old English version of Bolloforcst M Bccque s contention is that while Shakespeare has conceived in Hamlet a character adapt for carrying out a great revenge,, he has assigned to Hamlet a series of actions inconsistent with such a character, merely because the actions were those of the traditional Hamlet of the chronicles Shakespeare, M Becquo boldly says, is not master of his plot He is inventing here he is borrowing there and the in- ventions and the borrowings do not harmonise He substitutes the man of action of tradition and man of contemplation, but he leaves the action unnoticed in our wonder that Hamlet has been an enigma to pos- for by Why is Polonius slain ? It is so recorded in the chronicle Why does Hamlet depart to England and scheme the death of Rosencrantz and Guild on storm 1 It was part of the original story Hamlet has thus two faces, and the Hamlet of Shakespeare's creation finds himself responsible for crimes which are not his own Where the chronicle does not bias the action Hamlet is neither inconsistent nor enigmatic His attitude face to face with Claudius is perfectly intelligible He so far shrinks from killing him that the Ghost returns " to whet his almost blunted purpose," a reproach which still remains ineffective Murder is repugnant to Hamlet, revenge distasteful But the most important element introduced by the earlier tradition into the play was Hamlet's madness In the " II j stone of Hamlet ' ' his assumption of mad- ness is justified, in the play it is not When Hamlet rejoins Horatio and Marcellus after his interview with the Ghost ho proclaims his intention " to put an antic disposition on " but his reason for doing so is made clear neither to them nor to the audience, nor in the sequel is it easy to discover how the character of madman has contributed to his security 01 his red enge Nor is his madness even well coun- ters ted We hear much, see little of it in the " Hystono " ho " roads and tears his clothes, wallowing and lying in the dust and mire, his face all filthy a id blacks, running through the streets like a man distraught, not speaking one w order but such as seemed to proceed from madness " The plan contains nothing of this, and the audience would not know that he had carried out his declared intention of playing the madman except through the declara- tion of others, and especially Ophelia Yet how greatly Hamlet's assumption of madness, though not contributing to the accomplishment of his purpose, does contribute in other ways to the development of the plot is plain Shakespeare has not only adopted it, but he has made good use of it Hub madness, so much criticised and studied, is in M Becquo's view in major de theatre," a dramatic convenience without which the play could not go forward, and of a real element of madness in Hamlet there can be no question at all. if, however, our on the declines to accept a psychological solution of Hamlet as a whole, he is quite prepared with an analysis of that side of Hamlet which he traces to Shakespeare's brain-Hamlet the inactive dreamer Goethe quite wrongly sees in him one who would have been an excellent prince if he had not been overpowered by too heavy a burden. On the contrary, he has been a peevish, Iragilo child, and has grown up a misanthrope He represents a reaction from his father, the valiant warrior, and admires him to exaggeration because he lacks his strength His excellent fencing no doubt presents a difficulty for this view, but it is ingeniously suggested either that caprice has born him to cultivate one manly exercise, or that Shakespeare may have inconsistently given him this endowment to bring about the denouement of the piece The net of vengeance is not, as Goethe urged, above Hamlet's powers, but, fin de mere personage that he is, he does not in his heart of hearts think it worth carrying out He is really satisfied when he takes a rhetorical vengeance upon his mother His real heart is laid bare in the churchyard To this favour must we come at last, courtier, jester, conqueror, beauty. Thou, since to such cases uses " we must return, what is the good of effort P Hamlet is thus, to M Becquo, above all el- talker. He is the hero of a dramatic action, yet the action scarcely engrosses him at all He talks about everything love, literature, questions of the tune, questions of all time. He is for every ago the type of ineffectiveness, the ineffectiveness which can do nothing but decision in presence of evils He was created an Englishman, the Germans have claimed him as their own at. Rocque binds him to be a Frenchman, and one des - titled to have many successors
