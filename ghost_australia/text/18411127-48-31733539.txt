ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE MORE GHOSTS IN CAMPBELLTOWN. Mr Editor - Great alarm and sensation has been created in this village for the past week, arising from a report having been spread in all directions that some unusual noises were heard, at unseasonable hours, in an old house occupied by Messrs. Shields and Patrick, in which is conducted the butchering business. These parties have been obliged to leave the premises every night, in consequence of the rumbling noises heard all over the building, and take shelter in the adjoining houses. The building is a very old one, and now divided into many apartments, to suit the convenience of various parties who tenant them. It was the first house licensed in this district, many years ago, and known as the Harrow Inn, kept by the late Mr. John Patrick, who conducted business there successfully for many years. Rumours of this kind were circulated some time since, when a man named Baker resided there, but were not credited or listened to; but it is well known to the neighbours that it was principally owing to this cause that that individual quitted the premises. I have often heard him say he could not get one night's rest in a week from the rattling and tumbling heard aloft when the serial beings were conducting their midnight orgies. At all events, when the gentlemen of the School of Arts are again soliciting information to embellish their lectures on the subject of ghosts, no doubt the parties now annoyed will give every requisite information respecting the ghost of the Harrow, or Haunted Inn, Campbelltown.
