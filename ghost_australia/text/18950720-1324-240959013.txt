TtiE4fl£fiWyD AT RYL BT FLORENCE WA RDEN. [ALT/ J{IGHT3 RESERVED,"] X'AET 1.' It is a ]iiciuroi>qua :spoc, mat ancient town of llvo, whrn t:ie riror run* fall at the base pf the rock on Tvliioh-it stands;land -the little fishing feboais; jvitlr". -their r<-d-.l>ro\vn, patched pails, swim down on the tide to too eon. ]!ut when the tide has runoiit, and - the mud-bauke till t:ic river's bed in a long grey line to the now iliitaul sea, the old town,' wiib*. its jiarrott-, steep streets of; small, close-packed houses, crowned; w ilh the low i-qu'are tower of the cient church, looks desolate intctUj-- So thought Ned Maris-as, on a chilly November afternoon, he made his way slowly up into the town from the station, through a drizzle of rain which made the rough stones slippery, and pattered down from th-» overhanging eavos of the houses. T:iis wan his first visit to live, and he ri-viiicd -llkeiy - to get t>o - enthusiastic uclr.tine. lie had asked his wa.V I<J " the best inn,'' and having bi-cn l->1tl rather pointedly " that the priii'i/'<ti hotel was ' The Bull * in Higii-xiri'i't," perceixed that he had goiic^unar to wounding the - town's sui-ri-ii-iliili'i«-«, and that in losing it- i:<i[»uriuiice - it had not lost its j dignity. Ned was at least able* to than 1 : fst.-.-v however, that .."The -Bull-' hostelry, "re-erected with all inodorn ^improvements/.' tut a plain and by no^means'^extensive biiitding* which felly carried, out tlie promise ! hi'ld forth in its. advertisement jn ' the guide 3 book."- " This 'houss has for many years enjoyed the repute j of being clean, sweet, and corn-; fortable.". The very first steps he ( made along the narrow, entrance passage raised his spirits. A freshfaced countrywoman stood at the door t>f a room on the right; at the ] end of the passage he saw a cosy, | old-fashioned bar; a huge grand-1 iaitiei's clock ticked loudly some- j where iu the , dim recesses of oakpanelled passages in the background. I " Good-day," said he to the waitrc-s. ' Tfie"very fact "that there was no di^g^waiter^hoiit warmed one's soul.*...."Can. I .have, something to eat P" A chop, anything." I "YOB, sir. This way, if you. please, sir." she was quite peremptory in her manner aa..ske-diverted him from his purpose .of entering the room on the right, and insisted on his going into the coffee-room joa the left. Ned felt that she was too autocratic. For in that apartment, on the- right, 1 which bore., the words Commercial.; Room," and into .which, therefore, as! a public room, he had every right to - go, there was a big well filled book; c;i-e, «nd—a golden- haired girl. I Now Ned was an artist, and endowed, like other artists, with susceptibilities as golden hair .which made even a tinge of flaxen or! ;auburn a joy to him. The hair he had just seen made him long to getl at his palette ; he felt that he must 1 'see that girl, he must know her, he | must paint her if he had to stay in ! Rye six months to do it. Mean-j j while he was in the - tiny cofEeeroorr. waiting for his dinner, with ^nothing better than last week's local newspaper to amuse himself with, 'lie would go. and aBk the goldenr jhaircd young lady for a book. So .he crossed^the passage into the comimercialfiroom. 'i'lie girl, who jras sitting .close ondor. the . • bookcase. • studying a Volume open on her.knee, Rooked up. Something in her very glance showed | at once that sUd was adorably unused I Meeting, strangers. She was not J shy or awkward, but she was surpriced. , " If you want anything will you please ring the bell in the cofEeeroom^nd^the waiters will come/'' she said. \- • : I The words were a snub, but the grey eyes were kind.. Ned.retreated to the door, but.said hqmhlv— " I beg your pardon. j}ut I came to nsk if you would be kind enough to lend mo a book." " I am sure ,Mrs.. Richmond will. I'll go and ask her." Oh "dear, th'ig^was notvwhat he.had •waited at ail\ a portly landlady de-rejuding. ,-upQn him,. with open, suspicions as .-to the genuiness of his avidity for literature !

I've been here I ' The waitress, who was evidently -a j personage of importance in the inn, j with extensive powers, was melting, "t She advanced to the fire. fltirrfed theticoalB into a roaring blaze, and wheeled a chair round for the gentleman. Ned. took. his . seat with this back to the murky afternoon'. day-. | light, where he could from time-to time cast a slyly admiring~glattCB~aty the demure young girl in the corner. ~ " Well," Martha began, " we don't ; always 'caH ;J them'«iurdBr8.' For to say truth, they were more than murders- fi- -they t,,. were -i - mystw^egi y There's a couple ef very houses in Rye that ware fince an Inn, called •The Mermaid.' That was long before my .time. When I first came the to Bye the place kadbeen empty and neglected, and all to pieces "for nigh on two years. Then it was done up and divided into, two houses,;for it was too big for anyone about here to take as it was. And one house was taken . by a shoemaker, a most -respectable- -man, ,-with .* wife :0,nd„ house didn't go off for a bit, and Wtlast they turned it into—a - hospital, But one night—it was about Christmas time, I remember, aad the Ticar preached about it, and it cast a-damp over everything—a poor man 'that, -was lying in one of the rooms with a broken leg, shrieked out for help, Before the nurse that was in charge conld get to the room, however, the poor fellow was dead. It was fonnd that he had been choked by a great piece of plaster like that they do ceilings with. The question ; Who had done it? There, waa nobody - about the house except the nurse, and a woman lying in another room, who was paralysed, and could not leave her bed. . Then again, where did the plaster come from ? There was no ceiling to any one of the rooms; the timbers were jUBt whitewashed,'ind there was 'no plastarrused, so the piece found in his throat could not have fallen from the roof, in to his month while he slept, as someone suggested, Well, it was a mystery, and -there -was an end of it, at least, eo we thought. Then- that' ..room via, not used again for a long time. But in October of the year after there was a great storm, and a shipwrecked crew- of « fishing smack were bronght into Eye. There being nobody in the hospital aiktthaj time, the popr felio,wa were ;put up there. . You eee,4hey. were strangers,, and had never heftrd the,story. . Just picture to,yourseUE~what we: all felt next dav when we found that one of the men .had. died.iin the .night in exactly the same way as the first, There were.two other, men sleeping in the .room,.who.:pvere wakened ;bv hearing their comrade choking and gasping for -ljreath. .. They .conld just see him in the darkness, so they said, struggling with a woman,in^black,, who waved her arms about; over him and disappeared, leaving him stark dead. Never was such a senq^Jipp, known in,Bye before or;eince.r The, place was haunted, so everyone said. It was a curious, thing .though,.if it -was a ghost, that did these tnnrders, that« purse which the Bailor had by his pillow, and which held two sovereigns, had disappeared. Of course one pf his .companions, may have stolen it; but then-it was thev.i -who gave „the information , that, he had ;this money upon him. Then the poor people next door were suspected, because the attic over the hospital was part of their premises, being used by the shoemaker as jb. Btore- place. JJut besides that he and 1.: hid . family were known I. ' to be V 'v honest ••' * 1 and as harmless as doves, there, was j no way by which any human being 1 could force himself between the rafters. So there the matter ended, 1 and I don't suppose the house will ever,let again.!'

Ned. listened to . these .. noises,... and to the pattering-of the rain on the latticed panes, and. wondered whether the street was., always as emptyjand deserted as it iseemed to bet; to-night. He had thought he should be so cosy in the wide chimpcj-jcorner. but jnstead he found it draughty enough to make his hair stand on end. At last he got up, jand for the first time made a tour/of the premises. There were fonrrooms, two upBtairs and two on the ground floor. His sitting, room was the only one that contained a fireplace, and only two out .of the four .could be called furnished. There, was no garden, but there was an untidy.yard with a huge rain ;tub at the back of the house. The fesling that there was some-, .thing .gruesome,- about . the place . grew stronger upon him as he ^passed frojp. j the tone to the other of the upper rooms and heard the wind howling above him. There must surely be an attic overhead, he thought, for the -wind to make, thatnoise! And then he remembered that he had seen from the street the .window of a second >.storey—the one 'with the gable*, But where was the way up into the sttic ? There was no staircase, . no ladder.
