Orthodoxy in. an Infidel's Creed. Colssel In3Ersoll is well-known as one of the leading spirits among the infidel party in America. The following witty and amus ing comments on some of the expressions contained in IugerBoll's latest lecture, ' What must we do to be Baved,' are from a tract by W. J. Burdett, and noticed in the Christian Guardian. The Guardian says : — We nave read tho tract and we have read the entire lecture. If this is truly Inger soll'a creed, the colonel isn't so for out of the way. He is coming round, mayhe. He manages to get considerable Scripture into his creed, as he sets it forth. There is lots of hope, in fact, there is a great deal of cer tainty for the colonel. We subjoin a few articles of this great man's creed just to show from what book he : gets his declaration of faith. ' ' Honest industry is as good aa pious idleness,' saya She colonel. ! Well, that's all right. That's orthodox. The Bible says the same' thing, and said it long before the colonel thought of it—' Faith without works is dead.' ' Christ believed tho temple of God to be the heart of man.' — IngeraoU. Yes, that's orthodox, too. We ' must worship Him in the spirit.' ' Knew ve not that ye are the temple of the Holy Ghost J' 'If I go to heaven I want to take my reason with me.' — Ingersoll. Of course, and so you will, . ' for now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face ; now I know in part, but then I shall know even as T am known.'— Corinlkiaiia' ziii. 12. ' ' ? ? ' ?
