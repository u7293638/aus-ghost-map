ENTERTAINMENT IN AID OF ST. JAMES'S FAIR. A capital entertainment was given in St. James's Hall, Forest Lodge, on Tuesday evening last, in aid of the funds of St. James's Fair. There were about 500 people present, and an excellent programme of songs and step- dancing, with the laughable farce of 'The Ghost in the Pawnshop,' were given. A profit of about Â£20 was made. All the performers and Messrs. T, J. Searle, G. Russell, and Signor R. Carini deserve great credit for the manner in which the affair was carried out.
