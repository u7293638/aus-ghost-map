Whilst O'MalIey was talking' Stanley nod 'Stratgway exchanged tmeatling glances, and the formter at length said.t "I)o you remenlrer'wlat we saw i In the c:avern, Strangway ?

I "It was no inttginatir'n, as you will t learn," continuted C) alley. " I-low long I rermaitned in that swoon I never f knoew, but it mitst have lcbeen a long I time and thle perlid wai an utterlrlank t to me. V'hen I recovered I was con scious that an extraordinary change t ha'l taken place itn my condition. I " At first in the tweakness of my state I thloughlt I must be in that other world Ibeyond the grave tof which we know so s little, but Ifrom which there is no re- t turn." " You were not there, it is quite cer- I tain ?" interjected the sqlu:atter. " No; but I vwas in a world almtost- It if not quite - as strtange to us as - the tunscen spheres of spirits, and since that awakening I have been dis- t iossed to fully believe, the saying, that tlhere are more tlhings in heaven and earth tlhan is dreamt of in our philorsophly. I Ihave iproved that the r secrets of tihe earth at least are sealed i to trhumanity irn nume-rous wrays. "'liThe light which surrounded me first attracted attention. It wans not I sunrltght or nmoonlight I knew, btut I I could not definic it; it was soft and I bablry and filled me with a sense of r plrofournd calm. I next found, with t socmething of wonder and gratitude, I that tihe fearfrul pain lwhich had Ipre viously aflicted ince had disaippeared. I I involuntarily raised my hand to my t slhoulder to feel if the bIroken spear I was there, but ftound, to my inftnite re- I lief, that it was not, but in its pilace wsas a soft basndage. Their as sty senses fully awetke 1 began to narrowly scanr tihe surrourndings. 'ihe coulch I was ) ing on felit remarkablly comifortable, and I noticed Ithat it was as soft and spingy as an air-lied. I could not examine it at thIe tine, but later on 1 did so and was surprised at tihe in grrnuity with which it %s as constructed. "(;Glancing round, tihe size of tIhe chlatmbr trext demtanderl attention. It seenmed to Ie limnitlcss and lorroked as though I was lvinrg in the oren air, yet I well knew it was not so. I could see tranrslucentt Ieams atnd siheets rf soft radiance in every diirecitrn, trn& tilhe roof rrof tihe cla:rrrLr iappeared to reach tihe sky. 1. afterswarld founld out this I was only an opticnal illut:b,nr but one that had a r'aterial olbject in view and rendered immenrrse service to those who carried it out. My eyes rquickly be camre accustormed to tihe strange light, and then I noticed that I was the only occupant of the vast chamtber. "I risht as well here exsplain tlhat thie place was not by any nucars vast but onrly made to ntlrar so, and though simply done tihe effect both material and aestheticr was excellent. " When I began to recover I saw that the r!ac:.s was really an ovls cavern not tmore thanr forty feet in its -longest mreasurcmrens. The roof sas about the samre Ireight, but, I can astsure you, that a pers :n lying on Iris back on a Iplain and lookinrt up at the vault of iheaven wouli tnt believe the latter to be larger than I did the chamber in which. I areoke to consciousness. \\\'ith little effnrt--a fact that suiprised tre even then-1- grit up on my etbow. and peered around. "T'he place was absolrtely tenantless save by miyself and I marvelled at it. My woiuncs felt as though almtost retrled and then it occurred to re thlat I must have beern weeks in tihe unconscious state. I Welil knew that unlessi I was under tihe spell of some ragnician, or in tihe hands of a wondelltll scientist sk:lled in tihe use of drowsy her bs, suchl nepenthe could not have come to i c." "And rmay I ask you," int.rrupted Mfills, "ifyou tad been it'an uncon scions, state for long ? Did you ever find that out ?"' `\'es. .Later on I discovered that I i was nearly' six weeks in at rance, or rather it could not be called a trance condition; for though sty brain was asleep my Ibodily frnctions continued S-and, it. fact, when my rmenrtal and t nervou.s faculties awoke I wats almost cured of my terrible injuries." "ishat is a irast extraordinary thirng," tihe squatter again said. " Yet it is absolutely true, as you will I rene," contirsseid O'ilailey. "After lorking rorund the chramnssr for some muinutes, I lay rack on tny couctr and blegars to shink the matter over.

" When I again c.tne to mry senses I felt stronger anrd my faculties were on the alert. As before I was alone, but the clhambler was no:v somewhlat .tmi liar to ore and I Ibegan to discern that it was something like a cavern or anr oval room so arrarged witih mirrors that it extended itito inliniity. 1 sat up on the side of thIe couch whlichl I found was set upon legs and sides of white rock. WVith an effort I tried to stand, but was so giddy that I was fain to seek the aid of the couch.

"The fearfuil journey to thIe side of the strange river lwhere the seterfall was, rose in my mindil, and then tihe scene in the cavern with the natives dancing arnd gesticulating around me were conjured up.
