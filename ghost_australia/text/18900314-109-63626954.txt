ONE WAY TO DETECT A THIEF. "I'll tell you bow I ran down a thief o cently," said the man in the Lewiston police station. I lost SOdol. in money. I did not sa a wond. Idid not even tell my wife. I hardly told myself. The other day, two sears after the ocacrrence, a woman in my tneighbour. hood said: ' By the way, did you rver ind out who stole your SOdol.' I looked her in the face and said. " I never had until just this minute.' She tmrned as pale as a ghost, and the result was that she paid me SOdol. and interest on the same for two years."
