ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. To the Editors of the Sydney Morning Herald. GENTLEMEN, It I may say so without too much presumption, it appears to me that both the clerical and lay agitators have entered upon the religious discussion of the state of the English Church in this and the other colonies without reflecting what its true principles are first, because those principles may have fallen into disuse and secondly because the laity have not had their attention called to the fact by the watchmen duly appointed to look after these things and which I hope to lay briefly before your readers First and prominent in this discussion is the Bishops Minutes of Conference, in October, 1850, and after a careful reading of them that) strike me as only a notification, that as Bishops, however unworthily they may act up to in practice, or in their daily walk, they free) acknowledge as strangers to each other, they were willing to be bound by their orders turn vows-in the discussions on Church, matters that came before them And this I must say was a fortunate circumstance for the English Church, for we know that many pre letters and clergymen have acted in opposition to them, because of things in general in the Church having been disused Had they been content to found their future labours upon this standard, I think it would have been prudent and wise, but they, like all other men, past and to come in their proceedings net as if it were only their arm that could succour the the ark of God and hence they agree it was necessary the Government and constitution of the I English Church required alteration in the colonies, and which could only be done eccle- siastically through the medium of provincial meetings This was desired of the authorities h the Mother Church in London, with what result the colonial public has not been favoured Then admission that a portion (or branch) of the government of the English Church required alteration, was, in my humble opinion, fatal to the quiet working of its body, because it struck me that if the clergy could in this act so far dispense with their vows of office and faith in it, the restless spirits in the laity reasonably might be excused for trying their hand also at innovations and amendments, both parties for- getting that if changes were required in the Church it could only be effected by a Council of all the Bishops of the English Church, at whatever distance met together, as in ancient times , and permission of the constituted authorities This simple rule seems to have been wholly forgotten and hence all the unseemly sights the members of the Church see occurring in Adelaide, Melbourne, Tasmania, and in this metropolis Could they not have recollected St Paul s words wherein in those days many were inclined to say, I am of Paul, I am of Apollos, etc The discussion is further hampered by the well known fact, that the Arch) bishop of Canterbury and' his followers are very averse to any p., medical meeting, much n "s -i 3 provincial meeting -of the principles of the English Church are plainly as Sweden its Beliefs, its Rubrics, Articles and Canons, and Ordination Services And I challenge any one to point out wherein they infringe upon the liberty of either clergy or laity I find that no Bishop can in- interpose his authority, unless the laity, through their churchwardens, make a presentment to him, and that when thus put in motion he is compelled to give punishment early as the Canons point out, and which is mine ely directed I find, further, that every parish is given over to the care of the incumbent and church wardens, who have the sole charge of collect as the aims and other devotions of the people, and their appropriation and that, should no disagreements take place between them, the Bishop may only be reminded of its existence from the annual returns made to him of the number of baptisms, births, marriages, deaths, and communicants, unless as is wisely provided in case of disputes he is made referee and judge No one can be admitted to the office of a deacon or priest without the con sent of the laity given openly Now, gentlemen, such being the principles of the Church, I ask, exultingly, can the labours of a Darvall, a Sadleir or a Piddington, lay down a greater Jaw of liberty a It does not surprise me that the constitution is so perfect, because I am sure i It was founded and arranged in much more troublesome times than these I will not leave the subject without remarked Jig upon the danger these new learned doctors (and I was going to add divines - for one of the three was refused ordination both by the "shops of Sydney and Melbourne) would create if this right of private judgment were, allowed. We should have persons within the Church holding the doctrine of the Godhead of our Saviour in dension, receiving the Apostolical commission to preach the gospel, not believing either the 36th Article, or the words of ordination, " Receive ye the Holy Ghost," &c.; receiving the bread and wine, and believing them to be visible flesh and blood; all this, so opposite and distressing to many minds, would be tolerated. Would it, do you ' think, produce peace, ye doctors ? , Wisely has the English Church shut the door against such heresies, by the declaration in its 20th and 33rd articles. Instead therefore of the Bishop of Tasmania being attacked for his adherence to Scripture in this matter, he deserves praise more than man can give him. The same arguments used at the meeting on Tuesday, as to the position of Her Majesty, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, are used by the Romanists in appealing solely to the Bishop of Rome and also the meaning of St. James' decision is clung to by Romanists to show unity can only be with St. Peter ! so that in whatever way you look at the labour of these | lay gentlemen, it is in direct contradiction to the free spirit of liberty contended for by the fathers of the English Church. All this they it will not admit, vividly bringing to my mind the words of our Saviour-" If they believe not Moses and the Prophets neither will they i ? believe though one rose from the dead." These sentiments are put forward in hopes I the clergy and laity will survey and examine I j calmly the position of the English Church, so that in this rich colony faithful men may be found to rally round its altar and in defence ! of its principles principles which were main | tained at the cost of much precious blood and a treasure by their forefathers - and which it should be the honour of Australians to hand down unimpeached to their children's children. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully. AN AUSTRALIAN CHURCHMAN. Sydney, Ascension Day, 1852.
