" Briseis," " Hiffhland Cousins," is, &c.; (COPYRIGHT.) SYNOPSIS OF PREVIOUS CHAPTERS. CHAPTERS I. and II -The quiet sanctity of the Sabbath morn at Kinvaig. House, near the Narva River, is broken by the noisy hilarity of its present owner, the Marquess of Mountmahon, a besotted loaf, who has come into possession of the estates, married a music-hall singer, and turned the quiet vale into a Pandemonium. Angus Macdonald, an old servant, is dismissed because he declines to fetch his lordship's fishing-rod. An orgie follows on the lawn, taken part in by the lord and his rowdy companions, whilst professional prize- fighters are kept at the village inn to amuse the ladies and gentlemen at the house. Whilst they are in the height of their revelry two strangers, a father and son, appear on the scene. They are no less than old Allan Macdonald and his son, Somerled Macdonald, who have come from Kinvaig, un- tarts, Canada, to visit the old man's native heather. The father is blind with age. Angus, the fisherman, who was dismissed by the new lord is taken under the shelter of Somerled, who undertakes to find a new home for him. An insult offered to the old man by one of the motley crowd Is resented by Some red, who doubles a prizefighter up into the road, and the pair, with old Angus, drive off. CHAPTER III. "So young, my Lord, and True." I am good, I am beautiful, and I am modest," said Wild Eelin, entering the room, but it is a cruel and a wicked world, and I am not appreciated." She took the big, black, green-eyed tomcat from her shoulder, and threw it on to a couch. " Beelzebub, if you have no further news for me from the place below, I have no further use for you show away, impostor I" And then she turned to her mother, who was reading a newspaper. " Mother, I am going into the town; do you want anything sent out ?" She was a young girl of about nineteen or twenty, hardly over middle height, of slim and graceful figure, and of unmistakably Highland aspect Highland in the clear whiteness of her skin that had rather over than under its due of rose-leaf that in the cheeks, but above all Highland in her large, liquid, lustrous, deep-blue eyes that set about with their dark eyelashes, were of a quite indescribable loveliness they seemed to suggest somehow the wild and strange beauty of a moonlight night at sea. Perhaps her straight nose and full and finely-cut mouth might have lent something imperative and commanding to her appearance ; but she was not quite tall enough for that a besides she was young younger even than her years and then again her general expression seemed to say of her that her heart was wholly rippling over with laughter, and frollosomeness, and the abundant delight of living. With three or four inches added to her stature, and with a dozen years added to her age, she might have posed as a sibyl ; as things were-well, she was just Wild Eelin, as her companions often called her, though her Gaelic-speaking friends had a finer name for her than that to them she was "Edin of the sea-blue eyes." For the rest she was dressed with extreme simplicity and neatness her blouse being of the Macdonald tartan and the circular silver brooch she wore at her neck was not set with any precious stones ; it merely had these three words engraved on it, "The Eagle's Crag which is the slogan of the 'Macdonalds of Kinvaig. ยก Her mother glanced upward from the paper. She was a slight, silver-haired, sweet-voiced lady, who mayhap looked all the more fragile, and delicate, and timid in contrast with the roster colour and brave demeanour of her daughter. Really, Eelin," she said, in almost piteous tones, " I must protest-" " What is it now, another " I have just been reading the last of these White Cockade articles. Really really, Eelin, you don't seem to know the lengths you're going. Why, you are openly making love to this young man !" "He is not a young man, mother, she responded, with much placidity. " He is a phantom-a ghost-a wander dug voice ! I have not even seen him in dreams ; I meet him only in the columns of the Inverglen 'Observer,' published every Saturday, price one penny." " You don't appear to understand I" remonstrated the anxious mother. " Behind all this farrago of moonlight walks, and pretended correspondence, and assignations, there is an actual person and you have no means of knowing who or what that person may be." " An actual person a common and ordinary person why, mother, he's not a person at all-he's a poet ! And you want me to stop giving him that little bit of encouragement and approval for which every poet pines I How can you be so cruel ! And another thing, look at the consequences of suppressing a poet ! Have you ever thought of the awful consequences of suppressing a poet ? He might burst 1" " I dare say he knows perfectly well who you are, if you don't know who he is," continued the mother ; " and sooner or later there will be an introduction, brought about by somebody there is always that possibility and then what will you have to say For answer the young lady walked up to a large scroll framed and hung on the wall-a genealogical tree, with its wide-spreading branches dotted all over with white circular spots like so many sixpenny bits and with her forefinger pointing, she began at the base of the system, proceeding gradually upwards, and proudly naming one name after another. i - " Somerled, Thane of Argyle : married the daughter of the King of the Ie'es Reginald, King of the Isles-Donald, Lord of the Isles, 1214 Angus, Lord of the Isles-Alexander, Lord of the Isles Angus, Lord of the Isles Angus Og, Lord of the Isles John, Lord of the Isles-Ranald of Dunluce-Eneas Gorm Macdonald of Kinvaig-Donald Macdonald of Kinvaig-Alasdair Glas Macdonald of Kinvig Lewis Macdonald of Kinvaig-Somerled Macdonald of Kinvaig-Ranald John Macdonald of Kinvig and more and more and all of them km and six to Kinlochinol dart, and Keppoch, and Glencoe, and Glengarry and you ask me, their de- scendant, to be afraid of meeting face to face some young divinity student some lawyer's clerk-some town coun- cillor"s son-whatever or whoever he may be I You forget, mother. If I am not . the daughter of a hundred Earls,' I am the daughter of a thousand Thames and by the Red Book of Clan Ranald I fear no mortal man ร" She dropped her heroics. " Mummie, darling, the fact is, you are a hen with only one chicks and you keep cluck-clucking when there's no danger about at all. I don't see the slightest chance of my ever meeting this young gentleman who writes the pretty verses. They'll keep my secret safe enough at the ' Observer' office. And even if I were to meet him some day, what would happen ? I have a small grain of common sense. I'm not nearly such a fool as I look. So you get rid of all that unnecessary alarm, my dear, sweet, excellent mother; and tell me what you want ordered m Invemish, for I've a lot of things to do before dinner-time." And thus it was that a little while thereafter Miss Eelin Macdonald of Kinvaig (alas ! there now remained to them nothing of Kinvaig save the style and title accorded them in courtesy by friends and neighbours was marching briskly along the banks of the wide and full flowing river, on this still and peaceful and golden August afternoon. She crossed the vibrating suspension bridge; she continued her way by the side of the stream ; then she climbed the steep Castle Hill, and had a casual look round at the distant mountain ranges, from the ethereal Mealfourvonie in the south to the darker Ben Wyvis in the north ; and finally she went on and into the town, to execute her mother's commissions. But when these had all been got through, she found herself (as she had planned) with a little time on her own; and so, to begin with, she went into a small grocer's shop. " A pound of tea, Mrs. Fordyce, and two pounds of sugar and as quick as you can please, for I'm rather in a hurry." The big, buxom, good-natured looking woman behind the counter seemed more inclined to pause and have a chat with Miss Eelin than to despatch her business and so she had again to be urged. " And how much will that come to ?" " One and eightpence, if ye please, Miss Eelin." The girl took out her purse, and searched all through it. " Dear me," she said, " how stupid ! I have only got one-and-sixpence-half penny with me. You'll just have to take out some of the tea, Mrs. Fordyce." " I'm sure you'll not be wanting to affront nie. Miss Eelin," said the big, soft featured woman, who appeared to be of a sensitive temperament " When you know that anything in the stop is at your service-and no question of money at all !" "Well, well, Mrs. Fordyce," said the young lady, blithely, " if you carry on your shop on sentimental principles of that kind, I wonder how long you'll have a roof over your head. But I'll owe you the three-halfpence I won't ask you to open the packet-for I want to get along at once to old Granny Sinclair." , " Ay, I thought it was something of that kind," said Mrs. Fordyce, with a smile. " And you'll just owe me the three-halfpence until I ask you for it, Miss- Eelin." Miss Eelin now left the shop, went quickly along to another thoroughfare, passed up a narrow entry, ascended a stair, and knocked at a door and opened it Apparently she knew her way well, for the next minute found her in a small and rather dusky room, the sole occupant of which was a shrivelled, 'little, old woman, who lay huddled up in a dilapidated rocking-chair. The window at which she sate looked out upon a courtyard above the high wall of which some rowan trees and poplars showed- their sunlit foliage almost motionless against the flecked blue and white of the sky ; but she was not regarding these ; she had been helplessly staring at her brown and bony fingers, clasped in her lap, until the arrival of this visitor had suddenly aroused her attention. (To be continued.) An amusing complication has just arisen in England over the rather striking title of "The Veiled Man." A few weeks ago Messrs. Pearson, Limited, announced " The Veiled Man," by Mr. Owen Rboscomyl, and not until the book had gone to press did they discover that Mr. William Le Queux had already obtained a right in the title, has " The Veiled Man" having been running serially in "The Idler'.' since October. In these circumstances Messrs. Pearson at once altered their new book to " The Shrouded Face." under which title It will now be Issued. . '
