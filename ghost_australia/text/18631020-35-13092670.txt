The honorable and gallant gentleman has therefore, been unfairly dealt with, and through him a 1 we of the old regime feel ourselves to have been hardly treated Alas for it' gentlemen must still remain under a cloud, retire humbly into their corner, and make way for political nondescripts of ever) kind And let me ask you, what the honorable member for Canterbury I mean the big one-was dying, driving about town in his best black broadcloth, and with a servant behind him, if he had not been led to expect that he would be sent for, Somehow or some where, or by some one there has been some base underhand work going on in some direction or other That honorable and port). member does not often come out in that etc 16, and did not show up the other day for nothing What MIO trickery was practised on him that he should have been can led to trot himself out in that many or All these are matters that must be. full) cleared up when the minister explorations come to be given To us it matters little who are in or who are out We are sure to get a little extra stirring up when new men come in T) e new broom goes into all the corners and takes up events ing, kicking up a good deal of dust, but de ing the work cleaner and smarter , yet it soon wears down, pokes less and less into corners leaves a little behind here and there, until by degrees we deep into the old jog trot style and go along as quietly and as easily as ever There is also a good deal of this sweeping process done by Ministries when going out of office, but then the difference is that they have to clear up the dirt that they themselves have accumulated round them during their tenure of office The amount of ashes that are taken out of the Ministerial grates prior to the vacation of the bureaux, would somewhat astonish the uninitiated , whilst if the incoming gentlemen could only read in the blackened ashes the secrets that have been consigned to oblivion, they would be able to see the explanation of very many things hitherto incompre sensible to them. Do you know I had some notion that there was a great difficulty impending over the late Ministry than they were themselves inclined to believe. Mind you, I do not wish to set up as a prophet I do not pretend to that character in any way I have air. nely confessed that the defeat came upon me as well as others quite unexpectedly ; but I say again that I thought a serious difficulty overhung the Ministry, and for this reason : the window near which I sit cerno auds a view of the head department of the Government, and in the intervals of' labour I have the habit of refreshing myself by a look-out upon the bright sunshine not, of course, with any idea of watching what is going on in the other department certainly not but merely to rest the eye, tired of the weary waste of paper over which it has to travel. On the morning of the day in which the fatal division came off I chanced to look accidentally over to the Chief Secretary's office several times, and upon two separate occasions I saw three different members of the Assembly enter the building. At the lunch hour I met my friend Muffin that is not his knife, but we call him Mullins -why, I do not know, but I think it is owing to some former partiality he, displayed for that peculiarly unwholesome edible. We are in the habit of comparing notes. He sits near a chimney which, running up the wall of the Chief's room, has peculiar acoustic properties that I need not further allude to. I mentioned to him the names of those I had seen at. ter. "That accounts for it," he answered; I. I heard something that I could not make head or tail of. They didn't Hand in the light position when they were speaking. Something was asked for and refused ; and then I distinctly heard, "Vote against you," at of the answer " Do so." We both thought there was something ominous in this, for where a Government that has so long maintained itself by little graceful official douceur to those who have supported it in the time of need, suddenly- become s virtuous, there is reason to fear the result of the change. Be it makes known his approach by some peculiar innate perception, as well to political as to physical life. Thus when we fro the reprobate suddenly turned s that we come to the conclusion that a higher hand than that of man is on him preparing him for the dark and unknown way. So, also, when a reprobate Government assumed witty. cut M anning a vii tea that none ever suspected them of poBtcsehg, we cannot help setting in it the finger of destiny pointing to the ministerial rapid fortune, lit sit nation. Without going farther on this point, I may add, that the names of the three honorable gen . shearer who that morning visited the Chief Secretary appeared in the division lists of the following data as voting against the Government. Bid the honorable Premier know that he was sign- ing his ministerial death warrant by his cavalier treatment of the suitors, or was he desirous of letting his last public act be one of Roman virtue ; or was he called by his whipper-in, and suffered for the name local miscalculation that has always been so fatal to his Government ; or was he For) ing upon the casting vote, of which gratitude should have ensured him the possession ? That casting vote was one that he himself had made such and he could hardly have reckoned upon its being used against him. Well may he, like Cleaner, have bowed to fate when this, " live up kindest cut of all," came from a hand which he himself had armed. He saw like Cresser also, that nothing was left him but Resignation ; but I had no doubt that in his heart hearts he thanked the Parts that the office was not, as he would have had it, made perennial instead of annual, and that there still remains a chance of vengeance. Respectfully yours, THEODORE AURELIUS MIDGE.
