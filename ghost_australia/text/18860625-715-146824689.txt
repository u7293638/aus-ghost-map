The fteath'^f Miniielialia »• [By H. W. Longfellow, 1807-1883.] O the long and dreary Winter! O the cold and cruel Winter 1 Ever thicker, thicker, thicker Froze the ice oh lake and river, Ever deeper, deeper, deeper / Fell the snow o'er all the landscape, Fell the "covering snow, and drifted -- Through the forest, round the village, r-:- -Hardly from his buried wigwam Could tire hunter force a passage; With his mittens and his snow-shoes ., Vainly walked he through the forest, Sought for biid or beast and found none, Saw no track of deer or rabbit, - Tin the snow beheld no footprints, In the ghastly, gleaming forest, Feil, and could not rise-frotn weakness,J JPeriBlied there 1 romcdid and hungeri - \- t jO-the famine and the fever!- i O the wasting of-the-farninrr! ~~— 0 the blasting of the fever! iOithte wailing ofthfefchUdieni!--' ~ 0 the anguish of the woment| ^ ^All the earth ;was-sick and fami^faedf •Hungry was the air around them, " ^ ■TT«mCTiy WaS"th^B~Sky""a"bt)Ve thfeffi AiRd-the hungry sta^p;^eayen" ^ Likes tlie » eyesv of -.wolves" glared at,j ■ ^-tbem-l~ - - _ Into. Hiawatha's wigwam Came two other guests, as silent "As the ghosts were, and as gloomy, Waited not to be invited, Did not parley at the doorway, Sat there without a word of welcome In the seat of Laughing Water ; Looked with haggard eyes 'and hollow At the face of I^ugffipAWater And the foretopst said,■' Beliold me! 1 am Famine, BuckadaWin!" " c ] And the other Said, ""Beholdine I' "'"1 v I am FeVer, Ahkosewin.l" v And;tbe lonely Minnehaha Shuddered as they, looked upon her, Shuddered at. the words they uttered, Lay down on her bed in silence, _ Hid her face but made no answer; Lay there "trembling, freezing, burning At the looks they cast upon her, At the fearful words they uttered. Forth into the empty forest Rushed ,the maddened Hiawatha ; In his heart was deadly sorrow, In his face a stony firmness ; On his bt-ow the sweat of angdish Started, but it froze, and fell not. Wrapped -in furs, and armed. , for bunting, With his mighty bow of ash-tree, With his quiver full of arrows, With his mittens, Minjekahwun, Into the vast and vacant forest On his snow shoes trod he forward. " Gitche Monito, the Mighty 1" Cried he with his face uplifted I In that bitter hour of anguish, " Give your children food, O father! Give us food; or we must perish ! Give me "food for- Minn^iaha, - ■ - For my dyiftg- Minriehaha !" - - - Through the far resounding: forest, Through the forest vast and vhcant, Rang that cry of desolation. But there came no other answer Than the echo of his crying, Than the echo of the woodlands, " Minnehaha! Minnehaha 1" All day long roved Hiawatha In that melancholy forest, Through the shadow of whose thicket In the pleasant days of Summer, 40f"that ne'erfovgotten-Snmmerr'r* ; He hird^rbt^^his^ymm^wifefbome^ i "ward," • t ~ "i"*u * H From the lancPbf The'DaeofabsfY* Wfiengf^bj^g^ngRi 3;h^ thickets/ Apid the streamlet laughed and glis ; tened, ^ : - -- ; ^ And the air was Full ofiragance, AncMhe lovely Laughing Water Said/ with vo1ce0thatdid notTtremble, -*«:I will follow you, my husband 1" Inlhewig^amw With_those gloomy guests that watched ; her, With the Famine aud^the.Fever, * < She was lying, the Beloved,;. : She, the dying Minnehaha. — ; " Hark !'' she said, " I" hear a rush-. •' N" ' Heap a.rqaiing and a rushing, Hear the Fails of Mitmebaha Calling toime from adistancej". ■ i i " No, mychild said old Nokomis,.

And at night a fire was lighted, On her grave four times was killed, For her soul upon her journey To the Islands of the blessed. From his doorway Hiawatha Saw it burning iu the forest, Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks; From his sleepless bed uprising, From the bed of Minnehaha, Stood and watched at the doorway, That it might not be extinguished, Might not hear her in the darkness. " Farewell," said he, ** Minnehaha 1 Farewell, Oh my Laughing Water! All my heart is buried with you 1 All .my . thoughts go onward with you, Come not-back again to labor, Come not back again to suffer, Where the Famine and the Fever Wear the heart and waste the body. ' Soon my task will be completed, Soon your footsteps I shall follow | To the Islands of the Blessed, To the Kingdom of Ponemah 1 To the Land of the Heieafter 1"
