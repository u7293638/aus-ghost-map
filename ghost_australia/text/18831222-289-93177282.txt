Where are the; gone, those dear dead days, Those sweet past days of long ago, tFbose ghosts go floating to and fro When evening leads us through her naze Where are they gone? Ah I who can t?ll ? Who -weave once more that long-passed spell 2 Jbey did exist when we were young. We Jnet cut life -with strength and trust; We deemed an things were pure and just, Nor knew life had a double tongue. We lightly sang a happy song. Nor dreamedonr way could e er be wrong. And then all changed; as life went by The friend deceived, or bitter Death ? Smiled as he drank onr dear one's breath, And would not let us also die. Day followed day ; as on they went Sack took some gift that life had sent. Tetftwas onro, that perfect past 1 We did have days that knew not pain. We once had friends death had not ta'en, And flowers and songs that could not last Were ours in that most blessed time, When earth seemed Heaven's enchanted (dims. And so I thins;, when lights horn low, And all the house is fast asleep* From cut a Eflence vast and deep Those dear dead days we worshipped so Breathe on us from their hidden store Their long-lost peace, their faith once more, God keep those dear old times ; ah me ! Beyond onr vision they may rest 301 on some perfect day and blest Once more those dear dead days will be. For death, who took all, may restore The past v. e loved to us once more.
