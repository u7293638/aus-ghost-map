FROM TIDEWAY TO TIDEWAY. .-? BY RUDYARD KIPLING. It is not easy to escape from a big city, An entire continent was waiting to be to reversed, and for that reason we lingered in New York till the city felt so homelike, that it seemed wrong to leave it. And further, the more one studied it the more grotesquely bad it grew and in its paving, and in its streets, and High street police, and but for the kindness of the tides would be worse than bad in its sanitary arrangements No one as yet has approached the management of every work in a proper spirit, that is to say, regarding it as the shiftless outcome of squalid barbarism and reckless extravagance No one is likely to do so because reflections on the long, narrow pig trough are construed as malet event attacks against the spirit and majesty of the great American people, and lead to angry comparisons Yet, if all the streets of London were permanently up and all the lamps permanently down this would not prevent the New York streets token ma lump from being first cousins to a timber foreshore, or kin to the approaches of a Kaffir kraal Gullies, looks, ruts, cobblestones awry, kerbstones rising from two to six. inches above the level of the Blatternlj pavement, tram lines from two to three inches above street let els, building materials scattered half across the street, line, boards, cut stone, and ash barrels generally andgenerouslvan} where , wheeled traffic taking its chances, dray venus brougham, at cross roads, sway backed poles whittle and appointed, drunken lamp posts with twisted irons and lastly, a generous scatter of filth, and more mixed strike than the winter wind can carry away, are matters which can be considered. quite apart from the "spirit of democracy for the future of this great and growing country in any other land they would be held to represent slovenliness, sordidness, and want of capacity Here it is explained, not once but many times, that they show the speed at which the city is grown, and the culpable indifference of her citizens to matters of detail One of these days, you are told, of anything will be taken in hand and put straight the unctuous rulers of the city will be swept away by a cyclone or a tornado, of something big and booming, of popular indignation, every body will unanimously elect the right men who will justly earn the enormous salaries that are at present being paid to inadequate aliens for road sw keeping, and all will be held At the same time the lawlessness ingrained by governors among the governed during the last thirty, forty, or it may be fifty years ; the brutal plenty of public conscience in regard to public duty , the toughening mid suppling of public morals, and the reckless disregard for human life bred by impotent laws and fostered by familiarity with needless need dents and criminal neglect, will miraculously disappear If the laws of cause and effect that control even the finest people in the world say otherwise, so much the worse for the laws America makes her own Behind her stands the ghost of the most bloody war of the century, caused in a peaceful lindley long temporising with lawless views, by letting things slide by shiftless ness and blind disregard of

patronised She calls her self the capital of the Northwest the new North west, and her citizens wear not only the tall silk hat of trade, but the soft slouch of the west She talks in another tongue
