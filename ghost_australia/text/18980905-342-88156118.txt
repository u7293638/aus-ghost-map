SHIP'S CREW MASSACRED. A CANNABALISTIC FEAST. Another story of a ship's crew being massacred has been brought to Sydney by the steamer Moresby from New Guinea. It reports that about a month ago the cutter Sea Ghost was despatched on a trading cruise in the Solomon Group, under the command of Captain Colohorn. Near the Island Vusa, near Bogamville, the natives clambered aboard in large numbers. The captain was butchered, and four of the crew after a desperate fight were overcome, and the other two who were taken prisoners escaped. The Sea Ghost was run ashore and looted and destroyed. The remains of the murdered men were taken to the village and a cannibalistic feast held. The German warship Falka will pro ceed to the island and punish the natives.
