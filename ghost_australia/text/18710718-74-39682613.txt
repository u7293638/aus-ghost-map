The pyisoner will be brougst before. the Fitzroy Polle Court this day on a chargo of unlawful nssaolt.

A narrow escape from being burnt to death oecured at Brunswick at an early hour on Tace. day morning, .13th instant, to a young man named James M'Kay, in the employ of Mr W. Prowee, Albion.atreet. Ills mate states that MKay wase very restless all night, and got up between a and 4 o'clock in the morning, saying he would milk the cows ; but being told It was too early he went into the sittlngroom, and made up a good fre, taking his bed out and lying down in front of it, where he fell asleep. Some of the coal rolled off the fire, and igniting the bedding soon enveloped the nofortunatoe inan in flames. He ruehed screaming into the bedroom, and the flames were with groat difDoulty put out. He was at once conveyed to the Hospitall. The local correspondent of the Ballarat Statr writes :-' Time, instead of lessening belief in the Burnt-bridge ighost, has rather lntensified that feeling, end this is partioularly true of on of the party from Lia Lal that visited the haunted house. This person Is so imbued whith fear ever since, thtat he is almost prostrate. On Friday night a crowd gathered around him lo his dwelling to hear his version of. the adventure, when, from some cause, the visitors onceremonlooely rushed out. Finding himself thus left'tho' sole oeccupant of the hoose, he hastily snatched up a blanket, buhot his excessive confusion and hurry lelt his bhat oand boots behind, and applied all available speed in making his escape to my house, distant about 60 yards, and pitifully implored admittance. ise said he muest have travelled the distance in 13 bounds, so great was his terror, and he seriously congratulated himseolfon his cood fortone in not coming bump against a tree. Just fancy a man about 45 years of ago, sod about 6ift 6in high, with hair standing on end, barefooted and bareheaded, cleariog huge logs and other ob. structions as if the arch.flond himself were at his heels, from sheer terror from a ghost, and you have a laithful picture of the man on Fridu; night. At Clarendon, a party of men of un* doubted bravery is organislong to challenge the ghost at his haunt, and they propose to furnish themselves with firearms in case of meeting resistance, Should the scheme be carried out, I may have to tell you before long of more converts to the new faith."
