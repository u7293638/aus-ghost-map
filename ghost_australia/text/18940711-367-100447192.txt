TARAGO. [Rvn our Corrtspondent,] PoLITzICALt MNEETrlOS.-TU-ar? ba had its foll charl of political lntk of late. Mr. O'Sullivan has boon here and beard; Mr. Couroy has boon hore, no also Mr. Moluerney-all lr Quenobeyao. The two latter divlde the Iree trade intoreet, the former scouring ail the proteeutionieta. Tarngo has also had the opportunity on last Saturday of hbaring Mr. ShadIler and MIr. Hitehins, both freotradcre. It is a very dia orderly meeting where both the candidates appear on the anme platform. The disorder did not arise Itroem the supporters of either party, but from the protectionirtr. The latter vero allowed to have their meeting without dietnrbauce, and they sheuld constder that others also have similar rights. MIr. Shadler is an able man and a ready opeaker, and habe is tho favorite with the frcctraders. Mr. Hitchies may take away a few tcere votee (it he per nists in goiog to tho poll) from Mr. Shadier; but no one here SeriouSly eupp~ace that bhe hna the ghost of a cbance of being returned. I have noet met with one fretrader habo nill support him in Tarngo. If the freetradere in tho Braideood electorala Cvere nuited thoy would rcturu Mr. Shadier with a good majority.
