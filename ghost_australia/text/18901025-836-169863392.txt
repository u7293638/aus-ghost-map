Little Gray Ghosts. A big farmhouse in New Jersey long stood tenantless, and had the reputation ot being haunted. At laet a young farmer and his wife moved in at a merely nominal rental.' An unearthly clattering on tho atairs frightened the couple half ont of their wits tbe first night, and. the wile tried to pereaade her consort to get np and investigate. For an hour he argued desperately with ber on the advisability of lyirg still. She declared that it he wonldu't investigate Bhe must die or get np herself. Finally they effected a compromise by creeping oat of be^togetber. They lit the lamp and looked cautiously out of the chamber door. Tbe first glance solved the mystery. Big gray equirrels literally swarmed up all the landings; and every one o! them has a big nnt of some kind between his paws. The main supply of note wbb stored in an abused garret, where Borne tenant bad placed thqm long ago. The squirrels arranged themselves in gaoga on each landing, and thoee at the top of the house carried 'the nuts one by one ont of the garret and sent them rolling down the stairs to-tbe next landing, where they were met by tbe gang waiting for' them, and pushed down another flight. In this way they reaohed an rid cellar, whioh waa evi dently the iqnirrela' storeroom, lor it was well stocked with- note. They were moving â€” from attio to basement.
