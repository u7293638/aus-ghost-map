I, < What ! fly, like a coward, at the first faint [muttering of the storm ?' he thought: 1 Be pides, I have alrearfy laid out a good deal of hnpney on the property, and I should lose that [if I. sold thc place now.

' ' Oh, pray don't !' he said, with a certain ' embarrassment. x I assure you í consider ail thé'obligation ti) be on my side.

' : i)he Wipe 1 her eyes demonstratively; and .theil added, in a gayer tone, 'But I dont, lïieàu to thiuk of anything but the ball for the next fortnight, so you músn't expect me to be wise again until that is Over.' Mr. Trelawney glanced at his dau htcr, to :see if she were i nclined to copy her friend's gaiety ; but the lair yonng face was still sad and constrained, and a sort of brooding melancholy darkened the soft, violet eyes. But she evidently made an effort to rally, and pretended to take an ititerest in the ar- rangements Clotilde began so eagerly to discuss. ! ' Shall we dance in the drawing-room ?' the latter asked, presently. ? This question seemed to rouse Edith at fast. 'Not for-worlds !' she answered, emphati- cally. 'I.should have a feeling that Sir Percy's eyes were threatening me ali the while.' Clotilde laughed ' I had no idea you were so nervous and ;'fanciful,1, she said. ' You ought to live in a tuodem house, dear, where there isn't so much as a ¡cupboard that would harbour a ghost! For iny part, I am enchanted with Combe Stratton.' ?'I wish I had your courage,1 sighed the giri. ... ' I wish you had for your own sake. lam not afraid of goblins or hobgoblins-of things natural or snpernatural. But thea, you see, I have had enough of tragedy in my. own liie,to hinder me from seeking it else- where. If you; had been less; fortunato, you would have been less fearful. I do not dread .the future, because I know it can never-bc worse than the past.' ' You seem to have had a very sorrowful life,1 observed Mr. Trelawney, sympathetic cally. ' You may guess how much so, sir, when I tell you the first thing I can remember is see- ing my mother struggling with an assassin.: How it ended, I cannot tell you, for some one seized hold of mc, fwid carried me off ; but when I think of that time, my whole soul seems to tremble with horror and indigna- tion ' Her magnificent eyes were almost super- naturally bright as she said this ; and tiny as her hand was, it looked strong for vengeance, as she clenched it tightly in the lurid shadow of her amber skirts. 'Should you be able to identify this man, do you think?' " My mother's assassin ?' ' Ah !' . < ' Yes,' answered Clotilde, slowly and re- flectively, ' I should know him again. His face is marked on my brain in letters of fire !' ' And you have never been able to trace him?' She shook her head. ' Not yet ; but I live in hopes that the day may yet dome when I shall see him face to face ! Until then, I'll try to wait with pa- tience.' Edith, to whom such a character as Clotilde's was an anomaly, said, in a rather curious tone, ' What should you do, then ?' ' I hardly know-but I am afraid I shall not forgive him,' replied Clotilde, in a tone that Was softly menacing. ' It was my mother he killed, you know.' Mr. Trelawney hastened to turn the sub- ject, and then the tea was brought in; and bëmg'so tiimd'héreelf, vMpHolf mM mbbtf fill« vfrut -wftïnfnlï* -tiíiífw«nfe»JHft.nferli would ask Clotilde to' sltàre her bed; She, therefore, ran to the'aoór, arid líúócked begging' for admittance'; ' Tïëéeivml^ áo<"§#¿ s wer,' she turned the ^handle j but,*to;%eç sürprise,""« was'locked on the other sîde~a thing which (»oóM#%dJfeflflrt^ pWmfeed | never to^do.: , ' - V:,"' !

' Th«? place was--in darkness, save -for ' thej narrow sstripe; of moonshine she had brought ;in with lifer, ánd Clotilde greeted her with a demonstrative yawn. -: ;" < I am so sleepy !' she said.' 'Are you ill.: Edith ?' ' No ; but I am timid, and want company. Why didn't you let me in at"first V ?>'?''. ' At first 1 What do jotí meau ? I have, only just heard you.' . ! ' And I made enough noise to wake the seven sleepers. You couldn't have been here, Clotilde.' ? - ' ; ! ' If not, I must have walked in my sleep, and that isn't one of my habits,' she answered, rather drily. ' Yes ; but I hcnrd a footstep in the pas- sage,'persisted Edith, who was anxious the matter should be explained for her own satis- faction hereafter ; ' and your door was shut immediately afterwards.' ' My dear Edith, you are dreaming.' ; ' Dreaming while awake, then.' i ' There are such things as wakiug dreams,' you know. And your imaginátioü is extra-! ordinary active, as wituess your delusion' about Sir Percy do{ Stratfcon's eyes. I Gati't conceive what would become of you if you married LohlFinniore.' ' Why V asked Edith, glad now of the darkness that concealed her blushes. ' Becausethey have such a terrible legend' in the family about a Shadow Hand ; and; you would be always seeing it, and living in continued dreaû of the misfortunes its ap- pearance is supposed to prelude.' ' I hope I am not quite so föolish as that,'! said ftdith, rather resentfully 5 whereupon her friend laughed, declared that she was tired to death, and suddenly fell asleep.
