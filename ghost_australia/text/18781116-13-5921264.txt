SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1878. Sir CHARLES SLADES, has given notice that he will move on Tuesday that in the opinion of the Legislative Council it is desirable to prepare a statement fot transmission to the Secretary of State detailing, for the information of HER MAJESTY, the circumstances under which differences of opinion have arisen between the two Houses on the subject of con- stitutional reform. As is usual when any member intends to take action of this sort, a draft of the proposed memorial has been prepared, so that any committee that may be appointed to settle its terms may have some basis to work upon. A copy of this draft appeared in our issue of yesterday, which no doubt has received the atten- tion of our readers. The author, we think, may be fairly congratulated on having furnished the material for an able and exhaustive state paper. The committee may perhaps think fit to alter it in some particulars, but we question whether in its main features it is capable of improvement. Calm in tone, clear in arrangement, compre- hensive in scope, and absolutely true in statement, this draft has very strong claims to adoption. Assuming that the memorial will follow it closely, the Secretary of State will soon have in his possession a document which will enable him to check the statements of our "Liberal" plenipotentiaries, and to estimate their imaginative froth at its true value. The draft memorial sets out with a statement of what has occurred this session in both Houses on the subject of reform, and after alluding to the failure of the conference, goes on to mention the proposed embassy. The House will be asked to disclaim any idea that its interference is necessary to prevent the tender of advice to HER MAJESTY which would lead to the realisation of the wishes of a faction through the instrumentality of the Imperial Legislature. " We do not entertain the notion"—so runs the draft—" that any representations made through a delegation from one House of this Legislature, and that House divided in opinion as to the propriety of such an application, will move the Imperial Government to initiate such "a measure." There is every reason to believe that this confidence will be amply justified. To hold otherwise would be to assume that the Imperial authorities will be found willing to aid one party in the colony in fixing its yoke firmly on the neck of the other, and to abandon their policy of non-intervention just when a crisis has arisen that will afford HER MAJESTY'S subjects in this part of the world one of those useful lessons in the art of self- government which form part of the training essential to the future welfare of every young community. The draft memorial points out how unnecessary it is for HER MAJESTY'S Government to take such a retrograde and inequitable step as that proposed by Mr. BERRY and his followers. The Secretary of State is reminded that—" Our Constitution " Act has provided all necessary means. " for making such modifications in our " constitution as experience may suggest ; " and it is a maxim which, the Imperial " Government has long and scrupu- " lously observed, that ' parliamentary " ' legislation on any subject of ex- " ' clusively internal concern to any " ' British colony possessing a repre- " ' sentative Assembly is unconstitu " ' tional.' " The object of the Council in addressing the Colonial Office is not to deprecate interference which it will not allow itself to contemplate as possible, but simply "as one of the " Houses of Legislature of a colony " proud of being an integral portion of " the empire, and knowing that the heart " of the empire is in sympathy with, its " remotest members," to furnish in a succinct form an accurate account of the events which have led up to the present position of affairs, and of the opinions it entertains in respect to them. It would have been open to the Upper House, be it observed, to follow the example of Mr. BEERY and his fol- lower's, who, in the excess of their liberality, are eager to place the rights and privileges of the colony at the dis- posal of Downmg-street. They have too keen a regard, however, for the consti- tutional lights of the Victorian people to do anything which would wear the remotest appearance of willingness to surrender one jot or tittle of our chartered independence. People may be inclined to think that there is little difference between sending a memorial and sending a deputation, as the principle involved is the same. We submit that this is a very superficial view of the case. To forward a statement of facts and views adopted by the Council, to enable the Secretary of State the better to de- termine interference, is certainly no ad- mission of his right to impose ; but to send delegates armed with powers to negotiate, discuss, refute, admit, or ex- ercise discretion of sort, would imply to some extent a doubt concern- ing our own power of self- govern- ment. We trust it will re remembered hereaftrer that it was the "Liberal" party, and not the "reactionaries of the Upper Chamber, that proposed to lay the liberties of Victoria at the feet of Sir MICHAEL HICKS BEACH. The differ- ence between the attitude assumed by the "liberals" and the constitutionalists respectively in relation to this matter is very striking. The loyalty of the former to the Imperial connexion is simply a matter of the breeches pocket. when it pays them to do so, they bluster and threaten the Colonial Oflice after the most improved fashion, and when they fancy they see a few months of oflice and a pleasant trip depending upon the adop- tion of a different tone, they can become quite accomplished courtiers. The con- stitutionalists, on the other hand are prepared at all times to render unto CAESAR the things that be CAESAR'S—to treat the Home authorities with respect, to give to their opinions on points of constitutional practice the attention to which they are entitled, and to render a ready obedience in all matters of Imperial concern. They also ask from the Secretary of State a governor who will insist on the maintenance of the law under all circumstances, and then they are quite prepared to accept from the Colonial Office the principle that the country should be left to work out its own destiny. Passing over the narrative contained in Clause 2, we come to the next section, which deals with the causes of com- plaint alleged against the Council. One is that it has unreasonably ob- structed general legislation ; the other is that it has improperly rejected Appropriation Bills. Both of these grounds of complaint are discussed and disposed of in a satisfactoiy way. In reply to the first, it is pointed out that the acts of the Victorian Parlia- ment now number over 600a proof of legislative activitiy which is fatal to any charge of wilful obstruction. It is also pointed out that— "The Council has on many occasions waived its well-founded objections and has passed bills contrary to its own wishes, be- cause the state of public opinion at the time seemed to require the sacrifice. It has thus surrendered free trade. It has conceded the abolition of state aid to religion. It has per- mitted the sacrifice of that great public estate with which Her Majesty's bounty had endowed the colony. It has allowed a partial and unjust land tax to be im- posed upon one section of its own con- stituents." On one important subject only has it presented legislation—viz., mining on private property. But while it has rejected schemes which even the As- ssembly has since condemned, it has prepared a comprehensive bill of a practical nature which Ministers dare not touch, lest the abused Upper House should have the credit of setting, a diflicult question at rest. The state of the case with regard to the rejection of appropriation bills is lucidly explained, but we must postpone our îeiimiks on this portion of the subject to a future occasion Mr. SERVICE, as the leader of the Opposition, and Mr. BERRY as the head of the Government, have both found it convenient to address the country out- side of Parliament this week The object Mr. SERVICE had in view is plain enough. The labours of the Assembly have been brought to a practical con- clusion, for nothing now remains to be done but to settle the teachers grievance against Major SMITH and to pass the Appropriation Bill, and it is therefore possible to review a session which, however barren of actual results, must be considered as one of the most eventful in Victorian history. This task the membei for Maldon undertook. He placed an intelligent view of the situa- tion as a whole before the public, and in Parliament it is not easy, owing to the forms of the House, to deal with the situation as a whole. But it is difficult to say why Mr. BERRY paid his flying visit to Sale. The announcement he made there last night was in substance the announcement he made in the Assembly on the embassy vote on Wed- nesday evening. All that the country has gained by the repetition is the knowledge that there was no mistake about the first extraordinary deliverance, and that Ministers send their embassy home not only to complain of the exist- ence of a Council, but also of the exist- ence of a Governor—that is,unless both can be relegated to the position of dummies. Of the present representa- tive of the Crown, Ministers can scarcely complain, but his term of office is about to expire, and it may not be easy to keep his successor straight. Therefore a pledge is to be exacted from the Colonial Office that the Governor in Victoria shall never in future be any- thing more than the tool of his advisers. The latter idea, the one which Mr BERRY announced on Wednesday and repeated yesterday, is more exquisite in folly than its predecessor.r Of the two it is more calculated to astonish Sir MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH than the other, and to make him doubt tho mental condition of his interviewers. It is almost unnecessary to say that the proposition is not original Mr HIGINBOTHAM'S speeches have been quoted of late in the Assembly, and to please the devotees of that gentleman the Chief Secretary has revived the craze which isolated from practical politics the ex member for the East Bourke Boroughs We must refer first, however, to the Kyneton address. Mr SERVICE was happy in dividing the labours of the session into two parts. In the first, he placed the ordinary legislation of the year, and that consists mainly of bills to repeal the acts passed last ses- sion, which have proved to be failures. And the second part con- sists of the abortive Reform Bill —a measure which, as it has been ad- mitted, is a bogus bill, and was sent to the Council not tobe passed but to terrify that body, and bring it into a fit state of mind for the purposes of negotiation. A few repealing acts and a bogus bill are the miserable outcome of govern- ment by a Ministry which boasts that it has the support of the largest and most obedient majority over known in the Victorian Legislature. No Govern- ment over had such advantages as the Berry Ministry. Their sup- porters in caucus showed their readi- ness to accept anything—first, a nomi- nee House, and then a dummy elective Council. And the end is that Ministers are saddled with a measure which arouses no enthusiasm in the party, and which its own parents are too much ashamed of to take to Great Britain. For this fiasco there can be no one to blame but themselves. The reflection is on their own administrative capacity. If they foresaw the mission to England from the first, as they say they did, how comes it that they are saddled with a measure they dare not take home ? In marked contrast to the early bragga- docio and present weakness of the Minis- terial policy, is the calm but confident statement of the member for Maldon, that there is no need of an embassy to England, no occasion for any appeal to outside authorities, but that our con- stitution can to-day be reformed as the people require it to be reformed by mutual consent within the colony. The allusion is to the plan of double disso- lutions, and the guaranteed passing of non-political Appropriation Bills, as originally suggested by the Opposition in the Lower House, and since sub- mitted on behalf of the Council. Lend- ing liberal journals, such as the Ballarat Courier, have admitted that here we have the basis of an agreement, and the member for Maldon sees how the theory can be transmuted into fact even in the present political situation. Mr. SERVICE does not allow words to fall from his mouth without an idea of their value. In his position, he is responsible for his utterances. And his declaration that the question can be settled here, and can be settled upon a popular basis, must excite attention both in Victoria and in Great Britain. At Sale we had the usual revilings of the Council. The Chief Secretary says that the Upper House represents an oligarchy of five thousand families, though, as it has 30,000 electors on the roll under a tolerably high property qualification, the correct assumption is that it represents six times the number of families quoted, and the Council itself is willing that it should represent 30,000 families more. But the important part of his address was the details given of the labours of the embassy when it reaches England. In the first place, the Chief Secretary is to ask for a"n enabling " bill "—that is, a bill to allow a Ministry which does not know what it wants to do as it pleases. The second Chamber is to be blotted out of existence at once, and it is to be left to Mr. BERRY and his Assembly to decide whether it shall ever be restored to life again. And having recently informed us that we are so much a part of the empire, that if we disgrace ourselves Great Britain is disgraced also, the Hon. gentleman expects that the Imperial authorities will consent to and render practicable a haphazard reform of this character—will suspend our present constitution without having any idea of what is to follow it. This is proposter- ous enough, but still the palm must be given to the Higinbotham crotchet in its new form. The Chief Secretary, having disposed of the Council, will proceed to demand—on peril of his high displeasure should his demand be not complied with—that, to complete the democratic idea, the Governor shall in future receive no instructions from Downing-street. He must be left in the hands of his Ministers as an officer of their departments, and not of the QUEEN. It is to be noted that so far as colonial interests are concerned, a Go- vernor's instructions are little more than to obey the law. As the head of the Exe- cutive he is to see that the Executive does not outstrip the declared will of the Legis- lature. He is not, for instance, to sign warrants for payments on the vote of the one House if the law says that the consent of the two Houses is necessary. And this yoke is too heavy for a Vic- torian Ministry. They desire that the only law a Governor shall know is their will. They have proposed here to create a Council whose name could be put on bills which it had not passed, and they are to ask the Secretary of State to send a Governor who shall use the QUEEN'S name, but shall use it only as they direct. The Assembly majority is to wield the powers of the Council, and also the powers of the Crown. Mr. BERRY is not altogether devoid of discernment, and it is evident that he begins to feel that there is more than a possibility of his being bowed out of the Colonial Office. But he pledges himself to agitate on every platform on his return in favour of this reform. All that we can say is, that, if Mr. SERVICE agitates against him with anything like equal spirit, the result in a British community can hardly be in doubt. When the valuable character of the work done by the Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society is considered, it is surprising to find how little support it receives from the public. At the monthly meeting of the general committee hold on Tuesday last the honorary treasurer stated that the funds were at a vory low ebb, while the collector reported that he had met with more difficulty in obtaining sub- scriptions, during the past month than ever. So great was the want of money that it had become necessary to apply for an advance out of the Government grant in order to carry on at all. Under these circumstancea the com- mitte appeal to the public for more liberal aid, and we trust that they will not do so in vain. The good which is being effected by this society can scarcely be estimated. One of the greatest draw- backs of our system of punishment is the absence of any plan by which prisoners on obtaining their discharge may be pre- vented from relapsing—as they too »frequently do—into crime. This want is supplied in a great measure by the society whose claims we are advocating. At the meeting on Tuesday, no less than 22 applications were disposed of. We ?learn that seven of the applicants were sent up the country to their friends or to employment, three were sup- plied with blankets and clothing, and sent to districts where it was known that work could be obtained, situations were procured for two, and the rest were dealt with as the circumstances warranted. These particulars, as showing the practical nature of the societys oeprations, are interesting, while it is in the highest degree satisfactory to find that a good account can be given of the cases which had previously come under the attention of the society. It is proved that efforts made to reclaim the criminal are not thrown away, but in many cases are followed by the happiest results. The announcement of such facts as these should render unnecessary any formal recommendation of the society to the support of the public. We have but few hereditary criminals, and thus the conversion of offenders into honest workers is quite possible, and is a distinct gain to the community, even from the pounds, shillings, and pence point of view, while the taking in hand discharged prisoners at what is general the turning- point of their life, may avert incalculable suffering and misery in the future. If anything were wanted to stimulate inte- rest in the work of the Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society, the recent terrible crimes in the Mansfield district should be more than sufficient.

The plaintiff went as a lodger to the hotel on the 1st September. On the morning of the 9th September, another lodger in the same room called his attention to the state of one of the beds, and the plaintiff went to the landlord to complain. In the evening, when the plaintiff went to have his tea, no one would serve him, and the defendant told him to put on his hat and follow him. He took Erskine to the street, and gave him into custody for an assault, but the charge was altered at the station to one for using threatening, abusive and obscene language. The case was dismissed at the police court, and this action was brought.
