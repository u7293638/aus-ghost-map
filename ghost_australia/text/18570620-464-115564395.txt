CATHOLIC INTERESTS: IN AUSTRALIA. — 'ICOLMKILL.' Sir, — Should the abuses exist that are mentioned' in the Freeman of last Saturday, signed ' Icolmkill,' ' I ant sure, by giving due information to our ecclesi. astical superiors of the place and the abuse, they have sufficient zeal and courage to apply a suitable remedy. However, permit me a word on catecheti cal instruction. I fear persons might be led into error, seeing, 'Icolmkill's'' communication on that point, at least. In the district in which I reside, which is far, far in the bush, there is only one priest. The Christian Doctrine is taught by the clergyman himself, not in a parrot-like manner, but the Cate chism is explained to children and people, on Sun days and holydays, after Mass, sometimes before it, as opportunity presents itself. This is occasionally done for the congregation before speaking on the Epistle and Gospel at Mass. On Wednesdays and Fridays it is taught by the clergyman in the church adjoining his residence. On other days, at the school's. I may mention besides, that within the last five years, in this district, (54) fifty-four persons have been received into the Church, from other denominations (baptized on condition), most of whom have been instructed in the Catholic faith and practice by the clergyman himself. ' Knowing you will have many communications on this subiect. I omit many observations. Wishinsr. how- ever, that ' Icolmkill' may apply proper remedies to the existing evils, by making parents send their chil dren to instruction, providing more priests, and as sisting the authorities placed over us by the Holy Ghost, — I remain, yours, &c.; ' 12th June, 1857.
