THE PEOPLE OF THE MIST By H. RIDER HAGGARD, . (CONTINUED FROM SATURDAY LAST.) CHAPTER XIX. THE END OF THE JOURNEY. An hour later they began the ascent of the wall of rock, which proved to be an even more difficult business than they had anticipated There was no path, for those who lived beyond this natural barrier never came down it and few of the dwellers in the plains had ever ventured to go up It was possible, for Soa herself had descended here in bygone years, and this was all that could be said for it in default of a better food they followed the course of the river, which thundered down the face of the precipice in four great waterfalls, connected by as many sullen pools, whose faculties had been hollowed out in the course of centuries from the rock The second of these ledges proved so rampant able that at one time Leonard thought that they would be obliged to abandon the attempt, and follow at the foot of the off till they found some easier route But at last Otter, who could climb like a cat, succeeded in passing the most dangerous part at the risk of his life, bearing a rope with him, by means of which the rest of the party and the loads of goods were hauled up one by one. It was nightfall before the height was Bailed, and they proceeded to encamp upon its summit, making a scanty meal of some meat which they had brought with them. That night they passed in great discomfort, for it was midwinter, and here the climate proved to be very cold Bitter winds swept across the vast plain before them and searched them through all the clothing and blankets they had scarcely sufficing to keep them warm , indeed, the Settlement men and _? Francisco, who had been bred in a southern clime, suffered severely Nor were matters improved when, on the breaking of the light, they woke from a troubled sleep to and the plain hidden in a dense mist. However, they rose, made a fire with reeds and dead wood which they gathered on the banks of the river, and are, waiting for the fog to vanish But it did not vanish, so about 6 o'clock they continued their journey under God's guidance follow up the east bank of the river northwards The ground was easy to travel over, for with the exception of isolated water worn boulders of granite, the plain was perfectly smooth and covered with turf as fine as any that grows in northern lands All that day they marched on, wandering like ghosts through the mist, and guided in their path by the murmuring sound of the river They met no rain, but once or twice great herds of dairy creatures thundered past them Leonard fired into one of these herds with an express rate, for they wanted meat, and a prodigious snorting and bellow- ing told him that his shot had taken effect Running to the spot whence the sounds came, he found a huge white bull kicking, in its death struggle The animal was covered with long white hair like that of the Scottish breed of cattle, and measured at least seventeen hands in height Round it stood others snorting with fear and wonder, that when they saw Leonard, put down their heads threateningly, tearing up the turf with their treat hours. He shouted aloud and fired another shot, whereon they turned and disappeared into the mist. This happened towards nightfall, so they determined to camp upon the spot, but while they were engaged in skinning the ball an incident occurred that did not tend to raise their spirits At sunset the sky cleared a little, at least the sinking sun showed red through the mist as it does in a London fog of the third density. Against this red ball of the Ban and some dozen yards away, suddenly there appeared the gigantic figure of a man, for, unless the fog deceived them he must have been between six and seven feet high and broad in proportion Of his face they could see nothing, but he was clad in goatskins, and armed with a great spear and v. bow slung upon his back. Juunna was the first to see and point him out to Leonard with a start of fear, as he stood watching them in solemn silence. One) mg the impulse of the moment, Leonard walked forward towards the vision holding his nile read), but before he reached the spot where it had stood the figure vanished. Then he walked back again to Joanna. " I think we have heard so much of giants that we begin to believe NIC see them," he said laughing As he spoke something close the air between them and stuck in the earth beyond. They went to it It was a large arrow with a barbed point, and lighted with red feathers "This is a very tangible fancy, at any rate,' Juanna answered, drawing the arrow out of the ground " W. have had a narrow escape Leonard did not speak, but using his rifle fired it at a venture in the direction whence the shaft had Bped 11 en he ran to put their little band in a position of defence, Junnnn following him But, as it chanced, he might have spared himself the trouble, for nothing further happened indeed, the net outward and visible result of this mysterious apparition was that they spent a miserable night waiting in the fog and wet for It had come on to rain or rather to drizzle- for an enemy who, to their intense relief, never appeared I Hut the inward and spiritual consequences were much greater, for now they knew that She spoke truth, and that the legend of the bushmen of great men covered with hair was no mere' savage invention At length the morning came it was damp and wretched and they were all half starved with cold and oppressed by) fear Indeed, some of the Settlement men were so terrified that they openly lamented having, suffered their sense of shame and loyalty to overcome their determination to retreat Now they could not do so for the malcontents among them did not dare to retrace their steps alone, more over Leonard spoke plumb on the matter, telling them that he would drive away the first man who attempted any insubordination Soaked through, shivering and miserable, Hit j pursued their march across the unknown plum Son who seemed to grow hourly grimmer now that she was in her own I country, station" ahead of tin in us trade It was warmer walking than sitting, still, and in one respect their lot was better for a little meal stirred that must from time to time, rtNenlnu, times of the watery sun All that day they journeyed on seeing no more of the man who had shot an arrow or his fellows, till at length darkness drew away again Then they halted, and Li chard and Otter wall ed to and fro Searching for a suitable place to make their camp and pitch their solitary tent Presi ntl) Otttr shouted aloud. Leonard ran towards him, and found him staring into the mist at something that loomed largely about a hundred yards UWIl) "Look Unas "he said "there is a house a house of stone with grass growing on the roof "Nonsense said Leonard, "it must be some more boulders However, we can soon find out they crept cautiously towards the object, that as soon became evident was a house, or a very good apology for one, built of huge un- dressed boulders bedded in tars by way of murder and roofed with the trunks of small trees and a thick tuition of sods whereon the "runs drew green line building may have miHBiiretl forty) feet in length by twenty in depth and seventeen from the ground line to the wall plate Also it had a doorway of a mark able height and two window places, but all thiaeopeninga were enclosed, swept by curtains of hide which hung before them I seemed called Son, and asked her what the place was "Doubtless the house of a herdsman," she answered, who is set here to watch the cattle of the King, or of the priests It may "Copvrlelt ison In the United! tHat is of Atherton, b) li Rl 1er Haggard The right of p m Ils) lue this work throughout I Hu colonies of Australasia has. been purchased by us proprietors pt J lit striking chance that this is the dwelling of that man who shot the arrow j yesterday Having assured themselves that here was a human habitation, it remained to be ascertained whether it was tenanted After waiting a while to see whether anyone passed in or out, Other undertook the task Going down on to his hands and knees, he crept up to the wall, then along it to the doorway, and after listening there a while, he lifted a corner of the hide curtain and peeped into the in tenor Presently he rose so ing " All right, Bans the place is empty Then they both entered and examined the dwelling with curiosity It was rude enough The walls were plastered and the damp * streamed down them, the floor was of trodden mud, and a hole in the roof served as a chimney , but, by way of compensation the internal space was divided into two apartments, one of them a living room and the other a sleeping chamber It was evident that the place had not been long deserted, for fire still smouldered on the hearth, round windi stood v anona earthen cooking dishes, and in the sleeping room was a rough bed stead of wood w season la) w rappings made from the hides of cattle and goats When they had seen everything there was to be seen, they hurried back to the others to report their discovery, and just then the rain set in more heavier) than before ' A house I said Joanna ' Then for good news sake let us see into it We are all half dead with the cold and wet ' "Yes," answered Leonard, ' I think we had better take possession, though it may be a little awkward if the rightful owners come back The best that can be said for the night which they spent inch in stone shanty, undisturbed by any visit from its lawful tenant, is that it passed a shade more comfortably than it would have done outside _ they were dry, though the place was damp, and they had a fire Still, until you are used to it it is trying to sit in the company of a score of black people and of many thousand fleas, enveloped with a cloud of pungent smoke according to the custom of our Norse an castors boon J Hanna gave it up and retired to the great bed in the inner chamber, wondering much who had occupied it lasts A herdsman, she judged, as Sea had suggested, for in a corner of the room stood an ex-head hugely fashioned. Still it was a bed, and she slept as soundly in it as its numerous insect occupants would allow the others were not so fortunate, they had the insects indeed, but no bed Again the morning came, wet, miserable and mist) and through the mist and the rain the) pursued their course whither they knew not All day they v. wandered on by the banks of the river till night fell and the camped, this time without shelter Now they had reached the extreme of wretched ness, for they had little or no food left, and could not find fuel to make a fire Leonard took Soa aside and questioned her, for he saw clearly that a couple more days of this suffering would put an end to all of them "You say that these people of yours have a city, Sea'' "They have a cat, Deliverer," she answered, ' but whether they will suffer you to enter it except as a victim for the sacrifice is another matter ' "None of us will enter it unless we find shelter soon," he answered "How far is the place away is ' "It should he a days journey, Deliverer severe the mist gone you could see it now The city is built at the foot of great mount rains there are none higher- but the fog hides every thing to-morrow if it lifts, you will see that I speak truth ' Are there any IIOUBCS near where we can better" he asked again " How can I tell ' abc answered " It is forty years since I passed this road, and here, where the land is barren, none dwell except the herdsman Perhaps there is a house at hand, or perhaps there is none for many miles Who can BOJ a 1 finding that there was no more to be got out of Soa, Leonard returned to the others, and they huddled themselves together for warmth on the wet ground as best they might, and sat out the hours in silence, not attempting to sleep The Settlement men were numb with cold, and nanna also was overcome for the first time, though she tried hard to be cheerful Francisco and Leonard heard their own blankets on her, pretending that they had found spare ones but the wraps were wringing wet, and gave her little comfort, Soa alone did not appear to suffer perhaps because it was her native climate and Otter kept his spirits, which neither heat, nor cold, nor hunger seemed to affect " While my heart is warm I am warm, ' he said cheerfully, when Leonard asked him how he fared As for Leonard himself, he sat silent, listening to the means of the Settlement men, and reflecting that 24 hours more of this misery would bring the troubles of most of them to an end Without food or shelter it was very certain that few of those alive to night would live to seen second dawn At last the light came, and to their wonder and exceeding joy they found that the rain had ceased and the mist was melting Once more they beheld the face of the sun and rejoiced in its warmth as only those can rejoice who for days and nights have lived in semi darkness, wet to the skin and frozen to the marrow The worst of the mist was gone indeed, but it was not until they had breakfasted off a back which Often shot in the reeds by the river that the lingering veils of vapour with drew themselves from the more distant land scope At last they had vanished, and for the first time the wanderers saw the land through which they were travelling They stood upon a vast plain that sloped upwards gradually till it ended at the foot of a mighty range of snow- capped mountains named, as they learned in after days the Bina Mount teams This range was shaped h in a half moon, or a bent bow, and the nearest point of the curve, formed by a soaring snowy peak, was exactly opposite to them, and to all appearance not more than five and twenty miles away On either side of this peak the unbroken line of mountains are ceded with a vast and majestic sweep till the eye could follow them no more the plant on which they were wies barren and every where strewn with granite boulders, between which wandered herds of wild cattle, mixed with groups of antelopes ; but the lower slopes of the mountains were clothed with dense jumper forests and among them were clearings presumably of cultivated land Otter searched the scene with his eyes that were those of a bank , then said quietly " Look yonder, lines , the old king has not lied to us There is the city of the People of the Mist. following the line of the dwarf a out stretched hand, Leonard saw what had at first escaped him, that Htundmg back in a wide band at the foot of the great moan tram in front of them were a multitude of houses built of some grey stone and roofed with green turf Indeed, had not his attend tion been called to it, the town might well have missed observation until he was quite close to its walls, for the material of which it was constructed resembled those of the boulders that lay around them in thousands and the vivid green of the roofs gave it the appearance of a distant space of grassy land " Yes, there is the kraal of the Great People, ' said Other again, and it is a strong kraal Look, Baas they know how to do find themselves The mountain is behind them that none can climb, and around their walls the river runs in a loop on either side, joining itself together again on the plain beyond it would go ill with the 'fire which tried to take that kraal love while they all stood still and stared amazed It seemed strange that they should I) ii el reached this fabled city, and now they were there how would they be red lived within its walls! flint was the nutrition which inch of them was making himself here was but one way to find out- they must go and sit , no retreat was now past Bills Even the Settlement men left this "Better to die at the hands of tin Omit Min- Hill one of them alone, ' than to perish miserably in the mist and cold " He of food char, ' Leonard _ii»wei;f>j_ " you are not yet dead The sun shines once more. It is a good omen " When they had rested and dried their clothes they marched on with a certain sense of relief There before them was the goal they had travelled so far to win , soon they would know the worst that could tell them, and anything was better than this long sus poise By midday) they had covered about fifteen miles of ground, and could now see the city clearly It was a great town, surrounded by a Cyclopean wall of boulders, about which the river ran on every side, forming a natural boat. The buildings within the wall seemed to be arranged in streets and to be built on a plan similar to that of the house in which they had slept two nights before, the v nst con generation 01 grass covered roofs giving the city the appearance of a broken field of turf hillocks supported upon walls of stone for the rest it was laid out upon a slope, and at its head, immediately beneath the sheer precipices of the mountain side, stood two edifices very much larger in size than any of those below. One of these resembled the other houses in construction, and was surrounded by a separate enclosure, but the second, which was placed on higher ground, so far as they could judge but that dr tance, was roofless, and had till the characteristics of a Roman amphitheatre. At the far end of this amphitheatre stood a huge mass of polished rock, bearing a grotesque resemblance to the figure of a man " What are those buildings, Soa''asked Leonard. "The lower one is the house of the king, White Man, and that above is the Temple of Deep Waters, where the rev er rises from the bowels of the mountain " "And what is the black stone beyond the temple ' " That, White Man, is the statue of the god who sits there for ever, watching over the city of his people." " He must be a great god," said Leonard, alluding to the size of the statue. " Ile a great, she answered, " and my heart is afraid at the sight of him " After resting for two hours they marched on again, and soon it became apparent that their movements were watched. The road way which they were following-if IN track booton Hat by the feet of men and cattle could he called a road-wound to and fro between boulders of rock, and here and there standing upon the boulders were men clad in goat skins, each of them carrying a spear, a bow, and a horn. So soon as their party came within five or six hundred yards of one of these men, he would shoot an arrow in their direction, which, when picked up, proved to be barbed with iron, and lighted with red feathers like the first that they had Been, then he would blow his horn, either as a signal or a token of defiance, bound from the rock, and vanish. This did not look encouraging, but there was worse to come. Presently, as they drew near to the city, they descried large bodies of armed men crossing the river that surrounded it in boats and on rafts, and muster ing on the other side. At length all of them were across, and the regiment, which appeared to number more than a thousand men, formed up in a hollow square and advanced upon them at the double. The crisis was at hand (To be Continued Next Saturday.)
