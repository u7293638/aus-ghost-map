A DANGEROUS FREAK. TO THE EDITOR. SIR,-A little after 10 o'clock last night, as I was returning from Mr Forbes'lecture, when near the railway station, I saw inside the fence, at the end of the old offices, a very tall headleBS object, all in-white, standing close to the wall. It glided slowly towards the wicket leading to the front of the build ings, and I lost sight of it for the time; but saw another figure similarly attired on the old platform, and following in the same direction the other had taken. I thought to myself, are there " spirits about," but not being a. spiritist I resolved to see what it i all meant; so I hastened in the direction the first had taken, and when I came in front of the old entrance to the station I" looked over the fence, and saw the object before described standing against the gate post. I said, "Hallo, a ghost 1" but getting .no answer I reached over the fence, and touched it with my cane about -where the1 head should be, and found it was not all shadow. It then retreated behind the wicket. Two young men whom I knew happening to come along at the time, I told : them there were " ghosts " inside, and to come with'me and ?we'd see what they were like. We ran round, and when we got inside; we could see two figures as before described rotrcatirig hastily towards the old waiting room, where they disappeared, slamming the. door after them, and we gayeug the chase. Whether in the i}esh, or out of the ilesh, they seemed tome to be of the female "persuasion.?' It may be a stupid attempt at ' a practical! joke ; but I think, sir, the thing is very! reprehensible, and might havo a serious i effect on timid females and children. < Eer- j haps you might room, for t^iis in ivour; valuable journal, and, looping yoq will excuse! | the liberty I take in thus addressing you,-; I am, etc.,.
