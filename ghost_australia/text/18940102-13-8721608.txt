Goddard, who depends for his success on his long reach and the force of his terrible blouse was eager welcome to close quarters and he stood squarely on his legs and followed Laing round the ring Laing on the other hand ev recently placed his reliance on his condition and powers of endurance and his policy was to evade Goddard sdirectattack. Hocrouchedlikca panther and sprang in every now and then to give and receive punishment Some heavy How a were delivered during the first two or three rounds with little advantage-or little damage as the case may be to either side Once Goddard fell on his knee and once he knocked Laing on to the ropes During the fourth and fifth rounds leaving appeared to be tiring and he took one or two heavy biouaonthc face without apparently being able to put much power into His returns He ducked re pointedly to avoid Goddard a heavy left and usually succeeded, but received one or two lum) upper cuts But when he came up for the seventh round he was still smiling and confident, whilst Goddard's supporters were less noisy and demonstrate. c and the toll man began to wear an anxious look his face as he found it more and more difficult to deliver the knockout blow that wasexpecked from him. The seventh round was the turning point of the match for at its conclusion Goddard was evidently (more distressed than the New Zealander He now commenced to alter his tactics standing, up to his man and giving quite as much punishment as he received Several red weals stood out on Goddard's ribs and blood trickled from beneath his left eye The swarthy skin of the half costs concealed the marks of his punishment. He now came up confident!) at the beginning of each round and at the tenth it simply became a question of how long Goddard would last. He staggered from every lilias hit, whilst Laing still strong and nimble on his feet sprang out of the reach of Goddard's blows and jumped in again to force the fighting Goddard a wind was quite gone, and perspiration ran from him in streams In the middle of the twelfth round he hold out his hand in token that the fight was over Latiigselzedltwith alacrity and then ran off to his corner with a jubilant air, the winner of a well fought, contest There was great cheering, and after It subsided Goddard came to the ropes and gasped out a few sen fences. He said he gave in because the chances were million to one against his winning He must have been hopelessly beaten had he continued, for to his great surprise his condition was quite gone The BOWLING Essendon v Flemington This match was played at Essendon yesterday Scores -I Essendon -Rink 1 Cornwell Williamson, Russell, Morton (calls ) 22 Rink 2-Hughes, Leith, Swan Weare (capt ) 22 RinkS Watson, Macdonald, Taylor (capt) 42.
