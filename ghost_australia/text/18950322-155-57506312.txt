THE SPORTS AT THORNTON. General Committee—Messrs J. Melano, M. Baudewig, W. Robb, J. Tossol,A. M'Martin, G. Robinson, and H. Baker, Starter—Mr. W. Parsons. Judges—Messrs. W. Robb, D. Robinson and J. Melano. It was left for our Thornton friends to step into the breach and pay worthy hom- age to Ireland's patron Saint this year. Mr. John M'Minu was the hero of the 17th March, 1894, and on this occasion, young Mick Baudewig was surrounded with a "cosmopolitan committee," whose names were quite sufficient guarantee to the public that everything would be con- ducted square-and-above-board. To those of our readers who are unacquainted with the history of St. Patrick, we may be permitted to briefly sum up the same in a few words. He was born in Scotland at a place called Kirkpatrick, some 14 cen- turies past. He was consecrated bishop of the Irish in the year 432, and died full of years and honors on the 17th March, 493\. He was a gentleman; he built a church in Dublin town, and upon it put a steeple. Further, he banished all the snakes from Ireland. Beyond the dispute about his nationality, the above is St. Patrick's history, as the saying goes, in a nutshell. The weather was simply charming, and the surrounding country never looked more picturesque. Indeed, this portion of our shire always presents a most at- tractive appearance, more particularly the low lying lands. The homesteads dotted here and there with their beautiful gar- dens and artistically laid out walks, makes it a pleasure to drive in the vicinity of Thornton and Upper Thornton. On all sides we seethe industrial results of the pioneers of the place. Well laid-out farms, with the fences in good repair; horses, cattle and sheep, as if properly cared for; all of which facts tend to prove that the Thorntonites need never fear the baliffs coming down upon them. Ample provision had been made at the Rubicon hotel in anticipation of a big crowd, and it was well it was so, for the commissariat store was taxed to its ut- most strength to keep pace with those who were in need of succour. The people had to be stowed away fore-and-aft, and some of those who were first at the tables looked as if they were ready to scoff a ring-bolt. However, in time, everyone was served and well-satisfied, and made for the track, which was prepared oppo- site the hotel. Two new aspirants to be- come angels in the service of Satan were striding all over the paddock roaring out the odds, but their existence was of short duration, as they were finally stran- ded early in the afternoon. The maiden brought to the ropes 8 starters, for which Jack Hill was made favourite, and pulled his backers through. For the Sheffield handicap there were 19 nominations, most of whom accepted. From the moment the handicap came to hand, Jack Hill was spotted as the "real thing," and his name was coupled with all the acceptors in the hurdles. Mr. W. Parsons furnished another proof of his great aptitude in this unthankful kind of work, as the final heat resulted in a most exciting finish be tween Hill and Maddeford, both of whom had been put back a yard for their im patience. It was thought by many that it was a dead heat, but the supreme authority announced it otherwise. For the hurdle race, Maddeford had a soft thing, as he won it as he liked. The handicap quoit match was the only event which seemed to create dissatisfaction, the drawing for partners being opposed to the rules guiding the game of quoits. The measuring, also, was contrary to the ac- customed rule. Messrs. J. Hewitt and W. Asling where the victors. The old buffers' race was looked upon as the best of good things for Mr. Geo. Payne. senr., who stripped as fit as a fiddle. As the backers gathered round they were per- fectly satisfied with their selection. There was much disapointment when it was discovered that Mr. E. W. Sampson had failed to nominate for this event. But it was the ancient saying, "the old dog for the hard road," for Ned had dis- covered among the crowd, a "dark 'un,"' whom he nominated and successfully plunged on. Brother Jeff fell like an areolite amongst his apponents, who thought that his chances of winning would have been safer in the hands of Hogan's ghost than in his own. Before the start it was Government house to a sheet of bark on G.P. As the old'uns got away to an even start, a great cheer went up, and the scramble for places along the sides of the ropes kept the committee in great anxiety for fear the ropes would be rushed. The darkie wins, and as G.P. had shot his bolt he easied off and left his colored brother to become the hero of the hour. George Payne had hard luck to run against such a snag as the veteran darkie. However, the colored race owes George a grudge of olden times. Many of the early residents will remember Darkie Jones, who was a toff in his day. George was passing this individual on one occasion, and the former was annoying him by shouting "snowball."

The committee worked with a will throughout the day, and their efforts were a financial success. The surplus of the sports will be carried forward to next year's celebration A dance was given in the Public hall in the evening, which was largely patronised, as may be un- derstood, when we state that over £8 were taken at the door. This amount will augment the funds for the purchase of a piano for the instution. Mr. W. Findley officiated as M.C.
