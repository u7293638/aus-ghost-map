She frowned in tills way now-while she looked at tlie young- mpn contajnplativ^ .out of her yellow-brown eyes. " I cannot picture to myself why a man like you should wish to marry a, woman like me. I am not ductile, notanalleable. 1 have not the qualities that make a good wife—for such as you." Glaverhouse shrugged his shoulders. *' I love you." . ",0J), yes. The old stoiy." " Meanwhile you do not answer me." "Well, I answer you now.. And m a •way Vvbicli, toa'degiee, surprises myself. 5 ou want pie to mgrry won ? I will -do as you wish." Never, surely, was there a Etranger courting. Ciaverliouse would have wished to draw lier to him, but something in her mien forbade approach. Whether she lov-edhimwoula have been a question he could have asked himself very pertinently under the conditions existent, But he did not put the query to himself. She consented to many ium. And for the rest, he loved her. This faot alone filled the horizon for him, suffused it with a glamor in which. all othef jBguBB showed shadotraly through a veii. . • • : - , • When news of. Glaverfiouse s anticipated marriage reached his Mends it occasioned a wondering murmur. He had heendeemed an eccentric where women were concerned: almost a misogynist. In many other ways he was nnhke other men. As aboyhe bad been a dreamer; -as a youth at college he had been called "23ass Claverhouse' •until he one day quietly inocked down-a bigfellow in whose mouth the appellation had most frequently been. He had a skin fair as a girl'e, and his frame was .slight, tell and delicate. He bad travelled most of his time He had never taken anj active part m life whatever He spoke little, and hjp mode of address had sometlung of the drawUng gentleness of a very feminine womajj.

The dusky Jaces pressed close together on the outermost fringe of the la\vn were accented by wide open eyes and gaping mouths. For miles up and down the nver it had become known that wedding was to take place at Orange QfOfsSppags that night.

Tifere was a stir, a growing mjirmur, m the- house— caught up by the house servants and ibjally percolating to that waiting crowd outside.:; The bride was gone! - The bride was gone and the groom bad not come. iliss St. Sauveur. had. gone to her room early m the evening with orders that Ehe was not to be disturbed. And Josephine St. Sauveur was not a girl whom, even on such an occasion, people disobeyed. When the hour for the weddmg'arn.ved, however, and with it the few guests bidden, her door was knocked at and, no response forthcoming, finally broken open. The room was empty, and on the bed lay the white dress, the white veil. In the dismayed confusion that ensued no one at first observed that Claverhoose, too, should have come by this. But as the wild search for the bride continued without result it burst upon those assembled below that they were congregated together to witness an occurrence strange indeed—a marriage at which neither groom nor bride had appeared. Suddenly a quivering cry rang over the lawn. A small negro boy stood, witb goggling eyes, the centre of a" circle that pressed evermore tightly arougd him, gn^ strange words were those he poured out' stammenngly One or two of the white pe pie cned at first tbat lie had seen a ghost.
