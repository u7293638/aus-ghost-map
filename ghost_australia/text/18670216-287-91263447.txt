MEADOWS, Feb. 12. TFrom an occasional Correspondent.! Last night the Meadows was enlivened by a very good entertainment given by the Victorian Minstrels, one of our worthy inhabitants being voted to the chair. After sundry quips and quirks about the Meadows millers, aud others belonging to the place, the performance began, and it certainly was carried out in excellent style. Amongst those who patronised the entertainment we noticed our worthy tanner, Mr. Goble, and sundiy other notable inhabi tants. The entertainment was well patronised, and mUFt have been a very good spec for the per formers. The performance wound up with danc ing, which was kept up until Sol appeared above the horizon, when everybody dispersed, appa rently very much pleased with the evening's amusement, and we only hope that we may have tlie pleasure of soon seeing the Victorian Min strels again. 1 am sorry to say that the driver and guard of our Meadows mail must have spent a very sleepless night. — I am also sorry to say that our worthy miller met with an accident the day before yesterday, having caught his hand in one of the bands, and also in jumping into one of the bins he unfortunately sprained his foot.— Another accident also happened yes terday, Mr. Holla m by unfortunately seriously injured his foot, while engineering in the em ploy of W. Hall, Kb i. — A great loss was sus ained by Mr. Woodgale laat Friday, by a valuable horse suddenly 'giving up the ghost.' — Our school goes no further at present, a cause of grief to those couples who have children to educate.
