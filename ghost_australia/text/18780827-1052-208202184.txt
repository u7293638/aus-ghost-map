" Well, I will a peculiar t affair that happened on Tall mans Gully, in X 850'." S We were all attention; and listened to the vsry remark -' f able narrative he related in the following manner / " You must know, commenced my nncle, " that I and \ four mates were living in a tent on the banks cf the river — living, I said, I should have called it existing, for ) we were most unforhinate, only finding sufficient gold to ) keep us in the commonest tucker. After our evcrydp,y's work, you may be sure we were tired enough ; but we were I every night disturbed in our rest by the clink, clink, clink I of a pick, about fifty yards from our canvas home. This confounded noise always commenced at midnight, and did? I not cease until the break of day. One night we were . determined to see who it was ; so we sallied forth in the bright moonlight, and saw a figure in a coarse red flannel I shirt, high boots, and slouched hat,' hard at work by an , old claim' which had been deserted for many years. I was chosen spokesman, to expostulate 'with this noisy digger; I but when I was within twenty yards of him, I stood still, transfixed with horror, — fo.r the wearer of the digger's clothes was no ludng imn, hut a xhelcton !" I " Uncle_Ned 1" we all cried, " how fearful." ''One night, our tent was visited by a handsome, well- to-do looking man, of about fifty years of age, - who enquired for a digger of whom we knew, nothing about. He told ushKat in '51 he. and a mate of his deserted from one of Her Majesty's ships, and started for the Tallmans gold fields; They worked with pretty good luck for a few months, when the new comer went down to Melbourne to see rabput" some letters. Before he went, he said to his mate, '.Bob, whatever, you do, never stop working the claim for a day until I come back.' Bob promised, and they parted. ' I went down - to Melbourne,' said the ex- digger, 'and there was arrested as a deserter, and sent on boaplj.and now that , I /have obtained my discharge, I haye hastened up here to find iny old chum.' ' You will see him to-night,' rl said; ' but you'll find him very much changed.' At midnight,, the everlasting clink of the phantom's .pick, vyas heard,.',aud'we all turned out. 'Ah 1 ' cried ithe" sailor, / there's , .clear old ,Bpb. Bob, here I am back. ' - Bob, speak to" ine.' " He ran to" the figure, which turned its hideous face'ou hiin.
