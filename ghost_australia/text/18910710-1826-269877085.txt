A Pathetic BalltuK 'Twas in the middlo of tho night, To sleep young William tried; When Mary's ghost came stealing iti, And stood at his bedside. 0 William dear » 0 William dear I My rest eternal ceases; Alas J my everlasting poacc Is broken into pieces. 1 thought the last of all my cares '- Would end with my last minute ? But though I went to my long home, I didn't stay long in it. ' The body- snatchers they have come And made a snatch at me; It's very hard them kind of men Won't let a body bo!

I rowed that you should have my hand But fate gives us denial; You'll find it there, at Dr. Bell's, In spirits and a phial. As for my feet, the little feet You used to call so prclty. There's one I know, in Bedford Row, The t'otiler's in the City. I can't tell where my head has gone, But Doctor Carpue can ; As for iny trunk, it's all packed up To go by Pickford's van. I wish you'd go to Mr. P. And save me such a ride ; I don't half like the outside place They've took for my iusidc. The cock it crows—I must be ^one My William, we must part! But I'll be yours in death, allho' Sir Astley has my heart. Don't go to weep upon my grave, And think that there I be ; They haven't left an atom there Of my anatomic. «—TUOMAS IIUOD,
