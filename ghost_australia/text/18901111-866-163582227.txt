M E F Y S H ’S W H IM S.

E ith er through want of tim e o r lack of interest, he nevor probes to fciieioot o f abuses, relying luo im plicitly upon officials who, from th e very n ature of things, p o t a complexion upon internal circumstauces wliicb facts do not w arrant. F ts h has, from tim e to time, as an advocate of free, popular election. H e usually adopts this “ ta k in g ” m ethod when he has axe to grind, w hether it be the advancem ent of a favorite or to curry favor w ith the electors. If his motive* were closely examined we fear th a t they p artake more of cool calculations’ ae ,tp personal prestige and political power, to the periodical silencing of tbe better prom ptings of a n atu rally hum ane disposition. Mr. F ts h is in hie elem ent when, standing up in the Legislative Council, he pours forth stream of words w ith very little in them. B u t this, to him, ip of small m oment so loog as be can bear down upon a troublesom e critic, and m ake th e worse appear the better reason T h a t style of w arfare may pass am id tho turm oil of an election, ju s t as a lot of m eaniugless sentences were briskly atppiTd during th e B uckingham cam paign. The iroproBKiuB produced a fte r these contcHis is thin, th eir author had ever u ttered them , and th a t men of intelligence could b are been influenced by them . If M r.

A nd all th e wbilo Mr, F ts h com forts him self w ith the deluding th o u g h t th a t he is prom oting th e h ig h est in terests of tbe country. The spefidhes w hich th e M embeb for B uckingham delivers on full.dre6s occasions are exceptionable in the m ajority of instances, but listeners who can recall the fluctuating movem onis of th e orator, feel th a t they sum m it to nothing b u t words, words, words. H e w ill raise hopes, ho will advocate reform s, ho will point to] exalted p atte rn s in other lands,—but th e effect upon thoughtful m inds is p urely theatrical, and th e highest eDcomjnia they pan pronounce is, that he is “ an uncommonly clever fellow .” If any oae will t-ako the trouble to uualyse hifi public utterances outside Parliam ent, w ithin the p a st five or six yoats (to go no farth e r back), many fine ibcorips m ay be encountered, many commendable plans sketched t.

The Air. I'v^u who harangued a t the foot of tb e tab le in the Council on finouce, charitable institutions, retrenchm ent, and fa ir taxation is not tho Mr. F tsh who now upon tbe Treasury Bench, to 1S87 ho em itted declarations which led his supporters to th in k th at if ho got iuto power he w ould inaugurate drastic reforms. Since 1887 he has not advanced one step towards tb e goal he was so foud of pointing out to others. Furtherm ore, lie has carried ad m in ­ istrative m eddling to a p oint which has weakened his moral pow er, and set boards of m anagem ent by th e cars. Now, tho Cuief S ecretart has alwoys given out ilia t be was a warm advocate for popular election, and had ho carried b is expressed views into, practice, he would not venture to act th e p a rt of dictator. We are still cursed w ith nominee boards, aud so Jong a s these last, so long w ill m inisters of M r. F tsd’s stam p attem pt to unduly interfere with th eir actions. G iven committees of m anagem ent elected by the people of th eir own free choice, and no P rem iei o r Chief Secretary would dare interpose, except in ways permissible in all w ell regulated countries. W o ad m it th a t at his instigation sd elective body wub sought to be culled into being in conncctiou with tb e H obart G eneral H ospital, but like the tim id believer iu ghosts, Mr. F ysji was scared in a few days, and. straugo to say, one of the m isleading “ bogies” was a col league of bis own. M isshapen ai ihe bantling was, we did our best to commend it to the favorable tentiou of P arliam ent and th e country, feeling th at its deform ities m ight he lopped off, and th a t trial should be given. W e arc still w ithout a change, aud unless uominecism is struck upon th e bead and p ut out of life by tho electoral arm, it will continue to live to the barm of the whole Colony. If Mr. F tsh had bia will H obart and adjacent suburbs would bo saddled with another nominee board of w ider tcope than th e boards which now exist, and, consequently, m ore dangerous on th a t account. W e have heard many weak reasons assigned in Parliam ent and the Press in defence of foolish proposals, b u t it remained for m inisterial to u ters to furnish the w eakest yet advanced. T he ratepayers were told th a t expensi m acniuery was necessary in o rd e r to obtain inform ation as to th e proper drainage of a so-called m etropolitan area. The ozone of U pper D avey S treet and the lower region of th e H uod Road m ust have had a peculiar effect upon M inister and protege w hen they were ablo to evolve the idea of such a grand Intell gence Bureau. C hagrin m ust have quickly succeeded hope when a shout of derision was set up a t the bare mention of th e ir pr posterous, extravagant, cum bci’som c notions. T he scheme was so absurd that, without w aiting to see it kicked out of the House, th e little Bill was quietly sm othered, and not a cry was beard.

In certain directions boph geutleraen have* doue some service, hut they need not a tte m p t to magnify th eir efforts, because the bulk of th e im provem ents vsas ilirust upon them through a v ariety of channels. When a stern necessity arises for coping w ith a g rav e difficulty, fads and fancies are positively dangerous, resulting in w aste of time, waste of money, and Josn v f health.
