The Church of England Mission to New Guinea. A service for the purpose of bidding farewell to the Revs. A. A. Maclaren and Copeland King, missionaries, who are about to set forth for work in New Guinea, was held in St. Andrew's Cathedral on Wednesday night, says the Herald. The build- ing was almost filled, many of the clergy and promi- nent, laity being present. The Primate, Archdeacon King, and the Very Rev. the Dean, took part in the service. After the lessons had been read the Primate preached a sermon in which he bade fare- well and God-speed to the two ministers who were about to go into the mission-field. They were sent with prayer and benediction to pioneer work in a new spiritual field. The work of the Church was primarily an evangelistic and mission work. The The New Guinea mission was a special work for Australia. It had been much before the people during the time ho had been among them, and now after much preparation two brethren were about to set forth for the field. The texts on which he based his discourse were John j,, 9, " Have I not commanded you ? Be strong and of good courage ; be nob afraid, neither bo thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee wheresoever thou goest." Acts i., 8, " But ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is cone upon you." First Epistle St. John, i v., 14, " And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world."
