CHURCH OF ENGLAND ASSO CIATION. -4--C- Sin. EUGENE STOCKS' LESSON. Mr. Eugene Stock gave a most in teresting class lesson in the Y.M.C.A. Hall last week. The Bishop of Mel bourne presided at the meeting, which was held in connection with the Church of England Sunday School Association. The greatest interest was taken in the proceedings, the hall being filled by teachers and friends, who proved, by their presence, in full sympathy with the Sunday School movement. Mr. Stock, surrounded with a class of young lads, prcceeded with the model lesson, the subject of which was founded on the " Holy Ghost." By helpful Bible re ferences, clever inductive teaching, enriched by the thoughts and principles contained in the prayer-book, relating to the subject, a most interesting and deeply instructive lesson was the outcome. Mr. Stock has all the necessary qualifications of the successful teacher, whose success comes from an intimate knowledge of the Bible proofs,backedby carefulthought and well directed study. At the close of the lesson, for which high compli nients were paid Mr. Stock, the prizes won by the successful competitors at the recent yearly test examinations, were distributed. The arrangements of the meeting were admirably carried out, and reflected much credit on Mr. E. D. Puckle, the zealous and untiring hon. secretary.
