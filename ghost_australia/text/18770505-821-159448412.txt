. DIOCES^SYNOD." _ The ajmri^isetotonoftiieSynodof the Church "?Of England in the Diocese of AHel&ide; was opened by ,tiie -LordBishop at St. Peter's Cathedral on Tuesday morning, May 1, when the Hoi; Communion was administered. There was an attendance of about 50 of the clergy and Syndsmen, besides a ntunber of. other persons. The Bishop read the service, by the Very Eev. Dean. Unssell and the Yen/ Arch -deacon Marryat, and on its conclusion delivered the folio wing Pastohax ADDRESS, 1877. Dear Brethren-It would be to anticipate " the rest which remainetli for the people of <3od" if Christ's Church militant here on earth or any of its portions permanently enjoyed that state of peace which followed on the departure, of the converted Paul from Jerusalem to his own city of Tarsqs, The storm which burst on the Church in the martyrdom of Stephen had subsided. " Then had the Churches peace throughout all Jndea and Galilee and Samaria." Being built up and " walking in the fear of th3 lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost they were multiplied." But this peaceful state wa not of long duration. The adherents of the law and lovers of the righteousness of forms, so com patible with inward corruption, could not bu iate the purer spirituality of evangelic worship Again and again, therefore, the "Jews took counsel to kill Paul," because he preached " justification by faith in Christ," and " TTim ' crucified," not "the workB of the law." On the other hand the Imperial idolatry of Some would brook no interference with the State Pantheon, but punished-as treason the refusal of a Christian soldier to own by wearing a garland on his head the divinity of the Caesars'. Under such a condition of the civilized world there was no rest for the disciples of a religion which insisted on the exclusive worship of "one God" (of whom are all things), through one Lord Jesus Christ, the only mediator between God and man. The lapse of ages has not altered the spirit or character of the carnal mind. "Who can bring a clean thing out of an ' unclean," and thus the enmity against God -and His holy law is ever fresh in every child born into the world. " The flesh lusteth against the Spirit;" and in this contention between the spirit of truth and the spirit of evil the normal condition of the Church must be one cf unrest. In necessary contact with the world, and engaged in combating its carnal affections, we must expect " the contradiction of sinners." We must be conversant with troubles which our social relations necessarily involve. We cannot" go out of the world;" and though, like our divine Master, we must be " not of the world," yet, mixing with its concerns, we must through the grace of God keep ourselves from the evil of them. I cannot then in this assembly, repre senting as it does both the clerical and secular sides of the Church, dwell exclu sively on the inward and spiritual work which we trust is going on amongst us-that vital religion which is the saving of the soul. . I must also deal with questions affect ing the external relations of the Diocese, not only to the civil power, but to other com munities of Christians; and especially the branches of our Church united in the General Synod of the Australian Province. The special circumstances of the Diocese will form tho subject of my report to Synod. The late General Synod then claims your con sideration in the first place. The second assem bling of this body was looked forward to by the clergy ana laity with much interest, and not with out some apprehension. It was known that the action of the Church Assembly at Melbourne in creating that Diocese into a Province and ap pointing the Bishop to become its Metropolitan, had met with decided opposition from the Bishop of Sydney, who claimed under his letters patent to he Metropolitan of Australia and Tasmania. In teeth of the judgment of the Privy Council in Long v. Capetown, the Bishop of Sydney, ! acting on the opinion of Lord Bomilly, de murred to the action of the Church Assembly in Victoria. He considered it to be an invasion of his Metropolitan authority over the whole former Diocese of Melbourne, and declined to abandon his claim. He was nevertheless willing, .with the consent of the Crown and Archbishop of Canterbury, to resign that portion of his province. After much, discussion the Arch bishop of Canterbury consented to refer that question to his legal adviser, "the Official ' Principal." The answer communicated to the Bishop, and received since tne close of the General Synod, was, to the effect that he could not resign an authority which had no legal existence - the ori ginal grant by letters patent being ultra vires. Another question of considerable impor tance connected with the metropolitical authority was this, " Whether a right of veto on the consecration of a Bishop remained wjth the Primate after he had received from the other Bishops the confirmation of the person duly elected to a vacant see. That he should have the right of veto before submitting any name to the Episcopal College might possibly be a power not without advantage to the Church, though not contemplated in Conclusion No. 11, . of the Conference of Metropolitan Bishops in 1868\. But that he should set at naught, after having consulted his brethren, their deliberate decision, is surely not consistent with Christian humility, brotherly love, or sound sense. This question was unhappily left undecided in con sequence of an apparent determination orevail ing in Sydney to retain the Metropolitan letters patent jurisdiction as connected with that See. But the primacy of the present Bishop must cease at his demise. A third question, viz., rules for the formation of Hew " dioceses in Australia and Tasmania," was carried to a successful issue, and I have now to place this determination before you for your consideration and I trust approval. The remaining business was merely formal. First-Remitting to the House of Bishops the framing of rules of procedure for the trial of Bishops, in pursuance of Deter mination No. 1, Clause 8, of the General Synod of 1872. Secondly, the approval by the Synod of the Imperial Act of Uniformity Amendments Act. That the session should present such Meagre results might have been prognosticated from the first, when the Letters Patent Metro political Jurisdiction over all Australia and Tasmania was asserted by the Bishop of Sydney to be, so far as the Diocese of Sydney was con cerned, an insuperable obstacle to any action implying the freedom of the Colonial Dioceses from State supremacy. Considering, however, the widespread Colonial Empire of Great Britain, embracing variety of climate and soil and of the human race under heaven, it is unnatural that the Colonial Churches should be Btrictly tied up in their mode of worship by the supremacy of the Crown and Acts of the British Parliament regulating the Church of England and its endowments. Happily, I believe, for its vitality and efficiency, the Church in colonies which possess independent Legislatures has been declared to be not by law established. So far as legal authority conveyed by letters patent is concerned, the Metropolitanate of Sydney over the Dioceses of Australia and Tasmania never had, and therefore cannot have, any exis tence. The conviction, indeed, that such was the true state of the law led in the first General Synod to the establishment of the Primacy, the authority of which rests necessarily upon com pact among the dioceses. It lias been attempted, indeed, to view the erection of the See of Sydney and its subsequent division into diocese?, as the act of the Church itself inde pendent of the State. In pursuance of this theory the See of Canterbury has lately assumed patriarchal powers. An oath of obedience to ihe See of Canterbury has been exacted of late from the Bishops consecrated in England for the Australian Dioceses, and that without the assent of the Churches over which they are to preside. The Art also pf the Church Assembly of Victoria appointing the Bishop of Melbourne Metropolitan has been repudiated by the Bishop of Sydney, ns interfering with his metro political rights, legal or ecclesiastical. Such are some of the difficulties which connection of these dioceses with the Established Church of England as integral parts of it would introduce ; binding Us to rigid uniformity and compliance with its rubrics, as well as to whatever should emanate hereafter from the Houses of Convocation of Canterbury and York, when sanctioned by Parliament^ although the Colonial Churches have no voice or representative in either the one body or the other. It may be asked, perhaps, if each ?colony, when grouped into dioceses is to have its own Metropolitan and become a separate province, how is union and uniformity "an doctrine and worship to be preserved through out the Australian and other provinces of the Anglican Church ? With a common liturgy, TOmmon formularies of faith, a common TCible, and common spirit of., loyalty to the mother Church, there is little reason to fear that the Church in Australia or else 'Where wiU diverge from " the old paths." The constraining force of legal jurisdiction granted by the Crown has indeed ceased. It cannot be replaced by an oath of "due obedience" and reyerenc# to the Se® ql Captesbwyj on He^JistiopB of AustraBarilSees wi&odttlieTmow; ledge or assent of the Various provinoialChurcheq themselves.' And whois to determine what Is due "/orwhatcanorjcal in their obligation ? in the late general Synod the authority of a Nicene Cation 'was quoted, relating .to the then metro political cities of the Boman Empire, and it was argued that therefore the civil division of the British-Colon lal Empire should be strictly' followed in the erection of provinces and the' seat of Metropolitans.' It is obvious to -reply that Sydney is not the metropolis of Australia. The other colonies are equally autonomous. Accordingly the office of Primate was made per sonal, and not tied to any one city as,the metro polis of all Australia and Tasmania. Moreover, the subordination of the Australian Metropoli tans, first to their own Primate, and secondly to the quasi Patriarch of Canterbury, is a matter at any rate for compact, and not of civil or ecclesiastical decree. _ The legal claims of the Bishop of Sydney having now failed, the time is come for the adjustment of these relations. Had the See of Melbourne been filled at an earlier period the Synod would probably have been convened at Melbourne, and local feeling might possibly have less obstructed the discus sions. The real question, however, involved, lies deeper. " What is the connection between the branches of the Catholic and Apostolic Church, and what the due subordination of the several Sees." While the Church of Home claims for its chief pastor the right to give law to the City of Rome and to the world urbi et orbi, the various Churches »f the East and West, reformed or otherwise, simply regard the Bishop of that See as one of the College of Bishops of the Uni versal Church, "primus" in point of precedency, but inter pares as regards Episcopal authority. England's national independence of the Papacy and its reformed State Church emphasize this principle of Episcopal equality. To a general Synod of the Universal Church alone belongs the power of framing Canons (for against it " the gates of hell cannot prevail") morally binding on all Christians. Of course such Canons can have no legal force in any country without the consent of the civil power. The reformation of the Church in England pro ceeded on this principle; and in that fierce struggle for religious freedom both in matters of doctrine and of Church government, it may be, that the civil power encroached somewhat on the spiritual liberty of the Church. The appeal from the Bishop's Court in all ecclesias tical eases, many of which were of a mixed spiritual andtemix>ral character, was transferred from the Pope to the Crown. For more than 300 years this has been the admitted status of the Anglican Church. The Act 24 Henry VIII., c. 12, A.D. 1532, made the Upper House of Convocation the final Court of Appeal. " But 25 Henry VIII., c 19, and Elizabeth c. 1, were Acts for restraint of appeals to the See of Borne; and tho submission of the Clergy, and the appointment of Court of Delegates in the High Court of Chancery." In 1832 the powers of the Court of Delegates was transferred by 2 and 3 William IV., c. *92., to His Majesty in Council. Hence the Judicial Court of Privy Council, of which all Bishops, that is, being Privy Coun cillors, were made members by the Church Discipline Act of 3 and 4 Victoria, c. 86. This again has been superseded, as the final Court of Appeal by Her Majesty's "High Court of Justice," which fame into operation in Novem ber, 1875, in which the Bishops sit not as judges but as assessors. Under this system of law every Clergyman of the Church of England has placed himself by accepting any benefice in the Established Church, and it was for resistance to the procedure of this Court acting " by authority of Parliament" that the Rev. A. Tooth, of Hat cham, was lately suffering imprisonment. In conscientious resistance, as he believes, to a Court possessing no "spiritual" jurisdiction over " rites and ceremonies of the Church he ' ignores the decree of the Judge of the Court of Arches." To inhibit a priest, "a sacris" i.e., the per formance of his spiritual office, is not the proper right of a lay Court, but that is not a full statement of the case. He is inhibited from using in the church at Hatcham "rites and ceremonies" held to be unlawful according to the legal interpretation of the Rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer enacted by authority of Parliament. It is a question of violation of trust in the use of national ecclesiastical property. Such mixed questions, in which the laity are deeply inte rested, are rightly cognisable in Courts ecclesias- ? tieal instituted by the civil power. There are purely spiritual questions of which bishops are the judges by Divine appointment. It is late, indeed, in her history for the Church of England to affect absolute independence of State tribunals in such mixed questions of property and ceremonials. In purely spiritual matters, no doubt, such as doctrine, discipline, and rites or offices, the Church of Christ is entitled to perfect free dom. But the Anglican branch, having more than three centuries ago accepted State estab lishment and the support of law, cannot consistently object to the "authority of Parliament" by whieh the veiy Rubric was established, the legal interpretation of which is now disputed by Mr. Tooth. By propounding this view I must not be sup posed to argue that the Bishops and clergy should not be consulted in their Convocations before Acts of Parliament affecting divine worship and Ecclesiastical discipline are passed. On the other hand, I do not think that indivi dual clergymen who introduce innovations in the received Ritual of our Church on their own judgment in ^ teeth of the decisions of the highest Ecclesiastical Courts, and their refusing to obey constituted authority, will command the sympathy of the great body of the clergy and laity of our Church. It is unfortunate at a period when the whole mind and energy of the Church should be directed to the defence and propagation of the Faith, we are compelled to ask afresh which are the first principles of Church organization, apostolic and scriptural? Not only with re ference to its numerous and widely- spread branches must that question be resolved, but alsothe relation in which they stand towards Christian bodies who, in the appointment of their ministry and other important matters, have severed their connection from the tradi tionary Catholicrule. The questionis daily forced on our attention-Who are " lawfully called and sent ministers into the Lord s vineyard" ac cording to the principles laid down in our formularies ? In our Ember Week prayers we affirm that " Divine Providence has appointed divers orders in the Church." In the preface to the Ordinal we learn what these orders are; and in the 23rd Article we assert that none others can " lawfully take upon themselves theadministration of the "Word and Sacraments." Herein South Australia, bound as the Anglican clergy are by these solemn declarations, they are accused of invading the liberty of the Christian ministry, violating Christian brother hood, intolerant isolation from accredited ministers ; because adhering to the plain princi ples of the Church of England they cannot con sistently recognise as duly called ahd sent those Simply elected by their people; and accordingly designated pastors of particular congregations. It is not a question of personal qualification. We freely admit the eminence of some and the excellence of others; but still the question remains behind, a How were they' called and by whom sent." The ministry of our Church undoubtedly claims to stand on a higher tra ditionary basis. It claims to exercise an authority to preach and administer the sacra ments derivgd through successive ages link by link from the Apostles or Apostolic men, who succeeded them in their "ordinary" powers as rulers of the Church, Catholic and Apostolic. The preface to the Ordinal in the Book of Com mon Prayer makes this evident, for the Ordinal w:-:s expressly confirmed in 1562 by the 36th Article, and enforced by Act of Parliament in 1566\. It was again confirmed in 1571, and sub sequently to the Restoration it was made law, A.D. 1662, by the Act of Uniformity. The question of course remains whether the principles here affirmed are Scriptural and Apos tolic; but ministers of the Church of Englaud, believing them to be so, have been " called arid sent" under these declarations. It is difficult then to see the justice or charity of designating them an intolerant and domineering priesthood, " forging fetters on Christian liberty," and " inimical to Christian brotherhood." If the principles on which they profess to act are un scriptural denounce them if you please; demand, as you have a right, that every one whom an orthodox body of fellow Christians hold to be their duly appointed-minister shall be treated with the personal respect due to his office; but neither the faith nor the practice of the ApostoHc age must be sacrificed to complaisance. Let every one be fully per suaded in his «wq mind; for whatsoever is not. of faith is sin. l-1 ^"^"eh of Scotland an Apos tolical succession has been carried on, although it be through the Order of Presbyters. In the Methodist bodies the link ha* been broken, and the present ministry derive no authority from or through the Orders of the Rev. John Wesley or his episcopally-ordained fellow workers. Like the Congregationalists and other Protestant bodies, the congregation, through the agency of the Conference, exercises the right wdaiaing ministers, Wesley him self ln3eed originated, an Episcopate for Amkica with ao oetter tight to do so thuithe Conference to ordain -ministers. On this point theChureh ofEngland must of necessity1 be. isolated from other Protestant bodies, and her ministers cannot fairly be charged with sectarianism by those who' having first separated themselves ' from the . Anglo Catholic Church, now seek to overthrow her I will admit at" once^ that so for from taking a Pharisaic pride in this isolation, it is, I believe, painful to eviery clergyman with a Christian heart. Nothing short of a conscien tious conviction that we are following the Apostolic practice and Catholic tradition, and, above all, the Scriptural teaching of St. Paul's Pastoral Epistles, that makes as, in spite of obloquy, cling to this historic rule of Episcopal ordination. As I read my Bible and Church History, I find that Paul and Barnabas ordained " elders," not the " saints" or " disciples." For this purpose, too, Titus was left by St. Paul in Crete "to ordain elders in every city"-(Titus, 1\. iv.) It is difficult, then, to see how, because we hold the tradition which St. Paul delivered, we are infringing on the "liberty" of other Christians to do with out Apostolic orders. We hinder them not; but when they require us to accept their self assumed authority it is really an infringement of our liberty " to hold fast" the custom of the Churches from the Apostolic age. Nor- does an apostolically-derived autho rity assert or imply the possession of any supernatural powers. The Sacra ments, we say, are "generally necessary to salvation," but no Anglican clergyman would affirm that without them none can be saved. The malefactor on the Cross though not baptized was admitted to Paradise;' nevertheless, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved" stands fast as the' rule ; nor will we despise Apostolic authority given to administer the ordinances of Christ. In my address last year I endea voured to show how the regular organiza tion of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church by the Apostles, with its divinely instituted Sacraments and appointed ministry, served to substantiate the facts on which the Gospel is founded, viz., our Lord's death and resurrection, His ascension, the the coming of the Holy Ghost; and to authenti cate also the New Testament Scriptures as well as preserve them. In cleaving then to an Apostolically instituted ministry, the Anglican clergy believe that they are seeming the best external evidence to the Scriptures and doctrine of Christ, viz., the contemporaneous and un broken testimony of the living Church to the ground facts of the faith. Sorry we arc when an isolation thus originated excites the anger of Christian men, but .we dare not surrender the out works of the fortress raised for the defence and propagation of the Gospel. Bather," being defamed let us entreat.' Nor are the clergy with greater degree of justice accused of violating Christian brotherhood by declining to ' recognise un authorized ministrations. Unquestionably all Christian courtesy ought to be shown towards such Evangelists, "for he that is not against us is with us;" but to break the order of the Church, sanctioned by a continuity of more than 1800 years, involves a serious respon sibility. At all events, the Episcopal Church all over the world, not the individual minister, must bear the charge of exclusiveness and isola tion. Nor, so far as I am aware, has it led to the violation of brotherhood such as that in volved in forbidding an eminent and respected minister to approach the Lord's Table, when he would have reverently communicated in the chapel of another sect! The Highest Church man in the Diocese would not, I believe, havfe repelled from that Holy Ordinance any well known and respectable minister, though not of us. As the Rev. Rowland Hill on a like occa sion is reported to have said-"Your table! I thought it was the Lord's." It is indeed sad to think that the "one bread," which is the symbol of unity, should be thus turned into the instrument of separation. Popu lar ordination no donbt secures pnlpit ability, but it also has a manifest tendency to produce self-sufficiency and a self-estimation which sometimes is "puffed up, and behaveth unseemly." The popular prophet is certainly not less likely to be thus affected than the Priest, whose delegated official authority makes him the servant, not ruler of the congregation which he instructs. Though we cannot give up a Ministry founded as we believe on the Apostolic commission, we may yet pray to be kept from " priestly arrogance" and unchris tian " intolerancewaiting patiently until the duty and the possibility of being visibly one in Christ, as members of this one body shall be recognised as the more scriptural and more excellent way. On such union how much does the effectiveness of the Church's witness to a heathen world depend? Meanwhile let us regard every one who is on the Lord's side spiritually as brothers in Christ. Let us rejoice that " every way Christ is preached" without patching up a hollow alliance and nominal union at the expense of sincerity and apostolic tradition. That tradi tion combined with Scripture is our best safe guard against the novel dogmatism of Rome and self-assertion of individual opinion. In the name of liberty without licence, brother hood without compromise, spiritual equality without insubordination, let us stand on the old foundations, the Catholic and Apostolic Church; the immovable basis of the true communion of the saints on earth.

' It was unanimously resolved,"on the motion of the Rev. S. GEEEX, ' seconded- by Dean RUSSELL-"That Standing OrderNo.54bere pealed, and the following substituted:--'Select Committees shall consist of five - members, un less by leave of Synod, and shall be elected by nomination, or, in case more thin the number required are nominated, by ballot; and iu'all cases the consent to act of the persons nominated shall be first obtained. All such Committees shall be instructed to report, either to Synod or to the Standing Committee.'* ELECTION COMMITTEE'S BEPORT. The Committee called attention to the fact that All Saints' (Hindmarsh), St. Margaret's (Woodville), St. John's (Auburn), and St John's (Mount Pleasant), had each returned two Synodmen, and expressed the opinion that in each case the second representative could only be admitted by express permission of Synod: also that it was extremely undesirable that the Chairman of a Vestry should allow any altera tion in the number of regulations without reference to Synod, and that the same regula tions should be made as far as representation was concerned with respect to the. separation of Churches or parishes which had hitherto been united or formed part of a united parish. Appeals were lodged on behalf of each of the Churches alluded to, which were referred to the new Election Committee. ELECTION COMMITTEE. The Election Committee was appointed as follows:-Dean Russell, Archdeacon Marzyat, Messrs. N. Blyth, M.P., H. Scott, and C. B. Young. STATE OF THE BIOCESE. The Bishop read the following report: In my report last year I remarked that under the voluntary system, without help from " with out, local resources would be found inadequate to supply the scattered population with minis terial services." As time has gone on the popu lation by selection of land in the agricultural areas has become more dispersed, and the difficulty has increased. While the selectors with scanty means (for the most part) are making homes for themselves, building dwellings, enclosing lands, procuring cattle or machinery, enduring often much hardship and poor fare, it is unreasonable to expect more than scanty offerings for the support of a ministry or towards building a place of worship. A bad season may frustrate all their hopes, and throw thera back for years in the struggle for compe tence. It is incumbent, then, on the Church at large, as far as possible, to provide for its people, and to go after the flock settled in the wider ness. Missionary Clergy.-Men of zeal, energy, and activity are needed for this work; and, of course, a considerable fund for their support. I repeat then my words of last year, "that the most needful work of the Synod at this time was in this direction, viz., to increase the < Home Mission Fund' for the support of purely mis sionary clergy." Some steps by means of a Com mittee were taken in furtherance of this object as regards the Broughton areas, which have proved successful, but there is need of more systematic labour to carry on this important work. By Fundamental Provision No. 18, the spiritual care of members of the Church not re siding in any parish rests with the Bishop. The extension of the agricultural areas, ana the migration in part of the population from the old cures, has rendered this work so onerous as well as extensive, that I find myself, as years advance, unable to cope with it satisfac torily. In defining the missions, ap portioning Church funds towards the support of the missionaries, procuring the latter from England or elsewhere, ascertaining their special suitability for the localities in which they are to work, it is very desirable that the Bishop or his Vicar-General, who in his absence administers the Diocese, should have assistance. I suggest for this purpose a permanent Board or Council of Advice, with which he may take counsel, and so avoid " that any man should blame him in the abundance which is adminis tered by him." Churchmen generally would more readily contribute to a Mission Fund thus managed and apportioned. After giving the subject full consideration I propose to constitute this body thus:-I, The Vicar-General, 2 members (1 clerical and 1 lay) elected annually by Standing Com mittee ; 1, the Attorneys of the S.P.G. and that of the Directors of the Church of England Endowment Society should be members of the Standing Committee. The Standing or Execu tive Committee of Synod would thus be joined with the other managers of Church funds, who at present act independently. The Bishop would be fortified by the advice of all those bodies, {and so receive thejnoralfsupport of the whole Church in his arrangements for the spiritual care of the members of the Church not residing in any parish." It is desirable that all the members of the Council should be on the Standing Committee, and it is most probable | that four out of the five will always be so. To make it compulsory would perhaps throw from time to time a difficulty in the way of including the Attorneys of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel or the Church of England Endowment Society Directors. Want of Clergy.-During the absence of Mr. Morse, invalided in England, of Revs. H. Williams and H.M. Pollitt in Tasmania, as well as the removal of the Rev. J. A. Boake to the Diocese of Goulbourn, I experienced very great difficulty inkeeping the South Yorke's Peninsula Mission, the Broughton Areas Churches, Strath albyn, the Meadows, Clare, and other places even partially supplied with the services of a minister. Sly thanks are due to the Revs. Henry J. Poole and J. H. Corvan, who fre quently travelled long distances with this object. On the return of Mr. Morse in restored health the Rev. J. H. Corvan assumed the pastorate of Moonta and Maitland, but his zeal and single- minded energy will always be kindly remembered in South Yorke's Peninsula; that mission being now in charge of the Rev. C. Morse. Incumbencies.-The important township and district of Clare has been filled by the Rev. R. B. "Webb, and the opportune arrival of the Rev. A. Sells has enabled me to fill up the vacant cure of Lyndoch, Williamstown, and Pewsey Vale. The Rev. Arthur Dendy, D.D., has since joined the diocese, raising the number of Anglican clergy at this time to 40, through the aid voted for this purpose by the Church of England Endowment Society. Missionary Districts.-Yorke's Peninsula is now once more regularly visited, being placed under the pastoral superintendence of the Rev. C. Morse, many of whose former parishioners have migrated to those Areas. At the earliest period possible this district must receive a resi dent missionary. For the Laura District-embracing James town, Gladstone, and (provisionally) Port Pirie -a resident ordained minister is urgently re quired. At each of these places churches have been built, congregations have been formed, and a fair amount of local support promised, to which grants from a General Mission Fund must for a time at least be made. That the standard of education for the ministry should be lowered in order to multiply clergy is very much to be depre cated; but it is impossible to obtain men intellectually as well as morally and spiritually fit to influence congregations without offering somewhat more than a bare subsistence. Pro visionally at least it is better that one educated clergyman, assisted by lay readers, should super intend a large district than to multiply the number of ill-educated and unlearned ministers for its service. Candidates for Holy Orders. - We hare, I am happy to say, an increasing number of young men desirous of being labourers in the .Lord's vineyard. We are warned, nevertheless, against placing "a novice" in the seat of a ruling Elder. Wben a man " has put his hand to the plough there is no turning ba< k \ and he who gives offence by ignorance, negligence, or want of spiritual interest in the work of God, is an enemy to religion and to the Hester whom he professes to serve. Theological Students.-In connection with this subject I may mention the name of Edward Spieer, who, by the help of grants from this diocese and the Society for promoting Christian Knowledge, has been able to complete his Uni versity course at Melbourne, and has finally obtained first honours in Science there. The advantage of University lectures will be offered henceforth in our midst, and as far as possible our theological students be required to avail themselves of the professoiral education thus offere'd to them. Statistics.-There is nothing especially worthy of remark in the parochial statistics. The re turns have been very inconveniently and more than usually delayed. They show that where ever the clergy are diligent and discreet there is no lack of interest in her services, or alienation from the principles of our Church. Vestries.-Judging from the reports published of the Vestry meetings the parishes are in a state of prosperity, peace, and union'; while their Anniversary Sunday-school festivals indi catd the unabated vigour of the teachers and attachment of the scholars. That of Trinity beirg its 40th was ^celebrated with a warmth and heartiness pleasant to notice. | Chnrch~BwU d itigI have observed withsatis factidn/th&tin; rsix plaices new buildings, of additions to existing churches have been con templated, if not actually- commenced, viz.-ai Mount J/jfty, Mitcham, MagiHt Walkerville, this Burra, and ' Mount Gambler, while Trinity Church, Adelaide, is about to be reseated. >Ax Moontathe liabilities on the church have been much reduced; at Enfield and the Meadows cleared off. Cathedral.-It has been a great satisfaction to me that to-day the Synod assembled in the Cathedral for the first time. Three beautitul memorial windows have lately been erected one to the memory of the child of Sir A. and Lady Musgrave, another to that of Governor Sir H. Fox Young (presented by Lady Young), and a third to commemorate our late friend Richard Bo wen Colley, cut off in the flower of manhood. He has nevertheless left a name . renowned for hearty and sound judging,Church manship, and sincere zeal in the cause of religion. I cannot _ help before quitting this subject expressing my thankfulness that I have been permitted in the providence of God with slender means to bring on thus far towards com pletion the beautiful building in which wo assembled this morning. I hardly know how it grew to its present dimensions. By the Irfnri co-operation and liberality of many friends the work has been accomplished. Oa the building itself there is absolutely no debt whatever. And here I must not fail to specify the beautiful Holy Communion table and Bishop's chair, the latter the gift of St. George's, Magill; the former of Rev. S. and Mis. Green. But the other fittings, modest as they are, remain yet an obli gation to be liquidated. A debt of £500 has thus been incurred resting on a few individuals, whose liability is to be removed by the «nnn*l subscription of 5s. by the members of the Cathe dral Aid Association. I would earnestly ask of the members of this Synod to procure additional members to this Association. A few hundred names would speedily extinguish this debt to the Bank of South Australia at a trifling cost to the individual subscribers. Other friends have already undertaken to collect for the organ, the erection of which, and other expenses included, make a debt, which has yet to be met, of about £600. When the times are more propitious I doubt not that the same zealous friends who last year collected about £800 towards the instrument will succeed in finishing the good work to which they have set their hand. And here, before I close this review, I must briefly touch upon one painful topic: the absence of our respected Secretary, Frederic Wick steed. We miss to-day among us his face, so familiar to us all and endeared through many a long year, during which he has assiduously pro moted and watched over the institution and progress of this Synod. To his patience, per severance, and kindly influence it has attained to much of its present usefulness, It has pleased God to visit him with infirmity which disables him from continuing his labours; but I am much mistaken if we and those nume rous friends whom a long life of consistent and able conduct have secured for him will not be ready to show sympathy for him in his affliction and relieve those dependent upon his labours in the difficulties which that affliction may, per haps, throw around them. Meanwhile, during the five months in which he has been unable to give his personal superintendence, the general business of the Church Office has been carried on satisfactorily by his able assistant, Mr. H. S. Anthony, acting as pro Secretary. Religious Thought.-Amid all the unrest and unsettled tone of religious opinion occa sioned by materializing science and unsparing criticism, I nevertheless am persuaded that a fijmer because more intelligent faith is growing up in those who frequent our churches and love the Book of Common Prayer. Indeed, men of understanding will never surrender the glorious Gospel of the " Grace of God" for the blank guess of an unproved atomic evolution. Scoff who may, we shall hold on the even tenor of our way, linked, as we believe, by our Ministry ' and Sacraments, our Creeds and Scriptures, our Liturgy and Psalmody, with the Apostolic Churches, as well as those " Holy Apostles and Prophets" on whom our Lord deigned to breathe on the evening of His Resurrection Day, whom he sent forth as the Father had sent Himself-with plenary authority to found His Church : to remit or retain sins. Having this historic basis for the " things which are most surely believed among us," we feel in the living Catholic and Apostolic Church, dating from the Apostles themselves, we have a sure guarantee for the authenticity and genuineness of the New Testament Scriptures, as well as in the ancient Creeds, the doctrine of which those Scriptures confirm. They furnish us with the best safe guard p gainst the novelties of Roman dogma tism and of ultra-Protestant private opinion. Content with the assurance thus provided, we dwell securely under the shadow of that Olive Tree into which the Gentile branches were grafted when the natural branches were broken off; and we wait patiently for the appointed time when the restored unity of the Universal Church shall be a witness to the world that God hath sent His Son to take away its sins, who is over all, God blessed for ever. STANDING COMMITTEE'S BEFOET. 1\. The Standing Committee submit to Synod their annual report upon the different matters referred to them and to Special Committees by the last Synod, and upon those which have otherwise occupied their attention during the past year.

Superannuation Fund Committee.-They have received the report of this Sub-Committee, which, after slight amend ment, they have approved, printed, and circu lated, and now submit for adoption by Synod. Steps have been taken to commence the fund by forwarding copies of the report to the clergy, with a request that they would bring the subject under the notice of their ve^ries, and take steps to collect contributions to the Capital Guaran tee Fund, and instruct their Synodsmen to re port to Synod what has been done. The attorneys of the S.P.G. have determined to supplement the subscriptions received pound for pound up to a maximum of £100 per annum for three years.

St Mary's, the Burra, and St. John's, Adelaide.-A Sub-Committee was ap pointed to enquire into the matters referred to in the memorial of the miuister and Church wardens of St. Mary's, the Burra, and they reported that they had forwarded to the Churchwardens of St. John's copies of the memorial from St. Mary's, and of the resolu tions of Synod and of tha Standing Committee thereon; but the Churchwardens of St. John's declined to consent to the arbitration of the Standing Committee or of the Sub-Committee. The. Sub-Committee under these circumstances recommended that the matter of the memorial be not enquired into. The Standing Com mittee then examined all letters and documents referring to the matter submitted to them by the representatives of St. Mary's, and passed the following resolution-"That the Standing Committee having beard the letters and evi dence offered by the Vestry of St. Mary's, the Burra, with reference to tbeir claim on St. John's, decline to. take any further steps in the matter. 7\. Min. 954. Yestry Record Books.-They are happy to be able to report that their efforts to. make the use of Vestry Record Books general throughout the Diocese have been quite suc cessful, and all of those distributed have been paid for except three. OTHER BUSINESS. The Committee now proceed to those matters which have claimed from time to time during the past year their attention:-? 8\. Assessment.-They report that they esti mate the expenditure for the ensuing year as follows:-Secretary's salary, £150; printing, £50; postage, £15; advertising, £10; sundries, £10 ; total £235. They recommend the same rate of assessment of 8d- per sitting less, as per Statistical Returns of 1875-6 (for the litt vide Appendix C), amounting to £243 18s. The assessment for the oast year has been sufficient to cover the expenditure and laaye a balane# ia hand Uff, 9 -9: Schedule C.-In accordance with the reso lotion of Synod, limiting iht timB donng wliich Churchns ?Kali receivie grant-in-aid accordingto the scale of Churches in Schedule A (see Min. 675,M%y8,1874),the following Churches will be placed in Schedule O after.

Both these Churches received notice to this ": effect in March last, and have appealed against 'the transfer. Their case is therefore submitted to the consideration of Synod. . 10. Clergy Widow and Orphan FoncL-The Trustees publish a'ptogress account from June 30,1876, to date. A clergyman -who had held the Bishop's licence for a period of 15 years having left the diocese, and having requested to be allowed to continue a subscriber to' the Fond, your Committee have obtained an opinion from their solicitors that so long as a clergyman subscribing to the Fund* is an incumbent, whether within or withont the diocese, he muslb make the annual collection, as provided by Clause 4 of the Trust Deed. They are happy to be able to state that all arrears of premiums have been paid up. 11\. Table of Collections, &c.-The; Committee present (vide Appendix G) a table showing the amounts received from each Church for the various funds, the amounts paid as grants in aid of clerical incomes, and the proposed assess ment for 1877-8.

Grants in aid of Clerical Incomes 490 5 3... 399 14 0 Your Committee observe with regret a slight ; falling off in the offertories for the Home Mission and the Mission for the Heathen, not withstanding the fact that the number of con tributing Churches has increased. They express the hope that the clergy will urge the claims of these funds on their congregations during the coming year. 12\. Home Mission Fund.-They are happy to report that they have again paid the grant-in aid of clerical incomes at full scale. They have to call the attention of the Churches in Schedule A to the fact that, before any giant can be made on account of Stipend Fund or Offertory, there must be a collection at every Sunday service. 13\. Mission to the Heathen.-They have voted £6 6s. 5d. out of that portion of the funds placed at their disposal, towards the repayment of the balance due to the Treasurer of the Lace pede Bay Native Mission, which, together with a similar grant to the Trustees of the Poonindie Native Institution, liquidated the debt due when the Mission was finally closed last year. The balance of the funds they have voted to the Melanesian Mission. 14\. Endowment of Churches.-They report that during the past year two endowments have been effected under the amended system adopted by the Synod during its last session, viz., St. Mary's, Penola, £260, and St. Augus tin's, Port Victor, £500; the Incorporated Church of England Endowment Society have contributed £150 towards the former and £300 towards the latter. 15\. Schedule A.--No Churches have been added to this Schedule during the past year. 16\. Statistical Returns.-Your Committee are happy to be able to state that the Statistical Returns have been received from all the Churches, with the exception of a few in which there have been no regular ministrations; but they regret that twenny-three were not for warded until a period so late as to occasion great inconvenience. 17\.

Colley and W. L. Eeid, the executors of the will of the "ate Edmund Cullen, have paid to the Treasurer the sum of £400 legacy, and £13 5s. 5d. interest, bequeathed by the will to the Synod incorpo rated unconditionally. The Synod will there tore nave to decide as to its disposal. Your Committee desire to record their thankful sense of the charitable care for the Church manifested by this bequest of the late Edmund Cullen. 19\. Appointment of Sub-Committees. - Inas much as a difficulty ha6 occasionally been felt at the meetings of Synod with respect to the mode of appointing Select Committees, the Standing Committee recommend that Standing Order No. 54 be altered to read as follows:-" Select Com mittees shall consist of five members unless by leave of Synod, and shall be elected by nomina tion, or in case more than the number required I are nominated, by ballot; and in all cases the consent to act of the persons nominated be first obtained.

Boundaries of St. Paul's, Port Adelaide, St. Margaret's, Woodville, and All Saints, Hind marsh.-In consequence of a letter addressed to your Committee by the Vestry of St. Margaret's, Woodville, a Sub-Committee was appointed to consider this subject.

At the same time the Standing Committee gave its sanction to a series of jubilee services to be held in the several churches, at which offertories should be made, for the purpose of presenting His Lordship with an Eagle Lectern for the Cathedral. To both these presentations the Bishop returned replies, expressing his gratifica tion, and reciprocating the kind feelings which bad dictated tfaem. 24\. Illness of the Secretary. -It is with ex treme regret the Committee have to report that they have been deprived, through illness, of the assistance of your Secretary, Mr. F. Wicksteed, for some four months. Great sympathy has been felt, and leave of absence has been given in the hope that his strength may be restored. Mr. H. S. Anthony has performed the duties of the office as Acting-Secretary. 25\. Standing Council of Advice.-The Com mittee wish to include in 'their report the statement that at a recent meeting the Lord Bishop informed tbem that the affairs oE the diocese had now attained such magnitude that he thought it would be advisable to appoint a Standing Council of Advice to assist hiin with their advice in matters at present not specially . provided for, and suggested that it should con sist of five members, two to be appointed by the Standing Committee, one by the attorneys of the S.P.G., one by the Incorporated Church of England Endowment Society, and the Vicar General to be the fifth.

Circulars have been sent to all old subscribers, to superintendents of Sunday Schools, and to ministers of suburban parishes, and collecting cards have been distributed; but in conse quence of the general failure of the harvest it was deemed expedient to suspend for a season active and general operations .throughout the diocese. In consequence of the beginning thus made, and the collecting cards that have been issued, increased subscriptions have already been received from the following Sunday Schools:-Holy Trinity and St. Paul's, Ade laide ; St, Peter's, Glenelg; and Christ Church, Yankalilla. St. John's Sunday School, Auburn, had already sent in a contribution. It is inte resting to observe that the Dorcas Sewing-Class of Native Women at Poonindie has sent in £2. The Committee earnestly trust that during the ensuing year the Melanesian Mission work may have a leading place given to it in our Sunday Schools. Your Committee have during the past year remitted the sum of £225>to the authorities of the Mission at Auckland. A. Bi RUSSELL, Chairman. THEOLOGICAL AND ECCLESIASTICAL LIBRARY COMMITTEE'S REPORT.

Pollitt, and Mr. Anthony, were ap pointed a Committee to edit the report of SyLod. CLERGY ANNUITY FUND. |Mr. N. BLTTH, M.P., moved, and Mr. J. THORNLEY seconded-" That in accordance with the report of the Superannuation Fund Committee a fuud be commenced, to be called the Clergy Annuity Fund, and that the rules and regulations be as proposed by the Committee." The Bev. T. FIELD expressed the opinion that the clergy should not be called upon to contribute towards such a fund, but that if it were established it should be by the laity and applied to the relief of the aged clergy. The Bev. E. T. HOWELL, whilst differing from Mr. Field, said that judging from what he had heard in his own parish the laity would cheer fully join in contributing to the fund. Synod then went into Committee to consider the details of the Committee's report. The fuud is intended for the relief of clergymen who m iy be permanently incapacitated by age or by mental or physical infirmity by providing an annuity which it was hoped would* not^be less than £50 per annum. It was stated that the Society for the Propa gation of the Gospel would contribute for three years pound for pound subscribed. It was decided that a Capital Guarantee Fuud be raised of not less than £1,500; that the whole offertory of one Sunday in the year in every congregation be appropriated to the fuud and available for income when there are recipients for the fund, until which time the offertory form part of the Guarantee Fund; and that no annuities be granted until the Gaurantee . Fund shall have reached a minimum sum of £1.000. Ihe Synod adjourned at half-past 6 for an horr. E-raxiNG SITTING. CLERGY ANNUITY FUND.

The Lord Bishop took the chair at 11 -o'clock, and read prayers. THE NEW ELECTION COMMITTKB. The Committee presented the following re port, which was adopted on the motion of Dean Kossell, seconded by Mr. J. Williams:-"The Election Committee have had under their con sideration the several appeals made against the' decision of the previous Committee in reference to _ election returns. They report that All Saint's,: Hindmarsh, being an independent parish, providing a reasonable income to itft minister, is entitled to two representatives. They therefore recommend that Sir. Trapman's name be placed on the roll. That St. Margaret's, 'Woodvilie, is not at present in the position to entitle it to send two representatives to Synod, and that therefore Mr. Connor's name has been rightly entered on the roll as their sole repre sentative. The Committee having ascertained that the double return for St. John's, Mount Pleasant, arose from the Incumbent having received erroneous information, they report that this Church forming part of the united parish, consisting of two or more Churches, is entitled to only one representative. They report that St. John's, Auburn, being a country parish with one Church, is entitled to two representatives, and they therefore recommend that the name of Mr. J. S. Anthony be added to the roll. The Committee call the attention of the Synod to the two concluding sentences of the previous Election Committee's report." THE THEOLOGICAL LIBRAE?. DeanKussEtL moved-'. That the Theological Library be commended to the support of the members of the Church throughout the diocese." In support of the resolution the Very Rev. Dean said that the library had ah extensive sphere of usefulness, as books bordering between theology and tcience were now very eagerly read by laymen as well as clergymen, and in his opinion the reduction of the subscription-fae to half a guinea would greatly encourage membership. The Rev. H. M. POLLITT seconded the resolu tion, which was forthwith carried. It was further resolved, on the motion of the Rev. A. HOKNEK, seconded by Mr. N. BLTTH M That it be an instruction to the Library Com mittee to consider if a regulation can be made that lay readers may have free access to the Theological Library." EXERCISE OF PATRONAGE IN COU9OTAL DIOCESES. The Rev. S. GHEEN moved, and the Rev. H. HOWTTT seconded-" That a Sub- Committee be appointed to enquire into the provisions for the exercise of patronage in this and other Colonial Dioceses, and to make such recommendations as they may deem advisable or necessary. To re port to Standing Committee." Carried. The following Sub-Committee was appointed: -Dean Russell, Archdeacon Marryat, Rev. S. Green, and Messrs. J. Williams and A. Macgeorge. The Synod at 12.30 adjourned till 6 p.m.
