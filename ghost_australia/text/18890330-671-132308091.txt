li'! COMMON SENSE AndI COMMON .courtesy,:' T0 THEEDITOB. SiK,—Will;you allow me to express in my own1 name, and; by their request inthe name o£ my Sunday afternoon class of men, who are at, present studying the subject of baptism, regret afc'tha want 'of courtesy aDd ' consideration shown by your correspondent 'Common Surisoi' for tho cherished convictions' of christians, whom be calls-V our baptist friends, both ana and pajdo.' i ? 1 : 'His ' good story, ' 'Olo Slokum,' and '? groat unwashed,' introduces -an element' :of vulgarity and irreverence, which is as un necessary and 'profitless,' as it is painful, i I quite agrafe ?vith the ' wisdom and propriety of your exoluding from your pages' a discussion, on baptism, and' tho language in which you expressed 1 your determination ' to do so, : was sueti as becomes a' respectablci journal. And had ' Common Sense' expressed his sympathy, with; you, and' given it as his opinion that baptism is a ' flat, stale and unprolitablo ques tion,' hu might still have done so, without ' Olo Slokum.' There is no sadder feature, aboiit the life of 'our youug community -than the tondoncy that exists to drown everything in* ridicule. 1 A' people which doo3 not treat the donvictions of men and communities with ro 8p6ot and ? ;courtesy, 'is fiist tending toward a . state of mind for which nothing is sacrudi for which'lifd is a Btnister joke, and in the end'the horrid' smile of despair. I do not attribute any intentional unkiodness or ? want of courtesy to ' Common Sense j' and' I hope_ that he may receive these remarks ;in tho kindly spirit in which they are made. . I would remind him that all branches 'of tlie i christian church, wUethor they '':make disciple8;:bapti7,ing:.i. . teaching,' or teaohing ;! . .' 'baptizing, believe that Jesus Christ said !? 'Make disciples' of all ; the nations; baptlsiinglthem into the name of tho Father and of tho Son arid of 'the Holy Ghost teaching- thom- to- observe all- things whatsoever, I comman(lcd.,you, (Matt. xxviii.: ' .J!l,'20.)„'.Tourj. &q.;', ' ; v ;»^BWVN;;AKqiIDALX':;; ; .^Iarci'i_27, 1889.'.', , t; , . ; j ' u j'.'.'.', ' Huttori ?
