FHOM THE BLACK HOCKS. (FROM AIL THE YEAK BOUND.) ' ; '.' ( Continued from last week .) ? At night I was startled. I had caught as usual, several small eels, and placed them on the roof of my hut, to be ready for my morning's, fistiipg. In the middle of the night I was aroused by heaving a strange scratching scrambling noise upon, the roof.' It was with no small trepidation . that I ventured out to see what it was. The mgnt was very uanc, ana ine urge uung x saw was were two fiery balls of light glaring at me from the top, pr the hut; next moment, a black obj ect flew at me. I stooped suddenly, and the animal went over me with a loud hiss, and disap-' peared in the darkness. It was a large black cat. . How it came there, I know not. I had never.seen it before and never saw it afterwards, although I heard it once or twice wailing dismally in the forest. \ . Of the .next two or three days. I have a very confused recollection. , , I remember wandering about all day, seeking rest and finding none, careless, heedless, hopeless. It was during. this time, I doubt not, that I lost my reckoning; for somehow or other I found that I had lost three days. ', ...: , ,, / '.-? ? ,.??., -.._. : ??... : ... .' Hov; long this state might have continued I ; cannot tell, but it was most mercifully diverted in the following way. I had penetrated deeper into the forest one day than I had ever ventured before, where I came to a rather abrupt gully ; here I stumbled over a tree root, and rolled down a descent. 'When! recovered my self I.got on my feet and looked round; I had1 rolled into the midst of some tall plants, -with a broadish leaf, long, entire, and. smooth, that felt sticky or glutinous, when touched, and with a duBky- colored flower. It was lobacco. A coarse, bitter kind, but still it was tobacco. Eagerly I gathered, all 1 1 could find, and then retraced my 8tepsi As soon as I arrived at home, I hung up my;tobacco leaves on a long string of flax, inside my, hut. ; I then set my witB to work, to invent a pipe, in which I at last rudely succeeded. How greatacomfort.it was, no words of mine could adequately tell. ,.:.-'.??? One thing that more than any other impressed my mind with the utter solitude of the island on which I .was cast, was the absence of animal life, and the silence. I had seen; during several weeks' residence, little; or no traces of life be yond the solitary instance of the wild cat, which had probably, been thrown overboard or had swum ashore from some passing ship. Thf» oniy other living things I had yet seen, except birds, were lizards. Wild pigeons abounded. I made about twenty snares to catch some. For several days, I did not succeed, and I had almost de spaired, when one day, to my great delight, a couple were caught. How eagerly I cooked, them, and the enjoyment I had in eating them 1 need not describe. I afterwards took several more, securing altogether during the time I was on the island, fourteen birds. I now went up on the rooks, where I had cleared a place to lie and bask in the sun, and whence I could overlook the sea; Several weeks had elapsed since I saw the vessel. ? About this 'time I found in the forest, near my tobacco plot. Borne yellow clay, a quantity of which I carried home, and oceupiedmy evenings ; in trying to : convert : into some vessel to hold water. I made several ungainly looking things, ' and. spoilt all but two in trying to bake them. The occupation, however, served to divert my ' attention, and keep me from brooding too much : over my misery. - ?' In the hope of finding honey, I had several bee hunts. How bees came on this desolate island puzzled me; but there they were ; they could hardly be indigenous. I traced an im ?; mense swarm to a tree, which I had the cruelty : to burn down ; that being the only expedient by . which I could obtain the honey hived high up in ?;) the trunk. I was rewarded ior this toil (which was great, first and last) by the largest stock of honey I. had ever yet seen taken, even in New I; ? Zealand, from a tree. A part of the mass of honey was two or ihree seasons old, being of a deep yel low color, and the wax brown ; thereBtwas of a pale- straw color, in snow-white virgia combs. Of the latter 1 ate eagerly, and then; collecting the ?',! reBt, deposited it in my clay vessels, leaving the ;, oldest a prey to the lizards and ants. I found this .honey a delicious addition to my fish. I ?i '?] found afterwards two more bee trees, the contents ?';' of whi^h I obtained and enjoyed. I Kad frequently noticed what I took to be ;?;?; the footsteps of some kind of animal on tha -; pathway leading up the rocks into the forest. I '?? had not, however, seen anything of any animal. I knew pigs, and goats to-be the only animals jjl found in New Zealand in a wild state, and they f' are not indigenous, having been introduced, I jl believe, by Captain Cook. One day, as I was re K turning with a load of firewood, I heard below, : to my great surprise, some animals bleating. : Laying, down my load quietly, I looked on the !j ground below, and, to my great delight, saw a ii herd of wild goats licking the salt on the rocks, I: How w.as, I to come at them? How could I !;; catch one of them ? I remembered that Robin !.j boh Crusoe beoaine swift enough of foot to run Li them. down. I much doubted my capability rj:', of doing so. As, however, no plan suggested a ,' itself to me other than that of stealing quietly I;;': upon them, and then making a sudden rush, §?? I resolved iorthwith to try that course. Slowly I 'i'- and stealthily I got within fifty yards of them i; unnoticed. One suddenly observed me and I gave ,a loud bleat of warning, and they all §'?'?. made a rush up the rocks where no human I';, foot could.follow. Having got out of my reach, I V; they . turned round and stared at rae. What I' could. I do? Nothing, but quietly return for |:; my firewoodrand try to devise some mode of I: . catching them at some future time. Many were |;;| the devices that passed through my mind, all i'l' equally futile. Lying in the hut some days a ?''! later, I heard some animals running over the Ij gravel in front of it- It wag midday, and I was a-;1; resting from the heat of the sun. I peeped out, 1 and saw six goats separated from their compa iiniona and browsing on some karaka bushes near §1 my spring. I crept out as stealthily as cat after if; mouse; the plashing of the little stream over the S 'rock, drowned any little noise I might have fl wade, and fortunately, the wind blew from them to me. I found the distance between me and -them gradually lessen, while the space between, the pool of water and the steep precipitous rocks gradually narrowed, leaving, them less and less room to rush past me. At length they, saw me, and seemed so near that for a. moment they stood perfectly still— paralysed. I rushed at them with a whbop. Five' passed me; but the last, a she-goat, heavy with ' kid, -got separated from her companions, and. in her perplexity leaped upon a large , stone in .the water, and there stood bleating most pitifully. I made one bound after her,, .hrew! my 'arms about her neck, and held her in a close, embrace. Now,. I thought, I have succeeded in catching the very goat I would; have chosen ; how shall I get her home ? My doubts as to thiB, important question were very ?' soon! settled.; The storie pa which we both were, was covered with a green slimy moss, and gradually ' -I felt my feet slipping, from ' under,, me., , The. ?goat, made a sudden plunge for liberty, and down I came with her into the. water.' '.' I was forced to loosen, my hold,. She beat me at swimming, short as the distance was to land ; and, with a loud bleat, she rushed up, therocks after her companions. '.'..' ? . , i,; I was consolid on the same evening by finding anenorinous shell which had been washed up. by the tide ; this, along with two or three smaller ones, I carried away, rejoicing in them as vessels to hold water. Many and, many a, time, however, :I sat planning how to secure a goat. For even one goat, as a companion, would have been a great boon; but At was all to no purpose ; I never got one*. : ??.-:'??: .?..??'???.? ????.? ?- ?-? .-..;:,?: One bright moonlight nighty I feli short df wood. I had that , day neglected getting it (why, I forget now), so I had to turn out and; go- up- : into the forest.- The moon shone i beautifully, and the effects- of light arid shade' among the huge trees and gigantic creepers were -so fantastic and weird-like that I could not help sitting down On a fallen treei arid, half frightened, yet utterly entranced, gazing on the wonderful scene. Ab I sat, a loud shrill whistle sounded close behind me. After a short time I recovered sufficient self- possession to look cau tiously around, arid saw a dark object moving. I waited until' it1 came into the full lijght of the moon, when I' saw what at first I took for a1- quadruped. But it was' a bird: a bird1 with neither wings nor 'feathers, but 'a sort of fur. It occurred to ^me that; this must be the ' kiwi' I had heard much of from the natives, called by the whites the apteryx. Apart from its skin, which I wished to obtain, it was,, as I knew,1 exceedingly good eating. ; I looked round for a stick or a stone, and at length got hold of a stick without alarthirig the bird. I started forward, and made an unsuccessful blow at it. It ran very quickly ; 1 managed, however, to overtake it, when the brute threw itself on its' back and struck as me with its legs, ripped up my trousers with a sharp hind claw, arid tore the skin of my leg most grievously. I was so taken aback that the bird escaped. I had one satisfac tion, however ; I had ascertained the cause of the mysterious whistling, and thus set 'all fears on that score at rest. In a day or two I found apteryx eggs, which made a welcome addition to my larder. . - . Four long weary months and two weeks had passed: Three or four times in the day I regu« larly went up to the rocks, trying to sight a Bail:'5 A long time had now elapsed since I saw the last, and my hopes of ever seeing ; another became everyday fainter arid fainter. At length, brie fine warm sunny day as I was1 lying on the rock, looking every now and then1 seaward, I iescried a small Bpeck far out to sea. At first [thought my eyes deceived me;. I rubbed them, and looked again, and, saw it still more dis tinctly. I fook a short walk.iri the fdresti arid, jomine; back, found the object grown larger ind plainer. I could now discern glistening in the light of the sun, the white1 sails of a vessel'. How' my heart, beat! Would she come -near jiiough for me to signalise her? I made ready \ fire, and, this time, gathered' several green Drahches to make a smoke with. Nearer iind learer she came, until at length ? I1 made, her out ;o be a large schooner bound t.- the southward, I lupposed to Auckland! When she arrived (as iear as I could guGSs) about four miles from. the sland, I lighted my tire, arid heaped^ on it a mass )f greenwood and damp moss, and watched the imoke ascend in a large dense cloud. I looked jagerly towards the sohoorier.- She came hearer, ind nearer. My heart palpitated; I could dis irictly hear and almost count its loud and mi.ious throbs. ?' They see the smoke, they see t !' I cried in ecstasy, -as she suddenly lauled up to the wind, and I heard her sails' lap sharply against her masts. In my ex sitement I screamed until my throat was sore, . vith the vairi hope that the people on board vould hear my cries. Do- they really see the imoke? Will they lower a boat for me? The ew minutes of suspense during which she lay iback, eeemed hours. Hours? Years. '1 mow they see the Bmoke, I. know it '.' I cried ;' ' how ? cruel not to hasten!' Why do they not. ower a boat and pull off?' 'They are going ['? [ shrieked, in my agony, as I saw the vessel's lead slowly turn, and the sails again belly out ;o the wind. 'They' are going ! Oh, my God,: hey are going! And leaving me here !. Have nercyy-have mercy, and do not utterly forsake ne !' I cast myself with iny face to the ground, ny eyes, hot, dry, and tearless. I dared not' ook again. I felt as if I was going-mad. At ength I got up, and took one last despairing ook at the receding ship now again diminished to , small speck. Silent and tearless, I sat for hours looking [own into the quiet deep blue waters. Here nd there, dorals of all strange hues and many arms branching out in different directions, with iright colored strange shaped fish gliding in nd out among the grotesque stony foliage, nd snow-white Bhells gleaming in the bright Iear water amongst the dark green, weed, which wayed idly backwards and forwards with the laBhings of the tide. All down there looked so erene and ptaceful that the ? thought crept uto ray miud, '* Would it not be better to oil off this rock, and Beek that resting-place ? t would be but one plunge, a very brief pang, nd then to sleep.' As I sat brooding over those wicked thoughts, tie words, ' Call upon me, in the day. of trouble : : will deliver then, and thou shalt gloiify me,' ame suddenly into my mind. I lushed down, to my hu^ fell on my Ipees, arid prayed God' to pity me and give me patience and- submission. Four more weary weeks passed without any. in- cident worth noting. ','. Methodically. I j fished, and gathered firewood), roamed through the forest, and forrriect futile iplans for catching goats, . . In, this mariner, another rp.onth passed- I had; now been five months alone on the island, ,,; . ; ,-''?.?;. ' ? ? jl had retired to feed one night as- usual,' when I ?. wasr startled '?'. by hearing ? something bump on the breach., ;? I ^jumped up, and. listened: :It can not be my old boat lifted off -the rricksiby a high ' tide ?,, ;NoiMit could not be; that ; for the .boat had been-almost all removed for .one purpbsew-otKer. Andjv-yet I heard . footstepsi; ;and then aloud' ? gruff y.oice, saying, MEumea, Kumea.!'. I'knew that voicej well,' but I almost thought- twafi dreaming. I rushed out^ and sawby theUightibf the^mpon,:which was then .near; the full* five;or six -dusky - figures . trying to-haul up a' large boat out ,of .the reach ; of ? the'i breakers^- . With. a j loud shout ;of joy I ran forward, but stood ^mazed and appalled; at :,the sudden1 yell which escaped) from , the : persons, ? v who left .off .-; dragging, the ?^boat.v and- tumbled precipitately, into, her, as. if their only. safety were there. Moreover^ I saw to my; horror a largebare' brawnyjarm held up, with something, glittering in the mpp.n'b silver light, and I feared its. flying af me. VjKow ikoe?

'?????-?? As, soon as he had fully got into his mind that I was the person I represohted myself to be he began ?.; asking me innumerable questions. The -others had been listening all; this time in' the boat, and on his , order came out reluctantly ; we pulled the boat high up on1 the -beaeh, the1 wppien (for they were the chief's five wives) casting all the time side glances of doubt and ' mistrust on. me. But I icontrived[ once or twice to ; knock against th.em gather roughlyj''as only flosh and blood and bones ' could do, and this ' seemed to set their minds at. rest. Monganui, who was the chief who had given .me the two boys,' came to; my. hut, while hiawiveB busied themselves in making a shelter, for. the night with the bars of th.e boat and their blankets. Mbn ganuiarid I; remaining at my;house after supper, we lighted .bur -pipes.1' I proceeded to iiar rate my adventures of the last few months, kt the icourse of which I .was . frequently inter rupted by his savage: ejaculations of astonish ment, i i When I had done, he said, ',' Ah, well you w;buld make. a. good Maori,', 'that being' the' very highest complimentihe could pay me is: I' then .{\sked. him- how he. had come, and. why?
