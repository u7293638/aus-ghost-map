_ . _ Original Poetry. S W A G M E N. AUSTRALIA Thro' wild bush, men footsore tread and more on, Restless, like the gum trees, through driving storm, Hustled about, with swags and pilly-can, No matter how threadbare, for one to scan. These swagmen tramping on, in winter's rain, Heed not magpie notes o'er the swampy plain, Nor Nature a hidden world care they to know, That often blends with their sad hours of woe. Oh, to think of their sharp and bitter pain, Their worn-out doubts in the piteous rain, As if a;; hope had ceased, in need and strife And friendship's hand dead in their world of life. Whether lies their track, and murmuring breasts Their blank despair; hard curses, songs and jests. Will no one soothe their lonesome steps and plight, Shed love by day, and calm their cares by night ? No; leave them with the moon and sleeping land; Bush toilers here need no comforting hand; Sympathy's trace is oft' their lot denied, When hunger is strong in their angry pride. It is vain labor, for work's fount is dry Our courage fails us, lay our ashes by; And glad hearts smiling say, " Tis all madness - Working men, don't tire ; spectres, have glad- ness." Poet-like, then, he saw life, not the wrong, And strove their truth to know it, and its song, Oft prattled with these poor men, to learn it, And paid tribute to their hearts, as a poet. Saw faces, read thoughts, this picture to bring, (For you must probe the heart ere you can sing), At length, stunned by their mystery of pain, He disputed their ghosts and shrouded strain. " Success means work," they said, these men so poor, "Not bogging, unheeded, from door to door," And yet no voice spoke to their burden's breath, And that prized song-wreath comes to them not yet. 'Twas ever thus, swagmen, I tell you all. A rough life, and complaining, ne'er recall, Look forward! Mark time's future and its light; Joys were less fair without misfortune's blight. J. JONES.
