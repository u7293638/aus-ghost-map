friendly societies sports. The annual sports of the Orbost Friendly Societies were held in the Recreation ground on New Year's Day. The. weather was all thatV' coulds be desired ' and although Tlie j'at tend ance was' not as large as it- has been on former occasions there was a good con tingent, of., visitors from- Buchan and Cuninghame.- : The sports were of. a very interesting character and being kept moving smartly there was . pro bably more genuine amusement to be- extracted from them than from many more pretentious gatherings. Tbe grounds have been . improved a good deal, by clearing and removing fallen timber since the last sports were held, and as far as. carryiug on the games is ' concerned theyr are well adapted to tbe purposes to which they are applied. The arrangment for charging admission to the ground was carried one in a very, perfunctory manner, the - resnlt being that the sports were free" to lthe public notwithstanding the fact that a faw ovcr conscientious persons persisted in tendering their, sixpences to the two stalwart individuals that occupied posi- -tfdnb-nf thu-giite-fur-u-purlrof-'-Ltic-cluy-r- 'uiiui me reserve is encioseu lC- wni- oe practically - impossible to impose a charge for admission, as the- present fence is quite useless for the purpose of keeping either quadrupeds or. bipeds off the ground. It most be evident to everyone now that those who objected to the reserve being leased for grazing purposes did a very foolish thing. Had it been leased the fence would have been made secure against stock, the fee ...for - admission conld have « beeu collected from most of those -who' at tended the sports, and two or three horses would have . been runniug there instead of the place being- open to all -the cattle and horses , in the district. AiYe "would strongly advise that steps bdtaken to put wires in the fence and plant ,;a.: hedge -of boxthorn or some ;qnick growing" shrub, ras in, a very few -.years this ; would become ' an itn pene trable Avail and would not only enclose bnt< would- materially beautify. the :pluce. A good deal of i n terest was ta ken i n the footraces and local peds had been bnsy , training for some weeks, but these events were marred by the excess of liberality shown by the handicappers to some of the junior runners. The prin cipal event was practically a gift to Bird, the men at or near scratch not .getting tho ghost of a show, and only five of the ten nominators took part in the race. .The Orbost Handicap was secured by Jno. Mundy with 14 yards, Dew, S yards, and Reynolds, 9 yards, going remarkably well for - second and third places. There were sixteen entries for this event but only eight faced the starter. F. Stapley carried off j the Maiden Plate in good slyle, also the Hurdle Race after a splendid finish with H. Munqy. J. Bird who accom plished the easy task set him in the- Societies -Handicap shapes well "for a -runner, us ' dyes J enseti.'Who-eamer good second. \ About a dozen started for the Mile Race, for which Reynolds : on scratch was greatly fancied, but the winner turned up.in E.

The former was Oiiiy fairly patronised by the public . which appears to be due to the fact j (hat it was not sufficiently advertised. and that the members of committee to whom the management was intrusted had their hands lull in connection with the sports and were unable to properly, work up the affair. " ; Several of the performers whoso names were on -.-tlio; programme failed to put in an. appearT ance, and at the commencement, of the; proceedings tilings looked iveryi.un- promising,- but in spite -of- all draw backs a very good concert was held and the . audience / were thoroughly' satisfied before its termination.
