There is no change in this Eastern world of silence and mystery, whose institutions were already venerable when naked savages were still 1 sending their fi and coaches on the Seine and the Thames Europe has, indeed, flowed into Africa and Asia, but her current is part, like the turbid Rhone in the blue w waters of Geneva Unimaginable ages will have passed before the ever filling run and snow shall have dragged down the might) Himal ty is to the plain As we ship swiftly) down the Gulf of Suez, the linen peaks of Mount Sinai use on the left in the far distance The whole country, tinned red and yellow by the fierce sun, is is savage a desert as when the Jews wan died therein for forty years, acquiring that fortitude which stood them in good stead in later years, when Christian persecutors v Manly sought to discover the times which might sin pass those of a residence in the Arabian deserts As I listen to the in genuous remarks of my fellow passengers who seem to consider Sinai less interesting than Richmond Hill-and when I look from the forbidding Mount of the Law across the narrow waters to the opposite shore, where the British Government and a British and) are interpreting the len Gomm incidents in the imperial f since, I cannot but wonder if orthodox.

But Englishmen, with whose heart strings the honour of their country is interwoven, and who have watched her knit ocean fortress to fortress in an electric ring of glory, will take care that when the day of his trial comes the statesmen who guide her fortunes shall be not less bold and wise than those who, eighty years ago, made the name of Egypt the proudest among those inscribed on the national banner".
