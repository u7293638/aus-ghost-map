A GHOST STORY. The Tramp stood before the Woman in the kitchen door. " What do yon want P" asked the Woman. " I want work," answered the Tramp. it that moment he felt a heavy hand on his shoulder, s<nd turning around he saw an apparition almost touching him. It was good, honest, permanent, hard Work. The Tramp fell against the house in fear. " Who are you ?" he gasped in a shiver. "Ian Work," said the apparition, extending its hand to him. The Tramp pulled hire self together. " I don't know you," be said; " and you never got that close to me before." Then, with an energy greater than Work possessed, he made a wild rnah for tbe street and escaped.
