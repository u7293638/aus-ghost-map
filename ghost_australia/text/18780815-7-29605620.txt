A motion by Mr. BAS[?] for information tespettiaaUss Murrsy Eridgawa* carried. Mr. Vabd^ motion relative to an Intercolo nial Biallwav was oqfatived, and cbe G«veru msnt aaw—viMisit for a line to Name was agreed to. A Bill for a railway to Kaicne was utrodnoed and read a first time. The liwmed VtetaaUers Amen4bsMnt BiQ waareadatUrdtime. Its farther cooaideratiaa wasadrMmed foranasoth. Xbe House adjourned shortly after 6 o'clock tOl next day. The Oovemmest scored anotfaer vsctorj on Wednesday in the AjasenUy, when in op position to Mr. Ward's motion it was re sulted by a majority of nearly three to one that the time U not ripe for a railway through the Mount Lofty range to the Murray, mod across the ninety nritss of desert to the Victorian Border, in order to connect this city with Melbourne. No one doubU that ultimately there aunt be rafl- Tfy -«—""iffti" *?ft irwn thnm tijitwlf; to doubt ft ?e to exhibit disbelief in the progress of the In n rulnains, bat we have to consider whether these an ant works of more preasine: importance that require to be carried out with me tittle delay as possible. As the Commissioner of Pebli: Works urged we have huge tracts of fertile land ni the north neediog railways to develop tbeni and to make the settlement of each country profitable, and w* should not delay the fflmcation of such cmderukinfrs in order to s«ciire a fanciful realuation of a dream of sudden greatness for Adelaide- Better have railways to bear the g-olden Crain and the valuable fleeces at a profit, than an iron mad on which to carry «ifla and passengers at a heavy lose. Sack ■ question is not to be settled by animated appeals to the public spirit, resolution, and foresight of legislators. There :s no doubt this is a great country, an i of coors? the eyes of the world are co?tinuaUy upon it. and Europe listen* upell-botirxl for the far off echoes of our eecttorial elc|uei>ce, but still we have to look calmly and rationat'iy at the fact that our population U limited, and 240,000 people cannot do «Terythin?. The Commissioner of I'ubiic Works estimates the coat of maintenance of a railway through the hills to the Victorian border at £75,00 ) a year, and the internet on cost of caattruc tion at £4-1,000, making in all £120,030 as the expenses of the line ; and though Mr. Hawker mtderestsmates the probable pas senger traffic, yet then could be no reason able doubt that the annual low to the {rabbc revwue would be very large. Mr. Ward, with that rapid happy go- lucky style of mental calculation with which be meets trifling objections of this load, estimated the probable lose as fometbtag the Partiameat atad sot be dwtre&Md; about, and appealed ts hon. members to know wbeUiei, foraotrinatjr a consideration as £60,000 inteteat, we were to ignore the poauion of Mriaiaa a* the Rrindisiof thecolouiea, and sacrifice the great moral effect the construction of sweh a Una would nradnes in our favor with Aus tralasia and the world generally. Sixty thousand pounds! exclaimed the hon. num ber. WbatiaatP The taxes upon the additional population there will be in the colony four yean brace will pay it. Unfortunately this would not be the only public work canwinp- a heavy locs. There is £"J5,000 loss yearly on the overland tele graph, and GMfIQO on oar finished rail waye. Then it is estimated that oa the lines in course of construction we shall net an annual lots of £75.000, and the proposed railways will cost £32^000 a year otst iuterert and worktnjr expenses to keep them goinjr. Altogether, according to Govern ment csJculsLioot, we shall be It sing over £2d0,U03 on our nil ways and Port Darwin Telegraph, besides having the expense* of keeping all our splendid main roads in re pair and constructing o:ber« without ftt tinp- a farthing in return. Lkini? at these fijrurer, ou ruskinpr into freah undertaking* of great magnitude, with a full understanding that instead of bain will be a heavy burden upon the finances of the colony 't Mr. Ward urge* oar legis lators to have faith. Well, they have dis played that great quality in an eminent degree. The evidence of their faith reached wavlf £4000*00** national deht at th? daas of last year, and if they coatiaas in the same believing spirit to the end ot 1678 aethey are now manifcisriag the IwhiKtia* of South Australia wiD reaeh«3TjO3OgOC?. la mnndaue things, however, there mast be some fajnit to faith, and it is aim able that it should not degene rate into credulity or fanaticism. Mr. Ward's faith appears to be the aub stanee of things hoped for aal the enJaacs of things notaeen. Bome men will damp this sublime confidence in the immediate future with cold suggestions of worldly eaaaioaaad prudence. In this frame of mind they voted for the Premier's amendment for a railway simply to Nairne. Some who accepted this compntmiaa bsliave that this fine will be but a section of the graad railway that is to connect as with all the other capitals of Australia, ex cepting poor little Perth; others regard it as a local railway, waoaated by the district traffic, and do aot approve extend ing it across tha Murray eastward; others wiU on a future occasion cisam tasJT baliaf that the project iittrn srtnasiiifi. aad wffl proposs that the terminus be about A&flgate; Pomp, ao that the line wfll ba of a aaburlin aad a aauitary r*~mrttt merely intended to take the ciriTsaa to tba hi&s; during the beat of Munmer.

Pond & Co. on Tuesday morn ing. The Jury found " that there was no evi dence to show the origin of the fire," and added as a rider "that the stove as used is very dan gerous, being so close to tbe wood and vats, and that the chimney of the furnace is not hifrh enough, and should have a proper spark \- catcher. 9 The adjourned half-vearly moAtin^ of .shareholders in tbe South Austzaiian Permanent Equitable Building and Investment Society was heldattheSccietT'KOffice,Glanville,oii Tuesday evening, August 13. Mr. T. H?ck presided. The balance-sheet, which was adopted, showed a profit of £155145. 7d. for the past half year. It was decided to declare a profit of one shilling Stnd sixpence in tbe pound, leaving a balaooe of profits of about £50 to be carried forward to the next half year. Tbe same evening £100 shares were sold at a premium of £20 17s. 9d- per ehare. A practical movement is on foot to secure the advantages of an Institute for Unley. ' The want of such a building has long been felt, and the need of a room ia which to hold concerts and other public entertainments has been especially apparent. Tbe late Mayor of the municipality, Mr. Henry Codd, J.P., and otters are now obtaining subscriptions from residents of and owners of property in Unley for the purpose of commencing the building, and of course the amount subscribed will be subsidised pound for pound by tbe Government. It has keen suggested that the canvassers should enlist Ike sympathies of tbe ladies, and endeavor to arrange for a bazaar. A case of. cruelty to animals was heard fefore Mr. Beddeme on Wednesday morning and resulted in the digmiaml of the person accused. Tbe evidence showed that the polic9 liad received information that Charles Corn wxS, m botcher, of Kent Town, neglected to give his sheep sufficient food and water, and constables were therefore placed near, his premises to watch. During twenty-nine hours it was seen that fourteen sheep bad received neither food nor water. The defendant's boy -■wore in Court that he took the sheep out to graze at 4. o'clock on the afternoon of Monday, ma he always did. Mr. Beddome in dismissing Hie information said it appeared that the neglect had taken place in the absence of tile defendant, and that the boy had failed to do what it was presumed was his dnty. A large and influential deputation waited on the Commissioner of Public Works (Hon. 6. C. Hawker) on Wednesday morning to urge tile necessity of putting the Port-road into a thorough state of repair. It was stated that the vote passed last session had been inju dJciondy expended, and several speakers pointed out that if the road were once put into thorough repair it conld be maintained by tbe expendi ture of a thousand or two thousand pounds annually. A. suggestion waa also madethatas the Port-road was of special importance to the colony it should be placed raider tbe care of a separate Board appointed by the Government. The Commissioner gave a favorable reply to tbe deputation, and promised to bring tte matter before bis eo?eagues. "We hare been requested to call attention to an advertisement mnmninm that the foun> dataon-stone of tbe residence and schools for the Christian Brothers, at the comer of Wake&eld; and *«*-l.~* streets, wBl be bud at 11 o'clock this morning by the Roman Owtholif Bishop of Adelaide. As the school? and caaritable inatitu taons conducted by the members of this ikm?iHj are highly popular and liberally supported, not only in Europe, but also in America and several of tiie AustzaGan colonies, it is confidently hoped tint tie people of Adelaide will not be behind- in *?ffirig *Hi^i ftyrtrti^y f.rt f?«tibliffh a frranrh of their Order in South Australia.

It appears that a girl named Lacy McNeil], who was engaged ai a domestic servant by Mr. 3. DarUag. jnn, Hutt-street, complained on Thursday morning, August 8, to Mrs. Darling of being unwell, but that lsdy t^T 11^ in iH-heath at the and Mr. Darling being away from borne, ndt much notice was taken of the eom plaint. On the afternoon of the day in ques turn the girl, from her own statement, was can fined of a child, which she hid in a box in her bed room. On Friday Ehe did her work as usual, but vYwnplsinwi of being rather on well. As nothing very unusual was noticed in her appearance Mr. and Mrs. Darling did not suspaet anything. On | Tuesday morning McNeil, who had N"vwrH? very ill, conf eased to what had happened* and. infor mation wss given to the police. The body of theichild was found in the box and removed to the desdhouse. Dr. Gardner was r*tmvn*in\\}r!m*^ with, and he found that McNeil was in a high state of fever. The doctor also male a post ttuniem examination of the body of the child on Wednesday morning, the particulars of which will be forthcoming at the inquest which is to be held this morning The unfortunate girl had been in Mrs. Darling's employ for about six weeks, and we understand that she has always borne on rrrrilent character and that her parents are very respectable people. Jo late telegrams published in the Indian papers, tbe following, under date of July 16, is given as a summary of the treaty signed at Berlin:—" The treaty contains '64 articles, and j provides for a provisional Russian «dminia. | Ization and Russian occupation of Bulgaria by 50,000 men, tile eaine to terminate in nine months.

From the diplomatic corre spondence of tile Foreign Office on the cession of Cyprus, it appears that the assignment of Cyprus to England was suggested by^'JLH. Ziayard.

The half-yearly meeting of the share holders in the I^y Alice Mining Company took pUee at the Institute, Gawler, on Monday even ing, August 13. The whole of the Directors aad * huge number of shareholders were present. Mr. James Martin, J.P., who occupied tile chair, ' moved the adoption of the balance-sheetand the Directors' report, which having been seconded by Mr. A. 3. Woodman was carried.' Mr. H. Dean intimated that be had sent a telegram to Syd ney, —Ung the cost of macui *my. Hie said it would be well if tile Company ™«juld fliv« Otc «n«-iiip«? ? }n irrfar thy* reef could be tested at various places. At a later period a -meeting to consider the adrisableness of volontaifly winding up tfaeCompany was held. ■The Secretary read a petition from several shareholders, in which they asked that tile notice calling the meeting should be withdrawn. In 2*s^™* *?* **Company might obtain the sEoJUWU reward from tile Government for the discovery of 6,000 ora^ and secondly, to try and obtain a gnat of £SjQoofrom the Government in order that they might be enabled to develop tie property. Two of the Directors stated tiiat they were not very sanguine as to tiie condition of she mine, but tile other two Directors thought Che ywpetly an extremely valuable one, and that it would in the end repay them for any outlay. Mr. H. Dean then proposed—w That this meeting bo adjourned to Monday, Sep tember 9, and that a deputation consisting of the members of the district and other peraons interested in the development of the gold reefs of Barossa wait on the Hon. Oommisaianer of Crown lands for the purpose of urging the Government to assist the Company by granting asamof money to procure the best bonng ma chinery to test the Lady Alice reef to a depth of 1,000 feet, and that the Directors ascertain the cost of the best boring machinery." Mr.A. J. Woodman seconded, and the motion having been carried, a deputation was appointed, with power to add to their number. A petition bearing 1,116 signatures was presented in the Assembly on Wednesday by Mr.Krichaoff. The petition had reference to the subject of free education, and was as fol lows :—" That your petitioners have read wit* much pain that one of the hon. members for the District of Wallaroo (Mr. Chas. Simeon Hare) has tabled a notice of motion for consideration by members of tte House of Aoaembly on Wed nesday, August 7, that school fees in connection with the public education of the colony should be abolished. That your petitioners object to the motion being passed for the following reasons:—First, because the present system already provides for the education of the poor; second, that a. very great amount for educational purposes is already taken out of the public funds, and from ■which amount we derive no benefit whatever; thirdly, because in the event of free public schools being established, we shall be bound by onr eanadenees and the traditions of our Church to continue our denominational schools ; fourthly. Hat such m danse wcild tend to pauperise the people, and introduce an element of Socialism highly undesirable for the • best interests of tie colony, and that compulsory education does not necessarily entail free edu cation, a fact fully admitted by the English code now in active operation; fifthly, we con sider it would be a gross injustice vat in a country where libeny of conscience is oae of the fundamental principles of Government, we should be compelled to contribute so largely I towards the maintenance of a system of educa tion whose aim is to eradicate all religious training -whatever out of tbe schools, and that this cecularism will not only exclude the reading of the Bible, but will also prohibit even the ; mentioning of the name of God, a system of education subversive of Christianity, and dis graceful to a nation professing Christian prin ciples. That in consideration of the foregoing : reasons, and in fairness to a large number of . tile inhabitants of this dependency of the j British SmpsCy your petitioners would respect- j fully pray your honorable House to reject the ! motion now tabled for your consideration.'' : An important trial of Sir Joseph Whit- j worth's impregnable aamor-plating has lately : been made •* mf-~* nll■ .■ This armor-plating '. is formed of his flnid-comprassed steel, and it j tooilt up in stT^ ri|gr*nftl ■<.'<.

A ; small targe*, 2£mehesuthirtees* sad tapte- ; senting one section of auch armor-pUtang, was '< lately fired at with S lbs. shot, with tbe result ; that aD iron shot broke up ngainst it barm- ' It ssly.mill Ilisl s imini*< ■■«!

The i experiment baa since been repeated upon a larger scale, with a target 9 in. in thicrmess. supported by a wood *~*t;"g against a Band bank. In front of this target a horizontal iron : tube waa fixed to receive the fragments of the shot. The projectile was a Palliser shell weigh ing 250 Iba, and it was fired from a (Mn. gun ' with 50 lbs. of pebble powder, at a distance of SO yards Jrom the target. Such a projectile ; would have passed through 18 inches of ordi- j nary iron annonr- platang; but against tte new i taiget H was powerless. It broke up into in- '■ numerable small fragments; and, tte target Slaving bees driven rtarfc IS *——E*"l * into the aud by the impact, these fragments were able to escape at tl>e end of tbe tube. They continued their morement of rotation in such a way as to cut a sort of trench through ten planks immediately in front of the displaced target, and then were scattered about in a shower. The onlv piece of any siae which sur vived the shock was a flattened mass 6 lbs. in weight, formed from the apex of the shell, which was left imbedded in tbe surface of the tatget, where it had made for itself ?«■ M?«?«i?i'«t!«?t 8 inches in diameter, and one and four-tenths of an inch deep at the central or deepest part. SaTe for this shallow dapreaskw, the target was absolutely uninjured, the ring which laceiMed the shock not baring onload, and nodtstar hanoaof tbe back snrfaoaha.ving heeu prc iured If this brilliant success should be confirmed by further trials we shall possess in tile new plat ing a lighter armour than any which is now in use for large ironed ails, and one which will be invulnerable to any miwdl«-s at present em ployed in-warfare. On Wednesday evening the Council of Education disposed of then: ordinary hmineas which bad been adjourned *rom the previous Monday. A Urge amount of cx*ir*i*nndrmtn was dealt witii. In connection with tiw studies of the University students Mr. Barlow moved a resolution asking them to resume their study of fnstfrflFf?i>*. wfuch he urg^id as mj necessary. His suggestion wa* a ;*tl. The Minister of Education wrote, saying he had been obliged to reverse his decision in regard to the school site for grilli. In consequence ofeberepre wnrstinnii of personswham be could not ignore be had finally decided that the school most be erected in the township of EeillL JaneStanea, Sarah H.Birt, and Alex. Clark, who had been offered appointments in the Bast Adelaide School, wrote declining them. Two applications were received from Mrs. G.P.Etberidge and Chas. Otto for retiting allowances, and were referred to the Minister. Mr. B. Holland's offer of a school site at Lyndoch was accepted with thanks. The Kapunda Board of Advice asked that Clause 4 of Begulation 13 abould be altered so as to give Boards of Advice power to decide upon applications for free education and reduc tion of school fees. The Council said tbe sub ject would be considered when the regulations were next revised. The residents of Chinkford forwarded a memorial asking for increased school accommodation. The Inspector rep jrted that for the present fbe ai^TtMiE** I**^*^**1*! was sufficient. The residents to be made acquainted with the Inspector's report. The Kaponda Board of Advice said a new school was much required at Allandale. At the suggestion of the Inspector it was resolved that they should bs arked to furnish further particulars. Tbe Board of Advice at ir«?m?««i-.«« was directed to select a school site. The school site at Mannanarie was decided upon. A letter wss received from Mr. 3. C. Minns, is which ha acked tile Council to reconsider his case. Ha wished that the resolution for his dismissal should be rescinded, and that his resignation should be accepted, in order that the stigma at present attaching to his name might be ce moved. and that he might be relieved of a com mercial disability. The consideration of the matter was deferred for a weak. The swinging portion of the Jervois Bridge, which has recently been built across the Port River, was successfully opened at an early hour on Wednesday morning, August 11. An attempt was made to open this por tion of the structure about a fortnight previously, but owing to a stiffness in the machinery, which had never been worked previously, the opening was postponed. It was then decided to make the next trial after midnight, after the trains and other traffic had been stopped. On Wednesday morning, soon after midnight, men disconnected the pipes that traverse the bridge and supply Lefevre's Peninsula with water and gas; and a few other preliminaries incidental to the first starting of such a huge piece of machinery having been attended to, Mr. Parker, who superintended the erection of the structure, took his place on the signal gal lery, which is raised some 15 or 20 feet abore the centre of the bridge, and in a very few minutes the mass of iron swung open as smoothly and noiselessly as a door upon its hinges. After remaining open for some time, and swinging each way a few times to test the smoothness of tbe bearings, the bridge was dosed as easily as it wss opened, and the few persons who witnessed the proceedings left shortly before 2 o'clock, after congratulating Mr. Parker and Mr. Lobb, tile Foreman, to whose skill Mr. Parker admitted much of the success of the workings was due. The central or swinging portion of the bridge weighs about 650 tons, independently of the weight of 30 iron tollers or wheels under its centre, and upon which it revolves. When open it gives a space of about 47 teet on each side, so as to enable two vessels at the same time to pass through. At present the machinery is being worked by a ten-ton direct acting engina, with three cylinders, which pumps the water from she aocumulator. It is intended to do the work with the asajstence of she Water works by hydraulic power only, but as the water-main at present runs along the floor of the bridge, tie water has to he shut off and the pipes have to be disconnected before the bridge can be opened. After the river, how. ever, is deepened in the neighborhood of tte bridge, pipes will be laid at the bottom Of the stream and connected with the machinery. Everything is arranged so that engineer can from the signal-gallery work the whole of the machinery. The bridge, which was designed by Sir William Armstrong, has cost about £10,000. from the trial on Wednesday morning the whole can apparently be worked with ease and expedition, and with only a slight hindrance to the traffic. \- The anniversary tea and public meetings in connection with CUytou Church, Kensing ton, were held on Wednesday evening, August 14\. The tea was laid in toe schoolroom, and i was very well attended. At the public meet- ' ing, which was presided orer by the Hon. lav. Qlyde, BLP., there was also a large as semblage. Besides the Chairman, there were on the platform the Revs. T. Hope (minister of tte Church),W.B. Fletcher, J. Lyall,F. W.Cox, aad aL H. Hodge. The Bex. T.Hope,in intro ducing the general report, said he felt glad that the cloud which had beau hanging over the Church, and over himself especially, had paised avaj, and he trusted the sun would shine more brightly in the future. He said the report was, on title whole, a satisfactory oae. During the past year 25 new members had b:an added to the congregation, eome of whom were trans ferred bom other Churches. Financially they had done very well, though he would vertiiuly like to have seen the debt of £30 on the rosf cleared off, aud also tie <lsbt of £150 ou the chapel. He thought, however, that the Church was sever in such a happy state as wheu it was contracting new debts or paying off old ones ; and they would require to contrast same new debts during the forthcoming juxr. The stables attached to the church were out of repair and new ones would be required. They also needed a new instrument. They could not yet aspire to an organ but he would like to see instead of an ordinary harmonium an Italian organ placed in the church. It would cost between £70 and £89. In alluding to die new Wesleyan Church now being erected jut opposite theirs, Mr. Hope said they must not allow themselves to be pat in the shade, and be trusted that in course of two or three years | they would beabletoerect anew church. An earnest appeal was made to the assemblage to dear off the debt of £700 to the Chapel Boild ingSodety. The money collected at the anni versary meeting always went for the payment of ! \ that debt,and be was sorry to •aythattbey had \ ' only managed to clear off a little over £900 i lof the debt in twenty-two anniversaries. The ' I speaker then alluded to the gift to the Church i : by Mr. E. T. Smith, M.P., of a very handsome j , communion "service, purchased in England by ] | that gentleman on his recent visit. Mr. T. | { Caterer read tbe financial balance-sheet for the . ! year. The total receipt* bad baeu £« W 19j. M., ; : which gane a balance over tile expenditure of ' I something like £10. The stipend fund amounted ' ! to «*er £330. being about £S0 over that of hut , ; year. The aacraninatsl fund had also been a I ; •oceeas. The collection for the Sunday- ', I school Building Fund amounted to £72 ll*. ! I «., and for the school itself £1) 2«. { Altogether the year, financially speaking, had i been a anonem, and compared favorably with ' i former years. Mr. B. T. Smith made a. abort ; statement relative to the School Building Fund. • iof which he was Treasurer. They bad a, loan of £190 tram the Chapel Building Society, , carrying interest at 5 par cent., and there waa , a debt of £130 due for the aeiunl, which he . earnestly crusted would be wiped off. In refe- ; rence to the oosfiasuiuon servioe. a suggestion ■ i bad been thrown out that the old service should be sold, and the proceeds placed towards paying | for the new oop. He depreoated any such action, and thought thai the old sat should b? reserved for use in the event of another Church being built. Addresses wane aim delivered by other gentlemen before the meeting closed. 1 Extraordinary proceedings at a Police Court are thus Jetcnbcd in the Sydn<*s Evening \ Xna of July 27:—"The proceeding* at ttu- , i Water Police Court yesterday were tu-ned into j i a tntnalt that disgraced the Berch.biit delighted ■ the andienre.

Mr. Cbarlton «n unable to ' allow the accusation to go unchallenged, and after reminding Mr. Baphael of his breach of Magisterial etiquette, came oat in plain lan guage to tbe effect, tbat Mr. Raphael had told a gross untruth. 'Yen arest liar. Sir—you are a ■ liar; and if yon had said that outside I'd have wrong your nose.' was the vociferous reply of Mr. Baphael. Mr. Smart immediately ordered the Court to be adjourned, but this did not in toe least quell tbe uproar, as such epithet* as > 'contemptible liar* and ' ecauudrel,' 'North ' Shore bully, 1 and * Nero.' aowmnanied with a : string of unmentionable adjectives fcon , turned. Mr. Charlton emphatically demanded '■ their retnetMO, instead of which there ! wm a repetition. Indeed «rnea the fracas had rearnrd ? crisis, it was generally ■ feared there would be a scene in the noble art Una, but with fat more judgment than could be i expected from Magistrates, the threatened con flict was not proceeded with.

But , Mr. Seymour took opportunity to state that Mr. ft.pl ...j bad come there purposely in favor \- of the defendanta'canoe, with one of whom, it waa well known, he waa very intimately ae -1 quainted, and that he (Mr. Baphael) fre quently did the same in cases in which ' butchers were the offenders, as they had ! told him (Mr. Seymour), wnen laying in -1 formation, that they would defeat his aims 1 by getting ' Old Joe' to adjudicate in the case.
