The more a man does to b3autify a place and make everything look com fortable and happy in these times of destitution and want, the less he is thought of. This is apparently the view sonie tmean contemptible person takes of Mr. Neville, the genial station master at the fBrunsoick Station, who for some considerable time past has spared neither time nor expense in an endeavonr to beautify his station, which bIow presents a. tmost pict !rc.':es ? it jpeair ance. Pot plants, sha bs, ferns, and many various kinds of flowers are to be seen growing oin the station throwing off a beautiful ordour. All this work, in the eyes of soute miscreant, is un noticeable, and in order that Mr. Neville might be put to a little more expense attd trouble, some person threw a stone throngIh a large glass fish clse containing some 24 gallons cf sater and about a dozent different epecies of fish.

Last Saturday's race i proved this beyond doubt for all riders ' gave up. the ghost," and the Victory Club finished 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th. The time for finishing the race was limited to eight hours, and by all appearances the riders took things indeed very coolly.

Constable Seddon stated that at about seven o'clock on Tuceday night last he observed thie woman sitting on the vacant allotment opposite the tram sheds. Her husband, who is also a very old man had gone ' Perkville during the after ncon, and up to the iime witness found the old woman he had not returned.

The land of every country, is the common property of' all the people of that country, because the Creator made it as a voluntary gift to them. That which nature provides is the common property of all God's children; that which the individuals creates belongs to the individual ; that which the community creates belongs to the community. There is a decided majority in favour. ot extending the franchise to women Fortunately for the women, it is likely to take a more practical. and concrete form than it did in New Southi Wales.

At the Coburg Court on Tuesday morning last, some queer expressions were given vent to in the case of alleged horse stealing. Two witnesses swore that the date, a " can't be found " man named Johnstone sold the horse to the defendant, was on the 12th of Septimber. When asked as to what made them certain of the date, they replied " bacause they read the Age." 'But," asked the prosecuting sub inspector, " Do you take the Age every day ?" "Yes" was the answer. " Well, how can you make so sure of the date ?'"' "Because I read the Age," was the reply. On Tuesday morning last a horse attached to a trap bolted from Phoenix street Â·along the Sydney-road. Vh en seating Mr. Stranks' promises, a horse attached to a buggy there also took fright and bolted. Mr. Strauks'.buggy ran into a greengrocers cart and was turned clean over, and in a few minutes fron this the horse thtt bolted from Phounix-street, also ran into the fruit cart and was turned over. Fortunately so damage of a serious nature was done.
