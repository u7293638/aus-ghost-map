ST. HELEN'S SUNNY SIDE. BY SKKTCIIBK. THE London Spectator asserts boldly that " men who have lived in Australia are never sentimental about criminals." However this may have been at the time of " His Natural Life" and "Never Too Late to Mend," and however one might be led into the same opinion who has seen the way in which even suspects are treated in Brisbane, it only needs a passing glance at St Helena to prove that the Spectator's dogma is at once a delusion and a snare. If thieves and vagabonds share the average pressman's yearning after a rest, they should be as satisfied with Queensland's penal establishment as Maiden Tribute Stead was with Holloway Prison. He professed himself to be sorry when his sentence ended ; the colonial rogue should likewise receive his liberty with regret. But the rogue always expects more than the honest man, andianotcvcn satisfied when, as in Queensland, he gets it There are little inconveniences about prison life, certainly ; one hears complaints of St Helena just as one hears them of the station clocks and of the acoustic properties of the Assembly chamber, but if the average lower class Englishman was as well fed, as well clothed, as well housed, and as little worked as are its inhabitants the status quo might endure unassailed for all time. From a prisoner's standpoint it is a model prison , the only difficulty is that such establishments are not usually supposed to be built to please their inmates From the north west, as the Otter runs into the well built jetty, the physical features of the island loom up pleasantly From the rise on which the prison stockade stands the ground slopes gently on the south and descends abruptly on the west, on both sides is the sea. From the corner thus formed the jetty is thrown out, and on its T shaped landing a dozen convicts are grouped. They are stout, hearty-looking men, dressed in blouse and trousers of coarse dirty white stuff having Penal Establishment, St Helena," printed on the back in faded letters, and they fell against a pile of boxes and the crane with the greatest imaginable case Except for their dress they might well be mistaken for a gang of wharf labourers waiting for a job, and they converse quietly with one another all unrebuked. In front is a warder who nets as wharfinger and directs the unloading of the sheep that the Otter brings, while grouped behind are a half dozen officials, evidently off duty, and Captain Townley, superintendent, whose word is law on this most attractive isle The tide is at the full, and the waves ripple gently against the jetty, and far away to northward along the the sandy shore. There is not a cloud ; but the April be at is tempered by the grand breeze that comes sweeping in from the bound less ocean, the air is fresh and sweet and pure as it never can be in the crowded city where honest men toil from morn till night for their daily bread Out beyond the shelter of the little cape the white caps fleck the blue waters, to landward there mingles, in harmonious confusion, the yellow of the sand, the emerald green of the grassy slope, and the darker hues of the wood crowned hills beyond Upon the ridge stands the prison stockade, no more like a person than many a free labourer factory, while the stables, sugar mill, and sheep coats seem to tell of contented husbandmen and industrious peace And as the sheep scamper along; the Jetty, leaping high over little of stacles, and crowding to one side only of the tram waggon that stands on the rails, which run right up to the stockade, it is hard to believe that those who drive them and shout at them, and jump into the shallow water after one unfortunate, are men who have lifted their hands against society, and are supposed to be working out their main mission under heavy and deserved punishment And such sense of incongruity is not lessened when, the mainland reached one sees the various occupations at which the convicts labour, and the careful provision made for their welfare and for their comfort "You cannot keep a man's face to the grindstone for years, says Chief Warder Hamilton, himself the perSonification of judiciously mingled discipline and humanity That is the key note of St. Helena treatment, and proves conclusively that the Spectator was wrong The prison proper is enclosed in a rectangular stockade, and is about the size of the average town block Its eastern face is occupied by the sleeping wards and the hospital, its western by the yards and the workshops In these yards (three in number, each about fifty yards square) St Helena life actually begins as by them are prisoners classified, and in them do the members of their respective gangs indiscriminately jungle To yard B, the most northerly, all new comers are assigned, and there for some time they remain, doing nothing, though strictly disciplined They have no " indulgences,' nothing but prison diet of the simplest sort, it goes without saying that this form of the dolce far niente is not generally appreciated, and that the inmates of yard B anticipate eagerly their removals to yards A and O. The latter are respectively occupied by the outdoor and the workshop gangs, to either of which the probationers are assigned according to the superintendent's opinion of their adapt Heness The inmates of the ditto rent yards are kept entirely apart eating and sleeping separately, and having no means of communication except what they can accom plan, by stealth Of course they do communicate even Argus could not hope to prevent them. The sleeping wards are all laid out on the same pattern, and are clean and well ventilated The cells, of which there are some forty in each ward, opening on each side of the main passage way, are narrow and lofty, being about 4ft in width, 7ft in length, and 100 in height They are ventilated by barred windows, one over the door, and the other opening through the wall, an agreeable impression being conveyed by all the ironwork being painted, thus banishing the cold dreary look so inseparable from the average prison In these small cells only one prisoner is placed, who sleeps on a canvas hammock that rolls up to the end wall in the daytime, and is lashed out at night to books placed near the door A night pan and water billy are provided for each man Other furniture there is none all washing being done in the yards Along the passage way cocoanut matting is stretched, which is patrolled nightly by an unheated warder, whose duties, however, appear to consist rather in batoning to what is said than in attempting to enforce silence Then you can't keep a man's face to the grindstone theory pervades all the regulations of this summer residence prison. But, however that may be, there is one feature of the sleeping wards that cannot be too strongly condemned, and which superintendent, warders, and prison experts unite in decrying That is the associated" cells, in which, for lack of better accommodation, men are lodged together to the number of a dozen and more These men are supposed to be privileged characters, and their coils, wire fronted, are exposed to the patrolling warder's gaze, but in spite of of such considerations, the effect of this herding may be imagined Criminals may not be entirely bad, but the leaven of fowl that is at once the cause and the result of a vicious life must work under such a hot bed system The herding in the yards must he bad enough but the herding in the associated cells is in com- parably worse The day in St Helena begins at 6 a m in summer and 6.30 in winter At that hour the prisoners, proMOUsly roused by a ball, are marched to their respective yards, where they are allowed an hour to wash, smoke, gossip, and breakfast Meals are taken in open aided dining rooms situated in each yard, and, sitting space being limited, are eaten m squads as the men are ready for them. At the expiration of the hour work is commenced and continued till 12, when there is another intermission of an hour for dinner Locking up time comes at 6 in summer and at 3 30 in winter, the third hour's looting time for smoking, gossiping, and supper ushering it in The work itself is by no mean laborious or difficult Quarrying might be supposed to be somewhat hard, but the eagerness with which such work is received shows that the inducements accompanying it are considerable The stone quarried is a curious sort of conglomerate that is soft when heat dug, but rapidly hardens when exposed to the air. It is worked first with a pick axe, and afterwards squared down with blunt axes About thirty men are thus employed, the quarries being situated immediately at the back of the jetty The stone is being used in the erection of new store rooms and others within the stockade The building that is now used for this purpose is inconveniently situated such a distance away in the fields, intent on raising sweet and English potatoes, maize, lucerne, sugar cane, and other crops, are thirty four men All these fields are on the slope that lies between the stockade and the jetty beach, and are models of patient care taking. But the great industry is tailoring, which employs fifty two men, who turn out much of the clothing used in the various Government services, including the Defence Force, but no longer the police uniforms They make, however, the large police riding cloaks, while the saddler's shop, employing sixteen men, makes the rougher kind of police saddles, with straps, leathern gun bags, and other fittings ad libitum The shoemakers who supply all the shoes required by the various dependents upon Governmental care are 17, the tinsmiths are 9, and the carpenters and painter 8 There are also thirteen masons and their labourers working on the new building, 15 draymen, IG wardsmen and wardsmen an enviable position-7 cooks, 9 fishermen, and bookbinders, lamp trimmers, wood cutters, blacksmiths, baker, butcher, shepherd, gar doner, sailmaker, and milkman In all there are 253 convict settlers on the island, guarded by 33 warders, accommodation is provided for 280 It has been said before that the work provided is not laborious, and certainly the St Helena shoemakers do not work with the same feverish energy that characterises Hunter and Co 's oporativcB, nor the tailors with the speed that is noticeable in the workshop of I timely Isles, and Co They work to put in time and they do it, they make an easy thing of it, as they would be very foolish not to if they can. The tailors range their shoes in a row at the end of the room before they start work, tailors and everybody else talk freely, but respond like clockwork to the cry of " Atten- tion with which the warders herald Captain Townley's round The " billeted" men those doing odd work are especially envied, as they are not perpetually under the eye of a warder, to which surveillance the prison bird has a most inveterate dislike And it is only natural In his cell, there is a warder outside in the yard, a warder watches him from a tree Used gallery at mealtimes in the workshop, in the fields, in the quarry, the tireless watch is always kept over him and if by some Monte Christo high nulty ho cut through his cell bars, picked the ward lock, sealed the inner part side, and forced his way to the outer wall, there are still two armed sentinels in watch towers that command the broad open alley way that run between the inner and outer walls, ready, day and night, to shoot down without mercy the convict who would escape That is the rub, he cannot escape and because he cannot he does not appreciate the plain but plentiful food, the " indulgences," the easy work, and the health ful situation The warders say that they live with nerves constantly stretched, one moment's relaxation of vigilance might permit an uncontrollable emeute It is rather strange to hear that there is neither a resident physician nor a chaplain, and that the Catholic priest is the only clergyman who troubles his head about the residents of St. Helena. There were two men in the hospital last week, to which the Government doctor boys weekly visits if required, not unless One of the patients was an old man who, the chief warder was of opinion, should be in Dunwich, and who, it was expected, would be soon sent there Mr Hamilton does the prescribing on emergency, and is proud of his record, which he dined even Dr Scholes, of Woogaroo, to beat This little hospital, though bare and barred, is not unpleasant, opening, as it does, into a little grassy plot that might be in the back yard of an Enoggera cottage It is far pleasanter than the dark cells at the end of the building, which are the only direct means of correction employed, but which, if darkness as a corrective, should be tolerably efficient They are dark, sunk under ground, the light jealously excluded, dark and bare and cheerless, repellent to the insurer stations, terrible, one would think, to those who believed in ghosts and in retribution, and who would see stealing upon them in the utter darkness the hideous shapes of unpunished crimes. It is not an agreeable impression that the prison makes, at least not if one's sympathies are with the honest and the industrious, and if one has imbibed the good old doctrine that the criminal's life should be made a decidedly hard one In a yard, a couple working leisurely fixing a drain , driving down the slope in the superintendent's cart, one meets a gang of field hands hastening gaily home to a good dinner, in the kitchen one sees meat and potatoes and bread ready dished - line in quality and plentiful in quantity in the yards at dinner time the convicts gather, washing themselves and joking, or reading a book from the library, grouping round one who tells a story, perhaps of successful theft. They are not all old criminals There are young men, in for the first came, feeling that the punishment is not insupportable, having their last hold on morality torn away by the degraded tone of this objectionable herding Young men go in with their whole hearts beating the sin that has brought them disgrace , they may go out afterwards learned in the legends of the lawless and conversant with a very trick that will aid them to evade honest labour It must be said, however, that as far as the officials are concerned everything appears faultless Whichever way one turns everything is beautifully clean, and discipline is strictly enforced It is like a well trained public school, governed by a kindly dis ciplinarian. "I don't like the system," says Captain Townley , "but we have to do the best we can with it I certainly think that a short term of severe punishment would do more good to a non confirmed criminal than the ordinary long term does But one thing must be recollected you can't maintain severity for a lengthy period If you do you drive a man into a corner and make a wild animal of Jura " And so the Otter loads away from St Helena, speeding on till the stockade dwindles into a gray coat and till the wood crowned hills 3111k into the foam flecked sea. In the little cabin, where the officers dispense their hospitality, there is much talk of convict ways by hard working trencher men " They're a lazy lot," says a bluff sailor, as one who knows, "they're fed too well and do too little work Why, a gang of them came to clean the Otter one day and fairly slammed the job When they were going off one complained to me that it was the hardest day's work he had done for years He looked like it, too, though one now may have to do the same every day in the week " The sailor, not being an expert, evidently didn't believe in not keeping a convict's face to the grindstone
