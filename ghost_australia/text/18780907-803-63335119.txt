" Oh for a lodge iu some vast wilderness ! Some boundless contiguity of shade." So sang the poet when fretted and worried with the little daily cares of life- he yearned to be cradled for a while in the lap of nature, where his over- wrought nerves, too sensi- tively strung for the discords of hard practical worldly warfare, might be soothed with the solemn calm of the woodland's " Dim religious aisles of leafy shade," and, breathing the larger breath of Nature, his whole being become strengthened and reattuned into harmony with his kind ; and although, fortunately for themselves, and for the mere material progress of things the bulk of mankind have neither the super-sensitiveness of the poet nor his desire to flee from cities ; still there is a very large minority, aud of that minority, most of them leading men in their respective callings, who for a time also feel an unutterable weariness of their daily treadmill, and without wishing to utterly cast away spear and buckler, and flee from the battle of life, yet sorely long to unbuckle their harness for a short while and rest in wearied peace where silent plains widening into purple distances, misty mountains, or the unbounded ocean main soothe every jaded feeling with their passionless beauty and the sense of calm which their awful antiquity, and (comparedto us) eternity of unchangeableness seem to suggest. To such an one, alter but the poet's mere words, for the spirit is still the same, to " Oh for a lodge in some sweet wilderness With boundless contiguity of ocean waves." and within an hour's journey of Sydney itself he will find all that even the most world-wearied soul could wish-in the grassy slopes, the fragrant pine trees, the wildwood boscage and greenery of the old bush carefully preserved by a loving and appreciative hand; the secluded valley "forest fringed" and murmurous with' falling waters, fed by living springs which have never failed, and the little sheltered bay golden with sifted sands shaded by trees and guarded by cliffs, ancient as time, within whose bosom the wild waves seem to creep quietly for rest and to glide gently iu their pale green purity over such a shore and strand as must haye lived in the idea of the " Poet of all time " when he sang " Come unto these yellow sands." Oh brook and bay of many uames ! by which shall I call thee ? by the soft sounding yet strong-syllabled native one of ["Yarana," by the partly fit, yet wholly harsh one of 1 " Rochbrook," by the savagely simple one of " The Gunyah," by the old-world vigorous-sounding one of "Trelinn," the "place of waters!" (surely none fitter than this-with thy ceaseless creek rushing swiftly down to the sheltered embracing bosom of the ceaseless sea)-or by the other old world Cornish one of " Cambourne-veau "-a crooked little stream, dear by old associations, and sufficiently near the description to be also.fairly appropriate ; but, still of all these, surely none is better thau the first ! We have driven the native owners from their once " happy hunting grounds." We have obliterated them and their's, and almost the very memory of the time " When wild in woods the noble savage ran," and may we not at least leave the poor consolation to their " wandering disembodied shades," of the memory of the old names remaining unchanged, and even though " their place shall know them no more," and they themselves shall " be forgotten of time," amongst their successors and sup planters, yet that the name which symbolized freedom, and freshness, and abel ter, and shade to them, may also remain to realize it to those who hold it now and to those who may come hereafter as the " heirs of all the ages." Quoth the " ancient mariner " on his lonely ocean, " Water, water, everywhere-but not a drop to drink !" and whilst the settler on the plains of Cumberland, and the shepherd on the desolated, rolling plains of the far west, hourly echo the last words of the despairing . cry of the forlorn mariner-and the streets of the cities are as dust and ashes, and the very watershed of Waverley an arid waste-thy hill embosomed valley, musical with murmurous streams and the cool, sounding, ceaseless plash of falling waters, and carpeted with its " bush grasses, green and deep," soothes the very eye- sight with its sweeping breadths of cool verdure and shades oí " immemorial trees "-trees older than the memory oí living man-trees whose very trunks seem to have grown grey with time, whilst their boughs yet flourish in a vigorous " green old age "-trees which have been bathed with the dews and strengthened with the storms of ages, and have silently watched the centuries pass away as they strongly sprung from seed to sapling, and sturdily grew into um- brageous vigour and slowly hardened into rugged, gnarled streugth, ere the years when Columbus was a child dreaming of Cathay, or before the squadrons of La Perouse and Cooï loomed up in shadowy whiteness from the stormy south and sailed silently past like wave-swept drifting clouds. A massy-limbed, rugged-rinded, moss-bearded, old tree gnarled by long struggling through the storms of ages, anc dented with the slow gnawing tooth of time, gives to man Í profound sense of hoar antiquity and of the iinmeasurabh ancientness of nature's forest patriarchs, and can only per haps be surpassed in the reverential thoughts that it suggest by the " everlasting hills " themselves ; or even, because th broad, measureless sweep of the solemn mountains fadini colossally into dim distance is almost too overpowering ii its seeming infinity of size and might for the finite humai soul to cope with, or fully realize-by some antique lichen veined, iron gray, adamant frowning pile of immovable roc' rising lonely and sternly out of a quiet sweeping breadth o close-swathed grass, and sleeping restful in the summer sue light, amidst the tender greenness, like some petrified, iror ribbed, mammoth relic of old preadamite ages, left strande by forgotten deluges on the earliest shores of time, and a massively set in the pleasant land in its storm-bleache savage grandeur, as the ancient, wrinkled, mouutain peaks c some long sunk continent of old raises its isolated bul amidst the pure, sapphire-hued waters of some sunny se¡ Vast nature's, all but eternal, unspoken sermon, shrined i stone-to which the pyramids are but as temples of yeste: day, and the faint cadences of Memnon in the morning su but as the meaningless murmurs of a little child ! Here, where civilization is so new, and primeval nature £ old, some relics of her unbroken sway yet remain untouche and uudefaced by the smug vandalism of " modern improvi ment," and in the rugged, hoary Banksias and the lonely dai massed mound of rocks, heaped together like the titan ruins of some forgotten " Stonehenge " of the falle demigods, man sees the traces of the slow calm fing' touches of time upon them, and dreaming of their unknov age and of the wondrous changes they have silently ai ceaselessly watched, learns to feel his own fleeting littlene and to reverently realize the full meaning of the Psalmisi "For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, becau our days upon earth are a shadow "-and, " What is mt that thou shouldest magnify him, and that thou shoulde set thy heart upon him ?" By whatever name it is, or was called, it was evidently place of some importance in the eyes of the aborigines, ai has also the dignity even of early Colonial history attach to it, as there can be no doubt, from the exact descriptif given, that it was the spot selected for the meeting betwei Governor Phillip and the Port Jackson tribes, then numberii about 3,000, when " grievances" about missing soldiers ai quieted savages (" they make a solitude and call it peace had to be talked over and mutually (?) adjusted. And ev now, after all the past years of spoliation and wreckage timber stealers, settlers, and other modern savages, whom a green tree seems as hateful au abomination as e\ the "sacred groves of Baal" were of old time to t iconoclastic Hebrews, there remains enough evidence its former forests and shelter for game, and all that satisfi the simple needs of savage life, to prove its natu, superiority as a permanent camping ground over any otl bay or valley from the South Head down to Botany itse and under careful and appreciative tendance the remaini relics of the past may yet lie protected in the present, a preserved for the future, and posterity thus enjoy an i bought pleasure, through the thoughtful prescient care, whi believes with Keats, that " A tiling of beauty is a joy for ever." When Tennyson wrote the following passage in his "L01 Eaters" he must have had some such " verdant valley " thine for his ideal " " To hear the dewy echoes calling From cave to eave thro' the thick tivined vine, To watch th« emerald-coloured water falling Thro' many a wov'n acanthus wreath divine ! Onlj to hear and ¿HU t he far-off sparkling brine Only to hear were sweet-stretched out beneath the pine. ' Only alter the " acanthus wreath divine " to " cluste: ferns " and it exactly describes the waterfall as seen betw< their green stems : " Here are cool mosses deep, And through ti.o liions the ivies creep, . And in tho stream the long-leaved flowers weep, Aud from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep !" Only substitute the delicately blue forget-me-not for poppy and the whole verse is a " word picture " of very spot 1 It is just the idyllic retreat where some overworked bril wearied man of taste, if released for awhile from his worl day cares and troubles might " rest and be thankful," and j almost realise the desire of the wearied mariner of Ulysses sore tired of " Ever climbing up the climbing wave," when, in the land of the " Lotophagii," they rested awhile from their weary labour at the oar, and hymned out their stately-measured choric song,-? " Why are we weighed upon with heaviness, And uttevly consumed with sharp distress, While all things else have rest from weariness ? Ail things have rest-why should we toil alone? We only toil who are the first of things, And make perpetual moan, Still from one sorrow to another thrown - Nor ever fold our wings And cease from wanderings, Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm, Nor hearken what the inner spirit sings ' There is no joy but calm !' " Ah, when will man grow wiser than to live to work, instead of only working to live- as nature and his Maker intended him ? Wise Wordsworth says, " The world is too much with us," and as a notion we shall neither grow healthier, wealthier (in its higher sense), nor wiser, till we give up less to the world and more to nature, and giving ourselves time to live, as well as to merely exist (as now), spend at least some reasonable portion of our lives in scenes like thine, and so learn to " Look through Nature up to Nature's God." "Happy is the land," said the moralist, " that has no history," and Mundarrah's modern history may be summed up very shortly : It was originally built by a Dr. Dickson, and it was on the flat headland in the rear of the grounds that the celebrated (?) Miss Dickson had her exercise ground for her stud of racers, whose training she personally super- intended, and, like a daughter of Diomed, " led her crested steeds, panting and foam-flecked, from the fields of war to the salt margin of the much-resounding sea." The solemn headlands afar, the surging seas, and the breaker-girdled breezy flat-with its half dozen blood colts -almost as wild as the wild scenery about them, careering swiftly on, and outlined against sky and sea-must have made up a striking picture to the onlooker-and had at least so many of the elements of romance about it as to neutralize partly the " turfy " ideas that a jockey's jacket and cap invariably suggest ; however, that picture is now only a fleeting vision of the past, for they and their singulaï mistress have alike passed away-unto other possibly "happy hunting grounds," and their place "knows them no more ': -peace to their "manes," literally as well as figuratively, and over equine and gynecine we charitably echo Coleridge's pious chant, " The good knights are dust, Their swords are rust. Their souls are with the saints, we trust !" The daughter's hobby was horses ! the father's was levellinj a hill to fill up a hollow, and then trying how much mon money he could spend in terracing and embankments-si that, in the end, however really comfortable and roomy th house was, the cost of the grounds, as compared to it wa like Falstaff's " sherris sack " to the bread in his vintner' account, excepting that here the parallel ends, as, mos probably, the worthy (?) knight's tradesmen were not paid whilst the doctor's were ; and, therefore, if he were not sadder, he must at least have been a wiser man, before h finally left, as to what it may cost a man of taste (?) t indulge his mania in landscape gardening ! It was afterwards held by other parties, and, finally, " in th chances and chauge of the tides of time,'' for " what can hid man from mutability?" passed away from them into the posses! ion of the late Samuel Bennett, who did as much for the hous as the original owner did for the grounds, and, making du allowance for the difficulty there necessarily is in adding i or altering an original design, on a larger scale, the effect : really very good, and the cloistered front, with embattle towers at each end, and its long line of over a hundred fei jiidiciously broken by a mural crowned facade, and tl northern side, with its enclosed lawn, supported by a mass crenellated stone wall, and its sea frontage at the bat (more Hibemicof) strongly, yet cosily verandahed in, givi to the whole house, whether looked at in its own groun< or from the surrounding hills, an imposing - not to st even stately appearance-and calls up pleasantly old rnemori \- to some of us at least - of the old-fashioned man< houses in the "Old Country." It only wants an old* avenue of trees, with the cawing of ancient rooks therein ai thereon, to recall more fully pleasant, sunny, sandy Susse with its sweet, wild downs-the sleeping sea afar off, and tl dwelling, part old grange, part older abbey, and part new mansion, yet all mellowed by time and use, and blendin as a whole, into one of those old-world, yet home-lik thoroughly comfortable country houses, which make one the greatest charms in English scenery, and whose owne live perhaps the lives most to be envied in the whole worl However, the proverb says, a " live dog is better than a dei lion," and therefore a new house must surely be better thi an old one, especially if the latter has ghosts to scare the mai as well as draughts to sciaticise the master, rats in t! crannies, moths in the tapestry, and dry rot in the woo work-and to come down to the bathos of common troubl« smoky chimneys ! So farewell to the romance of the ps and welcome the wholesome comfort of the present. "V are "off with the old house," so let us "be on with t new," and when in a few more years the stone work h caught a mellower tint from the smile of the sun, and t firs in the avenue have grown into the dignity of ceda: the new house here and its surroundings, will look aime as old an institution in the land as the old one there d: (and still does we hope) besides resting under sunnier ski and overlooking wider seas, and sheltering a stronger ra< So " mote it be." Within a few hundred feet from the house itself (in straight line), though probably half a mile round by the or practicable approach to it, there rises, or rather upbursts the next ocean inlet to the south, a massy precipice wall slate, disrupting the line of cliffs and changing them ir columnar sandstone on either side of it, and towering gre; aloft and looming ledge upon ledge along for hundreds feet in a dark and solemn grandeur, which seems to typ a worn-out repose, the wavelets of the sheltered bay washi the fallen blocks of it as smooth as soapstone, and for e^ fretting away the base of it into step upon step of round stairs. There is something singularly attractive, and yet wit] solemnly suggestive in it. Standing out as it does dari alone, amidst the long coast line of light tinted sandstc cliffs, and looking as though it were a portion of some oh and earlier creation, left like a stranded and forgotten isla in the ooze of the subsiding oceans of the fluvial world ; else, in the ages of fire, heaved up from tartarean depi through unknown abysms, and left lonely buttressed ami the half dried drift of lacustrine deposits, slowly harden! as they slowly emerged from the sluggish receding seas of the unknown past to grow into the adamantine bulwarks of the newer continents of the present. Awful antiquity is graved and lined in every scarped edge and crumbling ledge of its ancient massy bulk; from its mighty base, sloping darkly smoothened into the shallow waters, and washed for ever by the ceaseless sea up to its beetling brow ; scarred by the tempests and bleached by the suns of the unending cycles of time ; whilst clusters of deli- cate ferns, nestled aloft in every nook and cranny, like miniature hanging gardens greenly gleaming o'er its dark and weather-worn breast, relieve the sombreness of its gloomy grandeur with their delicate traceries and clinging groups, and seem to blend into one " toned down " picture, the bright life of the blooming present with the hoary ruins of the dead past. Ledge upon ledge, cranny, and cave, oozing springlets, and trickling waters, high overhanging eaves whereunder the wild birds build and mate (sure and safe from spoliation by all mortal hands) in all its giant bulk of length and breadth and height-from base to summit it is a solemnly noble sermon of nature's own teaching in stone ; and in its hoary look of silent and slow decay, speaks more solemnly of the wondrous works of Him " within the hollow of whose hand are the Heavens, the earth, and all therein "-than does the mightiest cathedral built by the hands of man, which after all is but mere " Fragments of stone, reared by creatures ot clay;" built to last for a few passing centuries, and then crumble into an undistinguished ruin, and lie buried amidst the dust of outworn and forgotten creeds. Whilst here, not only time, but even almost eternity seems to unveil one of the myriad altars of the Eternal, and to awe the beholder into sudden worship and unspoken prayer and praise, until humbled in mind, but elevated in soul, he at last reverently returns from his pilgrimage to this grand shrine of nature's unchanging religion, realizing fully what our great " im- mortal sings " I love not mau the less, but Nature more, From these our interviews, in which I steal, From what I may be, or have been before, To mingle with the universe, .and feel, What, I can ne'er exni'ess. yet cannot all conceal."
