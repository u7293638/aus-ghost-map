PRESBYTERIAN GENERAL ASSEMBLY The Anna in General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Queensland was held in the Park Church, South BY issue, last evening The attendance was a huge one The opening religious service was conducted by the Model late, Rev Peter Robertson (Ipswich), the text of the sermon being St John m , Jo After the sermon the assembly was constituted in the usual way, and the elders and clergy took their seats within the court. The report of the committee appointed to ox imme the minutes of the last assembly and compile the permanent second was led by the clerk (Rev A Hay), and being agreed to, the second was signed by the moderator The toll of the assembly was then called over, most of those on it answering to their names The MoDLitATon thanked the assembly for the position it had placed him in at its last meeting, and for the kindness and consideration which they had shown towards his inexperienced line He regretted exceedingly that ill health had prevented his carrying out the purposes he had formed for his year of modointoiship He had meant to carry out what he believed to be the duty of all moderates and to visit the churches, for now thou Church had fallen too much into the routine of Congregation ibsm -(applause) as if they had no living head amongst them no believed it would be a wise thing if the Church could make arrangements by which the moderator should make a succession of visits It was wonderful the effect which a now face had-a loving, 1 fully face going to v Strand open only was this so in the otitly tug congregations it had an amazing effect in producing fi eternal love, and, he believed also, great activity in the congregations, when the voice speaking was the voice of one who occupied the highest post and who had received the greatest honours that this Church could bestow upon him He now returned the office into the hands, chiming their forgiveness for all his shortcomings, and expressing the desire that in the future greater things might be done by their Church than she had ever been seen to do in the past He had now to announce, as com area of the committee appointed to select and nominate a moderator for the current year, that in the beginning of January he issued invitations to all the members entitled to vote, and as the result of the meeting he had now to intimate to the assembly that their choice had fallen upon the Rev Charles Ogg He, therefore, now had to propose that Mr. Ogg be elected by the assembly to this honourable position Roi A Hu seconded the nomination, saying that he had much pleasure in doing so, us Mr Ogg was one of the oldest ministers of the Chin oh-in fact might be regarded with Dr. Nob on, as one of the fathers of the Ghin cb in Queensland He had rendered good service to it, both in days gone by and in their own day, and had so established his right to sit in the Moderator's chair as well as by his profound knowledge of-ho was going to say Canon law but especially of Presbyterian Church law But it was altogether unnecessary to enumerate the chums w high Mt Ogg had to the respect and honour of the Assembly (Applause ) The motion was carried unanimously, and Mr Ogg having been voted, took the chair, and was cordially greeted by the members present He then delivered the following inaugural address - Fathers and Brethren. Accept of my thanks for the honour by you have conferred upon me in so cordially electing me to preside over your deliberations in this assembly This is now the third time, during my thirty-two years of ministerial labour in Australia that I have been placed by my brethren in the moderator's churches, when out people were connected with the Synods in the parent colony of New South Wales, and now, twice since the formation of our Piosby terrain Church of Queensland In addressing you at the commencement of the proceedings of this session, allow me, for a little, to glance at the past history of Piosby terms in this part of Aust b i In doing so, my end will be attained if many way I can strengthen your hands a man lying on the blessed work of extending the Redeemer's Kingdom amongst us Perhaps the most concise way of bottling our only state before you will be by referring to the printed " Summary of Proceedings " in my possession Photo, it is stated, that Long pi ox tons to, and ovenstiicothosopaiationof Moreton Bay into the colony of Queensland, the number of Piosby - terian ministers engaged in active duty was small At the beginning of 1882 there were only three minister regularly and statedly ministering to congregations Since then several additional ministers have aimed in the colony Then presence cheered the he arts, and revived the hopes of those who had long and earnestly desired an organised church in Queensland " New what made us long so earnestly for this was the fact that our eccle suistical connections with the Synods in the p none colony proved injurious to us by uphold nig divisions, which, in our case, had no bases to rest upon Aftoryotrsof depressing work, however, we at last obtained the object of our desires in the beginning of November, 1863, the Synods with which we were connected met in Sydney, md to those I replied with the view of obtaining the orderly Bop station from them, and authority to connect out selves with others who had recently formed informing a Church in this of long independent of all outside ecclesiastical control Those Church Courts at length saw our position and divinities, sy nips lived with us, and passed resolutions authorising us to proceed in accordance with our desire, and on my return with the necessary documents tho recently an ned ministers and the elders who had taken part in forwarding the work met with us in my church on the 24th November, 1 SO i, nil for mod the Piesbj ter ian Church of Queens land, is recorded in our minutes Of those who took part in our pt cedings on that occa skin only the Rev A C Smith besides my sell is now present with us Two of the masters not then present joined us afterwards, and thus all the ministers and congi gallons of our denomination in the colony were united into one Church, and, let us trust, by the good hand of our God upon us shall ever so lemon Our action was approved by all the home Cliutehos from which we came, as they saw that the causes of separation amongst them there did not exist amongst us here in this new (ountiyattho antipodes and so much and all of them have united in helping us, both by men and mc mi, to build up our Church on the basis of the standing I common to all the Presby tor um Churches tlnoiiglioiit the world And now that we are hole met in the twenty fourth year of our existence as a Church, I cannot but be glad as I contrast the appeal mee of this assembly with the small first in other"" of our Supreme Court, combined with the ia t that Ino presbyteries are represented in it in place of only one as it best And may I not take this as of itself the exponent of its progress that ought to one mirage us all in on rv mg on with renewed under the work of the Lord in this important colony But there are other things beside this which ought to cheer us in the midst of the difficulties, both within and without which are also st niece- intly n wing to test our faith and a science I shall first cut out to the success that has attended our efforts to train a ministry in the colony, Soon after our union it lee uno apparent that we could not one mi a "supply of suitable ministers from home, and the pressure of our people for ministrations compelled us to take some steps to supply those Htnco, ultimately, by the help of some of our office bearers and members, also our Divinity Hall, with its classrooms and excellent library Students desirous of preparing for the ministry came" and both they and those of us who t night wrought hard to accomplish our object Years were required before results could be known, and now ; since those j cal s have passed, what are the results? Have we been able to educate those who have finished their studies up to the standard required by the home Churches, and ne there any of our own students now ministers of charges? Beginning with the last of these questions we are able to point to the fact that one third of our charges are now ministered to by them both in towns and country, in a way and with a success that line for home have been able to excel, mind as to my training as compared with that of the home Churches, wohivoonlj had one of our students, out of the, equal to him, who has gone home and hostel the matters, and the question has been solved by his t king a front place amongst the students in the University of Edinburgh and carrying off first and second prizes Billing both of the two years he spent there, besides other certificates of somewhere only those were awarded, and by his services in the home pulpits being so appreciated that he was invited to accept a change there, and, I may add that, on his annual again amongst us and obtaining license, two simultaneous calls vi to get on him from two of our impor- that city charges And what makes this sucCess the most encouraging is the fact that it has been achieved whilst out as mgomentsfoi odwatmg out ministers in the colony are, as yet in an imperfect state and our teaching staff and ill, and its hands full of pastor al and other ecclesiastical of oak Now, however, when we have assisting us the most unthinking tutor we have yet had, an offer of our own Church whose sympathy with um students' then studies has gained the esteem for himself and a love for their work and when our own students, now in our ministry, are capable of of aiding in the work of the ball, is called on to do so and others are no mug from the home Chun lies capable of shining in it, the prospect is opening up before us of a success that we little the night would attend on efforts to help ouioelicsin this matter when no others could But this rapid glance at one of the most vital matters affecting the interests of our Church would not be complete were I not to mention the fact that our people are appreciating the value of our Divinity Hall and our manner of training ministers, by at once accepting them as thou p sisters in her they have completed the same medium of their studies and by the glow nig disposition to make better provision for the support of those who so long and so laboriously seek to qualify themselves for the high calling of being follow workers together with God in the sale allow of men And, no v, let me give a word of encouragement to my brethren Inborn ing in places remote from us here in Brisbane I know from poisonaloxpnuenco the perplexing and vin tons difficulties which they have to con- tend with, but I trust they all know whence to obtain strength to endure them all as good soldiers of Jesus Christ None of them have the want of the benefit of our system of Church got command which our city ministers had to endure, by being oOO 01 GOO aided away from the sons of presbytery, with none to counsel or so sympathise with them in their turns But yet we have lived to see another and happier state of things, and so will these brethren, I am fully persuaded do if sp and to us in the good providence of God, and baling dedicated to our system of Church government I have frequently noticed how little knowledge exists of the scriptural foundation upon which it rests, and the need of availing our flies of favourable opportunities to bring this before our people The Sabbath School Committee endeavoured to take action in this direction during the past year by prescribing a textbook on the subject to our senior scholars for examination, but sufficient numbers of the one fixed upon could not be had in time for this year's OMiimiiatun that they will be got and used in the way by indicated will, I have no doubt, be the best way of enlightening our young people on this important subject that this matter is lightly treated by some only shows their ignorance of the mine attached to it in the word of God, and its boiling upon vitalCliiistiainty How careful was the apostle Paul to see that his servants should be gathered together into church under the government of Piesbj tons "For this cause, willes ho to Titus, left I thee in Crete, that thou should set in order the things that were wanting and appoint presbyters in every city, as I gave thee charge" And Jerome, the mostloiuncd of the Roman father s ' commenting on this bays, the Churches were governed by a common council of presbyters "-tom ititmßitabytcioi uni son the consisted Luke i limit him short wore presby terian Churches And th a field of Church or comment the apostle distinctly asssets his address to the presby

epistles ho hours Total styling himself, the presbytery " Doubtlo s, those two apostles remembered the rebuke their Master gain of his disciples when he attacked the first using amongst them of performers Booking in his kingdom -"It shall not be so among you" and hence it is that the majority of those who take the word of God alone as their authority, adopt this God-given form of Chin cb government Lot but a revival of true Christianity take place and Presbyterian Church government comes naturally as if part of it Lotus he u we li it John Wesley, the great To idea of roy iv al religion in England during this century, has to say it comes from i him in a learning to his intimate f neild JohnBiadburn " As soon as I am do at the Methodists will be a legal u Presbyterian Church and he aids, "we could not be Episcopalians, we will not, cannot be, Independents and, therefore, we must whenever we choose to call ourselves bo Prosbj tor ians " And why is till this But 1 list because no other system is unionists with and gives full scope to the religious life in planted in the soul by the spirit of God If on the one hand iv of have a sad blow of Clinch gay ornament which sacrifices the liber t ii here with Christ makes his people free to 'order,' and if on the other hand, another system which s icufiocsoidei robberty ,noithorciiiibcfiomGod I shall draw any reference to this subject to a close by quoting from the late Professor Charles lodge s work, "The Church and its Polite, who follow the passage s " It is no part of our Piesbj ton truism that God's people go out themselves, any more than a family governs itself In other vi olds, in the Christian Church as in a Christian family, the power and authority of the rules do not come from the people, but from Christ He committed the power to teach and Hill to certain officers, and director 1 them to communicate the same authority tootbets All the power The little comes from Him the money goes with the commission, which is second in cached from the officers, and not from the members of the Church The authority to exercise the power inherent in their respective offices over any congregation dopt rails on the will of that congregation, but not the power itself If I am ordained a amidst r of the gospel I have all the lights and punters attached by Christ to that office but I have no authority morally congregations that does not choose me as tin a pistol, or does not volun tank subject itself to the presbytery of which I am a member We are persuaded that this is the order which Christ has established in His own house for edification, and not for destruction ' One important subject I is no now only a few moments to speak of, and that is the running of the young of mu noel son Bible knowledge in the Sabbath school, but as one whole ironing is to be devoted to this work in connection with your committee's operations during the past year, and us you will then be addressed at length by those who iVo a prominent part in this work it is the less needful for me to now occupy your time in connection with it The union ii g either nig of the school in a of the various schools in the city is growing in interest, and that of last Sabbath was a sight that gladdened all our hearts Ministers and friends who have come to visit us from the neighbouring colonies, and have been present at and addressed those meetings on former occasions, have expressed their surprise at the numbers attending on S sabbath schools, and of the proofs of the excellence of the training they are under her fathers and brethren, The year on which we are now not forms was an epoch in the history of our empire half a century will in a few weeks have rolled past since our gracious Queen Victoria ascended the throne During that long period she has exercised an influence for good, not only over the vast realms that own the sway of his! sceptre, but over the world at huge Her sympathy with her people in all ranks of life in times of aviation has been given so frequently and promptly as to draw forth the admit action of her subjects and whereas her n and is known, author patronage of all that is good and elevating has given on couragement to innumerable workers in the benevolent enterprises that have adorned her long reign During that time the colony in which we dwell and upon which she bestowed her titular name, has springs infooxiätonco, and her possessions in Australia in giving proof to-day that the foundations of a great empire is being strongly laid by its peoples. It is our duty to labour that it may be founded on that righteousness that alone will give it strength and prosperity You will, no doubt, take an opportunity of giving expression to our well known regard for her Majesty s person and loyalty to the tin one It will, I know, he hearty for no monarch has ever taken but li an interest in the land and its people from which so many of us come, and so valued the services of our Church and its ministers And now I pray that the Spirit which our only King and neild promised as a perpetual gift tents people, may so guide us in all our deliberations that till bImIIissuo in promoting the glory of God, and the welfare of the flocks over the which the Holy Ghost hath made us over seers Amen BUSINESS OF SESSION Roy D P MiroitLu said he believed this was the time to call attention to the presence of a minister of the Victorian Church, who was also a son of one of their own respected ministers the Rev A C.
