THE JAPANESE M.P. , Japan has borrowed Parliamentary institutions, amongst other luxuries, from the "West; and, since human nature under all skins is pretty much the same, the Japanese M.P. quickly develops all the familiar vices of the M.P. under other skies. He “wobbles” and “dodges;” he “sits on u fence ;” he joins with his follow legislators in “ log-rolling ” perfor mances on the largest scale; and having onco secured his seat, ho calmly ignores his constituents until the next election is in sight. But Japanese constituents deal faithfully with their guilty representatives According to Mr Rudyard Kipling, “a Badical Member of Parliament at Tokio has just got into trouble with his constituents, and they have sent him a priceless letter of reproof. Among other things, they point out that a politician should not be ‘ a waterweed, which wobbles hither and thither according to the mo tion of the stream.’ Nor should he ‘ like a ghost without legs, drift along before the wind.’ ‘ Tour conduct,’ they say, ‘ has been that of both a water weed and a ghost, and we purpose in a little time to give you proof of our true Japanese spirit.’" This particular member of Parliament, Mr Rudyard Kipling reports, “ will very probably be mobbed in bis ’rickshaw and prodded to inconvenience with sword- sticks ; for- the constituencies are most enlightened. But how in the world can a man under these skies behave ex we not amongst ourselves honorable members who resemble “drifting water weeds” and “legless ghosts,” even without the poor excuse of the enervating Japanese climate ? It is in the air, even in this colony—“the wobble and the leg less dri,t ”—and who alas! can invent a cure for it ? These Tokio radicals, how ever, have at least enriched the political vocabulary by one or two delicious phrases. .
