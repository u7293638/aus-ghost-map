TRIPS ROUND THE WORLD.—The South Australian Register has been shown by Mr. C. L. Wragge, F.R.G.S., now on a visit to Adelaide, "the prospectus of a company which has lately been formed under the patronage of the Royal Geographical Societies of France and England, and other scientific associations, to pro- mote a practical knowledge of the resources and pro- ductions of the different countries of the world, and of the commercial and industrial position of the different nations, as well as their wants, habits, and institutions. A large steamer, possessing rapidity, will leave Havre (France) every year in the north of May, beginning in 1877, and return to Marseilles ten months after. She has been specially constructed, and fitted up by a Havre firm with a view to the purpose for which she is designed, and contains cabin accommodation for fifty first-class passengers, no other class being taken. She is to carry several special professors and an experi- enced physician, and a well-selected library, maps, instruments of natural philosophy and meteorology, &c.;, will be placed at the disposal of the passengers ; while the co-operation of the Patronage Committee, consisting of the most eminent French scientists of the day, among whom we may mention M de Lesseps, will, by means of letters of recommendation, enable the passengers to inspect all the places and establish- ments of interest in the different countries visited. The steamer will be commanded by a lieutenant of the French navy, and is, we are told, likely to have her passenger-list well filled. The object of these voyages is to offer to young men who have finished their edu- cation a still further opportunity of gaining a practical and superior instruction, to be acquired by a journey round the world, accomplished in every aspect under the most favourable conditions ; and secondly, to en- able every person having a taste for travel to visit in one year, without a change of ship, and in a manner at once instructive, interesting, and agreeable, the most distant and the most remarkable points of the globe. In short, while taking care to avoid all the in- converience and delays usually attending long voyages, to introduce the elements of instruction in combination with comfort and pleasure. If the steamer starts as announced, in May next, we may expect her to pay Adelaide a visit before the end of the year." Eleven new cables are at the present writing in the course of construction, having a total length of 17,000 miles. The largest ones will connect Ireland and New Caledonia, 2188 miles ; Aden and the Mauritius, 2777 miles ; and Honolulu and Fiji Islands, 2876 miles. The strength and endurance of submarine cables depend upon the depths to which they are sub- merged and the nature of the ocean bottom on which they rest. If there are rapid currents and a rocky bottom, the cable must be made very solid and heavy. llio tables i f Hie Aiiclu Aiatiitaii Coluimny costfiUOO finnis jin kitonichu (ti2 of a mile) foi those xiluoh lie in tlie ilipllii of the iiconn, but those foi nemer shoie cost Id (lilli flancs pu kilonictie llieciblesliottieon 1 ngliiiiil nuil llollnnil mo constinoted almost tliiough thin entile length on tho model of the inslieno tunis ntlaiitit ml It« bee naso tlio xx atti tho xxholo distnncu is ci inpnintiiclx slinlloxi, mut lietel oNcicds tim ty falliólas nf «iluso thin costxxns heiixy A Scon li li-suxioMVi. - "Uolicniuxn," in tbo lire/ tills the fulloxxiuggood atoiy - A 1'icsbytciinu mtmstu in ii iici^boiii mg town xt as so ill supported by his congicgntiou that hu xxas obliged to resign Ile hull 1 oi low ed tit) dum n muiibti ni that congie gatiua xxlitch holiad nut tho ghost of a chunco of le paying Hint mcmbci suggested to tlio othoi mullins llio pi opt inly «if getting up ti testimonial to tbu ictn nig nmustci, mid jiiuscuting it to lum as n palting gilt Ibu thin« xina ngieed to, und the reiitlemnii xtho snt'gcstcd it xxns mailo ticiismoi of llio (mid When tlio siibsciiptioiis xiuo nil in thet nun initeil to l ill'is lui Die tieiismur uf tlio fund xxent and bought a new piuso, foi xxbleh ho pin) txxo shillings, gol sixpeniit wmth of nott biotuo coins, xx Inch hu hu put into tho pin so along with n rcceijit for tho X 10 1111 oxt ed money, und then ful meei uno of n ileputntinn lo tho imnistci, In pnscnt lum tilth tho pmso if money mid a xciy llnttoriug liddies.« Ibu ministti xtns n fecotsiiimi too, anil thucfoio it is st neely ueccssniy to say that ho thoinaghly aiprecinlcd thostein pioluty mid business like chniiittci of tim tiaasnttion, and was tjintu oxcicoinobx thu dullen« x, tact, and thscictiou xtith vx Inch thu Hung xxns tamed nut ft oin hist to last 1 lune un «le ubt thnt tho nimistci left luschmgo xxith a h"lil beni t nail n ele ii conscience lie xxns out of dclt nial mulei nu obligation to mix ona except fut thtn ! nubléis in ichctmg lum of his Inn ii cn Noxx Hint xuiy of helping ii niiiii uni xxiii nut cr dcinornli/e lulu Un tin conti ii', it xxiii tenth lum lossons of self rcbniiiu mut silfusiiet xxlitch hu nut« xxiii bo hkclt to folget V "Gummi s Axt VKIMI "-Ibu W'ttgiitt Wagga Ailtiitimi tells thu fi Hutt mg good stoty -Not moro limit 100 milts fiom beni ii tcitiuu utboiitl xxlioao uiiifoiiii is bim (and xthosu looks xxtio likottiso blue nflci (hu ibtcoxtiy of (ho lilla tpismlo xxobnxo to lolnli), with full blotxii nutlioiitx xtont tit gumti tho motUIH uf thu public! nt it bttlu inline tlillico xtlicro titan spin Is quick nuil leiidy, mid a Jiberu!
