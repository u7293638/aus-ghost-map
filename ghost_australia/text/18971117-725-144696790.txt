T3AY2LL2R. IRVINE PROPHETESS'S CABfi^V The last ef thB'BuchariiteB, Aadrew^nes, was alive less than fifty yeaira :|agbV.. A': Bufihanite he a-ntinned flryn io ^ejltid-^ft be We Thi^ rpea^S'^^^ Godhead incarnate, who . managed ib s^U«f jrom sis ; vainusm tne xteuet minister *ot Irvinej and acclaimed him the Maii Ohild of Revelation ard hersdf his spiritual mother, who persuaded a large company of people to journey with her to Zion, and who actually imbued them with the belief that feha would translate the whole of them to Heaven with* out tasting of death. It is a long time sinoe the story bae been told, and it will well bear re-telling; ?Elepetb, or Elspath, Simpson was the child of poor parents, and her early years in Banffshire were spent in poverty. She had a natural aversion to manual labour* and when circumstances brought her to the South- West of Scotland she associated with evil company, and contracted those loose notions of m alimony that played so promi nent a part in the faith of whioh she was founder. She is said to have married a working potter at Ayr, named Robert Buchan, but of this there is no record in the parish papers. She lived but . a short time with her husband, who, shooked with her immorality, took her baok to Banffshire, where he left her to provide for herself as best she could. She' had 'two daughters and a eon, whom she scandalously neglected, 4 to carry out the details of a divine apocalypse 9 charging her with a heavenly mission. This was in the year 1774. She remained in tbe North, warring with the clergy, disonssing her as yet unformulated mission, and spread* ing dispeace in the community ; bat her manner of life was moat offensive to those with whom she was conneoted, and she had very little success. She returned to her husband in Glasgow in 1761, and he reoeived her cordially. The Rev. Hugh White, minister of the Relief Congregation of Irvine was at that time one of tbe znotit popular preachers of his sect in the West of Sootland. In December of 1793 Mrs. Buchan heard him preach at a Sacrament in Glasgow, and being captivated with his oratory, she wrote to him as 4 one whom she loved in our sweet Lord' Jesus Christ/ and' as 4 a promised segd actually born from above/ Mr. White, thongh a man of some erudition and before- I time a Professor of Logio in an American ] College, was exceedingly flatterwd by the oomplimantstif his; admirer, and in 1793 he1 tait*!ier tolrvine, w^ere ihewaslweU received by the Belief congregation, and j where her heavenly conversation and- extra- i ordinary gifts caused her to be regarded as a ! valuable acquisition to tbe party. When 1 she left Irvine to return for a little to Glas- 1 gow, she wrote to Mr. White, 1 her dear child/ and hailed him as one chosen of God. ! Mr White reciprocated her admiration of him i and deolared her to be a-saint of no ordinary description, and the harbinger of a light that would unveil the darkness of Antichrist that bad long overshadowed manv lands. This was more than a section of hie flock could etand, and they brought the matter before the Presbytery. Hie friends did all they oould, partly for his own sake and partly for the sake of his wife and two young children, but 4Luokie Buchan/ as she was familiarly called in Irvine, persuaded him to etand firm. This he did, and aooordingly in August, 1783, he was, unanimously suspended by his co -Presbyters from the exercise of his minis terial functions. Driven oat of the Belief Church, Mr. White preached in his own house and in his ; garden, and' several -pumbers of his old con- . negation rallied round him, including Peter i Hunter, the Town XJlerk, ahft~John Gibson, i a well-to-do-builder. -The people of the town, however, were alive to tine scandal, and they angrily demanded - that Luokie should be expelled from Ihe town. To4his the magistrates would not consent, and the mob took tbe matter into their own hands. They broke the doom and windows of Mr. Hunter's house, and when Mrs. Bachan, who was with them tried to escape they ! intercepted her. 4 After dragging her through all the streets of the town, nearly io a sUte of nudity, many were for ducking her in the river, but the majority was for houndiog her home to her husband to the sound of an old tin kettle, and they actually traLed her to Stewarton, a village eight miles distant from Irvine, on tbe road to Glasgow/ 4 They would raise her up/ aocording . to the testi mony of one of her friends, who followed in tbe hope of rescuing ber from the hands of tbe crowd, 4 as high aB they could, calling aloud for her to fly now to heaven like Enoch or Elijah, at the same time letting her drop to tbe ground, exclaiming, 4 She oannot fly yet; we mast take her a litte further andtzy her Again/ and would fcm party ^opposed jhrmj 9%y\ng^* She has done ' us no personal lharm, therrfore we will ®ot^ kill her outright— let her husband do tbat if : he pleases when he gets her home/ Lnckie I managed to creep back to Irvine in a most pitiable plight— bareheaded, barefooted, with - scarcely a rag to cover her nakedness, and covered with blood. Yet she was obeerful,' aud acoepted persecution as the jprioe ebe must pay for her convictions. Fearful of further outrage Luckie, or Friend Mother as her disciples now called her, waa sent off to Glasgow, and thence eo Muthill, in Perth- . shire, whence she wrote characteristic letters to her .'dearest, dear Man Child, Mr. White. 4 My body,' ebe wrote, in a postscript, * is loaded with a great cald,- bu1 my senses are like pipes of new wise, - all running from a free fountain/ The Man Child followed her, : but his reosption in Mutaill was so £is» rouraging, aa he openly exposed the errors of the Confession of FaitE^that he returned with his spiritual mother to 'Irvine, where tho riots began afresh, and whence the magistrates deoreed the expulsion of lire.

Luokie Buchan and Mr. White had by this time led 1hem all to believe lhat in a little time they would be taken bodily up into heaven, and they waited in faith for the hour of -ascension. One night they heard what tbey took to be a great voioe from .the clouds. The children, accompanied by 4 our great luminary, ' struok Up their favourite hymn— , ^ 0 hasten translation and oome resurrection ; 0 hasten the coming of Christ in the air. And there was a rushing together of the party from every corner of the house. Mr. Hunter tumbled down the loft in his hurry, but' instantly bounded from the ground cry ing * Hasten translation/ A . scene of in tense excitement and bodily agitation fol lowed. The farmer oame rushing in, deter mined to go up with the rest. All were ready for the aerial journey when Luckie destroyed their hopes by telling them that she saw they were. hot yet ready for theohange. Then 4 she called for a tobaodo pipe and took a smoke/ In the morning the floor of the apartment was' found to be 4 etrewed with watches, gold rings,' and a great number of trinkets whioh had been, in the moment of expeoted translation, thrown away as useless in oar expeoted oountry. My own watoh/ adds the chronicler, 4 was of the number. 1 never saw it shore, but I afterwards learned tbat John Gibson, our treasurer, had collected all the watches and jewellery then thrown ; away and. sold them in :Dumfries/ The Bame authority averred that Friend Mother's faoe shone with the lu&txe; of' the Trana- 1 figuration, a proof that she was the Divine Person Mr. White represented her to be/ Luokie attribated the - failure to asoend to a lack of faith .and ^ordained a -fast' of-forty ? dap andJortynightalnorder^o^repareher followers for translation; 'To ihis ordeat the deluded Bnohanitesoonsehted, and for nearly six weeks; with theexception of Mrs. Buchan herself and Mr. White,' they all bnt starved. Luokie allowed them no solid food.': She gave them occasionally a httie treaele mixed with hot water, and, ihoredible «s it may seem, it really appears ae if this was all the nourishment they had. The appointed period having expired, Luckie led her dopes to the top of Templand Hill about eunrise. What , followed is described by a gentleman who chanced to pass the foot of the hill on horse baok, and who stealthily crept up to - witness the spectacle of fanaticism. 4 1 recognised several faces that I had seen at Buchan Ha', tarticularly that of Luokie Buchan herself, he was raised neatly her whole length above the crowd by whom she was surrounded, who stood with their faces to the rising aun and their arms extended upwards as if to clasp |the great luminary as he rose above tbe horiion/ -Afraid of being diaoovered, the observer retreated to a wayside , inn at Brownhill, where he encountered tbe land lord and two Bnohanites, who had played out when half-way -through the part, and | who were anxiously waiting to hear whether | the arcension had taken place and they had | been left behind. * A sentinel soon came i running in with breathless haste with the news that Luckie and the whole band were { on their way back to New Cample. We all | hastened to see them Tetrace their, steps to i their wonted abode ; and suoh a company of half- famished looking creatares I never saw before. They were all deadly pate aud emaciated to the last degree ; they geemed like living skeletons just eloped from the grave or newly imported from Ezekiel'e val ley of dry bones, with tbe exception of Luokie herself. She waa like one of those ;beautieB ; who crowd the canvas of painters with bil- ] locks of rosy flesh. Her hair was unbound, ' and hung profuBely over ber baok and ; shoulders/ The failure of the attempt to ascend shat tered the faith of some of the Buobauites, and though Luckie and the Man Child re ?maiued steadfast, tbe movement made no further headway. Luokie purified- the rem nant by;.a ceremony 'too rpdeib meet an «ar of jnodesty/ ThBre were.mm iarfn 'at worked .sway awhilennder theAOtiveeuper vision of the Friend ^Mother. Bj thlslUme, in l791, she bad reached the age of VBarf, bnt the hardehipsofher lot in life had told. SEvereiy upon Ira, and ebe became rapidly weaker. . She diedonilie 29 th of -March, 'but before ehe beoame -speechless she called her liUleflook about her, reaffirmed that ^he was the Spirit of God, ' that Christ was her elder .brother, and that die could not die. She. might appear to do so, eho added, ^at they were not to be disconraged, for she would only sleep. ' If their faith waa pure, with out aUpv, she. at the end of eii days, would return lor them, bnt if they remained laith- leu the would not return to take them to Heaven till tho end of ten years, when, if tbey etiU continued unprepared for the change, fifty years would elapse before she. would reappear on earth ; bat she would then at all events descend to convince tbe faith less world of jta error.'
