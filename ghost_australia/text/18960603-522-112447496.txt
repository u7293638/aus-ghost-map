THE Boatd of ?EduGiitiori of Chicago has completed what is -called its' ? " purified " version of the Bible for use in.schools. The committee in -charge of the work have expunged all passages or incidents which seemed -to them in any degree questionable. This version has been in preparation for some years. It contains only two prayers, one being the Lord's Prayer, which is set to music. The twenty-third Psalm also finds a place in it. The Sonp of Solomon is omitted en tirely ; so also are the stories of Jacob and Sarah. The Psalms have been greatly reduced, so that only terse ex tracts appear. The story of Joseph has been treated serially,each adventure being narrated in aseparate chapter.; the Poti phar episode- is left out. The revised Bible opens with the 30th and 31st verses of the twelfth chapter of the Gospel, ac cording to Mark, followed by the tenth chapter of the same Gospel. Then come the Proverbs and the Book of Job and other . selected., passages. . The-.-whole volume consists only of 200 pages set in large type. HOSPITAL SUNDAY.-The Rev. J.
