DOUBLE RAY REGATTA. Tim annual regatta at Double Bay has always been regarded as one of the leading ovenis of the aqua! ic year, and this reputa tion was certainly I'uilv unheld on Saturday allemuon. Tim wetuin.u was perfect.. The' sun slione nngliUy and lucre was ju.n, sum- cient wind Jo rend ihe yachts skimming swifily over the surlaew of ihe water, while liiere was not, enough to cause lue slighto-M inconvenience to the contestants in the various rowing races. Tho steamer New castle had been obtained as flagship and proved in every way'suitable. The spacious decks were crowded with spectators, the fair sex predominating, and ample seating accommodation, was found for all, Captain (Skinner and his officers having made every preparation. The bay where the flagship was moored formed a very animated scene, the sailing boats, with their snowy canvas, flitting from point to point, and all sizes and descriptions of rowing boats lying idly round the ship. The races generally were interest ing, though in the rowing events no close finishes were scon, the event of the day— All-Comers, in light skiffs- being won by the veteran Charlie Messenger with ridiculous ease. The sailing races, though interfered with slightly by " iluky" wind, were carried through suc cessfully. t.The race for the championship of the 24-footers attracted live starters, and the winner turned up in the new Double Bay boat the Young Harry, well sailed by A. Lees. The local boats' race afforded a very, interesting contest, and though the field of 20 spread very considerably before the finish the first half-dozen boats hung well together throughout. The coveted prize was secured by the Wild Wave, the other boats placed being Iris, Our Tom and Ghost. The pro gramme, witli the exception of the 10ft. dingy race was completed at a reasonable hour, and satisfactory arrangements existed for landing those present at the various wharves along the southern shore. Follow ing are details : — THE ROWING RACES. Tho rowing races were to some extent devoid of interest, as the finishes were, almost without exception, easy ones for the victors, and the. races themselves did not appear to create much concern outside the crews com peting. One accident occurred, but luckily no ouo was much the worse, ana so far as the clay was concerned there was not anything to regret. The accident occurred to Green, one of the competitors in the All Comers' Single Skiffs Race, and it occurred through a foul with one of the other competitors, Hanpel. The crowd of visitors was bent on enjoyment, and tho appreciation of the comic element was manifested in tho Tub Race, the last "rowing" event on the programme. One of the competitors, Harley, wore a wreath of roses, and chattered incessantly while he was at work, while the crowd on board the flagship kept up a running fire of comments and encouraging cries to liim. The end was that a good deal of his energy was expended in talk, and ho came in a very bad last. Following arc the results : — Maiden Douhle Sculls, in club skiffa (old defini tion), for all bona-ltde amateurs, members of row ing clubs. - Course : From Double Bay pier, round (.'lark Island and back to flagship.

Bettit (bow) 9, M\ Evans (cox.). j The Glebe crew got the beat of the start, but they were soon caught by the North Shore men, who took the lead, the Merean- tiles coming up and taking second place. At the turn round Clark Island the North Shore men bungled their work aud the East Sydney and Mercantile went to the front, it being hard to say which had the lead, but on the way home East Sydney drew ahead and won rather easily, Mercantile being second, North .Shore third and Glebe fourth. Sydney gave up before the end of the course was reached. Time, lOmin. 35sec. Senior Double Sculls, for all bona-fldc amateurs, members of rowing clubs, in club skill's (pld definition).

The East Sydney (Bridson and Keenan) crew got tiie lead uy about two lengths at the start, but the others wero sent away pretty fairly. The Mercantile and North Nhorc men had a determined tussle for pride of place near l'oint Piper, resulting in North Shore coming out best and challenging East Sydney for the lead. They raced pretty hard for a while, both crews negotiated the first turn at Shark Island pretty well together, but at the second turn East Sydney lost ground, and North Shore gained about half a length advantage. The latter then went away rather easily, and won as they pleased, East Sydney second and Mercantile third. Time, 20min. 45seo. All Comers, in light skiffs, single sculls, hamli- cappetl.

Messenger was the first to show in front, but he was hard pushed by Carter and Cormaik, the others tailing behind anyhow. Green cap sized near the fiagship and was picked up, thus making one competitor less in the race. Messenger maintained his lead all the way to .Shark Island, but was overhauled in rounding it. On the second turn Carter and Oonnack, who were rowing close t-ogether, fouled, and allowed Messenger to get away again with a good lead of halt-a-dozcn lengths. The other two raced all the way home, but M ere unable to catch him, and he won as lie liked. Carter and Coruiack had had enough of it, and Strcttlcs was close be hind thcin at the end of the race.

At tiie first turn round tho. islaud they got ahead ; East Sydney and tho Mercantile hugged tho shore rather closely, but did no harm, and in the turn home tho Mercantiles made the best of the running, but North Shore were the first to weather the point. The Manly crew were pulling strongly, and it seemed as if they might make up a good deal of the leeway they had suffered to accumulate on the way out, but all at once they gave in and fell out of all chance of a place. The North Shore pair were pulling a good race, when Walters broke one of his oars. He, however, kept pulling with the other, and, as was expected, broke that also. The Mercantile men came in about two lengths ahead of East Sydney, the North Shore crew made third, and Mauly did not finish. TU» Back (tubs to be subject to the approval of the committee).!

A light breeze from about east- north-cast favored the boats in tho various sailing events, ancl large sails and small crews were the order of tho day. The programme in cluded two yacht races, one for all yachts, for which no entries were received, and one for 2A-raters, which attracted only the Noma, thcovcnteonscquently falling through. A private match, however, was arranged between the Noma and the little Louelle, and resulted in a victory for the Ncrna by nearly 15miu., the little boat's new rig being apparently unsuited for light weather. The race for bay boats fell to the Wild Wave, thanks to a fortunate fiukc off Shark Island, which enabled Iter to obtain a lead from the Iris which the latter never regained, idothea secured first place in the open and half-decked event, healing Grace Darling (6min.) by only Osec. In the Limited SjqIs Race the Latona surprised everyone by boat ing the scratch boat, the Varuna, by nearly a minute, and another .surprise turned up in the Young Harry, which secured the Champion 24-footeru' Race in a comfortable manner. The old Lottie sailed very much like her old form in the jib, mainsail ancl top sail race, and led the .Susie at tin; finish by a shade under Smin., while the Isadora secured second place on her time allowance. Un fortunately the wind fell light before the 16- footeri; and the dingies finished, and they consequently took some considerable time to cover the course. Sophia, with 4min. start, secured first place in the 16-footers' race, while Violet- won tiie 14 -foolers and Mar- cello the 10-foolers' event. Tho following are the results : - All on::; and hall-decked ba.vrs <ip bourn.:; and it: Sl'.CUTTERs' l'.a\s and DaRUNG I'iRNT.-- l'lciisuiv jib and mainsail, amateur civws, Untiled, handicapped.

At the start the Lily, Our Tom, Lurlic and Clio crossed the line in the order named, the remainder being in a bunch, with the excep tion of Our Jack and Rosalind, which fouled just on tho line and were consequently late iu getting away. The Iris, with a big suit of sails on, worked through the fleet rapidly and before clearing Point Piper had gained a substantial lead, which she increased on the way to the lightship, Our Tom being next in attendance. Rounding the llagship the first time the order was Iris, Our Tom, Ghost, Wild Wave, Rosalind, Our Jack, Our May, Genesta, Lily, Clio, Spray, Lurlic, Ianthe and Viking. After rounding Fort Dcnjson the wind fell very light and "Wild Wave getting a slant which missed the others sailed into the lead.
