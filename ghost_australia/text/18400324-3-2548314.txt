DELIVERY OF LETTERS.- The inhabi tants at the north end of Sydney have of late great reasons to complain of the late- ness of the delivery of their letters. We do not in the slightest blame the postmen for this delay, as we aro nell aware that they are often delayed sometimes ten minutes even about the changing of a shilling or sixpence, and other trivial mattera. We must remark that we think it the duty of the Postmaster to make it a rule that no letter-carrier should stop more than a certain time at the house of any person to whom he has letters ; if they ate not then prepared let the post- man leave ; and if they wi-h their letters tiley can have them on application at tho Post Office. Such an arrangement would bo of great benefit to the mercantile in- habitants of Sydney, Mr. Samuel Lyons sold yesterday by private contract, 176 Shares in the Sydney Bank, £1 paid up, at 30s. premium, £440; 54 ditto, £2 paid up, at 80s. ditto, £189-Total, £629.

Not being able to understand what it meant, he went up to the spot, but could see nothing. lie then sat down again and recommenced reading when he felt something walking up his shoulder, and on tnrning round observed ¡seated there, quite afc its ease, a full grown oppossum, which most deliberately and affectionately bogan to lick his face. The animal is still in his possession and seems quite satisfied with its new quarters, but where he carno from is to him a mystery, as the neighbourhood is completely in feslcd- « ith dogs. 'r CASTIGATION.-A letter signed Casti gator appeared some time ago in the Aus- tralasian Chronicle, and has since been copied into the Monitor of friday and the Australian of Saturday last. It con- demns us in no measured terms of cow- ardice and cruelty in attacking (as they call it) the Canadian rebels by putting them on a level with murderers and thieves, &c.; We do not put them on a level with the latter; it would be an act of gross injustice to the latter to do so. A rebel or traitor, more especially the Canadian rebels, were not only murderers and robbers, but the instigators of mur- der and robbery. We am surprised our contemporaries should have expressed themselves favorable to such incendiaries. TUB-FLAG STAFF.-In no part of Syd- ney is there a more beautiful place for a public promenade than the vacant ground around the Flag Staff. Tlie Herald, tome publications ago, took notice of this subject, and we perfectly agree willi our contemporary. We really hope that Go- vernment mil indulge the inhabitants of Sydney by bestowing a little labour for the comfoit and the benefit of the inhabi- tants of the north end of Sydney. All that is tequircd is, that the place be fenced round, the ground a little levelled, and n few trees and shrubs planted. These intersee-tod with serpentine walks would make the vicinity of the Flag Staff one of the most delightful morning and even- ing walks, the view from that spot being, pei haps, one of the most beautiful of that description in the known world. . ST. PATRICK AND SHEELAH.-We were highly amused on Thursday morning by obseiving a regular sou of St. Patrick, with a ciownlcss hat and a mop in his hand (we do not mean to insinuate that he was, moppy), staggering along in the height of human contentment, when he was accoste'd by a beautiful daughter of the abovementioned Saint, about öOyeats old. "Ariah! Paddy my jewel, is it Shaiut Pathtiek's day ye've been kaping that has kept yez away fiom yer wife and dibconsilate childer ?" ' Oh, Judy dear, share an is't not a pity that such a Shaint as Shaint Pathrick was, shouldn't have a day evtry day in the year; t h roth if I had the power of making a day eveiy day for his dacent wi e Slieel.ili, tlade and throth Judy my darlint but I'd make them, an' no mistake at all at all." Fuiuous DRIVING.-We do dot know whether thete is or is not a law extant to ipgulate the driving of coaclmen in Syd- ney, or rather the driving of those gentb men who di ¡ve themselves through the town in their own ar other people's gigs, and to the list we would add that of learned and literary gentlemen who ride upon another man's horses. If there is a law to keep those persons from running over the natives we wish it was put in force as soon as possible for the benefit of the necks of the natives. We saw two swelh in a gig very nearly run over two children about three and four years old, and when the poor things ran out of the ! n ay of their horse's feet, they were saluted on their barks by the whip of one of the gentlemen, and a " d-d young brats,. can't you keep out of the nay !" PORT PHILLIP.-One of the resolutions moved at the meeting of the Australia Felix Pastoral and Agt ¡cultural Society, held on the 2nd Junuaty last, was as fol- lows:-Moved by Dr. M'Crae, seconded by James Simpson, Esq.-" That it is in the opinion of this meeting, highly desir- ous that a work should be published con tainingastatisticalaccount of the province, and shewing the advantages which this settlement offers as an "emigration field," both fur the capitalist and the labourer, and the meeting instrucjs^he Directors to lalee suchTsfeps for accomplishing this ob- ject as they may deem advisable." This is a consumation devoutly to be wished, as even those persons most interested in the prosperity of Port Phillip are igno- rant of the .statistics of ih's rising district. Mr. ICELY.-Mr. Icely, of Bathurst, we understand, returns to England on Sunday next ¡n the ship Argyle. From the indefatigable manner in which he has improved the breed of stock in this co- lony, by his importations of horses, rams, &c;, we must express our surprise that the public have not showed any token of esteem to him, in the shape of a public dinner, or something of that sort. But we hope, though it is now about the ele venth hour, that;some testimonial of the kind, will be awarded*to that gentleman prior to his return to his native land." Mr. Samuel Lyons will shortly bring to the hammer the very valuable estate of Sir Maurice o'connell, situated on the Parramatta and New Town Roads, di- vided into 50 lots, which will give an opportunity for gentlemen in Sydney to suit themselves with sites forv suburban villas, ..which, for, eligibility of situation, cannot bo surpassed in the Colony. "The particulars will be announced by adver- tisements on an early date. THE IÍATE F|pB.- Wo were highly amused" by tho remark of a-gentleman the other day, on giving our opinion that tho,. Insurance,» Offices would be great Iobsers by tho late fire. " Loosers !" snid ho, '. why, sir, they have only lost £'3,000, and I have no hesitation in say- ing that they will gain three times- that .unount by the accident, in as many month-. It's merely a hint for others to insure."
