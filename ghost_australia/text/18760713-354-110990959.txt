' ' Oh, my good godpapa 1* cried Grace, flinging her arm tenderly round his neck. 1 Ay, my. ehild, and the trouble did not end there. Insult followed ; ingratitude ; and a family feud, 'which' is not healed yet, 'and never will be — till she und her brat come on their knees to me.'-,. * . .»?? Mr. Raby had no sooner uttered these last words with . great heat,' than he was ungry with himself. ,'Ah,' said, he, .' the older a man gets, the weaker. To think of, my men; tioning that to young people.!1 And'he arrse and walked about the room in considerable agitation and vexation. ' Curse the Gabriel hounds! It is the first time I have spoken of them since that awful night j it is the last time I will ever speak of them. What are they, God, who made them, knows. Only I pray T may never hear them again, nor any friend of mine.' - . ? Next morning Jael Dence came up to the Hall, and almost the first question Grace asked her was, whether she had ever heard of the Gabriel hounds. . . . :? # . Jael looked rather puzzled. Grace des cribed them after Mr. Raby, ? Why, that will be Gabble Retchet,' said Jael, ' I wouldn't talk much about the like, if Iwas you, Miss.',' *!&? But Grace persisted, and, at last,' extracted from her that sounds had been repeatedly heard in the air 'at night, as of a pack of hounds in full cry, and that these hounds ran before Trouble. '.But,' said Jael, solemnly, 'they are not hounds at all; they, are the souls of iinbaptized children, wandering in tlie air till the day of judgment' * This description, however, probable, had the effect of making Grace disbelieve the phenomenon altogether, and she showed her incredulity by humming a little air. But Jael soon stopped that. 'Oh, Miss, pray don't do so. If you sing before break fast, you'll cry before supper.'. . At breakfast, Mr. Coventry invited Miss Cardeti to go to the top of Cairnhope Peak', ; and look over four counties. He also told her she could see Bollinghope House, bis own place, yery well from the Peak. Grape assented, and immediately 'after breakfast, begged Jael.. to be in the way to' accompany her. She divined, with feminine' quickness, that. Mr. Coventry would be very apt, if he pointed out Bollinghope House to her from the top ot a mountain, to say, ' Will you be its mistress 1''bu{£she did not wish to be hurried, or it may have bean only a mere instinct, an irrational impulse of self-defence, with whioh the judgement had nothing to do; or perhaps it was simple modesty. Any. way, she engaged Jael to be of the party. ? It was talked of again at lunohson, and then Mr. Raby put in a word. ? I have one stipu lation' to make, young people, and that is that you go up the east side, and down the same way. It is all safe walking on that side. I shall send you in my-four-wheel to the foot of the hill, and George will wait for you there at the 'Colley Dogjj public-house, and bring yon home again.' ' %? ' '. . ;,', ';'. ThiB was, of course, accepted with thanks, and the four-wheel came round at two o'clock. Jael was seated in front by the side of George, who drove; Mr. Coventry and Grace, behind. He had his . fur-oloak to keep bis companion warm on returning from the hill ; but Mr. Raby, who did nothing by halves, threw in some more wraps, aud gav* a warm one to Jael ; she was a favourite with him, as indeed were all the Donees. fe They started gaily, and rattled off at a gold pace. Before they had got many yards on the high-road; they passed a fir-plantation, belong ing to Mr. Raby, and a magpie fluttered out of this, and flew across the road' before them. Jael seized the reins, and pulled them .'so powerfully, she stopped the pony direotly. ' 6b, the foul bird !' she cried, ' turn back 1 turn back!' - ? ?? ? . 'What for? enquired Mr. Coventry. M ??' We shall meet with trouble else. ? One magpie! and right athwart us too.' ?♦:- ' 'What nonsense !' said Grace. - . . - ? '?.'Nay, nay, it is not j Squire knows hetter. Wait just one minute, till I speak to Squire.' She sprang from the carriage with one bound, and, holding up her dress with one hand,' Van into the house like a lapwing.'- ??'-?'??' '?- . '^ 'The good, kind, silly thing!' said Grace Carded. .,,.,„ '? ,.'',..? ? . .:? . .-, ... 'm ...?,?.,.,;? .Jael soon found Mr, Raby,, and told, him about. the, magpie,, and begged him to come out and order: them baok. . ?'???.?? But Mr.' Raby smiled, and. shook his head. ' That ' won't . do. . Young . ladies and gentle men of the present day don't ..believe in omens.' '?'??.. ? ?? ? ' But yon do know better, sir. I have heard father say you were going into Hills borough with him one day, and a magpie flew across, an j father persuaded you to turn baok.' ' That is true ; he was goinc in to buy some merino sheep, and I to dpposit my rents in Oarringlon's bank. Next day tho 'bank broke. ' And the merino sheep all died within the veer. But. how many thousand times does a magpte cross an, . and nothing come of it t Coxae, run away my good girl, and don't keep them waiting.' - * Jael obeyed with, a sigh. She went back to her party — they were gono. The carringe was just disappearing round ,u turn in the road. She looked at it with' amazement, and even with anger. It seemed to her it brazen aot of bad faith. - '..-,. , . . . * I wouldn't have believed it of her,' Raid eho, and .went back to' the house, mortified and grieved.: She. did not g9 to Mr. vRaby again ;fbat ho happened, to catch sight of hei about an hour ofterwards, and called to hei- — - ?JHowiis'-tbl^Jael1?- HaVo! you lot them go alone, because of a magpie ?' And he looked displeased. Nay, sii ? shegavn me - the ? slip, while' I went to speck to you for her good ; and I call it a dirty trick, Having your piesence. I told her I'd be back in a moment.' , ' Oh, it is not her doing, you may be' sure ; it is the young gentlemu'n. He saw a chance to get her alone, and of course he took it. I' am not very well pleased ;. but Ti supposo she known her own-mind. ? Ct is to be a1 marriage no doubt' ' He smoothed it over, but was Ui little put out, and stalked away without ano ther, word : he had. said enough to put.Jael's nosom iu avfiutter, and open a bright prospect to her heart ; Miss On rd en once disposed of in ..marriage, .what might she not hope 1 She had advised him loyally, had even co-operated with him as far as any poor girl, with her, feelings for him, could do; and now Mr.' Co ventry was going to propose marriage to her rlval,]and she believed Miss Garden would say 'yen,' though she could not in her heart beliove that even Miss Garden did not prefer the other. 'Ay, lnd,' suid she, 'if, 1 am to win t bee, I'll be able Aosay I won thee fair.' These sweot thoughts und hopes soon re moved her temporary anger, and nothing re mained to dash the hopeful joy, Unit warmed that largo and loyal heart this afternoon, ex cept a' gentle misgiving that, Mr, , Coventry might make Grace a woiao husband than she deserved. It wag' thus she read the magpie, from three o'clock tilFsix that afternoon. . ? To bt Ctntiimed. ?? ?-,.
