TUE PRE-DARWINITE AND POST-DARWINITE WORLDS. 'Jhe following is n full report of Mr Mon cure Conway's lecture on " Tho Pre Dar winite and Post Darwinite Worlds", which was delivered by Mr Conway at the Atl n cum hall on Monday evening last - Mr Conway slid -In the museum the old town of Halifax, in Lngland, was examining a fine collection of t crania of Egyptian mummies One cspc allv u tt ruc ted my attention from nobleness and whiteness The antiquarian who had them in charge, a worthy Roman Catholic, told me concerning that particular head a curious story He said that a gent man connected with that town had pi chased a number of mummies in Egypt wi the intention of sending them to the museum but that afterwards finding them dilhu of transportation he had their heads c off and determined to send those alot Ihcy wcie sent by ship from Cairo Wh they arrived at the museum they were plac in the hands of this antiquarian to be ma: pulatcd Whilst he was engaged in clean the mummied flesh off, he perceived a strong and pleasant odour diffused through the room He examined one of the boxes, ai perceived that it was moist He instantly opened it, and there looked up into his face the pleasant and well formed features of an Egyptian woman, who had probably died nearly 2 000 years ago I ven the ey seemed to retain some of their expressio Hie salt water, it was concluded, had i laxed the spices and gums which hud pi served this probably distinguished persona and swelled out tho face He instantly sui nioncd the other workers in the museui some of whom arm ed in time to behold til remarkable phenomenon before its speedy ct lapse It oecuircd to mo to think what nug' have been the conversation between til ancient I gj ptian lady and ray Roman Catii licfiicnd had she been able to speak 3 niitlit have askel her about the ideas ar beliefs of her time She would have to lum th it her people believed in a triad gor d Cods one of whom Osiris was born a blesse 1 mother n unod Isis , that tin believed in im evil being named Set vvl slew the Siviour Osiris that Osiris rose aga an 11 ccanie a potentate m Heaven On carl he lind been a gentle Saviour , in Heaven 1 was a leroeious judge consigning millions i torment Ii then, in turn she had asked II worthy untiquiii ian Catholic friend Ins rel gion he would have had to confess som what the same faith ILS hers, the names ben changed-a trinity of Deities an evil power not Set but Satan—an Osiris slain, risen, and from loving his enemies on earth ascending to Heaven to consign them to hell PERSISTENCE OF SUPERSTITION The persistence of a superstitious system through many ages is not a strange thing It is not due to supernatural power but to the very natural power of classes interested to preserve it The mummy itself is not preserved for religious reasons such as a future resurrection The Egyptians believed in the immortality of the soul, not of the body, or any portion of the body, and they preserved the body as a title deed to estates The mummies could always be shown in support of ownership So our mummies of superstition are preserved not for really religious reasons, but because of the vast en dowments and interests of which they are the title and seal The disbelievers in them are killed off, and there is gradually promoted survival of the most credulous In this way gradually the superstition is propagated into an instinct an artificial second nature It was thus that the vault ot the univers became thick with the speculative cobweb of ages Protestantism did not sweep them away but it gave men a larger degree of freedom Beyond the small margin of freedom from Papal authority which they secured, the chief reformers were persecutors —Luther, Knox, Calvin were cruel persecutors of opinion. Calvin burnt Servetus and the Calvinists of a late day would have burnt Calvin himself and Luther, too had their contempt for the Sabbath been displayed in Scotland or New England instead of in their own land All of which was from a force beyond their con sciousness—a force of intolerance transmitted by ages of ecclesiastical evolution Madame de Stael said she did not believe in ghosts but was afraid of them. Dogmas linger in the nerves after they die out of the brain It is not wonderful that even after men could think without being burnt, terror lingered in their nerves and arrested human develop ment thus we find the great thinkers of the 17th century still believing childish fables Even Lord Bacon believed in the potency of charms and amulets Such things are to us now mummies But most of us have mummies of our own, if we could only utilise them and it we could talk face to face with a mummy of the 17th century it might discover in us some symbol of its sarcophagus But more would be discovered outside us in our words and customs where they are kept not as part of the life but as titles to the estate of fashion position, or wealth By the Pre- Darwinite world I mean a conception of the universe which corresponds to this unconscious evolution of human nature in the past We now know that the only real enemy of superstition is science. Superstition long ago placed man in a fictitious universe —every star, planet the sea the land, populated with prêter- natural imaginary powers Science steadily leads men into a real universe Every time it explains a thing superstition dies. When the ghost in the moonshine turns out a scarecrow in the sunshine it is impossible for anyone to fear it, except so far as the crow's timidity may survive in his nerves Therefore, to every power founded in super- stition science is the Lucifer the light bringer. and it suffers the curse of the serpent supposed to have begun in Eden the work of human education The mental world with which it deals is not a world created by reason and knowledge, but one which has a real, though invisible evolution of interests and forces quite as much those of self preserv ing survival as any forms in nature But civilised government is no longer the organisation of superstition The struggle for existence has decided this thing for us Science has become essen tial to man's mastery of his planet ; fossil ideas mean presently a fossil race The free- dom of science is the salient fact ot the age in which we live It involves the creation of a new world—mental, moral, and even physical NEWTON AND DARWIN This is a purposed world—a world of conscious, intelligent human selection, and there corresponds to it that new mental and moral world which I call the Post-Darwinite world This fact is lllus trated by the enormous result already caused by the great generalisation of our time, that of Charles Darwin on the cause and method of evolution. On a marble tablet in the birth house of Newton are Pope's lines— Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night God said 'Let Newton be !' and all was light." Yet Newton, epoch-man as he was, knew better than the poet that all was not light yet. Shortly before his death that great man said :—" I know not what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordi nary, whilst the greut ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me. Other great men will arise in the future and will see more clearly than we the belt of darkness around the discovery ot Darwin, but we who are the offspring of its light can with full hearts bear witness to it Yet great men do not eclipse each other; they are brothers whatever be the century they live in, aud the epochs they create are fitted each to each in the eternal evolution of reason We can hardly appreciate in isolation the great victory science achieved through Newton We can not realise the theory which prevailed around him—that the motion of every world and star was due to a continued pushing and guidance of angels, and feel scandalised that even Kepler should have espoused that doctrine, and that Leibnitz was prevented from ac cepting Newton's law of gravitation by the theological objection that it substituted phy sical action tor direct Divine power But Newton's victory contained that of Darwin. Admission of a solar system moving by at traction of gravitation prepared the way for admission of species developed by nature, instead of by successive miracles. Nay, more than this. A comparison of the various editions of Newton's works show repeated additions in the direction of natural deve lopment. In completing his hypothesis Newton says :—"Perhaps the whole frame of nature maybe nothing but various con textures of some certain ethereal spirits or vapours condensed as it were by precipita tion. . . . . And alter condensation, wrought into various forms at first by the immediate hand of the Creator, and ever since by the power of nature." In other words Newton would admit no miracle since creation. Had his eye scanned earth as closely as the heavens his vision might have gone even farther. It is partly because the Darwinian stands upon the shoulders of the Newtonian epoch that its victory has been so easy. It has already become a thing to hush up that one or two men of scientific eminence clung to the theory of creative miracles. It is just 218 years since Newton reached his great generalisation, though his Principia appeared only in 1686. Yet op sition to it was not silenced until 1759, when the French astronomers (Cliarant and La lande) by calculating precisely the retarda tion of Halleys comet ended the cont versy. When his theory triumphed Newton had been in his grave 32 years EVOLUTION But Darwin's book on the Origin Species has been before the world little more than 23 years, and he lived to it pass from theory to verification, i himself, from being an innovator, becc an authority in every university Per- sonally Darwin was in some sense himself an evolution. He was by no means the first to propound the theory of evolution, but his grandfather was. The French have clam that distinction for Lamarck, who published in 1801 his opinion that all the change the organic and inorganic world were work of natural law, not of miracle. But that view had already been published ac years before (1794) in Erasmus Darwin's Zoononica That writer says-"When enumerate the great changes produced in species of animals before their nativity many of these enormities of shape are propagated, and continued as a varicty at least, it not as a new species of animal When we revolve in our minds the great similarity of structure winch obtains all the warm blooded animals, ns w qundrupeds, birds, and amphibious onimi as in mankind, from the mouse and bat the elephant and whale one is led to con clude that they have alike been produced from a similar living filament In some this filament in its advance to maturity has acquired hands and fingers, in others it has acquired claws or talons And all ti exactly as is daily seen in the transmutation of the tadpole, which acquires legs and lungs when he wants them, and loses tail when it is no longer of s vice to lum 1 rom their lirat ru meut or primordinary to the tcimuuiti of their lives nil animals undergo perpeti transformations, w Inch are in part produc by their own exertions in consequence their desires and aversions, of their plcosu and their pains, or of irritations or iibsoc tiona , and man) of these acquired forma propensities are transmitted to their pi tenty The three great objects ol dis which have changed the forma of ma animals uri those of lust, hunger, a security Would it be too bold to nungi that in the . rcat length of time since t earth begun to exist, peihaps millions of ac before the commencement of the histot) mankind- would it be too bold to i uguie that all warra blooded nnimals hu arisen from one living lilnment, win the great 1 ir_t Cause endued with ai mall.-,, with the power of acquiring nt parla, attended with new propcnsitit directed by irritations, sensations, vohtioi and associations , mid thus possessing t faculty of continuing to improve by its ov inherent activity, and of delivering dov those improvements by generation to its posterity world without end? As the ear and ocean were probably peopled with vet table productions long before the existence of animals, and many families of these ani mals long before other families of them slu we conjecture that one and the same kind living filaments is and has been the cause all organic life ? . . . . Cause and effect may be considered as progression, or successive motions of the parts of the great system of nature The state of things at this moment is the effect of the state of things which existed in the preceding moment, and ti cause of the state of things which slu exist in the next moment We may co siller the progressive motions of objects as chain ot causes only, whoso lirst link pr cecded from the great Creator, anti w)m have tvisted from the beginning of ti created universe and are perpetually pr cecding The germs of such a theory are l Iced found in antiquity especially in Lucretius But they were revived in an age of science first by the grandfather of Charles Darwin. With him it was a theory, a speculation of the scientific imagination His conjecture met with ridicule Carlyle told me that, in his youthful days, there was a college, debate based on Erasmus Darwin's book, whether man was descended from a cabbage or an oyster The oyster won CONTINENTAL THINKERS Lamarck probably worked out his opinion from the striking thought of his master Buffon, who said ' There is but one animal." However that may be, to ti 1 rcneli must be aivaidcd tue credit i having leeeived seriously that which wi caricatured in England In 1828 Geoffroy St Hilaire proclaimed cautiously the convic tion he had long held that there had been some kind of natural development, and th led to a great agitation in the academy 1 Germany, Oken had demonstrated that all animals are developed from vesicles and cells (1805), and Goethe, in his investigations into the morphology of plants, had reached a belief in natural development. He (Goethe) was in- tensely excited about the controversy on the subject,chiefly between Geoffroy St Hilaire mi Cuvier, in the French Academy in 1830 In that same year Paris was agitated by a revo luton. This political news having reached Weimar, where Goethe lived, produced great excitement and Soret reports a visit that day to his friend He writes -' I went around t Goethe's 'Now, exclaimed he to me, as entered, 'What do you think of this great event' The volcano has come to an erup tion, everything is in flames, and we have no longer a transaction with closed doors "Terrible affair, said I, ' but what could be expected under such outrageous circumstances, and with such a Ministry other than that the whole would end wit the expulsion of the Royal family ' My good friend, gravely returned Goethe, ' we seem not to understand each other I am not speaking of those creatures there but of something quite different I am speaking of the contest so important for science be tween Cuvier and Geoffroy St Hilaire, which has just come to an open rupture in the French Academy. In the great brain of Goethe events were not weighed by their noise or popular importance , he already saw that the question of evolution discussed by that group of scientific men held in it a revolution more important than any involving the fate of thrones Goethe's last enthusiasm in this world was for this new theory, and his pre vision has been justified rm niiAaii In lb-ll, just na that gicut German wai uttering Ina expiring cry, " More light a ship sailed out liom 1 ngliiud to carr; round the world that young bran which held the ' more light This was Charles Darwin, aged 21 who on De cembci 27 l_.il, act out on His Mu jestys alup cíetele, on a voyage that tniij now rank with that oi Cohimbtia Ile, too brought to light a new vvorltl And tins win because there had buen evolved in his heui an eye already on the look out lor tlim new wo'l 1 It vins not only that he had lnlientec a powerful mmd , not onl) that he had re eeived nt 1 dinburgh mid Cambridge a lim education, but also that he had aat reve reiitly at the feet of that grand old mar whom others ridiculed, his grandfather, une had been brought up bv his own father, an able physician to investigate ever) Bubjcet with entire independence, und trust the verdict of Ins own lucultles Ile thought lor a time that the clerical pio fcsaion was consistent with tina, and studied for holy orders at Cambridge, but he soon discovered that how ever much theology might know about another world, it knew little about this Ho gently retreated, and it was little dreamed that giving up the church wits his lirat step towards bunal in Westminster Abbey Unsalaried and unfettered, the young voyager on the Beagle went out with the question in his mmd ' Is organic evolution true? He circumnavigated the globe, he roamed through gorgeous forests, studied rivers and lakes and mountain chains, col lected birds, fishes insects plants, m large numbers communed with nature in solitudes of various/ones He strolled along Australian shores before any edifice was built of our beautiful city And when he returned the question of natures unity was answered the leading scientific men soon discovered that the young naturalist had not merely travelled over sea and land, but deep into them , and also that his mind had voyaged far into infinite time Although Ina inenel Sir Charles Lyell had liberated geologic time from its old Mosaic prison of 6,000 years, few scientihc minds had as yet realised the extent of their freedom Geologists were still compromising with that paltry 6,000 years, and stinting themselves in the matter ot time I once heard Sir Charles Lyell illustrate this by the case of a millionaire, who was reproached for the smallness of his contribution to a charitable object He re plied that in early life he had been very poor, and that though he had obtained wealth he had never got the chill of poverty out of his bones. Charles Darwin, however, had never known intellectually this limita tion His grandfather had already written of "tho millions of ages before the com mencement of the history of mankind, and the grandson was free to add as many mil lions of ages as he required WORK OF EARTHWORMS How important a factor was this freedom ap peured m that first paper " On the Formation of Vegetable Mould He there showed that the tiny earthworm with eternity to work in, waa able to triturate the crust of the earth and convert the primal rock into a soil This statement was amplified into the last great work of Darwin " Vege table Mould and Earthworms In it he reters to an objection made to his early conclusions, that considering their weakness und size, the work which worms are represented to have accomplished is stupendous. " Here," anawcrs Darwin, "we have an instance of that inability to sum up the effects of a con tinually recurrent cause which has often re- tarded the progress of science, as formerly in the case of geology, and more recently m that of the principle of evolution " " Continu atlt* recurrent cause '" How few have even yet weighed the tremendous mean ing of those words! Just here arises nee of the culture of the scientific imagination It is easy to speak of millions or myriads of years or ages, but to think of them apart from their actual effects is impossible 'The Budd hist philosopher who attempts to define til period of duration called a Kalpa by describ mg it as the time it would take to reduce a given mountain to dust by striking it ever minute with a handkerchief, is at least turning li is mind in the direction where science must look for its mighty measures For science, time "lives in deeds, not years."

These hopes and ideals have not been disappointed Darwin, in his work pub lishtd 11 years ago 'The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, bravely showed the bearing of evolution on human morality and human progression—revealing the vast range of his knowledge—which included the earthworm and the moral nature of man, which passed from the tint of a flower to the blush on a maiden's cheek , and he inspired hundreds of apostles, who have carried his method into every branch of human inquiry and interest. Huxley, Tyndall, Spencer, Hackel, Martineau, Hooker, Tylor Lub bock—one may say all the thinkers who are forming the next generation, excluding, of course, those whose opposition is professional —are the intellectual progeny of this great man engaged in extending, amplifying, inter preting, his mighty mother thought Thus also it was that Charles Darwin restored to England the intellectual sceptre of the world, which had passed from Newtons hand to that of the German Goethe EVOLUTION AND REVOLUTION Anyone who remembers the storms of de- nunciation which raged against Charles Dar win, and contrasts therewith the homage which has been paid to him after death, and especially those of us who witnessed that wonderful funeral in Westminster Abbey which assembled the great public teachers of religion and science in England, may partly realise the nature of that revolution which has brought about the post Dar winite world. More significant, however, is the fact that Conservatism has begun to entrench itself in the Darwinian theory. Even Roman Catholics have claimed authority for their church on the ground that it is an evolution. During all that work Dar win himself remained calmly at his task, reading nature anew by this new discovery, and never mixing in incidental controversies He never assumed the airs of greatness Day by day his table was covered with letters from people, some of them idle enough, about their dogs and cats. One I remember came when I was there from a man who declared gravely that his dog always knew when he was going out to take a walk, and showed this wonderful intelligence by wagging his tail All of us laughed at it, but Darwin tried to say a good word for his correspondent To him it was no small matter that people were now beginning to observe their animals, and to watch the characteristics of organised nature it showed to what depth the principle had gone amongst the common people, and that men and women look now at their dogs and cats, and at their peas and beans differently But that all this was a testimony to his own greatness was a thing that he could never be made to feel He was happy in that he was loved by all who knew him , but though the highest honours cn; upon him from all parts of the world, he was prone to credit others with over much of t immense work he had done and ho lay do' to Ina (leith with no thought that t whole world would be his monument Yet so it is It is impossible for any edu cuted human eye to see the world as it was seen before Darwin On my way from San Francisco to Sydney I studied, with the help of a scholar in such matters the religions and mythologies of the Pacific islands amid which we voyaged Those children of nature had their beliefs in a miraculous creation in a great flood in spirits angels demons, heaven and hell The missionaries had not much difficulty in getting them to call the volcano deity Jehovah their eternal crater hell an their first parents Adam and Eve That was primitive man's natural translation and crude spiritualisation of the elements and forces around him But over that same track Dar- win had voyaged and now those myths a fables about nature appear merely curious; even the missionaries smile at them not membering that they are smiling also at very similar theories and fables found in their Bible. All the books on our ship about the islands and islanders were really written by Darwin The only pre Darwinian is now the islander whose ignorance the missionary has consecrated. Charles Darwin wrote for civilisation its new book of Genesis, and after that always comes an exodus from the land of bondage Evolution means intellectual freedom It means man's power to command nature by obedience to the laws which have developed and still develope nature A vast progression of unconscious evolution has brought nature as far as man and now with man begins conscious evolution, variation purpose art and skill invention and co operation, able to advance the earth far ther in one year than blind evolution could advance it in a thousand; also love, religion, sympathy, justice able to arrest the evolution of evil, and compel the evolution of good All the human power has been liberated by man's new Genesis, already fol lowed by new prophecies and destined lead on a new Gospel of peace on earth and glad tidings to all men And as we have witnessed the beauty of this dawning age of science as we have shared its awakening morn nig breath we may recognise the harmony of the man with the great truth he brought Here is nothing to excuse nothing to sup press or apologise for DARWIN'S ALTITUDE Save only that his health was never com plcte after his long voyage in early life Charles Darwin was a man as good i he was great loving of heart ns bra' ot purpose, childlike in _mn. na matu m culture and power It would ace as ii the man who was to reveal ti laws of evolution had himself to 1 mentally and morally the sum of every creatures best and thin show the power of intellectual forcea muster pain and weakness in Ina own bod ev cn les it is their task to master such evils the body ot the world It bigotry can alio us a better man let ua behold him If supe stitution has evolved a hcait truer and te derer, let lum stand forth Nay, but oi time has 1 novvn no better man And win his splendid works continue to liberate oi mínela from dogmas elegradmg to reason li sweetness and simplicity bia public and d mestic virtues, Ins purity of life and mi invincibility of charactci ma) remind ua th evolution would be only sad tidings if it did not mean to us the development of our higher manhood The law of natural evi lution is survival of tho fittest for mere exi tence ; the law of human evolution is sur vival of the fittest for a noble and beautiful existence . Nature is indeed to be credited with having slowly produced a moral being but the condition of his controlling the brute world without is that he shall over come the like in himself The hope of Nature is now in man Through ages by self-seeking the animal has been formed ; but now by self denial the animal is able to reach a new birth The impulse to love tin which even crosses the lower nature, til power to serve the true and right, thong something in us hunger for the wrong , thes arc the last and highest forces evolved from nature They are ev oh ing the wolf and scrper out of man 1 hey are creating the new mai Nor are these new and conscious forces to be associated with the slow working of uncoi scious and unintelligent forces which build their organic foundation A thousand years of geologic time is as one day to the work of reason There has lately arisen a pessimist school which echoes the apprehensions of religious and moral men about the tendency of evolution Leopardi, for nistance says that the finer man a nature becomes the more he suffers Hte cultured man he thinks feebler and worse off than the savage So he may be if it is Fennimore Cooper's savage But as to the savage of real life some Harvard students were once measured in limb and strength with a like number of young North Ame- rican aborigines and were found to be infinitely stronger, more physically capable and healthier in every respect and I need not say what would be the result if Melbourne students were measured with Australian aborigines at their best or Auckland students with Maoris I was once travelling with Mr Herbert Spencer on the Crinnan Canal in Scotland Our boat was followfcd by a troop of bare legged children begging for pennies As they had travelled after us nearly a mile, one poor little fellow fell m the background , his leg was giving way Some one saud to Mr Spencer- There observe the survival of the fittest The children who have strong legs get all the pennies and that poor little one who is young and weak, is failing in the race But Mr Spencer replied- ' No ; there is another force now which will pre sently come into action the force of human compassion The very weakness of that child is not unlikely to prove an advantage to him Sure enough presently the pennies began to shower on the lagging child in preference to the others SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST Perhaps it is not necessary now to defend the principle of human evolution from the accu sation of being heartless or unmerciful But a later charge is that survival of tho fittest makes out medical skill and our ten derness in preserving the lives of m valida injurious to tho race We pre serve, na far as we can every taint und defect represented m invalidism Some say that when evolution fully prevails men will even kill oil their infirm and aged members m order to develope a thoroughly robust society But that is the A not even the B and C of evolution For every man who is healed is a source of experience and knowledge which largely tends to prevent disease generally The cure of an invalid cannot be spared for sanitary and scientific reasons His cure propagates far more the knowledge of the laws of health than it can injure the condition of society Again as to the sympathy which presents the sick, that sympathy, as is well known, is kept alive and diffused throughout society by the constancy of affection to sufferers and to the weak, but by these means the human community can alone secure that co-operative force which is the chief factor of social evolution The tribes that used to kill their infirm and aged mem bers killed the very cement of society, namely sympathy, they committed tribal suicide Evolution makes kindness a law of social survival It tends to make friendliness super sede force in social order Nor is it to be forgotten that the principle of selection has an immense bearing upon character Whilst it gives to every man a force of self improve ment derived from his having learned from nature, so to speak her art of war, it com pels him to turn upon himself and usl -Am I a real man ? I need not be famous but I ma) be a re ii man Am I acting from high or low motives' If impelled by pride how am I better than the peacock, if treacherous or cruel, am I not an enhancement of the serpent? If I act selfishly what am I more than any other creature prowling for its prey ? Anybody can do that Any creature can be angry, and obstinate quick to strike back Nature abounds in horns and stings If nature has only been labouring these myriads of ages to produce a biped cleverer than others in devices of self lshness and injury, we need hardly thank the man who reminds us of the fact But nature might well have laboured myriads of ages to produce a being who would rather be injured than injure another—a soul that shall love, and labour, and think, for truth and justice And the world will more and more realise that he who proved our hereditary relation to the animal has in himself íllus trated our fairest humanity, leaving his life to be A closer link Betwixt us and tho crowning race Of those that eye to eye shall look On knowledge; under whose command Is Earth and Earth's and in their hand Is Nature like an open book No longer half-akin to brute For all we thought and loved and did And hoped and suffer'd, is but seed Of what in them is flower and fruit."
