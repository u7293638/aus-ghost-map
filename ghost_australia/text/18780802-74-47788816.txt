_ '. RIVER LEVEN. I (From our own Correspondent.) Frosty weather is again in the. nacendant, havinl vanquished the wet that prevailod last week n onasiderable power. There is one lesson that.may be learnt from the severity of the season,' and that is, the same precautions must be taken to preserve perishable materials as ,are adopted in the old country and. elsewhere. Potatoes have been frost-bitten this year when supposed to be soeurely housed.' I have not met with a similar instance during 25 years of coast experience. Mr Frampton, son., met with a' disagreeiable accident a few days ago. Whilst inseeting some post and rail timber on a wet and slippery morning he managed to slide olf a log with suf fluent force to framture his left log a little be. low the knee.' Fortunately assistance was at hand to convey him home, when lie was attended by E. B. B. Valker, Esq., who soon got the limb into a comfortable position; SIr Frampton is progressing satisfactorily. Sir Bennett has completed his contract for building the noew wharf. As far as I am able to judge the work has been done in a creditable manner. The increneed shipping accommoda tion will be a great convenience, as we often have, five or six vessels in together. A rnal ghost has been seen at the Leven scillating between tile churchyard and the now elltpeL. Iutch hair has ansumed the vortalnd In consequence, and In someeeases the said hair has net recovered its normal position yet. I would just esy a word to those whom it may concern, namely, that lead in conjunction withl gun powder is a very powerful solvent indeed, of mysteries of the supernatural type, and perlhaps might demunstrnto that there are more profit able employments than personating the dead. A wink I as good, eta., etc. July 30.
