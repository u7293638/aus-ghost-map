Here a few days after his arrival he eame in contact with Bertrand, whfe, in order to get him out of the way, determined to set Kinder against him. He, however, changed his tactics, and induced Jackson to abide at his houso in Wynyardsquare. They had met in Mrs. Kinder's presence at the North Shore, and at the request of Bertrand she settled their rivalry by signifying her preference for Bertrand. Jackson and he then entered into a mutual explanation, in which each stated the peculiar relationship he had met with her. Mrs. Kinder continuing her intimacy with Bertrand, visited his house, in one instance stayed there a week. In addition to Bome other correspondence forwarded by the hands of Burne, Bertrand sent her a letter containing a diamond ring, bringing back as a answer that she would come perhaps in the afternoon, and that day she came whilst Bertrand was out. The intimacy became closer as weeks passed by; and he had now reconciled his wife to a divorce. Bertrand at length betrayed strong passion for Mrs. Kinder, and expressed his intention to marry her, adding that it was a bad thing for him that his own wife was so virtuous that it gave him no way of-getting rid of her. Jackson (to whom this was said at Bertrand's house) urged it as impossible that he could marry Mrs. Kinder, her husband being alive. Bertrand rejoined, " All things are possible, and time will show it; Kinder is rapidly killing himself with drink, and if that von't do it other things wilL" Mrs. Kinder also told Jackson that Bertrand wanted to marry her, but that it was out of the question. She said she feared him; he apperred to have a kind of mesmeric or controlling influence over hor. Having so for succeeded in his scheme with regard to Jackson'as to detach him from Kinder's and get him into his own house, according to his own admission, Bertrand drugged nim for the purpose of getting from him letters vritten to him by Mrs. Kinder. In the month of August, Bertrand, accompanied by B»rne, took a boat at midnight and went over to the North Shore, stating that he wished lo get to Kinder's drawers, but when they arrived, having pointed to Kinder's bedroom, on the windows of which the moon waj shining, he eaid the light was too Btrong, »ni -he would have to coine again some other night. About three days afterwards they went again at night, Bertrand, whilst I they were crossing the water, telling Burne that very likely nest morning Kinder would to found dead in his bed, having committed suicide, and letters from Jackson bo found in his hand. They arrived about (Continued on 4lh Pa ^ Fajf g), . one o'clock-Ber^iinH. toofe off-bis boots ; and went into thehonse. "When be rejoined-fiunie-(who,whilBt he was away, had ' fallen 4«lfeep) iie sajdKinder's beer which had becn drugged was Untouched, and tha| he wis' xetf restless in his , qleiep. "Within wren or eight days they madjp another midnight tnp to the iJorfch" J4idre. » Bertrand | this time took a hatehet and told Burne that he. intended to knock-outthe brainrfof Sander who had insulte4 him.at the theatre, pnthis excursion ho also informed Burne <&.liia to ijdirorra. from] his wife and to marry Mrs. Kinder. In answer to a remark by Burne that it would be imjossible to get a divorce from his wife tin- he could get something against her. {eas Bertrand said he would get some one (and pay them until he got something against for. They peached Kinder'* an hour after midnight, and Bertrand, taking off his shoes, again entered the house through the same window. As, they were returning to the city he told his companion that Llewellyn (Mrs. Sander's brother)..and "Jackson were again in the housO, and he,did not think it safe, especially as the boards creaked. A week more elapsed, when. Bertrand made preparations for-another nocturnal expedition to Bander's house. He induced Burne to buy him a dark red Crimean shirt, because, As he said, it would not show , the colour of blood, and desired him to " make him up" so that he could not be recognised. Before they started he shaved himself, put on a shell hat, the red Crimean shirt, and wore a mask that half concealed his face. Taking off their boots before quitting the house in Wvnyard-square; they passed out by the back door, put on their boots in a lane at the rear r and crossed the water at about half-past one o'clock. Having reached the-North Shore Bertrand got in- Side Kinder's bouse, and remained "there about three-quarters of an-hour, after which he came back to the wharf and . told Burne that he did not like to go home without finishing what he had come to do, and requested Burne to accompany him to the house, go in with him, ana, if anything happened, to take IpB part and know out the Wains of anyone who interfered. Burne declined to run the risk, stating.that it-was too romantic for him; and Bertrand, having proceeded to the house alone, returned in about half an hour, said he had not " done it," and they pulled the hoat bade to the city. Burne, although taking the precaution to. carry the hatchet .and keep Bertrand in front of him in the boat, regarded these excursions as a farce, knowing Bertrand to be very eccentric in his manner, fdndof indulging in strange caprices, and telling extraordinary «tories. He frequently boasted-of his success with women, spoke of romantic adventures in Brussels, of fighting a duel in Paris, and said that he was on the Btageat Sadler's Welle, where he had an amour with the chief actress. He once took poison, and was very ill, and one day feeized Mrs. Kinder, calling her by the name of his wife (Jane), and tried to force hfcrop thte bcd, 0»d Burtie, jvho interfered, he then attacked, tried to.break, his arm against the tad-post, and knocked hiB head against the wall. On another occasion he attempted to eplit his wife's head open" with a Ow- evening, two or thret weeks subspqueriv*; to the l»" f trip, Bertrand, jittired ii.^ fcpparel, accoppanfed Burne to* purchase pistols, Bertrand providing the money for two. He cast some bullets; and the next day ft sheep's head.was procured* at Which he practised pistol'finng in hia workroom, with the object, aa he said, of ascertaining which part of the "scull a bullet would . most easily enter: Mrs... Palmer" (the mother of Mrs. Bertrand) hearing what appeared to be the reports, of .pistol. shots,came dpwii stairs with-<her - daughter, and looking nnto the workroom—the 4oM\4if which was opened to her daughters knock-^r-she-saw touch smoke,^nd-obsmedtheeheep's head on a eid&table;: Heprdered her away, and she left the/housei" Burne >wasaware that Bertrand was well acquainted with the anatomy of the head as jiofc.io know which partofjAcrfquJl, a jbullet-would soonest enfisr.

' Kinder, who hadbeenJn' leaTe of 'absence on .account of ill health since the 23rd, was getting much "better. He was at Sydney on'the 2nd October, ajjd returned in the middie of the £ay, write sober.' On the mocoing of that day Sirs, Bertrand Wpnt ow^to Kinder's taking the baby and nursegill.- In the afternoon, earlier than UBiial (at half-past 6), the nureegirl was sent back home With/the baby. la the Evening Bertrand' was at Kinder's, and thor went to a neighbouring pubUc-houeo {Dind'e), but i«ft -after ^>eing there about ten minutes, having liadobly one glass of ale each.' Immediatelybefbre tlieywent their, Kinder was seeaPingood.spirits playiugwith hiB children In' frtfAtof. the, house..; When they returned to the "house, Bertrandtalked up and.^own,thg ^oom Very -fast, kept his glovMon,|a&jip;^d one haadUn his pocket. He anti Km5er began to' talk 'about KinderV^butfiness affairs, speaking of New Zealand andreading letters, whilst Mrs. Kinder, and ^Stya. , Bertrand was .standing at th»-*ifld<iirf Wronging-flowers in a 'bonnet, therewae % loud- report.' Kinder was thensittinginachair .near the;piano; a pistol dtopj>6dfi$m his hand/ and in his mouth Bertrand placed a pipe. That night, abontfcll o'clock, Dr. Eichlfer' (folr whom a message had been left some hows previo^JVV^lled to see Kinder, .whom he found lyiriglojia sofa in ,a.Jialf- conscious state with a tomv wound reaching -from the maxillary, angle up to the right eiJe of the head in,tiie ; diNeiaon of .the. temple, about foiw inchesin lengA, evideptly,.. caused by a pistol ahot. There was no appearance of the wtrande or jBxit of a bulIefc - The local arteries and nerves were tpmf«nd the zygoma was loose!' "When the' flerious naturt 1 if >thei wound was Explained • and Kiadef was advised to settle his worldly affairs, and prepare to apw»r before Creator, he sank back in a fciftd of stujkw. As 'Dr. Eichler, after dressing and cleaning the wound, was returning to the city, Bertrand, whom he met at Kinder's ;house, accompanied him,>and informed, him. that Kinder, who . had been drinking, ap-J peared to be in money difficultiesj.-that the sight of some letters had much depress-,: ed him, and that he ,was jealous of Jackson, jto whom ho (Bertrand) had given pioney .to get him out: of the way. Next morning, at his own house, Bertrand told Burne the, news of Kind* shooting hiniself, and stating the particulars, said he. had gone out with him to. hifivo a drink, and thai before getting back to the hotfse had shown him a pistol, telling him that it was perfectly empty, although actually it waB loaded.' He placed a cap upon the nipple,, and told Kinder to go into the room and frighten, the ladies by pretending to shoot himself. He went in, continued Bertrand, and did so, and of course shot himself. None of the doctors, he added, thought the wound waa inflicted by a bullet as none could be found. On the Monday evening Bertrand told Kinder's servant not to fetch Dr. War4 as he would report ; it through the. North Shore, and so Kinder would lose his situation; Kinder told this girl that he had struck himself a severe blow with a stick, ;but she thought she heard him say, when Mrs. Kinder was present, that he :' did not do it. She Baw Bertrand trying to stanch the blood, and he said he would go for Dr. Wright. On Tuesday morning he was Visited by Dr. Wright, who was sent , for and told that.Kinder had shot himself. He saw the wound, the direction of which he described as upwards and slightly backwards; On the 4th, Mr. W. F. Dind. a neighbour, went to Kinder's to ascertain whether it was a fact that he had shot him- ;self. Outside the house he met Bertrand, who informed him that it was true, and repeated the circumstance as to hiB pecuniary embarrassment. Whilst they were talking, Kinder in a low tone called " Bertrand," upon which Bertrand said-the doctors would not allow anyone to see him. The Bame evening senior-constable Emerton generally called " sergeant " in this district, having that, day ..first heard of Kinder iBhooting himself, went to the house, where he saw ^Bertrand. He found Kinder in bed cosily smoking a pipe, and asked if he knew hitp. Kinder said " Are you the sergant ? " and Emerton replying in the affirmative, Kinder added " What lies these people here are saying about me shooting myself, as I did not do it." He then commenced to pnll the bandage - off his face, and Emerton, Whilst ksBistiiig ' Bertrand to replace it, asked who did it, but Kinder made no reply. On leaving the room Bertrand said Kinder always accused his wife of doing it, and that Mrs. Kinder.had the pistol, but too ill in bed. to be disturbed. As they were, parting Bertrand remarked " I suppose you won't my anything about this till we see how it gets on." Emerton replied " Certainly I shall—I shall report it to-morrow." On the 5th Dr. Eichler again saw Kinder, found him considerably better, and perceived no indication of sudden danger to his life. He conversed with the doctor in German, and when asked how the wound haruttoed^r don't know," or "I donVrecoiiect," Th~;e same day Bertrand whilst in his workshop ' took Oom his pocket a phial 'Containing a whlite liquid which he fittid—(speaking to Bi&rne;) — was poison that he intended to give to!,' Sander, stating, at the same time, that he v vhad frequently before given him poison, butt\it had never taken effect. He asserted V-that Kinder stuck out to the last that he dfci uot^fiboc* himself, and said he must not le'aVeliim too long for anybody else to speak to. In the evening Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand were at the house'' of ~ an acquaintance, named Mrs Robertson, when Bertrand said he would go next day and say that he shot Kinder. Kinder died in the evening of the 6th, Friday, in the course of which day Bertrand and Mrs. Kinder weye seen laughing together in a cab that was proceeding towards the Haymarket. On the 7th a coroner's inquest was held on the remains, at which Bertrand, who was examined as a witness, said-he saw Kuidejr place tb'e pistol to the, sid? of hitf head; thpt afW jthe {report pistol fell from his hand, 'but the pipe he nad been jBmoking remained in his mouth.

' On the hearing of the case at the Court of Quarter^ Sessiona, Mrs. Kinder, who was a witness, swore that her husband had had no ground for jealou<y of Bertrand, iMrs. Harriet Kerr, Bertrand'^ sister, who; on her arrival fcom^Melljpurne altoui; v the 20 th October, went to reside at his -house, immediatelyafterheardfrOm him of his attachment to, and interittonJtp marnr, Mrs. Kinder, and soon discovered the .nhkindness with which he treated his, wife- - Bejtrand', whilst Mrs. Kinder was at her house, told Mrs. Kerr, in her presence, that Kinder was sitting nea£3fe -^iaAd whilst! the^ two' ladies wore at the window when he shot himself with-one of a pair of pistols he (Bertrand) had bought in order that Kinder might fight a dtte} with Jackson. i On rf* about the 21st of October Mrs.' Kinder left Sydn^ToCTatHuret, whence sbe kept up a correspondence with- Bertrand, marked ! ;by occasional expressions ofardent regard for him, and denoting a reliance upon hie future services to make provision for getting her employment. Before they parted he undertook to keep for her subsequent perusal s diary, the nature of which will be shown by the following extracts:— = : ' T " October 28th.—She is gone—I am alone; oh, my Ood did I ever think dream of such agony I feel as if every kindly feeling had gone with her—I do so hate all mankind. .

Do not rouse the demon that I know lies dormant within me. Beware how you trifle with my love. I am terrible in my vengeance, for I call on the powers of bell to aid their master in his dire vengeance. Do not fear me, love; I would not harm thee—not thy dear self, but ohly sweep away as with a scimitar my enemies, or those who step between thy love and me. Think kindly of me, of my great failings.

I trust I may succeed. Oh, is it not hard that through me my sweet Ellen is thus placed. * * *. Adieu my Ellen, dream my love that we are locked in each . others arms once more. * * * (5th). Slept as usual, late. Jane is very good, and tries to make me as happy and comfortable as she can. * * * We took Harriet, it being her firist trip to Manly Beach; to the Fairy Bower we went. # * * I met on board the steamer Mr. Bellhouse, an old acquaintance of mine before marriage. I asked him to come to tea to-morrow, and spend the evening with us. * * * (8th). Thank God another day gone. What a weary time. How ever will twelve month past ? God only knowB. My heart grows sick and faint when I look into the future. Oh, God, is thiB thy retribution for our sins. Did I flatter myself that the Almighty would let me—a wretch like me—go unpunished; but I tell thee fate I defy thee. What do I care for aught only that I am with my Ellen. Oh, sweet angel, why art thou not near to soothe my anguish ? I do feel as if my heart was rent in pieces. Crushed; and then dark thoughts obtrude themselves before me, fiends rise and mock me; they point to a gate, a portal, through which I # feel half inclined to go, but not yet. * No matter what thou hast been my child, I hold thee up as a true virtuous wife to me. * * * (10th). While dressing, Mr. Wood (father of Mrs. Kinder) came; he walked down with me to the North Shore ferry. I felt very strange. I went orcr in the Kirribilli. It brought a crown of ideas, that I thought were buried for ever, back to my memory. This is the first time I have been to the North Shore since poor Harry's funeral. I am standing on tae deck, my face turned towards the little bouse with the two chimneys, as I used to do when on wings of love I flew to the armB of my beloved. Oh, my heart sinks within me when I recall our happy meetings aloue, and none by to interrupt us. Those were happy moments, but indeed alloyed with bitter thoughts, now horribly jealous I was. I was mad. How could I bear to know that my Ellen, my own dear love, belonged to someone who had the legal right to do or say anything he liked with her. It drove me raving mad, and I am what I am. I looked around me, and saw people coming and going as Uit*j ubc<1 to doand, racfcea by these thoughts, surely there can no # worse hell than our own conscience. * Mr. Defries, when I went out with him, spoke to me about our affair. He said he knew more about us than we imagined— that ^ he had watched us jW^-g that he^jiQLghi it his taty to speak to me on the subject. What^x 'magine is this that either Mrs. Bobertson orVse have hinted something to him of what they*Kr»nv-. I, thought it best to hear what he had to say, so that I might be on my guard. He knows the truth of my love for dear Ellen, and also that she loves me; he also knows that I intend getting a divorce. He begged of me, almost on his knees, to try ana love my wife. He said that Ellen only cared for me for what use sho could put me to, and that she had said bo openly—thathe ^ ^ tell me things that would astound me ~sufficient to make me give up Ellen altonever see her_again. 1 listened attentively to all he had to say, and when e had finished he said he felt for me as if he was my brother—exhorted me, if I cared forjny happinm^in^is-^fOFW; and ffiy ^rarnaT welfare in the next, not? to be tempted by the Devil. * * (12th). Took a waterman's boat over to North Shore, and made for Defrie's house on foot, going through the. bush the road I went through on one occasion with my darling Ellen. * * I once more fancied she, the loved darling - of my heart, was by my side. ...... Oh, God, what I suffer. This love is terrible, it will kill me. What excruciating agony intense bitterness of the past, all that I possess of brain, nerve and soul is devoted to this one object of my life. When shall: the end arrive ?. If need be I will sell my soul to Satan for thco, oh my dear one. What is the fnture to me, or my salvation. I do not want it unless my Ellen share it with me. ...... I glory in ruining both body, and soul for the idol I worship and adore Dear, sweet Ellen,., the more they oppose us, the more will be my power of resistance. Poor fools, to try and thwart my will. I tell thee thou hast need of God's help indeed, if thou hast me for an enemy—I' Who value human life as l value weapons to be used when required and then thrown away or destroyed, soihe, of course, being kept for future use, if necessary." After sho left Bertrand also kept up a correspondence with Mrs, Kinder, but only^one of his letters to her waB found and that Written with a view to its being seen bv her mother contained nothing of interest. Early one morfiing about the end of October Bertrand went into his sister's bedroom and whilst sho was - dressing the baby asked her to Bit on the side of the bed, as-he had something to say to her aud then he told her that he shot, Kinder, - - She . expressed her discredit of the Btatement and when he-repeated emphatically, she hid her face and wept. "Don't cry," he said, "I don't regret what I have done, I would do the same to any -man who stood in my way." He admitted that after shooting 1 ^him, he put a pistol in his hand and a pipe in his mouth, and threw the pistol with which he WaS shot into the harbour.. They bad platted it well, he added. attd^f ever it cam« before, the public, it would ridt be believi"- He cautioned her not to let his wife know he bed told her this and'in his presence the wife never said anything abouti-it. In the first week of November he invited to: his house , a. former . acquaintance named Bellhou&e;,; and when he came next. day told him he <was sorry for Kinder, - hut that he wanted him out of the way; He also told him that he was going to get a divbrcp from his wife and being a powerful mesmerist he had great influence over he* 1 . One evening Mrs. Bertrand. drank some brandy and water given to her by her husband; came out of the room, and with Mrs Kerr retired to tho bedchamber- they both usually occupied. . When she entered the room she sank info a chair quite exhausted, and to the astonishment of her companion, immediately fell fast asleep. Mrs Bobertson, with whom the Bprtrands were on visiting terms was also told by Bertrand that ho shot Kinder and on the evening of the 15th November, he, with his wife and Mrs. Kerr, were at Mrs. Eobertson's house, .where they remained all night. After Mrs. Kerr had retired, and Mr. and Mrs. Bertrand had partaken of supper, he took a «mall card from his portemonnaie, threw it on the table, and ordered his wife to take it up. She hesitated and turned pale, but he insisted upon her taking it, and afterwards said it was the card that Kinder had in his hand when he was shot.: That evening, as they went into the drawing-room, he was excited, calling for Ellen, for jJmie, and for Alfred (his assistant)." He cried out, "Bring the milk and mix; the pobon. I say, Ellen, you give it to him. I say you are to give it to him. Don't wring your hands; he feels nothing now." In the dining-room of Bertrand's house, one evening, whilst Mrs. Bertrand was lying on a sofa in a state more like stupor than natural sleep, again reverting to his proposed union with Mrs, Kinder, he said to Sirs. Kerr, " I don't want to kill Jane; but, if I cannot get a divorce, I shall get up an adultery case with seme respectable married woman," and then Jane can sue me for a divorce." That Mrs. Kinder was a bad woman ho said he knew;: but it was because she was wicked that he inust marry her; he would make her a female poisoner —she. was a second Lucretia. Pausing a little, and leaning over his sister, he hissed through his teeth, " Kinder did not die by the shot—we poisoned him. She (pointing to his wife, who still lay on the sofa) mixed the poison." He said it would never be detected. Frequently he talked pbout seeing the ghost of Kinder, and when he saw jam on the table he made some allusion to blood. It was not unlikely he also said that before Mrs. Kinder went to Brisbane (as she was then about to do) she would see hiB wife's funeral. Whilst: at the house of Mr. Defries, North Shore, oneevtning, he acted in a most extraordinary manner, threatened to raise the ghost of Kinder, pretended to be the devil, and pub on hideous grimaces, and made horrible noises. When he got back home that night he went out with Mrs. Bobertson's leghorn hat on to get a lobster. He professed to have great mesmeric power, and said Mrs Kinder was the best medium he ever knew. Another strange statement he made was that a dead man was in the house, and that was the reason there were so many flies about. Often he threatened to murder his wife, and to say that Mrs. Kerr did Since Kindw'sj^tu^s,.- ,ij 0 wc6on was a frequent visitor at Bertrand' C house and he at her's. On several occasion when, late in the evenings, he accompanied Mrs. Bobertson to her house, he allu ded to shooting,Kinder, and abo told her iWt it had been Mrs. that Kinder should be shot S S a S n w a s ^ ^ might be blamed for it. She at lengtu came terrified by his recitals of the circumstances, and disliked to hear them. Having voluntarily made be cognisant of the crime, he admitted he then threatened to kill her. On thiB ground, and being afraid of him, Bbe sought the protection of the authorities, who, in default of his finding sureties to keep. the pe^ce, committed him to fourteen days' imprisonment, which sentence ue was serving when thte charge r€ murder waB brought against him. The body was exhumed at the beginning of December (two 60 months after death), and examined br Dr. Eichler, Dr. Alloway, and Dr. Alleyne. Besides the injuries discovered by Dr. Eichler before the inquest, it was found that the ascending portion of the loner jawbone, was ^broken. Dr.- AUoway was of opinion that this must have been produced by a bullet, or by some.other.hard substance." The direction of the wound too he held to be from behind forward and -from below upward, thus agairt diffenng from Dr. Eichler, who asserted the .direction to be from the maxillanr anjgle up towards the" temple. Again,; Dr. Eichler was of opinion that gunpowder and wadding, , or paper ^red from a pistol clos6 to the face, wonldhia sufficient to cause the wound,'whilst Dr. AUoway held that the maxillary bond could not have bpen so much injured without the use of a.rallei or tome hard substance. Dr. Alleyne,, though'lew deddrd in this view. Bubstantiallyagreed with Dr. AUowayinhisconclusion. that- Kinder inSlicteil the wound upoh himself,' but W joiifed in the contusions of Dr. Alloway and Dr. Alleytte as to admi|T the possibility pf the shot being fired by some one else, and also as to the possible use of a bullet Dr. Allosray, howeven maintained th^tthe poaition must luwe b^n a most extraordinary one if Kinder inf»cte4 the wound himself. That' the wou»u was one that might or plight; not cau^ and that the patient's cpuditiori^U th^ /oth October (ob stat{4 in . evident'®) indicated a probable recovery, was concurred in by all "three of these profe^P 1^ gentlemen. Dr. Eichler. could ni^Mgn a»y visible cause or matter'-of which he c(Ml4 attribute death on>»e.6th, and Dr. AUoway would not have.^P^W death on that day after the- fafurable change . said to haye been exhib^ day before. Mr. Watt, the ^M'/tjc^ ,chemis^, who carefully exa^ inine^^10 contents. af.-thb : ..

Mr. ^aUey^ite^^Fjufy^r tL c " defence,' pomting out tn Imme the mor. than ordinary uece«ity>inil»e present ca^ for the jury to 'diveBt their minos of all pre judices, hqwever.lqathflPW3 or fojil might b> the impr^s^ions from : -circumstances atrocious apd revolting as those elicted evidence, an31 to give' a solemn, calm, religious consideration to what had bt ^i; brought before them.; There was t:. .- peculiarity inthe case, that ^prisoner tried pn his.own admission. The theory ft the prosecution was that prisoner, havi , - been insanely impassioned of Kinder's 1v ..c?' determined 'to possess her, even at the of. the husband's life; but seeing that w. t,. out this sacrifice he had possessed the man, the basis of the theory was utt- K y struck away. Proceeding to analyse evidence, he referred to the extraordii but unreliable and uncoroborated teetiin , of Burne. If prisoner desired the deatruc 1 of Kinder it was highly improbable i with his knowledge of subtle and de- : poisons, he weuld pave gone through (n, filthy, vile melodramatic process of ac< »!i plisfiing the murder. - This witness r if haye had his facts from the wretc e [ melodrama he was in the habit of perfo; n ing, not from actual life. If it be t> \ ; prisoner must have in his life carried On a. extravagant career, only in keep' ; with the most scrofulous of French novel But when he heard all this gascouadm * about prisoner's amours and adventures, V himself treated it as mere trash, unworth of credence. # It was not contended tnr prisoner was insane; if he perpetrated th crime he had no such insanity as woul exonerate him from the operation of th law, but sufficiently insane to relieve hit from any significance being attached to lh extravagant statements he so frequent! made. The sister's testimony showed -tiia' he was capable of lving assumptions 0 power supernatural and physical, that on)- the maniac would pretend to exercise After some remarks on the general charm* torofself- accueingevidence, thelearned court sel urged that as so many men of position am previous reputation had invoked the tribu nals by the publication of pretended crimes some consideration might be reasonably allowed the miserable utterances of a wretel' proved to be aliar—a man to whose declarations of his own criminality a witness, \vh< had known him for years, attached no' the least importance. Without attempting to damage the credibility of JachsouS evidence, he pointed out that the aclicd taken by Bertrand on the reccipt of the letter he sent was anything but that of a man conscious of guilt; he might, if a murderer, have quietly taken the apology offered, bui he choose by prosecution to go into the midst ofthe police and accept the investigation of a court of law. In the mndly wild gesticulations assumed by the prisoner to terrify a woman, there might have been thin idea—I am not fascinating, nor fich, nor famous, but I will undermine their chastity with ingenuity and power by terrifying them into acquiescence, by convincing them that I am a devil in infamy ana agency. He was not a murderer; murderers were made of sterner stuff. They did not bahble of their crimes; the characteristic of such criminals were secrecy and stealth, not blab bingrof the blood they had shed. If the jury belie ved the tales he told of the murder, how would they determine the mode in which it was accomplished ? He stated that Kinder shot himself, next that he put the pistol treacherously in Kinder's f«iA +W-I10 himself lmL Kinder, and t>gain tft poisoned him. The diaiy yrould sh '^che extraordinary nature of tb«s man's how utterly worthless we-© his doclarji mo —anff how all truth-SMa^nn^fgSne from . 1 iiuS^3wSWHf^ttu"iiTesistable argumeni in the absence of Mrs Kinder's testimony in 1. this investigation. That diary was written u for her eyes alone; in that he poured out his nature; it was a Revelation of his soul. He w%uld abandon His wife, did not care for hi {children, this adulteress being all that M But it was impossible t.wflre was a bond of love between them, for if the theory ofthe prosecution be true, tin -bond was one of fear of impending justice The case might be stripped of any consider ation with regard to the pistols purchaec j by Burne. The. pistol by which the i<: juries were inflicted waB undoubtedly thai produced at the inquest, and which it wat> admitted was that prisoner gave to Kinder Another point, if looked at calmly and dispassionately, would justify any jury ; ii pronouncing a verdict of not guilty.
