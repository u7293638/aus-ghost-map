(Concluded.) Bill was a true prophet. The hollow was heavy with gold. We did not find a regular gutter of it, though Bill said if we sank deep we should be sure to come upon one; but within a few feet of the surface, and sometimes almost on the surface, we lighted upon rich pockets of gold. Talk of jewellers' shops! This dirty hollow took the shine out of all of them. And as day after day went away, and our bags of gold got heavier and heavier, we laid plans for the future. We were to go home and buy a farm; Liz was to be educated, and grow into a beautiful young woman and get married, and we were all to live together and take care of the children— how the llttle one laughed when we came to this part of the story, for we spoke freely before her. lt was all settled, and certain to come true. Those five weeks that we lived together were the happiest of my life. Liz was like a star, in our tent, and made everything bright and beautiful, We all worshipped her—Bill, me, and Rhadamanthus— and lived in her, so to speak. The tricks she played, the stories she had to tell, the discoveries she made, gladdened the days, and drew our hearts closer and closer to her. One day she saw a rock exactly the-shape of a goat's face and beard, and we had to go with her and christen it "GlO'qnt'a,-.Kock '.; ; aiiotHof.-d'ay'. she? picked."^ 8hlí_dóclnTetl'was^¿ .charm.to:.ko'ep",ovéry* .'. thing bad away -, rahothor dnysliu .fonnd ai now.1 kind l.ofi wildfldwor, -. which!-.'sha prattled over in the quaintest and prottiost. fashion ; .uiiother.day^.Bhp .discovered .that) "Rhádamuuthús . was" a.Vfairywho,? had changed himself, into a.dog, to.toko care o£ . her.ïho fuitliful-'.raggod.beast 1: , She ^- announced. -tho amazing .discovery to .liim ^!

'My next impulse was to bring Rhad'a body home. " ' I did so, and placed. it at the foot of ' the bed, on tho ground. Tile hours; went by, and Bill did nofc ap pear.
