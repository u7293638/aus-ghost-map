FRANCE. A REMARKABLE FIND. Among the many Interesting articles which are treasured up In the Cluny Museum, there is said to be a brass plate with an engraved Inscription whioh once was fastened to tbe ooffin of Louis XIY., and afterwards, fn 1793, was torn off, when the people entered the family vault of the Bourbon Kings, broke the coffins, threw the bodies out, and carried away everything that they could find of metal ornaments, jewellery, etc. The plate shows the united crest of France and Navarre, surrounded by the chain of St. Louis and the ribbon of the Order of the Holy Ghost, supported by two angels as crest-bearers, with the inscription:—' 'Here rests the noble and mighty Prlnoe, King Louis XIY., King of France and Navarre, etoEequiescat in 'pace." In the lower part there are three holes at equal distances, about whioh there exists a curious story. M. du Souimerard, the founder of the Cluny Museum, was one day in a common public-hbuse at St! Denis, where on the wall he noticed a brass frying-pan of a some what uncommon shape.. He took ft down 1 to examine ti more particularly, and discovered sopie engraved letters under a thick crust of coal and soot. Without Baying anything about his disoovery, he bought the pan from the astonished owner, and after a process of cleaning it appeared that it was the plate from the coffin of Louis XIY. The three legs were taken out, and the -original shape restored, but the holes into winch the legs had been" fastened Temain until this day.—Pall Midi Gazette.
