' - THE LIFE TELLS. I remember ? one prayer meeting in a churoh of my husband's, when he, not being able to go, asked me if I would go in and lead the meeting. It was a rainy night, I remember. I looked over the room and I saw that all were members of the church. I said I would read an appropri ate hymn, and while singing I would ask them tocome forward and fill the altar, and 1 read slowly and solemnly, 'Come ye sinners, poor and needy, Weak and wounded, sick and sore ; Jesus ready stands to save you, Full of pity, love, and power : ... He is able, He is willing : doubt no more.' And they came forward, and I joined them, and something happened that night. God only knows how many who stand inside the altar and sing this hymn for sinners need to be regenerated themselves. Some things are getting tremendously seriouB with me. I notice in some places not many sinners come forward when asked. And yet every man and woman who is filled with the Holy Ghost will win souls. I heard a man say hot a long time ago that 'if the pulpit were on fire, people would come to see the fire.' But I liked even better another thing that h6 said, that 'every life could be a pulpit from which Jesus Christ could preach.' Only the life tells these days. My heart is sick to see people — good, kind, tender-hearted people that everybody loves — making no profession of religion, saying, as they often say, 'I would not do what that person does, or leave undone what they leave undone, and yet they pro fess to be Christians. I would rather not ! make any profession. I will try to act | right. | And then some day they die, and as one j- said to me of one who was near and dear to him, 'Has he gone to heaven ? O, if he had only confessed Christ. ' And he ought I ? to have done it. It is not right to leave dear ones wondering where you have gone. — Mrs. Bottome.
