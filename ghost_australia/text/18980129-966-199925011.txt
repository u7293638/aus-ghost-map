SHOULD A MAN PROPOSE BEFORE HE HAS PROSPECTS? A man is often in serious perplexity about a proposal. He loves a girl, aud lie longs to tell her so, and secure her for his own; and he knows quite well lis is not iu apposition to face papa upon a question o: settlements, and so lie halts between two opinions, tormented with doubt. If he has absolutely no prospects whatever, there certainly seems little good in proposing marriage. It would be better to keep silence altogether, were it not for a way men have of being unable to help showing thenlove for a girl, and haunting her society, even when thoy are aware their prospects are hopeless. To show a girl you love her, and to haunt her footsteps, is mostly to make her cares for you iu return ; at all events, there is the danger of doing so. That being the case, a man is bound in honour to speak. He cannot win a girl's love by showing her his, aud then ride away and say nothing more. He must tell her how matters stand. If he has the ghost of a prospect. he must ask her whether she thinks it sufficient to wait for: but he should make it plain that he cannot consider himself ill used if she thinks the waiting coo long and too indefinite. it there is no prospect at all, he cannot ask for any promise. But he can tell her how happy it wouid have made him to have her for his wife had fate beau kinder. That will at least prevent her eating her heirt out m the mortification of fancying sha bad given her love to inin ivitiioiiL being asked for itâ€”a mortification greater to a woiinin tl:;in a man can have the least idea of. Without definite prospects, no man lias any right to bind a girl by au engagement. b w l a 0
