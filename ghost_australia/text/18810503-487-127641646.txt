COOTAMUNDRA NEWS. {From the Herald. J While excavating the tank for the new brewery iii Cootamundra the other day a live frog was discovered embedded in the earth seventeen feet deep. There was a little moisture in the earth, by which life was apparently sustained. The information given in our issue of a fort night since showing that the Eureka reef and neighbourhood, within tho Muttama goldfield, was a good field for enterprize, has, wo are glad to say, attracted the attention of capitalists in Sydney, who are making further inquiries. On tho production of Professor Bice's ghost in Cootamundra on Tuesday night last, a young lady in the audience went into hysterics. She was some considerable time recovering from the severe fright. The ghost in return was frightened by the young lady's screeching. There's one oomfort, at any rate, in Coota mundra being kept in subordination to Gunda gai — that the latter get few visits from Mr. Sheep- Inspector. At least so say the 'loafing' drovers of this side. The persecuted landholders are persons whom nobody owns ; and it doesn't matter that these are imposed upon — eh, Mr. Sheep'seye. Its nothing to see thousands of sheep 'loafing' on the very township of Coota mundra. Side by side with theatrical announcements at Ward's Theatre at Temora is the following — 'Gospel Entertainments at Ward's .. Theatre every night by the Scotch Evangelist. All weloome. No collections. Sankey's songs to be sung.' It has been found necessary to appoint two additional Distriot Court sittings for Coota mundra during 1881, and the speoial dates are 6th June and 24 th November. This will make four sittings for the year, but is not to form a precedent for future time. The following soleotions were taken up at Cootamundra on Thursday last. 0\. M.
