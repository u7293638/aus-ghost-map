THE FEBRUARY EXHIBITION. On Thursday, February 27, was witnessed the largest Show we have ever had in South Aus tralia, and the Exhibition gave some idea of what might be expected to be seen should it be decided to hold a large General or Intercolonial Exhibition. As we have already said, the great drawback to the Societies here is want of room. The Hall for the present Exhibition was crowded to an unconscionable degree. Visitors were unable to obtain little beyond a bare glimpse of many of the exhibits, and their in spection of those most conveniently situated was necessarily brief. This was a fault which might have been in a considerable degree lessened by better arrangement and a wise exclusion of articles which were certainly out of place in the building. There was a waut of ar rangement too about the Industrial Sections. Articles were included in sections in which they found most anomalous company, and exhibits similar in character were scattered over the room in rather perplexing fashion. We knew that the Committees and energetic Secretary of the Chamber of Manufactures labored hard to make the arrangements. perfect, but their efforts were apparently hampered or restricted to a considerable degree. With regard to the exhibits .shown under the auspices of the Agri cultural Society, they were as usual well arranged and were easily found. In making these remarks we wish it distinctly understood that we have no desire to find fault with the Committees who arranged the exhibits in the Hall, but simply to draw attention to the de fects, with a view to better arrangements being made at any future Exhibition. Looking at the Exhibition of Thursday from a general point of view, it must be pronounced a success. It afforded a more complete view ofour industrial and manufacturing progress than any thing that has yet been seen in the colony. Many new features of interest were introduced, aud bad the room not been crowded, would have beeu seen to even greater advantage than they were. Those who have not seen the exhibits in the Hall should take an opportunity of seeing them. One clay is not sufficient to exhaust the Show; two or even three days might be profitably spent in looking into the evidences of the material pro gress of the colony so prominently brought under notice here. We have already dealt with several sections of the Exhibition, hut our criticisms were necessarily incomplete, as the whole of the features of the Show were not before us. The Agricultural Society's portion of the Show was very creditable to growei'3 aud producers. The wool we have already commented upon. It is to be regretted that there was not more competition in this section, but the samples of fleece which were shown were undoubtedly magnificent. The collection of agricultural produce was small— smaller, indeed, than was expected, although admittedly our harvest has been a comparative failure—but the grain shown was a good sample. The display of fruit, flowers, and vegetables was good, and some novelties in both the former lines were noticeable. There was a large atten dance on Thursday, but, doubtless, many who are more interested iu the industrial sections postponed their visit till to-day. His Excel lency the Governor was present during the afternoon, escorted by Mr. S. Davenport aud Mr. J. F. Conigrave, and went through various departments of the Exhibition. The grounds during the afternoon presented a most animated appearance. The marquee, with its exquisite collection of choice jflowers and pot plants, was, as might be expected, the favorite resort of the ladies; the agricultural and other machinery attracted the attention of prac tical farmers, squatters, and others, 'while an endless field fcr study was offered by the indoor exhibits. Amusements of various kinds were in full awing. Cheap jacks and itinerant showmen of different nationalities and varying degrees of ability plied their callings with a view to speedy-acquirement of the "almighty dollar," and the refreshment booth proprietors did a capital trade. The Judges' luncheon booth was catered for by the energetic aud' genial proprietor of the Goodwood Hotel. Below it will be found that we have dealt with the exhibits in detail AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE. We were somewhat disappointed with the agricultural produce section, as the entries were by no means numerous, and in some lines there were no exhibits at all. Mr. J. H. Angas carried away the Challenge Cap with a good sample, considering the season, but the weight, 67 lb3. Re ozs., was not equal to what we have been accustomed in previous years. Mr. J. Bigga took second honors with a sample weighing 65 lbs. 15 ozs., and the same exhibitor carried away the £5 prise. No hybridized wheat or selected wheat in straw was shown. Mr. Riggs's collections of grain in the straw were justly awarded prizes. Mr. J. Frame se cured honors for hills wheat, the weight being 65 lbs. 1 oz., and Mr. J. Thyer carried away the palm for plains wheat with a weight of (37 lbs. 5£ ozs. Mr. J. H. Angas taking second prize. A good sample of barley, but badly cleaned, shown by Messrs. Chambers & Blades, was awarded a prize, while Mr. A. Bell received honors for oats. Some capital samples of field peas were shown by Mr. J. Frame, who also sent in'fine 'specimens of rye and prairie gra ss seed. Messrs. Cobbledick, Bake, and Parsons were the representatives of fodder plants. Altogether this section was represented in a meagre manner. This may be attributed in a greatmeasiu-e to the season, but despite the in different harvest yield we had hoped to have seen a more representative collection of grain. Appended is the prize list:— Judges—For wheat, Messrs. J. Clark, J. Daw son, M. McCallum, T. Atkinson, M.P., and B. Patterson. For barley, &c.;—Messrs. W. Fer gusson, W. Thomson, and J. Duncan.

E. & W. Hackett— Boots for fodder, best colleotion, 12 of each variety, £1, Bake and Parsons. DAIRY PRODUCE. There was a very fair collection of dairy pro duce, the competition being, however, confined to only a few exhibitors. There was a good show of salted butter, and some excellent cheese. There was also some capital ham and bacon. The following is the prize list:— Judges—Messrs. H. A. Crawford, J. H. Efford, and J. Lyons. Butter, salted, three months old, 56 lbs., £3.Mrs. Callaby; £2, Mrs. Callaby: £1, lYm. Nnsw'orthy. Eleven entries. Cheese", not less than 200 lbs., £3, Jas. Welfare; £2, W. Guthrie, Four entries.

Hams, two, £1, Mrs. Callaby. FX.OIUCtn.TUEE. In this department a departure was made from the custom of past years, and the Show was held in a spacious marquee, instead of, as has hitherto been the ease, in the large hall of the Exhibition Building. This change was very much for the the better, as the splendid marquee. 100 feet in length by 40 feet in width, was amply sufficient to display to thej best advantage Flora's choicest treasures, and as it was specially constructed for the purpose by Mr. T. Macd.-na'ld, of Freeman street, it answered admirably. On first enter ing the huge tent the visitor could not fail to be struck with the general toir ensemble of the interior. The fine collection of pot plants,. down the western side of the pavilion, and numerous and varied assortment of ferns, palms, and exotic plants on its eastern side showed to advantage, whilst the centre table was devoted to flowers of varying hue and most brilliant coloring. Overhead, swaying gently with the undulations of the canvas, suspended in mid-air, were numerous lanterns of gorgeous coloring and intricate desigu. These imparted an appearance of gaiety strictly in keeping with the mass of color and stately specimens of hothouse floriculture upon the tables below. Cn entering the marquee a fine collection of exotic plants from the Botanic Garden attracted notice. There was also an assortment of poisonous plants, comprising the celebrated Upas tree of Java, the mephitic exhalations from which are said to bo so powerful as to cause the death of any unfortunate sleeping beneath its shade, while contiguous to it was the equally celebrated Ordeal tree of Mada gascar. A remarkably thriving specimen of the Strychnos, or strychnine plant, attracted much notice from the nature of the inscription affixed thereto—" The most poisonous plant known." Some specimens of tobacco grown at the Botanic Garden and a gigantic snake cucumber about four feet in length were viewed with interest. Passing onwards, a fine collec tion of palms and other hothouse pot plants were noticeable for their beauty and foliage. There was a beautiful and varied show of ferns, Sir Thomas Elder taking first and second prizes in this class for a fine specimen of Adiaatum Farleyense and Adiantum Cuneatum. For pot plants Mr C. Newenham obtained first prize for a fine Asplenium Flasidum, S. Pearson taking second honors for a splendid GleicheniaDiearpa. The first prize of six ferns was awarded to Messrs. Giles & Son, and also 12 outdoor plants. Ths competition in hand bouquets, buttonhole, and stand flowers was anything but keen. The severe season has had much to do with this. A very prettily arranged stand of flowers, placed in a " mirror staad," was choice in the extreme. Both the first and second prizes in this class fell to Mr. Edwin Smith. In basket flowers the competition was limited to three exhibitors,Mr. G, S. Fowler taking first honors. Seme fine table bouquets were shown, Mr. O. Zeigler obtaining first prize. The first prize for hand bouquets was "awarded to' Messrs. Giles & Son, but the competition was very limited. The geraniums were not as fiue as could be wished, and certainly not as good as we have seen at former exhibitions. The same may be said with regard to petunias. The show of dahlias was simply superb, and. the phlox varieties were admirably represented. Button hole flowers made a very poor show indeed, Messrs. Giles & Son took the first prize and_ Mr. Dobbie the second. A fine collection of caladiums exhibited by Messrs. Giles & Son deservedly obtained first prize. A fine lycopod exhibited by Mr. S. Pear son was awarded a first prize. For a collection of three specimens of the same plant Mr. G. S. Fowler obtained first honors. We now come to one of the rarest exhibits in the whole show. At the entrance to the pavilion was a bulbous pot planfc, with a long stem surmounted with white flowers. This is called singularly enough " The Holy Ghost plant," or Peristeria Eiata, and is exhibited by the Hon. G. C. Hawker, who gained a first prize for it as a rare plant. The most striking feature in the flower is that in the centre the petal forms a most perfect re presentation of a dove. The flower is a cup sliaped one, having a centre leaf like a snap dragon, and the scent is most delicious. It is claimed for this plant that it is the first which has bloomed in the colony, although two others in the possession of the Hon. Thos. Elder and Mr. It. Barr Smith are now in bloom. The exhibits of roses were very poor, no doubt owing to the season. The prizefcakers were Messrs. E. Smith and J. B. Hughes. A clr>ice collection of cut flowers was shown, and at tracted much notice by their beauty. Verbenas and zinnias were well represented, and the latter were particularly worthy of notice, but competi tion was confined to the Hon. Henry Scott and Mr. Edwin Smith. Some fine collections of pot plants were exhibited by Sir Thos. Eider, Messrs. C. Newman, J. Pierson, and others. A very beautiful double fuschia, the Enchantress, shown by Sir Thomas Elder, obtained a first prize. The following is the prize-list • Plants in Pots.'—Judges—Messrs. E. Lane, A. MacDonald, "VV.

Judges' remarks—"The Judges are pleased to note the introduction of a marquee for the exhibition of plants, not only on account of the appearance and novelty, but as being more suitable for the general health of the plants. It is quite evident from the small competition in some classes the unfavorable season has affected their culture. We recom mend a prize should be awarded for six cox combs, they being of unusual excellence! The habit and culture of ferns in all exhibits are remarkably good and close in competition. We were pleased to see so great an "improvement and such keen competition in plants for table decoration, seven collections being exhibited. The whole collection of plants deserves special mention for its general excellence." Cut Flowers.—Judges—Messrs. F. Wood, T. Frazer, and B. J. Hibbert. New or rare, not previously exhibited, 5s., G.

Judges' remarks—"The Judges report that the show on the whole is quite as good as could be expected, considering the dry weather. They would call the attention of exhibitors to being more par ticular in naming their exhibits." FKU1TS. There was really an admirable display of fruit. The season has not been altogether favorable for our vineyards and orchards, more particularly for some descriptions of fruit, and it was pleasing therefore to note the excellent collection of Thursday's Show. The most casual visitor could not but pause to survey the golden and ruby apples, the light and purple luscious grapes, and the tempting-looking pears, and to the juveniles the temptations of the appetite must have been especially severe. The display of grapes was a capital one, there being all varieties of wine and table grapes, together with fancy growths new to very many. The apple department exhibited magnificent samples of the beBt growths, some being un usually fine and large. Reference to the award list will show that the principal prizes fell to well-known growers and old prizetakers. The pears were remarkably good, while the plums were fair. Some fine melons were also shown. The award list is as follows:— Judges—Messrs. T. Hardy, J. Cobbledick, J. Curnow, J. F. Pascoe, and Hon. T. Playford. Fruits, collection of,;£4 4s., R.

Judges Re marks—"Although there is a great falling off in the Quantity.of the exhibits, yet, considering the season, the exhibits as a whole are very cerdit able. They would specially call the attention of exhibitors to number of exhibits' which would have taken prizes, but the Judges were unable to award prizes on account of the neglect of the.exhibitors in not putting the numbers on their exhibits." . VEGETABLES. The vegetables were accommodated under the northern and western verandahs, and although the display was not so large as many expected to see, still there was a capital collec tion, which comprised some remarkably fine in dividual exhibits. The principal exhibitors were Messrs.. Newman, Cobbledick, Sutton Bros., and Haliiday. The onions and potatoes were very superior, and therewere some fine cabbages and trombones. The collection of vegetables comprised some well-assorted varieties of green stuff, and altogether the display was.. V9ry creditable. The prize-list is as follows:— Judges — Messrs. Win.

The Judges withheld the second prize for pumpkins, as they considered they were not pure. They wish to call special notice to a dish of white Spanish onions, also to a nice exhibit of egg fruit." • "YV'e understand that the National Bank has given notice to the Adelaide City Council to reduce their overdraft to £2,000. In case of their not doing so the Bank will charge 10 per cent, on the amount owing. When the school census was taken in the District of Port Adelaide a short time ago 2,217 were scheduled, and out of this number 1.698 were between the ages of 7 and 13 years. Of these only 1,217 were in attendance at school, thus leaving 481 children requiring the imme diate attention of the School Visitor. Through the courtesy of Mr. D. Bower, M.P. (Chairman of the Local Board of Advice), we have perused a report to the Board from Mr. J. H. H. Vock ing, Superintendent of School Visitors, on the subject of the 481 delinquents. It is dated February 25, and says:—"After repeated calls and persuasions 223 of that number entered schools. Notices ordering parents to send their children to school were served in 246 cases, and of these 211 went to school. A second notice was served in 18 cases, out of which number 17 went to school. Thus the work of compulsion reads: —Found out of school, 481; subsequently sent to school, 451; exempt, 28; still not at tending, 2=451."
