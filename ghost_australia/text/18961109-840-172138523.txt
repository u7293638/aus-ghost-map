GLIMPSES OF NANBEN. 44 1 have only seen Nausea twice in my life,'' writes Miss Ella Hepwortb Dixon in the 44 Lady's Pictorial." "US&ch; tinio like tbe hero of 4 An Enemy of thelPeople,' he stood— alone. The first time wusat a crowded even ing party in the Regent's Park. Arriving late, I found tho lion of the evening drawn up in a corner of the staircase, gariug at the seething drawing-rooms with &u; inscrutable expression. No one was near him, and he had evidently succeeded in baffling the efforts of biscfaarming hostess to mako him talk. He bad a winuiug smile, however, and was not wanting in soci ability. 44 The second time 1 sawihim was in July, 1893\. The localo was eventforther north tbau tbo Regent's Park, for it was but two days' steaming from the North Capo. Wo wore on our way back, but still nitbin tbe region of the Midnight Bun, when we passed him, sailing away on bis great oucsb. Early one moraing, in n dark uarrow fjord, wo heard that the Fram was sighted. There web only time to open the scuttle and kneol upin one's bunk to see the curious and impressive sight, framed, like a picture, by the porthole- Across tho fjord, just in front, lay a strip'of brilliant auu- shine, turning the waters to-burnished gold ; on each side was the impressive blackness of rocky cliffs. There was a long waiting. And then there camo slowly out of tbe deep shadows a groy-ghost-like ship . a small, three- masted, strunge-looking craft, with ono tall, solitary figure on tho bridge. In another minute the solitary man ou the phautom vessel had sailed across the patch of golden sunlight, and had disappeared, northwards, in the gloom fjord."
