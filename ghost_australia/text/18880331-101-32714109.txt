One day, in the midst of the great throng in Collins Street, I met Fritz Wagner, He looked like a ghost-gray hollow^ chceked-scarcely more thad a skeleton. , ' ','You see it,"-he said, as I glanced at him.

'And now remorse soused tue. I suâerod agonies whenl remembered my true lore, Therese, and my dear cousin Leopold. I cold not rest. . I knew no- thing of the fate of'my friends in Ger mauy, but-I resolved atlast to return and see Therese who, if she lived, was forty years old, and beg her forgiveness, and to give myself up to the authorities as my cousin's murderer. This, I fancied, would be an expiration. ' I bade adieu, as I belie vedi to Australia forever, and sailed in the next steamer for my native home. ' I travelled many miles over land to reach the village after leaving the ocean. At last I reached it late on the night of a stormy summer day.
