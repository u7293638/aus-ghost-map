THE CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS OF SYDNEY. (From the Sydney Mail ) No. XIV. SYDNEY INFIRMARY AND DIST INSANE (COSTINurn ) BRIDES the resident surgeon and the district surgeon, there are ten medical officers whose services are gratuitous namoi), a honorary consulting physician, in honorary consulting surgeon, four honorary) physicians, and four honorary surgeons These "gentlemen pay) the greatest attention to the duties of their respec the offices quite as much attention, indeed, as if they were in receipt of liberal salaries from the institution There are no class of men, with the exception perhaps of clergymen, who are called upon to devote so much of their time and their energies to works of benevolence us are medical practitioner, of all grades Yet the) do it cheerfully there are a few exceptions, | no doubt, but they are so few as only to prove the rule The honorary physicians and surgeons of this institution not only divide among themselves the charge of all the patients therein, but consult together as to ever,, case which requires peculiar consideration the patients in the morning have, therefore, the advan stage, in any case of difficulty, of the professional talent of all these gentlemen The medical officers like the form, collectively, a kind of advising board as to the internal management of the Infirmary, an i as such have from time to time offered mail) per) valuable suggestions list present honorary medical officers, are the following -The Hon J Macfarlane, ML), MLO, consulting physican ; Mr. Charles Nathan, c resulting surgeon, is O Allen) ne, M. D. , J. C. Cox, Jil) , A M Brown, MB and Arthur Renwick, MD, physicians, V S Jones, M D , Charles M'Ka), ill) , Mr Alfred Roberts, and Mr E Redford, surgeons The office of resident surgeon and apothecary) is a salaried one the duties attached to the other may be pretty well gathered from its title, and as will be readily supposed, it is a very arduous post Upon the resident surgeon devolves the immediate professional charge of all the patients, and attention to any of their cases when the physician or surgeon under whose care they have been ill feed is avoidable) absent He attends to all cases of emergency), and has a variety of duties to perform in connection with the internal administration of the InQrinar), the ISMIC of medicines, the keeping of the medial and surgical records, It He is interdicted four private practise of of any kind, and is prohibited from being absent more than three hours at any one time without leave of the weekly committee in all cases of absence, however temporary, he is required to inform the matron of such absence, and to enter in a book kept for that purpose a memorandum as to where he is to be found the present resident surgeon, Mr Hugh Houston has held this office from t in time the Infirmary was first established The fact of his having i continued so long to hold so arduous past is a suit tient guarantee of his peculiar fitness t in it There are six district surgeons, among,? whom the whole dispensary practice and the attendance in our patients in the city and suburbs, are divided These gentlemen two small allowances from the funds of the institution The regular allowance to a district surgeon is £50 per annum, but additions of 19 and 11r) have been made to those of two of those gentleman, on account of their attendance in certain suburb, beyond their former limits Looking at the nature and extent of the duties attaching to the post of district surgeon, these allowances, it will be seen, are very small they are but just sufficient to Uko these gentlemen out of the class of honorary officers Hut then like the other medical officers of the institution, that) must be supposed, we presume, to be more in fluenced by feelings of benevolence and by the experience to be derived from increased professional practice, than by the small emoluments attaching to their respective offices The present district Surgeons are Mr L Aaron, Mr Miles Kg in, Mr John Moon, Mr It Graham, Mr W Grey, and Mr J C Gilhooley) All the medical officers of the Infirmary) are elected by the subscribers, and provision is made in the mica for the retirement of these officers the reside at Surgeon excepted) in rotation The) are, however, eligible for re-election, and are generally re- elected I if willing to act No gentleman can be a medical officer of this Institution- either honorary or sal dried-up less helps a British qualification as phones or surgeon (as the case may be) and has obtained a certificate from the New South Wales Medical Board The directors have power to dismiss the Resident Surgeon for good cause, and to appoint (mother person to act in his place until the next annual meeting of subscribers There are two dispensers Mr V I* Crompton, and Mr James Until latterly) there was but one dispenser but it was found utterly impossible to get through the work without a second The magnitude of the work in this branch of the establishment will be readily understood when it is borne in mind that all the out patients from the several districts get their medicines here Provision is made for the admission to the In farmer) of pupils The articled apprentice or pupil of on) legally, recognised medical practitioner in the colony may, on the approval of the weekly committee, be admitted as a pupil of the Iuurniar) on p lying in the funds of the Infirmary) a subscription of it is for the first year of his attendance, 3 3s for the second year, and £2 2s for the third year After this, he is to have free admission These pupils are privileged to attend all operations and post mortem, examinations, as well as to visit the wards when any of the physical or surgeons are present, and to observe the practice of these gentlemen They have also access to all the books in which the cases of the various patients, and the treatment of these patients are registered Now, looking at the comprehensive nature of this institution, embracing as it does cases of all classes, both medical and surgical, is perhaps one of the very best schools to which the medical student could resort There are, v c are told, but few hospitals even in England where so great a variety of cases would be found grouped together as in the Sydney Infirmary) And yet, strange to say, there is but one pupil at present in attendance at this establishment there have formerly been more and borne gentlemen who have now an eminent position in their profession have been pupils at the marmor) Hut the attendance of pupils has never been anything like what might have been expected, considering the advantages which were and still are offered Pupils can also attend the dispensary) for instruction in the compounding of medicine and making up of prescriptions on pa) ing to the resident surgeon an annual fee of £3 3s Why it is that this institution is not resorted to more largely as a school for young men in the various branches of the healing art we are at a loss to understand Complaints have been frequently used as to the difficulty of finding an o inlet for the Australian youth the Bar has already been cast open to those whose talent lies in that way and there are plenty of attorney' offices in which, the young aspirant for enrolment can " serve his articles In some of the Churches, too-if not in all-honours are attainable on the spot the Sydney) Inhrnitii) supplies the remain- ing writes to in opening to the learned professions " a good and readily accessible school of medicine and surgery ' The next person in official importance in this establishment (and peri ops the most important of all as to her influence in the internal working of the institution is the matron The lady who at present fills this situation-Mrs Ghost-has been in the Infirmary since the time of its establishment in the year 18 IS Her first appointment was that of nurse, but she has been matron since 1852 the post of the matron is a most did cult and responsible one She is what may be termed the housekeeper of the establishment \- doing and seeing to "every thing which in a private house would be done and seen to the mistress of it The good order of the whole Infirmary, and the efficiency of the wardsmen, nurses, and other servants connected with it, must obviously depend in a great measure upon the competency and energy of the matron , just as the general management of any pay etc household must depend upon the elia rector and temper of the mistress So far as we are able to pronounce an opinion, we should say that Mrs Ghost is just the person for this post, and her long experience must have given her a thorough knowledge of of all its duties the functions of the house steward (Mr Williams) are sufficiently explained by his title, but there is more work attaching to this office than any one who has not enquired into the matter could possibly imagine Besides the weighing out and distribution of provisions, so , he has to keep a . erroneously named as Mr William Houston, in a former article number of books in which every possible thin.; realise to the internal administration of the (Stnbhsh event is recorded The quantity of writing which thus cut als must be seen to be open suite in No doubt however, it is all quite success in, and these records RIO certainly very useful Lserv change of diet to every patient is thus recorded, after having been initialled by the resident surgeon, and the necessary memoranda for this kitchen I", have to be made upon each of these alterations Now there are four classes of diets Tell died half diet, low rebel, and spoon diet The first three of these are fixed rations of a mons kinds-i seven persons eliot is the same in each elliss, although each class differs from the other He spoon tin. on the contrary is just the thing the medical officers in attend nice upon the various patients in think it necessary to order Probably of all the spoon diets ordered in the matter tion no two BIL as holla alike r for it they are the Kamo as to one meal, they differ as to other nicols And all those differs fees have to be carefully) recorded noted, and provided for On the dais that are examined into these matters on the 20th of March last-the issues were 15 full dress, is half diets, r> loss diets, and 127 spoon diets The clerk, Mr H Ki_>«ill, keeps all the minutes, books of account he and does all the duties of like character as Inch are natural Is entailed in the management of such an establishment as this The servants of the Infirmary consist of live female nurses, three for the day and two Air the most disease synodsmen, ten for the day met two for the night four 1 undresses, three sers nuts employed in the inches, annie and female general servant, a mess room and his wife (both of as horn perform anno is duties about the establishment) and it gatekeeper and his wife One recommendation as Inch, we understand, the honorary) medical officers base urged, more than once, upon the directors in the importation of a body of nurses trained under Miss _« fighting the S system It is with acts great diffidence that case a venture to express any opinion as he li mu j be at issue with that of authorities so much higher than our own as the honorary medical officers , but having formed such an opinion, we are bound, as we conceive, to give utter- ance to it N c doubt, then, the expediency of this proceeding, and we doubt its necessity It is not quite so certain that these trained nurses would use ceed they as are considered a failure, we are told, at one institution - we think it Glasgow and if they did not succeed they e they would be less hkeH to suet cold here as here the climate and hibits of the people are different It is probable, too, that they should share a little too much in the feeling which is so general among persons of the working class who come to Austral i-that they ought to make a speedy fortune, and would be consequently, discontented V second reason is, that while females ss tiling and apparently competent to undertake the duties of nursing, are readily procurable upon the spit it seems scarcely fair to expend a large portion of the resources of an institution supported by John - t in subscriptions, and by grants from the public purse, in the importation of a number of nurses from Europe Inn di), case cannot understand is he a sufficient number of nurse-- cannot be trained at the Infirmary itself There are nurses there already who have been engaged in their duties many years and who must be competent to teach others with the acting superintend Knie of a person so experienced as the present matron and the able supervision of the medical officer themselves, there could be no difficulty, ase should think, in training any number of nurses As far is our obser nation went, everything seemed to LO on exceed singly well But there may have been points in as Inch improvement is needed, as Inch escaped our attention, or is to as Inch sec as are not competent to judge Surely, how, ever if any impros cinemas in the system of nursing at the Infirmary are necessary, the honorary-) medical officers could themselves bring about these impros ementa mmmmmmm_______m_m__m_ css
