A Railway Ghost. As there is a ghost in this story, according to all established rules it ought to commence . with ' once upon a time,' but as I am some what of an inconoclast, not even such a vene'rV able figure of speech can escape annihilation at my hands.; • ■. .

And then I knew that this man—this fiend had stolen my body, and given mo his. • 'Maddened with the discovery, I rose to my feet—his feet—which tottered beneath me, and I'struck wildly at the vision of myself on the other seat. But I found my arms light ~".'fcs' vapour, for they passed over his body, Which went through them, giving mo the im pression of pain.

Now I have told you what I am, you will, doubtless, like to know what, I want. Very good ; you shall see.' ,,The.ghost in my body then began to feel in my pockets, from which he drew out my. meerschaum, which he filled from my. pouch arid lit with one of-my matches. ' > 11 ' Ah,' he proceeded, puffing like a stenm engine, ' you smoke very good stuff—natural leaf an Old Judge ; not a bad mixture, though I prefer- a little Onvendiali with it myself. Not at all a bad body of yours, either,' he went on,, eyeing' the form in . which lie was sitting; 'not at all a bad body; and it fits mo to a T, only a little short in the arms. By the way, I firid one of your front deeth ja little loose, so don't go arid say I did that, when you come to yourself again ; and your nose is a little long for me, but I dare say it blows none the worse for that.' I shuddered as I saw hini take out my pocket-handkerchief and use it on that cherished, organ of mine, gjj' Yes,; I., dare say now you feel the cold ja little; I did at first, but it's nothing when you' are used to it. I find your body very warm—being heavier than I am accustomed to wear ; but . it won't bo for long. I require it' positively for this night only,' as you say in your; play-bills; and will return it unin-: :jured by, the time we get to Ashbourne. By tliq, bye, let me beg of you to be a.little care ful how you throw your arms about so much asyou did just now,- for my body is of a more delicate construction than yours; and being !so* thin in substance, I am afraid you will .chafe it under, the arm-pits. You will ob serve, ladies and gentlemen' he went on, in lecturer's style,' that if I take a lighted match, and insert it in the corner of the patient's eye, he will feel no pain.! Saying this my dread ful companion proceeded to illustrate his remark by making a dive at my shadowy eye with a burning'match. I felt no pain as the match burned in my head. • , ■ ' You will allow, after all: you see,, that my shapel has its advantages,' tlio ghost pro ceeded; but it also has its disadvantages.
