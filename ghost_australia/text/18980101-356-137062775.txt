: BACK FRO THE DEAD. A nUSDAD come back from the dead is a sensational item of Lancashire news. About 18 years ago a young Blackburn man, engaged in the build ing trade, married, and with one child, suddenly disappeared from home, leaving no clue, except that it was generally believed he had gone to America "to seek his fortune." His wife, having waited the prescribed number of years, and receiving no tidings of her husband, was married a second time, and lived happily up to a short time ago, when her second hue band died. About a month after this event the wanderer returned to Black burn, and heard from a shopkeeper, who was ignorant of the wife's a second marriage, that she was still at the old home. Arrived there, the man was met by a young woman, whom a score of years previoues he had left in her cradle, and while he was relating to the incredulous girl the tale of his wanderings, his wife suddenly ap peared on the scene. She swooned on seeing what she supposed to be the ghost of her dead husband, and when she recovered from the shock she told her tale of waiting, and he of his wan derings in search of the fortune he never obtained. The man is now at home with his wife and daughter.
