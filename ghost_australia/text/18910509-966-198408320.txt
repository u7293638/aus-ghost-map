Although it is not needful to observe •H/x-ttc-er-like detail in these sketches one •tught to counsel the tourist by the Duuedin-CIiristchurch express to keep both eyes open whilst the train passes through the splendid scenery around the HluesUin. The traveller grows dizzy as the carriages seem to hang over a precipice with fern and flower covered steeps above them and the sea foaming hundreds of foot below them, the surf taking upon the uneven beach the appearance of a jjreat deep-blue garment with lacescalloped edges. Tlie best way to 6ee the peculiar attractions which surround the locality of Port Chalmers, with its tixpfeiisive floating and graving docks and its natural and acquired beauties, is to drive thither from Dunedin. 'Upon jt line day nooUting coiild.be more pleasant, and no, combination of quiet .landscape a'nd sea view more nerve- sooth- 'ing. For musical harmony you have the warbling of the birds and' the ceaseless murmur of the old ocean, which is surely the greatest miinnurer tliafc-ever- murmured. A human interest for the ethnologist is added by a Maori settlement in which live a chief, and the remnant of his followers. Prouec-dingin our train we reach Oarnaru ait seventy-eight miles from Dunedin— <taii<ai'u. which the learned linguists call Waniartio, a few others Q-ani- maroo, and tlic lvst':mmaroo—a place which would be most famous for its freestone were it not more celebrated for its Irish apples. So we .-see in many directions great fields <»f potatoes, the plants seeming a little withered this year, which is the driest season this land and the Canterbury Plains yonder have ever known since the white man dispossessed the Maori. Tlie natural surface of the soil is as liillocky as a graveyard, and just now ft certainly <Joes look somewhat parched. But there is so much moisture in the sittund that we see a " man ploughing followed by a big covey of seagulls—as tame as household cats—that feed upon the worms evicted from thenhomes by the tyrannical ploughshare. An Australian is amused ' by hearing the people talking of what they call a "drought," and seeming to be ratlier proud of it as a new experience. Drought ? I should like some of them to visit our Far Korth in drought time. It would humble them. They know no more by Now Zealand experience about droughts than some men who style themselves "mining engineer" know about mining.' Where there are not potato or turnip fields in this neighbourhood -there are stone quarries, to whose.presence is due the fact that Oamaru Ls probably the. oumeliest and most solidly built town in i New Zealand. ' The local industries, j besides quarrying and potato-growing, ; are dairying and grazing. Here, dose to the tine and expensive breakwater ( harlnMir, are a woollen factory and ! slaughtering yards and, meat-freezing and preserving-worKS. Hence steamers laden with frozen meat sail direct for England. Tli is frozen meat trade is truly to New Zealand vliatBioken Hill Ls to South Austail ia. It has given fresh hope and new enter- ' prises to the people, and has wonderfully increased the .total value of their imports. They have the old world for their market. It is better than a goldfiold to them. Upon this beach amongst other places dies the frost fish, alias Hiku (Maori), alias l.'f>i'lo)>iii< txnulatn* (Latin), which is very eccentric in its habits—an unsociable, Ishmaclitish sort of party. Perhaps that is the reason why it is such a delicious article of food. An old native who had been a cannibal in his youth- ; fu] days, but had developed into , an exemplary Church member, i told nie that in his experience ] the most tasty fellow- creature to eat, : taking all considerations into account, • was a person of a gloomy uncommunicative 1 turn of mind. People who reflected a good deal seemed to grow tender, and if he were ever going into the cannibal line I again nothing shculd ever induce him to i make a meal upon a gentleman who did not reflect. He could not honestly re- i commend such a party for culinary pur- \ poses. (Gourmands say that their frost tisli i.s the most delicious in all the New . Zealaudian waters, but the delicate ; to'ohhsomeness of their flounder or sole i shall have all my vote and in- ! teres t,. The eccentricity of the frost fish's habits attracts attention to him: but the scientific men, of course, differ a good deal about the degree of his peculiarity, and consequently they make sarcastic remarks to each other. Tliat is - their general way. One thing agreed upon is that die frost, fish, which is about 4 ft. long, and weighs 1 lb. to the foot, is never caught. He is always found in the «avly morning upon the beach above high water-mark. One section of the disputants say that he is cast up by the ocean swells on frosty nights only, and that he strands himself whilst chasing smaller fish, aud is frozen to death; another that lie does not choose frosty nights any more than unfrosty nights ; another thai he is a deep-water. inhabitant, and that when he gets into the shallow sea in connection . with the spawning enterprises of his family be dies from the change of climate, and is washed ashore dead ; another that in a certain depth of water he strikes his bail upon the sand or shingle, and then gives up the ghost; another that he is blind, aud cannot see that he is in danger of being stranded upon an inhospitable coast •ntil it is, alas2 too late; another that he niinply puts into port to rub off parasites -dry- docks himself, in fact; another that lie goes to the foreshore entirely without any particular object—to see the scenery, perhaps, andifi BO enraptured with the view that he allows himself to be cauerht; that, in short, he commits suicide whilst Buffering from temporary mental aberration. This mystery enhances his value.. He is sometimes bought for as much as half a crown a pound, which, according to the market scale, is a good deal more than aomefiiennndsomemarriageable daughters are worth. We cross the Waitaki, which is the dividing line between Otago and Canterbury, and one of the largest of New Zealand rivers; and, 131 miles from Dunedin. all the way along the coast, we reach Timaru, which has through many difficulties developed into a prosperous place. The hack country is as fertile as it is picturesque, but the town, like many ethers which we visited, appears to be overbuilt. The absence of larrikins and <»f Australian perpetual brightness is proved by the presence over the footpaths of glass verandahs, which the local youth, not livingupto theirstone-throwing privileges, have allowed to remain unbroken. In some parts of New Zealand there is difficulty in getting a stone to •throw, but here one sees enough to fit out •juite a large number of larrikins. In one of the rights-of-way in the town I saw choice dahlias and mignonette growing in great, luxuriance. Believing them to be provided for the use of the public, and that the people of Timaru would be encouraged and flattered by a little kindly attention from a distinguished visitor, I gathered some of the flagrant blooms. I wish I hadn't done so. T was afterwards solemnly assured that they were private property, and that- their owner wished particularly to sec me and to show me an especially brutal savage dog. ujiou the sharpness of whose teeth he prided himself. I deeply regretted having to plead another engagement in excuse. T am not a good judge of bulldogs. Before we proceed we look at the Timaru breakwater, concerning which English financial writers have blunted so many pens and spilt so much ink. The opportunity of seeing this structure i.s one of the attractions to tourists who come to Timaru as the best starting point for Mount Cook, which they reach in two days'travel,, chiefly coaching, via Fairlie Creek. The breakwater, which has cost a great deal of money, is built where in full fore© the Eastern Pacific waves dafcli against it. No better spot could have lieen chosen for a contest between human engineering skill and the fiercest powers of the elements, but that probably had no more to do with the intentions of the builders than ideas of the spectacular efl'ect of tho ocean-beaten breakwater in stormy weather. A casual observer, however, might be forgiven if he pointed out a more favourable-looking, partlysheltered place lower down the beach. It is just possible, of course, that nobody i n particular hod any land there, or that i t was too far from Timaru, or that it was not really suitable. I have frequently noticed that the -casual visitor is—dl 1 honestly believes that lie is—a greater expert than the professional engineer. Tlie breakwater is made chiefly of great 30-ton blocks of cement and rubble; which themselves were first cast in a huge mould. Large numbers of these were dropped into the sea, and after they had settled down a solid n i O n o l i t h was' formed over them. Thus a safe harbour was made, wherein' are moored large vessels taking away frozen meat which is prepared here, and large quantities of cereals. So heavy Ls the dash of the swell that when stormy winds do blow the water thunders against the monolith in gr&Ct; masses, aiid the ships have j to be moored by cables to reduce the oscillation until they are roped around as much as a wild bull prepared for the branding iron. Since the breakwater has been made the shingle has accumulated to a remarkable, if not a dangerous, degree upon one of its sides ; what tho ultimate effect of this may be appears to be doubted even by the local nieir of the best- information. One' thing is for tlie present assured—the works have been of great value to Timaru, which before the harbour was protected was feared as a place with a great reputation for shipwrecks. One of the luost conspicuous things in the town is au obdisk, erected to the memory of a number of bravo fellows who lost their lives in trying to rescue passengers by two vessels wrecked in the port in 1882. . The harbour works arc under the charge of a Harbour Trust, and an English paper has lately been attempting to prove that that Trust commits sins of omission and sins of commission in management. The Trust replies through the newspaper, and seems to show that the English bondholders who lent the monej p for the works have not suffered yet, at any rate, and that the prospective income from the harbour dues and tho local rating is enojigli to meet all obligations -Even if the worst came to the worst 1 suppose. the money-lenders would not suffer, because the New Zealand Government, no matter how much they might protest, ^ would doubtless bo morally bound, for tlie sake of tlie national honour, to take tho responsibility for the loan. It seems to me, however, that this Harbour Trust- system of New Zealand in an excellent, thing for South Australians to avoid. It probably would not be tolerated where it exists if the conditions of New Zealand were our conditions. In that- country the extraordinary disproportion of coastline, nearly aJJ of it exposed to the iinmuderated fierceness of ocean waves, thegreatnumber of dangerous bur harbours, and thedifficultyof communication preventing direct central control, all tend to complicate the management of the ports, and explain tlie formation of the trusts. To these Trusts local men are elected by ballot in the same way as Councillors : and they do the popular thing or the right thing according to their conscience or their light; assist in borrowing from England large sums of money, without any personal responsibility, in order to make works which may or may not be entirely necessary: and trust to their revenues aud to Providence to pay the interest and to repay tlie principal. The revenues are raised from local rates and from charges upon the shipping for the use of the harbour accommodation. Although some of the Trusts havo done very fairly, and although the system under which they work is a fine one from a local point of view, even if it does encourage tlie unnecessary multiplication of harbours, I should not care upon the whole to lend much money to a Harbour Board without the most absolute State guarantee. In one part of New Zealand is a Board'which borrowed £200,000, but lias not continued to pay to its English creditor the rate of interest agreed upon, and a candidate has recently been returned to Parliament for that district upon the distinct understanding that he will work his hardest to secure a removal of the harbour rate, and presumably to make the interest a charge upon the general revenue. Then the members of a Harbour Board, being local property-owners and local residents, and probably interested in local shipping, will naturally be averse to imposing taxes which might heavily affect their own property, or"to making the harbour dues large. As en- ' joyment of one form of public life leads to the attempt to enjoy higher forms, just as one sin leads to another, some of the member.-, of the Boards no doubt intend eventually tt> try for Parliamentary election, and hi the meantime are prone to do the thing which ib popular. Thus in a case the other day a Board reduced its charges because tlie income was good, instead of making an extra reserve for redemption or for contingencies ; oilier Boards are absurdly lavish in spending their money. In one town, for instance, they have erected a palatial suite of offices, which will probably be loo- large for them even if the building should stand till Millennial Day. Taking it altogether the more one sees of the New Zealand harbour system the less one likes it. At its best it is risky.

When I see the residents of a prosperous country town clamouring for a railway to be put through it I think of a child crying because he is not allowed to touch a pretty, dazzling, red-hot coal with his tender little fingers. At Ashburton is a fine hospital, the matron whereof has doricultural knowledge enough to qualify her for a head-gardenership. She lias turned every little nook and corner of the building into a conservatory ; wherefore the patients bless her. A little way beyond the hospital is a Benevolent Asylum for aged men ; it is called, in the pleasant- fashion adopted throughout New Zealand, "The Old Man's Home." Of course it is all a matter of sentiment, but ."Old Man's Home".has a.much more engaging sound than "Destitute Asylum." The unfortunate old fellows who live here are very proud o f their " home ;" they work in the garden, and manage, t o make it attractive, and in the fruit season one of them manufactures a fine lot of jam, which both he and his comities esteem above all other preserves. New Zealand cares well for its unfortunate, its aged, and its indigent; and the day may come when a certain colony little nearer t o Adelaide will decline any"-longer t o "crowd some hundreds o f infirm, old people in the midst of a h o t city between jhigh prison-like walls, but will place the inmates in a locality away from the dost and bustle of the town, where they may breathe fresh air, and get, perhaps, a sight of the trees and tlie green grass, and a sniff of the wild flowers.. They would probably survive the shock. The multiplicity of clocks in Ashburton reminds-me to meutioii a special feature noted throughout New; Zealand, probably in pursuance of the idea of. the outfitters for Captain .Cook's second South Pacific voyage, who- made timepieces a special feature. "You see clocks peering at you almost everywhere—big clocks and little clocks, ancient clocks and modern clocks, clocks .which strike and clocks that are comparatively dumb: demure-faced clocks with frosted dials, garish clocks with gaudily painted faces; fast clocks and slow clocks, clocks which work and strike, clocks which work without striking, mid clocks which strike work altogether, and, seeming always to have done so since they left England, have now lost so much time that they are quite unable to make up the arrears. Others of the clocks display a creditable federal spirit by keeping Australian time —all sorts of Australian time, from an hour to two hours behind of New Zealand. The New Zealanders call that conduct disloyal depravity. I christen it federalism and enterprise. New Zealanders are the first people in all the Southern Hemisphere to rise from bed in the morning, aud that unpleasant fact may partly account for their appareut extravagance in timepicces.
