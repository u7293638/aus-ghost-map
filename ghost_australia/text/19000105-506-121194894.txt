No leave asked he to soour that stock Of '?beak' or 'board'— for, aoorning human oarar He came a 'wraith,' endowed with spectral perre, Astride a phantom oouner on the air. To pick and choose the fattest of the beeves— To laugh with ghostly glee when th' droven ran , In speeohkss dread amid the dripping y leaves— r %? *»PP««^. »? °ttJy goblins can, In lightning haste— or so it was averred— Upon the wind behind the forayed bert— While-fell the driving nun in torrent* down,' Aa the dogs and drovers '?curried' towards the town. * Dark tales were told of Brugge long before The night this awful wraith was fins espied By th' 'booey* droven, camping with fivesoore Of Tiken from tbe far Chinchilla side ; Twas said a squattos's ghost had taken a lien For miles around the lonely, aorubgirt With the spirit of a stockman who. had beea f^ Wrongly strangled as the murdered squatter's Cain— And oft tbe twain together— but aometimea only one Came out on ' flying ' hones to haunt the Bnggai ran — Until the truth should triumph, aad th' reprobate should die, Who oaused this double murder in the merry days gone by. But Doubt, that frowns all ghostly lore away, Soon came the strange perturbing tales to hear— Of moBu that*** broke,' and teams that went astray, And droven young who'd turned half grey, with fear; And carriers, stout and daring hitherto, Who, quaking 'neath their waggons, held their bieath When the awful apparition oame in view— (His mystical marauding to pursue), All shrouded in the cerements of death ; ?Until at length old Squatter Doubt grew vext. ' They're mad.' he aisid— ' a riding ghost! What next?' And ridiouled the legends, and reckoned it unfair To say an honest settler's ghost would turn a cattle-slayer. Nay more — to promptly prove the yarns were vain. The sturdy, doubting squatter cleaned his gun, AdA started on the route by Bragga Plain, With a mob of flighty steers oft his run. And with him went two drovers, station. bred, Two weather-beaten bushmen, spare and tough, Who said 'twas time that all the ghosts were dead, Since the living find the times quite bad enough. And by-and-bye, one wintry eve, they reached the Haunted Moor, And lit their watch-fires round Ae plain, and made their camps/secuy^ And soon, anon, with loaded guns, as midnight drew anear, \ ? Waited eaoh behind a tree for the 'goblin 'to appear. It was a stilly, frosty night, and sounds the slightest bore Sharply on the crackling air ; and nearly bright as day The August moon, long' biding, threw its Warning light before The ' laager lT where the phantomV f 068 in silent ambush lay. And mused the sturdy squatter as fast, the moments sped — ' ThiB duffer won't appear to- night— he'll wait for rain or snow — It's past the hour when churchyards yawn, and graves give np their dead, Ha, ha ! I think I'll go to roost. What's that ? ' he turned, for lo ! A something white waa speeding round the outskirts of the wood, Bight towards the lignum where the wildest cattle stood ; Three rifles cracked upon the night, ^ and, by the moon's last beam The shooters found a dying steed — part subject of this theme, And following on a gory track long ere break o' day, Came up, and caught the wounded 'ghost ' who tried to run away. A crowded court in Brumby town, and lawyers in galore A cadaverous cookie . in the dook— a man of six feeb four — A jury roll of squatters and of supers half and half; A judge who owned a station, and was never known to laugh ; And shortly from that courthouse, that Jean, cadaverous wight, All inaoacled and guarded, was hurried ' out of sight ; ' ' - And when next we passed thro' Brugga with Tikeia for the sale Theghoat that stole the oattle was in gaol. .
