RELIGIOUS MANIA. A terribly sad case came under the notice of Messrs Pennington and Bell, JsP., at the Carl- ton Police Court on Saturday morning, when a fine young woman of very attractive appearance, about 16 years of age, was brought up on a charge of insulting behaviour. The elastic charge had been stretched in this case to cover a charge of lunacy, as the girl was suffering from religious mania. On the unfortunate girl being brought into court she immediately threw her- self on the floor, and after crossing herself cried out in the most pitiful terms—“In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I’m a saint, but nobody’s sainted me. He's trying to tempt me, but I'm a saint." This conduct was con tinued whilst Dr Griffiths and Brozer gave their evidence, testifying that the girl was a helpless lunatic. The Bench committed the girl to the Yarra Bend. On a constable and Sergeant Doyle attempting to remove the girl, she cried out— "Don't touch me; don't touch me ; I'm a saint." 'The circumstances surrounding the case are of a very distressing nature. The father once occupied a good position in the Government service, but was subsequently committed to the lunatic asylum. Then followed a daughter, and but a couple of weeks a son, and now a second daughter has followed. As the girl was being removed to the asylum in a cab from the police station, the scene was again of a most dis tressing nature. The mother of the unfortu nate creature appeared in court, and was apparently almost totally overcome with her sad bereavement.— ‘Herald.'
