OLD-TIME DAYS. [By James.Buckham.] l ean see the river gliding, as .it used to long ago, ■ Bound the shoulder-.of the meadow where the thick-set willows grow. • I can hear it purl: and ripple in a .gentle ■ lullaby,.. . To a little barefoot dreamer gazing up into the ^ sky, . Yonder lie the brown old farmhouse crown'd with chimney huge and square,"" And the barn beloved of swallows with its weathercock in air. > I can hear the river ripple blend with cow-bells from the hill, And the far-o2 clang and rumble of the log frame in the mill. ; Howl loved to lie a-dreaming in the deep and quiet grass •. While I watched the ghosts of noonday through the fields of heaven pass ! I was happy—oh, so happy!—while the purl ing of the stream Seemed to weave a little poem for the musio of my dream. Oh, to taste once more - the. pleasure that I knew in years gone by, When my' heart Was-full of sunshine as the summer morning'sky ! Oh, to feel that outdoor gladness when the days were fresh'and lohg, And the bluebird olimed to heaven on the ladder of his song ! "
