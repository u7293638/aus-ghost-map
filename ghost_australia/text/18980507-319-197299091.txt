Thus the notoriously imperfect \- 0. 1 is not nhofe the suspicion as an "Apello Csesnrcm," of failing- Mr. Barrett on the very point upon winch he relies. Thc:refercncu to Haiplet's ape as "thirty years" is, moreover, pcrfeeilv con sistent, .with the "Full thirty lime®," or .years , O.l. 130, 132. 333. act III., sc. 2) of married life that the player Kin? and queen . ( respectively re- \- presenting- Ilmnlct the -elder and Gertrude) are eh ul to have enjoyed. Mr. Barrett, however,; does not alter that wordincr to the "Full fortie' y&irs;" of 0. 3. It is also in agreement '.with IUmlel;s hav- insr 0 beard (1. act H., sc. 2), and with lain developed character and philosophy. Still Mr. Barrett — besides adapting the "made in Cermanv" theory rc Hatnlct .(as the man of action), so enun ciated l>y Klein (1816) and U'crdcr (1875) against Goethe's view—has adopted the ."juvenile Ham let" idea of the' Devrients (1S73), of whose r cult Furness, Furnivall, ' Uulliwell, Marshall, \- Minto and Moy Thomas are tlie principal Enlisli apostles. On the other baud Wcrder be- Iietes in a Hamlet of 30, so docs (Jervinus (author of the fainouM phrase,- "Hamlet is Oermanv'.'K and topelher with I'rofesor Dowdcn and Sir.

"being;of go young .days brought. up. with him" (Uatulctj. -"of" implies: '/roiii, "'meaning, "they had grown up from youlii together,?r-hot that they twerc- still-young. As ' for Hamlet's .father's ghost-using the . expression, "thy young blood," and "thou. noblq youth,!', they, arc but terms ' of tenderness/ Most fathers speak of- . "my.Ijoy," when. said boy is a bearded man. 'To. ' take '.other illustrations. In Troilus and Cressida, , the play embracing 'the death of Hector.' and the' tenth year of the siege of Troy makes "yoiing Lord Paris" at least 30, In Macbeth, "Youhg:SLward," named after his father, lias attained full manhood. Lnfen, in All's -W ell (act IV., sc. 5) refers to the old. king as I'of.able body as when he numbered 30." In .Much Ado (act ilf., sc. 3), we read— "IIow giddily turns about ail- the hot- bloods between fourteen and five and thirty." And Henry V. (who is made by Shakspeare' at least 2G when he . comes' to ' the throne) is spoken- wof as "in the very May morn of his youth,". Sir." -Barrett also.. quotes from Laertes's speech:— '.'Youth to itself rebels, though none;o!se near," . as if applying to Haqilcl; in reality It refers to. Ophelia.. This shows that in Shak6pearcs time- as instanced in many works on "Tlie Life of Man" I could quote from— youth was applied to greater extremes of age thun we do now. While then the word "youth" denotes the. maid of 17, and the man oi 30, Polouius calling Hamlet "young," terms his daughter "a green girl," "a baby, V and. Ophelia refers to Hamlet as "That unmatched forin- iind feature of blown youth." "A fashion" and "A toy" is but a passing fancy, a caprice, implv- Jiig Hamlet was a iiiilcr, a flifl. To toy ktilL means lo dally air.orouslj. not necessarily limited to men of 20. - "Forward" docs not here mean "precocious." but in contrast with permanent means "violent, not. lasting." This agrees with the words "in blood" a state of light; beodeduess rat Iter limn hot kendedness, however, as. terse! v put afterwards by' Poloniu?, "I do not know where the blood burns . . . those blazes daughter you mufel not take for fire." "A' -violet iii the youth of primy nature" is nothing more than a violet in the early . days, of the spring,, and thus transient— analogous to trifling. Shakspeare also uses prime as the synonym fur the height of per fection, aud reiercnce . to Fansh Lusiad (v, 15), -'And inal-iug two aumnici-3, autumns, winters primes," also &ho;\vs its general application. Re- garding Laertes's reference. lo "thews nnd hulk," this applies more to a.inan Uiaa u youth;, liardcn- ing and thickrniiigf| iit\'.sc3c: flue w. ileuqtc - change of grtfwth,- coming .ryther after thun be- !orc :;0. .Fa!slafr.says:i(p.-270; i Hen. IV;, act III.,' sc. 2), "Care thee,; for the limb, the thewes, the stnturo, biilk. arid 'big . assemblunce of a man." "Crows wide" and "waxing" could only then mean -putting on more flesh, which is so closely allied to the "He's fat" phrase, that I now touch on it. Of course this remark of the queen's may uctualiy apply to Laertes, not Hamlet, but admitting tlie latter is referred to it would but be a logical result of his studious habit if he did nut on flesh, especially as he "walks four hours" some days, has ..- his; - "hrcathiag times," and is in continual; pouHice";; and in his famous, speech, talks >oF.-his <too/ -too solid. flesh" as if lie had, a, tendency to corpulency, wliich onlv ins coniinuai exercise kept down. .Still the word fat need not Imply a Falsiafi's gross- ncss, and may mean being a little out of training, thus leading up to ;the.. . realistic mole of Shak?pcare's that the wiih' foils niake3 llanilet sweat,' as he is that way.iheliricd/ Or,'ngain, "fat" may iriiply "dull " as elsewhere rused by Shakspeare. IVhllc with re gard to. the Burbadge story, in the elegy on that' actor great-praise is given to liiih for .equal success rored in the parts of Young Hamlet and Old Hieronymo, showing that, at all events, But- badge was considered to look "youngV enough (c.) Ihimlet's mother sliould lie still youn" enough -to love and be' lovctJ. Well, eo 'H seems! was the Player, Quoc-n (who stands for Gertrude) and adnntttcdly 30 years married, and not then too old to win a second husband's lore. And it is surely seen (1.1., G3, 83, Act. III., sc. 4) that Ger trude is meant lo be. a iniddlc' aged matron. Yet what of that? It is your mature woman who cap- tjyalei«, and Claudius after all speaks of "myrrown my own ambition, ' arid niy queen," in list of tho52'Cffects fi»r,which I:diil tbe murder," so that his. wife apparently conies hist in liis estimation, being ; but .a. means to an. end. ' Hainlet!s reference- to his mother's love for his father— "he. would hang .on him as if. increase of 'appetite had- crown by., what at fed . ,ou"; . (1.1. H3;. act I., sc 1) . cluHeugcs comparison with the lines from Antony ' and Clcdpatm" net I!., sc. 2)— "Otlier wqnu-n., ch»y , the,, -appetites /«' "u a,je makes hungry where most she satisfies, and the well known tribute . to Cleo patra s powers of fascinutiou — "Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale .her infinite -variety. M- So Gertrude could well have a sun of CO, aud yet love and be. loved. - (d.) Ifamlet, if 30, would then be on the thrjue, but Hamlet (1. 05, act' V., sc. 2) speaks of Claudius having "popp'd in between the election and my hopes,", showing Hamlet, at any rate, was old enough to have been elected. For Stoevens, Blackstonc,. Weriler, Klze, Allen and othere prove Denmark was an elective monarchy. Doubtle?, tlie reigning monarch bad "a voice" in favor orlps successor, but that had to be ratified by the "main voice" of Denriiarlc. llanilet the elder, being .suddenly murdered, could not name his son. Gertrude then helped Claudius instead, who proved too much for llanilet, and In liis opening speech (act I., sc. 2) lie thanks his supporters for his success. Hamlet also thinks himself old enough to give. Fortinbraa his "dying voice" for Fortinbras's election.. Other reasons keening Hamlet from the throrie are his .lack of ambition, and the flckto na ture-. of<tIie -popular vote,-" as witness tlie people clamoring for Laertes as king. Thus, I Isold that Hainlct is clearly shown to be fully 30.— Yours, fee.. E. WILSON DOBBS. _"Uarisruh e. ' ' Jackson-street Toorak, 4th May.
