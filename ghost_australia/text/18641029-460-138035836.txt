POETRY. : HAUNTED CHAMBER.

Gllmjaee of time funny planes . Seared tony childhood mirth; Of thefcotttaataed, oMand mcrnj, dose Vralflo U» meadow green. Where the brook*, like thread* of direr, Wound their grsoeful curve between. And It la a haunted chamber. There Die ghost* at midnight stray, Silent as the ston that wander Down tho wblte-par'd Milky Way. Ton behold the light fbrmi trembling \- In their pare robot liko a bride, And they look to much like living Tot forget that the; hare died— Ton forget the marble feature* Of the friend you laid at rest— Tot forget the pale hands folded On a pulseless, soulless breast But you ace him slowly walking 'Mid the stow life's sunset wrfmw, When his lips drupp'd farewell blessings, And the trees their eutanrn leave*. Thai comes he long sinee deported, Beaching out hu hand to thins, And his lip* unto thee murmur In a tone that eeeais divine In this chamber stands a mirror, Memory's lamp hangs overheard. Throwing down a ttoftru'd radianeu On these pictures of the dead. In its clear depths we distinguish What wo wexi, and what we ore. There our inner life, reflected, Shows us hideous or fair. Oh! 'tis in this secM chamber Tliol we learn a wdemn truth, As in links of spirit union Age is joined again with youth.
