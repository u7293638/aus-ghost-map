MUSICAL AND DRAMATIC NOTES. . Our London correspondent writes under date 12th October -" The Haymarket Theatre reopened on Monday -with ' A Bunch of Violets,' the drama which was so successful in the regular season. It is becoming rather the fashion, when a house opens early in the season, for theatrical managers not to begin with a novelty, but to wait until things have developed a little before showing their hand I hear that some time next month Mr Beerbohm Tree is to produce a new play with Mrs Patrick, Campbell in the loading sale A new and very much improved version of ' Mirotto has been produced at the Savoy But speaking generally the week has not been productive in the way of theatrical novelties In what is sometimes called the ' Music Hall World, however, a great flutter has been caused by the action of the County Council in regard to the licences It is quite evident that the council have not abandoned their determination to purify those places of amusement, and they have a good deal of popular feeling behind them, especially in the working class districts Indeed, it is a remarkable fact that the entertainment provided at the halls which cater directly for the working classes is almost invariably of a harmless description, contrasting very favourably in this respect with that given at some of the West End places of amusement Dio great attraction in the large music halls of Leicester-square to a large class of shady visitors is the promenade, which, it need hardly be said, does not exist for people who really want to see the performance The County Council have now ordered the Empire, the most luxurious of all the music halls, to do away with the promenade, as well as to cease selling drink in the auditorium, on pain of forfeiting the license This is a terrible blow to the traditions of the music hall But I am glad to think that public taste is reforming itself without the assistance of the County Council The hall in the West End which used to have the worst reputation of all has had in the last few months to close its doors for want of customers, and is to no turned into a restaurant The time is probably not far off when the condition of the streets of London at night will cease to be the crying scandal they are at present " Amateurs of music will be interested to hear of the marriage of Signora Link, who forwards a formal announcement of the event to " Musical and Dramatic Notes " When the esteemed artiste left Sydney in the middle of February, 1890, she oppressed much weariness of spirit over the routine of professional work Signora Link's plans at that time were to visit the Chicago Exhibition and the rails of Niagara, to spend a few months in Germany, and then to settle in New York, where she was sure of getting operatic and concert engagements sufficient to free her from the trammels of daily touching Signora Link, whose Australian operatic career as a dramatic soprano was particularly brilliant, has now decided to retire from the Tyne stain upon her marriage with Mr William A Harney, of Brooklyn The ceremony was performed by the Rev. J S Brazen, of Christ s Lutheran Church, New York, on Wednesday, 20th August, 1891 Doubt- less many wishes for the happiness of the bride will reach her from Australia The latest Italian papers state that Eleanora Duse has in view a tour in Australia, and that she will bring with her Cesare Rossi, a fine actor, and son of one still more famous, as well is Rosaspina and Cantinelli, both well- known artists Signora Duse, unlike Riston, who was at her best in tragedy and in historical parts, is a great comedy actress, so that her greatest successes have been as the vivacious Innkeeper, pestered by four suitors ("La Locondiera"), and as " Nora," the title under which she plays Ibsen's A Doll's House " Signora Duso's scope also embraces "La Dame aux Camelias " and other dramas, in which Mme Bernhardt and various English actresses have appeared in Australia, so that the fact that she plays in Italian should prove no hindrance to the success of the venture It is not often that a singer as yet unknown in English concert-rooms has a song composed ex- pressed for her as the result of a private trial Yet this was Miss Ada Crossley's last experience in London before she left for Paris during the first week in October Mr Ascherberg, the well known music publisher, who takes a great interest in the Australian contralto, lately invited her to sing again before a distinguished company, with the result that Mr Michael Bergson composer of Life's Crown," "It Ritorno," " Rondo Valso," " Soremido Moresque," and other pieces, which have enjoyed some vogue in London, composed for her a new ballad, entitled " Midnight Chimes " The new song the words of which are by Maria Hayes, ranges from 6 below the lines to E flat, bears n dedicated to Miss Crossley, with a profile portrait The proofs had just been submitted to Miss Crossley when she started for the Marchesi Academy Miss Olga Nethersole opened her New York season at Palmer's Theatre on 15th October with "The Transgressor," long Ucr repertoire includes "Camille," "Carmen," "Romeo and Juliet" and " Denise " Mr. Louis I >>ether6olo (her brother) accompanied her as manager, whilst Mr Marcus Mayer watches Mr Augustin Daly's interests Her company includes the English actor T H Barnes as well as Wilton Lacknye, E M Holland, Ida Conquest, and Mrs D P Bowers The NX T)> native T/in or states that " Miss Nethersole imperious manner and supercilious airs have been subject for comment on the Rialto ever since she reached New York, and now, it appears this foreigner objects to some of the actors as too Vnioricnn " This account of Miss îiothcrsolo's behaviour will not be readily accepted in Australia where the English actress made a distinctly favourable impression by her affability and tact in social life Mr E E Rice, who had some narrow and experiences in Australia but the latter end of the " Evnngehno " tour at once dropped on his feet in America, where he is now managing " Little Christopher Columbus " with Mr A M Palmer He has just secured Mr George Walton to play the part of the private detective in that burlesque, and had sent to London for Billie B love to play the name part Miss B irlow who used to be a great favourite at the N 1 Casino, was, however, unable to accept the engagement In a farewell speech at the close of the comedy season at the Adel aide Theatre Royal on room ber 10, Mr Robert Brough, referring to the absence of his partner in England, said that he looked forward to Mr Boucicault's return with the nucleus of a new company next August Mr and Mrs Brough are themselves going to London
