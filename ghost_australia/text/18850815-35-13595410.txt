Botany Bay; or. Tales of Early Australia. By JOHN LANG, Barrister-at-Law. If we are not mistaken, Mr. Lang was the author of a story which may yet be remembered by many readers, entitled " Too Clever by Half," and which is still, we notice, obtainable at the railway stalls. The stories comprising the present volume are reprinted from " Household Words " and the " Welcome Guest." We ourselves distinctly remember reading some of them years ago in the former magazine, more especially " Fisher's Ghost." These are really good stories, penned by an Australian-born, and founded in great part upon fact. One of the best is that entitled " Giles! As I Live." It is rather a wonder that Mr. Lang has been so long in collecting and re- publishing these early tales of his, for their intrinsic interest must become less and less for the general public, as the years go on, and those old colonial days fade farther and farther out of memory. The story of " Fisher's Ghost," however, will probably last a long time yet. It is wonderful how widely known that curious piece of supernaturalism is. We were once a good deal surprised, and not a little amused, to hear the narrative gravely related by an English tourist in Switzerland to an eagerly attentive group in the veran- dah of one of the highest hotels in that country. We had last heard it fourteen thousand miles away. Mr. Lang tells it well.
