THE DEAD LOVER. ' The streets of the little mining town, with ( t!eir stet-p.sidewalks of flights of steps and in- . din. d plains, were blight »jtb lights and gay with pi 'pie. There wjs to be an old folks con cert «t ibe'ball, an-1 the young people who were ** -.?4--ii^ta In thf-it* ntiflinfc MMtnmCS 01 : brocade »i.d Iao, had. congregated, with much fun and laughter, in tlie parlour of the one hotel, awaiting the time when they were to make their tntiancc to tbe concert-rcom. the men from one side and thtt womtn from the other, iu the way of days'gooe by. The enter Uinment was to close with a dance, the did folks b ing in coiitumc. Tbe girl* were flitting about the room, now pausing before the mirror to touch a powdered lock or to glance at a velvet train. Tbe young men, locking at first rather self-conscieus in meir UD'CCIUWaiCU CIUUIO, wo ou& bv-», ruffled shirts, and short breeches, joined the mutual admiration society, and all was lively ' with jt.kes and laughter and small rehearsals. A pretty girl 'ith fluffy yellow hair and a white drew brocaded with silver was flitting about among the groups, enquiring — ' Where's Tom ? Have you seen Tom F I do want to try our duet.' '? Lost Tom, Miss Aniy ? ' laughed Harry Hastings. ' I declare you should take better care of your property than* that.' ' How do you know he i* my property V ' Oh. a tittle bird told me. Now see here : if you'll promUti me tbe second waltz to- night : I'll go and look up the old' fellow fur you. Si ra him since he ?lre»eti ? He ought to have lived ; in George WasLington's time, be looks so well j in those slothis.' j Tbe girl blushed aud promised, and Harry started - n l.in quest. There was some confu sion and quite a little crowd about a door further du*ra the hall, and as Hastings paused, ! Ti ra McLaujzhlin came trom tho loom beyond. j He was a very handsome yuung man, though his face nuiv looked white and sol-uiu. '? I lay. Ul boy, wiiat's tho row ?' tbe other ! called. 'You're wanted by a certaiu lady. I Why, you lojk rs if you had reen a ghost.' i '* 1 have ieen a man die.*' j ' Patterson ?' i i ' Yes.' ! ' Well,- that's rough. ' Consumplian, wasn't it? ' Yes.' said. Tom, briefly. He made a n.otion to go in tlio opposite direc tion from the parlour. Hastings attained him. ' Amy wants you.' ' ?' Tell her I'll be there presently.' ' Well, don't be long ; we are going over to the halt very soon.' Tom went up ta his room. Tbe scene be had jast parsed through had put him oot of tune with the gay doings about bim. He- could still see the set ryes and quivering chin of the man who had died, and he, too, was young. When he went down to the parlour Amy was ; there slone, and decidedly cross. ' I think it's too provoking of you, Tom ! ' she pouted, fluttering her silver and white plumage. ' They're all gone-orer, and there isn't time to try our duet. Where have you neen ? ' ' With pour Patterson : he has just died.' ' Oh, how dreadful '. But I don't see what made you go a visiting sick folk on tbe night of our concert,' she said pettishly. The young man looked it her in surprise. ' Don't be cross, dear,' he said. ' Tbis thing has about u'pset me.' Ha was fastening bcr cloak, and she- made an impatient movement. ' I used to drop in to see bim every evening. The poor fellow was a stranger bere, and lone some. He came for his health. It cheered him op; be said, to hear what was going on,- so to night I went in to let bim seo me in 'these things : I thought it might amuse him : but I found him just going.' ,«? Fearful! But Tom, we must huiry ; they'll be waiting for us.' ** One moment, Amy. I want to ask you something. The poor fellow who died was expecting his E,irl to-night in the midnight train. He sent for her ; think what a shock It will be to her when she comes ! Would you mind if 1 went up to the station to meet her and try to make it a little easier ?' 'Mind! I nutre I should! Any eW would ! Why, it -ill be juat supper time, and I don't want to be left without a partner.' ' I could get someone;--' ?? I don't want anybody but you. I don't believe that girl is much, coroins hen alone to see him.' ' Would yoa not do it for me, Amy P' ' Don't go asking horrid questions ! llamma wbnUn't think of letting me.' 'This poor girl hasn't any relations. She works in an office. Patterson told me. He. thought everything of her. I don't sea how yoa can help being sorry for her !' ' Oh. I am 1 Now Tom. don't be dis. agreeable !' panting. '? Come. We must go !' Tom sighed, and they went out into, the snowy street. H« could not feel in touch with the gaiety. He found himself conl'rouaUj thinking of that young life just gonoi/of' the young girl journeying on in hope to find despair. Something crept into his tenor solo that niiht which made people say. « I didn't know Tom HcLaughlin could alorlike that : it f«i,l» _?. j. me cry.' Amy had recovered her toud nature She laughed and danced aod flitted about like a fairy. ' Too took her to supper and roused himsalf to join in the gay talk.
