toumoiv Wliitfcier's Impro&aMe; Stories. MB. WHITTIES laughed heartily on .being told that a good Deacon of Hampton Town, who looked with disgust upon works@f the imagination, didn't believe a word of his poem ontitled "The Old Wife and the New," ia which he has so ingeniously incorporated the famous ghost story and that of the haunted house at Hampton, and proceeded to give further particulars of the episode relating to the sale of the soul of Gen. Jonathan Moultun to his Satanic Majesty for as much gold as the Evil One could pour- down the chimney-into the General's boot. The General, a true specimen of the shrewd, money-making New England Yankee, cut tha leg from the boot, and so the devil had rather a hard bargain oi it, as he nearly fitted the room with gold before he found out the deception practiced on him by the unscrupulous hero of the Revolution.â€” Letter in Lawrence (Mass) American.
