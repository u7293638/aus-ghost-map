Iredalo'wero standing to» jjrther, watching tho moving throng , ( v\vith considerable amusement?— 'always of course, oxeopting Mr. i t Sauch'e/, By tho way, I tised to * i think at one time that, ho stood n ^ yery good chance' of \viuuing Miss \ \Druminond, but 1 am inclined to i think that he.La^ 'transferred hi» affections to Miss Jphristoho.' \J( '' '.Miss Johustono !' repeated , Dr. liedalo. 'I think you must ^ ?? bo mistaken. I thinly to bo candid, that Mr. 'Sanchez is too fond of. * monoy to' marry a pouniless girl 1 ' * l ' Well, perhaps the quostion of ', marriago has not \ boon lnootod as \ v jet, but there is a tendvesao there! '/, .'am quito convinced,' she insisted. ( r\ \^ Miss Johns tono is sweetly pretty, ' ?- m a Bontimoutal way, so perhaps () s Mr. Sauohez is too .much in lovo \ to reflect upon tho indiscretion of 1 Mmarrying a . dowerloss girl. How irmoli better Miss Drummond is ldoliing ; almost her old, cheerful s ' self ! ' 'remarked Mrs. Frazer, 1 S watching '^ Violet's graceful figure ) '^ and\ mobile, smiling face as she \ ( t promenaded tho rooms, leaning )/ ' upon Colonel timer's arm. ''Poor \\\ , ( child! The .death of poor, ybunf1 1 \, ' (jJranbouvuo has saddened her life, 1 at least for a i time ; but I hope N there ai'Q happier days in store for 1 ,:W f V .; 1 , [ N' I hope so,' said Dr. Iredale, , ' , gravely. . ' She is very young, and has all the world, before her. I think I am engaged to her for the . ^ next dance,' ho said, bowing and 1 moving off towards whero he ,saw ♦ ''' Violet chatting merrily to her host, ^ at tho entrance to the conservatory. ' ' Shall wo sit out this dance P' 0 '-he asked, when Colonel Frazer had V left them together. ' You are a \ little tired. I can see, and the atmo ^ sphere of this veritable winter \ garden is exquisitely balmy and refieshing.' '*! l Violet acquiesced dreamily. A senso of rest and happiness had stolen over her under the influence ,, of his gallantry aud tenderness j and y k as she accorapaujed him into the 1 conservatory, whero tho Beduotivo !(v sounds of the musio reached them 1 - faintly, she felt the irresistible 1 charm of his mellow, refined voice, k i\ ' and the touch of his hand upon vy - her arm awoko a sentiment which . , ^ ' she believed had died with poor i * Dick Oranbourno. u u , They wandered down tho dimly t \ ' lighted aisles, which w'ero deserted ?' - ' now; tho majestic camellias, and , lofty, tropical ferns, towering above ' '^ , their heads, and the plash, of ,tho « , ? 'little fountains sounding musically ?- 'in'their ears,' : ? ? 'Violet.Ihavo brought you here I ' 'to tell you something,' said. Dr. ' \ Iredalo, drawing tho girl down . ({\ upon a rustic seat ; ' something which is very near my heart;' ?fy Ho paused, and 'looked down at j her as aho sat beside him, her hauds loosely olaspe'd, her graceful head v. bent. She did not speak but he saw that she had grown very pale, r i and her lips quivered. v , ' 'I think you must have guessed, Violot, how dearly I lovo you,' ho '?? said gently. 'Without you my 1 lifo would b eompty of happiness, for my every hope and ambition is centred in you. Am I wrong in ^ , thinking it possible you may not bo . ^uito indifferent to mo P' he asked taking hor hand, persuasively. *Toll mo, dearest, will you try 1 ' Jomo day to lovo me — not just yet, , perhaps . I will not bo impatient, \- hut some day ?' 'I liko you now, very— very k ( much,' slio said, turning to him ou April face, upon which tears and smiles contended. \- t) - She looked bo sweot and childish ^ '\ with hor largo, wistful eyes raised ? , i to his, that ho acted upon tho im / ' pulso of the moment, and elapsed * ier in his arms, s u My darling, my little love !' [ ' he whispered passionately. ' Lot I 1 mo teach you how to love again ; -i\ let mo choriah, protect, and idolise ^ou, until I have won you over to ,.;| (ivemcall your heart. ' I— I think you havo it now !*' J. »ho whispered, ' lotting him hold 1 - , \ her still close to his breast. i { ^ She felt just then that thoro was iothing in tho world so sweot as \'- Uio knowledge that sho was secure f , of John Iredalo' s lovo. Ho was so '-ti ' brave, clever, good; there was no ' ' ' ?- one liko him, sho thought, in all tho wide world. She knew now that her lovo for ' v poor Dick had boon a shadowy, 1 ^ imperfect sentiment, as compared \ with tho depth, strength, and i lubtloty of her lovo for Dr. Iredale. They stood thus for a moment or two, lost in a blissful dream of lovo ?from which Violot was ths first to A x fcwakon. ^ J .Drawing herself away from him % ^ ' smth a sudden faint cry of constor ( , ?' cation, sho stood looking past him , , into the darkness wit]), a wile fear '- [ s inhorfaco— a startled terror, as i(v,v though sho had seen a ghost. ' '' '.'Violet, darling, what is tho ',( matter?' cried Dr. Irodale, essay. VS. ing to takohor hand} but sho 1 pushed him away from her, and 11 ' (4 murmured faintly': , . I f (To bo continued.)
