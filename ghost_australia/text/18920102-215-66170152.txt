A Night With a Ghost. Otto Schiller is an aged German shoemaker, who fought in the Franco Prussian war. Otto has always been afraid of ghosts, and a short time ago, when asked to give his reason for be ing afraid, told the following story: Near the close of the Franco-Prus sain war, and while two opposing ar mies were facing each other, a battle expected the following day, a Prussian sentry was found asleep at his poest one night. Next day there was no battle, but a hasty !court-martial tried the sentry, and condemned him to be shot at sunrise the following morning. Schiller was one of the squad detailed for the execution. The hapless sentry fell dead at the first .volley from the firing party. The night fcllowing the execution Schiller was on picket duty and found himso'f on the post where the man he helped to kill had been found asleep. At first he thought nothing of the strange coincidence, but toward mid night a feeling of dread came over him, and would not be shaken off. Just at 12 o'clock Schiller says he saw a so!dior with a musket on his shoulder wa!kin?r straight toward him on the picketo ine. lie thought it was tlhe oflicer of the guard, but as the figure came nearer he saw the face of the man shot that morning. Schillor says the blood in his veins ee:ncd to turn to ice; he was unable to mlltvo hand or foot, and could not utter a sound. The ghost of the dead sentry p'qa?ed. within two feet of him, walked or0 to the end of the beoat, turned with military precision and retraced his slea:s. Back and furth along the bent tihe ghostly sentry c.n'tinued to walk until near the break of day, when it comctdl to vaunih in the air. The eyes of the ghost were closed as if in sleep, but it. musket was at a "shoulder arzm," and it walked the beat with :eg'n:ar ruiitary tread. Next day the i'P'us:it aury a.dvanced, and Schiller di I no0 Fee :hlc sentry again, but the has ever sinco been a firm believer in IoUUks.
