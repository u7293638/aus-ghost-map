SBL~E~OTi P.OETZTR. Â· THEB OUSE OF 'DEATH. BT Mnr. IOOLTOU. Not a hand has lifted the latchet Sinco she went out of the door- No footstep shall cross the threshold Since she can come in no more. There is rast upon locks and hingee, And mould and blight on the walls, And silence faints in the chambers, And darkness waits in the halle- Waits ano all things have waited Since she wont, that day of spring Borne in her pallid splenour To dwell in the COuurr of the King: With lilies on brow and bosom, With robes of silken sheen, And her wonderful frozen beauty And lilies and silk between. Bed roses she left hbhind her, But they died long, long agoe 'Twas the odorous ghost of a blossom That seemed through the dusk to glow. The garments she left mock the shadows With hints of womanly grace, And her image swims in the mirror That was so used to her lace. The birds make insolent musio Whe'e the sunshine rio's outside, And the winds are merry and wanton With the summer's pomp and pride. But into this desolate mansion, Where Love has closed the door, Nor nunshino nor summer shall enter, Sicco she can come in no more.
