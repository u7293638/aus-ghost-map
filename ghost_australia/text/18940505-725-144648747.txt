OUR SYDNEY. LETTER, (From oqr own Correspondent.) .EpB some time past we have been gravely jfl$Bured that the single tex is dead, that It ^B'ionly advocated by a few faddists whoBGt Tiumbera are becoming smaller every day vend much more equally accurate and to the purpose. Iam not a eingle taxer- myself, but tbe idea of the single tax embodies a great trqth which no Qivilised state can long continue to neglect with impunity^ To allow the unearned increment in the value of land to be r monopolised' by inaiviauais is to set a premium on astute-. nesB and cunning to penalise indusVy 'an4 enterprise. ' It foregoes the revenue which is produced, and . renders it beoesssry ta levy revenue by tsxes which hamper pro|i jjUioiion and commerce. .. r The fund whicli the iactivities and enter prise of the people of:New South Wales, have created that whiph is. measured by position vain©' jof theland^ of the colony as distinct from the value of tbe improves ments oil them^is'for th^^pioBt part being spent by absentees in other countries.

However, whether the single tax tepee-, seats a dead eause or a living one, t think that nearly all classes are' agreed that it is a shameful injustioe that of all classes in the oolonly tho speculative and non-improving landowners- Bhoold escape taxation altogehter.

But I feel cer tain that they can only be sa.ed from what they fear at the cost of keeping the rest of the popultion in the miseries which they -are at present experiencing, and I doubt very much whether they will be trilling lo experience them much longer. This is a cape iu whioh justice bb well as voting power is on tbe side of advanc ing reform. The most effective tactics of tbe l&pd; monopolists have hitherto been fonnd in silence. They harenoldefended their position by argument or rhetoric but they have ( quietly diverted taxation in other directions. It is notorious that free trade members of the Legislative Council, forjnst&oce;, voted for protection because they knew that if Iher.refccted it a Jand. tax'wblild follow, llieir establishment of & league is a distinct step in. advance. It shows that they are being forced out into the open, that the subterfuges by which they hAve been enabled to shirk their fm'r share of taxation in the past Are failing them, and that they are at last compelled to make some attempt to justify their poti* tion. They are brought to the bar of public opinion and find themselves com pelled to plead. The more thoroughly their case is set forth (he more untenable it will be eeen to be, and the more promptly will judgment be entered against them. The manner in which Australian quali fied medicA) men suffer from the competi tion of those who are legally . unqualified has often been set forth in inoviug tetms. Commissions under the direction of the legally qualified section have published blue bookB of evidence intended to sink the legally unqualified out of existence. Pot still they live and flourish, and out of sheer perversity, I -suppose, the death rate ?of the colony persiBts in remaiuing low, notwithstanding the general preference for the ' unqualified' Short as against the *' qualified' Codlin. But as the difference between qualified and unqualified often meaos tbe difference between the posses* Won of a piece -of parohment without skill jn healing and the possession of skill in healing without a piece of parchment, per haps it is not so formidable as it seemB. At any rata a commission appointed to enquire into tbe doings of legally qualified practitioners would soon be able to pile up a sensational record. Here is a bit of evidence from a New Zealand paper. A woman died after two days of tarrible suffering. Her friends had endeavored to obtain medical Assist ance for her, but in vain. One doctor declined to attend without having his fee paid io advance ; another objected to meet at the bedside a member of thp profession with whom he had some misunderstanding and a third was unprovided with Unneces sary instruments to deal with the case J So after days of fruitless agony the poor froman passed aw Ay ! Thus does humanity suffer at the bands of fives© rinprlgpipled unqualified practi tioners— I beg pardon, I had fallen into the regular ''hack' line of the daily papers. These practitioner^ one aod all, appear to have been duly and legally qualified. The inoideut, like others whioh. are occurring every day, show that the : j)08Bession of a . diploma by no means -SiempU the holder Irom some of the worst /ailiugs of:degenerale humanity. The folly of giving to eiiy cIhbs supreme power over ths health and liberty of the people be comes more evident every day,, A fair £eld and no favor, the medical profession,' like every other profession, is entitled to. But when they seek more than that they 'become pro tanto enemies of thepepple, ' Hospital Saturday proved a great sue- ?' cess. ' The wives and daughters of the .wealthy cIasssb,. and of the olasBeB which : are not wealthy, turned out in force to collect. They, raised pearly L2Q0Q, and what is perhaps of more importance they .raised their estimate of the ordinary ple beian crowd, from whom jhey solicited donations. Perlmpa also thtJ 'reverse is true and the plebeians, so widely separated in rank and station from the fair. oolleo-ors, may have been gratified to be able to ob serre for themeolres that these fortunate young persons possessed both human ^ympathies-nd humon foibles.
