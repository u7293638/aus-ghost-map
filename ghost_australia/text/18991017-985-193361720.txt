Corpse at a Wedding. The Leader's Vancouver corres- ] pond en t forwards a grisly adven i ture whicb reads like a piece of wes^prn newspaper fiction, as per haps it is. Miss Maud Cranston, ^ who resides on Kootenay Lake, in â– the far eastern part of British Columbia, set out' along with her intended husband, J. A. Carson, and her relatives, on board the steamer Klondyke, for Bonner's ferry, in the adjoining State of Idaho, there to get married. As the boat passed the house of the preacher who had originally undertaken to perform the ceremony, but had failed to put in an appearance, they saw the reverend gentleman a prisoner on the roof of his submerged residence. The valley had become flooded by sudden rise of the river. The parson was rescued and taken aboard. Whilst be was changing his wet clothes the steamer made a at Rices landing, where came abbard with a rough pine coffin containing the remains of James Carter, who bad been drowned in the river the day before. When the parson came on deck in dry clothes the-young couple said they would have the marriage take place there and then. The ceremony had proceeded al ^ most to the point where the clergy man would declare them man and wife, when two dogs, which began to fight, upset the flimsy pine coffin, the fail breaking it open. One glance at the dead man's features and the bride gave a scream and swooued away in the arms of the /jgfoom. The corpse was that of a former lover to whom she had been engaged to be marriedL When she . recovered, however, she decided to i proceed with the ceremony, declar ! ing that neither ghosts nor corpses f should prevent her from becoming Mrs. Carson.
