THE BENDiaO GHOST SCARE. AMATEUR DETECTIVE ARRESTED. The ghost scare, which has been the local sensation of the past week, has led to a youth named Eugene George Johnson being placed in an awkward predicament to-night, sayB tbe Bendigo correspondent of tbe A rgu * on Tuesday. Johnson's mother had been frightened, and, imbued with a desire to nrevent a rendition, he sallied forth after dark attired in an old dress and armed with [ an iron bar, prepared to lure the inasquerader | into showing himself. Johnson's appearance attracted attention, and someone, apparently with little sympathy for his mission, handed him over to the police, and be was locked up on a charge of behaving in an insulting manner. He was shortly afterwards bailed out. Tbere was an extraordinary scene outside tbe city watchbouse during Johnson's deten tion, large crowds of people having ruBhed from all quarters, under tbe belief that the ' ghost ' bad been caught. Though tbe proceedings of the last night or two should have effectually stopped tbe offender, the scare still continues, and tbe pollcc are keeping a close watch.
