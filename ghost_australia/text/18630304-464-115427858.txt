' v-'1 , Since, my, last,; the remains ' ot , the urifbrtunat| Chinaman was found, a considerable ^distance dbwn jjhe,1 river. , A magisterial inquiry .was held b} James. Buchanan,' Esq.,.

' ' i I have observed in your issue of .the 18th that the great Hoskins, of alpaca notoriety, has taken a paltry billet on the roads.' Who would have tho.ught the great aspirant to the omce oi minister for Lands should fall so low ? Indeed, it would be little harm should a few more of his stamp be re* moved from the .Parliament of this splendid country. I hope this will be a warning to the independent miners on the Northern Gold fields, than/whom a more iridependent class of men a! e not to be found in the colony. Their last member sold them J may their next serve them honestly. .' Haying visited the Rocky River lately, a very strong feeling existed in favour of Mr. Buchanan, late'Chief Gold Commissioner in the North, being elected, even in opposition to Hoskins, who, it ap pears, has boasted he carries the coristituericy in his pocket. My impression, and the opinion of many miners— it was a dread of being defeated at the next general election caused James to solicit from the Hon.lJohn, with a promise of handing over the seat to a nominee of Cbwperarid Co.:a3 a quid pro quo. If such is the case, they have made a bud bargain ; for assuredly no nominee of their's 'stands a ghost of1 a chance: instance James Husband, late for' Armidale. Are there any more berths vacant on the roads? as I would strongly urge the claims of Doigleish, Wilson; and Co. for consideration. The country looks beautiful ; in fact, we have sufficient to ensure plenty of 'feed for stock during the Winter months; ???'- ; ???-.?? Your mournful extracts of Irish history are read with great avidity.
