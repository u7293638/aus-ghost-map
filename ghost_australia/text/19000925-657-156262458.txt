Jack the Ripper Dead. Jack the Ripper is dead. He died (says the Paris Figaro) in a private lunatic asylum in England unknown to the majority of the public, but his identity was fully established some time before his death. He was a medical student of good family and considerable means, and there is no reason to suppose that when his family first put him under forcible restraint, they had any idea that he was the author of the Whitechapel horrors. Two prominent journalists, G. R. Sims and T. P. O'Connor, M P., are among the few who know the facts of the case. The whole matter has been kept very dark as it was felt that no good end would be served by re- opening the case. Tho police authori- ties, however, were aware of the cir- cumstances and undoubtedly felt relieved when this human fiend gave up the ghost. Stoke Orphanage Scandal â€” As an outcome of the recent disclosures before the Royal Commission con- cerning the management of Stoke Industrial School, a Roman Catholic institution, two Marist Brothers con- nected with the control of the school made their appearance at Nelson (N.Z.) Police Court on Thursday. James Sloan, known in religion as 'Brother Kilian,' was charged under the criminal code with six common assaults on inmates of the School Against Edward Ferrior, known in religion as 'Brother Wybertus,' there are five charges of common assault and five of indecent assault. Counsel explained that the details of the other charges were revolting, but he would postpone calling evidence till the conclusion of the cases now under consideration. A later wire states that after the magisterial inquiry, Brothers Kilian and Wybertus, of the Marist Brotherhood, formerly of Stoke Orphanage, were committed for trial on the charges of common assault. The hearing of the graver charges has not yet concluded.
