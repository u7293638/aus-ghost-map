THE SIN OF OMIBSION. IT isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing yon leave undone Which gives you a bit of a heartache At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower youen might have sent, dear, Are yeaor haunting ghosts to-night The stone youn might have lifted Ont of a brother's way, The bit of heartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That you had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kiodness, So easily out of mind, These chances to bh angels Which even mortals find They come in night and silence, Each chill, reproachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compasnion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's tbhe thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache, At the setting of the sun.
