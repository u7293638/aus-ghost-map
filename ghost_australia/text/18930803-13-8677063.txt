NEWS BY THE MAIL. ' TOPICS OF THE WEEK. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, JUNE 30. The controversies on the Home Rule Hill time taken a new turn The Radicals and their Irish friends have at length move I Mr Gladstone to adopt measures for forcing the Home Rule Bill through the House, and we are now in the middle of a hot debate as to the application of what is known as " the telescope closure Briefly explained, the system is to divide the bill into sections and to order that so many clauses shall be passed by a certain day and so many by a Inter day, until the bill shall be through committee It is an American dodge, which was perfected during the debates in Congress on the M Kirley tariff In a reckless moment Mr Chamberlain recommended it to our notice in the pages of the Nineteenth Century, though he explained last night that he never meant that it should be applied on the motion of a Government or of a single Minister of the Crown He would have applied it by general acquiescence first ob- tamed in a tolerably large committee, which presumably would have been elected by the whole House of Commons and would have been representative of all the sections Finding the scheme put forward by Mr. Chamberlain, the Government, no doubt thought they would have ample excuse for using it The desire to hoist the engineer with his own petard must have been grateful to them And then, of course, there was the precedent of Mr. W. H. Smith, who forced through committee the famous Crimes Act of 1860 on five days' notice previously given Taken together these were promising baits, and as Mr Gladstone could no longer resist the pressure which was put upon him by his supporters he fell a victim to them I say a victim advisedly At the time of writing it is by no means certain what will be the result of the discussion now going forward in the House There are some Gladstonians not Radicals who have a bit of conscience left, and we hear that the Redmondites are by no means sure to vote for the telescope closure But in any case supposing the closure as proposed is adopted it will be fatal not only to Mr Gladstone's reputation as a great member of Parliament, but also (and this may concern him more to the bill which is thus to be forced through the House of Commons the Opposition have determined that they will not alter their policy Such amendments as have been put on the paper will be debated at such leisure as is thought desirable, and if the closure shuts out important matters as it must- all the worse for the closure and its authors A better excuse for the rejection of the bill could not be afforded to the House of Lords It is impossible that they can allow to pass a measure which has not been fully debated in the Lower Chamber, and which has never been before the constituencies many detail Mr Gladstone knows this well enough in his inmost heart, and we can well believe what he said yesterday that he made the motion for closure " with pain But he is not his own master 'I he tail has again wagged the dog, as it always does when Mr Gladstone is in office The Radicals were probably more urgent than the Irish The former are sick of the Home Rule Bill, and they saw the session passing without a ghost of a chance of carrying this or any other measure Unless something were done the session must be hopelessly barren Certainly the prospect was not lively, but if the Radicals could have restrained their impatience it would have paid them best. 'J lie> are already committed to a sitting which is likely to extend into September, and to he renewed in October, with the prospect of going on until Christmas Tor Mr Gladstone has announced formally and precisely that he means to have the Home Rule Bill and the whole of Supply previous to the holidays, and that afterwards he will proceed with his " British measures ' 'J his means that in the autumn sitting, some time between October and Christmas the Parish Councils Bill, the Employers Liability Bill, and others matters are to be undertaken Now nobody would have been worse off if these latter had been postponed to next year and if the debates on the Home Rule Bill had been allowed to go on quietly to the end Every body agrees that they would have been over by the middle of September or thereabouts and supply would have been wound up very rapidly afterwards, so that there would have been a decently long recess in which members could have rested and recuperated But above and beyond all this it would have been possible for the Government to say that the Home Rule Bill had been properly debated-that the whole question had been examined and if the Lords had thrown it out, the same measure being brought forward again next year could with reason have been pushed rapidly forward The enormous advantage here indicated has been foolishly thrown away, and Mr Glad Stone has come forward with a patent muzzling process for gigging that Parliament of which he has been the ornament and pride for fully half a century His oldest and best friends grieve that he should thus have dealt snell a blow at his great reputa- tion, and not less that he has thus set an example which, in these democratic times, may be improved upon by others probably much less scrupulous and less concerned for the maintenance of the high traditions of the mother of Parliaments It is useless in this matter to fall back either upon the plea that Mr Chamberlain suggested the plan of procedure which the Government have adopted, or upon the precedent of 1886 made by Mr Smith Mr Chamberlain, as I have explained repudiates the method by which his scheme is applied, and as for Mr Smith, he had in his care a Crimes Bill which had already been many days in committee, and which was urgently needed I see that this last pro- position is contradicted by the Gladstonian press the Crimes Bill, they say was in no sense urgent In this case one would like to know why it was introduced Neither of the great parties in Parliament have latterly been scandals to tukctherepionch of bringing in coercive legislation and it is notorious that it has been left until the compelling, reasons were altogether overwhelming, Again, it is clear that there is no sort of analogy in the measures touching which the closure has been and is being applied Mr Smith's proposal was to confer powers for restoring law and order in Ireland-that IB, for giving the elementary conditions of good even eminent Mr Gladstone can make no such excuse At the best his bill is a doubtful experiment "which may have the grey est possible results He is re casting the i Constitution, and if we take Con tmental methods for example, it is found that the most Democratic and go ahead states proceed in such matters with the ut- most possible leisure In Belgium the revision question has been in hand for a full year or more, and it is still far from completion Mr Bruce has told us in his admirable book that the American constitution (of which he knows so much) was elaborated with the utmost possible care that, then, should there be this busy in regard to the cost of Ireland and especially when the scheme proposed is bitterly detested by one third of the Irish people' Her answers not far to seek Mr Gladstone, or those who have forced him know that their time IS sholl that the country is mary of Home Rule, and that it they are to make any sort of figure at the next election they must do other and more popular work for the constituencies sense it is that, witty mily, Home Rule is to be got rid of with all possible despot li, and the plausible stages tions are made first that the Government is giving a month longer for nhill which has already) been six weeks in committee and next that it is the business of the majority to control the Parliamentary machine As to the last it can be retorted that it is the business of the majority to act justly 1 litre if but the presence of justice in closuring a mi asure of this vast importance, and especially when we remember that it has undertone enormous changes since it was introduced, and is in no sense the measure it was When the Ministerialists allow them selves to talk about " corr) ing out the commission which the country entrusted to them ' they are talking nonsense, since the present bill was never before the electors and even assuming so much it has been quite transmogrified of late Mr Balfour put the matter in its proper light when he said he did not oppose the proposal as a Unionist, but because it was absolutely inconsistent with the very elements of the life of a free debating assembly The Government were initiating a new precedent and a new procedure which might result in irreparable injury to the future fortunes of the House of Commons This was the text-the obvious and proper text upon which the Opposition based their speeches But the Government having made their proposal offered no sort of reply Later on Mr Chamberlain fell upon the Government with great effect The Prime Minister, he said presented the spectacle of a good manstrug|.ling with adversity He was doing by compulsion a thing he loathed Under the threats of his Inih masters and the pressure of his leustexpenencedsupporters he was the mover of a resolution which was in contradiction to all the principles he had declared in that House during the whole course of his long Parliamentary career The resolution was a concession to intolerance another surrender to revolt He accused the Government of taking advantage of their brief tenure of office and of their casual majority to impose their will upon the minority and to betray the interests of the country, which were to be sacrificed to the pleasure of the men convicted of a conspiracy against Great Britain Fortunately the power of the Government did not equal their intentions and they would not be able even with the latest weapon they had forged to cram Home Rule down the throats of the reluctant British people The last card had been played and the Government had settled in conclave with Mr Sexton the particulars of the surrender under which the British Empire was to be sold by private treaty This slashing attack gave enormous pleasure to the Opposition but it did not causeways the occupants of the Treasury bench to rise The other night the Scotch Radicals started a debate on Scotch Home Rule which had a funny ending fair G Trevelyan as Secretary for Scotland, took the fence on behalf of the Government, though giving the motion his own support as a purely personal matter He seemed to indicate that the Government had in view a sort of glorified grand committee to deal with Scotch business "The proposition for a Scotch grand committee had many imperfections, but the Government would take the earliest opportunity to propose it. This was very different from Dr Clarke formal demand to devolve upon a Scottish Legislature all matters exclusively relating to Scotland, but the Scotch Radicals had to put up with it And when they went to a division with their crazy proposal Dr Clark found that he had but 100 votes As there were 108 on the other side he was defeated by 18 to the great merriment of the house At the same time, it is to be noted that the demand for "a Scotch Legislature found among its supporters Sir G Trevelyan Mr Asquith, Mr Rigby (Solicitor General), Mr Acland, Mr Arnold Morley, Mr Herbert Gladstone and other members of the Government If the first three are Scotch members the others are not. Truly we are getting on The vacant Parliamentary seats have now all been filled The Government managed to keep their hold of Pontefract by a majority of 12, and two and Parnellites have been jerked into the seats lately held by Mr M Davitt and Mr Morrogh in county Cork From to day the Government majority stands at 40 subject, however, to the loss by the de fection of Mr Bolton and (less frequently of Sir 1 Reed It depends upon these two gentlemen whether the Government count in excess of their avowed opponents 36, 38, or 40 Outside politics we have talked of little this week but the loss of the Victoria An official statement puts the drowned at 22 officers and 288 men, and the saved at 29 officers and 21 men Roughly half of the ships company were lost, including the commander in chief There is naturally much inquiry as to the precise cause of the catastrophe, but the despatches of Admiral Markham cannot reach the Admiralty until Sunday night, and meantime nothing is allowed to link out This very fact suggests (grave suspicions It is not a mere accident that has happened " If the gearing had gone wrong stay the knowing ones, you may depend upon it we should have heard of it long before this Somebody has blundered But who is it' Is the dead Admiral the culprit' It would be unfair to do his memory injustice, but he had a scheme of his own for the reform of naval tactics, and it was one of his ideas that in manoeuvring the ships of the squadron should in certain cases be worked closer together Whether this Boheme is responsible for a great disaster remains to be seen It is, however, not forgotten that the Victoria was on the rocks off Greece for some weeks last year, and this suggests that those concerned in handling her- not the Admiral of course-were possibly less capable than they should have been Captain the Hon M Burke has thus been summoned for court martial at Malta, and upon the result of this inquiry will depend whether the officers of the Camperdown should be brought to trial In this latter case Admiral Mark ham may have to answer Public opinion at home is strong in insisting that there should be the fullest and most complete in vestigation and that a heavy penalty should fall upon those who are adjudged guilty It is time, indeed, that somebody were made an example of for this sort of thing and some body will if public opinion can have its due effect Meantime public money is being generously contributed to the Lord Major's Fund for the benefit of the widows and children and other dependents of the lost seamen Hit Out on came to town from Windsor the other day and unveiled a statue of herself the work of her daughter the Princess Louise- which has been erected in Benzine, ton Gardens opposite the old Palace, where Her Majesty was born The statue is much praised by competent judges Cardinal Vaughan has carried out his scheme for rededication 1 noland to St. Peter the Prince of the Apostles His 1 matinee was roughly handled on an counting this project by those who remember that the cry of ' St George for England is part of our hiBtoncal Parentage yesterday at the rededication function the figure of St Peter was flanked by the figure of St George, by which it was realized that one patron saint was not to be disturbed in his sovereign Even a cardinal has to bow to public opinion though he is aggressive and ostentatious in the highest degree As a matter of foot, the successor of Manning has made his first bad mistake He is the sort of man who will make others
