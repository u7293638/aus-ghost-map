THE YAN YEAN. . -TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS SIR-I am compelled by Act of Parliament to pay for the use of the Yan Yean water whether ham supplied or not. The year 1865 was bad enough, but we were told in 1800 additional service pipes would be laid on, but I find we are worse off than ever, being five days out of six (unless one happens to be a wet day) without water from six or seven in the morning till ten or eleven at night. In your issue of this day you state that had the pressure v of water at St. Kilda been greater, the destruction of valuable property consumed by fire would in all probability have been less. What might be expected should a fire occur in this neighbourhood without any Yan Yean at all I am, Sir, your obedient servant, ROBERT T. WATSON. WoodvilleriSouth Yarra. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir, Since a quarter-past two o'clock up to the present hour this day not one drop of water has passed through the tap in my yard. I have no water for my tea, and am just on my way to' a friend who has a water tank, to get enough water to give my family a cup of tea each. Really, such treatment on the part of the Sewerage and Water Commissioners is rather too much. I pay my rates regularly on demand. Why is not notice given that the water supply is about to be stopped ! then I could have vessels filled sufficient for present use ? O. W. M.

The police were at length set to watch, and a rested-a large white owl. RATES, when Cardinal Mattel, Dean of the Sacred College, pronounced a eulogy on Monsignor de Witton, the Pope said to him, "jTf it becomes necessary to appoint a Minister again, I shall put the names of all the Roman prelates in a goblet, and draw one at random, for they only differ in name, and Sometimes in physiognomy: in everything else they are admirably alike, Pall Mall Gazette. ,.
