SO FAR. The Lay of 'Possum Dean. ' The Dean case has so far cost £4553 19s.' ' Go build a joyous rhyme, dear Owl,' My boss he wrote to me, ' And let the same be full of ' sowl ' And also melodee. Go write me for the Sunday Times A jingle up to date, On cricket match or recent crimes, Or aught that haps of late.' (P.S. — ' Dear Owl, reminding you In hunt for subjects keen. OlM f.ViUin- my ? ? The cussed case of Dean.') I sate me down with pen and ink And store of bottled — dash Of something popular to think Whereby to raise the cash. When poring o'er the daily sheet In meditation lost, Mine eye, alas ! did fatal meet — George 'Possum Dean — his cost!! I said, ' Avuuut, thou scarlet shade f Thou spectral Ghost of Dean ! Thou Spook, that never canst be laid J Go— Oh, go to Pot, I mean.' I will not jag the festive rhyme From out my blessed boots ; God bless tho judge that ' gave you time,' 'Midst public howls and hoots. For breakfast, supper, dinner, tea, We've had you now for years, And when the final end will be Lord knows — Eronse these tears. We are so tired of 'Possum Deau, So sick at heart and sore ; We wildly wish he ne'er had been, We don't waut any more. I will not raise a festive lay About this Pub lip Curse ; I wish he were in — well, in Hay, Or even somewhero worse, —Owl.
