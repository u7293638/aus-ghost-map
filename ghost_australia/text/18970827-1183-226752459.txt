ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. Dedicated to S. Phillips, Esq., M.L.A. (Per favour of the Duhho D'upatch.) With apologies to Longfellow, W c stood an the bridge at mid-day, On Thursday, thu nineteenth of June ; Aud tho suu shone without ceasing — A pity it wasn't the moon, But wc stood on tho bridge all the samo That crosses that terrible creek, And they cheered as I gave it a namo Like tho noise of the curlew's shriek. How often, nh I how often In the day that had gmio by, Had prayers goue up to soften Thu huarts of tho rnlorii hioh To build a bridge, so people might Cross o'er the gaping spot ; But all iu vain, tho people's right Was laughed at, wus it not? And far from thut hush around us, On that record day in Jnnc, Came cookuburra laughs thut found us Piping out our little tune. And my heart heat warm— justly so— And proudly I met each stare, For I had got the bridge, you know, Others give up iu despair, Yet, whonuvcr I think of tho place, And t ho bridge with its hardwood piers, Somo ugly ghoul rises face to face, And joy and hopu givo place to fears. Yet, for over and for ever. As long um Coulhuggiu flows, I'll ruvcru tho honoured giver Who gave mt thu bridge to dish my fops. COALBAGG1E GHOST. I'.S. — I may bu wrong us to dates, hut being ouly a ghost's dates aru of no moment to me. — C. G.
