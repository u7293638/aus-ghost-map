By half past C o'clock, the hour appointed, every seat at the tables was occupied, and still the visitors came, the total number being over 300.

The choir sang several anthems at in tervals during the addresses. The Rev. Charlos Price proposod a vote of thanks to the ladies who provided the tea, the choir, and to Mr Stanfiold for teaching the cluldron singing. Speaking of the old days, that was tho fortieth anniversary of the Wesleyan schools, and three years beforo that Sunday- schools had been established in Launceston, when the old Court Houso and St. John's Church wero the only churches in Launceston. He urged the necessity for more sympa'hy from tho mem bers of the churches to the Sunday Schools, and more liberality. When did they hear of 'the well-to-do members of the church inviting a teacher and his or her class to spend the evening and take tea, and yet these were excellent means for opening the minds of the young, at taching them to tho church by sympathy, and by reaching their hearts. (Applause.) The Rov. W. Law seconded, and in doing so reviewed much that had been said during the evening. ' The vote of thanks was carried by accla mation. Mr Stanfield, while acknowledging the vote of thanks, did not consider that thanks were necessary, but rather out of place for the performance of their duty ; 1...J. t. _.!_11 ? l^J ? .. 1_ J_.J Lll ' IV ? 1 ?

In referring to some of the matters which had- been discussed during the evening, Mr Stephenson de fended the style of dres3 of the ladies of Hobarfc Town arid Launceston, so far as to say that it was moderate in comparison to the style of the ladies of Melbourne.
