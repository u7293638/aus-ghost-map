The Msers,. Maemahon have the reputation for staging pieces well, but in the "Double Event" they have excelled themselves. The plot of the piece lit hinees on two great Australian roces, the Melbourne Derby and Oup, for which Richard Marston (Mr. George 11ocU) has a colt entered, on which he has .."ed heavily.
