LOVE'S SEASONS. The wall-flowers to the frolic viiid Do dance ttieir golden aiguletM, And elf- maids steal tbe lian thotn beads To wear Tor fairy amuless. The Spring is liere, the Spring is here— Tbe love-time of the year, my dear'. All heavy lmne the apple boughs, Weished down by balls of yellow gold; The poppy cups, so fiery bright, Meseems n ouid burn tne hearts they hold, The Summer's h. re, the Summer's here— The kiss-iime of the year, my dear! The birds are winging for the south, The elf-maids baste them to their bowers. And dandelion balls do float Like silver ghosts of golden flowers. The Autumn's here, ihe Aummn's here— The wife-time of the year, my dear: Noir are the heavens not more grey Than aru the eyeB of her I love; More dainty-white than her sweet breast The snow lies not the earth above. The Winter's here, the Winter's here— But love- time lasts the year, lily dear! Harper's Magazine. AMEUE HIVES.
