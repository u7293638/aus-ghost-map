":; :THE L OF HEARTACHE `.'} \--t isen'tthe tl odiinyo d dear I"It's tho thinig that you lcac .undone; `',:." Which gives you a bit of heartache At the setting'of the sun. Tlic tender word forgotten, The 'letter you did not wvrite, he flower you might have sent dear, S Are your haunting ghosts to- night. The stone.yeo might.have lifted . Out of a brother's way 'The bit of heartsome counsel You are hurried to much to say; The loving touch of the hand, dear, * \- The gentle and winsome tone. That you had no time nor'thonght for, * With troubles enough of your own: The little acts of kindness. So easily out of mind; Those chances to be angels . Which everyone may find, They come at night and silence, Each child, reproachful wraith--' When hope is faint and flagging.. And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion f hat tarries until to late; And it's not the thin" you'do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bit of headache At the setting of the sun.
