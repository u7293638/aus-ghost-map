"IIAMLET," AT THE CRITERION. me enthusiastic audiences which patronise Mr. Alfred Dnmplcr's "Shakespeare Fridays" at tho Criterion Theatre aro sufficleat to refute tho statement often made that plnygocrs take no In terest In tho production of Shakespeare's works. "The Merchant of Venice" was an unequivocal success, partly, no doubt, In consequence of Mr. Dampier's excellent reading of tho part of Shy- lock. Last night "Hainlet." was staged. Generally speaking, it may be said that the performance Is interesting. There is, however, no Bpeolal ex cellence about any member of the east, except Mr. Dumpier, In the name part, and Mr. Buller, as the llrst grave-digger. No one could fall to appreciate (he manner In which Mr. Dampier presents the Prince. Hamlet's varying shades of resolve to take vcngcunce for tho murder of his father and hesitancy when brought to tho point aro admirably shown in Mr. Dampier's method of presentation. Moreover, this popular nctor's finely-trained voice rivets tho attention ot tlie spectator oil the speeches, which Mr. Dampier delivers with polished ease, and without a mis take. Mr. Bailer's first grave-digger Is a very ad mirable piece of work. Miss Rose Dampier gives an intelligent reading of the part of Ophelia. \ Miss Kathcrlne Russell, who is cast as the Queen, j made her reappcaranee nfter an absence from j the compnny through illness. Mr. Edmund IIoI- j loway plays the ghost, Mr. F. G. Applelon tho King, and Mr. John Fordo Polonlus. Mr. Alfred Rolfe, Mr. John Forde, Mr. W. Howard Smith, . Mr. Cecil C. Calvert., and Mr. J. Benson North aro j nlso. with others, In tho cast. "Hamlet" will be repeated next Friday night.
