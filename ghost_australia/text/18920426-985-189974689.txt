A BIDE TO DEATH. A lieutenant of the 24th Regiment of j Chasseurs named Tayerne met with a most tragic death near the port of Nice: on Friday. At 4 o'clock in the morning he left Villefranche on horseback for V»r, in order to make the necessary preparations ; for the exercises of the day for the' men of his battalion. The horse—a big, fiery roan, which had only arrived a few days previously from Marseilles, and had been very little ridden—became restive shortly j after leaving headquarters. At the sum mit of the hill which overlooks the port of Nice the horse bolted at top speed down ] an incline. Coming to a-rapid curve in j the road at a spot known as Rabau Capeu, a corner associated with any number of ghost stories and lugubrious incidents, the animal jumped the wall, and both horse aud rider were dashed over the rocks into the sea: The road is, in fact, cut out of , the rocks composing that height, and from the route to the water is a precipitous drop of 40 orhQfeet. Here two currents meet, and the Mediterranean, usually so tran quil, is always troublous at this point. ' The most strenuous efforts so far have failed to find either horse or rider. The admiral of the Mediterranean squadron sent a steam launch and four boats, with 50 men and grapnels,, and late on Satur day night .they fouu'd a key on the rocks, which bad'been identified as that of the officer's' chamber in, the barracks, and , some hair of the horse tetuck to the rocks.
