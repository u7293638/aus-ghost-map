A MEDITATION. 'Tis hard to find, as fleeting years . On rapid pinions puass away, * That not e'on virtuo's leary hairs Oan aage or tameless death delay; - And that wore we to offer moro Thou all Australia's mines contained, 1 S' Combined with all that paler ore From far Peruvia's mountains drained, WVe could not bribe grim Terrors' King To fold one hour his sable wing, Or pause beneath tile realms of night . :ith Time, to check his arrow's flight. .In vain we shun a martial death, VWithdrawing far from fields of blood; In vain we shun the plague wind's breath, . Or fly the lightning and the flond ; Forall are doomed alike to roam Those dark and melensholy coasts, VWhre moaning breezes thro' the gloom Waft by dim clouds of plaintive ghost..' " Then why seek lands of crystal streams, On whose bright surface zephyrs play? . Or sparkling fountains lit bybeam . Of golden sunshlin bright and gay SAll must be left-all, all resigned, ' oth streams and leafy woods on high, And cypress only to the wind . . Above our lonely graves shall sigh.- , *' r OuAne'ON PARL _
