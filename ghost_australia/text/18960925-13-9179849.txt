FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1896. The pleasure of receiving a copy of the work published by Mr. G. B. CURTISS, of the United States, entitled Protection and Prosperity, has been withheld from us. Our knowledge of the book is confined to notices in the London papers, judging from which we should say, first that our loss is not severe, and secondly that the volume is one of the storehouses from which wonderful facts and figures are drawn for the edification or mystification of the Victorian public. The work, we are told, is proclaimed by the High Tariff chiefs in America and elsewhere to be the most im- portant of modern contributions to then cause, but, on the other hand, the London press treat it with un- sparing ridicule. It is spoken of as a mass of crude and cooked statistics. The Times pays Mr. CURTISS the com- pliment of supposing that he is honest, but then it does this at the expense of his intellect, for he is described as hope- lessly muddleheaded. His method of procedure, we are told, is primitive and simple—but it is familiar to students of High Tariff literature here, and it is the extraordinary similarity indeed that justifies a reference. If anything good happens to a country in which a high tariff exists, the duties are the cause of the boon. If anything of the sort occurs elsewhere, why, it has nothing to do with the issue. Mr. CURTISS (flatly contradicting JOHN BURNS) avers that the working people are better off in the United States than in Great Britain. But he has nothing to say how it comes about that the artisans and workers of Great Britain are far and away better of than their fellow-workers on the Continent. For instance (as we gather), he does not face the problem which con- fronts the working man, and which was stated here by Mr. DAVITT when on his lecturing tour, that misery in Europe is in direct proportion to the tariff policy, that the higher the tariff the greater the destitution and the wretchedness, the culmination being in tariff-oppressed Italy, where the most has been done "to keep work in the country," and "where starving women throw " themselves down before the soldiers " praying to be shot." This is the situation—the self-evident connection between restrictions on trade and the presence of poverty which deeply im- pressed Mr. DAVITT, as it must all who study facts. Mr. CURTISS, we are told, insists upon the necessity of main- taining high prices. A cheap coat means a cheap man. Cheapness is tho ficctradois' delusivo bait Lut at 0110 and the same timo Mi Guiuiss, wo aio told, nipos that piotoition 10 duces pines-and tho self contiudittion docs not 111 tho liast alloct lum unv 111010 than it docs his A ittonan fuouds Is Air Cuitnss repioluiing our Vu torinn advocatos of High lanil pun iiplus 111 this aina/ing tonfusion of thought, 01 aio thoy lopioduung lum I In any case wo havo oin local M vital 11 skotchod to tho Ufo in tho sontoncos which wo havo quotod, and also in tho following passago - .'Alargo pnrt of the boole is divotcdto proving that 1 ncjiinil is hint being ruined by freo trade Dir Cortina lum studied tho evi dune btlore the Itovul Commissions on Di pression of 'Irado and Agriculture, mid lie spinks ob if all our trades wcro rapidly going down hill and as if wuk«1* were declining, ' Tie is hero at issue with every Btatistioian who lins examined the recent movement m wages " Of course it doos not matter that ox erv o\poit Yvho 1ms otamined tho subject linds that xvages m Great Britain aro steadily mounting up, aud that the do pression in tindo which sinotothe xvhole Yvorld was felt mole lightly in Great Britain thau nnywhoro, and passed awiy theio hist also But Mr Mauglr sujs othorxvise, and that ii law How would Mi Myucir, it may bo asked, like Victoria and hei High land system to be pronouncod upon by the evidence gtveu beforo our Sweating Commission 1 -ind that XYould not bo utifait, bocauso the iSyyeating Commission dealt with protected tradps It 13 cm lous to noto that Captain Younghusband says that hu found liussian olicois m tho intoiioi of Asia leading thoso io potts of the British Commissions, and, in tho midst of wretihedncss and surrounded by a misetablp civih»ation, thanking Heaton that thou ppoplu uto bottot oil than the English not the most helpless of xvhoni would change places with thom-and spéculât ing on tile oaily collapso of Croat Butain tis a commercial empuo 'lhere is tho moto cccuio for tlio .Russian critics, because lïussian oflicor» in Asian desoits havo not tho samo oppoi Utilities of miking comparisons and of learning tho ti uth as we have Quoting London reports on sweating is, ns our various Mnugeis ought to know, and as indeed they must knoxx, analogous to quoting the mortality îotuins of tho London fovei hospitals ind arguing fiom them about the health of Great Britain But the most of out Maugors, of tho tongue and of tho pen, aro summed up 111 'Ila.

in political nnpoi tance in popu lation, wealth, loaming, art, and goner .1 civilisation It is curious to think that at a timo when London and Pans woro semi barbaric capitals, whon Vionna, Berlin, and St Petetsburg woro non oKistent, the city on tho Bosphorus was inhabited by a cultured and polished people, and contained nearly all tho tieasuros of ancient learning that had escaped the ravages of tho barbarians It held this position for ovoi a thousand j ears, a period far longer than the eutire existence of most of the piosent Luropoan capitals, and until tho rise of Voiuco and othoi Italian cities stood quito alone as a seat of learning and the arts, except per haps for the Moonah «tics in Spain 1 ho vast strength of its position and of the forces that defended it was well tebted

It must honestly be confessed that no such inferiority exists, and that the Australian Eleven is not only the strongest which has ever visited these shores, but that for sturdiness of play and evenness of form it is, perhaps, superior to an England Eleven. For brilliancy it can not compare with our best. The Australian team does not contain three batsmen of the calibre of Grace, Abel, and Prince Ranjit- sinhji; Richardson is a finer fast bowler than Jones and Trumble and Giffen, ac- complished performers as they are, are a shade less adroit than J. T. Hearne. But in the field, with the single exception of the wicket-keeper's place, the Australians are our superiors, and on dry wickets they show a consistent toughness which English cricket, even of the first class, sometimes lacks. Strong, hard-bitten nurslings of the 'mighty mother' are those Australian sons of ours, stalwart pledges of the race which, for work and for pleasure, still leads the world. As for their season, Trott deserves nothing but congratulations. To have beaten an England Eleven, Yorkshire, Surrey, Lancashire, and almost every combination of amateur and professional skill that could be brought against him is indeed a tribute to the Australian captain and his men. As usual, they have taught us the useful lesson that a match is not lost or won till the last ball has been sent down, and that grit counts as heavilv in cricket as elsewhere. Nor need we exult too loudly over our vic- tory in the last test match. Fortune, on the whole, withheld her favours from the colonials, and dealt them freely to the Englishmen. Australia has never come nearer the standard of the best English cricket than in the great year 1896, and she hass now and then surpassed it."
