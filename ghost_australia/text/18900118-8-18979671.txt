POETRY. WITHOUT THE VILLAGE. Night like a Nubian's brow begemmed Arches the bush with gloomy glitter; Sound to silence again condemned. Naught is heard but a rebel twitter Piercing the still like an arrowy flight: Save where the fearless untamed water Down its rough channel pours with might, Spurning control and laughing at quarter. Hard by the creek my fire's hot glow Cleaves a bright circle from the starkness Of dusk and chill, that vainly throw Against its squares their steely darkness. Fortress impregnable mine, and yet Sharply the sleepless leaguers harass; Foes from of old, and sworn to get Ground if they can, if not, embarrass; Through the cold ghost that grays with fright All the encircling air, I view me Mainmast stems with a skyward flight, Leafy steeples whose hearts eschew me. Deeps of mystery hem me round: In such a bush might roam lewd satyrs; But, far on high, the pure profound Shimmers with wings of holy natures. Wondrous thy might, O, roseate day! Fair and free are thy glorious features; Souls that are earthy rejoice in thy sway, God thou art ever of human creatures. But for the heart where heaven has placed Chords swept only by musing sadness, Might's pallid goddess, calm and chaste, Is the only satisfying gladness. SAWNEY STAFFORD.
