Premature Burial. A Singular Case Which Occurred in Paris. Another case of Premature burial worthy of being analysed in tho realistic manner ot Zola bos occurred in Franco. A11 elderly woman who lived nt an Old World place called St. Onen I.a Rouerie recently fell ill and, as lier friends thought, died. Tlie funeral took place, and aa the grave d'geer was preparing to lower the. collin into the earth he heard moans issuing from inside the lupubrious four boards inclosing the presumed corpse. Then followed a scene which was an exact counterpart of what occurred about twclvo months ago in another rural part r.f Franca. The grave dipper, half frightened of tbo probable ghost which bis imagination conjured up and partly awed by the require ments enacted by tho law in circumstances Buch as those in which he found, himself placed, left the coflin in tbe caro' of tho mourners and went off with bis somber story to M. le Maire. That rural dignitary, having duly donned bis scarf of ofliee and summoned the village doctor, proceeded to tho local ' God's acre.' The coflin was opened, and it was discovered that the woman had just died from fright, having awakened from a tranee to find herself hemmed in between tbo terrible deal plank9. When borriblo aecnes liko this are repeated it ia timo for the authorities and public at large to take into consideration tho invention of tlie ingenious undertaker who has adopted as his motto, 'No more premature burials.' This practical person offers to supply to all caje3 cf doubtful death an apparatus by means of which those who may hnvo had tbe mis. fortune to bo buried alive may not only inhale fresh air on their awakening, but also communicate by signal with the world which has left them for dead^ '
