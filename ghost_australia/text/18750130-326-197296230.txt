To v.ltom this mi.-i'-jriun,- is be ascribed, is not yet di.- covered ; wise: her sleep had ovcrpowen-d the sieersmar. ,.-r the boar- had been going against the ¦.¦.br and had capsized, or one rid-ik id-i it had been purposely done, v.h > t'.m 1 !' g It is certain that the discour.-.ge.i . . swaiu had already threatened twice - knock a hole in the craft in order, in- re doing, to put an end to the r, risen- of ;dh but that he had always been piWer.t-'d from doing it. Alter tiie ups-itiag ol the boat, every one clung as weii a- pos-ii-lc to the cordage lying ahout, and four of the men bad the good luck to creep nnon the keel and get a firm hold of it. Ti:.- boatswain and two of the- sailors were s.-on washed away from the boat by the iv-iiisi'.' Seas ; Schutt. a sailor, v.d.r, v.- as au cxccie-ni swimmer, took oil' ids clothing whiht swimming, and reached iiis comrade Y,-r- meulen, who was already sinking. Yi'bilsi be, exerting all hi? strength, was swim ming to the boat, the boatswain sudden!-.- laid bold of him by? the leg, so that th-.-' vigilant swimmer had to save two persons- Desire of self- preservation bade him, how ever, free himself from this burden, and he released himself from tbe grasp of th:- boatswain, who afterwards clung to a bread case floating in the neighbourhood. He reached the boat, and after having pri his c-omrade Aermeulen upon it, he o:sc« more betook himself into tbe water to sr.t- Others. He, however, found no more, and saw, in the bright moonlight, only the empty bread case floating; the boatswain bad sunk a little while previously. Thus out of eight men, only six were holding on to the upset boat, without any fc-ou or hope of rescue, yet they supported and encouraged each other, It was not untii morning that they succeeded, after spend ing four anxious hours in this condition, in righting tbe boat again ; after which i; was immediately decided, in order to prevent a repetition of the misfortune, io cut away the masts and take down the Sails. On the Sunday morning lcllowing a smaller sail was made of some pieces r: wood, so that they could; run at once right before the wind. Hunger and thirst, however, harassed them extremely, and the latter was made worse by their drink ing sea water. The Sunday wr.s passed miserably ; every one lost courage, and. owing to the feeble hope of meeting with a v-ssid, none of them dared full asleep. When at last, Monday came, ihev were all at a loss owing to privation, and agseecl on a plan of killing one of their number to R- assigned by lot. Only a Asort time nfti rtl-iey had put thc-ir coni'ide to deal):, . they wore rescued by riie Java Packet, after having spent 23 days in the boat, a j:-: having navigated fuiiy 2000 English Utiles, Tiie circumstances attending their sacri fice g one of iheir number to tbe demon of hunger are thus related in the Tlandh shlcl of Ye 3rd inst. : — " For seven days they had eaten nothing, and had endeavoured to quench thirst by sea water, so that one of '.hem, wholly exhausted, strove to stab bin : elf in despair. He was, however, re strained by the others, who proposed that, considering the circumstances, it should br- decided by lot which of the six should be- rise first victim io save his comrades for a while from death by hunger. In conformity with this plan, six pieces of wood of varying length were cut; the male held, them in his hand, and each of the men drew out one ; he who drew the longe.-t wa3 to fall. Francis Shufus, an Italian, was the unfortunate whom the lots assigned for it. Meekly and without a murmur Le submitted, and soon he gave up ine ghost under the knife of his hungry fclle . e. Some hours afterwards, and when the . had just commeuced their horrid me. . a sail was sighted on the horizon, wh-'Yer course was immediately shaped. On the evening of the same day, August 31? . the five rescued persons, completely exl ...-laied, reached the deck of the Java Par' i. Captain Trappen and his subordi- n r.Y-i ;v, i ii c d i a t ely did asmuch as tlieycould by ireful. treatment,. to make the five un- fon nates forget as -much as possible the mis rv sufibred. Yesterday they were ; brought here naturally destitute of every- ' thii s, and are living in a sailors lodging- bo Ye near the Wharf. Their names " are Jau.vs Archer, .2nd mate ; August Muller, . Vic or . Sandstorm, Manus Schutt, . and Ale vander Yermeiilen, sailors. Their ge- f mr.iaing comrades in the two other boats have, according to a Lloyd's telegram of to-day, arrived safe at St. Helena without accidents." Crowded Out. — Owing to a heavy pres sure :>u or.r available space at a late hour last evening a large amount of interesting local intelligence is unavoidably held over.

Mortality in Rwyhfrglen.— Since the beginning of the vein- the deaths have been unusually numerous in and around Huihcrgleu — no less than seven having occurred up io date. The quarterly, re turn doer, not exceed that number, and it may be therefore inferred that the oppres sive lieac of the season has exerted a dire influence on the genrral health cf ihe district. The last ease was that of a daughter of dir. Robert- Turner, of Lake Moovlemcve, who expired on Thursday night last in fits — having what is generally known as "spoiled brain." — Chronicle Accident. — On Tuesday a man named Knight war- admitted into the Hospital having ihe third and fourth fingers of his right Laud smashed. It appeared says the IVa.nyarcdtit Dispute!: that he wss engaged wiilt a threshing machine belonging to Mr Taylor, which wa- being taken from Mr O'i ! alioran's to Mr O'Brh'iFs farm, both of which are situated on Docker's Plains. This was in the evening, and Knight perceiving a small stump in the road, endeavoured to pull it up. TdhiLst so en gaged his rigii'.. baud was unfortunately jammed against the stump by? one of tbe wheels oi the machine, and tbe injury we have already described inflicted. On examination it was found necessary to amputate tbe third and fourth fingers close io the hand, which operation was performed by Dr Hutchinson. Kuight, who is a man about fifty years of age, is progressing favorably. Scx-stroke. — On the last day of the races, a horse belonging to a countryman, which had been left tied to a fence, died from the effects of sun- stroke, From the same cause two splendid animals dropped dead. One was the property of Messrs. Crawford and Connolly, the other belonged to Uir. Doyle, oi Wodouga. A horse belong ing to Mr Kennedy, poundkeeper, was also struek yesterday; he however, bled the animal, and it is now recovering, but will be cracked for life. — Post The Bookmaker s Coat.— While Mr Sil- berberg was engaged at the -classic amuse ment known to billiard-players as Devil's Pool; at the Exchange billiard saloon, Albury, on Saturday night, two men entered the place, says the Post, about midnight, seated them selves, and shortly afterwards took their departure. Mr Silberberg missed his coat, which was on one of the benches, and contained belting books and other imple ments of the profession, hut not the roll of notes. Alarm was given, and the police were scouring the country until clear day light. One of the visitors, named Edward M'Donald, on hearing Ihe hue-and-cry, repaired to the lock-up, and gave up a coat whieli he said he; found under his head in the Manse paddock, where he slept all night. Constable Ful- lerton apprehended him on a charge of stealing the coat, and he was brought before the bench on that vulgar charge. He was let off on payment of a fine of £1. Mr M'Donald may congratulate himself. It is to he hoped he closed the gate of the pad- i dock and did not catch cold. J
