A Scotch Ghost. " TALL AND WHITE.'' The other night (a correspondent writes) a young a an had an extraordinary experience near Lockerbie. The Dryton Bridge, beside which is the old cemetery, has long been notorious as a haunt of ghosts. Having to cross the bridge going from the town, the young man happened to glance to the right, and saw a tall and white ghostly figure. The night was dark, but the phantem was distinct, for a luminous halo seemed to surround it. Without a sound it slowly moved for about four yards. The young man almost petrified with terror, could use neither litnbs nor voice. The figure, halting, suddenly drew bank and noiselest-ly . disappeared. Recovering the use <>f his limbs, the terrified man ran towards his home, half a mile further along the road. Arriving at the house, he told his strange tale. He refuses to admit that the spectre was the product of imagination. The affair is causing a sensation in the neighbourhood. Recently a similar affair tooic place, and it is said that apparitions have been repeatedly seeD in the old Dryfesaa^ Churchyard.
