MR. O. R. SNAZELLE AT THE ATHENAEUM. On Christmas afternoon Mr. G. H. Snazelle presented a very agreeable matinee entertainment, which had been specially arranged with a view to its representation on a few afternoons during the holiday season, including this afternoon and Wednesday and Saturday next. It comprised instrumental music, songs, and appropriate recitations, Illustrated by some of the very large number of illuminated pictures which Mr. Snazelle has just received from England, and the entertainment met with the hearty approba- tion of the audience. Mr. Snazelle's fine voice was heard at its best in " Hooked in the Cradle of the Deep " and " There is a Green Hill Far Away Miss Snazelle gave a S leasing rendering of "My Dearest Heart," and tr. Hawkins furnished the accompaniments as well as some selections on piano and organ. The illustrations of some beautiful places of the earth," including " The stately homes of (England," were received with great favour, and the narration of " Gabriel Grubb, or the story of the Goblins who Stole the Sexton," afforded opportunity for the display of a large and diversified collection of views as well as for very appropriate and interesting proof of Mr. 8naMllo's ability as a reciter. A number of chronic tropes brought to a close an entertainment well adapted to please and entertain a . matinee audience in which young people generally predominate. In the evening Mr. hazell gave another excellent programme In the presence of an audience which completely filled the hall. The principal item was the recital of "A Christmas Carol " or Marley's Ghost," adapted from Charles Dickens' Christmas story, and illustrated by an admirable series of scenic effects representing the conversion of Scrooge from ft misanthrope to a genial and jovial member of society. The same entertainment will be repeated every evening until further notice.
