Open Column. We do not identify ourselves with the opinions of our Correspondents. ' LET THE DEAD BURY THEIR DEAD.' (To the Editor of the Daily Free Press.) Sir, — I see in your issue of the 18th inst., in a memorial sermon preached by the Rev. Dr. Geekie last Sunday, a statement which there are more than myself who do not accept as fact, viz., ' The Lord Reigneth.' Evidently the Rev. gentleman intended the earth as the place where 'the Lord reigneth.' I should have no controversy with him, but when a statement is worded thus — ' Although error and superstition were at work, yet all must admit that 'the Lord reigneth,' ' I do not know how much super- stition the Rev. gentleman has knowledge of, but the statement made by him is so palpable an error, that we cannot wonder the superstition not being dispelled. Another statement the preacher makes is speaking of the deaths in the religious world, viz., that it was the weaker for their having gone. I do not quite go so far as to charge the preacher with denying the presence of the Holy Ghost on the earth, because the preacher says the ' religious world.'' I had an acquaintance with it once, and gladly left its company, but if the preacher means that the power on earth of work for Christ is any less by the absence of these men from the earth, I should then charge the speaker with denying the power of the Holy Ghost. Yours, etc., B.
