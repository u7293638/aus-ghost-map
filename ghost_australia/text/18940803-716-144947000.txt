''''SH0Rf^~Sf'ORY; The Lady's Maid's Story. - 'Yfs. misB, certainly, J lived with Mrs. Birch— Miss Grigg that was before Bhe married Mr. Birch. I knew all about that affair, ic.was very singular indeed —very. I'm not sure that I ought to mention it, for if a lady's maid can t hold her tongue she can't find good places. Dear rue, I'm no talker. I'm as mum as a mouse. Bushels of pearl powder and quarts of rouge have I applied with my own hands, and rever so much as hinted-at. As for cotton, bleBS your heart, 1'veneverso much as breathed about it. 'I lived with a lady once that took arsenic regularly for hor complexion. That's no secret, for she took too much one day, by accident, aud died. It all came out in the inquest. It's well it did, for suspicion pointed at the husband. Somehow it always seems to strike a jury that a husband is the likeliest person to wish a wife out of the way. ' But this isn't anything about paint; Miss Griffg being on the sbige, made no secret of that. She played queens and such, miss. I've often had tickets given me and gone with my young man to see her act. And when sbe was haughty and curled her nose lik«, miss, and looked at other folks over her shoulder and talked away down in her throat like a pigeon gurgling, she ?waiB:-.'-»plendid,.';.-iniBJi.;^;-It: lib be a ^ qu^^and takJe ^airs pter eyiery body. 'Well, Miss Grigg was engaged to be married. Sir. Birch, had fallen in love with her when she was playing Hamlet's ma. Perpaps you have seen the play, miss? The young man objects to his ma getting married ihe second time, so I seemed to make out, aud acted impertinent, giving sass to his ma and his st«-p-pa, and carry ing on awful. Aud there was a poor young lady quite out of her mind that afterwatd got drowned. ' Well, she was playing Hamlet'B ma, and Mr. Birch fell in love with her aud sent her a letter, and called and made an offer, all in no time. She accepted him, of course, and the preparations for the wedding began. I don't tbbik any lady ever had so many dresses before. SilkB and satins, and velvets and lftces. Dear, dear ; Mine. Blank's whole establishment was hard at work for a month, and if I'd had twenty fingers instead of only ten, I'd have had use for them aiL ** At last everything was finished. The trunks were packed, fifteen of ihem, miss,, aud fourteen we e to go on that after noon, and one — the one with the wedding and travelling dresses — was, of course, to go on with the bride when she started next day. She was to be married at ten o'clock, in the church, and then drive Lome, have a splendid breakfast, change her iress and catch the three o'clock train. Of course I saw to the trunks, and I was very careful ; but just when I was needed most, just as the trunks were being taken down stairs, Miss Grigg called for me. ' Miss Grigg was a lady who didn't like to wait, and so I went to her at once, miss, as was niy duty, and I said to Bridget Duster, '.he chambermaid, — ** ' Bridget, watch that black trunk, and see that the men don't carry it off.' ' Bridget understood with her elbows, of courve, miss, and after I had been to the land'send for two yards of blueribbon of exactly such a shade as she wanted, and got back, I found that she had sent off the black trunk first of all, and wub very proud of having been so care ful. The trunkB were all miles away by that time. ** There was nothing For it but to tell Miss Grigg. She flew at me, miss. I don't blame her for being angry. I would forgive her in such a case. She flew at me, violent, miss; and then, miss, she had Bp isuis. She beat the sofa, she tore her hair, she screeched, and me all the while saying,— ''Remember your eyes, miss. Think how you will look, miss. Your nose is ewelliug dreadful, miss.' 'Finally sbe came to and bathed her face. Aud Bays she : ' * Flora, what shall I do ?' *' ' I dou't know, miss,' said I, ' unless you put off the wedding until you can telegraph for the trunk.' '* * No, that's unlucky ; beside, one never knows. Noue ain't to be depended on.1 ' * You might borrow a dress,' »aid I. *' * As if I would be married in a dresi that did not fit,' she said. 'Stop, don't speak a word. I've an idea.' ' She sat with one finger on her lips fui h while. Then she said : ' ' My embroidered dressing gown. Thb white one ! That's there ?' ' * Iu the bureau, miss,' said I. , ' ? Very well,1 said she. * I'll be mar ried in that. Telegraph for the trunk. Flora/ ' * The white dressing gown, mif s ? said 1 nearly astonished out of my senses. ' * Yes,' eaid she, 'the white dressing gown ; you goose, you dou't think I'm going to be married in church in that. I won't put off the wedding, and I won't stand up before a crowd in anything but my white satin dress ! But I'll be mar ried at the appointed hour, for all that. So telegraph for my trunk and come back soon.' 'When I came back I found Miss Grigg in bed and the doctor sent for. He was puzzled, I could see that. He couldn't tell what was the matter, and Misa Grigg was tpc^fainjbjho.epeaiE.-:; He C much agitated. Ce pi^nbed sottiething and went off, bidding me send for him if she seemed worse- The evening paper published the report that Miss Grigg was ?'aiigerously ill, and Mr. Birch came to the hotel in a terrible fright, as pale as a shoot, to ask how she was. I took him down ' Her love, and she was very ill.' ' Then Mias Grigg said to the ladies who had come in : *' * Leave me with my faithful Flora/ ' We were very soon left alone. Ican't say that I was surprised when she sat up in bed and said briskly : ' ' ' Lock the door, Flora. I'm sick of lying on my back. I've taken them in, haven't i -* You see what 1 am aboqt nowT ' * Exactly, nrisa,* «aid £, * to be too ill to be married when the time-comes.' ** * No,' said ahe 5 * to be ill enough to be married in the white dressing gown. I'm going to be married on my dying bed, Flora/ 'I gave a screech and she laughed, and tlicn she made a supper of sardines and biscuits and wine, and threw the medicine out of the window. Early next day the doctor came. I answered his question as to what eort of night his patient had passed by saving she had been *much the ttiuu/ Then I took a little note she had written to Mr- Birch, who was anxiously waiting. ' ** I knew what was in it. She told him = *hai rather than leave the world without *%ejiing licr *ow u- fcim Bjie would be «!arriei on her dying bed. I- powdered *'«r vu *ell, miss, and Pressed her ia the ] -tu.hroidensd dressing gown, with tub* ' \- ^«-i at the tUro»t. I pulled down the \ «!** Mwwd^tjkwed the room, 6h*- fixed the pillows to prop herself up with, and then skipped into bed. _^_ ''Give me my .'.'pearl bracelets/ she said. *and the handsomest of those hand kerchiefs, and all my rings ; and Flora, mind you must sob all through the cere mony. I'm going.- to- be calm.' 'We hadn't five minutes more, bufc just as the first knock -came, to tbe door, she whispered sorrowfully : ' * Oh, dear I if I could only have slow music. Oouldn't you catch that'Tra- viata' organ,: Flora, and get him to play for half an hour outside the window I He's al ways on the corner. Ill leave you something handsome if you do/ ' I did it, short as the time was. I caught that man and he grouud out hii quarter b worth. 'The clergyman was a very nice, neat, near-sighted old geutlenian. Mr. Birch was the dreadfulest sight — pale as a ghost and shaking from head to foot. The groomsman looked dreadfully sorry ; the four or five intimate friends looked as though they were at a funeral ; and to see her, with her calm smile and powdered face, one hand against her heart, the other in his — I was glad I'd been told to sob ; I had tt» do something. And so they wer-e married. *' * I feel,' said Miss Grigg, slowly, 'that this, perhaps the last, moment of my life, is very sweet. To die thus, with o^y hand in yours— ah 1 Dear friend, adieu ;i ; ^FJora^ Jmjr ^lai tbjEul lyaid, take y^^-?iring^:f#^^t^^;:^-w-- jjicV out .^the ; cneapi^tf^ut-^o' matter. ' Remembdr me by it. ^Now— leave us/ ' 'Then everybody kissed her and went out of the room sobbing. 'In a moment more there was ascroam; Mr. Birch had fainted away. It took an hour to bring him to. ' The reporter of the evening papei was waitingoutside for the newa. It wai *11 published that night, but the next ifternoon the travelling dress came back iu the black trunk. ' Yes, miss, of course — Miss Grigg — I mean to say Mrs. Birch — recovered at jnce. And that's the whole story. I'm she only one that knows it, and I wouldn't mention it to any one but you, 'ua'aui.'
