AN ADVENTURE WITH BANDITS: S Ry Harold sahanki I ha . been at.my uncle'sa an&h; -i South America abouo six months,, les ning the 'business of stock rearing.. My leaving England was. owinig to my father's; death:; for, not wishing :to:be an: encumbrance on my remaining parent,: I re solved; to. go abroad to my Uncle'; Sam, and endeavour, as far as I possibly could, to assist~, my mother,; brother., and sister by sending what money I mightbe so. fortunate as to earn.. rJust a few weeks after I had stepped on the quay of BuenosB Ayres,.I received - the sad, intelligence of the death of her wh had been the best of mothers.. As soon as. the black bordered ;envelope was placed in. my-hands, a feeling of awe and dread overcame me, so much so, that for a time I dared not break the seal.. "As soon as I made acquaintance with the ntens .of the. letter, I told my uncle (who, I may herelsay, was a jolly old fellow)? and said, '-I muss go. home and work for them in Erigland.:: ' '-Poor boy,, said Uncle Sam, Lyon have ahad,; a 1-t of trouble lately, but youa: can't keeptLily and Harry. '-I can try, unce,' said' I,. maifully , Land if.. I can't manage it,; wwe ill g inatoe the ~orkhouse' together: A s., mile crossed uncle's bronzed- fie as he said,. 'NotifI knowit. : ' \- What!'my sister Lily's. childen .go into the: workhouse while I am: aalivl: Why, Lily's.ghost would haunt. me till I got: you, out. No, my lad, we wilt bing' them 8 out; here, and you can g dowPn to. Buenos Ayres and meet them. After a long discussion, the matte was arranged. ` A letter was written to a' friei~ of my late father's, resident in- London, requesting him to see Lily : and Harry sent out by one of the mail packets from Liverpool, and my unele, with his usual impetuous generosity, enclosed a draft suflicient in. amount to de fray their outfit and cabin passage. Six nion.ths must elapse. ere I could em brace and welcome them to their new home, but long before that date on which their vessel; was due my knapsack was packed,. so eager was I to set out on my journey,. a distance of 'over one hundred miles. At last the daby arrived when it was ar ranged. I should set forth; so, well mounted on a half bred horse, and accompanied by a' couple of 'cowboys, great chum's of mine, Tom: and Jack by name, I sallied ifrth, di- lighted at the prospect of meeting those who were son dear to mae. We 'were- alt well- armed, each earrying,, slung across., bi 'shoulder, a rifle, while in handy hosters were. our revolvers,. weapons with which I had become 'a pretty ifad shot. This was' all the more necessary, as we might meet somn.,ehady people: on the way. We were not exlieet?d home fori a fort night- at'least, just befodre Christmas Day, as I had to transaet.some business, for my uncle befece I could start for home. Arriving -at Buenos Ayres, we took up our quarters at an inn, in which it turned out there were lodged somehalf score of half breeds, men and women of half Spanish and half Indian blood. Their looks were villainous i4 the extreme, ard betokened us- no goodwill. The landlord showed us to a small bed room, in which there were a4lcouple of 't~ruckle-beds, the coverings .of whEihwere by no means elean. Being tired, we turned fiT, Jack and Tom oocpying the one bed, ahd I 'the other. We must have slept some-hours when I became conscious. that there'"was ~ a slight stir on~ :the .Ioded stair leadinig to- our I' listei ancd heard some isperi-ng. Dreading that am attempt was kbout to be made to enter oar apaitment, I cdrept out of bed to iarouse my compareio"ns. .. p,,: They werel in a deep:sleep, and it was with difficulty I awakened thesmuh." : Tom -at-' once grasped' the situation, and said,;': Boys, let' them come.,' The noiseoutside had .by. ths time ceased, but, to be ready for any emergenoy; we slip. ped on our jackets, and saw to. the chambers~ of our revolvers. . . Sca~rcely had we done so when - we again heard footsteps on the stair ?arid 'inmedi ately afterwards'the bandleof doay was gently tri~i.' :w:, - wa Determniied to take the bullby th~i'horns~ Jack shouted; ' Oome in I :" " : -? The scuffling .of:footsteps going downstairs was liea~id -but, Tom, going, to the door to discover the cause of'the intrusiot found himself confronted'by the stalwartform of the lina-k~eor, ' Well, ,what', do iyou want ' asked Tom. ..-, 'I thought that I had forgotten to- eave wate"?'ieplied.th'e innkeeper, who. was sur prised ,,to. see -:Jack and me sitting fully armed onda our beds, nuder the rays of moon light which streamed'intb the room,, ' Look he.re, said Tom,. who was a. giant in strength, If you don't get down those stairs-in half a minute, I'll throw you down, If we wast"ainyhiing, we wilfias for it. Are you going' > :.. • .. ' No, I am in my own house, and I can do~ as I.like,' he sullenly.answered,. r~ .. , .'? ; ' Can you said Tom. "1 dont kn~w sio much about that.' n s : o . " And, lifting the landlord in his .... "". threwi hii ddowi'nstairs. -,, - As the iaMkeepar tumbled to'the bottom, he carried with him two of the half-breds who were hurrying to his assista~nce... Another of the gang, who was concealed on the landing, endeavoured to:make good his retre~t,,whiclh was hastened by well applied kick'frem Jack. .. The question was now, whlat wan? l- be done? - Escape was necessary, but how :? .' The room 'below we kiiew"tb bi ?ull of the villainous half-breds, therefore :our pa e was barred that way. . Quick as thought Tom opened the window, and found that we were not more than twelve feet from a' veran'dh,' which ran along the front of the house. He ordered us to pitch our knapsacks and revolvers (our ,rifles had been left at 1Mr Thornson's, a Scotchnan,; and a frieid of m:i uncle's)/ o th?r -. ' : is- o -ers were obheyed, andin- a-ri"eew.e were standing at his side. We took' to"' our heels, but had not got twenty yards when .we heard demoniacal yells proceeding from the house. SLights were flashing' ii the' r6omi we had' just quitted, and c?ires: dep.-anloud fe6l' upon .our ears.. ý" k pistol was fired at usA.butby.',this tiime we were out of range. ': ,, Naturally, we made for thil$ hri of M' Thomson, whom we aroused from-i ~d, and after we had. told him of our narrow,.escape, he kindly asked "us to makeihi~ house: our home during our stay at B nos. I was conscious of being ?wachdby. the half-breeds. : The business which .li, d' ttrasact (ordering stores for the . nch: was bon: over,''but it was ob'vious to us: that:. we iwere, being tracked all day long by spies.: More especially was tl noticable when 'one morning, when I was ?ming out of the bank, where I had been c hing a cheque' to pay some accounts. on une 's behalf,' a man, with his sombrero. over hii forehead, and the. lower part of his face cov ed with 'a' cloak, hestily left the portico of?¬ ajoining buinld ing, antd joined a couple oq cut-throat-looking individuals, who. were stading some: fifty 'yards down the road. I was alone at the time, Toinaand Jack' having gone to. the shipping ofise to inquire when we might expect the maiL' steamer. Seeing the group looking in my dirmetie:. i I naturally thought thatI was.tie?obje?t of their.intention.. So,. summoning a vehicle ·.1 drove off* '? the.-, three merchants that zI had? to settle with, and handed over the contents of my well-filled parse to them, .leaving myself in possession of mufficiet;:dollars to-" cover .expenses. I had in my pol'cket another cheque for 600 dbllars (about £150. of English 'money), the change of which I: had to carry home;:. but, tearing.:that I might: get -robbed I' re solved to leave it' withl Mr Thodhson? andi ask him to take care of it until he received.in sta?ctions. from uncle as to, how he could transmit the cash :up country.
