SATURDAY, JUNE 21, 1882. The country appears to have regarded the recent proceedings in the Assembly with surprise rather than sympathy. No enthusiasm has been exhibited for the Government, though its existence has been threatened. If there had been a collapse, the suddenness of the event would have been a cause for wonder, but apparently it would not have provoked indignation. Any alarm felt was occa- sioned by the possibilities and the danger of the hereafter. Constitutional mem- bers flinched from the idea of a coalition Government. Probably constitution- alists out of doors, not having to undergo the trials of their representatives, flinched still more. Yet neither the Francis corner nor the Opposition corner nor the direct Opposition, can form a Govern- ment, nor can the O'Loghlen Ministry stand alone. The future, therefore, is dark. There is no seer who can pene- trate such obscurity. It may be in- structivo, however, to review the events of tho budget period, and to point out the part played by each of the different groups. The Government emerges from tho strife still holding office, but with a con- siderably damaged prestige. Critics can indulge freely in the taunt that Ministers have saved their existence at the cost of their honour, inasmuch as they have retired from some of their budget proposals, not willingly and legitimately at the instance of their supporters, but ! under the pressure of a direct motion and of an adverse majority. Their sup- porters asked, and they asked| in vain until they appeared in arms at the gates in company with the Opposition. It is neither seemly nor safe that a Govern- ment should force on a coalition of this character even for a day. And , should Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN allow a , vital difference to proceed so far ar/am ve queabon whether Mr FRANCIS or unv other leader will be able, or will ova* caroto try, to effect anotherrcconcihation Unless Ministers are unteachable, tho? must have learned that tho first duty of a Government is to keep m oympatliv with its supporters, and not to ernie, vour to defeat its fnonds by the uso of Opposition votes-as was proposed in this case-nor yet to drive ita friends into counter Opposition alliances Anothei auch error would bo ruinous lhere would bo no more statements that the constitutional leader "had dono "eveiything but goon his knees to the Premier, no more private entioaties and no moro public quarrelling Mina' ters would be called strictly to acccount because their suppurteis would have to' preseive then own solf respect It is more pleasant to noto tho atti tudo of the Constitutional party and it3 leader duiing the recent imbroglio Mr I RANCIS started with a defined object of postponing the proposed re minions, on the gtound that it this junctuio any largo loss of permanent revenue is inadvisable lue radical criticism to which he has been subjected is more forcible than pohto, and is based upon the assumption cither that ho submitted his amendment as a vote uf vf int of confidence, or that his duty was not to allow Ministers to iccede when they accepted that amendment as a challenge But there was no o\cuso for anj one in the Parliament or m tho cotintrv misttking Mr FRANCIS s posi tiou He stated in the House with ill »cn sible frankness that ho thought it neces saiy to do all that lay in his power to secure a sound BJ stem of finance for the ensuing j ear, and tint he also thought it inadvisable to precipítalo a change of Government If M11113 teis cho^e to tike ln0h ground, anl to insist upon cutting icross the poky of then supporters, the consciences would ho with thom On luesdiy, how e\ cr, Mi 1 it "su-) obtained a pialba tint Ministers would themselves giva effect to his motion by not proceedin" with the remissions Whethoi tho Go° veinment aie altogether redeeming tint pledge is another m îtter Put themoment Mr 1 1 \NCIS obtained assurances thit the Government would gi\o way, hewas entitled to gi\o way also, relying on the good faith of tho Irea-surei He hld attained his one and his openly avowed tnd llieie was \acilhtion to tho right of the Speaker, no doubt, but the vacil lation was not on the part of tho mam bei foi Warrnambool, who announced 1 progianime, and who rigidly adhered to it despite the storm raging about him, and despite the mlluences brought to bear upon him to induce him tasweivo in the one direction or tho other One important difference exists between Mr 1 KANUS and the Opposition mern bers who complain of Bis conduct, and it is a difference which should rightly tell with the public All the step? which the 1-ttei gentlemen take-now hotly condemning the remissions, and now w ith the same eagerness and the '.ame warmth approving of them are steps in the direction of oihee, taken with the undisguised object of seeming placo, pay, aud patron age foi themselves Mr I nwaa, on the other hand, had oilico within Ins grasp He had only to harden in his action, and he bad a certain majority, aud the position of Premier would ba\e become his by general acclaim But he preferred to discharge his simple duty Such conduct is quite inexplicable to radical critics, who describe it as weak, but the country must recognise at a glance that at least it is patriotic Much of what has been said about Mr 11 vNcis applies necessarily to the members co opeiatmg with that hon gentleman Iheso members could easily ba\e brought about a crisis lliey could lime brought into existence a new Administration in which most of tho ln0h office-, would necessarily have been held by their own chiefs Lut so long as the Government will consent to du chargo its duty, they are reluctant to do anything to endanger tim reate mid the prosperity which the country is undoubtedly enjoying Ihen opponents may take exception to this decision as unwise It usually is difficult for any party to convince an adversary of the propriety of its pro cedure, but the most pronounced foo mu't admit that the policy m question is self sacrificing, and that it can only be inspired by honourable motives Certainly the conduct of tho Goruer membeis is in bright contrast to that of the Opposition At half past G o clock on Tuesday, the Opposition were ready to vote for a motion declaurig that tho rovenue remissions should be postponed sine di, and they would have countenanced a now Government which would necessarily have had to postpone the remissions and to have íe introduced the beer and the tobacco imposts At half post seven these same gentlemen were oagorly applauding their leader in his declaration that it was intolerable that theso duties; should be continued an hour longer, and that he and his followers would voto against Mr rnA_cisandfor tho original Ministerial propositions They mado overtures to the constitutional members to unite with them against the renns sions When that alliance broke down, they made overtures to the Ministry to vote for the remissions against the constitutionalists. It ia such shifts and tricks as theso that dis gust people outside with politics and with politicians, and which go fai to justify the belief that public life is a sham The consti- tutional members did not so besmireU themselves. The provocation to resent thoMinistenal slight even after the Minis terial withdrawal must have been great, but the Corner members can claim that they considered not so much themselves as the country And at a crisis so anomalous as the present the country can demand of its representatives no moie than that they should act as d{* the constitutional members last weeK, doing what is right from day to day, ana working for the general goodin common The letters which have appeared in our columns recently with regard to the pro- posed Working Men's College show that although progress has been made in the arrangements for establishing a separate institution, there are some who hope that Mr. ORMOND may yet be per- suaded to reconsider his determination, and to devote his liberal donation to the improvement of existing educational machinery. Our correspondent " Specta- "tor" tells us that he was moved to submit his views by a desire to see Mr. ORMOND'S gift expended in the most useful and economical way in carring out what he conceives to be the intention of the generous donor, viz, the education of the people. It seems to him that this object may be attained more thoroughly by the utilisation of existing national institutions, " than by ' wasting money on the erection of an unnecessary building, and the organi- sation of special class machinery." We have all along been of the same opinion, and we trust it is not too late to secure the adoption of what appears to us to be the sensible course. The proprietors of this journal have given an earnest of their sympathy with Mr ORMOND'S general purpose, by sub- scribing £250 to the fund now being raised to assist in promoting it. Under these circumstances it cannot be sup- posed that in criticising the details of his scheme we are actuated by any unfriendly motives. We think with " Spectator" that the name chosen for the college, taken in conjunction with the fact that a cer- tain section of the working class has been given special representation on its governing body, may possibly have the effect of deterring a large number for whom it is intended from availing them- selves of its advantages Mr. ORMOYD tells us that he wishes the institution to be non political, non sectarian, and open to all who desire facilities for study. The word " working man," however, as our correspondent has pointed out, has a technical meaning, and, despite anything that may be said to the contrary, there are many per- sons-clerks, assistants in shops, &c.; who might feel themselves out of place in in institution apparently set apart, in virtue of its name, for a section of society to which in popular estimation they do not belong. There would be no room for any such feeling if the classes it is proposed to establish were connected with the University and the Techno- logical Museum. These institutions are open to all without distinction of condition or age, and all can freely partake of the benefits they offer without any doubt or hesitancy as to their perfect right to do so. It appears to us that Mr. ORMOND is unduly influenced by what he has seen of a highly suc- cessful establishment in London, which goes by the name of The Working Men's College. There may be reasons exiting in the conditions of English society which tendered it desirable to give that institution a class appellation, but in this thoroughly democratic country, where manual labourers very properly assert an equality in everything and where all have a fair field and no favour, it seems a pity to create distinc- tions even in name. " If it is genuinely '' proposed to extend education to those " who at present cannot command it," then the endowment should be given " not only for the sake of those who " are technically called working men, " but for the benefit of the whole com- " munity. A true educational svstem " Knows nothing of the difference of " classes. Its privileges are open " to all on equal terms . " More over, it is evident that the name given to the London establishment is technically considered, a misnomer. "Mr ORMOND himself tells us that of these who attend that so called Working Men's College, only 36 per cent are men employed in manual pursuits, the rest of the students being persons who, although they toil as hard, or perhaps harder, are not commonly held to belong to the labouring classes. It may be said, however, that no matter whether the London College was widely named or not, there it is \- a separate institution for the pur- pose of furnishing instruction to those who have not been able to obtain it in the ordinary way. True, but ti eio are reasons why a distinct estiblibhinent should bo provided in London which do not apply to Mel bonnie lor instance, the London University is only an examining cor poiation, while the Melbourne Uni- versity is a teaching body, organised at present on a popular basis, and only requiring additional means to provide greater facilities for the acquisition of knowledge. For those who could not go through the ordinary Uni- versity course, evening lectures on history, languages, and science might be arranged, open to matriculated and non matriculated students alike. In connection with these classes might be formed " for the benefit of those who " desire a closer study," and periodi- cally the progress made by those attend- ing could be tested in the usual way. Certificates granted to the deserving by a university recognised thoughout the world would be of far more value to the recipients than any similar documents issued by the governing body of a working men's college. Put a literary and scientific education, such as the University could afford, would not meet all Mr. ORMOND'S views. In addition to languages, mathe- matics, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and " such other branches of instiuction " as will lead to a sound practical know " ledge of scientific subjects," Mr ORMOND would have the college plan of education embrace all subjects which relate to the business of life, "and " which will tend to the industrial " advancement of the country " " And " here," he says, " comes in the techno- '' logical part of the scheme, which is " the theoretical and practical instruc- " tion of artisans in matters pertaining " to their handicrafts " What is to prevent the " theoretical and practical *' insruction" spoken of being given in connexion with the Technological Museum ? Plenty of accommodation and a vast accumulation of specimens and models are available. Classes are already formed, and if they are deficient in any particular, it would be easy to supply all shortcomings were funds available. There would be no difficulty in providing instruction in many mat- ters which would be of the greatest assistance to tradesmen of every descrip- tion. To make provision for syste- matic as distinguished from popular technical instruction, a liberal expendí- ture would probably be required, and this is one of the objects to which Mr. ORMOND'S bounty might well be applied. We are told that "the technical schools " of the Continent, of England, and of "America, are institutions with a regular " courses of two or three years. They " might be described as a ,scientific " method of apprenticing, and they " take all the pupil's time. " We venture to think that if Mr ORMOND could be induced to establish such a school in con- nexion with the Technological Museum, and to provide Ormond lectureships and Ormond scholarships in connexion with the University, he would do more for the advancement of sound learning and tho promotion of good feeling between classes, than could possibly be effected by sinking money in bricks and mortar, and providing a college, which, in name at all ovents, would be dedicated to the service of only one section of the com- munity.

Resolutions will be submitted affirming the desirability of founding a working men's college for the promo- tion of general education and technical training, pledging the meeting to co-operate in the movement, tendering thanks to Mr Ormond for his generous offer of £5,000, and expressing satisfaction at the manner in which the associated trades have mani- fested appreciation of the offer, and shown their intention to assist in carrying out the terms attached to it. As some misapprehension is said to exist as to the effect of the new rule prepared by the judges relating to the managing law clerks, it Bhould be stated what is the object of the rule In October, 18G3, rules were adopted by the judges requiring that in future clerks [before being articled to an attorney Bhould pass the matriculation examination at the UnivorBity, and Bhould also pass other examinations at intervals at the University, and on the completion of the articles should pass a final examination in law before the board of examiners At that time there were a number of clerks who considered that they ought to be allowed to be articled without undergoing the matri- culation examination, and the new rule is intended to relieve them of that and of the uecesBily of pnssing the examination in con stitutional law. It is therefore pro vided that in the case of those clerks that if they have remained continu on el y in the profession since 18G3 and have been managing clerke for 10 years they may be allowed on application to tbeCourtor a judge to be articled to an attorney. A month s notice of the application must be given to the secretary of the board of ex aminers The candidates muet afterwards paBB two examinations in law at the Uni versity, and at the conclusion of the articles pass the final examination before the board, and must have a certificate in their favour Bigned by three attorneys The number affected by this rulo is limited An application was made yesterday to the Supreme Court to quash an order by the justices at Apsley forfeiting a licence held by a Mrs Mary Ann Botterill to a public house known as the Border Inn The licence waa forfeited on the grounds that ahe had per- mitted an unlicensed person to be in effect the keeper thereof. There had been some agree ment fur the aale of the hotel to one Spangenberg, who appliod for a transfer, which waa refused It was said for the prosecution that Spangenberg afterwards remained in possession, and virtually conducted the house, and that Mra Botterill had vacated the place It was urged for the defence that there waa no evi dence that Spangenberg had conducted the house Tho Court held that there was evi- dence for the justices, and refused the appli- cation. It waa also sought to compol the polieo magistrate to hear an application for the transfer of the licence from Mrs. Botterill to Spangenberg. This application for the transfer had been heard by the police magi- strate on tho aame day as the case against Mrs Botterill The magistrate did not take any evidence, but said that he did not approve of the applicant, and refused the application It waa contended that the magistrate Bhould hear evidence before he decided not to ap provo of the applicant The Court, how- ever, thought that he could use the informa tion he had acquired otherwise, and therefore refused to compel him to rehear the case. In the Supreme Court yesterdav an action Hails v. Aspmall waa heard The plain tiff Bued the defendant for renta i of some property at Sandhurst The de fendant pleaded that the land waa not the plaintiff a, and claimed a eet off for money paid to the plaintiff. Tho plaintiff replied to the effect that these points hod already been determined by the judge of the County Court Aspmall had sued Marks to compol him to specifically perform a contract for the sale to him of the premises referred to, alleging that the contract bad been made, that money bad been paid, that Aspmall had gono into possession, and had spent largo aums of money in improving the eatate The j udgo of the County Court dismissed that suit, aud Marka contended that the questions could not be reopened in the present action. Ou the other hand it was submitted that as it was not material to the equity suit whether the purchase money had been paid, it could not be said that the matter had been deter mined, and it could therefore be again dis cusBed. The Court held with the view urged for Marks, and gave judgment for him The curator of intestates has obtained from Mr. Justice Molesworth administration to the eBtate of one Thomas Burke, a labourer, under somewhat Bingular circumstances. It appeared that Burke had been for several j cars prior to 1871 in the Employment of Mr Alfred G. Chenory, of Delatite Station. He deposited money at various banks from year to year, and in 1 ebruarj, 187'', ho had on deposit at tho Bank of Aus tralasia £530, at tho Commercial Bank £?¡11, at the Melbourne Banking Cor poration £300, and at the Union Bank £283 The deposits were for 12 months, ending 11th Tebruary, lSbO. _rora that date nothing farther waa heard of him, and it was found impossible to trace his subsequent movements, although the polieo bad made every inquiry On the 20th May, 1881, a canvaa bag was found by a boy at the Little Uiver, and this bag on examination was found to contain the deposit receipts for tho bums mentioned. Turther efforts were made to find Burke, hut without succeaB, and the conclusion arrived at was that he had been drowned m the river, whilst the deposit receipts were current Ho had loft no rela lives in the colony, nor, so far as could be ascertained, elsewhere, and the curator there- fore sought for administration of his estate to be granti d to him The application was granted 'Hie curator of intestate estates has ob- tained rules to administer the estates of the following - Jamea Beatie, of Devon, near \arram Yarram, died July 28, 1877, £170, 1 homas Polsue, Maldon,died October b,137'', £ J1 las , Thomas Burke, Ballarat, died on or before lebruary 11, ISbO, £1 iOb 10s , Lara Petersen Dahl, Neyo, Bornholm, Denmark, died March 31, 1881, £U0 17s Id John Spain, Pennyweight, near Strathloddon, died December2b, 1881, £21 2a ¡J , Kate Bourke, lithgow, NSW,, died March 22, 18s2, £11 Us bd , Andrew Belcher, Melbourne, died March 10,1882, £o0 , Robt Adair Kennedj, 1 merald hill, died May 20 1S82, £l,10b 9s , I obert Blake, Hamilton, died May 22, 1832 M3 The Williamstown Artillery CorpB were r fficially inspected last uie,ht by Colonel Mair pnd Major Heath One hundred and seven- teen of the rank and iile, five sorgeauts, a d the following officers wera present -M jor Doucb, Lieutenant Siugleton, and Captains Salmon, Perrin, and lerguson Colonel Mair, at the close of the mapee', on, expre33ei satisfaction with the men s proficiency in dril1 and their general appearance PersonBare frequentb excused from serving on a jurj on the ground of Bickness, but an incident which occurred recently in the ( cunty Court shows that this privilege is BometimeB liable to abuse On the r ame of a certain juror Lemg called, ho Mated that ho was Buffering from illness which incapacitated him from attending the court, and his Honour Judge Cope conso quentl} discharged him Some suspicion as to the bona fides of the excuse having arisen, his Honour caused inquiries to be made through the police, the result of which was to BIIOW that the plea of the juryman in question was a mere artifice to avoido attendance, and the offender was brought before hia Honour ludge Cope, who, after administering a severe reprimand, ordered him to serve on the jury without fee The Mayor of Prahran (Mr M H Davioa) liab convened a public meeting, to be held at the City Courthouse, Prahran, on Tuesday evening next, for the purpose of urging the Minister of Education to make the hours for pulling for boards of advice elections the eame as at Parliamentary and municipal elections The requisition in compliance with which the meeting is called is signed by the Mayor of Melbourne, the Hon J Bal four, M L C , lion W A Zoal, M.L C , Mr R Harper, M L A , and a number of residents of Prahran, Windsor, South Yarra, and Toorak.

The knife was not or dmarilj a dangerous weapon, being portion of the blade of an old table knife, fastened with a wooden handle, and wrapped round with Btring, such as the prisoners are some times allowed for cutting tobacco , but the blade, which waa about 2m in length, had been sharpened until the edge was almost as keen as the ra/or with which Braxton pre- viously attempted to kill himself, and there can be little room for doubting that the pri Boner intended to frustrate the law Referring to the latest project of M do Les ecpB for the Hooding of the desert of Sahara, tho_)aii;/_v'citsremarks -"From theGulf of Gabes there opens weBtwarda through Tunis and Algeria, and with some mtervala right up to the borders of Morocco, a chain of depressions to which the terms eliott and scbUui are locally applied. The first and largest of these ia comparatively close to the eea, and stretches right across the nominal dominiona of Franco'a new ally, the Bey of Tunis. Thia ia known as the Chott Kcbir Weat of it comes the Chott el Gharnia, and west of that again (both being in Algona proper) the Chott Melrhir These with some smaller ones complete the series in this part. These chotts are not exactly marshes, but rather have the appearance and characteristics of the dried up boas of lakes The plan of flood ing them is not merely rocommended by the prospect of facilitating communication be- tween the shores of the new lake, though thiB of itself ia not an inconsiderable advau tage , but all the scientific investigations yet made, and especially thoso of Mr. Largeau, show that at no very distant period this part ot the Sahara waa far from being the arid I desert which it now is. There were great rivers whose beds are Btill perfectly traceable, ' and in whose course well-digging is still a profitable occupation. When instead of the present burning waste of the chotts there ia substituted a great expanse of water, the consequent évaporât.on will, it is calcu- lated, restore fertility and vegetation to the borders (which even at present are fertile enough and even frequently thickly wooded wherever water is available). The presence of wood will, in its tarn, have the natural effect of regulating and aystematismg the rainfall, which is all that is needed to restore the rivers and make the country flourish This, at least, is the argument for «flooding the chotta, and though it cannot be said that the speculation would bo one in which it would bo well for widows and orphans to ombark their pro perty, there is nothing in it intrinsically abBurd ' "'J ho immigration into the UnitedStates for April," wntea the New York Tribune, "waa unprecedentodly heavy.
