I see imid the fields of Ayr A ploughman, Who, ia foal or feir, -; ?-' Sings at his task, ^ -? ? - So dear we kaow not if it is- : The laverock's song we hear or his, Nor care to ask. For him the ploughing of those fields A more ethereal harvest yields Than sheaves of grain : Songs flush with purple bloom the rye ; The plover's call, the curlew's cry, : Sing in ids brain. Touohed by his hand, the *ay-side weed Becomes a flower; the lowliest reed Beeide the stream Is clothed with beauty; goree and gross A»d heather, where his footsteps pass, The brighter seem. He sings of love.twhose'flame illumes The darkness of lone cottage rooms ; He feels the force , The treacherous under-tow and stress, Of wayward passions, and no less The keen remorse. At moments, meriting with his fate, ' His voice is harsh, but not with hate ; The brush- wood hung : ?_ Above the tavern door lets fall , Its bitter leaf , its drop ofgaU, ' ~ Upon his tongue. ./ But «till the burden of his song . Is love of right, disdain of wrong;; its master chords Are- Manhood, Freedom, Brotherhood ; . Its discards bnt an interlude Between the words. , . And then io die so young and leave - Unfinished what he. might achieve! . Tet better sure Is this than wandering up and do wn, An old man, in a oountry town, Infirm and poor. For now lie haunts his native land As an immortal youth; his hand Guides every plough ;: He site beside each ingle-nook ; His voice is in each rushing brook, Each rustling bough. His presence haunts this room to-night, ? A form of mingled mist and light, From that far coast. , Welcome beneath this roof of mine ! Welcome! this vacant chair is thine, ' Dear guest and ghost!
