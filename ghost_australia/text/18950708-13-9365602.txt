NEWS BY THE MAIL TOPICS OF THE WEEK. . (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON. MAY 31. Lord Rosebery has committed another crime! Not in the field of politics even though as Prime Minister He is the greatest failure ever life and suite Addington-but his last offence has been upon the racecourse The Nonconformist conscience throughout the British isles woke upon 'Thursday) morning to find that the Prime Minister had won another Derby That same conscience was terribly) disturbed a year ago, when Lord Rosebery won the blue riband of the turf with Ladas, and we all remember how some of the Radical supporters of the Ministry stamped and raged and even 'stumped against their sinful leader Now that Lord Goschen) has gone one we horse b) winning another Derby, the inconsistent entity is simply dazed The sittings of Parliament during the past week have brought no fresh item of cn couragement to the Ministry The Government have introduced a very little bill to give power for increasing the number of colonial judges to sit in the Privy Council, but there are no financial provisions for those judges who are apparently intended to take a back seat The Government have also got through two or three clauses of the Welsh Church Bill It was noticed in the discussion upon the Welsh Church Hill this week that the Goverment, for the first time, introduced the closure in regard to that measure Two private bills have been introduced into Parliament which deserve a passing notice One is a remanet from last year, the lower Bridge Bill of the London County Council In order to pass this measure the progressive party in the council under the influence of their disasters at the recent elections have agreed to introduce the principle of ' worsement as well as " better ment 'The marvel is that they have never done it before lins opens the way to the equitable settlement of large questions of principle in the future. The other measure to which I have referred is the Divorce Amendment Bill, which Lord Halifax has in produced, in order to please the church union part), with the object of relieving ministers of the Church of England from the compulsion to permit the use of their churches for the performance of marriages of persons who have been divorced on the ground of his or her adultery. The bill was supported by the 1 episcopal bench and Lord Salisbury) Even the Lord Chancellor was not opposed to it, and if the Nonconformists in the Lower House permit the measure to become law, divorcees will in future be compelled to use the registrars office for the purposes of marriage. 'The introduction of this measure may be traced to the recent scandal at one of the churches in the West and Last Friday night, the House of Commons was invited by Sir Jos Pease and Mr John 1 His to set aside the report of the Opium Commission 'These two gentlemen made a furious attack upon the commissioners on the ground that they had allowed themselves to be influenced by the Indian Government, which had employed all its power and cunning- in providing packed and selected witnesses against the anti opium view further, the chairman Lord Brassey, was specially) accused of winding up the case of the Anti opium party before they had presented all their witnesses Mr H H 1 ovv 1er (Secretary of State for India), though a Dissenter, and believed at one time to be tainted by the anti opium crude, made a brilliant defence of the Indian Government, and bore evidence to the completenesS of the defeat of the anti- opium case In the end the House closure the debate, and negatived Sir J Peases pro ] position by 170 to 59 Among the political speeches of the week have been a clever attack by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain upon the Government for not going out of office, and an equally clever de lence of the Ministry by Mr John Moran). Mr. Morley) declared that the Government in tended to remain in office as long as they commanded the support of the Commons He prophesied that the Welsh Church and the Irish Land Bills would be carried through the Lower House before the end of July, and his decisive declaration in favour of the Local Veto Bill is considered to indicate the possibility of the Government going to the country upon this measure. Mr. Morley's statements respecting Home Rule are rather interesting Home Rule, he said, was not the ghost of a departed hope, but a corporeal and substantial night). Neither, he nor his colleagues would go to the country upon any other understanding or foot ing than that of concession of self government to Ireland. Perhaps it was in order to carry out Mr Morley's apparently minimised ideas of Home Rule that Mr. ShuivLefeue, on behalf of the Government, supported a bill introduced into the Commons on the very night Mr. Morn) was BpeaUiiiB for the purpose of establishing county) councils in Ireland, This was to be done on the model of the English and Scotch plan, on the initiation of the Lord Lieutenant, That is to say, power was to be given to the Lord Lieutenant to call county councils into existence, whenever or wherever he liked on the English model Mr Balfour made merry) over legislation in reference," but he did not provide against the bill, on the ground that he had no objection to its principle. 'The charges against Oscar Wilde and Taylor, which lune occupied much public attention for some) weeks, was brought home to those persons on Saturday) last, and the prisoners were both nurtured to one years imprisonment with- hard labour Mr Justice Wills took a in are His iona view of the east) than Mr Justice (hanks had done at the first Laurine, and the result was also largely due to the more combative numide of Sir 1 lot wood Solicitor (JP a lad, who on this occasion appeared, to conduct the prosecution Mr liiHlni Wills expressed his great regret that he could not give a dinner audience It is engineering of the met star) forward punish austin and li list is that at the sessions at which he did and I Taylor will tric 1 two other pi farms or supposed respectability) were found (unit) of a similar offence
