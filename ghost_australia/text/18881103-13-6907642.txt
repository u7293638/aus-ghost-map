EUROPEAN AFFAIRS. (From O ob ConniapONiiENT.) LONDON, Sept. 21. As I write the Austrian Foreign Minister, Kalnoky, with the German representative at the Vatican, is the guest of the German Chancellor at Friedrichsruhe Count Kalnoky arrived stone on Tuesday morning and Herr Schlosser went up from Berlin the same evening It would appear that the visit of the German Emperor to the court of Italy is producing embarrassments The Pope is probably making difficulty. But Count Kalnoky can, of course, have little direct concern in this His chief business must be of another character What it is, however, is a mystery The official papers in Berlin and Vienna say It is " the usual thing ' -the usual summer visit neither more nor less If we may believe them, it has no sort of significance, save as showing what we already know - the maintenance unimpaired of the mid European alliance The Russian press, speaking with one voice, have, however, quite another account to give of the reason of the meeting They say that it has been arranged for the discussion of the Bulgarian question, and in order to give the German Chancellor an opportunity of carrying out the promise of the Emperor William to the Czar at St Petersburg recently, that he would seek to induce his Austrian ally to accept the Russian view concerning the Balkan Principality On the other hand, the Cologne Gazette has an important article combatting this action which it said would surely prevail-in advance It implies that no promise has been given to Russia to arrange a modus vivendi, and says, in so many words, that whilst Russia will always find a cover laid for her at the German table, she cannot hope to make her re entrance into the hospitable German house subject to the condition that Germany shall first of all turn out of doors her best friends 'Tor, on the one hand, confidence in the honesty and trust worthiness of Russian policy has in Germany sunk to a very low ebb, while on the other the thought that Germany and Austria are bound to stand shoulder to shoulder, in weal and woe, line penetrated the German mind more deeply than any other political principle has ever done before ' And this is about all that can be said of the discussions at Friedrichsruh Probability would seem to suggest that something important did take place at St Petersburg, and the amity of the native press would indicate that that something was in the nature of a promise to do what was possible to arrange affairs between Russia and Austria. Obviously this, difficulties it may be is the only way to avoid inga war between Russia and Austria, and there is really no reason why the German Chancellor should not even now be attempting to feel his way to the task which almost in evitably lies before him. Austrian politicians tell us that Count Kalnoky would not listen to suggestions on this head, but that depends upon the character of the suggestions. 'The German Chancellor is an astute personage, and what seems to be an insuperable difficulty to the ordinary mind is possibly matter of comparatively easy solution to him One thing is pretty certain, that Bulgaria and Prince Ferdinand especially, have nothing to gain by anything which may happen nt 1 riednehsruhe Anything which Count Karl note) may concede to Russia would be so much to the prejudice of the Principality This is so obvious that I need hardly pursue the matter Happily, the circumstances of Bulgaria are not less favourable The Prince goes his way apparently without uneasiness, whilst M btnmhuloff keeps a firm hand on things generally at Sofia. Perhaps there is one possibility of danger The Macedonians are again in a state of acute notation, and the large Bulgarian population of the province naturally finds a ready ear for its grievances among its countrymen beyond the 1 Turkish border This, indeed, is seen in the way the Bulgarian press are now writing on the Mace donian question, and the way in which not only they, but the Bulgarian residents at Constantinople, are pressing the Porte to carry out in Macedonia the stipulations of the Berlin Treaty The poor Sultan is menaced with a revolt as the price of failure to do their bidding He has a good many people to please in Macedonia, and if one thing is clearer than another it is that, while all these people call upon him to give them autonomy as promised, they are each of them at des perate feud one with another The 'Turk is not popular in Macedonia it is true, but he is not half so hated by the mass of the people as the various nationalities within the province hale one another And this is the chief culty An outbreak among the factions would be as bad as a revolution against the Sovereign-that is so far as the Sovereign is concerned Either of these things would not as the spark which would set the whole Fast in a blue Naturally the situation is causing apprehension, and the Bulgarian Government has been asked to walk warily in dealing with the brethren beyond the frontier Apart from this, things promise well in the Principality) A bountiful harvest has been gathered, and the Government have done a sensible and politic thing in so lowering the freights on the Varna railway as to greatly increase the trade are passing down the line from the interior to the coast, There seems no reason why the great wheat growing capacities of Bulgaria should not be fully exploited, or why Value should not take some of the vast wheat trade of Odessa and other of the Russian ports on the Black Sea It is satisfactory to note, too, that M Starabutoff'a agents continue to make satisfactory headway against the brigandage which has latterly given such cause of offence in the neighbourhood of belive. The Government have no doubt still plenty of difficulties, internal and external But they keep their heads well above water, and the last four stratagem of the enemy-the firing at M Nncevíes-took place In Roumania the Government of King Charles will no doubt see to it that the assassin, who happily failed in his plot, does not return to Bucharest for shelter Before leaving the subject I must tell you of a remarkable incident in Croatia You will have heard something of it by telegraph Croatia is part of the Kingdom of Hungary, but the people are Slavs, and have the Slaves antipathy to the Maygnrs. 'There has been constant friction between the province and Hungary proper, and these racial differences have been steadily fostered by the Prince Bishop of Croatia, tile powerful Strossmujer A Catholic, the Bishop was one of the most ardent opponents of the promulgation of the doctrine of infallibility, and he has always been a warm advocate of the reunion of the Greek and Latin churches He has latterly come to believe that this partial reunion of Christendom can only be looked for Through the action of Russia. No doubt this is the natural idea of a Slav Consequently, when the Greek Church was the other day celebrating at Kieff the ninth centenary of the introduction of Christianity into Russia, Bishop Strossmayer telegraphed his congratu lations, and added a prayer for blessing on the universal mission which God had designed Russia to fulfil in the world " This telegram being sent back to Vienna and Pesth, created vast astonishment alike among the public and the official world, including the Court The Emperor was highly incensed at the conduct of the Bishop, and having to go last week to Croatia to attend the military manoeuvres he took occasion during a reception to publicly rebuke the bishop for " the culpable step you have taken against the church and the state The bishop replied that his conscience was clear of the offence, but the Emperor turned his back upon the prelate and would not listen to him When Bishop Strossmayer subsequently sought an interview with Crown Prince Rudolph, he was denied admission On his way home the bishop, who is very popular, was treated as a hero and martyr by the very same people who had just been giving their welcomes to the Emperor Naturally), they had given further offence, and the bishop had been summoned to Rome to give an explanation to his ecclesiastical superior lbs Pope cannot afford to neglect a hint from the Court of Vienna, and it is not at all unlikely that the upshot of this affair will be found in tnedisappearanceofbtroaamayer from Croatia. The Hungarians are, of course, highly delighted with the stern rebuke which has fallen upon the bishop, and Herrlisza (the Premier) declared the other day that it would be well if the same cold douche could be given to others who so conducted these nationalist propaganda But in Russia the treatment of Bishop Strossmayer is regarded as a chastisement to the Slav Patton and threats are numerous in the public press It is said generally that the incident is a clear example of the animosity of Austria, and that a repetition of this sort of thing in any form whatever would put a termination to the long period of patience which Russia has sent in regard to Austria. Meantime the Massowah question has remained in the background Whether by advice of his allies or for reasons of his own is not clear, but we have heard nothing of Signor Crispi I mean nothing of the old bellicose order On the other hand, he is said to have answered a protest purporting to have been sent him by the French Revolutionary (Felix Parlby ameek letter, in which he declares that he is not and never has been the enemy of any neighbouring country, least of all of France, further, that he will never enter on a defensive war, and that his policy is defensive only and one of liberty. I need hardly add after this that Signor Crispi has not resumed his war of despatches with M Goblet, the precise position of the Massowah question is, indeed, not clear, but it would seem that it is "drilling." The Italian Premier has found a good deal of criticism in his own country for his famous despatches. We have evidence of this in a letter published by the Paris Steele- there pasted organ of M Carnot in which General Carte, a member of the Italian Senate, says of Signor Crispi that he well knows that Italy will not easily allow herself to be in volved in a policy of adventure for which neither the King nor the people have any liking It is admitted that General Carte speaks for a good many of his country men His warnings to France concerning the fatality of a Russian alliance are very pointed, and his recommendation that she should cease the preparation for the matches, and make close friendship with England, with whom she is connected by so many important ties of commerce and civilisation, is be sensible that it is quite unlikely France will do anything of the sort I he possession of the new Le best man, izine mile and! a smokeless power-the Secrets of which are carefully kept-make the French not a little confident just now, and there is a suspicion that with this superiority of armament she would not too readily decline any challenge which might issue from Berlin or elsewhere But if I France and Italy say less of Massowah, the bark decline to budge from the attitude of his note to the Powers, You are aware of course, that the Pushua keep the Suez Canal convention (on which England and France have long come to an agreement under their thumb, without making due ratification We now hear that there is a firm determination at the Porte to attach to this convention a declaration explaining the Turkish con attraction of article 10 to which appeal has been made by Signor Crispi in favoured the policy of his Government in the Red Sea I his, I take it, is as much as to say that the Sultan will re- affirm his sovereignty over Massowah and those other places which have fallen under the rule of It is) And this if it is persisted in, though it may find backers in Russia and France, will certainly produce trouble for the poor Suit in It is however, difficult to believe that the Sultan will held by his threat. In Germany the young 1 emperor has been engaged in his favourite occupation of review ing his splendid forces He divides his favours equally between the navy and the army, and is showing an amount of energy which is surprising everybody, including possibly, there scurrilous people at Paris who say he is suffering from a mysterious disease The great or the Kaiser manoeuvres had just been concluded in the province of Brandenburg the Archduke Albrecht, of Austria, known in his own country as "the Victor of Custozza was present among the distinguished foreign guests, to the great satisfaction of the Berliners The Prince took many years to get over the events of 1866 and has not been in Berlin since 1884 Naturally his record hutton, and the fact that he has become an adherent of the Austro-German side race, are very much to the taste of the Berlin public the manner rest have been marked by the in troduction our new knapsack and other persons equipments for the industry The new drill regulations for this arm-the one lead) which the great new liner, Frederick the Hurd, just deceased has left to the German people are to be begun next month, when the new recruits come to the standard Great things are expected from them We hear less directly that the German navy is to be increased, "in view of the completion of the Talbot and Baltic Canal and other contingencies which need not be more particularly specified It is pleasant to find that the 1 Emperor continues to drift away from his former reactionary views He is not the sort of man to run into the opposite extreme, but he might have stayed where he was Happily this is not so In receiving on address recently from the Evangelical Alliance, he said he had concluded that the alliance would not refuse to respect the religious convictions of its opponents, but would exercise the toll mice it dictated Another illustration of the Emperor a determination. to shake off his early extreme theories is found in the fact that he has just confirmed the appointment of Professor liar week to the chair of church history and dogma in the University of Berlin, against the protest of the senior council of the Evangelical Church, who dislike Harnnck's theology It would seem, ton, that the Emperor is on better terms with his mother, the 1 mpross Frederick He has, at any rate, just presented her with the Castle of Erin berg, in the Taurus Mountains, The place cost His Majesty over £25 000 Pending the re assembling of the Chambers there is something likedulnesain Paris itself General Boulanger has taken himself off none knows where He has been reported at Hamburg, at Christiania, at Duchy in Switzerland, in Madrid, and finally at Tangiers The General is certainly able to preserve his incognito when he desires it We hear that when the Chambersro assemble at the beginning of next month his sup porters or one of them-will move to re- instate him in the army But this would be the result-the removal of the General from the Chamber Plainly, he would have to resign his seat of seats in Parliament, in the w. hole the Government might do worse than accept a motion of this sort if it is made It would, at any rate, lay the Boulangist ghost. Meantime the President of the Republic has been spending part of his holiday in making a tour of Normandy M Carnot was everywhere well received by a population which is not enthusiastically Ra publican-a fact which says much for his personal qualities and the prestige of his office. M Floquet, being in the Presidential train, was little noticed, to the great mortification, as it is said, of the Premier Of course there were the usual banquets and receptions. At Cherbourg, M Carnot, speaking to representatives of the navy, said the Government were well aware that they could count upon it In all circumstances. The Chambers were equally assured of this, and that was why they would never hesitate to make any sacrifices to give it everything it ought to have At Havre, the British Consul presented the consular body, and the President, in reply, said he was the more touched by this compliment from the fact that the sentiments had been expressed by the representative of a neighbouring nation which is our friend ' Since the President has returned to For faithless the Budget Committee upon an examination of the naval estimates have reduced them by a total of 8,000,000 francs This is hardly fulfilling the promise of the Cherbourg speech which the Pall Mall Gazette held up as an example to the British taxpayer A bad harvest is however, rather frightening those who have control of the public purse Already there has been a rapid and serious rise in the price of bread and at Se Derna and St, Ouen the municipalities have intervened, and arbitrarily fixed the price at which bread shall be sold to the people whilst in Paris itself a large sum has been set apart by the town council (with the consent of the governor, for a full distribution of bread to the poor. The Government have, however declined to suspend the collection of the import duty on cereals Don Carlos the Spanish Pretender has come out of his obscurity at Venice to launch a sort of manifesto there is just now in France a mania for creating statues and a monument to the Comte de Chambord has been actually set up at Sainte Ann d A.way This has given Don Carlos an opportunity of writing to a local magnate to thank those who have thus honoured his relative and to repeat quite unnecessarily that whilst he does not claim the throne of France I am in Spain the King of all the national liberties but I never will be King of the Revolution The Royal divorce case threatens to precipitate a Ministerial crisis at Belgrade It is understood that the King wants more pliable Ministers and it is noticed that one of the Bishops of the Holy Synod who is note riously friendly to the Queen has been replaced by another prelate The Queens friends in official positions are generally suffering prejudice Meantime the King is at Reichenberg surrounded by numerous advisers both interested and otherwise The Queen has had an agreeable sojourn at Bucharest and has quite recently been received by the King and Queen of Roumania aSmara. The Roumanian Chambers have been dissolved and a general election will take place in about a months time M Bratiano hopes in this opportunity to arrive once more on the top of the wave He has unfortunate for himself donegreatprejud ce to his chance by seeking to throw the responsibility for the present direction of the foreign policy of the country which of course makes for the mi i European Powers upon the 1 ing M Bratiano desires to make the most of both worlds and this is not agree able to his countrymen who are in the mass much less of favourable to Russia than he seems to think It may be added here that King Charles will go to Vienna at the request of the Emperor of Austria during the visit of the Emperor William Russia above all the countries of Europe has been favoured with a magnificent Harvest And apart from this the first half of the year has witnessed throughout the empire a remarkable revival of trade The trouble has gone up in value from 1s. 6d to 2s , a remarkable advance and it has actually become necessary to issue a large amount of paper money this time against the gold equivalent -in order to faculty le circus lion Altogether the c's are so prosperous that the Czar to) act ally be able to afford himself the luxury of a war next spring
