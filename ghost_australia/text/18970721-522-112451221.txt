TH11EE FIGURES IN SHROUDS. ;^Probal)ly fow persons would be sufficiently strong minded to pass a solitary night in a room Baid to be a haunted without experiencing some disagreeable nerve shocks. Lady Burton tells a story of a Friend of hers (Winwuod Reade, the author), who put this /act to the test. Tieade was a man of strong nerve and undoubted courage, " so brave that he could heard to tell this story," is Lady Bur ton's comment. While travelling, either in Africa or India (Lady Button is uncertain about the exact locality), Keade was told that a certain bunga low was uninhabitable, as it was hauuted by the ghosts of three surgeons who had died there of cholera, and who, each midnight, entered one of the rooms (which had glass doors open ing out into the compound), arrayed in their winding sheets. Wishing to test the truth of this story, the author took up his abode in the haunted room one night, armed with a gun and plenty of lights and books. His native servant absolutely refused to enter the bungalow with him, but consented to re main outside on the roof, also armed with a gua. Keade occupied himself with his books, and all was quiet until the stroke of twelve, when, " with a loud noise, the glass flew open, and three figures, in while shrouds, stepped into the room." On Lady Button's inquiring if tho spectator dad tested if the apparitions were practical jokers or supernatural visitors, Keade caudidly replied : " To tell you the truth, I fainted dead off, and dropped my gun ; and, as soon as I came to myself, I called the boy down from the roof, and made off as fast as I. could." - " Globe."
