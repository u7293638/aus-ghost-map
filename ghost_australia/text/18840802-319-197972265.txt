SELECT POETRY. ECHOES. Olttlmcs when even's scarlet flag .' Floats from the crest of Ufotant wood?) Anil over moorland waato and crag A weary, voiceless sorrow broods, Around mo hover to aud fro Tbe ghosts of songs heard Ions ago. And often, midst tho rush of wheels, Of passing and repassing foot, When half a headlong city reels Triumphant down tho noontide street, Abovo tho tumult of the throngs 1 hoar again the smno old songs. Rest and Unrest — 'tis strange that yo, Who He apart as polo from polo, Should sway with ono strong sovereignty Tho secret Issues of tho soul ; Strange that yoboth should hold tho keys Of prisoned tender memories. It may be, when tho landscape's rim Is red and slumberous round tho west, Tho spirit too grows still and dim, And turns In half unconscious quest To those forgotten lullabies That whilom closed tho iufant's eyes. ' And maybo, when tho city mart Roars with its fullest, loudest tide, Tho spirit loses holm and chart, . , And on an InBtant, terrified, lias fled across the space of years To notes that banish childhood's fears. Wo know not— but 'tis swcot to know Dead hours still haunt tho living day. And swoet to hopo that, when tho slow Sure message bockons ua away, ' Tho past may send somo tuneful breath To echo round the bed of death,- — Chambers's Journal.
