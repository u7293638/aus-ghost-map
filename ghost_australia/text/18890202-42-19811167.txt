A WEIRD STORY. The N. C. Daily News translates from the Hu-pao the following weird story told by a traveller from the wilds of Kwangsi:—"A native's wife was taken very ill, and before she died she told her husband (with whom she had lived on the best terms, bearing him one son), 41 have a secret to confide to you, which I never told before, for your wsk^aWApir^Mi child's. When I die do n9k^fi^sßM^isl«^,U. but leave it for a timeyoiuvpfflhe mounWhv^ Have two live fowls ready ia the house, for N> after I have been dead lb(T days {)tf»l£ Wiuea to tbe realm of living mefeftro time, aneTcoina back to our home. Fear nqyJ^MmQ maketof y wards tho child offer me theHf^teSNSf ajneT^y> \ that you yourself will tend the inraw^iniiharlr need not be anxious, that between the dead and the living a gulf is fixed, and I should rest among tho departed and not come back to trouble the child. I will look at you fixedly for a spell, take the fowls, strangle them and begone, never to return. My body will not lie down again in its coffin, but will be transformed into a living tiger, and if hereafter you come out to the placs and sco the clothing lying by the coffin, you will know that my words have oome true.' Holding her husband's hand, she expired. The ghost appeared at due date, did as the living wife had foretold, and disappeared in the jungle; and when the man visited the coffin some days after, he found the cast-off graro-clothes, and wept when he thought of their former happy life together, and her strango fate. While drinking his tears, he saw a tigress stalk from the itingle, and knew it was his wife transformed into a new existenoe. Gently he stroked its striped back, and with a melancholy roar it bounded away. No deed of blood was ever known to be wrought by this gentlest of tigresses on the mountain, and the ohild^ has grown up and prospers. Truly a strange story."
