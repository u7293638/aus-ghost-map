On Sunday evening the re - i ,-imains of the deceased clargyman, who was, at the 'time 'of His death, connected with St. Benedict's ' distriot?' . were brought to the parish church. ('?A. mufiied peal was rung en Sunday, night; ? and 'cat both morning and evening services -Mi88-'Healy played the Dead March in Saul.

It v/ao covered by a black velvet palt and on it were placed the biretta and stole worn by tho deceased, also a chalico and largo crono formed of Enow-white cameliaa, together v/ibh wroafehe of immortelles'. During tho oolomn service his Grace tiddressod tho congregation, and asked them to join with .the clergy in praying for the repoee of fcho soul of the good father v.-ho had been taken from amongst them. Death camo like a thief in bho niglit, bringing sadness and sorrow with it, and io wao necoaaary for a priest who had so muny weighty responsibilities, so many sacred obligations, bo many duties to fulfil, to bo always prepared for the summons calliDg him to tho preaonoe of the Almighty, It 'wa8J'»''con8blihg*'thihg-t'oi'Kn6W''tKali ? the 'good and. useful life.1 of; the priest^ who had laboured lamongst them ;but who', was npLW^no more — -a life devoted to Q-odand; to th'eservice of His Church v— had been; closed by a peaceful and happy death. . The good father had come out to this country for the. benefit of his health. He was engaged on a mission at Plymouth, and thinking that the : Australian. ,: climate would impi'ove his failing health, he camo to, the archdiocese and had since laboured here with great zeal and self-sacrifice, aetive in the cause of religion till the last, till the hand of death was upon him. The people of St. Mary's and St. Benedict's,who knew him best, and whose confidence and affection,! he had won, uouiu tesury, no - uis zeai ana ms courage, his generous nature, and his' gentleness, and amiability of manner. , He died young, far away from his home and from those neareot and dearest lo him, but he was loved here by. all who knew him. He, reoeived his Grace's; bloss ing a few hours before his soul departed, and they would best. show their affection for the de ceased, and show some recognition of his labours in their behalf, , by praying to the Almighty G-od to. deal. mercifully with him, and to grant etsrnal repose to his soul.
