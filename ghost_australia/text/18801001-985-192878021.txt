NEW HOSPITAL SITE AT ARMI DALE. To the Editors of the Armidale Express. Gentlemen—This vexed question of the choice of site is assuming an alarming as pect. The feelings of the Hospital Com mittee have reached such a height as may result in the whole code of our Municipal Laws being expunged from the Statute Books of the colony, the present Govern- ^ ment turned out of office, Sir Henry ' ParkeB burned in effigy, and in all likeli-1 hood the Governor re- called. (Metropoli-j tan papers, please copy-) The Hospital! ghost has been lately seen at the corner of] Beardy and Rusden streets, and fre-j quently heard across, the Racecourse, and in RnBden-street, near Gordon's, crying! out, to the great annoyance of the resi dents in these parts, "The Lord preserve! and Gave me from my friends !"■ —Yours.! &c;„ .. AN OUTSIDER^ A most singular case of supposed mur der (says the 'Forbes and Parkes Ga zette' of the 24th) is reported from Con dobolin, and yesterday Mr. Dalton, P.M., started from Forbes to investigate the matter. At present nothing is known save that a man has mysteriously disap peared, and his mates have been arrested on suspicion of having done away with him, it being known thfc$ he was in pos session of a considerable sum of money. As far as can be learned, the facts are as follow :—Last Monday week four men who had been engaged shearing stopped at M'Lesn's hotel, and one of them said he had been robbed, mentioning the amount. The police, doubting his story, searched him, and found the sum he had alleged he had lost, in his pockets. The four departed in company, and the follow ing day the horse, saddle, and swag of the man, who had before stated he had been robbed, were found near the river bank, a few miles above Eubalong. Informa tion was given to the police ; but up to the time of our going to press, we had re ceived no tidings of his being found. The other three men were arrested at Mickabil on suspicion.
