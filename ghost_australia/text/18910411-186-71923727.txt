The fire of the fever -was low, not » great flame, blazing and devouring, bat it west an and an. The third week passed, and the fourth, with renewed and disappointed CTWTtaiimw of a change, but none came. 'It will run out die six weeks,' mid the doctor. 'And then ? T' Ah, who could Bay. The eood doctor, who bad taken eat* mf Mar. all his life, tamed away from the question. 'It all depends upon hu strength,' he Baid. His strength! but he had no strength. He was as weak as a chad. The nnrselif ted him in her arms like an infant ? a skeleton, with long, long limbs. It seemed a ftrce to speak of his strength, as if there was any hope in that. Duke had gone away before tius time— his leave bad come to an end, and he had been allowed to come in and say good-bye to his cousin. ' I thought you would have been up and about before I went,' said Duke, blustering a little to keep himself tan crying. ' You are a Luy beggar, to be lying there with nothing the matter. I don't think there's anything the matter with you. You just like to lie there and keep us nil slaving attendance. You know you were always a Jazy beggar.' Mar. did nothing bnt smile, as he had always done at Duke's jokes — which were not great jokes. Be said '' Is your leave overr with his faint voice. ' But you could hare a day or two again if I sent for you, Duke ♦' 'Oh, yes, said Duke, 'you must send for jne tile first time you are allbwed to get out, to help you downstairs, til come, never iear.' But after a little more of this tearful smiling talk, the young man beckoned softly to the nursing sister to come with him to the door. ** Wbat do you think he means about sending for me!' he said, with a face almost aspaleasHar's. the nurse looked at him and shook her head. She too had grown to like the patient boy. Sbe putup her hand to her eyes to dash away the rising tears. ' He must not see that I have been crying,' she said. 'It dud what he means; Do you think that's whatie means? ? And do yon think so too V cried Dike. ' Oh/don't say so, nurse, don't say so ; it would break my heart.' 'I won't say so,' she replied. 'I think with such a young thing as that lfcere is .always hope.' 'And you know a lot,' said Duke, 'as much as the doctor. Ged bless you for saying cot But you think Hist is ytat be means? And he lies there— and smuet— and thinks — of tkat,' said the young man, with bis face full of awe. He act out in all the vigour of liis younJE life in the brich&iess; of the nunniv day to bis light work and boundless amuse ment with all the world before him— and Mar. lying there, smiling, thinking -if that. Duke felt as if his own lightly beating heart stood still in the poignancy of the contrast. Oh, why conld Dot he give some of bis life to help out tiiat flickering existence? He went away feetinc^tfiat there was a pall over the sunshine, and that nothing would ever be truly bright nfnin Sot to be rare tint was a. mood - that could not Jut. Sin.

She talked very little to them ; did not interfere with their pursuits as she usually did. She seemed to care for nothing. NatnraSly there were no guests or entertainments of any kind, and her interest in her household affiurs — which was usually so minute and nw»'*Hpc seemed to have faded altogether. She wrote do letters, made no ; calls, her social life seemed to come to an end. She did not even so to church, which was a habit she had always kept up rigorously. Three or four times a day she went to the nick room for news of the patient, and it wan there alone that she seemed to wake up completely.' She pot the nurses through a catechism of qntMtaonn- She attended upon the doctor ?when he came, and listened to everything lie ?aid and that was said to him with a hungry ?cariosity. Her countenance did not vary or betray it. It was known that she was ' over annous/' that she had always taken a iliHfiii fur view. When he was pronounced ttteft little better there was a- little quiver ?of h*r head, like an nmpoken contradiction ; at* when he was a little worse a sort of ^ffMniring gleam came into her eyes. Hie saraesdid not like her. and* answered her «tteatwns as briefly as possible. Her determi nation that everything most go badly irritated the women, who had a natural confidence in themselves and in what their nursing could do, and they both believed that she was more mtufied when the news was bad than when it was good. ' She's not like his mother.' they aaid between themselves, 'and she's fixed in her mind from the first that this is how it's to be— u snme people would rather see their mother «B* than be proved wrong in their opinion.* Tley thought no worse of her than this. As a matter of fact Lctitia was very unu&ppy; daring this long sutspence, She bad never anticipated anything of the kind. What she had expected was an illness which would last perhaps a week, and this long lingering malady confounded and exasperated her. She was angry with poor Mar. for being so long about deciding what to do, and with the doctor who would do£ «ay anything definite, and the nurses whose opinions wavered from hour to hour. 'How is a person to tell when you are never in the same mind from one hour to another V she said with the resentment of highly excited nerves. She was strung to the very highest pitch, thinking of nothing else, longing for a crisis, that she might know what she had so look for. She was never at rest for a moment whatever she was doing, but kept. always listening, always intent. Every step that approached she thought was some one come to call her, to tell her there was a change. She dropped her work upon her knee, or let her pen fall, to listen for every sound that arose. On the critical day of each week when a crisis might be expected she was so restless that she could not keep etilL ' My wife is so anxious,' John said, trying to persuade liicuelf that her anxiety was the natural anxiety, the desire that the patient should get welL That anxiety is terrible enough as most know: but the other anxiety, the horrible watch which is for the patient getting worse, the longing for ' a change' in the worst sense-^a change that meant death, how horrible ib that, beyond all description ! When she talked at all she talked of Ids symptoms and of what the night nurse said, ana what the other said. The muses rook different tides as was natural. One of them was pessimist, the other took the doctor's view. Itwastbenightnarsethatwas the gloomy one — and with her Mrs. Parke was in the habit of having a long consultation very early when she was relieved in the morning — a consultation from which ehe derived a little satisfaction and which calmed her nervous excitement. But the day nurse with the cheerful look, who always insisted that fl™» patient was a little better, or looked a little brighter, or had a little more strength, or at all events was ?* no worse,' brought back the nervous excitement which was like a fire in her veins. The fifth week had begun, and the flight of life aud death on the boy's wasted frame was beccuing every hour more intense. Would his strength hold oat? *iHe h&sno; strength,' said the night nurse jfl feel every hour as if £rom nixonta? t0tninnt€ Jn.e collapse mustcoine.' 'I don't Bay he brit very weak,' said the more cheerful sister/ ' bat you never can tell with * delicate boy like that how strong the constitution may be. Sometimes ite like iron and steel, and yet no appearance ? n The doctor stood and looked it the worn young countenance upon the pillow. Mar. had scarcely strength to open his eyes, to respond to the doctor's inquiries and acknow ledge the stir of hie morning visit. There was a faint smOe upon his face, and sometimes a. wistful look round upon the group about his bed, moving slowly from one to another. His mind bad never been affected. Sometimes he lay as if in a dream, bnt when recalled was ' always himself' the nurse said, ' and tliat is surely a good sign.' Dr. Barker did not deny that it was a good sign, but he looked graver than ever. Letitia devoured him with eager eyes when they stood face to face outside the sick-room. '?What do you think, doctor?11 she said. ' I have told you a hundred times what I think,' he replied, ' with the petulance of distress. ** I cannot form a new opinion every hour.

' It is a Great Uiing to us, bnt it is nothing to her.' ' Yes, I can see it is a great thing to you,' he answered,' with a clouded countenance. ' Bat she has been told I suppose.' 'Oh, what does it matter? What does it matter?' Letitia said within herself in the misery of her suspense. But she wrung her hands till they hurt her, and controlled herself. **I believe news has been sent,' she said. ** But that is not enough,' said the doctor, glad on his side to have some reasou to find fault, to relieve liis own brain and heart with an outburst. 'She must be told that his state is very serious. She must Le made to. know ? ' 41 Then you think his state is very serious ?' said Letitia, with a land of wilduess of concealed exultation in her eyes*. 11 Have I ever said otherwise *' said the doctor. ' Can anyoue look at him and cot see that? — very grave, bat not hopeless, Mrs. Parke. You will never get me to say more.' *' It is only because I want to know the truth,' sbe said, abashed. 'I will never tell you anything but the truth. The mother ought to know. However indifferent she may be there must be some human feeling felt. I remember her as a very sweet woman. And theii there was the aunt uiio was devoted to the boy.' 'You speak as if there was but one,' said Letitia, with & forced smile ** Oh, I do not overlook your anxiety, Sirs, Parke ! No doubt it is very great — but the other ladies must be told. Tell them ? ' He doctor paused when h-naw her hungrv look. It flashed into her face that now nhe would hear the exact troth how much there was to fear and how mucli to hope. Sbe looked at him as he paused, clasping her hands tight. ' Yes?' she said, breathless. The doctor, it was evident, liad thought better of what he was going to say. 'Tell them, he said, 'that the circum stances are serious : that there bs an absence of certain of the worse symptoms — butagaia that 'the matter is grave It all depends on how his strength keep up. And that in the present position of affairs I think they should Eehere/^ ' You think they should be here,' Letiiia repeated breathlessly. It seemed to her the most satisfactory utterance she had yet heard. '* Yes, it would bean ya^ to your own mind to have his nearest relatives on the spot. They would share your anxiety at least — and it is not as if there was any want of room. They should have beenhereat once— toprevent reflections— in case anything should happen.' A lightning gleam seemed to come out of Letitda^s eyes— like that electrical flash which the doctor had thought scorched him when Mar's illness began. 'Then you think ? ' she said with a heaving of her breast. ' I think no more than what I have said : but to have Lady Frogmore here and Miss Hill would in any case be best.' Letataa repeated ** Lady Frogmore' uncon sciously under her breath. It was not of Mary she was thinking. It vas of the next bearer of that title, the woman towards whom the coronet was floating ghost-like in a sort of trail of cloud. 'I can't believe,' said the doctor sharply, ** that Lady Frogmore will be bo indifferent as is said to the condition of her sou,' Letitia went to her writing table when he was gone with a strange buoyancy. She had not written any letters for some time, but tliere was a sort of exultation iu her now. as if the end of her suspense was near. John came in when she bad seated herself and began her letter. He had missed the doctor and was anxious to hear what he had said. There was something in his wife's aspect which startled him. 'The boy is better?' he exclaimed. He cave her ii the impulse of the moment a credit which she did not deserve. *' Is he *' cried Letitia, turning round upou her chair with all the colour going out of her face. She added tremblingly, shrinking from her husband's eye, ** Do yon mean that there **I thought so,' he raid gravely, 'from the relieved look in your face.' They contemplated each other for a. moment in ailence, John with pain aud distress, she shrinking a little from his eye. ' I don't know what you mean, 'she said; 'though I might be relieved to think that the poor child will not suffer much Jonger.

'God kuowfi? it may rouse her to. iindcr tttaod what she's losing : the finest, promising boy, the most generous and patient ?

'The one creatore tU&t; stood between yoarsooaJidhU.birthright— between you and everything you have looked for all your life.' John Parke walked about the room in an agitation which was not simple as his emotions general^' were. His heart was wrung for the patient boy who had grown npiinder his eye — bur perhaps to forget all that this boy's death woald bring him was impossible. He stamped horrible thoughts that would arise ' If I could buy little Mar'* life with the sacrifice of *veiytJiiiig J' h* said, with, an silBiost hysterical break m iris voice— ' It in easy saying' so,n she said ; ' bnt for my part Duke is more to me than Mar f
