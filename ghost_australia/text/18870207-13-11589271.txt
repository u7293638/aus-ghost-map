CURRENT LITERATURE. The world is indebted to Dr Louis Engel, the author of From Mozart to Marie (Bentley and Son) for a work of unique interest Dr Engel, who is at once artist, virtuoso, and critic, seems to have known every musical celebrity for the last BOjeara He was an intimate of Rossini and of Auber He has talked with Heine and with Meyer beer He knew Patti almost in the nursery, and was witness to her first appearance in London Of Mario and of Christine Nilsson he has many stories to tell, and indeed his repertoire of the sayings and doings of the court we* is inexhaustible He writes with great enthusiasm, though some men with partiality He has a hatred of Wan ner, whom he perhaps unduly depreciates His idol is Rossini, of whom he has many anecdotes Once the conversation turned on Rossini's immortality. "My immortality?' said Rossini "Do you know what will survive me? The third act of 'Tell,' the second act of 'Otello,' and The Barberot Seville,' from one end to the other " The famous prayer of Moses was written under singular circumstances. I had to take a tissue,' said Rossini, which stood before me while I wrote that prayer When I was writing the chorus in G minor I suddenly dipped my pen into the medicine bottle instead of the ink , 1 made a blot, and when I dried it with sand (blotting paper was not invented then it took the form of a natural, which instantly gave me the idea of the effect which the change from G minor to G major would make, and to this blot is all the effect-if any-due Rossini himself was the best Figaro ever heard, and is here reputed to have as far surpassed Labi nell c in that famous character as Lablache surpassed the world Of Meyerbeer who wrote what is the greatest dramatic opera in the world-the one of which, on its first appearance, a French wit is re ported to have said, "I have come away from a piece where the Christians have been playing one another, and a Jew making music over them "Dr Engel has many stones Rossini, his co religionist the Jews have always been great in music-who was supposed to be envious of Meyerbeer sald the handsomest things of him " You call me the reformer of the Italian opera Me) sr beer is the reformer of the worlds opera with all his fame he is not appreciated at his real value " Of Grisi and Mario, that unsur- passable pair, both in their artistic and their domestic lives, for it was one long and passionate duet between them, Dr Engel has also much to say, and it is all creditable to both Grass was very jealous, and Mario had to give up more than one engagement because the diva suspected the loading lady of being too handsome Of Jenny Lind we are told that her first singing master-on eminent Frenchman advised her to go back to her own country and marry her clergyman a Bon, for " a singer she could never be " But it is impossible to give, by extracts, any idea of the entertainment to be found in Dr Engel's two charming volumes by those who love music and are interested in musicians the translation of the Odyssey ' into English verse by the Earl of Carnarvon Macmillan and Co ), may be set on the same shelf with the late Earl of Derby s translation of the Iliad The Earl of Carnarvon has less fire, perhaps genuine poetic faculty), but his version is the smoother and the more graceful We are not convinced that English blank verse is the best medium into which to render the Homeric heroic hexameter Even in the strongest hands blank verse is a stiff inelastic measure, scarcely responding to the roll and swell of the Greek hexameter But Lord Carnarvon has made the best of the material he has chosen, and in his version non classical readers will be able to read with a new relish the divine tale of the great adventurer, Odysseus Lord Carnarvon professes to have followed, in respect of his proper names, the Greek rather than the Roman nomenclature, but he is not always consistent in his spelling, for he has Hep licsBtos and Calypso, of which the first is neither Greek nor Latin, and the second not Greek. Kosmos , or the Life of the World (Kegan Paul and Co.) is a poetical drama of some imagination, utterly impractical The hero is a retired Government official, who, having failed in his policy, and being " marked for assassination," retires with an only son to a " distant seaport," where he has common ings with Kosmos, the spirit of the world, who comes and goes like a ghost but speaks more than ghosts generally do Out of these unpromising materials the anonymous author has made his poem, which is not in the smallest degree dramatic, and only very Huntly poetical. It was a very good idea of Mr Charles Dickens, junior, to give us a new edition of Pickwick, with annotations and illustrations of the localities and some of the extinct characters and customs spoken of in the book (Macmillan and Co ) The result appears in two handsome volumes which, it will startle some of us to hear, have a right to be called the "Jubilee Edition ' Pichucl was written and published in 1830 37, and already many of the customs, the allusions, the characters, and the scenes need to be explained to the modern reader Many of the places mentioned, especially the old hostelries and the Inns of Court in London SO beloved by Charles Dickens, have passed away The old White part in the borough, where Sam Weller was first seen, has been pulled down this many a year Staple Inn has been knocked down to the builders Goswell street, indeed, and East Street remain pretty much as they were when Mr Pickwick and Mr Robert lawyer lived in them, but the Watchman, the Cabriolet, the Twopenny Postman, the Coachman are as dead as the Fleet prison or Mr Jingle Manners and gus tomshavechanged greatly, and innothingmorc than in the habit of drinking One cannot help being struck, on reading this new version of Pickwick, at the immense quantity of port wine, ale, Sherry, punch and other liquors which were required to keep the conviviality going 50 years ago Mr Charles Dickens, jun , has done a good and pious work in bringing out his fathers immortal book in this Bhapp, though we could spare some of the wood cuts of the leading characters, copied from Hablot Brownes well known etchings These are too familiar already to the reader and they were never so good as to afford being transferred to the wood His sketches of places and buildings are more happy and useful The notes seem to us to be scarcely full enough, and they are printed in a type too closely resembling the text Manners Man of the Man, IS by the author of How to be Happy, though Man ted ( I' Fisher Unwin), which has had a remarkable success, implying, as it would seem, that there are a great many of the married who want to know how in spite of that, they are to be happy The new book is not likely to be as favourably received as the other was though it is of irreproachable correctness, and is full of modern instances
