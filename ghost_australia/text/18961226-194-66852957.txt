STAR OF THE SEA CONVENT ANNUAL CONCERT AND EXHIBITION. DISTRIBUTION OF PRIZES. \--0---- There was a crowded attendance at St. James' Hall on Thursday, 17th inst. on the occasion of the annual concert, exhibition, and distribution of prizes in connection with the Presentation Con- vent, Star of the Sea, Elsternwick. The display of the pupil's work attrac- ted much favorable attention, and.the interesting programme of vocal and instrumental music, dancing, and elo- cution, that was gone through, proved that the young ladies under the nun's care are receiving, not only a sound education, but are being made proficient in all those refined accomplishments which add so materially to a woman's adornments in the home circle. An operetta, "La Somnabula," was prettily interpreted by the Misses Poole, Healey, Parer, Mallinson and Maguire. The argument of the operetta is as follows:- The Count, returning to the village after a long absence fit a sce? of rejoicing. A .g llb IÃ½..Fipp', tr and favourite, has been selected by the authorities to receive the crown and purse annually allotted as the reward of virtue ; on the morrow she is to be publicly crowned. Elvino, her brother, congratulates her, and the villagers express their joy. As darkness ap- proaches, the Count is informed that a phantom has lately appeared at night, terrifying the beholders. In the next scene the supposed ghost is beheld; but on coming nearer is recognised as Amina. She attempts to enter the church where the crown is deposited for the coming ceremony. As the jewels which formerly decorated the shrine of the Virgin have lately been stolen, Amina is suspected of visiting the place at night for evil purposes. -:Her brother next day re- proaches her, but she cannot under- stand his anger. Her reputation is lost; some of her friends visit the castle of the Count to ask him to interfere on her behalf, and investigate the matter. On the night when he arrives for the purpose, Amina is again seen wandering; it is then perceived she is in a state of somnambulism. This leads to her exculpation, and a chorus of joy. The part of Amina, the village favourite, was admirably filled by Miss Poole, while that of Elvino, her brother, was capitally rendered by Miss Mallin- son. The Count found an able repre- sentative in Miss Maguire, and Misses Healey and Parer made bewitching little villagers. A farce, " Fitzsmythe of Fitzsmythe Hall." created great amusement, and all the young ladies who took part are deserving of the highest praise for their elocution and their acting. The characters were allotted as follows:-Mr Fitzsmyth, of Fitzsmythe Hall, Miss Doyle ; Mrs Fitzsmythe, Miss O'Sullivan; Penelope her daughter, Miss Grimpood; Frank Tittenham, Miss. A. Doyle ; Gregory, Miss Reynolds; First Cricketer, Miss Maguire ; Second Cricketer, Miss Parer; Smally Boy, Miss Ford.

Bates, Grim- wood, Burden, McCarthy, Mallinson, while some excellent dancing ,(a gavotte) was executed in most graceful style by the Misses O'Sullivan, Gor- man, Maguire, Keenan, Burden, Keighran, Lane-M'Carthy, and Pop- pens.
