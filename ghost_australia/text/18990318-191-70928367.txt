N.S.W. Parliament in Session. ~T5v-Omegat ? — — Sydney, March 4. In the small hours of Friday morning, the 3rd February, after a sitting of some 19 hours, the Federal Enabling Bill passed through all its stages in the Assembly and waa sent to the Council. It was accom panied on its journey bv the fervent God speed of the Federal enthusiasts, who, not withstanding the unearthly hour insisted upon calling for thre» cheera for the ' two federal leaders,' Reid and Barton. These two gentlemen, who a few months back were at each others throats, are now sworn allies. « * » It is indeed a very pretty sight to watch the two exchange magnificent courtesies acros* the table. One feels a thrill of patijotie gratulations at the thought that 'herein these two the glorious traditions. of tb** mother of Parliament' ar*- worthily upheld, and that in New South Wale* at least, the ago of chivalry is not dead\ Un happily the example of these two illust^kms men doe« not seem contagious, Mr. Lyw» prevented throuerhont the debate agloomy^ and chilling reticence, broken only by a mvag** d*»torm*naiaon — approfm of a remark of Mr. B-id's— 'not tost»«danv infernal ins Its.'* Nor wa« thia an isolated outbreak; Mr, Copelaud, and Mr. Garrol, Opposition Whip, were on the verge of what, in view of their iwtieetfve siju^s must have been nothing short of a massacre, when prevented by the timely interference of tnutual friends. Tn the l-osom of the Premier too, some of the shafts sent deftly home by Mr. Husrhes on the Addressin reply, still rank!«d acutely and ma**red his usual genial Imthommic. Fn the Premier's reply, he. referred to the attack as one 'descending to the gro^est personalties and offensive to a decree that wa« positively painful, and \w%gp& that the hon member would do him the favour to b * silent. ' He alluded to the ** H *» party, Hughes, H&yties;, and Holman, and said that he supposed that if the present negotiations failed, these gentlemen would carry on the national movement. Altogether it seemed pretty clear that the thrusts of Hughes bad gone home. * * « The bill went up to the Council un amended. Xot a comma was altered, and of the three amendments moved two were ignominiouslv defeated and one was with drawn, the Premier givintr his word that the referendum should not l»e taken within ?flis'weeks from the passing of the bilL * m » The others were fought out bitterly to the end by the determined few who believed in ' them and had the courage of their con victions. m mm The first was one by Mr. Hughes to make the inclusion of Queensland imperative, and was so worded as to render the accept ance of the bill by N.S.W. null and void if her Northern neighlxnir did not come in. m * m The arguments used in support of this appear to me so important that I propose, with your permission, to forward the ffamard -report (abridged) for publication in your columns. After a long debate it was defeated by 75 to 9— the majority of the Labour Party voting against it, m * # The second amendment, proposed by Mr. Haynes, sought to enable the people to have before them both the agreement of the Premiers' Conference and the bill as it left Parliament. This perfectly legitimate attempt was defeated after a protracted discussion by 71 to 9, the majority of the Labour T*arty again voting against it. ? ?''*' * * The feature which struck one most dis agreeably in the debate was the wholesale recantation by those faint-hearted patriots who a month back had vehemently denounced the very measure they were now prepared to unconditionally accept. The gentlemen who represent districts with fine cool climates went over to a man. They_ do nothing now, night nor day. but- sing deliriously the praises of some alluring and salubrious cow flat. The majority of the remainder was debauched by the prospects of a seat in the Federal Parliament, and so era venly swallowed a vicious bill with hardly a grimaoe. --Trfee-fadicrous-anxiety of these gentlemen — whose name is legion and ? jwhos^:elianep-w-JBHekley-'8 — wouldr-had-tho- occasion lwn less momentous, furnished cause for Homeric laughter. As it is, one \- can only feel impressed with a profound melancholy to see after ho many protesta 't£-p«v of virtue their complete debauch ment by the very ghost of a shadow of temptation. * * * And now it but remains for the Council after Rome feeble show of resistance to send it to the people. As I have already said in another letter, nothing that they can do can effect more than temporary delay, for the Government is determined to 'use every power in the Constitution ' to reduce — —that ™^atnb«HM^-4ir^-wpe4i-3ejise_rof_.its_ impotence. And so we may regard it as a foregone conclusion that the bill will be before the people in three months from the ? / present time. And it certainly seems that «/ the verdict will be in the affirmative.
