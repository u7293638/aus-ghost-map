AFTER WINTER, Not yet the infant Spring Hath changed her russet gown for robes of green, But lieth slumbering, Hid in the covert of a wood, unseen Folded in shadows deep, Ethereal visions flit aerate her face in sleep. Like memories of the dead, Winter revives and fades, mid days of blue, And thrusts bis snowy head Upon the landscape, whitening all the view; With shrilly voice and thin, High singing o'er the downs the chilly breezes spin. Here, by the sharp blast switched, The ruddy drifts about the road are swayed, Dancing like sprites bewitched In whirling somersaults of light and shade; The hollow forests sing. Shuddering with fearless music as the lank boughs swing. Upon the cottage wall The Jasmine lingers in a listless dream; O'erhcad the sparrows oall, And twitter oat toe dav in -cie-v-- i cierue ; Whistling a sober tu i-j.
