EVENI»a8ABI> MORNISOSHTIHE BUSH. BY " Peutetbb." [On the box seat—A harveBt drive on an English mail coaoh—Another harveBt drive on a colonial mail coach—Wayside incidents—The haunted house, a real ghost story—The battle between a ewe end an eagle-hawk.] A seat in Parliament, or s v iest in the Cabinet, or a seat on the Woolsack, or a Beat in an air-balloon, or a seat in the parish stocks, or a seat on a Sootoh Kirk «< onttie btool," or a seat in the Board-room (or the parlour) of the Bank of England with a "weekly return" of £17,000,000 in the Bank oellar underneath, or a Beat in the saddle of the " favourite " in the race for the «• Cup" or the Derby, or a seat in the Oathedral Ohair |of the See of Canterbury, with the figures £J7,600 income per annum attaohed to it, or a seat on a" Merry-goround," or a seat in a diving-bell, or a truant midshipman's seat on the mast-head of a Baltimore dipper ship in a croBs sea, or a seat on a barrel of gunpowder in a smokingcarriage—all these seats and sites, and many others, have their own special spiritstirring interest, or life-enlivening excitement, or neok-breaking peril, or purse-filling stimulus about them, as the aspiring, or the adventurous, or the daring, or the wise and strong, or the weak Who nave gained them or lost them are aware. But there is another seat which bombinee in itself a oertain modicum of t he rewards Bnd riekB, and dangers and delights, and the enviable prominence which attend upon all the aforesaid seats and situations, and that other seat is a Skat oh tkb Box of a smart, well-built, well-horsed, welldtiven royal mail ooach—such mail coaches as went out from the London Post-office •between 7 and 8 o'olock in the evening, to the number of 14 or 15, going off in pallant style, in the olden time, when George III. or his eon, George IV., was king. In those longdeparted times the box seat on the Oxford or Bristol mail was a post of distinction, and the obtaining of it was an object of ambition to Oxford "swells" and west oountry squireB* sons, who often took the ceins out of the coachman's hands, and displayed their skill aB charioteers in a manner that won the admiration of all outsiders. On most of the roads the box seat carried an extra tariff of half-a-orown, and this fee noted as an excluder from the coveted elevation against pretenders, " bagmen," attorneys' olerks, young farmers, and shopmen. On a fine autumnal morning the box seat afforded a delightful prospect of far-extending wheat crops, waving gently to and fro beneath the pressure of the sunny breeze; and sheltering rows of elms and lime Byoamore trees, slowly putting on their russet tints and harvest hueB on every side, shed a rich, warm, luxurious glow over the rejoicing landscape. On en oh a day a neat on the bbx of die Bedford or Bury St. Edmunds or Bath mail ooach was worth the extra half-orown charged for it. Blae sky above; metalled road, smooth aB a planed plank, below; agrarian weather and beauty profusely scattered around; a fresh, light, zephyry air •offering-yon its frareet draughts of liquid elixir to inhale; a witty, expert, and communicative ooaohman beside you, putting you au courant with all the looaliti.es as you pass, and laying bare to you the interior life of every way-side inn, and his flirtations with or rebuffs from every pretty barmaid at every inn where yon stop " to wet the horses' nosesevery horse of the fotar Which whirl you along being three - quarter thoroughbred. Yes, the box Beat Of the dsiy mail in those pre-iron-road days was a throne pro tempore, and made the occupant a king as independent of sublunary troubles as the crowned monarch of the land Surveyed by the eye of the box Beat holder. Yon could me the land in those days, and < the " granges," Bnd "halls," and "lodges," and the "castles" which embellished the Counties through whioh the king's high road permitted yon to journey. You oould see the groves, and gardens, and homesteads, and farm- yards, end the hay-makers in the now, end the loaded waggon, and the sheep feeding, and the kine lying down in the shade of the branching elms, and you oould take in at one view, as yon can a pictnre, the fair tind fertile scenery of bill and dale and lawn and green lane and bean field,and admire them as If they were your own. Tbe Iron toad has spoiled all that. It has overthrown tbe box seat, and reduced the turnpike roads of England to desolate forsaken ess. In a railway carnage yon may as well skim over (he surface of a barren moot aB paradise. Ab you look from the window of a cheerless Seoond class compartment, all creation eeemc madly rndung away from yon In fright and \- tenor and indistinguishable confusion, and Nature's loveliest features an blurred and distorted and hideous to the right. In truth, there is no landscape-seeing whm yon araVel by the railway, and tbe landscape eights along the turnpike toad motes of «id ate lost in the blinding rapidity and deafeningalatter of tbe express tcain. Uw express train had no business to demolish "the box .mm," tot from that imperial deration the scenery-loving vtytgaar ooulfl ga» : lrfth gtad and prond aad patriotaye L vistas of EagUsb rural loT^eeawnsar* passed, or one nay ntdjiqr vugadUii ' hotrf oomfort, "Vroptl ffiwih fitnfa colonies oun, end the road by which the Grongir ooach w*8t forth on its career towards WooioutnanHfer d«>Rerv«d au encomium as lauds'ory a« its en/in er ooull desire. Tt-n minutes Sufficed our four aark bays to take our fully loaded oaou dear of Grongar's suburbs, and quite out into the open country on the new road, which was a very simple-minded, straight-forward, smooth, and level rbifl, Without curve, turn, or deviation from its right line course for eleven miles across what was called Tht Dah, and then swerved to the east, and made another streteb of nine miles, and then brought as out upon the old Sydney-road to Wooloumaurifer. People are never sati»fied. The road or the road makers knew that a straight road was the best either for man or bfast; but now because it was straight we wanted it crooked and twisted only to relieve tbe eye of the accelerating monotony. The *egi6n on our right sloped slightly upwards in a broad expanse of many miles towards the Oolo Rang**, and supplied inexhaustible pasturage for many flooks of sheep, the smoke of whose owner's station chimneyb we could see afar off, curling oloudward bs we cautered on. What a huje vo'ume of'vicissitude was opened before ns that day as we rolled on that colonial turnpike road. Forty years before, the only smoke ever visible in that wide waste of use less virgin soil was the smoke that ascended from a fire on which the Blaokfellow cooked his opossum steaks, or roasted his kangaroo sirloin. The Blaokfellow had not put out his territory to tilth and cereal usuiy, and his valuable, but unimproved inheritance has been taken from him, and given to The Whetefegmw, who had ten territories which bad been duly oooupied, and bad brought forth fruit a hundredfold, and filled his barns and storehouses to ovei flowing. Does the Whitefellow understand the transfer and its deeper and more divine purpose P How came the Blackfellow, the proprietor of this great Australian island, to be in the state wherein the Whitefellow found him 100 years ago P Was the Blackfellow's state when Cook came and discovered him the primal state of mankind in their beginning ? Some philosophers say that man, when created, was placed in a state of the highest social civilisation; that man fell from that finft state, and has been for snme few thousand years qnly tediously and imperfectly making bis way back to first estate. This curious question in ethnic economics was not, however, any part of the conversation which took place between the passengers by the Grongar ooach. Behind the box seat were four colonists, one of whom w«« my landlord, two 640 acre selectors from Victoria, and an American ehieen from Stn Francisco. The two Victorians were vehemently eloquent on the subject of Iheigatioh akd Casus, and hurled very diversified and intensely earnest orations upon the perverse heads of the Victorian Government ft® their stony* hearted disregard of a canal and irrigation movement np in the Murray districts, and if tbe said Victorian Government ever get to Heaven, their good lock will In no wise be owinir to the pietv of the prayers which those two Victorian selectors offered down to all the infernal gods Bnd demon-stokers for the everlasting application of the best caloric to the said Government's guilty souls. The San Francieco immigrant made the maUer worse for the two oanal and irrigation allotment holders, as well M for the Victorian Government, by describing the happy and prosperous results of a certain American scheme of irrigation, whrreby a salt desert in Arkansas, or Ohio, or somewhere was, in six weeks, transmuted into milk sops and honeycombs. Oar coachman also was well grounded in the geography «f the "tons" on either side of the road,and in the history of the Christian taotios by which the Blatlt bsd henn de-arod off from their own property. He pointed out the now nearly dried up Watethole, by the side of which seven aberigtw* had been found dead through their etitfog pManed mutton designedly laid in tfcw way when they came too often to a station half a »iie from when we wen. They ***** poisoned meat, gem to the wafawhoJe to quenoh their taming thirst and there expired. Abont 15 miles fro* Gwmgar ocr coachman also directed our attention towards ill two- Btorey how*, np, falling to decay. It bad been built by two tatihtis fa* npaWiahsase <n their allotment. One »igbt the brothers quarrelled over * game of twfe, «nd <**> ©f them stabbed the rthist in bis twy , » that he died in a few niaatee. tnhwte was tried for the murder and tramyMted to Port Arthtor. tt *saw«5v*w We* kat was S o T p S r ^ K ^ ^ ^ faotittftted^fta, so flu titaiw. whew the two tftoftfaen had ted fewatHtea ctroeOTHanrcea swuaw. srtfeb was Hketbattt.de by two J*"**® twwaiPi to i m m had gained u permitted entrance ones nevtsr, retuned again fotr sheltet t« a lo^vlne in' «bioh th« spirit of ^te dead brttfhew seemed afiet death to mtneftftd nightly re- Ot.mmence their fi-bd-like SUi'e.
