33ïe Courier* PUBLISHED DAILY. WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 1, 1868. It is interesting anil not altogether un- profitable for communities, as well as indi- viduals, to occasionally pause and look back over the past, noto the changes which have laken place in their history during a certain period, the hopes and as- pirations willi which the}' set out, the efforts made to realise those aspirations, the success or failure of such efforts, the dangers threatened, the difficulties met anti overcome, and the unforeseen events which have arisen, from time to time, to frustrate the host devised schemes and the most care- ful calculations. V,y common consent the commencement of a new year is ¡m appro- priate occasion on which to indulge in such a retrospect, and although it is out of the question for its, in the space of- a news- paper article, to enter upon anything like a full and complete review of the public events of the past year, still wo may, with propriety, give a brief glance at a few of them, leaving our readers for the most part to draw their own conclusions as to the lesson they teach. Last .New Year's Day found us just com- mencing to recover from the utter prostra- tion in which the commercial and financial crisis of the previous year had left us. The relief camps around Brisbane had been broken up, and the discovery . of gold al Crocodile Creek and Morinish had drawn off Y considerable portion of our surplus labor, while the newly-discovered gold- fields at the Weddin Mountains, New South Wales, were not only attracting as many of thoremainder as could find thcnienns of leaving the colony, but hundreds of work- ing men who had employment and who gave it up, and sacrificed everything in order to reach the Eldorado, with what result we now know. At the same time expectation was raised to the highest by the pretended discovery of gold at Bulimba. In tho political world everything seemed unsettled and ominous of change. The late Colonial Treasurer, the lion. J. D. M'Lkan*, had just been taken away from us by violent and'sudden death ; Mr. Douglas had been appointed to his place without a seat in the Legislative Assembly, and was just then " wooing the sweet voices'' of the electors of Eastern Downs, while a large section of the members of the Assembly were indignant because the Warwick railway liad been proceeded with in opposition to a resolution of the House'passed the previous session, und had just memorialised His Excellency the Governor not to prorogue Parliament be- yond tlie 10th of January. These were the chief topics of the day at the com- mencement of January last, and among the subordinate ones were the fact that the colonial mail steamer Hero was making her last trip to Batavia-the expiring effort to open up a postal route by Torres Straits ; the people of Ipswich were stand- ing upon their dignity and refusing to meet any ono less than à Minister to discuss the question of making their town a port of entry ; while* the farmers of the Logan were holding their first meeting to consider the practicability of commencing sugar cultivation. The month of February had hardly commenced when'the shareholders of the Q. S. N. Company were called together to consider the advisability of raising .£50,000 by new sitares or winding up tile company. "this proved a 'v knotty point to settle, as the meeting yesterday demonstrated. In this month of February, too, the citizens of Jjrisbane got the first broad hint that their municipal affairs wore in inextricable confusion-scarcely anyone acquainted willi tlie real facts could be persuaded to accept the position of alderman, ami. " the Go " vernor in Council'' bad to elect a portion of the now aldermen-probably if it had been foreseen at that time that tho Council would have been placed in its present position .before the end of the year,'the whole would have had to bo nominated by His Excellency. Tho month of March is memorablo for several events. Messrs. Macalistcii and St. G. Gonn attended the postal conference at Melbourne-which resulted in failure, like the attempt during the same month to form a Protectionist Association in Bris- bane, and the committee of ministers of the Gospel and others which was then formed to put down the " social evil." The A'blunteer movement, however, which was recommenced at the same time, promises to bo more permanent. On the 30th of April the railway from Ipswich to Toowoomba was for- mally opened by Mr. J. Watts, the then Minister for Works. His Excellency the Governor being unable to attend on ac- count of the Hooded state of the road be- tween Brisbane and Ipswich. Although it was prophesied, and is still vehemently asserted, that the railway will not pay its working expenses, still it has done so during .the past twelve months, and it small surplus to spare. When the line is completed to Dalby and Warwick there is little doubt as to the railway being remunerative, but in order to make it so the charges for carri- age must be much more reasonable than those which now rule. Parliament met on tho 7th of May, and Mr. Piunc! commenced the campaign by moving on amendment to the address, after a speech of three hours duration in which he accused Macalister and his colleagues of all kinds of crimes and high mis- demeanor, declared that no new laud bill was required, nor would be required for years to come, and uttered many threats and warnings. Mr. Lamo and other loading members of the Opposition followed in much tho samo strain, but the amendment was ultimately withdrawn and the address agreed to. A few days afterwards, however, Mr. Puen brought forward his motion declaring the scat of Mr. Joh.v Douglas to be vacant, by reason of informality in his appointment as Colo- nial Treasurer. This motion was carried by a majority of 19 to 5 ; and so, on the 23rd of the same month, Parliament was prorogued, then dissolved, and an appeal made to the country. Then followed the excitement of the general elections, which occupied the wholo of July. The land question was the leading topic on every hustings, but electoral reform, a new immi- gration law, Provincial Councils,and severe modes of economising the public revenue and retrenching the public expenditure, were alsp advocated by nearly every candi- date, ami received with decitlcd approba- tion by the electors in nearly every electo- rate. It has since turned out that in most cases this cry for economy and retrench- ment was meant only to apply to all dis- tricts except the one represented by the individual member who advocated it. How- ever, when the new Parliament mot on the 7th of * August, the debate on the ad- dress afforded the members a splendid opportunity of airing their eloquence on all conceivable topics. They seized the op- portunity with avidity, and indulged their inclinations to the utmost. To judge from the speeches then delivered, there never was such an assemblage of stern pure minded patiiots on any Opposition benches before, and it was determined that llio Macaws run Ministry should no longer bo allowed to hokl ofiice. The division on Mr. Mackenzie's amendment to the Ad: dress gave the Ministry a majoiity of twoj but as this was not considered to bo a work- ing majority, the Macalister Ministry resigned, and the Mackenzie Ministry reigned in its stead. Parliament was again adjourned until September 17th, and on that day it assembled for the third time during the year. What the new Ministry have done since then, except allowing bon. members to amuso them- selves by framing a Land Bill, it would puzzle one to tell. One thing, however, is plain enough, and that is-that the new year has found us willi most of the important business of the ses- sion still to get through. Of all the questions which wore most popu- lar at the general elelection not a single one has been settled, or is even in a fair way of settlement. The economy anti retrenchment talked of so much at that time has been practically ignored, and next year will certainly.find us with an increas- ing deficit. The prospect of even a tem- porary settlement of the land question this session is now very doubtful ; the question of electoral reform has been shelved for another two years ; the immigration ques- tion is in abeyance, pending the settlement of the land question ; and the northern grievances, which the present Ministry wore to redress so promptly, are also made to stand over. What the Parliament have said, however, during all those dreary weeks since the 17th of September last is it not written in llamará? In thoso respects in which a Ministry could not very-well interfere with the prosperity of a community, however, we are in a somewhat more favorable position than at the commencement of last year. Trade is gradually but' surely becoming established on a much sounder basis than heretofore, and the discovery of gold at Gympie Creek two months ago has already begun to accelerate this reviving process. The cultivation of sugar-cane and the manufacture of sugar have,*1 during the year, been proved to be a safe and profit- able investment, and this has stimulated enterprise to a considerable extent in that direction, while the cotton ero]) of last year gave renewed hope to the cultivators of that staple. Last, but not least, the year which has just passed has been one of the most favorable for pastoral pursuits which has been known for same considerable timo past ; so that, on the whole, the tone of public feeling is decidedly more buoyant and hopeful than it wa? on last New Year's day.

Shortly after dinner, William M'Grath, super- intendant of the Corporation works, with two of his sons, John and James, aged respectively twelve and nine years, went to the river to bathe. None of them could swim, but M'Grath was endeavoring to teach James, by holding him up by the chin and breast, being himself nearly up to his neck. John was playing about in shallow water, and suddenly saw his father under water, the top of his head being only visible, evidently struggling to get into a shallow place. This, however, he failed to do ; but after rising twice or three times, his arms ap- parently clasping his son, he with his boy sank to rise no more. John, on seeing the position his father and brother were in, at first to procure a stick to reach them but, not finding one, he and two other boys who were bathing near the same place, raised the alarm, and about on hour afterwards the two bodies were re- covered by John Frost, who dived after them several times. Efforts were made to restore animation but without success, and the bodies were then taken home. An inquest was held on Sunday morning by the Acting-Police Magistrate, when evidence corroborative of these facts was adduced M'Grath, who was well known and respected in town, leaves a wife, who has only recently recovered from a severe illness, and five helpless children totally unprovided for. A subscription list has, how- ever, been opened, which is headed by the Cor- poration with £10, and no doubt a handsome sum will be raised. Never was charity more needed.
