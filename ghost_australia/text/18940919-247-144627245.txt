George Turner. Mr. W. T. Coldham found the large diningroom at ths'Beaconsfield Hotel-oo Friday last far too small for his audience and eo addressed them alfresco from the. baicony« \- Rival barracken at St. Kilda have gone in for the objeotibnable practtoe of tearing down their opponent's posters— which is good for the printer but hardly fair to the candidate. Mr. F. C. Gray wishes as to state that he is &ot; a nominee of the Trades Hall council, and that he bnB Iind no com munication with (hat body either directly or iodireotly. In many of tbe local churohcs on Sanday reference was made to the parlitimcniAry elections and in some Inrlanccs the preachers did a little bit of barracking for their pet candidate. 'If an earthquake struck PraJua»r | would you be in favor of bringing out the steam- roller to straighten things op!'— one of the questions asked a candidate at a teceht'election meeting; . ^ Cr. J. H. Maddock denies the 6oft im peachment so persistently spread about that he d o-y not intend to face ibo music on Thursday aod declares that he absolutely intends to go to toe poll. Melbourne theatres during the past week have suffered considerably in the way of audiences, the fun of the various election meetings having proved indeed a strong counter-attraction. The Prahran brass Baud discoursed in front of the' Prahran Tono-hatl last night in honour of Mr. Frederick Chnrles Gray, who subsequently played a political flute solo in the hall before a crowded audience The shades of sight were falling fast, 1 As through Prahrmn a great crowd p issed ; Above whose roar arose a voice, Which cried in accents of delight, Old Dixon's in I Mr. IV. T. Coldham's repartee at his variouB meetings in St. Eilda have been tbe theme of geueral admiration.' If W. T. C. gets inlo tbe parliamentary gas house friend Zox will have to look te his laurels. Mr. W. T. Coldham addressed an enthusiastic meeting at the St. K-lda ?town.)ull iant oraataj^, ,XojUfl,',*^ie 1vi'' hold bis final meeting ot ~tbe campaign at | the Orderly-room, Chapel-street, at 8,30, . a meeting being algo announced for. 7.30 at tbe Tradesmen's Club Hotel, ? Clyde street. Messrs. Maddock and Gray gave rival entertainments in Cbapcl-street on Satur day evening, the former's consisting of a seric8.of 'dissolving views,' while the letter's sounded at a distance like a Methodist prayer mcetiug. We didn't go near eoough to ascertain precisely. Mr. Joseph Harris addressed the electors ja aiondny evening at the Market Handings Lu Commeroial-road and met with a good reception. To-night be will add his final pteq . for.' re-election at Cavalier's coach factory in Toorak-road. Mr. Harris'. elec- tion is. a certainty-rif bis supporters roll up to-morrow as tbey are expected to do. The fire t public intimation of the amount of compensation paid to Mr. W. B. Gedge for - wrongful removal from the railway service was 'made at Mr. Dixon's meeting at' tbe Pxahtan Town-ball oh Friday last, when in a reply to a question the candi date stated that be understood the amohnt paid to Mr, Gedge was £SO0. Amonget the-stupid questions put lo Mr. Dixon at his .pieeting on Friday was, 'Is tbe pandidsle prepared . to explain bit frequent visits to the ship Mt. Macedon f' But fortunately, the candidate's private life . will bear scrutiny and he was! in a position to. declare In reply, 11 1 have never been on board the Mt, Mocedon in. my lift/* The key-note of our leading article to day in respcct to the Prahran contest is that every vote recorded to-morrow for' Mr. Maddock will send i tbe Trades Hall candidate one step higher on the poll, and we ape the Melbourne Argus in empbasing in black type this danger. It is no falee alarm no bogie, but solid fact. The result of tbe contest in the Toorak electorate Is one of the most idifficult to forecast. Each of tbe three candidates has a' strong following' andT the polling is expected to be exceedingly close.

Mr Beid is looked opon as safe, a this division as iweH'as at Elsternwlck nd he looks upon bis chances at Toorak as exceedingly rosy.' Another successful meeting was held at the Blsternwick Hotel last night, and to-night the candidate will speak at the Armadale Hotel in Eooyong-road — the night before the battle. Mr. W. T. Coldham writes My poli tical opponents in St. Kilda, witji the object of catching tbe civil 'servants vote, call tne 'Patterson's nominee/' This is incorrect. I am entirely opposed; to Sir James in his present and proposed' method of dealing with the Civil Service; and also to the system of railway manage ment commenced by. the ?' 8hiels-Berry- Turner Ministry and continued by the present Minister of Bail ways. I agree with the Government in their proposal to modify the tariff, and in the imposition of an Income tax. Hey, diddle-diddle, ? Where's Sogers' riddle, For taxing' the man in the moon f Oar little dorg laughed. To aee each good sport, - WboD the voters extinguished that coon. Referring to the statement made by Mr. | AV. T, Coldham. that botany and toology \ were taught in the State schools andtbfct all the zoo logy a St Kilda boy wanted be could get by . going to the beaoh and pick ing muEsels, Mr. George Tomer says, 'If my friend makes such rash statements he will need lo have tnore information on the subject before he is competent to represent St. Eilda,' and he assured his audience that in 18H2, ont of 250,000 children attending the State schools only jcigbt learnt botany and none zoology, for which they paid threepence a week extra; aod the tuition tvas given ontside school hours. , ' A Looker-on 11 writes;— What a carious ?state of things it will be if -Mr. E. J. Dixon is defeated under similar, circumstances to those which secured bis first election. On that occasion Judge Williams and the late Judge ; Webb were candidates, both being obstinate as pigs and neither willing to give way in spite of advice and entreaty of -' friends, and as a result Mr. Dixon came in au easy winner. Now as Mr. Maddock ; has not the- ghost of a 'chnnoe, and his friends | in tbe charch will not allow him to retire, it is confidently predicted tbat we shall for the next three years be represented by one of the Trades Hall mob. The more the pity.' Notwithstanding his unopposed re election as representative of the '.Eastern Suburbs 'electorate. Mt. Frank Madden, adhering to his published programme, 'ad dressed .a meeting of doctors^ ,at tbe Matvern - ebitv-ball 00 ti&tard;&y; evening last and another at Caulfield on Mon day evening. _Mr. Madden, after warmly thankiug the electors for tbe high com pliment paid to him by allowing him a walk-over, gave an interesting addrch in wbioh be dealt with various political questions of the hour, and the reception accorded to the speaker «t ;each meeting furnished proof of his popularity in. this portion of the electorate. . Mr, Gvorgc Turner addressed one of the roost eothoElastic meetings yet held in St. KilA.. nn nitrli t .« Iha Alfrwri faotl Mr. W. J. Butcher presiding.; In rcfeniog lo the main points of hiB previous ad drcbse6 the caudidfite said be wished to contradict many rumors circulated to his detriment by his opponents and especially by the Melbourne Argus (groans), which journal had persistently circulated the report thal he 'was allied ^wilh ' the 'Trades Hall party, and which . had not a particle of truth. (Applause). He thought tbat if a man was a freetrader he should stick to his principles «nd not come before tbe electors aod say 'I'm a freetrader, bat I am not goiug to interfere. with the policy of the colony.' (Cheers). He would 1 look with suspicion 'on such a man, who ought to be true to ,hi6 cause and stick to 1 free trade. Mr. Turner expressed bis belief that the people of St. Kilda were not going to ask him to take a* backseat in fav;or of a man of whom ' tbey -knew nothing. (Cheers), After several questions had been Answered, a vote of confidence was passed on tbe motion of Mr. James Phipps stoonded by Mr, J. Donaiioo. ? A (deputation -consisting .of Crp. Forbes and Osment and other members of the Prahran city council were introduced to the Minister of Railways, the Hon. J1. , W. Foaier Eogen, by Mx. Frederick Charles. Gray,, :M,L.A., in regard to the erection of a new railway station at Prahran, Tbe Premier/ Sir James Patterson, who was' also present, notioing by whom the deputa tion whs headed, tipped the wink to the : Minister of Railways, who ? on ascertaining . the cause of the visit at onco consented to place £30,000 on : tlie ' estimates jfor the erection pf a new station, mnd beingiurther urged by Mr. Frederick -pharles' Gray, M.L.A., to use dispatch it was agreed to proceed at onoe - with ibe . ,work and to haYc it' executed by Christmas. iSub sequentiy at a meeting of the Prahran council 1t was decided to ;have a .leather imedaljtrjiek for presentation to Mr. Fred erick Charles Gray, M.L.A., in' recogni jtfbn.ofhis valuable services in procuring the^new station, Cr. Maddook, in support ing the resolution, claiming th%t £ie was 'worthy of a replica of the medal, view .of ..the fact that only for Kis'bsvjng magnanimously come* fohvatd «nd split the votes, the city would not have 'secured the services of eo eminent a Statesman as Mr. Frederick Charles Gray, .M.L.A* [Keep your seat, please.
