UNEQUAL MATCHES. Our Melbourne special correspon dent, writing under date October i8, says : Amusing evidence was tendered dur ing the hearing of a Ballarat divorce case. The petitioner was an elderly individual, numbering some 70 odd years, but this fact had not served to deter him from marrying a skittish young maiden a third of his age. As might have been predicted, this union of May and December proved altogether unsuitable, and the happi ness of both parties was apparently destroyed. The appearance pn the scene of a sprightly young man and May's consequent attraction to him was merely the work of time. The climax was reached by D)ecember in stituting a suit for the dissolution of the handsome young man figuring as co-respondent. The petition was granted and a decree nisi entered. Xihis reminds one somewhat of the story in connection with an influential squatting family, owning some half dozen valuable stations. The lady was a grandmother, and wore a palpable wig, but nevertheless she, or her cash, captivated a good-looking young man of twenty-three. She married the youthful bean, and endowed him with a station or two, valued at \ some Â£60o,ooo, much to the disgust of her grown-up grandchildren. The union was a happy one until the husband got the deeds of the properties in his possession, signed, sealed, and de livered, when he did a "get" in com pany with a former sweetheart. The deserted one was either too indignant or too heart-broken to go for a divorce, consequently 'the fugitives were unable. to legalise their union and the family. However, when the errant husband gave up the ghost some years later his widow appeared shrouded in the garb of convertional pits and the boundaries of the Associa woe, and mourned publicly in rustling weeds and black-edged handkerchiefs, whereat there was much scandal and giggling amongst fashionable after noon tea table frequenters.
