North Kolan. From oun own Correspondent. Tho present spring is tho best oxporloneod by tho residents of this district for many years past. Tho young ruioona aro looking splondld— a grout deal farthor advanocd than they woro a month later last soaBon— whilo tbo young plants aro looklnir nrnnnrtlnnniniM well. A good showor would do nn Immonso lot of good at prosont, for although orops of no kiml are suffering, still tho soli in begin ning to got vory dry, owing to tho vory warm wontbor wo havo had lately. Dally indica tions oxistof tho wiflhed-for downpour, which it is to bo hopod will soon booomo a faot. Inviotn is now working a singlo shift, and ox pools to kcop going nnothor month. Wo nrc nil hoping for a longer season noxt timo bnt tho olerk of tbe woathor has all to do with that. At any rato tho acroago to bo operated on will cxocod this season's noreago by at least 400 acres, which, undor favorable circumstances, will mako a vast difforonoo. Tho refuse from tho abovo mill, now deposited on tho sand on tho opposite sido of tho river, has coasod to bo n nuisanao, and oven a careful analysis of tho river bed shows no trace of foul matter. Tho finny donizons of tho Kolan aro now porfcotly satisfied to live whoro thoy objected to last your; neither havo I heard of any horacu Riving up tho ghost through imbibing too freely ot Us limpid waters aftor a heated drivo. I am sorry to say tho pontoon bridge whloh Messrs. Cunningham ana Anderson got bullf is not giving tho satisfaction that was ex pected from it, in convoying thoir anno to tho mill. It Is to bo hoped thoir oxperionoo too this soason will serve them in good stead for tho noxt. Thoy dosorvo hotter luok.
