HI SI IN WHEAT ITS NATURE AND SUPPOSED CAUSE To the Editor of the Herald. tines a large portion of the wheat crops on the east coast of this colony, embracing a tract of country from Shoalhaven on the south, and extending is far as the Clarence or Grafton district in the north, have recently fallen a sacrifice to a blight commonly called the rust, perhaps you will be kind enough to a low me sciatica space for a few remarks upon the subject, which, at the present time, may not prove uninteresting to a number of your readers, although they may contain nothing that is new, nor of a practical nature. The effect of this cereal v visitation is unfortunately but too well known to the agriculturist, but that cause which excites the evil is not altogether co apparent, and is often attributed by our rural population to the ravages of the cases or some other mysterious, ind of varmint which, like a thief in the night, robs them of their industry, at a time, too, when hope is pregnant with success, and there is every prospect of abundance To those who entertain this opinion, it will he sufficient to remark that insects have a', little to do with the failure of their crops as those with small pox, The aphides, no doubt, occasionally commit great havoc in our fields and sorely try the patience of the horticulturist, but they belong to a totally distinct class of organised beings, and are in no way allied to those which form the subject of the present inquiry. It has long been known to the scientific (amongst which learned body I do not pretend to have a place that many of those diseases which destroy our cultivated plants, and frustrate the hopes of the husbandman, are owing to the presence of minute parasitical fungi, which prey upon the vegetable tissues, and divert to their own support and nourishment the juices intended by nature for the growth and development of the plant they feed upon. Amongst this class may be reckoned the oidium, or grape disease, which lately proved so destructive to the vineyards of the Continent, and resulted in the complete extirpation of the v mc in Madeira The potato murrain also, which on its first appearance was attended with such disastrous consequences, and which almost ever since has been the bane of the Irish farmer, is now generally admitted to be a mildew fungus, which absorbs the juices of the stalk, and thereby prevents the evaporation of those nutritious elements so essential for the support and development of the tubers. Whilst some have even contended, and not (as it appears to mc), without good reasons, that many of those fatal epidemics which occasionally attacks the human race and decimate our city populations are to be attributed to fungoid substances, generated in a foul and vitiated atmosphere, and from thence received into the system With regard to this, however, there seems like a difference of opinion, and where doctors differ I will not be presumptuous enough to decide. These fungi constitute an order of very minute plants, which botanists have described as the cryptogamic, from their being powerless, are having their organs of fructification generally obscure They are very peculiar in their appearance and development, in which they differ from all other vegetables , are also ephemeral in their nature, arriving at maturity in an incredibly short space of time, and owe their existence to some extraneous cause , either of the atmosphere or soil They include the mushroom, and an infinite variety of microscopic" plants, commonly known by the appearance of niouldiness, mildew, "but, we, are said to be the active principle in the decay of fruits, and are chiefly found growing on animal or vegetable substances in a stage of second letter, from which they derive their support Some writers appear to have questioned the propriety of considering fungi as plants, and have proposed establishing them into a separate kingdom, assigning of them on intermediate position between the two now recognised. Others, again, regard them as nothing more than mere fortuitous developments of vegetable matter, from the circumstance of their being meteoric-. springing up after storms, and of an evanescent nature. but admitting there is much that is remarkable if not inexplicable in their production, it by no means follows that we must have recourse to a theory of spontaneous general ion in order to account for their appearance The very air, it is conceded, with which we are encompassed, teems with the spores of these minute parasites, which float invisibly about us, and being of so high and subtle a consistence are wafted by every wind to 1' blows over the surface of the globe The pre-existent germ is everywhere present, and only await; some special condition to call it into existence this digression I trust, will not. prove un- interesting, and mavhelpto explain more fully the nature of that particular funtriiB at present under consideration The Rust, by which name it is generally known, belongs to a particular group, which naturalists have culled Uredo, and which, in its character, appears to be specifically identical with mildew, another each of the wheat crop ) like those just referred to, it is a minute fungus or mushroom, which is propagated me A i of the plant, where it takes root and destroys the vegetable tissues The circulation of the sap becomes suddenly arrested, the organs of fructification rendered abortive, and, as a natural consequence, no grain forms in the car It generally attacks the crop Justus it begins to blossom, and a few days is quite sufficient to complete its deduction. When a field in first affected, it assumes a reddish or orange coloured tinge, but too indicative of the evil, and which to the casual observer might be mistaken for premature maturity, On close inspection it will be found that the stem is dry and withered, as if a blast had suddenly passed over it, and checked! all vital action in the plant. On examining the steep and leaves, they appear to be covered with a fine rust coloured powder which soils the wood when touched and from which the name of the disease is derived This powder is lodged in small oblong patches beneath the epidermis or outer skin of the stalk, which at time maybe noticed partially raised, and forming a kind of blister or eruption on its surface These spots are found to consist of thousands of minute globules, which, after a little burst through their covering and are disseminated over the plant, I am not aware whether it has yet been ascertained by experi- ment whether the spores of this fungus an. absorbed of the roots, as in the case of some or whether they enter by the stomach or exhibits organs of the growing crop but as they appear to exist in the Atmosphere, it seems more probable they are deposited on the stems and leaves, from whence they become above bed. v c row come to the consideration of the question, " What are the special conditions under which this destructive blight is developed And here there appears to be much diversity of opinion. By some it is supposed that the rust is merely the effect and not the cause of this singular disease, and proceeds from a defect in the constitution of the plant, which at all times renders it an easy prey to such visitations, but, admitting there is a predisposing cause (which I think is more than probable we have still to account for the primary agent which stimulates the latent post into action A variety of opinions has been advanced upon the subject, none of which appear applicable to the present time, however much they may have explained the origin of the evil in former seasons. Amongst these I may mention the following the action of the sun upon the crops after heavy dews,, when, the plant being saturated with moisture, a rupture of its vest Is may take place. A continuance of dull, close weather, accompanied by superabundant moisture, which encourages a mark and ltWurnm growth, often followed by plethora and debility of constitution. Others strain would seek the true cause in the soil itself, which they think may be deficient in some element necessary for the growth and healthy nutrition of the crop. It will be obvious to all who have paid any attention to the present season, that the former of these conditions could not have operated in causing the present calamity. The early spring was characterised by moderate rains and showers, which acted so favourably on vegetation as to give every prospector a most abundant harvest, whilst the last few weeks have been warm and dry, both well suited for the maturity of the grain It is rather remarkable that the districts which suffered most from drought during the last summer should be those in which the rust is now most prov ment Perhaps the long dry weather, thought most disastrous in its immediate effects, may have developed in our cultivated lands some particular element or ingredient, which, though far outing a luxuriance of growth in the succeeding crops, was the cause of ultimate debility, rendering them more susceptible of the variable temperature which has been a sink- ing feature of the present season. 'This, of course, is merely con- jectural, but it will afford to rank amongst the other theories mentioned above. Assuming there is a predisposition in the growing plant, whereby it is more liable to disease, the question may be asked, " canary artificial remedy be devised for the prevention of a similar evil in future years'" For my own part I fear not, at all events not until those conditions can be correctly ascertained which produce the assumed defect of constitution, It has been suggested to me by Mr Oxley, a practical age culturists of this neighbourhood, and of many years experience, that a judicious application of salt to the soil, which acts as a powerful solvent on its constituents, might greatly modify, if it would not wholly prevent, this much to be dreaded epidemic. He informs me that two years ago he dressed a field he was ploughing with common salt, which, for many reasons previous always exhibited more or less rust. He then, as before, sowed it with wheat, and although nearly every crop in the district failed through the drought, he reaped an average yield of ten bushels to the acre, with no trace of rust Unfortunately the experiment was not repeated the following year, but, notwithstanding, this field is the most free from blight of any on his property. Amongst the English farmers, I observe, lime is also recommended, and the immunity of the Goulburn and Bathurst countries from the pest would appear to lend some countenance to the opinion, I fear, however, hot seasons like I euc present may occur, when, as in the case of the potato disease, no human means will be found sufficient to work off or arrest the impending calamity. A clerical correspondent addressed a letter to your paper a few days ago, recommending the sleeping of the grain intended for seed in a solution of lime water as an infallible preventive of the rust, which he stated was the common practice in Italy in the neighbourhood of Milan. I must say I think he reverences egregiously mistaken for in what way the lime-water is to exert a talismanic influence upon the growth and future health of the plant, I am at a loss to understand. As well might he have prescribed a similar bath for an infant as a sure specific against the small-pox, or ague in after life. Perhaps, the rev gentleman was was thinking of the spirit, which is also another fungus, often destructive to the wheat crop, but generated altogether in a different way. Its spores, which are of an oily or greasy nature, adhere to the grain of a farmer crop, and being sown with the reed are afterwards absorbed by the roots of the growing plant, within the structure of which it becomes established an internal parasite. There I believe, it maintains a contemporaneous growth, and Is finally carried by the Bap into the car, which it completely destroys. In order to get rid of this cereal plague it is only necessary, as every farmer knows, to steep the seed in lime water, or a solution of sulphate of copper (commun bluestone), which destroys its vegetable powers, and effectually prevents its appearance in the crop It may be asked, is there any danger of the reappearance of rust in those fields lately so invested with the evils Now although it is true it sometimes assumes on endemic character, remo localities showing traces of it season after season, I do not apprehend a general recurrence of the plague, unless those special conditions of climate or soil, perhaps both, concur in producing the unwelcome visitor. It will be perfectly safe to use seed gathered from infected fields, which, he- and is a pinched appearance, retain no element of the disease, as might be supposed, Such visitations are by no means peculiar to our country, but are common in Europe, and especially in South America, where rust at times all but annihilated the crops They were also well known amongst the ancients, who looked upon them as a ghost from Heaven indicative of the wrath of their offended deities who in this way inflicted summary vengeance on the world It is not my place to enter on the inquiry as to whether such visita- tions ore to be attributed to the operation or a natural or inexorable law, or whether they must be regarded as the interposi- tion of an overruling Providence , but I think we shall do well to recognise in them the hand of Omnipotence and the ultimate good of his creatures the Deity often employs agents which in the eyes of men may appear weak and contemptible, but which, under his direction, are all-powerful to effect his most important ends. The potato disease was originally regarded as a great unmixed evil, and it certainly proved a head national calamity, but who can no doubt its great efficacy in the regeneration of Irish husbandry, and the social improvement of the people' Whether a similar design is to be inferred from our recent misfortunes is not for me to cut, but such repeated failures in the wheat crop shows the danger and uncertainty of an entire dependence on one article of production, and should direct the attention of our rural population to the cultivation of other articles of use, which may eventually prove remunerative I well know the t is merits. of old is bits of occupation, and the prejudice which exists to any new 1 branch of industry , but in a charity like ours, where the vine and the olive luxuriate, Surely some other crop besides when might be grown with a fair prospect of success. The question here naturally arises as to what should be the policy of the Government with regard to colonial prod acts It is one which in a (great degree involves the prosperity of the country, and which should at all times seriously engage the attention of the Legislature To me the reply is obvious enough, and must be apparent to every unprejudiced mind to a young colony such as ours, where capital and population are necessarily limited, and where the first object is to develop the latest and natural resources of the soil, it will be more profitable for years to come, to devote the labour we possess to raise the raw material for export, other than home manufacture. The Government, therefore, will show its wisdom by encouraging all such articles of production, not by a recourse to the false and all but exploded system of protection, which you have ably shown would be a fraud upon general industry, but by a just and equitable system of legislation, which would Invite the investment of capital, and leave private enterprise unfettered. Much, therefore, as I could wish to see the colony grow sufficient breadstuff's to supply its wants, it is very evident wheat cannot be reckoned in the category of such productions There being no foreign market at our disposal, any considerable surplus which might in grown would be certain to re-act mOEt unfavourably on agricultural pursuits, and throw numbers of farms out of cultivation The true policy for the country under such circumstances, is to raise something, less than it actually requires, and to make up the def ciency by importations which it is seen can be managed even at a less, rate than it pays our farmers to bring grain into the market. But I have already trespassed too largely on your space, and these principles have been so frequently ex- pounded in your columns that little more remains to be said upon such subjects but before I conclude permit me to urge non the Government the expediency, if not necessity, of reuniting the loan which was advanced from the Treasury to supply the destitute farmers in the commencement of the year to [exact the obligation would only more efficiently complete the ruin of those poor a people, with regard to whom it becomes a question for serious thought, whether some similar measure of relief may not be requisite to enable them to tide over the present calamity The non-payment of the former loan should be regarded as a tax or contribution levied upon the colony a 'site for a di tressed and suffering community In submitting the foregoing remarks, I think it only just to state that some of the operations there advanced are not given as the result of my own experience or observation, but architect on the authority of others who have devoted much time and attention to the study of such subjects To use a somewhat poetical axprts»ion,Iljavosimplycndeivourcd to make a nosegay of culled flowers, and have brought nothing, of my own but the string which binds them.
