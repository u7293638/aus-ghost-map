She repeated on Wednesday night her very interesting performance of the part of the heroine in "Faust." I have nothing more to mention in con. nerion Srith opera this week, beyond the peiforinance of "Polinto" and " La Travi gta." The last-named was played yesterday evening, with Signora Tamburini Coy as Violetta for the first time in Melbourne. It was a performance which well deserves a line or two to itself, and I must notice it at ipore length when there is the space to spare. It is not so long ago since the band of the 2-14tb Regiment used to play in the Botani cal gardens, to the great satisfaction of all who were present, and many will recollect Mr. MUleri the bandmaster, who came from England to take charge of the band not very long before the Imperial troops were finally withdrawn from Victoria. It may interest the reader to know that this is what recently happenedto Mr. Miller, as I gather from the, Aofidoa Onh&brd; The departure of the head-quarters of the 2-Iith Regiment from Chester Castle for Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, afforded many of the citizens of Chester an opportunity of showing their esteem personally for Mr. Miller, the bandmaster, and their appreciation of the valuable services the band, under his oonductorship, has rendered to the citizens on many public occasions during the two years ana a half they had been stationed at Chester. An elegant tea and coffee service, frein the establishment of Messrs. Lowe ana Sons, was presented to Mr. Miller at mi evening entertainment arranged for the occasion. A complimentary speech was acknowledged with excellent taste by the re cipient. Some well-rendered songs were given during the evening by those present, and a pleasant and harmonious r6unton was hmneht to a close at an early hour. ANDANTE.
