After our eveiyday's / .work, you may be sure we were tired enough ; but we were J eveiy night disturbed in our rest by the clink, clink, clink \ of a pick, about fifty yards from our canvas home. This ( confounded noi.sc alw.ays commenced at midnight, and did ) not .cca.sc until the break of day. One night we weio i determined to see who it was ; so wc- sallied fprth in the bright raooiili.ght, and saw arfigure in a coarse red flannel . shirt, high boots, and slouched" hat, hard at work bj' an old claim which had been deserted for many years. I was chosen spokesman, to expostulate with this noisy digger; but when I was within twenty yards of him, I stood still, transfixed with horror,— for the wearer of the digger's /.clothes .was; aw, a , , V " TTncle Ned i " 'we all, cried, how fearful."
