Wiieu I made his acquaintance he was wearing a robe of the Anglican monk, a cord about his waist, three-knotted, to show that he had taken the vows. He was. the physical likeness of John Storm, and, like him, left his class to serve an ascetic ideal." Mr "Johnny" Toole, according to the lateBt London files, has Buffered a relapse.

It was suggested by Sol" Stone that some other name ought to be provided in place of the condemned word " freak," and that, as the resolutions offered n<> suggestion, the 'matter ought to be discussed by the members of the company, who were purely human curiosities. Mr Graham pointed out that time was too short before the opening of the doors to enter into such a discussion, and that an adjourned meeting would be in order. Tripp, the " Armless Wonder," moved that Tody Hamilton be asked to supply the missing word, and the meeting then adjourned. The resolution read as follows': «• That we, a majority of the living human curiosities in the Barnum and Bailey Show, emphatically protest against the application of the word 'freak' to us, and severely condemn its general assignment to those who, for their benefit or otherwise, were created differently from the human family as the latter exist to-day, and that in the opinion of many some of, us are really the development of a higher type, and are superior persons, inasmuch as some of us are gifted with extraordinary attributes not apparent in ordinary beings." GREENROOM. ( Continued from Page p. J That the New York public is generous in its support of the plays it takes a fancy to is proved by the receipts at some of the theatres there this season (according to a local paper) "Cyrano De Bergerac" was performed fifty-seven times at the Garden Theatre. The capacity of that house for fifty-seven performances with every seat filled, is 9l,203dn|. The actual nceipts amounted to 94,012, or nearly 3000dol. beyond the seating cnpiicity, this surplus representing the "standing room only" receipts. "Cyrano" was played at the Har'em Opera House last w,>ek, when the receipts nmounted to 12,000dol. " The Christian" ran for six weeks at th* Knickerbocker Theatre, or forty-nine performances in all, the total receipts bei g 79,642dol., nnd these for the first week of it* ruu nt t'<e Garden Theatre about U,OOOdol. "The Kunaway Girl" ran for 14 weeks at DjUy'd Theatre, the average weekly receipts being lO.QOOdoL Other successes of the season are " The Liars/* which has run ten weeks at the Empire, New York, the average weekly receipts being 9500dol; "Catherine," which has been played six weeks at tlin Garrick, New York, to an average of SOOOdol. per week; Francis Wilson, who played eight weeks nt the Broadway Theatre, to 78,000doK ; Jefferson De Angelis. who, in three weeks at the same house, played to 29.000dol.; Alice Neil son, who«e five weeks in "The Fortune Teller" at. Wallachs, averaged 10,000dol per week ; May Irwin, who has beaten all records at the Bijou, playing to 21,023<?oi. in three weeks; and "Trelawney of the Wells," which is playing to about llOOdo!. for each performance at the Lyceum—very large receipts for so small a house. Let Biondi look to his laurels. William Williams is rumored to be contemplating a swoop clown on Smelbourne iu Biondi impersonations. Irving Sayles once told a friend lie was not colored, but only born that way. Fact. Writing of Sayles reminds me ("Charcoal") that a Sydney story oncc went to the effect that Hirving wore twelve different suits in one day. A Cremorne attache has developed "Vat*am I" proclivities, and has been christened "The Pawnbroker" accordingly. Apropos of Frank Morriss' make-up in the Cremorne first part and olio—Whoever (writes "Two W's") saw an aubum man with black eyebrows and eyelashes ? A stage comedian is not above putting up a joke oil a fellow pro. In that act in which a long drink is squirted up from below the stage Frank Clark scored one off" George Jones t'other night by giving George A. an unexpected shaudy bath. But the genial Jaarge took it goodhumoredly and no doubt is planning a geteven joke. Will Williams's imitation of Austin Eudd in "Gallery and Boxes" is N.T.B. We have now seen and heard five artists iu the same turn—Priscilla Verne, Miunie Anderson, Alice Leamar, Austin Sudd (the author), and lastly " Pink Pills." It is said that W. Horace Bent, the well-known Australian comique, 6ome years ago while playing in Sydney got " balanced " for his salary. He thereupon left the company and proceeded to Sydney. Some Weeks later, meeting the manager in Sydney, he asked him how he had got there —had he walked? The manager replied, "I never walk," "No," said Bent; " neither does your ghost!" On Tuesday night at Cremorne, when Frank Clark as the " Fakir of Ooloo" had announced that he had "performed this trick. before the crowned heads of England, Spain, America, andYARLOOP," a gigantic jarrah-jerker in the second row turned hilariouBlyto a companion and said, "That's one for us, Pat. He must know e'ie here." Madame Amy Sherwin was to give her first grand concert after her Australian tour in St. James' Hall on January 30, whenshe was to be assisted by a number of distinguished artistes. The new play which Mr Dioni Boucicault will direct at the London Court,, will be " A Court Scandal," adapted from the French by his young brother, Mr Aubrey Bousicault. Mr Haddon Chambers' comedy, the- " Tyranny of Tears," will be one of tho early productions at the Criterion Theatre, London. Sir John Madden's cousin, Miss- Nannie Bennett, is quickly pushing her way/ to the front of the London boards. Seedy Provincial Actor : " Young man, I hear that you propose to essay the role of the melancholy Dane. What induced you to do it ?" Prosperous Londort ditto: " Oh, I don't know. They egged moon to it." Seedy Provincial Actor: " H'm They egged me off."—" Punch." Shakespeare is still at work. The- " Daily Mail" publishes a letter from a correspondent, who says:—"I have received hundreds of communications from the i-pirit Of William Shakespeare, the world-renowned, dramatist, who died at Stratford-on-Avon in 1616. These communications I liavejotted down, and they are available for the perusal of any publisher. They iuclude more than a huudred incomparable songs; beautiful lyrics and glees | also more than a hundred episodes pertaining to the great poet. All that is couutless critics, lovers, worshippers have desired to know has beeii obtained, and is available for public use." The correspondent adds that lie knows theserevelations are genuine; but he says he must make a little allowance for those whodo not. An operatic version of Sardou's " Fedora," composed by Umberto Giordano, has seen ihe light jf Milan. The libretto, follows the drama exactly. Little Kdna Arnold, the daughter of Haus-the Boatman Arnold, has made her first appearance under her father's wing. Mr Clement Scott other leading critics speak well of h9r powers? A New York paper is responsible for the statement of Madame Camilla Urso is appearing at a Vaudeville entertainment.. Madame Belle Cole, prompted bv the su cess of the Newbury-Spada combination, talks of another visit to Australia. Willie Walshe, the Sydhey vocalist,, to whom Dame Fortune has not been over kini since he landed in England, .has been engaged for the tour of the National Opera Company, which commenced operations in Dublin. The leading lady of the torn will be the fair New Zealnnder, Madame Cecilia. Staunton, and the principal tenor Mr Hedinondt, whose brief association with the " old firm " led to such unpleasantness. « Yvette Gkiilbert began to earn her living as a dressmaker's apprentice. Her mother was an embroidreBsof note, but intended her daughter to be a dressmaker, because she thought the girl showed more aptitude for that work. Mrs Patrick Campbell has purchased, from Mrs 'I'. P. O'Connor, the wife of the editor of London " M.A.P," a play that the ludy completed a few months ago. The plot deals with the stormy life of the late Irish leader, Charles Parnell, but the named of the characters in the story are not the bame us were, borue by the men and women whose actions in life are followed by Mrs 0\ onnor's work. The " Era " says that a strong dramatic- ending is secured to the play by the sudden death of the great leader on the terrace of the House of Commons. Mrs O'Connor was. anxious that the play should be produced in Dublin, audit is likely that* Mrs Patrick Campbell, when she visits the Irish capital in March, will do this. Mr Knight and Miss Ferrar have added "Pygmalion and Galatea" to theirrepeitory.' MB. GEO. PACK, One of " The Firm's " Conductors.
