OUR PARIS LETTER. PARIS, April 1, 1897. France has probably had enough of austere people The " austere " Jules Grevy who dragged the Presidency into the mire was the first start of the Third Republic Gambetta, to do him justice, preferred exquisite cigars and truffles to preaching without practice If he were alive now this hideous Panama ghost would have been laid At the moment of writing I can only speak of it as a series of rehearsals for a coming national drama M Nuquetis to London, broken-hearted and ill As in Toolo's " Thumping Legacy," he has asked the president of the inquiry committee whether he will wait till he comes Several depu- ties are imprisoned or out on bail, or carefully shadowed The Palace Bourbon is now a beehive of detectives "Whynot? M rioquot, its former President, deceased, shared the fate of " Humpty Dumpty " for Panama sharp practice to the tune of 500,000 france M Auguste Burdcau, former Minister of Finance, who died in the Presidential harness of the Chamber and who had a national funeral, is now known to have accepted 50,000 francs for working up the Panama report His widow and sister-in-law, a lovely Creole, obtained a larger pension than is accorded to the widow of a marshal of France The speeches at his funeral would have been fulsome even in the case of a great public benefactor Edouard Drumont was imprisoned for three months for daring to hint that 31 Bureau was not a man of screaming integrity It is not surprising to find him jubilant to-day, and suggesting the gruesome compensation of publicly exhuming the remains of this pseudo Aristides A sculptor v. as preparing a monument for him, but this has been countermanded To be candid, French Republican life is in a bad way day People naturally want to know what will be the end of it. The first real cata lead will be some show of disdainful irritation on the part of Russia If Tarnma goes on offer facing the Presidential visit to Russia will lapse The promised visit of the Czar and Lanitza to Compoigne, although friendly and incognito, will also risk abandonment Nicholas II is very anxious to see the old Napoleonic home prepared for the Empress Louise by her amorous husband Once more the Schonbrunn Avenue with its green bisques will be trimmed The sleepy Imperial borough will wake up, there will be plays in the theatre and battles in the forest The disappointment therefore, will be terrible if the festivities do not come off Nansen left Paris this morning on his way to Berlin Altogether his visit to Prince has been something of a damp squib Seeing that the French explo ers are quarrelling amongst themselves and that Boas. shot, after having snapped his fingers in Prince Albert's face at Djibouti, will fight a duel with him when they are both back in France, it was not likely that an alien explorer would be received with anything more than general enthusiasm The French rivals cannot stand the Commanders of the Legion of Honour given to Nanson Had it not been for Prince Roland Bonaparte the festivals and conversazione would have hung fire altogether The Germans will be heartier, und Nansen will probably carry away with him an excellent souvenir of Kaiser William, who is always to the front when he wants to make an impulsive contrast between France and Germany The Concours Hippiquo at the Palais de Pin duHino licks much of the glitter of former years. The aristocracy of French sport is away either on the Eastern or "W estern Riviera There has been a decided improvement in French blood horses El. en in this, however there appears to be a lull The building looks desolate and neglected in consequence of the demolitions that are going on all around Death has made some gaps in the Mackenzie Grieves group, and the Due d'Aumale if not allowed by his doctors to risk the draughts of the Champs Elysees Dr Fauro-Millor and other eminent medical men here consider that Paris, thoJtrh healthy, is the ante chamber of pneumonia The women's costumes are still wintry The Ministers, who are generally assiduous at these gatherings, shine by their absence Henri Rochefort, General Tournier, the Prince of Sagan, the Duchesse dUes, and others stand out prominently The buzzing tribune of ladies of every world looked merry enough this afternoon Liane de Pougy has evidently given up all idea of being a Carmelite nun La Belle Otero scared) recognised her colleague m professional beauty Yvette Guilbert appeared like a tiny crafts amid the throng,; She so me very happy and contented, is well she may be She is increasing her re- pertory of English songs Her"PesÂ«imi" is an excellent creation She says that Albert Chevalier, who, by the way, talks about going to Australia with his manager, Mr Fred Edwards, is following in the same groove with his "Land of Nod ' i work which will once more bring in all the memories of his great triumphs The I rem n army is 11 recently in a state of partial disorgan. ation This does not so much refer to the national defence as to the capricious changes s rich every Minister of "War feels bound to associate with his term of office The English journalist and observer his during the li 115 years seen -1 Drums abolished by General Taree and instantly restored by General Thibuudm, a dreadful person amongst military martinets 2 Boulanger, who was always popularity-struck, allowed the soldiers' boards to push " He also had the sentry boxes painted in resi white, and blue stripes He tried to cheer the hearts of the grumbling reservists as they hobbled bag in hand to the station by music His successor deprived the sentry boxes of their stripes, told the"pi<w pion " to shave, and stopped the band of music, and so the cussedness had gone on Now General Billet in making a marked effort to restore the grand old grade of marshal without the appella- tion This, of course, meets with tremendous opposition, It is undoubtedly a move in the direction of that Imperial army framework which gai o to France n Bugeaud, a CanioDert, and a Macmahon, without counting u Baziincund a Lebcouf The fact is that General Billet, though a stanch servant of his country, is not of a pronounced Republican temperament He feels, with many of the older generals, that the army is becoming vulgarised The promotions are mysterious and founded upon political influences There is a distinct envy between the old and the new schools No war is likely Yet the mere preliminaries to mobilisation would in the present state of things be a per 1 which one does not like to contemplate The criminal doctors have appealed against the sentence of five years each passed on them It is, therefore, premature to adopt the methods of Trench nevvspapenBm, and take sides either for or against the decision of justice The abominable scenes in court after the sentence would not have been possible in any nation except France A mob described by a clever chromquour as the " clique of the clinique,' yelled out, " Death to Ithojurj,"' Down with the magistrates ' " and other epithets It is now clear is that Dr Boisloux and his co prisoner, Dr De la Jnrrige represent the entire tribe of obstetric malefactors who are sapping the life's blood of the French population, and who ship at a oh ince of cutting and operat- ing as a cat would after fish President Delo gorge did well to keep the doors of the Seine Assize Court wide open The roi dations will act as solemn warning not only to criminal practitioners, but to their victims Leon Daudet, the author of " Moi tactics," sat on the bench. The brilliant writer knew full well that there was no excess in his terrible indictment Only a few days ago an operation to prevent appendicitis was proposed for newly-born infants At present the French medical school may be divided into the " knows," who are responsible, and the " dreamers " of the Nancy echoed who seem to be of opinion that every criminal of either sex is cither^bypnotised, auto-suggested, or, in other words, tioned. for murder in a way that makes resistance impossible Russia has played France a nasty trick over the coming of the new roubles As usual, delay and red tape have spoiled the operation to such an extent that M De Witte, the Czar's Minister of Finance, has signed a contract with M Allard, the Governor of the Belgian Mint, for an order of 100 millions of the Mus covers coin I hear that Birmingham will come before Pana in the next order, and it is easy to understand that M De ToviUe, the Governor of the French Mint, although the subject is delicate to handle, does not conceal his vexation this is the first transaction in which Russia in her relations to France has been giving and not taking It would therefore has, been more gracious to have shown a little more patience To-night the inauguration of the French Pass tellers took place at George Petit's gallery in the Rue de Seize It is too late to give any detailed account of a rather thin catalogue Besides I shall have to say a great deal about pictures in my next The ladies' dresses looked much better than at the dusky horse show, and the beauties of the younger tribe of Parisian girls showed great taste in their drap inga I noticed two charming sisters with the Countess Bernadaky, who keeps her impeccably shape, and whose striped vest and dress, with big red buttons, brought out the wearisome contrasts of the girls, who were in clear Havana, with cherry velvet and embroidered biandobourgs The tulle is many coloured, and gave the bonnets and hats quite o transcendent look A bolero collar was much admired by those lady journalists who are supposed to know all about it, and without who o kind whispers I am afraid I would be unable to give any clear indication " Gyp " wore a nice beige coloured tailor costume, and her rose and turquoise took off some of the angles and showed the Comtesse do Martel in her real charm as a cause mauve Miss Clifford wore a prelate coloured costume with surplice lace edgings and soutane buttons Mrs Hart, who was with a couple of of ladies from London, were a costume of dark green foulard with white designs deliciously garnished with white Valenciennes and with lighter green muslin edging This was surmounted by a lenten purple hat with black feathers and small emerald and diamond agree to As usual the Galena Petit was not well ventilated, and this inconvenience brought out some excellent designs in Paris, which are more works of art than over This afternoon's election at the Academy was of vast importance The " Immortals " turned out in great force, and the gathering under the cupola of the Institute was thoroughly representative The occasion was more his toncal than any event of the kind since 1880 M Hanotaux has at last found himself on one of those fasteners where Cardinal Richelieu, of whom he is the reverent biographer, sat so long ago Mme Edmond Adam tried hard yesterday to stop the election of M Hanotaux Juliette Lambert is spiteful and im- pulsive Possibly the young Minister of Foreign Affairs has not cared to drop into the tumultuous surroundings of the feminine admirer of Greece and Russia In any case, her circular or miniature pamphlet, which she was passing about with great slyness yesterday, has had a contrary effect. It is entitled " The Culpability of M Hanotaux," which merely means that he does not agree with the lady, in her view of the map of Europe It appears that M Lucien Millerovo is now the guid- ing spirit of the editress of the Nomelle Keine With Miss Maud Gonne, Mme Clovis Huges, and a whole tribe of sculptress and princesses, there are lively times at the Adam receptions M Hanotaux will certainly find his position greatly enhanced by his entrance to the Academy The visit of Lord Salisbury was the greatest compliment paid by an English statesman since the foundation of the Third Republic Then there was the lunch at the British Embassy by special invitation of the Prince of Wales. The Hanotaux finger also directed the meeting between President Felix. Faure and Queen Victoria at Noisy-lo Sec One can only hope that the same friendly intervention on both sides will make a Presidential visit to London possible Count Albert de Nun, the other newly-elected sends mioian, is the most distinguished of Catholic conservative French noblemen He has rallied to the Republic, and has thereby caused much unreasonable anger amongst out and-out Royalists He will undoubtedly play on important part in the next decade of French history and may be the harbinger of that long-wanted religious peace which France is ever seeking and rarely finds " La Tosca " stops to-night at the Renaissance, and the rehearsals for " Snob," the four-act comedy) of M Gustave Gulches, will be produced on Monday night Another piece which is much talked about is " Borgia," a five act drama, in blank v verse, by M Jules de Gastyno and M Romance
