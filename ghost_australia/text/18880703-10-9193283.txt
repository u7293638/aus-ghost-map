THE COMING "BOOM" IN SHIPPING. The Shipping Guide of the 25th Inst. says : -"Tonnage appears to be the one cry, amongst the brokers just now. Orders pour- ing in from foreign and intercolonial clients for cargoes are meeting with but one reply, no bottoms.' Verily the harvest is plenteous and the labourers few, so far as charters Coat present. Yesterday we took a cursory spin around amongst the leading tonnage brokers, and roughly put together 30,000 tons that could find instant employment at exceptionally good rates, and which, as an old established firm put it; there is not the ghost of a show of vessels being found to do it.' We are informed of hulls which, 12 months ago would not so much as have been thought of being snapped upon terms that would have so brief a period since been looked upon as a flight of imagination by the owner of . first-class vessel. Our own correspondents, we might almost say the whole of them, without exception (we now refer to colonial ports) hat for some time past pointed in by no means unmistakeable terms to the . boom that was gradually approaching. The tonnage famine may be said to be general. In such a condition of prosperity on the one hand, and impediment to trade on the other, it would be nothing but natural to suppose that the colonial shipbuilders would fattening as a sequence, whether this is we are not informed, but have an impress that they are not. More's the pity. The fault is not certainly theirs, for they build cheaply and well, but is due most likely to the comparatively limited, amount of colonial capital which has so far been turned into the colonial-owned mara times channel. When capitalists in large numbers understand that an invest- ment of a few thousands in a good vessel will produce a higher return than a professional money-lender would ask his, most in curious cUenU,thiocsjWil| be, different, and we shall have that which we cannot do better refusals Itoiisji'sjmlM.''
