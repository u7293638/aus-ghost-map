I — ' 1 Keep Out of the Past. Keep out of the past I for its highways Are damp with malarial gloom, Its gardens are sere, and the forests are .drear, And everywhere moulders a tomb. Who seeks to regain ltB lost pleasures Finds only a rose turned to dnst, And its storehouse of wonderfui trea sures Is covered and coated with rust. Keep out of the past ! it is haunted, He who in Its avenue gropes Shall find there the ghost of a joy prized the most, And a skeleton throng of dead hopes. In place of its Deantlfnl rivers Lurk pools that are covered with.sllme. And these groves gleaming white in the phosphorous light, Cover dreamB that were slain In their prime. Keep ont of the past 1 it is lonely, And barren and bleak to the view, Its fires have grown cold, Its stories are old, Tarn, turn to the present, the new I To-day leads you up to the hill tops That are kissed by the radiant sun, To-day shows no tomb— all life's hopes in bloom, And to-day holds a prize to be won.
