THE NOVELIST. "LOCHINVAR."* By S. R. CROCKETT, Author of "The Raiders," "The Lilac Sun bonnet," "The Men of the Moss Hags," "The Grey Man," &c.; CHAPTER XXXIX.-SATAN OUT PARADISE. As he had expected, Wat found the boat safely anchored in its rocky haven, where the water lay dead and still as in a tank. He drew himself on board, dripping salt water all over the inside from his lithe body and scanty clothing. He was busying him self loosening the oars, which had been tied along the side, when he heard, faintly, but unmistakably, the sound of a human voice speaking. At first Wat, busy with his work, paid no heed. He supposed it must be Scarlett talking to Wise Jan, and idly wondered why he spoke so loud. Rut in a moment he remenil>ered that the rocks of Fiara and the deep Sound of Lianacraig lay between him and his companions. Yet quite clearly and continuously some one was °ertainly speaking, and at no great distance either. As before, the cave was ,mt quite dark, for the moon had risen, and the boat lay close by the entrance next the Sound. Wat hastened to climb up on one of the rocky walls which formed the edge of the tiny haven in which the vessel floated. The water-way which constituted the floor of the cave slept black beneath, a long, almost invisible heave passing up from without, which was just the great Atlantic Sea breathing in its sleep. But so smooth were these undulations that hardly a swish on the projections of the walls told of their passage. Outwards from where Wat stood the great lane of water gradually brightened to the huge square of the sea- door. Inwards it grew blacker and more gloomy, till Wat's eye could not trace it further into the solpmn bosom of the rock. It was out of this inner gloom that the voice was proceed ing. Presently the single voice became two, and Wat could hear the words of one speaker, who spoke low and almost delicately, and then of another who more gruffly and briefly replied. From the dark ness of the inner cavern a new sound was borne to Wat's ear-the panting of men in exertion, and the little splash made by the swimmer as he chances position, or when a wavelet, running diagonallv, strikes his breast. It is an unmistakable sound, and vet it is no louder than the plunge of a 'iiap ing fish that falls back again into the water. ' Wat lay motionless on his ledge. He had lifted the moorings from the stern of the boat in the rock basin behind him, and lie could hear that she had swung round ar.d that her timbers were rasping gently against fhe side. Wa! prayed that (lie swimmers miirht not hear the noise. The uneasy pavement of the cavern swayod beneath him with measured undulations, glimmerine with that pale phosphorescence which is the deceiving ghost of true illumi Mition. Yet it was 1 icrht enough for Wat to observe the heads of the men who swain as they emerged into its glow out of the pevtVot darkness of the inner cave. There was one who led, swimmi:^ a <rn,id zen strokes in advance of the cl hers. "We cannot be far from the north pate now, surely," said a voice, which Wat instantly recocmised as that of TWra, "if the cailieach have told the truth, and her man did really find his way to the island of Fiara by this passage." The man who swam in the middle of the three who followed Tiarra on)v (minted in i reply. Wat could see the shapeless round . Copvripht, 1897, hy S.' R. Crockett, in the I United States of America.

And he had no doubt that on either side of him swam the Calf and the Killer, the other members of that noble band. The heads on the water crew smaller and blacker as they passed him, and the men swam on towards the outer entrance of the cave. Presently (hey came underneath the great span of the arch. Wat could see Barra drag himself out of the water and clamber 011 a rnckv point which jutted out into the Sound. The three followers lifted themselves after him. and sank on the rocks in attitudes of fatigue. Rut Barra stood erect, his slim figure so black against the dim moonlight without that he might have been wearing his suit of sable velvet, although actually he was naked to the waist. So there on the pinnacle he Ptood, gazing silently on the sleeping Isle of Fiara. even as Satan might have gazed (so Walter (Gordon thought! on the garden close of that first delicious Paradise in which Adam ?wandered with his Eve. Long be stood thus, fixed in contempla tion. revolving thoughts and intents, his three attendant fiends crouched behind him in a shapeless mass upon the dark rocks, none of them daring to interrupt his musings. Then quite abruptly Barra descended and nlunged once more into the water. Loch invar in his turn stood erect, and made ready to follow him. for he feared tint his enemies were about to cross the Sound and attack on the instant the little comnanv waiting his return under the cb^s of the northern phore. But he heard Barra say, "It is enough for to-night. Let us return to the southern harbour. The cailleaeh spoke the truth." KlI'hltTSUOOD, THK I.ATL* SJK Wliiitu PhoU1) '? T « 11-11 \M « I.
