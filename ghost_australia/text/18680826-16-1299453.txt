WEIT-XONDAYATTUE HORSE SHOE. ' By Peter 'Possum:. MY intimate acquaintances in New South Wales will be amused at my presumption in venturing to write about horses , it will seem to them much as if " honest Jack Robertson" (I charitably suppose that he is still be called) should take upon himself to criticise Dr Badham's quantities I must confess that the horsemanship I displayed in the colony was not of the noble world watching kind-was rather of the species which provokes satirical small boys to advise the equestrian to " come down and got in side" Like the little Jollnby, who notched his legs with records of his tumbles down stairs, I bear about in my body stigmata of my spills in New South Wales 'to say nothing of minor marks, my puffed right cheek often painfully reminds me of the sensation header I took one Sunday afternoon into the South Road sought-after dining at " Tomotco," Cheval's, too ' - from the back of a hack hired at to the livery stable at the corner of Castlereagh street (or Elizabeth street, was it ?) a hack so indignant at the unwonted sort in which he had been handled, that, as soon as he was caught and denuded of saddle and bridle by the nearest hostler he trotted back to Sydney again , leaving me with his harness on my hands, and the possible imputation of having stolen it upon my character The hand with whiohlwiitoisuneymniotrically angular about the thumb joint, from a capsize I got whilst attempting to make my Bengalla " Creeping Jenny" (set apart for my use with contemptuous compassion for my equestrian in capacity) leap a log in the moonlit woods of Edinglassie And I shall carry to my grave the clumsily cruel autograph which a great brute of a New England stock horse, a temporary occupant of the Bengalla stable-" Wan- det or" was the wretch's naino-niBonbod on my right foot, when he flung me and then trampled on me the big coward just outside Muswell broke shamming that he-a New England stock horse-had been startled, like an old England stock broken, by the apparition of a passing bull calf How ever, you may admire horses, although you cannot do them, just as you may admire poems, although you cannot write them That is, when the horses are ino)¿7» admiring-which was not his case, lotmerouiind Wanderer The beast was as hideous physically as morally magnified caricature of the poles" amongst the stock he was wont to head But it is liable to suffer animosity to pursue the dead Exlinclus amateur idem Doubtless, Wanderer by this time has wan dozed into Hadcsi Perhaps he was boiled down, perhaps crows and canon banks, and ants have picked his ungainly bones I cannot help hoping that his end was ignominious, but may his spirit lost in peace If his ghost is anything like what his career was, it would be a waste of condoning compassion to hope that Pluto has not put him into his team Pluto is far too good a judge of horseflesh or shadow To return to support an, although I do not profess to be any such judge at all, I found my way to the Horse Show on Whit-Monday, in company with some thousands of other holiday-makers A. percentage of these, I cannot help suspecting, know even less about a horse than I do no) self-especially sundry bob called light overheated youths, most know singly verbal, and sporting again the blue and green soils and white hats they had worn, 01 shammed to wear, the week before at Epsom but the general tone of the assembly was indubitably horsey Two Frenchmen, got up in English swell sporting style, sent over by the Emperor to inspect, gazed with undisguised astonishment, from the red and white canopied royal box, on the second hundreds of intelligently philippic spectators who hedged the banners of the arena, occupied the long lines of box and gallery seats, and thronged the i refreshment bars of those enterprising "returned Australians," and monopo hsing caterers, Spiers and Pond women were in the minority, but still it was a very respectable minority, and its average of experts Boomed larger than in the case of the males Almost all the w omen there appeared to have gone to look at the horses, because they were able to form some approximation, at any rate, to a rational estimate of what they were looking at There was, I repeat, a generally and genuinely horsey tone in the company There must have been, 01 thousands would not have stayed and stowed for hours in a place which, in spite of its size, and the blue and white awning which veiled the glass, was filled with a generally hosiery fragrance Nearly 400 horses were in the building, and its warmth and ammoniacal odours combined made the great glass roofed hall something like a Titan's cucumber frame Whit Monday was a glorious day one of those brilliantly, calmly blue and golden days which for more than a month have made me fancy myself back in New South Wales until my eye falls on the bush, vivid, virgin verdure with which no evergreen foliage can compare. I may mention, by-the-bye, that I heard the deplorable defeat of the Australian cricketers at Kennington charitably excused on the ground that they were " overcome by the boat." I may also mention that I have experienced considerable difficulty, and occasionally flat incredulity, in explaining that the Blackfellow Eleven are not " Australian natives" in your sense of the word. One friend of mine, who plumes himself on his Johnsonian orthodoxy and grandiloquence, thus addresses me : " Sir, I can make allowance for a fondness for logomachy, but I can make no excuse, But, for a palpable look of candor. In your puerile propensity to dispute the indisputable-much, Sir, as the baying puppy attempts to back out the moon-you have sometimes ventured to question the solidity of my arguments in favor of the common origin of the human race. (It is waste of words, sir, to remark that the want of solidity was in your own shallow un- understanding). But, sir you had lived in Australia-you . had seen hundreds of such men as these - and yet you maintained that time and circumstances could not produce the modifications which I attributed to them. Will you presume, sir, maid to assail their agency, when I see before me changes so marvellous, in color, form, and feature, in the very first generation of offshoots from (with what Bciolistio pretension) you terra the Caucasian stock,' when transplanted into Australian soil ?" The bell was ringing as I entered for Class IX., Park Hooks and Ladies' Horses, not exceeding 15 hands high, to parade themselves before the ridgeS and their assessors, or rather co-stants j a knot of military swells and squir-" archinal old fellows, all plainly branded horse knowing, except one short old gentleman, the most industrious of the lot, who passed about in a slate-colored wrapper and without his hat, looking far more like a school- master inspecting his boys' copy-books than an authority on horses' points. In trooped the beautiful creatures grey, white, golden boy, black, chesnut, bay, due, bright bay, brown, bright chesnut, black brown, dark brown, dark bay, and blue room with all kinds of riders on their backs, old country gentlemen, young country gentlemen, and young town gentlemen, farmers, tradesmen, horse- stealers, swell grooms in spotless buckskins, country grooms in tan-topped boots, and one young lady, with a bright chesnut chignon, on a bright chesnut mare, appropriately named Golden Light. Walk, walk, walk as the baby's recitative has assemble, amble, am- able trot, trot, trot, trot cantor, canter, canter gallop, a gallop, a gallop : So they went round and round. There were so many beauties, that the judges must have felt for more puzzled than Paris. Gradually, however, they weeded out the lot although that is scarcely on appropriate phrase when not a single one of the competitors could, in the technical sense, be called a weed." Beautiful Golden Light had to vanish, because knowing eyes discovered some microscopical blemish in her off foreleg. Grey Kaplan, whose hoofs had sunk in Arabian sands, a present from the Sultan to the Prince of Wales, was dismissed because he fell short of his English competitors in "stamina;" but eventually the first prize was given to the Prince's white Arab mare, Rupee. The Prince is a favorite at the Hall, on account of the hearty way in which he assists at its zoological shows in person and by exhibits. Nevertheless, Rupee was hissed when she received the blue ribbon, whilst the second and third prize takers were lustily cheered The popular judgment ' had assigned the first place to a beautiful golden bay Arab bred by Prince Orloff The owner of another distanced competitor entered into warm controversy with the idea, emphatically informing them that their deep sion was an infernal shame " It was amusing to note the personal matter which both owners and gi ooma made of the appraisement of their riots attractions In one instance, this affection became so ardent as to cease to be ' amusing The nail was dam into her fut," exclaimed a rod faced groom, whose darling bud turned suddenly lame " If I could only spot the dung as did it, by G-, he should never diivoauothoi I I'd hang for him, I would I'd kill him, I tell you I'd pound him about the head till his (double B) of a mother wouldn't known" Whilst the competitions were in progress, how o m, it was equally well to note the police) perfect impartiality which shoulders and di ivors strove to preserve They chatted together quite amicably when ordered to draw up alongside one another for final adjudication, and even passed cautiously courteous oomph months on one another's animals It was only when the judges appeared with the blue red and orange bunches, and the shin green commended ribbons in their hands, that thousands I ceased to look impressively careless When the badges had been distributed, flaunting was the triumph of the door stood prize takers as they rode and drove round the ring Evil were the eyes of the Ball only retiring defeated It would be wearisome to go through all the judgments I may mention, however, the sensa- tion which was caused by the appearance of the Daniel Lambert like Captain Uaigica\os on his brown cob Hero-htoially a dray horse in miniature of "One of the Judges i closely w armed the idea that the "Suppression of Cruelty" officers would be down on him, but "Carry who? Why, it could carry St Paul's," was the general verdict on the stalwarts little engine turnips Another little oddity figured amongst the stallions Sultan, a bay three year old, Just 38 inches high All the prize takers prepared their animals for thou parade after the competitions with loving care, but the stallions' gi come in this respect were specially prominent To lady's maid adioitnoBB they added mother's proudly anxious affection in their situations That figure, however, is a bad one for splendid as was the beauty of the magnificent, national ra and, softly rounded, delicately nosed creatures, it was on Osborne by their masculine pride and vigor as they laughed, curvettes, and dragged their grooms after them at the end of their long leading" mus After the parades, came the jumping BuBhy fences were erected, and the tug became a hunting field The Prince's chesnut gelding, Knight of St Patrick, ridden by a groom, got up exactly after the model of his master's neat hunting dross, leaped some half dozen times, in a condescending sort of way, for the gratification of the lieges, but the others went on the tufted hurdles fast and furious One of the pluckiest of the riders was a little chap of 11, who died at anything, trusting to his equally plucky little flag to carry him over him doroiiB hurrahs ran round the ring as horse I aftor horse dashed over Duoly wore the horses hooted that wheeled round, as if on a pivot, when they reached the barriers Great was the merriment when cool old stagers, not caring to jump, when there were no hounds to follow, sailed through gaps, or quietly pushed the whole concern down with their shoulders There was every now and then a spell, but, since the soil was soft, that only added to the fun and in a second or two the dismounted rider, hatless, or with comically damaged I castor, was in the saddle again, carrying after the others with a wild view halloo I can see that the Frenchmen I have spoken of thought les Anglais a very funny people-to be rushing round and round like that after nothing >
