PRACTICAL JOKING. SUCH terrible results have so frequently at tended the cxtrecmly foolish and highly re* prehcnsible craze some people indulge in for frightening others, tlmfc it is really surprising prntical joking of this description should still be the delight of certain thoughtless persons who only regret the consequences entailed when the harm is irreparable. A fresh, and extremely sad, illustration of the danger attending the practice has just been fur nished by what recently happened at Hills borough, Ohio. A merry making-as the American papers call it-was held there not long since. The party met together for in nocent fun aud enjoyment, and consisted mainly of young persona not out of that happy period of life known oa the teens. It occurred to a couple of young girls that the oppor tunity was a splendid one for playing the ghost; accordingly they withdrew from the dnncing room, made themsolves up to look as spi'otral and ghostly as possible, and Lhen suddenly burst in upon the party. Their appearance was greeted with cries and shrieks of filarm-four young ladies being so terrified thot they swooned awuy. Two of them were sufficiently recovered, after a time, to roturn to their homes, but the other two poor unfor tunnto girls, when consciousness returned, were pronounced by medical men to have hopelessly lost their reason.-Echo.
