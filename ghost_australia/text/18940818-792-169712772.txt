GREAT BRITAIN- PIUS IX. AND CARDINAL MAN- NING ON ENGLAND'S CBEIS> TIANITT. „ ' la view of the Encyclical of Leo. XIII. it will be interesting to quote the following message bom a letter which Cardinal addressed to the Bev.. Dr. Lnnn, editor of the Review of the Ckweke*:—" In May, 1848,1 saw and spoke for the first time with Pius IX. He questioned me at length about the Christianity of England, and about the multiplicity of pood and charitable woifcs done by Anglicans and Dissenters, ending With the Quakers and the great prison reformation of Mrs. Fry. He then leaned by in his chair, and said, as if to himself—"The English do a multitude of good works; and when men do good works God always pours oat His grace. My poor prayers are offered day by day for England." Since that time every year has multiplied all kinds of good works in England. There can be no doubt that an especial power of the Holy Ghost has breathed, and is still breathing, over our people. I gladly repeat the words of Pius IX., for I rejoice over the good works which cover the face of our country. My daily prayer is for England, and, so far as it has been in my power, I have shared your good worln and united with your peaoefol and benevolent aims. In the words which open your first number I heartily agree. Ton say—'The tendency of religion in our day is towards reunion.' Then has grown up in the lut fifty yean a vivid sense of instinct that division is evil and the source of evils. The desire ad prayers for the reunion of Christendom have created movements and organisations both in the Anglican and in the Dissenting bodies, •nd your Bemew iff ike Ckureket is its latest and most resolute Manifestations." —Catkolic Time*.
