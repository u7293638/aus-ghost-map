A CURIOUS EXPERIMENT. A curious photographic experiment (saya the Evening News) was made on Friday morn ing — nothing loss, in fact, than a.n attempt to photograph spirits by flashlight. The ecene of operations was a room in one of bhe main streets of Sydney. The theory was that what was hiddon from mere mortal sight might be seen by the eye of the camera, and recorded upon the photographic plate. The ?' medium '* — a lady of mature years, who wore a aombre c«iBtU'«ie — sat in full view of everybody, in one corner of the room, and alongside a small table. The other persons present were : — Mr. Blow, of the Crown Studios, who took the photographs ; Mr. J ? , a believer in spiritualism, who sat alongside the medium while two of the photos, were being taken ; a representative of the Evening News, who sat beside the medium while the two photos, were snapped ; and a representative of another paper. The camera was placed in the opposite corner of the room to the medium, and carefully focussed. The green blinds of the windows were lowered, bufcdaylightpervaded theroom, and a flame (for the purpose of producing the flashlight) stood alongside the camera. The medium went into what she afterwards explained was a semi-trance, and gave the word as to the number and kind of spirits in the room and the proper time to snapshot them. Eight or nine ghostly visitants were present (so the medium said), including Mr. Blow's mother, who, by the way, is nob dead. They were duly flashlighted on to three plates, but, alas and alack, when the plates were developed the ghosts failed to put in an appearance. Chairs, tables, &c;, were there, bub no spirits. So onco more the unbeliever chuckles.
