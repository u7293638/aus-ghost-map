THE PRESIDENTSHIP OF THE SCHOOL OF ARTS. TO TUE EDITOR OP TIIE DAILY TELEURAPIT. Sir, — Perhaps you will admit now that your sub-leader concerning the alleged reasons for tho resignation of Mr. Justice Windcyer from the presidentship of the School of Arts was based on distorted rumor, instead of actual lilhL J-IUilg U IkUUMU kttltii Ur, Barry was a likely candidate for the position, and no one kuew better than Mr. Win- deycr that in a contest with a good rival he did not stand a ghost of a chance for reelection to a position which, in the eyes of a very largo number, he has miserably failed to properly fill. You have published from time to time letter from corrcspoudeuts, who insisted that the free- thought section of the members were deter mined to swamp the committee this year, if possible, with their nominee. The truth i?, only two freethinkers (Messrs. F. Jones aud K. Eastou) are to be run ; and surely, sir, every section should be represented. There are just 110U finaucial niLMiibers of the institute, and a there are 17 positions iu the management, the freethinkers should not be howled at for at tempting to secure a minority representation. And would it not bo wiser to bury the hatchet under the new regime that Bishop Barry, it is to be hoped, will inaugurate. Let tolerance lie shown by the great majority, and thus prevent the bitter feeling of jealousy and hostility that must arise if any sectiou consider they arc un- iustlv treated.— Yours, Ac.. Jan. 21. A MEMBER WHO KNOWS. .
