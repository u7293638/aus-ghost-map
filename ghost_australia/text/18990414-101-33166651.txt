THE BROTHERS. By SHAN F. BULLOCK, Author of " By Thrasna River," " Ring o' Rushes," &c.;, &c.; [PUBLISHED BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT.] (COPYRIGHT). (To be concluded.) Dennis knocked the ashes from his pipe, slowly refilled and lit it; then lay back on his elbow, crossed his legs, and looking towards the big house went on. ¡" She was'tbe daughter of one James Long, a gentleman farmer himself and a big man ia his Way, .that lives a mile or so beyond the road there t'other side of the railway. She bad money at her back, was an only daughter, au' for the rest was a tight bounçin' lump of a lassie, wi' her share o' good looks an' ways, but, as far as ever I could see, a bit too fine in the bone an' soft in the manners -for yom^farmer's wife. Set her-downat the piano," or put hei" on a. horse,, or sit her in a big armchair wi' a story-book in Jher b¿nd/¿ahVéke was in her ¿lory ; but , . .give her a big cbúrnin- o' bu tter to iriake, or a row o' cows to-milk; or ask ber to -^ ïénd<a"haùd avilie'bay when work was v. throng, an' where was sbe ? Phatî She was worse tb>n useless; she'd muddle things, be in the way, be afraid o'^oilin her .-bands. She was the kind ó* female I have nolikin- for," said Dennis. " Her an'ber likes ought to be put in chairs an'fed with spoon meat. What I like to see in a woman is good temper, good willin' bands on her, a taste for the kitchen an'the pots an'paus ; just that an' a.good share o' health. Good looks," said Dennis, with a snort. "White hands, an'nice teeth, an' the ways of a lady ! /Pbat! Thinkin' o' them disgusts me-disgusts me;" and DenuiB shot \- upright, set his lips., aud looked as fierce as Brian Boru. " Howsomevei', all that's as .may be," "he continued, in a while ; "an' just, now one or pother's little matter. So long as women's women ? an' men fools, so long, I appose, jpiljpyour dolls face be like a candle for tbe\\-moths. Ay, it will ; an' so it. was Wi' Long's daughter. The country went wild «Éter her.

Couldn't he ba' stuck bis toes in the ashes like another, an' made bis \- kaley, an'stole an odd kiss-if be wanted it now an' then, iustead-o'-'? "Acb," cried Denuis, "I can't spake o' such lunacy. It's beyond me. There's more time wasted these parts ruuuin' after women tban'd do to plough the country-side twice over,- bjit when it comes to your English way o' courtiu' I'm, onlyifit for cursin'. The foolishness of it V An' Ned Smith, too-Black Ned! Sure, in a way, 'twas only pure charity whèu, one "day, Harry caste eyes on Letty, goes to pee her father, takes to -vieitin'. at Long's an! sets hiinself to rival the brother. : ' Twas so. But sure -but sure-'twas-foolish, maybe, after all. Ah. it waB. Think o' what came of it," said Dennis,and waggedbisbead dole- fully. "Look round ye an' see what came of it. Look at the bare raf ters up there, an*- the tumbled offices, an' the bare fields. An' all because one day Harry Smith cast eyes on a woman an' set himself to l'ival the brother ! . * Isn't it powerful to the world the strange way things are managed in it ? Isn't woe* ful curious that women can . J&'SJM^' thiugs¿v an* men ¡he such fools P . ÛoesiCji it strike ye as curious too, when ] ye consider all the females that's scat- tered over the countryside, that two brothers must cast their, eyes on-the same woman, an' fall to courtin' bei', au' fall to treatin' each other as if they were strangers-ay' an' worse than strangers P Eh," asked. Dennis, "'what d'ye-think yourself P" "I think With you, Dennis," said I. ' "It is curious-perhaps a little more than that." ? . "Ay," said Dennis, "Well, we'll leave it there, then, for there's no use in talkin'. - ' Maybe 'twas Providence ordered things ; maybe . 'twas only chance sent Harry to Long's; maybe 'twas ' the devil himself j anyway, r he came, au' that's enough, an' that was the beginnin" o' sport. "TalkP The country was buzzin', with it inside a week. 'Sure the queel'-' est thing it is,' ye heard from everyone ; 'the strangest .thing in the world. Think o' the two Smiths after the one girl-think.o' one brother trying to oust t'other-think o' me darlint Letty sittin': yonder, wi' glowering .Ned this side o' her an' laughing Harry-t'otber-side, .'au' . tb ein as keen to outdo one another asyif tbey'were'-bidciiii; fozv thjersamejaorse at' à fair ! Au' listen,' they'd' "say-to : ye an1 look at ye that knowiny' there'll lie sport afore ali's over, an' there'll he murder as' sure as Heaven's above ye, if so be Harry wins. There_will, I tell ye. An' listen: It'll not be Harry that'll give the blow, and it'll not be Ned .that'll win. Is it Ned Smith win, black-faced Ned ! Ah, not at all ; not at all. But wait ! There'll be sport as sure as the sun's shinin'. or the divil isn't sittin' in Ned Smith's eyes for nothin'.' "That was how people talked; an' maybe they had reason. Anyhow, they had plenty to go ? on ; for wasn't the" whole play aetin' goin' on there before before their eyes. Couldn't they set Ned steppin' off after dusk-an' it off for Long's P Couldn't this one see this for himself, an'that one that; an', for the rest, hadn't ye only to meet Ned any evenin' an' look in bis face to see trouble in his eyes P Ah, to be sure. An', Lord knows,- 'twas bard not to pity bim. For what chance bad he against Harry from the very, first dayP Chance! About aß much as a terrier Jias against a bull dog. ;^3bance ! He had none. Is it against bigy strong, h;earfcy,.good- natured, good-lookin' Harry ; ? an' him the eldest ? an', him a maj^isjA'atej an' him.wi' most inoaéy ; a.n' Mmi the ^^t'^At^ ft^m; top to toe thatstepped in County Meath? Phew! Ite ridiculous to think of it. ;Â blind woman'd choose. Harry from & houseful o' Neds. She had only to bear bim laugh, or lay lier hand on -his; shoulder, or sit listenin' to him one night By the fire, an' ¿he thing was . done. Ay, done.; -, " An' Letty wasn't blind, nor the. <father, nor-one pf. his kind. Ah, 'deed they: weren't.: " They: knew how many ; ha'pence made.a penny, ah' how to cut a meadöwiwijen the sky was blue; an' so it happened just as everyone expected, for one day word came that Ned was out on the step, au' Harry inside the ball, an' Letty at Harry's side an' the fox of a father, blesein' them. An' God knows, for myself, I pitied the poor divil of a Ned; for he bad his good points, an' was first in the field, an' the brother did the mean thing an' the unnatural thing to come steppin' between him an' his girl. 'Twai tae chances o' war, I know ; still, "God knows, I pitied the white face o' bim first time I met.iim after his downfall,; I'did," said Dennie, "Cod knows., I did. r " He took it ill, did;*Tnötjiin ¿n open, blustrntiV -damn 'f^^fi^ä^:3ot '«4j7^fö;^^;^ou'U-. úñdéfstflná; ñish. take' sucH things ' in these -?parts-^but jüst as if you'd : bled the blood from bim, br killed the heart in him, or cut him with' insults to the ^rery. quick. The day ould Long refused íi^. Letty-be just rosé. from his chair, tobk dowa^his hat,-an' wi* bis face like ashes, walked out wi'out' a word, an' borne: - An" that night he didn't speak, nor the' «ext day, an' hardly a word for weeks ; an' when Hairy comes to him wi'his hand out, an' the cheerful word' on his tongue, an' bim.askin' for for- giveness, Ned ju6t shivered in his boots, wheeled round, an' marched off to the fields. Nothin' 'd make kim laugh. Ble «.voided everyone. The only thing he'd speak to or look at was the dog. If Harry met him he'd turn bis head and pass-; if he'd speak Ned 'd nod an' tighten his lips. He had bis meals by himself. He went about like a ghost, his head down, his bauds behind bim, an' his eyes Durum'. .... An, God knows, I pitied bin». Jïe was foolish au'hard to understand, au' sure no woman ever bom was worth such sufferin' ; for all that I was sorry for the boy, an'.there wasn't a woman' iuHJ*e county but cried bitter tears for-him,'' au' not a man but was angry with Eawj in histbearfci 'But if ye spoke to Hair^. au' some bf us did. too, he'd only laujp;h at ye; au' if ye d:;ied pity Ned he'd stare at ye ; au' so things went on. "'Twas a great weddin'-tlie finest thing o' the kind I ever sec eyes on. People carno fvof$ all parts to it, from Dublin, the-North, sorrow knows where. There were «s many ca « l iages, with prancin ? horeep. an' the drives sporting tockays in their coats, as you'd see at the funeral of a landlord. Cutside the church was at crowd as big as jf 'twas election day ; An' there waB herself all muslin and flowers ; au' there was Harry in^his coat wi' skirts to it; an there were tbö^^autrfnl^riäesmai&. äii, tte buld father in bis . white ? hat,- an' the friends ia theil' Sunday b'est^-an'odiöus : fine gatherin' entirely.* 'But there was no: Ned, not' a eight of bim; an' we all ? nudged each other at that. ' Where's ; Ned ?' we'd say, wi', our eyes On the carriages. ' Where's Ned?' An' the women "d wipe their eyes'an' say, 'Ah, the crature; the poor, unfortunate crature!' An', if some of us muttered a-wcr.i of a curse, may God, who knows what happened afterwards, forgive us. "Sure it 'must ba'been bard'on the boy ; it must: To wake, up an'think, 'She'll- be' married theH day-';-to sëê Harry steppiu' off in his grandeur an'" kr.ow where he was goin' ; to look at bis watch an' think, 'Shes manyin' upw';' to sit up;- yonder in - his room an' know that the knives au' forks were clatterin' in Long's parlour, an' the corks poppin' an: eveiyono laughin' an'; speech if yin'; to Le :r at last the carriage come back, fin' Harry, nmnin', up ¿he stairs an', knockm* at the dooi", an' then Letty the wife kiiockin' an' savin' : ' Ned, Ned, won't ye speak to meP Won't ye wish us well P' an' him to sit there an'never '.buswçr-ëv .«tfc î..then,"ià tue', end,-to look out o' the windowan', see..ihem drivin' ! off . ^> the. honeymoon-sure, aw sure,', for a- man likened to. have to pass such a.day, niúst'Jia'; been ^Puvgatoiy-itself; lt.. must.. .

She did it well ; carried the thing off, they say, as if ehe was English born and used all her life to grandeur; went. I laughin' and sinfín' about the house, made herself agreeable to the servants an' everyone-ay, to everyone but Ned."
