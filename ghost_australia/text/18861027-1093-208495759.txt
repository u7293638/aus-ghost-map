CAULFIELD TRAINING NOTES. [By Telegraph.] Melbourne, October 26. The weather was bitterly cold this morning. Bonnie Lad, Carnarvon, and Geraldine brushed over six furlongs in good style, the former having slightly the best of his companions at the finish. Eugenie and Upper Crust galloped half - a - mile in fair time. Mia-Mia brushed over seven furlongs, the daughter of Drummer finishing strong and well. Warfield put in some nice striding work on the grass. This horse will win a good race ere long. Ambassador slipped for five furlongs in food time. The Ghost, who has disappointed is trainer on the last two or three occasions, ran a very fast round, and .on the last turn he accompanied Ben Bolt over the first mile in 2 mm., the Cup horse going strongly and well. The former eased off after finishing his task, and allowed Lando to go on with the son of Newbold to the home turn, when he ran into a hurdle and got rid of his rider, who luckily escaped serious injury. Delamia looking "pink" was brushing along on the tan. Carnival ran five furlongs for useful work. Glen worth and Lady Lovell, the Maribyrnong Plate candidates, left five furlongs behind them on the grass. This pair are very forward. Phcebe Walton put in sharp exercise on the tan. Preston was treated to a spell. High land Chief and Blondin circled on the grass for a round at a useful working pace. Epi curean bowled along on the tan. Silver mine, who seems to look better every day, finished a good sound gallop over two miles, finishing well. Gadfly, Empress, Crane, and Grace Darlmg were on the course, but did no "watch breaking." There was a host of others working, but owing to the threatening aspect of the weather the trainers finished early. Bohemian and New York did not put in an appearance up to the time of writing.
