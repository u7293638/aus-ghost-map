I say, it was ;the most t ruly awful calamity that could possibly befall ahy family, infidel or Ghnstian, that could be conceived 'in the. mind-of nian, or ghost. .How m'uch mdre terrible did it seem in this little cottage, Where all were Strict me to Iters of church, prayed, saijg hymns, and Tead the Bible. Poor Mrs. Teed! Ood only could possibly have, known the awful silent agony wrung front her suffering heart. .< She feared for- her children's lives; her household furniture, her: home ; and yet she loved; almost with a mother's love, 'her ddmonized and most unhappy sister, ahd would not, nay could not, drive her, from her last'"refuge' Many a time I have heard Mrs. Teed say, , while the scalding tears ran down her cheeks, that she believed some:day alL would be well again-" That God was stronger than the devil." On Tuesday, June 24th, I was anxious to ascertain if the ghosts would cause the lid of the 6tonechina sugar-bowl to disappear as they had the day before, ;and at breakfast I placed it, with the lid on, to the right of mj plate. Esther and I nearly always breakfasted together. As l have stated, the- Teed- family, all having to go toTrqrk- early, took' break fastntsix o'clock. I generally rose> abbut eight o'clqck, when Esther ' would prepare the; tneel, and then I if she' had not alretidy taken hire with' the others, a rare occurrence, she would breakfast' with ine. 1 When I placed the sugar-' ibowl to thc right of my plate,' she wks Bitting directly opposite me, Mrs."Teedr the only other/pereonin the, cottage, toeing at yrbrk hi the kitchen.' I removed the lid tuid placed it ori the table beside my' cup of coffee, put iugarin the . ; and "hacf almost ptt my haiid [ to put it on the sugar-bowl, to. kpep ,t,he I | flies b|it, when it disappeared-Hfehijto : jteltfed.into the air.' I at brtce'tciiie4 Esther's attention to the fact, and"in'' formed Mrs. Teed that the lid had goiie again. Both she and Esther searched the room inisaiuifor abouteiglit minutes, I, meanwhile remaining "at the table. Finally, Mrs. Teed returned* to : Her woitk in the kitchen and Esther went ttf-i ward:the pantry. I watched her closety; at.the tipne, when, to my great surprise;' just as she had laid her hand upon the pantry door to open it, the lid came from inside ihp..pantry, being pushed through a broken pain of glass over the paptry.,door,; and , over whifh br<ywn paper haji heen pasted, aud fell, Iron); tba£.brbkpn(p^in to the floor, distance: i pjrr^iiy.lWtee.ti feet from the..place . oi), t^tatiie whence it had be?n taken frpiR besitJamy pj.atel The pantry, door- iad,; not been open while I, was in . the rppm, and yet the ghosts had carried tfyelid inside while the door was closed, and then pushed-it through the broken pane, in the transom, aljovethe door just as I have stated. During my residence in the bouse it was an almost daily occurrence for the ghoststoliring articles from trunks; and clospts that fre all knew were docked, and to also ' place articles; they carped from various parts of the house into tliese same trunks -and closets while - locked, where we afterwards found,theip. During breakfast the ghosts knocked upon the table aijd produced. £ perlect imitation of--whatever bounds I called for, which were drumming, sawing wood, rullbitig wet linen garments' on' a wash biara jand thfejr hlso. knocked to'rt-ect; timfejorithe bottom of the -frble while I! whistled several- popular aits. AfteW breakfastseverAl Wives were thrown !.'iit' me.'bqttts usual; I dodged them. ' 'In the forenoon, while dinner .was cooking, the ghosts''placed a'large red,1 earthenware croqk, half full of salt, that wa& Ww'ays kept Standing in the kitch'ih cupboard, upon the dining-table: The tea-kettle was at the time boiling on 'the kitchen stove and a beafsteak frying iri| an iron pan, having a handle about ten ' inches long. Both the boiling kettle and panftrith the frying steak were taken by the invisible power, the ghosts, from the stove nnd placed side by side oat in the yard, on a large flat stone step before the kitchen door. This occurred while Mrs. Teed was in the kitchen, 'Esther, being near her, and while Daniel Teed was washing his hands 'at the1 sttiall wash stand kept in the kitchen for that pur pose^ and while I stood in the 'doorwAy leading Irom - the dining-room to the kitchen, * talking to him. All saw it. The day was clear, and the time war nearly twelve o'clock. The ghosts then threw two khives at me., t asked their names, and was informed by knocks that conveyed information to the effect thaf they were ghosts. -Just after the dishes had-been removed by Esther and Mrs Teed, when dinner was over. the- dining-tab!e was turned completely upside down., right before our eyes, by the ghosts, and remained in that position until 1 placed it on its feet again,' when the ghosts set a bundle of rags on fire' in the pantry. In the afternoon, while il was in the parlour, the ghosts knocked upon the walls and floor while I carried on a symbolic conversation. with thetp by the system already used by the family when I went there to' board. Aid the, -names given by the ghosts On thii occasion, as on all previous and future' occasions,, were the. same. .. I put on paper each name, and whatever else they said; and the r written matter upon the paper, when read afterwards, cOnvieyed the . following information: Maggie -Fisher, died aged twenty-on? years i had been dead twelve years ;sa<d'she was in hell,' and that ' her sister Mary Fisher, was 'in the' hou« with her iyesterday,' who had been dead three year; iand wps nineteen years old %heh she died; Lat6* in the afternoon all the ghosts' rive hie their names by kht^kiugi'' ati'd; ascertained that the leader 'otiiieifi'' . mas " BobNickle.".
