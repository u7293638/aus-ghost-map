The render must not imagine, because I am reticent, that any of us who so large as to find a difficulty in squeezing into his allotted berth. Such a thought might arise from the circumstance to which I shall next allude - One, who shall be nameless, in taking his bath 12 punt, next morning, found a difficulty in making a comfortable dip, with large rotundity coming back from the operation much scratched with the comminuted and decomposed crustacea that abound on the beach There is something inexpressibly delightful in inhaling the morning mr, before it is worked up by the sun and, it is not surprising, therefore, that when down the Day we are all early risers. We passed another pleasant forenoon knocking about, and in the afternoon headed towards FiBhorraan's Island. We wanted to get into the Brisbane in time to carry the tide up with us, so that our principal work in the Boat Passage was to heave the lead and look out When the wind is favorable, we sometimes take the outer passage and enter by Francis' Chan ne!.

Much more notice has been taken I aforetime of that famed ancient navigator of Warwick, who, in his cruising days, seldom passed the "assemblage of huts without firing off a " broadside ¡" and, as he seldom - sailed with a companion, he has been known to horse while performing his little service of respect, touching which only a Rabelais could- ' discourse eloquently. The swallow wind" , floored our turn (or rather turns, for there are many of them in this troublesome bit of naviga- tion), and we came up the river with facility until off Kinellan, whence we had to overcome the intricacies of " Humbug Reach." But we - got up at last, and mooring off Parker's Slip, bade "good-bye," with mutual good wishes for our next trip. " We have some of the salt of youth in us," and, as we tried to our respective homes, I am sure we felt all the better for our three days' absence from the " big smoke" of Brisbane Well, after all said and done, there is little that is satisfactory in my spunyarn. For fear the reader might think I have " leased" it to tenacity, I may mention that if the arbiter of the broad sheet favors this, I shall by- and-bye endeavor to write with more precision of the things worth seeing in the Bay-both south and north ; with a few notes of black life on the islands. Our young men of Brisbane complain of the lack of amusement and for their sakes, I should like to assist in popularising the Bay, and advancing the interests of yachting in this port. TIM SBAY.
