THE ORIGIN OF OUR NATIONAL EMBLEMS. ' TnE ROSE. THE wars which so long devastated England were carried on under the symbols of the Red and White Rose. The adherents of the House of Lancaster chose the red rose as their mark of distinction, whilst those of Tork chose the white. The fratricidal war continued until the union of the rOBeB by the marriage of Henry VII. with the Princess Elizabeth of York in 1486, since which time the rose has continued to be tbe emblem of England. TILE SHAMROCK. When St. Patrick landed in Ireland, to convert the Irish, A.D. 432, the pagan inhabitants were ready to stone him. He requested to be heard, and endeavoured to explain Ood to them as the Trinity in unity, but they did not understand him, until he plucked a trefoil of shamrock from the ground, and Baid, "Is it not as possible for the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be one as for these three leaveB to grow upon a single stalk?" "Then," says Brand, " the Irish were convinced, and became converts to converts to Christianity," and in memory of that event they have ever since worn the shamrock as a badge of honour. THE THISTLE. When the Danes invaded Scotland on one occasion they resolved to adopt a stratagem, and, in order to prevent the Scots from delecting them, they marched barefoot. The Danes thought they should reach the camp in a few miuutes, when suddenly a man who went forward was so wounded by a stout Scotch thistle, that he could not help crying out loudly with pain. This noise roused the camp; the Scots flew to arms, and the Danes were vanquished. The thistle was afterwards adopted OB tho insignia oi Scotland.
