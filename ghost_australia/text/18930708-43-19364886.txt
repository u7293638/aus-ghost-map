THE STORY OF ANDREW FAIRFAX. BOOK II. PREPARING FOR HIS WORK. CHAPTER XXII. "O'ER MOOR AND FEN." ROBERT BURNS. " Thou hast me forsaken, Jamie 1 Thou hast me forsaken i Thou bast me forsaken, Jamie I Thou hast mo forsaken. Thou canst love saither, go. While my heart is breakin' Soon my weary een 111 close— Kever mair to waken, Jamie, Ne'er mair to waken!" Just as Andrew waa going out, he heard n timid knock at the door. On opening it be saw Amos Crews standing then tremb ling nnd cold. " I couldn't bear to eeo co go alone, he said, " I feel I must go with 'ec God '11 rife me strength." ... . "Amos, Amos," ssid Andrew, "it must not be. You are trembling, almost faint ing now." •• I've corao fast. I was 'fraid you would be gone, but I'm in time, thank God. I couldn't stop or rest, sur, ef I thought you'd be alone. I shnd go mazed, sur. I feel I've got strength, I must go weth 'cc." Andrew led tho old man to a chair. His eves seemed to flash with new light, he did not ato">p so much as usual. •• I'm 'fraid I ain't a done my duty by 'cr, sur, and 1 be thinkin' as 'ow the poor maid have thought th%t I was 'ard wi. 'er. I ought to 'cv guarded 'er better, sur, and I ought to ha' bin more tender. She's my own maid's cheeld, she ea, and I loved her lile my own life when I said cruel things to 'er. 1 must go weth V, I must brine 'er 'ome; and then—then the Lord's will be done." " Amos," said Andiew, " if you go with me, I'm afraid it will kill you." " tt'U kill me if 1 dom't, Uaaster An drew," answered tho old man. " Why, to think that little Kitty, bearing a burden of sorrow and ahaauie, should be out on sich a night as this; while heronld granfer was lying warm in bed, would be terrible. No no, nur, lev me go weth 'cc, lev me help 'cc to find 'er, lev mo see 'er eavfe home, and th«n—well then may the dear L»rd U»tc me home." Andrew Eawtheio would be no use in trying to diuu\de him, so going to the kitchen ho tried to get something to itrengthen him for his journey. His land hdy had gone to bed, but he knew where the food was kept, so going to the larder he took therefrom a jug of milk and some eggs. These lie took with him into his little sitting-room, and pouring the milk in a saucepan and patting it on the fire he began to exercise his knowledge in cookery. After old Amos had drunk a large dish of hot milk with new-laid eggs beat up in it, he looked far more strong and capable, and ihen having wrapped him np warmly with some of his own clothes, Andrew led him out into the cold and Bilent night. ■' We'll go to St Lerrick first," he said. " If we have a chance, we'll inquire about t her on the way; but I am in hopes that ire shall find her in the workhonse there." "We never shall," said Amos tremu lously. "The maid '11 go further away than that. Come on, sur, como on." But their progress was not great. An drew had to accommodata his steps to those of the old man, who, although he toiled on bravely, was still weak. "We'll stop at Morgan Cross," said Andrew, after they had gone on in sJencd for some time. " Morgan Cross; why F" aaked Amoi. " She may have g >ne by train." " Ah, I dedn't think of that; but I doan't bleeve she es." -WhyP' " She ain't a got no m lacy." •■ Candy may have given her some." " 'Aye you seed young Cundy, Maaster Andrew t " " Tes." " Will 'cc tell me what you said to aich other 1" Andrew told him. " You msy call at Morgan Cross and in quire, Mauler Andrew, but she edn't gone by train." * Xo ?" " She ain't a got ns money from we, Haaiter Andrew, 'cause we ain't a gotnoan ourwlra, and she wouldn't take noan from he. She wudden't, sur. She edn't that eoart of a mud." They came on to Morgan Cross presently and found the Btatiou gates locknd, but they roused up the station master. No. he had not seen Kitty Crews. He wai certain that Bhe had not been at the station that day. The next station, more o»er. was more than five miles away, and it was not probable that she had gone to that. They trudged on again. It was now far put midnight, and the roads were very drear. Still the night was light The moon sailed high in the heavens while the rimy frost reflected ita silvery light Ordinarily Andrew would have enjoyed lie walk, but, remembering his mission, and remembering, too, the sorrow of the old man to uncomplainingly trudging on at his aide, he could not realize beauty or enjoyment. Often they had to stop and rest ; often Andrew tried to persuade Amos that when they came to St Lerrick he must go to some place and rest while he pursued his •earch alone. But to this Amos would not (•ten. " No. sur, I'll stay weth "cc," he would cay, " and I blceve the Lord es goin' to oake me useful. lie tould me to oome welh 'cc. Bur, and you'll be glad that I've oome. Besides, she's my own maid's cheeld, and I must be the one to find her." It ni three o'clock in the morning when they arrived at St Lerrick. They did not expect to find her on the St Keot side of this littln town. Andrew hop d that the would call at the St Lerrick workhouse and spend the night there, bnt Amos derived no comfort from the thought "Thedear cheeld w^an't go there," he said sorrowfully. Still he did nothing to hinder Andrew from calling to s», and kept on uncom plainingly by his side. And to it came aoout that the workhouse, or as the people called it, "the Union" was the puce to which he made his way. He had some difficulty in getting a hearing here, but he succeeded at length. Had a girl about eighteen called, a girl fair and patient looking, decently dressed, but evidently in Borrow ? No. such a one had not called. Wai, the man sure P Tet. he was sure, for this reason. There was not a single soul in the vagrants' ward, and such as she would be put there, md with this answer the door was shut in his face. Amos heaved a sigh of relief, as they came away from the workhoi>ee. He seemed glad thathii girl wu not there i at for Andrew, he waa disippointa L "That knocks hope number one on the head," he ttid. J It. wasn't 10 hope of mine," said Amos. 5( Xo?" " No. I knawed the deucheeld wudden't go there. Ded 'cc hear what 'a said? " There'B nobody in the vagrants' ward,' my maid would neTer be a vagrant. Why, ahe's my own maid's cheeld, and brought up to hate such things. Weth wa down here, Uaaater Andrew, people wud ruther lie in a pig's hotue than go in a vagran's' ward. No, no, the cheeld hat got too much ov her owld panfer in her for that." Although Andrew had lived in the country for Beveral months, he bad not yet realized the innate respectability of the labouring people. True, when they got old they got parish pay, and it waa a terrible thing with them to take it, and worse still when a few of them had to be «ne inmates of the place they all kakti Bnt they wore brought to a terriblo ex tremity first. As for going to the work house as vagrants, that was too terrible to be thought of. For a time tho young man hesitated as to the next step to take, lie would gladly have gone to somo place to have rested, but tho great Borrow on the old man's face forbade him any rest. In spit* of hU age, too, Amos seem endowed with now strength. He did not break down as Andrew thought ho would. His sorrow made him strong. "Let us go on, Miuutcr Andrew," he •aid- " I'm 'fraid the poor maid cs out in the could. And, aw my dear, she'll die cf ■he ea." Ho Beamed to havo little idea as to where he wu going. Ho trusted evoiylhing to Andrew, only tho fact of hit trying to find her seemed to easo hi« aching heart. And so Andrew went on with him, trying as he did so to devise somo plan of action. Presontly he saw a policeman. He would ask him whether he could give him any information, bat the man knew nothing. He had only bean on duty a few hours, and ao knew nothing. Perhaps he might Icarn something if he went to the polico station; it lay on the ouUkirU of tho town. And so they made their way to the police station, Androw, stalwart and strong, Amoa leaning on his arm, bravely struggling by his side. To Androw there was nothing suggestive of a police- station in thia.qui«t liitie build ing. Usually there was but little occasion for tho police. The chief occupants of tb« little place were either poor follows over come by drink, or perchance some one brought up for petty thefU. He found a sergeant of the police, bow over, and put Borne questions to him. But he soon found that great intelligence was by no means characteristic of a country policeman. He was quite free about giving the date when ho got his stripe*, but could give do information that would help tbo two tire-I wayfarers. They were just on the point of coming away when a man, a constable, entered. "Kb if, a Dice, clain-looking maid you do main i" he asked, on hearing Andrew's query. " Yes." " Well, Bill Blewitt was spoking 'bout ono when we mit to-night." " How t Tell mo." " Well, Oill Blewitfc es tho pleeceman over St Judy. He's tho biggest man in the division. Ho do stand six foot fower in boa stockin's, and cut hould up two fifty-sizes, one in aich 'and and as aisy as winkin, he can. Well, he said that he seed a maid going on by 'erself, 'boat 'leven o'clock on tho way to St. Linkin. He spoke to 'er, BUI Blewitt ded, but she wudden. say nothin'. Bill was goin' to take 'or up as a vagrant, 'cc was, but she tould ho sbo was goin' to some friends." "On the way to St. Linkin—do you known where that is, Amos ?' " Iss, iss," answered the old man tremu lously, " come on, come on." "Did she tell blewitt nothing but this t" said Andrew, turning to the police man again. " Nothin' else, nothin' t'oat Bill Blewitt es a good-natured chap. He wudd'n 'urt a worm, he wudd'n. Some policemen wad 'a her happrchended I speck." " Come on, Haaster Andrew i my dear, come on,,' mnrmnred the old man. " Does she know any one that way ?". " No, no, nobody." "Do yon think you can go any farther yet ? Are you ttrong enough ?" "Go furder! Strong enough! Why, thedearcheelt ea oat in thecoald, and she do think that she edn't welcome at 'ome. Come on, she may bo dyin'. Bleu 'er dear heart. Como on,' Haaiter Andrew, and may the Loard help me." " H ire you anything to cat here ?" said Andrew, turning to the sergeant. "Can you sell me something to strengthen the old man ?' "1 cian'tait nothin'," murmured Amos. "Acap of tay?" replied the sergeant. " 1 can give un that and welcome, besides a snack or bread and butter." " Give it to him," said Andrew; " and you, Amos, you must have it." Ho looked beseechingly into Andrew's eyes, but took it like a child, and after a few seconds drank with evident relish. By this time it was nearly five o'clock, and in a little while morning would dawn. Andrew watched Amos, and noted, with satisfaction, that hi) head began to droop and his eyes to dose. A few seconds later he was sleeping soundly. " It will do him good," ssid Andrew to the sergeant. "I will let him. sleep till seven o'clock; by that timehe will be more ready for his journey." Before seven o'clock, however, Amos awoke, and almost angrily asked Andrew why he had let him sleep, when his poor maid might be perishing; bnt Andrew re ceived the poor man's rebuke quietly, and soon after the two went out of' the little | town together. " Wem goin1 to find her to-day," the old m~n said. " Why do you think zof " I doan't know, 'cipt that somsthin' tells me so. I feel it. Either liviu' or d«ad, we shall find her." " God grant that she may be alive." "Amen," said Amos, the tears trickling down his cheek. They found very little encouragement on their way, however. Mo one that they met had seen her, and Andrew began to fear Policeman Blewitt's story was false, when they entered the little village of St. Linkin. At house after house they in quired whether a young girl had been seen there about midnight, but no one answered in the aiLnnative- They were all in bed at that ti :ie, they said. "Does *ny one in the village lit op late?" ulced ■ Andrew. Any one who might hare a light in the window f" "Hobody but BeUy Flew." " Who is she t" " Well," said the woman of whom the Question was asked, " she's mazed, some o zay, and some do zay that she's awitoh. But she's a *plendid doctor, she is. Why, tier's Tom Crawl's cheeld. Doctor Lowria from St. Lerrick, did give 'er up, bat th' oall Betcy cured 'er. People do zay that the cheeld wur ill-wished, and that she charmed it away, "is she an evil woman then ?" "Mo, she's quiet enough, ounly she've got funny ways. Sometimes she do stay up oal night, she do. Th' oull people do say 'tes to make hell broth, and work charms, but the young people do laugh at it. Bcem to me the Board School be maken 'em give up oal they things. But th'oull Betsey es a cure, she'd knaw every thing, and nobody docome threw Su Linkin without she seem' 'em. Some do zsy that she caan't never slaip." Amos groaned. The old mm was among those who had not shaken himself fre» from superstition. " Th' oull BUI Liddicoat do zay shove sould herself to th'oull Scratch, and es tryin' to bait un whan he do come for her." This she said in a whisper. Andrew dragged Amos on. lie easily found old Betsy's cottage—a low. mud walled, thatched tenement They found the old woman crooning over a peat fire. St Linkin was near a piece of common land, where peat could be had in abund ance, hence they were better off than the inhabitants of St Kent Andrew asked the old dame if she had teen a young girl resembling Kitty, and toon saw that he had not aaked in vain. " Its," the old woman said. " l.wur lookin' ont laast night, when I hecrd mn bodycomin'. It was • poor maid. She wur cryin', and axed if I could leave her slaip 'ere. I seed the was in trouble, and I Uived 'er. Poor chceld! I've got a grandcheeld 'bout her age. She went away 'boat eight o'clock." " Did the say where she waa going ?" " I could'n git nothin" out or her. Hut she do want friendt, and that right bad." " I'm 'er u'ranfer," atid old Amo«, tiwtra loualy. " We'm coin' to finder; which weydedthegof' F "On towards 8n Whiffle. P»|* she «'B git in the Union there. Poorm»id!" | Evidently tho old crony hadn't a bad heart, and both Androw and Amoa were relieved to know that the poor girl had not been out in the cold ail the night. Andrew gave the old woman a couple of shilling, and the two trudged on again. For a time the young mw was in hopes that they would soon overtake her, but to wards noon old Amos' strength began to give way. The abnormal energy which for a time had made him overcome, his natural weakness had spent itself, and now he waa fast becoming incapable of walking. Itut he would not yield, and although ho clung eagerly, and loaned heavily on his companion's arm, be struggled on by his side. Houses were scarce here, and there waa no place of re freshment for miles, and Andrew ilenpnired of getting Amoa on, when they saw a farm house not far from the road. Here they got some dinner, and again the old man became eager for Mb journey. " Let me try and hire a borso and trap," said Andrew, but to this Amos would not agrca. "It would only hinder tho search/ he said, and so the young man had still to support the old one just after noon snow brgtn to fall; An drew feared greatly its consequences at first, but it proved to bo only a shower, and did not much hinder their progress. They found ont little to help them about Kitty, however. One man had seen a young woman answering to her description, and ho wasn't very sure. Andrew had grave doubts about tinding her, while old amos' lips often became, tremulous, and hia eyes had a despairing lork. Presently the light began to wane. They had walked the last three miles without seeing a single person of whom an inquiry could be made. They were five mile* from St. Whiflin, there was no chance of getting a conveyance, while Amos was quite exhausted. •' We'll havo to give it up for to-night, Amoa," aaid Andrew, bnt tbo old man said nothing, he was looking steadily on the ground. " I think we must try and get a bed at a farmhouse somewhere," but Amos did not speak. " What do you see f asked Andrew. For reply Amos pointed to the ground, while tears of joy Irukled down his face. CHAPI'EB XXIII. VTIIIRI TIIET rODNO HER. Together they knelt.-, .: . . " And sobbed out the prayer which tho Divine tenderness uttered for us, and which has been echoed for twenty ages biuco by mil lions of sinful and humbled men. And as he. spoke the last words of the supplica tion, the mother's! bead fell down- on her boy's, and her arms closed round him, and together they repeated the words, 'For ever, and ever/ and ' Amen.' "  —Timckibay. At first Andrew could not understand what the old man meant, bnt presently he saw a footprint in the snow. "It's her's!" cried Amos; "sho had they shoes mended jut nforo Christmas, I knaw the clout at the toe." ■ " Let us follow quickly than, for light will soon be gone." They crept slowly on, carefully keeping by the foot- marks, but presently had to stop; thoy had become so indistinct. For a few seconds Andrew left Amos alone, and walked on by himself, watching care fully all the way. When he came back he said: "■ Something bts happened, Atnon. She hM not gone towards St. Whiffle any further; at any rate, there are no marks." But Amos did not answer. His head was bent close to the ground, as if he still saw something. . . "She's gone up this line, Maasler An drew,/ he said slowly. •• My eyes be sharpcr'n yours. Come on." Andrew looked and found that the old man was correct. The footsteps boro to wards a lane which evidently led to some firm or mill. He opened the gato and the two passed in together. The snow was deeper here, being undisturbed by the wind, thus the tracks were far more clear. It was well it was so, too, for the light was failing fast, and before them was a wood through which the road led. " What indnced her to come in here, I wonder?" thought Andrew aloud. . " She kntwd she cudden git ti Sn Whiffle to-night," said Amos, " and she seed a house, I 'pect. Poor deoar maid. I hope we'm in time, Maai>ter Andrew." The w^od proved to oe one of stubbly undergrowth, with here and there a tall tree, bat the road was good, and the foot marks tolerably plain. Tho wood was perhaps a quarter of a mile long at this point, and. before they cam a to the end daylight had gone. Still they did not fear. There was no reason why she should turn aside from the road, and although they could not trace her, they had no doubt that she had gone to some houie to which the road led. When they got to the end of the wood Andrew struck a match and searched for footprints, but could see none. They walked on a few yards and looked again, but in vain. . ■ " Andrew, Maaster Andrew,'.' said Ames tremulously," surely nothin' didn' 'appen to'erinthe'ood?" Andrew was silent. . " Tedn' to use goin' on ef we caan't zee the dear maid's tracks," ooutinned the old man. "Listen." . They could hear nothing. - " 1 thought 1 heard a moan," laid An drew, " hark—there it U again 1" " Es et the pore maid dyin", 1 wonder i" said Amos with quavering voice. '" "It comes from th» ralley," said An drew, " perhap* it's not she. May be it's only some cattle in a shed." " Ler us go and see," said Amos eagerly. " Yes, there it is again," said Andrew, "come on." He jumped over the fence as he spoke, and found his way across a meadow, when he stopped and looked around him. Yes, clou by him was a shed, evidently used as a sort of cattle house. It was in a sheltered place, too, and evidently in tended for a kind of refuge in hard weather. He made his way towards it, heating another moan as he did so. lie was not long in reaching the house, and on entering spoke in a whisper. " Is any one here ?" he asked. There was no answer, bat he thought he heard a movement among the straw. " Kitty, is that you I" The only reply was a smothered sob. "Xell me, Kitty, is that you?" he re peated. " 1 am Andrew Fairfax. You know me." Still no reply, save a trembling noise amidst the straw. Andrew struck another match, and in its light saw the prostrate form of a womin. He held it close. Yes, it was Kitty's face. She had dragged herself here—perhaps to die. " Kitty, my girl,"said Andrew," Kitty." "Graafer doan't knaw, do'a. Ooan't tell granfer." " Why ?" " I've disgraced un. He'll never bould up hes 'cad agtin. I dedn' want—t cudden bsir ts see the look of pain on hes face, so —I—l come away. He woan't mind now I'm gone.' " Your grandfather is longinjt to aoe you home. His heart is breaking to sco you." The light went out. " Doan't light no more matches. People might find out There's a mill jitt a little way up. You bean't tellin' me the truth. Ho must bate me, I'm sure." "He loves you more than ever. Ho wants you to come home. Your grand mother, too, is breaking her heart because you've gone away. Come home. All will be well* " I darn't.

Here's Mautcr Andrew,—" he losked around the shed, as if expecting to see the young man. But he was gone With rapid steps, he had found hiß way towards tho mill, leaving them alone. " I wadn' 'fraid to die," she went on— "at least not after a bit—l thought at first that everything wus black, an' it seemed as ef there wua some evil things round me. but it oal went after a bit, and I wadn' 'fraid. Hut, granfer, I seem so far from home." " Can 'ec walk, my bootif ul t" asked tbo old man, tenderly. " Andrew '11 hould 'cc one side, and yer ould grander the other.

Do 'cc think I shall die, granfer ? I doan't mind, lie doan't love me no longer, an'—." The girl hid her face in her grandfather's shoulder again. ."

"L wonder now—l wondei now—cf —" ■ Andrew came up panting;. " The mill is close by," ho said. " They are kind people, there. Kitty can stay there if she will, ? Or they will load •us a covered spring cart." .... .-.5: j "Thank the Loard," said Amos, fer vently. " What will 'co do, my darlin' ?"

" I can bear anything now, irranfer." Andrew rushed atrsy again, and a few minutes later they heard the sound of horses' hoofs and of wheels. They mtde the miller's covered cart comfnrtablo and warm. Andrew borrowed bed- clotbes and pillows, and in a few minutes the poor girl was seated therein, with her head leaning against her grand father's shoulder. " X knawed 1 shuld find 'er," exclaimed the old man. joyfully,- " I tould 'cc so. Maaster Andrew. You wudien'ave found her but for me. Bless the Loard for His goodness, !'»» got -'»r uto. An.yon. Maashr Andrew, aye, my detar booy, the Loard '11 reward 'na." They started the journey home, Andrew seated on the seat outside with the miller, whilo Amos and Kitty were within away from the wind and cold. For a time they rode on in silence, the miller evidently de siring to say something. lie hitched and twisted about a good deal, as if in pain to bring forth tbo thoughts in his mind. •■ 'Lati'jns of yours f" he said at length, jerking his head t jwards Amos and Kitty, " N"o," replied Andrew. '■ The mtid yer sweetheart, I spoase ?" "No.1 "Ah—but—but you be a town's chip, hoan't'ee?" -Yes." "Ah," and he looked at Andrew sus piciously, and was silent (or fire minutes. Then he said— ■■-..

A spicketty dove corned to my wioder the night afore 1 war married, and again afore our Hosea wnr b»rn. he did, as sure as I'm called Zacky Cowl in." It was a weary journey to St Neot, to Andrew a painful one, for often he heard Kitty sobbing and Amos trying to comfort her, but the miller kept on talking through it all, evidently desiroui to im prove Andrew's education. At St. Lerrick Andrew left the cart, and called at ihe doctor's house, after which he walked beside the cart, for he was cramped and cold He would hare gone on ahead, for ha could go falter than the ambling hone, but he wanted to be near, lett Kitty should need help that Amos could not give her. When they arrived kt St. S'eot villagi*. however, and seeing that Kitty eeemed all right, he ran towards old Amos' .-ottage, in order to prepare for their coming. By this time it was broad daylight, in deed, far into the forenoon, but they were not noticed, for which the young man was glad. He found poor old Sally sitting be fore the fire, rocking to and fro. Two nights had her husband been away from her, and she knew not where ho was, and this, added to her anxiety about Kitty, had completely crushed her. She looked up at Andrew's entrance with a look of beseeching in her eyes. "Maaster Andrew ':" she mid. "It's all well." « Kitty t" " lioth Amos and Kitty will soon bo here." "Praiw the Loard for oal Mil marcies," she cried, the tears trickling down her cheeks. A f<iw minutes later the cart diew op in front of the cottage. CIIAPTKR XXIV. XAW AND WIFE.

He was greatly rejoiced that this was the case, for he felt himself unable to do any more. It was now three days since he had had any proper rest, to finding his way to bis lodgings, he threw himself on bis bed in order to get some sorely-needed rest. When he awoke he heard some one knocking at his bedroom door. He found that it wa> broad daylight too, and for a time he could hardly realise his where abouts. "Mr Fairfax, Mr Fairfax," satf his landlady. " Vcj, all—right. Hare I ilcpt long ?" " Evor since yesterday noon." " Anything tho matter t" " Amoa Crews wants you." "Amos; oh, all right. I'll be down soon." lie harried downstair*, and found tho old man waiting anxiously. " Will 'cc come np to our 'ouse, Maatter Andrew ?" he uid, tremulously. " Anything tho matter P" "The deear maid do want to sco 'cc, aurr." Andrew quickly ate the breakfast that was prepared for him, and went on by Amos' side. The old man did not speak, but he looked in the direction of his cot tago, and there was a dreamy far-a«ay expression in his eyea. " Is Kitty well enough to see me ?" asked Andrew, as they oame up to the cottage. " She's waitin' for 'oe, sur, waitin' for 'cc." Silently Andrew followed him into the room whero the young girl lay. She looked very pale, very fragile. " You wanted to see me, Kitty," he amid, gently. " I'm gpin' to die, Maaster Fairfax. I'm goin'todie." . " Don't say that," replied the young man. -■ She shook her head. "I know," she said," 1 know. Do you think I would hare asked you hero else ?" and a flush came on her pale cheek. - " But I'm not afraid to die, no, not a bit." "Bless the Loard," said Amos, fer vently, "she's one of the Loard'a dear children, for oal the world may say. I tell •'cc the golden gates of 'eaven will be opened wido for she." •• I believe they will," replied Andrew. "I've no fesr,". said the girl, "no fear. At first I thought there could be no hope for suoh as me, and then I seemed to see Jesus speakin' to Mary. And I seemed to hear Him say, • Yer granfer have forgiven yon, and I love you a thonsand times more than he. I came to die for you.' I've bad no fear since, for I seem as though I've been restin' with Him." For a minute there was a silence, then she-went on i . • -••■-■ " But—bnt—l want to bo his—hi* wife afore I go. I've no name, you know, and I want to be called Kitty Candy afore I go," and the looked up into his eyes with a beseeching look. . - -■■-•:  Andrew saw what she meant. ■ .- -• " If it can be, it shall be," he said. Ho went away without a word more, and hurried across the field towards Tre- Tadlock. He was not long in finding the young farmer, and without hesitation he told his story. "You main that I mnst marry her?" said young Sim. . '• "Just that" "Bat what will Miss Martin say ?" <" Cundy," said Andrew, "you mast do this. You're killed her, killed her as surely as if you had stabbed her to the heart with a knife, and now you shall make what reparation you can. The girl is your wife in reality, you must make her so in the eyes of the law." ' Tot the' first time lie seemed to realise what he had dote. Hitherto, he had seemed only afraid of consequences, caring nothing for the sin itself; now, for a minute, he seemed to see hirowK as he was. •' She loves you," went on Andrew, " she was ready to sacrifice everything for you. Be a nun, Cundy; do what you can now." "Is it possible?" ho said at length. " Can we bo married out ov church P" " I will arrange everything," said An drew, " if you will be a man." For a minute theyoaog farmerstood as if fighting with a great temptation, then he burst out passionately: " No, by heavens; you shall not do it. I'll doit. 1 only love she—my Kitty. I'll go and spaik to the passen, and everything. Come weth me—come!" Thero was a new light in the young farmer's eyes, as he took hold of Andrew's arm. ' " Where are you going ?" asked An drew. " Goin1 to Kitty." He spoke no other word till they reached the cottage, where they mat Amos. The old mail's eyes flashed dogerously as he saw hit grandchild's destroyer. >f What do 'cc want here ?" he asked. " I want Kitty, I want to see my wife." For a minute the old mm seemed atonnod, then he led the way to Kitty's room. The two entered together, and Kitty looked up with joy in her eyes. " Leave us alone," he said to Amof. "I want to be with my wife." There was new strength, new power in his Toice, and wonderingly Amos obeyed. " Have you left them alone together F" asked Andrew. ■ "Ye«, and 'ere's mother, she's come away too," and Amos turned towards his wife- • . . In about a quarter of an hour young Sim came back. " Come with me," he said to Andrew, • and see that I dp the right thing. I hate you, you're made me seem like a deviL But never mind, I can be a man as well as you. Kitty's my wife, do yon hear ? Tell everybody that X said so. My wife! I'm goin to the pasien now. I want to ar range erery thing 10 that he can come and inwry us. Do you see ? I want to make haste ! Kitty may—may — come on, quick!'' The two hurried to the rectory, and were soon closeted with the clergyman. YouDg Sim told his story, told it as though he were anxious that all eril should be laid en him. " 1 want 'cc to mirry ua, Pasien Child*," he said ; " the ci my wife, but I want oal the world to knaw it." The clergyman spoke of the irregularity of the proceeding. "That's nothing to me. This Faiifax says it can be done. Tou must come and do it. Do you hear P I'm going to make every arrangement, and as soon as pos sible I'll let 'cc knaw." T*o days after there was a curious gathering at old Amos' cottage. Kitty was still alive, but her face was flushed and her eyes flashed strangely. Parson Chi Ids was there too, and Andrew, and young Sim, and the doctor. "It all ready and right ?" said the young farmer to the clergyman. " Yes, ye», I believe that—" "That'U do. Now. Fairfax, you shall see that I'm a man m good as you. 1 love Kitty ; she's my wife. I'm going to make her so by law. Passen, an you ready P" They entered tho bedroom. Kitty lay panting on the scanty pillows, with a bright look in her eyes. She watched Sim's face with an anxious ex pression, and then, when he came to her aide, she took his hand and caressed it fondly. They arranged themselves around the bed, while the clergyman opened his book. " Oranfer, granny," said Kitty, " I should like to have the—the sacrament before I—" " Have you bread aad wine t" said tbe clergyman; "if so, it cam be administered at once." " Hauler Andrew- brought soase wine laast night," said the old woman with quivering voice, while Sim looked angrily at Andrew, m though ha loathed the thought of hU doißg amrthiu which h« himself ought to have dome. The wiM wm brought into the room, and poured into ■ cup. " If there were time, we might have bad the sacrament cap from the church," said thn clergyman, aa he prepared to ad minister the sacred rite. " Let granfer give it me," said Kitty, tremulously. "It would aecrn better from him." The clergyman looked indignant, and seemed about to sprak, but cne look at old Amos' face checked him. There wm the look of an inspired prophet in his eyes, and heelleas of the rector's presence, he fell on his knees. " Let us pray," he said. There was a wondrous power in his voice, as though Onn mightier than he spoke through him, and in spite of every thing the old priest knelt with the rest. "Dear Loard," said Amos, in faltering accents, " Thou knowest that one of Thy little children hey come back to Thy great heart Tha doctor do say that we caan't keep her here, Loard, and so we come to Thee in this way. Thou didst come among ns to t«U us of Thy love, and to show us the way of life, and now we commemorate Thy dyin' love. Thou art very near to us, Loard. We fuel Thee, and so we know that this sacrament will be very precious to our souls. Save us all from sin—help as to forgive—even our enemies. Ay, they who've wronged us, as Thou knowest, Loard, 1 do, and Loard Jesus help us to say. Thy will 1* done." They rose from their knees, and then Amos, with trembling limbs, but rever ently, partook of the bread and the wine, and gave to the dying girl. " 1 know the dear Loard do forgive me," she said, " for I love Him so, and I have such peace at my heart." Several times the rector seemed about to protest, but was unable. A hallowed presence pervaded the room. A Power was there ~hich forbade priestly assump tion and bigotry. They seemed to be all led to the heart of things, and saw that re ligion was of the Spirit and not of form. " And now/ said Amos, " will you do your work, Maaster Childs ?" The rector opened his book again while young Sim took hold of Kitty's hand. Solemnly the old clergyman read the service, firmly and steadily did young Sim make his responses, while quietly but dearly did Kitty say the words that made her his in the eyes of tho law. " Simeon Cundy, wilt th»u have this woman to be thy lawful wedded wife ?" •' I wilL" " Kitty Crews, wilt thou have this man to be thy lawful wedded husband 7 . ." "I will." Young Sim placed the ring on her finger, while a wan smile crept over her face. " . .. In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I pronounce yon man and wife I whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder." " Parson, are we married now, are we P" "In the eyes of God, yes; but you must sign the—"' " Bring them here, quick." The books were brought, and each signed, Kitty-writing her name clearly and legibly. '• Are we married now t" asked the young farmer again. "Yes." " In the eyes of the law I" " In the eyes of the law." "Do yon hear that; Kitty ? You are mine in the eyes of the law." She looked np at him with a glad smile. "My husband," she said,softly. She lay back on the pillows, while a greit change came over her. A film crept over her ejos. ■'Help," cried Sim, "her hands be gittin'cold." The doctor came near, and shoot his head. "She is going fas*." he said; " the un natural strength which she possesied is gone, and now she will go out like a spark." ■' She mustn't," cried the young farmer "She's my wife, do you hoar, my wife! Look np, Kitty, my darlin'; spe%k to me. You are my wife. You are Kitty Cundy.'" But Kitty spoke not, while her eyes closed. All stood silently around by the bed side and .vatched the dying girl. Pre sently she looked np again, while her hands pressed those of her husband. " Willyou kneel nnd s»y • Oar Father' with me ? she said to Sim. The young farmer knelt down, sobbing like a child. " I always loved you, Kitty," he mur mured, " only you." She did not reply save by a wan smile, and then began the Lord's Prayer Word by word they repeated it together until they came to the words, "As we for give them that trespass against us," then sbe stopped. " Whom Oodhatb joined tot-ether let no man put asunder," she murmured. " And we are— ?'' " Man and wife," said Sim, huskily. "' For evei and ever P" she murmured. " For ever and ever, so help me, God." Her mouth moved as if she said Amen, bnt they heard ne words. For a minute they thought she had gone but the life was not yet extinct The lips still quivered, the breath still came. After a few seconds she looked np with a glad look in her eyes. " Yeu are sot disgraced," she said, look ing towards her grandparents, " 1 am his wife." Tears trickled down their wrinkled faces while Sim said, huskily— " Yes, my Ood, my wife." " For ever and ever," she murmured, ss if in a dream; then a shiver passed thtough her frame—and they knew that all was over. . Old Amos looked at the sweet placid face, snd lifted his eyes upward. " Lord, now lettest thou Thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen Tby salvation," he said, solemnly, when one by one they left tho room, leaving the man and wife together.
