A BOOK ABOUT JAPAN. From the country of Sala same-the land of upside down there has reached us (through Messrs George Robertson and Co ) a very charm- ing and delightful book about Japan It is entitled " Sights and Scenes on the Tokiado," and on examination resolves itself into a collection of excellent collotype reproductions of photographs by K Ogava, photographer, of Tokyo, and still more interesting and evidently thoroughly appreciative descriptive text in fair bold type by James Murdoch, M A to anyone who has given even cursory attention to the study of the history of Japan, and the manners and customs of its curious and interesting people, this valuable volume of notes and p causes will be an acceptable and welcome book Sir Edwin Arnold has familiarised us to some extent with the fascina- ton and aUure- ncnt1* of Japan, and the unsolved riddle of the place and its quomtl--foreign strangeness have cast their captivating glamour,. over the imaginations of many who have been attracted towards that quarter of the world as perhaps, the last refuge of old-world life and character It is true that Japan has been ex- ploited by Americans and Europeans and that it a veil of mystery h 13 been lifted But it should be remembered that it has only 1 can really open during the last quarter of a century to Europeans and that the class of people who have visited it, after all, have been rather commercial adventurers and summer tourists than the s udent of life and manners in they survive in this relic of' what is fairly entitled on all grounds to be described as an old world civilisation This book is tastefully gotten up in harmoiiiou-lv-tintod binding, and in that quarto size which allow of the most advantageous display of the illustrations to which every ulter nato page is devoted The include, as Mr Murdoch explains, is the Road of the Eastern Sea, skirting the V line from Tokyo to Kusatsu, a distance of 20 miles It was laid out by Iyoynsu, the for rider of the Tokugawa dynasty of Shoguns Dr Kaomp'er described a came) along this Appian way of Japan 200 years ago To-day, the writer of this v ci V readable letterpress assures us, " in certain of its sections the Tokmdo smacks more of old J spin than do run) portions of the wild interior There are sights and scenes to be met with in the stretch of 20 odd miles between Tokyo and _ Yokohama that are extremely quaint and queer, and in a mud fashion typical of the drifting fragments of the old life of the people" before the Revolution of 1848 These pictures include views of Japanese outdoor and indoor life, antique customs, funeral processions, and sent grave yards, rustic bridges, dancing girls, types of the population, tea houses, roadside and country scenes, all very clearly reproduced by the collotype process from the original photographs In his compila- tion of the letterpress Mr Murdoch has drawn upon the memorials of old tray others and his own experiences, and has succeeded in imparting a vivid interest to the cloverly-oxccutod -lustre- tions In "Nada the Lily " Mr Rider Haggard has made a bold attempt to enter the circle of historical romancers Casting aside for once the proter natural element which distinguished the wail s by which he made his name, " She" and "King Solomon's Mines," he has given us, under the thinly) veiled disguise of a native story, the history of the great Zulu Napoleon, Chaka, the man who, by his military genius, built a nation out of a number of scattered and hostile tribes We learn much of Chaka and he bloodthirsty, as inimical ways in the tale The author his put his words into the louth of one Mopo, an aged and blind Zulu witch doctor, and in order, presumably, that he may not bear witness against the truth of the ni native, kills him at the end of the volume The pages of the book deals with blood, there is. slaughter in almost every word of Chaka Yet by his action the Zulu military organisation, perhaps the most remarkable. the world has seen, was brought into being "It was Chaka," writes Mr Haggard, who invented that organisation, building it up from the smallest beginnings When he appeared at the commencement of this century it was as the ruler of a single small tribe , when he fell, in the year 1828, beneath the assegais of his brothers, Umhlangana und Dmgann, and of his Bei vant Mopo, all south-eastern Africa was at his feet, and in his march to power he had slaughtered more than a million human beings " It is this same Mopo who tolls the story, sparing none of the hideous dot ads, and relating how he, as the chief doctor and right-hand man to Chaka, saw thousands killed and tortured, saw tribe after tribe destroyed, until the day came at last when Chaka himself fell a victim to the assassin's speak Though Mr niggard has closely followed the history of the epoch, he has not denied himself a certain amount of dramatic license, a freedom of description, which adds greatly to the interest of the story The superstitious Zulus gave credence to many ghost stones, there is a haunted mountain, where a phantom pack of wolves raged through the night, and where the wolf brethren reigns supreme There is love-making, though only a subsidiary degree, there are hints of the coming white man who is soon to conquer the land, and above and through all there is fighting Everyone plays and kills in this truly barbaric land, until at last nearly all the dramatis persons; have disappeared, and only Mopo, the blind and fugitive Zulu, is left to tell the tale The story, which, in its sen ii form, is already familiar to many readers, is now made accessible to all by its inclusion in the colonial library published by Messrs Longmans, Green, and Co.

The volume forms one of the handy little Golden Treasury series, pleasantly printed in fair type, and of a size convenient for the pocket Though the motif of the story is simple it is but the narrative of a boy's every -day life at a great English public school-the elegance and truth of its diction has won for it a remark able popularity The pseudonym, an " Old Boy " is still preserved, though all doubt as to the author's identity has long since vanished, and Mr Thomas Hughes, Q C , now an English County Court Judge, is recognised as the writer The success of the story may be gauged from the number of times it has been re-issued since its appearance in 1857 It has even been done into French, and Messrs Macmillan alone, since the first Golden Treasury edition was published in 1808, have reprinted it six times from Mr G A Head, of Strathfield, we have received a poem in manuscript, with illustrations, written with the object of exciting sympathy with the movement against cruelty and inhumanity, and suggested more particularly by that destruction of sea-birds to which attention has been somewhat prominently drawn of late Mr Read has written lines which bear ample testimony to the strength of his personal feelings on the subject, and intelligently as well as sympathetically expressing the popular sentiment in the same direction Each stanza comes an appropriate illustration, poetically conceived and gracefully executed indeed, of the two the artistic merit of these sketches is superior, though the verses themselves are highly creditable to the humanity and proper feeling of the writer The reader cannot but feel interested in this effort to cultivate a humane sentiment towards the lower creation, or refrain from wishing Mr Read every success in placing his really artistic little essay before the reading public Many of the sketches hero submitted to us are very happily conceived, and in design and method the publication Booms exactly of such a kind as those London publishers who give special attention to artistic illustration might be expected to take up.
