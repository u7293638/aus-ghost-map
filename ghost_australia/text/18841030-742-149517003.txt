DREAMS BY ' WIDE-AWAKE.' To the Editor. Sib, — If I take any supper I generally dream about politics — I leave to psycho logical research as to the reason ; but last night I was evidently one of an influen tial deputation (as the papers say) to wait on half a dozen eligible gentlemen, aad get the promise of one to stand as mem ber for Launceston. Weii, sir, we waited on the patriotic six, and when calling on the first, novr, thought I, Mr Wide- awake, is the time 4o deliver in your best manner that neat little speech you have prepared, beginning with ' Ah ! hum !' and a little deferential cough, which is considered the correct thing on these occasions. I then launched out with — ' Sir, — A few fellow citizens have called on you, well knowing your ability and practical good sense,' &c.;, &c;, &o.; ' Stop, stop, stop 1' he cried, raising both hands ; ' I know all you are going to say. If I have the ability and good sense you kindly give me credit for, lam not going to sacrifice my business and ruin my family by neglect ing it during three or four months in the year while attending to your interests in fiobart. No, no, I most emphatically decline, at the same time thanking you.' We backed out, called on tha other five, but all gave equally cogent reasons for declining to be self-sacrificing patriots. Just then I saw a ghost, none of your traditional churchyard cross-bones affair, but a pleasant-looking genial sort of fellow, evidently accustomed to good society, aud ia his hand he carried a banner with the words inscribed on it, ' Payment of members.' In an instant a'l our difficulties vanished. I awoke, crying aloud 'Eureka,' and am now still. — Yours, etc., Wide-Awake.
