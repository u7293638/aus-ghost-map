TENURE "BY GROST." VAnemou kinds of tenure of house 'property are recognised by English law--soage and fiefs, oopyhold and lease--but it has been reserved for the judge of the Whiteehapel County Court to discover in his jurisdiction an entirely new one-tenure by ghosts. And it seems to be a very substantial one. There is a house in Brook-street, Rateliff Highway, which many years ago became honoured with the patronage of a ghost. It was never seen, but as it made plenty of noise, and persisted in dancing hornpipes in clogs, it was supposed to be a relict of a seaman ao onstomed to frequent the sheebeens which at one time abounded'in the locality. All the inhabitants deserted it, and for a long time the house was a kind of "'No Man's Land," in which no one would dwell until a daring adventurer named Beesley defied the ghost and took up his residence in it. No one ever asked him for rent, and when he died he left to his widow the whole of the estate, con silting of the haunted house held on ghost tenure. In due time the lone woman married again-this time to a gentleman named Yates.
