CHAPTER XVIII THE SOLUTION. Mr. Eurdick did not reach Naples, aa fat had ex pected to do, on the morning' after he had an connced to his wife his and ienly-lormed intention of making a second visit to that city. On leaving the two ladies he had found alarge foreign mail for him, just sept to him for his bankers, and some of it , required immediate attention. It was late oh the evening of the second dayfollomng that he reached the Grand Hotel—too late to do 'anything bot go to hed. In the morning, after breakfasting, he started out to see the American - consol. Hit course lay through the beautiful gardens of the Villa Nazienale.the pleasure grounds of Naples, lying along the curving bay. He could hardly explain to himself why he should be here. His coming seemed, to him now almost an no accountable impulse. There was nothing tojostify | it bat a girl's fancy. But then that fancy had been so strong/ and held with such tenacity, that he really wavered in hie own conviction as to her illusion. He felt as though he must satisfy ' himself again, and there was bnt one way. That ; was tb rough the Swedish consnl at Naples, to whom the aftiir had hern entrusted. Bat now that he was away from the glamour of Clara Mowbray's per sistence in her own faith, he was saying to himself that hie visit could have but one result—a certifi cate of tome kind from the consul as (o the un doubted fact of Mr. Dorm-en's death. That m gbt help to produce conviction in ber mind. _ _ He was walking briskly along after Ida habit, whether bent ou pleasure or business, and had > reached that loveliest spot of the embowered gardens where stands the little temple to VirgiL JfW'cyrs were bent on the groand, The Virgilian j temple would have had no attractipneiofjtoarie^ to'him.' The gardens are usually de& rted in the ; forenoons^ but he heard a footstep before him, and lifted his.head. Christopher Dorms en or Christopher Dormeen's ghost was not ten paces away and Walking rapidly towards him, an ex pression of surprised but eame-t greeting on his face. Mr. Burdick stopped, paralysed,and received Dormsen with no expression but one of unbounded amazement. He held out his hand, mechanically to the yonug man's .grasp, and was conscious of a sensation of relief, whrn he felt a strong pres sure from a real hand of bone and muscle. Dorm sen spake first. " It is so great a pleasure to tee yon 1" , *' How—botv did yon—come back I" murmured Mr. Burdick. It was stupifjing. "I came back the day before yesterday. I came at once as soon as I knew," his voice falling as he Said the last sentence. "Yes—I dare say. I would—If I had been in your place—end could. But bow did you do it J * *'They telegraphed me from Norway, from Christiana. They did not know where I was nt first and they made the same mi-take in iny name." "Oh I Thry—didn't know wh re yon wl er.! I think I could have told them." \--—■Oh, no,-Mr. Burdick, I was at fault. I did not write to you, as I promised. But it was a hard struggle for me to try and forget her, and I waited. So you could not know wh- re I was." "Well—perhaps not, hot I could have made, a good guess. I shouldn't have thought of sending yon a id-pram though. I—I did't know, there was a line." " And 1 hare heard of all yonr kindness, Mr.Bnr dick, and of all the pains Mr. Thorn don took, and I thank yon both—I thank you both 1" " Oh, yon hesrd of all that, did you 1 Did you hear it where yon were, or since—since you came back?" " Since I came lack, of course. I heard it here." " From whom, please." " From my consul." "Let's go and see him." He had kept hold of Dorm sen's hand during their dialogue and kept equetticg it, as though to assure himself continuously that it was genuine. Now he dropped it end took the other's arm and turned him round. He kept hold of the arm as they Walked along, but the dazed look did not leave bis face. "I regretted," said Dormsen. "that I could not stop in Borne on my way through to see yon and thank you, but 1 intended to go there from here.", "Oh; yon cams back through Rome, did youl —and did yon—oil yon yo through Borne, too!" " Certainly t You must, if you go all the way by rail." ' Mr. Burdick glanced at him sideways as they walked on. and presently he said, with a profound sigh, " Well, I am learning something any way." ! " But why did yon come to Naples so soon, Mr. Burdick?" " Why, I came—to see you. Dormsen looked surprised. | " How did you know I was Vvi»" a " Well, I left you here, and t"5 * every retson ■ to suppose you would rtay—for a wfiUe." "You left me here, Mr. Burdick 1 That is efrange I did not 'meet you here," "N-n-no, not exactly. I suppose it would be ; more correct to say that I met you, hut not, perhaps, that you met me." ' "You speak in riddles, Mr. Burdick." " Well I 111 be hanged if I am any more of a j riddle than you are, Dormenl Look here 1 " He J stopped short as he spoke and faced the yonng man, i gazing into his eyes, and, while not letting go of ,bis arm,gentiy felt aloug it until be reached the j band, which he grasped couvulri rely.

" Dormsen returned the gazi in sileneea moment, and the look of astonishment gradually faded . away, leaving only the signs of his >orrow. " Ab no, Mr. Bardi<-k! I thiukl begin to understand.
