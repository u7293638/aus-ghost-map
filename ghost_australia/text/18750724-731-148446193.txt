ON RECIPROCITY IN THE AUS TRALIAN COLONIES. ; — ; ? . . I The ghost of rccij rocity still stalks . in outer darkness ; the medium potent . enott^Ti to mptfrialise it still remains to . be fohrid.

Suchasit is, however, it has now elicited a repyfromthe Melbourne Chamber - f ComnrercP) which, 'while agreeing to a confelte^^.^ JchBracleristically suggests Melbourne; or Sydney — especially Mel bbWtfe^-'%| the fittiest place for holding it. , It^ohly remainsfor the other Aus nVrihpVfl of Commerce to nomi rTtj*^- — oi oities xtiey jibe 'most eligible sites for ' tbe' suggested conference, and we may ?£.' liretb see ris many conferences sitting as none at all.

' on bis Customs receipts as a merely sub sidiary resource. Were the other co'o pies suddenly to follow , suit, free- trade, .in the eyes of patriotic New South Welshmen, would lose half the charms with which it became invested as a weapon wherewith to humble tbe Arrogant folk beyond the Murray. Therefore even the partial extension of the principle, the mereproposal to take down the inner fences .that subdivide the Australian \- paddock, \is looked coldly ttpoh, and even maligned as an attempt to 'bring in protection by a side-wind.' Upon this theory, it should, be of the essence of free-trade to have &s; toany barriers as possible. If theire be anything 60 intrin cically good in maintaining them between States possessing similar institutions, peopled with men of kindred race, and forming a little world of their own, with just sufficient variety of resources to en courage an active trade between them selves, why not be consistent and drive the argument to its legitimate issue. By all means let us have the continental octroi system in towns, and cease to 'protect' the butcher, the milkman, the, market gardener, by admitting their wares— which already enjoy the unfair advantage of being fresh -into our town's untaxed, while heavy burdens aire laid- on Westphalia hams and Hambnrg beef, New York condensed milk and Borwick's Baking Powder, which has the reputation of casting the performances of colonial hens wholly into the shade. Why should we stick at the arbitrary \- lines that politicians have drawn, when so great a principle is at stake ? Is it not monstrous that Stanthorpe should have, to pay duty on New England to baeco, and yet Brisbane be allowed to clothe herself — next year, perhaps — in Ipswich tweeds, and munch without fee the almonds and raisins that Toowoomba might, but doesn't, produce ? We have a Custom House at. each port, nay, we have Custom Houses where there is no port worth speaking of. Why not utilise these ^interesting establishments a little more, and evince our horror of all pro tectionist tendencies by taxing the coast trade?. Bockhampton srows.no sugar, And but Uttle. jnaiz& It is clearly , in tolerable that the Mackay and Bundaberg growers should 'enjoy advantages in the market thus provided at their doors of which their brethren of Demerara and Merrimbula are not allowed to avail themselves. If the cry of ' protection ' is alight more than a scare-crow, set up by parties interested in the maintenance . of a worin-ea'ten fiscal system, to warn others not so interested off the Tom Tiddler' s eround they claim for their own domain, they are bound to show wherein the political morality of tweedle-dum differs from that of tweedle-dee. If, on the other hand, it is but a scare-crow, let it be treated as such— with derision.
