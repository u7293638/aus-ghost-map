Why Shakespeare is Supreme. It is the versatile working of Shake speares intellect that renders his sup remacy unassailable. His mind, as Haz litt suggested, contained within itself the germs of every faculty and feeling. lie knew intuitively-how every faculty and feeling would develop in every conceivable change of fortune. Men and. women — good or bad, old or young, wise or foolish, merry or sad, rich or poor—yielded their secrets to him, and his genius illumined in turn every aspect of humanity that pre sents itself on the highway of iife. Each of his characters gives voice to thought or passion with an individuality and a naturalness that rouse in the intelligent playgoer and reader the illusion that they arc overhearing men and women speak unpremeditatingly among themselves, rather than that they aro reading speeches or hearing written speeches recited. r lho more closely tho words are studied, the completer the illusion grow*s. Creatures oi the imagination—fairies, ghosts, wit ches—are delineated with a like potency, <-i)d the reader or spectator feels instinc tively that those supernatural entities cculd not speak, feel, or act oilier wise than Shakespeare represents them. "So mighty a facility sets at naught the com mon limitations of nationality, and in every quarter of the globe to which civi - lised life has - penetrated Shakespeare's power is recognised. All the world over language is applied to his creations that ordinarily applies to beings of flesh and blood. Hafrlet and Othello: Lear and Macbeth, Falstaff, Brutus, Borneo, and Sbylock are studied in almost every civi lised tongue* as if they were historic per sonalities, and the chief of the impressive phrases that fall from their lips are rooted in the sjieoch of civilised humanity.—Syd ney Lee (The Dictionary of National Bio graphy). ____
