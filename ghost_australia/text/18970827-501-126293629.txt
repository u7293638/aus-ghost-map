A Gliost in Sydney. The following report, published in Sydney on Friday afternoon, lias awakened a good deal of interest and aroused special curiosity in the neighbourhood of Strawberry Hills : â€” There is an untenanted house in the corner of Daw son and Clisdell streets, formerly ocoupied as an hotel. Constable Harlaud was in the act of pointing out the premises to his mate, whom he was showing round the heat, when they descried something black sitting on the doorstep. The officers approached, and Har land stietched out his hand to grasp the bundle when it rose up and before the eyes of the policemen vanished through the thick door. For about a quarter of an hour the police kept up the chase inside the house, but only with poor success. As they reached the bottom of the stairs they turned to take a last look round when they beheld it following in their wake. This was too much for the offi cers, and they made all speed out of the house into tho street. Arrangements' have been made to take up the hunt- on a more extensive soaio. ? The officers describe the apparition as being of a most extraordinary appearance. It hucl a pair of flappers like a saal, and the upper part, towards where the , head ought to be was covered with what looked like bags.
