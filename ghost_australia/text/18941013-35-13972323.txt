MUSICAL AND DRAMATIC NOTES. The cablegram despatched from London on 8th October, and published last Tuesday, exactly confirms the letter from Miss Ada Crossley, made public a month previously in our " Musical and Dramatic Notes " Miss Crossley's letter was written especially for this column at the request of " a Sydney playgoer now in London," so that it was not likely that the contralto would alter a determination made with such careful thought as to ultimate consequences Indeed, the last words in this letter describing her interview with Mme Melba on 28th July six weeks' later than the meeting of 17th June, which at the time led to nothing, and is now ancient history wore contained in a postscript "II now you will be glad to hear I have decided on Pans," which head the matter beyond a doubt On the whole, there is every reason to think that Miss Crossley will profit by the change That, in the opinion of Mr Charles Santley, she needed no further tuition in oratorio and ballad music is proved by his expressed readiness to launch her in London during the present winter season But nearly all the great English singers or the day, Mr Santley himself, Signer Foil Melba, Album and the rest, have not remained content with a knowledge of the English school, but have also studied abroad Miss Crossley's residence in Paris will surround her with a new musical at mosphere She will learn something beyond simple English ballads, something quite different from the stately music of the great oratorio masters, she will meet many famous operatic artist, and she will learn to speak and sing in French that language which is as much the accepted medium of intercourse amongst artists of all nations as it is amongs diplomatists of all nations As regards Mme Marchesi, it is sufficient to know that this lady is world famous amongst the great teachers who devote themselves to assisting those who already know how to Bing In her interview of 28th July, Mme Melba assured Miss Crossley of every assistance in her power, adding, "I have your interests at heart " That this was no empty promise is shown by the cabled intimation that Miss Crossley's debut next May will not be through Mr Santley's influence, but under the direction if Mme Melba's agent, Mr Daniel Mayer Mr Mayor is the gentleman who was chosen to receive the guests at the opening of the Salle Erard last July He stands high in Paris and in London, and forms a connecting link between artists of the operatic stage and the concert platform Upon Mr George Rignold falls almost exclusively the burthen-for though an honourable one it is none the 'less heavy-of Shakespearian revivals on a grand scale " Julius Caesar," which will be played to-night, stands in the annals of the English-speaking stage as one of the three great plays in which this actor takes precedence of all others Mr Rignold is the only " Henry V " the present generation of playgoers has seen, his name is identified in England with the part of Caliban in " The Tempest," and his productions of "Julius Caesar" in Australia represent so far as printed record informs us, the only attention which the "acting" world now bestows on the tragedy But, as the actor manager points out in his preface, "Julius Caesar " has also been strangely neglected in the past The drama was one of the 15 stock plays performed on the opening of Drury Lane Theatre in 1663, when Hart was Brutus Then in 1707 Betterton made a great name as Brutus, with John Wilks as Antony and the lovely Mrs Bracegirdle as Portia Two years later Barton Booth was Brutus, and in 1722 James Quinn appeared in the part Sprauger Barry seems to have been the only actor of note who played Antony, as John Phillip Kemble, Mnoready, Charles Mayne Young, and Samuel Phelps all played Brutus on the rare occasions when "Julius Caesar" was staged Mr Rignold thus stands alone as the only famous actor of this century who has chosen Mare Antony for himself in point of fact, the two great characters of " Julius Cor " are of equal importance To- night, as on the former occasion, that sterling actor Mr T F Cathcart will appear as Brutus His presence will preserve the balance of assemble indicated by Shakespeare in the plan and scope of the work, and will reaBsuroplajgoerB as to Mr Rignold's determination to repeat the artistic success of 24th August, 1889 There will be some changes to the east, as Miss Roland Watts-Phillips, who sang and acted so well as Lucius, is unfortunately indisposed, and Mr H R Jowett, who made his first great success as Cassius, is in America But with these exceptions, there are no alterations of vital interest, whilst the staging will again de- pict with impressive splendour the glowing story of Rome in ancient days Indirectly, the revival will celebrate the anniversary of Mr Rignold's birthday English actors are just waking to the immensity of the theatrical field which awaits them in America The Eta reminds its London readers that Boston is not, as they might suppose, a country town of the size of Oxford, but a splendid city Continuing further its task of cherries ary education, the J in points out that Chicago and New York are important centres, and that Philadelphia can boast 22 first-class theatres That is how it is that actors like Mr Willard, who leave London for a six weeks' season in New York, are, as it were, swallowed up, and stay away three and four years Mr Charles Cartwright is the latest recruit to the American stage, as he goes to New York in the spring and Mr Charles Warner will shortly pay his first visit, to produce at Daly's Theatre his now play, " A House of Loos " Instead of opening under Mr Daly's management in " Romeo and Juliet in which tragedy she would immediately challenge comparison with June Marlowe and other first-rate actresses, whose talent is still an unknown quantity in England Miss Olga Nethersole will, on 20th October, make her American debut in an adapta- tion of Merimeo s " Carmen," written specially for her by H H Hamilton Mr J C Williamson is now in the States, having left England on 18th August, but his stay there will not be long, as he sails for Australia on 28th September Mr W b Gilbert, who early in the year wrote to a London daily anathematising " The Country Girl," is now dilating upon the question of " good and bad rhymes " Mr Gilbert calls attention to " that preposterous doggrel the National Anthem," and declares that such pitiable driver on a grand and impressive theme is scandalous Commenting on this, a writer draws attention to one of the most curious rhymes in the language, where Sir Joseph Porter sings Wherever I may go Bang bang the loud ten Governors go This surely is a case in which, as Mr Gilbert remarks in his letter, " the work would have been better had the writer complied with accepted rules " The death is announced of Mr George Barrett, in London, at the age of 45 The deceased come dian, who started in life as a painter, was a brother of Mr Wilson Barrett, and during that actor's lesseeship of the Princess's Theatre he created the parts of the old showman in " Lights of' London," Boss Knives in " The Romany Rye," Jackes in "The Silver King," and first grave digger in " Hamlet " in the provinces he was also known as the battle in " Les Cloches de CorNeville," as Brisket in " Pink Dominoes," and in other low comedy parts and he twice visited America Mr Bland Holt opened his Brisbane season last Saturday by the production there of " A Million of Money " Miss Hilda Spong, who made her debut in the northern capital as Stella St Clair, made a deep impression on the audience and the critics considered that she fully sustained the fame achieved in the south Dvorak's "Spector g Bride " will be performed, by the Philharmonic Society some time next month, and Signor Hazon is now busy rehearsing his forces The orchestration is especially difficult Dvorak's fascinating setting of the thrilling ghost story was first performed under M Kowalski's direction at the University (Fo'nuary, last)), when the soloists were Mme Frances Saville, Signor Dimitreseo, and Mr Sydney Deane Signor Sonzagno opened his new International Opera House at Milan last month with Samara"s new opera, "Martine," and then on successive days staged "L'Amico Fritz," the new opera " I Medici " (Leoncavallo), " Pagliacci," and "Piccolo" (Haydn), and IVancbetti's "W d'Alpo "-a building week's work. The New York World, after interviewing Sir Augustus Harris, declared that Soerarris had " self-made man " written on his head, and also on the soles of his shoes, and S M M was worked in the corner of his handkerchief " He is jolly and has written plays, and has made the modern theatre Without him there would be no more opera, music would become a lost art, and there would be no theatre worth speaking of He is truly a great man " Negotiations are on foot to bring Mr Charles Hawtrey to Australia This light comedian, who is at present playing Mr Wyndham's part at the Criterion, would in such event appear in Sydney early next year, and would then go on to San Francisco Australian playgoers will be glad to hear that Mr Walter Howe has been engaged by Messrs Lewis and Reynolds to play Sir Charles Hard- ing in their provincial tour in England of "The Idler " The London Figaro o regrets to say that Miss Myra Kemble, who only recently returned from Australia, is lying seriously ill in Guy's Hospital
