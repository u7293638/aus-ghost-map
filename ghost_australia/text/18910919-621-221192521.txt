A " Maiden Meditation.' NOT " FANCY FREE." Are you really what ideally I adore, That you hold me and enfold me Evermore ? I don't think so ; vet I wiuk so At your faults, That I merely notice clearly What exalts. If each virtue should desert yen, You would find Me as tender a defender, And as kind. Why I love you and approve vou So, I fear I can boast of not the ghost of An idea. You know nothing of the loathing Deep and true. That I measure to each pleasure Without you, White is mirthless, and as worthless Me to please As ash-flavoured, Sodom savourec Apple trees. In a small room, or a ball-room — When I'm drest In my new gauze and my gew-£ wi Like the rest — For you sighing, I am cryicg. " Y&nitas; Yamtatum !— howl hate 'era All, alas !" Dare I bravely tell you gravely That you bring To my sadness all the gladness Of the Spring — That as cheering to my hearirsg Are your words, As the mighty, sweet J'tnile Of the birds? Shall I mention the intention On my part, J ust to learn 'em (in eteruum) All by heart ? Shall I show you that I knew yo Well may use That speech spicy — " Yeni, vici" — if you choose ? (For you straightway through the gateway Of my soul Once did enter to be centre Of the whole.) How you grieve me, when you leave me, Dare I say ? No, for certain. Drop tee curtain On the play.
