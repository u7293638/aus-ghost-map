The agents-general of Australia made it their business, immediately after the Salisbury Government was installed in office, to wait upon the new Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to invite his co-operation with their efforts to prevent the sending of French criminals to the Western Pacific. The recidivistes have been overlooked for a time owing to " wars and rumours of wars," but we are reminded by this action that they still constitute a living issue, and also that a critical stage has been reached in the history of the movement. The first convict steamers will soon be loaded, and we are entitled to ask with more than the fervour of the poet : " Where lies " the land to which you ship would go 1" Happily, our interests have not been neglected at home, and happily, also, in this matter English public opinion is thoroughly with us. Even Lord DERBY was sound. If the recidivistes are sent out to scatter themselves about the isles, we may rely upon Great Britain sanctioning any laws we may pass to exclude from Australasia the men and women whom France rejects as too bad for her. But, as prevention in international difficulties is far better than cure, we have a right to claim the assistance of England in our attempts to induce France to forego her ill onioned ox periment Colonel STANLEY'S acqui escence seems to have been readily given, and the Australian belief in the influence of the Empire is so sincere as to engender the conviction that judicious action in Paris the steady representa- tion of the Australian case and the firm endorsement of the principle that Australia must be left to her legal but unpleasant comedies will check the evil in its commencement Our Australian agitation did a great deal of good So far as it has been successful, it is because it is sincere And it has operated not only directly but indirectly, inasmuch as it has induced Frenchmen to consider for themselves some of the provisions of the extraordinary measure that was put before them The original proposal was to expel from France the whole of her criminal population Provision for a residence abroad was to be made in favour of all culprits convicted more than twice of any imaginable came from begging in the streets to house breaking and murderous outrage in the higher grades being considered equivalent to two committals in the lower Transportation was to be the one way of dealing with criminals the real mode of reformation in the home country being abandoned in despair 'The judges were to have no option in the matter, but were required to send all culprits out No guards were to be supplied, and no persons were to be built, but the men and women on their arrival in the new lands were to be free, provided only that they did not return to France, 'that heroic pected, it is true, to reside for six months of the year in the island to which they might be sent, but the idea that with no one to control them and no one to bring them back, they would respect these wishes was comical 'loa great extent, these provisions have dis- appeared in the debates full justice was done by various speakers to the Australian argument that men and women cannot be turned out to starve in a desert, and that if the Government did not mean to undertake the custody or support of its criminals abroad it must intend that they should disperse amongst the neighbouring civilised communities As a consequence, the list of offenders liable to transportation has been so reduced that not more than 12,000 men and women will be available in the first instance, though, of course, there will be a steady annual draft afterwards And this consideration shows that the snake is scotched, not killed If any considerable proportion of the habitual criminals who are still liable to transportation from France were sent to New Caledonia, the island would soon be over-populated 'The expirees entitled at the end of their sentences to go where they pleased would yearly become an increasing quantity If the parents remained in the penal island, we should be troubled with children against whom the influences of an evil hereditary taint would be strongly cost The idea of marrying make scoundrels to female reprobates, and of leaving the future to Providence, may be highly interesting from a psychological standpoint But in Australia we object to BILL SYKES or Miss NANCY and to their offspring, and this whether the man and woman " Saxon or Dane or Norman be " We welcome and we repel irrespective of nationality It is open to France to refrain from sending another criminal to New Caledonia, and to allow the now act to remain inoperative so far as the Western Pacific is concerned The colony is not expressly named in the measure, and consequently I range can recognise Australian rights without wounding her own susceptibilities 'the hope is here that the choice of the penal colonies was left to the discretion of the Administration of the day, with a view of giving way to the Australian objections if they were continuously expressed, and no doubt the agents general sought their interview with Colonel STANLEY in order to obtain his support in an application or suggestion to the Republic that the Penal department should be in structed to ignore New Caledonia in the now arrangements The colonies are under great obligations to the agents general for their devotion to the cause We presume that their Ministers are appreciative and encourage them in their well doing, but it is also right that from time to time their services should be recognised in the press and in Parliament, so that they may know that they have not only their Governments behind them, but popular sympathy also Australia made its formal protest against the readiness scheme by the resolutions passed at the Sydney convention We gave due official notice to all concerned of our intention to protect our shores as the occasion may demand It would be unwise to do more than is absolutely necessary, and Mr SERVICE'S consequently not to be found fault with for suggesting to the Queensland Premier that the consideration of the bill he has framed and circulated to prevent the landing of foreign criminals should be deferred for the pre- sent The measure is drastic in character It would assuredly effect its immediate purpose of keeping expirees and ticket-of leave men from landing in Australia, but it would also raise some very difficult questions of international relations, and on the whole it seems better at the present moment to leave the agents general to work upon France through the Imperial Government with a view of keeping the taint away from the Western Pacific We have to watch and wait, cordially encouraging our representatives in the old world, and with a resolution to put the brake on Australian intercourse with the penal islands just as the severity of the pace of French convictism may demand a The hope is that the pressure the agents general are now exer ting at Paris will be sufficient to avert the evil There are, probably, few among the world's great industries which have, in so short a time, assumed such enormous proportions as has the wool growing in dustry of Australasia It is not a century ago since the first sheep ever seen in Australia twenty nine long logged, Roman nosed, arched backed, hairy am mais-were imported from Bengal, and it was not until nine years afterwards, just at the close of the last century, that pure merino sheep were introduced A considerable number of years then elapsed before wool figured among the exports of the colony, and in 1845 the quantity sent away was only equal to about 100 bales In those days, and, indeed for very many years afterwards, the industry had innumerable difficulties to contend with In the earliest stage progress was retarded by the hostility of the natives, and pioneers had to push out into an unknown and untried interior, where the thoughts of one period and the floods of another too often decimated their flocks and destroyed the accumula- tions of years Nor were those who surmounted the difficulties arising from the uncertainties of the seasons by any means free from anxieties 1 or they had to contend with obstacles in the shape of scarcity of labour and costly land carriage, while their wool, after a long and expensive voyage had to be consigned to the other end of the world, to be there sold in competition with a woolgrowing industry established for centuries and naturally protested by its proximity to a market So favourable, however, are the climate and soil of Australia to the growth of wool, and BO encouraging, upon the whole, have been the financial results of pastor an enterprise, that the development of the grazing resources of our interior has never been arrested for any length of time and the history of our wool trade is the record of a rapid and continuous progress The 100 bales of 1815 were followed by an export of 1250 bales in 1825, and in 1835-50 years ago the quantity imported into England had risen to 20,000 bales, from which it increased to over 70,000 bales in 1815 Pursuing the same on ward course, and on an average more than doubling itself every decide, 160,000 ULnai. reached in 1855, and 330 000 bales in 1865 And yet again the quantity was doubled, for, in 1875, the imports amounted to 700,000 bales Since then no less than 400,000 bales have been added, the imports of Australasian wool into Europe amounting in 188 J- to the enormous total of 1,100,000 bales Perhaps no better evidence of the intense vitality of the Australasian wool industry could be given than the simple statement, that notwithstanding the immense losses of sheep which occurred prior to the shearing of 1884-, the shipments for the wool year which has just closed, so far from showing the large and serious decrease which was naturally anticipated are actually 16,000 bales greater than those of the previous year. A full explanation of this unexpected result was given in our review of the wool trade ten days ago, when the subject was discussed in detail , but we may here remark that a distinction must some times be made between the wool production and wool shipments of a given j year the whole of the -v. cry abundant clip shorn in Abby, for instance, was not shipped in the year ending the following June, some 35,000 bales having been detained in the interior, in consequence of the drought, and shipped during the year which has just closed While the 1883 shipments were, there fore, 35,000 bales less than the production, those of 1884 were 35,000 bales greater than the production So that had each year's shipments been identical, a decreased production of 70,000 bales in 1864 would have been shown But as the shipments of 1884 show an increase of 16 000 biles, the decreased production is brought down to 54,000 bales Had, however, the same rate of progress been maintained in 1884 as in 1883, the production would have shown an increase of 104,000 bales That it does not do so, but, on the contrary, decreased by 5000 bales, shows that the clip is 158 000 bales less than might have been anticipated had the previous rate of progress been maintained Calculated at the ordinary computation of 80 fleeces to the bale, these 158 000 bales of wool represent the clip of almost exactly 12,500,000 sheep, the number estimated to have been lost in consequence of the drought these figures must also be regarded from another aspect Notwithstanding the absence of the usual increase from Australia, the ] of open wool markets have recently experienced a very severe fall, the present rates ruling in London being nearly 3d a pound lower than those of twelve months ago. The cause of these lower prices is undoubtedly to be found in the fact of the largely increased production of wool in Australasia and South America having borne down a market devoid of elasticity Kcaliswg how serious, and in some cases ruinous, the fall has already been it is difficult to imagine what would have been the condition of the wool market had the drought not intervened, and if, instead of only IGJOOO bales, there had been an increase of 101,000 bales from Aust tralasia At even their present low] level, prices have only been sustained by the withdrawal of 70,000 blessed unprecedented quantity-and, in the face of the dulness of trade, the future of the market cannot fail to be regarded with a certain amount of uneasiness, the absence, therefore, of a further increase of 158 000 bales, disastrous as it has undoubtedly been to those whose sheep have died-and, indeed, to the colonies generally must be regarded a by no means an unmixed evil to the woolgrowers who escaped from sends losses It appears, then, that a drought such unexampled severity, that springs which have never before been know to fail, have been dried up, and which has caused stations to be deserted for lack of water to drink a drought so severe and disastrous that it is sensed to have killed 12,500,000 sheep-like loss of which cannot be valued at inch less than £5,000,000, has only succeeded in doing little more than an best by a short time the normal increase in the production of wool. In the face of acts like these, it is impossible for by to avoid being struck with a strong sense of the impotence of all known forces to permanently arrest a progress of our great industry A4 reading indeed the history of the last two years in the light thrown upon the subject by the previous 50 years of pastoral progress, we can only conclude that notwithstanding temporary checks from droughts and falling press, the onward march of pastoral development will cover an ever extending field, and that our wool clip will Kim increase by " leaps and bounds 'Until the industrial destiny of Australia is fulfilled, and almost all her now occupied territory is invaded by the Rising influence of sheep farming / The silence of/r BENI is sometimes as astonishing to as much to be do flood as uponothor occasions is his loquacity.

In the meantime he proposed, with the concurrence of the other colonies, to withdraw the oppo Bilton to the 31st clause as originally introduced. As during the first session the Federal Council would probably be occupied in passing measures on which all the colonies were already agreed, and amendments in the constitution could be easily made, he urged Sir Alexander Stuart to permit of the colonies joining in making a start without being too critical To Mr Services telegram inviting the concurrence of the other colonies in the proposal to withdraw opposition to the 31st clause' favourable replies were received on Saturday from South Australia and Tasmania. No answer has been received from the Premier of Queensland, and the necessary instructions to the agent-general will not be for warded until to day The board appointed to inquire into John Carnegie's application for a selection of land on Fish Creek, and the action of Mr Richardson, MLA., with regard to it, met again on Saturday and finished the taking of evidence Mr Richardson was recalled by the chairman, and stated that he finally Carnegie's original application on the 6th inst, the day before he made his statement about the case in Parliament Mr Cuthbert contended that there was no discrepancy between Mr Richardson s evidence on Thursday as to the destruction of the original document, and the statement of our Creswick correspondent that Mr Richardson allowed him the document on the 3rd that, Mr V Nicoll, who, accordingtoCarnegiesapplica tion, had pegged out land for him, was called, and stated that he had never done so Mr Cuthbert argued that Nicoll had written letters which showed that he had pegged for Carnegie, and Mr Richardson deposed that Carnegie had given him verbal information to the same effect, he being corroborated to a certain extent in that statement by Mr Baker, M L A. Nicoll, however, though subjected to a lengthy examination by Mr Cuthbert and the board, persisted in denying that he had ever pegged for Carnegie Mr Cuthbert addressed the board, pointing out that the evidence showed that the Lands department treated applications for land with great indifference, and that a very lax system of receiving most irregular declarations had grown up during the last few years he also stated that no motive for improper conduct had been proved against Mr Richardson, who could have selected land himself had he wanted any m Gipps Land, and who had four daughters old enough to take up land, besides the two sons who had selected The board will meet on an early day to prepare their report, In his summing up of the Richardson Carnegie evidence on Saturday, Mr Cuthbert, the solicitor retained for the defence, referred to. The Argus as having commented upon the case while it was absentee Mr Cuthbert is mistaken No comments whatever appeared in this paper Without comment we printed the statement of Mr Richardson to the board that he had destroyed the original document, and the statement of our Creswick corre spondent to which he adhered-that Mr Richardson showed him the original document An investigation was thus secured The board duly ex mined Mr Richardson on the point, when he gave the explanation that he destroyed the document within the last few days, after showing it to our representa- two after the rumour originated " The chairman said there was a doubt in his own mind, and if Mr Richardson had mentioned the time of the destruction in the first instance the misapprehension would not have occurred Mr Cuthbert said that the destruction of the original was to be regretted, a view in which everybody will acquiesce During the sitting on Saturday of the board of inquiry as to Mr Richardson's action in connexion with John Carnegie's application for a selection at Fish Creek, some curious evidence was given as to the selection by Mr Baker, M.L.A., of land in that locality Mr Baker, in his declaration, which was dated 10th July, 1884, swore that the land was pegged out by his agent, W Nicoll, but Mr Nicoll on Saturday denied not only that he had ever pegged out for Mr Baker, but that he had ever told Mr Baker he had done so In the evidence given before the Fish Creek Land Board, one Harkins, Nicol's guide, stated that Nicoll was present when he (Uurkins) pegged out the land, and Nicoll deniedthatatatementalso on Saturday In a sketch drawn by Nicoll in July, 1881, John Carnegie's name was written on one block. On Saturday Nicoll swore that he had never pegged out any land for Carnegie 'He block marked as Carnegie a on the sketch is the one allotted to Mr Baker by the board Mr Baker and Mr Nicoll arc relatives About a fortnight ago the Chief Secretary addressed to the Tender Board a letter ask me for an explanation of certain matters connected with the present system of calling for tenders for the supplies required by various Government departments Mr Her), when recently investigating the circumstances under which rugs required at the lunatic asylums were obtained from the contractors, instead of from Pentridge, found that in the contract for drapery, Le, for the current year prices greatly in excess of the value of the samples were proposed to be charged for rugs 'Ino rugs and other articles mentioned in the tender were supposed to be obtained from Pentridge as far as possible, and marks opposite these- items in the schedule indicated this to the ten derers, who were, however, required to affix prices to each of the lines. The Chief Secretary called upon Dr Dick, the superintendent of the lunatic asylums, to explain why the rugs were not obtained from Pentridge, as the rules of the public service directed they should be, and asked the 'Tender Board for information such as would enable him to form a correct judgment as to the present system of tendering the Tender Board met on Tuesday last, and considered the letter received from the Chief Secretary They replied at once, but owing to the correspondence having to pass through the office of the Treasurer, Mr Berry has not yet received the letter of the board 'We understand, however, that the board have explained that little or no importance was attached to the lines, which were usually obtained from Pentridge, or the " no estimate " items, as very few of the articles mentioned had to be purchased from the contractors They have come to the conclusion that, order to avoid confusion in the future, it will be well to omit from the tender schedules all articles which are usually obtained from Pentridge, or for which no estimate can be given If the articles should be required, the departments may obtain authority to purchase them in the open market Mr Berry has received a reply from Dr Dick, and when he has the letter of the Tender Board before him will consider the whole case the Central Board of Health has received further application from local bodies in differentiates of the colony for large numbers of copies of the circular which was recently issued by the board on the subject of hydatid disease and the precautions to be taken to prevent its spreading Arrangements are now in progress between the president of the Central Board and the authorities at Punt ridge Stockade for the printing at the prison of a supply of circular.) sufficiently large to meet the requirements of the local bodies which have applied for them.

The revolver lay about a foot from the body Two theories were put forward to account for the accident, assuming it to have been such Dr Wilson thought that the deceased had stumbled against the revolver, which was hanging on a nail in the wall immediately on the right of the entrance, turned it round, and caused it to go off by bringing the trigger into contact with the halL Dr Elmes, on the contrary, after the post mortem examination, adopted the theory that the deceased had knocked the revolver off the nail in falling against the wall, and then, while in a kneel- ing posture, attempted to replace it, catching j the trigger against the nail, and thus discharging the pistol, which was held by the barrel muzzle downwards On reconsideration Dr Wilson coincided in this theory, and apparently the jury adopted the same view, for they brought in a verdict that the deceased had died from the effects of a pistol shot indicted accidentally by himself The remains of the deceased gentleman were brought to Melbourne by train on Saturday evening, and the funeral took place yesterday, and was attended by a large number of gentlemen A very., painful accident occurred at the timber yard of Mr A U Utber, Burwood road Hawthorn on Saturday morning, shortly after 8 o'clock, two joiners went down from the carpenter shop to get their tools ground, and Alfred Robert Utber, a son of the proprietor went to the engine to be a loose belt on the grindstone. The shaft. carried three belts, one on the driving wheel, another connecting the governor wheel, and the loose one referred to One end of this belt was thrown over a steam pipe above his head, and while standing close to the governor belt and reachmgtotakeitdown, he was caught by his coat and whirled round the shaft with great rapidity, his legs striking against the steam pipe were both broken The engineer, James Campbell, who was at the time sharpening news, on mediately stopped the engine, and when Mr Utber dropped to the ground it was found that his right arm had been nearly wrenched from the socket, his legs broken, his feet battered about, and his clothes torn off his body He was immediately attended to by Dr Embling son and jun , who found it necessary at once to amputate the right arm and leg He succumbed to his injuries at about noon on Sunday Mr Utber was a young man, aged 21 years, with a wife and one child. The Salisbury Ministry has lost no time in bringing forward an Irish land purchase bill The principle of the measure is that the Government is to advance the money to enable the tenants to purchase their holdings, the amount to be repayable in 49 years, and the interest charged to be 4 per cent Mr Gladstone shortly before his defeat, announced in the House of Commons that the Government would not be able to deal with the question this session Among the various schemes which have been lately proposed for settling the Irish land difficulty is one by Mr S. J Lynch, the registrar of the Landed Estates Court which is thus referred to in a recent English paper - ' How to open the Irish land market is a problem of great perplexity, and it need hardly be said of great importance The market is at present practically closed so far as sales of the owners interest is concerned, and the intention of the Legislature as to the erection of a peasant proprietary in as far from being realised as ever Buyers of every class naturally hold their hands until they know what, if anything, is to be done by the Government to set free the properties which are at present ice-bound under the chilling influences which surround them 'The Land Court is open, as if in mockery, to expose the failure of the Land Act in this respect the effect of this stagnation in not only depressing to all the parties directly concerned in the various interests of property, but injurious to the prospects of the country There can be little doubt that it the money which is now bound up in the states which have charges upon them were liberated, and owners who have not the means of improving their lands were enabled to sell them on fair and equitable terms, it would find many useful and produc- Uve works, and an impetus would be given to agricultural and industrial enterprise. Various solutions of the problem have been proposed, and the most recent and well considered is that of Mr Stanislaus J Lynch, registrar of the Landed Estates Courts, whose keen intelligence, legal knowledge, and official experience enable him to speak with more authority than a mere theorist 'The essence of his scheme, which has been favourably received by persons in high position competent to form an impartial and sound view, is to extend the period of repayment of advances from 30 years to 47 years, to reduce the annuity from 6 per cent to 1 per cent, to substitute the security of the vendor for the county guarantee, and in the case of such security being given to enable the advance of the whole of the purchase money instead of three fourths, and to make other provisions If the Chancellor of the Lfchcquer required to retain a fourth of the purchase money Mr Lynch would not object he also proposes to repeal the clause of the Land Act which enables the Land Commis- sioners to purchase estates for the purposes of re sale, thus obviating the difficulty of the price of land being regulated by the Government standard instead of by the ordinary laws of supply and demand, and relieving the state from the risk and expense of dealing with land through one of its departments, to give vitality to the second part of the Tramways Act, which enables public companies to intervene for the purchase of estates where such intervention maybe neces sary or expedient in order to facilitate the creation of occupying owners to provide that the advances made by the state to such com- names may be secured by debentures issued under the Debenture Act of 1901 upon the estates so purchased, and for the application of the purchase money upon the re- sale of such estates, or any part of them, to the redemption of such debentures, and to enable the treasury to re issue these debentures with Government guarantee during their currency to transfer to the fund judges the jurisdiction now vested in the land commis monera in relation to advances to tenants and public companies, and by the application of the ss stern of record of title, now under the control of the land judges, to all cases of sales to tenants and public com- games, to provide a cheap and simple mode of coins c arising land Various other details are set forth Referring to a report that Sir Peter Lumsden, while in Constantinople, expressed the opinion that in threatening the Indian from tier Russia wished to divert 1 England's atten- tion from a more important direction, viz., the Sultans possessions, the Vienna correspondent of the London Daily [telegraph writes -' Reference to my despatch of the 15th May will show that views identical with those of Sir Peter Lumsden were expounded tomeonhighuuthonty Mymformant who has had every opportunity of ascertaining Russia's plans, stated in so many words that what the Russians wanted was Constantinople, not India. My despatch contained further particulars on the same subject, which cleave fresh may rest from the confirmation just given to them by the British frontier commissioner It is not generally known, but I vouch for the fact, that about four years ago Russia endeavoured to secure Austria's assent to a partition of Turkey Die arrangement proposed by Russia was not confined to Turkey alone Servia was to be divided, as also Moldavia '1 the scheme was rejected in Vienna, and, curiously enough, since then both Servia and Roumania have severed the close ties that bound them to Russia and have effected a marked ? rapprochement with Austria But Russia, nothing daunted has tightened her grasp on other portions of the Balkan peninsula within easier reach of Constantinople Recent events in Macedonia and at Philippopolis are still fresh in people's memories, and only recently the news reached Vienna that a large body of Turkish troops had been concentrated on the frontier of Eastern Roumelia The whole of that part of the country is in a state of permanent agitation, kept up by agents of the Russian Government for obvious purposes As I informed you at the time, the passage of British ships through the Dardanelles would have served Russia's allies in the Balkan States as a pretext for marching on Constantinople and occupying certain position within striking distance of the Golden Horn the festival of Cyril and Method has since revealed a state of affairs in those regions which surpasses what was known at some of the best informed Government intelligence departments One of the most significant demonstrations that took place on that occasion has just transpired It consisted in a mass banquet at the monastery situated in the neighbourhood of She no, given by the Bulgarian volunteers who took part in the Turks a Russian campaign, and who now form an association known as the Shipka, 'toasts were drunk amidst the wildest enthusiasm to the prompt union of Bulgaria with Eastern Roumelia and to the emancipation of Macedonia. Most people have little time and less inclination to watch what is going on in South Eastern Europe But the time is rapidly approaching when public attention will once more be forcibly attracted thither, and I have good reason to believe that the powers chiefly concerned are already closely following the daily increasing agitation in those parts " Some interesting statistics have recently been published in New York, in which the growth of the population of the United States during the last quarter of a century as contrasted with the decrease in the consump- tion of spirituous liquors (save the Standard) Twenty five years ago the United States had a population, in round numbers, of 31,000,000, and at that time no less than 80,000 OOOgul of spirituous liquors were consumed Last year the population of the States was estimated at 55,000,000, and the demand for strong drink had fallen to 73,000 OOOgal It ought to be stated, however, that the amount of spirits distilled in America last year fell far below the average, in consequence of over production in 1883 and depression in trade Still, when every allowance is made in this direction, and also for the probable increase of illicit production, the proportion consumed per head of the population is much less than in the A great social change, indeed, appears to be passing over the habits of the American people, and spirituous liquors are not in so great a demand as formerly Doubtless the ' whisky war has had not a little to do in directing public attention to the evils of strong drink, especially in a climate like that of a large portion of the United States, but probably the good sense of the American people themselves has brought about a change of habit on which the entire community may be congratulated At the some time, it may be IIB VV ell to mention, in case the Blue Ribbon Army imagine that they are winning all along the line, and so become rashly vain glorious, that the consumption of malt liquors has gone up from 100 OOO.OOOgal m 1800 to 500 000 000gal in 1884, and that in the same period the production of native wines, which in 1890 was considerably less than 2 OOO.OOOgal, now amounts to over 17,000,OOOgal The effect upon health and happiness of the substitution of the lighter for the heavier drinks does not of course admit of being tabulated, but everyone who looks at the matter dispassionately cannot fail to recognise in so great a social change a matter for sincere congratulation " The Warren Line steamer Missouri, which recently arrived at Liverpool from Boston, was instrumental in saving 20 persons from what would have been a terrible death, says the Daily A tus "The persons in question were the captain and crew of the ship Thetis, and the captain a wife and two children On the steamer a arrival in Liverpool eight of the crew were taken to one of the North Aid hospitals suffering severely from frostbite The remainder of the crew were also suffering more or less from the same cause Six of the survivors were received by the local agent of the Shipwrecked Mariners Society, and told a sad tale of their experience in the ice off the Banks of Newfoundland The Thetis was going from Havre to Mira incline in ballast, and when off the Banks a thick fog set in On the following night, about 11 o'clock, the ship was found to be almost surrounded by three immense icebergs One of these struck the vessel and smashed in her bows She made much water, and the boats were lowered One was smashed, but the long boat was got out safely The captain, his wife and children and the crew of the Thetis left their vessel, and in a few moments afterwards heard a great crash, and surmised, as it was too dark to see, that their ship had been crushed between the three floating monsters Next morning nothing could be seen of her The crew made for clear water, with the hope of falling in with some vessel Nothing was seen for three days, at the end of which time a steamer hove in sight The crew waved a Shirt on an oar, with a view of attracting the attention of those on board. but the steamer proceeded on her course and nothing further was seen for three days more, and the sufferings of those in the boat were of the keenest description They had but a small quantity of water and biscuits when they left their vessel, and had subsisted on a biscuit and a half per day ever since Even this was at last curtailed, and eventually not a drop of fresh water remained Many of the crew had become perfectly help less through frost bite, and some to quench their thirst, had drunk the salt water This only increased their sufferings When they had almost given up hope of ever being rescued a steamer was descried This was on the seventh day after the abandon- ment To the honor of the men this steamer also went away, but they had scarcely time to give way to their disappointment when the Missouri came up The Mis Bouri made for the direction in which the boat was, and a white handkerchief waved at the side told them they were seen The ship wrecked crew had a distress signal up composed of a blanket on an oar Several of the men had to be hauled on board the Missouri, and those who were able at once made a rush for the fresh water They had to be restrained by the doctor and crew of the Mia soon The Thetis was a vessel of 978 tons register, and was owned in St John, NB The men were exactly seven nights and six days in the open boat before they were rescued " A meeting of state school teachers, convened by circular, was held on Saturday morning in the Temperance hall, Russell Street, to take into consideration their post tion under the Public Service Act The meeting appointed a deputation to seek an interview with the Premier and Minister of Education, to advocate the amendment of the fifth clause of the act, so that teachers salaries may be dealt with in the same way as the 27th and 28th clauses treat those of other civil servants.

Ireland as Grip, and Mr J R Greville as Perfidy Pounce, and the chief characters of the other sex were well represented by Miss Emily I Ascher, Miss Solange x ware and Miss Emily Fitzroy, so that the piece did not suffer through lack of strength in the company Some excellent new scenery by Mr A Habbe was used The piece will be repeated during the present week ' Isidore attracted a larger audience on Saturday night at the Bijou Theatre than had ever before assembled to witness it The dress circle particularly was well filled A fm ewell benefit will be given to Miss Gracie Plaisted on Wednesday night when she will appear in parts of "Isidore and La 1 encircle St Georges Hall on Saturday night was as usual filled to overflowing There was no change in the programme that of the previous Saturday night which includes the burlesque La Mascotte having proved sufficiently attractive to warrant its repetition A change of programme is advertised for this evening.
