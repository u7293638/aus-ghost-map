Gi'ije ft/OUi'ie _ ^ PUBLISHED DAILY. SA THUD AT, DECEMBER 2, 1871. The preamble of a bill, 01 Act of Parliament, is usually supposed to elucidate, in concise terms, the reasons for the introduction of the measure, and it is the last portion of a bill dealt with in the legislative just as an author's preface gives the completing touch to a new work If we were to take the preamble of the Additional Members Bill 61, as it is more correctly styled in the passing records of the House, the Electoral Districts Bill -for granted the public ought to be pretty well satisfied, for we find it set forth that, " whereas it is desirable to alter and arrange the representation of the colony so is to grant representatives to districts that are now insufficiently represented, and to provide for the election of such Representatives such and such things are to be done This legal verbiage sounds well enough, and looks well upon paper, but it is require site to study something more than the preamble to lime at correct idea as to what the intent and purpose of a measure may really be just as the "argument of a poem may not always be home out by the text, so is the meaning of an Act of Parliament not now enable discover able from its preamble The ade state and just representation of districts ' now insufficiently represented is just the very point for which the public have been contending, and no c indi Ule for a i populous constituency would have the slightest chance of election unless he could prove himself sound upon this question Any measure, therefore, having for its ostensible object the increase of the epic ' sentation, will not aim it of him ned of immature consideration, and Mr Palmer is to be commended for the small quantum of grace accorded m postponing the second leading of his bill until next week It would not, however, have been any great stretch of condescension if he had granted further time for directing the details of the proposed measure Telegraphic communication has enabled the people of Townsville to form some conclusions on the matter, and other To dates affected may, by the same agency become acquainted with Ministerial intentions but there are other districts which are deeply concerned, which have not the advantage of ascertaining, by means of the magic wire, what 1 md of treatment is in store for them We know it is the peculiar affectation of some legislator to ridicule what they are pleased to call outside clamor," but, let the privileges of Palia ment be what they may, the public have at least a light to the eli nice of pronouncing an opinion upon measures which specially concern the whole common wealth, and no empty v younger the put ofbhtant 01 publish members will ever deter them from exercising" that right On no subject could the privilege office expression be more legitimate demanded than on the question of the representation of the people, and history is prolific of instances which demonstrate the unwisdom of heedlessly disregarding popular sent ments upon important public questions The position of a Ministry which is guided in its operations by " caucus meetings of its supporters is certainly calculated to evoke sympathy, even from its sternest opponents On grave public questions such as the ieauan0emeiit of the representation, for instance- political necessity often over ruleS conviction It becomes not so much a matter of importance as to how public interests are to be conserved and studied, in comparison with the more potent demands of self interest No one ever yet knew 01 lead of a ' Mm ister of the Crown' who did not do 1 and the notion of

Hold fast is the motto of very enemies but when the principle comes to be applied to matters which materially affect the public welfare, and upon which the public have very decided opinions of their own, it becomes a folly to push it to the c\ there By the abolition of the two thirds clause of the Constitution Act, Mr Pai/uih and his party have the power to effect radical changes in the

eleven new electorates which Mr 1 vi mi it j poses. to create by Mr and sure more than half may be looked upon as designed to give greater predominance to a class already too powerful either for the public interest or welfare The census returns show that the East Moreton electorate is by far the most thickly peopled in the colony, comprising as it does nearly one sixth of the whole population, but it is only proposed to slice it in ungainly fashion so as to give it four members instead of two, an arrangement which, founded upon whatever basis, is decidedly unjust when compared with other electorates Rockhampton and, although it is proposed to form a subtil bin constituency outside of it under the name of Bl tariff, is undoubtedly deserving of greater consideration than it receives. In ghost, of an adult population, in far exceed!, Ipswich, which returns three members, and nearly equals Drayton and Toowoomba united, although the former place has a member allotted to it When another election occurs, too, it will be interesting to notice the number of votes recorded for the Northern Downs, if Dalby is to become a separate electorate, for the votes polled in the Kittel place have always far outweighed those recorded elsewhere Dalby is undoubtedly entitled to a representative, and ought to have one, but the " member for Northern Downs whoever he might be, has always been regarded as virtually the " member for Dalby, and if the bill should be passed, there will certainly be no cause for complaint in that quarter of insufficient representation Then, if we single out from the list the projected electorate of Peak Downs, what we stand? The old district of Clermont is reduced to a small sized constituency, and the new " electorate of Peak Downs" really means that another member is to be given to the Leichhardt a district which has always had more than its share of the representation The census returns show a decided decrease in the population, but the bill not only contemplates the retention of two members for it, but provides for the formation of a new electorate, which includes some of the most populous of its sparsely inhabited localities, and embraces a small portion of the present Port Curtis district in the absence of descriptive maps, it would puzzle a " Philadelphia lawyer" to trace therein dates of some of the proposed new electorates, and it is therefore absolutely impossible, however, anxious we may be to attend to the public the information they require, to refer to the bill in other than general terms. Nor is there much assistance to be gained by studying the census j returns, as at present laid before the House, and although in reply to Ah See press, the Premier promised to produce a statement I of the population in each new district, we ' presume that the figures, in many cases, will be only approximate, if not partially conjectural. Such a statement as that asked for by Mr See lots ought to have been prepared before the bill was introduced; at any rate before it was attempted to push the measure through a second leading It is plainly discernible that the contemplated íe arrangement is neither fan. not just. No one disputes the rightful chum of the squatting districts to adequate representation, but any plan of electoral distribution which gives an undue preponderance to any class no matter whether pastoral, commercial, 01 agricul usual, cannot command public confidence In considering the schedules, the Bus time members should not forget that the boundaries of the metropolitan electorates are susceptible of better adjustment We do not see why Kangaroo Point should not be added to South Brisbane, as it is though erroneously, in Mr Wvrxin's now imp, not bother any reason why NoithBiisbme and Fortitude Valley should be so confers nigly jumbled together as they are now, More than half of the most populous portion of the Valley properties part which includes the New Farm road, and the streets diverging therefrom, are included in the city, and it would surely, be better understood if the line were drawn from the corner of Wickham and Boundary streets, ! and by the latter street to Leichhardt street, and along that street easterly to the municipal limits This would be a fine illusion, and would add a sufficient number of electors to the roll to entitle the Valley to another member, which addition it may fairly) claim now, when compared with the fact that Ipswich where there are only IS more ulultmiles-lctuuis since repre sentence We can only repeat the war nine; women heartly given to the Opposition to make sure of their ground in dealing with this measure Hun in the Ministry were entitled to credit for sincerity of intention, there is quite sufficient town lot careful watching avoided by the aspect of the bill as presented to the House, nor should a measure which so largely affects the whole community be suffered to pass without giving the public an opportunity of express- ing their opinions upon its provisions It was almost an understood thing that there would not be a quorum in the Assembly yesterday, and when the House met at half-past 10 o'clock there were only eight members present namely, Messrs Walsh, Hemmant, King, Stephens, O'Doherty, MiIcb, Edmondstone, and M'Devitt The Spenl ei according) adjourned the House until the usual hour on Tuesday, but it is probable that there will not be a quorum present until Wednesday A FATHERS upon that point in connection with our municipal institutions will be decided at the Police Court on Monday, when the Mayor, in obedience to a resolution passed in the Council, will prosecute Mr 1 Beattie for sitting as an alderman while holding a lease from the Corporation of the Petrie's Bight wharf As our leaders are once, Mr Lilley advised the Council timE- this was contrary to the 51st clause of the Municipal Act, and the value of the opinion may be conecqu title tested The penalty, if the case 13 decided against Alderman Beattie, is a fine not exceeding £100 not under £50, and a disqualification for scion and from holding any office in or under the Council Mr GiiLhth, instructed by Messrs Macpherson and Lyons, will appear on behalf of the Council lifE bazaar in aid of All Saints' Church building fund will be held in the School of Arts on Monday next and during the week There is still a heavy balance due upon the Church building, and from the success of the previous bazaar for the same object, it is expected that ten or "cut effectually reduce the sum by one-half of the month of the war as a fancy fair we are of course not in a position to give an opinion, but it is said that there is a very large collection of useful and ornamental goods to be disposed of, and in 00 goo I a cause it is hoped they will find purchasers before the bazaar finally closes We have received the following summary of meteorological observations, taken at Sweers Island, Gulf of Carpentaria, during the months of April, May, and June for the month of April the mean shade temperature was 819 degrees Rain fell on three day, and the total rainfall nus 0 20 inch the prevailing will of the month nose E and S B.

The Boggo Wesleyan Sunday School Annual Tea Meeting was held on Tuesday, November 21\. About two hundred sat down to tea. After the tea a public meeting was held in the open air, the chapel not being large enough to hold the people The chair was taken by the Rev. Mr. Fletcher, who spoke at some length, and then called on the Rev. Mr. Taylor, Rev. Mr. Savage, Mr S Fraser, Mr. Jarret, and Dr. Gray. The meeting was thus a happy one, and was further enlivened by several appropriate hymns. A vote of thanks was proposed to the friends who had so kindly provided the tea and the meeting terminated by singing the Doxology. On Wednesday, the 22nd, the scholars met at 2 o'clock to enjoy themselves on the green, and at 6 an ample supply of good things was provided for them in the chapel, at which over one hundred children Sat down At 6 o'clock, the children again adjourned to the chapel, when Mr. George Games was voted to the chair, and gave a very interesting address, and called upon several friends to address the meeting, which closed at half-past 9 by singing the Evening Hymn.
