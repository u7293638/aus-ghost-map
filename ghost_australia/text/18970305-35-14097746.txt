TWO WHEEL. a MACQUARIE PASS. At 1 o'clock on some mornings the stars have an uncanny way of glaring at you Starlight is usually associated in one's mind M lth moonlight poets talk of it as cold and calm, and think their imagination is w endorsed overheated if they have a fancy of life's turmoil no less urgent (here than here But then poets do not usually camp in the Australian bush of a warm spring night, or if they do they sleep well I woke led to look at the glare There was the softest of warm vi miles about us, and fewer noises of the night life than usual. The sky was a front Indefinite, far away darkness that you could feel but not see, and out of it vivid, intense, star by star finished at us that hot Canopus in the zenith unburned nil conceivable lamps, and the blaze of Sirius had maddened Aldebaran in the mild Bull's forehead Cor Leonis was to-night rather the lion's eye, alert and fixed upon its prey Even the Cross was asserting itself, and looked almost (dignified We find camped that night in the open-not from necessity, Since Robertson v. as scarcely five miles off, but for mere romance and the inviting ness of a brown stone of all whose curve made a most desirable camping ground. The plantation above it supplied us a in all the comforts of home, for dry leaves make an excellent mattress, and it was simply a kindness to the trees to lop a few superfluous boughs for our blanketing From our feet the hollow land, struck through here and there with red roads, dropped to the distant labyrinths of Kangaroo Valley for to the east we saw the great ridge that frowns over Jamberoo and all but thrusts Kiama into the Pacific Ocean As the dusk came on through an expectant still- ness, we felt an echo of rolling surf rise over the thousand feet cliffs and dissolve in itself the lesser noises of our neighbour township and its (dairy farms And as we (Iron send off the air was full of a great booming whisper, not so much a sound as the foundation of sounds, like the 64ft pedal pipes of the Town Hall organ When the stars of the us, horror or, a change of wind and stilled the booming Wo endured then stare for a time, turning about with a pleasant rustle of the dry leaves and shafting in half whispers But there was no more sleep Sirius and his Btnullcr comrade had driven it away as effectually as their mortal congeners are apt to do with untimely hon lings We shook ourselves free, climbed back to the road, and stole away down the long hill, to of suit and silent ghosts The village slipped by on either side of us, a vague vision of darker shapes against the dark ness Half-way up the hill beyond it my sprocket wheel began to grit its teeth upon the chain, and a strip or two against small boulders of road metal w oke us from our dreams race , so we stopped to light up, and then walked quietly to the top One of us knoll well enough what lay in front there, but to the other it seemed as though we were going to drop it once through tremulous sea-vapours into a not very distant ocean The stars were dimmer here and the night cooler, and behind a lake of the palest, ghostliest mist that veiled Charon in Creek our disease ocean noises marie themselves fell again Tube the blackness we dropped, and out through the mist at a narrow part of its of since, our lights bearing on it like great luminous night moths Knapsack Hill was stunned, and then the whole long shoreline of ma- Yarra and the broad lagoon seemed to grow, in conceivably dun but still apparent, out of the murmuring void below We lifted the machines over it Ion stone Hall, lent them against it to gether, and fell asleep almost instantly The sun woke us in time, already up and warm With lawns and scratchings (for the bare un- modified ground makes him an inch bed) we sat up to take in the situation Tell, to whom the night riding episode had been a dream among other dreams, nor a good deal puzzled at first about the Mon We had camped-this was how my chum put it on the edge of an inland gully, luxurious on soft leaf mattresses AVo woke upon short bumpy turf within full view of the ocean instead of yesterday's red lead, silver ones wound glistening through a sparkling sea as wind or tide swayed the surface currents for the green paddocks of Robertson there gaped a mile- wide fissure, the gorge of the Macquarie rivulet, and beyond it cliff behind cliff dropped sheer from the springs of the Nepean to melt away into naves of delicious green, the Dapto farms and the farms around Unanderra, till the last of them seemed to surge up like a surf wave against the long spur of Mount Keira that points to Wollongong " The garden of the colony " they call it nowadays s, thin Illawarra district, and no garden ever took more of man's labour in the making Cook saw it as unbroken bush , more than fifty years later it was "a fine brush of great dennis wild hogs are found in it, and afford excellent sport to those fond of bo in hunting " And tion of the original bush hut one little patch remains, oJgcd by the road and out in two by the i inn at, home on the Mine- murra rivulet and the sea At!
