Indeed, almost any amoun'. of language on the part of the injured ghost would ba pardoned by all humane men But what did the ghoBt of Daniel Webster do when he recently triad to walk over a stage strewn with drawing tack* during a materialising Â£6Â»nce in a Wisconsin tiwn ? When the first tack entered that ostensible ghost's right foot he calmly lifted up his injured limb and undertook ti withdraw the intrusive bit of steel It waB not until, in his < fiorts to balance himself on one leg, he ran another tack in his left f .ot, that he broke silence by softly remarking "Ouch;" and it is doubtful if he would have repeated that statement, or ventured upon any other, had he not incautiously sat down, and thus inserted two more tacks Into bis person. In these circumstances he m'eht have totally lost his temper, and no man could have had a word of blame for him ; but instead of letting his ghastly passions rise, he merely expressed his vieÂ« s of the matter by the simole and touching remark, " Well, by gosh !' aud hurriedly withdrew into the mystic cabinet.

"Bats are harmless, although I'll admit they are rather repulsive," he continued, rolling the towel into the form of a switch, and drawing it by one hand through the other to give compactness to the folds. " How, I'll show you presently how I'll treat that bat. I bet I've killed a hundred of them. I know that when I was a bay I used to stand in the door >ard with other boys, and we'd knock at bats with latbB. When I made a sweep at one he came down. There was no use his trying to dodge. You re member, Suean," appealing to his wife, " how I loathed that bat at Uncle Amos' last sum mer?" Mrs. Cobleigh remembered It, Mid cheer fully admitted tbe circumstance. " 8ome people," observed Mr. Cobleigh, snapping the towel once or twice, and putting his eyes square on the ' ird as it dodged around the edge of the celling, "seme people go at a bat as if it were a winged rhinoceros. Kow caution is the prime thing, and uever strike until you are sure you've got a good chance. You wait a moment, until he oomea down in ' each, and I'll show you a trick or two worth know ing." Mr. Cobleigh ceased speaking, and began to x.ove about the room with the utmost caution, his < yes distended, and his fingers nervously clutching the 'uwel.

"Here we are !" and made the blow. It was a tremendous >weep, and there was a terrible crash. Mr. Ooblelgh could scarcely believe Us own senses. The bat pa wind out of tbe room, leaving behind a pair ot elegant TSMS aud a bouquet holder lying ia pieces on .the floor, a screaming (moras of female voices, Mid Â» very excited .nd astonished man He had Sufficient presence of mind to hurriedly whiiper to his wife, " For hMÂ«en'a sake, Busan, don't say a word until after theoom pÂ«nj go," and uttering this prayer, be sack helplessly into a chair.
