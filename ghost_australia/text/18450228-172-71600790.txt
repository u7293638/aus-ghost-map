TO THE EDITOR OF THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN. Sirâ€”Having seen in the Register a statement respecting an advertisement of ours in that paper which is very incorrect, we beg to state the circumstances under which the first insertion in that paper took place. We arranged for twenty insertions of our advertisement, and on doing so, paid the sum of 20s. (being half the price to be charged) on account, and received an order for soap amounting to 16s., which was delivered at Mr Allen's residence in North Adelaide. We expected, when the twenty insertions had been made, we should receive notice to that effect ; but no application was made to us on the subject of continuing the advertisement, nor did we ever promise, or even mention its continuance. Judge, then, Sir, our surprise, after hearing of the death of the Re- gister, to hear its ghost had appeared with an old adver- tisement of ours, which, from its being incorrect in prices, was likely to do us injury in the sale of our manufac- tured goods. We are. Sir, Your obedient servants, WRIGHT & LINN. Hindmarsh, 26th Feb., 1845.
