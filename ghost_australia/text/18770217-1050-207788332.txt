Matt. vi. 33, " Seek first the kingdom/of God, and His right- eousness, and; all- . these/ things shall -be added xxnto yoxx;"x„He ;said he Ayoxxld ;simply say a feiv Avords bearing on tbo solemn purpose for Avhich 'they;Avero;niet together. /The, words -/which/ lie" had chosen, he . thought,: suggested a suitable subject. If any had asked the apostles aa'hat :they.'Avere sent into the world to do, thby Svould 'have vansAvered, to.: set up ' the kingdom of God." Our Lord's . discources were, many of them; specially : directed to explain the kingdom -of God;: and when He: seixt ; forth His disciples,' /their commission Avas . to win ' disciples to that teaching Avhich: set forth -the kingdom./,/ Hence they Avent preaching the things. concerning this kingdom. , They coxxld see, then. the impbrtauce,. of the kingdom of God. . Bishops Avere ordained for the, brdering;of :tha,t kingdom.. AYitii refer ence to the nature of,, this. kingdom, it Avould be J evident that- it- was something in this zuorld. The -parables' of oxxr ;Lord shoAyed' this. The kingdom Avas made up "of mixed elements in,' its . present state,- Avhich, could ;not be infallibly discrimina- ted.

Avorld, no,t , of the , world.. ./ Neither in;Hts.jcharacter,£ nqriin;the .meahs'of its .exten- \- sion; /was it of the world;; Christ had' said. that if His kingdom. 'had, been .of / this woHd,/ then, Avould His servants have fought. /The Apostle Paul said it consisted;1, in righteousness ' hnd 'peace and joy in. tho Holy Ghost. 7jPhey». might / say that: kingdom, was, in its ess/ence," .then, . for" one thing a new relation of. man do God,, the sign- and result; of which was j oy in the Holy, . Ghost. / i For. another/ thing it Aras. a; better, /truer relation , 0 f man. to man— righteousness, that/is to say, a! right ordering of our hearts and lives in relation : to our fellow men.
