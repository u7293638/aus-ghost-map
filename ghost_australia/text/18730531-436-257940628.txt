About a quarter of a mile up the stream their horses were pickoted, and visited by Setb each day. At the bead waters of a creek, about fifty miles from the Platte, was the war-ground of the Snakes, Cheyennes, Crows, and several other tribes, and our friends were liable at any moment to receive a visit from them ; so that as may be supposed, their situation was not the safest one in the world. One cold, 'drizzly afternoon, Setb, with the conBent of.the rest, built a'fire for the purpose of cooking a meal. It was the worst time that distinctly'seen' by any one in the neighborhood.

' When he reached them he saw several torm& 'dart. away, and ! not an Indian remained. During the confusion Seth had appeared, not injured in the. least.

The Indians numbered not over half-i dozen, and were easily repulsed. "I calculate these quarters are getting rather hot," remarked Seth, after tbey had descended and attended to their wounds. " Yes! I should think a visit from half-adozen Indians was a gentle hint that our retreat was disputed," added Summerfield. " Cuss it!" growled Vic. " They've found out this place, and they'll burn us out ef we don't leave blasted soon. I s'pose trappin' here's done with.".

With this he started off, leading Porcupine, and all the other animals following close. After a brief absence he returned. " Now, boys," said he "stick fast to me." And, kneeling on'the earth, he commenced crawling carefully forward, followed by his companions, who soon saw, by the inky blackness, and dry hard rook, over which they were passing, that they were in some sort of a cave. After going twenty or thirty feet, Vic halted and struck a light, and in ten minutes more had a cheerful fire burning. "Boys," said be, as be noticed the wonder on Summorfield's face (Wandaught was never known' to exhibit it), " tlis is another ot Vic's holes. Calc'late we can stay here awhile." This was agreeable news. The men all enjoyed the fire, until at last, overcome by fatigue, they fell asleep: •• Sutnmerneid was awakened by. the .coldness which his dampened clothes gave him..

" You fellers," said te, "T want you to stay here, while 1 go out huntin'.

The-old chief -promised that-sfhoti ir was r lie should send her with 6 : suitable, escort to Fort Leavenworth; where she shduld be given up to tbo whites without a ransom It seemed hard tor the old chief to give up the white maiden. He experienced a genuine affection, and she had grown to be as a child of his own ; yet he waB not selfish, and he resolved that his pro uiisp should be fulfilled. The power of bis white rival had become nearly -Hs great as bis own, and it was a matter of difficulty for him to choose from hjs. warliors, ttfo' in'whoni ho. might.place implicit : faith. • • , Viola was regarded by more than ,Redzel with envy. •'•'• Many savages, indeed, had determined that, before-anotber of theirtaumber obtained posies sion of her, she should bo tomahawked. Yet . this was a .secret: feeling, and never evinced itself openly. Redzel did not dr< ream .that eyes other than his own regarded her with passion, and believed that his only obstacle was with the object itsel £ lie had fully made up bis mind that, could he not gain possession of her by gentle means, be would by threats and force. But, swiftly.and unconsciously the summer fled, and almost before Viola was aware, , W winter was upon • her. . , , •. In answer to her inquiry, tbo chief assured h>-r that it would be madness for her to attempt to reach Fort Leavenworth before the spring opened. ' The truth of this she was compelled to admit, although it seemed inviting misery and death to remain. .
