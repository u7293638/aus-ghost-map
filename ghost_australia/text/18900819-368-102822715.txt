Mr. Geo. 0, Mi/n. Trn unqualified o?ue e whioh attended Mr. Geo. O. Miln'n recent season in Auckland, Now Zealand, induced him to extend his visit to that city for a weelt, and he will consequently open at Ooulburn to-morrow (Wedued?sy) evening. The programme for the two nights cs origionally advertised will remain thie same. Dress cirele tickets taken for the dates first announced will hold good for those now advertised. Of Mr. Gvo. 0. MIiln' irM personation of Hamlet during his season it the Moelbourno Opera House the Daily Telegraph aid:--"The actin?g of Mr. Geeoo. O. Miln in the characters of Richard and Mare Antony had prepared the publio for a tHamlet not only in telligent and scholarly, but-if anob a thing were possible with so thoronghly- thrcsled-out a part--original. Nor was the public disap ointed. Mr. Miln's study of the P'rinceo of enmark is one that is marked with muoh origintlity; it is full of merit and is a masterly performsnoo. .... The various soliliquies wore delivered with fino effect and the dirlogcre in so eay and natural a minnor that it was comething of a revelation to find that ihake speare could be rendered so convorationolly. In the Oloset Scene the ghost does not oppear to the audience, his lines being spoken without, hut at the moment of his supposeod appearnlco a atrong light is thrown upon thie Prince nud Quceel, and Hamlet's eprech is delivered to vaonury. Tih effeot of this ilnnovation was electrical. Tihe hushed house felt a weird urrnnriy foiling as the light madu painfully visible the staring eyes and the tene drawn feelatures, upon which the greet beads of porepiration were literally visible. Mr. Milu's Hamlet is a wonderful porformanoe, and entitled to rankr equally with, if not higher than, either his Richard or Mare Antony."
