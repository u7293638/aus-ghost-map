THE GRASSES AND FODDER PLANTS WHICH MAY BE BENEFI- CIAL TO THE SQUATTER AND AGRI- CULTURIST IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA. The following Paper was read before the Chamber of Manufactures by Dr. Richard Schomburgk, His Excellency Governor Mus- grave being in the chair. Your Excellency and Gentlemen- No doubt you will agree with me that in the household of nature there is not a more im- portant tribe of plants than that of the grasses, as upon the seeds of the cereal division more than two thirds of the population of the globe subsists. The same remark is also applicable in regard to the animal world. To the gramnivorous animals, which are the most numberous amongst the mammalia, the value of grasses as fodder is hardly second to that of their corn for human food, and a considerable portion of the feathered tribe live also upon the seeds of grasses. Without wheat, rye, barley, oats, maize, Guinea corn, rice, what would become of us? It is said that rice alone forms the food of three- fourths of the human race; in other words, of between six and seven hundred millions of the population of the world. As nothing can be uninteresting which is connected with the habits of a tribe of such vast importance to man and beast, I will before proceeding to the real object of this evening's lecture, mention a few more illus- trative facts. Professor Lindiey says in his work, "The Vegetable Kingdom," the use of this most im- portant tribe of plants for food, fodder, clothing, &c.;, requires little illustration. The abundance of wholesome faecula contained in their seeds renders them peculiarly well adapted for the sustenance of man; and if the cereal grasses only, such as wheat, barley; rye, oats, maize, Guinea corn, rice, are the kinds com- monly employed, it is because of the large size of their grain compared with that of other grasses for none are unwholesome in their natural state, only one kind being known amongst the whole tribe, namely the drake (Lolium temulentum - Lin.), the effects of which are undoubtedly deleterious. Sugar is a general product of grasses. For economical purposes grasses are often of much importance. I will only mention the bamboo, which in some parts of the world, especially in Asia, is employed as timber and cordage. Plants of a grass called in South America "Taqnarussa," are living fountains. They grow from 30 to 40 feet high, with a diameter of six inches, from thorny impenetrable thickets, and are exceedingly grateful to travellers and hunters; for on cutting such a reed below a joint the skin of the younger shoots is found to be full of a cool liquid, which quenches the most burning thirst. To this I can testify, as during our travels in South Almerica we hailed with delight such a copse of reeds to quench our thirst. Besides these properties of the grasses I may also mention their uses for paper, cordage, straw platting, &c; In fact, the value of this order to mankind is boundless, and I should trespass too much on your patience if I ven- tured to tell you all of the economical purposes to which the products of the different grasses are applied. Besides these properties of the graminaceae their inorganic products are also remarkable. The cuticle contains a large proportion of silex, as is proved, according to Professor Lindley, by its hardness and by masses of vitrified matter being found whenever a haystack or heap of corn is accidentally consumed by fire. With the exception of the genus bambusa (bamboo) nature has not lavished on the repre- sentatives of this most important and interest- ing order of the vegetable world much outward beauty, nor has the enthusiasm of ancient and modern bards been excited by them, as is the case so frequently in praise of other plants, which have been endowed by nature with every beauty to please the eye, but without the slightest use to mankind. I think we all, in- deed, are apt to look on the grasses with too much indifference, considering that they consti- tute in a great degree the staff of our life. Professor Lindley says further:— "The great mass of herbage known by the name of sedger and grasses constitutes, perhaps, a twelfth part of the described species of flowering plants, and at least nine-tenths of the number of indi- viduals composing the vegetation of the world; for it is the chief source of that verdure which covers the earth, especially of northern coun- tries, with a gay carpet during the year." I extract the following account of the geogra- phfcai;di^ibatioa:^: endues .;by, Prefc»Bor Shaw :— ? ' The family is very aumerons. .

There .niay, hoWever, be some doubt whether one of the ffiher bunch grasses, and not tWElymus con 4ensatus, may be that here noticed: But the most reeeaV reliable, and important informa tion regarding it is contained in tiie following' letters to Mr. Robert Brown, of the - British Columbian Botanical Expedition, from a^riend who liv^d .for several years in the bunch* grass T^fT S^^^ewne'ise, S^pt.'M^; I : ; 'VDear Sir-rrYou ask smy,op^-n of Jihe bunch (grass, of. the. central plateau,' or table ; lands of British Colombia — jBlymns conden. satus, as I believe you botanists call it.
