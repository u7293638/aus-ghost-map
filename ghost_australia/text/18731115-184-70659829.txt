Wedo not :idet{tij?y ourselves with the opinions of our correspondents."] , . , - ? NEMO ME IMPUNE JJAÇESSIT. (To ike Editor of the Australian.) Sm,--I find an erroneous impression has . gone abroad to my prejudice that I am the ail thor of some verses entitled, " An Elegy oh a late Editor," which appeared in your paper a week or two ago. Not for the sake of the contemptible slanderers who have cir- culated this false report, but to satisfy my numerous friends, I will feel obliged by your contradicting it. I may take this opportunity of stating that I have not written a line of poetry or versification since I attained man ' hood. I do not profess to have any talent for lampooning my neighbours, and I never attempt it. Yours trulv. WILLIAM WALKER. [Mr. Walker was not the author of the Elegy in question, and had nothing whatever, to do with it. The author is another well known gentleman altogether, and à frequent contributor to our columns. The slanderers are entirely off the scent in this matter.-ED. AUSTRALIAN.] ( To the Editor of the Australian.)
