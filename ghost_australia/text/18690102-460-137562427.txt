POETRY. SYRINX. By Henry Kendall. A heap of low dark rocky coast Unknown to foot or feather! A sea-voice moaning like a ghost; And fits of fiery weather! The flying Syrinx turned and sped Hy dim rny«l«riovia lioltow»,. Where night is black and day is red, ,, And frost, the flreaiod fellows! Strong heavy foot fells in the wake. Came tip wiib flights of water: The gods were mournful for theaake Of Ladin's lovely daughter. For when she came to spike wad sptne Whene reef end river gather. Her feet Were sore with shell and chine: (She oould not travel farther. Across a naked strait of land, Blown sleet and surge were humming ; But trammelled with the shifting sand She heard the monster coming 1 A thing of booth, end horns, And lust! A gaunt goat-footed Stranger ! She lowed her body in the dust, And called on lie on to change her! And called on Hermes fair and fleet, And her of boouds aud quiver, To hide her in the thickets sweet That sighed above the river. So he that sits on flaming wheels, And rules the sea and thunder. Caught up the satyr by the heels, And tore his skirts in sunder I While Areas of the glittering plumes Took Ladon's daughter lightly, And set her in the gracious glooms That mix with moon-mist nightly. And touched her lips with wild-flower wine, And changed ber body elowly, Till in soft reeds of song and shine, Her life was hidden wholly 1
