THE SNUGGERY DRAIN. ( To the Editor of the Harder 1I'atch.) Sin,-My attention ha» bwn called to a letter appearing in your contemporary of April 29, under the above heading, and signed by "Old Joe," in which reference is made to n certain " famous concoction that Mr. Olnunl-ers read to our representatives in Millicent." In the first place allow mo to nay that I read nothing, neither had I anything to read. A small piece of pnjicr containing a few questions I ha t jotted down to pat to our nirmbrr?, nil of which had been Hiked and answered before T rose, I may have had in my hand, hut I do not remember. Ilfcnte probably the supposition. I fully appro ciate bis gratuitous left-handed compliment, and hasten to assure him that overy word of that ad dress was my own " roncoolion " It had no other authorship, and what I said 1 believed to bo for tho good of tlio dUtriut. In conclusion, allow mo to ask " Old .loo" one iiiifgiioii- llow came it about that he, being at thu metiiog an I hearing me make nee of these (as ho #up|-ow») damaging statements, had not the manliness to stand up and assort bis claims, ins'cud of allowing severe! weeki to pass, then forming a theory foundod on supposition only, addiug un truths to it. "Old Joo" calls upon me to account for the ghosts his own imagination has called up. I am, Sir, Ac.. 0, 0, CHAMBERS, Munimbum.
