"So the doctor says, and he ought to know; lie's as poor as they make "em." .Zella closed her door, drew the blinds I over the port-holes, flung herself upon hei I couch,. and presently fell asleep, and I dreamt-that Dexter had drowned hini-l eelf. J ... At-dusk , she wrapped herself up in her Ulster and went on deck. Pacing to and fro, in on aimless way on board ship, some I to get up an appetite, some 'by w!ay of a] constitutional, some out of simple restless I Bess, she met Dexter several times. Twice, I ,m the lamplight, she caught sight of his face, puckered and anxious; twice he saw ;ihera'-plamly' and. stood .still to took ax .her. She thought it wise to retire to heir I cabin. She had a light supper sent up to) her. After supper she put out her lamp and lett the port-holes partly open for the benefit of the' air. The night was warm, and with an almost silent sea. On a seat, I close, by 'her cabin, two men sat and talked. Lftlamy. a queer conversation has been over heard through the port-Oioies of deck cabins. - Zella, lying upon her couch, might easily have spared herself from the tempta-1 tion of eaves-dropping. She had, indeed, risen to close the ports, when, hearing her I name, she paused, more out of self-defence than from curiosity. I Philip Grey/' said the voice; "a nice! sort of young chap; the sight of him I . seems to .have sobered Dexter." i ? . iiow.s that.said the second voice ( evidently that of an American. ' I "Says^ if- ever she had . a brother that's him."- " - ' --V- ' ' «" [ who's she.''" asked the American.) 'He don't say; but the nigger shake* his : head and lifts up his hands, palm* out, as itmeli a"s to let you understand | that Dexter's. dotty," the .Englishman re-1 plied. : I guess he didn't seem dottv when he! picked up a full to my flush," said the ..American,,. I "He's been wandering about the-deck; ..wouldn't have Sam with.,him; would go alone;, and-he's -just-now--told the purser I that_there's a"ghost^aboard'. The purser.) chaffing- him,- says, 'Man or woman, sir'/ And the millionaire, he pulls up straight I and he- says, "The ghost of a man ami' '."tjifi-face of"a woman he should have'mar-1 -ried; but-?' And there he'stopped; re I ; peated the story to the 'but',' and then crept away,' as if the ghost ' was after him."; . ' ;. I . "D.T.'?'-' ejaculated-the American. 'V: I "Think so?" I "Sure so!" ? . j -'1 thought . a man was "dangerous under I those circumstances and had to be rp strained'(" ? ? I "Ain't ;you-ever li3d-er-so much as-I well. a touch of'.'em?" - . - '"Jfever;" ? ) "You;'have" always been a sober man?" I "Mostly." ----- - v | "Then you've escaped a lot of misery. I I'd sooner see ghosts than snakes-and bot tle-imps." . | r : .?"'"'Hope' you" may - never -"see - either/' said I the Englishman- "Let me offer you another cigar?" | ..-^'Thank you."- - I Then"there"was .a striking of matches. I . "I saw a rat along the * beam in my| stateroom last night, just as I was turn-1 ing off the, light; and I was .terrified to death fear dt wasn't one." "For -fear it wasn't-one!" said the Eng lishman," with a note of surprise in. the tone I of Kis voice.' " I .should ft-mjle!? Wihy, you don't -tell Die you don^muterited:? - -. Do--you think I I wanted it to be one of those other I rate?" I . ."C'h!'

"No; not- quite sucih a fool as that," said the Englishman. "IBie...purser reckons it was a rat; they \- get-em, once .in Q-way, along, the gang planlcs, in dock; actually lie quiet till night and jtihen jixst invade iffie- ship. He's diss-1 .turbed -them.. iumselt'iii". dr-oves " I ? "Really?1' fFacJtyXa^ure.you." ., . I "He-Siys so?" . I ."On-itis oath." I _ - '"I3jeit <w!ty do'fhcjr -leave tie gaing-plainks _in.-conixeotion wxiih the- shore at night?" -. dW"44iey:do ifcwenty -other-' fool things?" xvjamed Hie -American. ; - Then.--lZaLla, went oftrt once: more upon deck. It -was a moonlight night. She eat -for u -few minutes in 'tzhe shadow of a \- ventilaimg-, ^haft, ^vatdhdng the long, white track the mokm naa makrag, and peopling imiz&mary; angek, -.when once more she fceaid ttier . sasme; «ns time her real name and the voice of Dexter. He was -epeatmg.to--tie.pniBer. . ''It'-vvas^aikeii in ithe-name of- Zella Bun men, ' -said the purser. "When was-it-token?" asked Dexter slowly, as rf -it was difficult for !him .to speak plainly. "Oh, about a week.-ago." "And did-did-dbe-come aboard^" .. /'I suppose not. T5ie undeKtanding was | " tihzb if site could -not occupy at she would ; transferat 'tb-Mr. Philip -drey, her cousin- i which she did." . 'I \- "Her oousrrr!" -said Dexter. "And-was ' it-you-tbwb-er-said Ned Glover- was on board"?" . "Me? No! I never heard the name, ' to my knowledge." "No-I suppose-not. Wonderful moon, ain't it? Do you b'lieve-that Christ walked on the-sea?" "Oh, yes; why, of course. Don't vou. Mr. Dexter?" "I don't-b'lieve anything-except' that I tell you-again-there's ghosts-on this ship-^-" "One of your countrymen has been "tell ing me there's" rats. Some fellows call 'em snakes, some rats, some little black devils; you call 'em ghosts, Mr.'Dexter If I was you Pd-see the doctor; he knows how to -deal with such things." Doctors am t no-good to me, purser. Seediere, yonVe been bind-to me-I want "to-grwyou-a tip." Then there was a pause, as if Dexter was thrusting something into .the parser's hand, and-as if the purser resisted him. "Itfs your pocket-book, Mr. Dexter! I ; coioMa't-itiiink of it." "Yooive-a wife-and famly-you told me 1 so-not iftoo well off. I'd like to make -you happy. "Somebody's-got tto-be made happy. I know what-you mean. They might say-I 'had given it you when I was drunk-or you tcro'k it-when I was dead." "Mr. Dexter, come along,.and let's have a thtfinJi .wiith.-tle dbotar." « "I have written a letter-it's in this paeke't-book. The 'letter says-why I give it you-and- 'it- ccnitaine a few thousand! dollars-and a cheque-book, with-the power1-to draiW a few-more. If you won't lave it, I'll dhraek-it overboard." ?""Clhi!, (Mr. Dexter, don't do that." . "Then take it!" '"Yoil are' too kind, Mr. Dexter," said "iffie purser, evidently tolling the ipocketv-'boo'k. "Ywi think - er-I've-er-got-D.T. ? Thin'k-Fm-drunk?" "No, Mr. Dexter; I would mot be so rude." "I have been drunk. Had. 'em, I-dare say-but I (never was soberer than I-am now. Good night-old chap,-, I'm going to turn in now. Where's-my man ?' "I'll fmdiihiiri for you, Mr. Dexter," eaid the purser; and they went into the gang way. ZeSla slept badly fh'at night. S'he lay in bed walttihing the glin'tte of moonlight on title distant visifca of sea that she saw oc casionally. . ." Whether it was mid night, or la'ter, s!he -did' not know; but it was soon 'after the striking of bells and the soothing "All's well!" of the watch that one oif tie portholes was gradually eclipsed by a face, with eyes that for a moment seemed luminous; it was tie face of Hiram Dexter. . . . 'She sfcrank .back into 'h'er berth and. held her bnelath. . ... It disappeared. . . She won dered' if she ha'di been dreaming No; sle felt sure She had not. . . Dex ter had penetrated her disguise and had ?been, reconnoitring Iter cabin. . . . S'he drew her blinds, turned on the electric light in a small reading-lam^, and went to sleep, and awoke no more until late in the morning. . . Looking at 'her watch, she found it was 11 o'clock. She dressed and rang 'her bell. "'Bring me some breakfast, steward." "Yes, sir. What'll you have?" "Ooffee and toast, and whatever else is going." .. "Nice grilled salm'on land a dish, of cut lets, 'am and eggs, and " "Salmon, thank you, and a little fruit." "Yes, sir," said 't'he steward. "Some nice grapes the captain's put on the table, a present as le've had." Zella felt wonderfully refreshed. She hardly .remembered when she had slept so well, in spite of lor bad dream or the start IJeXter "had given !her by looking into her cabin. The steward brought her an excellent breakfast and laid the cloth with even more care than usual; had. more time, she supposed-. ""Rather a lawful thing 'appened last regit." ihe said, as lie was leaving tie room. "Indeed," said Zella, pouring out her coffee. "Mr. Dexter, the millionaire, drowned hisself." "Good leavens! man, you don't say so?" "The watch see him go. One of ihe men on night duty went after him; they lower ed a boat. Didn't you hear the screw stop? Then you must have slep' like any thin'. We laid to, for nigh upon a' hour. No sign of 'im; !le must have gone down like a lump of lead. 'Hawful, ain't it? And a millionaire, too!"
