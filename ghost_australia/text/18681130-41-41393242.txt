The Rir Robert Sale, having received on (ward her horse', hauled off to a stream berth to await a favourable tide for proceeding to sex The GLEH 0KU03D. from London, leached the anchorage on Saturday morning, having made the land to the southward of Kangaroo Is.and three days previously, Vut the light winds prevented her progress to her destination. The vessel looks as well as on previous voyages, and as each wool ship turns up the immense improvements of modem craft are more and more apparent. That the traffic is also wonderfully incieasing is proved by the fact that Captain Angel is now on his last voyaae iu the 'Glen,' and next year pur poses bringing out a (till finer vessel to keep pace with the age. The Glen Osmond will also continue in the trade und-ir another com mander, so that the Elder line will possess some very fine ship*. Of the present voyage Captain Angel reports leaving London on August £9. but in coniemieuce of light wes'erly winds, she was not off the Luinl until September 4, when she lay becalmed for two days— a most unusual occurrence in that latitude, rendered more surprising by numbers of tropical fish (albacore. sharks, ami uwordfish) being in the vicinity. However, on the Kth she made a fair start with a favouring breeze, and in 3D' N. fell into brisk trades, which ceased in la*, and for It days only 40J miles were accounted for. On October 1, in X N., the South-East trad«B commenced, and on the 3rd crossed the Equinox, when the vessel made several days' good running a: from 230 to 240 miles per diem. The meridian of the Cape was passed on 'J9th October, and in 4 V south a succession of Kales was experienced till reaching the line of Cape Leuwin on 13th November, when the wind veered to about north, and remained in that quarter till the Glen had beaten up for the land. After sighting Cape WillougUby, the fir»t slant of fair breezes was felt, and the Gulf was entered by way of Backstairs Passage. She was seen from the stations early on Saturday morning; her general appearance soon establishing her identity. When anchored there were friends from the shore ready to welcome back some old colonists who returned liy her. The vessel being of a little over 17 feet in draught* it was necessary on Saturday to reduce it as much as possible. In order to trim her a quantity of weight was carried from aft forwards until three inches were taken off. The pilot was sanguine he would take the lor either this morning or to-morrow. Among the crew and otiicers several old faces were recognisable, especially that of Mr. Aliier, the chief officer, -whoae long servitude in. colonial vessels hai tendered him equal to the routine duties of the Pnrt. The Rotal Shi pherd is again in commission, and when lUptaiu Ward returned from Port Augusta on Sunday he at once made fast to the Orient- Liner Darra, into which a lot of copper is to be forthwith transhipped. The Ettie was wool- laden at Port Augusta when the Shepherd left, and bad been there 14 days ready for sea, but had not a ghost of a fair wim during that period. The barque Kohinoor hat inanased to drop down somehow, and was passed on Friday when 25 miles SAY. of Pott Wallaroo, ' at which place she was to take in copper. TheBoBKBT Hise. with the Cape Jaffa light house on board, arrived at Lacepede Bay on the 22nd, and got aground there until the following tide; when Captain Mortes3 tendered what assis tance was needed, and she was floated into deep The' Per. barnue, iadaily expected fromHobart Town with a full cargo of Taamanian produce. The Nkw Tidal iya!UXS.-rWith all deference to the commercial code of signals as a means of communication, there are several coasting masters and others interested in knowing the water-sign .Is who do not appreciate the new-fangled idea of sub stituting three fli^ for one in making the inches. 'Indeed, they fail to discover in what manner the old signals offended in any wav, beemg they were ' easily understood. I'veiybody knew th.tt the numerals », 2. 3, 4, 5, G, fcc, made so many inc'icu, ?herea-t by i\u impruved method t^rec thc-tue needed to make up e-jcu nuuwraj. It is carnally tesircl that the proposed chauge may not be yirieJ into cited., as it will only leasl to serious :')nf union.
