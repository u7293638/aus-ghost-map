TALES AND SKETCHES. THE GHOSTLY RENTAL. A*nnr days later, I suspended my studies and went off for the summer's vacation.

But was it not her spirit and something more ?' *l^» mnAJftm of September saw me again eatahnabed among the thBologic shades, but I made no haste to revisit the haunted boose. On the thirtieth of September, at noonday, I a feeble rap at my door. I replied with an luviUuD to enlr i, bul as tins ptodnced DO effect I repaired to the door and opened it. Before me atood an elderly necress with her handker* cbasf folded acnes her bosom. She looked at ainwwitf gravity and decenev which aged penons of bar race eo often wear. I stood interrogative, and at but, drawing her hand tram her ample pocket, she held up a little book. Itwestbecopy of Pascal's 'Thoughts' that I bad given to Oifltsin Piamoud. 'Heeae, air,' she said, very mildly, 'do yon know this book? ** PootectW,' said I, ** my irtmt is on the fly MIw3l write iny name if you file, mod yon can conxpan ftmn, I umend, 'igmij— ?** it would oc osraMHa nr,' uc Bud, ** I p«nnnt red.

A glance assured me that she knew of my prjeeted expedition, though, in her own opaque black pupil, there was not a gleam of ekf-bebayil. ' But why should Captain Diamond drop off?'

He rubbed his forehead, slowly, awhue, and at hat, his comprehension awoke. 'An, yea,' he murmured, I trust yon. A hundred and thirty-One dolbn. In old pieces— all in old piecee.'

I took my departure and punned my journey with a sufficient reariute step. When I reached the house, I made a propoiatory bow in front of it, in emulation of Captain Diamond. I had timed my walk so as to be abb to enter without delay; night had already fallen. I turned the key, opened the door and abut it behind me. Then I struck a light, and bund the two candlesticks I had need before, stanaWon the tables in the entry. I applied a match to both of them, took them op and went into tbe parlour.
