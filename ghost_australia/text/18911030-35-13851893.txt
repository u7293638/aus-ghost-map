A WORD FOR RELIGIOUS IMPOSTORS. (From the Pall Mall Gazette.) In the Daily Chronicle there are again columns and columns of the now Blavatsky boom" In this month's Contemporary Review, in the shape of an interesting article by Miss Julia Wedgwood on Laurence Oliphant, there is something very like a vindication of the " Prophet Horns" Oliphant, as our readers may remember, revised in " Masollam " the enthusiastic picture of his teacher and his tyrant which he had drawn in " Piccaddly," and revised it to some purpose Unless his namesake and biographer has done Mr Hams the cruellest injustice, " Masollam " could hardly be called a caricature It is the picture of a vulgar and a greedy impostor But Hums, if we accept Mrs Oliphant's picture of him, w as-or rather is, for he is still living and flourishing all that and worse According to the version which underlies or appears in every chapter of her book, Horns abused in a hundred ways the absolute domination which he succeeded in establishing over the mind of a man certainly as much his superior in culture and ability as in unselfishness and zeal He alternately compelled his victim to a mental sterility which to a man of such powers as Oliphant must have been far more intolerable than the severest car from manual toil and sent him out into the world to exercise his powers in his accustomed work, but to exercise them for thopccuni ary benefit of the prophet and his community He got hold of Oliphant s pro] perty, and would only let it go when it was wrested from him by the law. He separated Oliphant from his wife inflicted upon the poor girl mental torture of the most refined cruelty, broke her health by his persecution, and hastened the death of Oliphant's mother by his brutality So at least, we understand from Mrs Oliphant's admirably written biography Unless o'! this is a parcel of lies -the contention, of course, of the several disciples of the Harris cult who have made themselves heard since the publication of the book-unless Oliphant and all his friends as well for his biographer were all in a conspiracy to defame Horns, he is a w reach whom it would be difficult adequately to describe There is something peculiarly repellent in the callousness which does not scruple to take advantage of the weakness of high-minded and generous souls upon a side which represents them at their highest point of aspiration The world has turned rationalistic, but it is still rife with a pathetic striving and yearning after faith It is as earnest as over it was in the days of Crusaders, of anchorites, of martyrs ' ' The hungry sheep look up 'and are fed with lies, hollow pretensions, petty trickery It is horrible, the cold, deliberate prostitution of the spiritual surely it is that unforgivable "Sin against the Holy Ghost " which people in Bunyan's time, and, indeed, as late nsBorrow's, used to be awake in terror of committing If Hams did so abused his power over Oliphant, it is to our mind idle to argue that his hold over Oliphant's money was due to Oliphant's foolish- ness to plead that in spite of all the man had fine qualities, that he began with no thought of either cheating or tyranny, and that in view of Oliphant's own acknowledgment that the breaking of his will was what he most wanted in life, and that for this he owed gratitude to Harris, the attack in "Masollam" was therefore treacherous and ignoble, whether or not the description he libellous "And yet, though if we rightly understand Miss Wedgwood'B premisses we cannot go so far as the conclusion that we have quoted, there are undoubtedly some half- truths upon Harris' side, which we think are apt to be forgotten in these discussions. It seems certain that whether he and Mdme Blavatsky are or are not to be classed as arrant humbugs, there are plenty of people who have found in both of them an aid to a higher life Nobody can doubt, for instance, the sincerity and high-mindedness of such a disciple as Mrs Besant In the crude materialism which she professed before she met the foundress of Theosophy, or on the idea of Mahatmas and the conception of any laws higher than those of the test tube must have come as a ray of light No one who read the enthusiastic account of some of Harris's poetical rhapsodies which we lately published from a correspondent could doubt that here, too there were the germs of a quickening of the best aspir tions theosophy may be a grotesque farrago, the Harp Sian cult may be compact of credulous servility, but if either helps any man or woman to a better and more unselfish life by all means let that man or woman hold to it. We do not grudge the French Canadian and physical good which he may corn e from taking pills of paper stamped with the image of the Virgin, nor the poor Italian woman who fell on her knees before a London dentist's show-case of tooth any elevation she may have felt from the idea that they were saintly relics Joanna Southcote immaculate conception was but a dropsy of which the poor woman in due course died, but perhaps she was as fine a marri r as ever burned for an idea The world has not disposed or its " religious impostors " altogether when it has marked them down as cheats and pitied their followers as dupes, and a Harris or a Blavatsky may have to their credit more help rea dered to some real human need, in spite of all, than many just men who were never reported on by the S P C
