ORIGINAL POETRY. A WEARY WEIRD TO DREE. There is a quaint old Scottish phrase That haunts my memory ; It speaks of dark ami burdened days— A wearyyolrd to dree, A weary weird t Ah mo, how oft tiia erv borsts from some soul. ' Oivo ino a moment's resplto soft . From this my dreadful dole 1" To dree the fate, to linger on, In" dally anxious care, Until all hopo and strength are gone. And earth shaws nothing fair; How many thus from day to day . Llvo.tbie 'strange." death in life," WhUe idl-aloug the tlarksomA way ' Are bftWcureqs tife.
