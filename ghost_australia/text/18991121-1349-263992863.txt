MR. AFFLECK'S. SHIVERS. ..(To the Editor Yass Couriex-.) jjear air, — unuer the aoovx heading thei-o appeared in lsist Tuesday's Couriei a letter from a person" signing himself " A Sincere Well-wisher." This I mav inform you is being treated as a splendid joke in this part of the electorate. The cloven-foot is rather a little too promi nent in it for the letter to be treated othexwiso. Why the individual who wi-ote it had the audacity to sign him self as a well-wisher of Mr. Affleck I cannot imagine. Evidently after all other tactics have failed, lie is now going to try the dodge of. a " friend " and " well-wisher " to unseat our popular $nd tried representative I can inform " Well-wisher " tliat when I10 advises Mr. Affleck to resign ho does not echo the feelings of his (Mr. Affleck's friends. He says tliat now the fiscal question is gone our member has nothing big to fight for. Now, in my opinion this is all tho more reason why Mr. Affleck should retain his. seat, for it is tho cool and collected heads of- such men as bo that wo now require to govern this! :ounr,ry now that she is passing through I mch a serious crisis ; not hot-headed ' creatures like " Well-wisher " and the " young man " whom tho people of Ynss I electorate know where to put their hand I nn. I defy "Well-wisher to bring forth J proof of even ono constituent who re frained from writing to Mr. Affleck on account of that gentleman's sickness. When the electors wish to unseat Mr. Affleck they will soon do so, but they will not do so while their wants are being attended to in such an ablo manner. I do not think, even if Mr. Affleck did resign, that " Well- wisher's" young man (wlio is pi-obably " Well- wisher " himself) would stand the ghost of a chance of being elected to fill the seat, even if the present member wero generous to him, and gave him a helping hand to such " a big chance in life."— — Yours, ifcc.. OBSERVANT. Grabben Gullen, 11/11/99.
