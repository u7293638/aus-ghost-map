The story is substantially that of ShakBpeare, though ; the text is ^not very closely followed; T-o^ayihat the. music was composed by Terdl isenough to shew thatit is of a high class;' Of course it is tragic throughout, and, in some paragraphs, almost unpleasantly sombre.,; The concerted mubie pleasedrbetter'than~the''s6ngai though -two -or three «f these were vfery fine; The clvorusesat the close of the first and second acts were especially impressive, possessing all the wild grandeur which is so characteristic of the composer; and they were rendered in a most creditable way. .- JEhe. choruses of the witches were also impressive, the music harmonising completely with, the weird surronndiags of the scene.

Any composer turning one of Shakspeare's dramas into jan -opera has necessarily this diffi culty to, contend against— -the music is the first, consideration ; the sentiment and the acting are made* secondary. They, however, who haw xeen ShaksBeare: slaved -bv a tolerablv Com petent company, or who have studied him in private, fail to find, however grand the music may be, a realization: of their highest: concep-; tions of his genius... If .one might «ay so -sdth-. out offence, we . should say that it is a mistake to adapt ''Macbeth' to the lyric ^stase. Th'e leading performers on Wednesday -did them .work with: nndonb'ted ability ; and, viewed simply as a musical interpretation^ 'Macbeth*1 was a success. : But the difficulty as in looking! at it solely from the musical point of view.
