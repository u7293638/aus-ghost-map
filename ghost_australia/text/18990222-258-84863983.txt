-WTTKrfyT.T. ATJEOXJS - Political Items. Referring to the Trades Hall crowd. %t Ipswich, Mr Hoolan said :—'•When they received the land it was of pom- ; jnercial value, and common sense, should hare supgested to them to hold ! to it "without resorting to Government ] aid to mortgage it. But they owned i tut mmmnm sense unless it affected ■their pockets or salaries : and he had Jiever met any men more able to pat "a dry bit away" for themselves than ■some of the A.LuF. party." Sir Itennon's clever speech at Towns irlile was spoilt by a reference to Mr Hoolan; a brother Independent candi date, by the way. It appears that only i Mr Liennon can pose as an Indepen- } ideat. He may be one. but Mr Hoolan ) lias proved himrelf, and has declined to "bow the knee to tfce cabal in Brisbane. - Because Mr Hoolan enlivens his re marks with a little nonsense now and then, which we are told is relished by the wisest men, Mr Lennon votes him a clown. There are few men in the North who know the capacities of the cowftry, its capabilities, and the idlo syncracises of its public better than Mr Hoolan, and had Mr Lennon start ed in life with the same lafik of edu cation and fought the same uphill bat tie he would have sufficient sympathy *» regret his hasty; unnecessary and Hlrjudged utterances. When the Chil-. lagoe Railway Bill, with its half ■ Spillion expenditure in the colony, "without a pennorth of risk to the State was proposed, Mr Hoolan's com mon sense at once accepted It as the j salvation of a great district, and he j "had the pluck to stick to his opinions. Ifnrthermore, it takes a clever clown to fill big halls at 3/-, 2/- and 1/- ; Mr. tennon would be surprised at the wav ills "gate" would fall off if he imposed tliose price's. Mr Lennon, the Independent candi date for Townsville, in his speech re ferred to the Townsville Political As sociation as follows "In Mav he re ceived a circular from "W. H. Tnn twidge," inviting him to attend a Sleeting at the Oddfellows' Hall to aform a Political Association. Not hav ing had notice in the past that Mr. ^idbridge was distinguished for any •political leanings, his curiosity was aroused, but it was out of cariosity *hat he attended the meeting. Mr Mac Kanghton was in the chair. Mr W. J. Castling wag present, and about 40 or «► of the most prominent and influenr members of what was regarded'by themselves as the most Influential As sociation. They said the objeet of the Meeting was tofom an association tor we purpose of "combating the efforts our enemies." He (Mr Lennon) look W about the room, under the chairs, "ft 4evil an enemy did he see any where. The enemies must have been ■a. the air, an® c& a. ghost-like charac yere o§icej>ti S»le to his eyes." * * Electors ytll have their little joKe; i tlielr latest Is to pat a^eriooe looking i Wan to ask "What about a tax oil I Q&s.r; Shame oil such tactics. 1 'Mr. Kennedy, an aspirant for polit-1 Seal honors at Georgetown, is reported as follows on tie fiscal question by the] "Slnndic Miner" :—"Protection," said Sir Eehnedy. "was never no good to no | -conntry. Look here, gentlemen," he cried, 'there's-a tax on w'eat, and wot 4o we want "that for.

Kenedy, fol lowing distinguished example, declared Uin8^{ (says the "Mundte Miner,") to "be an avowed and bttj^^oaimy _ of "Thrift. Shade of Samuel SxiiHes, how ^u;wouldiu^e. wept!" Thrift, said the politician, was the curse of every" coun try.1 It caused competition, wd mis and thieving, and crilme, "What all inrgaote? heaskSd. ' Thrift! _made people loonerties? Thrift!

He believed in ev «iylaia& enjoying the fruits of his ia lipr, but .not-in *Hmft.: Mr- Kennedy touishednponseveral othertojucs not "worth mentioning or listening to, but always dashed back with another fiery denunciation of Thrift. And, as the -contents of-the watering was then get ting alarmingly low owing to his .quenching the fever caused by his hor ror of Thrift he had another good swig and sat down amid applause, some of "which was genuine. Mr RuHedge in his speech at Roma gave the following illustration —-"One man became possessed of a fine speci men of a trail pup, and as he had to ^E® away to his work each day he left tiie dog's training in charge of his young hopeful, threatening what he Would d^v if his education was neglect fid. Things went on for some time, \- until one day his son came dancing in, and said. "Father, just go down on your tands and knees before the pup and shout out "BlBtheram ! B'atheram!' " . The father, unsuspectingly, got do'WTi ■on all fours before the pup and in his most savas» tones yelled "Blatheram! ^.%laiherfim!":jnie pup at once flew into a rage, and, springing up. canght the tnan on the nose, and obstinately re ""tflined his hold despite all efforts to ire off. Tfce boy danced with siee, cafting to his father, "Don't shake flim off. father; it'll be the makings of the pup!" (Laughter.) The Labor party, would be like the little boy. *I%ey would yeoture upon this experi mental le^atwin and when things %egan to go. wrong would cry out to *lgp_'«©uintry, ^Eton't mafca a aoisf-:" "doh'tshiakeus off; well 'be the mak ings of the country."
