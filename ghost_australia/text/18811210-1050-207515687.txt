THE POWER OF THE KEYS. : There are three remarkable passages in the . Holy. Scriptures; the right' under standing of which we hold to. be 'a matter of sweat. imribr'tarice'to sound' views of the ministerial' office' in1 the' 'Church 'of Gthndt; arid' we proceed to'Idohsideiffthdm' mth' an anxious desire neither uriduly to derogate from nor unduly to.' 'exalt11 that reverend office. 1 ' ' !" f: "/ - / ; The .three passages are Matt" xvi 19, iMafet. xviii. 18,. John xx. 23. " " . , In lilatt. xvi.'' 19, our Lord>:'iii'U8;ad-. i dress to St. Peter (who had just1 ackriowr lodged him to be the Christ', "the Son of the living God), says—" And I will' give thee the keys of the kingdbiri of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth' shall be bound in heaven ; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on :earth 'shall be loosed in heaven." In Matt, xviii i 18, our Lord, addressing am. the apostles, and teaching them how they should deal with offending brethren, says — " Yerily'I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bmd on earth shall' be bound in ; heaven ; ' and whatsoever '.ye shrill loose bri :earth 'shall be loosed iriheayen'."; ' ... In 'John xx 23, again' addressing aZZ the apbstles, our Lord says — !" Receive ye' the Holy ! Ghost.: whosoever ; sins -yd ' remit they are remitted unto them';' !and whoso ever sins ye retain they are retained." 1 We shall not now enter into the ques tion, "whether the first of these texts, with its context, gave St. Peter a primacy or superiority over the rest of the Apostles that would form the subject of a. distinct consideration, our present object of in quiry is a different one, what is the nature arid extent of the power conferred1 by our' Blessed Lord in any or all of these pas sages, upon the Apostles or any of theiri, or on those who were to succeed them in their pastoral office in future times. Three ' things are spoken of by our Lord, which may be either distinct in' their nature or several forms of expression for denoting one and the same thing. 1st. The keys' of the kingdom of heaven. 2ndly. The power of binding and loosing on earth. : 3rdly. The power of rebutting or re-' taining siris. What " the kingdom of heaven " means in the passage iri Matt, xvi., 19, has been the subject of much discussion; and there are strong reasons for holding that it is used in this and other passages as referring to the " kingdom of heaven " in its now existing form of Christ's Church militant here on earth, preparatory to its future development in glory ; but we are willirig, for the sake of making the discussion as simple as possible, to treat it for the pre sent as if it related directly to the future state of that kingdom only, rather than to its present state as now existing on this earth. ' ' . , , , . / Upon this supposition' the most favour able to the exaltation of the power of the priesthood, how does the matter in ques tion stand ? On the same night that our' Lord was betrayed, he said to his disciples— " Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations ; and I appoint you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging thei twelve tribes of Israel." So ;Mritt. xix.', 28—" Arid J esuB said unto th'em, Yerily'l say unto you, that ye which have followed imei; iri 'the regenera tion, when the' Son of 'Man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall" sit upon twelve thrones, ' judging the twelve tribes of Israel,'', which' passage; closely follows verses 23 2d/, ' in which he say's— " A rich man. shall hardly enter 'into' the kingdom of heaven, . and it is easier for a camel to go through' the eye of a needle than, for a. rich man, to . enter into the kingdom of Go'd." . . , ' Assuming that those passages refer to the same kingdom of, which St. Peter was to be given the keys it 'would follow from them' that thrikingdom appointed to' the ' apb'stles!Swas' j"norie < other ethan 'Christ's ' own kingdom, wlrichithe- Father had ap- ' pointed to' him', arid which ris alike; with out "distinction;' called! " the'kindom of heaven " and the kingdom"'1 of' 'God." And': it ' is' surely i manifest,' 'that 'fChrist never intended' to' deprived JdtnSelf of his kingly power'by conferring' aid hisapostlcs ; twfelve" thrones,. ron which they "were to judge'the twelve'diribes of Israel. What, then, was meant by our Lord when he promised St. Peter (admitting the promise was' madei-to .him), "I will give thee the , keys of ' the kingdom of heaven ?" Could he i have- meant to re linquish the power of; opening and shut ting the kingdbiri of heaven to whomso ever he will, and to bestow on any apostle, hqwever great, that exclusive power? ' Surely it would be equally absurd in reason and inconsistent with the rest of God's revealed Word to think so. We doubt, indeed, if any one, however high his notions of priestly power, would. ven ture to' assert 'a proposition so startling and extravagant. Hear, however, what our Lord says iri the parable, of the ten: virgins, who came to the door of. the, kingdom of heaven, after the; door '.was.- shut, saying, " Lordj Lord, open to ws." . Does he answer, Go to Peter, .for I have, given ' him the keys ? No ; but verily I say.ainto you, . " I know you not." And, again, Rev. i. 17, 18 — " Fear riot I am' the first and the. last, I am he that liveth and was dead, rind, behold, lam alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death" And, Rev.iii. 7j — " These things, saith he that is holy, lie that is true, he that hathJ th €?Jcey of David, he that opened and no man shuttethj and shutteth and no man opened." ; Can any one doubt that Christ, who is the Alpha and the Omega, the first arid' the. last,, has still in his hands the keys.of both- heaven arid hell, and that ririither St. Peter nor any other can open or shut the kingdom of heriveri, in the same sense that our Lord does, " that hath the key of David, and that' operieth arid' no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth ?" -In, what sense Sk Peter and the apos tles, or any of their successors,, were given, the keys of the kingdom' of heaven, we shall endeavour presently to elucidiate. We shall now. only say, that it must be in a: different or at least: a wholly subor-1 diriate' sense from that in which our Lord; himself holds them. We shall riow consider the power of remitting and retaining :sins; giveri to all the Apostles in John xx. 23 ; for the power of binding and loosing, if not .iden- tical with the power of the keys, is evi-: dently annexed to and forms part and parcel of .it, as is obvious from the pas sage in Matt; - xvi. 19 ; and ! will also inci dental ly be illustrated by what we have to say on the power of remitting rind retain-:, ing sins. What, then, does our Lord mean in John xx. 23, when he says— ; " Whosoever sins ye remit they .are remitted, and whosoever sins ye retain they are retained ?" In the life of St. Basil a certairi lady is; introduced, and represented as coming to that holy father, for obtaining remissiori. of ber sins; but St. Basil, instead of; claiming the power of remitting. sins, replied to her, by asking this question of ber — " Hast thou, heard, O woman; -that none can forgive sins but God alone'?" To which she answered—" I have heard it, Father; arid' therefore have I moved thee to make intercession unto our most merciful God for me." St. Basil was too devout and too hurn- ble to arrogate to himself that which'rie- longed to ,God, well' knowing that God has never communicated, and never will communicate' to- any creature, the power that ' belongs to' himself 1 as the Creator, " who will not give his glory unto 'ririb- tlier."— Isaiah klviii. 11. St. Gregory the Great taught the same doctrine in his exposition of the 2nd peni tential psalm,, when he thus paraphrases the words of David — "Thou who alorie sparest, ivho alone forgivest sins i For 'who can forgive sins hut' (t od alone ?" ' " " So" likewise Irenreus tells us that our Lord, in forgiving the sins of the man whom he cured of the palsy (Mark ii., 7, Luke, v. 21), did manifestly discover who he' was. "For if none,", said he, " can forgive sins but God alone, and vour Lord did forgive them, and cured men, -it is manifest that he was the Word of God made the Son of Man; - and that, as mail, he is touched with compassion of us;vas God, he hath mercy - on us, and forgiveth us our debts, which we do owe unto 1 God our master." It would be easy - to multiply ifrom the ancient Fathers authorities on this almost self- evident proposition. Tertullian, St. Hilary, St. Ambrose, St. Jerome,! -St. Chrysostom, St. Cyril, St. Augustine; St. Athanasius, all assert the same thing. We. shall be satisfied'; with St.- Cyril, who says— " For; indeed, it belongeth to -the true God alone > to i be able to loose - men from their sins ; for who else can free the transgressors -of ' the law ifrom sin but he who ii thehuthor nfthe iaw ikseli.?" : What; :theri; -must be the meariing of our Lord when- he told his apostles, that whatsoever ' they should - bind ori erirth sliquM .be. bound in heaven, and wbatsq eyjer. .they, should loose on earth should be., loosed in heaven ?" c Many and divers, indeed, have been: the explanations given by eminent theolo- > giand or the Church of Rome (to say : nothing, at present, of the Church of England) upon this important matter. yiT.e,; for the present, shall content our-i selves with a single authority— that of the.< celebrated Peter Lombard, Bishop of . Paris: in the 12th century (who died a.d! 1164), known familiarly among scholastics as " the Master of the Sen tences" ' from his learned collection, of sentences, and passages, drawn from the Bathers, illustrating the doctrines of the, church, forming such a complete body of divinity, and treated as a work of such! authority, that no less than 244 ,ofthe most , learned doctors are numbered by the AbbAEieury among the commenta tors upon it. After enumerating the opinions of , the Bathers upon this point, this matter, in his 4th book, .thus sums up, the, matter :—" ln this so great variety, of opinions (300 years, be it remembered, before 'the birth of Luther), what is to be held? Surely, this we may say and think, that G\od alone doth forgive and retain sins, and yet hath given power of binding .and loosing to the church but. Tie hindeth and looseth one way, and the church another , For he only, himself for- giveth sin; who both cleansetho the soul from inward blot, and looseth it from the' debt of everlasting death. But this hath he not granted unto priests; to' whorii; riot-/! withstanding, he hath given the' power, of. binding and loosingthat is to sayj'of de-, clqring.j .men'.,, to; be, bound, anid loosed// Whereuppn the.iLord did :first ,by himself ! restore: health, to', the leper, and' then sent him; to the priests;1 by whose' judgment he might be declared to be cleansed." / So also' He .offered , Lazarus ,to his' disciples, to' b A lopi0jh'dmigr0guidlcened hini.". Cardi-, nal 'liugo' adds this further; explanation— ",That the priest cannot, bind .or .loose the sinner iwith or (from the bond. of the ' fault and the; punishment due to it ; but only declares; 'him- to-be 'bori'nd; or' loose'd. As tnei JUjevitical priest did not make nor cleanse, the leper, .,bt'-.dipy,!4ecldiHim' to be infectediordlean."'

A/Whatever the . power of the /priest may be, 'nit. surely is not ; an arbitrary or un- conditional power— of binding1 those who ought Hot to be bound, or of loosing those who 1 ought ' not to be. loosed : ' whatever the power or.! the limits /may. .be,; 'it; 'is plainly, a. , conditional . one, /and ,,the con dition is, that the; judgment .must beMsi i-f the. church absolves where she ought not, the sinner can derive no benefit1 from such absolution— if the church condemns where she ought not, the "injured victiM canhpt- be thereby condemned in heaven. Is this Protestant heresy Nay, but sound , Catholic jdivinity. ...The great (St! Augustine says— "...Thpui .hastr begun-/ to esteemsth'y brother "as a- publican ; thou bindest 'him! pn earth. But look1 that' thou bindest hiM1. justly1; fpitf 'unjust 'bonds yhsiicisfshall1 break;" '/'Mdldhnhtus1 lays it piyn cor r e'ctly /that.wheri.' typ, priest saith; I ! /absolve!, , thee,"/ he , means, no . more thereby ,but, '"As much/asinimeji.eth, I absolve ithee." . Andithe/i sarnie.' Master, of the /S'enfeiicesPeteriLombard; pronounces thus " God doth mot 1 evermore ( follow the judgment of. the church,' 1 wfiibli some times judges; by, mistake(aiid ign'ofancei; whereas God always. judges ' according, to the truth." /So , the. priests-,, sometimes declare men .to belo.osedi or, bound, who are not: so by G-od. ; . .With .the penalty of satisfaction' ; or . - . excommunication1 they sometimes bind such as: are unworthy, -or loose them; they admit them that be un worthy to the sacraments; and put back 'them ihat. are worthy to be .. admitted. But it must be understood of them whose merits require that, they should/be, loosed .or bound ; for then is the sentence of the priest 1 approved and confirmed ' by1 the j udgment of God and' the ' whole court of heaven, when it doth proceed with 'that discretion ' that the merits; of them ' who are dealt with do no't'cbhtfadict the same. "W homsoever, therefore, they do loose or bind, using the/ key of discretion accord ing to the party's merits, .they are loosed or bound in heaven — that is, with God ; betaus'e,1 the,' sentence of the priest; pro ceeding in' this manner, .is. apprpved and,| confirmed,by /Divine judgment " To think, therefore, that it.lietli in.thej power-.of any priest truly to .absolve a man from, his sins, ' without'' im-' plying the1 condition of his believing and repenting as he ought to do', is both pre? stimptipn and madness in the highest' degree— nearly all, theologians agreeing that the power of binding , and /loosing committed to the ministers of the church, is not absolute, but limited by the.clause, Olave non errante, meaning that it is only of force when the matter is judged with right judgment,' and, no 'error is committed in the use of the ' keys., . . , ' ' / / We think we , have now arrived at the, stage of our argument, when it will not be very difficult to give a : satisfactory- elucidation of what our Saviour .means1 by the keys of the kingdom of heaven;! which ; has been supposed to convey so vast and3 mysterious a power to /the , Christian priesthood by those whose aim' is to exalt ; it to an almost superhuman dignity. , We may first remark, that .the expres sion is plainly a figurative one; and there fore much less absolute in its expression- than the' one of remitting and retaining . sins, which we have already shown,, upon : such high .Roman, Oatholic.Yutfipiityis'' riot to be'-! construed, absolutely, ,fiut. in / a , limited and conditional sense, different ,iir the/power of God.in judging tor /forgiving the sinner.'

One man alone is primarily respon sible for all this, and that is Mr. Gladstone, who, against the wishes of the Protestant people of England, appointed Lord Ripon, a pervert to Rome, as Viceroy of our Indian Empire. Odd Statistics.— We find in a Wes- leyan contemporary : — " Now in looking at the tables of statistics published, and referred to by the Rev. Arthur Edwards at the Con ference, we see that the various Methodist bodies added together number 4; 795, 116 members. Of this number there are 32,172 'ministers and 84,453 local preachers; 4,480, 634 Sabbath scholars, taught by 577,542 teachers;" " That is' out of 4,795;116 members there appear to be only 314,482 who are not Sabbath scholars. A Craven Apology.— The terror ism exercised by the practice of Boycotting is illustrated by the following apology, which, according to the Dublin correspondent of the Times , is printed' and posted in Baltinglass, county Wieklow : — Baltinglass Land Lea-' gue. An Apology. . I,' Anthony Dwyer, of Ballinacraw, am exceedingly sorry for having- earned Boycotting. ' Ihave suffered consider ably by it,' and ask to be forgiven, and will be good in future. I have asked Mr. O'Toole to mblisli this placard.— Anthony Dwyer, Bal- inacraw."' The Daily Express states- that copies of the' placard were sent by post to many residents.1 The offence for which Dwyer,- who is a farmer, has made the apology is his having sent a mowing machine to cut some meadows of Mr. Ranson, who -is' Boycotted. Chinese Ingenuity.— Chinese acuteness in trade has, according to the Fou- chow Herald, received a fresh illustration recently. Large quantities of matches are purchased in Hong-Kong for re-export to the; coast ports. These matches upon coming into the hands of the Chinese trader undergo a strange transformation. Empty boxes are counterfeited in great numbers, the material and labels coming from Europe, and are filled in the following manner. The original pack ages of matches are opened, the contents of each box are tnken out, and the boxes are then refilled, but not in the original manner. The method employed in filling the boxes is to lay two matches across each other in the . form of an X at the bottom of the box ; then a few matches are loosely placed in regular order upon these two crossed matches ; an other X is then formed, and the box is then filled. An average box of matches contains about sixty matches ; but, undergoing the above process of re- packing, that number is reduced by one- third ; and every gross of matches thus sold affords a profit of six dozen boxes, or 50 per cent. The true meaning of ex luce lucellum seems to be better understood by the Chinese than it was by Lord Sher- brooke. Lord Beaconsfield as a Poet. —Mrs. Riches, of Cardiff, has sent to the South Wales Daily News the facts of the in cidents under which the "Yeomen of Bucks" was written by Lord' Beaconsfield : The words of this song were /giving to' me. in 1839 by Miss Disraeli, the. only sister of the Earl of Beaconsfield, to whom he was devotedly at tached,' and' who waB regarded by him as one of the most' true and gifted of women. During a visit to Bradenham (which: was then the picturesque residence of Mr. I. DTsraeli), Mrs. Wyndham - Lewis tried to persuade Mr. B. Disraeli to write a book, to occupy his idle hours, which were then many, as he spent the greater' part of each day wrapped in a fur rug, with a hot bottle to his feet, smoking and reading. No persuasion was sufficient to induce him to face the cold wind and go for a walk. Eventually he promised that if we would go into the billiard- room and sing some of our duets to, as he said, inspire liim, i he . would endeavour to gratify her wish and write a tragedy. We were so occupied for some'time, and upon re; turning to him he read to us the commence ment of "The Tragedy of; Count .Alarcos." "Wo repeated'the serenade day by day, " The Yeomen of Bucks" being . one of the- most -popular songs in our Repertoire, which1 sug gested to him the 'passage— ii: ; " 'Tia: music sweeter to a spouse's ear -'-' . o. \- Than 'gallants dream of.
