POETRY. TAB HAUNTED HOUSE. The house was haunted. All who saw The frequent sign, "To let," said so, And families did often withdraw Their goods and chattels. That I know. And yet it seemed if awe bereft, A spo? which ghosts might not invade, So when the final tenant left, I flatly came to him and said: "My friend, you seem with care oppressed, And moving ia a last resort, Do goblins here disturb your rest? Is this a haunted house, in short?" He saidâ€”and as he spoke he frowned; "You've guessed it. That's the bother here, We're haunted by a plaguy sound, That splits the head and frights the ear. I've hunted up this phantom dire, I understand the horrid din, One neighbor's just got in the choir; The other's learned the violin."
