Have you ever seen a ghost 1 Such, in simple words, is the extremely interest ing question addressed by the Society of Psych.cal Research to some 17,000 persons, male and female. The results are included in "A report on the Census of Hallucinations," published in the latest edition of the proceedings of the society. The question, of course, was framed in much more elegant and detailed form than the somewhat abrupt inquiry into which most people will translate it; but whether we call " the spook " a " liv ing being," or " inanimate object," or " a mysterious voice," it comes to pretty much the same thing, so long as there is no external physical cause to account for the phenomenon. And now for the results. Out of the 17,000 persons interrogated, 15.316 answered in the negative, leaving only a meagre nine per cent. of people who had been favoured by extraordinary experiences. This is at least consolatory for those who still believe in the sanity of the human race. But the relative proportion of men and women who saw visions and dreamed dreams is still more remarkable. Only 655 males answered in the affirmative, but as many as 10209 females. And yet there are some people who get angry if it be asserted that women are more credulous and hysterical than men. Clearly there is some work for the " New Woman" to do in the conversion of her neurotic sisters. ] ~ ~ a - i?iasa ~uaa wma a
