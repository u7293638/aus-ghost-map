% -# ragmen! Midnight slumbers o'er the world, I'm watching by the river-side, Gazing upon ite moonlit ripples, Thinking of joys for ever past. Memorv is basv with days of vore. Of happy days that may not come again, Of joyous hopes — wither'd, decayed, and dead, And burled in oblivion's mouldering- caves. Still trembling heart! why tlius wildly beating ? No greater sorrow now can reach thee, than that pass'd by, Dost thou imagine a brighter cbance before thee, A clearer course, an easier gnal, or rest ? Pe±ee, peace, thou canst not know the folly, Of hoping against the uncertainty of hope ; Thine is mere childishness — 'tis worse, 'Tis more like maniacs fooling. I thought thee braver, better, nobler, J?hat sorrow had sanctified its depths, ?Bat now I find thee puling like a sickly child, Ready to yield the ghost to fancy, or Any other airy nothing that comes by, Fright thee from the path thoa'dst tread. Shame, shame upon thee ! better to strive and live, To fight with Destiny, and conquer Fate ; Why throb as tho' thou'dst leave thine earthly casing. To fly thou knowest not whither, and then To mournfully wail, and droop, and die. Lire bravely on, and fearlessly await ?whate'er betides thee, Dream not of giving up in Life's rough race, Till fairly ran to earth, and crashed, Beneath an o'erwhelming load of sorrow. Hold high, thine head while life shall last, Nor give one vantage inch to trouble, Let not a single foot be gained, or soon Roads will be taken, then more, and more Will follow, till thou art beaten down, And must forsooth give up the ghost, And launch thee on that bourne From whence no traveller returns. So ends my reverie. The moon has hid Her face behind a dappl'd cloud, And wond'rous flittang beauties o'er the river glancing Lead my thoughts back again, To brighter fancies, purer hopes, aye ! E'en beyond all time, to immortality itself. W.F.C.J.
