BRANCHES FROM THE MAIL TO If TUS ACROSS THE LEBANON". Passing out from Damascus, our course lies from its hills over another range Bennetto where we cross the pleasant valley of the Lebanon to its equally pleasant mountains in the distance The very name has given one as it were a preconceived respect for it Lebanon is nowhere named but in terms that extol it from Solomon a Song back a la and forwards through the Scriptures Its cedars its Hocks, gardens, and vintage, its grateful verdure and the fairness of its snow topped mountains, now so distinctly per ceptible, all crowd upon one s morning The hills that we now descend are called Anti Lebanon, that finish at their south end in the peak Mount Hermon The Valley beneath is but a few miles across, but the stretch over Lebanon's mountains beyond it reaches for nearly a hundred toilsome miles, and that increased by their intricacies, until they run down to the shores of the Mediterranean They are a similar mass of hills to the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, but far less rugged in scenery, mostly under cultivation, and filled to their full length and the breadth mentioned with pleasant little v villages These but for religious differences, might be thought to be, in their great healthiness and specially pretty locations, the most desirable of homes in which to rest and be happy They are in fact the very reverse of that picture The natural scenery all around is so attractive that we disregard miniature rains here and there towards which Hassan points, and to which he gives some unpronounceable Arab names In a land so scattered over with remains of bygone days as is Syria, the great landmarks only of which one has heard, and which we read of and remember as we run the world s course along, can be noticed for that reason we think it unnecessary to leave the pleasant valley that we are traversing, and to turn to a visit Abtla, to which the tomb of Abel the first has given a name Having seen Adams tomb at Jerusalem, this one of the second of his large family seemed to have small attraction indeed 'N e had been looking lately at too many of the tombs of the great Adamite race Hassan suspects our faith, and we have to assure him of our orthodox " Perhaps you don't believe that it is the tomb of Abel ' he says, but is comforted as much as words can make him that our lack of curiosity heB in our feeling of satisfaction Tennyson speaks of some adorable being as one who " does not seek to understand she only loves ' That happy condition, substituting belief for love, we desire our dragoman to consider as being ours-the fitting state of feeling for travellers in this the "Land of Promise' part of Syria On our road to it we diverge a little to pass through the Lebanon village of athletes perfect town for its size, with nine or ten thousand of inhabitants I thought it looked too clean, busy, and civilised for a Mahomedan place, and so was quite prepared to find that its people were all Christians of the Greek church The town is built in terraces around a perfect amphitheatre that gives a fine Men of it, and enlarges its size and good appearance to the surprised eyes of the traveller A rushing stream, dignified as a river, comes down through it from the Lebanon range above A one eyed maiden at an hotel here talked broken English home, and, what was as well. or better, gave me of the best of Lebanon wine On inquiring how this Polyphemea came to be so optically damaged, the sad story was again told-the fine town had been sacked by the Druses of the mountains, helped by the Mahomedans, in that fearful 1869 Though its people made a good resistance, much murder and massacre ensued, which, with significant looks, I was told would not occur again Zahleh is such a lively, pretty, and shining place that one needs must wish it well, and free from damaging, desolating Turkish dominion It is, as a part of Lebanon, under special protection now, but its people deserve to dwell in a safer land than is S J ria On the road to Tables v e were again in vited to go out of the way and this time to see the tomb of Noah . As an additional attraction, it is, I am told, between one and two hundred feet long, from which one is left to judge of the height of its occupant when alive After mature deliberation of about terminates, we consider it better to show the same disposition towards Noah's tomb that we had done to Abels, and so pass on- wards All know that we shall feel re- forceful about it afterwards, but life is so full of regrets that such additions as these don't much encumber Along the valley of the Lebanon runs rivers of immortal names, fed by mountain springs from either side. The Orontes rising in the Lebanon range at the foot of its loftiest peak, runs thence to the sea at Antioch Hereabout also is the source of the Litany, a name not usually connected in thought with a river, which runs hence south we are for fifty miles away down to the port of old Tyre None of these mountain born streams-the Jordan, the Orontes, the Litany, or the Abana, that are in magill under the order written-are of navigable nature Lebanon gets its name from the whiteness of the chalky stone of which its terraced Hides show so much Among its woods and willow groves, its olive and mulberry plantations, its vineyards, orchards cornfields, and beehives, there is, spite of three hundred or more of v villages scattered among its slopes, an utter solitude that the notes of birds can hardly be said to disturb These Delectable Mountains are inhabited nearly wholly by two sects-the Druses and the Maronites who are strange folk in their ways, and not comfortable neighbours to each other or to any other of mankind The origin of these Druses and Maronites is as little known as that of the Gipsies, and they are similarly equally clannish I pick up some particulars about them now and again The Druzes have many points of belief with the Buddhists holding the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, and carrying its existence backward for all time as well as for all to all eternity Similarly to Buddha's disciples, they believe also in the transmigration of souls as a means of reward or punishment, and a subsequent absorption into nature itself as a final rest Like Buddhists they abjure the luxuries of life, and dress plainly, believe in labour, drink no wine or spirit, neither smoke nor swear, and hold it as sinful to he to make up for such self-denial they periodical indulge in murder As such is done for religious reasons, it bears of course, another name, and we know what difference the name makes to many things It is noticeable of what great length in the Lebanon ranges ride of days over its in- tricacies from here to either end of it Its great breadth we shall realise fully as we cross it as remarkable as its large area is its good land and the excellent uses to which it is mostly put Before we begin the ascent of its side, we come upon the camping ground of Sthorer or Shcturah.'and here find a welcome was side hostelry kept by an Italian He has for the good of travellers established here about three wooden house buildings, well supplied with attendants, who seem all to be of the gentler sex, and of European coin plexionB A traveller not in a hurry might stay here very well for many days and make pleasant raids upon the surrounding country, all of which is haunted ground What is not filled with Scriptural and historical records is so with the ghosts of those who have thereabout been murdered. To other accommodations supplied at Sheturab, roomy Btablmg is added, with horses that are good enough for the country, though they look almost as cursed A pretty mountain stream runs through the garden grounds attached to this guest house, ( in which, while creature comforts are getting ready, we get the luxury of a cold bath that is equal in another but as pleasant a way, to the Turkish one got to Damascus In an hour or two Bta) at rhetoric we established ourselves so comfortable) about its ears) quarters that we were in no hurry to relate the wine of the Lebanon was good, the Turkish tobacco avis mild, and the mountain rule of the morning had Rivoli us that good digestion that watts alwayS on a well earned appetite There is something invigorating about mountain air that tal c3 away merinos and blues makes the liver active and life all love) My American friends are however, each of that kind whom their popular poet has so well sketched in Excelsior I want to stay) hereabout for another day, and take horses and go and see two or three spots that an) Italian host tells me of in his half broken English Not so in Transatlantic brethren ' J he mountains he before them and their cr) in 1 or w and All the maidens that are about speak, unfortunately, with foreign tongues, which perhaps somewhat takes from the pleasure of their society They would, I fear, speak without effect, bow even, had they been able as eloquently to urge those reasons for staying that equally failed with Longfellow 8 hero His short ness of the star has made it all the pleasanter, and we leave it with those thoughts that compare time spent at such places to the longer day of life itself Some only breakfast and away Otl ers to dine and are well fed The oldest man but sups and toes to bed Larger his bill who sta) s throughout the day), Who goes the soonest has the least to pay On our way up the mountains it is very soon perceptible here as elsewhere that mountaineers are on the whole a superior people to the Lowlanders The climate makes the man, as we had seen sufficiently in the wretched beings dwelling in the a valley of the Jordan as compared with the hill top residents of Bethlehem Those people that we now see about us are as improved in appearance as is their land.

The mulberry tree div idea attention with the olive both with the villagers and the traveller The silk wheels are not, however, was much use here as formerly), much of the silk, Hassan tells us, being now sold in the unspun or cocoon state As village after village is passed and their inhabitants spoken of, I see further evidence that all Lebanon is either Maronite or Druze in character. The Druzes are the Circassians of St na, in the matter of independence Here in the Lebanon the) have ever been as turbulent as Highlanders formerly proved them selves The Turks have had therefore to make terms with those whom they could not crush I wait while a procession of these people pass along which I learn is nothing less than a Druze vv edding part) The women are v veiled, and the evil depends from a project ing horn of unicorn shape worn as a head dress That ornament is the " tumour, and is some fifteen inches in length. It is worn in perpendicular, angular, and bon frontal positions These denote the mother, the married woman or the maid The birth of the prophet Samuel as we read in the second chapter of his First Book caused his mother to say that her horn was exalted, b) which expressions the honour attaching to the perpendicular position 13 the better under stood The fashion will not be out of good taste if it should come into more general use, as it likely will some day) Something of the sort has been felt as a want by many, who are not too tall and the " candour really lends a dignity to its wearer I see these mountain maidens afterwards unveiled, and notice that the fresh air of the bills haggis on them both grace and good looks in the ancient custom that some of them in dulge of wearing a string of coma on their brows is to be seen what may be the origin of the odious modern western fashion of disguising the forehead by combing the hair over it The coins here worn seem to show well in relief to the olive complexions of their wearers but the pull of a fringe of shortly clipped hair over the brow, and so hiding the noblest part of the face can only he an imitation of the drunken state of which it used to be the distinguishing stage mark, or mar us of likening the face to that of the workers who are spoken of bl Shakspeare in "The Tempest as with foreheads vii famous low The originator of the Druze faith was one Hakim, who declared himself a prophet, but was said to be a madman There always has been an allegation of that sort about prophets by those who rejected their doctrines The chief distinguishing feature of the faith of the Druzes appears to be the desire for concealment of its points and principles Other prophets have said Go forth into the world, preach, publish, and converts But Hakim seems to have said " Keep it dark ' as one who thought to add the attraction of a kind of freemasonry mystery to the other mysteries of the Druze faith Their places of worship are as strictly "tiled as is an Masonic lodge room The Druzes ignoring Mahomet substitute as their prophet tins Hakim, whom they believe e will return to earth as the Messiah there to reign and to make their faith the mineral one Though they take no means to spread this faith, they have a Mahomedan dislike to those of other belief If they don't carry their gospel to those of other creeds at the swords point, as the Turks do, them more unfairly use that weapon of war to exterminate unbelievers by assassination The Maronites are between one and two hundred thousand in number, and call their high priest the Patriarch of Antioch He resides on the mountains here in the Monastery of Canobm as head quarters, and there acknowledges Papal supremacy, and furnishes periodical reports to Rome The bishops and all the clergy of this sect are said to live principally by pastoral labour in its temporal sense Some twenty thousand of their number in religious houses amongthehills here, and regard St

better 111 civilisation than are the Bedouins, but are governed by sheiks and a feudal system and its customs, one of which is the adoption of a vendetta hatred, that like the Corsican one, hands down unsatisfied vengeance as a heirloom These agreeable people of the mountains began among themselves the massacre of 1860, in which the Maronites suffered mostly The victorious Druzes were then joined by the Mahomedans, and the Christians of all kinds were included with the Maronites in the slaughter that ensued The Druzes fled from the vengeance of the French troops that came as avengers, and left the Mahomedans to pay all the fearful score The end of it was that in 1894 the Lebanon territory was divided into seven districts under the supervision of one Daoud Pasha, an Armenian Christian, who has hitherto succeeded in preventing further bloodshed Account is given to me as each village is passed in this Lebanon of what occurred in it in that frightful 1800 I look at the smiling little places nestling there among the plea sant mountains, like to babes in a mother's arms, only to hear how mate were murdered there A strange piece of intelligence that, and as out of place in the scene around as was the speech of one who at a wedding breakfast knew a wet blanket over the joyous party by reminding them that they had all to die " W India the name, nassau, of that village yonder the white looking one-there, seen through the trees' "lliatissoniul so (a three syllables name) Three hundred were massacred there in 1860' "Will, that must have been the whole village men, women, and

Oh j ea The 1 tench soldiers came first, the Trench being the protectors of the Catholics in Syria, and then the English. The latter came in the man of war that yet remains as guardship in the harbour down at Beyrout My brother was with them for more than a year chasing and killing the murderers I think that he accounted for nineteen '" Nineteen to one gun was not bad for mountain sport as taken by an amateur volunteer like Hassan's brother The Turkish soldiers, who should have protected the murdered ones, joined the fanatics, and either helped in the Huguenot like massacre, or looked on at it The Jewish population were helpless in the matter The Turkish gov ernors the Pasha's of Damascus and Lebanon-broke all faith with those whom they were bound by their position to shelter and succour One of these governing scoundrels, named Osman Bey was afterwards hunted from his stronghold by British troops, and shot at eight, as such a miscreant deserved to be "A nice country has to be in May the like of that break out again, Hassan a ' "Yes, when the English and French men-of-war are taken away from the harbour over there at Bej rout They are all that really keep the Mahomedans and Druzes now quiet This Lebanon, though now taken from Turkish rule and placed under a Christian guardian, would be in nothing better off if the armed ships go away " So England stuffs the Turks with her loaned money, and supports them with her armies and navies, and yet has to keep a man-of-war in the harbour of their Beyrout to save the Christian population from murder " Go abroad," said the Swedish Minister, Oxen stairs, to his son, " and see with how little wisdom the world is governed ' ' It spoke well for the Government of Sweden that it should be thought necessary to travel to see image ernment Other communities may be apt to think that such is perceptible quite near enough to home, and that distance lends no enchantment to the view of it in any shape. Hassan explains that the Turks are sore at loss of revenue through the government of Lebanon being taken from them. Under its present rule those that w eil hereareonlj taxed half as much as they were previously The man j millions upon millions that the Turks have cajoled from British pockets may, however, count very well against this loss of plunder " Are those men of war likely to leave Bej rout harbour, Hassan ' We don't feel at all comfortable in this place ' ' "Oh no They must never leave there while Turkey) has this country) If they do so a good warning must be first given, that all of us may leave with them ' Our drama man, though of Arab birth, was a sort of Christianised being, and along with his red handed brother, would be marked men in the next Druse and Mahomedan massacre The land we journey over is that of which Moses spoke in the third chapter of Deuteronomy, "pray thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, the goodly mountain and Lebanon The "goodly mountain was probably Hermon, the immense conical shaped mount of some ten thousand feet high, which is the crown of he Anti Lebanon on the other side of the valley we had crossed earlier in the morning Eternal Snows cover it as with a silver crown, that which melts lower down a helping to form the Pharpar River, running thence towards Damascus Its summit is the highest point in Syria next to a part of that Lebanon range that we are now crossing towards On the higher part of this grows the largest of the clumps of cedars that are yet to be found here, though other patches of them are to be seen about elsewhere on the heights " The trees of the Lord the cedars of Lebanon which He hath planted ' ' With that declaration from the 14th Psalm ringing in our ears, we look with infinite respect on these Bible trees Isaiah alone, in his second chapter, names one tree in the same breath with them ' ' All the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and all the oaks of Bashan The debate among the trees, when they assembled to choose a king, as reported in the 9th chapter of Judges, closes with these cedars' name, and what the bramble said about them when addressed by all the trees, " Come thou and reign over us 1 Solomon, who made most use of them, sings of them often in his Song, as thus in the 9th chapter -"Aa pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars ' No material but their wood served for his gold adorned chariot or for that famous temple of his We read in the Chronicles, 2nd book and chapter, how he set about the building of it, and told out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred as overseers , also how he made terms with Huram, King of Tyre, for the cedar trees, fir trees, and again trees out of Lebanon,' which we read in the 15th v craze were to be as much as needed, and to be brought by Huram on floats to Jopp i, whence Solomon was to take them to Jerusalem We can guess, from having gone over that journey all unencumbered, what trouble he must have had with that timber ' We read in the fifth chapter of the first of Kings that these mountains were the country quarters of that levy of thirty thousand that Solomon and Hiram points) raised " out of all Israel " These now sparsely timbered hillsides were well wooded then, of which scrip turalevidence is great, to quote only Isaiah in his 41st chapter in allusion to the great- ness of a sacrifice that the prophet there speaks of-" And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering ' As we gaze upon a clump of these trees grow rag on one of their high retreats, a large bird of the condor kind is seen to be wheel- ing above them strangely, reminding one of my friends of what he read at Sheturah that morning in Ezekiel's 17th chapter, " A great eagle with great wings, long-winged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedars " Anything in their praise seems appropriate from the lonely grandeur of those solitary heights that these cedars secret so to seek The 42nd Psalm likens them to right doers, " who shall flourish like the palm trees, and grow as a cedar in Lebanon. ' But we fail to imagine any likeness of Behemoth drawn from Job's imagery in his 40th chapter that such animal moves his tail like a cedar." stateliness and stillness seem of their chief characteristics ' These famous biblical trees grow at greater heights, we are told, than any other It is probable that this aspiring character and heavenward cleaving has helped them to a respect like that given to the lark which at heaven's gate sings The Turks' rule has caused their clearance off the face of the earth, as it has done with every good thing that should grace it The cedars of Lebanon that remain seem to have retreated upwards as far as they can go out of the age of man their destroyer It can hardly be, though it looks like it, that they are naturally disappearing from amongst us as have done so many of the created things of the older world. By the excellent evidence of a walking stick out from one of the trees the cellars of these mountains are of a vi bite wood, and not of the colour we usually connect with the name and its lead pencil associations In the largest clump of the ii to which allusion has been madeasortof chapel has been built and some semi Druidical grove worship, as we are told takes place there at one time of the year and of cedar celebration It is not supposed that such attention does the trees an) good At their heights the air is cold, and much of that which it is intended to honour is built for warmth sake As the trees are the sole attraction there, the so using them is as living upon one s capital If Lebanon recalls the Blue Mountains of Australia to the traveller it also brings to his mind the appearance of the Apennines as he approaches them from 1 eggs on his road to Is apples That mountain range of the Italian peninsula is, however, beautiful in a far lesser degree than the prolific land of Lebanon, which gives forth a generous full- ness of all that the heart of man can desire in mountain scenery, or hope to enjoy in mountaineer life The Lebanon hills occupy a happy midway position between the uncut try ated wildness of the Australian range referred to, and that of the less loft) and more sterile mountains of Hall) The views from some of the heights and at the different turns and windings of the way were of all orders of beauty the sublime, the picturesque, the fantastic, and the simply pretty These greatly protracted progress, so difficult was it to get away from what fixed attention, and led to drawing others into the same way of regarding it, and comparing thoughts on the subject As in reading Shakspeare each one thinks that he sees meanings and beauties that others overlook so here we each became something of both the artist and the poet in our special ways of regarding the delightful scenery A pleasant time of it might be found in these mountains for the summer months by a friend]) pair seeking health, recreation, and a change from European life Companionship would be essential, as the sole company of a local guide is of a wearisome nature, to give it no worse name There is a recruiting power in the air of these hills that was dis- tinct]) appreciable after our two days only upon them To have gone a tour of the endless v lUages which they enfield, and to have traversed their length, as we did their breadth, would have made good mountaineers of us ere the journey ended The length and breadth does not include heights and depths, which are again other features that would protract time spent on the Lebanon As a souvenir of pleasant Lebanon I would bring away a bottle of good wine if I thought it possible to keep it in place of that I bring away two of the fine cones of the cedars, large as the eggs of the ostriches emu They are bulky to carry, and occupy) much space in a bag, but their value in a distant land will be worth the trouble taken It will not be wasted carriage if I can grow in the new world these specialities of the older one-if in the land of the Southern Cross can be reared the distinguishing tree of the Land of the Cross and Curse
