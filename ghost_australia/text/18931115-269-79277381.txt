Then there was a silence; we remembered there was a door at the bottom of the staircase-not that we had ever opened it; it seemed to lead into some cellar-and Norah sprang forward and bolted the door of our room-instead of opening it to see what wasthere, like a little coward that die waa! I, for one, wee no bolder. We both were shivering as we had never shivered on the coldest winter night, and our teeth chattered like castanets.

Next day it was determined that every thing should ^ .done to dear up the mystery of our nightly disturbance and before datkall oar arrangements were made. Dick and Walter again examined the em«iy room at the end of the passage, and locked the door, and Dick put the key in hie pocket. They sounded the walls, they sounded the floor of the passage, and had a lamp put on a shelf jusfc over the door of the empty room. A number of candles we: to our room and lit, until the chimney piece looked like the altar of a tomato Catholic church. Walter had secured an old stable lantern which he he thought would stand tibe breeze better than our host of candles. Dick and Eveline, who intended to share our vigil, had a brilliant idea; it to have supper spread-and a good one too-in our room, so that we should have something to do besides sitting oppo site each other and solemnly staring into each other's faces. A little Dutch oou also suggested as an addition. Ur promised not to faint, on condition she was given none of it. Dick and Eveline, who came fresh to the soene of our terrors, and whose nerves were not shattered by the re-" pafcifcion of two such nights as oars, were gay enough at tnt^ while Ursula too, who had contrived to be in such a faint the night before as to hear nothing, was quite herself again. But at half-past eleven, we had finished eating-Walter had ended all his stories-Norah couldn't sit still-there were pauses, broken only by laboured remarks from ono or other of ub about anything but the subject in hand-the only one in which anybody was really interested- Bat I re member Dick saying to Waiter, ' I think you are quite over-doing this lighting-op business, it will frighten those rascals and they will lie by to-night and we shall be no 'He evidently thought that it was a case of theives or moonlighters, and I noticed a -ie volver sticking oat of his pocket, and I fancy Walter had one, too. * As midnight dxew nearer we were all absolutely silent. There was the faint sound of tike water washing against the little land ing stage by the ItUce-side, and the fall of the embers in the fire-nothing else. The night was extremely still and very dark. The birch boughs that grew dose op too, and touched our windows, did not wmfcy die slightest stir against the panes of glass, ao there would be positively nothing to account for the rushing wind in the passage, if it should come again. * At last it begun to strike twelve. Walter took up his lantern in one hand, a nd his revolver in the other, and stood, his hand on the lafteh, ready to throw open the door at the slightest sound- He waved his hand to keep us all back, but It was curiosity' I am fraid, not courage, that mmi* as all gatiber round the door, behind him and Dick. * Wine-ten-eleven-twelve-and that dreadful ay! 'Walter opened the door and steeped ont, and the flame of his lantern flickered wildly in die fahist of ice-cold air that swept into the and extinguished eve*y candle but one. It did not go out, however, nad he flashed it down the passage, and we all tanked over his shoulder and saw at the extreme «*»mI of the corridor, what seemed to be a ilwytiwg of the shadow about the door of the onp^ Then to our wonder this shadow to " ground round, a dark shade two or three feet fafck m a mist cloud is wiled, when the west wind ashes and drives it down a river valley. The cries and voices had ceased, and as ^ unaccountable shadow passed along, the floor ing creaked and we heard a hollow sound so exactly like that causal by a great cask or barrel being rolled along that it was impos sible not to believe that we were oetually watching some spdt poshed and turning round and round at it passed. Mot one stirred hand or foot as it came on. We even stood bank, to let it go ly. Slowly creaking over mm to the Madof tt|e staircase, There it stopped for a moment, and then began to twT&awm.; We followed.

Eveiy atone of the flooring was removed, and under one of them a hkrr pine bund of ancient make, was discovered and opened by a few strokes of a hatchet. 4 We girls, looking over the men's shoulders saw that it was empty, except for a whitish substance, and buried among that a bunch of keys and a watch. ' Nothing else! It was explained to us (hat the white substance was quicklime, which wOl destroy any human remains in the shortest possible time. The watch was an old-fashioned tunip watch, such as gentlemen used to wear. The jingling noise we had heard was obviously made by the bunch of keys which were attached to a bulky cluster of valuable seal*. They were at once sent to Dick's uncle. * * , * * ' Dick's uncle proved to be very uncom nuraioattv* in the matter, and it was allowed to drop. But Krolioe, some time after, in a moment of confidence, informed Norah and me that the watchbore the ICarchmont crest and certain initials which made it easily traceable to a member of the family, while among the keyB were two which opened chests in the house where old Marchmont lived. One of these chests had been broken open.and a new key made- the other, then considered of no interest, had been allowed to remain in a deserted lumber room. '' And did they open it ?' I asked. "Yes/ 4' And did they find out anything f '' i hey found papers relating to the owner of the watch.' '' Hiey know his name, then ?' ' Yes," said Eveline, portentously, ' it ap pears he had been foully murdered . . . aad . . . She suddenly grew reticent. ' I am not going to tell you anything more. You are two dreadfully curious little girls, and Dick has particularly forbidden me to re veal family secrets,' * Of a discreditable nature ?' said I, pertly, rudely oiged by my balked curiosity. ' Ereiy family has a skeleton in the cup board,* added Eveline. ' any family of any age and importance, at least.' * A skeleton in a cupboard is a very re spectable thing to have/ 1 retorted, * Very! But yoms is onlya ghost in a tub !* [The Ekd.]
