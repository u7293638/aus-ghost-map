Superstition. IF a Lord Warden dies at the castle, a boatswain's whistle is heard at midnight by its inhabitants. No one asserts that this was recently heard, but more authoritative are the following superstitions: â€” If a Devonshire Oxenham is about to die, a white-breasted bird flutters over the doomed one's head. The Middletons of Yorkshire, as becomes an ancient Roman Catholic house, have a Benedictine nun to warn them of an approaching death. A weeping, mourning spirit warns the Stanleys of a reduction in their number. A hairy-armed girl, called May Mullach, brings the like sad news to the Grants of Grant. The Bodach am dun, or ghosts of the hills, performs the same office for the Grants of Rothie-murcus. The death of an Earl of Airlie is told by the beating of an invisible drum. So respectable a man as Dr. Norman M'Leod lent the weight of his testimony to it. In 1849 Lord Airlie died in London, and the household at Cortacho Castle, his seat in Forfarshire, were thus pre- pared for the news, and when his son died in Colorado the ghostly drummer-boy was heard just before his death. Lady Airlie heard it in her room and was greatly prostrated; but one of the servants first heard it in the corridor. The approaching death of a Bruce is announced by the spectre of a woman in white, who appears to the doomed scion of that ancient and once Royal house.
