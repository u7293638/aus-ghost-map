A CHRISTMAS DAY, AND. WHAT GAME OF IT. Chapter IV. SOME hours hence, Geoffry stood in the Court House at Rushbridge. Mr. Dalton, who had just given his evidence, saw him as he entered, and was startled beyond measure, not only be cause he thought he was lying ill in bed at Woodford, but by the whiteness of his face. He made his way towards him. " Geoffry '" was all he could exclaim. I have come to give evidence in this case," Geoffry stud in a clear voice that all near could hear. Everyone afterwards said how in daunted by he spoke up , but as for himself, he thought he had never felt such an unmitigated coward. He felt a dreadful fear that if he did not speak at once he should be sorely tempted to leave Dee to Ina fate ,_ He had to wait a little, however, and then he was called to give evidence. He went up with a firm tread, and his voice was clear and steady when he spoke The caste nshment was mdc-enbabli» amongst the crowd, for the Court House it is so armed, as it heard Geoffry Temple, generally looked upon as one of the most enviable men found, accuse himself firstly, of being an escaped convict, Geoffry Everitt by name and secondly, of having been the cause of of Mr Ford's death. But the most extraordinary part of the proceeding was, that he strongly declared his entire. inner course of the forgery for which he had been transported, and absence of all guilty intention with regard to Ford's death "As you may imagine," said Geoffry, in con clusion, " it was a great temptation to keep quiet, for I don't think I should ever have been suspected, but that poor wretch pointing to Dee, who could understand very little that was going on" would perhaps have suffered in lustily For my part, I don't greatly who if my story of Ford's death is not credited, because of my former condition, and because of his knowledge of it, for I would as soon d 0 as return to my old life " " What made Mr. Ford suspect you of being a convict p" he was asked. " I cannot tell," he replied. " At least I am not very clear on that point I remember once I unguardedly mentioned B-, and he asked me if I had ever been there, and when I also lost some time ago a Projor book, given me by the chaplain there, in which is written my real name, but I do not know if it ever got into Ford's hands However, there is a letter from him to Superintendent Ripley in his desk, so he told me, and that may say , also it will go to prove what I have stated " When he had finished he was committed for trial, and though Mr Dalton offered it, bail was refused. As to himself, he seemed almost in different as to what became of him On coming out of the Court House, Mr. Dalton was met by Dr. Allen, who rushed up to him in great excitement " What is all this I hear ' ' he cried "I have been away The tell me that my patient, fresh from the jaws of death as it were, his ridden from Woodford and put himself under arrest Is it true" asked he, panting, and wiping the perspiration off his forehead " I am sorry to have to say it is," answered Mr. Dalton a little sternly " He confesses he caused Ford's death on Christmas night, and besides," he added, drawing Dr Allan away from the knots of people who stood talking about the door, " he has been a convict Fancy that I should never have guessed it, and we trusted and liked him so much " "Good gracious'" cried the doctor " He will never be able to prove that Ford was killed by on accident," went on Mr Dalton " He has now witnesses, and his having been a convict is enough to prejudice people against him, even if it were not known that Fold was acquainted with the fact, and meant to expose him, if he had lived " "But his coming forward now," cried the doctor, whose breath was almost taken away with dismay, and who was a staunch friend of Geoffry's, " surely that alone will prove him to be a generous hearted fellow, who would never think of taking aw ly 0 fellow creature's life " " But in a moment of passion-" Mr Dalton began suggesting, but was interrupted by the doctor quite li feel. Mr. Editor' cm it to you talking like that You, of all men, who know the poor fellow best As for me, I'll stick to his innocence through thick and thin " Mr. Dalton felt reproved, but he said gloomily " now can I tell what to think' I wonder "The only won her is, that you don't think more generously of h m," interrupted the testy doctor, "and that the ride from Woodford didn't killing Dr love F he must be made of pluck Lsutcmc it kept him up, of course, but he'll suffer of 1 it I eh 11 go and see him Come along " "No, no, don't ask me," said Mr Dalton, drawing back , " I'm very sorry for him, but but he makes no a little angry too, for hasn't be deceived us for so long '" " And small blame to him. I am not the man to cast a stone at him because he didn't pi0 claim on the housetops that he had been a convict once I am only filled with admiration for his conduct to lay Never heard of abrasion noble thing, in love" Describes the Victoria Cross, by Georges" And the warmhearted doctor rushed away to get admittance to Geoffry, and to cheer him up with the sighted a friendly, trusting face for he was beginning to feel the reaction after the excitement that had supported him. He could only feel " Thank God, I have done it all there is to do now, is to wait j" but waiting, be four d was the hal lest pan of all, and when Dr. Allen came to him he found him lying weak 111 body and desponding in mind, on his pallet. Meantime Mr Dalton went back to his hotel for the night, and next morning started as early as he could (after r<.x¿¡n¡, m ft count of yesterday's proceedings 111 the, russian 1 ije Innes, and swearing inwardly at the outer for introducing his name so often) To the anxious to go home, feeling others might carry,, the bad news before he could get then He did not spare his horses on his way, and was not very long before he arrived at Woodford He had not the courage to tell Bertie himself. He told his wife, and commissioned her to break it to her Ww her mother had told her all as gently as she could, Bertie sat quite still and client for a time, and then, rub the truth in all its fulness by one upon her, she fell to weeping passionate 11, and flinging herself on her knees beside Mrs Dalton, she clasped her hands and declared that she would never believe one word against him. " Oh, mamma'" she cried, " let me go and see him. Oh, my poor Geoffry'" " I cannot let you do that, dear. We will wait patiently until we hear more " What is the good of waiting, she answered passionately, drying her tears "He was ill when he went away He will die there with no one to take care of him, or be kind to him You must let me see him How does papa say he was looking ?" "Your papa," said Mrs Dalton, looking a little confused, "had not time at least he 11 as not able to see him before he came away " "Not see him" Bertie exclaimed, springing up " You don't mean to say papa didn't in, to see him " "don't exactly know," onswoicdhei mother, slightly abashed by the blight, searching eyes "I think he was afraid he would not be the first to get out here " "And he was in Rushbndgo all last evening, and if he had chosen he could have seen him this morning. He thinks him guilty," said Bertie, very calmly, fixing her but ful eyes, but tearless, on her mother's gentle face " He thinks him guilty '" " No Bertie," answered she, he does not do that, but he wants time to think the affair over He-" " And papa left him to fancy we would care for him no more But oh Geoffry council would never believe I would forget, or care for him less, than I always did " Mrs. Dalton was distressed Her husband had cautioned her to let Bertie Geo, without telling her be roughly that she must give Geoffry up She did not know what to say " Of course, darling," she said, putting her arm round the poor child, " if he can prove he is innocent, both in this and in the other affair, as he declares he is, we will let you care for him 09 much as ever, but-" ' But' I know what you are going to say, mamma But my heart is my own, and I can and shall love him wheats " And after this 1111 dut ful speech, Bertie unclasped her mother's arms and stood quite defiantly "Bertie" said her gentle mother, and she came and threw herself on her mother's bosom " Oh ' marama, forgive me ' But I am so wretched Oh tell me you think him rano cent " " I do, I do '" What could Mrs Dalton do then, but kiss and vainly endeavor to win per hope she could not feel herself And Bertie knew she was but noting to console her, and was not comforted What a miserable day that was Bertie scarcely spoke, and looked like the ghost of the Sweet, lively little creature wh0 was always 90 daily They missed the funk smile and cheerful voice of pool Geoffry too and how the dal dragged itself by they could not tell All they knew was that it was the most miserable day or so east at happy Woodford, the children quiet, even Ellie was hushed , (h servants must softly about their work, gossiping under Half breath, hut all filled with compact of for handsome, kind heal tod, quick tempered Geoffry Long as the din was they got through it somehow, but they were Jail when bid thee come, and they departed! to ship if they could, but most of Hiern his awake thinking over the events of the last few days As for Birtii, her sweet eyes never closed, and when morning broke it found her sleepless still She rose, for it was weary lying with nothing to do, and went to her window As she did so she saw Dale, the convict standing at the kitchen door speak- ing to Lizzie "Icllhiuil want to see him at once," she heard him say , and Lizzie ran off to Mr Dalton's room Mr Dalton," she cried, topi ing at his door, "Dale wants to see you, sir " " Tell him to wait," said Mr Dalton rather savagely, for he had only had an hour or so of sleep " " He wants to speak to you, on, very parties luiIv," culled lizzie " Bother the man ' said Mr Dalton I 11 come, ' he shouted, and took his by no dressing., grumbling meanwhile about " uncart 1 2 hours,' and never having any peace " He came out in a few minutes, looking very sleepy "Well, Dale's with a tnuKiilous lawn "Oh So," cried Dale, coming for work and speaking eagerly, "I have almost ing of importance to tell you I only heard the news Last night about Mr Temple has,, given himself up Please, I can give evidence that it Mia by quite an act dent that Mr Lord was killed I was witness of it all " " Thank God'' cried Mr Dalton, with fear For, all his shopmen vouching " Go on, go "I didn't tell this before, went on Dale, " because, ' catching Lizzie a ore and such as, "I was told Mr Temple did me 11 (100 I turn, so I wanted to do him another I knew But if I let on that Mr Temple was by when Mr lord got killed, and people found out what he had been, and how Mr Bent knew it, they would get hips not be 0 thought it was an accident That is, you know, Mr, if I had been the first to tell, but now Mr Temple, 01 1 Everitt I Bitppo e I should say, has blubber 1 on himself, in evidence will help him The do it will," be aided causes "to be sure it will," cure Mr 1) 1! on "Good gi vicious, dill 1 ' as a pale face I, trying hair, but ea" r girl smiled to his side, and s ped her arm through his I have heard all, did Bertie ' Good" "he said to Dale V ' tell us lion you know about Mt temple's past life ' said Mr D Alton Vin!

He had failed, and must abide the consequences of his rashness Mr Dalton went home once during the week to wish his wife and daughter farewell, and to gild them all the news and comfort he could, but there was little enough of the letter, and then he departed from Geoffry was taken to Melbourne to watch his case, and to employ the most eminent barrister to defend him Mrs Dalton and her daughter were going, but at the last moment Mrs Dalton fell ill Her strength sale on under the excitement, and 319 was confined to her bed for several days Bertie, of course, stayed with her, and it was 11 good thing for the poor child to have something to do to Li on her thoughts from dwelling too much on her lover 's deadful situation Her father and mother had never directly told her all must be over be tween Gooflij and herself, but she know that it must be so as for 35 0110 who could not foretell the future, could see She went sadly and heavily about her duties, quite up like the happy Bertie of old, her sweet face clouded, and her blue eye dun Still the gold braid j, trying too cheerful with her mother and kind to the children, but it was a hard battle, and lOmotiuios she thought she must grows, and do would slip away to be alone in her grief iii Dalton had been gone a week They had he said n gularly from him since he had been away Mrs Dalton, who was boiled, and sitting nth Bertie in the drawing room, was brought letter portion of it ten times I do not know how to be thankful enough to be enabled to tell you that poor Giollrj'a case is processing favourably There is very small fear indeed of an unfavorable indeed, but tloiiltornutiio seems almost as dreadful in deed, I think Gooflry, but for the disgrace to 11 j, should not care much how the trial ended " when he went on to tell them they put pillars of the trial Next day no letter came, and the day after that the same. Bertie looked miserable, and made no effort 01011 to be cheerful Mrs Dalton was filled with dismal forebodings also towards the evening, Mrs Ditton and her daughter sat silent, each wrapped in her own sad thoughts, 111 the pretty drawing 100111 The sun was setting in a gorgeous b 11d of red an 1 yellow clouds, and Mrs Dalton died on the soft watching it They had not hope! 111 all day (so ce the milk retail no that they had sent to see if there were letters) ofGoofhj they dared not much know what the wife nee on Mr Dalton's part in any Surely towns bringing the news himself, because he could not see if it gently enough in a letter So they both thought " Lillie, dear," said her mother, taking her hand, " it might not be as bad as we fear " She was the first to be cale silence "Oh mamma, I dare not hope," cried Bettie, Bq feeding her hand and then, spring ing up, the child willis, "Don't speak of it I can not bear it and also climbed few is with a case! in side She longed to be alone She walked qtucUv along the garden path to the harbor, and when time she sink down on the rustic seat, and (safe way 10 her part to give the poor girl But there is no hope for Ghollry, and sIiocIoh paired 1 there was any good news, or even if the deal had gone 011 as they expected, would not her father had 0 written P She had kept a bl me he lull along' but now the future seemed so dark, so (that tin, so wretched She wept passionately, and then, exhausted, she leaned her forehead, with its bullet rippling hair, on the arm of the matter seat, and the tears drop d slowly, rise, and heavy through li 1 fingers SI 0 noticed not that the sun was down, and the golden clouds were becoming dimmed She was blind and deaf to all around her, and did not even hear the sound of horses' trump come up to the house, for the entrance s, it was out near the harbor She sat there Bridle for awhile, and then thinking her mother would not he her to be away so long, She rose slowly and tried her wet blue eyes As she do so, by 0 s acted us she heard 11 foot full on therefor path Her heart see a quick throb of hope, and then Bank again since it came Perhaps train her father Shonoiiedhcr sell and moved towards the door A shadow fell upon her, for some one was standing in the doom is 13 who is, in a wild, choking cry of delight, au ii in into Geillrj s arms SI r c le li The it was in his 11 of lil II and I ride nell 17 at her 111 less free " Oli, Qcillrj, an d the (', my darling You have come back to me was all she could not mur ' than!
