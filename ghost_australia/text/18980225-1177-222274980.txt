BEGINNING THE NEW YEAH. One excellent way of beginning the New Year aright (says "The Farceur ") isjto copy the Chinese custom of settling up all our debts and starting off with a clean sheet. Apropos to which manv Dersons anhear to t.hinlr that a newspaper is run for the mere fun of the thing and costs nothing. There is no more fun ill running a newspaper than in being passed through a steam threshing machine, and the cost is about equal to that of main taining a circus menagerie. A popular opinion seems to exist that newspaper proprietors re quire neither food nor raiment, neither do their families, hut are all fed by ravens, or crows, or kookaburras, in some mysterious manner, and make their own clothing out of fig leaves and sugar matting. All this is a ghastly illusion. The newspaper man has to deal with the butcher and baker and summer- suit maker the same as other men, and if he doesn't pay spot cash many tradesmen consider that lie has foully tarnished the lily- white escutohoon of journalism, and they watch his dwelling place as dosely as a sharp- nosed terrier would watch a rat- hole. These aro sad reflections for New Year's time, but, like Banquo's ghost, they " will not down 'I â€” at least until every subscriber has anted up his 1897 subscription.
