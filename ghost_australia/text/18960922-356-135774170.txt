THE BRITISH NAVY THEN AND NOW. A very impressive incident took place during the recent manou?vres of the Channel fleet. The gathering of warships is declared to have been the most splendid affair of the kind witnessed in modern times. No fleet comparable in size and strength has ever been seen in snuch procession at Spithead. There were 28 battleships as well as 20 destroyers. When these huge leviathans were just passing Osborne in single file a Royal salute was fired from every ship in the line. By a strange but happy coilcidence, Nelson's famous flagship, the Foudroyant, was being towed to Cowes; and it was just after the Royal salute had beon fired that the fleet glided silently and majes tically past the relic of a bygone era. The sight must, indeed, have been a unique one; and it was said by one who witnessed the in cident that ic was as though the ghost of the past had risen to survey the present.
