SPECIALITIES. WE are continually receiving congratulations from Southern correspondents on the "high tone" maintained by our Legislature, as compared with the license of language, and senti- ment. indulged in in the Parliament* o{ other polonies. But' it Is among • the '" things not generally known" that there* are those among our egulators who; maintain; the same", hjg% tone out >f. docni aa well aa in their plaoa in (be, House.

It is melahohbly to relate that the polioe authorities do not' seetn to appreciate the high tone of our legislators as much as our Southern correspon dent do.' They seemed to thUk he shoul4 baVe showed more head and less "tide." They re-1 turned him evil for good. rThey fined him five shillings.'
