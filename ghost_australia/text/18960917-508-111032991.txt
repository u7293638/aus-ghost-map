The Mystery of Ho. 1. The Tynan plot thickens, or, rather, becomes more confusing, it is now announced that before leaving America Tynan unfolded a scheme which he had conceived for assassinating the Prince of Wales, that he proposed to hire a house opposite ' ' Maryborough ' House and tunnel between, the two, finally killing H.B.fcl. by means of a dynamite bomb. It ia added that a eroup of Nihilists at Chioaeo. headed by a chemiBt named Ribinovitz supported i'yn&n; in his scheme tor blowing up the Priuce and provided hii» with funds for. putting it into effect. One ia somehow 'reminded of toe lines j published by 'Puaoh' when the Prince was ! much younger and used to be energetic j in various ffays,- from laying' foundation stones I to flying off Irotu MarJborough Honse fco attend fires and accidents: j A gas explosion eently wakes \ Our H.H.H. at font. Oae such we had the other night. And shall have many more. - There is something almost comical about this idea of tunnelling tt&der; Mariborough House. This jb the sort of detail which has given the American papers opportunity to ridicule the plots. ' A tunnel uutfer Pall Mall may be a good enough scheme for a chemist named %a,bino?itz to put his money und that of his fellow Ninilieta into, but no Londoner, however desirous to compass the deaths of Princes, . would ever have bad aay thing- to do with such a haram ecarnru venture. . Tynan, be' it remarked, knows tha West Ea-i of London; he was once a member Of ; the Queen's Westminster Volunteers. If TCynan obtained money trom Jinbinovitz, or any one else, 'for:' the purpose of under-, mining - t.he , Prinoes's residence, he ob tained it under falsa pretences. tie must have meant. to apply it to some villainy Other than tbe sjeneational one for which it was paid Over to him or simply to steal it. Let us ,tafee ?£ fiance at what i'ynaa is «ai-i to have proposed to do. and its. possibilities. If Msxtbowragh ' Woase , ware tunnelled under At all it would have to be done from the opposite sicU of Pall MbIL There certainly could be no tunnelling front St. Jumes's P«tlace to. the wegt p£ Murlborough jELouee, nor iroai one of the cluba to the e*et of tbe entrance.

There remains -jne. supposition about a tpnnel to be mentioned which is less wildly wdicalousthan the others. Between 5& and 60 Fall Mall is the entrance to Crown-Court, a little court containing several bbibII bonsee. A con spirator, without being, an absolute lunatic, might have, thought of hirinsr one of these email houses whence to start; his tunneL Wxa rent would not have been huge, and; there would have been no other ienanta under the same ' roof. But there would have; been -lif£cttltteB which would have counterbalanced these ad vantages. Once more, how would the boil from the taons^ have been dis posed of ? Further, a tunnel from Crewn Court to Mariborongh House would, if it went anything like direct, have to run unaer cellars of hoases in Pall Mall, and so would have to. Jae At % great depth. If the tunnel -were deep down it would have a chance of striking the main sewer, ?which is periodically ? inspected. : If a. tunnel oould by any possibility be within a moderate. distance of the surface po^bno conld ever be enre from day to day that it would not be discovered. The persons in London who have control of gas, water, aad electric wires have a way of dicing up the streets as frequently ana capriciously as do their counterparts in Sydney. Besides this the nocturnal comings and goinga of the tunnellers would have had to have taken place under the eyes of special police constables, of tbe .sentries at Marlborongh House and St. Jamea's Palace, and of the many people who until a late hour are going and coming from clubB in Pall Mall and St. Jamea's-btreet, to tay nothing of the hundreds of casually passing cabmen and general street frequenters. .4. tunnel is obviously an undertaking quite oat ot tbe' queution. Thera is another 4etail of the plot which suggests a fresh interpretation of the Shaksperian line 'uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,' It is said that one of the letters found on Wallace when' he was arrested at Botterdatn, referred to an intended attack upon a crowned head about to visit the Queen, The letter iotimateilthat it was 'intended to place, bombs under the pillows of the bed occupied by this monarch.' The Czar of Buesia, it is added, expresses a doubt as to whether he was the person whose life was threatened. In one of Mr. Labouchero'e Christinas numbers the Czar Alexander II. was made to lyrically express tbe reasons why he liked to escape from the dangers of hie Enssian palace to visit hie son'ia law, the Dnte of Edinburgh, in Kent. The draw* backs, to a Bnssian bed and breakfast were des cribed somewhat in these terms : — ; ; ? Bed—' - ' ~ -? .—-'- -.-—- Ah, woe is me, upon my mind I bear a heavy ioad. - I fear each night when I turn in My bedstead will explode. Breakfast— A murderer was called in to taste My Busjar and my tea ; Suoh agonies as his, again I . never wish to see. The present Czar seems for a Czar to be of a hopeful temperament. - Perhaps he, too, has a good knowledge of Great Britain, and recognises the. patent absurdity . of any one attempt ing to bribe the 'Jeamses' or the house maids of one of the Royal Palaces to pat bombs in the beds of Imperial guests. Such thin- s may be possible iu Kussia, where there are a good many people in that romantic condition of early civilisation which favors secret plotting. Such enthusiasts may take kindly to handling bombs, but the idea of the stolid writish man-servant with powdered hair and padded calves taking part in such desperate work — and bombs could nor be introduced without some such, inter mediary — is rather too funny. The tunnelling plan and the bomb pie bed plan both bear the im press of the mind of the foreign anarchist. Tney are both schemes ' oi the kind that 1 have been tried with success in Hus I eia, where there is to favor the latter 1 a widespread atfiiiatipa of desperadoes, and, to tavor the former,. no intricate network of pipes and wires in every street. If Tynan, countenanced these schemes he, in all j likelihood, countenanced them for the I sake of obtaining money for eome other purpose, possibly for outrages of a different; kind. Or it may be that money was Tynan's main motive, and that he only meant to have out rages enough ?o justify him in the eyes of his suDscrit'ers for collecting it. Tynan is a man who, having got safe oS after having organised the Phoenix Park affair, lived for years on the notoriety he thus obtained. Later . he endeavored to earn money, by publishing so called revelations concerning 'accomplices whom he professed to have had. May he cot have thought to restore his fortunes by & fresn conspiracy waich should make as much noLso as tbe Piicenix Park murder? Of course to suppose this is to suppose him a villain, but this is no mote than has been- said of him by all parties. His 'revelations' were aB severely denounced by the dynamite partisans-as his umrder plots had been by the loyalists. __ Interest of late days would seem to have waned considerably with respect to the heroes of this zing. Instead of their movements being chron icled with minuteness and regularity, we only hear of tbem now at rather long intervals, and, so far as the majority of ns are concerned, it would not eppear to matter much if they were never heard of at all. Thus it will probably be but a very languid sort oi attention which will be occasioned i»ere by that pugilistic message just received from America, even though it announces a vjctorp for one Australian boxer, and a coining event, of some im portance for another one. F. P. Slavin has knocked out«J. Kilraxn in a boxing match ia.t Baltimore in one round, and E. Fitzinimotis ib matched to fight, lor a purse of ,£4000, Jamaa Corbettf the conqueror of the once, redoubtable I J. L. SalUyap. Tne knocking out of Kiirain j was probdbly no very great achievement, 1or all the rapidity with which it was accom plished. When Sullivan, as subsequent perform- | ances of his ma.de sufficiently clear, must have i been far enough on the down grade, he was still | too many for Kiirain, and easily defeated him. As | some years, nave passed since that event, Kilraio, in. the course of nature— -not to taention other courses which the boxer with average festive prompt- j ings is pretty safe to follow in his hours of j ease — must 'alreadv- , have been pretty -well! knocked out as far as any nottble effort was con- J cerned; As regards Corbett also it is to be sai-l ; that lie must lie a mau of phenomenal etaiuina i if, after all the junkettings and zejoidngB ] lie has. had,8-nce he defeated Sullivan, he can ever i a^aiu 'resume anything like his best Jorni. ' The i ?'pumper/' as he was, once nicknaused, must, ^ it is to be.imagined, be included, in the list of pugilists who are to be considered as faitiy pumped ' out. It is not alone the tict that the present representatives of the ring have either iiiilen from the front mnk, or' have never attainelit, which is threatening the popularity of thit instiiuiipn so seriously. Tint 60 many people look askance at it now who formerly : supported it is. rather through the strong iuapicion ofits belog aaEOciated wi\h ! practices utterly irreopncilable with oven the | cjoet^oalieed ideas Hkely to be suggested by£ the old pnr&se; of the ??noble and manly art/' ' ' As touching the U-S.
