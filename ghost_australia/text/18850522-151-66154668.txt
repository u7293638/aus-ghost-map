SPORTLNG. li f P Br " CETAeun." ' Last Saturday Mr. Cox held another of his pleasant gatherings at Moonce Valley, the attendance was moderate, partly owing to the threatening look of the weather. The fiehls were the avenrge and the racing fair. Business opened with the Trial Stakes and the public had very little dilliculty in spotting the two who ran tirstand second. The West Bourke Handicap was reduced to two backers and these two finishe1 first and second which caused the lichlders to look very giant, they had their revenge, however, in the Steeplechase, as the pub lie backed 4 horses none of whom won, an outsider, Topsail, winning comfortibly from the favorite. The Selling liaco was a good thing for Goldtop who led all the way, his most dangerous opponent Sister Unice having bolted atthe start. The last race was an easy win Ariel who started second favorite, his winning being in marked contrast to his Elstcrnwick per formance. h On Monday the lHunt Club celebrate the Quecn's Birthday in their usual manner ~ and I trust the weather will keep tine to Senable the public to patronise what bids fair to be an excellent day's sport. The meeting opens with ma Selling Race, for S lwhich I fancy Angram. The HIurdle Race has a large liheld of which I like lHunter, Old Soul, and Guanllislh. The Bt Birthday IHandicap' has 25- acceptors; of whom I think about a score will start. The winner should come frotm Paillero, to Evil, Footman, Arsenal, and Mentmlnore, in hiav at perference for Arsenal and Foot a man. The season Selling Race Prilms may win and the Welter Flat I think xl Duration, Meander, or The Ghost, best in. er For the Steeplechase I fancy Goodwood, P Topsail, and Native. Th Te Sydney Royal Stakes and Birtlhday r. Cjup, have very good acceptances, illt ,e predictions are for the short- distance, h- Astrte, lloneydew, uand Nepicallina, and for Cup J have a liking for Anchorite, nt Archie, and First Demon. |1n ~ - U------'
