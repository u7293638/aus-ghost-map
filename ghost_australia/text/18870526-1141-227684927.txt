' .... Touchstone is also entereu, a ghost of a chance. I should not be at all surprised to sec tho "Peer" figuring in tho betting Sot tbe V.R.C. Derby one of these days. Mr Gannon, as a rule does not give 700gns. for a horse for nothing, and I should advise sporting men to have an eye on liim — or both eyes if they prefer it. TheQ.T.C. have decided to build a new Stewards Stand, and tbe tender of Mr John son for L1015 lias been accepted. Tlie new building, which will occupy the site of the pre sent shed, will be of brick, and will contain Secretary's office, Stewards' room, weighing room, large dining room 80 x 32 for committee and victor. A staircase leads from the ground floor to a balcony or stand for the com mittee and officials on the top. According to the plaus the building will be handsome and an ornament to the ground. The question has been raised as to the ad visability, or otherwise, of postponing the an nual race meeting of tbo Rockbampton Jockey- Club from the 16th and 17th ?of June to the 23rd and 24th of the same month, in order to liavc a show and races io jubilee week. It is contended, with a considerable sbow of reason, that an adjournment, under the circumstances, would be productive of benefit to all classes. In tbe first place, it would undoubtedly brine a larger number of country visitors than under present arrangements, as the jubilee festivi ties, added to the show and racing carnival, would prove a far greater attraction in one week than when spread over a fortnight. As now fixed, some op-country people would come for the show and races, and others for the jubilee amusements. By having all in one week visitors would have more fun, as well as being able to save tizne and expense. Then, again, having all the Government holidays in one week would prove more convenient for local employers of labour, many of whom object to holidays extending over so long a period. That polo is a popular game was proved in an indisputable mannerwhentbe BrisbanePolo Club met the Toowoomba men at Yedra Park. There was a large and fashionable at tendance of spectators. His Excellency Sir Anthony Musgrave, of Queensland, and His both present, and appeared to enjoy the sport immensely. The fair sex were in great force, and lawyers and statesmen were there in abundance. I also noticed one or two mem bers of the S.P.C.A. Society there. They watched the go»c with stern faces, evidently bent upon discovering cruelty to animals if possible. They had not a show, aud at the con elusion of the game one of them remarked that the ponies appeared to enjoy it as much as the men. The game was rather a one-tided affair, for the Towoomba men won easily. Some smart play was seen on cither tide. Mb P. m. Pinkook put a atop to. the fight between Smith, of Sydney, and Mass Earby. The arm of the law is powerful, and it was stretched out to get between Smith end Ktrby. : What a pity this was, and how the police have writhed at it. 'No doubt the men in blue have been speculating as to which M their number would be the lucky one turned on to npfl tb« fifffit dohe-properiy.

A capital luncheon was provided at (he Hotel, and mutual good wishes were exchanged.' A return match will be played after the5 Holloway's return from their Northern tour# The Union Athletic sports will be held next Saturday, at Poowong Grounds, and there is every prospect of some good spent. They nre- rather late in theseason, but it is better late; than ever. i A Tsornxc and Driving Club has less formed, and already more than a hundred - members have been enrolled. A committee 1 has been appointed to select a track and draft rules.
