Jim the 'Penman '.was, and.may now be, living as '-a ticket-of-leave man; in Western Australia..- Mr. George Agustus Sala says that it is certainly. not long since he , was V alive and rrierry,' '? and- for aught I1 know,' he adds, ' Sawavd, ex-barrister and forger, may'b'e' ali%'e now.' This noted oriminal was transported to the. antipodes about 30 years ago. Mr. Charles Arnold, ? who has just returned to London from a successful tour iu. the Australian colonies, ? accompanied by the clever little girl, May Hannan, and that noble dog Lion, who play ? such im portant parts in the popular 'Hans the Boatman,' has received a warm reception amongst his brother- artists on this si de He will ' rest ' till the autumn,' when he. starts again for a tour in the: United States; .-... The performances of ' The Bells ' and] the trial scene from ' Shylock, ' which were given before the Queen at ? Sandring ham on April 26, by the Lyceum Company, took place in a theatre constructed for the purpose in the large ball-room. All the scenery was specially .painted and a new act drop, almost afac-simile of that at the Lyceum, was provided. The properties were also made smaller in order to be in harmony with the governing idea, which was to reproduce the Lyceum in miniature. The proscenium opening was J 8ft, and the stage about the same depth. Behind the footlights was produced a miniature, Lyceum stage, with its lime-light 'gallery, gas battens, and rneohanical . contrivances, all governed arid regulated 'from the prompter's box on the left hand side of the stage. Six of the rooms in the house adjoining the ball-room were placed at the disposal of the company as dressing rooms. The orchestra comprised string instru ments only, and numbered 13 performers from the Lyceum. To cany on this entertainment Mr. Irving brought down no fewer than G3 persons, who travelled from London by special train. San Francisco probably never saw amoro important event, in an artistic sense, than the ono that was enacted at the new California Theatre, when the two greatest tragedians on the American stage dedicated to the sock and the buskin the finest theatre in the world. This is a sweeping assertion, but it is undoubtedly true. Edwin Booth said when he went through it that ho had seen the finest theatres in the world, but had never seen its equal for artistic splendour. The writer of this has been in all the beautiful -theatres of the Atlantic region, and has seen itB equal in , none of them. Before the house was thrown open, such remarks seemed like a bit of Golden Gate brag ; but after its splendid reality has burst upon the vision, it is seen to be the simple truth. No description in the limited space at our command could at tempt to doN the subject, justice. It must be seen to be realised and appreciated. ' Penelope,' a new musical version of the old farce, 'The Area Belle,' by Messrs. Hawtrey and Solomon, was produced at a comedy matinee recently. The piece follows the lines of the farce, and its jokes for the most part are preserved. The music is of no particular importance, as it consists chiefly of ditties of the mock drawing room type, together with a few well- written con certed pieces. Each of the characters is entrusted with one or more soncjs, that of ' The Area Belle ' being sung by Miss Kate Eversleigh, the Missus by Miss Car lotta Zerbini, and the three lovers by Messrs. Leno, Harrington, and Hawtrey. The milkman's song.with its refrain 'When the new-laid egg is breaking, ' is pretty enough, and so is the waltz song of the ' Postman's knock,' sung by the Missus. Mr. Barrington's first solo song, with its refrain, ' That'o what's the matter. No kisses is the matter. That's what's the matter with the missnB,' is more of the music hall type, so alBO is the song of the policeman. The whole of the supper and ghost scenes are, on the other hand, quaintly comical, while generally a largo number of humorous touches are introduced in the muuic. _It was a pity that the ar tists engaged were not better vocalists; and an accompanied quartet, indeed, very nearly came t* grief . From an acting point of view, however, the piece is decidedly funny. ... The administration of the' PariB Exhi bition have conceded to . Mr. Seymour Wade permission to erect in the grounds near the foot of the Eiffel Tower an Inter national Theatre, for the purpose of per formances being given therein by the people of all nations. The theatre, which had been contracted to be opened on June 10, will hold 2000 persons, and will haVe attached to' it a smaller theatre for about 300/ for experimental purposes. The whole building will be lit by: the . electric light.,., .-? .'....? :??..?:;?-..; ?..'-. ,\ [.
