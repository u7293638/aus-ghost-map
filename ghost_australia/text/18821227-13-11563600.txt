WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 27, 1882. As an instance of the way in which the material interests of the country are subordinated to the convenience or safety of the party that happens to be in power, we may point to what has been done, or rather left undone, in dealing with phylloxera. As our readers are aware, the Berry Government passed an act for the purpose of extirpating that scourge. Lue most of the legislative efforts of Mr. Beeby's Administration, the Geelong District Vine Diseases Act was vicious in principle and defective in detail. Instead of making the cost of staying the plague a charge upon the vignerons generally, under some well- considered scheme of contribution, it authorised the destruction of vineyards, and directed that compensation should be given out of the public purse. Of course that was a very easy way of meeting the difficulty, aud just such a one as would recommend itself to men destitute of constructive power ; but we can scarcely imagine anything more un- just to the taxpayers as a whole. Under the arrangement described, the work of uprooting vineyards has gone on merrily. The late secretary to the Agricultural department endeavoured to protect the Treasury to the best of his ability, but when the present Government took office, political pressure was brought to bear in some way or other, and Mr. Wallis had to go. We are not often able to agree with Mr. Longmore, but like him, wo fear that the state has been " bled" most unmercifully in connexion with this business. If the work of eradication had been done effectually, many people would not have begrudged the outlay. But the Berry Act was so badly drafted that the work of destruction has been anything but complete. There is no provision compelling owners of vines to disclose their existence, and no clause requiring people from whose land vines had been removed, to give notice in the event of shoots springing up from roots accidentally left in the ground. These were serious omissions-omis- sions which, taken in conjunction with careless administration, may yet render all the expenditure that has taken place unavailing. Vineyards of any extent were quickly destroyed ; but isolated vines escaped notice. No efficient supervision was kept up, and there is no knowhjij into^ what_condition gentleman from South Australia visffeu the Geelong district for the purpose of ascertaining how matters stood. In consequence cf vhat he saw, Mr. T. Hardy, accompanied by a number of Victorian winegrowers, waited on Mr, Young, and represented the necessity for moro active and systematic efforts, The interview took place about a month ago. There uOuld be no doubt about the urgency of the u?se,as the only hope of arresting the spread 01 .tue insect is to destroy it before it has as¿;ime(i tue winged form. If the law as it stooí was sufficient to cope with the unforeseen difficulties which had arisen, the most active administrative steps should have been at once taken under it. If fresh legislation was needed, there should have been no delay in asking Parliament for the necessary powers. Wo seo now that ia Mr. Young's opinion an amending act is required to enable him to deal effectually with the pest, but he allowed a month to elapse after having had tho matter brought under his notice before urging the Assembly to deal with a subject in respect to which time is everything. It was only when the House was about to rise for the Christmas holidays that the Minister for Agriculture made it convenient to sub- mit his measure. The bill contains some very stringent provisions with re- gard to the removal of plants from the infected district. This may or may not be necessary. Mr. Bosisxo, who has paid considerable attention to phyl- loxera, tells us that it is the opinion of all writers on the subject that the insects do not attach themselves to any form of vegetation except the vine. He " has examined root products, such as " onions, carrots, and parsnips which " were grown in infected ground, " but could find no trace of insect "life." Mr. Bosisto thinks that "if " the shoots were to be destroyed, there " would be no immediate danger of the "disease spreading. If the roots re " mained in the ground, and no shoots " came to the surface, the insect would " disappear when the resinous substance " in the roots died out. Nevertheless, "he would have all roots and root " lets thoroughly eradicated, and the " ground trenched 2ft. deep to discover " them." It was said, on the other hand, that although the insects might not attach themselves to anything but the vine, they might bo removed in the soil attached to the roots of plants and trees-roots which had been entangled with vine roots, It appears to us that the possibility described is by no means an imaginary one, and that the provi- sion in the Amending Bill is not too stringent when we consider what is at stake. It was perfectly useless, howevor, to ask Parliament to adopt such proposals off-hand, at a moment's notice. The Minister might possibly plead in extenu- ation of his neglect to move in the matter at an earlier date, that he was entitled to expeet that members of tho Assembly would restrain their desire to commence the holidays and sit sufficiently long to come to a decision on' so important a question. Possibly he was entitled to expect that and a great many other things, but ho knows by experience that the right of expectation is often a very barren one. If the matter he wished to have considered had been a party issue or a case of scandal, he might have retained a House to midday on Friday if necessary, but mon who object todo business atany time weronot likely to take a knotty question in hand at a late hour on the ove of a vacation. By putting off his amending bill to such a moment Mr. Young virtually deprived himself of all chance of passing it, and if, in consequence of his delay, phylloxera should spread, he will not be able to escape a considerable share of the blame which the public will mete out liberally, One or two off nights given to the Land Bill would havo been sufficient to discuss and pass the amending vine diseases measure ; but, as uaual, practical business was shouldered out of the way in order that something of moro importance from a party point of view might receive atten- tion. The land question occupies very natu- rally a prominent place in the public affairs of every Australian colony, and in Western Australia at the present time it is tho cause of a good deal of excitement. This excitement loses none of its intensity because the colonists have only a very limited control over the disposal of Crown lands, and their recommendations on the subject are re- ferred for revision to Downing-street. The Legislature of the colony recently passed a resolution affirming the expe- diency of altering the regulations for leasing pastoral lands, and this resolu- tion has been returned with a despatch from Lord Kimberley refusing to ac- cept the suggestions embodied in it, And to the natural feeling of irritation due to being overruled by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, we are in- clined to attribute in some measure their apparently unanimous expression of dissent .from Lord Kimberley'.? de- cision. On the face of the despatch we must confess that Lord Kimberley seems to have reason on his side. The difference between him and the colonists lies in a nutshell. It is generally known that recent discoveries in the northern part of the colony have very much modified thj opinion long held in the more progressive colonies that Western Australia offered only an indifferent field for pastoral enterprise. A reaction set in. Pastoral pioneers made preparations to begin grazing in the newly explored districts, and pastoral speculators awoke to the fact that another lucrative field had opened for their operations, There has been, in fact, what Americans would call a West Australian "boom," and a good many people in Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia have become interested in it. The regulations under which the country could bo taken up facilitated speculation, It was not necessary for the speculator to go near it, Ho could draw squares and parallelograms on the map, apply for the land contained in them, and by paying the rent-10s. for every 1,000 acres-hold the lease of it, being allowed a term of three years before he was required to put stock on the country or do anything whatever to im- prove it. But when the three years expired, he was compelled to stock each separate holding to some slight extent, or to forfeit it. It was on this point ture, considering the regulation too stringent, passed the following resolu- tion : "That it iadesirablo to rescind that por- tion of clause 12 of the Kimberley Regulations requiring that the proportion of stock pro- vided for therein ebal! be upon the land com* prised in each and every lease ¡ and it ia desirable to provide in lieu thereof that it ehall be sufficient if the said atock shall bo within the district; and further, that the possession of the stock by the lessee shall for the purposes of the regulations be considered a sufficient compliance therewith." Lord Kimberley refused to sanction these alterations, giving as his reason that « under the proposed modification a rnan who fully stocked one frontage block of 50,000 acres, which is 78¿ " square miles, with 1,500 cattle or " 15,000 sheep-which it would pro- bably carry if really good country " might hold unoccupied 11 other " frontage blocks, amounting to 700,000 acres, or l,093f square miles of couu " try, which at the above rate might be " occupied by 21,000 cattle or 210,000 " sheep. This calculation allows 3 J " acres for one sheep ; but even con " ceding that five acres or more must be " allowed per head, it will bo seen that " a speculator occupying and working " one block would still be able to hold " without using a very considerable " extent of country, which otherwise " might be profitably used by other " persons. It is evident, therefore, that " it will not be advisable to accept the " proposal of the Legislative Council as " it stands." The reasons which led ti th promul- gation of tho original ri .'jUt'cna are obvious. In Queensland no lease is issued for new country until the appli- cant is prepared to make affidavit that he has the required small propor- tion of stock on the ground, and runs cannot therefore be " taken "up on the map," But pioneer occupation in that colony is an extension of existing settlement, and a man who wants new country simply drives some stock out a comparatively short distance beyond formed and occu- pied stations. In tho central and northern territory of South Australia and in Western Australia, such a regula- tion would check pastoral enterprise, for a pioneer desiring to occupy new country has to go a- long distance be yond existing settlement before he can reach it. Indeed, the new pastoral dis- tricts of West Australia can only as yet be reached from the seaboard and by stock taken round by sea. Obviously men would bo reluctant to incur the risk and expense of the transport unless they had an assurance beforehand that the land would be secured to them when they reached it. Hence the I policy of allowing country to be taken up on the map. But the arrangement lends itself unfortunately to mere speculation, leading to what all colonies Lave reason to dread, idle monopoly of the land. As a matter of i fact, syndicates have been formed here and elsewhere which have taken up vast areas of the new country, comprising many millions of acres, and depend for their profit mainly on the hope of inducing bonâ-fide squatters to buy portions of their huge leases, To some extent these speculative syndicates may do good to the colony, because, being desirous of selling out, they are interested in finding occupying purchasers, but the history of Australia generally, and of Western Australia particularly, points to the conclusion that this process of forestalling applied to new country is always dangerous, and sometimes rum ous The regulation requiring lease holders to stock on the expiry of the term of grace allowed them, is intended to minimise the danger It is Btrange that West Australians, knowing the history of their own colony, and how greatly its progress has been retarded by the reckless manner in which land was formerly allowed to pass into the hands of men who could not use it and kept others away, should not be moro keenly alive to a danger which is thoroughly under stood by an able and disinterested man like their Go\ ernou and by the Colonial Office. To some extent, no doubt, thej are influenced by the pre vailing excitement of land speculation, which seems to offer chances of easy en richment to everybody, and is creating an unusual stir and movement in their hitherto stagnant co u inunity They aro evidently ner vously anxious lest anything should happen to bring the pleasant and piofit able bustlo to a sudden end But the compromise embodied by the Govi un or in a minute to the surveyor general, implying that tho stocking clause would not bo enforced to the injury of bona fide occupiers, is apparently the best solution of the difficulty, aud the one that will probably be adopted Mr Mik ins has obtained a piosouta lion atlast Tho historic mov onion t for a MirarrjB toBtmionnl, with which Air Mumio was associated, was,, as tho world well knows, a melancholy failure. Sir W B «Toms, who made the ollonng last week, did far bettor than his prodocessor, possibly because ho did not ann so high Iho promoter o£ tho origmal Mirams testimonial appoaiod to antici pato a purse of gold or a sen ico of silvei, whereas Mr. W B Jones has been content to provide Mr Mikamp with such an intellectual feast as can bo derived from a study of a bound copy of lils own address upon tho leasing question Intrinsically, the testimonial cannot bo called rich, but the circum- stance that it was presented by a W. B. Jones may go far to render it distinctly precious in an artistic and moral sonso For the name in question is familiar in tho leasing agitation There was a Mr W B Jones, who was known as a Yarra bank leaseholder, and the talk of tho day was that it was the influence of this gentleman with radical politicians that occured the conversion of certain of those loasoholda Into freeholds Rumour now assera that the Mr Jones who sways Mr ¿on vioi p and the Mr Jones who worships at the shrino of Mr Minwis aro ono and tho samo person If so, no wonder that tho membei for Collingwood is touched Ile has spoken, and behold ho has so cured lins illustrious convert i he wlnlomo champion of tho cause of ficeholds is now begging Mi Mik vms to orato yet moro, is on treating the lion gentleman to do his utmost to pievent any other leaseholders rising in rebellion this is undoubtedly allecting, and j et it may be questioned whether Mi Mut v.vis and his admiréis go quito far cnouBh J ho least that we should expect of Mr W B Jones is that ho should oller to return his Crown grant, which ho has discovered should never have boen issued, and should bo content with the leasehold title which ho haabocomo v.on hoped that Mr Miiums"would by this tnno havo put a stop to tho circulation of his building society tracts, in winch ho adjures people to pay no rout, and to bo como then own landlords On tho whole, it is to bo feared that a Bcoihn,' public will be moro impressed with w hat Messrs Jon i s and Mm nts practico in their own ínteiest than with what the) pi each as the proper policy for others.

Coswello, C. Bennussi, J. Parker, W Hanley, F. Geise, J. Mould, W. Hampton, H. Reid, A. Ferguson, R Luke, J Gander, and W. Delahunty. These are all miners who have worked on the Hard hills previously, and there is no doubt that if they had not been employed the two Chinamen would not have been alive to-day, as the nature of the ground would not allow for any mistake to be made. The distance they drove in about 13 hours was over 40 feet, which had to be closely timbered, and having to work in air so unbearable that the candles would, burn only at the air pipes. The broken ground also for hundreds of feet around made the risk still greater for if the shaft had col- lapsed, there was no hope for them whatever If the Royal Humane Society grant medals to those who save the lives of their fellow creatures at the risk of their own, we think that the miners who saved the lives of the two Chinamen deserve some recognition at their hands."
