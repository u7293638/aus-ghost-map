That team quite kept up their reputation, for the tail of the eleven carried the total beyond that of the Rockhampton Club, and they finally won by 12 runs on the first innings. W. J. Kellaway, T. M. M'William, R. C. Rule, and \V. U. Eaton aft1 played in good style for their ruus. The Alberts were beaten by 66 on the first innings by the Banks team, who scored their first victory. In the junior competition ihe Alberts opposed the Foresters ou No. 3 wicket, but the game ended in an abrupt termination, as the Foresters retired from the wickets when they had only another wicket tp full, apd very little chance of winning. The Alberts scored 71 in their inninps, F. VV. Woodroffe (36), W. Thompson (11), and F. H. Perkins (10 not out) being the chief scorers. The Foresters lost nine wickets for 51 runs. G. Ogden (18) and M. Jones (11 not out) were the principal contributors. — The Past Gram mar School defeated the Ramblers by C runs. The Grammars with four men short made 31, S. Baildon scoring 11. The Ramblers could only reply with 25 runs, C. Lomas making 11 not out. The Grammars lost three wickets for 27 runs in their second innings, G. Hall scoring 13. — The Rockhampton team were victorious over the Present Grammar School by 31 runs. The School, who were without the services of their two best players, only made 25 runs in their first innings, R. M'Doniild contributing 12. The Rockhamp tons were disposed of for 56, and thus secured a win by 31. J. Pike (16) and C. Steen (14) were the highest run- getters. The fact that the Melbourne Cricket Club authorities have invited Prince Ranjitsinhji to bring out the next English team evidently means that another Knglish team will be invited here soon, probably for the 1899-1900 season. It is very doubtful whether the Prince is capable of managing a team as it should be, and surely it would be rather a paradox having an English Eleven led by a man who has only lived u few years in Great Britain. The latest from Ranjitsinhji is as follows : — 'To the ciicketers of Australia, — Before leaving your shores, I would like, in a few words, to express my feelings or cordiality to you. My stay in jour country has been of a most plcasaut character, and the cricket I have seen has been of the highest standard. Let me asbure you that I will carry away the most pleasant recollections of my visit to the Antipodes, and ehall look forwatd to another visit with great pleasure.' Ranjitsinhji told an Adelaide press representative that tl proposal to play matches in Western Aus tralia had been abandoned, with regret. Personally he would have liked to have called at Perth and the goldfields. He had deter mined to visit Australia again, and would not pass Western Australia without going to Perth. The Melbourne Argus, in its leading columns of the 24th of March, thus refers to Stoddart's Eleven :—' After an eventful career, Mr. Stoddart's eleven leaves Aus tralian shores to- day. The development of Australian cricket is shown not only by the test matches, but by the contests with the individual colonies. New South Wales play ing the English team won the match ; Victoria made a good stand, though she was beaten ; and South Australia has shown a marked superiority. And yet not so long ago no individual colony had the ghost of a chance in such a struggle. There was only one eleven in Australia that could play a champion English team, and now there are at least three with a chance. Hill, Darling, and Gregory are the batsmen who have brought Australia to the front, and in addition to Jones and Trumble there are M'Leod, Howell, and Noble as new bowlers. The advantage which the home team possess is shown by the fact that in all probability not one of the three bowlers last named would hive been sent to Englaud had our men bceu visiting there. They were put iu here as play went on. There are incidents iu the campaign which may as well be forgotten. In the next eleven the captain will assuredly bind over his amateurs not (o use pen and ink, and will insist that no wicketkeeper shall be demonstratively impudent to the umpire. The ' win, tie, or wrangle ' principle, libellously attributed to Yorkshire athletes, will be scrupulously set aside. After all these incidents have faded into oblivion, the sensational campaign will remain, and the boys of today as veterans will relate the story of how the Australians defended the wicket and used the ball in the brave days of '98.' This is what the English Sporting Life says of M. A. Noble: — 'There can be no docbt that Noble is just now one of the greatest all-round players in Australia, and he seems to have thoroughly filled up the vacancy in colonial cricket caused by the capricious be haviour of George Giffen.' At a receut cricket match in Melbourne, it is said, two ladies were conversing. One was heard to say, after a couple of runs were scored, ' Why, ble6S me, they have giveu both runs to the one man.' At the present time, says Cricket, a native named Jayaram is attracting the attention of cricketers in India by his remarkable batting. It is not claimed for him — as yet at any rate — that he is a rival to Ranjiuinhji, but without any doubt he has very few, if any, superiors in India. His best performance was his 132 for Bangalore against Madras. He was at the wickets only an hour nnd twenty minutes, and his innings included a six and twenty-two fours. The Nilgiri News publishes a portrait of Jayaram, I remember receiving about a couple of years ago a letter from 'King Willpw,' who writes the excellent 'Cricket Chirps ' in the Fetes, in which he expressed the opinion that, given the same opportunity, there were probably several natives iu India who would become Ranjitsinhjis in skill. Having seen Ranjitsinhji bat, I can [quite believe it, because the secret of liis success is his remarkable keeuness of eyesight and extraordinary suppleness of wrist, character istics which many Indians posses*. The Toowoomba Chronicle says:— One of the English cricketers tells of au experience at one of their country matches. 'The people barracked pretty warmly, but although their sympathies were entirely with their own men they were not abusive, and we did not mind. I say this of the majority, but there was one there who was certainly the most in sulting and blackguardly barracker 1 have over met in Australia or anywhere else. He barracked persistently all the time we were in the field, and his language was simply lurid blasphemy. I never heard anything like it, and I have heard a Queensland bullock puncher at au excitiDg crisis.' ' Why didn't you give him in charge ?'' asked a bystander. ' Give him in charge ! Where was the use ? He was a trained magpie perched upon the roof of the dressing room.' E. Wainwright, the Yorkshire professional, is to icceive a benefit during the coming English season. A. E. Trott, who continues his wonderful per formances in South Africa, received a present of £20 for a century score. Ou another occa sion, playing for Pretoria against the Pirates, he took nine wickets for 87 ; while in another match he scored 215 not out. Following is a copy of the communication sent 'to the New South Wales Cricket Associa tion by Charles Banncrman, dated the 4th of March ;— ' J. have regretfully to report to the N.S.W. Cricket Association the conduct of Mr. Storer in the fiual test match. On Monday, the 28th of February, I was at lunch, and Mr. Storer made use of the follow ing words before members of the team, whq are willing to vouch for the correctness. The words were, *? You are a cheat, and you know it.' This was while the members were discussing the decision given by me in Dar ling's favour I.b.w., Briggs bowling. I have also to complain of Mr. Storer frequently turning to me whilst in the field, not for an appeal, but in a nasty manner. I replied, ' You mind your own business and I will mind mine.' I intended to report this matter earlier to the association, but before doing so, as I did not want to injure Storer, but settle the matter quietly, 1 thought I would see Major Wardill first. I did so, and he said that he would see that Storer apologised for his con duct to mo. I understand that Major Wardill, before leaving for Melbourne, left a letter for Storer to apologise to me before he left Sydney, otherwise, Major Wardill in formed him, the matter would be reported to the New South Wales Cricket Association. As I am not in receipt of this apology, and the team leave Sydney on Sundav evening, I am now compelled to report t]tj»matter ta you, eo that it can be dealt wiw/ before the team leave Sydney. I BhouliPprefer you seeing Mr. Stoddart first, as an inquiry may then be unnecessary.' It will bo seen that Banuennan acted with great consideration over the matter, though he has received no satisfaction. Stoddart replied on the matter :— ' Have left matter entirely to cricketer mentioned, who prefers matter should come before Marylebone Club in pre ference to apology.' Storer never denied having made the offensive charge. It was useless to do so, for J. Worrall und C. Hill, among others, heard the remark. The Sydney Cricket Association arrived at thin decision : — ' 1. Having heard the charge preferred by C. Bannerman, the umpire, against Storer, the English player ; haviug received substantiating evidence ; having given Storer an opportunity of refuting the charge or of apologising, which he has neglected to do ; this Association expresses strong disapproval of Storer's conduct. 2. That the foregoing be forwarded to the Australasian Cricket Council, with a request that it be transmitted to the Maryleboue C.C.' The form shown by the young Sydney cricketer Victor Trumperin electorate cricket this season has been something wonderful. Altogether he has played in seven innings, and on three of these occasions he has been pat out. He scored 59 not out last Saturday iSjgaiast Redfern, and will continue his innings fio-d&y.; His scores, which will be read with interest, are as follow :— 82, 123, 125, 85, 120 «iot out, J91 pot out, and 59 not out, making » jbotal of 785 runs for four completed innings, gv an average of 196 1 per inningp. bis wonderful consistent run-gettiug has been greatly instrumental in placing his club, the Paddington, on the top of the list, lie should almost be a certainty for the next Australian Eleven which visits Eugland, if form is to count for anything. The match between Melbourne and North Melbourne commenced on the 21st instant. Melbourne went to the wickets, and when the stumps were drawn two wickets were down for 335, to which Trumble not out contri buted 162 and Graham not out 131. Speaking at a smoking concert held in con nection with the Post Office Cricket Club (England) on the 8th of February, the Duke of Norfolk said there seemed to be indica tions that the great game of cricket was taking the place of the more serious parts of life. Nowadays as one passed through the streets and read the headings on the placards of the daily press they knew that criuker was the work of life, and he was therefore bouud to say he approached the subject with something like reverence (hat evening, li-lid there was an element of sadness #c4 anxiety in it. On the placards £.hey saw set out in small, very small .type, *' Reverse on the Indian 'Frontier;' £nd then, in exceedingly large type, ?' Test Match : Collapse of Euglaud.' (Loud Jaughter.) tie supposed the intelligent foreigner imagined thut at last England was ?jised up and done for, and that the reverse on the Indian frontier was but some subsidiary skirmish. Those placards certainly suggested a. great many things, but principally that the general run of folk was now more anxious to Snow whether England or their colonial cousins had won at cricket than whether the troops on the frontier had suffered a reverse. However, they could take comfort to them selves that the greatnational gamesconstituted the backbone of tho country, and he ventured to think it was a very good thing that they took a real pride, an intense earnestness, iu those manly games. Why, one of the greatest mistakes ever made was when the German ©ajperor was over heie some time ago. He «ras taken to see a review, in which one of our soldiers stood for about a thousand iu his own country. The Eton and Harrow cricket match was on at that time, but he was not taken to see that. It was folly, because a cricket match such as that would have, no doubt, enlarged his mind. (Hoars of laughter.) As many readers are aware, the Melbourne University Club recently made a world's record iu their match against Essendon. The Argus, in referring to the conclusion of the match on the fourth day, remarks:— 'Al- though Easendon had to field three substi tutes, they had all their bowlers present, so that from first to lasc the attack was genuine and well sustained. Bullivant carried out his bat for a first-class innings of 139, and was loudly cheered. This made five individual scores of over a hundred for the innings, and although this feat has once been accomplished in a pennant match in Sydney, the University aggregate is the greater, their five batsmen having scored 889, as against 609 in Sydney. In another respect the match furnishes a record, for having three men -away Essendon scored only 76, and were, according to the league rules, beaten on the first innings by 1018 runs, the greatest number that a match has ever been won by. The following are the complete scores of this wonderful innings : — MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY. L. Miller, c Ramsay h Smith ? 205 II. J. Stewart, c and b Washington ? S3 C. Miller, c C. Christian b Washington . . . . 57 R. C. Osbornc. b O'Shea ? 100 W. O'Hara, hit wicket, b Griffiths ? 7 .T. J. Quirk, b Sampford ? 179 E. Feilchenfeld, c Gaunt b C. Christian .. .. 170 H. Bullivant, not out ? 130 W. S. Ross, b Griffiths ? 32 A. Gray, b H. Christian ? 22 T. Lewers, c C. Miller (sub.), b Washington . . 26 liyes ? 31 Leg-byes ? 2 Wides ? 6 Total ? 1094 The wickets fell as follow :— One for 38, two for 150, three for 459, four for 612, five for 740, six for 82g, seven for 845, eight for 968, nine for 1025, ten for 1091. The Melbourne Argus thus refers to the conclusion of the play in the last match of South Australia against the Englishmen:— ' Darling stayed a long while on 96, and when everyone was hoping to Bee him reach the century he enicked one frun Mason, and Storer did a war- dance round the wicket as an announcement that he had held a catch. The crowd was doubly disappointed in that Darling had not only missed the century by 4, but also the compilation of 1000 runs for the season by 22. The partnership had yielded 187, and with only forty minutes re maiuing for play, a .iraw was inevitable. Darling made his runs in exactly three hours, and hit ten 4's. After Darling's departure, attention was concentrated on Hill, who quickly reached his centuiy and passed Wainwright's score, going from 98 to 109 iu three hits. Reedman and Bill played out time, South Australia, with eight wickets in hand, wanting only 6S runs to enable them to score a victory. The champion played a magnificent innings, worthy of his high reputation. A strong feature of it was his clean off play, but all round the wicket his strokes were perfect, and he never once looked like giving his opponents a change to dismiss him. This is his only not-out innings of the season, and gives him a lead of his redoubtable opponent Ranjit&inhji; by 5J runs in the averages, and places him in the position to which he is justly entitled by his wonderful performances. At Townsville last Saturday, J. B. Perrier played a capital innings for 51 (out of a total of 91) for the Commercial Club against Townsville. Iu the second innings the Com mercials lost five wickets for 22, Perrier being 8 not out. The Townsville bowling was wonderfully good. Following are the batting and bowling averages in first-class matches in Australia this season. Most of those who played in less than ten innings, or obtained less thau ten wickets, have been omitted : — BATTING. Innings. N.O. H.S. Total. Av'ijo. C. Hill(9.A.) ..19 1 200 1108 C04J K S.
