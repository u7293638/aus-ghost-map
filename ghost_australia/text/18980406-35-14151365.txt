Mr. Barton proceeded to explain the principles of the Commonwealth Bill of 1898 He said that the measure itself confute the arguments which had been brought against it. He described the manner in which responsible government was provided for the British type of constitution was preserved it was untrue that the bill was a slavish copy of the American Constitution Both Houses were to be elected by the people and there was also given power to dissolve both Chambers In addition there was to be one man one vote How, then, could that be an illiberal bill ' Then it was said that they were hasty in the matter of uniting If they carried the matter at the police, as he believed they would at the end of May or the beginning of June, it would probably be a year and a half before the constitution could sprang into life, and it would be another six months before the Parliament could be called together It would therefore, probably be two years from now before this Federal Parliament was fully at work (Cheers All New South Wales required was justice If she got that she would be able to hold her own position as the premier colony of AUBttaha (Cheere ) Some of the opponents of the constitution were ghost raisers, and wanted to Hellion the honest electors of the country (Laughter ) in pointing out that the Parliament would have power to regulate trade and commerce he said that the protectionist must be prepared to face intercolonial freetrade Federation without intercolonial freetrade would be only a burlesque (Cheers.) Another point was that the Federal Government would have power to deal with banking and insurance This would enable the passing of an Act like the Canadian Bank- ing Act, which gave security to the Canadian banks, whilst all the bankaoutsido were in a state of panic (Hear, hear ) There was a good deal of disappoint- ment expressed amongst the members of the one inan one-ball " partly because the railways of the different colonies were not at once to be federalised , but what State at the present time would give up its railways " The States kept their own land, and the railways were really necessary for the development of the land However, power was given the constitution for the Federal Government to take the railways over should it over be deemed necessary to do this (Hear, hear J Passing on to explain the power of the two Houses, Mr. Barton said that to constitute one House so that it would always had power to pass a bill over the head of the other Home would be a sham and a delusion, so far as having two Chambers was concerned and he had not yet reached the point of having government by one Chamber only (Cheers ) The experience of America, and also or the Australian Conventions, was that combinations of the smaller States against the larger States would not occur in any event, however, the deadlock provisions might be adopted as a last resource But these provisions were not liberal enough for some of our members of Paihu meet the fact was that federation was becoming a question but between two opposing sections of the people, but between the Parliament and the people, and it was quite right that the recent prorogation should have taken place, taking away the power of this Parliament to limit the rights of the people in the matter of federation (Loud applause ) He had no fear for the future of federation, but he had great fear for the political future of some of the members of our present Parliament (Laughter ) Mr. Barton then dealt with the nuances of the federation and with the control of the rivers, and he was loudly cheered at the conclusion of his address Alderman Shute moveless That this meeting, having her 1 the principles of the Federal Constitu- tion Bill of 1893 explained, is of opinion that the measure is just and liberal, and well fitted to be the constitution of the free people of Australia " Mr. Archer seconded of the motion, which was carried with cheers A second resolution was also enthusiastically agreed to,-" That this meeting expresses its satisfaction that an association has been formed to secure the requisite number of votes to ensure the adoption of the constitution by the people of New South Wales, and is of opinion that a. branch of the same should be formed at Burwood, and that eulwcriptious be invited to carry on the campaign " Votes of thanks to the lecturer and to the chairman for presiding concluded the proceedings
