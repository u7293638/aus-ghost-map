PORTFOLIO. He who bids us work, works Himself. God our Creator, Christ our Reedeemer, ':' the Holy Ghost our Sanctifier-the very names show that each one works yet more, far more than we. Therefore let us look upward, andllet us look onward. A day is coming when all of work that is bitter shall be done away-its over toil, its scant reward. But work itself shall never end for the Christian. In the nlke of fire there will be no work: only uselessness, only suffering, only self-torment and mutual torment: the torment of the re morseful and the torment of the taunter. But in heaven there will be work, when Once the Resurrection comes, when once the body is given back: work delightful Sanid blessed: the work of unwearied praise, the work of unhounded knowledge, the work of indefatigable love. On earth w:'ork is our necessity: we can only shake it off through sin, we can only shake it ,off in misery. In heaven work will he our happiness: it will be the hadgeof the saved, the perpetual proof to us that we are redeemed and rescued and glorified. Let us so work now that we may be per mitted to work then.-C. J. Vaughon.
