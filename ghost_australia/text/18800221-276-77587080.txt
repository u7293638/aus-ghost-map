THE WORLD'S WHEAT YIELDS. The official returns of the estimated crops of the United States, published by the De partment of Agriculture, reach us by the mail. It ia stated that tie " crop is estima ted at 448,000,U!JL» bushels, and is the largest ever grown, exceeding that of 1878 by about 28,000,000 bushels. The actual yield per acre ior the whole country is 13'9 bushels against 13'1 last year. The maize crop, the return states, promises an outturn of over 2 '0, 00,000 bushels, which is greater than that of last year, though by what percentage the report does not state, there being a blank space where the figures should be. The acreage was increased by less than 3 per cent, over that of last year. The oat crop falls about 12 per cent, short of its predeces sor, the average having beau reduced nearly 4 per cent. The potato crop, increased by over 60,000 acres, also shows a great iuc ease in yield, the average boing the largest since 1875-" From these figures it is clear that the: reports which have been, made public from time to time as to the enormous yitlu of wheat expected \n the States were not al together exaggerated. As may be expected, owing to the failure of the European wheat harvests the exports from the United States are very large. From the official return we note that the United States have exported 107,802,254 bushels of wheat and 4,276,527 barrels of flour during the niuo months cud ing September 30, 1879, as compared with 76,128,273 bushels ami 3.3S5,199 bairels in the corresponding period of the previous year. Whilst on American products it may be of interest to quote an extract from a' report recently furnished to the United States Woolgrowers and Manufacturers' Association by the Secretary. The report stated that " the wool production of that country was estimated at 42,00 ',00 J lb. in 1836, at 60.000,000 lb. in 1860, at 147,900,000 lb. in 1867," and at 208,000,0u0 lb. in 1877. The report proceeds " A more remarkable fact indicating progress in our wool industry within the latter period is this-that the product of 1867 was from 42,000,000 sheep, while the product of 1877 was from 36,000,000 sheep, the substitution of superior races, improvements in breeding, and a more advanced sheep husbandry generally being the cause of the greatly increased average yield of fleece. Siuce 1836 there has been a constant decline in the numbers of sheep ID the older States, so that while the wool pro duction in the whole country is live times as great as in 1836, there is now in older States less than half the number of sheep there was at that period. This has been compensated by the growth of sheep husbandry in the new States and Territonea. In 1862 Hallos tor & Debbles introduced 400 pure Spanish Merino ewes to California, In twelve years the inorease of pure stock from this flock was 28,000. The production from this single State has since reached 50,000,000 lb. in one year. Sheep husbandry is generally extending throughout the South. So far as the North is concerned, Merino sheep husbandry has con sisted in improvement of stook for amelior ating the common races of the South and West. The best recorded yield from Merino in 1809 was 9.5 per cent, of unwashed wool to the live weight. In 1864 the best re corded yield was 21 per cent., and the heaviest fleece 271b. In three rams bred in Vermont siuce 1873 the average yield to live weight was 27*3 percent, of unwashed wool, and the average weight of fleece 34Jibs., while, what is more remarkable, the fineness of the fibre equalled that ot the Saxon super electra." From an official return of the imports of foreign and colonial produce iuto the United Kingdom during the eleven months ended November 30, 1879, we notice that the quantity of wool imported from Australia was 282,097,2891b as against 272,150,5041b. in the corresponding period of 1878. When it is stated that the total quantity imported was 387,280,3821b. it will be seen how largely England is depen dent upon Australia for her wool supply.

In Thurgau, Switzerland, the body of a man was found, and it was supposed that death had been the result of foul play. But the medical men declared that the wounds were self-indicted, and that the deceased must have committed suicide. The body was identified by a large number of relatives as well as sawyers with whom the deceased had worked as having belonged in life to one Baumeler, a sawyer of Lucerne. His kinsfolk followed him to the grave, put on mourning for him, and the local papers published notices of the dead man. On the evening after the interment, while a number of Baumeler's friends were making merry in the vil'ago inn, who should walk in among them but the dead man him self ! The peasants dropped their tankards of lager, and stared at the ghost in dismay. Some took to their heels in fright, and, run niug home barricaded their doors. The ghost quietly took his seat at a table, and ordered sausages, bread, and lager in large quantities and, his meal being finished, went straight to the priest, and thanked him for the eloquent funeral oration he had de- > livered over his grave. He then called upon the head man of the district, and expressed his obligations for the trouble taken on his I ehalf. So far, the ghost showed himself to be amiably inclined, but his mood changed upon looking down the oolumns of a local paper, which contained an obituary notice of the deceased couched in not exactly compli mentary terms. The ghost, whose reputa tion during lifetime was really somewhat shady, seeing his chance, intends to bring an action for libel against the editor, who forgot to state in the obituary notice that deceased was a representative of all the virtues. The circumstance of a live ghost walking about, and contemplating law proceedings, has thrown the village into a great state of ex citement." AN amusing case of " diamond cut diamond" occurred some time ago,'in which (states the Wallaroo Times) the well*known delineator of " Lights and Shadows" came off decidedly second best. It appears that he has some vacant allotments in one of the tpwns of the Peninsula, which are worth very little, but on receipt of a telegraphic message from a resident requesting him to Btate wiiat he would bs willing to take for a couple of them, the thought struck him that some fresh mining scheme was ia pro gress which would greatly enhance the value of property, and he replied " J210O cash." A few minutes afterwards he was seated at dinner, for which the prospect of making an excelleut morning's work had given him a good appetite, when a friend, who was pre Bent asked him if he had heard of the " dodge1' practised by the assessor of the town re ferred to for the purpose of facilitating his labors and at the same time increasing^ the revenue of the corporation j and on " Lights and Shadows" stating his ignorance thereof, informed him that the astute official induced a resident to communicate with the owners of property as if with the intention of becoming a purchaser, and by that means obtained their idea as to its worth. At this unwelcome news the elongation of the features of the member for Sturt may be imagined, and he exclaimed excitedly, " The telegram's gone, cost me a shilling too, and I can't appeal against my own valuation. It's really too bad," while his friend, who had been similarly treated, rather enjoyed the discomfiture oi " Lights and Shadows" than otherwise.
