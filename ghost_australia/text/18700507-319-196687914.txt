The Government aro already prepared with the estimates, and there will be no delay in making the financial statement. The aim of the Government will be to get the Appro priation Bill for this year passed as quickly as poasiblo, and then to have a short ad journment or prorogation, after which the financial affaira of 1871 will be .discussed and provided for. It is easier, however, to sketch out the programme of a session than to keep to it. The idea of short sittings and recesses ia never realised. There are so many ar rears of legislatorial work that it will be im possible to get through them, and at the same time to dispose of the financial business of a ^ouple of years^ if '.the work; is not gone; through continuously.:. . There is but slight1 ptospect of a ! mid-\viriter recess I Would it not be better at once to/ grant supplies for fi jteen ^months,1 and:, th'iis .bring : the colonial, -financial i i year in i adcord? with the English financialyear, both terminating, on ^ ;the 5|;h i. of Aprii in each year ?^ The plan1 of making provision' lor: the : expenotitu^e a year in^'d: vance will be very inoonvenieht, and it is,' mpreover, at yarianc^ with the principles of responsible i gavernment— the fundamental; axiom, 'of 'yhich is, redress ..of , grievances before supply.

He paid the rent and the amount of valua tion, and he thought the affair settled, when a series of annoyances were commenced,; which ended in a peremptory order that he should give up the best eighty acres in the lot.
