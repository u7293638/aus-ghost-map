A Thrilling Story A writer in the Gentlewoman is responsible for the following thrilling story :-Two young girls, one of whom I know, went to stay in a country house some time during the year. They were given a room with a legend attached to it to the effect that a woman whose face was covered with blood haunted it. I believe, however, that the girls laughed and said they didn't mind. That night they went to bed, and very soon afterwards the door opened and a woman rushed in, her face covered with blood, and threw herself on the bed. The girls, terrified out of their senses, pulled the bedclothes over their heads and re- mained where they were, too frightened to move. At length, hearing nothing, they fell off to sleep, thinking the ghost had gone ; but the next morn- ing when they awoko, there, right across the foot of the bed, lay the woman dead and cold. Poor thing ! she was one of the ladies' maids who had suddenly broken a blood-vessel and ran in to try and get help ; but not being able to speak for choking, and also being the exact impersonation of the " ghost," she got no assistance, and so died.
