These Httlo acta of kindness, So easily out of mind, Thcso chances to bo angels : Which oven mortals tind â€” Thoy como in night and oilenco, Bach chill, roproachful wraith, . When hopo ia faint and flagging, And a blight has drooped on faith, ' ' For lifo ia nil too short, dear, 1 And sorrow i3 all too groat, To auffer our olovr compassion, That tarries until too lato. And it's not tho thing you do, dear, It'a the thing you leave undone, Which gives you tho bitter heartache At tho setting of the sun.
