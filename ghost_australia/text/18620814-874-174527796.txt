Laertes was- verygood, notwithstanding his habitual way of looking abstractedly at tile central gaselier, As though it were a reliable source of mnemonic inspiration. The Royal family of Denmark must have been a heavy lot, if King Claudius fairly represented tliem. It is very clear that the American style of beard, the barbe aux Eiats Unis, was in royal favor at the time, asndthat whiskers were prohibited and the courtiers confined to a door-knocker arrangement of hirsute ornamentation about the upper lip and jaw. King Claudius had about as much regal anftaaiioft as the King of Clubs, or the lung of the Cannibal Islands, or the aboriginal monarch who walks about Melbourne with a brass plate dangling on Ms dirty waistcoat, and begs for nobblers. As to thfc Queens we happen. to recollect seeing Eugenie, and to haveread graphic descriptions of the air and manner of Marie Antoinette, so Gerfcrudeof Dehtttatk suffered accidentally in our preoccupied imagination. The Ghost was theiiiost Uearty/jovial, healthy, athletic ghost we have met with in the whole course of our gh&stly; experiences. His voice was like a chur<&';org&ny; fiiid he rirast liavd been living at Brighton, and have joined iti the prevailing church service dissensions, and have imbibed a strong objection to monotoning his conversation, as in accdtflanCfe wltk hjl ! ghostly Usages. &tUl;, he was a well-bred ghostVand always sh^t tl|<f stage door vety carefully after him, as a gentlemanly ghoSt 'Jl£oiild : a.t tljla' k&Mti; of the year. And when he waved his wax-candle Itjokitig baton, and, after describing a figure of four with the quiet energy , of a band conductor, brought it home to his left shoulSei 1 , one could. pee tl>e military instinct of the spectre strong in death, .... ' . Why they should have covered the glioses, tead shoulders with a blue mosquito curtain we don't know, "as those safrguiniverous persecutors could no more penetrate tlie plate armour of Hamlet's time than a sixty-eight pounder could make,holes in. the Merrimac. Still, the ghost was the regular "stage traditional ghost, and the gallery admirers who would insist upon his foggy majesty coming before the curtain, did so perhaps with less of the feeling of wanton potency which enabled tliem to tiatt epirifcsfrom the vasty green room, than with a desire to welcome the most popular-apparition of the modern stage. The ghost sfeemed to our feeble and clumsy imagination as if he had been put by for a season tir sOj fehd having been covered with a net, like a chandelier in summer, r to keep the flies off, it had been forgotten to remove the covering oil the sudden occasion of his reappearance. It certainly was a most clumsy expedient for obnubilating a ghost, to cover his head and shoulders like a heap of plum buns in a pastry-cook's, and to leave his fleshy calves in all the pride of fish-scaly tin armour glittering in the blaze of a hundred lamps We eauaot get over flie ooaarse buSoonery of that grave digger, who seemed to think fchaitttike whole play was but a foil to shew off MB wretched Merry Aatfeewism. When some of the gallery freqaenlfcers, i» a Saturday night plethora of predisposition to make the tat of every thfaag, laughed at Mm, the grave digger became still Biiore meoagraoasly Ja&k; Pudding-like in his antics.
