SILVERY RIPPLES. I think we often bring the clouds That boat around in shadows, And they, like ghosts revived, in shrouds Of memories enwrap us; As daily down our path we onward wend, Nor see the smiling sunbeams round us spend Their silvery ripples. I know that as through life we tread Engrossed in care and sorrow We miss the brightness overhead, And seldom think to-morrow Could ever steal the darlings playing round, Could ever bush that laughing, merry sound Of silvery ripples. The summer shadows floating o'er Where the sand and waters meet Enrich the beauty of the shore And the wavelets at our feet; I'm sure that if we would more careful be Tbe rippling tide would bring to thee and me More silvery ripples. â€”Sydney Hail.
