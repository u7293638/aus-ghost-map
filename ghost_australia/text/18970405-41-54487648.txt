Marshall & Sons have forward us a set of six songs, written by Heinrich Heine, and set to music by Lous Lavater, who has in t-.vo instances urovided hi« nwn I Jigliih tran.«btion. aad in the others utilized that by Mr. E. A. 15owrins'. Thi* little bunch of melo-He? — 'A wish,'* 'May .'on^.' 'Thou'rt like a tender blosioru,' ''Sjjjp of the tailor's ghost,' 'To the star*.' and 'Tho land of dreams'— forms tk« co:nnoM.rs Opus I. They are d--e:dodly j-lea«n;j acd mclorlioua. fallowing in tha frankest fashion the form oi the modem German lied. Mr. Lavater possesses a goad vein of raelody aud a fair amount of originality, particularly indicated in tho cadeaces of bis sonars. The accompani ments aro gracefully and effectively written, though by no means hard to pl*y', and tbe harmoniea show the hand of the cultured musician. Tho writer, too. avoids tha us* oi abrupt extraneous modulation*, to which «ome composers ara painfully addicted. For drawing-room us* or as encore numbers these- little songs should at once find favour with thoso who detiz* something dainty, ?xtutiob aodrtfiaed.
