HOW TO PICK OUT A WIPE. (By Josh Billings.1) Find a girl that it 19 years old last May, about the right higbt, with a blue eye and dark-brown hair and white teeth. Let the girl be good to look at, not too phond of musik, a firm disbeleaver in ghosts, and one ov six children in the same family. Look well tew the karxter ov her father ; see that he is not a member ov enny klub, don't bet on eleckshuns, and gits shaved at least 3 times a-week. Find out all about her mother, see if she haz got a heap ov commonsense, studdy well her likes and dislikes, eat sum ov her hum-made bread and apple dumplins, notiss whether she abuzes all her nabors, and don't fail tew observe whether her dresses are last year's ones fixt over. If you are satisfied that the mother would make the right kind ov a mother in- law yu kan safely konklude that the dauter would make the right kind of a wife. After these prelirq^narys are all settled and yu have done a reazonable amount of sparking ask the yung lady for her heart and hand, and if she refuses yu kan konsider yourself euchered. If, on the contrary, she should say yes, git married at once, without any fuss and feathers, and proceed to take the chances. I say take the chances, for thare aint no resipee for a perfekt wife enny more than thare iz for a perfekt husband. Thare iz just az menny good wifes az thare iz good husbands, and i never knew two people, married or single, who were determined tew make themselfs agreeable to each other, but what they snkceeded. Name yure oldest boy sum good stout name, not after sum hero, but should the first boy be a girl i ask it az a favor tew me that yu kaul her Rebekker. I do want sum ov them good, old fashioned, tuff girl names revived and extended. Acstbalian Gold and Coal.—The total value of the machinery in the gold industry in Australia is £1,849,112.
