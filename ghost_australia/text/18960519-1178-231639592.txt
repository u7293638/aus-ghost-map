THEMOLONG SEAT. Challenge to Dr. Ross, M.L A. Molonq, Tuesday. Thoro is- considerable amusomcnt horo ovor freo-trndor' M'Kenna, tho Coronor and roturning-ofilcer, challenging Dr. Ross, M.L.A., to resign. It is a wonder tho free traders aro not satisfied, as thoy havo beon hoaten every oleetion for tho last 13 or 15 years. . Tlio Coroner objects to Dr. 'Robs' " History of tlio Molong Hospital," which appeared in tho Molong Argus somo time hack, and invites tho doctor to sottlo tho matter at the ballot-box. Tlio idea iB very funny, and is treated by protectionists witli contempt. There is not ri ghost of a elianco of tho freo-tradors over winning tho Molong seat, which hns nlwayB been a pro tectionist ono, nnd sinco tho land tax enmo into existence it is plain that at tho next general oleetion protection will have n 10 to 1 majority ovor frco-tradc.
