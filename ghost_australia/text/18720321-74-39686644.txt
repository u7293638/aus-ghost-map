LATROBE. (From our owes Correspondent.) VWhilo Tbry little rain has fallen here during the past week a great deal must have fallen inland as the river is flooded, and the ricketty old bridge is again threatened with total destruction. I am inclined to think it would be a blessing if it were to go at once for no one then would risk life in attempting to cross, and sonimthing would be done towards the erection of a new bridge. I may mention that a relative of mine, a resi dent of Leeds, in Yorkshire, England, writes to me and says, "I may tell you I dine on your (Australian) .preserved nmeat-beef and mutton -weckly sold hero at 0id and 7d per lb, while our English butchers are charging 10d and lid. It needs but one fair trial to gain favour. The majority of our people, however, not knowing tihe process it passes through in the curing or the cooking, or how it is fed, do allow conceit to push in its nose, and very foohshly turn their back upon it. They do this to their own loss. The demand for it, however, increases weekly, and it is already affecting the English prices." TIIe ALAAMA CLAI~As.-The Spectator looks upon the statement published by the Morn??g Post, that the United States were putting in a claim for 500 millions sterling, as absurd. In point of fact, the treaty would never have been agreed to if the United States had not expressly waived what they held to be their right to clainm-compensation as a nation for the general and indirect consequences of the escape of the cruisers, and agreed to bind themselves to the direct loss of property due to that cause. The Spectator expects and hopes we shall pay for the devastation of the Alabama herself, which we ought to have chased with our own navy rathec than allowed her to go on in her illegal career; but it doubts very much indeed if there will be the ghost of a case for the loss caused by anothes vessel.
