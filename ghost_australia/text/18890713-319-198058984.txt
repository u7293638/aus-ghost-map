THE OLD HOUSE. In through tho porch and up the silent stair; Little fs changed, I know so well the ways : Here, the dead came to meet me ; it was there . j - rpjiQ dream was dreamed in unforgotten days. Bat who is this that hurries on before, A flitting shade the brooding shades among? She turned— I saw her face— Oh God ! it woro The faco I used to wear when I was young. I thought my spirit and ray heart were tamed To deathless ; dead the pangs that agonise. The old grief springs to choke mo— I am shamed Before that little ghost with eager eyes. 1 Oh, turn away, let her not see, not know ! How should sho bear it, how should understand? Oh, hasten down the stairway, hasto and go, And lcavcher dreaming in the silent land. —Anv Levy, in The Spectator.
