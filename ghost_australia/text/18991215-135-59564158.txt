Keep Out of the Past. Keep out of the past I for its highways Are damp with malarial gloom, Its gardens are soere, and the forests are drear, And everywhere moulders a tomb. Who seeks to regain its lort pleasures Finds only a rose turned to dust, And its storehouse of wonderful trea sures Is covered and coated with rust. Keep out of the past ! It is haunted, lie who In its avenue gropes Shall find there the ghost of a joy prized the most, And a skeleton throng of dead hopes. In place of its Deautiful rivers Lurk pools that are covered with slime, And these groves gleaming white in the phosphorous light, Corer dreams that were slain In their prime. Keep out of the past I it is lonely, And barren and bleak to the view, Its fires have grown cold, its stories are old, Turn, turn to the present, the new I To-day leads you up to the hill tops That are kissed by the radiant son, To-day shows no tomb-all life's hopes in bloom, And to-day holds a prize to be won.
