On the curtain being drawn up the stage was seen to be arranged in a somewhat different form from what it has been on previous occa- sions. A semi-circle, taking in about half the stage, was enclosed by hangings, in the centre of which was a recess extending back some distance. When the curtain was raised, Professor Pepper's son apologised for his father's absence, an apology that was taken by many to be seriously meant. Presently however the professor was seen in the re- cess, having come there no one knew how. After giving a short history of the celebrated " Ghost" Professor Pepper proposed to give a specimen of the way the discovery could be utilised for theatrical performances such as the ghost scene in "Macbeth." He com- menced by reciting the speech of Macbeth when the ghost of the murdered Banquo ap- pears and there seemed to grow out of nothing in the recess the figure of a man seated on a chair. As the recitation procceded the figure rose and advanced to the front of the stage, then gradually returned to the chair till, at the words, "Hence, horrible shadow unreal mockerv hence," the figure seemed to fade into air, leaving the chair where it was before. The illusion was a perfect one and the audience was so thoroughly mystified that for some momente they could hardly believe the evidence of their own eyes. This remarkably skilful illusion elicited enthusiastic applause fiom the audience. Hie exhibition of the por- trait limner followed in which a sketch of a head was done in blight hues on a large screen. The portraits of Lord Beaconsfield and Mr Graham Berry were given and at once recognised. Portraits of Sir Chas. Wheat- stone, Sir David Brewster and Michael Faraday were also thown on the screen but these were from photographs. The oxy- hydrogen microscope was exhibited for the first time, and proved a very successful and interesting entertainment. Various objects were exhibited but the most attrac- tive to the audience were the live water insects. One water beetle whose image on the screen was fully 14ft long was so violent in his actions that one could easily understand the fear of the old Scotchwoman that the beasts would break out of the water and do some mischief. The concluding portion of the entertainment was a fresh illusion. In the recess already men- tioned a small stand was placed and on this a loaf of bread was changed into a trra cotta bust , a second succeeded, and then followed a model of Cleopatra's needle. Oranges were placed in a basket and changed into tins of marmalade. One of the attendants then took his stand in the recess and before the eyes of the audience, but how, it is impossible to say, he seemed to gradually change into a young lady, who sang a verse of "Sing, sweet bird" and who was no other than Miss Alice Wooldridge. Pro- fessor Pepper then led Miss Wooldridge for- ward, and to show she was not a ghost she sang the second verse of the song, when the professor led her back, and in the same mysterious fashion as Banquo's ghost dis- appeared they faded out of sight. This illu- sion was received with most enthusiastic applause. Afternoon perfomances are announced for Wednesday and Saturday.
