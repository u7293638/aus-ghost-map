ORIGIN V.L CORRCsrOlVDLXCL BUILDING SOCIETIES. To the Editor of the Argus. Singles astonished to learn that the members of the Austinhu Feht Building coach who were present at the annual Mr still g on Tuesday) evening list, had elected Mr Hugh Guthrie in the office of President for the ensuing year, and still more so when I was told that he was elected in opposition to Mr bimuM God he Mr Guthrie is entirely unknown to nearly i art member of the Hicictt so much so indeed that it took me some time and a little trouble to find out that he was a gentian in connected with the Customs department He hire were taken and apparent interest in the Society, and as moreover I believe totally unacquainted with the general principles of Building Nineties, und in complete ignorance of the working of the one 0 i which he is called to preside Mr Goode, on the other hand, has been a most route number of our society his served upon the Coinnuitio furtwntenrs, and uncle stands as thoroughly the nature and institution of the 'smut is one man can do He is but sides as intelligent a id respected" tradesman these circumstances considered, it is difficult to a count for the choice unit has been made the memoirs present must either have been so marvellously silly as to have been tickled with leader of having a g gentleman bearing her M yes t a commission as their President, of the belief that that office is best filled by a man who knows nothing about the body, of it but he is toledo bend But whichever war it has been, the line acted Uolishli ton and tin as selfish, and unfair) towards Mr Goode Unuiter has been upon the Committee of the Au train left him ing Society unions the value of a President, who is a man of good business habits, and well grounded in the net ills of the par- at the I business t manifests so, and can i easily conceive that a man who knows nothing at all about it, is lil 1) to be more than useless in such an office But the worst feature of the affair is the in- gratitude it d splits to thrust the li ghost unearths) honour their Lift upon a man she had no claim to it, and who perhiipsnncrdioimt of it, instead of giving it to one who sought it, deserved it. and would have been, filled it, is I think decidedly ungrateful on the part 0 too murder And it is as impolitic as it is ungrateful II jw cm they affect that men will work upon committee and tax their time and their continuance for the benefit of the society, if the principle of eleva- ting over their heads, iron and never have been 61 the lightest use and never can be, in to be carried out Let the committee be composed of Guthrie's instead of Goodes, and the members shall soon be accustomed to hear reports read different rather from the one they have Inn heard. Building Societies are designed for the, benefit of tradesmen, end should be comprised of land managed almost exclusively- by that class Ours, perhaps, contain too many who are using it merely as a field for investing capital, by,,] LL whom greater profit, accrue from its operation than what the labourer or artizan will reno But let not the tradesmen belonging to it slight the intelligence and respectability of their class by placing in the highest office a stranger to its principles and to themselves, merely because) etiquette will permit the aristocratic title of Esquire being appended to his name, and the surface he 13 in is Vitale.
