ECHUOA EAST WATER SUPPLY. (to the editor,) fcm,—Like Hamlet's ghost the water famine in Echuca East at certain periodB of the year haunts the residents, and like that grim sceptre is an unwelcome visitor. That there must he something radically wrong with our local water supply is self-evident, and should rcceivo the strictest inquiry. The whole question appears surrounded with mystery, hut I think the correspondent writ ing in your journal some 12 months ago, hit the mark when he Baid that the out-let valve was being mufilcd, i.e., partially closed at times. Personally, I would not liko to im pute such a thing to our local borough engi neer, but the situation savours much witli this theory, and it would bo a graceful act on his part to placo himself beyond suspicion to hand over the control of this valve to the foreman of the works, Mr. Bartlctt, a man whom the ratepayers of Echuca East have every confidence in. The exigencies of the situation demand that something should be douo, and that at once, and it is to hoped our trust commissioners will take the neces sary steps to immediately rectify the existing insufiiciency of water buddIv in this part of Borough. —Yours, etc., A RATEPAYER.
