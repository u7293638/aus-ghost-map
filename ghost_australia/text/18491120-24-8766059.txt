THE LAST DYING SPEECH! If there were any bounds in nature to the criminal and lying perveraity of a hireling, they would have long ago been discovered by the Advertiser; but his article this morning, aimed at the vital interests of this colony, through an attack on our Represen- tative, must restore to their senses any that have fallen into that error. It has not yet reached the point of degradation to which men will go who hold their opinions and provender at the will of a corrupt Govern- ment and a host of official locusts. It is not Mr. Jackson, however, who has pro- voked all this ire; it is partly meant, no doubt, for that audacious Secretary, Lord Grey, who has not only doubted the "Doubts Bill," but condemned it, smashed it, and will utterly smash, pound and scatter to the four winds of Heaven all Mr. Fle- ming's law, the cases of Mr. Smith, and the entire legal credit of Mr. Horne. And not only smash their law, their lore, and their locus standi, but smash them utterly and for evermore. Like hearty criminals going to execution they now turn round and insult the Judges, smash the court windows, threaten the witnesses with their ghosts, take lunars at the people, in- terrupt the exhortations "to make a clean breast of it," with all manner of heresies and blasphemies, and finally cheat the hangman by kicking off their shoes among the crowd. The "Doubts Bill" was a bold, bad Bill, and those who defend it are bold, bad men. They are not entitled to the rites of poli- tical burial, which cover the inadvertent delinquencies of honest men; but to be strung upon everlasting wires, that their bones may rattle, and their jaws grin, to terrify all cringing lawyers and despotic Governors, world without end! How far this mean and miserable attempt of the Advertiser to injure the Public Meeting at the last hour will succeed, he will well enough understand in time for his dreams on Thursday night!
