The ' prograinine tas 'I:. formerly remarked, is a judiciously ?framed one, and about the best ever framed 'by/the Bbthwellites. The principal event iis th'e;Dennistbun Steeplechase of 7S aovs., ?a Karidicap5 of about two miles. There is ;also'a Welter Handicap Steeplechase of about i 2J 'miles. I should like to have seen ltbe distance in the Welter two miles, and 5in the Dennistoun three miles. A two mile handicap hurdle race with £3 ;added,arid Ladies^ Purse, a Welter handi_0 cap : of one mile and a half with 25 spvs' added, complete the programme. Nomina-. tions 'with one sovereign for each race wil Ibe ^received by the hon. secretary, Mr.1 Simon! Arhettbn or before the 27th August. I am' glad.'t'o ' see Mr. Arnett still at the helm, for' he is an indefatigable worker, i ?an.dTnuch of the subcess of the past meet ings held at Bothwell is in some measure du^to'hiiii. 'Ionly hope,that the nomina tions' ' will .exceed oven ' his 'most ?sanguine'' expectations. Bothwell, notwithstanding its distance 'from the'|ra'ilway,''ia11 a't favourite meetitg, and the' district 'contains some sportamba of the ; right sort; ! although ? it sustained; a ''great loss by the death of Mr. Alex.

'At present the Campbell Town meeting .is -fixed just' a day: before the Bothwell meeting.' It is hardly necessary io say tha*-1 horses that' ran at Campbell 'Town will not be able to go to Bothwell, and as the latter club was first in the field it would be hard upon them if the dates for both ; meetings remain' as they are. The Campbell- Town authorities1 look upon the matter in the^same light, and it has been suggested : that their ? meeting should be held in . ' September / ' or ' November. The first-named date' is rather ?? early, and if the meeting cannot be held in October, Novem- ' b'er;would'bethe Most suitable month. ? 1 | Last week Mr. C. S. |Agnew shipped General Jackson, by Castle Hill but of Miss J,abkson,-by Cervus, , to Melbourne. Mr. Agnew- intends ! placing the 'horse with some' Victorian trainer with the idea :of putting himovertho^ sticks. A The General is auset'ul sorb' of customer, and, no doubt will.take to the jumping; busineiss readily, and I think helwillpay.his way. .1 regret: to state that Mr. Agnew has lost his brood mare Young: Prudence, by.Pfiter Wilkins out of 'Prudence, sister to Jersey, and ruh riincr back ; to. the imported, mare- Fairy. Young Prudence was bred by the late hon. ;'T. W.i Meld; and is.bestknown to. fame as the data oft the constant and game Echo. ,: I I notice that.the fee. for St. Albans next season is 60gs.. I wonder what his price would have been if :.the son of Blair Athol had not been hired for. ; three seasons '?: by Messrs. Eield. The horse had a. very; poor chance previously, but '-I?;, think, , without disparaging St. Albans one iota, that his phenomenal success has in ; some measure,' b' een due to -Messrs. Field's jmares.',' You; cannot beatVth'eir breeding,; as- they rare : full of the priceless Whalebone blood. When. St. 'Albans first arrived in, the island Ipredicted a successful career for him, and he never lacked my good word, and therefore; if anything, \ I am preju diced in tluB grandly ;bred sire's favour. | Mr. R. G.Talbot ,waa a passenger from Melbourne by the Marigana on Monday. The colours of this good sportsman were to the fore on Saturday on ', Hippogriff at Flemington, but Mr., Talbot's- visit to Tasmania is not connected with racing, but a- more unpleasant business. The Fingal Railway runs for several miles through. his splendid estate of Malahide, and the question of compensation has to be.settledan the Law Court, and it is.to be.hoped that he. willscbre another win. , Mr. Talbothas a iebming, hurdle-racer in , ipppgriffjVthe,, winner^ of-; the, Maiden. iHurdle, who was' steered by.

' ! i Sheet Anchor was a great ? pot for the Grand National Hurdle, but I thought he iardly looked so well as he ; did when he stripped fbr''the Australian : Clip last March: ..The l Leviathan ofiered to ' lay Jfi300p'to! ^62000 about him, but although the -stable supported -him well, they de clined to accept the wager. Read sent The Agent to ? the post 'in' grand . fetble, and he 'was about the fittest horse that stripped (jluring- the day; 'Whatever chance Sheet Anchor possessed 'it- was ; throughly de stroyed ? by :jtlie';i ground he lost through Omadliaun falling-in1 front -iof-hiin, and he was'never in '-theirace' afterwards. After ? Guapdnsh ? making the runnirigat'the best pace'he^was'capable; of -nearly all the way, ; The Agent came;at .' the right moment and ; yon very .'easily. 'How:Sheet Anchor would : have i ared'' must' be ' now; ; a ^matter of con .jecture, but I; think the' son of; St. Albans ? would have caught ? the judge's^ eye first if 'hdha'dnot met with- the accident alluded ' to.- ? ? Cbrrigan' rode with : such admirable ? : judgment ; during the day that it is un generous to find a fault with him, but it seems a pity that he did not assume a more forward position with Sheet Anchor. The liorse^can stay, and he was not bverbur !dened ?with! weight, i .-:?? ? - ' , j The Grand National Steeplechase was a ohapter of » accidents, and .out of ? fourteen competitors '- three : alone 'stood up. The ? Ballarat : representatives, Morven and '^ymlet, stripped exceedingly, well, arid the former^ was most fancied, while Governor,: in The Agent's stable, was quoted at the same 'price as Wymlet. ' I' believe both owner, but the former for the most money. ?The1 followers of the green and white would 1 tiave: been. quite : prepared! to have seen Wymlet fall, butit was never thoiightthat Morven would coriie; down. . The latter seemed to bross his legs when landing after jumping the stone-wall.1 Denmark stripped i rather : light, and; looked; .comparatively, speaking, a pony compared with the ; majority of his antagonists, arid so did :M!inerva, who lasted the longest of the Tasmanian bred ones, with ' the exception 6i Denrnark, arid was -going well when she fell.: It was: a treat to witriess little Denmark sailing away under his 12st l'llb;'and jumping - like a stag.' He is beyond doubt a- moat' finished fencer, and if the going had been :a trifle harder, arid Eilduff made a little less. use of hirri, I thihk he would have even : been more dangerous. With ja vivid recollection, of Sussex's great performance,; when he got home' in; the Grand : National, four years back, ;under;:13st lib, 'I must say I think that Deninarkfs ! performance is entitled to much commendation indeed. .It must be remeiribered that. Sussex was a different .type of . a ' horse ? from Denmark. The. gallant little son1 of Horatio would, have .received a tremendous ovation . if he had niariaged to have landed past the judge's box a /winner.' ;Wymlet, the victor, was ridden with grand judgment by Corrigan, and; I think that the victory of theBallarat rbpresentative was more due to Tom than the horse. At the last fence. he hit badly, and was almost down, but was admirably saved by Corrigan'. ? . The winner is a son of that ; now, well- known ,, steeplechase sire King Tom, iand , al though r not such a clever fencer ,-. , as , .he ,'; might ,; be, yet he is .Very- fast between the, jumps. .. Sailor ran a good honest horse, and der foated JDenmark .-. for second place. Forester stripped well for the time he has been in training, butj as the others had six or seven months more condition, he natur ally laboured under a great disadvantage, and did not present that muscular appear arice the majority or his opponents did. He, however, was one of if not the best type of a steeplechaser, that started. He had bad luck, as he stilled the first fence heavily, and after struggling along and getting over the stone wall he fell- at th« logs. , ? '-''.', '-,??'?' .'.',.-?': , . ? '; .' , Notwithstanding 'all ,the casualties at Flemingtbn' on 'Saturday, the only serious ca.se was that of Crocker, who rode TaribU iser, and ' austuned concussion of the ' brain, and was reported to'', be in a'yery ipreniripus state when : I left'.Meib'jburne. ilieo', one of the Grand National ; Steople Ichase competitors,, fell, and received such* injuries 'that he Iiad to bo ; destroyed/ Forester, too-'in the- same race was rathei.' jbadly knocked !about,iand for that, reason ;James Kearney ,was unable to ' ship' .the horse on Monday for this colony jiBhoin terided. Peter Keating escaped , with a | Student, ridden' by Johnny Cree, upset a great pot in Flamborough : for the Selling Hurdle Race, and the Ghost achieved a clever victory in the Flat . Race,.' after, a good finish with Plausible. '. ' V, -i .' ' i i Referring to the l-ecent Ilackay : (Queens land) Meeting, ' Venb' of the Capicornian has the following ;— The Mackay 'double'' f-fPioneer Handicap of £1 50, and Turf Club Handicap of .£300— fell to Mr. W.' Strick land's bay three-year-old, colt, Ben , Bolt, who was apparently never, extended .in either case; winning with 'ridiculous ease iu uubu uueua. xtaii xn/xu niw umu ujr iiir. Johu Finuie, arid is .'by', Newbold out of Lady Baldwin, by The Drummer (imp!) putof Britannia (imp.), by: Cathedral, etc. iAJB I said in my remarks last week,' the colt has been a great performer, and was very leniently treated, though I confess I , scarcely expect he would beat; Petroriel. so easily. ? Last year Ben Bolt gave Petrbnel a ,y doing 'in the Mackay Maiden. Plate, and Mr. Strickland's colt has' certainly shown that victory was no fluke. . ? ! It is said that Royal- Hampton; who ran third in the- Derby, is owned by ari. illus- trious three— Peck, the well-known- trainer; his Royal Highness the ..Heir Apparent ; and Mr. ? Maple, the celebrated furnisher and upholsterer. It is, moreover, said that ;he Prince landed nearly ^650,000, backing tlie horse to get a place. Of course, it is safe to divide this sum, as the Prince is a good business man, and it is a good s lump to run the chance of losing. With reference to the aboTe, I believe it is a fact that his Royal Hignoss won a good stake, backing Melton, and if ho backed Hainpton for a place as well, he must have had a real good innings. ' :..;.. The annual-report and balance-sheet of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club show that the overdraft has been reduced b'y more than ;E1500 during the period under notice. Seven meetings were held during the past year, each of which showed a substantial profit. ? ' -? ' ' '!.:??:: : i We (Adelaide Observer) are officially in formed by Mr. S.' Barnard ? that overtures have been'made by him, -;bn behalf of a company., that has beerij- forined under the title of the Amalgamated 'Racing and Coursing ; Company of South ''Australia; to tha lessees-of the Adelaide ' Racecourse (Messrs. Ferry and Blackler) to ? sell their lease so as to make one large racing- club in the colony.: ' They could 'not, however, come: to terms. rAnneeting. of. sporting men was held at Barnard's on Monday afternoon,, when it was ..decided to. form a plumpton at Moi-phettville to carry on rac ing and coursing' 'there.' A strong in fluential committeewas' formed, including many leading racing and' coursing sup porters. It ? ' is- -intended to purchase the freehold of Morphettville Course. ; I The balance-sheet of the Vicorian Racing Club was published, last i tyeek. It shows that the profit on the last Spring Meeting was .£12,622 17s lOd. The. loss pn;the last ^Tinter Steeplechase Meeting was £15 11s 2d ; on the New Year's Day . Meeting, ^£600 17s 3dj and on the Autumn Meeting, ^1,693 5s 3d. Members contribute nearly .£5000, and the bookmakers just over .£4000. The following were the salaries paid :— Secretary, iJ700; handicdpper, ifi500; : starter, ;6350j ranger, JE208 j president clerk, ^200 ; judge, .£50 ; assistant clerk, ,£80; bookkeeper, £50 ; surgeon's assis tant. .£02 10s. ' ? ' , ' ' :' . ! The well known steeplechaser, Taxaraxa cum, has (says the Victorian Sportsman) changed hands at a satisfactory figure, but tho . amount of purchase money paid, together with the name of the. purchaser, is reserved. lam informed that the old black is destined to carry a, '. red coat' to the hounds, a line of life he was accustomed to in South Australia, and in which ho was invariably in at the death. Taxaraxacum (or probably spelt Taraxacum), who is getting pretty well advanced in, years, was bred, I believe, by Mr. J. M'Guinness, of Corar station, near Kingston, in South Australia. He is by Little Fish/who was by the imported horse Fisherman, from Cerva. Little Fish is also the sire of ; Swordfish, Vho won the Great Eastern Steeplechase, at the Adelaide Racing Club's Birthday Meeting. It will interest readers of the Sportsman to know that little Guardfish, who is engaged in the Grand National Hurdle Race on Saturday next, is by S word fish, and that father and son have] met on two occasions, on; separate; courses, over hurdles, the son finishing in front, of bis father at their first encountering each other, . while 'the reverse .eventuated'; in their ; second sontest. ? ' ; ? ..'.., a. ! Mr. A. R. Robertson, who arrived . from Adelaide onMondayto attend tho Waterloo Cup and Grand National meetings, informs ; ' Asmodeus' that there is .no foundation for therumours which have gained currency relative to the alleged going wrong : of ? his Derby colt Dunlop. It is difficult to account for tho attempted knock put of the, ? son of Neckersgat and Etta, against whom -, 1000 to 6 was at one time offered. Mr.-' Robertson is prepared to accept 1000's' to' . 60 to the full extent of the books now open on the event. His owner informs me that Dunlop has made extraordinary . improver inent, and will strip one of tho. finest 3 year-olds of the geason. He will probably , be a starter for the Caulfield Guineas. , ? The richest Derby ever run was 'in, Lord ; Lyon'syear (1866), when tho, stakes:, amounted to .£7300. The smallest, field was -in1 1794, when only,. four ran, ; and Dmdalus won j the largest was in 1862, when thirty-four started, iand Caraotaciid, won. In 1820 the Derby was run 'during a hurricane that blow down the Ibooth's and covered the course with ' whirling frag ;ments of all kinda, Strangely enough, the. winner was named Saior, the] son of |Scud. Twice has it been run in a snow storm— in 1839. and 18G7— Bloouisbury and JHermit'syears.
