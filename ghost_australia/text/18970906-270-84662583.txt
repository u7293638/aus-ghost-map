Appalling Invention. We have been favoured with the picture of an appalling inventionâ€” literally 'made In Germany'- having for its object the preven- tion of premature burial. The machine is well calculated to add a new terror to the graveyard. It works on the slightest move- ment in the buried coffin, so that a passing van, or still more, a moving train, may by the oscillation it sets up cause the dread thing to work. And what happens to this. An iron box spings open; a black flag flies wildly upright, a bell clangs, and the glare of an electric lamp lightens the countryside. We can conceive nothing more trying to the nerves of the living man than the conscious- ness that these dread engines are scattered promiscuously over the churchyards of the land. We are not afraid of ghosts, but we frankly confess that we could not pass by a church at night if we thought that one of these [....] was nigh. - "Daily Chronicle"
