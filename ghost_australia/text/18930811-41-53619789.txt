THE ORPHAN HOME. TO THE EDITOR. Sirâ€” Your paper is often, by your courtesy, made thegmeans whereby an appeal is made to the charitaole on behalf of deserving objects. May I be allowed to pub another strain upon your kindness and ask leave to advocate the claims of the Orphan Home 'I This institution has for more than a generation carried on its work without aid or assistance of any kind from the Government, by the subscriptions and donations of those who have reco-ruised the unquestioned claim of tha poor littla waifs deprived of the love and care of those on whom, naturally, the duty of pro viding for their wants would have fallen. It can be imagined without much difficulty that in times of financial stress like the present mauy of those who have heretofore subscribed find themselves unable to continue to do so. Nearly all of our scanty funds aie locked in the Bank, and uules3 as3i9tance of a sub stantial character is given it i3 not unlikely that the committee may have to consider whether they will not have to close the institution. I cannot think, Sir, that the public of South Australia will allow this to be done if thev are made acquainted with the position in which the Home now stands, and therefore I wish to make this appeal to the public on behalf of the 'fatherless children.' Any subscriptions which may be sent to Mr. J. H. Cunningham, the Hon. Secretary, Flinders-street, or to me, will bo gratefully received and duly acknow ledged. lam. Sir. &c; F. SLANEY POOLE.
