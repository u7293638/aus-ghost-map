The Ladies' Gallery.* CHAPTER XVI. RICHARD RANSOM'S STORY CONTINUED. BY JUSTIN M'CARTHY, M.P., AND MRS. CAMPBELL PRAED. "I sprang to meet Tony; I all but hugged him in my arms, and I believe he was almost as glad to see me as I was to see him. I say almost, because of course there was a great difference between him and me. Tony was the brother of my Berenice, uud I was not the brother of any body Tony otired about. Still, the boy was honestly glad to see me. There again came in a difference, lie Haw me, and mo only; I saw him, and behind him, through him, around him, with him, I saw tho woods and the inlands and the rapids aud the falls of the Niagara region, aud I saw Berenioe, and I saw my first love. Well, lam not goiug to let my feelings get the better of me—at leaot, if I can. •' We had a great deal to say to each other. Wo had said a great deal before I ventured to ask him about his sitter. He told me she was very well, and I asked nothing more about her for a while. Ho told me in his vivacious rattling way how odd and dear and kind Sir Anthony and his wife were to Bereniuo and to him, and how little reason Beienico and he had to expect such kindness ; and how he, Tony, was to take to the bankiug business, and to be Sir Anthony's heir. But he grumbled about Berenice, always thinking that she ought to strive to do some thing for herself, to maintain her independence, and he t-aid the old pair would not hear of any thing of the kind. ♦ And after all,' said Tony, who was marvellously fond of slang, London and American slang preferred, ' it's all Tommy rot, you know ; for what does she want of making a living when nho has a living ready made for her ? Thono dear old people are ricn enough, and I shan't want it all for myself ; I don't think I am exactly such a pig as that comes to'—with much other voluble comment. " It seemed to me that Tony did not quite understand the real meaning of Berenice's desire to make a living for herself. Perhaps the old people did not understand it any better. I was sure I saw it clearly. Berenice was now always huunted by the fear that her husband would turn up and make some claim on her. A man of his stamp, an irredeemable scoundrel as I knew he must bo, would be far more likely to claim her if he found she was living aa one of a rich family than if she were, for example, a poor music teacher toiling alone in a small lodsring. She would be easily found if she were living with Sir Anthony and Lady Strange, and to such a man she would be the better worth finding. Besides, I felt satisfied that Berenico would be anxious not to involve her kind relatives in the trouble and shame of her husband's reappearance. All this only gave me a wilder longing to see her. Great heavens! to think, if that wretch wore not living, how happy we might be; how happy I could make her; how it would be a heaven of delight to me to find her a fitting home, to pour out my money into her lap ! What U the good of it now —the money and all r What can it do me? I only want one thing in tho world, and that I can't bav<;. Sometimes 1 wish I had never left the bush or found the gold. But I never wish, never could wish, that I had not *eon Berenice. Oh no ; and I never could wich that I had not neon Binbiim Jo. "All tli is time, of course, I was talking on with Tony. We began to make plans about dining together and going to various theatres, and having gallops in the Park and glorious pulls on the mer; and I threw out several hints about my desire to roako the near acquaint ance of Sir Anthony Strange and bis wife. I asked him what he had been doing with himself all this time in London, and what places he had seen, my chief object being to discover what places Berenice had been to, aud how she had passed her time. Somehow, I could not tell why, I begnn to fancy in a dim way that Tony had something on his iuiud which he wanted to confide to me, and about which, all the same, ho folt some hesitation in speaking. He did not seem quite bo muoh absorbed in his sister's affairs as I should perhaps have expected. He seemed to take her for granted, and to assume that she would be, according to his own phrase, ♦all right.' " ' Then she really wants to go and live by herself, Tony ?' ♦"Oh yes. But that's all nonsense. We'll not let her, you know.' " ' But bhe has a firm will, when she believes she is doiug right, doar Tony; I wouldn't be too sure of your power over hor.' " ' Oh, ehe couldn't believe that sort of thing would be right when once she comes to think over it.' " I was not cortain ; I became alarmed; the terror of her disappearing into space was too much for me. ' I murt try to see hor. She shall not act without hearing some advice and some appeal from me. She must take me into her counsel. Surely I have a right to claim that muoh from her r"' Suddenly I turned to Tony, and broke out in an abrupt way, which for a moment amazed the boy. ♦♦ ♦ Look here, Tony : I tell you I can't stand this sort of thing much longer. I must see your sister. You must manage it for me' ♦♦ Tony's faco became longer. ' Dear man, I wish I could : I would do that or anything1 ehe for you, if I could. But would she consent? —and we couldn't take her in, you know, could we V Wo couldn't scheme out so that she should come upon you seemingly uuawares. You wouldn't like to try that sort of game, I'm sure ?' ♦"I don't feel quite so sure about it. lam getting wild ; I would almost do anything. Why, what harm could itdo to hor I shouldn't make love to her—she knows that.* ♦' ' Then what good would it do to you, dear old chap ': Whut would be the good of looking at hor and payiug a few words about the nnet weather r' 11' Oil, Tuny, you dreadful boy ! You don't understand about such thingf. You don't understand the feelings of a man ■who is dppp, dead, in love with a woman. How on earch could you ?' ' The ri?ht of publication in Queensland of " The Ladieg' Gallery" has been purchased by the Brisbane Newspaper Company, Limited, " ' Look here, Rick Ransom; don't yon come the superiority over me too much in that sort of way. lam not quite a schoolboy, am I ? How do you know whether I am in love with a girl or whether lam not r' Tony's face oriiosoned like a woman's as he spoke. # " • Tony, you delight me ! You young villain, ifl it possible ? Oh, how oonfoundedly glad I am! And so you are in love? Who is she? Do tell. Is it a secret ?' " «Well, it's a sort of a secret just yet. You see, B he pretends not to take me seriously: she pretends to chaff me, and not to believe I am in earnest, and she always wants to turn me intj copy.' " «Turn you into what ?' " • Copy/ said Tony dolefully. 4 You don t know what copy is? Copy ia what literary people oall their manuscripts—their wntuigs, dWt you know ? That's the regular word for it' '"'She is a literary woman, then?' My mind misgave me. I had a vision of an untidy middle-aged spinster, with inky fingers and irowns that didn't fit. . . . , , " • She is,' Tony answered, with a lover s noble pride in his voice. ' Oh, I can tell you she's awfully olever; she'll make them sit up one of these dayß.' ** ' Sit up ? Who ? Whom will she make sit up, Tony ? , , , •««The public, my boy, and the publishers, and Mudie, and the rival authors—the swagger authors who aie big swells now ; but she 11 take them down pegs.' "«Ib she young? ia she pretty r I asked hesitatingly. , , "•Oh yes; she's quite young, and she s awfully pretty. You shall see her—there sno objeotion to your seeing her. 1 " I beoame suddenly filled with a thirst and rage for seeing Tony's young woman, because it seemed to me that I might perhaps happen some time or other to see Berenice with her. Oh, how I burned to make the acquaintance of Tony's young woman, even though she were to turn me into copy! I put this idea. "• Will she turn me into copy, Tony ? " ♦ She will,' Tony answered confidentially; *you may bet your bottom dollar on that. She'll turn you into copy, if she thinks you •re worth anything.' " • Meantime she turns your raptures into C°" 3''Ye^Baid Tony blankly; ' she says it's all nonsense, and that the only use she can make of it is to turn it into copy. It's a little trying, you know,' he went on, in a confidential way, «to be asked, when you have said something rery tender or emotional or that—to be asked to say it all over again and more slowly, so that she may get it down in her note-book and use it for copy.' " I admitted that love-making suoh ss this was indeed surrounded with difficulties, of which my reading or experience gave no account whatever. . " ' Dear old chap, I hope all will corae right in the end. And lam selfishly glad that you are in love, Tony.' " • Why so ?' " ' Because you will understand all the better what my feelings aro about ypur sister.' "«As if I didn't know! Why, I knew all that long before I saw—before I was in—l mean before I oame to England.' "' Well, you will sympathise with me; you will understand what I feel; you will know that I would give anything even to bo a moment in the Bame room with your Bister, or near her in the public street. Why, you like to be with your mash even when she ia turning you into copy.' "'Oh, come now—don't make fun of a chap.' "' My dear boy, I am not making fun. I am in anything but a mood for fun. Only I want you to feel for me, and to understand me and help me. I want you to ask yourself what you would do, und how you could Btand it if you were not allowed to oome near thia olever pretty girl who has got your heart.' " • Oh, by Jove, I couldn't stand that. No; see 'em all' . . " ' I am hungering and thirsting for a Bight of your sister; for a word from her; for the sound of her voice; to be near her, if only for a moment. Oh, dear fellow, do help me! Speak to her. Make atiy promise you like for mo; I'll not say a word that hints or breathes of love-making. Good God! she knows very well I wouldn't do anything of the kind—to hurt her, to shook her ! Oh no ! I know what I have to bear and what she has to bear, and we'll both bear it; but it isn't needful that I should never see her.' " I began to break down. I am a rough sort of feliow, but there are time* when I can no more oontrol my emotions than a child can ; and one of these times had come. Poor Tony seemed almost fri^htoned. " 'I'll do all if can,' he said earnestly and very gently. • I'll put it to her—just as you put it to me; only I don't think I shall be able to do it quite so well. I don't see really why you shouldn't meet—now and then, say—now and then—as friends.' "' I leave it all in your hands, Tony. Try whatever you think best; call in any counsel you think fit; only get me a chance of seeing Berenice.' "'Why don't you write to her yourself?' Tony asked. "'I haven't the courage,' I answered drearily. " ' Great Ciesar's ghost! the courage to write to Berenice!' For, in true brotherly spirit, Tony could not understand any one boing afraid to write to Berenice. He knew her little flashes of spirit and of temper every now and then, and they sometimes amused him and sometimes made him iuclined to get out of their way, but the idea of any one being afraid to write to Berenice about anything bad evidently never occurred to him. " ' You needn't mind a bit about that,' he eaid encouragingly. ' Berenice is a little hot sometime?, but it's over in a moment; and, even if nhe was angry when she Hat down to write, she'd have recovered her temper before ebe ftot through the first sentence, and things would be all right again.' "•It isn't that, Tony; it isn't that. I ffhould be only afraid of her not yielding to a possible first impulse; of her thinking things over and coming to the conclusion that we had better not meet.' "' Oh, that's it ? Well, we must try to have her argued out of that. Keep up your spirits, old pard.; we'll make a fight for you, anyhow. "Why did I not write to Berenice myself? For the reason I had given Tony—for one reason; but I had other reasons too. I felt sure that an appeal coming directly from me would put too muoh of an emphasis on the situation, if I may express my meaning in that way, and so act as a note of alarm in her ears. I could not writo hor a little informal letter, such as any stranger might do, and say, • Dear Mrs. Florence,—May I call on you some day soon, and have a cop of tea ?—Very truly yours, Bichard Ransom.' That would be the merest sham, play-acting, hypocrisy; and of course she would see through it, and she could not but be hurt by it. I could not play indif ferenoe to her. Then, if I wrote as I felt, could it fail to alarm her and make her think all the more that it was better we should not meet? But if other words—wordß from the world outside her and me, the world in which, happen what might, and even though we should never meet again, we stood isolated and alone— if words were to come of mere friendly sug gestion that there was no reason why she should not see me now and then as one who was willing to be a friend, since he oould be nothing more, might she not be the more readily induced to regard such a course as natural and free from danger ? Yes; I was not acting quite on impulse. I had thought it over again and again before I spoke to Tony. I had even a kind of idea that, although Sir Anthony Strange would not suggest anything of the kind to his niece, who was sheltering under his roof, yet if it were suggested to her by her brother, and he were appealed to for an opinion, his opinion would not be given against me. Who knows ? Perhaps even Lady Strunge, beginning by calling her husband a fool for his pains because he bothered about the affairs of other people, might let out in the end that she had herself been advising Berenice in oxactly the same way ? " Anyhow I was glad that I had enlisted Tony in my little conspiracy. May his love- Buit prosper with his literary sweetheart! But I felt some misgivings on that subject. For I began now to remember what Hal Clancy had been sayi' gon the steamer about Miss Fhilippa Dell, the young literary vampire who delighted in extracting copy from the hearts of her ad mirers ; and I felt sure this must be she, and that Tony's sudden passion was likely to land him, as he himself would have put it, 'in a cart.'"
