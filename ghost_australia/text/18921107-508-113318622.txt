TEUE UNIONISM. 2b the Editor. Sir, — I have been in Broken Hill during the whole duration of the .strike and a little earlier, and have had opportunities for observing the heroism and endurance of the bulk of the strikers. I wish I could express the same admiration of the leaders or conductors of the strike. It is the same old tale. The men look wan, desolate, and half starved, the women mere ghosts, the leaders sleek, debonair, and jolly. All the details of dis tribution of relief, coupon arrangements, &c;, are as familiar to the latter as the last to a cobbler ; and this is evidently not the first strike they have conducted. The contrast these worthies present may be in measure due to their more abundant pecuniary means, which is not improbable if the report in the town be correct that when bills are paid a deduction of 2\ per cent, is expected as 'the usual thing.' The question now agitating the minds of the Barrier miners is whether their leaders are not now giving more consideration to their own per sonal interests than to those of unionism. 411 admit we have done our best to uphold the great cause, and not a few eontend that our very wisest course now would be to give in before the mines have engaged the full number they could possibly onake use of, an 'event that seems likely to happen next month. We might then prepare for another struggle, if occasion were to present itself . If we delay, as the mines will be under obligation to stick to their newly imported employees, we may be left out in the cold entirely, which' really means that the Government will have to provide relief to about 15,000 people. Our leaders say : So long as our' outside subscriptions come in we must in honor hold out, as our generous supporters accord us this help because Broken Hill is just now the common battlefield of unionism. I submit, however, that we have now done all that in honor we are bound to, and that prudence and good generalship demand of us an immediate return to work to enable the contri buting unions to recruit their resources for future occasions of usefulness. We (the Barrier A.M.A.) have .£4000 of our own, and I for one do not think it right under such circumstances that we should sponge any more on our neighbors, but that the time has come for us to prepare to help them. No doubt our leaders would fail to get re-employment on bur mines, but what unionist exists in Australia .who would not do his best to help such by assisting them to secure billets elsewhere. I am anxious to learn whether provision is made to audit accounts during or soon after great strikes, and whether it would be legal for our leaders as unionists to form co-operative stores. It , occurs to me that ventures .of this .kind should be provided for separately. Lastly, as the parsons say, allow me to ask — now that the Labor party is so powerful and active — would it not be wise and conducive, to the interests of -true unionism to get a regulating law passed defining the legal operative limits of unionism, and par' 'ticularly to establish the principles— first, that no strikes, whether general or partial, shall take place without a ballot; secondly, that all unions should exclude candidates who belong to trades other than that each .represents? Thus tailors would - not be . found rigging a ? miners' union, nor' shoemakers a sailors ' One incidental &iv;*&tage; iof ibis arrangement, would be chat etnployers would then see that we existed for a purpose calculated to advantage them as well as to prevent their exploiting us. It would, in fact, be another huttress in jout fortifi cations. At present, in *he Broken Hill mines for instance, there have Ibeen since the star|; broken down bankers, law Men, ^erks^ 8q^tters,virtuous shoemakers, tailors, former soldiers, and mem* bers of trades ^ tei^F;;-lfl|erent; from that of the miner. ^ ,Fo* i a ;-ilwiir^into---^eBB'-l-e^il)8!ii.Ito be ehepherded^dhandledvery tenderly, yet they and Jheir '^nln^^n^to-^im^^m'^'|^^.,tte b-^e8* l^ io doubtj i tlfigr ''in^fe^j^w.'iniiifera;''.
