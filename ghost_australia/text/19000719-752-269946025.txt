“ Chanticleer,” Of all the bltdB from East to West, That tuneful are and dear, I love that farmyard bird the beat, They call him Chanticleer. Gold plnme and oopper plume, Comb of scarlet gay ; 'Tla he that scatters night and gloom And whistles back the day 1 He la the sun’s brave herald That, ringing his blithe horn. Calls round a world dew-pearled The heavenly airs of morn. 0 dear gold, shrill and bold, He calls through creeping mist The mountains from the night and cold To rose and amethyst. Black fear he sends it flying, Black care he drives afar ; And creeping shadows sighing Before the morning star. (’Tla 0, and woe, the lone ghost That glides before his call, And huddles in Its grave, so lost, Below the churchyard wall 1) The birds of all the forest Have dear and pleasant cheer, But yet 1 hold the rarest The farmyard Chanticleer. Bed cock or black cock, Gold cock or white, The flower of all tho feathered flock He whistles back the light.
