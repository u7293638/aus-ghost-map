PORTENTOUS. A STILLY calm broods o'er that crowd, Which once was rowdy, loose, and loud, And Gaunson's tongue that wildly wagged Is silent now as though 'twere gagged. No longer Longmore's shriek is heard, No longer wags his funny beard ; And Lalor sits in silent gloom, Like sorrow squatting on a tomb. No longer Burrowes—joking rogue— Delights us with his Irish brogue ! And silent too sit all the Smiths, As unsubstantial ghosts or myths?. For each has had his little say, And Johnny Tom has ceased to bray ; And Gavan's handsaw accents shrill Are silent, and the backbone's still; And the sweet Dove is voiceless too, And on his perch has ceased to coo ; And Paul Pry Coppin sleeps and nods, Or broods upon the pit and gods ; While Bent in heavy slumber drops, And dreams about his turnip tops ; And Mirams, Collingwood's Tomtit, Sits chatterless as Billy Witt; And Patterson's small voice is still, While Grant slips out to take a gill; And Teddy Cohen, sad and grim, Has ceased to speak and ceased to trim ; And virtuous Berry silence keeps, And each stonewaUer gapes or sleeps. Thus silence broods among the crowd That once were rowdy, loose, and loud. It is the calm—the failing breath That heralds in approaching death ; But though they feel the coming chill, The bristling chieftain bristles still; But he and they, and all their kind, Shall soon be scattered to the wind ; And then the incubus be gone Which rests this hapless land upon.
