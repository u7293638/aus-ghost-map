MISS SHAW AGAIN. Miss SHAW, the lady who recently ** did " Australia for the TIMES, has been contri- buting to that journal an article specially dealing with Australian democracy. State Bocialism, according to ber views, is the political ideal which is insisted on by the New Unionism in this part of the world. Plutocracy, she opines, has no ideal, and raises no public cry, whioh circumstance she regards as toe most dangerous feature of the future outlook. Miss Shaw is no doubt a very sharp and observant person, and has the knack of ex- pressing herself in fluent and well chosen language. But so far as the cablegram gives any impression of it, the article in question is not indicative of any extra- ordinary wisdom on the part of the fair critic. Indeed, it smacks pretty strongly of the merest commonplace, though doubtless delivered with the appropriate oracular ring. It needs no ghost to come from the grave to tell anybody that plutocracy has no ideal, and raises no cry. But certainly the conclusions which are to be drawn from that indisputable fact apply with tenfold force to England itself. The wonder, therefore, is that Miss Shaw should have found it necessary to point her moral sneciallv from Australia when she had a more striking-not to say shock- ing-example so much nearer at hand. This question of plutocracy is indeed the sphynxes riddle for modern civilisation as a whole, though at the same time it may be said that most of the so called socialistic attempts to alter it have hitherto been of the wildest and saddest kind. Miss Shaw is no believer in the pay ment of members system. It is interesting to learn that on such a subject the lady's ideas are so sensible, but the fact itself is of no great consequence to any one.
