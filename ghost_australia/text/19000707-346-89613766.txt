HAMPTON COURT PALACE. A most romantic story comes (an English ex- change says) from Hampton Court Palace, where an artist engaged on a sketch of some old Flemish tapestry has been annoyed or de lighted, according to the views he may hold on the subject of ghostly visitants, by the intrusion of a phantom hand between him and the tapestry. The intrusion has been so persistent and the vision so materialised that he has been enabled to make a sketch of the hand. It is said to have once belonged to Queen Catherine Howard. The Psychological Society should be on the spot and clear the matter up. The poor lady is evidently restless, and seems to be asking for something. Perhaps she has been inspired by the example of the dog, and is making an appeal for some ghostly food, although there is no mention of a phantom "little tambourine." Romance has not been altogether overwhelmed by modern scepticism after all. Ghosts seem to affect Hampton Court. Perhaps the Maze is getting stale.
