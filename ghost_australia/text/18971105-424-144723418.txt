He had t been dodging mJxra\ Sooth Island and ran into | Christebonh. Hare. Townahaad cot the offer j of about half m. cargo for a quick run to Port- 1 land, Victoria, *x-d took it aa there waa nothing I else risible. We got tha cargo on board and started, Tbe Belk had fair accommodation for pasaoDgen, bvt as we bad only five in the aaloun, a family of foor aod a duple man who I waa eruaaiog to m. Victoria bout, we bad lots of I room for gboata both below and in tbe cabin*. | The aecond nigbt after tearing Cbriat chixrah I waa on duty through tbe middle watch. Tbe aaei was like a mirror. Hie atars twfakled upoo it ai brightly a* in the aky. I wee laniug owwr the rail at the atarboard aide woaderiag wh^t. ou next luck would be wbeu I beard ao umoal sounfS behind me. Turning quickly, I saw one of the watch staggering against tha port aids oppoaite where I ctood, aa if reeling from a haary blow, 44 What's up aaow t n I abouted, rrnaaiaf over to wbetv tbe mas stood supfmrting bi*nMf again«t tbe ship'a skis. I foond it arms ooe of tbe n-cc named Jack son, a aimple fellow they called 44 Crank,' oa account of Ua oddities. ?* Hallo, Crax»fc ! ' I aaid, ** What now ? ** He pointed toward* the etrrn. where wa had a range of epare atorr-rooms oc each side under a covered deck vritb a spare steering-wheel in tbe centre. I couldn't aee the mao'a face, bot I coold tell from bis movements that be waa terrified. *4 What's op, why dooft you apeak f ' I said agaio, sharply. 4- The— the — chip's haunted, Ther — there's a : ghost — I seen it,** be stammered, pointing again to Lae stem. | *' What's tbe axiatter.P Don't be a fool. Whati have you seen ? ** I aaid peremptorily, annoyed at the man for what I thought bis stupidity. j A face— a girl *e ftce— a polo face,' be gxsped, ! moving ? JittJo - forward as if for protection. I 44 Don't be a fool, Crank ! Come along and show me wbere it it ?' I aaid, going tft. He slowly followed me. An oil lamp tbat we always bad alight at night to 1 ight the space about the spare wheel waa burning dimly, I looked into the gloom beyond it. There waa nothing to be aeen and was not a sound except tbe hissing of the bufibles in onr wake a a they rose front the propeller. 44 What did you see P~ I aaid again to Crank aa he atnmftled txp to me. 44 A pale face — it was there, abaft tb^wheel ; a girt'a face witb. a shawl round it,**} V aaid in a tone that left no doubt in my mind aa to the honesty of his declaration. 4-Noneeoie! You're dreaming man,' I aaid, ; lifting dowo tbe* itamp and casting its beams into ' tbe s torn-way. ?' No dreaming/' he answered, abaJbng his head. 4*I11 take my solum oath, it waa a giri'a face, pale, and witb a ahawl round it.' 44 Well, them'a neither girl nor face bere now,' 1 said, 44 is there P' 44 No, but I aeeu it,' persisted Crank. M Come along forward, n 1 said, *' and don't aeare the ahip with tbat lubberly yarn.** It waa jugt a quarts to four. I waa taking a last turn round tbe abip to see if all was right for tbe starboard watch whicb waa coming on at foor o'clock. I had been forward and waa coming aft along the port *ide. As I passed the galley I hesard the sound of feet, and directly after fcbree of tbe watch tumbled oo top of me. 44 What's thin ?' 1 said, sharply, recovering my balance and planting my baek against the aide. The men had not seen me in the dark and had oollided with me in their flight. Tbey were breathless. 44 Something's there aft, sir ! ** aaid one of tbem pointing astern. 44 Where— whw-t is tt 1 ' I asked, alarmed at this aecond demonatr&tion.; 44 A woman'a betd-a fhoat, r aMwered ttie I man. . 1 ' Aye !
