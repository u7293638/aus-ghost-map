Another night, a repetition- of the first, Cynthia returned to Johu's house, takmsr Sarah, with her. iSquim E'kius felt greatly relieved at first ; ; but when a swtek had passed he began to Ibng for -company, and ' hailed -with - pleasure the : night's ! sojourn - of ?» , passing iKddier. To his : annoyance rthe transient guest- inquired in the | mornmg the meaning of th^ socking he had heard. The squire explained and the news thit the Hariie houtfc -was wjU^n'c ..wings.
