Photographing ,the Un seen. D-m't !m* so matter- of-fnet, writes a enri'HipoinJfiit.

Now there iB nothing extra ordinary in this you will Bay. Wait a moment. The photographer went to the house during the absence of the family an.1 took a photograph of the empty study. When the photograph was developed, to his astonishment, thero sat the master of the house in the arm-chair as I have described, but minus bis legs. Two doys after there came a letter to say that the old gontleman had died that very hour iu a far-olf watering place of dropsy in the leys, I think it was. I well remember Mr Stead telling me of someone — it may have burn he.hiin»i-lf photograph ing in an ancient church, and when tho plate «as developed there distinct ly n ns' the 'figure of a moditeval monk hooded aud cowled.
