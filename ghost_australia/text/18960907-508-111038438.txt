The Bival Swains. W^ left the Bunn road, turned downhill to-; warels .' Curleck, passed a great stone- walled ': farmhouse set nakedly on the hillside, whirl-' ed through a little oak plantation and across a single-arched bridge; -then suddenly came to a etretch of level,- sandy road with broad grass margins on either hand and willow hedges, and beyond these Iow4ying tracts of pasture and meadow land that ran tin the one side along Thraena River, and extended on the other back to the shores of Clackan Loueh. A beautiful country it is just there, half-way from the white gate to Cnrleck woods, well wooded and watered, green and smiling, with white farmhouses scattered plentifully over-its face and dark patches ol crop-land here and there between the hedges, and round all dim and blue, the mighty ring of the giant mountains. Bat, like avferaeson ?ottaeHfloQ.^and owner of a high-stepping horse, my friend James Hicks had more eye for the road and iis rate than tor the hills and their tteattttes; 3U-r* would lie allow any words of mine in praise -of the jjsl turaL beauties o£ theJaaaSJto slitt trough his mind tmrebuked.

' ^B^^JEhaCpa^fep^evsi* there?' said he,;ana^olMea^6 the right with ate ]ifa$ip- *!&n;*^©'»e£'-%efc^*Iion^*ith«r* beyond?' and he wifgged his head to the left 'An' ye remarked the little stream we crossed back there wi' the bridge over it? Well, sir, if ye look hard at them, these'll, tell their own story. Suppose the sky opened there above your headr-as it does often enough, God knows! — an' spouted rain for six mortal days at a time, what'd happen? Eh? Well, I'll tell ye The mountain there beyond'd send the water roarin' down upon us; the lakes above in Cavan'd . swell an* come slap at us; the hills there'd do their duty; then up rises the river, an' the lake, an* the stream, over comes the water wi' a jump, an' when you'd be. eatin' your supper there's a lake spread there between the hills, an' a canal three feet deep runnin' here over the sroad between the hedges. Yes— aw, I know it! That's the time to see how beautiful the country looks; that's the time to make the fanners kick their heels wi' joy— wi' heir hay in wisps, an' their turf in mud, an' their potatoes flooded. How comfortable you'd feel yourself now if ye wanted to get to Curleck, an' ye had no friend to drive ye, an' the water was as deep as your. chin on the road, an' ? Aw dear, oh dear!' James cried and slapped his knee; then, in true Irish fashion, changed his tune quick from dolor to laughter. 'Aw dear, oh dear! to think o' that 6tory comin' into my head all at once. Sure it's wonderful the strange tricks one's brain-box plays one! The queerest thing it was happened along this very road, sir, one winter's night when the floods were up. But maybe ye know the story o' George Lunny's stilts an' what came o' them?' . I shook my head; so James leant his elbow on the cushion of the carwell, crossed his legs, and having forked his horse into a steady trot went on with his story. ? ? . ''Twas a good many . years ago that the thing happened, an' 'twas in the same whiter that the big wind blew the roof off the hay shed above at Emo. Powerful the flood was that tune, an' four feet deep it lay on this very road; eo that if ye wanted to get to Cur leck an' hadn't a boat, an' hadn't time to get round the lake there, ye had to take your life in your fist, tuck up your coat tails, an', wi' the tops o' the hedges to guide ye, just wade for it Faith, 'twas a funny sight o' market days to see the ould women comin' along here on their asses' carts wi' their skirts over their ears, an' the water squirtin' out below the tail-board, an* the unfortunate beast o' an ass trudgin' unconcernedly through it all wi' its head an' ears showin' above the water; an' a funnier sight 'twas at times to set George Lunny an' the rest comin' through it on their stilts. Like ghosts they'd seem o' times when dusk was comin'; if a wind was blowin' ye'd think they were drunk, that wobbly they'd be; an' at the deep parts, be the king! but it's miracles ye'd think they'd be at, an' walkin' on the water. Anyway, it's about George I must tell ye. 'He used to work below in the gardens at -Lord Louth's— a middle-sized, good-natured kind o' fellow, harmless enough an' powerful good to his widow mother. An' o' course he has. a wee girl to go a-cpurtin'; an' b' course there's another man that's sweet on-her, too; an' 0' course she liyedi$}ia.t side of the flood — ye'll eee the house in a minute when we get to the woods— an' they lived this side. So ye'll see that what wi' crossin' the flood o' nights to. see her, an' the trifle o' jealousy between themeslves, they had enough to keep them alive through that whiter. 'Well, one night when George had had his supper, aiT a wash an' shave, he takes his stilts across his shoulder an' sets out to see the wee girL 'Twas a fine, frosty night, wi' a three-quarter moon shinin', an' when George gets to the edge o' the flood there be hind the b'ridge, who should he see but th' other fellow sitting on the copin' stones. ~ ' 'Aw, good evenin', David' (that beta' the rival's name), says George, resttn'his etilts ag'stthe opposite wall o' the bridge an' pull in' out his pipe. : 'It's a fine night now.' ? ' ?''If is eo, George,' answers David, not speakin' too friendly like, still without any ili^ .will, lor so far 'twas a fair race between the two. 'It is so.' ; '?'Itts a cowld seat ye've got there this frosty night David,' says George, strikin' a 'match. ''..'?'?' ??? : ? '*Aw, it is,' 'answers David. 'I just daun dered down to look at the wild ducks on the wing, an* smoke me pipe ' ' 'Ye hadn't a notion to cross the flood, now, David?' asks George, in bis sly -way. ' 'Aw no,' says David *Aw, not at alL' ** *AjY answers George, catchin' hold o' the stilts. 'Well, I'm goin' that direction for an hour or so Anythin' I can 'do for yeT '*Ah no, -3eorge,' says David; 'ah a$ 'cept Vm sorry I x»uldn't— well, to -tell the truth, 1 ?was thinkin' o* goin' down Curleck way the night t»nly Jan Fatmer, hsA lotflfc lake Jiim! has gone off wj' the cot after the dueke atf I can't cross..' -To h& eontinned.-
