A Novel Industry. ' WOKDERS," says Mrs. Malanrop, *â€¢ will have never done ceasing.' The Herald, of July 14th, gives an account of housebreaking at Hawthorn. One Alfred Ulman, a Swiss, broke into the house of a Mr. Thomas Barker. The Herald writes, " It appears that between the hours of seven and eight o'clock on Sunday evening the deceased forced an entrance into the house. If deceaseds take to burglary it will mean simple ruin to the locksmith interest. Love is said to laugh at locksmiths. Deceaseds don't laugh. It is not a ghostly habit. But they doubtless smile, if of a burgling turn of mind, at the best efforts of our most skilled artisans. Ghosts can go slap through an iron door with as much ease as a circus lady jumps through a paper hoop. A firm of burglars who succeed in engaging the services of a housebreaking deceased may consider their fortunes made.
