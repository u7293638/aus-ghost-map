Penola held ita annual racing carnival on Wednesday, and the sport passed off success fully, the only circumstance calling for regret being tbe accident to MacGregor referred to below. The weather was intensely hot in the forenoon, but later on a cool breeze sprang up, which waB very welcome. The attendance was about the same as usual-from 400 to 500 people. The various officers exerted them selves to bring matters off pleasantly, a ttsk in which they succeeded pretty well. Mr. 6. Riddoch officiated as judge, Mr, D. Campbell as starter, Mr. W. Davis as clerk of the course, and Mr. J. Darwent as secretary, Mr. T. H. Artaud as assistant secretary, tad Mr. D. MacKay as clerk of the scales. Sport began with the Trill Stakes, for which four started. Murra was favorite, but Bhe was put down by Banjo, a horae whioh ran second for a similar stake at the Mount last week, A protest was entered againBt the winner for having won publio money, but the result has not so far been made known. Eight out of the twelve on the card weighed out for the Hurdlerace. Several of the candidates were well backed, but the race caused a surprise by the viotory of Darkness, the outsider of the party. An unfortunate mishap oocurred to W. MacGregor in this event. He was riding Three Stars. Darkness had jumped the hardle in front of the stand, and MacGregor followed ia his wake, bat the horse took off too tar away, and striking the hurdle, turned a com* plete somersault, and threw MacGregor hearily lo the ground. It was feared he was killed, bat Dr. Jermyn, who fortunately happened to be present, did what he oould for the sufferer, and after a oareful examination wan hopaful that MacGregor would pull through. He remained partially unconscious the whole after noon, and later in the evening was taken to the Mount Gambier hospital, where he now lies. He will reoover, but it may be some time before he is about, as he got a severe shaking. The Fenola Handicap brought out six runners. Conscript was the favorite. He justified the confidence reposed in him by winning hand somely. The Pony Race was started from the five furlong post instead of the six, and had to be run over again, British Ltd winning on both ocoasionB. Five was the main in the Flying Handicap, in which Conscript again asserted his superiority, but he was kept going by both Murra and Her Ltdyship, both of whom ran well. Three started for the Foroed Handicap, which Stockings won from Mnrra and Gort. Details are appended TRIAL STAKES, C( & sova. D stance, three-quarters ot a mile.
