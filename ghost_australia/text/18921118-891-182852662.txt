Late Lord Tennyson. It was reported that on. tho day of his death Lord Tennyson, was reading Shakespeare's " Cymbeline." A correspondent in tho London Chronicle of October 7 has endeavoured to find I out what it was that Lord Tennyson was | anxious to road in that play. In a letter to the editor the correspondent asks:— What was Tennyson looking for yesterday in " Cymbeline ?" Was it not— "As the fits and stirs of his mind Could best express how slow his soul sailed on, How swift his ship."—Act it., scene 4. Or— " Clay and clay differs in dignity Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick-"— Act iv., scene 1. As likely— * "Lot ns bury him, i And not protract with admiration what Is now due debt."—Act iv., scene 2. Nay, there is no doubt, after ull, it was this— " Fear no more the heat o' tho sun, Nor the furious winter's rages; Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone and ta'on thy wages: Golden lads and girls all must, As chixuuey sweepers, como to dust. Fear no moro the frown o' the great, Thou art past the tyrant's stroke; i Care no more to clothe and eat; To thee tho reed is us the oak: The aoeptre, learning, physic, must All follow this, and come to dost. "Fear no more the lightning flash, Nor tho all-dreaded thunder stone ; Fear not slander, censure rush; Thou host finished joy and moan; All lovers young, all lovers must Consign to thee and come to dnst. No exorciser harm theo 1 Nor no witchcraft ohorm thee 1 Ghost unlaid forbear thee I Notliing ill como near thee! Quiet coiiHummution havo: 'And renowuM be thy grave." —Yours truly, John Grreonleaf "Whittier was a shoemaker ia his youth, and ono, as results show, who was too smart to follow the odvioe of an antiquated adage.
