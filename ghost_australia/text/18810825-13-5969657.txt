CITY LIFE IN CORINTH. The Bishop of Melbourne continued his lectures on "The Gospel and City Life of Corinth" yesterday afternoon in St Paul's Pro-Cathedral, Swanston street. There was D very large attendance. Bishop MoonnoDSE said-When the history of the world there are certain epochs which may be styled creative; which mark the introduction of new intellectual, moral, and spiritual forces into human life Of all these epochs, the most remarkable is that which witnessed the birth of the Christian church The establishment of that church was nothing less than the beginning of a new creation A new spirit then passed into the torpid body of humanity, a new life awoke amongst its dying members, and everywhere the signs of it announced themselves in startling spiritual phenomena, in high-wrought feelings, in ecstatic expressions, in mighty deeds If Christianity were, in fact, such as it is described to us in the gas- pels nothing less than a descent of the Son of God to earth to secure the redemption and sanctification of man-this first result of it is nothing more than might have been expected in the pure soul of the Lord Jesus the Divine spirit dwells peacefully as in its earthly home There is no disturbance in His inner, there is no disharmony in His outward life, because in Him there is a perfect conformableness between the Divine spirit and its earthly organon. Something of this quietness and even flow of feeling is still perceived in those of His disciples whom He had personally trained and prepared for their offer They shared, indeed, in the mighty inspiration anduphftingof Pentecost, and moved thenceforward on a higher plane of spiritual thought and feeling , but still in their life and notion we feel something of the level energy which we had noticed in their Great Master St Paul, greater, perhaps, by nature and culture than any of them, passes into the Durne kingdom at a bound , not without violent perturbations, as we should expect And thenceforward, m biB visions and ecstacies, even, perhaps, in the intensity of his feelings, and the mystical cast of his thought, we seem to catch reverberations of that heavenly voice which called him so suddenly on the way to Damascus Such facts seem to suggest to us, what in itself is most likely, that the inrush of the new life of Christianity would be marked by most of wonder and perturbation precisely where the earthly organ was least prepared to receive it In Gentile churches, therefore, and especially in such a church us that of Corinth, gathered out of a population in tellectually excitable, and deeply tainted with all the superstitions and immoralities of a dying paganism, we should expect to find the stream of spiritual life troubled by stormy phenomena We have already noticed some of these, and to day our attention is called to an abuse of those remarkable spiritual gifts which betokened in the apostolic age the presence and power of the Holy Ghost We must recognise in these classes a two-fold element-the one Divine, and the other human The Divine element is the inspira- tion of the Spirit of Jesus , the human element is that capacity of the soul of man for immediate intercourse with God which makes speaking with tongues, or prophecy, a possibility As we are to consider to day the Corinthian abuse of spiritual gifts, and can- not look for the source of this abuse in their Divine element we shall be principally concerned with the inquiry, what is that state of the human soul in which direct communion with God is a possibility and how is that state related to the different extraordinary gifts in the Church of Corinth It IS agree! that all those remarkable spiritual gifts of feeling, intellect, and will, enumerated in the 12th and 14th chapters of the First Epistle to the Corinthians, were received and exercised in a state of ecstacy Now the capacity of the soul for ecstatic communion with the unseen world may be illustrated from many quarters It was recognised and affirmed even by heathen philosophers , notably by the Neo Platomsts Philo, in the first century, pronounces the intention of God to be the highest step in philosophy and he affirms that the sage can only then attain to it when completely renouncing himself, and leaving behind his finite self consciousness, he resigns himself unresistingly to the divine influence ' Plotenus in the third century, taught that the great business of man was to return to God, and that this return is to be accomplished partly by virtue and philosophy thought, but principally by ecstatic intuition The Neo Platomsts used to prepare them selves for this intuition by acts of prolonged abstraction, ' chaining down the senses from every sight and sound, and even the mind from every thought, till consciousness of time and place vanished,' and the soul found itself in the purely ideal world, face to face with the Eternal According to the testimony of Porphyry, his disciple, Plotenus attained to the condition of unification with God four times during the six years of his acquaintance with him These instances are only interesting, as showing that pagan pi losophers recognised the existence of a capacity in man for aviators to direct communion with God Thnrhr by a missile of the Middle Ages entertained a similar persuasion Mauer Eckart deemed himself to have found, by direct ecstatic in tuition, the perfect repose of a spirit in absolute union with God The movement of the soul towards God is as irresistible, he holds, as that of the stone to the earth, or that of fire to the heavens in the interesting life of John Saulter, by Nicolas of Basle, we are told that after great beatings and BConrgingB, and prolonged prayer, the great Dominican suddenly lost consciousness, and when he was left to himself again, he saw a supernatural mighty wonder and sign inso much that he could have cried with St Peter, " Lord, it is good for me to be here ' ' At another time, after great sickness of body and soul, and strong crying and tears, he lost consciousness in like manner, and when he came to himself again, ' he was possessed of a new strength and might in all powers outward and inward, and had also a clear understanding in those things which aforetime were dark unto him How often such experiences as these are recorded in the history of the Wesleyan and other revivals we all know quite well And many living men can testify that after deep conviction of sin, and long crying in the dark to a God who seemed to hide Himself, they have been brought out, with a miraculous suddenness, into such overpowering, over flooding joy and love, that it has seemed to them like a passing into the light of God's very presence A wonderful light has seemed to fall on God's word, insomuch that it has appeared to them like a new message from God A wonderful love of Christ has been shed abroad in their hearts, and therewith BO mighty a longing that all men might share their peace and joy, that they were im- patient till they could summon others to the heavenly feast They seemed to love all things - all heaven and earth - from the most glorious angel to the meanest beggar, yea, and to the very beasts and birds, as though the coming of God into their Boats had enlarged them with some touch of the Divine definiteness Now, all this is psychologically true, and whatever of the merely physical may attend and obscure such manifestations, one thing is certain that to the consciousness of those who have been their subjects, they did open a new heaven of truth and joy and Divine love, which irradiated life with an undying glory The late Charles Kingsley was no fanatic-he was accused, indeed, of holding nothing better than a muscular Christianity And yet what are his words about those medieval mystics of whom I have spoken ' Would it not have been better, he says, to have examined patiently, charitably, and prices generally, what they really were, and what they were not By so doing, I believe men would have found in these has sties and saints, after all bodily illusions, all nervous fan tastes, all pardonable confusions between the object and the subject, had been eliminated, there still remained, in each and every one them, one of the very loveliest and noblest of human characters, and on that discovery the question must have followed-was that, too, the product of disease And to that there can be, I trust, but one answer from the many. If here and there a man shall be found daring enough to assert that the most exquisite developments of humanity are (grounded on a he that its seemingly lovelies flowers are but fungi, bred of corruption, then the general heart of humanity will give their cynicism the lie, and answer, not so far IS too beautiful and the righteous to be born of aught but God I Here is the grand argument for the reality of such ecstatic intuition as that of which Mr Kingsley speaks It is the basis and inspiration of some human lives What they are they are in virtue of their union with God And those lives are amongst the noblest and loveliest which have ever lighted the darkness of this world Can, then the light which they have caught and reflected be anything less than Divine' Does not the reality of their holiness vindicate the reality of their ecstacy / And if that be true of the present time, is it not yet more clearly true of apostolic days and apostolic men' Can anyone study the life and character of St Paul, and doubt for a moment that the spirit which inspired it was Divine ' When, then, he tells us that all he was he was in consequence, of direct ecstatic communion with the Saviour, can we doubt that this communion was real and potent-whatever interpreta- tion we may put upon the outward form by which it made itself known to the senses and mind of the apostle' But now. if ecstatic communion with the risen Saviour was possible to St. Paul and St. Paul's disciples, is I it not certain that this communion would elevate every faculty of his soul, and colour and transform the whole life? Are we not prepared, therefore, to hear that it affected the emotions of the early Christians, and elevated the expression of those emotions as in the gift of tongues, that it affected their intellect, and so elevated its operations as to raise them into ecstatic knowledge and wisdom, and into prophecy, the fitting expression of such faculties ; or, armin, that it so affected their will as to issue in powers of healing administration and the like? I grant that we cannot understand such states and acts of the soul But when the first mighty effusion baptism, or as it literally is in one passage, drenching of the Spirit, had passed, the Christian church became too like Gideon B fleece when it had been wrung But still, if we have no doubt about the posal bility and reality of ecstatic communion with Christ now, we can have none about the pea Bibihtv, at least, of such intenser effects of that communion as the mightier effusion of its Spirit is said to have produced in apostolic days It is harder, no doubt, to understand the possible abuse of such gifts And yet neither should this be impossible, if we only remember the previous history, faith, and habits of those on whom the gifts were conferred They were men who had recently been pagans, who had been brought up in habits of deceit and immorality, whose highest thought had been to increase their own pleasure and personal dignity The tincture of these pagan habits and feelings they had brought over into the Church, and it was not in a day, nor even in a generation, that the Spirit of God would turn Jacob into Israel Of all the spiritual gifts, ' glossolalm' was that which was most popular at Corinth And if we only understand what it was, we shall have little difficulty, I think, in divining the reason Of ecstacy there were three principal kinds First, that mystical ecstacy of which I have already spoken, in which the soul gazeB directly on God and the eternal world Secondly, there was prophetic ecstacy In this the seers intention was of another object It was not of God in Him self, but of God as He movements providential and redeeming grace in the life of states, churches, and individuals Behold ing this with purged eye, piercing to those real principles and powers which, hidden from the eyes of sense yet really fashion and determine our outward life, the prophet lifts the veil of time and sets his awe struck hearers among the solemn realities of eternity There was yet a third kind of ecstacy what might be called emotional ecstacy the exaltation of the feelings into such an intensity of Divine love, that they must express themselves by means of words, intelligible or unintelligible, in prayer and praise The first of these may be called ecstatic insight, the second ecstatic revelation, the third ecstatic adoration Now, when a man felt himself rapt into this intensity of Divine love e-a love so intense that common words could not tell it any more than words ever can tell the intenser emotions what was more natural than that these overstrained feelings should find relief in such sounds (unintelligible by any but those in emotional sympathy with the utterer), as St. Paul describes in 1 Cor xiv 6 It was an inspired soliloquy, an act of inarticulate adoration addressed only to God, the love of the babe going forth to its father in inarticulate cooings which utter the feelings of the heart, without the intervention of forms of the understanding How delicious an enjoyment how signal a distinction, to be lifted thus visibly and publicly into communion with heaven ! The mystic gazes upon God, but it is in silence and secrecy The prophet utters indeed his message, but it is in intelli Bible words, and men might mistake their grow for the eloquence of the merely human orator. Buttheseloudsweotsouuds, so power ful, BO entrancing, BO commanding stirring the very depths of the soul, like the blast of an angel's trumpet who could mistake these who could fail to recognise that the soul which is uttering them is caught up into Paradise ' But, then, conceive the confusion and tumult which would arise from several of these utterances breaking forth at once, crossed, as they might be, with more than one loud ecstatic prophesying It is very difficult for us to present the scene to our mind with even an approach to reality Chrysostom confessed that as early as the fourth century there was an utter ignorance of the facts referred to by the apostle, which were such as used then to occur, but now no longer take place ' If, again, we call to our aid facts with which we are more familiar, such as the loud shoutings and rearing, hysterical, cataleptic which used to follow the preaching of Wesley, Berndge, or the later American revivalists we shall probably get a class of phenomena far coarser and far more repulsive than those we are examining for the tongue speakers at Corinth were not ignorant profligate, stricken down suddenly by an unfamiliar flower in the midst of their sins, but more or less saintly members of the Christian Church, giving utterance to their feelings of adoration Perhaps the nearest parallel furnished by modern times is that of the so called gift of tongues among the followers of Mr Irving Here we are told of utterances in tt voice distinguished for its superhuman power and sweetness ; utterances which, if not involuntary were at any rate produced, to the consciousness of the speaker, by a power without him, Sometimes embodying words of known languages, but most commonly consisting of miscellaneous words and sentences, or even nothing better than a jargon of sounds The power, however, of Buen utterances was sometimes very com manding, coming forth with all the majestic impressiveness of a divine oracle, and seem ing to summon the hearers into the very presence of God Opinions as to the origin of this glossolalia varied, some entertaining no doubt that it was inspired by the Holy Ghost, while others believed, with Mr Baxter, who was himself possessed with the gift, that it was of diabolic origin If, however, we would realise the appearance of church life at Corinth, we must not be afraid to look the facts in the face, and to acknowledge that it may have presented scenes of disorder, even worse than those reported of the Irvingites congregations For most of the disciples of Corinth were not only won from Paganism, but also from the ranks of the poor and ignorant And we know that ignorant men, when they are excited, are no more accuse tomed to restrain the expression of their feelings than children. They speak loudly, in an excited manner ; they use words which are coarse, and sometimes almost profane They are in the habit of projecting their feel ing into the form of visions and voices, which they imagine that they see and hear. If they are exercised as Rub man Merawm was, by doubts on the subject of the Trinity, they are not unlikely to have the vision as he had, of a great stone, wherein were carved the like ness of three men's countenances,' and to hear a voice saying that just as there were three faces in one Stone, SO may there be three persons in one essence Tertullian suggests to us the operation of this tendency to give outward form and embodiment To thoughts and feelings, which have been deeply impressed, in the account which he furnishes of the Montanist prophetesses, in whose vaticinations he was himself a devout believer One of these, he tells us could discern men's hearts , she had visions of angels, and of the Lord himself, and on one remarkable occasion, of a soul in bodily Shops, the full particulars of which he gives He adds that matter and opportunity were afforded her by the prayers, hymns, and sermons of public worship, and refers for justification of all this to the promise that there should be spiritual gifts in the church Of course such instances as these furnish us with nothing better than imperfect, and, in many respects, perhaps misleading illustrations But they help us to give life and reality to the apostles picture, and to understand somewhat better those singular scenes when many were prophesying together or speaking together in loud unintelligible sounds, so that there was danger of unbelieving spectators thinking the disciples mad What, then, are we to BUJ of these things ' Shall we turn away from them in disgust as the mere ravings of fanaticism , or, with the Stoic or Epicurean sneer, that the vulgar are generally extravagant' If we do, we shall be gravely mistaken As Professor Jowett said There was more than he had eyes to see, or than was dreamed of in a philosophy) like this Not only was there the superficial appearance of poverty and mean ness, and enthusiasm, from a nearer view of which we are apt to shrink, but under neath this, brighter from its very obscurity, purer from the meanness of the regiment in which it was apparelled, was the life hidden with Christ in God There, and there only, was the power which made a man humble instead of proud, self denying instead of self seeking, spiritual instead of carnal, which made him embrace, not only the brethren, but the whole human race, in the arms of his love We do not believe in the Gospel to day because of these wonderful phenomena, hut in spite of them, because we see behind them a Divine power which could regenerate the human heart, a calm wisdom which, in the Apostle Paul, could re bake their excesses, and the vain or envious thoughts to which they gave rise, a spiritual insight, which, recognising all in them which was good and profitable, could yet calmly measure their relative importance, and which, taking for its standard what was spiritually profitable rather than what was outwardly splendid, could put tongue speaking, in which a man edified himself, beneath prophecy, in which a man edified the church, and these and all other gifts beneath (219 footstool of Pine and over abiding charity. Christianity was, no doubt, responsible for the disorders which the apostle rebukes, in the sense that but for the mighty wing stroke of its divine spirit, the dead and despairing spirit of man would never have awoke to the life and energy which inspired them Such men could not have been so mightily aroused from their torpor without exhibiting in their ecstacy something of the old nature which was being renewed All that, however, belonged to the carnal soul, on the depths of which the creative Spirit was moving BO mightily ' Christianity,' it has been well said by Isaac Taylor, ' rescues its own out of these tumuli tuouB assemblages and then, content with its indisputable triumphs, leaves the am biguouB residuum in the hands of scoffers or of philosophers, to be dealt with as they please or can Not unfrequently in these am a we are presented with the likeness of this residue, in the shape of visions and mutterings, of floating bodies and spiritual voices, and asked to believe because of them Our answer is that they are difficulties, and not witnesses, to faith Where is the life that lies behind them ' Where is the power to turn him into purity, impudence into piety, Bel fishness into love Let us hear the voice of some apostle setting spiritual truth above outward wonders, giving to mystical voices and visions the lowest place, demanding that the spirits of the property shall be subject to the prophets, and never suffered to display themselves but according to the rules of a Divine order, and for the profit of the whole community Above all, give UB a man who, at home, among visions and trances, and speaking with tongues more than all, can yet Boar away above all earthly limitations, proclaiming with the voice at once of a saint and a philosopher, that all these wonders are of time, and shall vanish with the time v vision, that knowledge, as we have it now, is only like the blurred and distorted images seen through ancient mirrors that tongues are only like the babbling of infants trying, and vainly to utter the joy and wonder within, that prophecy is only from a part-from the earthly side of human existence, that the time shall come when all shall vanish away, the only thing akin to Gods infinity being that love to which nothing in unseen to which nothing is future , which seeketh only the weal of others, binding together brother and brother, men and angels earth and heaven, and all with golden chains about the feet of God " Give as this, and we shall have something as great as the Christianity of the first century, a gospel for the whole world '
