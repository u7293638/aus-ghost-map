"THE VOLUNTEER ENCAMPMENT MT DEAR JACK-I was very sorry that your busi- ness prevented you from mustering with us for the | " camp," and sent you so tar up countr) just at this particular juncture I can fane) with what eager- ness ) ou seized the Mercury as it came to hand for news of the encampment, only to be considerably disappointed It was a strange oversight that our northern organ did not secure the services of a " special," I am sure that there were a round dozen in the ranks of the Maitland companies that would have done the work con amore A letter from me anent our proceedings ma) not then, be unaccep table I do not pretend to give )ou a scientific descnption ) ou must be content with m) running impressions, and take them for what the) are worth I am rather lat9, but perhaps "it is better late than never" You have lost both plea- sure and profit in not attending Should such an opportunity of an insight into practical military training be offered on a future occasion every volunteer in the country should take advan- tage of it On Thursday morning (10th) our company mus- tered in creditable numbera, dressed in scarlet, with rifles as bright inside as new silver, and brasses of accoutrements shining like pale burnished gold Upon our return these same uniforms and accoutre- ments presented a sorry spectable-the scarlet epata wet and stained, the nfle barrels as black as a long railway tunnel, the brasses green, and our boots mud-bedabbled As we marched upon thia fine morning to the railwaystation, our spintsrose high, and we were moved with a considerable imount of military ardour. On board the steamer the Maitland Companies mustered in giod numbera Weat M ut 1 indas usual taking the lead, the Newcastle com- panies red and blue were but poorly represented, and Singleton sent but a dozen warriors in grey The passage to S)dney was a reinirkibly fine one, and was enlivened by sweet music discouiBed from the West Maitland and New- castle bands We had scarcely rounded Nobbys when a number of men began practising on the domesticated feline quadruped, tho officers not attempting to interfere with thu> irregular conduct As wa went up Sydney harbour in the dusk, pale and haggard countenances that were not seen all da), bogan to show up from tho depths delow, and our mutual friend, A B , whom I had given up for ' lost overboard,' suddenly appeared before me as white as a ghost At this time * the shadea of night were falling fast " however, we landed, had our cn pet bags stowed into carta, and marched into the city A halt waa ordered at Punchs, and there occunod [ that memorable charge of the West Maitlandera, niadefauoos in the columns of theS)dney Empue Though the main bod) of the enemy was posted at Punch's, numerous outpost8 were planted in all the "Sui rounding cook ahops, and these were attacked impetuously by the remaining force3 of the ^rthern Battalion Loavea of bread were charged valiantl), beef steaks were demolished wherevei encountered, pork sausiges received no quarter, and had there been a Scamander of tea it would have been drunk dry and Xerxes'host eclipsed As we marched awa) to the railwa) station the citizens turned out from every house, and we were cheered lustily We bad a long delay at the station, BO that it waa late when we began our journe) to Richmond, a distance of thirt)-four miles fiom S)dne) At every pi it form and bridge along the route were repeated the cheering ind waving of pocket-handkerchiefs , and from every carriage rolled out on the still) night choruses from scores of tnroats It was past mid- night when we reached Richmond, and the weather, which had been fine, began to drizzle ' Two o'clock in the morning, all wind and weather scorning," found us marching into camp, with carpet b iga slung o\er rifles, and tramping to the chorus of " We are marching to Georgia " We were guided to our quarters, and told off to tents Previous to this time all had been enthu siasm and jolljt) , but when fifteen of us entered one of these canvas bells, and contemplated the prospect of all being huddled together, our spirits were chagrined, and we becime tamer immediatelv Vi e had now to seek the Quarter master's stores to get blankets or rugs lhere was but one blanket or rug allowed to each man, about the size of a bab\ a and to secure this one had to enter upon whit is vulgirl) termed a ' scnminage " Some through ignoiance, but more through selfishness, secured two or three articles, while others consequent)) had to go without any Many did not go to bed that night, some, blanketless, kept foi a time prowling about the tents like unclean splits, but the bulk of us were stretched in the straw b) four o'clock, with feet against the pole, aud beads oat, locked m as deep a sleep as wis Adam on that night when his rib was removed As boots and socks had been stripped from most of our feet, no man could tell his own especial pair at first glance in the morning, unless they happened to be particular!) ugl) At gun fire we started up and bad a survey of the camp I had seen camps before, but never saw one so long and ao shallow in pro- portion to the number of men on the ground It was but four or five tenta deep, and extending nearl) a mile Considering the nature of the ground, and the desirability of keeping each little corpa separate, perhaps it was best as it waa, but should other and ordin iry conditions obtain, I do not think that the camp at Richmond would be a model to fol- low We washed in the style of soldier George, of Bleak House, and then engaged drawing tent equip- ments and food I may remirk that there was a deal of "scrimmaging" for both food and equipments, and that generally soeaking the rough and selfish I obtained the lion's share, while the unselfish fared badi) Upon a future occisión this should be pre- vented, and b) the non commissioned officers, within whose province it lies In the matter of creature comforts, or rather necessities, the com- missioned oflicera appeared to me to be entirely forgotten Rank no doubt confers power and digmt), and is ver) gratif)ing to the feelings of tbe poasessor, but it ia but a poor aubstitute for food and warmth In the Regulars, you are aware, that each officer has a soldier servant struck off dut) to attend upon him A voluuteer ma) be above be- ing a servant, but, in common [justice, there should have been one man told off in his turn of duty todo fatigue for the three officers of his owncompan), and it should be this mana duty to see that the offi- cers received that to which the) wore entitled, and to cook their food if neceosar) With rogaid to the internal economy, during the first da) the camp was a B ibel, but each succeeding diy it improved, and had it lasted hut a week, order would hive reigned supreme There was more confusion arising troui want of arranging a simple plan of appointing fatigae pirties, thau from an) other cause whatever There wis no roll kept for tins purpose by the ser- geants in oharge of companies, and men were chosen haphazard When a disigreeablo matter waa to be done, seigeants turned aside from or- dering men to do so, who happened to be their own supenors socially , and men who sch«med away did so with impunity, so that the willing horses were worked to death, fatigues gene- rally were tardily done, and sometimes performed i b) incongruous persons- corporals for example weie seen carr) ing loads of tin pots, bread, or beef, and sergeants cooking, or striving to clean greas) tin diahea with their fingers Tue non-commissioned officers in many particulars seemed loath to use their authont) At night time, after ' lights out,' there was no check put upon the noisy, so that weary men, who had beeu doing haid dut), and who were liable to be called up at any hour, were deprived unnecessarily of rest Objectionable lan- guage should have been curbed, and camp life pre- I vented from being a school of immorality There I are some men who fmcy themselves wits because they can create a laugh upon some degrading topic, I but who never made a real witticism in their lives and of these men we had a representative in some of the tents The weither was our greatest drawback There was no heav) ram for any lengthened penod, but showers ' were frequent The tents trenched round resisted the ram very well When drv, and a shower «ame on, the water dnpped through at the outer edgea, but when the canvis was well saturated no mora ram damped our straw. The grass outside | was continually wet, so that duung the whole time | we had not a dry boot or sock Wet feet, combined l with change of diet and water, caused some ' diarrhow, from winch the S)dney companies auf- I fered most Notwithstanding the unfavorable state I of the weather the people qf Richmond, in greater or less numbers, were continually on the ground On the last day crowds of visitora atraamed in upon ua from Sydney These few da) a must have been a gala time for the Richmond lasses-«carlet, music, and dancing in galore The citizen soldiers too seemed to change their heanng towards the ladies with their ooats, and become rolhoking " bould soldier boys " Xoung C, who is rather partial to the gentler sex, was in the Seventh Heaven while in camp, and D, whom I have heard you describe as a regular " muff among girls, petrified me with Ina airs of on ceit and assurance towards them Our cooking was a fruitful source of merriment to our visitors We made tea and boiled potatoes m the c imp kettle, and fried chops in the cover, our dinner mutton we cooked in the bucket, and we carried our mess to our verdant tables in washing basins In addition to the internal economy of camp, you would like to know what we learned of the " Art of War" We mounted "Guard," and practised "3entry-go ," we learned the duties of " In-l)ing and Out-lying Picqueta," and we obtained an ink- ling of what might be expected from a "Flying Column", moreover we were engaged in two pitched battles, and twice our camp was assailed at night Let me detail-the chief duties of the sentries were, in the day, to prevent the water in the water butts from being fouled by the dipping of greasy vessels into it, and to keep carriages and horsemen out- side the camp, and, at night, to allow none either in or out of camp The duty of the in-lying j icquet was to support the out-lying picquet if dnven in by the enemy, and the out-lying picqueta were to watch for the first approach of the enemy at some distance outside the camp. The flying column left the camp in the evening, to personate the enemy, the officer in charge making his own arrangements as to the port of the camp to be at- tacked, and the time and mode of doing so A portion of the picqueta sat round a camp firo and spun yarns, while others kept outer guard as sentnes Some of these sentnes did their duty carelessly enough-an officer in charge upon one occasion found three of them talking together-others acted as rigorously as if they were on actual service, " with ear and eye attentive bent," to catch the first sight or sonnd of the expected foe The first night attack took place at about 1 o.m , and began with a feigned assault on the right front of the camp, by a small body of men with a field piece On account of the irregular habits in the camp we had not fallen asleep till about midnight, so that at this time we were all m our first 6ound sleep The "alarm," followed by the "assembly" Bounded down the line, every man jumped up, and in the dark hastily groped for his coat, boots, bat, and nfle Shivenng we fell in, and hurned to the sup- j posed pomtof attack, but before we had half reached our destination we heard a far heavier rattle of musketr), accompanied by the booming of big guns, on our left rear, the very spot which we of the Northern Battalion had left We were immediately countermanded, and doubled hack Upon reaching the vicinity of the enemy, we opened out into skir- mishing order, and returned the fire of our opponents with interest For Borne time there was kept up on both sides a most brilliant fusillade, till we could not see a yard from where we stood, on account of the smoke Had this been a real engagement I doubt if much execution would bave been done I know that I blazed away into the daikness ahead, but at whom I saw not. During these manoeuvres there waa an immence deal of confusion, oin ce ra losing their I heads metaphoncallj,running purpo«eleea from place I to place, and giving'foolish or contradictory orders while the men were cotif used and as excited as if the mock encounter were real When the auiuiu I nition was expended the firing had to cease, and we were dismissed to seek repose afresh The attack, upon what grounds 1 do not pretend to sa}, was said to have been successful!} resisted Taking into account the straggling position of the camp, the feigned attack on the right front which actually drew away the troops from where the real assault took pi ce, and the timo of the attack, when all but the sentries and outposts were in « heavy sleep, the attack seems to have been well planned, and to have borne the elements of success The second night attack was however an unmiti- gated failure The eueni} lost their bearings in the bush, which delaj ed their attack till dawn For up wirds of an hour prevnjs to the attack, the senti- nels of the outlying picquets could hear the enem} cooe}ing to one another, so that when the} made their appeirance, the camps was well prepared As usual, upon the onset of the enemy's skirmishers, the out-lymgpicquetsretirtd Lpon being promptly supported by the m lying picquets they however, turned round, and advanced with fresh ardour, and both being supported by a small bod} of troop3 from the camp, with a couple of field pieces, a strong line was formed, before which the enem}, whose ammunition by this time was nearly ex- hausted, found himself compelled to beat a retreat, ignommiously defeated almost entirely by picquets I happened to be among the outlying picquets upon this occasion When our ammunition was expended, we retired within the lines It was now morning, and, as we ascended the rear of the slope on the top of which the camp was situated, and contemplated the disposition of the various corps, as the} lay quietly upon their arms, I experienced a thrill of aasthetic delight, similar lo that which one feels when gazing upon a picture of the Old Masters, a statue of Canova or auy porfect work of art The forbes at band seemed disposed in a masterly manner, and to my scientifically untutored e} e the camp was im- pregnable, except to an overwhelming force I was, however, mjch dispirited upon this occasion to perceive how badly handled was the little body of picquets of which I formed a unit Upon the first firing of the sentries the picquet supports stood to arms awaiting or- ders from the officer, but no officer made his appearance We advanced at command of the sergeant in a solid bod}, without any definite pur- pose, and again retired to the camp fire, where we remained for Boine time, still waiting for our missing commander, until the outposts were driven some distance to the rear of us, and there we would havo remained, a nice little solid body to be captured or shot down by either party, had not some one suggested to the sergeant that it would be more appropriate for us to retire, and leave the officer to find shelter in a ho low log We retired, receiving no orders where to go or what todo We joined in, however, with the in-lying picquets, and advanced with them, and when our ammunition was exhausted, we were drawn up in a solid mass right in the hue of fire, and kept steadily standing there without firing It was again suggested that it would be more appro- priate for us to retire, and then we received oiders to do so at the usual ' quick march," as if we were on an ordinär} parade Somo time after reaching the lines our chief made his appearance, accompanied by two men, etitmg that he had six men somewhere else, and complimented us upon doing very well Had the engagement been real I am afraid that lie would have had none to compliment I do not know how the officer lost his men , I can account for it satisfactorily b} a couple of h}potheses but what would have pleased me would have been to have seen the next in command prepared to fill the missing post, and to act with promptitude and de- cision Should we ever be called upon to act in real earnest, which God forfend, the greatest enem} which our wives and families will have to dread, unless matters mend, will be the incompetence of our own officers This is the gangrene which is eat- ing into the vitals of tho Volunteer Force, and its immediate cure re'ts with the staff autho nties, who should tnaist upon every officer being up to his work A gradual cure how- ever may be effected b} the volunteers themselves In their tuture recommendations foi Commissioned officers, let them seek a test before hand, winch ma} guide them somewhat in their selection The West Maitland Company was complimented I believe as the best on the ground T\ hat h is made them such F This question is easil} answered, when one is ac- quainted with tho fdot, that their Captain, as such, is without a rival, and that their Ltiutenant has knowledge of drill and military promptitude oozi g from his finger ends. We engaged in two sham fights On the first oc- casion I had the misfortune to be on another less interesting dut} -I in»} tell } ou as a fuend what it was, but Whisper it not in Gath, publish it not in Ascalon " I was a grimy cook- superintending the bucket boiling of a leg and shoulder of mut ton There was a gre it mistake committed m allowing the men to come quite close to one another with ii ved bnyonets, and en- gage in striving to take each other priso- ners. There were a few slight accidents, but nothing to signif} The "kilted sons of the Gael," I have heard reported distinguished themselves upon this occasion for short temper At the second sham fight tho mistake to which I referred waa rectified, fixed ba}onets being forbidden, and the men strictly charged not to approach within a hundred yards of one another In this second fight tho Northern Battalion formed the reserve of the troops that were attacked The onset opened m the usual wa} by the enemy throw rag forward a line of skirmishers, who attacked our centre and both flanks simultaneously They were ably-answered all along the line b} our skirmishers, and a brisk fire was maintained on both sides according as our line of skirmishers swa} ed to and fro, the supports and reserves adv anced or retired, \t this time our opponents made a movement by rushing through boggv ground to outflank us on the left, but it failed, as wo met them at the new point of attack in equal numbers, but in so doing our centre became dangerously weakened As soon as this was perceived the East Maitland Compan} was detached from the reseive, and hurried in the direction of the weak point The mistake as well as I could judge was not taken advantage of, but it was consideied neverthe- less fatal, and the victory given against us The mock encounter after this was put au end to friends and foes brought amicahl} together and all marched off the field of battle On our march homewards we bad to endure a pitiless shower, and then to march past the Governor and suite Our company had been marching rather irregu- larly from the station, but as we neared the Grand Stand, the line straightened as if by magic, and we marched shoulder to shoulder as steady as a wall That evenirg the camp was broken up During the four days of our stay we encountered , fatigue and discomfort, but I did not hear I a single mon grumble Every one did his appointed dut}, not only willing!}, but with en- thusiasm There was too, a remarkable freedom from intoxication Had the same facilities for dnnk been offered a camp of Regulars of the Imperial arm}, there would have been a vastly dif- ferent tale to tell Want of sleep waa that which pressed moat heavily upon us The actual time I slept while in the camp was eleven hours, and I doubt if the nverage per man amounted as high I This was not altogether due to the heaviness of our duties, but to other aircumstances, which, had we a longer stav on the camp, would have righted them I selves Vkvant of rest was due ver} largely to our irregular habits m seeking it incident upon the novelty and excitement of our position, and it was likewise partially owing to our ignorance of the bugle calls Over and over again the men were I fnllen in at such a call as that of "Orderly Ser- geants,' and I have seen portions of the ' flying column" paraded, all be- great-coated, with looks that, betokened death or victor}, at bugle notes that were but wooing tbem to their tea Duiingthe monoton} of the railwayretnrn journey i to S\ dne}, no man in the carriage I was in was able to bold up his head Those who had room lay down, I others stretched on top of them, hore and there i a sitting four "piled" heads and shoulden for sup I port, and hearded fallows lay their heads most lovingl}, like young maidens, on tli3 bosoms of their neighbours, while a sturdy warrior in the corner sat and swayed from side to side as regularly as old Times pendulum When wa started, all had been excitement and chorus staging, most reprehen sibly intersperoed with fljing shots from some foolish mon As we pi oceeded the choru«es died away, the noises became hushed, and long ore we reached half our journey, from the carriages issued no more sound than as if the} were freighted with the dead In scattered parties in Sydney we were accosted b} grisettes who were anxious to know' how wo enjoyed ourselves," and busbovsde veloped a mama for pointing out the Infirmar} to us An account of the retuin passage would not interest you, so for the present I shall bid ) ou ad eu Old Fellow, jours as t.ue as steel, PTE BULLFT.
