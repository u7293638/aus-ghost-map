UNTIL DEATH. Make mo no vows of constancy, dear friend, To love me, though I die, thy whole life long, And love no other till thy days shall end — £ Nay, it were rash and wrong. If tbou canst love another, be it so ; I would not reach out of my quiet grave To bind thy heart, if it should choose to go — Love should not be a slave. Mv placid ghost, I trust, will walk serene In clearer light than gilds those earthly mourns, Above the jealousies and envies keen Which sow this lone with thorns. Thou wouldst not feel my shadowy caress, If. after death, my soul should linger here; Men's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness, Love's presence* warm and near. It would not make roc sleep more peacefully That tbou vert wasting all tliy life in woe For mv poor sake ,* what love thou hast for me, Bestow it ere I go ! Carve not upon a stone when I am dead The praiBOB which remorseful mourners give To women's graves — a turdy recompense — But Rpcak them while 1 live. Heap not the heavy marble on mv head To fihut away the sunshine and* the dew; Let small blossoms grow there, and let grasses wave, And rain-drops filter through. Thmi wilt meet mnny fairer and more gay Than 1; but, trust me, thou canst never find One who will love and serve thee night and day With a more cringle mind. Forget me when I die. The vio!ets Above my rcBt will blossom just ari blue, Nor miss thy tears ; e'en Nature's self forgets ; But while I live, be true ! —5. P., Krtvs Letter.
