Symes seconded, a.heairty vote of thanks to the (ftev- Ifist.' Fetguspn, taking occasion to refer to the- importance of the subject dwelt upon,.and to the ability and discrimi nation with which it had been treated. ? The proposition was very Tieartily accorded. Th«* address was as follows : — My Djsar. Brethren and Ohkistiait Friends— Elected to fill the high position which I* now come forward to occupy, I trust I shall be enabled by special grace from. God: to perform «U the duties that shall devolve uponmejattd: that whatever efficient power, there may reside in my office it shall be, care^ fullv directed to the fulfilment of His will alone and the further showing forth of His glory. :?;.- : The first duty which usage aBsigns to me requires that I throw .myself upon, your patient indulgerioe^wnile 1 proceed with iny address. Having a desire to set: before you some topic, -the consideration of which mioftt Drove to be of some present value in relation to the work --f the GhnStian Churchy -the inquiry which I will essay tb make is — What was the main and distinctive work to which the AposUes addressed themselves, and what were the : methods .which they uniformly' observed in seeking te overtake and effect it ? This twofold question appears to my own mind to be fundamental in its nature as bearing upon the great mission of the Christian Church in all ages. T It can hardly but be thought that .the duty which was expressly and uniquely given to the Apostles to perform remains the same, which it is incumbent on the Church id be decupled with as long as. tor existence and her agency are needed ^b£ the earth. And it surely must appear to be no less evident that the ways in which the Apostles proceeded in their work, considering the' varied and wide-spread difficulties fliey had to encounter, and con sideringc ^laV aajbooishing success whic& they L achieved notwithstanding^ #re the -ways which, as nearly as possible, -ought to be imitated^dpWs through all agesjrand eve^inali lands over- which the Church spreads. I am not interi&ingtb; m&kes; use tjf the. prmoiple-fhat when we have an Apostdfic' practice univer sally and uniformly observed by~~thim we have theft; % ^implication, vfc Scriptural law which is binding upon the Church, for all titne. This may or may not be so; but '/the. line of our' present en quiry is -nore pimply .after the Baconian method-rWhat-do we find to have con stituted **he diatinfitive ; work of the ApostoUo mihikby, and what wera the ways in which they prosecuted it? -And then we earnestly conclude that their main work ©on- ; tinues stUii to be ours ; and their ways, con sidering the diversified circumstances. amM which the^wroi^ht^ ought to ,be carefully obBerved^^nd^ke^btnyieif by^us. The under-, lying priwH^Te ]flf ^onr whole argument is the : great Protestant one^— that: the Scriptures are gut sufficient and only authoritative rule both of faith and practice. Our subjectj'^ieji, u APOSTOI£O WORK AND WATS. Apostolic Womc.*~ The work, which aeems to have beeri^bnV and Comprehensive in the miniBtry of 'the Apostles, comes 'before :onr Tpw in ffig^f Teatament^ecords under singular simplieUy of statement, And in ever recurring: iteration; It is given us in a set and formal inanner in the first chapter of the Acts of ft* ApostleB; when, after the dis ciples ha# enquired of the risen Lord what was to follow - next in the relationship in which theye stood to eaeh ? other — whether ' He wouM^ At that time, restore again the ' Jringdom^Eraell?' He, in eft-ct,. jrepHed, that this #ra$'uqt their concern, but that ** they wereVto^jb forth, after that the -Holy, Ghost had oome upon them, and be witnesses' unto Him -both in - Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto thej; utter most parts ot ipe esajahV? They would- not be oompletejys equipped for their -work until the Drane-: Spirit- had '-descended - upon* them and * - endowed them with ry*iiew power, 'out v-when once* *his had '[ bj^eri vouchsafed . their : duty would then be to bear witneas btflim. This is the simple form of : ?expression by ? which their work appears to have-been designated. And it is added in ^esaored'1narratiye that 'When He had 4 spolceuiJiese things, while tWy beheld, He ^r«a taken up, and a cloud received Him out of rtheiu ajght.'' The Master had given HislaB&directions.; He had told them ' what thfejfwere^tb do. And Tififli this closing «ounselthe statement altogether^agreeB which our Lard made from time to titne-on previous occasions. When He was makin^icnown to His dear followers the IKvito jpijrpQBe ,to send forth the Com forter aft^iL'lXifHimBelf 'had returned to the Father, He said— -* He shall testify, of me : and ye also shall bear witness, because -ye have been, with -me from the beginning.' ? At another lame, on one of the^ccasions Hemet with the .Disciples after, His resurrection, after endeavoring patiently to reconcile them to all that na&Iso; mysteriously happened, He 'then opened their understanding that they might understand the Scripture, and said UBtothem; thus it as written, and thus it behov^Phrbt to suffer, ^md to rise^fjrom the deadth^third days and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His nam«-«raong -aU--nationsi iteginning at Jerusalem. And ye are' witnesses of these things.'.- Whether we refer*tot»ur Lord's instruc tions given to the Apostles immediately' before He was taken up, or to those expressed by Sim at earlier periods, the one compre. hen»ye duty to devolve upon the Disciples in their iriiiiSstry ia always the same, that, naTiely, of .bearing ^itoeas of Him. And to this agrees, vary evidently, the interpre tation which the Apostles themselves put upon these ohatgesi for we find them as often as occasion arises; Set&ig; fprfch their clai.ms; i^be listened tp,*B well as their obligation^ to speak in ffigjiame upon the fact that they had been eye^ritttesaes of these things. When they thought to fill; up the ^vacancy: wnich fiad. occuirred ;thro»gh the desertidn; and ^sijbs^quentideath of Jiidas their plan ; was, that «f of these men who had companied wi*-i *-inm «Jlct-io time that Jesos went in and ibut:iamong jthem, beginning froinvthe| baptism :of John unto j^that 'game day that He. was taken up feom^Shem,' one must be ordained }' to be a witness with them of His resurrection. ' And: when they speak of His resurrection it is only 'asfthe; culminating event of His.whole.mysteripus manifestation. : And so wlien Pet^ was concluding nis great first apostolic discourse on the day of Pente-. -»st, he says, ^thisr Jesus hath God raised up, wheredf we all are witnesses;' It may be sumcientiy apparent, witnouu my quoting further verbal evidence, that the pre-eminent and abiding work of the Apostles was to be that of bearing witness for Christ. And to this they faithfully and heriocally nAhcarcA T?nr hear the Affad John. When be had reached .the closing scenes of his own long-career, and which was /to close as well the general Apostolic period, 'That which was from the beginning/ wjiich we have heard, which we have seen with ! our eyes, and our hands have, handled, ' of the Word of life (for the life was manifes ted, and we have seen it, and bear witness, arid showun|d you that eternal life, which was with the Father, 'and was manifested junto.us)j that which we have seen and heard declare wfi unto ybtf, that ye also may haye fellowship, withius- : eaadLiruiy our. fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.7* It is a splendid passage, in John's own deep and penetrating style, and, accor dingly, characterised\;by, all his simplicity and comprehensiveness. And when dating, his last book, which Ib also the closing book of the New. Testament 'canon, he writes; from '* the isle that Jus called Patmos,' whtere: he then laya hoary efxild, ,t* for the .word of God, aod for the testiinojiy of Jesus ;Chnst/' ' Now, this bearing witness for the Hedeeuler I- feel freely disposed- to interpret in the simplest manner possible, ifceording to ther meaning of the words. Whetner we taice; -the Greek verb which occurs in the passages, or the common English translation, it is all the same^— to bear witness is to testify to what one has seen, or heard, or knows. Know ledge, derived from, one's .personal and primary,.- ^sources of information, v at once forms the basis of true testimony, and sup-' plies the substance of it. When the Apos tles stood forth, accordingly, to give their, ^tesfcimony.to what was alleged in respect t^ Christ, they could not l)ut declare what they themselves knew. It was :all and simply; with^ them a matter of knowledge^ and they , could *not withheld their teBtimony without ^oing vidlence^o'tBe dic|bat»s and; iEbpuUeB ' -of their moral and; intellectual nafcur^-f they '?? could not; hut *' speak .the.- thinga whioh..they idaA- both seen and heard.' And these very things which, they thus averred became,1- in- turn, the subject matter of their testiiioiny. As often as they testified, they also preached. There was nothing more, or nothing, better required ' of them than that they should simply. tell what they knew of the Redeemer. To do this Was to preach the Gospel, and set forth Jihe .propitiation which Is through f aith ^ in the Son of God. Such is Christ, so mani fold! and 'Wide are the bearings of His divinely %da^«sd life and character^ so obviously full of vicarioufl*ignifi.canee are all His sufferings and* £0s death ; such an infinite plenitude, in short, is there in; his God-man person that to bear witness of Him is to proclaim the way of salviation to mankind. One cannot speak of Him without making known a Saviour. And there is no more direct way of pointing the world to the only true deliverer than to apeak .alorie^of Him. 'For the Word was- made 'flesh and dwelt among us, arid we beheld His glory, the glory of the only-begotten of the Father, fun.of grace apd iruiUi.' ' iVir the law-;came fey, Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.' No man hath 'seen God at any time but the only-begotten Son, J who is in ttie bosom '& /tlie FatliBr ; He hath declared Him, who ia^ the brightness of the Father's glory and. the express image of His .person; for it hath, pleased, the Father that in^Btim should aU fulness dwell.' . Aind this is what^the Apostles 4id ; when ?*3iey went,, forth they as simply as possible told people about Christ. Look back upon their discourses, notice the drift and course ojL their discussions, and invariably you will find; that they testify (of one fact or another ; -oi- His history. Are they addressing a Jew ish audience, then, fhey, have affirmed certain tactjs, and are proving from the Scriptures . that 8uoh*n,d, such ihjngs ' must needs ; haye{ occurred. Or, are they listened to by Gen^ tile. hearers, then they are' laying hold of the common cravings arid aaprrationsy^iof Pfhfeir spiritual nature as evinced in their supOTs^i' lions, and telfing'of Jesus, t^io they'indlcate iflcertainto satiflfy.theni.^ 'It is H^vJ)ivin^ as well -as- liuman ^. personality, His lif q of spotlessness and benevolence, His unmerited but vicarious sufferings, or His resurrection, just as the occasion at the moment happened to require,' that we find them declaring. ; But in every instance it was Christ. ' . . As a matter of oourse, in the. prosecution of this their peculiar work they often found oocasiori'to address themselves to other topics. But it/was always only as arising out of their, persistent. testimony., For iuatanca, when . they might be reciting in the ears, of Jews the facts and incidents of the Saviour's life, their narrative would not be questioned, for -the Jews themselves also knew of it.- But then the question came to be pressed upon them — Was this then indeed the Son of God 1 Their hearers would not tleny the facts, as facts, that were true of Him whom they called J esus ; but they would ask for proof that their interpretation of these facts was correct, and that this was in truth .the Son of God. And so they were, obliged to follow such a- question. and. argue the xpoint, and make good the Divine Sonship of Christ/- Again, while not deriving- their averments in regard to Christ, and,' perhaps also, not denying the importance which they nought to attach to Hia name, some would still demur to the exclusiveness of theirr : claims on His behalf, maintaining that the, llaw of the Old' Covenant must ftill be: \ observed, bth^r^fe they could have rip nop* \6i the favor tof God. : And this would leid 'them,, as it so of ten .did in the ministry of ?Paul, to an exposition i-f the use of the 1 Mosaic dispensation, and an explanation that : Christ came riojb to destroy but to fulfil, and that now we are complete in Him. An.d. so, \a& otter times other 'questions would arise ' giving occasion for the discussion of otheri ipointa of doctmnei Btit it was always ;the: -sase that these questioua sprang out of fihejri testimony for Christ, and theLyery discnsBion of them served only' yet the1 more, to throw ; light upon their great theme. Christ, and i Him crucifiedr formed ' the oontinuoug burden of their ministry ; all other 'ques- tions seem only to have been' taken up because they- were thrust upon them, and when they were discussed they were anxiously taken advantage of to illustrate, and enforce the claims of Him who is ''the way' back to God. Their work was, in its pleasure only a continuation of the: ministry of Christ, who 'came to seek bad to save that which was lost. Their great place and agency was to testify tb the love of God. who, 'so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whbsover believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlaating life.' And as ' this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal Life, and this life ia fin His Son,' so to the Son, and to the Son always, and toHinki alone must, they bear witness. ... I I need not^delay you to show similarly that the planting of the Christian Church, and the laying down;' and exercise of disoip. pline all lay within the same line of their Divinely- prescribed work. It being accord ing -to a Divine order that every trub': follpwBr shall, in his turn, become another; individual witness-bearer, a living epistle of Christ, to,, 'be known, and read of all men,; the Christian Church as a community of such is only an organised sooietyj of many, branches it may ba, bearinsr testimony to the same great name. And Christian ordinance? : and dhuroh. services, as well as discipline!,* are .only- so many particular lines of the Church's, habitual asd formal action, all- within their . own sphere pointing the heart arid conscience. unto Christ. In short, when, we survey the whole of the Apostolic mini-: : istry, and note the lofty end of its testimony, ' that of pointing, like the Forerunner, *° the Lamb of God, and observe how thiB coni tinues to be the end in particular, as well ak iia general, of every part of the. Apostolii; work, we only jeoine to remember that this is^ -, as it was, necessary that it should be. ; It is? only in harmony with 'the rest of the great diapensatiori of mercy as it comes within pur view. .From the flay when the/first gospejl was preached in the garden of Eden, at once n.eucse and promise]; down to the mornmj; ?Ken ^the . augals startled1 the unexpecthij ; ? shepherds on the plains of BethiehJem by , their songs, at . the atfrent of Christ, many lbngages'hadtocomecand pass away.

Bearing witness for Christ, and resolving all their yarieid; action and- discussions into a rbvereatisl regard to this paramount testii ; mony, then' we shall probably now find that j the manner in which they proceeded wai' iriiUarryconsiBtenji^nd definite in its aimi At no time does history present us with $. spectaole: so myaterioua ind :i(at .the time) so inexplicable as that of the Apostles \ doming at first into the presence of thei^ work,; A mere handful of men as to number j ' their Leader and Master taken from. their head by crucifixion, they were now to go forth ajnd bear witness of Hint in Jerusalem, and; in all Judea) and in Samaria, arid unto the . uttermost parts of the earth.

And' fhey very quickly begin to prevail, for the civil power is soon., called upon to interfere ? that their progress ought at least be checked. - When they beoa'me dispersed b'jr the- persecutions which followed, they ; w6nt' everywhere pr^^biirig the word. Their, lone theme was Christ, and the manner ii which they bore their testimony to Hinif was 'determined by the situation arid the, character -*f the audiences wbidhthey had, successively to address. W^s it ia cpmmu'-. nity of Jews among whom they . ., were mingling, they had then no , difficulty in introducing the story of Jesus, through thes medium of their own Scriptures, which .-ill-: spoke of Him. Did it happen to; be a Gentile audience, they had then compara tively as little difficulty, for they then seieed: upon signs and tokens of their faith, present, at the moment to their view, and from these: won their way easily to the Btory of Christ. - : Whoever might be the people they had: around them, whatever might be the point, from which they started, the Redeemer was: always the grand centre into whose light, they as quickly as possible brought their - hearers, in whose light they saw light as they: had never seen it before. Do we ever find, them trifling with their audiences as if for the moment pleasing themselves with the inunciationof subtilties or startling para-: doxea, arid cliscoursing upon themes which, were --f interest only to themselves as b»ing conceits and hobbies of their own ?
