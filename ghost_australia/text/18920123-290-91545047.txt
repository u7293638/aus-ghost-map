GHOSTS IN THE TEMPLE. The London correspondent of the Manchester Courier writes: â€” Christmas is undoubtedly the time for ghosts, and very appropriately a ttrange story reaches me from one of the Inns of Court. A set of chambers had been vacant for some time ; indeed, they had only been tenanted tor three weeks during the iaet six years. The rent was remarkably moderate, and the rooms were comfortable. Accordingly a young barrister took them for a month or so. He never enquired why it was that they had been so long empty, nor bad he any idea that they were supposed to be haunted. He had not, however, been in possession rnany days before he announced his determination to quit the rooms, though he had spent a good deal of money in doing them up and furnishing them. His friends naturally asked for an explanation, and he confessed that he had seen a ghost, or rather a collection of ghosts, for every night, he said, the door opened of its own accord and in walked three men and a woman dressed in last century costumes. They sat down at the table and commenced to talk and to drink. Eventually the talk got louder and a violent quarrel broke out, in the course of which the woman was stabbed. After this catastrophe the ghosts disappeared. Such is the most recent ghost ?story, and naturally enough it is arousing a good deal of interest among people fond of in vestigating psychical phenomena.
