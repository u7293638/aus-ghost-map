ROSE, SHAMROCK, THISTLE, AND LEEK. \---<>\--- The Rose. - The intestine wars which so long de- vastated England were carried on under the symbols of the Red and White Rose. The adherents of the House of Lancaster chose the red rose as their mark of distinction, whilst those of York chose the white. This fratrioldal war continued until the union of the roses by the marriage of Henry VII. with Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV., in 1486, since which time the rose has continued to be the emblem of England. The Shamrock. - When St. Patrick landed in Ireland to convert the Irish, in 432, the pagan inhabitants were ready to stone him. He requested to be heard, and endeavored to explain God to them as the Trinity in Unity but they did not under- stand him until he plucked a trefoil, or shamrock, from tho ground, and said, " Is it not as possible for the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be one as for these three leaves to grow upon a single stalk?" "Then," says Brand, " tho Irish were convinced, and became converts to Christianity, and in memory of that event they have ever since worn the shamrock as a badge of honor. The Thistle. - When the Danes invaded Scotland, on one occasion, they resolved to adopt a stratagem, and in order to prevent the Scots from de? ing them they marched barefoot. The Danes thought they should teach the camp in a few minutes, when, on a sudden, a man who went forward was wounded by a stout Scotch thistle, so that he could not help crying out loudly with pain. This noise roused the camp ; the Scots ?ew to arms and the Danes were vanquished. The thistle was after- wards adopted as the insignia of Scotland. The Leek. - On a certain occasion King Cadwalls met a Saxon army. In order to distinguish his men from the Saxons he placed a leek in each of their hats ; and having gained a decisive victory over their enemies, the leek became ever after the badge of the Welsh.
