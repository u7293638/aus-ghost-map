WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1896. The Government yesterday made yet another change in its Parliamentary procedure It dropped for the time the neW. business it has been pressing upon both Houses, and commenced an effort to finish up some of its old busy now So that we may suppose our recent well meant criticism on this point was not Yvastcd In the Council the neglected Companies Bill was at last remembered, and in the Assembly the shops and 1 stones Act was proceeded with, and the Credit Foncier is to follow, and the Constitution Bill may be heard of Of course there is not the ghost of a security that this policy will be adhered reformers than twenty four hours but this last wakening is in the right direction Never was there a more ridiculous or mischievous policy than that of starting one important bill to please one section "of another bill to please a second, and so on, until a cloven unfinished meTsuiosniobeforo a puzzled House The Council made satisfactory pro- gress with the Companies Bill, and any ordinary commercial man will agree with nineteen out of twenty of its amendments As for " the wreckers' "clause" it has been improved out of existence This was the provision which allowed one twentieth of the creditors of a bank or company to go before the court and demand a special audit Any Wacla miler who could get a shilling in the £1 interest to back him, or who could pretend that he could get a shilling in the £1 interest, could Unbeaten a bank or an institution with public proceedings which, however ill founded, might seriously injure its credit, cych if they did not initiate the wholesale um which no bank-not open the Bank of England can over stand Institution after institution closed its doors in 1893, although, as the event shows, they ought not to have been assailed, and the very last thing which the Legislature should do is to render it easy to start parties in the interests of financial birds of prey The Council has substituted one tenth of the shareholder as the body to de mind a special audit, instead of one twentieth of the creditors, and the tone of the House shows that no further concession is possible in the Lower House it was a sad sign of the times to find Mr Plycociv. disingenuousivitli regard to thePactones and Shops Act Amendment Bill He says that the House is plunged into fresh legislation because of the error of the Council Now, the Council's lapse which Mr Pi ycock also overlooked was not seeing that Chinamen could select the furniture board, and that is it point collected in a moment and in a clause Ihobillbeforo therfore is called for because Mr Pi ycock sOYvnmachinery with regard to the Saturday half holiday broke down-and every child knows that fact Why descend to this pi actor of indulging in a false suggestion whenever the Upper House is mentioned 5 A Corner cheer was Waiting Mr Peacock, but cych labour plaudits are ill purchased by these sacrifices Consequent apparently upon their contemplated crusade the practice of little ondonndniud throwiiigisgiowing upon Ministers After debate the proposal to make the Saturday holiday compulsory was negatived on the voices the provision that a bare majority shall suffice to natal the ''Saturday closing was duly restored All that we need say to (lay is that nothing probably would have been heard of the two thirds majority but for the emphatic statement of the supporters of the cause that only one man in a street' was against it 478 shops corners out of COO in Prahran are, according to Mr Gryy, ardent for the Saturday, and so it is we are told, in the other suburbs that being the case, a concession could apparently be easily made to those who justly hold that in the of or velvet) with a man in the conduct of his business is a serious thing, and that when 40 men are on one side and 60 on the other further consultation is required It was in this spirit the Council proposed its amendment by o still believe that the Saturday half holiday is heartily and strongly supported, and that the two thirds majority could be obtained, and that it would satisfy those who object to the tyranny of a bare majority Mr Gray, Mr Pi yearly, and others who run away from then one man in the " street ' position, clearly show that in the first instance they were indulging in braggadocio The Intercolonial Postal Conference, which has just terminated in Sydney, led to useful discussion upon many matters in which the colonies are jointly interested But unfortunately it was not allowed to break up without a demonstration of unfriendliness from Queensland, which almost makes us (taipan of this of another effort to promote harmony of action among the different colonies The ancient relic of those periodical conferences, or of the Australasian Federal Convention, of of the UniVersal 1 Postal Union is simply that matters i dating to postal and told graphic communication is recognised as standing' upon a different footing from other public concerns in which each individual GoYonunont legislates for itself alone without any direct reference to its neighbours 'The post office and the telegraph line among the mightiest agencies of civilisation, but their full benefits can only be enjoyed by co-operation among different states Communication which is stopped or hampered by geographical boundaries would be a maimed system indeed to be of real value it must be universal or as universal as civilisation the aim of all enlightened oNpoitahaa long been to smooth away barrows, to in case facilities for communication over land and ocean routes in every way, to cheapen and expedite mail services, expand the money order and postal note system, hung down cable charges, are, for the benefit, not of any particular nation or Government, but of the world's population Progress in this direction can only be effected by combination, by a readiness on the part of colonies and countries to give on the one hand all the advantages they have to bestow, and take on the other the much more extensive benefits secured to them by the general compact into which they enter If this is postal policy in its wider aspect, the principle applies with even more force to agree ments made between the different colonies intended to ensure that the postal system upon this continent shall be Australians, not provincial In the present case the Queensland representatives at the conference do not seem to have raised a contention that the Australian compact mis defee true in this or that respect, and should be discussed with a view to amend month Their action was very different When the conference was about to dispense, they simply gave notice that the northern colony intended to withdraw from certain provisions of the convention, and adopt for its own ends isolated regulations in those matters The first was as regarded the packet post Valuable articles, such as jewellery, it was said, are sent into the colony by packet or letter lost, some of which might be liable to duty, and Queensland therefore desires to obviate this loss by admitting such gooch by parcels post only 'the Queensland Customs, it seems, have suffered It does not appear, however, that the Customs in other colonies have suffered so much as to necessitate an outcry Nor is it easy to see why such injury should be felt by Queensland alone, and felt so seriously as to justify her in endeavour- ing to rescind one clause of the convention The second intimation, more surprising still, was that Queensland had decided to no longer admit newspapers from other colonies at the agreed rate In per 10oz but would charge instead J d for each 2oz Bulk parcel-of newspapers would also no longer be earned at the existing rate of ld per lb It was further agreeably intimated that if the new five fold rate on papers were not prepaid double postage would be surcharged w Uli this amicable parting shot the Queensland repute sentative cs picked up their pen tcmanteaux and wended back to Brisbane they carried long enough, of course, for a remonstrance, and we learn that the resolution passed asking Queensland to reconsider the packet post alteration, on the ground that it is not federal, may not improbably be successful, but that there is little chance of any harking back as regards newspaper postage If this proves to be the case we shall be tempted to believe that the Queensland Government has been following a very familiar line of strategy Make j our demands exactly double what you intend insisting upon and you will have good margin for comession Moreover, instead of exciting all-round ill Will you may obtain prestige for Field ing something gracefully But if this is the calculation, in the present case it is doomed to be disappointed We cannot conceive the other colonies being beguiled into any attitude but one of the strongest condemnation should Queensland persist in this exclusive policy as regards newspapers published outside her own borders 'Jheioisno possibility of disguising the motive and meaning of the act journalistic Store ture is not a commodity concerning which there is fear lest the Customs should be cheated of their dues It has not been considered hitherto in any country a proper object for revenue tax allow 'Iho policy has been that printed matter of all kinds should be freer a great deal than written correspondence, that in the general interest it should circulate as cheaply as carriage conditions render possible By the new departure now threatened Queensland means nothing less than this that she considers the postal service may be properly used as an engine of protection YMmt import duties upon ordinary merchandise will do in the way of dry nursing the local manufacturer, postal rates may be made to so for the pun on ors of local literature Queensland will take all the benefits she can act by participa- tion in the postal concessions secured by combined Australia, but will reserve to herself the right to make her own post office a Customs house us well so policy more narrow minded in every sense (could be imagined Various indications from time to time force the conviction upon us That Queensland looks upon it as her sovereign duty to walk guard herself against the other colonies Her interests, she appears to consider are in no way bound up with those of Australia as a whole Whether it is a question of the Auxiliary Squadron, of the cable subsidy, or of federation, a section of her statesmen are at pains to point out that the way of Queensland lies in one direction and the way of Australia in another 'line the other colonies by federation design to exploit her commercially is, we fear, a looted belief with many Queensland politicians Now the grievance is that the outer world, necessarily more numerous in population than one Australian colony and richer in publications, is inundating Queensland with literature not home made 'this colony designs to become self supplying in the matter of journalistic literature by an application of the prohibitive principle of these new regulations mean virtually prohibition Upon that point there need be no misunderstanding The hope is that the Queensland public may awake in time to realise exactly the drift of this proceeding It is comprehensible that a small interested clique should manage to force such an illiberal and reactionary measure upon their rulers possibly when the latter wore off their guard, and failed to discern the real gravity of the proposal But it will be strange indeed if the Queensland reading public resign themselves docilely to a mandate that henceforth they are to be exclusively home fed. Mr Mathii son's evidence with regard to the Collingwood and Fitzroy lines is to be accepted as the most proper time vol laid on It is straightforward and appeals to common bought Mr Ma.hii son unions

Of course it is a question of a s d into which Mr. MATHirsov could not enter its to when the Parliament can make a northern suburbs start, but the strong recommendation for two lines and not for a compromise must weigh greatly with the House honored the claims of the district are considered, and it will give general satisfaction in the locality It seems that the total loss on the country lines

General moved that it should tile precedence The House thereupon went into committee to consider the amendments recommended by the select committee, which were moved and explained by Sir 1 Federick Sargood 'those relating to the annual statement of assets and habits lies, shareholders' balance sheet, reserve fund, qualification of auditors, and liability of directors were agreed to substantially

devoted, first, to the second reading debate on the Mines Act Amendment Bill, and, secondly, to the amendment of the much amended and still very rickety Pao tours Act Amendment Bill The debate on the Mines Bill did not last long for it was recognised that if it is to pass this session it must be by the suppression of that criticism which is essential to the satisfactory settlement of the important questions involved The Ministry has fiat tried away time on petty grievances in connection with the Estimates, and on facts, fanciful and foolish, and now its coal measures of practical legislation have to be summed over hurriedly Only two members spoke at length on the bill, and then it was committed pro forma The amendment of the Council in the Factories Act Amendment Bill were then considered, some being agreed to and others disagreed with, after which the measure was returned to the Council, with a message to that effect At 20 minutes past 11 o'clock the House adjourned till 2pm to-day 'The long delayed Mines Act Amendment Bill has reached the committee stage in the Assembly It will be proceeded with next week, and the whole of the sittings Yv will be given up to it in
