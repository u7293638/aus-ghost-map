A Ghost in Love A .ovcaL farmer residing in the neighbour hood of Yeovil, who had lately become a widower, was aroused at midnight by the barking of his dog. On going to it the animal displayed signs of extreme terror and the farmer took his gun and made a tour of inspection. No sooner had he got out into the yard than he beheld a horrid phantom, clothed in a white sheet, rise up from behind a hedge. The farmer turned deadly pale, his teeth chattered and his limbs shook with dismay. He, neverthe less, managed to ejaculate, "If you come from God, speak: if from the devil, vanish l" In reply to this command the phantom rephled, " Wretch, I am your deceased wife, come back from the grave to warn you not to marry Mary A--, to whom you are making love; she Is quite unwothy to share thy bed. The only woman I will have to succied me is Harriet B-. Marry her, orpersecution and eternal torment shall be thy doom." This remarkable address from the ap parition, instead oldismaying the farmer, restoreu his courage, and rushing forward he stripped the sheet off his visitor, and discovered Harriet; B----herself, looking excessively foolish. The farmer, admiring the girl's device, at once had the barns published and married her, the union proving a happy one.
