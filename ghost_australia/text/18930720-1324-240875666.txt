TRENTHAM. (FBOM OUR OWN CORBESPONDENT.) Wednesday. One hundred and ten of the unemployed are now located atLyonville. They have ceased cutting 5ft firewood,and are cutting 2ft wood for the Bailway Department, so that the objectionable question of nnfair competion has been removed. Some of the men are married, and have brought their wives and families to Lyonville to settle there. Some of the-angle men remain for a short time.nntal they get a rigTńifc,and then clear out; but of course it/is only natural to find duffers in every or any community persons. The - men are divided into two lots, and. each lot is paid alternately rortnightly, tiie arrangements being that after tiie store accounts, eta, for which the department is responsible are paid, tiie balance is paid to the men to whom any money may be due. It is generally understood that parcels for the destitute will be carried free on the railways, though tiie conditions requiredappears to have "been complied with in forwarding a parcel of clothes from Daylesford to Lyonville the other day. Mr Sheckfuss had to pay the freighton receiving the parcel. Taking everything in consideration, the unemployed at Lyonville are getting on very well. As long as, the Government will provide them - with work that does not take the means of living from other men, everything will go on satisfactorily, and local working men will be glad to see the new arrivals improving their positions, particularly those who have others depending on them. It has been stated here that it isihe intention of a Kyneton resident to offer him. self for the Trentham Biding in Augnst. The Kyneton resident would do well to reconsider his decision if he has decided "to stand for Trentham. I have heard many of the ratepayers refer to his anticipated ring candidature during the last few days, and without exception theyare decidedly opposed to any Kyneton man' representing tins riding, whUe there are local men available. If the Kyneton resident comes forward, he will not have tiie ghost of a show, Z can safely assure him. Two hundred people left Sydney on Thursday last in their -own ship, The Boyal Tar, for that "New Australia," which they hope to find in Paraguay, These form tiie first contingent of a band of fifteen hundred families, numbering in all five' thousand souls, who are so dissatisfied with the conditions of Australian life that they eed have determined to shake tiie dust of the continent from their feet and eo begin nil over again. They subscribed £90,000 amongst them for tiie enterprise.
