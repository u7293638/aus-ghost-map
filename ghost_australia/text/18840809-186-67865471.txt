Ciluteb XVII— Tbx Wheedling Poweb op Wives.— Little Ron's Devem-pme.\t ssd Catastrophe. Ronald took quite three hours to accomplish his journey home on his half- starved horse. The road was in many places impracticable, and he had to make considerable detonrs over the ridges'to avoid such flooded flats and creeks as could thus be escaped. Those he could not avoid, his noble horse carried hi'! over swimming. Ada was not surprised at bis non appearance the night before, as she knew by the direction he took that he was going to the Haunted Hut : but she became anxious as the second night approached and no appearance of hinx. Little Ron's importunate questions. '* When pappy tununin borne, mamma !'' and ' Dear p&PPy; tummin1 borne to-night ; rpnmrpft *' preyed so upon her spirits, tiiat she at length gave way, and burst into tears but a moment before tbe well-known foot£nil sounded on the verandah. ' Why ! why ! Ada ! What arc those tears for?' Ronald said. **0h, Ronald !' she said, embracing him, 'I thonght something must have happened to you. But I will not detain yon. Go and change for you are wet through. You can tell me all your adventures afterwards. I put a dry change out for you lastnight, thinking it just possible that you might return. Every He went to his room and changed his wet things. His little sou was delighted to see him ag^'n, and followed him in, while Ada went to the kitchen to hurry the dinner. As his father drew off his heavy \xyots, the child took possession of them, dragging them into a place thby cmselvcs. He named each the working bullocks, and spoke to it as though he were the driver. The two leggins were dragged off and named, the little fellow shouting, 'Turn here, Nelson — gee Boxer. Tbe two boots next. ' I warm your hide. Magpie! Taud up. Spot,' and soon till everything was placed in a heap. Wht-n Ronald was ready, he took the child into the narlour. Ada. waa waiting for him, and said, ?* Yes, I am terribly alarmed about you, Ronald. I thought somctlunj; must have happened to you, us you were not home by '* Lj that all *' he said playfully ; and in a more serious tone, ** Well, you see nothing has happened to me, but I am sorry to say something very terrible occurred at the Haunted Hot, last night.' ??What— the ghost, Ronald?' she said, looking up douhtiugly ; for, though she did | Dot actually believe in ghosts, she yet hat* what ladies would recognise as 'a ^Tudizt* lf«.linB all up the back' when swell tiling I were talked alumt near bedtime. 4* I)o Ull ' me now, ll«naM, what was it V I '* No ghosts, Ada— yon know I do not | believe iu -*icl« thing*— hut poor Billy Cant I well was killed by lightning last night, und we buried him tliia afternoon. The same flash shivered a Large gum tree, and the bursting of one of tbe roots turned np tie earth, and with yon not drawing on my credulity, Bonald ? I know yon often do, you wicked fellow,' (she said archly ; bot 6eeing no indication of anything like a wish to ' sell' her, in his face she paused for hia reply. ' I assure you, Ada, I never felt more serious in my life. The men told me that Billy Cantwell was very queer in his ways for some time past. He certainly was last night, and did not go to bed, but sat on a stool at my feet, as I lay stretched 1-efore the fire, till —till late in the night. The wind blew tbe door open, and he went towards it, as 1 thought to ehnttt; but be said — something, and went oat, and was killed soon after.' 14 How dreadful ? Did you hear what be said r Ronald did not intend to give the whole particulars, Imt he did not reckon on tbe wheedling power that voting vives — and old ones too — possess ; aud as he could not very well look an untruth, even il he toH one on the way ufa joke.hehesitated, forhchad al ready unwittingly entered on ground that he saw was dangerous ; he replied. ** No — that is, not very distinctly.' 41 You ought to tell me, Ronald. Do. I will be so uneasy if you do itot, I can see by your face that you did hear something.' 'The man was quite mad. I could see it in his face. You know the words of triad ' I shall be thinking all night about it if yon do not tell me. Was it anything about ' No ? Oh, it was nothing.' ' Yes it was. Ah do teU me, Ronald. Did ** Well, then, there ^*n be no harm in you telling OB.' 'Joe StockwelL Now, how much wiser are you. Miss Inquisitive*' ' Well, what did he say about Joe Stock well ?' '* Nothing.' '*Yes, he. did. Now, Ronald, dear, you may as well tell me all. I shall not sleep a wink all night if you do not. It Is not kind of you. You ought not to treat your litUe wife with so little confidence. I never keep anything from you,' she said, half hurt, half coaxingly. ' Well, if you must know, Ada,' he said, ' If s Joe Stockwell beckoning to me I must go!' ' How horrid ! Do you think he was the murderer, Ronald ?' she said, covering her ' Of course you buried the skeleton. Did you read service over them both ? I gave Pet a prayer-book and Bible, when I came np, for the use of himself and his mates.' ' Yes, I read the burial service over both.' ' I am so glad— then the Pet has kept his promise. He eaid he would read the books regular to hjp mates. Ronald did not undeceive her. He did not say how they hosted for the prayer-book* nor where it was found. While they were conversing, little Ron sat on hiB father's fen**^ looking from one to the other of the speakers in fear and wonder, with bis great dark eyes wide open, for he comprehended a good ueal of what was flfli'T. Then he gave some of bis own impressions. ' Me frightened big lightning turn last night. Mamma not let it hit littte Ron.' ' Hush ! You must not speak so, you wicked boy,' said Ada. Then sh« took him darling ? Wnat could harm you ? God loves and takes care of my little Ron. — and my big one too,' she added, with thankfulness and affection, hissing both, ' Now then, bring papa to dinner, Ron.' Little 1 Ion, was very precocious and amusing. Being the first he had had a great deal more attention lavished upon him that could possibly be extended to a second, or any subsequent one ; at all events in the bush, where servants are so hard to get, and when obtained hatl, and have still, to 1-e taken ' for better for worse.' After tile wedding, and before starting for the station, a facetious frieud presented Ronald with a very useful article of furniture. That is to say, very useful when such a thin' is really required ; Uut ju^t tliuti it was uot required, so Ronald bad it packed up and sent to his agent, w ho was a storekeeper in town, to be taken care of. He was doubtless have returned it to the donor, hut the gift was anmynious, so he took the most^eniiblt out that, when there was a probability of the gift heing required on the station, and Ron-Jd wrote for it, the agent omitted to put it on the dray. For the information of those who have not guessed what the article was, aud who still wish to know, it may be stated that it was a child's cot. What was to lie done for a substitute for that indispensable commodity t Ronald and his w~ife mnsacke* their brains and the sutiou to find oue, and Uie old proverb— ** Necessity is the mother of large t*»ap Imv was singled out as the destined distinguished recoptade for the first-lwru— not only of the new house at Walton, but of the Boonwna station, for the shortly expected one was to have the honour of being the first white child born on the station. The bo\ was thoroughly washed and dried, and had rockers nailed on, of conrsc ; Imt according to the author's often chocked than used. A little covered and curtained with the orthmiox phik and Licit, etc. The Imx was softly pa-I-led aud jrurguoui-ly liiunl : but Ron. could not slv-cp in it for «vcr, for the soft pamjwircd little auiuial grew apace. It wouM have been marvellous indued if he had uot, for the nourishment he took was sutficeut to keep a three month's old calf, not only from ttarvu tion, but absolutely in sleek condition. Little Ron, grew, but the cot did not, and two pink UtSe feet protruded over the eg triumphant. Of course, young mother's must be 'supported' — even in the absence of a *' monthly nurse** — so a cask or two of the regulation beverage for British maternity — Barclay and Co's XXX hottled-lonnd its way to the station among other nourishing things on the drays. Ronald's inventive genius rose at the sight of one of those enjpty dry casks. He said nothing to hie wife about it, for he determined to work out his idea, and surprise her with the brightness of the finished conception. He placed the cmk on its bilge, and beginning about & foot from the chine, cut straight across tbe staves with a saw till about hqlf were severed ; then turning the ^wk up on to the enS nearest to which he had cut, he sawed the opposite bead across the middle, on a level with the tops o! tbe whole staves below the firstmentioned cut All that had to be done then was to cat through the wooden hoops on either side, npj the smaller section came off^ leaving a very elegant cradle. Of course a few naOs were required to keep the hoops and staves together ; and, in defiance of past experience, the inevitable pair of rockers were fitted, completing the work. Ada was struck with wonder and admiration when introduced to tbe finished article, and gave the maker quiet as much praise as he was entitled to. ficr deft fingers, and good taste, soon accomplished the padding and covering. A friend who was invited to inspect it, pronounced it to be ?ual to anything of the kind ever turned oat a Regent-street shop. Thus, then, did the restless form of that embodiment of all *miJI human perfections — Ronald Brandon W'-lton, heir of the house of Walton — torn, ^h«pH^, or sleep, as the humour took Mm, witiiin the staves of a dry porter cask ! When be was put into the gorgeous crib for the first time, Ron. had, what is known in bush pnHar^q, aa a 'shine.' The word, as meant here, is not to be found in some of the best ffogti1**1 dic tionaries, bat certainly ought to appear in efl future editions, because it is so expressive. He was put in by Mtt mother, carefully tucked in, well-kissed, and the mnsqaito curtains curanged to perfection, fifth ^M^iPir and mother sat down by the crib to see how the cherub would take it. They thought that as he must infinitely more tvnn fa^toMf* thfr in his Late bed — the soap box — he would drop off ' like a lamb.' He, however, did not see it in the same light as they did. Children of hjq age sometimes do hold opposite opinions to papa*B and man-imft^ especially in nrfittfTf somnolemc ; and when they do — veil, wbo wins ? Ron. was too comfortable, and the gay new surroundings took his fancy f»™i excited him. He lay so quiet far some *a**»*» that they thought he was asleep, and were about to Leave him to hiq iw^fuxfnl slumbers, bet he faad half his onpillowed eye upon them, end when they rose and put out the light, he quietly .sat ud and whimpered beseechingly. ' Dear pappy, do put the dark out !' By which he meant, Light the candle Again, aad of course it was done. Then, with a «*h'**^, he **T^lfljTppHt ** Flap up noo bye hyp. Ronny !** which, being interpreted, meant ' Rouny's new bed is slap np !rf . ' You wicked little angel ! I thought you were off for the night. Go too sleep,' «*id hi* mother. *' Bo peep, mamma,' «*'d he, chxtchiog tly* mosquito -Tir*'-ain with both ^ftf*^'. and praM* ing his chubby face against it. Then he dived under everything, DedclotheB, mattress and all, and ^f-wip op on the other *-^f , ** Bomay have good drcp TT^^ftT *^»t ^'Wi l»fe*» pappy,' he PTrlH-imp^, Mowing, *™i nhrking lis head, and pretending to wipe ths water from his face and curls with his hands. ** Go to sleep, you bad boy !'* «*-M his father very sternly, but Ron. knew be did not mean it. He laid down, however, and began to snore, bat all his dimples showing with roguery, ' I flecp now,' he said ; then suddenly jumping up, he stood on his head and tips of sis toes. From that position, be tuned on to his back, and tried a variety of juggling and acrobatic tricks with his feet and hands, such as balancing his pillow and Iri firing it into the air. His father's threats and his mothers wk ill in somnipathy failed, but when such un due excitement at that hour of the evening has been indulged in by an imp of his eflsfly reckonud years for soch a length of time, ?- crisis niust come. He was no exception to the rule. He attempted a somersault; the curtain becoming involved was rent from the canopy, and Rou. fell over the side and Landed on the floor, enveloped in the net. Oh ! such a screech from mother and child, and such a Laugh from tbe original Ronald .? The imp indications of broken bones or internal injuries were discovered, and he sobbed huuself to sleep ou lij;s mother's hip. ( To U ooutinwd. )
