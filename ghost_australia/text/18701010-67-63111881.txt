I shall novov forgot your look when yon. saw absolutely asldid Miss H. standing nt tho door.. You knited perfectly aghast. I thought my aunt ndyanccd towards me, nnd said twico in her usual voice, but very reproachfully, 'Why did you not. tell mo my mother was dead ? ' After these'words i sho rotraccd her stops, and wo heard her as I thought retiro to her room." Of courso I laughed at Sophie forher dream, ns I ' callod it, but sho persisted in taking a note of tho day and hour. Threo months after a lotter arrived, from England, stating that old Mrs. H.-that is, Mr : H.'s mother-had died on the 2!Jrd of April, at a, quarter past ten p.m. Thus ends my chapter on ' (Jhosts.
