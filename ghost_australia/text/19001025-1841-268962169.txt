W NOVELIST. LAYING A GHOST. [BY GEORGE ITAKTKDC TENS} "It is of no use for you to 'talk, Mary," I said, quite angrily, " a piofessto'nal man- has no right to sit still taking liis patients' fees without constantly striving after liigter knowledge for tlieir benefit" " Of comse not, dear," said my wife, gently—by the way, she always does speak gently—""but yon study too much." "Nonsense 1" •".'-'• '•:•:*• o •.-' •: "Indeed, dear, but you do. Your forehead is growing full of lines, and your Iian- is turning quite grey," "All the better. People do notlike young-loolang doetois." : But you do work too hard, ileal." j " Absurd! I feel as if I mustbev a mere idler, Mary; and at a tune, foo, •when it se.ems as if medicine was quiie at a stand. Surgery has made wonderful strides, but the physician is nowhere." " What nonsense, dear, when:everybody says that yon are; the cleverest doctor for -fifty miles round ; and at such tinies I feel as if I could lass the person who saicj so." "'Everybody' is a goose; and, goose or no, don't you let jno catch you -kissing.tliem^.'-.: There;'.be..oH,. little one, and let me get on with roywork. 1 ' «Work, work; always work," she said, with a pretty pout of•"• the lips; which invited what they received, with the result that, my happy young wife went out smiling while: ! sat. down to think. I was young and very- enthusiastic in those days. Bather vara., too, and disposed to look down upon what 1 called the "oldfogies of the profession." I meant to make great discoveries in medicine for the benefit of suffering humanity, and for my own benefit too, I'm afraid. Oonseqnently--I confess it—I Was a dangerous kind of doctor, and always itching to try experiments. 1 At the timo of winch I am speaking,- I was mad upon a new remedy which I believed I had discovered for' the nervous state consequent upon the failure of the digestive powers in people of middle age ; and it was upon , this remedy that 1 now sat clown to. think in my little consulting-room and; dispensary combined.. I had been pondering over the subject then for months, and the more I thought the more convinced I was that my remedy would .work wonders, but for want of test cases I was completely in the dark. I had got so fa;:, though, that I had given myself full confidence in the correctness of my deductions ; all I wanted was trial:— experiment on the vile body of man, so as to make sure. • . . , " How to procced ?" I said to myself. as I sat amongst my bottles and drags, tapping the table with my finger nails—"how to proceedr I must try it upon a patient, bat it is not fair or just to try. experiments upon one who confides in you. Suppose my ideas are wrong—suppose ; it is a fallacy?" .'-. '."' These thoughts troubled me so that I grew feverish, and my head burned. jumping up from roy chair, I took . clean tumbler from a shelf, half filled it'from a seltzogene which stood on the. table, tossed off the sparkling, water, put back the tumbler:and-resumed my seat, feeling 'decidedly better and clearer. " How to proceed ? " I said again, "I cannot, I must not try it upon a patient. It would not be just. Upon whom, then ? Mary I " " Perish the. thought 1" cried dramatically. " To deceive her would be ten times worse." :':.; : '; T --i " But I might- tell her first. •••'. She would take it—bless licr!—if I told her." "$To—no—no—no 1 " I cried: and then, lialf aloud, " If the experiment must be tried, and you have so much faith in it, try it upon yourself, like a man!" i v;--. I sprang up .once more with all. kinds of -unpleasant notions beginning to haunt me. Suppose the dose failed— suppose it.- proved fatal—suppose I were suddenly called away without having .time' to explain! .to a brother medical nTan what 1 had taken. " Why, they, would bring it • in suicide, and my - wife would be a -widow," I exclaimed with a ..chill.'of horror seeming to make my blood run sluggishly through my veins. But this was momentary. I recovered my strength of: mind directly,, and, unlocking my desk, I took out a bottle containing a white powder, which I shook and held up to the light : " I'll try one drachm first," I said. " Too much. No : it would be absurd : to trifle with it. How can I get . satisfactory result if I do not proceed boldly with .my, test I xAm I ;g.oiiig :to play the coward after all ? " i-J - I went . to the: shelf were the bottles stood, aud took down the one labelled Sp. Ym., liaving determined to combine a stimulant with the drug, which would, I knew, from former expedience; dissolve m-spuit, but to my cliagrm, the bottle was .completely empty. " Biandy will do," I said to myself; and, after replacing the bottle, I went oat and into -the dining-room to fetch one of the three from- the spirit stand, hut found-that it contents- , were con.^; fined to about a "B ine glassful " That would be enough," I thought, and going baefcanto-my vconsultingrsroom^ I set the little decanter down -removed <ho* stopper, and my/hand., trembled a little 5 as I poni'ed in^-tlie white powder, a mere-pinch, but" full T of potency.
