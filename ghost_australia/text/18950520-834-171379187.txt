Caldwell at Springfield. j4. Bsnc's the spot. Look around yon. Above on tho height , ' Lay the Hessians encamped..;. By the ohnreh on the right Stood the gaunt Jersey farmers. And here ran a wall Ton may dig anywhere end yon will torn up a : ball. Nothing more. Grasses spring, waters run, flowers blow Pretty mueh as they did ninety- throe years Nothing more did I say ? Stay one moment ; you've heard Of Caldwell, the parson who onco preaohed the word Down at Springfield? What 1 No? Come, that's bad. Why he had All the Jerseys aflame. And they gave him ' the name Of 4V»p tl vaVial TiirtTt nnaii ' TTa a^nal. tn tViotw For lo loved the Lord Qod — and he hated King George 1 He had oanse, you might say, when the Hes sians that day Uarohed up with Enyphausen, they stopped on their way At the ' Farms,' where his wife, with a child in her arms, Sat alone in the house. How it happened none knew But God — and one of the hireling crew Who fired the shot. Enough 1 There she lay, And Caldwell, the ohaplain, her husband, away I Did he preaoh — did he pray ? Think of him, as yon stand By the old ohuroh to-day ; think of him and that band Of military cowboys I See the Bmoke and tho heat Of that reeklesB advance— of that struggling retreat 1 Keep the ghost of that wife foully slain in your view — And what could you — what should you, what would you do ? Why, just what he did 1 They were left in the lurch, For want of more wadding. He ran to the ohurch, Broke the door, stripped the pews, and dashed out in the road With his armB full of hymn-books and threw down his load At their feet 1 Then above all the . shouting and shots Bang his voice : ' Put Watts into 'em, boys ; give 'em Watts.' And they did. That is all. Grasses spring, flowers blow, Pretty mueh as they did ninety-three years ago: Ton may dig anywhere and you'll turn up a ball, But not always a hero like this— and that's all. Bret Hakte.
