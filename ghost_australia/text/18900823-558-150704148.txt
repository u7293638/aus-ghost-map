LOVE OF LIFE. Phrenologists have assigned to a pro tuberance under the ear the faculty of " vitativeness," or love of life, and some of them assume that in proportion to the size of the bump is the strength of the vital element in the individual- However this may be, that the love of life is intense in some minds, and scarcely exists at all in others,[j nobody, of course, will deny ; and it is no less true that persons who earnestly desire to live can keen a mortal disease at hay any longer than those who are comparatively indifferent to their fate. The tenacity with which some men cling to life is marvellous. AYe had an instance of this in the case of a noted pugilist, several years ago, who was shot in the breast during a bar-room scuffle, and liis condition was pronounced hope less by the surgeons. But he scoffed at their opinions, :tnd actually lived several days -with a ball in his heart, keeping his hold upon life—so it seemed—by sheer force of -will. A reso lute determination not to succumb, is, as ever}- anny surgeon knows, tbe salvation of many a wounded soldier, wbo-without it would assuredly die. In the Crimean war the mortalify among the wounded Turks was much greater than among the wounded French and English. The latter wrestled stoutly -with death, and often baffled him when their doom seemed inevitable: hut the predestinarian Mussulman, when dangerously injured, said gloomily, " It is my kismet" (fate), turned his face towards Mecca, and gave up the ghost. There can be no doubt that love of life and vigour of will have been tbe means of restoring to health thousands of patients who hut for these mental ehrracteristics must have perished. —JSew i ork Lcwjer.
