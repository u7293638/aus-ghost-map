• FREMANTLE AMATEUR DRAMATIC COMPANY. The entertainment given by this . Company last evening at the Odd Fellows' Hall was witnessed by an enthusiastic if not a crowded audience. The performance commenced with the Ghost scene from Hamlet. We think that a single act of a play, that nine-tenths of such an audience cannot possibly understand, having never seen the like, is a great mistake, and however well the characters may be sustained will never be appreciated. Both Messrs. Pearce and Solomon did their characters very fairly, perhaps a little less action would be an improvement. , Mr. MorriB next gave a very pleasing and practical song, Wait for the turn of the tide. We notice that he seemingly prefers/the Harmonium accompaniment to that of the piano-forte; in this we do not agree with him. The farce of Two in the morning by Messrs.M. Samson and F. Oliver, kept the audience in a continual roar of laughter. We have always considered Mr. Samson perfect in comedy, and he did ' noji disappoint us last night. Mr. Oliver has improved greatly in his acting—therais no embarassment; on the 'contrary he seems to possess that indispensible quality in a good actor— confidence. §Ir< Mofris again sang two songs As rd nothing else to do and the Song of the St. Laiorerwe Boatmen. The performance concluded with a scene from Box and Cox which like the second piece, Two in the morning, caused a deal of merriment: we must give both Messrs. Pearce and Solomon the credit of having sustained their parts admirably. The pugilistic encounter especially, was excellently done. We invariably notice the ill behaviour of • the boys at theso entertainments; there is something disgusting about such low juvenile rowdyism—their conduct is a nuisance to all who go to hear and see the performance, and it would be to the advantage of the Corps to see that the police keep them in order.
