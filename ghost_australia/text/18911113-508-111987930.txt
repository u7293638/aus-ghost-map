So the Wanderer went on sick at heart,, aheeting n© shafts anil sta&kzaggne; blow, ana atter nxm. came tne re&ssmnt; ef the host of Phwauih. . Now they w«re came ever agaiast that ispot in the {wall where stood the aged Captain of ike Achseans, who had likened -phe armt»r «f the Wanderer to the armor of gParis, and the Beauty of her at his side to ?the beauty of Argive Helen. The Captain lotted his bow at the jchanot, and, le&ai-og; forward, watched the ' ifiigkt «f tiie shaft. It jEOEthed straight at j iBeWs breast, then of A sudden turned j .aside, harming her aot. And as he mar- | Veiled she lifted her face and looked towards him. Then, he saw and kaew her j for that Helen whom he had seen while he ] served with Cretan Idezaeneus and in the ! Argiva sMps, when the l&gaer; was done i and the Bat«ki» went up, from baxsiasr 1 Hies. ^ . . Again he lo&ked;, and lo! on the Waaderer's golden shield he saw the White Bullj, the ;de\ice of Paris, son of paam, ae oftimes He had eeea it gjittex^n Mnl/and he lifted up his hand a^ ?caxv^\'s^^^sa^:^imj, firkin i^s a^rrseii. ;li»«L-v '0i^\'i^Siier'''-'-ht. t^^'i^Bdtpt; :''«*aiidaj; Argive Hftiea, wh© is long dead^iaii&d; with' her PariSj.soa of Priaaa, ceme to wreiafc the ;Tvoes of llios on the eras of tizose who : iratsted her.

Then a great,cry «f- fear rose fi»m the Shost of 'flie A^haeaiiB,;«s,comJcaaiy oailsd t» compaby I3feat ifee glfe^te «f Paris, «f Hios, and Argive Helen, led the armies of Pharaoh on to victory. A moment they gazed as frightened sheep gaz* upea the tereeping w«rves, ifaen twaixug from the wall, they rns&ed; headlong to the skips. Asd as the bub. went &awn; the last ship was poshed off anal ike great battle iras done. But sx&agig; tisose on'tSe ship was a man stall ywmg, and Okie gv'GidHest and mightiest aaneisg all iMe fipst of the Acfeaeans. By his own atreEg^b. and valor he had held the Egyptians liack while his eoanxades ran the curved ship d«wn the beach, and ^ie Wanderer, looking on him, deemed him their hardiest warrior and most worthy csf th« Achseans. He stood upen the' poop of the ship and saw ? the setting rays of saxdight gleam on the Wan derer's golden helm. -; Then of a sudden he drew a mighty bow amd loosed an arrow charged with death. «- This gift to the GhoBt ©f Paris from Telegonus, son of Circe and of Odysseus, who was Paris'* foe,' he cried with a loud voice. And as he cried it, and as the fate ful words struck en the ears of Qdyescus and the ears of Helen, the shaft pointed by the G©ds jruehed en, and smt-te the Wanderer with a deadly wouad. Then he Knew vaax xua rate was aeeompiiflnea ana that deatii came upon him freza the water, as the ghest of Tixesias in Hades had fore told. In his paia, for theTlast time ef all, he let fall his sfeield and the black bow of Eurytus. With one hand he clasped the rail of the chariot asd the other he threw about the n«ck «f the Golden Helen, who bent beneath Ms weight like a lily before the storm. Then he also cried aloud ia answer— « 0, Telegvwaus, son of Circe, what wicked ness hast t&ou; wrought before the awful Grods that this curse should have been laid upon thee to slay him who begat thee ? Hearken th«u son of Circe, I am not Paris. I am Odysseus of Ithaca, who begat thee, and thou hast brsiught my death upon me from ike waiter, as the ghost foretold.' When Telegeaus heard t&ese; words and knew that he had slain his father, the famed Odysseus, wkom he Tiad sought the whole world through, he would have cast himself inio the river, andthere be drowned, but those with him held: him. by strength, aad the streaun teek the curved, ship and floated it away. Now the chariots of Meriamun. were pursuing, and they splashed through the blood of men ia the 'pass, and rolled over ithe bodies of men in the plain beyend the pass. Tfrey cjaofi to the camps and found, them peopled -with dfeajd, and lit with the lamps of the blaainjg shq»s of the AotLstizLusha.. Tlajea. W'&~rZ**ift ' ^ creed alo,ud— — 1 ' Surely Pkaraph grew wise before he died,; for there is bulrose man ©a the earth who: with so sittail a force could have won so: great a ±ray. He hath savod the croitm of SZkem, and byC^tiris he shail wear it.' The Wanderer lay dyiag on the gtaand^ there by the riSar bank and the light of the feuiHiag snips f^ned on the golden «,raior,aad on &e; Star at Helen's breast. ' Why do the soldiers sMeut ?' he asked, lifting his head from Helen's breast. ' They sh»ut beasaaase Mezxaaiun ^4 Queen is come,' Bei aztswered. . . *' Let her come,' said the Wanderer. Now Merxaamra sprang from her chariot and walked through the soldiers who made way bowing before hex Royalty to where the Waasderer lay, and stood speechlese loakin-g en Mm. But idte Wanderer lifting his head spake faia&y;— 'Hail, Oh Queen!' he said, « I h«wre aceempliaked the charge thsdb Pharsoh laid upon me. wkere is PkarAdh th»t I may Biake report to iim ere I die?' 'Piiaraok is dead, Odysseus,' she answered. ' Oh, itre on ! live on ! and thyself them shalt be Pharaoh.' -*Ay, Meriamun the Queen,' answered the Wanderer, -« I know all. Thou didst slay Phafcaah, thinking thus to win for thj Lord, me, who am won ef Death, Heavilj shall the blood of Pharaoh -Cae upon thee in that land wMifeer I go, Mftrjatia-Bn, and whither thjsu mast fellow swiftly.

' Thou diest indeed, Odyssena,,yjet it is but for a lifetie thae, for thoti shalt come again and find me wait ing.' « Ay , OdyjjscaB,' s*id the Queen, «« and I ^also 'wHl coWe wgsfiai aad thon sEalt love me then.

But aot yet is the straggle ended that began in other -worlds thaa. this, aad shall eadure till evil is lost ia good, aad dark- ' ness swallowed up ia light.

' Th«u hast but last to find again boy«ad the Gateways of the W«Bt,' she »mr»rered low. Then she beat down, and taking him ia her* arms, kissed him, whisperiag|ia bis ] oar of joy to be and things too holy to be written, and the €aceof the Wanderer grew bright like tke face of a God. Then suddenly his haad fell 'back aad he was dead,iapoa the heart ?£ th© World's Besxte. Now Meriamun clispexl her breast and turaed wMte withpam. But Helea xose^ ?ad fttft%diog jit 'Sfct WwKdfiifar'i pud. looked on Meriamun, who . stood at his feet. ' Then foolish sister,' said Helen to th« Queen, ' see now the ead ef all. He whom we loved is lost to us, and what hast them gained P Nay, look not so fiercely on me. I may aot be harmed by thee, as thon.kasl seen, aad thjou mayest not be hauaed oi me, who would harm aoae, though evei thou wilt hate me who hate thee mot, aad till thou learaest to love me Sin shakl fee thy pertioa aad BitfeerneBs thy comfort.' But Meriamun made no answer. Tkea Helen Beckoned to Eei aad spake to him, and Eei went weeping to do hej bidding. Presently he returned again, ?aad with him were soldiers beairiag torses. Tk« soldiers lifted up the body of the Wan derer, aad bere it to a mighty pyre tkat was built up of the weafSi of the Bar barians.

' From Fire then. came&$, tk©u aa^teat Evil,' she said, in a diaad ttmgxe; ' to Fire get thea back again, false Ctotcasel lor.' But Bel the Priest called aloud in thv game tongue — ' An ill deed thon.hast d«ae, O Queea,- for thou hast taken tae Snake totisy besooa, and where the Snake passes tkere ti»o j«-ust follow.'
