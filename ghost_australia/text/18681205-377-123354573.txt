THE POPE'S APOSTOLIC LETTER. The following is the text of the apostolic letter ad dressed to all Protestant and non-Catholic bodies : Pinus, Sovereign Pontiff, Ninth of the Name, to all Protestants and other non-Catholics. You must already all know that we who, despite our unworthiness, have been raised to the throne of Poeter, and therefore have been advanced to the supreme government of the whole Catholic Church and to its administration, which has been entrusted to us in Divine fashion by Christ Himself, our Lord -we have judged it fttig to summon before us all our venerable brethren, tile bishops of all the world, and to convene them in an ceomenical council, which is to be celebrated next year in such a manner that, with those same venerable brethren who have been summoned to take part in this the subject of our solicitude, we may be able to adopt all the most op portuno and necessary resolutions to dissipate the shadows of so large a number of pestilential errors which daily are extending their power and license to the great prejudice of souls, and daily more and more to establish and strengthen among the Christian people committed to our watchful care the reign of the true faith, of justice, and of the true peace of God. Relyiog, then, with a firm confidence upon tlhe close and naffectionate bond of union which unites those our same venerable brothers to our person and to the apostolic see, and who hIave never ceased at any period of our pontificate to give to us and to the apostolic see the most striking evidences of faithl, of love, and of respect, we truly lhope thlat, as it has been in times past with other general councils, so it may be in the present, and that this ecumenical council convokled by us may bring forth, with the help of the Divine grace, the most rich and most fertile fruits, to the great glory of God and thle eternal welfare of man. Therefore, in that hope, and instigated and encou raged by thie charity of our Lord Jesus Christ, who laid down His life for the salvation of the world, we cannot forbear, on the occasion of the meeting of the next council, addressing our apostolic and paternal word to all those who, while recognising that same Jesus Christ as our Sariour, and rejoicing in the name of Christians, yet still do not profess the veritable faith of Christ or follow the communion of tIe Catholic C?hurc'. And if we do so, it is, before all, to warn, exhort, and supplicate them with all our zeal and all our charity to consider and seriously examine if they in truthll followed the path prescribed by our Lord Jesus Christ, and which leads to eternalhappiness. In fact, no one can deny or doubt that Jesus Christ HIimsslf, in order that all future human generations should enjoy the fruit of His redemption, built up here below His Church in the person of Peter-that is to say, the Church, one, holy, Catholic and apostolic -and that He granted to him all the necessary power in order that the faith should be preserved mntact and entire, and that the same faith should be transmitted to all peoples, to all races, and to all nations in such a manner thlat all men should be able to be united in His mystical body in baptism, and always to preserve in themselves until the entire development that new life of grace without which no one can ever merit or obtain life eternal, so that the same Church which constitutes the mystical body shall remain, until the end of time, firm and inde structible in its own constitution, developed in vigour, and furnishing to its children all that is necessary for Now, whoever wishes well to consider and examine with attention the different religious societies divided among themselves, and separated from the Catholic Church, which, since tbhe time of the Lord Jesus Christ and His apostles, has always uninterruptedly exercised, and still exercises, by means of its legiti mate pastors, the power entrusted to her by our Lord Himself-whoever, we say, shall thus examine, will easily convince himself that not one of those religious societies, nor all the religious societies together, con stitutes or in any way can be considered the one and only Catholic Church which our Lord Jesaus Christ founded, constituted, and desired-should see that they cannot in any way be regarded as a member or as a port of that same Clhurch, because they are visibly separated from all Catholic unity. As, in fact, those societies are deprived of that living authority established by God, who pointed out to mankind, be fore all things, the matter of faith and the rule of morality, who directed and presided over them in all things affecting their eternal welfare, therefore those societies themselves constantly varied in their dooe trine, and thus this instability is oneeasing. Every one can easily comprehend that this state of things is altogether opposed to the Church estab lished by Christ our Lord-a Church in which the truth must always rest unaltered, without being the sunbject to any .ehange, as a charge entrusted to that same Church, in order lthat she may preserve it in all its integrity, a charge for the care of which the presence of the Holy Ghost and its aid has been granted for ever to this Church. No one can ignore the fact that these differences of doctrine and opinion give rise to the social schisms, and that therefrom spring those innumerable soots and communions which are daily increasing to the de. triment of Christian and civil society. Whoever, in fact, recognises religion as the founda tion of human society cannot refuse to admit aend avow the influence exercised over civilised society by those divisions and disagreements of principles of that nature, and of religious societies struggling one with the other; and also with what power the denial of authority established by God to regulate the convic tions of the hIuman intelligence, and to direct the actions of men both in their social and private life, has excited, has developed, and has fomented those most unfortunate troubles, those events, and thoe disturbances which agitate and afect almost all nations in a most deplorable mauner. Therefore, in order that all those who are not instilled with the principles of the unity and truth of the Catholic Church should seize the occasion offered to them by this council, in which the Catholic Church, to which their ancestors belonged, shows a proof of its complete unity, of its vigour, and of its unextinguish able vitality; that they should obey the necessities of their hearts; that they should strive to bear them selves away from that ptate in which they cannot be arsssred of their salvation. That they should address without ceasing the most I fervent prayers to God that he should dissipate the cloud of error, and that he should bring them back into the bosom of the Church, our holy mother, where their ancestors received the salutary nourish ment of life, and alone preserves in its integrity the doctrine of Jesus Christ, handing it down and dis pensing the mysteries of celestial grace. We, therefore, ought most zealously to fulfil all the duties of a good pastor, in accordance with the charge of our apostolic ministry entrusted to us by Christ our Lord Himself, and who ought to embrace all men in the world in our paternal charity, we address this letter to all Christians separated from us -a letter in which we exhort and supplicate them to hasten to return to the fold of Christ. It is because we heartily desire their salvation in Jesus Christ, and fear one day to have to render an account of their soul to that same Jesus Christ, our Judge, if we do net point out to them and open to them as much as is in us the way which they must follow if they would gain their salvation. Also, in all our prayers and supplieations, and while performing acts of grace, we never cease bumbly to ask for them, both by night and day, the celestial light and the ablundance of grace from the eternal Pastor of souls. And whereas, despite our unworthi ness, we fulfi61 upon earth the functions of the Vicar of Christ, we await with open arms the return of those wandering sons to the Catholic Church, in order that we may be able to receive them with all affection into the dwelling of the celestial Father, and make them participators in His overlasting treasures. It is that much-wisbhed for return to the truth and communion of the Catholic Church upon which de pends not only the salvation of each one in particular, but of the whole Christian society; and the world will never enjoy true peace until it forms one flock under one pastor. Goivn at Rome, at St. Peter's, Sept. 13, 1868, in the 23rd year olf our pontificate. One of the candidates for the representation of the group of northern burghs (Rawick, &e.;) in Scotland, has had his chances cut off very prematurely by his arrest on a charge of tampering with the letters of a lady against whom he had once broughet an action for breach of promise. The postman who put the letters into his hands ihas been arrested with him, and both are committed for trial.--Courlier's correpondentl THE QuEEn'S HEALTIu.-- We (ritisl~ i Medical Journal) regret to say that the paragraph iln last Saturday's Laoccf respecting the health of Her Mfajcesty has very little foundation. The health ofthe Queen bas, we hope, received some benefit from the change of air and scelie, and rest from her onerous public duties; but, while Her Majesty will continue, as horetofore, to regulate public business, the Queen will not, we fear, be able to bear the fatiguing excite meat of a lengthened residence in London, and of the continued receptions attendant on such cireumstances.
