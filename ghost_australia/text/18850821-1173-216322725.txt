poetry Caldwell at Springfield. HERE'S the spot. Look around you. Above on the height Lay the HessisnB encamped. By the church on the right Stood the gaunt Jersey farmers. And here ran a wall— You may dig anywhere and you will turn up a ball. Nothing more. Grasses spring, waters run, flowers blow Pretty much as they did ninety-three years ago. Nothing more did I say ? Stay one moment; you've heafd Of Caldwell, the parson who once preached tbe word Dewn at Springfield? What! No? Come, that's bad. Why he had All the Jerseys aflame. And they gave him the name Of the " rebel high priest." He etuck in their gorge, For he loved the Lord God—and be hated King George I He had cause, you might say, when the Hessians that day Marched up with Knyphausen, they stopped eh their way At the " Farms," where his wife, with a child in her arms, Sat alone in the house. How it happened none knew But God—and one of the hireling crew Who firedthe shot. Enough! There she lay, And Caldwell, the chaplain, her husband, away ! Did be preach—did be pray ? Think of him, as you stand By the old ohurch to-day; think of him and that band Of military cowboys! See the smoke and the heat Of that reckless advance—of that struggling retreat 1 Keep the ghost of that wife foully slain in your view— And what could you—what should you, what would you do ? Why, just what he did! They were left in the lurch, For want of more wadding. He ran to the ohurch, Broke the door, stripped the pews, and dashed out in the road With his arms full of hymn-books and threw down his load At their feet! Then above all the shouting and shots Rang his voice: " Ptft Watts into 'em, boys; give 'em Watts." And they did. That is all. Grasses spring, flowers blow, Pretty much as they did ninety-three years ago: You may dig anywhere and you'll turn up a ball, But not always a hero like this—and that's all. BEET HASTE.
