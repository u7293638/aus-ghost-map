THE HOSTESS O!P THE R£VEN. fProm .422 ifte Tear Sound, 1 '; (ConcludedJ ' . The boy, Hanseli^as' they called him, was docile enough, and allowed himself to be led away unhesitatingly. But the girl at first refused to aio^e, and it was not until Alois had hit on the expedient of saying that, her mother was calling for her, and would be angry* she delayed, that the, girl jEollowed her brother and Alois out of the house. Hanselihad.no sooner got into the churchyard than he hastened with his shuffling pace towards the door of a cowshed or stable, and showed, some anxiety to have it opened. ' ' The creature has more sense than we thought,'' observed Lorenz. ' ^°, doubt there are some beasts there, and he wants to save them.' . ' ,-/ .'.''' But it 'soon proved that such was not the boy's object. There were, indeed, a couple of goats in the stable, but of these he took no heed. He went straight to a heap of straw at the farther end, and then we perceived that the eldest son, Kudolph, was stretched there fast asleep. His. pinched ' features and gaunt form looked pitiably haggard, as he lay in the profound slumber of utter weariness. The men shook him by the shoulder and called in his. ears, and he opened a pair of wild eyes and rolled, them from one to another, evidently without any recbg-. nition, tihtil he cauglrt Bight of the idiot boy, when he at once rose up on to his feet, and confronted us fiercely. The blacksmith addressed him in a quiet tone of command. 'Come, Rudolph,' said he, - ' the Schwarzbach is rising. We're afraid the house may come down. They are lashing tree trunks to the bank of the stream, and we want you to help us.' The young man looked eagerly at the speaker for a moment, and then there came from his mouth the most hollow,, unearthly^ and horrible voice I have ever heard emitted by a human creature. ' It seemed as* if the act of speaking were so unusual as to be painful. 'Is the devil drowned V lie asked. ' Jeau Maria !' answered Alois, cross ing himself several times in rapid suc cession. ?'...'. 'Come with me, and we will see,5' answered Lorenz, with a good; deal of adlf possesBion. ' You have a good /strong arm of your own; lad. Come, and help US.' : ??'.. ' . ; ' .'' . ; . ?'? ^ 'Can he not teli us where his mother is ?' said I, detaining Lorenz as he was about to leave the courtyard. ' Oh, what's the use of ' asking him 1' interposed the watchman, Alois, who was evidently afraid of the young man, and anxious to get rid of him. ' Any way, you see that the old woman cant be mur dered. There's ho one to murder her. No creature ' lives in the Raven, nor has lived there for years, but Frau Dietrich and her brood. And it's clear that all three hare been downstairs, in the dens they sleep in, all night.' When I reiterated my account of the struggle and the cries I bad heard, he declared either that I must have been dreaming, or that the ghosts had made the noise, or that the brothers and sister had been fighting and quarrelling, as was their wont. It was true that Rudolph, Theresa, and the idiot had been found in apparent quietude in their usual lairs (beds, they could not be termed) r but nothing Alois could say would avail to persuade me out of the, evidence of my senses. Besides, those sounds had come from above, not from below, who had made them % ' Come out to the others with me now,' whispered Lorenz, plucking me signifi cantly by the sleeve. .'We will return afterwards to the house, and search, for the old woman.9' ' : ' - Outside on the borders of the stream there was much movement and confusion. The number of workers had been in creased by a considerable accession of villagers from Falkenau. Lanterns glim mered and glanced here and there ; but they showed dim and yellow in the pure light of the full moon, which now poured herrayson the scene, as if to show the extent of the danger and devastation. The Schwarzbach was terrible to look upon. It Tushed along, a foaming, Taging flood, bearing on its rapid iide number less wrecks and fragments of -mountain dwellings, and the bodies of animals from the high pastures; The wooden paling, which had surrounded the garden of the Raven- Iain, was gone. ^Phe~ sheds And stabling at the back were tottering and crackling, with every pulse of the -waters which now beat ^against their wails. The old house stood firm, for the course of 'the Schwarzbach in -that direction had been * little checked by the piles of timber lashed to the 'bank. Among the workers, : the lunatic Ru dolph displayed prodigious activity. ' His strength was amazing, and he dragged great beams of wood arid tree-trunks to the water's - brink with -frenzied -A eager ness. ; Tiie idiot boy stood near, smiling, clapping' ^ his /iands, and shrilling: Ms litany louder and .louder ias the: waves rose highensad spreadia wider ruin. -?.';:.

' Hasteri!' criea! the blacksmith, and we rushed up ^the1 staircase t\after him. : We! opened tiie : doors of onO rebm z after another along the corridor. They were empty, most; of them unfurnished, all dirty arid neglected. The door of the room I had occupied was still locked. The%ey was on the outside. We looked in. It was just as I had left it. . 'There is no storey above this,' said the young man who carried a lantern. 'We have seen all the rooms. Perhaps the old witch has rldderi off -m a broomstick.'* But there were rooms abovei as I well knew. And after a minute's search we found a low door in one angle at the darkest end of the corridor. This door opened into a steep staircase, leading to some garrets in the roof. Hardly had I set my feet on the first step^ when a door was violently opened, and there emerged 'from the darkness into thelight--f our lanterns, the figure of 'tttfe hostess of the Rayen ! We all paused and looked up at her as she stood on the top of the ladder-like staircase. Her, hideous face was distorted with rage. Her grey locks weire tossed in wild confusion round her head and neck. The dark jacket she wore was rent and torn away from her yellow throat, arid her sinewy-fiands were: covered with re cent scars. ' What do you here ?' she croaked, as we stood speechless before so revolting an apparition. ' Do you know this is my house? Mine! Have you broken in like thieves in the night ? { £ Frau Dietrich,' said the blacksmith, ' we have no time for quarrelling or argument. If we have broken into your house, you must guess why we have done She started back and clutched at a great knotty stick which leant againstthe wall behind her, and which we had not seen before. ' Go back ! ' she shrieked almost inarticulate with fury. ' Go back, or it will be worse fojr you ! ' ' Woman,-' cried I, 'have you not heard the horn ? Have you not felt the Fohn ? The Schwarzbach has overflowed. We are here to save you; Your, daughter and your sons are in safety. Come with us.' She seemed surprised, and irresolute for a moment. Lorenz took advantage of her hesitation. He stepped up and seized her wrist . : ' * * Come,' said he, * . there is no time to lose. The house inay go do^ri ^ at any moment and bury us in the ruins.' ' Let it go, the old house, and all that is in it!' she mattered, with a wild toss of her dishevelled head. Bat she seemed disposed to accompany Lorenz. She had, indeed, descended a couple of steps,' he still holding her by the wrist, when the blacksmith bad« his .two apprentices take care of the Raben-wirthin, and bring her safely out of the house, and whispered to me to remain with him for a moment, he had a search to make. The woman's, quick ear caught the whisper, She shook herself free of him (in an instant, and with one bound she was back at the head of the staircase and confronting us fero ciously. 'You dogs,' she panted out, ' you accursed hounds, you are trying to deceive me. Leave my house ; begone ! Let it stand or fall, it shall not harbor such as you. If there is law in the canton you shall repent this.' 4 ' Best not talk of law, mother Diet-: rich,' -returned the blacksmith resolutely. ' I tell you I have my reasons for lookr ing into these garrets. And by Heaven I'll not quit the house till I' ve done so. Let me pass.'5 She aimed a sudden blow at him with the. knotted stick, but he had anticipated her attack, and avoided the blow by a quick, side movement. Then he rushed upon her and pinioned her arms to her sides. Powerful man as he was, he could not hold her single-handed, so violent were her struggles, so astonishing her strength. But the two apprentices came to his assistance and succeeded in binding her arms with the ropes they carried. It all -passed quicker than I can tell it. 'Stay, and guard her for a moment,''; shouted Lorenz to his men. ' And you, sir, come with me!' I followed him to the head of the stairs and into a low garret, the massive door of which was open.. He held up his lantern and looked around. 'My God !' he .cried, 'it is worse than I thought.' , I had paused at the threshold, being absolutely beaten back by the intolerable stench and closeness of the air. But on hearing the blacksmith's exclamation I advanced.; and this is what I saw :— . - .A; low garret with a sloping roof - in which was one hole to admit light, un glazed, but defended by iron bars. Walls foul .and blackened with the dirt of years. A floor heaped with dust, and filth un speakable. Ncr«hair,no table, no bed; but on the floor ia one corner a ragged mattress, which ; I would riot: have given a dog to lie on, and on the mattress a human form. *f What is it?' Lorenz looked round at me as Tasked the question. 'It was a woinan,' said he. 'Lord have mercy: on us ! ' -. *?Was3- Is she dead P''., ^a knelt .down beside the creature on thWmattress and looked more closely. It wa3:a:yo\j,ng woman.-. God forbid I should *vejr see; her like ;aga;ri,; ..-;.

'? '^Itis whut I^auspectedJ onlyjworse,' said Lorenz. 'There were *tories going about at the tinier that Rosel, the eldest of these Dietrichs, was never sent -away at all, but was kept shut up here after she went raving mad. But no one knew for certain. And of late the Hung was forgotten, ^and the younger 'generation, knew nothing about it. But you see how it is ! The unfortunate, miserable crea ture has been kept here chained like1 a dog, starved, beaten ; her own child, sir ! Her own flesh and blood I : And now that she-devil has killed her.' ? ?? ? ; * / - I turned sick and faint, and must have become suddenly pale, for the blacksmith put out his arm to support me. ' Don't mind me, man. It will pass off in a moment. But, see Met us try— ia there nothing to be done ? Is she quite dead?' :?'??: I put my hand upon her heart, and felt it still beat, though feebly. She was in sensible, but there was a tremulous flut tering of the eyelids now and then, as if she were about to lift them. If we could get some aid, I thought we might still save her* But how was it tq be accom plished? If we remained mucn longer there, our own lives might be endangered by the flood. As we still hesitated, kneel ing by the mattress, she all atonce opened her eyes fully and looked up. Her glance had no madness in it. It wait pathetic, wondering, but not mad. 'Don't be afraid, Bosei/J said -the blacksmith^ bending over her ; ' no one shall hurt you.'' At the same instant a change in the expression of her face made us look round. There, inthedoorway^ stood the Rabenwirthin. Her violent expostula tions, and their own curiosity, had in duced the two men who guarded j her to return with her to the garret ; and there she stood between them, with her hands bound together by ropes, gazing at the miserable creature on the pallet. The girl's lips moved. A brighter light came into her sunken eyes. She was so weak that her voice was the merest whisper ; still, we could hear the words she said. ' Rosel's so tired. Mother, take Rosel.' The old woman made a movement for ward, but the men beside her held her back. ;' Let me go ?'! ' she criedj, in a strangled voice that would have been almost a shriek if she had not violently controlled it, ' Let me go to her !' ' -? [ -r : ' You fieridj do you want to' finish your murdering work?' said Lorenz, placing himself between her and the. pallet. The woman fell on her knees,- and a great con- - vulsion shook her whole body, ending in a storm of sobs, amidst which ' she poured out a stream of broken sen tences. ' I did not mean to kill her !' she cried. 'I have not killed her. You shall not say so. It was only to save my self. She had torn away the ring, arid she sprang upon me from behind, and I struggled with her and struck her down. She was raving 'then—like a wild beast ; the devil possessed her. You don't know what it was to bear that all alone, and tell no one, and keep her from doing the horrible things that— but, oh ! she knows me now. She knows her own name. She has not known me for twelve years. -Think of it 2 And whenever she uttered the word * mother,' she screamed, an* cursed, arid tore. Oh ! let me go to her. You may leave my hands bound, if you like. As true as there is a God in Hea ven, I won't hurt her! Hark! she's crying for me. My own -child, Lorenz! My child, that 1 bore and suckled— not that devil that came and took possession of her.spirit. Rosel! Rosel!' She staggered up on to her feet again ; and the blacksmith, 'without a word, took out his knife and cut the cords round her wrists. :. . ? ' Mind,' said he, ' if you hurt a hair of her head, I'll fell you like a beast to be slaughtered.' . ; , She took no heed of him or bis words. She was down on the mattress beside her daughter, holding the poor wounded head on her breast. The dying girl smiled and closed her eyes. ...... ? 'Mother, hush Rosel to sleep,' she murmured. The blow which had destroyed her life, had restored her reason ; but it was the reason of a little child. The intervening years of youth and womanhood had been cancelled by the searing fire of madness. '-Rosel! Rosel! where have you been, t my Rosel ? Why has the fiend lef t-you, and the curse been taken away, if it is too late?'*' : ,.i ...??. l - i The wretched woman's own .brain seemed to be giving way tirider^the pres sure of this tragedy. .Her daughter Jay, still and placid in the mother's arms, who i rocked her and crooned ov^er her; as i£ she had been an infant. , ... :;_:;: t ' S'or God's sake,'.' cried I, 'let ais^et them both away if possible.

'We must! get clear of the ruins,' he panted. Scarcely had he uttered the .words before a horrible crack ing was heard. I stopped arid looked bacfc Turbid, foam-crested waves1 weVe1 swirling round the house, and beating against it. The temporary dam of timber had been swept away like so many straws. The ground on which the house stood was being swallowed lip !by the devouring ^waters. ?? Another minute, arid the build- ? ing reeled from roof to basement, toppled slowly t6 one side, and. sank down as if it were engulfed by an earthquake. Ihe moon shone brilliantly, and the voice of the idiot boy was heard chanting! in shrill delight, as the roof-tree of the Raven Inn was whirled past us in the raging £ood.
