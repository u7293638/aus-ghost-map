SOME GHOST STORiS. (From "Success.") 'We have never seen a genuine ghost ourselves, so we cannot add any expe rience of our own to those sent in by our readers. We remember, however, being once the recipient of a spectre visit.- -It- was at a big house-party at New Year's time. We had retired to bed, filled with good cheer and better resolutions, and were comfortably dropping off to sleep when the door opened quietly, and something in white R:r!d-d softly towards us. We were very inutratced at the phenomenon, and our hair stood straight up on end. Unfor tunately, however, for the success of the spectre's visit, he chanced to run his toe against the corner of a tin trunk with such force that he had to hop about the room on one foot and groan with pain. Then our hair lay down flat, and we chuckled softly to ourselves. The spectre somehow seemed to realise that he was a bit of a failure, and after glancing furtively from under his sheet at our recumbent form to see whether we were awake, he took advantage of a long-drawn snore on our part to beat a hasty retreat.
