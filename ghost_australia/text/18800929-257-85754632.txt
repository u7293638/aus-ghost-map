(PUBLISHED DAILY.) FEEI0: TBGO. WEDHESDAY, SEPTEMBES 29, 1880. Reverting to the Education Vote which has been postponed for further consideration, we consider it desirable to say a few -words. On a previous occasion in this paper we expressed the niiininn that aitUouijU doffmaticreiiaion cannot be taught in our schools there is no real reason why the ' common Christianity' which Uiiaules Lilley included in his original scheme should not be inculcated. The clergy of the Episcopal churches were, we believe, the people who objected to the plan, but we really cannot see why in arranging our scheme of State teaching we need take their objections into account. Christian morality might be more largely introduced into the primary course, and tha- would, we inaintaid, do away with any real ground for the com plaint of the ' godlt-ssuuss' of our pre sent system. With church theology we cannot of cour.se meddle, nor is it our business. The colony contains a bedy of ministers quite numerous enough to look- after that. The State is the less bound to consider the objec tions of that portion of the clergy to whom we iiticr, because they have not modilied their hostility to our national system of schools, although we maimed it in order to conciliate them. Of course we hold that the freedom of our Stale system from clerical control is of primary importance. Kather than submit to any arrangement which would enable the clergy to use our schools to assist in the uuiiappy task of penning oil' the children oi Queensland into different theological yards, we would prefer to continue the absolutely secular system of education. As to the question whether our sys fem of education goes too far, we have an equally clear opinion. Last week we endeavored to show that the disin clination to engage in mechauica1 trades noticeable among the young could not justly be attributed to education. Our primary schools should, as far as pos sible, ground their pupils in the main branches of teaching. If they attempt inovp. tlmv will do no -rood. The know ledge acquired at such a school cau be at best but a set of tools placed in the child's hand, with which he or she must in ailer life build up the structure of self -culture. Secondary education is not carried far in the colony as yet. It could certainly be carried too far at the expense of the State. In our opinion the State is only justilied in going a certain distance. Boys who have dis tinguished themselves at the primary schools may fairly bo assisted, as they are now, by tho grant of scholarships to a limited extent. The community gains by the plan in two ways. It gains so much special intelligence cul tured and brought out in the indi viduals selected, and it gains' through- out its whole educational system by the impetus which these prizes afford. But in ko far as the grammar schools assist all children to gain secondary education they go too tar. ,' It does not appear to us that the ;State 'gains , a sum'uient equivalent for the relief afforded to the purses of individual parents. ? But there is; one point in which the application o£ pur j^atc system is der iective.. There are too .many children grming up within reach of school .en^ tirely untaught. We cannot afford this, for, we must put a rote in theJiand ol every youngster, taught or untaught, wlien.JiD reaches a man'sage..1 Thp^Act contains the machinery to a'feinedy-' -.Mij; defect, and) )£ sjioujd; be remedied. ; 'in«,9iJSBj!SL»iiij-: Cop.— Tho eiif o):prj jsjnj- ;, hdst.pf.yie.iljUiltydy JJofeil,, Mr., 'F.',,jlqrf&n;,.' is jgettiug up a sweep 011 the Queensland Clip? tolberuu on November 9.
