[COPYRIGHT.] The Doctor's Step-daughters. CHAPTER II.-(CONTINUED.) BY C. Stafford. The rain was beating also on the win dow of the consulting-room, waking Clinton's dark face turn in that direction for a moment. The doctor, with his hands clasped behind, and swaying from heel to toe, «nd from toe to heel, as ho talked, was standing before Clinton, ob serving, didactically, as he looked up at his friend, "My dear fellow, I own she is a nice child, but she is nothing clsu yet, in spite of her twenty-one yours. Her refusal isn't worth two thonghts. Besides, man, she nas a consumptive tendency. lam by 110 means sum about her chest, and yon want a sickly wife—you've had jronr share of nnrsing wit7i your mother. Look at the matter with a clear bcail. Clinton. She's a nice girl.but she's jot the safest investment possible as a •rife." Whatever sort of head Clinton faced ;lie affair with, be said nothing: he was uot a man. at any time, given to lengthy explanations. He was a tall man, with a deep, pleasant voice, who did not find .00 much space in the small room for his large; easy way of moving. Hehalf let drop and then caught again a stick he carried, made a sign in the direction of the upper part of the house, and asked. " W ill sue be at the Lavingtons' to-night ?" The doctor expressed himself incom petent to give a reliable answer. •• All right." said Clinton, putting his long legs in motion towards the door. " ion won't come np, and—linn—face "<ontr" said the doctor. "'So," said Clinton, shortly, as he carried himself out. "Tsi-ta, llorris; clad you've crossed the Rubicon with her. on your own account. Bad ten minutes e!i?" The doctor pive an indescribable FonnJ in reply, Clinton passed out into the street, and the doctor turned into his own premises again. The rain had stopped, and Clinton crossed the road under the arch of a beantifnl rainbow. He looked up at it, nnd »aw four girls at the window above also looking np at it. His dark eyes instantly singled ont one face in the gronp. As if by some electric influence Tina lowered her eyes at that moment, and met the glance, a flash of regretful meaning in it, managing to make itself understood by her. Clinton raised his hat and passed on. Tina turned rosy red. Frances put her lips close to Tina's car. whispering. " Ton do care for him." Tina shook her head and turned away. " I want a cup of tea —tea, not tannin, yon know; it mustn't stand more than two minutes. I went into the drawing room, but found no one there." It was the doctor who was speaking, coming in Btniling and dapper. Whatever was his anger when he left Tina, there were no sens of it now, as he perched himself on a sealing-wax red milking-stool in the neighbourhood of a stand on which -was cake, ie, and began to help him self. There was apretiylittlescuffleamongst the girlf.-ill wanting to serve him at once. "Light the lamp under the kettle. Where's the teapot? Susan brought np the blue one with the tea ready in it" The doctor sat serene, in the middle of the melee Tina was the only girl who did nothing, though the doctor nodded to her in an exasperatingly friendly manner. The "commotion had raised Jack's 6pirits to such an extent that straight way, if anybody etae's voice was to be heard, it was necessary that Jack should be submitted to the discipline of having a dark cloth thrown over his cage, and Tina occupied herself with this act of public benevolence. "Are you going with me to the Lavingtons' to-night, or have I to carry your excuses ?" nsked the doctor, looking across at her again ""How can T?" she asked, looking sbyly roand, "like this?" Tina's habit of violent crying, when tho world was not going welj, with it 3 subsequent result of change in her ap pp.tr.ince. was well known in the house hold. The doctor looked at her criti cally, but chose to view the case favour nb!_v. and as no emergency w.is ever knnwn in which he did not suggest some thin;, he now said, " Possibly a little rose-water, cold bathing, and judicious powdering might " He did not finish, but raised his eyebrows in good natured, silent questioning as to what sl«.> thought of his recipe. •" I should, perhaps, begin crying vram if I went. There was a chorus of impatient " Oil's ! " from the others. The doctor felt, from something in the air, that he was not. as he put it, " going to have any trouble with the rest; " and.perhaps, in proportion, experienced all the more annoyance with the member of his ' .mily who was neither entertained by, or at present entertaining to, any »dy." Then I will certainly take care yon ire not my fellow-guest," he said, ■sharply, in a tone which brought a reminiscence of the scene downstairs. Tin:i was tired and unnerved. In the hour which bad elapsed between the un eir-'rtoil conversation in which she had heard that Edmund Clinton jircrpotcd to marry her, and that her step-father proposed to marry the one girl in the whole town with whom she was on strained relations (above all things, BO it please you, over some dispute in con. nection with a long-past church bazaar), she had cried bitterly—so bitterly that «!i<? was perfectly exhausted. Frances, who had ten out shopping.had happened to come to Tina's room, and had found her there actively employed in making j herself ill —and a frisbt. Frances, after luring had the whole utorv sobbed out to her. had brought Tina downstairs to iiave her nerves mended by a cup of strong tea. The doctor, unfortunately, lial before the cure was complete, Tina broke down again, clasping her »mall kinds tragically, and tnruing her breaming face towards him, she asked wildly, "What am I to do? " The doctor had, as has been ob wred, a temper somewhere, though it enme surprisingly little to the wirface. It now launched itself before the public for the second time that day. He took bold of the scarlet legs of the milking-stool as he sat on it, (tailing well forward, with his tea-cup, hy its own unaided exertions, maintain ing a not very secure balance at the end ot one knee, while he slowly dropped out these words, with a distinctness which seemed.to add to their semi-brutality : " That is your affair. You. say yon are old enough to decide what yon won't do, therefore jou^nre jp}i- enoagb, languid Irgne,. j k t©/ ,up y<fur ';mmd V it. regard.' to what' .you will' do.

Out of the tail of his eye he saw the four girls he. was not immediately addressing interchange a sort of "Can I believe my ears?" glance, and Frances and the Chinee at once proceed to fold themselves, as -it were, round the irritatingly hysterical person to whom he had spoken. If that gimcrack stool under him conld_ at a thought have been turned into a witch's broomstick, the chimney would certainly have boon in request as an outlet for an injured step-father. Matters at this point, however, were mado a little better by Frances's turning her head round and observing* jn a lond whisper: " We none of us aro liking it: but if you will let us be, wo buiiU all come round. We will all Iry to uo right.'1 " She's not ttying to do right," said tho doctor, not able to dispose of his feeling of having been dealt with unjustly at a moment's notice. " Herbcrtina has shown a miserable amount of lit " "Littleness "was the word his short, peroration had been meant to end with, but Frances startled him from finishing it by a shrill "Givo ovcrl" finishing bar-command by, "and be pleasant." - The doctor was tioklcd—so much so, that he involuntarily obeyed by throw ing his head back with a hearty langh— 1 langh in which his cars told him five iistinct giggles joined. One even from the cause of the disturbance, - who, jwing to the other girls stepping back, was revealed with a rather damp hand lerchief held to her eyes, while tao nouth beneath had a three-cornered imilc of fun. "I say, Chinco," —the doctor chang_cd the subject—" what a smell of paint there is in this room. iTou've been what you call ' Aspiualling * something igain." " It iB only this," rotnrnci that yonng lady, apologetically, exhibiting an ivory white paper-basket, not yet dry from its last coat of Aspinall's enamel. "I uu going to put urose-co'onred silk bag ■n it, with ivory-white and ro-e-colour strings to draw np, and it will be lovely for the bazaar for the new mission- room on Carrington Bridge." Bazaars, unfortunately, were not just tben a safe topic; and, as it occured to the doctor that he might, perhaps, now retire gracefully without the aid of the wisbed-for broomstick, he emptied his tea- cup, looked at his watch, and re marked: "I have to call on another patient before my dinner-party. What do you say to driving with me, Chinee, oldlady?" CnxrTEE llL—Wasted, a. Situation. By tbe time that the doctor started (or the Lavingtons, Tina, in tbe bosom of sacli family as sbe possessed, was commencing operations in connection with advertising for a situation as a gOTCrncss. The girls bad betaken them selves to the drawing-room, by tfais time, and when the doctor looked in there to say, jauntily, that he was " goinp," it struck Frances that he was carrying out her instructions to be pleasant with painful thoroughness. Tina was seated at a quaint in laid writing • table, which, some how, in its severe daintiness of line, seemed to resemble herself. From the garden, after the summer rain, there was positively pouring into the room the fragrance of mignonette, honey suckle, and the strong spiced scent of early-blooming tobacco-plants, which Mr. Hanson, the doctor's yonng assist ant, had " gone in for " in a bed imme diately beneath the open drawing-room window. When the carriage-wheels of the exaspcratingly smiling doctor had trundled up the street ont of hearing, Tina began in a semi-angular hand writing, very much lying on its back, " I'or insertion in The Weekly Chronicle," adding the date of the next appearance of the Tory paper in their country town. She commenced proceedings just as she had done more than once when advertising for a coot or a housemaid to the doctor's household, only in this instance she used a sheet of her very best notcpapcr; that much she felt due to herself. After this, with a beautiful rali'jraphy, the precision of which also offered her some mysterious comfort, she wrote:— WASTED,» SitMtioa v She had got so far when Frances looked over her shonldcr and arrested herhand. Frances always was incorri gible in the way of interfering. "That's not it," said Frances. "I've been looking it up, and I see that's not the newspaper way of wording it They have a heading "SiTt7ATioss Wasted,' and then in the column below' Gover ness requires Situation,' so on, and so on. I've been inspecting the advertising sheet of The Christian World." " That was very good of you, Frances," said Tina, slightly sardonically, rather resenting the excessively prompt and business- like way in which Frances had risen to the occasion on her—Tina's— account "Perhaps if you would think instead of look, you would see that: I couldn't, with strict veracity, advertise myself as a governess until I've been one. Conldl?" Frances had a habit of becoming momentarily deaf, when any remark was made calculated to interrupt the stream, or alter the course of a flow of eloquence which she had atartod. She went on with immovable countenance behind the ostentatiously spread oat ChrUtiaa World. " Here is one.

Frances lowered tho paper so as to sbow a curling fringo of hair, two straight eyebrows, and a pair of flashing eyes looking over at the low-spirited group. "Ah. thero.it is,", she said, "nobody's to blame; but,yon know, we novor had good teaching.

"......■ Tha Chinee was tbo one who took upon herself to answer. :Shc had lier "pig tail " drawn under one arm, and, with the waving unplatted qnart«r:of-a-yard at the end, was gently flogging the top iail of a chair, on which sho was kneel ing with her face towards the. back, "If Mrs. Van Wrexham didn't live next door," she said, pitching high her girlish voice, "I should think, perhaps, she had gone to live at the Rosaries. . (Mrs. Van Wrexbam was a person possessed by a perpetually expressed desire not to hurt anybody's feelings.) "It is the sort of thing the would ray," finished Chinee, "if she wanted an upper narso." ' ' Tina's face, which had brightened, lengthened again. If 3lrs.

The rose garden, Imagination said, would adjoin the grounds of an ancient nunnery, where in the moonlight Tina might wander (still in her white frock), her hands filled with roses, and her eyes upraised to the moon (presumably the little girl bail been put to bed), and meet the ghosts of pale nuns, also in white robes, pacing'with silent trend the ruined aisles' of their old home The honeysuckle, mignonette, and tobacco-plants had been tbe faithful henchmen of Imagination here.' The strong, pleasant scent* had thrown an amount of dreaminess into the air which ' it did tho girls some, credit to hare yielded to bo little. Perhaps the fact that both' Frances and Chineo had slight colds had something to do with their superior behaviour. • j (Ihinee's observation appealed- so keenly to the remaining quarter of Tina't ■ composition that she experienced n most painful revulsion of feeling. " Even if it was really a governess who was wanted at the Rosaries,'' she said, with a new sense of enlightenment upon tho ques tion of herself, *'I should never teach well. I never could teach Chinee when I used to try." " Perhaps that was my fault," Chinee consoled her. i , "No, it wasn't," raid Tina; and Chinoe knew, in her heart, that the answer was jurt. "Do you know, I believe I, could tcacb," broke in Frances, confidentially. *• 'Whatever I do know, I want other peo ple to know; and 1 usually manage to' make them sec things.
