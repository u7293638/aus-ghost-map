Wat Sutitarisi i HL DUNDEE, THE STOBY OF A BOY WHO BELIEVED IN D BEAMS. Shildren, I shall now tell you der shtory of der poy who pelieves in some dreams and signs. His name vhas Hans Dunderwetter, und he iifs mit his folks shust at der foot of a big hill in Shermany. I baf sees dot hill myself, and so I know dot Bhtory vbaspooty true, Vhtll, vhen dis poy vhas aboudt 8 years old he goes oafer to shtay all day mit an old ivomans, und she tells him all aboudt bears fcnd ghosts und dreams und signs. From dot time he vhaB a thpoiled poy. If his fadder Jil'e him to go down cellar ne vhas afraidt of tpocke. If biB mother like him to go oop thtairs he vhas afraidt of bears. I like to say to you right off dot no ghosts vhas eafer known in any country. A ghost vhas a white *heet hanging on der pack of a shair, or aome ' bed-epread left out on der fence in der night. Dere vhas some bears aroundt, but dey doan' come in der house to pite you. In sooch a place like Detroit you may go all oafer und you doan' see one bear—not one. He vhas afraidt to come here. If he does he vhas dead in two minutes. (Jnd so Hans he always psliefs in signs und dreams too. IE he dreams dot he fall do wn a ehteep hill he doan' get ondt of bed until 10 o'clock. If he dreams dot he vhas a fieh, he vhas Bcart und hides in der barn all day. If he sees a crow fly to der north dot vhas a pad sign, und Hans don't shop any wood dot day. It be sees a white cow go along mit a red horse after her, dot vhas a sign ofmoney, und he goes out und walks 10 miles for to look for some pocketbooks in der roadt. He vhas no goot to bis parents, und eferypody else makes fun of him und says he vas soft mit der headt, Vhell, ehildrens, Hans vhas growing oop in a badt way. It der moon vhas oafer hiB left shoulder he doan' hoe out some cabbages °or work mit der potatoes. If der sun goes down oafer his right elbow dot means he shall gp to town und get a letter in der post-office, Between dreams und signB he vhas no goot for \- work, und he goes aboudt in rags like he vhas £ beggar. His fadder lick him more as fife hoonered times, und his mother cry more ash tw o barreie of tears, but it vhas no use. Vhell, all dis goes on until Hans vhas 16 years old. Den one day he sees two liens on der fence, while two crows fly oafer. At der came time somepody shnores in his schleep, u n d der bucket fall down der well. He tcok dot ash some awful sign dot he must go out in der woods und get some bark from a tree dot v has bit mit lightnine, und if he make some tea from dot batk he lif to be 90 years old. Away he goes, und purty queek he meets a wclf, who says :— "Ah !—yum !—how pleased I vhas ! Der wind blows my tail to der left side last night, und dot vhaB a sign dot I eat a poy for supper ! I meet you on top of a hill, and dot vhas a sign two more wolves come oop !" Vhell, shildren, all dot vhas true. Dey find dot poy's bones in der forest, und shust vben dey pick 'em oop a coon runs oop a tree hack end first. Dot vhas a sign dot somebody's horse vhas in danger, and der peoples runs home und find dot Herr Dcnderwetter'u pig white horse vhaB thobed mit an apple. Dot vhas all my shtory. I like you pelief some of him. If you pelief dot anybody who sees ghosts—dot anybody who peliefs in dreamsdot any person who vhas guided by signs vh'aB srft in der head, like pumpkin pie, you hit her ri^ht und needn't be afraid. I can put all dtr ghosts und shpooks in my ear, urd ash for BigDs und dreams you vhas more apt to fall und preak your nose dan to pecomc rich.
