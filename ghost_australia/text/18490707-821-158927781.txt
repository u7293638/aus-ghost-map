SUPREME COURT—CRIMINAL SIDE. _ Monday, 2nd July. ttobert Kichard Torrent was indicted for feloniously as saulting and wounding George Stevenson, on the 12th March, 1849. The indictment contained four counts, vary ing the intent as follows;—to main, to disfigure, to disable, or to inflict a grevious bodily harm. The prisoner, who was defended by Mr Gwynne, pleaded not guilty. He sat by the side of his counsel. The Advocate-General said the indictment was framed under the 1st Vic. cap. 85th, sec. 4, which awarded the penalties of transportation or imprisonment for a period of not more than three years on conviction. There was also a clause in the Statute to which he deemed it his duty to call the attention of the jury. It empowered them to find for a common assault, if the evidence warranted that conclusion, although failing to support the more serious charge. It would be for them (the jury) to ascertain and decide with what intent the wound (which was undoubted in that case) was inflicted—whether with the intent to maim, to dis figure, to disable, or to inflict a grevious bodily harm. He (the Advocate-General) would place the facts before them, leaving the evidence to produce its own effect He was the more particular in abstaining from accompanying the evi dence with any remarks of his own, because he was aware the case had excited considerable attention out of doors, and their minds must have been called to it in one form or other before they came to Court. But he felt bound to tell them, and he had no doubt his Honor would also warn them, that it was their duty to come to the investigation with minds unbiassed by anything they had previously heard, and decide from the evidence after a dispassionate inquiry. He (the Advocate-General) would not say whether the charge was in the precise shape in which he would have preferred it had it gone through his hands in the first instance. Be that as it might, a grand jury had found a true bill, and they were there to inquire into the guilt or innocence of the accused, and his duty was to furnish them with an oppor tunity (and all others who had an equal right) to examine the witnesses whose names were endorsed on the indictment, or were disclosed during the investigation. Of course no opinion of his (the Advocate General's) could influence them.(the jury) ; but if, in the conscientious exercise of their discretion, they found for a common assault only, he would be most happy to concur in the propriety of their verdict. He called George Stevenson, who stated that on the day mentioned in the indictment, he was walking westward in Hindley street with Captain O'Halloran, talking to him on public business. A person whom he (witness) did not at first re cognise came from the pavement and hit him with a stick upon the face. Witness then saw it was Mr Torrens. They were immediately separated, witness believed by Captain. O'Halloran, who look Mr Torrens away. Witness was taken to a chemist's shop close by, and Dr. Woodforde came and dressed his wound. Witness then went home. Was not confined to his house in consequence of the wound. Did not attend business that day, but was not prevented by the wound from doing so. The bill was presented to the Grand Jury a day or two after. The prisoner never threatened witness before the assault, nor did he (witness) hear hitn speak when he committed the assault. Had heard from others that he said something at the time. The witness, perceiving the Advocate.General sit down, said be wished to make a statement to the Court Although the prosecution was conducted by the Crown, according to the indictment, be was the private prosecutor under the Queen; and as he had raised a civil actiou on the subject, which had been determined on the other side of the Court, and bad, besides, received an ample written apology, he did not wish the prosecution to proceed. He perhaps bad not the power to stay proceedings ; but he could declare he did not wish to press them. He was the more anxious to make that statement, as he had been publicly charged with com pounding a felony, than which nothing could be more false, as he could prove. Mr Gwynne said he was taken by surprise, and submitted tnat, on a declaration so unexpected being voluntarily made by the prosecutor, the Crown should not proceed with the case—at least, the charge of felony should be abandoned. His Honor really could not say. That certainly was a most anomalous declaration of tbe prosecutor; but the charge was a serious one. If a felony had been committed, nothing that bad occurred on the other side of the Court could stay the present proceedings. As yet, however, he had not beard sufficient to enable bim to direct the jury. The Advocate-General would not be a party to anything having the appearance of a compromise. He should be sa. tisfied with any verdict the jury might return. Mr Gwynne really did not know, in tbe face of that de claration, how to shape his questions. The matter assumed an unexpected aspect, and seemed really the burlesque of a -prosecution. His Honor—One expression was very material. The psosecutor stated " be was taken to a chemist's shop, and the cut he received was dressed." Witness cross-examined by Mr Gwynne—When he said be was taken to a chemist's shop, he meant somebody ac companied him there. Would not swear that Mr Torrens did not call to bim; but if he did, he (witness) did not bear him. Saw bis legal advisers immediately after the assault. Went to them. Would not give them the trouble to wait upon him. He lived at North Adelaide. Came to town every day. Returned at all hours—sometimes late, some times early. In going home, crossed the Park Land. The assault was committed about noon, in Hindiey- street, nearly opposite the Bank of Australasia. Was struck by a stick once only. Was Editor of the {south Australian Register in the year 1841. The article handed to him was written by bim. His Honor asked if it was intended to put in documents extending over a great space of time. So far as regarded felonious intent, they would cut both ways. Anything cal culated to excite the feelings immediately before the assault would be material. Mr Gwynne bad carefully selected a few newspapers out of a great number published by the witness, so as to save the time of the Court He wished to show provocation. Witness continued—The article of April 17th, 1841, was written by him, as also that of June 5tb, 1841, and all the political articles about Mr Torrens. Ceased to edit the Register about August, 184*2, and bad no connection with the press till July, 1845. The articles in the Mining Jour nal, commenting on the Collector of Customs, were written by bim. He admitted the one dated October 9th, 1847. That headed " Theoretical and Practical Again," dated 29th January, 1848. " Scenes at the Port, by Punch" (March 10th, 1849), and the article headed " Liberty of the Press" (November 25th, 1848), were all his (witness's! writing, He instituted civil proceedings against Mr Torrens for the assault, by bringing an action for damages, he believed, in the Supreme Couit. Mr Smith (who knew more about it than be did) informed bim (witness) that judgment went by default, and that be ( Mr Gwynne) consented to a verdict for £250, including costs. He (witness) hoped to feel the result of the verdict In fact, he had had the benefit of it, except the costs. That action was commenced subsequent to the finding of the indictment, and after the postponement of the criminal trial. W. L. O* Halloran, Esq., Clerk of the Council, stated that he was in company with the last witness on the 12th of March. They were proceeding along Hindiey-street, when, somewhere near Cummings's shop, his (witness's) atten tion was attracted by a person flourishing a stick above bis head. Witness recognised Mr Toirens. He 6&id;, " 1 have an account to settle with you. Sir; X have a score against you for the last seven years." The stick descended in the direction of Mr Stevenson's head or face. Witness used bis best endeavours to separate the pirties ; after which, he requested Mr Torrens to walk away with him, which he did quietly. After they were separated, Mr Torrens said, "This is for entering my drawing-room." Mr Stevenson replied. "I shall make you repent this." Witness walked some distance with Mr Torrens, and then requested him to go home. He look bis horse, and he believed be did so. The stick he had wa6 a common walking-stick. There was no thing remarkable about it. He (witness) thought he should know it again if he saw it. The Advocate-General asked the counsel for the defence if he produced the'stick. He (the Advocate-General) bad given him notice to do so, the only process in his power. Mr Gwynne declined. The Advocate-General had no power to compel it. Mr Gwynne thought it unusual to ask a felon to produce evidence against himself. (A laugh.) Besides, the notice was not proved. The Advocate-General—That will come afterwards. His Honor said he must take the evidence of the wit nesses for the Grown. By Mr Gwynne—He (witness) saw the whole affair. It occurred in the most public place in the province. When gentlemen were offended with their equals, and wished to horsewhip them, they invariably selected a public place. Mr Torrens was "'an Irishman, and his countrymen generally preferred a ghillelah to « horsewhip, when they intended to take tne Uw Into' their own hands. ( A laugh ) The whole affair was such'a one as he (Mr Gwynne) hid described. By His Honor—Meant that Mr Torrens's intention was to insult Mr Srevenson openly. Vaiben Solomon, merchant, stated that he was standing with Mr Parker at hie store-door, on the 12th March, when the prisoner and Captain Bagot came up Hindiey-street. After they had passed bim (witness) a few paces, he Der. ceived the prisoner place'a stick behind his back,and laying bold ot the small end in his right hand, he rushed down the pathway, which was then a steep hill. He muttered something like " I have an account to settle with youbut had scarcely time to utter the words, when he e«me in con ■ tact with Mr Stevenson, and struck him with a stick as thick j as that (producing a bludgeon of formidable dimensions), (t was a polished blackthorn- stick or walking-stick. That (the one produced) was a walking-stick, but he (witness) could knock a bullock down with it. ( A laugh.) He had never seen Mr Torrens with such a stick on any other oc casion. The rush caused him to close with Mr Stevenson, and he could not repeat the blow on his head; hut with his fist, or the stick, he struck him several times in the ribs. Witness drew him (Torrens) away by the collar, and then walked a little distance off; when, in consequence of hear ing some one cry out, "He is coming with the stick again," be picked up a large s:oae, and, standing in the front of Mr Stevenson, told the prisoner that, it tie struck again. he (witness) would knock him down. The prisoner was then led away, and witness saw the blood running down Mr Ste venson's face. He (witness) accompanied him to the chemist's shop, where l)r Woodforde dressed the wound. By Mr Gwynne—Was at Mr Parker's door, at the pillar nearest the Auction Mart, to which Mr Stevenson was still nearer. He (witness) was about as far from them at the time of the assault as from the witness-bos to the Sheriff's seat. Could not see behind him. (A laugh.) The assault took place in the roadway. Stopped to see the blow struck. Wbeu the prisoner and Mr Stevenson closed, he (witness) ran and separated them. Mr Gwynne—You are very fond of the term " prisoner,' Mr Solomou ; pray were you never a prisoner ? Witness—Certainly not. How else shall Idescribe bim(Mr Tortens)? Will yoa find a fitter term? Mr Torrens wbs too much in a passion at first to strike properly. If he (wit ness) bad not been there, and threatened Mr Torrens with the stone, Stevenson might have been a dead man. (A laugh.) Mr Torrens was Collector of Customs at Port Adelaide. He (witness) at one time had a share in the Dorset brig. Did not know, of bis own knowledge, that Mr Torrens bad made any seizures of goods by that vessel- He (witness) was in Sydney at the time. Had beard of it. Had no share in the vessel at the time of the seizures. He had no ill feeling against Mr Torrens, no more than against any other blackguard that would strike a man with a stick. His Honor condemned such language. Witness continued—Had no particular ill feeling against Mr Torrens—certainly none in consequence of his being Collector of Customs. Did not recollect baviog expressed ill feeling to him in conversation wito any one. Could not recollect all he said in casual conversation. Would not swear that he had not expressed such feeling in conversation with Mr John Newman, of the Port. He (witness) ex pected he would have to go to Sydney shortly after the last Criminal Sitting of that Court, but did not make oath ot it. He took no more active part in that prosecution than any "citizen of the worli" should do. He meant a citizen of Adelaide, which was all the same. Could not take any ac tive part beyond asking why the subpoenas were not served. Had be not take an active part in the matter, Mr Stevenson might not have been there that day to tell his tale, as the prisoner was approaching with the stick a second time. As "a citizen of the world," be never had occasion to interfere in any former criminal prosecution. The Collector ot Cus toms was nothing to him. If fie overstepped hi9 duty, be was amenable to the laws, like other people. Never suf fered in the province fiora him or any one else. Had given evidence before the Grand Jury, and the particulars to the Advocate's clerk. Had also employed counsel to watch the case. Had conversations with Mr Parker—could not siy how many on the subject of that prosecution. Pro bably every one had conversed about it more or less, as it excited great public interest. Hid not feed counsel, but had asked Mr Hanson to watch the case. If that was an offence, he had to answer for it. Mr Gwynne wanted direct answers—not impertinent comments. Witness really could not see where the impertinence cf his remarks lay. The slick with which the assau>t was committed was a more formidable weapon than the one pro duced. He (witness) did not use such a stick, and shou d not. except to drive a man before him. Mr Torrens gene rally carried a cane .or a whip. He (witness) thought he should know the stick if he saw it. He was not excited in the affray at all. He did not perceive the stick thrown away as be separated the parties. He afterwards saw Mr Torrens pick it up, and he (witness) then held up a stone to intimidate him. He (witness) had no compunction for swearing that the stick produced was similar to the one the assault waa committed with. The 6tick produced was thicker at tne small end, and smaller at the thick end, than the one used by Mr Torrens on that occaeiou. Did not feel the weight of it. (A laugh.) Mr Gwynne—Pray, where did you get the stick pro duced ? Witness did not tbink it necessary to state where he got everything. Mr Gwynne—Certainly not; that might involve very awkward revelations. (A laugh.) But I must still ask you where you got the stick. Witness—Bought it at Platts'sshop within three months Bought it about three weeks ago, and brought it to show the jury the sort of stick the assault was committed with. Mr Gwynne—Do you think that you are giving your evi dence respectfully to the Court, or as a respectable man, when you know that you bought the stick within three weeks, and yet you say within three months ? Now, I must ask yon were you never a prisoner of the Crown in New South Wales ? Witness—Never; I hope you don't mean so to iosinuate. Mr Gwynne was so instructed Witness—Then you have been wrongly instructed. Robert Parker, wine and spirit merchant, recollected the 12th of March, and was present with the last witness when Captain Bagot and Mr Torrens approached on the footpath. Mr Stevenson and Captain O'Hailoran were proceeding ; along the middle of the street towards Morphett-street. Mr Torrens said " he bad a little business to settle in town to day." He had a sticx in his hand, which be rurned upside down, made a run to Mr Stevenson, and struck bim in the middle ot the street The stick fell six or eicbt yards back, but witness could not say whether or no; Mr Torrens threw it down. They were (hen parted, and Captain O'Haliorari and Mr Stevenson went on the footpath. Mr Torrens took up his hat and stick, and walked towards Mr Stevenson, who was then nearer Coppin's than beiore. Mr Solomon picked up a stone, and threatened to knock Mr TorreDS down if he used the stick again. Captain O'Hailoran then walked away with Mr Torrens When witness first saw Mr Torrens, he looked wild about the eye;. (A laugh.) He seemed highly excited. The whole affair occupied about five minutes. He (witness) did not observe a person of the name of Chalk present at the assault. The stick was a po lished taper walkicg-siick. He (witness) carried a larger one, and believed be had seen Mr Toirens with the stick at the Port. It was not of an out- of-the-w*y size. By Mr Gwynne—Saw Mr Vaiben Solomon with a stone in his hand. He stood between Mr Torrens and Mr Sre venson. Thomas Chalk, butcher, stated he was in Hindley-street on the 12th March, and saw Mr Torrens walking on the footpath with a stick in his hand. He struck Mr Stevenson across the face with it. They closed, and the stick fell to the ground. Mr Solomon and Captain O'Hailoran parted them. Witness perceived blood flowing from Mr Stevenson's face. He picked up his hat and approached Mr Torrens, who immediately took up the stick again and was going to meet him, but Air Solomon interfered, and then Mr Torrens walked one way and Mr Stevenson the other. The affair occupied but a few minutes, and he (witness) could not name the parties attracted by it. When he first saw Mr j Torrens he appeared excited. The stick was a polished stick of medium size, larger at one end than at the other. C. H. Bagot, Esq., M.L.C, recollected the 12th March. On that day he met Mr Torrens at Paxton's shop door, and they walked together towards the Auction Mart. About opposite Mr Cumming's shop, Mr Torrens suddenly broke off the conversation in which they were engaged, and passed behind witness, exclaiming, " I have an account to settle with you, Sir!" Witness looked round and saw him ap proach Mr Stevenson, who was accompanied by Captain O' H alloran, in the middle of the street. Witness perceived Mr Torrens's stick raised above Mr Stevenson's head, but not wishing to be implicated in a street row, he (witnessl passed on and took no farther notice. Did not particularly notice the stick, but thought it was an ordinary walking stick. By Mr Gwynne—He probably used an improper term when he said "screet row," as perhaps they proceeded from different causes. He believed then, and still believed, that it arose from a series of very irritating articles written by Mr Stevenson. The affair occurred in a public street, when it was full of people, at mid-day. It was done in the manner usual with gentlemen when one gentleman intended to put an insult on another. John Woodforde, surgeon, stated that he saw Mr Ste venson on the 12th of March. He was bleeding from a slight wound on his nose, which he (witness) dressed. It could not possibly prevent Mr Stevenson from attending to his affairs. He (witness) dressed it'three or four times. It was a small contused wound given with a blunt in strument, which was the reason it did not heal more rapidly. The skin was broken, but the wound was very small. It was not in the slightest degree dangerous. A more serious wound could be given with a very small instrument. By Mr Gwynne—Both the cuticle and the cutis were divided. J. F. Bayer, surgeon, stated he was in Lowe's shop on the Hth March, when Mr Stevenson came in, and requested him to dress a slight wound on his nose. Witness was pre paring to do so when Dr. Woodforde, Mr Stevenson's re gular attendant, came into the shop. Witness left the matter to him. It was a very slight cut on the nose, cer tainly not dangerous. William Fooks, clerk to the Advocate-General, proved having served a notice to produce the stick on the prisoner's solicitor, on the 28th June. He (witness) produced a copy of the notice. That was the case for the prosecution. His Honor asked the Advocate-General if he persisted in the serious charge. The Advocate-General had determined to express no opinion. He adduced all the evidence, and would leave the ■ case wholly with his Honor and the jury. His Honor remarked that with the exception of Mr Solo mon, all the witnesses stated the stick was an ordinary walking-stick, and the medical testimony proved that a very slight wound had been inflicted—only such as would carry out the intention of insulting and degrading the person—a very improper thing in itself, but certainly not a felony. The Advocate-General repeated his very cautions deter mination not to express an opinion. His Honor asked. Mr Gwynne if he wished to go to the jury on that charge. The act being one of intent, very strong evidence was required, which in this ■ case was not forthcoming. Mr Gwynne said it was clear that, if the weapon was such as Mr Solomon described, Mr Torrens must have used it most mercifully. His Honor had said so. Both the size of the stick, as proved by the majority of the witnesses, and the extent of the injury, were against the presumption of felonious intent. Mr Gwynne then handed in a number of papers, and the Master of the Court read the several extracts marked, from the prosecutor's long-continued, offensive, and aggravating publications. The first paper put in, of date April 17th, 1841, contained an article headed " The Collector of the Customs." The next paper put in, June 5, 1841, contained an article headed "The Collector of Customs," and being another tirade of abuse of Mr Torrens in the exereise of his official functions. A third paper, the South Australian Gazette of October 9, 1847, (Mr Stevenson having ceased to edit a paper between the years 1842 and 1845), contained an article m which the resumption of his malice agaiust Mr Torrens was apparent. A fourth paper, the South Australian Gazette of the 29th January, 1848, contained another article against Mr Torrens, entitled " Theoretical and Practical." The next paper put in was the South Australian Gazette of the 25lh Nov., 1848, contained an article headed " Liberty of the Press," of which the followiug are extracts:— "But it is not the privilege of the press—it is a total disregard and abuse of that privilege —to prostitute it to a mere vehicle for the circulation ot wilful and deliberate attacks on private character .founded on falsehood or prompted by malice. A newspaper Editor has no right to drag any individual before the public, and to charge him falsely with corruption, or with cheating, or oppression, or mis conduct. which, if true, would have been disgraceful. Still less has he a right to hold up to ridicule or contempt persons who have never obtruded themselves or their affairs on the world. » * * * It is impossible that any man of right feeling can hesitate for a moment in the conviction that such publications are wholly adverse to the interests of society, and require to be restrained. In some recent flagrant cases appeals for the protection of the law have been made, and the opportunity of course seized upon to misrepresent the effort made to punish the slauderer as attempts to 'gag the press.* * * * * To call such conduct a 'discbarge of public duty ' is a most gross prostitution of language; but to bold out a premium iu the shape of money for the promotion of calumny and the protection of the calumniator, to encourage a desperate trade in the destruction of character and of the peace of families, are things unheard of even amongst the very dregs of society in aDy country, and can never—we firmly believe—be successfully accom plished in South Australia. The time has evidently come when this trade of wholesale libelling must be checked. It has long been en dured and despised as the outponriugs or stopid malignity; and in many well known instances allowed to go unpunished by considera tions affecting the personal insignificance of the slanderer. But this is not likely to be the case much longer; and those means of prompt redress which suggest themselves to injured and irritated individuals may work a remedy which a slower aud more expensive process has hitherto failed to procure." The last paper put in was the South Australian Gazette of March 10, 1849, containing the offensive article which had given rise to the assault. It was as follows:— SCENES AT THE PORT.—BY PUNCH. Scene IV.— The Collector's Boom. Landing Waiter.—Mr Cassell has arrived. Collector.—The devil he has ! Here's a go t What's to be done? Landing Waiter.—Tell him you know your duty "theoretically and practically"— Collector.—Yes; no doulit of it; but he will ask for proofs.

Scene doses.] (To be concluded on Thursday.J Mr Gwynne then addressed the jury.—He said he w-ould have followed the example of the learned Advocate so far as regarded the offence laid in the indictment, satisfied that from the evidence their verdict must be that of an acquittal. His Honor—Not a general verdict of acquittal Mr Gwynne wished to put some of the circumstances in their proper light, and prevent the high reputation hitherto preserved by the gentleman he represented from being un deservedly tarnished. The Advocate-General recited the portions of the Act under which the indictment was framed, so that they (the jury) would perceive the case presented a twofold aspect: one for wounding with the intents laid in the information, the other for common assault. There were several witnesses examined, but as Captain O'Halloran was nearest to the principals when the affair occurred, and as his evidence was above all suspicion, he (Mr Gwynne) would take that gentleman's account of the transaction. The par ties met, a blow was struck, the stick fell. The " citizen of the world" armed himself with a stone, and Mr Torrens then repossessed himself of the stick, intending no doubt to protect himself from the amiable cosmopolite who threatened him with the fate of the prophets, and then, as during the trial, evinced such kindly dispositions towards him. (A laugh.) The affair was simply such a street row as always occurs when a gentleman chooses to inflict summary public chastisement on those who have insulted him, or whom he wishes to degrade, and was not a case which came within the meaning of the Act. Then how came sqch a trumpery case to excite so much public attention ? Because the pro secutor's motives were founded in a mercenary love of lucre, and not in a high-principled love of public justice ; and the legal proceedings from the first naturally excited extra ordinary attention. However signally unsuccessful the pro secutor might be in his attempts to asperse the character of Mr Torrens, his evidence proved he was eminently successful in his primary object, a foray on that gentleman's finances, as he admitted he had extracted £250 from Mr Torrens's pocket. His Honor thought it better not to revert to collateral cir cumstances. Mr Gwynne continued—He was bound to admit that a wound sufficient to meet the legal exigencies of the case was inflicted, but it was a very slight one. It was only just, over the threshold of the legal definition, but still it came within the meaning of the Act of Parliament, and the question for them to arrive at was the intent with which the blow was given It was always a difficult matter to judge of the intent, which was generally locked up in the individual's breasl, and the legislature acted wisely in leaving such inquiry and and decision to the jury, whose bias (if any) would oe to the side of mercy. They (the jury), in dealing with that case, would take into their consideration the circumstances and the result, and so approximate to the intention of Mr Tor rens, which was all they could hope to do, as he (Mr Gwynne) verily believed that gentleman had no clearly defined intention at the time. If a man fired a gun, slabbed with a dagger, or prodded with a pitchfork, and the action was accompanied with a threatening statement of intention, the jury would have reasonable guides in forming their de cision. And in that case they were not altogether without such means. The weapon used was an ordinary walking stick. The wound was proved most incontrovertibly to be of the most trivial description. The time it was inflicted broad daylight, and the place where it was done the most crowded thoroughfare in the city. If Mr Torrens intended to commit a felonious assault, he would have tracked the prosecutor to a lonely place on the way to his distant home, and have used a deadly weapon with more serious and cer tain effect. Every circumstance compelled them (the jury) to conclude that no felony was intended. There was a position laid down in the law books, which he (Mr Gwynne) could scarcely understand, namely, that " a man should be held to intend the necessary consequences of his own act; but it was clear that Mr Torrens did not intend to matin, disfigure, disable, or to do a grievous bodily barm, for none of those results were or could be a necessary conse quence of his act. It was usual to tell juries that if they had a doubt tbey should give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt. But in that case the converse would hold, as there could be no doubt the object of Mr Torrens was only to id suit and degtuce—to resent a grossly impertinent violation of rhe privacy of hie home, an indefensible, a detestable in terference with the exercise of his hospitality. He (Mr Gwynne) would admit it was wrong of Mr Torrens to take the law into his own hands. But there were classes of men who would ever under similar provocation do the same thing. Indeed, there wtte few who would act with such forbearance as Mr Torrens exercised. The grossest aggra vation was systematically persisted in for a series of years, and the cnly perceptible cessation of the persecution was accounted tor by the fact that for that period the prosecutor ceased to have the means of offence at his command. And tbey (the jury) found that, tiom the year 1841, Mr Torrens bore the grossest abuse, the cruellest imputations, and the most unfounded charges with exemplary patience. It was not until his hearth was invaded, his household gods dese crated, his hospitality misrepresented, and his friend, his guest traduced, that he stepped forward to punish the calumniator. The prosecutor might have still continued his bitter comments on Mr Torrens's public conduct. He might have accused him with impunity, of neglecting bis duties, or of being incompetent to perform them, but he carried the aggression too tar when he forced himself into his house and invaded the privacy of his fireside. Some J men, especially Irish men, considered it a sacred duty to avenge an insult offered to u guest whom they honoured with their hospitality—that hospitality, ot which one cf their own eloquenr countrymen said, "it rose, like all their virtues and their failings, warm from the heart " The publication called Punch, although presented with a ludicrous aspect, involved a charge of gro.-s corruption, and was rife with the most virulent imputations. It pourtrayed Mr Torrens as averting the consequences of neglect and incompetency by bribing Mr Cassells, a superior officer of excise, drowning his delinquencies in the bowl, and stopping the inspector's mouth with devilled biscuits or tbe leg of a goose. (A laugh.) The learned gentleman read passages and com mented, en passant. " Suppose I had reported how things really sUud," thus insinuating things were dishonestly con nived at; and tor what? " It you are going to stand goose and beeswing port, I shall not report your incapacity." "The tray was then brought in and the evening was spent in the usual manner." He (Mr Gwynne) opined it was there insinuated that the Inspector and Collector got com fortably drunk together (a laugh), and timber, that they usually did so, an imputation of itself affording sufficient ground for the Excise to remove an officer. Was not that carrying calumny too far? Was not that overstepping all reasonable bounds? Was Mr Torrent- to be bianded as a drunken and incompetent officer ? The atrocity of the lioel might be lorgoit-n here in the ridicule its absurdity must awaken; but people at a distance might take, as men are ever prone to take, the unchaiitable view and the inju rious impression. They (the jury) had seen Mr Torrens followed to his drawing room; where next would the libeilor pursue him ? The boardassailed, would more sacred re cesses be respected ? Himself and guest traduced, was it j not time to vindicate his right to the peaceful possession ot his own housel the enjoyment of his tible 1! the society of his friends 111 Then they (the jury) would perceive that the libel was to be concluded on the I olio wing Thursday. The last appeared on the Saturday, hut on the Monday the as. sault took place, and "Punch" gave up the ghost. (A laugh.) Actions for libel could not be instituted against some characters, and he would read a plan which the private prosecutor in that case proposed to adopt with such people In an article in the Mining Journal, headed " Liberty of the Press," the prosecutor said :—" The time has evident'y come when this trade of wholesale libelling must be checked. It has long been enduredjand despised as the outpourings of stupid malignity, and in many well known instances allowed to go unpunished by considerations affecting the personal insignificance of the slanderer But this is not likely to be the case much longer; and those means of prompt redress which suggest themselves to injured and irritated individuals may work a remedy which a slower and more expensive process has hitherto failed to procure." His(Mr GWynne's) client had been so irritated and injured. For seven years did his libeller go unpunished ; and it was his personal in significance—his personal character—that protected him. " But those means of prompt redress which suggest them selves to injured and irritated individuals have at leug.h worked the remedy " Wiser remarks (said Mr Gwynne) could scarcely be made upon the subject, and the writer could not conscientiously (if he owned such an impulse) blame Mr Torrens tor acting on his advice. They (the jury) had seen that there were strong mitigatory circum stanpea attending the assault; and as the indictment only charged the felony, which was not, and could not be proved, they could return an unqualified verdict ot not guilty, if they pleased. His Honor—Have ycu a case in point? Mr Gwynne—No, your Honor. His Honor summed up as follows:—In this case the in dictment contains four counts. The first count charges Robert Richard Torrens, Esq., that one George Stevenson, upon the face of tbe said George Stevenson, he feloniously unlawfully, and maliciously, did wound with intent to maim. Tbe second count charges a similar assault with intent to disfigure. Tbe third count charges the like with intent to disable; and the fourth count, with intent to do some grievous bodily harm. As tbe terms used in the indictment re quire to be understood clearly. I must request you to bear in mind, that to maim,means :o injure any member so as to render a man less able to defend himself; to disfigure, is to do some external injury which may detract permanently from personal appearance; to disable, is to do that which may permanently disable a man, as opposed to any mere temporary disability ; and to do some grievous bodily harm, is to do something which may be dangerous to vitality. It is not requisite that tbe actual mayhem, or disfigurement, or disability, or griev ous bodily harm, should actually be proved to have been effected, if it is clear tbat tbe intent of the party indicted was to maim, or to disable, or to disfigure, or to do some grievous bodily barm ; but as it is difficult, in the absence of any direct expression of the accused, to gather the inten tion to maim or to disfigure, or to disable, unless from the fact of tbe actual and permanent mayhem, or disfigurement, or disability, I think it right to direct you, that I do not conceive there is sufficient evidence to find for the Crown on tbe three first counts. To tbe last, which is the most general count. 1 snail now addreES mysell: and as it is not denied that Mr Stevenson has been wounded, and as the in tention with which th»t wound was inflicted is really the isrue you have to try. I think it necessary to enter into some explanation ot the Act of the 7tb William IV., and 1st Victoria, c, 85, in their connection with crimes such as that i charged in the indictment. At common law, however danger ous a stab, or cut, or wound might be, if death did not ensue, the perpetiator of the violence escaped the conse quences of felony, and was only answerable to tbe penalties incident to a hign misdemeanour. Hence, it frequently hap pened tbat crimes ot the darkest dye escaped their merited punishment, and violence was the result of impunity. As eaily as tbe reign ot Charles the Second, this evil attracted ' the attention of the legislature, and from that era to the • present, various Acts have been framed to meet and punish crime consummated in intent but not in outward act. That there was great wisdom in this extension of the iuw is ad mitted by every reflecting mind, but it is impossible to avoid see ng that, closely allied to the remedy, is a concomitant and almost in superable difficulty. Man's outward acts appeal to the senses, and the definition and classification of such acts is a matter comparatively easy. But when we reverse the process, and have to fix the nature of the outward act by intents, which are for the most part hidden from all but the Creator, we have need of a patient vigilance and caution to escape from ertor. Not that there is much doubt when the outward act approaches closely to the confines of recog nised crime—us when deadly weapons are used, or deadly intentions openly expressed, or proof of antecedent design can be bad—these cases come within the scope of the crimes the repression of which is contemplated, and we cannot well err. It is when we approach instances where the more violent passions of our nature are called into existence by some act ot contumely or ridicule hard to bear, and exciting present anger, that the task becomes difficult. Passion is unreasoning—it is, says the Latin maxim, a short madness— where its operations are manifest, we reason unwisely if we impute deliberate design. So conscious does the legislature seem to have been ot this, that it has left at the discretion of the jury to find, under such circumstances, a common assault, where the indictment charges felonious intent. It does not confound misdemeanour with an amount of crime blackening, nay forfeiting character, and involving the loss of a man's rights as a citizen. When ver, therefore, an as sault is ot a class likely to have arisen from such present causes as I have described, I need scarcely say (bat the legislature does not intend you to apply its highest penalty to repress that which fine and im prisonment m y sufficiently meet. If, therefore, you are of opinion that in this cuse the evidence of anything con temporaneous with the assault, likely to have caused a suffi cient degree of present excitement to account for the al leged assault exists, and that there is the absence of any other sufficient motive shown, I think I may safely direct you this is not a case in which you can reasonably infer fe lonious intent; and that, on such a supposition, it will be right that you should find Mr Torrens not guilty of the fe lony, but guilty of a common or aggravated assault. I will add some other testB of the absence of the sta tutable intent, which I think it requisite you should neigh attentively. In the first place, thee, a man's character and position in life, although of no avail if you find the feloni ous intent, must be seriously weighed when the nature of the intent is at issue. Ou a recent trial of an indictment under these Acts (that of Beckeil), I had occasion to direct the jury as I now feel bound to direct you. Established character is the resultof long and continuous action in aright direction ; and, as it is laboriously acquired, so is it not lightly thrown aside. \ man of such character is entitled to reap its result: such a one may be betrayed by the pas sions of our nature into a momentary excess, but he can ne ver justly have ascribed to him deliberate thoughts and in tentions which are the antithesis of his previous existence. As is the tree, so is the fruit. In a lesser degree, but from a principle of a similar nature, we reason of intention from position. A man surrounded by ties which render life es timable, is environed by checks which have but a slight hold over those who, having nothing to lose, have but little to control the darker suggestions of the mind. It is not wise, therefore, to overlook position in life when canvassing intention ; although this does and ought to avail its pos sessor infinitely less than the stronger claims of unble mished reputation. Again, in drawing inferences as to the nature of intent, the method by whtch a man carries into effect the promptings of his anger are of infinite importance to a right conclusion. The Acts of the Imperial Parlia ment on which the present indictment is fcunded afford striking illustrations of this test. Shooting, stabbing, and cutting by dangerous weapous, at once lead the mind to in fer a commensurate intent; but the use of an implement which is meiely customary (a walking-stick for instance), leads to inferences directly the reverse, because commensu rate only with that with which it is connected. This test leads me to notice another, and a stronger. The man who has a deadly intent seldom, if ever, intrudes his act upon a multitude; whereas, a man whose anger piompts him to insult another, seeks publicity as the necessary medium by which he is to attain his object. The very fact, therefore, that the assault complained of took place in the busiest haunts of our city, at a time when it must necessarily at tract. universal attention—when friends were near the pro secutor, and succour and defence at hand—when to carry into effect any felonious object was almost an iraposibility, and to make public an intended insult a certainty—these things seem to rae so clearly to demonstrate the outward act to be inconsistent with a felonious intent, hut tho roughly consistent with an intent to insult and to assault, that I confess I feel surprised such a test of intention should not have occurred to the Grand Jury. The fact that a true bill has been, found under such circumstances is an additional proof of the value of the ordinary examinations before the magistrates, and the intervention of the public prosecutor. Had the the usual depositions been forwarded, I should have felt it my duty to have made to the Grand Jury the observations which I now seek to impiess upon you, and I think it is more than probable that in such an event I should have been spared the pain of directing, and you of deciding on the case, as one involving a charge of fe lonious intent. So strong is my impression on this head, that I shall feel it my duty to recommend that the office of public prosecutor should not in future be filled by any third person, when such preliminary examinations have not pre viously been had, so that this and the no less important check which is derived from the absence of all private inte rests in a public prosecutor, may guarantee that public jus tice shall be unaffected by private motives of any kind. We may add to the tests already adduced, one to which, in Brekeil's case, 1 found it necessary to advert. I allude to the force given to the weapon used : I have already stated, when the intention is clear, the force given to the instru ment is immaterial ; but when the question: of intention is unfixed, the degree of force is a very material ingredient in the data on which we bear our conclusion. From great force we may reasonably infer a deadly, as from the want of force, the common intent. In the present case, if the walk ing-stick mentioned in the evidence was of an ordinary size, the absence of any lethal weapons leads us to conclude the absence of a lethal intent, and if we assume it to be of the size of that produced by Mr Solomon, we arrive at the same point from the absolute necessity in sncb a case of our limiting the force of the blow given. This brings me to consider the question of intention by the new light thrown around it by recent events. Since the last Criminal Sitting an action has been brought to recover damages on the civil side of the Court for the very assault which is here charged as felonious, and damages have been assessed, and a verdict given for £250. Had this fact been anticipated by the Grand Jury, is it possible that they could have given any weight to evidence of a felonious assault from a quarter which had measured and accepted satisfaction for the in jury % To me, this seems improbable. Sitting here to ad minister justice impartially in the case before us, 1 do not tvisb to pre-judge facts which are not immediately at issue, and 1 shall therefore content myself with saying, that such a settlement of a civil injury appears to me anomalous, and utterly inconsistent with the contemporary belief of a fe lonious intent, and we must view the settlement alluded to as demonstrating that calmer feelings have led to the con viction that the idea of felonious intent cannot be sup ported, and that the offence was one which the law allows to be measured, and which might therefore be safely esti mated by the standard of money. Certainly, if I knew of no other fact, I should direct you that, in the face of such a proceeding, to find a felonious intent would be unsafe, if not absolutely unjust. And now let me close the comments I have thought necessary to make, by remarking that, inas much as the acts by which you may infer the existence, or non-existence, of felonious intent, are the true tests by which you must be guided in giving your verdict, it is scarcely necessary to observe to you that the nature and ex tent of the wound is only collaterally of moment. If you fiud a felonious intent, the slightest abrasion of the skin is sufficient to entitle the Crown to a verdict; if there is the absence of intention, the severity of the wound is compara tively unimportant. The jury, after about five minutes' consultation, returned a verdb-t of not guilty on all the counts in the indiotoient, but guiliy of a common assault. Hts Honor—What position are we in now? Do you pray ior judgment, Mr Advoctte? The Advocate-General said he did not usually pray for judgment. It followed in due course, and he only wished the usual course to be followed in that case. Now that the Verdict was given, he might say he fully concuried in it. Mr Gwynse would pray that judgment be deterred. He denied that the Court could pass sentence under the cir cumstances, but was not quite prepared to argue the ques tion then. His Honor would consent to take Mr Torrens's own re cogmz nice to come up for judgment, and also to keep the peace for twelve months. Mr Gwynne hoped his Honor would forego that latter re quisition. In the case of the King v O'Gorman Mahon, the Court required that of the defendant, in consequence of sotne violent expressions be let fall in its presence. His Honor consented to take Mr Torrers'o own recogni uunce to abide judgment. The jury were then discharged, as that case terminated the Criminal Sittings.
