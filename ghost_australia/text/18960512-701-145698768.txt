THE BOERS km THE CYCLIST. About three years ago a wandering cyclist threw a whole district of the Transvaal into a paroxysm of super stitious terror. Travelling by night, bis advent would have been unnoticed if two young Boers, early abroad in search of strayed bullocks, had not seen the ' spoor' or track, of the wneelman. With the curiosity of their race, they followed it for some miles, being anxious to see ' the man wno couiu trundle tue wneelDarrow so far without a rest.' After an hour's tracking one re- 1 marked : ' This fellow must be a thief let us go and tell the landdrost' (magistrate). Accordingly the worthy Dutch ' beak' was brought on the scene, and he was accompanied by a score of armed Boers. The whole party followed the path taken by the J cyclist. Halting at noon, while the horses grazed, the mysterious trail was object of much scrutiny. Suddenly one farmer exclaimed : — Look here. landdrost, if it was a barrow, where is the ' spoor' or the I man who wheeled it ?' ' My goodness !' exclaimed the official, ' I had never thought of that. Let's see — yes, here is the wheel right enough ; but where is the foot print V It is, it must be — yes, yes; ride, boys, ride, it's a spook (ghost) To this day that portion of the road is not traversed by any of the Duch farmers.
