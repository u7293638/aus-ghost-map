BACK CREEK. (Maryborough Advertiser.) In whatever part of the colony we might be writing, we should note down the Back Creek rush as the event of the day. But we should find it difficult to sufficiently cs timate its importance unless living, as we do, immediately within the range of its influence. Our English readers will scarcely credit that the finding a new gold-field would have the effect of depopulating long- established districts, and of drawing to- gether within a few weeks a population es- timated at 30,000. Let them fancy this number of persons located in an area of about nine square miles of rocky sterile looking country. Let them fancy this space covered with an endless number of small-tents, with heaps of earth aud stone, varying in size from small piles to large mounds, and with long irregular streets, closely packed with canvas, wooden, and iron buildings of every conceiveable size and shape, and they will have some idea of the new gold field at Back Creek.. Perhaps in strictness it ought not to be called a new gold field, for digging was carried on in the immediate neighbourhood four years ago. This is not the least extraordinary feature of the Back Creek—two or three thousand people were living on the spot, gold was traced to within a few yards of where the present lead has been carried, and yet the golden treasures remained undiscovered, the rocky casing in which they were enclosed added a few more years to the many ages they slumbered in their now rifled bed. The Cyclopes could not have asked for a better fieldf or their labor than the Back Creek, in some of the claims 30 feet of solid trap rock have to be penetratcd before arriving at the bed rock on which the gold is found; Several thousand claims have already been " bottomed," of which several hundred have proved golden i. e. very rich, perhaps four times as many more "payable," i. e. will return good wages, and the balance barely remunerative to rank " shicers"—the all expressive term which in digging parlance means good for nothing. The ground in a golden claim is not more hedged in and contracted than are the columns of a newspaper, and though the theme is so fertile that pages could be devoted to it, our narrow space warns us to be concise. The Back Creek rush then is fully as large as the largest yet known in the colony, and, considering the short time it has been opened, far larger. Its richness can only be judged by inference; the ab- sence of water, owing to the long drought that has prevailed, has prevented the stuff being washed. As yet only a few experi mental loads have been tried, and the result has been such as to remind the miners of the palmy days of Old Bendigo and Forest Creek. Although every gold field in the colony has contributed a share, the largest portion of the population is undoubtedly from the districts of Maryborough and Dunolly. Our English readers who have friends in business in these places will im- mediately draw a sad picture of the reverses that must attend those who are left behind. But in this they are mistaken—the rush to Back Creek will essentially benefit both Maryborough and Dunolly. There is scarcely a person in business in either of these towns but has branches at Back Creek, and apart from this, when the rush subsides, the population, instead of returning to dis- tant gold fields, will overun the neigh- bouring districts. Back Creek is only distant from Maryborough nine miles, and from Amherst three, and in the first instance drew it support mainly from these towns. Business has now assumed larger dimensions, and wholesale stores and ware- houses are established in numbers, and sup- plies come in from Melbourne and Geelong direct. There are, besides, six banks, three or four theatres, as many hotels, and a number of other businesses too numerous to bear enumerating. The following are statistical returns from different portions of the Maryborough, Dunolly, and Daisy Hill districts. They are not so complete as we could wish, as we were unable to procure the Avoca, Korong returns. We have ap- pended at foot a table of the escorts since the beginning of the year, showing a total of 95,225 ounces, or at the rate of 380,000 ounces a year, equal in value to close on a million and a half sterling. In the shape of export duty, the country derives a revenue of £47,500 on this amount. It must be remembered that the gold from the new field has scarcely yet begun to swell the escorts; the amount above indi- cated was about the ordinary average pre- vious to the rush.

At present the voyage from India to "Canton mvolves a long detour by the Straits of Malacca, the whole of which would bo avoided if a transit could be effected at a spot called t'le Isthmus of lvraw, situated at the southern extremity of the Kingdom of fiiam. According to Siamese official statements there is a navigable rive on this side of that isthmus, separated only by lit miles from another river on the eastern side, which, without falls or rapids, runs through a well inhabited country abounding in rice and cattle, into the Bay of iSiam. Sir John Buwring also has stated that the direct passage across the isthmus is about 50 miles, lm,l that from information furnished liiiu. it would appear that a few iniles of canalisation are alone required to unite these _navigable communications as they now exist. The subject was Brought to the notice of the late (Jovcrnment by Mr Henry Wise, and instructions were forth with given bv ],ord Clarendon, in order that the exaot capabilities of the route should be ascertained.' This examination has been delayed by the illness of Sirliobcrt .Schony berg, (ho British Consul at Sicni; but it is now_ hoped that an early mail will bring detailed intelligence, Meanwhile the Chamber of Commerce at Bombay have ex pressed a strong opinion of tho importance i of the question, and tliclr.desire to promote its success,— ■Times, , Adsiraiux Gold Coisagk.—The Ceylon 05 sirrer, in t peaking of the trade of that place, after stating thitits imports and exports, together with specie, amount to the sum of £5,695,121 in the course of the last year, adds—"Theeffect of tho Order in Couucil making the Australian gold . coinage current in Ceylon, is evident in the large imports from Australia, almost wholly specie." It is gratifying to know that Australian .sovereigns are ringing on tho'Ceyloa counters or amassing in the lanks of that city, but it is not so agreeable to have the impression that they find their way there a3 ao much hard cash for those commodi ties'which we import thence." At present we sup pose this must be the character of oar transactions with the Ceylonese, hut the time may not be very remote when we.shall be able to supply them with wines and dried fruits in return" for those goods which they represent themselves as " exporting to us so extensively." —S. A.: Itfjister. Railway Peogeess.—Last evening, just before sundown, the animating scene was witnessed of some score of carts belonging to the Messrs Bruce .and Co, railway contrac tors, containing all kind of excavating imple ments, baggageof the staff, &c;, wending their , way through the town towards the Belle Vue Hotel, into the yard of which they turned in a true military style. The arrival of these matters may be regarded as prepara tory to an immediate commencement of rail way works at several points in the district of Castlemaine. The contractors are, we are informed, on the road, and that a great im pulse has been communicated to the works at various points' between Sunburyand Tara dale.. It .is. confidently expected that the works will commence here in good earnest, and that between Castlemaine and - Elphin stone their progress will he stimulated to an extent that will give general satisfaction. The carts will'refuru without delay to brin loads of other implements necessary for the prosecution of, the works. . Mr Bruceand staff have taken apartments at the Belle Vue HotcL -Cmtlemame Advertiser.

Howevet, a few nights after wards they were, again disturbed in a simi lar'way, and they were naturally seised •with' alarm, whioh was considerably in-, creased lry the noiso returniug twice ere the light of ; morning had entered their apart ment! They were willing to attribute this disturbance to some natural cause, but after an absence of one night the same sound re turned shortly after midnight, aud it was heard distinctly three times in the course of an hour—on each occasion appearing to arise frotn bsVtyeeri the parties as they lay in bed, and is comparable to nothing but a death gasp, which continues a few seconds, and nothing is heard until the lapse of a quarter of an hour, when a deep groaning sound runs through the room. Another silence follows, but after an interval of perhaps half an hour, it is brokc-n by a loud, shrill shriek, which startles those who had by this time become frightened to a fearful extent. A minister was sent for, and he slept in the house two uights; the second night the noise was heard, but the cause was still a secret. In order that they might be perfectly satisfied that this strange sound was not caused by rats, or any animal of that kind, the floor c.f the room was taken np, and the chimneys were examined, with a view of ascertaining if any member of the feathered tribe had se creted itself in them. Various measures were adopted to discover the means of this mystery, but all proved of 110 avail, and it was determined that on the night of Sun day week last, Mrs should sleep at the house of a friend residing at a village a short distance from Beading. She accordingly I retired to rest in an apartment occupied by J two of hor friends, but, most extraordinary to relate, she, and the two persons who bore her company, were alarmed by the same strange noise in the dead of the nigl't, It, is painful to Ire obliged to record, the fact that Mr v ;,s compelled to take to his bed, and is now constantly attended by Dr C , who has pronounced bis condition to be such that it would be daugero.ua that he should be visited by any of his friends.
