PORT IT-flLLlP HiiRALP. We return all due thanks to the editor of the Herald for the compliments he has bestowed upon us while correcting the errors of his emerald correspondent, and we trust he will do us the justice to cor- rAnt: fin prrnr intn tnhirth ha himcplf line fallen in stating that we have "turned round in favour'' of Dr. Lang. This pa per has certainly ceased for the present to oppose the Doctor, because unlike our predecessor, we belong not to any party. But we gently repel the insinuation that we have undertaken his cause when we merely defended him from what appeared to us unfair treatment. We await (with some impatience) a more extended avow al of fcheir'sentiments on the principal sub jects of legislation from Dr. Lang and the other candidates ere vje decide \vhich ( of them are in our hjumble opinion most eligible. The report that any friends of the Doctor made an offer to purchase this paper, is like the statements contradicted by the" Herald > utterly unfouuded. The observations of a Scottish Highlander up on our article were hot deemed worthy of notice. We are not, like Mr. M'Killop, given to fighting with shadows : the . ghost of an objection glides by us unheeded. Our brother of the Patriot we believe has not carefully read our article upon the Resident-' Judge or he would not have accused us of censuring His Honor for reading over his notes qf the evidence to a witness. What we reprehended was Mr. Were's being permitted familiarly to read them over along with the Judge whilst under an accusation laid against bim by that very Judge, which, if true, rendered him unfit for the society of any gentleman.
