A STRANGER ; IN THE HOUSE. ' Sir, I call attention to the fact that strangors are in the House.' So spake the member for Devon, and forthwith out went all the Mercury host ; arid from that time the speakers of tho Opposition were fairly reported. So strangers are of use in these, deliberative Councils, ' and it, lTlflV nn tlinfc n «f.pnnrrn»»*e minrJ mmr lwii n in giving the truth to the Cornwall Chronicle.

It is tiresome, as every housewife knows, to have choice crockery ruthlessly broken, and pet. delicacies of rare cuisine spoilt' by an unseen spirit power which never tires in its mischief, and wliich defies all controlling bonds. Much, as tho mistresses of haunted houses suffer, it is* as nothing to the ceassless tor juuuiuigs oi. xnc iriiosc in tne iiiurary.

So does Mr John Swan. Mr Jackson has fallen' foul of Queenborough for assert ing his iude'pemlonco, that bigoted little !. borough not seeing the point that a meni: ber is bound to legislate, for the whole .Island, and not only for his own district. Into this; common .error fell the member for West Hobart, and the member for South Hobart. Somehow, some minis terial dust blinded their sight, and both these clear sighted men fuiled to see the far away prospect of a country's ruin. If ever a Ministry should be impeached and ji Governor censured, it is now. With a failing revenue, with an ompty Treasury, with the present interest of the public \- debts only met by the issuing of fresh debentures, it is nothing short of madness to incur , a liability of £32,000 a . year. With the assembling ? of Parliament un constitutionally delayed, on tho eve of a general election, a contract is furtively signed which binds tho country to a hard obligation and leaves the contractors free. The member for Fingal ably elucidated this point in his really good speech. Common justice required that the Government should have received the assent of the now Parliament before they suffered a ^work to bo contracted which was never really sanctioned. In the eyes of reasonable men thero is no truth in tho Treasurer's constant cry, that a formor Parliament ordored the railway. They affirm that this schome was only carried through the House by two unconstitutional votes. Two Govern ment placemen constituted the majority by which tho bill was carried, and they maintain that a fair proof of the worth of railways was within reach. Tho Do loraino lino of railway was an . cxam^ pie, and .afforded a fair proof 'that tho statistics given by railway madmen, were absolutely unreliable. , It remains yet to bo seen what is tho . contract, the real treaty between the Government.or some members of tho Government and tho contractors, for it is self evident that there is a,, contract within. a; contract, a wheel within a wheel.

There Mr Let-to always straightforward and zea lous. There the- clever -lawyer, with his sareas.tic power of '' rebuke, at tacking like an onslaught of cavalry. ' There the Chairman of Committees, who, old member though ho be, must bo wary of tho soft blandishments of the wily occupants of the Treasury benches. There, the new member for Franklin, ever with lance on rest for a tilt at 'the Minister of Lands and Works— 'Aut, Ccesar, axit Nullus,'' his motto, to the latter part of which he will probably ' abide. There the Treasurer, ever nettled by every disparaging word, conscious of the; censure which ho should have, ho is always defiantly prepared to3 meet it, reminding old fashioned folks of the Dutch clock automaton. There tho Minister of Lands and Works, of kindly purposo and good tempered manner,3retponderousasan elephant in his official explanations, and interminable in word power. ? ; There the Attorney-General, ever satis fied with the country which could produce a William Giblin.
