Malakoff Company, Stieglitz — The tributotB crushed 95 hours during the past fortnight; not much stone is being raised, the contractors for putting in the No. 6 level having thrown it up, and the tributors having to do the work themselves.

Tue Helmsdale Company's claim is said to have yielded about 7 oz last week, but the exact return has not been fur nished us, The Royal Saxon Company's men broke into washdirt last week, and were able to pick out a few pieces of coarse gold from the gravel that they got out. The Defiance Company's men completed their surface improvements last week, and are now busily employed in getting out waBhdirt and puddling it. The Great Victoria Company's claim yielded 12 02 17 dwt 7 gr of gold from the dirt got out of the main drives, and washed off during the fortnight ending the 20th inst.

The Prince of Wales Company's men made great progreiB with the main level last week, and expect to ba blocking out ere long. With the exception of the shallow and intermediate ground, the rest of the flat is quite in atqtu quo, and the locality would be in higher repute if it was in the hands of bona fide companies of prac tical miners. The population io the neighboring gullies is about as usual, and even the nuggets lately got at Breakneck have not created even the ghost of' a rush, Raglan—The gullies on this side of the Beaufort ranges, once so busy with the hum of the Fiery Creek rush, are now principally occupied by Chinese, many of whom rent their water from a company of Europeans, and get very good returns for a very Bmall outlay. The directors of the Cricket Reserve Company met yesterday and opened tenders for shaft and ma chinery suitable for working the ground. Four tenders were opened, namely, from the Koh-i-Noor Compauy offering the Warrior No. 1 shaft for £800; from the Privateer Company, making an offer at a similar sum; from the New Cosmopolitan Company, offeriog the Warrior No.2 shaft for £200, and from the West Don Company.

By our Melbourne report it will be seen that the Minis ter of Mines recognises the claim of the borough council for surface damage to the reserve. Exchequer Company, Springdallah—There were thirteen applicants for the situation of mining manager, nearly all of whom were known to be good practical men. Mr James Buchanan was ap pointed. During the paBt week only one machine was washed off, the rest of the washdirt not being put through on Saturday, in consequence of the men being busy with the pumps.
