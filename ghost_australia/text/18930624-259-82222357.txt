What Might Have Been. It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you've left undone, Which gives you a bit of heartache At the Getting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flowers you might hare sent, dear, Arc your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you miphl have lifted Out of n brother's way, The bit of beartsome counsel Your were harried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand dear, The gentle and winsome tone That you had no time of thought for With troubles enough of your own. The little act ol kindness, Ho easy out of mind, Those chances to be angels Which every mortal finds They come in night and silence Each child, reproachful wrath When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all to great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives the bit of bcartache At the setting of the sun.
