Cbrismas-Well, depend upon't that if ever a ghost c~,mes rappiu' on a table, it's not the ghost of a teetotaller. It's spirits he wants. I saw the like of what you mane ; but I thought it was the fun of them about the table. Myself-That's my notion. Chrismas-?\ell, stick to it' an' you-' wont't be far asthray. Did you ever hear of anoy spirit-rap?lirn' out what nC liviu' mortal could thul-k of l Myself--No; I could invent as good messages as any .p1irit es'-r beand of. Chrismas-Well, my boy, depend on thi---when a gbhst comes to give a message it'll be one that no livin' mortal could invet. Themr thrue believers in c higuyl'eryisam begin by .;yi' tiat it's ghosts that- make a table move, and then they talk of the nmovin' an' everything about it as spiritismr- Suppose' they said it was gh.osts made the tide come in and go uut-.-they might as wel say that-an' mrovin the ?rean is myre like ghost work thoau movi' a table.
