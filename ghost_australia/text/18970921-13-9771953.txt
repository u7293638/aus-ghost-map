TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1827. It can now be said that the federal or Australian Issue Is fairly before the country. It must necessarily be the most prominent question at the opening general election. All other subjects must be overshadowed by it, for they i are local and temporary, and it is national and for all time. And a whole class of subjects are not only over shadowed, but are set aside, for they are removed from the provincial and are placed in the Federal or national sphere; so that it would be absurd to I waste our time and dissipate our energies and divide our forces by attempt- ing to deal with Hiern. First and foremost stands the tariff issue. If we succeed in creating Aus I tralia, then, so far as the Parliament of Victoria is concerned, the tariff quarrel Is dead and buried. And here, no doubt, we have one of the great advantages of the direct election of the Senate by the people instead of by the local Legislatures, as is the case in America and Switzerland. Had the Senate been chosen by the two local Houses, no doubt prohibitionists and tariff reformers would still have had to contend for victory in the local elections. Here, as in America, it would then depend upon the constitution of the provincial or State Legislatures whether the Senate sided with the one party or the other; but as the people at large are to elect, it is evident that the states Legislatures of to-morrow will have no more to do with the tariff than JIIIVP the municipal councils of to-day. Thus the whole trend of politics is altered In every colony of Australia. The main question which a candidate has to answer is not whether he is a prohibitionist or a heavy duties man or a tariff reformer, but whether he is a federationist. No doubt at any Australian may be legitimately asked to declare his views and intentions. Is he against the creation of Australia because he wishes to maintain and in- tensify the present barbarous border duties, setting one colony to injure and annoy its neighbours as much as possible, or why? It is imperative that such a man should show his hand. In nine cases out of ten it will be found that the anti-Australian is a traitor to the cause, because, like Mr. M'Lean, he sees-or rather he fancies he sees cer- tain paltry shekels of silver weighing in the balance. He is willing to split up and divide this Island continent into quat rolling, bickering, and possibly lighting sections, because he or his neighbours water some half paltry and half-pernicious duly on the daily food of their fellow-creatures. The anti-Australian needs some very close heckling, however, is to his fiscal faith, so that electors may be able to take the measure of the man. But the friend of the Australian cause goes free. He remits the issue to the one proper tribunal for dealing with it, and that is the frep^Parllamonr, freely elected by the manhood suffrage of Australia. And for our parts we remit the tariff issue to that body gladly. It is wcH,", ave say, to have Australia a fiscal whole, enjoying the free internal inter- course which is the secret of American and German prosperity even if that free Intel course be coupled with duties against the outside world. For better this sy stem-if such be the popular de- easier than it is to see this colony seen prohibitive, its neighbour moderately protective, and a thud free to do, while each is trying to worry and to annoy and to stop the development of the other with further and greater dangers gathering on the horizon. It is constantly said that tariff reformers are hypocritically asking for tariff reform and lot federation together Would not the same remarks apply. to any agitation for perfecting," is, in creasing, the semi isol union of A Victoria to day. The fact is that both par ties pushed their light naturally enough so long as Australia la j In dreamland, but now that federation passages from the clouds a solid reality, to be accepted or rejected, circumstances impose upon both parties t t nee The next local fiscal light will be when the first Australian elections come to he contested Uten patriot must hope that the cause which will most promote the happiness and will most secure the progress of Australia will win But not for a moment would we speculate as to the result, of that would, be to imitate footing; and (he all-important 1 isL of the day is to hold setting fiscal parties by the city, and to bring them together to work with a cordial good feeling for a common and a noble object The appeal is to men of all races and all faiths, fiscal and otherwise, to make sure that the new Patti iment will be an absolutely friendly Parliament to Australia, a Parliament which will consider the whole, and will not be intent upon regaining the blotches and ends of the scheme They are asked to forget differences for a time until the national hand has been accomplished those who are annals flour across the main owe this much to the land of their adoption Still more do those who are Australians owe this much to the land of their birth European diplomacy has been slowly justly ing itself therein of peace now actually signed between Greece and Turkey families a whole relics of dismal prophecies The links established in sales iii would not with draw it at is positively asserted until coerced the concert of all the great powers certainly could not be depended upon to coerce them qild tile V> Western powers 1 against Italy and 11 mc" who might imp been permitted to let alone had then been determined were highly unlike h to relish the idea true If the two 1 after st Clements ne acceptors is con i eel the first Is is good at, displayed already Turkey slices to ox Senate the territory south of the Pencils is soon is the Gink Chamber has resigned the lex venue which is to provide interest on the war indemnity loan md to wit lull aw mllicH where the money is paid J.

Bulgaria too, kept (quiescent for a time by the opportune admonitions of Russia and Austria, had been hatching schemes for a coup by which Turkish suzerainty should be shaken off for good. And Bulgaria restless means Servia and Mon- te negro upon tenterhooks. Prince Ferdinand has been summoned to the ill di" Kiosk and treated to remonstrances, supported no doubt by another warn- ing from his powerful neighbours. The situation, in short, has become far less secure than it looked when the threats of the powers with difficulty procured an armistice, and Turkey yields. She obtains much besides the indemnity, for the rectification" of the frontier, which before gave her Immense strategic advantages, now places Greece absolutely at her mercy. But that is the price which the gamblers of Athens pay for their whistle. The statesman who has succeeded, upon the whole, as well as any, by a course of patient negotiation firm, but without bluster-is Lord Salisbury. The official return of the number of factories and hands in Victoria and in New South Wales is sickly reading for our High Tariff friends, and their wrath Is great accordingly. The only explanation at present forthcoming is that the acting Government statist of" Victoria is a bit of a society, and that the states of New South Wales is a bit of a charlatan. The high probability is that both gentlemen are competent officers and honourable men. who have fairly and fully discharged their duty. So very angry do the figures' make the High Tariff.' advocate, the complete an answer are they to the assertion that manufactures are impossible without high duties in Australia, that the temptation is strong to repeat them: Victoria.
