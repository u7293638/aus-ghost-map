DJl. OWENS)'1 LECTURE. Last night Dr. Owens, M.L.A., gave his pro rnised.lecture, entitled the "Phonoinena of Sleep Dreams and Menial" Hallucinations," at the Theatre Royal. Mr. R. Strickland occupied the . chair. 'The attendance .-was rather small- easily accounted for, in consequence, of sufficient pub licity not having been earlier given of the lecturc, arid1 by the-fact, probably, that a favorite actress was taking a benefit at the Lyceum Theatre. Tiie ' lecturer treated the three heads .under which he classified the lecture very cleverly. He prefaced the subject by showing the physical requirements of the. human frame for .sleep, explaining tile ? reason of some persons being able to <io with a less quantity of sleep for the restoration of overpowered 1 nature than others. This portion of the lecture .was illustrated by anecdotes of persons who had ; slept for days, and even weeks, in trances. The subject of dreams-both night and day dreams- ; was next treated, the lecturer explaining, by rea soning, the manner in which .impressions, received during the day were stored iu the cells of the memory, and during the hours of sleep took such exaggerated forms.: In speaking of what are called day dreams, he enumerated, instances where men,.' by a continued habit of meditation or day dream ing, had.produced incipient insanity in their ininds. The portion of the lecture devoted to mental hal lucinations was amusingly treated, by explaining: what may be called the- theory of ghosts^ Which the lecturer elucidated by the fact of dreams so : taking the power, over the mental faculties, that; the dreamer had the illusion physically impressed on his brain.. There were other portions of the j Jecture : treated by Dr. Owens in a very pleasing i and instructive style, our limited space preventing : us from doing' more than alluding to them.. The ! lecture concluded with a-vote of thanks to the lecturer, proposed by Mr. Casey, jI.L.A., arid, seconded by Mr. Weekes, JLL.A. .
