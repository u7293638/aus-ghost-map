Some Modern Ghosts. . GHOST stories are carrent literary fare at Christ- mas time, and if we may judge from the number of them which have lately appeared in the " Lon- don Daily Telegraph" they are more plentiful than the plums in most Christmas puddings. ' The paper referred to opened its columns some short .time ago to ghost stories, and thereafter there was . a supply of the required taleB poured into the editorial sanctum without stint. As samples of . the stories we quote a column of ghostly narra- tives from our contemporary. We leave our ' readers to form their own opinion on the subject. The series of letters is headed " The truth about I ghosts."
