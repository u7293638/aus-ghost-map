ORIGINAL POETRY. WITH NATURE. Oft have I joined the reverent-bending throng That fill our churches with their prayer and song, And heard the solemn service float along ; Yet felt no influence of the Eternal there. The breath I breathed was only common air. Ott hare cathedrals wrapped me in their gloom, With shadowy pillar and with ghost-like tomb, While altarj rolled their chant?, their rich perfume; Yet felt I not the Eternal Presence there. The circling wreaths were still but scented air. In forest valleys I hare dwelt alone A summer's day, where, wildly ovenrrown, The boughs entwine, and moss conceals each stone ; At morn in idle mood I laid me there, At cvo I wandered home with awe-struck air. And I have paeed beside the unbounded sea In Eramesome humour, light and gay and free, Till a deep voice grew audible in me A voice I cannot hear where men repair, Yet grows with lonely sands and salt sea-air. For hour by bour a subtle influence steals, And deepens inward till my spirit feels. In those dim fastnesses it ne'er reveals An all-enfolding Presence wbispcrin? there. And thoughts flow deep that words may not lay bare. ALEXANDER SUTHERLAND.
