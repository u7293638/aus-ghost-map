LAST LINES. ADDED BY PERCY FAIRBANK. TRIED for the murder of Francis Raven, Joseph Rigobert was found Not Guilty, the papers of the assassinated man presenting ample evidence of the deadly animosity felt towards him by his wife. The investigations pursued on the morning when the crime was committed, showed that the murderess, after leaving the stable, had taken the footpath which led to the river. The river was dragged—without result. It remains doubtful to this day whether she died by drowning or not. The one thing certain is —that Alicia Warlock was never seen again. So—beginning in mystery, ending in mystery —the Dream Woman passes from your view. Ghost, demon, or living human creature—say for yourselves which she is. Or, knowing what un fathomed wonders are around you, what un- fathomed wonders are in you, let the wise words of the greatest of all poets be explanation enough : " We are such stuff As dreams are made of, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep." THE END.
