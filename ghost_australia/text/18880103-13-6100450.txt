RANDOM PAPERS. BY QUIVIS. A MIDNIGHT WATCH SERVICE. The temptation to preach on the 31st day of December is almost irresistible, and my readers will doubtless give a sigh of relief when I tell them thus early that this paper is not going to be a sermon. Had I used the precious hours of the past year aright, had I made any measurable mental or moral ad- vance during its course, I daresay I should have been puffed up with spiritual pride, and have addressed Pharisaic reproaches to the foolish virgins who had not trimmed their lamps, nor provided oil to light them. But, seeing that the year that is a dying can only look upon mo reproachfully and say, "Un- profitable servant I" I have grace enough left me to refrain from preaching, and to confess humnly, -Mea culpa, mret mamma culpa. Yea, I can say, in the quaint words of my master, Sir '1 homas Browne -- "Let me be nothing if within the compass of myself I find the bnttle of Lepanto .-pa-ssion against reason, reason against faith, faith against the devil, and my con science ngamst nil There is uuotuer man within me that a angry with me, rebukes, commands, and dastards me " But no one, be he sinner or saint, can see the last day of December without a thought of that mysterious " lorm of thought" called '1 une 1 ho youth just starting in life regards it as illimitable, and CUIIB it " My inheritance holt lordly, wide, nnd fair Unto la my lah seed field, of Timo 1 in heir " The blaet man of the world Bpcaks o£ it, like Swift in one or bia letters to Vanessa, quite disrespectfully, thus -- "What foolish thing is Time, "and how foolish is mau, who would be as augry if it stopped as if it passed A Chelsea prophet, in one of his rapt heroic moods, moralities on it in these words - " T Hat great mysery of Time, were there no other--the illimitable, silent, never resting thing called Tulip, rolhug rushing on swnt, silent, like an ull embracing ocean tide, on which we and nil the universe BWim like exhalations, like apparitions which are, and then ure not-this is for ever very literally a miracle, a thing to strike us dumb, for we have no word to Bpenk about it ' The wicked man hopes that after his bones are dust, his Bins will be buried with him, and there will be no dread assise " N boro tho vast snake otornity lu charmed sleep doth over ho " The cheery essayist Elm can address a dying mon and a dying year in such sportivo mood as this - " Every dead man must take upon himself to b« lecturing me with his odious truiBin, that such as lie now is I niUBt Bbortly be Not so Bbortly. friend, perhaps, as thou imaginest In the meantime I am alive I move about I am worth twenty of thee.

Were not our heads bowed with bitter shame ? did not the conscience of each of na say, "Yea, verily I' when the Voice takes up its parable against us thus -"Yen cannot think without sorrow on the year that is gone, when you remember the good resolutions that you made, and how this year 1887 was going to be a year of such blessedness and goodnesB Does it seem to be the same year now that it waa 12 months ago?
