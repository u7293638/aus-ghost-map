ORIGINAL POETRY. IN MEMORY OF SULTAN, For 12 years a faithful dog and Servant. Alack a day! Poor Sultan's dead. No more he'll raise his dear black head— No more at strangers' passing tread He'll wildly howl. No more across the paddocks wide, Heedless of stones, not badly shied, He'll chase the sheep with frantic stride— The naughty dog! No more upon the Sabbath Day With us to church he'll wend his way, And snap at flies while others pray— The wicked dog! No more he'll take superfluous bones, And hide them deep amongst the stones; Alas! he's gone to Davy Jones, His locker. Yes, yes, alas! he is no more, But still, upon a happier shore, He'll bark as ne'er he barked before He died-ed. We'll miss his faithful, honest heart; We'll miss him e'en when Time in part Has healed the first sharp painful smart His death inflicted. The tamarisk now waves o'er his head, And the bamboos rustle near, While with mournful sound that echoes around The curlew flies o'er the new-made mound With moaning cries that drearily soar To the far-off stars that stud Heaven's floor, And the moon sinks low, and the wind sweeps by, Like a bodyless ghost heaving a bodyless sigh. And memory only is left to remind us That "Sult.," like "Old Time," was never behind us; And memory's wraith, with a sly, knowing wink, Makes a note of the fact in indelible ink. DOG ROSE.
