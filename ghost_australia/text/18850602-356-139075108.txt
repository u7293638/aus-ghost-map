A HBAUNITED HOUSE. A remarkable case was heardl on February 21 in Dublin. M?r. WValaron, a solicitor's clerk, sued his next door neighbour, who is a mate in the mer chant service, named KiernP, to recover Â£500 damages for injuries done to his house by, as he alleged, the defendant and hiis family. Kiernan denied the charges, and asserted that W'aldrou's house was haunted, and that the acts complhiocd of were done by spirits or some pereous in the plain tiff's place. Evidence for the plaintiff was to the effect that every night from August, 1884, to January, 1885, his hall door was continually being knocked at and his windows broken by stones, which came from the direction of the defendant's yard. Mrs. Waldron swore that one night she saw one of the panes of glass in the window cut through with a diamond; a white hand was then withdrawn; but on examining the place she could find neither the finger nor any traces of blood. On another occasion tile ser vant, hearing mysterious knockings, fell down with fright, upsetting a pail of water over herself. Mr. Waldron armed himself with a rifle and re volver, and brought a detective into the house, while several policemen watched outside. They, however, could find nothing. Kiernan's family, on being taxed with causing the noises, denied such was the case, and sug gested it was the work of ghosts, and advised the Waldrons to send for a Roman Catholic clergyman to rid the house of its uncanny occupants. A policeman swore that one evening he saw WValdron's servant kick the door with her heels about the time the rapping u-ually commenced. Chief Justice Morris said the affair suggested the performance of 'the Davenport Brothers or Maskelyne and Cooke. It was quite inexplicable from the absence of motive, and remained shrouded in mysterious uncertainty. The jury found for the defendant.
