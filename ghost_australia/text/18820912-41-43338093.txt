' At Lords, on July 17 and 18, a remarkable match was played between Lancashire and Middlesex. The litter got in fin-t on a xplentlid wicket and, with all their crack amateurs in the ranks, it was thought that a batting treat was in store for the fpectators. The first wickets tumlilod very rapidly, however, and it was only through the brilliant dis play of Hon. A. Lyttleton (49) and tha hard liitting of Veraon (33) that the total reached 12«. Ccohh. land got 5 for 51, and Barlow 3 for 9 Lancashire did well from the start, and 243 was the outcome of their innings. Hornby led the way with 131.
