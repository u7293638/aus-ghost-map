A Cool Youth. Made Himself Comfortable. The Braidwood Dispatch says that a gentleman was driving at night to the town along one of the main roads, when he saw approaching a tremendous fifeflv â€” or was it a ghost? At any rate some illumination seemed to be travelling along thecentre of the road, and on coming nearer it suddenly burst into a large sheet of re volving flame. Judge of his astonishment when he saw a lad driving a cart and lying full length in front of a blazing fire, which he had built npon stones in the middle of his dray. Long pieces' of wood were laid upon the stones, and as they burnt down the coals fell through the holes in the bottcm of the cart on to the road. The sheet of revolving flame he bad seen, Mr Allen discovered, was caused by a news paper which had canght fire being drawn round the wheel of the cart. The lad was contentedly smoking his.pipe as though he were comfortably ensconced in an armchair in front of a fire in his home. When asked if he were not afraid of the cart catching fire he replied with the utmost composure that he " didn't care if both the cart and horse canght fire so long as he could keep himself warm." And he really looked as if such a contingency didn't trouble him in the slightest.
