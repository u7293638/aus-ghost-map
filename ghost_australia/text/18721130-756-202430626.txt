' T The following piece of gos'sqv' is' furnished by " the Ballarat Courier. " A young, and blooming 'lady, residing not a Thoosfod- miles from the Bal-, larat Post office has fallcii in lticlds way. She was' at the Melbourne races oh the Cup day, when her personal appearance attracted the uotice of a very wealthy and highly respectable resident of Mel-, bourne. The latter spyght and obtained an intro duction to her, and was so pleased with the interview I that a marriage may be looked upon as almost un fait accompli. The gentleman's income is said to exceed £10,000 per annum, and he has already shown the strength of his entanglement by making the object of his affections a present which is said to_be equivalent in value to several. hundred pounds sterling. Certain local circles' are; iu quite a pleasurable state of excitment over this interesting incident." The Bendigo Advertiser chronicled as follows : — A mad Chinaman, 011 the first outbreak of his malady, very often shows a desire to bite men's ears off, to tear people's eyes out, and to disfigure generally the human countenance.. Such a Tartar was brought before the city court on Monday, and consigned to the Yarra Bend Asylum where they know how to deal with this sort of lunatic; He was conveyed to the railway station tied up in a blanket, at mid-day. Constables Dobson and Law rence were sent in charge of him, anil we hope they will neither of them return minus- a feature of their faces."
