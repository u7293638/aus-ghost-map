We have them befqre us,iwith J 1; translations, in a little work ivhich has ..now become very scarce, but which, >ve , r ' believe, was of some use : in its day; The vv Nullity of the Government of Queen Victoria iii' iin Ireland; or, The ' Pope the ' Virtual Ruler of the Land (Dublin, 1839), by the ' ''Rev. Rdbert J. M'Gheri,' A. B.',' minister' of |" Harold's Cross Church, Dublin, -whom V; many still living remember as' one'. 'of the n .most zealous and useful champions of Protestantism forty years ago. It was ' convenient in those days to repudiate the ' "'Bulls altogether, and they were repudiated ' "' accordingly ; the Romish"'prelates' and /' /other doctors examined concerning them ( I, "thought as badly of .them as' any Protes- tant could wish, and declared that ! they, 8 had no authority in Ireland, not having: -ricrbeeh . published ''!' there j which might 1 '"bec'truej iin aHsense; ' but only cso: asrto-i '"'"'enable a man to deceive' by words which ' '" 'yet'iii themselves' ate" capable 'of a sense '''"'in' which7, they are true, — a ', common' (Jesuitical device for making a 'lie or a Cii! perjury "innocent, although' they knew . . . , ' that, at; that very time they were used; for ii -. the training of the Romish priests who were by and by to have all the Romanists' of Ireland under their teaching. But we ":i do not need now to enter into any of the, "' points' which Mr. M'Ghee discussed at' 1 ' length in order to prove thattheRomanists of Ireland are bound by these Bulls ; the Decrees of the Vatican , Council 'have ; 41 settled that for ever ; they' and all; true members of 'the Church of Rome are ' bound by these and all the Bulls of all' the" ' Popes that have ever worn the tiara : u these Bulls must be held by them as of ' ' !, divine authority, asVmuchi as any books of ; . the Holy Scriptures. The Bull to which we shall devote our attention is that commonly' called the. " Bulla Gcenee Domini Bulls' are in general- "'cbinmbhly named' by1 their1 first' two or three /words ; but in this vca'sel! the Bull 'takes its name/from the fact of'its'publi- cation on the day. of' tiielfeetiyai'! called . Ccena Domini, the pretended /celebration ; or commemoration , of the'iustitution of the Lord's Supper. This Bull was first: issued ; ( ';"by p6pei(Paul !V; in the year 1610 5 again ; by Urban YIH-' in 1637 agwii' -'l>y! Ole-.- 7 ..Vdiejf!- 'XlV/iii' 'ltll/ 'Vlt is publicly ; read , /, The BulPbegins in the usual form :— 7 . i;v<Vv\u'' Benedictust J8piscopits,f:<".servusi servo- . Js'rum' 'Dei, ad -perpetuam in meniariam " (Benedict, Bishop, servant of the'servants ""of 'God, in order 'that the thing may be , " had'in perpetual' 'remembrance). / ,':I,:Vi'.The pastoral'yigilance and anxiety of ' the Roman Pontiff is, by reason of the .duty of his, office, not only continually employed procuring the utmost peace .and ( " tranquility of the Christian world, but .it alsd 'mbst eminently' shines forth, in, ren faining and preserving the imity land, hp-j '//, tegrity'oj the Catholic faith', without which / it is impossible to please God ; so that the ' .faithful of Christ may hot.vbe. as 'little" children wavering, nor be carried about ; '.: with! every wind of doctrine1 by the crafty i ' ' ! wickedness of men, whereby they lie in ' wait to deceive, but- that: all may come. in the unity- of the faith and the knowledge! ' "'of the' Son rof God1 unto a" perfect! man,- " ' and in the society and communion' of this ' life may neither injure themselves nor offend each other, but "rather 'that, ibeing. joined together in the bond of charity, W, ( : the members of one body, under Ckrist the Head, and His Vicar upon earth, the Roman ' " Pontiff, the successor of St. Peter ; from whom the unity of the whole 'Ohurch pro : ' ceeds, they may be increased iii edification, and thus,, divine grade assisting them,' may so rejoice in the tranquiliityVpf this pre- j . ;sent life, that they. - may.: also, fully enjoy! the; happiness of the next. For 'which reasons, truly, the r Roman Pontiffs our predecessors have been a'ccustomed upon this day, which is the stated anniversary for the commemoration of our Lord's Supper, solemnly to exercise the spiritual sword of ecclesiastical discipline and the salutary weapons of ju-tice, by the'minis- try of the Supreme Apostolate, for the g%Vy:'6f"1G;bd.i and 'the''salVation"of souls. We/th'erefote/ to whoitt" nothing is more desireabletban, in the. authority of God', to preseryerinviolable 'the integrity -of the faith, public peace, and- justice, following this ancifent and solemn custom." Here the preamble ceases and the sub stance of the. Bull begins, and, contrary 1 to what might be expected from the pre-" amble, it begins with cursing. But before, we proceed, let us call attention to the words marked by italics in the preamble. Let the reader note how it'-'is'Intiinated that except in the unity and integrity of the Catholic jaith it- is impossible topledse God, and how those of this faith are declared to be the mevt- - bers of one body, not only under Christ the Lord, but under His Vicar upon earth, the Roman Pontiff ; in which we have the complete assertion of the utmost preten sions of the Church of Rome as the sole Church of Christ, and, by necessary implication, the denial of the possibility of salvation to any who are not members-- of that one body "under the Romau Pontiff." But now for the cursing. > The sentence begun in the preamble runs oil, in the first clause of the Bull thus :r-r ' . " We excommunicate and anathema- ' tise 'on' the part 'of God 1 Alinighty, .the 1 Rather, the; Son; and'the Holy Ghost, by ; ,the! authority also/of the' blessed ' Apostles Peter and Paul, and by 'our own authority , I all , .

"Let the reader calmly consider," ; says ! Mr. M'Ghee, " what a mockery ft is to' talk of laws making a:t nation tranquil when'a'setlbf "Popish; ibishops; and priests , are breathing secretly into the ears of one , inass'of the population curses and'execra-. tions against' :thd o'ther, !Tand making; it1 religion to do so." Let us take notice what, excommunica tion-, is! according: to. the, Canon: Law, ' aci1 ' cording to which it is imperative on eery Romanist to. give effect to it to. the- utmost!. of; his ' power; and then We shall see what the effect of the Bull Q(BriwD6mini\vau\di. be if full 'effebt' could5 be given even to this first clause of it., '.Thd,': consequences! of excommunication.are summed up in a line of Latin verse well known to every- Romish priest — ci " Os, ware, vale, communis, mensa negatiir.fi , 'That is, a Rbmanist'is not to- speak to! an excommuhicated petson, to .pray with him ;or 'ldr'him;'!tq salutd him; to hold 'any in tercourse with' him/ to eat or .drink: with'!' .him, or.to.supply him .with fppd/„.; ;The second clause is as follows :— : " Likewise_w.ejBXc6mmunicate and an%/ thematiseT-all, -and, sundry, tlof. whatsoever station;! degree,, or, i condition .they may 1 be '(but the Universities, Colleges; arid Ch'apr: 'tefs,'' by- whatsoever name theymay be 'called, we 'interdict); who appeal from the-' ordinances of us, arid of the Roman Ebni' 't lffs'fdrthe time being, to a future General 1 Council ; as also those', by whose aid ,'or„ favour the appeal shall be made.",; ' ® The third clause excommunicates iand: anathematises ' -pirates, U corsairs;.V&c.;, es pecially 'those ibfesting the'coaBts of the 'Papardbmiriions, and all who'1 ai'cl them; 'the, fourth; those, who plunder 'wrecked' vessels ; ( the . fifth/ jall./Ty ho/ impose new faxes, or .increase; old phes. . without the. fPope's leave ; ithe sixth,, those who forge o'r falsify Apostolic Letters; that Is, i Papal!
