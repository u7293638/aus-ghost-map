A lady of the name of Barratt. alias Iarris, appeared before the Bench to charge a man of the name of Carter, residing at Cowie's Creek, with using towards her obscene and indecent language.

The Slagittate remarked upon. the noncha lance and ease with which the complainant recapitulated the foul language, and considered that a female, who could act in public in this manner, was more likely to hare used such language herself, rather than the individual she - complained of, and consequently distlssed the charge.
