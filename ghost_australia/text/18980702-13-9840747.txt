SATURDAY, JULY 2, 1898. Tears aro not often dropped ou tlic dusty arena or l'arlliinient, anti, ns a nuttier of fact, the British public does not easily forgive Its stalesnieu fur weeping comm publico. There Is a general feeling Hitit weeping is a woman's business rather than a man's, ur that, at all events, it ought to be conducted In private. The spec- tacle of a tearful statesman. Indued, is very apt to tickle tim general sense of humour. Mr. Walpole, who was Home Secretary under Lord Derby, wept In public on a memorable occa- sion ivhen receiving a deputation about Hie brokpn railings In llyde ptirk, and those tears ended bis public career. They furnished ii text for Jests to the wits and caricaturists of Hie three klngduniN. Mr. Walpole died not ti month ago; lie shed those unfortunate tears somewhere In 18(10; foi* more than thirty years, that Is, the ridicule of those inopportune tears pursued their unhappy parent. But sometimes tears can be forgiven evett to masculine eyes and on the most conspicuous stage. Tlio aston- ished world once saw-and saw with | entire approval-the Duke of Welllug ton shedding tears In the House of Lords It was the death of Sir Robert Peel which made those reluctant dtops íoll down the warscarted visage of the lion Duke and the world wel comed the spectacle as pioving that some natural human emotion jet sur viv cd within that giim flguie An equally astonished and an equally ap pioviug vvoild beheld the Maiquls of Salisbury shedding tears in the House of lords a few weeks ago and Sir YA. illlnm Harcourt doing exactly the same thing at almost eNaetly the same moment in the nouse of Com mons lhese two It must be noted nie ibout the most aild and di} eved politicians on the public etngc at the piesent moment ahej nie the veiv last whom anjbodj would suspect of a disposition to shed tears about aux thing least of all befoie a public amil euee nnd lu the piesence of lepoiteis Loul Sallsbuiy is a cjnic and Sir A\ II Ihm Harcourt is a sceptic One is ¡is lils feieat thal called him tht master of Ilouts and jibes and sneeis the othti Is the Dugald Dah-ott} of Eil), lish politics a political min nt anns who would stive an. paitj but be lleves in none "i et lu the "i out indliis toiit steue in the Biltish Pailiiineut on M15 20 vilien the motion foi 11 public fttueial foi Mi Gladstone vins tiuiicd the two statesmen who wtie "ullti of tears weie evnttlj Loul Salisburv and Sir Willi uti li 11 court lu the House of Louis loid Bostbci} told how the last note Ali Gladstone evei wioto with his own baud was one to Lndv Sillsbiuv evpicsslng svmpntlii for a cuiia_,c accident which had befallen hu husband ibis was written loul Itostbeij added at 1 moment whtu "Mi Gladstone wns himself suffeilng such piin that ho could lnrdlj put ptu to paper While tint ston was bting told loid Sills bui-j s eves begin to moisten and bo foi o it was finished the unislmmetl tears nott 1 mining fietli down his Sphinx Hit fite Hint sa}s one who witnessed the sctne was n sttnnfcoli touching spectacle-the sifeht of the rieniler himself with hill whiteulufe townids the grave and shouldeis bowed with ninuv bmdcus xveeplnt, Hie a child at the ston of Mr Gladstones last lind ness It Is such toara that give tht salt to otu public life in England lu the House of Commons at almost the s une moment Sir Y\ illiam Uni court was dellveilug In mellifluous cadenees a statelj eulogium on Vii Gladstone W hen ho betau to speak of Hit peisonal love which subsisted bttween the dead statesman and his colltigues 1 new tone ciept into Sli W ilHtiin s v olee Ile p itised and stumbled Y olee al last forsook bim Hint stiiiugt tin III which sel/es nu audience nt the si0ht ot overmnstei in£ emotion swept thiou-,li the House oC Çpmmous lu a lived and bieath less ¡»/leuce the House watched the speal el sti ngiling to keep back his tenis and to leenptuio lils volee But loi 1111 insl mt theie wns no sound s ive that of falliii" teais Ynd Sli YY illiam IIutoiHts most statt 1} peilods weie less eloquent th in the sound of lils biol en volee and the sight ot the tens that bioke sudden!} I10111 tvis which have luovvn no such «Hange molstuie loi hilf a eenuin Such te ir. no doubt me 'the salt of otu publie lift Hie} ale some thing mole than that one touch of natuie which makes Hie whole woildlln Hie} 110 the svmbols of the strain of «.encrons feellu0 which nins thiough the politics of the em pile and which giovvs with evtii veil On the Continent to-dnv poll tittil divisions me lift-, vi hieb teal asundet all social iel ltlonshlps In the iinmott ii case of Hiitkll v Pltl wltk when Mi Serjeant Un/fu/ Who held n bilef foi Mis Hirdell it mirltdlo Iii Sit it mt Sniiliblii Mi Piekwltl s counsil that it was a lim mpiniii).

The merits of the scholars were not displayed in a dis tribution of prizes and the ordinary school report but by actual demonstrations. The principal Mr T.J. Connor stated that he was opposed tothe prize system and that the pupils received, instead of prizes, certificates showing their proficiency in the various subjects of the school curriculum. He explained that one ofd the aims of the school was to lessen the gap between the school desk and the office desk, and that special attention was given to business methods and short modes of calculations and to making the boys familiar with com ercial documents and transactions. The boys were also prepared for the matric ulation and other examinations. After these explanatory remarks, the programme was proceeded with and by means of black boards and maps the boys gave convincing proof of their proficiency in commercial arithmetic and geography. It appears that the daily newspapers are regularly read in the school. The boys showed, by their answers to questions, that they are well acquainted withthe movements of the American and Spanish fleets, with the inci dents connected with the partition of China, with the Anglo-Egyptian campaign, andgenerally that they are well up in contemporary history. They were well be haved and most earnets in their work. At intervals during the evening, songs were con tributed by young ladies, and Mr Connor gave a couple of amusing readings.
