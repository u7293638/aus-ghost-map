MRI. GLADSTONE'S HOLD OVER TIHE HOUSE. A LONDON correspondent writes that Mr. Gladstone's speech in the Com mons on the opening night anut its reception by all quarters of the new House finally disposed of the futile expectations in certain interested quarters that the Grand Old Man's voice would have lost its magic and its cunning. A few weeks ago a cer tain " society " organ, whose political bellows are believed to be blown by a certain well-known politician, pre dicted that the moment Mr. Glad stone rose in the new House he would find his influence to be like a ghost departed. Never was prediction more wretchedly falsified. There is a temptation to describe each ef Mr. Gladstone's successive great speeches as the greatest he has ever delivered. Such comparisons are futile; what is enough here to note is the abundant proof supplied that Mr. Gladstone's personal hold over the new House will be certainly not less than it was over the old. Perhaps he is even now smiling at certain rumoured defeations: like another actor on a different stage He knows when he pleased he could whistle them back.
