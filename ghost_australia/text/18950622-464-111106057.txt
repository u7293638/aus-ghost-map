BOOKS UP TO DATE. Tho8e who are acquainted with Mr. Curtin's. ' Myths and Folk-lore of Ireland' may be trusted to turn with eagerness to his new book, 'Tales of the Fairies in South- West Munster ' (David Nutt, London, publishers). The fantastic and often: weird legends, not merely of fairies, but of ghosts, which Mr. Curtinhas collected from the lips ofthe peasantry, are an important addition to the fascina ting literature of folk-lore. There are those who tell us that in the struggle and stress of modern life in this machinery-ridden age the old tales and traditions of the people are disappearing with the leisured existence and simplicity of character which enabled them to maintain a brave front through all the previous viBcissitudes of history. Mean while the interest can hardly be said to have died out of the subject when we view in this book such evidence ofthe indomitable vitality in hope and imagination of the human heart. Mr. Curtin in these tales of the fairies has struck a rich vein of old-world gold, and he brings to their interpretation the insight of.]the scholar as well as the sympathy of the artist. . : . : Another book which. should be welcome is ' The Crusades : The Story of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem,' by T. A. Archer and C. L. Kingsford. ('Story of the Nations' Series.) London: T. Fisher Unwin. The subject is the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, the first Crusade which led to its foundation, its extent and physical circumstances, the interesting system of feudal government and law which was established there, the military orders and the other Crusades which came to its aid. It Avas a steady movement, now swelling into great expeditions, now represented by straggling warrior pilgrims, but never entirely iceasing, designed to hold the holy Sepulchre of Christendom, and suc ceeding, by unconscious good strategy, in prevent ing the advance of Mohammedan power. All this is well and entertainingly told by the authors.
