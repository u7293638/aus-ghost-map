I think I w anted to hb like him. }Tis hands were as white as ladv's-wlhite and plump, and dimpled where the joints were. Iis hair was suf; his dress was fine.

Whu:t h1 said I euld'at hoar : !bt she smiled, andn looked bright and ,l'ased. And creeping closer, I heard her sry just this : SOh. you've made me. so happy !" I might have heard more, but I did'nt dare. How eu-!d lihe nmako her happy, oxcept in one wy"'. Tle hI : toll her he loved her, and she was glad. No winder she felt so; no wonder she liked him-so fresh and fair and handsomo -better than me. But wym see, we had beon a great deal to ea:h other, and I did'nt dare to stay. I might have killed him. I ran until I got to the hill top, and then I stopped and looked back, and saw them, . Besv and hini. He was a standing, looking very hard down at her. She was'nt lookinr at him. I should'nt have minded-that half so much. She was a-looking away in that kind ofj fashion that tells you so plain that a girls Sknow that some one's eves were on har the way his were. Handsome and straight and fair;no grime of ore on him, no muck on his gentleman's clothes, or his gentleman's hands. And I-I looked down at myself, and I looked back on him, and I cursed hi . Good Lortl, forgive me I cursed himn. I did'nt know how wicked I was, just then. The last look I took I saw h:,'a, still as handsoime and gay as ever. smiling down on Bessy. At noon that day I did'nt go home to din ner. I was swinging in the bucket at the edgo of the mine when I saw him coming along. "I'1 go down with you, Jeff Dodge," he said. "I'm off to morrow, and this my last look at the mine, I've some thing to tell you, too." "The some news isn't likely to interest; t; Both. Mr. Lyons," I said. " You better go dlown with Jack I)uff." I felt afraid t t t:rust myself with him afraid to lo:k at hmu almost. Ei'd have been iikca ehild in my hands, and Satan was close at my ear. But he, with his groat linen duster over his fin cl!otb-s, and :n old ihinor's hat on, juimlnpt into mny b1ucket'. " Now take me down to my inferno, my good dlemon," he said. "I'm ready." I r~ld enough to understand him. "I'm more like a devil than you gu.:ss," I sail. firc"reo. "Do you think himself an 9'' SW,.. I,,., ar'e -'u angry ?" he aslked., "I h':, neTL'--pt you nut with my .jokes befjri." We wered half way dow-n the mine, nid Satan was in the bucket with us-Satan in the shape of jealously. I elat-ho, d lim with my groat black hands, and tried to fling him over the sie of the ltt:ket. " I send you to HTeaven my angei," I vylled. " It was a bad job for you, coning down here with a devil. I warned you." oie struggled with me, but I was twice his man. ile had, pluck enough, but not my strength. Over he wdnt at at Inst end I with him; hut my oot caught in the chain, and :I swung he:oi dnlwnuwards in the shaft. He owent to the bottmn ; and they felt that something was the matter, and dragged me up, head downwards still, and the blatd was hinrsting out of my ears and nose, andr my foot nearly twisted out of its socket when th'v hauled me out. But 1 had'nt lost myself ,nough to forget that Mr- Lyons laid at the bottomn of the shaft--:ll that was left of him. They earried me home to the widow's shanty, and T prayed all the way to is. The fooling that I was a ifarder r was worse than all I'd felt before. I'd have given up Blessy to Mfr. Lyons in a moment, if that could only have brought him to life agoain. Given up Why, she was given up for ever now. All the blhack 'd ever had:l upin my hands and lm clothes was nothing to the black brand of murder upon my so:l. And when she came crying to my side. and put her dear little ha:rls upon me, I pushed her off. "Don't touch me. girl 1" I sa:d. " Y :u don't know what I've done. You don't kn w what I am. You drove me to it; hat I'm not anything better t'r that-no bet ter." '" ,Doe you to what ?'' she asked. Then she said sof'tlv- " Poor bt.y ! it's the rever ?omlling out of head. Poor Jeff: poor Jefl!" It's not the fever," said I. "I'll novor try to hide it. Whore are the mnll ?" SGone bak tol to he mine,"' said she. "There's mother and me only here. Lie down J 4f." The fevor was strong on me, hurning hotter every nom ,nt, but I had oirred to tell the truth. "I'm in my senses, s"y." I said. "?fother Brent. come hero and listen. I've done lh"r a harm--vourr dnghter thr- th.at she don't known of. I'v killed her lover. I thrw him out of the hbucket. and he lies ne:uriv deand at the botton of Ta-n n'r's shaft." " God help us! WhIt noes the poor b y" mean ?" cried the widow. " Tr,, lover! Al;. Bossy it's the way they rave in fever. oH,'s a t;hinking of himself." " r. ~aneaking trnuth-- not ravin," sid.l, i. r threw Mr. Lyons out of the hbucet. FIn went down Tanner's shaft with me. I heerd-'oa talking to cal oth : r,] this morni"g and the devil g;t. into :no. So when ':e ki ;d with me about being one. I elinehod with him. They think it was an accident. I did it-I killed him!1 Oh1 Bess. Bass, you've murdered one man, and sent another to perdition :" , Oh mother!-it is fever, isn't it 2" screamed Bossy. Oh. mother! he'd never do it- never! M[r. Lyons was talking to me this morning at the well. o told me how he was going to be marrierdl; and how. thinking Jeff liked me and I him, if we',: go with him when we were married, to hi.; country place-I for the house work, Jeft for the ground and horses-that it would. be bettor for us. And I knew Jeff would ,think so too, for lh hates thb mines. nIothel he's raving, ain't it--he can't speak t, us. ~ od help is " said the widow. " Wh. don't some one conme ? I daren't leave you I'm afraid it'' truth. And then the world grow blhck, and thought I was- dying ; and I commenced tr. scream. " Ican never meet you in'loea .e Bi I'm a murderer !" And so-went ouPr Going out was what it seemed like-like . a candle in choke damp. " Of course I canie to sone tinie, or ' could'nt hav" writtn ?vthing abhou~l~ I opened my eyes and wondord where I was _-one day. Then I knew I was in the little wIdlor's shanty. hAndl Bess sat down sr'ing near me. and the widow was dropping some 'stuff from n. bottle into a, glass, and at the foot of the bed stood Lyon's ghost. I gave a moan, and covered up- my old head. I heard that murderers were haun!od. and now I knowed it. "Oh, Lord, what am I alive for ?" I asked. "Oh, Lord! Tord:'. Ther. some one said- " He's coming to. Leaveo us alone a nin ute, will you, please ?" And then a hand turned down the quilt. " Jeff. I'm alive, says ho; " don't he frightened. Look at me-touch me. I'm i living man, and no ghost." "'Then vou're not Mr Lo'.ms?" said I, for I threw him down Tanme:'"s sh'aft; and no one could drop that length and h( aught but jelly "No Jeff," saTS ho; "but were not. :te feet from the bottom when youn flung m out.
