He wished the Con ference godspeed, and trusted the ooming year ?would be to tbem a highly successful one. The Hev. J. CoiLINGS (B.C.) congratulated the 1 Conference on their wisdom in having the Rev. J. J. Salmon as its President, and congratu lated the President on hiB position. He . thoroughly believed in Methodist Union, but .there were many problems to solve, and the ^natter, of Church debts was one. He was :filad they had made such successful efforts in i reducing truBt debts. He was looking forward to the tune when the colours would be won for Christ. They were trying to bring all men to . a knowledge of the Gospel, and had long since learned to say, " Grace be with all who love the Lord in sincerity and in truth." (Ap plause.) Mis. NICHOLLS (President of the W.C.T.U.) addressed the meeting. Some charged the Association she represented with trying to start another denomination, but such was not the case. They were composed of members of every branch of the Christian ' Church, and consequently were entirely unsec tarian. Their work was to try to gather in -the outcast, and to do a work the Churches could not do; also, to eduoate publio senti ment against the liquor traffic, and to dis . courage the use of strong drink as a medicine. !They did a work among the ohildren, and that this was woman's sphere must be admitted. Though only a small body eighteen years ago, they now numbered 250,000. She was glad -that the Primitive Methodists recognised the ; right of woman to speak in public, but she . noticed they were not yet admitted into the .Conferences as delegates.. (Laughter.) She . commended the W.C.T.U. to their sympathies, and asked for help in their great work. (Cheers.) Miss GEOBGE (Secretary W.C.T.U.), after congratulatory remarks, stated that about Â£4 15s. per head per annum was spent in strong .drink in this colony. They wanted the sym pathy and help of tbe Churches to fight'the evil. Their great work was amongst the . children, to bring them up to abhor drink and to be good citizens. The Rev. H. J. POPE, in reply to tbe Bible Christian deputation, ,Baid he gave them a hearty weloome and thanked them for their congratulations, and returned their, fraternal greetings. The Primi tive Methodists felt very much as the Bible Christians on the subject of union-they were in favour of union, but did not believe in being swallowed up. There must be mutual conces sions before union could take place. (Hear, hear.) Mr. G. ROBINSON' said that he was pleased that they all had the same idea on union, and trusted it would soon come to pass. The Rev. J. G. WEIGHT briefly replied to the W.C.T.U. deputation. In connection with the Conference gather ings an ordination service was held on Tuesday evening, when tbe Rev. Thomas Allenwas ordained to the full ministry. The Rev. H. J.
