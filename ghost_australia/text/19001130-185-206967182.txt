THE REV. J. A. SOPER’S WELCOME TO SYDNEY. That considerable interest in the com munity is taken in the return of the Rev. J. A. Soper to Sydney (writes the “Aus tralian Christian World”) goes without saying. Mr Soper's ten years successful ministry at. Petersham,, bis .-willing and generous service in connection with every good cause during that'period are-not for-' gotten.. Even the “Catholic Press' an-,- nounced liis return, and remarked that the* Baptists in Sydney ought now to do well 1 . This was evidently the feeling at the truly splendid welcome meeting on Tuesday even ing, 18th inst.. The tea meeting in the Bathurststreet church- School' hall was at tended toy representatives from all the Sydney and suburban Baptist churches, and was to all intents and'-purposes a great denominational- rally. As .was to be ex-- pected, members of the, church ,at - Peter-; sham were -much ins evidence. - ) i. After the tables, had.toeen- filled .over and; over again, the, .public meeting in-; Bath-; urst street church -commenced.; - .Here -the .spirit of expectation: had itaken shape .-in. •the removal of the old -seats in the.gallery, , which waß fitted-with: chairA ;- -Other im provements were also carried- out, and the old- church, with thedecorations and reno vations which- had 'been undertaken, look ed 'as if it had -in every deed l started on a new career. The audience filled the church, and was presided over -by one who, in the, course of his address; acknowledged very heartily -his own spiritual indebtedness l to Mr iScper. Mr ‘William White (who acted for Rev. .W. A. Southwell, the president of the Union, who was in Melbourne), al ways makes a good chairman, and to pre side over such an audience was a very con genial task. The proceedings opened with -the singing Of “All hail the power of Jesu’s name,” after, which Rev. J. Strau ghan offered prayer. ! The secretary (Mr Jones) then- read letters off apology from Yen- Archdeacon Langley, Rev. J. H. ’Mul lens, Dr Fraser (‘Camden College), W. G. Taylor, E. Price, W. Coller, etc.,.all- of whom expressed heartiest good wishes for pastor and people. Mr Jones then gave an outline of what had d-ed up to the' call to Mr Soper, and spoke of the spirit in which the church entered- upon this n'ew stage in it3 history. The church had been •a year without a pastor, .but all the ■agencies of the church -had been well sus tained. Their desire as a church was to give their new pastor a hearty welcome, and to loyally co-operate with him in all the work he wished to undertake. - “For ward" was their watchword. Miss Lucas sang a. solo with great taste and expression. Rev. E. T. Dunstan spoke as a near neighbor, -and said he re joiced most heartily in the settlement made, and predicted a great future to the church. He had frequently said during the vacancy, “Why don't they send for Soper- He is the man for Bathurst street church?-' .There were plenty of people in Sydney to fill all the churches, and the success -of any one church was the success of all. He rejoiced that many churches in Sydney which were -half empty a few years ago were now attended- regularly by large congregations, and he felt sure this would be the case at,, Bathurst street.. “Stand by your minister,” said Mr Dunstan;’“let every man, -woman, and. child be a co pastor. Have confidence in' your future and in God.” (Applause.) . Rev. F. Hibberd, representing the Baptist' Union,- said he well remembered themeet ing at. Petersham, on August 26,1884, when Mr Soper was welcomed to the.pastorate of that church. •We welcome Mr Soper, not only to this church, but to the de nomination. While his church will have his first Attention, we hope he will as be fore always take an active part, 'in the work of the Baptist .Union. . There are. good loyal hearts in Bathurst street church to- day. -and we believe the-church is About lo -rise and take a worthy place amongst (lie .centres, -of.'gpspelv.biessing jn.this. greats 'city.: : As.-a' denomination, kwd.ertenS a; cordial greeting to Mt Soper,' and we! assure him of the joy-it gives us.to see : him once more amongst us. (Oheers.) ' ' : ‘V Rew. Wm. Allen (Congregation-alist) as Mr Soper’s nearest neighbor, and- probably most intimate friend at Petersham, joined with' the previous speakers in heartiest congratulations. As he grew older--the kingdom of God seemed to bulk more largely, and it was a sacred- joy !.to take' part - in -Christian service with , brethren .of other denominations'than his own.' To Mr Soper he would say,‘ -put'-your own church first. The greatest service he be lieved a nianfcould ddihis'-dendminlation-; or the kingdom of Christ was to look well after the congregation oy&riwhich; the Holy Ghost had made -him overseer. To the people toe would 'say;'give' Mr’ Soper room ,to live. ,liis own 1-ife,.- and- to do.. his ,-own work.
