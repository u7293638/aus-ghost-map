Robert Burns. I see amid the fields of Ayr A ploughman, who, in ionl or fair, ^ Sings at his task, Bo olear we know not if it is The laverook's song we hear or bis, No: care to ask. For him tho ploughing of those fields A more ethereal harvest yields Than ehtaveB of grain ; Songs flush with purple bloom the ryo; Ths plover's call, the enrlow's cry, Sing in his brain. Tooohod by his hand, the wayside weed ttaaomos a flower ; the lowlloBt reed BeBide the stream Is olothed with beanty ( (rorBO and praBQ And heather, where his footsteps pass, The brighter seem. He sings of love, whose name iUmncs Tho darkness of low cottage rooms ; He feels the lorcc, The troaoheroua undertow and Btress, Of wayward passions, and no less The keen remorse. At momenta, wrestling with his fnto, His voiee is harsh, bat not with hate; The brash-wood hung Above the tavern door lets fall Its bitter leaf, its drop of sail, Upon his tongue. But Btill the burden of his sons Is love of right, disdain of wrong ; Its master-ohords Arc Manhood, Freedom, Brotherhood ; itd'discoraB hut an interlude Between ths werds. And them to die so younir, and leave Unfinished what ho might achievo ! Yet better sure Is this than wondering up and down ?'?' An old man, in a country town, Infirm and poor. For now he haunts his native land Ab an immortal youth ; his hand Guides evory plough j He Bits besides each ingle-nook ; UiÂ»i voioe ib in eaoh rushing brook, Each castling bough. Bis presence haunts this room to- night, A form of mingled mist and light, From that far coast. Welcome beneath this roof of mine ! Welcome ! this vaoant ohair is thino, Dear guest and ghost 1 Hekbt W. Longfellow.
