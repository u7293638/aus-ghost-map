The Paradoxical Actor. The acto'r's a mighty strange fellow; Saving billiards, all games he'll eschew, For he can't play i a it he will tell you, Unless you will give him his cue. He'sall ranks and all agesby turns, Kinig, beggar, boy, sere yellow leaf; On Monday with love'his heart burns, And next night he's prostrated by grief. He travels o'er countries and oceans, On a stage, from the North to the South; And he never can speakhis own notions Except with a gag inhis mouth. He's superior to all humnanweakness,. He fears not when dark spirits stalk; And the one time he loses his sleekness Is just when the ghost does not walk !
