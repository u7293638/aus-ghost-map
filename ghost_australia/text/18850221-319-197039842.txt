THE ORIGIN OF WIGS. Tbo .patron saint of all wig makers is St. Louis of France, who, says a recent German writer, through tho ingepuity of his mothor, Queen Bianca, of Castillo, wore the first wig that -ever graced the head of mortal manor woman. Tho story goes that when King Loois returned from a crusado to tho Holy Land his mother was shocked at seeing that tho hardships of tho journey, together with the hot <;limato of Pales tine, had robbed hor son of all his hair. But besides-being a dovoted mother, Quoen Bianca was an Ingenious woman, who soon found a way out of hor difficulty. Eaoh knight at court, the color of whose hair had even the slightest resem blance to her son's, was bereft of ono look, which, deftly joined, became an omamontal covoring for her son's bald hoad. Tho honor of bolng made tho patron saint of wig makers ought, therefore, by rights to have been conferred on the mother instead of the sou; but there 1b somo consolation in tbo fact that that ftttoi; a lapso of six centuries Queon Blanca's ghost ansos, point ing out that, iq spito of all sayings to tho con trary, not only in tho ninotoontn century women may bo inventors, but tljat.sven at thS'aawn of the Middlo Ages fc wOmRh founded an industry by which thousands at present earn their daily broRcâ€”JW< Mall Gazette.-
