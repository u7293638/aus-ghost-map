The Ballway Fares. ! ' Agitation has been commenced for a redaction of fares between the Fort and all the stations within the subur- ban area ; and although Mr. Piesse has giren no promise of concession it is rery clear that the fight will continue until a substantial change has been made. - The only way in which rail- ways can be made to pay is by lower- ing the fares until the public are in- duced to travel. In all the colonies j the beginning of railway departments 1 I has been with high prices and deficient returns. Then somebody with busi- ness capacity has come into office and ' has tried low fares, at which the bulk of the community can afford to use tho cars, for which their taxation has paid. The truth is that it does not pay to cater for the few rich, even it prohibi- tive rates. It is not the dress circle in theatres that will make the ghost walk ; the people in the pit, gallery and stalls are really the supporters of thc entertainment. When the be- wildered manager wishes to placate a probable critic he gives him norn for deadheads in the dress circle. Of course, when the grand panjandrum visits the house there may be a show of shoddy aristocracy ; but taking the year round it is the low-priced seats that pay the piper. The same facts apply to railway travel, and if we had a railway man worth bis salt he would lower the rates to sacare revenue. A policy of grab defeats its own purpose by closing out the mass whose cash, at small figures, spells prosperity.
