I THE CRUIKSHANK EXHIBITION. * Oil) George Cruikshank has been old George Craik thank any time during the last thirty years to those whose nursery) days date so far back Indeed, we have heard his illustrations to Grimm's Fairy Stones spoken of as sidelight of their youth by some whose el lldhood was pasted vigilante George, whilst the untiring labour of love which he has devoted to Jack and the Bean Stalk is the thurn bid and tattered darling of many who do not yet aspire to rank in Mr. Pui ch h rising generation n He must be old George Cruikshank k, we fair, in the number of his years as he has long been to the admiring reverence of children, yet our country has seen no better example (t that eveivouthfulncss which is one of the most frequent t and sets di ubtful signs of genius that the name of Cruikshank deserves to be coupled with that epithet has never been dubious to those who, looking I iron d certain mannerisms and limitations in his power as an artist, can appreciate high gifts to move both tears and laughter, exhibited on however small and unpretending n beale, or who can value down light ori(,tnnht), expressing itself in its own manner, irrespective of popular fashion, or who are aware what peculiar skill he has reached as an etcher But when a great turn comes before the world in a modest way of his own, working often in the b) places of art or literature, and addressing himself to illustrate children school with the home!), healthy purpose of only making them laugh at a giant or look frightened at a ghost, people are apt -in this noisy age of sentiment and serious intention to take him at his quiet valuation, and pass by ster The excellence with slight or grudging recognition, as they turn to some loud trumpet blowing hero of the hour Especially may this happen when a man 's work has been spread over half a century, and must be sought for in a hundred stray volumes, or studied in the portfolio of a collector And we are, therefore, glad that a large proportion of the opus George has been put t gether at Exeter Hall in time to let his countrymen make themselves aware of his merits, whilst he is still have to enjoy a reputation which nor of his contemporaries have laboured more conscientious) to inn, or have deserved more thorough By His saltern accusation don'ts Ever) true as ist, from the close relation in which his art stands to his

partially represented here, there are some proofs of how difficult it is to treat coarse manners without lapsing into coarseness and we a e astonished at the general change in our ways which the artist has lived to witness and to perpetuate Art avis in Opposition during the Regency, and the manners of the Court and of the " fashionables and Corinthians at the Cas ilcrLigh and Caroline period

the imaginative artist, and separate his work by the late of his from such issue That dashing about after effect as we see in the wish etchings by Frohlich, lat 1) noticed in this Journal Ki turning to Cruikshank, these large earl) coloured prints look not less foreign to us as pieces of art than as repre citations of reality Will any gentleman undertake to assert, on his honour, that he or his

title Monstroiitifs, appropriately enough given to the full ones current from 1826 to 1828 (73 and 7-1) One of the best of the designs of this period is Cono lands and the plebeians to which the artist has added a most characteristic note In these portraits of the primitive Radicals of 1820 the element of caricature, over-predominant in Cruikshank s first style, is united with a line

we class by far the larger number of the delights of cur and a cry body such ldhood-bcÂ¿in i Ing, perhaps with the famous fair) scenes from Grimm and thence onward, through a vast series of wonders of

the social point of view without taking a distinct bide Hatred of meanness cruelty, and injustice has been throughout the motive principle in his satire, and this has been alone sufficient to render him but a poor political partisan "The Bank note not to be imitated (113) is one of his latest essays in this direction The curious paper covered with grim emblems, and signed by Jack Ketch is a monument of that cruel phase of the law when wretches were hunt, in crowds for the simple passing of a forged note-an occurrence naturally frequent white paper for small amounts was current Well may the honest hearted artist take to himself some pleasure in the belief that his admirably timed satire led to a correction of the abuse The Note not to be uni ted, is rather a curiosity than a work of

power, which Mr Ruskin, in his brief but excellent in action on the artist, justly places on a level with his comic genius lins little plate is scarcely below Rembrandt in force and largeness of style, and it is informed with an earnestness of purpose which the art of Rembrandt never aims | at. In this respect, Cruikshank has a close affinity to Bewick As an example of his range of power it is instructive to compare the gloom and horror of this last refuge of too many a noble animal with the humourous presentment of a somewhat similar idea in the horses out of work, stretching their hand necks to iruicisothe train which passes their stable in the infancy of the railway system Much as we admire that command of tragic power and that earnest simplicity of mind which, though sometimes taking forms perhaps not free from exaggeration or one-sidedness, place Cruikshank decidedly among the very first illustrative designers of the time, yet we must be glad that his pencil and his etching needle have been generally employed to rouse our laughter rather than our seriousness Innocent mirth has never had a patron more effective The "World going to the Great Exhibition-a title which that of 1851 is not likely soon to surrender-a certain series of the " Adventures of Mr Lambkin, the ' Housemaid end her Followers, the Female Jury trying a Breach of Promise of Marrtago,"-these, and a 1 hundred other exquisite pieces of fun (whether wit or humour we leave North Britons to decide) crowd before us, and we feel that we can hardly be too grateful to the skilful hand, simple heart, and given have intelligence which have given us so much healthy and unworldly pleasure there is yet another phase of Cruikshank's art which deserves peculiar attention Every artist is sure to have his speciality), and, perhaps, if it were needful to select Cruikshank's, it would be rather his gift for rendering the fairy supernatural world than even his directly comic or tragic designing Noone has so singularly penetrated into the soul of popular superstition Cruikshank s watches are, so far as we know, absolutely unrivalled They exhibit exactly that mixture of amber and malice, of half wicked, half inexplicable fun-and all with a certain strange dash of superhuman power, not quite devilish, but decidedly not quite canny-which the fairy legends of Grimm or Scott ascribe to them. The illustrations to Grimm and to the Demonology are examples In the latter, the " Witches' \ voyage ' is a perfect master- piece of humour, satire, and supernatural-. It is only through a true gift of imagination that the artist can have reached this success We must venture to think him much superior, in this respect, to Retsch or even here, although we have not space here to do more than indicate the difference between the penetrative insight of Cruikshank and the mechanical agglomerations of horror which Rctsch has substituted for imaginative witchery, or the fantastic exaggerations of a few fine effects which form the staple of Dori s prints from Sue and Dante Nor should the excellence of the landscape features and other accessories, in these and similar etchings of Cruikshank s later period, be over- looked Many little bits of background and sky are 1 undated with wonderful truth and spirit There is an extraordinary unit) of effect in the tone of the Und Ecspe, reached by the simplest means , whilst, in giving a picturesque air to these portions of his subject, he may be again fairly compared to Bowick to this great art st-for to this rule, due consideration given to all sides of his work, we think his claim fully made out we have devoted a fuller space than we can generally spare for a single exhibitor, because its popularity does not appear to us to have been hitherto justly measured out to his deserts We do not mean that Cruikshank has not gained a very considerable share of favour and admiration But this he has marry) received from the young, and those whom we may, without offence, call the half educated classes who do not mean in any way to underrate the value of such suffrages They are given honestly and simply " on the merits, and they are for more valuable than the reputation due to fit puffery and partisanship But George Cruikshank has not, we think, taken milk in ordinary parlance amongst the great artists of the day, and in this respect he deserves a different if not a higher kind of popularity) Many) causes have probably led to his One may be that, in his earlier days, Cruikshank, of the lifelong foe to cant and quicker) and injustice, was in opposition to the dominant classes though not politician strictly, he had more sympathy with Cobben than with Carlton House Another reason may be sought in certain curious mannerisms which run through his designs, and which are probably due to come want in youthful training to act His idea of a young lady is rarely successful, and his drawing of the face has never quite cleared itself of its first dedication to concature A third cause is the fugitive quality of many of the books which he illustrated-a fact to which the catalogue bears curious testimony) Cruikshank, like Flaxman, or Stothnid, or Turner, seems to have worked throughout life with singular modesty, content to take whatever business offered itself, and never inquiring whether he was to illustrate a Torn Jones or a Jack Sheppard Another reason may be that, in later life, his high tragic power has been exercised march) against those abuses by which the poet and the helpless suffer His sympathies are clearly those of a man of the people for the people and this excludes a drawing room popularity Like 1 he was Hood, whom in this respect not less than in humour, he resembles, he has compelled an entrance, but he is not familiarised not " court qualities!, as they say at Vienna He has not condescended merely to amuse us, or to hit us where we do not mind, like his witty contemporaries He has told stern proofs too j lainly and he is here not one of whom the ' engines emma bona dicere, et Inudnrc xc , can be expected Last), satirical and humorous designing lies still, in some degree, under | that Academical censure or depreciation which ltd Horace Walpole to den the name of Painter to Hogarth lime has done justice to the artist of the sake s Progress We do not doubt that he has a like reparation in store for George Cruikshank - snitir</rty Jin mr
