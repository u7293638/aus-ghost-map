LOXG AGO. SI1TzNSO alone by the fireside, Watching the eminbers glow, A vision rises before me Of the happy long ago. I see myself a bilthesomo boy, With heart so light and free, Who told my troubles great and small' ]esido a mnother's knee. And rambling o'er a forest deep, Or in some loney dell, Apart from all the busy whirl Hero's where I longed to dwell. Where I could see the flow're bloom, And tend them day by day, Could hear the birds' weoet melody, And watclh the brooklet play. The scone is changed: A vision drear Is now in memory. I can recall the very spot, E'en to the shady tree. The waters flowing calmly by, And rippling o'er tile stones, And her who sat beside that stream And sang in plaintive tones, Now I drew mnoenear to listen To music soft and low, iBut sad the words which floated As they told of grief and woo. She sang of hopes now blighted, Of joys which might have boon, Of hidden pain and sadness, Ahil mo; a sad, sad scene. At last she rais'd lher drooping head, And breath'd a lonely sigh. Oh, why she moaned I must I now live When hopes and wishes die ? She gaz'd into the watcrs deep With look of grief and fear; Then sank upon the mossy ground, And I drew slowly near. Sudden I start; erect she stood, With hands now rais'd to Heaven, With lookle of dread upon her face, And pleads to be forgiven. And then, oh I may I never hear Again that cry of doom; She sanuk bonoeath the flowing stream Into a lonely tomb. With breathless terror gazoe I now Into the waters deep; But calm they ripple over one Who's closed her eyes in sloop. Her earthly pain forgotten is, All grief and trials o'ur. She has at last a resting-place, Whore naught shall vex her more. And as I maso and wonder . If more I ought to say, A voice now speaks withlin me, "You too must pass away." Now, alone I have been pond'ring Before tile fire's glow, And visions rise before me there, As ghosts of long ago. JULo V leooN ?
