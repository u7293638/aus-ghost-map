CHAPTER V. BORN C SORROW. It iras near morning, -when Alice was startled by & heavy step outside the cottage, and a nervous rap at the door Opening it, the haggard form of Sirs Aspell tottered, and almost fell into her arms Alice was so* thankful for her safe return that she softly wept as she unloosed-with almost motherly care - the poor creatore s clothing and prepared her some warm tea, which she passively swallowed \ stony calm pervaded her whole being, and as Alice per- suade« her to he down, she also yielded to that, so passing several hours, giving no % ent to her suffer- ing but now and then a low moan Ks the day woro along, then slowh waned,and the bannerof flame shot tip in the night from the sall barninç mine, she be- came so violent that Alice was obliged to run for the neighbours and a physician When the latter arrived, and had examined his patient, he closed his Ups tightly together, and answered the girl a question- ing »ye» by saying " I moy eave her life, but her mind I am afraid is a wreck" They sat with her that night and part of the next day, with three strong men most of the time holding her down in her violence Toward night she became a little calmer, and asked u Is the blood in the sky j et - "The light 19 a little fainter to-night,' they answered ** Is it gone yet .*" «he asked a few hours later "Very near," they answered. The glare gradually sank to a dull red, and afresh breeze passed through the heavy atmosphere as the dawn of a happier da} approached, and Mrs \spells little girl was bom A puny, rough-feat tired child, that Had better been born dead, the neighbours thought, but He knew best. They had beeu ^ery kind to Mrs Aspell in her great trouble, these poor neighbors, but there came s time to her that general 1 j comes to all of us after a great affliction-a time when the excitement of the first shock has passed away and we are weanly straggling back to our former selves-a time when the charitable hand grows a little tired of giving, and sympathy finds more piteous cases to lavish its wealth upon-a time that, like the time of death, we must fight through alone Is it to he wondered at, that in her shattered state of mind, Mrs Aspell re- fused the work offered her when she recovered from bar illness, or became jealous of the comparative comfort-alas 1 how poor and struggling that com- fort-of Alice and the twins True, Mice helped her all she could out of her little store, but a poor Manchester factory girl with two children to support I cannot perform many bodily works of mercy, be her heart ever so full of charity I One night Alice awoke sudden!}, and found Mrs Aspell bending over the twins with alook of fiendish hate, while her eyes were blazing with insanity She held a large bread-knife in her hand, and was m the act of sharpening it on the bed-post, when Alice called to her m a voice rendered as calm and quiet as her agitation would permit "Sira. Aspell, what art thee doing B The insane woman turned to \lice, calmed by the quiet voice, and answered as she gave a hollow laugh' " I was a thinking, lass, what nice butcher meat they'd make" Alice lay puzzled for a moment m her great ex- tremity, then asked in a seemmg natural wat " Wut thee please give me a cup of water '-'" ** Ay," returned the woman, and left the room Alice sprang out of bed, latched the door, and breaking the leg from a toy horse that stood near her, drove it into the hold above the latch to keep it from ruing Mrs, Aspell returned with the water, but Alice called out ** Thee needn't mind it, Mrs Aspell I felt cold and had to shut my door " "Thee's afraid,'* the other shouted back, and vio Untly-ahook-the latch without moving it She then threw the cup, water and all, at the door, and began kicking ana hammering at it with all her mad .UtAgtbt * f Alice drew the old fashioned bedstead bj a great evertion ag*un«t the door t ~> «ecurelj harneado it and then getting out of ti L widow as noiselesslj as possible mu round to the door f icing the Ghost Pool" and firmlj fastened it c n ti t outside, h\ draw- ing a bheet through the latch h mdlo and fastening each tnd to the iron staples that fastened back the window «butter» eac.li ^idc of tht loor So intent I was Mr* Aipell to bri. ik into Mice o room that she di 1 not hear nil this nor fceo MICL watching lipr at one of the window« Btcommg e\bnu<*ted with htr mud efforts and finding that HIL door did not gue wa\ "he \ íolentlj dasliLd her he 11 against it and fell back censelo a with the bloo 1 dreaming from her mouth and nostril« Vhce b^ing afraid to go near her ran to the nearest neighbor and brought him to the scene of action She beant dead lass ho «nd as ho raided the poor creature from the tloor and laid her beside her two children who were now «cn-arning in ÍLiror but I d advise thee to make th\ hoame wi soine bodj ehe if thee wants to lue long " The idea that the man put into words had of late brooded a good deil in the girl s mind , but she felt loth to leavo the unfortunate widow to less merciful hands The events of the night however forced her to see that it waa woree than foil j to remain, so she said to herself that she would pack up her poor things ne\t daj and leave Manchester altogether But the ne\t daj found Mr* Appell in full possession of her sen6*", though verj weak begging of Alice to re- main with her if onlj for one week The gentle girl could not bear to inflict pam on anj one, much le^s this broken woman so she remained a week and being importuned again still another and another till Mrs \spell regained her mental facul ties and taking up with some emplo\ment, earned herself and her children a In elihood Alice had grave doubts of her at times and trill meant to leave her when a favorable opportunitj presented itoelf Sooner than she imagined it would this opportunity occurred, and if seemed one that would relieve her of all her trials and give rest to her troubled soul
