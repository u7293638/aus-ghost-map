THE WHITE WOMAN. In some parts of Germany, particularly In Bo hemia, some most extraordinary tales are re pcrted of the 'white woman.' This celebrated ghost is supposed to represent a woman of very modest appearance, excessively tall, and her dress entirely white. She is never seen without a very long veil . reaching nearly to her ankles, and which is of such an impervious nature that no person has ever been able to obtain a glimpse of her features. On one single occasion, how ever, it is reported that she condescended to lift up her veil, when such a blaze of beauty burst upon the astonished beholder that he was actu ally rooted to the spot for a considerable time. The lady never leaves her subterranean or her ' celestial abode but for the charitable- purpose of informing an individual of approaching death. Thus it is very common to say in some parts _pf Germany 'the white woman' has visited him? meaning thereby that all hopes. are vanished of a recovery; and there are not a few in that coun try who pay little or no attention to the declara tion of the physician respecting the immediate dissolution of the patient until it has been ascer tained whether,. the white woman has paid he* foreboding visit. â€” 'Family Doctor.'
