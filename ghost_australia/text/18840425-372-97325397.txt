EXPOSURE of a SPl^lTUXtilST. An amusing defeat of the American spiritualist, Mr. Bastian, is announced from Vienna, where for some time the eminent medium has been the cause of much discus sion among the higher and highest classes of society. The Crown Prince of Austria and Archduke John, having determined to sound the mysteries of Mr. Bastian's art, arranged three eSancea at the Archduke's residence. The first was held without any revelations, but before the second meeting besan nreDarationa were secretly made to Catch the ghost-in a trap. After the select Audience bad gathered in a dimly- lighted room a spirit clad in a garb of mourning silently entered, while the medium was ap parently lying in the next room stiff aud fast asleep. This room was separated from that in which the audience was assembled by a curtained doorway through which the ghost passed. In this entrance the con spirators, however, had fixed a secret door, which they could shut silently and instantly fay touching a spring. While the mournful ghost was flitting before the awe- struck as sembly, this door was suddenly shut, and the ghost, who stood revealed as Mr. Bas ' tian, vainly endeavored to make his escape. The merriment of tho company knew no bounds when the medium's shoes alone were found in the next room, where a few moments before Mr. Bastian had been lying in mesmeric sleep. The depression in spiritualistic circles is naturally very great.
