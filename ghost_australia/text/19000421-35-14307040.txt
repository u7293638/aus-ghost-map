TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-The authorities recommend a campaign against rats, and propose to distribute poison to householders for the purpose of their destruction, but I think those who have had any experience will join with me in predicting the failure of any such plan It will be found that of her a few victims have given up the ghost behind skirting boards and be the cou floor and ceiling that the remaining Poisoned baits will be ground for weeks untouched, and a new poison will have to be substituted every other day Poisoning, I affirm, is far more likely to cause sickness than prevent it and it would be just as effective of good results to appoint 100 professional flea catchers Though poisoning no doubt will score a few victims, the remedy is worse than the disease I again desire to observe that the measure proposed, loft also to individual efforts, is bound to prove a failure , but perhaps it will not be out of place to mention the method adopted by the authorities of Paris during the siege of 1870 Large and deep pits were sunk within the sewers and similar localities, and were partly filled with glucose, for which, it appears, ruts are found to have an extraordinary p collection. Jumping into the pits the rats were unable to get out and were sold in thousands as food at sixpence each to the starving and consequently appreciative curious They were often flatteringly referred to as house rabbits, but after all a rat by any other name would taste us sweet. While suggesting a method of reducing the rat nuisance I am by no means a subject to the present metaphor, used rank blasphemy as it will be considered by the orthodox, authority having spoken, I do not believe that rats have much to do with the spread of the plague, and if kindly permitted space will endeavour to allay the unreasonable alarm by the application of a little common sense I maintain that it has not yet been definitely proved that rats are the principal media of the plague to humanity It is evident they are subject in the disease, and generally die in large numbers previous to the disease developing amongst mankind, but it is quite possible, and indeed probable, that the original cause rejecting the one also induces the disease in the other. It seems highly probable that the disease germs, being carried here perhaps months, or even years ago, he dormant in or on the soil, and that certain suitable conditions of atmosphere, temperature, density. Ale , or perhaps electrical conditions are conducive to their bursting into life How otherwise can we account for the mysterious blights and diseases which in a few days destroy the harvest of a nation These germs being in the soil on the surface, or floating, as (millions have been proved to be invisible dust in the air, the rat being near to the surface is naturally the first to suffer and fact he serves the purpose of a danger signal, notifying us of the insanitary condition of the ground floor The plague bacillus is simply a vegetable growth like that of any other plant which gratis luxuriantly in suitable soil indeed, it is po's ble, and even very probable, that most of us in Sydney have come into personal contact with floating plague germs, and are none the worse for the encounter. It is simply absurd to allege that the rat is so serious a medium of infection Naturalists will certainly disagree with some of the statements made by our medical luminaries and, upolu, for argument's sake, allowing that bubonic rat fleas bite human beings, how is it they seem to have only one victim in each place of residence { Very peculiar ideas these indeed, and surely it is quite as dangerous to tend, nurse, and even kiss a plagues stricken patient, as many brave and affectionate relatives did with, the party, as it is to stand within a few yards of a district and the entire history of the contacts tends to show that we are very much in the dark on this subject Judging from the excitement raised about rats many appear to think that, like the cockatrice, a glance at an infected rat is sudden death One authority states that he opened the vesicles caused by a bubonic rat flies bite, and obtained in the pus the characteristic rod-like bacillus of plague The latter fact may be con- set, but I by no means accept the inference Of course it is very pre- sumptuous for an outsider to differ from or criticise professional opinion, but all the empires are not outside the charmed circle of duly registered medical practitioners, nor all the intelligent men within it, and until quite recently medical science itself was merely a glorified empiricism, a wandering in the dark As to the rats, which medical science is at fault professional etiquette or interest or prestige admits of no Ignorance, and the rats can't speak in self-defence any more than the poor dogs that were cruelly slaughtered in blind deference to an unreasoning.' name I am. etc, I .
