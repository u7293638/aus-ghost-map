A GBOWL FBOM THE OITV PABE BEAB. Bib,— 1 am the bear that exists in the park. It's not much of a life at tbe best of times ; every boy that cornea along seema to think I'm there to throw atonea at. But, bless you, I only put that down to the funny little ways of human beings toward those who can't help themselvea. Stones don't hurt me much, aa my coat is thick. But 1 feel mighty bad in bot weather ; my cage ia placed so that the aun shines on me all to cold weather, but my present mastera seem to bave forgotten this fact when they placed me where 1 am. From my home I can see plenty of shady spots, and bow 1 long to live under the shady trees where the deer ran, or even near the pond where the ducks and seagulls swim t In either of these plaoea my cage would have to be placed with its back to the sua, and thereby place me in the ahade. If this were done, and plenty of water given me, my life in Bummer time would not be so unbearable. It's not often tbat 1 growl, but, Mr Editor, yon have probably heard the saying, 'growl like a bear with a sore head.' Well, sir, aince Sunday 1 have had a sore head, and 1 am determined to exercise the privilege of a beat in that condition and growl loud aud long till 1 am changed from my present poBition. My life depends on it, and 1 am not the sort of a bear to give np the ghost without an effort. — Yours, etc., Fob Bbab.
