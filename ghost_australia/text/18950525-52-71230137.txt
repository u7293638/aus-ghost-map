TIMBER. According to bur cablegram of May 14,. Messrs. Gibba and Son state that there ia no sale in London for Victorian stringy bark at preBent, but they are hopeful of the future. The Mersey Docks Board in tends trying a test shipment oE the wood. .* Messrs. Gibbs state that they have re ceived many inquiries about the wood from the north of England, and that . stringy bark now occupies a similar posi tion to that held by jarrah three years ago. They , are confident that tho qualities of stringy bark will soon become - known. With a. view to opening up trade in colonial timbers with different parts of the world, Captains Eounding and Ghost, of the Wool Exchange, Sydney, have for some time past been making a collection of samples of Australian woods for the purpose of sending thom abroad. A few months ago they sent about thirty one varieties to England, which included red and yellow cedar, tulip, striped black and red bean, rosewood, mahogany, silky oak, blue fig, forest oak, black wood, and other woods which are of . commercial ' value. Two samples of iron bark were also s ant which had been in use for about fifty years. They were portions of a pile at the Circular Quay, and to all appearance the wood was as-good as the day it was taken out of the forest. As the result of that shipment, Captains Rounding and Ghest have re ceived an order from England for halE a million feet of red mahogany, and are calling tenders for the supply of that quantity. These gentlemen have received applications from France and Italy for samples of Australian woods, and feel confident, with the continual lowering of freights, th√†b a large foreign trade can be worked up. At present they have a num ber of samples of woods which they intend sending away at an early dato.
