CHAPTER T/XTT. — ' AUYWHERB^ AlTT WHEfiS, OUT OF THE WOMB.'/ Mr. Carew took his daughter back to the carriage, sorely disturbed in mind, and in profoundest darkness of spirit 'as to the cause of thk disturbance.. The in cumbent accompanied them to the car riage, -which -waited at the side- door opening from the chancel, blandly sym pathising with Lady Berriam under these unpleasant circumstances. , A small sprinkling of nursemaids with perambulators, and a fringe of street boys had gathered on the pavement between church-door and carriage, haying scented out a wedding despite the privacy which had attended Lady Peniam's arrange ments. The young women stared their hardest at the bride as she emerged from the chancel door with her veil gathered across heir face. Sylvia's death-like pallor showed conspicuously through that trans parent tissue, and there were murmers of wondering compassion at the whiteness of her face. The small boys in the crowd commented freely upon the bride's death like countenance, and opined that she had been married to that 'skinny old bloke,' meaning Mr. Carew, against her will. Not a word did Sylvia utter during the! brief drive to Willoughby Crescent.. She' alighted without the help of her father's arm, passed with a quick firm step into; ^ the hall, and ran upstairs. Mr. Carew' followed her, and arrived breathless at the door of her boudoir just as she had. reached it. , She turned and confronted him, with angry eyes. ' Why do you follow me ? ' she ex claimed. ' I want nothing except to be left alone.' ' But, Sylvia, for mercy's sake, tell me the meaning of all this unhappiness.* V What brought that man Bain to. the vestry ? ' * ' You will know soon enough. Cannot you leave me in peace for a few hours? Tour wish has been gratified — my mar-' riage is postponed.' '? ' I should be glad of that if there were no trouble for you involved in the post ponement. Why cannot you trust me — vour own father ?' ' Because you never acted a father's part towards me,' answered Lady Per riam. ' I would sooner appeal to strangers for mercy or for aid than to you. Leave me to myself.' Mr. Carey groaned faintly, drew back from the door, whici was shut in his face a moment afterwards. Shut and locked. He heard the turning of the key. But even after having excluded her father Lady Perriam was not destined to be alone. As she locked the door open ing on the landing, Celine emerged from the door of communication with the dressing-room, where she: had been en gaged in her daily labors of tidying ward robes and drawers. ' But, great heaven, Madame, how you are pale,' exclaimed the girl, struck by the change in the face which had beeu so fair an hour ago. ' Don't trouble yourself about my looks, but take off these things as quickly as you can.' The girl, who knew nothing of the in . terrupted wedding, obeyed, wondering not a little, but afraid to question. She took off the pearl-gray satin dress, with its priceless Spanish point, two hundred years old — the white satin slippers—the muslin underskirts, with their ruchings of Brussels lace — all the costly adorn ment upon which Sylvia had bestowed such interest a few days ago. She flung them from her now with a shudder of aversion, as if they had been more loath some than Cinderella's rags. Celine was about to unfasten the slender gold chain which held Edmund's last gift! — the diamond cross. ' Leave that where it is,' said Sylvia^ stopping the girl's hand, 'I shall wear that till I die.' ' Was it possible that Madame's mind wandered a little 1' mused Celine. ' Now give me the . plainest dress I have,' said Sylvia, when all the bridal finery had been taken away. ' But, Madame, there is the travelling dress all ready for you to put on — the dove color and blue — the bonnet the veriest gem. Mademoiselle Marcette said it was an inspiration. Why not the travelling dress ?' ' Be good enough to do as I bid you. ^ Give me my black cashmere.' ' The mourning dress ? Bat Madame, to go into black again after the wedding. It would bring you misfortune.' A look from Lady Perriam stopped the girl's tongue. She brought the sombre mourning dress, which made Sylvia's face seem a shade more ghastly than it had done before. ' That will do,' said Sylvia, 'and now you can go. Tell the household my mar riage has bean put off — perhaps only till to-morrow — possibly, -stUl longer. You will see that my father has everything that he asks for. . I want a few hours' rest, and shall lie down. Don't disturb me till Mr. Standen calls this afternoon.' ' Mr. Standen is going to call. ; They; have not quarrelled then.' thought Celine, '''what can have happened to make her look so awful ?' ?-..,! . She ran downstairs to discuss -this! strange event with Mrs. Tringfoid— as they had discussed -the course of theirj mistress's . brief . . courtship. The other, servants in the house were strangersj with whom ; Celine had no sympathy.1 They were left to wonder and speculate among themselves, while Mra. Tringfold and Celine discoursed in the nursery with closed doors, and a cold chicken and a bottle of champagne from the marriage feast wherewithal to regale themselves. ' I don't believe there'll be any wedi ding breakfast at all,' said Celine ; 'she wouldn't look as she does if the: marriage was only,' put off-fora day. Thera'sjsonlej thins; deeper, than that.' ,.

Tringfold in, earnest converse ; went hj i with hardly a «igh of regret for her child, ? crossed the Hall, opened the' streetf'dooT' softly, and slipped out. ;, ]? Once in the, street, she flew along with light footsteps, turned the: corner of the Crescent into a *ide and busy road, hailed the first cab. she saw, and stepped: into it; . . ' ' , \ '.'-.'?

By chooBing the slower journey she %ould have a chance1 of escap ing them — supposing that any one' took the trouble to follpw her— supposing a»t any one guessed she had gone to France.' At the ^station Lady Petriam found that there was a train which would start for Lewes in half an hour, and that she could get on with some little delay! to! Newhaven, .but at .Newhaven' she would; have to wait till midnight before the boat, started for Dieppe. : ?' ;: j She had no . definite purpose in; this flight — ^no plan 'for the future. No dihi tant ray of hope beckoned her ont Shej only wanted to escape 'the shame of the] present; not to hear Edmund's voice accusing and renouncing her ; pot to be brought face to face with her sin. She wanted to go to some corner of the earth,; and die, nameless and alone. ; The train- conveyed her- to-- Lewes,; wheie she had to wait a weary hour and a half before another train took her on to Newhaven — a dismal.pause.in 'which that solemn scroll wherein her past, life was recorded again unfolded itBelf , and again she thought how sweet her days might have been had she asked for less— had she been content to take her lot in blind sub mission from the urn of Fate— instead .of trying to improve- upon Destiiiy. .All that day she had eaten nothing, and for many past days had lived in a perpetual fever of hope and fear, always vaguely dreading that. V something' which might happen to frustrate her soheme of the future ; never able^ to repose in the calm assurance that Providence would rule her life for the best. - By the time; she took her place in the Newhaven train; faintness increased almost to exhaustion.1 A mist dimmed her eyes, her limbs felt; heavy and painful. ,Tke landscape swain' before her like a troubled sea. ~; She had just strength to get out of the railway carriage to follow a porter to 'the hotel, but she had scarcely entered the sitting-room to which a chambermaid coh-j ducted her when she fell fainting, to the. ground. . -« j The landlady was summoned, and hear-, ing that the unconscious traveller had no; luggage and no attendant, was only mildly] sympathetic. - '. f .

' Truth had spoken in her1 tonnes-- truth had glorified her countenance in that one supreme moment, , iwhenrwith:Uplifted eyes and hands raised to heaven she had asserted her inno cence.5 ' ?'' - That, she had committed an act of cruelty arid injustice in sendiag Mordred Porriam to the dreary imprisonment of a private Lunatic Asylum, was just possible, and that she was smitten with shame atthe teyealment.of this wrong. Alas JEdmumd Standen knew but too well that this en chantress, for whose s?ke he had made so many sacrifices, was not altogether stain less : that Bhe was not' free from the taint. of selfishness. She might have been glad to get rid of a tiresome dependent— to clear her house, of a tiresome old man. She might so far be culpable. —?What shonld-he'doifhe found that it was so? that she had allowed eccentricity to be treated as lunacy; that she had. betrayed the trust left her by her hus band, and had banished Mordred un necessarily from the house of his own fathers ? What should he do ? Blame,' reprove, and then forgive her ; take her to 'his heart again, with all her- errors on her head, and make it the business and duty of his life to reform and elevate her character. This was the lover's resolve. He would set -right the wrong she had done, and then forgive her. Even her sin should not part them. At Hatfield Mr. -Bain hired a fly, and after a good deal of talk With the driver contrived to make him understand the direction in which he required to be con veyed. At first the flyman asserted that he never heard tell of no place within twenty miles- called the Arbor. But after profound, rumination -and scratching his stubbly hairs a little, opined that he did remember having had such a place pointed out to him on Crupskew Common, and 'might it be a 'ouse where they took folks that was a trifle cranky ?' ' That is the place,' replied Mr. Bain ; '' drive us there as fast as you can.' .'?'It's a seven mile drive,' remarked iha man dubiously, ' fourteen mile there and back, and. my fare will be fourteen shillings.' .'*- I shall, not dispute your fare.' ' And somethink for myself ?' 'If you drive quickly there and back I'll give you a crown,' said Edmund, eager to end the discussion. ' Very well, Sir ; you can't say fairer than that ; jump in ; only it's just as well to ayide disputes afterwards, yer see, and it's a wicked road betwixt here and Crup skew Common^' . The man drove off at a smartish pace, and the occupants of his vehicle were soon made acquainted with the wicked ness of the road. Noble prospects and rustic . beauty may abound in the envi rons of Hatfield^ :but the road to the Arbor hugged the ugliness of the land. It lay in- narrow -lanes, and by the margin of waste patches of swampy level, where the 'sour land grew nothing but rush or thistle,' dock or dandelion ; .by black and dismal waterpools ; by scrubby groves of bare and stunted trees ; by meandering:: ditches, across which -pollard willows leaned side-long, extend ing' scraggy arms, like the octopus — such ?a laada^pe'aa that in which Macbeth ;and!Banquo inetihe weird sisters. Yet, J nbl ; ? Scotland , .would not furnish such small- and insignificant ugliness.

In confirmation of bis ssatement ap peared an inscription in white paint on the slate-colored door : — ^ ?? ' - Thh Abboe— Db. Ledlajib. 'Wait for iis,' isaid Air. Bain to the driver, as he and his compjwiion alighted. 'Now, Mr.Standen,' he said, turning to Edmundj while they waited for the opening of the gate, if It is for you or for me to get this old 'man's secret out of him. That he has a secret, and one that will . criminate Lady Perriam, is a fact upon which I am ready to stake every farthing I have in the world.' 'lam here to see the bottom of your scheme, Sir,' answered Edmund, sternly,, ' I believe nothing you assert, I admit! nothing. I am here as Lxdy Perriam's husband to see her righted.' 'You had better see Mordred Perriam righted first,' returned Mr. Bain, with a sneer. . The door was opened after some delay by a slovenly maid-servant, who seemed loth to admit the visitors.. It was not till Mr. Bain had told her that they were friends of Lady Perriam that she aban doned her jealous guardianship of the threshold, and let them pass into the garden. Such a garden — a waste of 'weeds, and mould, and rough moBS-grown gravel — a patch of grass that might fonee have been a smiling lawn, a damp and ancient wil low weeping over a shrunken pond, on whose muddy bosom two dirty ducks dis ported themselves ; a wilderness of pot herbs on one side, where the cheap and fertile scarlet runner ruled dominant, and the vegetable marrow sprawled its tough tendrils and flung its bloated yellpw gourds upon the.: weedy waste. [ 'I don't know as master will allow you to see Mr. Peeram,' said the girl, ' but I'll ask if you'll be so. good as to step into the drawin' room.' The visitors complied with this request, and were forthwith ushered into an apart ment which made some pretension to gen tility. The walls were blotched with damp, and stained with mildew. The atmosphere was earthy, but the circular table boasted a gaily coloracTcover, and was further adorned with*'&, green glass inkstand, a papiermache blotting book, and a photograph album. An ancient cot tage piano stood against one wall, a feeble old sofa faced it, a cheap print or two hinted at Dr. Ledlamb's taste for art. The room was in rigid order, and was evidently held sacred to the reception of visitors. Here the steward and Edmund Standen waited for about a quarter of an hour, which seemed longer to both. There were footsteps in the room above, 'and a run ning up and down stairs, which might indicate confusion, and preparation of some kind, but Mr. Ledlamb did not appear. ' Are these people going to keep us here all day ?' exclaimed Edmund, im patiently. He went over to the fireplace and rang the bell ; not an easy thing to do, for the wire was loose, aud his first efforts only produced a distant jangling sound. 'What a house,' he exclaimed. ' What desolation and decay in every thing.' This aspect of] misery grieved his soul. It would be harder now to forgive Sylvia's sin. That she had placed her brother-in-law under medical restraint, deprived hi™ of actual liberty, he, Edmund Standen, might have schooled himself to pardon. But he had expected to- find her victim surrounded by all temporal comforts, in the care of a medical man of position and reputation, whose name alone would be a guarantee for the patient's good treatment. To find him here — in this abode of misery — in a house on which abject poverty had set its mark! This was in deed a. blow, and the young man — he who a few hours ago had been a proud and happy lover — turned his back upon Shadrach Bain, and shed tears at the thought of that callous selfishness which had abandoned a harmless old man to such an existence as life in Dr. Ledlamb's rural retreat. No answer 'came to the bell. There was a window down to the ground, open ing directly on the weedy patch that had once been a lawn. *? I'll wait no longer,' said Mr. Standen, who had brushed away the traces of his tears and hoped his weakness had escaped the eye of Shadrach Bain. ' I'll explore this wretched hole for myself. You can come with me, or not, as you please, Mr. Bain.' The maid servant appeared at the door just as Edmund opened the window. ' Oh, if you please, Sir,' she said in a gasp, 'I'm very sorry, but I made a mis take in allowing you to come in. Missus says Mr. Ledlamb is up in London at tending to his business there, and it's against his rule for patients' friends to be admitted without an appointment, except it's the friend which placed the patient in his care. And if you'll please to write and ask for an appointment Mr. Ledlamb will let you know when you can Bee Mr. Peeram, providing you has Lady Pee ram's lief ; Mr. Ledlamb 'olding hisself responsible to Lady Peeram, and no one else.' The girl stumbled slowly through this message, which had evidently been laboU riously imprinted upon her mind, for she tried back when she had finished, and went over a good bit of it again, like a musical box. : ? : ' I'll ask for an appointment by and by,' answered Edmund, ; 'but while I am here I'll take a look round your place.' . ' Oh, if you please, Sir, you musn't go out into the garding,'jsaidjthe girl with a frightened look. 'It's against the rules.' ; 'Come, Mr. Bain,' said Edmund, heedless of this remonstrance. He went out of the window, followed by the steward. . - ' Oh, if you please, -you mustn't', gasped the girl, in much -alarm, and then .finding her appeal unheeded she rushed ojut \ of the, roomj ; stole Jupst4irs crying, *' Atispiis, missus, {ne/ve'gone qttt inthi garding, and Mr. ' Peesam'fl there tfitti Sammy in the preamberlater;' ?-'?i-1 . Chapter IiXIV.-^Mr. LEDtAMB's - ' Mr. Standen's first act on getting out into the open was to take a survey of the house, thinking that Mr. Ledlamb's pri soner might in all probability be looking out of one of the windows. But the windows were all ; blank. L., Tiro , of the upper casements were 'guarded by bars, doubtless with the view -of preventing the escape, of any desperate patient, who might , be inclined to emulate Jack,Shep pard's eyaaion from Newgate, j . 'Come round the garden,?' said Mr. Bain ; ''from that girl's anxiety I'll tte bound he's somewhere out here.', - They crossed ihe^grass to the stagnant pond, i where ducks and duckweed flou rished, and where the ancient willow wept the desolation of the scene. That-willow was the one bit of shelter in all that arid waste of garden, and between the- droop ing branches Mr. Bain^s 'keen eye had; discerned Borne object that looked like a human figure. ~-i -' ' - ; He made for this spot, therefore, fol lowed olosely by Edmund. The willow was oh the opposite side of the water/ They went quickly round the edge of the pool, Mr. Bain always in advance. Yob, there was some one under the tree — a child's Bhrill voice sounded as they ap proached, an -old man's piping tones! answering. Mr. Bain parted the willow branches, and looked into the natural arbor. An old man was seated in a dilapi dated wheel- chair, an infant bv his side in an equally dilapidated perambulator, and both these helpless objects were under the care of a tall, lanky-looking girl of about eleven ; years old. Shadrach Bain, not wont to display violent emotions, drew back with a loud cry, aud the ruddy tints of his sunburnt face faded to a sickly white. 'Sir Aubrey Perriam1.' he cried aghast. - ' What do you mean V asked Edmund in a hoarse whisper, seizing the agent by the shoulder. Mr. Bain did not answer him, but crept under the willow, and bent over the old man, taking his hand, and looking into his face. 'Sir Aubrey, don't you know me? I'm. your old steward, IShadrach Bain, pome to fetch you out of this wretched hole, come to. take you back to life.' ' Yes, to life,' answered the old man in senile tones. ' They made believe I was dead. Thev told me to mv face that I. was not Aubrey but Mordred. They put me in Mordred's rooms, and kept me shut up there, and told me it would be worse for me if I called myself Sir Aubrey Perriam. Who was. it that did this?' with a pained look and a wilder tone. 'Not my wife. Oh, no ! not my wife ; not my pretty Sylvia, She was beautiful and good. She could never have been so cruel to me.' . ' Never mind who did it, Sir Aubrey. It is all over now. No one will dare to deny your name when I am by your side. Good God ! what a scheme for a woman to invent — for a woman to execute. I see it all now. It was Mordred who died, and that woman made the world believe it was her husband. I wish you joy of your plighted wife, Mr. Standen,' added the agent, turning to Edmund, who leaned against the sill, white as death. The old man clung to Shadrach Bain, like a child who has been restored to the nurse he loves. ' Yes, I know, I know,' he muttered, ' you are Bain, a good servant, a faithful servant. Take me away from this place ; this dull, cold, cheerless place. They don't beat me, they're not very unkind to me, but they're poor, and everything is comfortless. Carter was always good, but she is ill now, and I'm left with Sammy and Clara, and Clara calls me Mr. Per riam, and laughs at me when I tell her my right name is Sir Aubrey.' Clara was the tall girl, who stood be hind the wheelchair, knitting a baby's sock. ' That's his fancy,' she said sharply. ' When he first went out of his mind he took it into his head that he was his elder brother ; the one that died. It was his brother's death that turned his brain, father says.' 'His brain is no more turned upon some points than yours, my girl,' an swered Mr. Bain. 'His intellect was weakened by a stroke of paralysis, but he's clear enough at times. He has been used very badly, and I mean to take him away from here without loss of time.' 'You can't do that,' said the girl, promptly, ' father won't let you.' ' I shall not ask your father's leave,' replied Shadrach Bain. 'You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Standen ?' ' Yes, I will do what I can to see this poor old man righted,' answered Ed mund gloomily. ' What is the matter with Mrs. Carter, the nurse ?' asked Mr. Bain. ' Inflammation of the lungs. She was took bad a fortnight ago, andiather got her round a bit, at first, but he says the cough has settled on her chest, and she'll never get over it. . She's awful bad. ' We were afraid last night shed hardly have lived .till this morning*' ' If you want to know the particulars of this business you'd better stop and question Mrs. Carter,' said Mr. Bain to Edmund. /'She has been in it from : first to last.. She was Lady Perriam's; prime confidante and adviser.' ' \- 'HI see her,' answered ^Edmund!, 'unless you want my help in getting Sir Aubrey awayj' . ' . . I : He. had been gazing at the old man'i face with earnest scrutiny, to assure him self that this was indeed the elder anc not the younger' brother— that ' he ; was' hot being made the dupe ©f some jug gling of . Mr. Bain's, liiat scrutiny lefjt no doubt in his mind. This was verily' Sir Aubrey Perriam, Sylvia's husband.
