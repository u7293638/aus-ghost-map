THE PERJURED. * In 1804, the picturesque village of C--, iu the county of Derry, was remarkable for its hospitality, refinement, and the general beauty of its females-but there were two who bore the prize from the rest, though they could not surpass each other-Anna Harris and Elizabeth Colville, equally adorned with those graces of mind and per- son which captivate both the heart and under- standing, drew equal admiration from all be- holders. " What grace, what spirit distin- guished the lovely Anna's motions !"-one beau would whisper to another as they rested in the changing country dame-." She is unequalled!"-just then the elegant form of Elizabeth gliding through the witching maze would cause his companion to retort " There, behold her sister!" There was one manly heart in the village still. more tenderly alive to their perfections-more puzzled to draw the line of distinction be- tween them. If he attached himself for a few minutes to Elizabeth, the bright eyes of Anna would seem to reproach him for the temporary distinction, and would quickly re- store his veering allegiance ; again a tender smile from the dimpling cheek of Elizabeth would cut short the transient triumph of Anna. So evidently were his affections divided between them that among all the inhabitants of C-the fair rivals only re- mained unconuinccd that he could never finally prefer one to the other; but there is a something in woman's minti who loves, which iitfretly whispers that she will eventually share the largest ?or,ion of her *&miT;'* heart. The world call ¿'»is vanity, I would give it a softer name. Thou£« allke m *?« attractions and rank there was .«ome diffe- rence in their fortunes. Mr. Coi Ville had roany sons and daughters beside Elizabeth, but being a retired merchant, of considerable wealth, he could bestow a handsome potion on each of his children. Anna was an of ".Vi" '< * , if '&A; ,* 'i -J 'Urívíí»| pKarv 'depending on¡ her- uncle ' and ; Mint, whose liberality arid magnificence* of 'livirtgj were equal to theirfortunc. Their'son and« heir Captain Harris! would of course be- come possessor of his father's property at his decease, and -from Mrs. Harris's private fortune Anna had as 'little to expect ; that good lady having a niece of her own and an adopted daughter also io provide for, I mention this want in Anna, because, in-the opinion of mankind, it would be of conse- quence, though in that of the lover and the simple inhabitants of" C- it was disre- garded. The Castle of C--, in which, with her uncle's family, Anna resided, is nn elegant modern building, surrounded by a domain, noble, spacious, and romantic, through whose woods, parks, and pleasure grounds innumerable rivuleis wind in fanci- ful variety ; here ending in a mimic cascade; there in a majestic basin ; and further re- joining their parent stream, the Meolu, which runs through C-- on its verdant way to meet the noble river Bann (so unjustly overlooked by all geographers), ere the latter mingles with the celebrated lake Nta¿b. No walks could bo more favour- able to lovers than those of the umbrageous Shil-grove. As a tradition pie vailed among the inhabitants of C-r- that the ghost of Baron!)-, who had founded*the castle and domain, stilvN'"vinted ihe beloved scenes of his Vft^axC and this tall, noble wood in par.ti'-lilar, into whose inmost recesses few of the villagois ventured to penetrate; and among the inmates of the castle the panic had extended in a certain degree, so that the fair Anna, much to her satisfaction, pursued her usual morning ramble without any offers of companions, and returned without any enquiries save, " Have you seen the Baron ?" " I mean to walk until I do," she gaily replied, in answer to one of these queries, /' as I have heard he was a fascinating old gentleman, and such are rather rare in these timej." " Apropos, of fascinating gentlemen," said Mrs. Harris, " the match is at last decided between John Shellford and Betsey Colville." "That cannot be true, aunt," snid Miss Sampson, the amiable unpretending friend of Anna. " But I assure you it is, Catherine," said Miss Matilda Millar, the favourite protege of Mrs. Harris, who, as she envied Anna's superior beauty, took every opportunity of mortifying her, " Maria Shellf-ird told me so in confidence last night nt Major Hill's assembly, where John and Betsy danced to- gether for the fiftieth time." " Maria only wishes it to be so, Matilda, she is the chosen friend of Betsey Colville," retorted Miss Sampson, and it was even so, for John ?Shellford's two sisters, like his own affec- tions, were divided by the two lovely rivals. Ellen, warm in the interest of Anna, urged the necessity of a decision constantly upon her brother's mind-while Maria devoted to her friend-Betsy, for ever rung her perfec- tions in his ear. When perplexed alike by them, contrary entreaties and his own feel- ings-he would turn to 1rs parents for their opinion, they only puzzled him more. His father sternly declaring he would disinherit bim, and entail the estate on his younger brother Henry, if he* married any woman but Miss Harris-while his mother, whom he tenderly loved, assured him it would break her heart if he forsook Miss Colville. " Was ever man so tormented with conflict- ing emotions !" he said, on quitting the breakfast-room, one morning after a wann debate upon this all engrossing topic. " Can you not assist me Harry ? happy light hearted brother. Oh ! how willingly I would now exchange this too sensitive mind for your mad-cap follies that I used to con- demn." " Assist you, Jack, by h——n I mean to do so ; I'll elope with Betsy at the next concert." *? Good h——n, you're not serious ?" " To be sure I am ; 'is not one fine woman enough for you ? you sentimen- tal whining dog that can't distinguish a black eye from a blue." " Then Harry I'll re- nounce our relationship for ever if you perpetrate such a —— " D——n it, man! you can't marry both ; and by my immor- tality if I thought you had any other inten- tions respecting Betsy Colville, I would send you to look for a mistress among the houries of Mahomet;" and he dashed the door with violence as he left the room. John knew his brother's mad ways, but there was an earnestness in his manner now, that suggested what-gave additional an- guish to his troubled mind-that Harry loved Elizabeth, and was there not a proba- bility that she might have a leaning towards him. '. Women are sad coquettes, he said to himself.-" While I am racked in mind about the desertion of this girl to please my father, and'secure my property, she may be flirting with that thoughtless, soulless fool. Elope, did he say- aye, but I'd prevent that.-If never mine, she shall not be another's.-" Gall to my inmost soul, the very thought maddens me"-and strange to say, he renewed with more vigour his atten- tions fo Elizabeth, which had been rather waning of late, so true it is, that jealousy feeds love. It was now remarked that Anna took fewer rambles in Shilgrove-and returned with heavier step than formerly. " I would almost think you had seen the Baron this morning ;" said Catharine Simpson, meeting her at the entrance. " You seem so pale, and languid ;" she was in a reverie-and unconsciously raising her azure eyes, her friend discovered them shrined in tears. A hectic passed over her cheek, on seeing her emotion visible, and then, as if so utterly op- pressed as to disregard observation, she sunk upon a seat, and gave unbounded way to the chrys- tal tokens of her sorrow. " This weakness from yon, Anna!" said Catherine, in a gentle tone of reproach, at the same time, embracing her ; " I thought you had a stronger mind-" " I thought so too, but this fatal passion-yet, I will conquer it Kitty, tho'my heartbreak-only grant mea little time, ahttle indulgence, and you will find your Anna is not so degraded as to spend her life in mourning the perjuries of a lover-" that's my noble-minded girl but petjttry!- Hy God, I hope you are not promised to eaoh other."-Anna renewed her tears. " You condemn me, Kitty ; but you must love, as I havo loved, ere you can justly judge-I have ex- changed those vows with bim." Miss Sampson shuddered, " which entitle to perdition the first that breaks them , I consider myself in every senso, but a legal one, his wife, and yet ho is on the eve of \--. ; for her too, Kitty-for her who listens to 'the prating aonsco»o of every beardless boy-who * f ooqtfoties jwitli his brother! !-former he will eon r>¿ sign liis'faithlais'soul'to'ayo'ijastlnz fire» and me to .roiseryVr'7 ,' *» "?.* \'T * ' " .'

"Obi God forbid, let what may come pf me," said the' wretched girl, " I would hnvo the biirthon of my follies fall upon myaelf." The reader's curiosity may be excited to know the won- derful perfections of this " conquering hero." Hu was, of course handsome-but it was the nimoless grace that accompanied tho most trifling act-the gentle manners- the voice tuned lo love's own key -the melting eye-the persuasive word»-that ' flowed from a richly cultivated initid--thatnndenr ing softness which, when combined with manly firmness-has so much influence over ilia trusting heart of woman. It was tho union ¡of these that armed bim with irresistible charms.--" '1 he eagle will gaze nttho sun in its glory, though that blaze of light should blind it," said Klizaboth Colville to der sister-when the latter enquired why she ven- tured into the oorapany of one so fascinating and so unstable-" and rather than be debarred from re- velling in the beams of those heavenly eyes, I w#fi!d di\s by his glance." " Yet you encourage his brother's addresses I 'tis very imprudent Betsy, I shall complain to my father-" Encmrage! I hear with him Amelm-first, because it p ques my fickle swain, and may spur him to the fiiinl goal ; ¿«jcondly, I endure Harry, because he is a She'lford, and to me there is muúc in the name."- " I don't like such courtships, and -I fear they will not end well." " A truce to your melancholy forebodings, my love sups -with me to night, nnJ I must not hear of aught but joy !" (To he continued.")
