PEOMf jaAYTS DAH. ' 10 the Editor of the Chronldc. I Sds, — I find .the ' Ghost of Ban Ban ' has again graced, your colpmn6, aud once morel feel myself called on ^ vindicate my fellow-* townsmen, and tO express the disgust and indig nation his letter, and 'the. mean subterfuge he has resorted to Of - writing In the name of the 'Inhabitants of Gayndah;' have called forth. My fellow-townsmen,' to a man, agree in opinion that Messrs. MackeLzie and Haly have repre sented them conscien tiously and well . Did they not obtain a grant for repairing our roads? for our hospital? for a public school? for the Barambah? fer a bridge at Oakey Creek, which the Ghost looks oppir as so useless, hut which every Gayndah mah knows to be so important to his town f Tesi aud we are aware of all this — and more] that they dischaige their- duty to us thoroughly ^and jn them we have the greatest confidence. \ ' ? What can the Ghost expect from our mem bers ? Does he expect every penny of the revenue to be spent on our district? He speaks of a district conrt.^ IIo forgeta that we have not had a court-houseMti !very.liitejy; 3£j^n he telkB of an immigration jdepot, whi®^^inust be aware is not granted to any inlanSjli^'inj the i-.' colony. But I feel I- am taking unnecessary trouble in giving -this^explanation : toe are all well aware of it, and the Ghost will not see it. ? The Ghost affirms that be knows me, but I am positive that : he does not, from the base motives he attributes to me, and which my cir cumstances alone render impossible* I, how ever, unlike tlie.Ghost, am not afraid of being known, and would scorn ' sailing under false colours' as he has done. The Ghost was at one time rather a source of amusement than otherwise to the Gayndah people, but bin daring and Bballow forgery of their names has disgusted them so much, and so much roused their ire that he has need to fear. I remain, Sir. Tours, &e.;, GATNDAH.
