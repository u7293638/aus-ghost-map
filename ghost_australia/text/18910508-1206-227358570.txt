TOONGABBIE. : ÇFrom ourspwn Correspondent.) The DramaticjsCInb gave their first entertainineiit „OA'AVednesday evening, to a full? house. The various parts were excellently taken, and the characters well maintained throughout by the performers, who were all amateurs. Mr Morrel, our rsteemed stationmaster, 1 deserves special credit for the ieally admirable Way in which he conducted. In the drama " Turn Him Oat," Mr Gleeson took the part of Eglantine Roseleaf in fir§t-;class Jitj-Ie ;.: Mr ^Wrigglesworth, as th injured husband, Mr Moke, well conceived his part ; Miss Humphreys and Miss Gales, as Mrs Moke and Susan tbe housemaid, surprised everyone ; and Mr Morrell was perfect in his part of ' turning him out.' In"the farce of "Browne, the Martyr," Mr Morrel, as Mrs Browne, again acted splendidly ; Mr Chappie, as Mr Browne, did full justice to tbe part ; aud Mr F. Humphrey, as the Artist, quite tickled the audience vvith ii is love story and du mmy figures. A nigger piece, " The Toongabbie Ghost," by Messrafitièsi" Fryer, and Ilollingsworth, was highly arousing, and b;ought the proceedings tôj & most successful close.' At intervals, Mr and Mr3 Home played, several nice selections of music. Both financially and otherwise the affair was a decided success, and we heartily congratulate all concerned on the cheering reward of their efforts, especial praise being due to Mr Morrel. -
