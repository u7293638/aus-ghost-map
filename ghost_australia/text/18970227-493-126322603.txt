GRACE AND BEAUTY. I have known beauty of face to come to some poor saints who, perhaps, had gone mourning all their days, but when their voy age of life was drawing to a close there was a lighting up of their faces and a joy that trans figured them into beauty. But it is . our privilege to be so filled with the joy that comes with lite with Christ that our faces radiate with the happiness we feel. And we need not wait till we are leaving earth to be light ed lip ! If we are filled with the Spirit of the Holy Ghost, tho Comforter, we will be worth looking at nOw.
