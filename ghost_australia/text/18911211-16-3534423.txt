NEWS BY HAIL. (From Papers to 30th October.) AMERICAN CONSERVATISM AND BRITISH LIBERALISM. In an article in the Christian World descrip- tive of the Methodist Ecumenical Council in America, the well-known Methodist minister and litterateur, the Rov. W. J. Dawson, writes:-"So far two tendencies havo been dearly visible. The first is the theological con- servatism of American Methodism. To some of the utterances I have listened with sheer amazement. I asked myself whore those men had lived, and what thoy had read. They seemed not only to resent any fresh handling of theology, but not to know that anything of tho kind had taken place. There was a great deal of talk about the blatant sceptio, and_ very sonnt recognition of the faot that the scepticism of the day is not blatant, but deeply earnest, sincero, and profoundly unhappy. The ex- planation appears to me to lie in the faot that American Methodism has produced praotical men, but not thinkers. It has had no timo to think muoh. It has had to overtake the needs of n population that grows by leaps and bounds. Men who are laying the religious foundations of a nation have no timo for muoh beside practical ecolesiasticism. They are an army on the march, and have no leisure to study tho theory of war. Nor is thore any koon feeling of theological unrest with the people. They, too, aro praotical and aro immersed in affairs. The religious disquiet of Europe has not invaded tho Now 'World. It will do so. As money bogots leisure, leisure will in turn böget culture ; and tho children of the Ameri- cans of to-day will havo to wrestle with the theological problems whioh aflliot us. To a largo oxtont this has happened already. The other marked tendency is the liberalism of British Methodism. The most radioal things that havo been said havo boon by British re- presentatives. It must not bo for a moment supposed that American Methodists aro indif- ferent to culture. Methodism in America is an immense educational force. Thero is now afoot a projcot for tho establishment of a groat Methodist University in Washington." A HOPEFUL FORECAST OF BRITISH TRADE. It is encouraging to find suoh an authority as the president of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce taking a hopeful viow of the stato of British trado. Ile admits that tlio present position is not so satisfactory as could bo desired, but he anticipates a botter stato of things in tho future. In the first placo Lan- cashire will have cheap cotton, and so far as he oan judgo thero will be a sufficient supply of cotton for all our wants during the next twelve months. Thon he thinks that conlidenco is being restored. The difficulties oonnectod with the Baring affair aro all about over, and with peace in the South American Republics, and with a little moro prudence than thoy have shown hitherto wo may expect a better stato of things. Tho faot that the Bank of England has not raised its ratos is an indication of the increased confidonce that exists all over the world. With regard to the Board of Trado returns, they appear to show that our oxports havo decreased during the past nine months to the oxtont of nearly ton millions, and that our imports havo increased by five and a-quarter millions. That is no doubt a vory considerable difference, but some satisfaction is to be dorivod from an analysis of the, figures. The figures of the past three years as to yarns and textiles are :-For 1889, £82,878,000 ; for 1890, £85,003,000 ; for 1891, £80,237,000. The diminution hore shown is no doubt partly duo to the smaller quantity of toxtilo goods Bont to America, and partly to shrinkage in valuo, but in conBidoriog the figures it must bo remembered, Mr. Loo points out, that the year 1890 was the lorgest year wo over had, so that wo need not bo surprised that we appoar to be going back to somo oxtont. Comparing 1891 with 1889, tho falling oft is only about £2,000,000, and that is partly duo to the shrinkage in valuo. And so with regard to motáis. In 1891 the metals aro £1,400,000 more than in 1889, no that itt that rospebt again wo have really no roason to complain. Taking all the other articles, .manufactured or partly manufactured, for 1889, tho figures woro £23,819,000, as against £25,705,000 in 1890 and £24,273,000 in 1891, so that thoro wo have an incroaso on 1889, although a diminution on 1890\. Thus, although at first sight the figures look ominous, the president thinks wo havo no reason to complain. THE UNHAPPY MILLIONAIRES OF SAN FRANCISCO. In San Franoisco the most idoBirablo portion for residential purposes is Nob Hill. It is crowded with dwollings that aro almost regal. Money has boen lavished upon them with the freest hand. The plans, grand in scope and elaborate in detail, have been^arried out with prodigal extravagance, yet most of those dwell- ings, save for the presenoo of a servant or two, aro tenantleBs. Tho gatos aro looked, and the massivo carved doora hidden by casings of plank. Lifeless and forlorn, thop toll no story but that of prido ungratifiod and bappinoss that could not bo purchased. Among tho most notable of tho number is tint of Senator Stanford, who has rofusod to cross his thres- hold since tho death thoro of his only son. Next to it is tho similarly dcsortel houso of tho late Mrs. Hopkins-Searlo, whosojtostamentary dispositions are now giving rise to so muoh scandal. Equally deserted is I the Flood mansion, in tho samo neighbourhood, whioh cost some £800,000 to build. Tho possession of tho Crokor residence is still in dispute, and its windows and doors ¿re boarded up. Tho Ralston Houso, whioh is likewiso vacant, has been tho scone of great! misery, its owner having committed suicide] Another gorgeous mansion close by, whioh ia, filled with mastorpiocos by Durand, Oabanol, and Boura roau, has been deserted since its ownor, a Mr. Bourne, cut his throat there in his bathtub. Indoed, nothing can bo moro sad than tho aspect of Nob Hill, and when one returns from driving through its streets, one feels like having visited some oomctory. Of tho houses of the same kind in Now York, the best known is tho hugo marble pile erected by tho Irish millionaire merchant, A. T. Stewart, whoso body was stolon from his tomb, whoso widow died friondloss and demented, and the disposal of whoso property has constituted the Bubjeot of no end of scandals and sonsational lawsuits. THE POPE AND TnE ARCHBISHOP OF AIX. Tho following is an extract from a lcttor whioh the Popo has addressed to Mgr. Gouthe Soulard, Arohbishop of Aix:-"During your recent stay in tho Eternal City, when wo de- rived much consolation from the admirable piety and devotion of so great a multitude of the faithful, wo certainly had no presontimont of the anguish we were so shortly to undergo owing to unforeseen events. Wo cannot, in- deed, retrain from the thought that something worse threatens us, seeing, as wo do, that so much impunity and licence aro granted to the insultera of the Roman Pontificate. For in faot on tho first protext, angry passions woro allowed fall Bway, and suddenly the oity ro sounded with savage cries. . The fury with whioh our enemies woro filled broke loose. Tho j majesty of an august templo was violated, the j Pontificate was bittorly and ruddy insulted, and tho Catholio naroo was loaded with abuse. Neither the laws of hospitality nor their inno conco shielded many'of tho pilgrims tfrom out- rages and porsonal violence. After these events, which have so soriously impaired the ancient reputation ot tho Italians for courtesy and urbanity, it is evident that tho hatred ot our adversaries increasos day by day; and whatovor the nature of tho hypooritiaal devices employod, the lamontable schemes which are being seoretly formed against us, and against the Holy Soo, beoomo moro and moro apparent. You, vonorablo brother, will continue to fight with your whole strength with us and for the Churoh." MISCELLANEOUS. A Washington correupondont of tho New York Suit statos that the United States Govern- ment has induced both Gormany and Franco to ' acree to lower the import duties on maize to a ' very trifling rate in view of the failure of the Continental harvests. When the arrangements were privately entered upon it is said that the wheat crop in the United State3 was expeoted to yield a surplus for export of only Bomo 150,000 bushels ; but now it is officially esti- mated at four times that amount, or oven more according to other authorities. The result necessarily will bo seriously to oheok tho Euro- pean demand for Amerioan wheat and rye, and that at a time whon the American granaries aro overflowing. In tho diaries of tho late Mr. Cope, R.A., published by Bentley and Son, tho following story is given as told by his sistor-in-law. " She met a farmer friend and said to him, ' I hear, John, that you're latoly married ; who is your wife?' 'Woel, Miss Benning, I doan't quito know.' 'How so? Whoro did you moot with hor ?' « Aweel, ye seo, miss, I went t' market, and as I was going I sood a cunny lass warking along t' road, and I says, ' Will yo got oop and ride?' 'Ay,'sayssho. So sho gat oop, and I asked her, 'Aro ye gangin' to t' market?-'Ay,' says she. * What for ?' says I. ' To git a plaaco,' says she. ' So I Bet her down i' t' niarkot and left hor ; and as I com' back i' t' evening thero was this same- lass warking t' saame way oop hill. So I spak' to her again, and axod her, 'Ha' ye gotten yor plaaco?' ' Nay,' says she, ' I hanna.' 'Will yo git oop and ride?' 'Ay,' says she. So she got oop, and I axod her, ' D'yo think my plaaco would suit yo?' ' What placo is that ?' says sho. ' Why to be my wife,' says ii. 'I doan't mind,' says sho. So wo got wed, and she's a rare good wifo, but she's a perfect straangor to mo.' " Tho typical Yankee faoo has found an enthu- siastic ndmiror in Mr. Millet, tho woll-known Amerioan artist. His country, in his opinion, possesses not only a distinot type of feminine beauty, distinguished for symmotry and refine- ment, but also a strongly accentuated masoulino typo, full of charaotor and picturesqucness. Tho first thing that strikes tho observant eyo of an Amerioan who, after a season abroad, ro- turas to his country sensitive to fresh impres- sions of his native land, is, he assures us, "the peculiar, nervous, high-strung, koon typo of faoo, whioh haB in "it great olomonts of beauty, prominent marka of charaotor, and an accen- tuation of linos whioh aro particularly fascinat- ing to tho painter." Tho immortalisation of this typo is, in Mr. Millet's opinion, a task which may well fire the ambition of any artist. During an inquest at Andovor on a railway guard, in the omploy of tho Midland and South- western Junotion Ballway, it transpirad that ho had boen at work from IO minutes to 5 a.m. on the 15th Ootober till a quartor-past 3 a.m. on the following morning, when ho sustained the injuries that proved fatal. It was shown by a Choltenham tradesman who travelled in deoeasod's van from Swindon to Waybill, that he seemed thoroughly jadod and disinolinod to convorso. On arriving at Woyhill he began to assist in tho shunting. Ho was seen to go towards tho brake, and two minutes lator was found caught in the handle and crushed to death. Mr. W. Ï2. L. Browne, ooronor for North Wilts, and ono of the directors of the company, said ho considered that deoeased was quite equal to the work ho was doing, and he had always appoarod strong and active. Other sorvants were doing equal work, owing to exceptional oiraumstanoes. In con oluBion, ho said ho did not oonsidor twenty-tour hours' continuous duty would impair tho guard's faoultiea so as to rondor him inaapabla of recognising danger. Tho jury deoidad that death was acoidontal, and oensured the oom- pany for working a man until ho was unfit to carry out his duties. Somo years ago tho Bov. Mr. Baxter, of pro- phétie fame, used to delivor a lecture in which ho prediotod that the end of tho world would tako placo in 1901, and that Gonoral Boulanger, who would then be nt tho very height of his power, would bo the Anti-Christ forotold in tho Apocalypso. Since the death of Boulanger nothing of this particular point has been heard from Mr. Baxter. , The speoial correspondent of tho Johannesburg Star, writing from Mashonaland, BayB :-Tho lions kept Lord Randolph Churchill tuokod up ono night, and everyono Kept tight in his waggon or spider, as the case might be. On ono of the shnnting trips Loo shot a lioness out of a troop of seven. It íb not ovoryroal livo lord who sees lions shot. He was wiso, and stuok to his horso and lot Lee blaze away. Liko"Ikoy," he " hadn't lost no lions, and wasn't goin' to look for nono." .It has boen gonorally understood that the Bov. Arthur Bell Nicholls, the husband of Charlotto Bronte!, was dead. But this is not so., Mr. Nioholls (tho Bookman says) ima boon long residont in Ireland, and still occasionally preaches. Ho has maintained a resoluto and honourable silence on the romance of his life. " Ono who was present" tolls tho following amusing inaidont concorning the Gorman Emperor's recent craze for going up and down the Sproo on board a torpodo-boat. The Era poror had beon dining with the Lifo Guards at Borlin, and after dinnor tho officers began to call oaoh other by their nioknamos. Tho Emperor, who was sitting among tho oidor officers, suddenly asked, "And pray, what is my nickname among tho oorps ?" Thore was a moment's consternation ; thon a colonol got up, and, with a polito bow, replied, "loan answer for tho fact that among the oidor officers your Majosty has no nickname" This diplo- matic reply did not satisfy tho Emperor, who forthwith sont for a sprightly young lioutonant and said, " I oommand you to tell mo what nicknamo has boen givon to mo by you and your brother ofucors." "Is it a oommand, your Majesty?" asked the officer with twinkling eyo. "Very woll, thon, your nicknamo is Gondola Willie." It is not ofton that a pawnbroker over- estimates, or rather ovor-pays, tho valuo of a plodgo. Still less likely is it to happon whon the pawnbroker is the Stato. Tho govorrtors of the Mont do Piótú have found themselves pos sossod of an extraordinary stock of meer- schaum pipos. Thoy had beon pledged at tho different shops all about tho samo timo, and had in no case boon rodeemed. The circum- stances lookod suspicious. Soma vvholosalo robbory was foarod, and tho polico woro called in. When tho noxt pipo was presented the pledger was dotained, and tho polioo inquiry oommencod. Tho prisoner told a vory simplo story. Ho said ho was a polisher by trado, and that ho bought wholosalo little blocks of Hawed meerschaum, polished thom, and made thom up into pipos. Thoy oost him on an avorago 1J franc Tho Mont do rióte ad- vanced him 8 franoB, and he sold tho pawn ticket for 2 franos. Thus on oach salo ho was iii francs to the good. Tho inquiries of tho police only corroborated his story, and the prisoner was discharged. But tho authorities aro now most anxious to lay the ghost thoy havo themselves rained. It seems thoy have thousands of thoso pipes in stock-so many that there is to bo a spooial auotion for tho salo of them. In the Shoriff's Court at At torn, in Gormany, ono Fritadlo, a shoomakor by trado, was sum- moned last Week by an apothecary for adver- tising a modicine for salo, ho being an un- licensed parson. Tho following onsuod:-The Judge* You aro charged with having adver- tised for sale in the weekly journals a certain procoss for tho cute of corns without possess- ing tho nocossary legal qualifications. Is that so ?-Shoomakor Fritsoho (emphatically) : No. -The Judco: But you havo advertised tho romedy in tho papers.-Fritucho : Yes. That is quite true. Your Honour will observo I simply stato in my advortisoments I possoss Buoli a rcmody, not that I havo it for salo. I have no spoaifio for Balo apart from the good workmanship and perfeot fit of my boots, which I, with due humility, recommond to your Honour and tho public.-Tho Judge waB satis- fied with the explanation offered by tho accused, and he was discharged. Fritsche loft the justioo chamber amid somo signs of morri mont from tho Bondi and crowded court. , Anderson's Medical Collogo, Glasgow, was opened on Tuesday afternoon with an addross by Professor Watson, who took for his subjoot " The Organisation of tho Medical Profession." Tho State, ho said, maintained an anny to kill. Might it not maintain an army to oura ? Ho suggested that thero ought to bo a gioat De- partment of Health, immodiatoly undor Stato control, with a Miniutor of Health and a vast organisation undor bim, and in whioh each membor of the profession would have his ap- pointed rank and sphere of action as in the army.
