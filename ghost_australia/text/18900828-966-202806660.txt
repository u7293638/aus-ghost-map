JOURNALISTIC HONESTY. TO TBE EDITOR. Sir—The reading public will require something more tangible than the "wishy- washy" subleader appearing in the Advertiser on Monday as a reply to Mr. Hussey's charge accusing your contemporary of journalistic buffoonery and political jobbery of the most glaring description. Mr. Hussey deserves the thanks of the community for exposing such a disgraceful partizanship on the part of a paper which so often boasts of its numerous circulation. Would it be too much to ask the Advertiser in future to confine its columns to the recounting of " tiger yarns" _ and " ghost stories," and leave the discussion of political and other important matters to those papers whose columns are open for the discussion of both sides of the question. It would have been much more to the credit of the Advertiser had it confined itself to replying to Mr. Hussey's accusation, and not attempt by an evasiuu Cf the whole matter to throw out insinuations to the effect that yo« been accused of altering a t _Cgram purporting to be the feeling of Jamestown on the political crisis. The telegram in question appeared in your columns in the exact form it left the hands of your correspondent. The Advertiser makes a big flourish at the end of their article about Mr. Hussey not acting for them in the future, but it is significant that the misleading statements originated in Waymouth-street, and not at Port Elnot. I am, Sir, &c.;, ? J. H. TOUCHELL. Jamestown, August 26.
