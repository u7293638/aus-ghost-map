PORTFOLIO. Look at a ship without a wind, be calmed on the middle sea, its sails flapping idly hither and thither. What a differ ence from the same ship when the wind has filled its sails, and it is making joyful priogress to the haven where it is bound I The breath of God--that is the wind which must fill the sails of our souls. We must pray in the Spirit, in the IHoly Ghost, if we would pray at all.--Archbishop Trench. 'To have recourse to short acts of devo tion in the midst of business is the great art of Christian chemistry, and by means of it the whole course of this life becomes a service to Almiglhty God, and an unin terrupted state of religion.-Sir Mattllheto Hale. When we are not able to do any other thing for men's blhoof, when through mna liciousness or unkindness they vouchsafe not to accept any other good at our hands, prayer is that which we always have it in our power to bestow, and they never on theirs to refise.-IIooker. Is it tolerable that to sue to God thou shouldest be shbumedl, which blushlest not to seek and sue unto 1man ? Should it grieve thee to be a suppliant to Him from whom thou canst not possibly hide thy self: when to open thy sins to him, fromt whom, if thou wouldest thou mnightest conceal them, it doth not anything at all trouble thee ?-SI. Ambrose.
