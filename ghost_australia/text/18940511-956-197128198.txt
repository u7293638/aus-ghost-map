THE GEEAT EXPECTATION. What we have said above of the solemnity of the Consecration Eitual reminds us that we have entered, in the course of our Christian year, upon the ten days between our Lord's Ascension and the Day of Pente cost, in which the little company, not yet formed into the Church, . were figuratively kneeling before the sanctuary, like the Bishop at the altar rails, watching for the promised gift that should bring them mission and power. May God, who knows our difficulties and our insufficiency of ourselves to vanquish them, as He sent down the Holy Ghost upon those waiting disciples of old.-open again the windows of heaven, at the prayers of His people, and pour down upon us such an abundant gift of the spirit of unity and faith and love, that many may be added to the Church daily in every land, and the Churches every where have rest and walk in the Lord and be edified.
