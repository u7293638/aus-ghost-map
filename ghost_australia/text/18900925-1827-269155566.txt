Beatrice was one of the few subjects that could unlock old Edward's breast, and GeofErey retired befoie his confusing but suggestive eloquence. Hurriedly bidding the old man goodnight, he returned to the house, and leaning on the gate watched the twilight dying on the bosom of the west. " Suddenly, a bunch of wild roses in lier girdle, Beatrice emerg ed from the gathering gloom and stood before liim face to face. CHAPTER XXL THE THIRD MTIiAL. Face to face they stood, while at the vision of her sweetness his heart grew still. Pace to . face, and the faint light fell upon her tender loveliness and died in her deep eyes, and the faint breeze fragrant with the breath of pines gently stirred her hair. Oh, it was worth living to see her thus! "I beg your pardon," she said in a puzzled tone, stepping forward to pass the gate. " B e a t r i c e . ' " She gave a little cry, and clu.tphed the railing, else she would have fullleii. One moment she stayed so, looking up towards his face that was hid in the deepening shadow—looking with wild eyes-of hope and fear and" love. " Is it you," she said at length, " or another dream P" " It is I, Beatrice !" he answered, amazed. She recovered herself with an efiort. " Then why did you frighten me S O s h e a s oh, I did not mean to-say-anything cross. "What did I say P I forget. I am so glad that you have come!" knd she'put her hand to her forehead and looked at him again as one-might gaze at a ghost from the grave. ' "Did you not expect me?" Geoffrey asked. ' ' Expect you ? no. No more than I expectcd—" and she stopped suddenly. "It is very odd," he said; ."I thought yon knew tbsit. your father was'going to ask me down.
