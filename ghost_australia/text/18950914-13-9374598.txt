THE AUGUST MAGAZINES. The Unionist victory in Great Britain seems to have plunged the Radicals in a stupor of amazement, and, in the Nineteenth Century, the Rev. Dr. J. G. Rogers unburdens his mind of its sorrows, smites his hand upon his breast, and frankly confessing the severity of the lesson, admonishes his party that, hence- forth it must "rely more upon the education of the people in sound political principles and less upon appeals to a miserable selfishness." He thinks England is at the beginning of a new political era, and that in all probability it is about to enter upon an entire reconstruction of parties. Mr. E. Dicey regards the late general election as " the most overwhelming expression of public confidence ever yet accorded to any political party in the United Kingdom." He must have forgotten the verdict of the con- stituencies in 1832 ; but the public mind was then wrought up to a pitch of intense excite- ment. The great victory of 1S95 has been achieved in the midst of a political calm. Earl Grey's majority was the expression of popular passion ; Lord Salisbury's represents the sober judgment and deliberate opinion of the people of Great Britain. Home Rule has been signally defeated, and the faddists are com- pletely routed, Lord Ribblesdale urges upon the Premier to make a reform of the House of Lords a prominent item in his programme ; the absence of popular ferment being a favourable condition, and his personal ascendency, as well as the majority he con- trols in both Chambers, giving him both the power and the opportunity to medi- tate between them for a readjustment of the structure and functions of the Upper House. Mr. Frederic Harrison de- fends Positivism against the aspersions cast upon it by Mr. Mallock in an article which is worth reading, were it only as a good example of skilful dialectics. Two writers, both of whom appear to be well acquainted with Eastern Asia, point out that in Western China and Tibet there are markets which, if properly opened up, would multiply tenfold, perhaps, the demand for the textile fabrics of Great Britain, and provide an outlet, also, for her hardware and cutlery. As regards Tibet, a treaty came into force in May, 1894, which enables British subjects to travel thither, reside and trade. It also established free trade. Professor Mivart defends Mr. Balfour's book against the attack made upon it by Mr. Herbert Spencer, whom li baute is uitha good dial ot force and humour Hie Proiessor is willing, for nrgiimint s sake, hesn)s, to throw o\er the Old Itstnmtnt but In demurs either to bow down to the unknowable, oV to nccept the gospel according to Spencer -" 1 he good neus that Irom nothing we carne nnd to nothing we go, utter an aimless existence of illusions as to this world and another i lo follow Hie Kel I ledger, Gresham Leotmiron Astronom), contributes in essni ' on stars and molecules n Inch might almost j lie callttl fascinating, on mc to the method of its treatment and the iindness of the con i trusts it presents betwien tin magnitude of i the unnersc-or of that pnssibl) inliniteaimul | purdon of it which meets our assisted i iHioii - mid the nlmost inconceivable minuteness of the tttomic constituents ' of matter, these ultímales being it is i I elided 'of a dinmiter from 230 lol oOO tunis too small lor tin most power | lui microscope to reienl them Accord I ing tonn American hid) theUnnersit) Hxten BlousiBtem lspronngto be of g eatinlue in ' tin United Statis where it acts ns a powerful social Bolitnt ' bringing together m one iindprtnking the labourer and emplo) er the | rich and poor, the profissionnl mun and mechanic' and "enormously increasing the demand for the best literature An interest I ing account is ¿mn b) Miss 1 duli Sellers of the Old A"c Homes in A lenna Hu oldest dates Irom the thirteenth cen turi, but the) owe their modtrn expansion to Joseph the Second at the close ot the . last century, who enacted a poor law ' enabling nn) destitute person at the age of I IJO to claim Irom Ins commune either free board nnd lodging or a pension equivalent to one I hird of his former i ni nines Accord ing lo the writer, the s)sttm works ndnur ubi), mid ' it would be dillicult to find a more conti nted bet of old people than those who lue m these Austrian homes An eloquent defince of priuer by the ex Bishop of S.vilnev restates the old arguments and alliances som new ones with much beauty ol st) le und force of pr« st nttitiou Dr 1 T Dillon, who missent b) tlie/Jeui)/' Jelepa/h to naît Armenia and inquire into I the atrocities perpetrated by, or with the I sanction of the lurkish authorities in that J provinct contributes to the Contemporai¡/ Ue.aew a circumstantial narrative of all he siiw and learned there, and it abundant)} conlirms the worst nports that lune reached u° by cable and justifus the ndoption ot the seicrest meusurcs of repression Lien the hideous massacre of Sussoun he de scribes as " a durne nurcy compared with the hellish., deeds that are being done eiir) wick nnd pier) dav of the year But he expresses a confident belief that lord Salisbury "will find ifiiciiuous menus of putting a sudden and a speed) end to I lu Armenian Pandemonium ' Mr 1 A 1 it/gernld, of the Alpine Club, re lates lim usctntof fin new peaks in the Mount Cook group m New /elland one of these long th« Sefton the Matterhorn ' of the range irom win nee he had the good fortune to disco" cr a pass winch opens up a piacticable route Irom Christchurch to the west* Sefton is 101 J lit aboie the aea kiel, but its the snow line conns down BO low the peak ia in realit) us high ni on the Hooker \ alley us the Mutti rhorn is nboic /ermntt Ouida is n mistress of miectiie She might le called indeed a liiniin in petticoats an I her diatribi against the dictatorship ol ( nspi glows with in ligna non and bristles withiltiitinciator) epithets 1 he Italian Premier is ahull) uni at) rant' n regicide in his primi n lil« rticith in Ins old nee willi a distiised and di fortín 1 imagina non ungovernable ambition and boun Hess vault) who has isla!
