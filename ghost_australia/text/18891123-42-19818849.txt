Without Love or License." A TALE OF SOUTH DEVON. CHAPTER VII. SARAH'S LOVE LETTER. BY HAWLEY SMART. "Well, Mary, what do you think of him?" inquired the banker, as he and his daughter sat tête-a-tête at dinner the evening after Fred Hallaton had left them. " He is a nice gentlemanly young msn," re pUed the girl. "I rather Uke bim; bat don't yoa think it rather odd, papa, tbat be should know Miss Meroer ?" " No, I can't say I do," replied Mr. Lydney. •• Miss Meroer is a very good- looking young woman, and I should think by no means diffi oult to know. I dare say she has a pretty numerous aoquaintanoe amongst the young men here." Mary Lydney said no more ; sbe and HaUa ton had got on very well together, bnt she couldn't quite get over thst bow npon the Esplanade, although the subjeot had never been alluded to between them sinoe. When two or three days had passed without Fred HaUaton making his appearanoe at the Dragon, Sarah Meroer began to get somewhat uneasy. Although she did not care for him she did not wii-h that this man should escape her toUs. It might or it might not suit her to marry him, for Miss Meroer went so far as to piotnre that circumstance as sure to be at her option in due oourse, but it gratified her vanity to think that she had one of the officers from Exeter dangling iv her train, and when three days elapsed, and she still neithor caw nor heard of HaUaton, Sarah began to bave misgivings. In her experience, and it was by no means circum scribed, she had found that constant interviews were necessary to maintain her thrall. When her admirers, from either aoeident or design, ceased to see her frequently they were speedily disenchanted. The fact obtruded itself that free from the glamour of her splendid and rather sensuous beauty Miss Mercer was a somewhat vulgar half-educated young woman, and her first idea had been to treat Fred with consider able hauteur when he ehould appear. He was to be thoroughly well rated for his neglect, and then forgiven. But unfortunately for tbe carry ing ont of thiß programme Fred's presenco was necessary, and he still shunned the Dragon. Sarah was naturaUy a passionate woman, but Bhe oould control her temper whon Bhe saw good oause for doing so. Fred HaUaton's chains were not quite so tightly riveted as she had deemed thorn. Sho had changed ber tactics, and despatobed a short note to the delinquent. " Why are you angry with poor me ?" it ran. " You might at least como and tell me what I've done wrong-. Ever your-*, Sarah."

I - -J ' • . * ... words were penned it dught to~have saved him muoh future misery. Fred, indeed, on his side, wss not a Uttle wt<*h with the fair Sarah himself. He knew as well, asMus Lydnej that the salute on the Esplanade had been given with malice prepense, and it angered him that Sarah had deliberately placed him in suoh an awkward situation. But Fred was too deeply smitten to nurse his indignation too long. He was already onoe more meditating acaU at the Dragon wben Sarah's note was put into his hands, and, it need scarcely be said, that effectuaUy clinched his resolve. He was received with mnoh oordiaUty. Sarah's faoe flushed with downright pleasure at the suocess of her stratagem. She honestly waa excessively glad te see him again. She had missed hia adulation. It was a necessity to this girl thst some msn should be always pouring oneyed words into her ear. Eren her father was pleased to see the young feUow sgsin. As we know, Joe Mercer had somewhat ambitious aspirations for his daughter, and muttered to himself, "He would do, if he'd take a fanoy to to her, as Sam 'ud cay. Gentlemen don't oome shinning round every day." "Now, Mr. HaUaton," exclaimed Sarah. " I will take you to see old Bob Mutter if yoa liko, and yon oan hear from his own lips all that ho has got to teU about the old inn." " I think I'd rather hear it from yoa than from him," rejoined Fred, with an ardent {■lance at his enslaver. " Let us hare one mon ook at the old baUroom before yon begin." Sarah laughed, and rejoined, "WeU, with yon to proteot me, I don't mind, bnt I honestly don't care about going there by myself. It gives me the creeps—but oome along/ and sbe led the way. On arriving at the door, she turned the handle, aad then said, " I oan't open it." "It's a Uttle stiff from dis uso," suggested Fred. "Let me try." mv—>** She stood baok whUe he essayed to open the door. He turned the handle sharply, and gave it a good jerk, and then remarked, "No wonder we oan't get in. It is looked." „ w <T onde, r w. bat *&'• iot" Ufil*^ Sarah. " Wait a minute, we'U go and ask father for the key." They accordingly wended their way baok again, and found Joe Moroer and Brent talking together in the bar parlour. " We want to have a look at the old baUroom, father,andsomebodyhaslookeditup. Have yoa the key?" * Joe Mercer nnd Brent exchanged a rapid glance. "Yes, but it is upstairs," responded tba former, after a short pause. " I have looked it up beoause the floor is not safe." , 'l? rhj\\-'athe!> o*? I**"**1 **"** »ne girl, "we went in there the other day. Tbe room was dusty and ghostly enough, bnt tbere wasn't a board even creaked nnder ns." "What the devU are yon doing here, sir," suddenly inquired Brent, so fiercely tbat the other three looked round in utter amassment to see what had produced this explosion. Standing in the doorway, with both ears un mistakably oooked, was Mr. Tootoll. If ever a man had curiosity limned in every line of hia faoe, if ever a man was Ustening to a conversa tion of absorbing interest, it was Mr. TooteU at that moment. "What am I doing P" be repUed, in answer to Brent's question. " I have just dropped ia for a tankard of mUd ale, and to sse bow my old friend is. Ah! Mr. Hallston. I hope I see {on weU, sir. No cause to ask after yon, Miss [ercer, you look blooming." Miss Mercer responded by sn indignant shrug of her shoulders, while HaUaton returned the old gossip's greeting witb a contemptuous ■tars. " Br the way, Joe, you never told me about tbe old baUroom. I'd Uke to sse it. Tbat reminds me, I've never been thoroughly over the old bouse yet." J " WeU, then, yon oan't sse tbe old baUroom to-day, that's all I have got to say," replied Mercer. "In my mind the old baUroom is unsafe. I've looked it up, and I'm not a goin' to open it for anyone. Fm not a goin' to nave any broken legs lying abont my premises." " WeU, Mr. Mercer," said HaUaton, laugh ing. " I don't think there'U he muoh ride of that, but if yon don't want us to go into the room, of ooarse that's sufficient." " No, no, tut, tut. You young gentlemen are always so hasty. I'm very anxious to see that baUroom. I don't mind even if tbere is a Uttle danger. To think now, Joe, tbat yoa never mentioned that baUroom to me before !" " I'm sorry I oan't obUge you, Mr. HaUa ton, but I stiok to what I aay. I thought it best to look that room np, ana locked I intend to keep it." "Quito right. Joe, quite right," said Mr. TooteU, as Sarah and her admirer quitted the parlour. "Not the thing to let foolish young people like that go exploring by themselves, but now they're gone you and I'U just go and havo a look at that floor by ourselves. Might be something to be made of that room, Joe, who knows ? We might get up a free and easy there. I'm rather a card you know in that way, and I'm sure I'd be always ready to oblige." ' Brent oast a meaning look at Joe Mercer, and then left the room. " Odd thing," remarked Mr. TooteU, " that man always reminds me of someone I used to know long ago." " Who might that be ?" asked the other, nn easily. " That's just what I oan't oall to mind, but it's someone I know before I came here, I fanoy. It puts a man out not being able to think of a thing like this," said Mr. TooteU, meditatively. " Now, Joe, what about that baUroom ?" " We'd best have this thing msde dear at onoe," said Mercer, angrily. " I keep a house of entertainment in whioh there are certain rooms set apart for the public; the remainder of the house I intend to keep for myself. If the publio rooms ain't enough for you you'd best go some whero ebio for yonr liquor." "No, no, Joe," replied TooteU. "I'm not agoin' to desert, an old friend liko that, but it's impossible for me to adviao you without looking ovrr tbo preini'-DH, you know." "Advieeme!" cried Joe," what about? Who the dickens asked your advice r" " Now don't Jjet hasty," repUed ln>. TooteU; "of oourse I thought yoa were asking my opinion about doing the house np a bit." 44 Then you had best understand," retorted the landlord of the Dragon, " that I don't want yoar opinion about that or anything else;" with whkh sweeping disclaimer of any assist ance Mercer left nis guest to finish his ale by bimself. The idea of a sort of Bluebeard's oupboard in the Dragon roused Mr. TooteU's curiosity to a feverish height. He felt that he must see the inside of this looked room. What reason bad Meroer for keeping it shut up; that its being unsafe was a mere exouse was palpable, and while he drank his ale Mr. TooteU's busy brain was lost in vain conjecture as to what might be the secret of this carefully guarded chamber, and how he was to obtain a peep into it He had not Uved in Exmouth all these years without having heard of the ballroom nnd the ancient glories of the Dragon, bat it had never -moaned to him tiU that morning that the baUroom was stiU in existence. He knew that • considerable part of the house was shut up, but hsd never before felt the slightest curiosity abont these; empty unfurnished rooms. But, now there was a mystery about them, he felt be should never rest till it was solved. He wondered whether it was possible to get a peep in at the windows of tbe mystio chamber. The Dragon was built like a T, of whioh the top faoed the road, while the taU ran baok into the Sarden, and to whioh in the old days the win ows of the ballroom bad opened. Mr. TooteU knew enough of the house to know that this tail of the T was the disused part, and that of ooarse in that was the room into which he was so anxious to penetrate. Mr. TooteU finished his ale, and was about to take his way home again, when he suddenly bethought him that it was worth while to take a tarn round tiie garden and ace what he oould make out at the baok of the house. It wss a large old-fashioned garden by no means care fully kept, and in whioh there had never been the sUgbtost attempt to oonform to tbe modern faahion of groups of small beds in intricate patterns, with trim narrow borders of lobelia, {golden chain, or other aimilar plants. The arge grasa plot in the oentre was surrounded by various shrubberies with great deep borders in front of them, in whkh the flowers grew in wild luxuriance, and looked almost as if they bad been sown broadcast. It was evidently bat very roughly cared for, and even TooteU ooold see that in the hands of anyone who had a rami love for a garden it bad great oapabiU ties. Prying about, and making diligent nse of bis eyes, Mr. TooteU had little trouble in making out to hie own satisfaction whioh wore the windows of the ballroom. Those three taU windows, of whioh the oentre one ran down to tba ground, and was flanked on each side by a bay window, stopping just short enough of the walk outside as to allow for a seat in eaoh, pointed unmistakably to the object of Mr. TooteU's quest, but it required only a glance to sea that they were boarded np on the inside, and that therefore, aa he reflected rnefoUy, tbere was no opportunity for making a peep hole unless the glass was first broken. Mr. TooteU's further researches were suddenly stopped ahort by a significant oough, and it was beautiful to see then how absorbed he at onoe beoame in the cabbage roses, the view, or any thing else indeed exoept the old baUroom. 44 "What," ssid Brent, as he advanced witb a mocking smile on his Ups, " as-yoa couldn't see tbe inside yon thought you wonld come and look at the out. WeU, that's it, aad now I hope you're satisfied." "Very interesting, indeed," replied Mr. TooteU; " I can quito fanoy it being a most exosllent room for the purpose. Dancing in side-, then people stepped out by the window, aad doubtless had refreshment's of all kinds. I teU you what," oontinued Mr. TooteU, " if the landlord in those days knew his business he had lota of Uttle tables and chairs sll over thst grass plot." 44 And if tho landlord of those knew hisbnsi* nsas, he wonld aUow no prying, old fools about bis promises." With whioh far from flattering observation Mr. Brent turned sharply on his heel and made his way round to the front of the honse, where the landlord of the Dragon atood, his hands thrust deep into his pockets, and apparently buried in deep thought. 44 It's devilish unluoky, Mercer, that that in quisitive old idiot should have overheard your daughter ask for the key of the ballroom. By the-way, I told you the other day somebody had been in there." 44 Why, what's the matter now?" inquired Joe. 44 He's gone pottering round to tho garden to have a look at the house on that side ; he has made out the ballroom, and he'll never rest till he gets a peep at it." 44We11/' said Joo, with a chuckle, "if as mnoh as ho can see through tho windows con tents him, ho is weloomo. I saw to tho board ing np of those windows mysoif, and I'm blessed if there's a chink to put an eye to. No, no, he'll do us no harm that way, and I'll take good care ho never has tho key. But I'll tell you one thing that looks queer; ho says you remind him of some one he met long ago." 44N0, did he say that?" inquired Brent, eagerly. 44 Yes; says he oan't recollect who, hut thinks it was some ono he know before he ever oame to Exmouth." Brent drew a breath of relief. "Then it's aU right," he exclaimed; " but, of oourse, I might have known it was, he never did know me in Exmouth. I had left it before he came here." As Mr. TooteU walked baok to the town again he muttered, "That Mr. Brent is so rude, it's extraordinary I do not rooolleot him." But TooteU was used to Bueh rebuffs, and was often wont to remark to himself, with a sigh, "There ain't no politeness loft in this world." CaAPTBE VIII. THE WARJ'TNO. The weeks slipped by. Lxinouth had novor bsan gayer than it was that Bummer. Gar-lon parties, tennis tournament**, crickot matches, water picnics, and danoo*! folio wod each other iv rapid succession. Flonty was also going on in Exeter, and t.lio revels ia both plautw worn attended by tho people of eaoh town. Fred HaUaton threw himself into aU the fun goiug on round him with all the life and vigour that characterised his nature. In the ballroom, in front of the nets, or in front of the wiokets he threw himself into the pastime of the hour heart and soul. He was by no means a bad feUow, but he was apt to pursue the pleasure of the moment without counting the oost, and at the present time was playing a game that has often brought infinite tribulation to the player. He was paying marked attention to one woman, whUe he was madly in love with another. Mary Lydney was no foolish sentimental young woman to let her heart go out of her keeping at the first few courtesies that a man might pay to hor. She had had two disappoint ments, tbe latter of which she had borne with becoming resignation, but the first had been a very different matter. Her heartstrings had been sore wrnng about that flrst love affair; for a long time she had not known how it was that her betrothed had suddenly left her. But per sistent questioning foroed from her father the humiUating faot that her fiance had broken off his engagement because he could come to no satisfactory arrangement in money matters with Mr. Lydney. What particular point he had taken umbrage at she had never oared to in quire. She felt aure that her father would be most Überal in his offer of settlements, and she cowered with shame when she thought that tins man, who had professed to love her so dearly, had loved not herself but her money. As her father's only daughter she supposed that some of these days she should not only be very well off, but that her father would make her a hand some allowance if he approved of her ohoioe, and she thought that the man whose require ments in this respect her father had failed to satisfy must be indeed greedy of gold. She liked HaUaton, and oould not help being aware that he paid her marked attention, but she was not likely to let her heart go lightly out of her own keeping a second time. Then, moreover, she knew of his acquaintance with " that very objectionable Miss Mercer," and she often wondered whether he saw anything of that young lady now. She had never asked him; thoy had tacitly agreed that that fair damsel was never to be the subjeot of their discourse. Strangely enough, Sarah was equally ourious to know if Fred saw much of Miss Lydney, but HaUaton sternly repressed all inquiries in that direction, and imperious as the girt was, and great as was her power over him, she fonnd her lover, too, had a temper of his own, and, strange to ssy, she Uked him all the better for it. Sarah Mercer had heen co accustomed to rule her swains right royally tbat it interested her to have a man at'her feet whom she could not quite deal with as she pleased. That society generally had noticed how attentive the young artilleryman was to Mary Lydney it is needless to aay, and that sooiety waggled ite head and whispered that all was arranged between Mr. ftallaton and the banker's daughter. Some of those dear elderly ladies to whom a past scandal is a thing preserved, but never buried, whisj Kred ominously that the thing had happened Ice before, that Mary had no difficulty irt getting engaged, but in her case that never seemed to lead to a wedding. As for Dicky Chives, when the rumour first met his oars, he put down his pipe, and said, gravely, and in awestruok tones, " Is this true, you feUows? I don't go gadding about yod know v but has he gone too far to pa faqsd» be cause if he hasn't I'U apeak to him ?" But his comrade generally replied that Hal 4 laton was making uncommon strong running if he didn't mean it, and that if he was not am* gaged yet he was as good as. On hearing which Dioky resumed his brule-guele, puffed a heavy oloud of smoke from nnder his moustache, and grimly ejaculated, " There's another good man gone wrong!" ' Dioky consequently never said anything to Fred concerning tbis rumour. He hated to see his ohums marry, beoause he knew that they then became lost to him in that oapaoity. It was not that the bettor halves of some of these lost sheep bad not striven to make their houses pleasant to their husbands' old friend; the difficulty was with Dioky him self ; he got on very weU with ladies once induoed to mingle with them, and indeed would have been rather a favourite with them if he oould only be persuaded to go more fre quently amongst them, but, to use his own expression, he " Bhied at a pottlooat." It must have been, I suppose, the mental strain required for the making of small talk, for he was a msn to whom, exoept in the matter of tobacco, a lady's presence imposed no very unaccustomed restraint. If Chives had asked Fred whether he wss going to marry Miss Lydney that gentleman would probably have told Dioky not to be a fool. " I visit a good deal at their house at Exmouth; it's all rot to think just beoause a man is a little oivil to the daughter of tbe house that he is thinking about marrying her;" and at the present moment it was probable that Fred had never taken thought to himself of what would bo the end of oithor of his love affairs. Yot, with all the gaiety he was mixed up in, HaUaton found time somehow to pay many a visit to tho Old Dragon Inn. He made a flimsy protoxt of a passion for hearing thoso old smuggling legends, and had ovon boon takeu by Sarah to see old Bob Mutter. He had made that veteran happy by a largesse of silver and tobaooo, and endured, as ho laughingly romarked, two or three -stupendous lies from the lips of that drunken old sailor. But, for tho most part, ho sought hiß information from Miss Mercer's own pretty mouth, to whioh his own at times got in closer proximity than strict etiquotte warranted. "I can't think," said Sarah, ns she walked lovingly with Fred HaUaton in tho garden one autumn afternoon, " what father's fad is about that old baUroom. He keeps it moat jealously locked: as for its being unsafe, that s all moonshine." ,,»„. " It doesn't mnch matter," repliod llallaton. " It id only an old man's whim, 1 fancy. It may bo that your fathor has got it into his bead that somo of all the lumber and old furniture we Baw thc.ro L valuable." " I bicsp a ffood way fiom it," replied Sarah, "but soinc-t.imji. I hear htruiivti noisos that snuncl us il* tlw'V .'itinn from tl)'- "Id i'»om. I told mother ro 'thn o>bor day, and remarked that, if thu gliosis of tho old smugglers had come bsok, thoy must have oome in very sub stantial form." 44 And what did Mrs. Meroer say P 44 Nearly snapped my noae off," repued the girl, laughing. " Told me I was old enough to know better, and that Bhe would trouble me to hold my tongue, and not go talking about suoh things, adding: 'If you go gabbling about ghosts I shall have the girls afraid to move about the house now the days are drawing in. Father and Mr. Brent, too, are^ quite touchy about any allusion to that room." " I oan't see whst Mr. Brent has to do with it," said HaUaton, " any more than I oan ace what on earth he is doing here. By the way, what does he do here?" __,, . 44 I'm aure I don't know," replied Sarah; "he goes out very little, and never, to my knowledge, into Exmouth. He seems to spend most of his time talking to father." HaUaton here turned the conversation into more personal channels. His question had been aaked from very idleness, for what Mr. Brent's business might be at tbe Dragon was a thing in which he felt no interest. Inside the bar parlour it was evident that something unusual had occurred to disturb the usually tranquU conversation that went on between Joe Meroer and his guest. 44 This letter is sorious," exolaimed Brent. 44 That inquisitive chattering magpie TooteU was bad enough, but even if be did succeed in recollecting me, although it would be awkward, stiU there oould be no snob consequences as would happen in this oase." "Read the letter again," repUed Meroer sentontiously. 44 Letter," returned the other; " it's only a Une from one of my most trusted confederates— a man who has been in a good many big things with me. He don't say muoh, but Jim oan say a good deal in a few wordß. There's nothing more than this:— 4 Mind yourselves; Creasy is out.' And if he hsd said the DevU is un chained I shouldn't hsve considered it so serions." .,_.„  " Well, I oan't quito understand it," said Meroer. "To begin with, who is Creasey, and what is he out of ?" 44 Ont of prison, curse him! Creasey is the bane of my existence, the mUlstone that has been round my neok all my life. But for Creasy," continued Brent passionately, "I might have been somothing very different. I unjustly got the oredit years ago of a robbery that Creasey committed, and a robber in some shape I've remained ever sinoe. I've never stooped to be the mere vulgar bandit thst Creasey is—a man who has adopted burglary as his calling." Carried away by his own tempestuous feelings Brent did not notioe his companion's oounto nanee, but suddenly his eye fell upon Joe's awestruok face, and, pausing, he said with.a laugh, " Do I frighten yon, old man?" "I knew nothing about Creasey," was the reply; " you never told me you were mixed up with people of that sort; and what is the nee of railing things by such ugly names P I don't hold with robbery, mind you." 44 Ah, you dont!" ssid Brent; " pray, what do yon call onr present business?" 44 WeU, it is smart trading, if you must talk abont it," said Joe. " I tarct all the prodace I csn off the farm, and sell it at the best market." Brent burst into a fit of laughter. " Now," oontinued Joe, "what about Creasey? Not tbat I have any desire to make his acquaint ance; but how can he interfere with us P Does he know you're here P" "No; but he will," rejoined Brent; "as I tell him, there's no shaking him off. He'd find me if I was in the midst of tbe Australian bush. He always does, exoept he's looked up." 44 WeU, what does he want when be has found you?" 44 Money," said the other; " bnt that's not the worst of it. He'll want to know what I'm doing, and, worse still, to have a hand in it." "Oh Lord!" said Jos; " and then I suppose that he'U blow the gaff ?" 44N0; to do Creasey justice, he's not that sort quite, but he is just as bad. Out of his own business he's the stupidest chap I know. Give him a centrebit, a jemmy, a pair of goloshes, and a box of safety matohes, and I believe he is olever; bat for anything that requires headwork and combination he is a hopeless dunderhead. Ho has spoilt three or four of the best things I ever planned; not that he has * rounded' intentionally; he hss let the cat out of the bag from sheer stupidity." 44 But can't you give him money and beg him to go away for the present ?'' " You don't know him," said Brent. " The obstinate old man claims to have a great Uking for me. Go! Not be. He'd settle down olose to us, break into a honse once a week just to keep his hand in, and fiually 4oraok* tho Dragon somo night, just to see what • his dear boy, as he calls me, is about." 44Then what do you propose to do?" said Joe. " I told you the othor day I wished I'd never gone with it. I should have liked to back out of it even then; but now that we aro making money so fast I own I should like to risk it a little longer." 44 What we must do is this," replied Brent; 4'as soon as Croasoy makes his appearance— and appear he will, aB Bure as fate, though at present he neither knows my address nor tho name I'm going under—we must stop the con concern, and I must make a olean bolt of it abroad." 44 Why abroad?" inquired Joe Meroer. 44 Simply because that's the only place where I've a chance of shaking off Creasey. Foreign towns confuse him, and moreover the foreign polioe are lynx-eyed. Creasey is never long on the Continent before he disappears into retirement." " And then P" said Mercer. " It'll bo timo to think what thon when I've shaken off my incubus;" and with those words Bront suddenly vanished down tie passage in the direction of tho ballroom. .Too Mercer hud inoHt clearly ox pressed his feelings in hia conversation with Hrent. Ho had boon very loth to go into a bu-dncs* which he know placed him within tho trammels of tho law. Hard bir-jains he had driven, and vory close to tha wind had ho t-nilod arr-tiu and atfuiu in bis dc'-lin-***-* ; somo of his doi-i**;** c0r.1.-l by no lne-inn morally h*-** condora-d, iiltliouirh lin.-i.Uy no man could iutorfero with him.

This story, oft repeated into Joe's avid ears, added to the suggestion that the Old Dragon Inn was the very plaoe for their purpose, and on offer at a very low rent, at lost induced Meroer to ombark on the speculation; for onoe his greed for gold got the better of his habitual {irudenoe. And the landlord of the Dragon onnd himself tbe possessor of a thriving business, but a business whioh brooks no investigation. [to bs 00-rrnrußn.]
