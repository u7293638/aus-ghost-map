PIaLBa, flERVEY'S BAY. I [FROM A CORRESPONDENT.] 1 I PBESUMEyou have had frost in Maryborough ; that is a visitor we are not troubled with at the coast Some about here are planting both English and sweet potatoes, and clearing off rosellas, which have grown so abundantly that they are thrown away, there being no market for them We never see a schooner calling in since the Independence gave up the ghost. It is a great loss and additional expense to us getting goods from town by drays, besides the risk of many things being broken. I repeat I wish some more land owners at Poison would build, and rt-siae on tneir property clown here, for, in addition to the probability of a mail, there would be some inducemeat for a vessel, yes, even a 6teamer, to call in weekly. And if those who had property at the Bay lived here themselves, instead of in town, they would feel the inconvenience of being weeks without a chance of even sending a letter to town. Of course, it is nothing to wealthy people, who can either go or send to town ; but to those of limited means, who cannot afford to do so, it is a serious drawback. I trust those who have influence in high places will exert themselves in the matter. I may venture to state that this place is as numerously visited in summer as -andgate, where there is a mail twice, a week. The houses to let by Messrs. Kehlet. Souther den, Watson, and Towzev are eenerallv occu pied during the summer, and occasionally ! through the year â€” besides the residents here and about, who are not able to visit town fre- ; quently, and who suffer most severely through j not getting their letters for such a long time. There is a grub destroying the potatoe i stalks down here, everything else looks well. j Tbis should have gone last week, but I had no ! opportunity to send it. J
