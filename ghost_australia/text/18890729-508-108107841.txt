School of Arts. A number of very good readings-and recitations ?were given in the School of Arts last Friday night, by Mr. C. B. Teece, bandsfer-at-Iaw, who wisely dispensed with that time-honored chairman, who deems it incumbent upon 'him to deliver himself of a dull introduction, to ' yawn behind the table; and to become duller than ever at-the close, when people are more busied about their return trams or 'buses than about his feeble approbation. Unin cumbered by the ghost at the feast, Mr. Teece trod tne boards independently and trod them welL He discovered a considerable amount of histrionic ability and a nice ear for that rhythm, an idea of which it is so difficult for even the best lexicographers to convey. Perhaps about. the true way of getting at it would be to borrow from our American Cousin and say he made his selections ' hum.' His best effort was Marc Anthony's famous oration over Caesar's dead body, as given by Shakespeare. Here he admirably illustrated (as Shakespeare evidently intended) the wonderful power of eloquence in overcoming human passion, and 'insinuating him self .into the hearts of a hostile Eoman crowd, which might by one awkward expression be instantly moved to tear the orator to pieces. Mr. Teece was very good in ' The Charge of the Light Brigade.' For this he -was loudly cheered; but that was a foregone conclusion. Though quite unworthy of the poet laureate in his best days, the uneven jingle always ' catches ' or ' takes.' Several other items were cleverly and most pleasingly discussed by Mr. Teece, who, it is hoped, will in the future be not unfrequently found on the stage of the School of Arts.
