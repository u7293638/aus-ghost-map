I'HE EVIDENCE FOB GHOSTS Mr Andrew Lang in an article in the "Nineteenth Century," entitled " Ghost Stories and Beast Stories," points out tliat Mr Itomanes, in dealing with stories of animal intelligence, proceeded on grounds which are identical with those which all intelligent researchers should pursuo in relation to ghost stories:— " But, just as Mr Romanes, after all, did consult and use his popular, unscientific predecessors, so there may, in certain conditions, be profit in the popular or religious collections of ghost-stories. What are tlicso conditions v Simply the same as those laid down by Mr Romanes for his own guidance." The paper is an interesting one, like everything that Mr Lang writes, and it would be difficult to put better than ho has done the popular superstition that psychical phenomena can never occur- because they are unusual and ^outside the range of our own ex perience:—"We considur it infinitely more probable that gentlemen of trained and acknowledged powers in scientific observation, and of uncontested honor, should lie publicly, frequently, aud con sistently, or should have beeu gulled into perilling their reputation for com mon sanity and honesty, in defence of a fable or of a delusion, than they should., liavo enjoyed an experience so very un familiar." Mr Cleaver in the following article quotes a letter from Sir Walter Scott, written in his old ago, in which he says that he does not believe in ghosts, but is very sorry t hat he lias lost the faculty :—•' I cannot say that. I am a be liever in the return of departed spirits, but T heartily regret the days when I did entertain that very interesting opinion. The great moral argument against their existence is that, in propor tion as incredulity on this point increases, instances of supernatural appearances decrease, and, in other words, ghosts arc only seen when they are believed. But whether reconcilable to the understand ing or not, they are most interesting to the imagination, and T shall always remember with pain tho loss of the sensation."
