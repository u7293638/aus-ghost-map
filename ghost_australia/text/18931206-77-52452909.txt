F. Macdonald J.P., at Yaamba, on thc 28th of November, was coucluded before Captain Bennett J. P., at thc Court-house yesterday afternoon. Thc evidence fully confirmed what had been previously published, namely that the deceased, who was about seventy-five years of age, was a hawker, and travelled on foot, and that his dead body was found in the river at Yaamba on Friday, 13th October, and had evidently then been in the water some time. The only witness examined yesterday was William George Lyttle, who deposed that deceased called at his father's selection, about seven miles from Yaamba, and asked where he could camp, and that he (witness) directed him to an empty house about a mile and a-half away ; he never saw deceased alive again. This concluded the inquiry, and the depositions will be forwarded to Brisbane in due coarse. ____________________________________ " Amongst ourselves," says the Melbourne Argus, in the course of an article on Frene! Ministries, "South Australian Cabinets offer perhaps, the most striking example of tendel and transitory existence. The sister colon] . is young ; but the procession of its Cabinets for length, speed, and geneial tenuity, rc sembles nothing so much as a procession ol ghosts. There is more than one example in South Australian history of a Ministry whick has been boru, bas reached its lusty prime, has sunk into dotage and second childhood, and perished of mere senility ; and all in the compass ol three weeks ! One Ministry, in deed, is on record which lasted eleven days, another ten days, sud yet another nine days '. One Sonth Australian Cabinet is known tc fame us "the clean-shirt Ministry," and tradition-perhaps with that cconony of troth usual in traditions-reports that this title is due to thc circumstance that the proud and happy Premier who had taken office went home to do honour to his new dignity by putting on a clean shirt, and when he re- turned to the House found himself in a minority, and had to officially expire !" ____________________________________ For several years past, says the Sydney Morning Herald of the 29th of November, the Queensland Meteorologist (Mr. Clement Wragge) has exercised a well-recognised influence over the weather on the eastern seaboard of Australia. His storm prognosti- cations have been looked upon as reliable, if not infallible, and it is therefore interesting to learn that he has extended his sphere of operations to New Caledonia, from whence he hopes to ghrctn many useful forecasts. Mr. Wragge, on his way back to Brisbane, arrived in Sydney by the Tanais on Sunday night, and yesterday be spent a great portion of his time discussing weather problems with our own astronomer-and meteorologist. Mr. Russell. Sneaking of his reception in New Caledonia, Mr. Wragge has nothing but praise to bestow on the French authorities. From the Governor downwards they one and all received him with the utmost courtesy, and thus he was enabled, during a brief stay of five weeks, to arrange for the establishment of two observing stations, at opposite ends of the island. One of these is at the Military Hospital in Noumea, and the other at Gomen, Ute terminus of the newly laid cable. From thew two points, wind, weather, and temperature records will be transmitted twice daily to Brisbane, and Mr. Wragge will thus be enabled to accurately locate any cyclonic disturbances which may he traversing the Pacific io thc direction of Australia. As the majority of storms, during the hurricane months between January und March, approach from the N.E., Borne indi- cation of their passage must be shown on Ute recording instrumenta at Noumea or Gomen, and Mr. Wragge is sanguine that, itt thc future, thanks to these new sources of tele- graphic information, he will be able to forecast accurately at least 95 per cent of the storms which visit Australia. Hitherto his record has only been 85 per cent, so that thc gain is obvious. -It may be mentioned that the Telegraph Company has mode arrangements to transmit all the messages required free of cost, and in return for thc courtesy of tho New Caledonian authorities, Mr. Wragge hos promised to wine a daily supply of weather to the citizens of Noumea. That is to say, he will telegraph from Brisbane every morning, forecasting thu weather in New Caledonia for the following day. ____________________________________ At the Police. Court yesterday, before Messrs. W. Henchman (chairman), and T. Kelly, JJ.P., Bob Pluto, an ex-black tracker, was charged with having been illegally on the premises of Miss Cargill, Quay-street, on Sunday morning last, for an unlawful purpose. Pluto said that he was on the premises. He had been in town, and some fellows shouted for him and he got drunk, and wandered about. He got very stiff, and put his boots ever the fence, and got into the yard, and ofter that he did not know what happened. He was.drunk at the time. Sub-inspector Dillon said that Mr. Cargill, Miss Cargill's brother, was about to put out the light, but hearing a noise outside, he went out to see what it was, as the house had been broken into before. When Mr. Cargill got outside he saw somebody running away, and found a hat on the tank, and a coat near the gate. The man could not have been drunk, as it would be impossible for a drunken man to get out of the yard as quickly as this man did. Accused had been in the police as a tracker, and was in it until he was arrested, and then he was discharged. He had known accused for some time out west, and he had not a very good character. After a short conversation with his colleague, thc chairman said that accused would have to go to prison for a month. Bridget Mahoney was charged with having made use of certain indecent language to one Kate Cosstick, in East-lane, on the 29th of November last. There was no appearance of the defendant. The Chairman said that no doubt the defendant did not understand the summons, and the Bench would adjourn the case till Wednesday. William Robinson was charged by his wife, Martha Robinson, with having, on the 25th of November, made use of the threat "I could kill you, and would not be responsible," and then threw a lighted lamp at her, and assaulted and beat her. Martha Robinson, wife of the defendant, and living in Quay- street, said that on Saturday night, the 25th of November, her husband said he could kill her and would not be responsible ; he threw a lighted lamp at her, and she was afraid he would do her some bodily injury, and prayed that he might be bound over to keep the peace ; he caught witness by the hair, and threw her against the wall ; he worked in the freezing-room at Lake's Creek Works. The defendant on being asked what he had to say, said that he did get a bit excited over a letter which his wife received from Brisbane, but as to throwing a lighted lamp at her, emphatically denied it. He had supported his wife to the best, of his ability, and had lived peaceably until that night, and he did not think their little quarrel necessitated the taking out of a summons against him, The Chairman said that, the Bench thought that the best thing they could do would be to settle the matter amongst themselves, and dismissed the case. ____________________________________ Owing to the unavoidable absence of the Lands Commissioner, the monthly sitting of thc Land Court, which should be held to-day, has been postponed until to-morrow. _____________________________________ Mr. P. W. Walker, photographer, East street, has prepared a number of Christmas cards particularly suitable for sending to friends at a distance. On a card of ordinary cabinet size he has arranged seven or eight views of Rockhampton and district, all wonderfully clear and beautifully finished. The cards have tho customary Christmas or New Year greeting at the foot, and arc suffi- ciently varied so that on one or other almost any public building in town will be found.
