THE Williamstown Amateus 'Drama ti.

The policy of the management is that everything 'connected with their performances shall ti; 'as far as possible, essentially local, and they have been so far successful that we are ablo to announce that the ladies and gentlemen who will make their debut are local; the orchestra will be composed of nine local gentlemen and will consist of four violins, a basso, l clarionet, cornet, picolo and kettledrum. While the sceniery will be painted by two local artists and will, from Sthe'spoaimpens we have had the pleasure of seeing, cerEainly be one of the fea tures of the eaitbraizien?p. Having been favoured with an inyite to 'e present as a jhealsal we are able to give a slight sket~k.of tJo chamcters 'in the piece to be produced. pleptions i by the orchestra will precede the rais ing of the handsome drop sceno which has been obtained by the committee of the Institute, and which represents the embarkation ofAnthony and Cleopatra.

The leading olmratcr of tde piece i Old Phil, a porter to Ir Inardress, has L been entrusted to Mr H. ?, Sutton, and froun experience he maybe expected to do A the chat acterjustice. Frank, Old Phil's Si son, a clerk in the office of MrHardress, ti and the hero of the piece, will receive an intelligent rendering at Mr R. Tope's hands. The part of the servant has been B allotted to Mr E. Sivindells.
