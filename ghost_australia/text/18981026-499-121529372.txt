SAIMNG. (By, 'WBATHBR-BYB.') As matters turned- out, on 'Saturday 'the short race for all yachts/; with', which tho ? Prince Alfred- Yacht Club commenced ;lts racing season, justaboiitVfllled ,tho -bill, as the breeze which came from; the nor'nor' east wasr much too light to ; pormlt of ; a longer coiir3e being snllod -under' cruising rig: in tlmo to enrry out tho. remainder of the day's programme,' which consisted: of u rendozvous : in'VRosa:'.:Bay, an i' ihvltatibri aboard Coramodbro Hordorh's steam-yacht Brpnzewiug, and tho gottlrig through with several ;ro\ving',i)yontiir.' ': !??;'', : ' : ?; Five yachts lined up for; the : 'all-yachts' roco, viz., Jess , (Mi'. A. A: Griffiths) ; scratch, Isea (Mr. W. M; Marks) , scratch, Herres-,-. hoff (Mr. James Cox)'3min, Sapphire (Mr. H; A.-.Jones). ?lmih, arid! .Lahloq (Mr.1: W; H. MurrolD'Smin..'.' , The iwlrid -proved much too feeble; to- permit of 'anything like, a racing-tost, and those carrying scanty sails hadn't a ghost of a chance. Jess' owner evidently foresaw this, /as his vessel' camn to tho scratch vwlth -an jeiiormous' jack-: ynrder aloft, arid as a consequence the ex cruiser was '? easily a'blo tpget Ihe' llnii' first. After deducting time allowances; she had over a mlniitoto spare froin Her reshoff, and 4min '12sbb from Isqa. '-?'; By. the way; Jcss: is hbiv yawl riggedj and from what.I hoar Mr. Griffiths intends, to stick to that rig throughout the season. ? - ?'? . ? Iscd claimed a' good deal of attention, as It was her first appearahco out since tlio alleged improvements she has undergone ;' but, Judging from her performance on Sat-, urday, she wou i. have dono better to have remained a3 she was. One thing is cer tain, and that is, that In the endeavor to lmprovo her speed, hor appoaranco has been completely sacrificed. : On Saturday sho led -HcrreshoII to the Lightship, but In the run to Rose Bay Mr.' Cox's 5-rater wore her down, and finished 35sec ahead of hor. Taking into consideration -tho . fact that Herreshoff - is by ' no meanB a light--veather craft, Isea may be said to have been badly beaten. Mr. Marks certainly desbrvqd bet ter luck with his costly little yacht, as ho has spent ho end of money on her, and 1, for ono, would like to see him well re warded for his enterprise. .', . Compared tb' the performances 'of-'Iseii, ' Sapphire, and Lahloo, Herroshoff sailed a very meritorious race. No doubt sho will play' a prominent part in this, seasohls rac ing. Sapphiro's'owuei evidently saw little glory in sailing out d foregone conclusion, and, consequently, retired on tho beat to the Lightship, leaving Lahloo to do tho whipping up. At Uie finish the latter showed herself to bo a long way out of tho hunt by bclnglomln 35soc behind Isea; That a very pleasant time ' whs spent aboard the Commodore's ship, of course goes without saying, while the several rowing races on tho card lent additional interest to the proceedings/ The buccsst ful competitors-, in these; events 'Were Messrs. W. Simpson aud S. Stevens, while the race : for yachts' hands was won by Fay, of Isea. ;.. ''.?'? \\-r\ ? ? ,:t ??' .;: : Tlie' all-boats' handicap of the John-' stone's Bay Chib on Saturday attracted an entry of eight boats. Those, together with their handicaps, included .:' Plover,: 22ft (Fred Doran), and Bffle, 22ft (N. Johnson), scratch; Vigilant, 22ft (W.

With only the prospect of a light wind this looked the best of good, things for th'j light-weather crack, Stella II.| and at the outset the little lS-footer certainly Justified the opinion. Getting away fast from her fellow-mark boats, Stella was soon at tho head of affairs, and at the LlghtBlilp she had a lead of Umin 4isec from Plover? At this time it. looked any odds on the 'eigh- teen's' chance of winning, and no doubt she would have dono so had' the wind held true, but in veering round to the 'eastward it meant a dead run home, in which case Plover's great spinnaker would tell before the wind, and once sufficiently near enough .'In.1- take her, small rival's wind, it meant gbqd-byo to 'tho latter.; However, notwith standing -this,. Stella keptr.nhead'In magni ficent style, and-lt' wa3 not until she had Dawes Point abeam that her formidable opponent became really dangerous^. Now the fun started, Ellis watching his oppo nent for all he was worth, .first lufllng, and' then as Dorau' kept away, checking his own boat. ?. But just ueforo the goal was reached tho big boat got an overlap, and; ultliqugh the vete.ran Ellis fought the affair out to the bitter end, bolng almost abreast of the -22rfooter at the finish, the verdict was' Plover. ;'?:.??]'??? :-;:; I,. ?..'.: -.-,.:;?;'..- In such close quarters the big boat. had the-pull over her little rival, and she woll merited her win, for, in setting her extras, her crow had 'worked -none too well, 'a fact which might. have- lost: her. the race. Mr. Hordorn is to bo congratulated on possess ing so veritable a'-flyer.-' Both on and off Iho wind she got away from 131llo on Satur day, being Omin I7sec ahead of her at the Lightship,- uud exactly Smin at the finish. The light air did not seem to improve Knle's chance at nil. ; It' seemed odd to sec last season's .champion so far behind. It- was almost a struggle for her to' best Australian for third place, but this shn eventually did by USscc. For tho sake of comparison r append the finishing times : Plover Gh 2m Ills, Stella Oh 2m 2-ls, BHle Ch 10m Ills, Australian Gh 10m -17s, Victor Ch Urn 38s, Vigilant GhllTm 5s', and Kyeowa Oh 23m itis. Tlmlla retired on the boat down to the Lightship. A largo fleet of dingles turned out for the 10-1'ooters' race, which was also sailed under '''the' flag of, the. Johnstonejs Bay Club. The little racers mado a, fairly good riuitch of It down to Shark Island, with the tide In their fuvo.r,. but owing to the light draught on the run home they got very wide spread, Olga (W. Holmes) having at Ihe finish over lGmln to spare ..from.' her nearest attendant, Crescent (C. Dunn), which was aomc Einln ahead of Venlta (A. S. Andrews), while the others wore so far behind that they wore not timed. As, i3 generally the case- whenever a big crowd turn out tbwltncsc an Important race, It is sure to ba pronounced in argument,.. if in iiolhing else. .'In' this, respect tho crowd at. tlie, (ill-boats' race .of tho J.B.S.C. oil Saturday was no exception. .? ?'From- start' to finish tho 'know-alls' kept up a ,con llnual warfare of diverse opinion. One gentleman cxprcÂ£3cd himself, from tho fore part of tho Greyhound, ns being -', quite' of opinion Hint it .wns'.u matter, of -' Impossi- bility'- to;-run a nulling boat 'stifCV unob served.';.- Ho win a man of experience, too; had. called in both 15 -and 22 footers, and had never discovered how it was possible to, lmpodo a ,boat s progress .through, tho \vater without discovery. A woiild-bb op pccitloniat suggested a bag. under the cut wutor, whllo somcono In. the background mildly suggested the towing of a keroscuc tin 'ovorboard, and a third man thoiiglu that It might bo posslbloto halt-fill a boiif with water without detection. Ono amusing iiiciclont ..during the race was tho .offer': of a woiild-bo speculator ti. take; odds of throe shilling!! to ono about Stella's chance* of winning. ? At tho tlmo the lS-footcr had n lead ,of about 7mln from Plover, hut as the proposer, .evidently a good judge of a sail ing racq, observed: 'It was only for the srikn of ihavlng a: little: iritorest In tho nffair.' ( A' layer wao found, But then came the trouble of finding a stakeholder. Tub layer of odds suggested a friend of his, to which the would- be speculator replied: '-1 havori't just arrived from Ireland,'/ old. mnn.' Mr. Mark Foy's catamaran was again tho subject, of comment at a recent meeting of the Sydney Flying Squadron, when It was finally decided, on tho casting vote of the chairman, not to allow the double boat, or tho 'freak,' as Iho Americans would call her, lo compete in scratch races. As an outcome'of'thts decision, I understand thai Flying Flsh'wlll not race this ocaaon. This Is a pity, a's, apart from tho 'FlBh's' me-' rlts, ns a /racer, tho ' remarkable ..acrobatic teats she' Is so prone to indulge in -when racing will undoubtedly bo mls30d by thu aquatic public. It is rumored in Now York that Defen der, which sailed against Valkyrie III., In to bo ro-bullt.as a trial yacht for tho now defender ot'tho America Cup. During tho English yachting season thorp was some keen racing among Iho smaller classes round about tho Islo of Wight and ;Southnmpton, but tho prizes wero not vory oqunllv divided, i In tho 30ft class, Carol (owned by Mr. 'Newton-Robinson, Mr. , Wyndhnm Cook, and Mr. G.
