A GHOST AT ALDERSHOT. The Loudon Times has a ghost story. For a month the camp of Aldershot was visited nightly by an aggressive spirit. It was no respecter of 'persons or rank, it pummelled haughty officers in the ribs, and gave humble privates black eyes. A private of the 10th saw it one night, aud was abashed. It was midnight, and the sentry prceiving something advancing to ward him gave the usual challenge, to which no reply was made. The challenge was repeated, whereupon tho ghost went to the sentry-box, slapped the soldier several times in the face, and before he could recover from his confusion made off across the common with astonishing bounds. The ' soldier, in his excitement, loaded bis rifle and fired, but missed his aim. The ghost went toward the Military Cemetery, and in a similar manner attempted to frighten a private in the 100th Regiment, who was on guard by a powder magazine. Again was a gun fired, and again did the ghost stalk off unharmed. A fort night afterward the ghost pounced upon another soldier and endeavoured to snatch away his rifle; A sharp struggle ensued, -which ended hy the soldier receiving a pair of black eyes and losing his shako, which was fourid next morning in the canal. Another sentry was accosted in the camp by some ono with a mask, who informed him that he was the much- dreaded ghost, and his object was to show the nation how easily he could frighten the soldiers of the present day,
