The Ghost. A Noval entertainment is to be presented to the public of this city, this evening, at the Pr.tea tant Hall, vie., IMr. J. H. Rainford's " Goost." We are informed that this "' Ghost"isquite equal, as an entertainer, to the one at present ex hibiting in Sydney, which has had, and is still having, such an extraordinary amount of patron age awarded to it. There is no doubt that the mysterious fascination attaching to all incorporeal bodies will exert a powerful influence on the public in this instance-and a large attendance at the hall he the result.
