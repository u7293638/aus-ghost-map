Sweet Ghusts. One house was closed for three years while we were in Europe: and son after our return, last June, we began to hear mysterious noises. The house was hip-roofed, and the chambers were low, with sloping ceilings. It was in the chambers that we heard the noises. The sounds varied. Sometimes we heard a low, heavy rumbling like dis tant thunder; at other times we heard; or seemed to hear, broken murmurs; like hoarse voices in conversation; but usually the noise suggested distant whispering and groanings. We are not superstitious, but it was not pleasant to hsve such things going on in the house. For !our weeks-we sought vainly for an explanation of the mystery. Rats and mice never made such noises, nor bats nor birds. So far as we could think, nothing that flien, nothing that runs, could produce such sounds as came from our haunted chambers. We had many curious visitors, but pretty soon some of our more ignorant neijhbors began to shun the house. The whole affair was greatly exaggerated. of course, and disagreeable rumors were speedily noised about. This had been going on for about four weeks when father came into the house one morning in a state of evident excite ment. "Well, I've solved the mistery!" he exclaimed. "It's bees!" '"Bees!" we cried; "what do you mean?" "I've seen a thousand bees, at loist. going out and in at that small holo in the gable roof," lie said. "They've swarmed there, and that explains the whole thing." We laughed at the idea; but father called a carpenter and had the small hole enlarged. The inside of the roof was found to be one immense bee- hive. Over fifty pounds of delicious honey were taken out, and with the removal of the bees the mysterious sounds cgme to an end.
