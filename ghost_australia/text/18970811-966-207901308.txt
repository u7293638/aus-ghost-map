You forget that I have been ill.-and -still am very far from well, and that the topic • is hardly.one which is likely to appeal to an invalid's brain.' I think I'll have a little ^whisky, Lucy." I bad a little whisky. In fact, I bad a tamsh quantity. I had to, since I had to bear the burden of Keeley's conversation. iTKat particul ar topic seemed to be the only -One he- had inside his head. He harked back to "it "nearly every time he opened his mouth Had Z not known the man I should have concluded that he was doing it out of sheer malignancy ; but. I did know him—I knew that be was thickheaded. Lucy was not of the slightest use She went on sewing in silence as if all subjects were indifferent to her. •-{-.was gl&d; when. Ke«ley rose^to go. I went with him to the front door to see bim off the premises.' Afterhe had gone I remained standing.on the steps to get a mouthful of fresh air.—It was a dark night; there was no wind, aed^ttjere jfeas a^uspicion of a fog in the air. \- jl-wae itanding-on toe bottom eten hut one. The nearest lamp-post was some distance down the road. What with the darkness and the mist I could not see any of the hall-doors on the other side of the street. It was very quiet; there was not a sound of footsteps nor of any sort of traffic. - _ Suddenly, while I was thinking of nothing in. ) particular except that Keeley had been making rather a greater ass of himself than he generally did, I saw something begin to shape itself in the air in front of me. It did not come all at once, but by degrees. First a dim outline, then feature after feature until the whole was there. It began to take thei shape of a face. It was a face—a woman's face—her face —Ellen Howtifs. For the second time it had come to me, unwatched for, undreamed of, unawares, a visitant from the dead—come to me with its awful staring eyes. There could be no question this time about my having drunk too mucn. I was as sober as I ever was in my life. I can give no adequate oonception of the .horror with which I realized that this was so, and that the face was there. It came slowly, towards me. The idea ot a closer contact was more than I could endure. At it advanced I retreated backwards up the steps. Still the face came on. I got into the house and banged the door, as it seemed to mc just in time to shut it out. I staggered agaiust the wall. Lucy, came to me as I stood there trembling. " I was coming to tell you to come in. You will catch a cold." Then, perceiving my state of agitation,Tom! What is the matter?" "Lucy, I have seen a ghost." "A ghost?"- • "As I live and • breathe, I have seen a ghost. Oh, my God 1" "Tom!" " This is the second time I have seen it. I have a premonition that the third time will mean death." There came a .knocking at the door. Lucy looked at me. - "It is Mr. Keeley back again. The servants bave gone to bed. I will open and see." It was not Keeley. It was a ehort, broadly built man, -with a-btishy beard. - Other men were with him. though" I could. only just see them standing in . the shadow at the foot of the steps. The bearded man addreesed himself to me— " Are you Thomas Tennant?" " That is my name." "I am a detective. You are'my prisoner. I r arrest you for wilful murder." Then I saw that the men who had been standing at the foot of the steps, and who now, uninvited, were entering the house, were constables. ( To be continued to-morrow.)
