Queer Freak of a Cyclist Tits other night (says the Melbourne Leader) a Cyclist who had a great idea of winning the 10- guinea trophy offered to the rider of the best illu minated bicycle in a certain lantern parade, smeared his bicycle all ovey with phosphorus and then rode it down a street to see how it looked. The nitrht wan dark, and the effect very strange. The whole machine glowed fervidly as it moved noiselessly along the quiet road. Presently a horse and trap approached. The animal sniffed and snorted thrice, violently plunged, turned round and rushed off in the direction it had come. At the same time two young girls who were standing at a garden gate shrieked and rushed inside, tel ling their father they had seen a ghost. " Non sense, girls," said the father, an old Cornish far mer, as he picked up a cudgel, and with a remark that he'd settle the ghost, he walked down the garden and through the gate, intending to cross the road and take up his stand behind a tree. When half-way across lie glanced up the road, and his hair fairly stood on end, and his blood curdled, for there, not 20 yards away, was the white appari tion speedily approaching. A moment later the wheel of the bicycle struck him on the bridge of the nose, while the cyclist tumbled headlong to the ground. The old man shrieked, the girls rushed out in hysterics, and the wheelman picked himself up, apologised, and jnst got away as two policemen arrived on the scene.
