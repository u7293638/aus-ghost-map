' PORT JACKSON SAILING CLUB. The rough weather of Satnrday to some extent militated against the success of the third handicap of tbe season sailed under the aus pices of tbe Port JackBon Sailing Club. There was a strong norm-westerly wind blowing, which rendered the water moro than lumpy, and in consequence of thio the committee wisely decided to alter the coarse from tho Manly course to one from Woolloomooloo to tbe Sow and Pigs and back. Sixteen boats were entered, but of these only seven ventured out and faced the weather. These were Our Tom, 5min. ; Wild Wave, 6min.; Isadore, 6iniii. ; Scylla, omin.; Ghost, Omin. ; Mantura, scratch ; Craigiolce, scratch. As soon as the sigual for a start was made the Man tura went to the fore, with Our Tom, Ghost and Craigielee nort in the order named, the Isadore being some distance in tne rear. Not mnch sail was carried, the boats all being close-reeled, excepting tho Craigielee and Our Tom. The Craigielee, as far as could be seen from the steamer, was the first round Shark Island, but foiled to weather the fierce gale und had to give in, and her place was taken by the Mantnra. There were several capsizes, and one after another the yachts gave up until only two, the Mantnra' and the Isadore, were left in it. A pretty and well contested raco eosued between these, both the boats being admirably handled and sailing gallantly thtough the rough water. Tho Mantura passed tho winning boat only 32sec. in advance of the Isadore, which, however, takes first prize on ber time allowance by 4mio. 28sec. A protest was lodged ngaiuat the wiuner for carrying a wrong jib.
