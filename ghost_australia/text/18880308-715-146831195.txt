After enpper I refreshed my memory by a look at the pictures of the missing young ladies, including that of Miss Amy Holmes, and then I set ont lor the Little Adelphi. There was never an easier bit of work than this New Orleans business. The curtain went up on a " Minstrel first part," and there, sitting next to one of the "end men " was Mamie Butger. Her early hair was stack full of roses. She, wore a very short pink satin drees and her little feet were conBpicuoas in white kid slippers. If MisB Mamie were forcibly abducted, she has wasted no time in grieving over it. If she has been in any manner deceived or de luded, she heats it wonderfnlly well. She sang, her ballad with evident enjoy ment, and her voice rang ont in thechornses,' clear and sweet, Her lips Were wreathed in •smiles, her cheeks glowed, and her eyes sparkled. Occasionally she turned her head to whisper to the blacked-up scamp, who sat at'her right hand. Altogether she deported herself .with the confidence of an old habitue of the stage. Evidently she had made herself popular with Little Adelphi audiences, and certainly she enjoyed her popularity. After the first part I watched the stage impatiently, it being too early to venture into the green-room. Mamie Batger did not re-appear, but, alter an hour, occupied principally by "burnt cork artiste," Miss Lotta Le Clair," the song and dance Queen," came tripping from the wings; and Miss Lotta La Clair, in a blue velvet coat and yellow satin nether garments, was none other than Amy Holmes. She danced very well, and sang very ill; and I fancied that she had tasted too often of the cheap wine dealt out behind the bar. Yery soon after her exit, I made my way to the green-room, piloted by the head waiter. I had, of oourse, got myself up for the occasion, and I looked like a cross between a last year's fashion-plate and a Bowery black leg., It is always easy to mate a variety actress 4a$k; and those at the; Little- Adelphi, proved uao&luidrattidQo;^imi^iMdBl^Mws'everal oI itbeafftd^hiaihdJht^J Hfcjftnedj tfmV Amy!

" How would yon like to go baok to Amora, Miss Holmes ? Or to Groveland and the widow Ballou's?" She sprang np with her eyes flashing, and made a sudden dash for the door, Of course it resisted her effort to open it. " Open that door," she said, turning upon me a look of angry defiuance " You are either a fool or a meddler. Open the door." I laid one hand eomewhat heavily npon her shoulder, and led her back to the seat she had just vacated'. "Possibly I may be both fool and meddler," I replied, in s tone so stern that it seemed to arrest her attention, and impress her with the fact that 1 was neither trifling nor to b8 trifled with. "" But I am something else, and I know moreofyou, my young lady, and of year past career than you would care to have me know. Perhaps yon "may never have heard of Michael Games, the detective, but their are other's who have made his acquaintance." Now all this was random firing, but I acted on the knowledge that nine-tenths of the women who are professional adventurers, have in their past something either criminal or disgraceful to conceal, and on the possi bility that Miss Amy Holmes migbt not be long to the exceptional few. The shot told. 1 saw it in the sadden blanching of her cheek, in the startled look that meet mine for just an instant. If there were nothing else to conceal, I think she would have defied me and flouted at my efforts to extracts information on the subject of the Groveland mystery. But I had touched at a more vulnerable point. If I could now convince her that I knew her past career, the rest would be easy. It was a delicate undertaking. I might say too much or too little, but I must press the advantage I had gained. Her attention was secured. Her curiosity was aroused. There was a shade of anxiety on her face. Drawing a chair opposite her, and seat ing myself therein, I fixed my eyes upon her face, and addressed her in a tone half stern, half confidential: " You are a plucky girl, 1 began, " and I admire yon for that; and when I tell yon that I have followed you, or tracked you from the loonjEChireothat Ldobipf; intend tq be ba^gdj or evaded;} &en; j3y;eqgmarit a little .lja^-^B., you have-proved jourself.
