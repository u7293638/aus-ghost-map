. HOBSON JOBSON. -. .? LECTURE BY PROFESSOR MORRIS. The Hobson about whom I propose to speak to You is not the famous Cambridge carrier, on whom Milton when a young man wrote two poems Yet this man deserves mention with credit amongst University men, for by his benefaction Cambridge has the conduct of clear water running through its streets His for time he gained partly by a weekly journey from Cambridge to Bishopsgate in London, partly by being the first in England to lot out horses on hire And as it was his whim that each customer had to take the horse highest the door, or go without, this carrier has enriched our language with the useful phrase "Hobsons choice Nor is the Hobson about whom I wish to speak the gallant Captain R N of His M S Rattlesnake, who surveyed our shores and gave his name to Hobson's Bay, are too, descry 68 to be well remembered in Australasian history, for he was afterwards the first Governor of New Zealand The real name of my hero was ITosein, and he was the son of A and Fatima, favourite daughter of the prophet Muhammad (or shall I call him Mahomet ') Ali, the son-in-law of the prophet, was pushed aside from the succession by three caliphs in turn , but there is a great split in the Mahommedan world between the bin ites, who maintain that All was the first law ful caliph, and the Sonnets, who support the interloping three It is an old story, but perhaps other worlds besides the Mahommedan am sometimes split into bitter factions about matters which are not exactly of modem importance The story of the death of Hosem has been related by two masters of our language Hear with me a moment whilst I read a long but interesting extract from Gibbon's famous chapter L - ' ' ' JILL' ' ' ' Alone, vi enry arid Roubulla!"

Sometimes those who have contended against these corruptions of. words have exhibited " an excess of zeal, A cer- trains chief '. of words has the r terminal-', tion' ''and'." denoting qualities more or less unsatisfactory-for instance,'"laugnrd, sluggard, and dotard. Zealots have desired to include . blackguard in this list, but averagely. The history of ""blackguard is known. -" In old times," says Trench, " the palaces of our kings and seats of our nobles were more rudely and more scantily furnished than at the present day; and thus it was customary, when a royal progress was making or when the great nobility exchanged one residence for another, that at such a removal nil kitchen utensils, pots and pans, and even costs, should be also carried with them where they went. The scullions and other meaner retainers, who rode amongst these, and were started by them, were con- temptuously styled the black guard ; ' then any troop or company of ragamuffins and lastly, when the world's history was obscured and men forgot that it properly belonged to a company, to a rubble road, and not to a single person, one would compliment another, not as belonging to, but as himself being a bundle guard.' " The zealots may do what they will with the black guard, but they must not lay finger on sweetheart. "Why should they maintain that this, too, has the art, the and the unpleasant termination Ï Fortunately Chaucer makes Creseide call Troilus her dere horse" and her sweet here" within three lines. Lastly, beefeater has been forced into buffeting, sideboard man, a word of which no instance is found. Skeat says the simple derivation beef and cat is too simple for most people. We must not think that it is in our own language alone that these tricks are played. The law is true of every language, though of some more true than of others. Perhaps the Greeks, who called all. non-Greeks barbarians, have been the most imperious. You, however, would hardly thank me for a series of illustrations from other and ancient' languages. Incidentally I have, quoted some, especially from the French, " In modern times the French language , takes , the. place of the Greek, making others bend in true lordly fnBllion. ' Here are two quite . modern -instances, which are not in the books. I quote them on the authority of Monsieur Beljume, professor of English at the Sorbonne, who of all French pro- fessors, perhaps of all Frenchmen, knows most of our tongue. In 1883 I saw him in Paris midst the materials of his great French English dictionary, which is not yet finished. We talked of this law, and he told me that the French for buckwheat was beau caste, and for Aunt Sally she said. Perhaps you are thinking what a rigmarole all about mere rickshaws of speech, there odds and ends. Stop I Rigmarole is raging roll, and ragman meant the devil ; and rickshaws in the French queUjue chose, which sometimes took the form kick-shoes, and then the sailor added " buckles and all." Odds and ends were odds and ends, or points and ends, f.e.^s'crapa. But end is very suggestive. I take the hint.
