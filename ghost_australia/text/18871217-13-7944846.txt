The eating and drinking needing this explanation comes at noon and eventide Early in the morning I need no explanation anent the cup of coffee and roll then tendered to everybody, the which is supposed to support nature until noontime. It is not on original observation which I so make of the interest taken in the speechless foreigner. The old Abyssinian traveller, Bruce, had similar experience, He tells us how the pitying native women showed their sympathy with him in that he had no wife to tend his wants, no wife to grind his corn" bruce makes two Thy ming lines of what these Eastern women thus crossed over him Had they been Mahomedan women, however, they could only have looked upon him with faces covered up to the eyes, and then only when their eunuch keeper was not watching them We have I find next day, Scottish sheep farmer on board, whom sea troubles had the day before kept below. When he finds that I am From Australia-a fact which he very soon does know-he becomes quite in terested His Sheep and his wool have lately troubled him greatly, though not from drought. He only gets half the price for his wool and mutton which he did awhile ago To my surprise he condemns Australia in strong language for an spoiling his market I hasten to undeceive him, and tell him that Australian wool and mutton growers are suffering, similarly with himself, from fall in prices, and much more so from other causes He learns now what drought really is to the squatter, and how the rabbit comes as a curse when and where the drought comes not I get him to look at the matter philosophically and to include the River Plate audits adjacent plains in his causes for complaint, as likewise in his profanity). I can bear to hear him swear at South America To my surprise he uses strong language also about England's Government and Mr Gladstone language which I am glad the four ladies in the curtained harem adjacent cannot under , stand, so very strong is it Up from that " seclusion which the cabin grants," and of which Sir Joseph Porter sings, comes also a British sailors who has been doing an Egyptian tour for the English winter time. The Scotch squatter has sent his family home from Egypt, and is returning by way of Constantinople, us is also this youthful aristocrat Neither of them can understand what an Australian like myself wants to go to Greece for I might as well, the) say, goto Syria and Palestine "there is nothing to see there, and no life, is the way they reckon it up "And no money to be made, either, in the way of business," adds the practical Scotchman. As an afterthought he adds to this, us a good Presbyterian, "maybe you are a missionary), or take an interest in missions'' That a body can go see such an old fashioned and profitless land as is this Greece is quite beyond comprehen- sion by these two citizens of the world, whom it was possible to pity without despising When I pointed out Sabbath desecration to a Scotchman in Alexandria he shunted the subject is so) ing, " The pair bodies just ken nee better about it " Towards noon of the second day from shore there comes up, to be laid aside for airing on deck, the phenomenal sight of a sea sick Dutchman. Nature has provided Hollanders with just the strongest stomachs of the world. There are reasons various for this wise provision of nature, but upon which I will not dilate I never before in any of my many sea voyages met with a Dutchman who did not in all weathers come earliest to table, and stay longest there The very sight of his sauerkraut used to turn my stomach, and I hated him for having the good appetite I lacked, Here was an opportunity now for reprisals I asked this poor man whether I should fetch him some sour Front, and if he would like a cigar. He muttered something about "teufel" or "divil," which, though not in good English, was quite com- prehensible. To a sen sick being nothing is more nauseous than the smell of tobacco. Now, a Dutchman smokes the strongest tobacco from early morning to late at night, so that I was, theoretically, desirous of assisting him in my poor sympathetic ways way he did not seem to appreciate. On the evening of the second day out from Alexandria we pass the island of Crete, or Candia as it is now called, and have come among the Ionian Islands The night will keep many of them from New, but there are the more reasons for early rising next morning, of which a pleasant change in the weather is very perceptible. The heat of the past six or seven weeks, since leaving Australia, is over and gone We have now entered upon the climate of Europe and left altogether that of Asia and Africa. The time for Hannels has come again, and the umbrella will be needed for other purposes than that of a sunshade I am endeavouring to make the G reek steward understand that I now want a blanket or two as bed covering the one sheet and thin cove effect which served on Egyptian shores being no longer endurable, There is a good old lady passenger who hears me, and who now find) volunteers to help in explanation to the steward she does not understand that there can be other languages than the English. " You speak too quickly,' slices , these people understand if you speak very slowly) to them ' ' She then proceeds to illustrate her theory, but with no better success than mine "This mon is very stupid I ' she says, in extenuation. It is well known, I believe, that you must shout land to foreigners , but this old lady's idea of the slow and deliberate way of speaking was novel-to say nothing more of it. In cricketing language, it was the slow, under hand way of getting at the wicket, instead of the first overland bowling and high pitching The sun rises brightly at 5 next morning, and I see "The Isles of Greece," as Byron sang of them in the early years of the Twenties. But Byron has taken poetical license in saying that " eternal summer gilds them yet." Aided by a glass we can see a snow-covered rouge of hills, and within an hour the sun has disappeared, the wind is cold, and the rain necessitates overcoat or oilskin, and umbrella, and this, too, in the month of Ma). At least it is the month of life) by the British almanac, and the eighth day of that month. By) the Greek almanac it is, however, the mouth of April, and the 12th only of that month, Greece puts itself twelve (days backwards. I had been putting the watch back half an hour per day on the voyage from Australia to burn, out it was now necessary to go nearly a fortnight back words at a bound to keep level with the dates of things in Greece. It is pleasant to get younger, in this way of putting back the hand of time, and so I do it clad), and hope to feel all the better for it, We now enter among the group of islands called, geographical I), the Cv eludes, most of which have well known and immortal names Here to one side, or the other, are Patmoa, Milo, Samoa, Paros, 1 inos, Cea, Dales, and >,axos-the last b at known for Ariadne s sad tune upon it. The breakfast bell now rings, but the bell may knock its tongue out for rain The glass is glued to one's eyes to see these islands of ancient renown and world some Islands seemingly) to the imagination as of another and a bygone world 'that our Sahara can be allowed to scamper along past such places at the rate of 10 miles an hour or ems as a shameful thing Business has, however, no serious at orsviLpatlij - no feelings further up than the pocket Hence it comes that we are rushed past where we or one of us at least whom I can answer for would fain linger. Those who sneer at wealth might now perceive one value of it. In a yacht of one's own such insult to the feelings could not happen A call could he made an) where and everywhere, and a stay be had there for any time at one's will, nil at the cost of about a hundred per week only for the steam yacht s keep-a paltry hundred a week ' With a turn of the wheel we now flight "sea horse Salamis," and see the rocky brow " which was once upon time the very Lucas) seat of the ancient Xerxes It looks as bare, sterile, and umnhobtted-a fit resort for the tens of thousands upon thousands of the Persian ghosts who must haunt it-the ghostly remains of that wondrous army) and navy whom the Persian monarch brought here to overrun Greece, and saw all pounded up as helpless and defenceless as were the I French on their retreat from MOSCOW, A few more revolutions of the screw and our voyage is ended, and we hear that unpleasant rattling of the anchor chain which so reminds one of that death throat-rattle which ends the voyage of our lives, and brings us all to the lasting anchorage i We drop anchor off Piraeus, the port of Athens. All eyes seem now protruding and some elongating like those of snails, as field glasses are applied to them Landmarks can here and there be discerned, but Athens is yet seven miles inland from Piraeus and what can be seen from here does not contain much to its monuments We are, indeed, nine miles from the capital of Greece, as our anchorage is some two miles from the land- ing place of Piraeus, to which a coin called a " drachma' is asked by the boatmen for our passage But we are shortly welcomed, and that warmly, by some good Greeks, who come swiftly rowing towards us, and board tea in hottest haste No pirates over made greater speed to invade the decks of a rich merchant man What does a body care for relatives when one can find such friends in every port with such airline; fares and honeyed words to woo one to the nice homes they have to offer in their different hotels ! Shenstone was right when he wrote that whoever had travelled live a dull round must confess that lied always found his warmest welcome at an inn lue warm welcome which so inspired the poet is given to one here before the inn is reached One has only to choose to which friend to give the Gladstone bag of the burden of which he is so anxious to relieve one A blood relative would offer only an arm, and leave one to leg along the bug all unhelped I have to thank my stove pipe line for much of the attention I get in this kindly way Such that IS taken to mark Britishers, who are, with the Americans, the best beloved of all travellers Here in Greece it brings around me half a dozen good fellows all speaking in my tongue, or trying their best to do so so much to the good for sticking to one's national costume It was ridiculous to see the English running about in Cairo and Alexandria in that red night cap of thick cloth which Egyptians so much affect, and which is, of all head gear, the most unsuitable to a warm climate 'The stove-pipe hat in light, is also high chambered at the top, and therefore of a ventilating and head cooling character Other nations all the world over are adopting this hat of the Englishman, and he will do well to stick to it as to his country's (lug I say to my new found friends that I want to see the British vice consul hat and fore most of all things, to get my passport noted I had heard of this official when about this part of the world, 10 years back, as being Mr Black, and the husband of that Theresa Maori whom Byron made famous as the " Maid of Athens " Mr. Black and his wife are, I find, long since gone from here Mrs Black to her long home His successor and all the other representatives of European powers have strangely to hear this morning gone from Greece "Gone where'" many voices ask "Gone on board the men of war in the bay here and outside of it ! ' Now that my attention was taken from the land, I noticed that the bay was full of this sort of craft "What's the matter now'" I inquire ignorant of all newspaper news for long time past. " Greece is going to war with Turkey for possession of territory in Albania, promised to be ceded to it at the time of, and by, the Berlin Treaty four or five years back 'the European powers object to Greece going to war for the territory. They say that no time was specified for giving it over, and that Greece ought to wait till she gets it, and not now disturb European peace. Greece won't be lectured, however, and has armed 70,000 soldiers to fight the Turks, and wants to be let alone to do it The European powers are going now to coerce Greece, and as a first step have withdrawn all their representatives from the country ' HUB was nice views to a newcomer, and more disturbing to one by the sight of low voiced little knots of passengers talking here and there about the deck Presently there comes to me squatter and sailors with admonitory looks upon them 'They tell me that many who were about to land have now altered in their intentions and will continue on the voyage to Constantinople "Things look very dangerous here at present I is what they sum up with Things certainly did appear as very unsettled, but I recalled a sa) ing from the old book about those not sowing or reaping who too much regarded threatening clouds. I should have missed much that was worth seeing about the world had I heeded all warnings given to me 111 had taken advice I should not have gone ashore notes as I did at Samarang, and in not doing so should have missed my journey up country and the grand sight of Boer Buddha temple-one of the memorable sights of a lifetime If I missed seeing Greece now the opportunity would not offer again opportunities seldom do so twice in a lifetime The threatened trouble did but bespeaks good things as compensation for it, and nothing of much good is got without trouble It came about, therefore, that I would go, and mainly so, perhaps, in the idea that I be longed to those who proverbially never come to any harm in the world it the Greeks were plucking up a spirit and facing a world in arms, they would he but doing as good patriots had aforetime done, and might have similar success as a reward It would be worth landing, if only to to to Missolonghi, and there endeavour to wake up Byron (if his remains were still there to a sight of the state of affairs to which he was always SO prompting the Greeks.
