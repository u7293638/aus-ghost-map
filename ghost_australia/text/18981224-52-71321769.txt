Day's Work," which is a collection- ef some thirteen stories, there is ode -which '.vividly, recalls the earlier Kipling.'" lt is'-'entitled "The Tomb of -His. Ancestors.". A certain "John- Chinn, subaltern, returns to ? India, where he was born, and joins a native regi ment of Bhils, fierce little tribesmen, ' who knew and worshipped his father and his grandfather. The night of his arrival the) . servant he has brought with him takes to, flight, and then ensues this scene: . ' -.. . ' i Young ^Ohinn, walking like a man In tn dream, had fetched a compass, round the en tire cantonment before going to his tiny cot tage. Tho captain's quarters* in which he had been born, delayed him for a little; then he looked at the well on the .parade. ground where he had sat of evenings with , his nursed and at the ten-by-fourteen .church, where tho officers Avent to service if a chaplain of any, , creed happened to come along. It seemed yery small as compared-" with*the -f.gigantip, '. .buildings he usecl jtó-stare up.'at/ .hat "itÁw^is ; > ? the sanie place.

I "I boro.you in my arms; Sahib,' when I waa a strong man, and you were a small one i crying, crying, crying! I am your servant, - as I was - your father's before you.

Who should know, if I do not knoAV? And so the baby has be come a man, and forgets, his .nurse;'but wy nepheAv shall make a good servant, or I will beat him tAvice a day." ' Then there rose up, with, a.,rattle, -aa straight as a Bhil arroAA', a.little white-haired, wizened ape of a man, Avith medals-and or- . ders on his tunic, stammering, saluting,.and" trembling.

"He has not forgotten. - .lie remembers his own people as Iiis father remembered. Now, can I die. But first I-will? live; and S1IOAV¡ the Sahib IIOAV to kill tigers.
