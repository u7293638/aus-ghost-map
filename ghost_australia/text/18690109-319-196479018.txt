; PRIPIfFT ? ???? ? ? ?* ? ? ? ? .?? CRICKET GOSSIP. ''??;'. By Bat. ; 'The long talked-of meeting of. nomineeg chosen by the various clubs for the eleotion of a fresh match committee to chooso the teams for the intercolonial matches came off on Monday last in the M.C.C. Pavilion, and re sulted in the election of Messrs Cameron, WardiU and Wills, all of whom are connected with our loading club, so that, notwithstanding all that was said, the M.C.C, have more of a pull now than ever. Had all the nominees chosen thought ' fit to attend, I am very sure that a different committee would have been selected. It is only fair to state that the M.C.C. invited two nominees from each of nine different clubs to attend, viz., East Melbourne, South Mel bourne, Richmond, Carlton, South Yarra, Geelong, Castlemaine, Ballarat and Bendigo, out of which only half that number showed up. I will name, just for the satisfaction of the public and cricketers generally, the nominees who were at the meeting and those who were not : — East Melbourne, Clarke and Riggall ; South Melbourne, Osberne and Fishiey; Richmond, Hedley (Conway absent) ; South Yarra, Wray and Ogilvie ; Carlton, B. James (M'Farland absent) ; Geelong, Wills (Riddle absent). Ballarat, Sandhurst and Castlemaine did not send their representatives. The M.C.C. had four members of their general committee present. Those who did not attend at the meeting deserve great censure, ? after the strenuous manner in whioh the M.C.C. was opposed with regard to the selection of the match committee being not altogether confined to then4 committee. Now, let us have no more growling about cricketers not having a voice in the selection of the match com mittee after this. The only difference in the new committee is that the name of Mr Cameron is substituted for that of Mr Hammorsley. I do not think the change a judioious one, as Mr Hammersloy ia a better judge of the game, 'and has had, I think, more experience than his substitute. I would suggest that no time be lost in getting our men into aotive practico, as the tima for our match with Tasmania draws nigh. It will bo early next month, remember. I hear the next time the M.C.C. meet the East Melbourne they will play without tho aid of their professional and ground, but will retain the sorvices of their tntor. This is a step in the right direction, for playing all their paid men places them beyond the reach of hopeful competition, consequently there is no rivalry, aud without rivalry what is orioket ? Nothing 1 Wholesomo rivalry is tho sure foundation of Buccoss. Do not think that by advocating tho sotting usido of the professionals in club matches I wish to debar them from taking part in matches altogether. There ought to be handicap matches got up occasionally in which ? they could takepart. TheM.C.C.'oughtto have been satisfied with the advantage they always had over the other clubs in having professional players for their training improvement in the noble game without requiring their assistance to viin matches. The M.C.C, as the leading clnb, should aim at supremacy without the assistance of its paid men. The match committee have selected the eighteen out of which the elevens are to be chosen who are to do battle for the honor of the colony hi the ensuing intercolonial matches with Tasmania and New South Wales. The eighteen is a very good one, and if the best teams are chosen Victoria need have no fear as to her not being well represented. They are as follows : — W. Campbell, Don. Campbell, Cameron, CosBtick, Allan, R. W. Wardill, Wells, Gibson, Kelly, Phillips, Gaggin, Dan Wilkie, Goldsmith, Egglestone, Hedley, RobertBOn, Riddle and Sweeney. There was very little doing in cricket last Saturday, owing no doubt to the fatigue in curred through going to' the races. 'They say ' every man swallows a peck of dirt' in his time ; I am sure I swallowed my quantum on the Hill on New Year's Day. What a con trast I thought it was to the beautiful ever green sward of the M.C.C, with a gentle southerly breeze blowing, where I betook my self on Saturday to see if my Bight was in any degree impaired by the severe usage it received on the previous day. The match played was confined to the members, viz., first eleven v. next fourteen (including Cosstick ; and some very good cricket it afforded. The feature of the afternoon's play was, in, my opinion, the brilliant, batting of Hedley — 68 runs, without giving the ghost of a chance against bowling (query) like Wills's is not to be sneezed at from one who was only a second eleven man a season or two ago. Many good judges who saw his innings say that it is the finest they have seen this season. He will be an honorable aspirant for inter colonial honors, and I think he will prove himself the colt par excellence of the season, as he is very painstaking in practice, has a fine defence, can hit well, and also has any amount of confidence in a big match. Noyes contributed 33 by nice forward play. A'Beckett put up 23, and I see Butler has at last broken the ice by making a double against good bowling. In the bowling, Wardill (windmill) beats the veteran Tommy hollow by getting the same number of wickets for fewer balls, and far less runs. How do you account for this, Master Tommy ? By-the-bye, I forgot to mention that Sam. Cosstick had the detesied 0 put against his name, being bowled by Wills. On the part of the eleven, two wickets fell for 37 runs, viz., Wardill 12 and Riddle 5 ; both were had by Plummer's slows, and how such trashy sturf can get wickets I am at a loss to imagine, unless he is allowed to bowl tho wickets for fun, as that agile little fellow thinks he can bowl 'a few.' On the East Melbourno ground fourteen of Carlton tried conclusions with the first eleven of the E. M.C.C. I thought, seeing Conway playing with the fourteen, it would be a close affair. Carlton went in first, and Dan Wilkie administered his ' specific' in such a manner that soon dispelled tho hopes of the Carltonians. Verily, I think, with the excep tion of Conway, the rest of the fourteen did not score 10 runs between them off his bowl ing; he got 9 wickets for 23 runs, of which Conway made the greater part : he made alto gether 34, without giving a chance, aud made a spanking 'hit off Gaggin over the fence for 6. The fielding of the Carlton does not sustain the reputation they havo acquired in that department of the game: with one or two exceptions it was wretched. Conway bowled well for them, obtaining 6 wickets, but was unable to alter tho result of tho match, which was never hi doubt from the start. Carlton, bofore you again meet slow bowling, get some small boys to give you a month's practice with their underhand bowling, and I am eure it will do more good than the slinging, uncertain staff to which you practice on your own ground — Ben James, of course, excepted. I hear that at the end of the month Gibson leaves the employ of the M.C.C. . What a chance for either Richmond or East Melbourne to 'nobble' him, as he is considered the most reliable bat in the colony. East Melbourne v. South Melbourne. — These clubs will meet for the first time this sea son : First eleven at South Melbourne, second eleven at East Melbourne. The following art the' East Melbourne players: — First eleven, Dan. Wilkie, Dtxv. Wilkie, W. Campbell, D. Camp bell, Gaggin, Goldsmith, Stewart, Williams, Peryman, Kilburn, Clarke. Second eleven, Ballantyne, Riggall, Jennings, Thomas, Moodie, Forrester, Fisher, Sims, Freeman, J. Wilkie, Browning, M'Lennan, Liddle. _ M.C.C. (FIRST ELEVEN) V. NEXT FOUR TEEN (WITH COSSTICK). A match between tho first eleven of the M.C.C. and the next fourteen with CosBtiok was played on tho Melbourne ground on Satur day, and although the interest was confined to the club, thero was nevertheless some lino crickot displayed, most notably being tho splendid batting of Hedley for the fourteen ; he obtained 68 runs in grand stylo, without giving a Binglo chance ; even tho redoubtablo Wills was unablo to distance him. Noyes also made 33 in a careful manner, and A'Beokett and Butler each obtained their double figures viz., 23 aud 19 respectively. Tho fourteen suo coeded in making altogether 160 runs. Thero are two. wiokets down of the eleven for 37 runs, viz., Wardill, 12, and Riddlo (Geolong), 5; both were v.itiins to little Plummor's insinu tors. Gibs --- lms put up 16 to his namo, and not out, anl Phillips, not out, 1, It is possiblo that the eleven will hot have it all their own way, as 166 runs, with fourteen in the fieW, will require a deal of getting.

East Melbourne ground, where ex- ? , ? cellent wickets hadbeen prepared by M* Alpine. The visitors took first innings, and sent ;R. M'Farland and J.

M'Farland .\\-'-t retired to the pavilion in Dan's first - ',.] over, being bowled by a curly one, after which ;V ;.'. ensued a , regnlar slaughter of innocents,. . none of the Carlton, with the exception of , ,; Conway, being able to withstand the slows. The fourteen were disposed of for the small score of : 60, mainly attributable to Wilkie's fine slow bowling, who obtained 9 wickets for 23 runs. .Conway made 34 in hia best style without , giving a chance ; he made a hit (worthy .of*.:.'.' note, namely, for 6, clean out of the ground' . ' ' from the middle of the turf. Stewart bowled very ' nicely the short time he was on, securing 2 wickets for 7 runs. The East Melbourne then took the bat, topping the score made by their -: opponents for the loss of 3 wicketa. Gaggin, W. Campboll, Goldsmith and Dan Wilkie dis tinguished themselves fey their good batting. ? . ' Gaggin made top score, 40, by neat play, and W. Campbell 11 : although he only made 11, he was in some time, and stopped some fine ' bawling from Conway. Goldsmith got bis 12 ' '.' very well, when he succumbed to a dripper' from , ' Conway. Dan Wilkie scraped off 26 in his riebbor notbing style. When time was called, the East ;- ' Melbourne had scored 130, 'with the loss of S wickets, thus leaving them the victors by'70 : ' '; runs and 3 wickets. The bowling of Conway '- : { and ;James was very good, particularly 'the *; V.': former, who succeeded in obtaining 6 out' of ''. ; '?'? the 8 wickets.
