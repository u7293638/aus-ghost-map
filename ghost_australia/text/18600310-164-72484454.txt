DEATH-BED. -? WE value time but on the bed of death, When its brief sands are running to an end ; O ! how we then remember with dismay Our wasted hours, which, like reproachful ghosts, Of murder'd friends, rise up and pass before us ! How quickly flee the moments,-precious then As moments ne'er were dear to us before, Each counted with an agonising pang As they recede, and with them-ebbing life Leaving the shrinking soul in terror dire, To meet, as best it may, the conqueror Death.
