Now that the Government have abandoned their first intention of pressingforttyote ofcredit, we sup pose that the dissolution will be almost immediate., Tiierevill be no further business - of W^rtance to be dang, for the Education Bill can hardly be expected to pass, and all .other legislation may veiv well be postponed to the next Parliament.

We own to an accidental prosperity the power of bearing a heavier taxa tionthuiiBfciown anywhere else in Austt&U;^ and our fiscal system is far : Jrom equUeble in its pressure or so Advantageous as it might be incite fMulta. SYDNEY SMITH'S famous ftilminatiou against the old tariff of Great Britain is applicable in its en tirety to us, and'in a new colony this ought not to be. In the great essen-. tiiu of law reform we asked for im . jirovement and we got-a commis sion; which, for all that appears of .its labors, maybe supposed to be lost in contemplation of their possible magnitude. The jurisdiction in in tolventy and the expense and uncer tainty of legal procedure are simply ^giiceful, yet eveiy year rotihe iut olx yetu® have we been prdffifcd amendment only to be disappointed. We oertainlj^kti fall back upon the I redistribution of the electoral dis tricts and the Elections Bill, on which last there is already a measure of re peal shadowed out as respects what are called electors' rights. As to everything else, every session has beheld a procession of measures at the beginning only to see them vanish into ghost-like nonentity at the end. We are increasing our expenditure regularly at the rate of one hundred thousand pounds a year, and making no provision for the exigencies which ft time of pressure might bring forth. AH this should make men think, and, if it makes them think, they should be prepared to act upon their reflec tion. Wc are not about to attribute the blame, which should and must fall somewhere, of such a condition of things to bo the Ministry or to any Ministry. There has been as much to censure in the gone-by past as in the recent year or two or in the ' present. The whole legislature have participated in causing the evils under which we labor, and the reason is plain enough. There is no such thing as avowed defined principle or consistency of procedure based upon well considered conclusions amongst thera. The political history of the | last few years has been a history of expedients hastily adopted, met by shifts and tricks which had a like origin. The policy of both parties may be described as one of living from hand to mouth, in which, very often, the persons composing them separated in their choice of diet. bers who sit on the Ministerial benches would readily change their positions were it not that they see nothing to trust in the Opposition, and that some of the best members of the Opposition would act in con junction with more than one minister if they saw anything reliable in their colleagues. In such a state of things what is understood by a policy is simply impossible on either side. To attempt it would be to aim at walk ing by a map when you feared your neighbors might thrust you into the first quagmire on the track. In such cases men are more occupied in making sure of their footing as they go than-in preparing for any large or comprehensive movement. It is desirable, nay, rather, it is necessary that this condition of .public ai&lrs; should be altered with as little delay as possible; that principle should be Substituted for expediency, and a consistent perseverence in carrying out that principle for vacillations iity for trimming to fit an uncertain support, or the desire of place irre spective of the dignity which pro perly belongs to power. It is to be hoped tjiat.the next elections will elicit some combinations more capable n Bonrnn 4)um thtise we have seen of late - we could hardly ;be worse off than we are but that isnoreason why we should not fey to be a great deal better. some of the mein presumed neces
