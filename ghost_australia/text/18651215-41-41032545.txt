SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB'S SUMMER MEETING. First Day.— Thursday, December 14. Stewards— Sir J. H. Fisher (President), Hon. J. Morphett, Hon. John Baker, and Mr. Philip LevL Judge— Mr. J- Gilbert. Starter— Mr. J. Chambers. Cleit of the Course— Mr. G. Bennett The arrangement of the South Australian Jockey Club to hold its Summer Meeting this year in the middle of December seems to have taken the general public by surprise. Of course the We of the Press knew all about it, and everything con nected with it; but the 'public at large, the great, all-comprehensive We, the people of South Australia,' were certainly somewhat startled by the event. We are so much accus tomed to associate these liaces with Christmas cheer, holiday sports, and New Year greetings, that, like a sleeping senator during a nonconfi dence debate, Wk started up crying ' What's up?' The weather was all serene— cool, calm, and comfortable, without a single duststonn. The course itself was. as might be supposed, anything but elastic to the tread of the hoofs of the running horses. The drought of the last two or three months rendered it hard enough, and here and there rather too dusty to be quite agreeable. The attendance on the first day is not usually excessive. On Thursday it was moderately large say 2,000, more or less. It need scarcely be re corded that our real, downright sporting cha racters were all there. 'In course they was.' Then, there were present a considerable number of our more sober-sided citizens, wun ineir iaiumes; aiso, a gooa sprin&un; of country visitors; and 'there were all sorts of buggies, and coaches, and carts, and plenty of liquors, and solids, and tarts. There were ladies on horses, and horsemen as well, but as to their number it beats one to tell ; for the reader will see when a party are mounted— like the blackfellow'a pigs he has heard of no doubt— there's always some fellow that flashes about, like a cat on hot bricks that cannot be counted.' Amongst the most distin guished of the visitors] weie several members of His Excellency's family, Sir James Hurtle fisher, the Hon. J. Morphett. and some other members of the Legislative Council. The arrangements of the Committee were in every respect satisfactory. The several events 0 the day were brought off with promptitude, and the convenience ot visitors was in all respects provided for. The refreshment department of the Grand Stand was as usual presided over by Mr. George Aldridge, and, by George, there was an abundant supply provided for all comers. Perhaps if Mr. Aldridge had engaged more assistants there wouli have been fewer waiters, though the periodical demands upon his tap and corkscrew were re sponded to with the alacrity for which that ex perienced caterer is so deservedly renowned. Bookmakers were brisk as busy bees in the betting line, but speculation was not apparently indulged in to any great extent The first event on the card was the Maiden Plate, which was won by Mr. P. B. Coglin's br.f. Apparition, beating a field of eight other com petitors. The race was well contested, and the mile of grouud was got over in 1 ruin. 561 sec, being 3i sec. longer than the time occupied in the corresponding event last April. Mr. it. S. Low's b.g. Cupbearer won the Town Plate by taking the nrst and third heats. There were four competitors. Charley O'Malley put the Cupbearer upon his mettle, and as the second horse is entitled to 20 sovs. Seven splendid young bloods stripped for the Derby. Mr. O. Adcock's Tim Whiffler was the winner, with Smuggler a capital second. Value of the stakes. £238. Time, 2 .min. 53 sec This is 10 seconds less than the time occupied last year in the Derby race. The Hack Stakes were taken by Mr. R. S. Low's Tiger. There were seven competitors and three heats. Subjoined are the details of each race :— FIRST RACE. Maiden Plate, of 50 sovs. For horses that have never won: entrance, 5 sovs. One mile.

Adcork'8 g.m. Lucy, 5 yrs. (Shugg). Bifteman declared 2} lbs., Chief Justice 3 lbs., and Vivid 5i lbs. over. Mr. H. L. Roe's b.f. Zuleika was entered for the race, but did not come up to the starting-post. After two or three false starts the pack was got off in good style with the exception of Corsair, who was left behind. Vivid took and kept the lead for about half a mile; the Ghost, His Honor, and the Eifleman then rushed forward, with the rest close up. At the entrance of the straight running the event seemed doubtful, Apparition, Rifleman, and Chief Justice being abreast of each other. Apparition, however, was cleverly pushed into the foreground and won by a length. Time, lm. 561 sec. SECOND BACK. Town Plate, of 150 sovs., 20 sovs. to second horse; entrance, 10 sovs. Two miles; heats , Weights, 3 yrs. old, 7 st 9 lbs. ; 4 yrs. 9 st 9 lbs. ; 5 yrs.. 10 st : 6 yrs. and aged., 10 st. 4 lbs.

Bennett's b.ra, Czarina, 4 yrs. (Jenkins) ? dr. First Heat— The four competitors started at the word of command, and quietly kept abreast for some distance. On the first approach to the chair Locomotive and. Cupbearer were gaining upon Czarina and the grey, and soon afterwards Cup bearer took the lead, and could not be persuaded to give it up again. In the meantime Czarina lout ground at every stride, and only succeeded in saving her distance. The race now lay between Cupbearer and Charley. Cupbearer v«6 sharply punished, but pushed past the chair a length ahead. Time, 3 min. 55J sec. ??-. ; Second Heat— Locomotive and Czarina were drawn. The run for the heat between Cupbearer and Charles O'Malley was splendid. Cupbearer took the lead, and was from one to two lengths ahead over the first mile and a half. The g.g. then challenged, and a desperate run home was made. Charles O'Malley was leading at the straight running, and Cupbearer could only be induced to keep close up by means of the gentle stimulants of steel and whipcord. On approaching home, however, he gave the grey all his work to do. The latter won by so small a space as to lead many to suppose there had been a dead heat A few more yards would certainly have turned the Bcale in favour of Cupbearer. Time, 3 min. inird Heat— The «rey was the favourite before the start Cupbearer again took the lead, and, though hotly pursued by Charley, was not once collared. The latter won by three or lour lengths. Time, 3 min. 59 sec. THIRD BACK. . Derby— A sweepstakes of 10 sovs., 2 ft, with 100 sovs added, for 3 yrs. old, One mile and a half.

Smuggler and Tim were backed against the field. A («onitnl stnrt was affected. R&ncrer; soon fell lopelessly in the rear, and Smuggler led the way lalf round the course, with Tim and Cowra hanging close upon his quarters. Tim Whiffler then rushed to the first place, and kept the lead up to the winning-post Smuggler was a full length «hind. Miss Fisher made a very good third. Time, 2 miu. 53 sec. FOURTH RACE.

After a pret'.y good start, Tiger dropped behind and chased the pack rouiyd the course. The rest began soon to spread out fanlike, with Miuna, Topsy, and Mr. Gerard's b.g. in the front. Topsy soon after lost ground, and left the race to be contested by Minna and the anonymous b.g. The latter won by about two lengths. Time, 3 min. 1 sec.(?) Second Heat— Buck and Mr. McGee's mare were drawn. The remaining competitors kept in close company half round the course. Minna then led off, with Tiger close up. Before reaching the straight running Tiger collared Minna, and reached home a winner by two good lengths. Time not .nfrfm Third Heat— The b.jf. jumped forward at the start, but was quickly passed by the Tiger. The atter continued to increase the distance between himself and his competitor, and won by seven or eight lengtlis. Time, 3 min. 9 sec. The sports were concluded at a quarter to 7 o'clock.

Cocktail is named as the winner of the Hurdles by the knowing ones, though others equally sanguine think that the stakes will fall to the lot of Leader. Cupbearer is backed against the field for the Trial Stakes. General Lee will engage in the strife, undaunted by his recent mis hap. Conjecture has not ventured to say much re specting the Shorts. Possibly the contest will lay between Lucifer and Vivid. We shall see. We are requested to state that the luncheon at the Grand Stand will take place immediately after this race. ?
