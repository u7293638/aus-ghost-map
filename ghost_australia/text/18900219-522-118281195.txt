WMlmaut Oohfterano* Th» Wesleyan conference closed its .session on ^Yedncsday. last-V .Tlw question of most genieral interest dealt with that day related to church and Sunday schools.. Qn the motion of the Bev. J. S. Austin,, the following resolution was agreed to -.—"That statistical returns of our cbureh and Sunday schools having been presented to the conference, itisgratify ing to find that there has been a'slight increase in the number of the members of our ehurob; and it is especially j pleasing to note there has been an increase of 75 per cent, in the number of Sundaybchool children who are meeting in class. While, however, we would thus record our gratitude to God for the measure of success granted to us during the year* we feel that, considering the completeness of our organisation and the large number of agents employed , we have a right to expect a much larger measure of- success; and realising that it is ' not by might nor by power,' but by the Spirit.of the Lord, that success is tobe aohieved: we pledge ourselves to seek more earnestly than ever a rich outpouring of the Spirit of Ood upon ourselves and the church over whioh the Holy Ghost bath made us overseers; and that we may da our purt to secureananswer to our prayers, we hereby resolve to set apart a week, to. be. hereafterspecified, forspecial prayer in all ourchurdhes, the Friday of that week to be devoted to fasting as well as prayor. We also resolve that, wherever practicable, this week of special prayer shall be followed by a series of speoial mission services, in connection with which wo may hopo to reaoh numbers of the unsaved,, and lead them to the fold of Christ." . . ;
