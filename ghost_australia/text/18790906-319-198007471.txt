Once, , when overtaken . by a thunderstorm, slio sought rofugo in Widow HaTting's. cot-, tago," where slio seated herself quite affably, and gave the" widow's /granddaughter a ! threepenny" piece wlibn- tlie Showennassrid over.

Perhaps Captain Arkiey. grew at .times unbear able ; perhaps indeed he was always unbearable,, and preferred his own temper: to any otHcrso-' ciety.

As for flowers, "the place," said Mis3 Le Deene, "is like a horticultural sliowYrbanks of them iriside arid out ; a perfect wristp' of money, I .."call it; and on the top of Soritli'cli/Fe, too, whrirp there is riot a creature but" themselves to see the exhibitibri.'

Arid wliatox'er might be thought of the, latter pari of Misri Le Dcene'ssentenco, there could be no Question but - that, as has bcen said beforo, Mr®4 Arkiey was as sweet a flower as a man need iiesiio to see iri tomi or country,' in crowded bpiris -1 . amongst othors rare and lovely, or'bloomihg iri',! sweet simplicity on'the lonoly mountain-side. . Whilo her visitor was exorcising her astuto mind in wandering over all likely possibilities, threading her devious way through pro3 and cons innumerable, Mrs..
