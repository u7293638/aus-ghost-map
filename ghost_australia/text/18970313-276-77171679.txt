At Fosfc Donelson there were only soma half e. dozen companies fortifying and drilling. Tho new chaplain was mossing with the senior captain. " In thoao days," he Bay a, " the men had not yet given np all home habits. They wore white shirts and uuderolothes, and every night un dressed and went to bed like ordinary folk, One day it wea rumored that the gunboata wore in the fiver below na aad were comlug up. About miduight, while all were aleap ing soundly, the long roll of tho dram be gan to beat in the oompany stationed on the river bank. At onoo there, was a stir in the camp j offlacra were calling the men to fall in, and there w&9 much harrying fio and fro. Captain Beaumont was always careful about his dress when on duty, and even now he did not neglect his toilet. Quiokly he pat on his uniform, buckled on his sword, and stepped out of his tent to take command of his company. Bat his man had not been so thoughtful, They eprang np and grasped their muskets, and formed m line in front of their tents; bub every man of thorn had forgotten to put on hia iroasara, and there they stood in their night clothes, like (sheeted ghosts,' trembling with cold and excitement;. As the captain and I stepped out, and hia eye glsnoed along tho line, his sense of pro priety got the batter of his military arsons andheehonted oat hia first command, 'Con found your foolish bouIb, go and put on your breeches !' The situation dawned on the men, and, with shouts of laughter, they prepared for war by patting on those needful articles of apparel. After all, it was a false alarm, aad the men were Boon sent to bed again."
