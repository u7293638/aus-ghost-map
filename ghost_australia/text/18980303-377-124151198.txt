??C'?UB, HP MH R. ROBER'?S. ALwcmwwE c " What doyou thinkof Chrlst? and what He may think of you" was delivereed in the Oddfellows' Hall last evening by Mr. B. Roberto, of Birmingham. There was a good attendance, and Hr. J. Orr presided, and be. spoke an attentive hearing for the lecturer. Mr. Roberts began by speaking of the brevity of human life, and said that men spent a lot of time in examining various doctrines, but the question of questions was " What think ye of Christ ?" which was asked in a" still small voice"' that was sarnely heard or heeded. It was a delusion to imagine that a person sould ive as he liked and begin to think of matters religious when sistness or trouble same. That was not true religion. Religion was love to, and friendship with, God. It was impossible to believe in. Jeeus Christ until one knew whel that meant--there must first be knowledge. Them was but one God, and a mediator between Him and man--th ford Jesus. Christ, the Son of God. If GodÂ· consisted of tbree parts--God, Boo, and ely: Ghost-how conid the Sos be the mediator between the three Persons ? A simpler seern? the matter was-that there was but one Godiand that Christ was mortal, and was called "the Son of Gsod"beoase he was born of the Spirit Christ was the'only homen being who ,~sb overcome the powerof death. With respeatlto the econd'palaof the title of the leetose, Mc. Roberts said; that only those who did tke will of the Father woeld be called to enter. the Kingdom of Glod. When Christ said "'-Onme, ye blessed, of my Father," He was addressing those who. had been addicted to prastinal acte of beneflienoe. To others the word "-Depart from.Me"were pronounced, and thereweonldbe "weeping-a?d wailing and geashing-ol tasth." The proendings terminated with-singing and prayer.
