The Day is {Joining. Come hithar ft-da, and barken, for a tale there/ia to*BU, * Of the wohdlwWI; -di^»* A-coming when all shall be better ^hftn well. And the tale shall be told of a country, a, landin theinidstxtf theaea, ?, And folk f hall call it England in the days ? -^-ihsJ^axBjgoing to ..folb_-_--________ There more than one i» a thou^tid, in th£ Ha,vk f-.hA.fc nrp vi».fc fo flnmp. \ i; * Shall have some hope of ; the morrow, some\ |j joy of the ancuftit home. I For then— laugh not, but listen, to this jc — -- strange tale of jninetr ? I All folk that are in England shall be 1 - tter \ I lodged than awine. l Then a man shall work and bethink h m, :- and rejoice in the deeds of his hand, Nor yet come home in the even too faint and weary Hbo^tand. ? Men in that time a-coming shall work and have no fear X For to-morrow'fl lack of earning and the \ hunger- wolf anear. * I tell you this fpr a wonder, that no man ; then shall be fclad Of his fellow's fair and mishap to snatch at the work he had. ~~~ For that which the WoTfceT~w«methH_HaiI then be his indeed. Nor shall lialf be reaped for nothing by him that«owed'no seed, : O strange new wonderful justice I But for whom shall we gather the gain ? For ourselves and for each of our fettowsr ? : ? ' and no hand shall labour in vain. I Then all mine and all tliim shall be -mi% I and no ittore shall any man crave I For rieber1?lpilr«erve- for nothing but to fetter a friend for a slave And what wealth then shall be left us when none shall gather gold To buy his friend in the market, and pinch and pine the sold ? Nay, what save the lovely city, and the ''' Httfe trouwon ttroiriil, And the wastes and the woodland beauty, and the poets teeming head ; ; And the painter's hand of wonder ; and the t-: marvellous fiddle-bow, p And the -banded fchoirs of music— all those jU-=_-r . --_ that do&nd; lenow,- ? _ ? „ | For all these shall be ours and all men's, |; nor shallany lack a share f Of the toil and the gain of livii g in the days when the world grows fair. Ah ! such are the days that shall be ! But what are the deeds of to-day, In the dayslif Xhe years we dwell in, that wear our !i ves away ? ; Why, then, and for what are we waiting ? There are three words to speak Wk will it, and what is the foe nan hut the dream-strong wakened and weak ? s-- '- O why and for what are we waiting ? while j our brothers droop and die, \ And on every wind of the heavens a wasted 1 life goes; by. How long shall they reproach us where crowd on crowd they dwell, Poor ghosts'- of the' wicked j^ity, thegold ; crushed hungry hell ? Through squalid life they laboured, in sordid grief they- died, Those Rons of a mignty mother, those props of England's pride. They are gone ; there is none can undo it, nor save' our Boula from the curse ; But many a million cometh, and shall they be better or worse ? x ' ~~ . - ? ?- ? i It is we must answer and hasten, and open ; wide the door For the rich man's hurrying terror, and the slow-foot bop? of the jjoor. Yea, the voiceless wrath _ of the wretched, , and their unlearned discontent, We must give it voice and wisdom till the waiting-tide --e spent. Cow, t'hen, since all things call uk, the ', living and the dead ~ Ami o'er tiTeTTv^pltmrift ~tanglp -argliinm vr ing light is t?h«»d. Come, then, let us east off fooling, and put ease and rest For the cauhk alone is worthy till tlu5 ? good days bring the best. Come, join in the only battle whewin no man can fail, Where whoso fadeth and dieth, yet his deed shall still prevail. Ah! come, cast off all fooling, for this, at ? least we know : That the Dawn and the Day is coming, and forth the Banners go. .___.._- William Mohkis.
