BRANCHES FROM THE MAIL ROUTES. " TO THE HIGHLANDS BOUND." "A chieftain to the Highlands bound, and in a great hurry, would have, in the present day, no dealings with am boatman His silver pound," offered, as per the ballad, to be in of the paddles, would be now paid 19 a railway fire Those who have "hearts 111 the HILLE lands, or thoughts that way tending, prefer, however, in the summer time to go thither by the watery route, and particularly so do all tourists for their special behoof has been built the s s Iona a steamer altogether planned for those only on pleasure bent To go from Glasgow to Inverness, the capital of the Highlands, may be made in this way a two or three day's' excursion, or, better still, a whole week or a month may be taken over it, and leave only regrets for shortness of time On such a tour I might leave Glasgow from the Broomielaw Wharf, and go down the Clyde as a commencement of the voyage 1 Bmell, however something worse than a rat in the very idea of attempting such a thing, and especially in the early morning, and on an empty stomach 'He Iona is a paddle wheel boat, and so stirs up matter the it, like sleeping dogs, were better let live There is an old saying about "stir and- something else that well applies to the case of stirring up Clyde water on the seaward side of Glasgow Taught by experience, I take the rail to Greenock, at which the steamer calls after its CJ) de trouble is over, and there takes me on board. A glance at the map shows the route to us from Greenock across the mouth of the Clyde to Dunoon, on theArgjkshiro shore, where our steamer s first call is made A look it Greenock has to be postponed to another time, but Dunoon can be seen in passing.; While passengers are landing and others with luggage coming on board there is time enough to walk to the ruins of the old castle on the hill to the left of the pier A fellow tourist bent on having his money is worth, reads from a book he carries something about this castle I listen to him until he comes to the information that it was visited by "Mary Queen of Scots when she made that Royal excursion to the Highlands over the road we are now going. It was noticeable that this Castle of Dunoon was one in which she appeared as visitor and not as prisoner Such castles are exceptional, and suffice me for a remembrance of Dunoon All along and around here the shores pre Bent villages that have names and stones of some sort attached to nearly all of them They gradually fade from sight and memory as we get further into the wider and rougher waters of the Firth of Clyde Two castles and a lighthouse are, however, things not to be easily hidden the owner of one of these castles has determined to do his share towards rescuing Scotland from any further Johnsonian success about the want of trees He has planted over nine hundred acres very thickly with them, which, as his country man remarked will be growing while he is sleeping ' Toward Castle for such is its name, stands on the corner point around which the Iona now turns on her way from the waters of the Firth of Clyde to those of the Kyles of Bute It says much to show how an m quiring maid may be in time laid to sleep, and how little inquisitive one may become by practice that I never in quired what a " Firth oratorio means and don't care Our steamer now runs across the entrance to the Kyles to call it Rothsay, the chief town of the Island of Bute, round which paying possession of its proprietor the Kyle will take us This town is at the head of a bay, and shows, centrally situated, an ivy covered old ruin that was ages ago a royal residence The whole island belongs to the Marquis of Bute and has by the way it was shepherded and improved during his minority made him one of the most disgust- ingly rich men now living. Near Twicken- ham, on the Thames, I was shown Garrick's villa, and if I go inland here in the Isle of Bute I can be shown that of his great sue ceBsor Edmund Kean The visit must be postponed, as likewise one to Mount Stuart, the mansion of the Marquis, some four miles off from Rothesay. Wealth seems to have made the Marquis its own heir ! This island is but one among his large possessions He takes the revenues of Rothesay, and the Prince of Wales only the empty title of its Duke It contributes, with others, to give to the latter also the further title ennobled by Scott of "Lord of the Isles" Why Kean choBe Bute for a residence is explained when I am told that the climate is remarkably mild, to an extent scarcely to be expected in this usually supposed cold Quarter. The winding waters of the Kyles of Bute take one along and among pretty scenery both to sideways and mid-stream. The latter part of it are the islands to which we have to give way, one of which is Burnt Island It bears such singular name from having upon it one of those strange vitrified forts" of which Scotland can show as many as Ireland can of round towers. They are similar curios in their way, and I shall have to see and say more about them The side views by the way are the entrance to Loch Striven and Ridden, which might, for the matter of euphony, have better names given to them All the islands have their tales of fact and fiction, and not all of them seem as yet to have been used up by the novelists I am continually adding to a note book of materials for a three volume addition to Mudie s stock Such intentions are very general with tourists and if they come to nothing else, beget kind in quires after once book, as if it were a baby From the Kyles we diverge into Loch Fyne, to which the word ' Ilernnga might be fitly added-the title of this loch, indeed looks unfinished without it It being now about lunch time, we call at Larbert, a fishing vii page just handy, and take in a stock of the newly caught fish It was noticeable what good appetites all the passengers appeared to have for this dainty, and such it really is before its flavour has faded by many hours keeping In our attention to these herrings and the Scotch ale that is about we let old castles and such like nonentities on the shore pass unnoticed Some two miles before we should in the natural course of things arose out of Loch Time, we turn aside to the Crinan Canal at the junction of which with the loch is the village of Ardnshuig more we have to change steamers, and go on for nine miles in the canal boat to that larger one that will be waiting for us at the canal end. The reason for the turn of the steamer into Loch Fine, and up this canal, is to save us running out to sea, and having to round the end of the point of land or peninsula called Can tyre, and come up the other side of it, the which is not only a lengthy but often a boisterous and sometimes dangerous passage. For this canal I am told we have again to " bless the Duke of Argyll" who appears to have attended to more than one of Scotland's needs. It was begun at his Instance some seventy years ago, and was a source of vast trouble and expense before its completion in 1817. As there are some fifteen or so of locks in this up-hill waterway, the favoured mode with the majority of us for doing most of the journey is on the towing path alongside the steamer. The better time that the vessel makes is lost in the delay at the different locks, and the walk is worth more than the trouble of it, and can be exchanged for the boat ride at any of the vessel's many stoppages. Getting into Loch Crinan and the steamer there waiting at the end of the canal, we take a second look at Duntroon Castle, a very striking object in a prominent position that at once suggests a three-volume historical romance to the mind of anybody. It is haunted by the ghost of a piper who got in here as a spy for an intended invader, was detained for his trouble, and never rescued from his sad fate by those who knew the worst on his not returning His favourite pibroch can be heard at times borne on the breeze when the aid is in a particular quarter, which it seldom gets into Another music, that of the dinner bell, is that which now attracts attention, and the rest of Loch Crnnn is thus left to the observation of the man at the wheel We have now got into the territory of Breadalbane Duke, who owns most of the survey findings, but they are better known to the world as the poetical property of Thomas Campbell, who lived for some time here about and his left record of it in his poems From Loch Crinan we cross through the great door, or Dorus, as they call the gate of Jura Sound, to go through that of Scarbra, and are then on the sea coast, from which a turn is made among a network of five or six islands, of which the only pronounceable name is that of Dasdale All of them, however, are profitable properties for slate quarries or such like produce Finally, on terms Kerrara Sound, we run into the land locked, well sheltered bay of Oban, some two hours or more from leaving Orman, and some hundred miles or so from Glasgow 1 or Scotland this Oban has been a town of quickest growth, and more like a gold fields township in that respect than a seaside one It was nothing, or next to that thirty years ago, but its annual rental now would satisfy almost anyone desiring the trouble of wealth Some of the finest hotels in the country are to be seen here, as likewise half a dozen branch banks In population it now counts thousands is residents, to say nothing of the visitors on whom it lives, and for whom and whose accommodation as a house of call Oban only exists Oban is worth a visit if it be only to see the fine ruins of its two castles though that sort of thing is rather overdone in Scotland, there is always admiration to be had for such a rum so splendidly situated as is Dunolly Castle It is nearly as grand as that sublime rum of Dunluce that so fascinates the travellers gaze at Portitish, on his road to the Giants Causeway I learnt no particulars about Dunolly nor about Dunluce It is better in such cases to know nothing, and to leave the story to imagination What is so obtained 13 probably pretty much as accurate as one half that one might learn about it I believe that it was told to me that this case belongs to that Campbell family into which a branch of roy alty lately married The other Oban castle, Dunstaffnage, is a seashore walk from the town, and stands upon a jutting promontory of land that forms one end of its bay In position it faces a narrow arm of the sea, and is at the junction of two waters that give it often a stormy time Of the early history of this delightful old ruin little is known, and the great fact connected with its fiction is that here was preserved the Scottish Stone of Destiny that has been long since removed from its former home here to its present resting place in Westminster Abbey Tins famous stone was brought from Bethel, in Palestine, where it had once formed Jacobs pillow on the night that he had his dream of the heavenly ladder Its first stage thence was to Scone Castle and its "nimble air It was used there as a seat or footstool, upon which Scotland s Kings were crowned At coronation times it now supports the chair of Royalty at Westminster I find folks who doubt of its having been Jacobs pillow, but then I find those who doubt everything, and are none the happier for it Life is dull indeed without belief As a central spot for tourists excursions Oban is a great resort Boats go from it to the outlying islands of Staffa and Iona when the weather is propitious Those who wish to take their pleasure sadly can go by boat also to Ballaghuhsh, further along the coast, across Lochs Line and Crerar, the which 13 the landing place for Glencoe, and the dismal scene five miles inland of its dreadful massacre I am easily dissuaded from this excursion, to which I don't think I had serious intention I did, when at Brussels trudge sixteen miles on foot and the like distance back to see the plains of Waterloo, but that was a patriotic duty and those fields reflected a glory on England which Glencoe a murderously stained turf is very far from doing Another excursion by boat from Oban is to the whirl pool of Cornevrechkan, in a strait between the visible islands of Scarbra, Islay and Jura Scott and Campbell have both poised on this maelstrom, telling of its loudly re verberatmg year, caused, I believe, by the chafing of pent up waters among narrow I avenues through which they have been forcing their way for some thousands of years From Oban the steamer takes its way through pretty scenery of mountain, loch and glen and through the length of the (great Loch Linnhe and Eli to Banavie, over which hangs mighty Ben Nevis, the monarch of all the mountains of Scotland At the foot of it I find an excellent stone built and accommodating hotel, the Lochiel Arms, which at first sight appears altogether disproportionate to the importance of the little hamlet A good hotel often, however, creates the want which visitors supply when sure of good quarters for a reason for visitors so seeking Banavie, nothing greater than Ben New in can be needed It is four thousand and odd feet high, and twenty four miles of girth about its base The snow has never been known to disappear from that top which here literally in such heavy grandeur towers and whitens with eternal sleet Excursions from Banavie appear, like the late Sir Robert Peel, ideas of things generally, to " have three courses ' Ben Nevis and its snow having been ex- ployed, and its veins of red granite the finest in the world duly admired, equally with the views from all sides and every elevation, there is the drive to Glenfmnan to be done The attraction here in the field on which the Young Pretenders flag was unfurled in August, 1745 A monument to his memory, raised by one of the great clan Macdonald, now marks the spot in the form of a memorial pill in Here was the nucleus of that force which Charles Edward raised and with which he marched more than half way to London, and might have got further had his generalship been as good as his cause After Glenfmnan, the tourist is advised to visit Glen Nevis, a wild highland glen in which is another of those curios, a vitrified of art It is explained to me that the meaning of such is a building in which fire instead of mortar was used to unite and solidify the stonework No crowbar could be got between stones so baked into a mass, and they were also better adapted for standing the shaking of battering rams The builders of the days of old were gigantic in their efforts in the useful equally with the beautiful Those of our day inner think of binding with even decently adhesive cement, the bricks of the ramshackle things that are now mostly put up the other excursion is to Fort William, opposite to Bonavista fortress built by Cromwell to keep watch and ward over the wild highland chieftains of that time it was rebuilt by the Third William under whom we warfare was turned into murder in the neighbouring Glen of the Coe Further inland is the old castle with which many names are connected, and near to which the land under Argyll and Montrose once fought I until they nearly cleared each other off the face of the country Scott tells us all about it in the Legend of Montrose Rose, as he has told all about every thing even in this district Folks take the Bible with them as a guide book to Palestine, and similarly they might bring Scott's prose and poetry as their best all along this route It is as much Scotts land as it is Scotland Mr journey up Ben Nevis was limited to that loworrangeof it on which grows pretty flower -the "bell heather ' as they call it here, and perhaps elsewhere. It was altogether a fair or heather than I had seen before and worthy of the noble mountain on which it grew Sprigs of 11 were afterm area enveloped by mcatthoLocheil Arms and thence posted to every far away Scotsman that I could remember including many at the antipodes If they had the pleasure in receiving it that I had in getting at the time of trouble was not wasted leaving Banavie the steamer enters upon a chain of lochs and water connexions that on the map reminds me of nothing so much as the long street called Straight that on the plain of Damascus appears to run through that city This central waterway runs from the Irish to the North Sea for some sixty miles through a v they like course that beginning here finishes at Inverness Ino thirds or thereabouts of this Cile doman Canal as it is called are natu- nil la! es and the balance are canal cut connexions the first of which is that which joins Loch Lil to Loch I ochy-names which none but a Scotsman need try to pro i ounce so thoroughly throat are their sounds The ending of that loch in about twelve miles floats us into Loch Riches at fort and narrow affair of itself but leading n to that fine sheet of water the twenty five mile long Loch Ness Getting from Oich mt > Ness 13 however for the steamer only The passengers then do over an hours walk from Aberclialder to Fort Augustus while the boat works its way up seven locks-a word that must not be misread for lochs we have by this time got proper respect for the makers of this great w waterway) the first cost of which I am told was nearly a round million It took twenty five years of labour and was preliminarily opened in 1822 but found not to pay working expenses The Government lent its aid in 1843, and spent another quarter of a million on deepening and improv. ing the canal, but as yet all to no money profit ' As away of opening the country to Allora such is myself it has been the greatest success, and brings blessings, if nothing else, to its promoters If it be more blessed to give this to receive the proof is at once per cci v able By the sides of Loch Oich the scenery is of a Svvisshke charact<>r-rjuito Alpine and pleasing To the north are the Glengarry mountains, to which runs the valley of the Garry from the loch side Here stands a monument erected by the last Glen garry chieftain to commemorate something that had better been forgotten, especially is it occurred as long ago as the 15th century. Two sons of the great house of Keppoch were abroad when their father hereabout died Sep, co of their cousins administered to the estate in the absence of the heirs, and murdered them on their return Lynch law was thenrecogniBedas right, and was executed on the red handed seventy the Glengarry chieftain of the time, whose successor so com- memorates the retribution, and who on this monument is called the " 17th Mac sire Malster -a goodly tribute to the pride of long descent Loch Rich is the highest point of the journey, and a hundred feet above the level of the canal s starting point We have got to Fort Augustus long before our steamer has finished its watery staircase way, and find here a similar fort to that seen opposite Banavie, and built for the like cause A prettily-situated village adjoins it, in which we met a very primitive sort of people. The doors of what represented the tavern and the post office were closed, and not opened in any hurry to our knocking The strange request was made to us with the whisky that we got here that we would be good enough to drink it outside the landlord's licence not permitting otherwise As the main street of this village of CiUChuiman was the only one, and showed not a soul in the whole length of it, the eccentric drinking proceeding so requested passed unnoticed It would have made little difference had the whole population, which a blanket might possibly cover, been out and about On Loch Ness, that we have next entered upon, we have no objection to being detained any time It runs through what is in this, " the prime of summer time, one of the pleasantest of valleys On either side it is well wooded with trees that are of all varieties of beauty in form of growth and colour of foliage. Some thirteen miles after leaving the alfresco drinking village our vessel drops anchor at the junction of the River I oy era with Loch Ness We are here made what sailors call liberty men" for an hour or more that we may go see the chief tion of the loch-the Fall of Koj ers As we start without any inquiry about trouble to come, we have to suffer like all those who do similarly. Not a word of advice on the subject is given to the tourist, who has a "Hill of Difficulty," in Bunjan'a language, to surmount, that puts him in a bad humour for the really fine Bight that awaits him It is quite a "pipe opener," as a companion phrases it, to do the burst that we accomplish in half an hour. A beating heart and panting lungs interfere much with proper admiration Itstoppedall expressions about it and now for a good ten minutes, and so gave time for forming an opinion before expressing it. I had seen all the waterfalls in the English Lake district within the same month, and so allowing for the superior wetness of the Highlands, could give Ifojera Tall its due w materials are peculiarly matters of taste, and therefore quite things to quarrel about. I am guilty of the heresy of believing that this Scottish fall is, all things considered, more picturesque than anything in that way that England has to show The quantity of water descending in this dry month of August is not large, but is so artistically arranged by nature's great scenic artist as to produce an effect quite out of proportion to the cause It bursts upon the view some ninety feet above the plateau that forms one's standing place-coming so into sight through a loophole or window in the rock, and not tumbling, as usual with waterfalls, from over the top The stream descends thence for a great depth sheer down an opening that widens to meet the width of its spread as it descends The rocks retire on each side some hundreds of feet, as if to give to the world a full view of the uno watery effect produced. In rainy seasons this fall may have a greater volume of water, but the view would then be marred from the want of those great aids of a sunshine and blue sky with which I am favoured Wet and cloudy weather have also damaging effects upon the spirits of the visitor. Foyer Full can well hold its own among the waterfalls of the world, and deserves a longer visit than time permits to such tourists as myself As to the toil of the steep ascent, we learnt, when too late, that horses might have been hired from the starting point Looking down upon this fall is the mountain peak of Mealfourvome, of three thousand feet high, finished off at the foot, of " turned up ' as ladies would say, with the ruins of some fine old castle The coup c and altogether is what a painter would regard as a fine show of well grouped scenery. ever good cause indeed for the travellers turning aside on his journey is found in this picturesque Tall of Foyers In a book that a fellow-passenger has I read that the road through this valley of Loch Ness was that made for military purposes by General Wade, whose divelhngduring that period is pointed out as at a little distance from Tojers The general never was much that I know of, and is nothing now save through a poets aid His road has been superseded by the canal, but a genius has given him a lasting fame that greater performances have failed to achieve It was of this man and this road that an Irish engineer and poet combined, who was employed on the works, wrote the world famous couplet that tells how we should have raised our hands and blessed General Wade ' had we seen that road before it was made Monuments of granite and millions of money could not have done as much to perpetuate the general s name The last stoppage of our vessel previously to its coming to its final moorings is in a widened stretch of Loch Ness called Urquhart Bay Here we are landed at J. jetty, and go drink at an inn mainly because of its comical name of "the Drum na drought We diluted the whisky here with the water of the loch, and drank to the pleasant memories of it and the whole chain of its sister lochs up which we had that day come 3 entering next upon Loch Dochfour, we have, upon reaching the end of it, again to enter the canal on our way to Muirtown and its landing place Arrived there, we come to an anchor, having passed through some of the finest scenery in Scotland, and reached Inverness, just inland from this point Muirtown is but a mile or so distant from that capital of the Highlands, to which the rest of the journey is done upon wheels We are fitly welcomed by a drenching shower of rain, that we are only glad did not come sooner in the day
