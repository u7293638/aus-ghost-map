Cypress. Moonligfcfc, and love, and magnolia trees; A bare, -gray house on a lonely hill; A river below, with the sweep of seas ; An air of stillness, bo strangely Btill— So still ox trouble or strafe or star, I heard my heart as it beat for hex. Her lover and she and the oypcees trees ; And I? Alone by the black lagoon — A plaoe of ghosts and of mysteries — Lake lilies upheld to the loveless moon ; The darkness slain by the sword of day And under the cypress trees hidden away. Her wondrous hair ! Her eyes ware as large As torch-loat deer's, that feeding in moss. And seeing the light in the irontman's barge, Lifts up its head and comes wading aoroes. Wide-eyed and dased, and reaohes ite bead— Trusting and reaching— and so, shot dead i ' The cypress is secret as death,' Saifi I, . And Death, he is nearer to me than gold.' So the cypress woods and the ware hard by Hare many and many a secret to hold — For why did she turn to the wood and the wave And look and look as in dead love's grave?
