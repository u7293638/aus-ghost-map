Then indeed all marvelled, for the name that the Duke. spoke was the name by which that Princess who had been his wife and was dead had been called and they perceived that His Highness, overcome by his sickness, had lost discernment, and conceived the Lady Lucia to be not herself, but the spirit of his dead love come to him from Heaven, to which delusion her white robes and her deathlike pallor might well incline him And now the wonder and fear left his face, and there came in place of them a great joy and rapture, so that had sunk eyes gleamed, his lips quivered, and he beckoned with his hand, murmuring, "I am ready, I am ready, Marghanta i ' And while this passed, all who were too distant to hear the Dukes word wondered that the aynal care not, but supposed that the Lady Lucia had interceded for Count Antonio, and that his Highness was now -away sang her prayer , some hoped that he would grant it And Antonio stood on the scaffold between the Lord Lorenzo and the executioner, and his eyes were set on Lucia Then the Duke spoke again to the Lady Lucia, saying "I have been lonely-very lonely How pure your face is my sweet Come to me I cannot come to you, for I am very sick ' And he held out his hand towards her again But she was now very bewildered, for she could not understand the words which His Highness used to her, and she looked round seeking someone who might tell her what she) meant, but none moved from his place or came near to her and at last she found voice enough to say in soft tones, " Antonio, my lord, the Count Antonio I " Aye, I know that you loved him," said the Duke. But since then he has done great crimes, and he must die. Yet speak not of him now, but come here to me, Mar ghan ta." Then with was erina; steps she came towards byn, mounting the first of the steps, and she said, "I know not what you would my lord, nor why you call me by the name of Marghanta. I am Lucia, and I come to ask Antonio's life." "Lucia, Lucas,' said he, and his face grew doubtful "Nay, but you are, my Mar ghosts," he said. " No, my lord, ' she answered, as with wavering, uncertain steps she mounted till she stood but one step below where his couch was placed, and then she fell on her knees on the highest step and clasped her hands, crying, "Have mercy my lord, have mercy I think my dear lord, how I love him For if he dies I must die also, my lord Ah, my lord, you have known lost You loved our sweet Lady Mnighnritti-waa not her name now on your lips' be I love Antonio-30 he loves me Ah, my lord. Christ Jesus teaches pit) " And she buried her face in her hands and sobbed 'when the Duke his physician, and now the Master of the Household, also supporting him, stretched himself over the edge of his couch, and, putting out his hand with feverish strength, plucked the Lady Lucia's hands away from her lace and gazed at her face And when he had pared a moment, he gave a great cry, "Ah, God, and flung his arms up above his head and tell back into the arms of his physician, who laid him down on his couch, where he lay) motionless, his eyes shut and his chin resting on his breast And all looked at the physician, and he answered, Nay, he is not dead yet " Mrs) carries the signal * " asked Antonio of LorenZo on the scaffold "It must be that the Lady) Lucia beseeches him for your life, in) lord, answered Lorenzo ' Indeed, I wish the Duke would hearken to her prn) er. ' He will not turn for her said Antonio But presently the report of what had passed spread, from those round the Duke to the pikemen, and they, loving marvel as most men do, must needs tell it to the people, and a murmur of v order arose, and the report reached the guards at the scaffold who came and told Lorenzo in the hearing of Antonio of the strange delusion that had come upon the Duke ' He must be sick to death," said Lorenzo "I pray) not," said Count Antonio for though he is in stern man, yet he is an able and just prince, and this fancy of his 13 very pitiful " Do you spare pity for him asked Lorenzo " Shall not I pit) all who have lost their lives ' ' answered Antonio with a smile and his eye rested on the form of the Lady) Lucia kneeling by the Duke s couch for hard on half an hour the Duke lay as he had fallen, but at last, his physician having used all his skill to rouse him, he opened his eyes and he clutched his ph) scrum 3 hand and pointed to Lucia, asking "WhoiBBhe? ' "It is the Lady) Lucia, my lord," answered the physician. ' And there was none else' ' asked the Duke in a low tremulous whisper I saw no other my lord " " But I saw her, said the Duke " I saw her even as I saw her last, when she lay on her bed, and they took the child out of her dead arms "It was the weakness of your malady, my lord, that made the union before your CCB" "Alas was it no more? ' moaned the Duke " linked I am very weak there is a blur before my eyes I cannot see who this lady is that kneels before me a 10 la alive and what ails her And having said this in fretful weary tones, he lay back on his pillow (gasping then the Master of the Household came forward and said to him "My lord, this is the I nily Lucia, and she lengths before your Highness praying for the life of Count -house, because she lost as rum " Now, the name of Count Antonio when spoken to him roused the Duke more than all the ministrations of his physicians He roused himself once again, crying ' Oh, Antonio I I had forgotten Antonio Does he still live? "your Highness has not given the signal for his death ' Have I not Then here-' He had to see his hand, but with a great or the Lady butta sprang forward and si and his band before he could raise it kneeling to it cr) tng ' No no, my lord no no no I " And the Duke had no strength, to King her off" but he gasped, 'free it from her I" And the Master of the House hold, terrified lest in her passion she should do violence to His Highness, roughly tore her hands from the Duke's hand, and the Duke released, sat upon his couch and he suit) of 11 strange hard voice that was heard of all, even to the scaffold, and jet seemed not the voice that they 'knew as his " Let Antonio- ' But then he stopped, he choked in his throat, and cutting at his shirt, tore it loose from him 'Jet Antonio -1 ' he cried again, Let Antonio-' And he sat there for an instant, and his eyes drew him, the intelligence di parting from them Once again he opened his lips but nothing came from them Bade a gasp, and with a thud ho ttll Mick on his pillows, and having rolled once on his side turned again on his back and he) still And to treat hush fell on every man in the square, and they looked on one another a faces but found no answer for Valentine, Duke and Lord of Farmilo, was dr all of him mokncBs at the moment when he had wing in to send Antonio to death. Thus marvellously did Heaven in its high purposes deal with him. " UM Higlinriisii deni!,"until the physicians. And the Master of the Household, in his Only was, came to the front of the 1 luke's touch, and, standing them before all the people, broke the wand of his office and let the broken fragments full upon the marble steps, and he cried aloud ''Hear all of you I It hath pleased Almighty God to take unto Himself flic wife of the noble and illustrious Prince Valentine, Duke and Lord of 1 'ormolu. May his soul find piece I" But there came from the people no answer- ing city of "Amen," I.N, according to the custom of the Duchy, it should have come. Koi they were married at the manner of this death, and many crossed themselves in fear, and women sobbed. And Lorenzo, standing on theecuflolil by Antonio, was struck with wonder and fear, and clutched Autotuo'a arm, cr) tug, "Can it be that the Duke is dead V And Antonio bowed his head, answering, "MayChrist receive his soul I" Then the Master of the Household came forward again and cried, " 1 four, all of you According to the high pleasure and appoint extent of Almighty God, the noble and illustrious Prince, Valentine Second of that Name is from this hour Duke and Lord of Copyright.

For Ben, seeing what was done, and knowing that the Duke was dead, had glanced at the pike men who stood near, and when he saw that they looked not at him, but towards where the Master of the Household stood he sprang forward and ran like a deer to the scaffold, and he leapt up to the scaffold before any could hinder him, and he cried in a mighty loud voice, saying 13) what warrant do you hold my) lord a prisoner ' And the apprentices roused a great cheer, and with one accord pressed upon the pike man, who, called b) all that had passed gave way before them and the apprentices broke their bounds and surged like a wave of water up to the foot of the scaffold, shouting Antonio's name And the young lord who held Tommaso came with him and broke through and reached the scaffold 1 or they feared for Lorenzo and )etvivould not let Tommaso go and Lorenzo was sore at a loss, but he drew his sword and cried that he would also) in) man that touched Antonio until the light of the matter should be known ' Indeed, if you will give me a sword I will slay him myself," said Antonio "For I stand here by my own will and according to the promise I gave to the Duke, and if there be lawful authority to hang me, hang me, but is not dispose of are as the laws of the Duchy bid "I have no authority), 'sud Lorenzo, for the Duke gave none, and now he is dead " Then the Count Antonio fastened his shirt again about his neck and put on his doublet, and he signed to hens to stand on one side of him, and he bade the young lords loose Tomtnusino And he said to Lorenzo, "Let us go together to the palace " And now he was smiling Then they came down from the scaffold and passed across the square, a great multitude following them And when they came to the steps of the palace the Duke's body was covered with a rich brocaded cloth that some hand had brought from his cabinet, and the little Duke stood there, with his hand in the Master of the House hold a hand, and the child was weeping bitterly, for he was very frightened And over against him stood the Lady) Lucia, motionless as though she had been turned to stone, for the strange thing that had come about through her approaching of the Duke had bewildered her brain But when the boy Baw Antonio he let go the hand he held and tan to Antonio and leapt into his arms 'then Antonio lifted him and showed him to the people, who had him for Duke and Antonio set him down and knelt before him and kissed his hand And the child cried, " Now that my father is dead, Antonio, you must not go on your journey, but you must stay with me For if I am Duke I must learn to use my sword without delay), and no man but you shall teach me " " Shall I not go on my journey, my lord ' ' asked Antonio "No, you shall not go," said the little Duke Then Antonio turned to the lords who stood round and said "Behold, my lords, his Highness pardon me But the lords doubted, and they said to Antonio isa) but he does not know what he does in pardomngjou He understands as well I think said 1 Antonio as his father understood when he sent me to death In heed my lords it is not children only who know not what the) do paint tins sp eclt lommasmosmiled and Bena laughter 1 grumble But the lords adding, Antonio rest where he was till the returned retire with the little Duke into the palace and sent word hastily to the Archbishop that he should join them there and deliberate with them as to what it might be best to do And when they were thus gone in Antonio said I may not move but the Lady) Lucia is free to move when 1 ominas no went to the lady and spoke to her softly telling her that Antonio desired to speak with her and she gave Tommaso her hand and he led her to Antonio, who stood within the portico screened from the sight of the people And there they were left alone But meanwhile the whole body of the townsmen and the apprentices had gathered before the place and their one cry was for Antonio For the fear of the Duke being no longer upon them and the pikemen not know ing w horn to obey and being therefore dis- ordered the people are very bold and they had stormed up to tee had not one come to Antonio and implored him tosh wv himself that the people might know that he was wife therefore he came forward with the Lady Lucia who was now no more beware fired nor petrified with fear or astonishment but was weeping with her eyes and smiling with her lips and clinging to Antonio s arm And when the people saw them thus they sent up it went about that was heard far beyond the city walls and the apprenticed lads turned and ran in a body across the square and Bivarmc 1 on to the scaffold And then and there they plucked down the gibbet and worked so fiercely that in the space of half an hour there was none of it left And now the Archbishop with the lords came forth from the council chamber and the little Duke with them And the) caused the servants to remove the body of the dead Duke and thus set his son on a high seat, and put a sceptre in his hand And the Archbishop others I up to prayer before the people and having done this he turned to I Antonio and said- I Al) lord Antonio, most anxiously uns his Highness and we of his Council considered of this matter and it has seemed to us all -our) own in truth was the sole reluctant voice, and now I also am brought to the same mind-that whereas the virtuous purposes of Princes are meet to be remembered and made perpetual by faithful fulfilment after their death jet the errors of which the, being mortal, are guilty should not over five Hum nor he suffered to endure when they have passed away) And though we are not blind to your offences jctwejudgi that of the be ginning the fault was not yours therefore His Highness decrees your pardon for all offences against his civil state and power And I myself, who hold authority other than) until I) might, seeing in what this day has witnessed, the finger of God Himself do not fight against it, but will pray son as soon as you may lit yourself thereunto h) prayer and meditation, became m ty humble mind and back again the blessing of the church J 61 in what you did right and in what you outstepped right God Himself must one day judge, and I will seek to judge of it no more My lord said Antonio "I have done much wrong Yet I will own no wrong in the matter of the Abbot nor in that of the is feared Bones But the Lord Archbishop Smiled at Antonio and Antonio bent and kissed the ring that was on his knees and the old man laid his hand for a moment on Antonio a hen I, saying; "It may be that God works some times in wrists that I may not see Thus then it was that the Count Antonio was restored to his place and came again to Kornioiu. Having been refused of the sen- tence of excommunication that had been laid upon him, he was wedded in the Cathedral to the Lady Lucia, soon as the days of mourning for the Duke had passed. And great was the joy in the city at their wedding, for ever) maid and every) man sing in the triumph of Antonio's love n sign of the favour of heaven to those who love with a pure and abiding passion So they made great feasts, and were marvellously inert) and Bena ht not the day go by without plighting his troth to a corner) damsel, saying with twinkle in his eye that the Count Antonio would have need of his tons, whose services he had promised to him as they rode together across the plain on the morning when Antonio had supposed that he was to die. Nor would liens give any other reason whatsoever for the marriage. Nevertheless it is likely that there were others, But by hellier Ben i fulfilled his promise I know not, for us I have said, 80 little is known concerning him that his true name does not survive, and it has proved an impossible thing to listen cr «vhethiran« of his descendants yet Ino in 1 01 niola If it about that they do, I trust that they fight as well and serves as loyal) and prit) better than he.
