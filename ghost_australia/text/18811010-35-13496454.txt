MILITARY DEFENCES COMMISSION, so The Colonel. Ajtobbsox's EvmBn'oe. Colonel Anderson was in favour of an extended volunteer force throughout the colony of New South Wales, and considered that they; should be no difference made as to the allowances, be given to one portion more than another. it further consider, he said that the position of gentlemen holding commissions should entail a certain amount of expense whit h they should be able to defray out of their own pocket s before they place themselves in a position which is inevitably attended with expenditure I do not mean in this to include horse allowance for mounted duties. I am in questionably of opinion that no attendance at drill, camp vc , Bhockl entail the necessity of personal expenditure but I am equally against anything like profit being derived from the services of a volunteer I usethewonj volunteer' in contradistinction to militias," L upon the subject of the composition and strength of a fiel x force required to resist land attacks Colonel Anderson gave evidence as follows - From the information I have been able to gather chiefly from the commandant of New South Wales and the other officers questioned, I infer that some 3000 men are required in addition to the permanent form of artillery, which the officers of that arm deem necessary not only of or the preparation of guns, and artillery and torpedo material of war in time of peace but also for the manning of the guns in times will think 'twill be for the commandant to decide" as to tL a proportions of each branch -cavalry volunteer artillery, engineers, and infantry, always presuming that the commandant would stay erect a his discretion such signal parties as were necessary to be proved to the use of the field force from all forces under his command The exigencies of this colony come to point out that a militia ' free of infantry should be screened ed and maintained. 1 consider the present organized son of infantry as a ftf'o a militia force, and I cannot reconcile to myself that it should bear the designation, of a Volunteer force, inasmuch as it is perfectly dear to me that the members thereof officers included, are serving in consideration of the e_ola_'_ts they receive I therefore, individually, should prefer that such a force should not be called a volunteer force I have no objection to the term ' volunteer militia ' I am most strongly of opinion, irre#pÂ«-+ive ->* a pT_tane_t force, that the only way of man among the absolutely required martial spirit throughout the _e colonies is by a provision for either purely an Aztec- force or some such system as I understand p evada u So ath Austral under the designa- tion of nue companies But I am equally clear that these companies should be definitely under the control of the commandant, and that there should be no intervening power between them and he commandant In fact I regard the proposition or nine companies as another name" for pure volunteers, and reduce sing that the Government provide] these rifle companies with any Government assistance, such as arm the no new associations should have the slightest power to interfere as to her unitary organization Asia the constitution of the held force, and irrespective of the infantry force who h may be considered necessary to be maintained on a militia system I am strongly in favour of a volunteer force being encourage _ throughout the colony. Generally speaking, I should recommend Tat <t regiment of cavalry one troop to be nurses in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis ("sydney), trained entirely to the duties of mounted riflemen s -outs he and six troops raised in such districts is the con man but may point out as being easily available for his purpose of defence the number of troop not to exceed for the capitation allowance more as they effectives unless when a troop has provided horses for a gun "at its own ex arise when owed to extra to be allowed I is not due as fourteen years' experience of this sy them that is _ owing a gun to each troop of cavalry to- t "Of, only does the article drill fabric an interesting break in the course" of training but the system has never failed at ant gener I muster of the trace of. It my command to the extent that could obtain from the cavalry a battery,, full for ed without a farthing" s expense at the Government and it has cross a the -richest country that we have ever- had toops mustered upon in S tons I do not presume for r moment to say in a battle by so formed as he- is there "degree sales are equal horse artillery, but I will say that, inasmuch as it he members of the gaol schemes are Down ed I have found great velocity of move bent over tassels catches them of which nee Elsa live a our colonies, cannot all be round 1, and I think I have had but one accident over the ro ghost ground worn the up. sting of a gun carries 3, with regard to the only class from which a cavalry force from the coal it can be procured, inasmuch as the volunteer not only gives his own services but also those of the horse for his military obligations-the yeoman class settled upon the land I consider the introduction of that class of the greatest importance to any colonial force I have heard the remarks of the other members he Commission as to a preooudctvnee on' the head artillery "element being re quiet in these colonies a report of a Dove hat in his Maje v sorry- am I que app schedule the reasons given; for his by Colonel Downes Colonel beat Eley, and CoioreJ Isobel s So much has this been felt by me heretofore that I have no less than three batteries of field, artillery, and one formed from the can in the force of, Bay 8800 met maintained by the colony of Victoria My experience goes to show that the in has infantry force should are the ed to the lowest number man _ the commandant may think St to provide for but that the volunteer 'force gener "lay throughout the colonies should be extended as far as possible in the "centre i of popular n But I would not allow a single man offi er or private outside of the permanent or militia force to have it said of him that he derives the slightest personal emolument for coming- forward to do his duty as a citizen in therefore of his country I further consider that all perm merely paid officers whether on the staff or belonging to the permanent establishment, should be available for all round duties at the discretion of the command it and that it would be wise to avoid the institution of special appointments for an. ones which the China mandant may see the way to p vide for by assigning them, to the paid officers I repeat that gentlemen proffering their services and accepting, their- commissions as volunteer officers should be in a costeen to .. the expenses which are inevitably incidental to their nk ' In speaking of the term of examination which he would recommend for appointments and promotions in the military forces of the Australian colonies first in a permanent force and secondly in the answer force he said -' for the permanent forces I think that the previous evidence of the military officers of the sub-committee tends to show the nature of the examination, and the exemption therefrom on behalf ex-Imperial officers, on first appointment I do not think it possible to carry out in its strict integrity the examination laid down for her Majesty a service for promotions in the corresponding branch of the imperial service-that is Artillery. I am rather inclined to think it will be found of use if the officers of the permanent force should be required as a matter of duty to make reconnaissances rough military sketches, and to give their idea in writing of their views as to the defence and pra to bility of roads, approaches, 23., for all branches of the service, and that these said reports, sketches, c , should have, admired by the Commandant from time to time, so that he might be enabled to form an opinion of the capabilities of each individual officer, than must certainly no such officer should receive promotion until he had passed a course of examination modified by the Commandant from the imperial system The exigencies of these colonies do not require the very high standard demanded from the scientific branches of her Majesty s army which are more calculated with regard to the probability of their serving in foreign lands than for merely their drill dunes with their own arm I therefore consider in the examination for promotion of the permanent artillery officers greater stress should be laid upon a knowledge of artillery work, pure and simple, of their guns, and of the appliances and appurtenances directly or indirectly connected there with With respect to the officers seeking to be made field officers, I think that a knowledge of tactics strategy, and the support which the three arms of the service are expected to give one to the other should be in addition required For a volunteer force I am of opinion that in many cases it is very desirable to give commissions in the first instance without any examin- mon whatever It is impossible to avoid the element of personal and local influence; in the formation of a new corps men many locality naturally look up to one in whom they have confluence as a leading citizen It is not here out of place to say that whilst I hold very strong opinions as to the practice of nomination by volunteers for any rank above that of non-commissioned officer 1 most emphatically declare that it is destructive to all discipline it volunteers have any voice in the selection of officers or sugar r rank such as captains, Sec I think the examination fa chiefs of the volunteer force, in the first minute shall t>, more of an educational one so that illit r o m n may not obtain commissions Following on a plan year having passed the educational test which makes him eligible for a commission and his time being duly registered as such, lam then, in favor or one or two courses and I could not say which will work best either just before he obtains his commission he should be able to use, a technical examination in military nut e is not made too severe, for his first grade as officer, subsequent examinations being "required for advancement of the other course is that he should be merely given in the first inst since an acting appointment; and the conferring of it is pure elements should, in my opinion, entirely rest with t_, to Gaudaur, as, it stops with rain under the Act under waco i Servia The officer so appointed to an acting eÂ«o_i_ission should be subject to passing an examination o ith on parade and by set questions, but I am very much of opinion was a practical examination or parade will be round the best The officer so passing should then have his acting commission converted into a substantive one Colonel Anderson consid for it was desirable to have a reserve force of arts! let v composed of men who have passed though the permanent force and recommended a permanent or later force of bet on SW) and 400 men until time permitted of the formation of a reserve A permanent infantry force he did not think necessary. The questioned meeting the case of it on who were anxious to join the volunteer more especially in the country districts, was referred to him, and in reply he said " I would not permit The formation of any volunteer corps except its services could be immediately an area! It by railway or other speeds; coral formation with the metropolis I have no objection whatever to urge against the formation of rifle companies, provided always that they are under the control of the officer commanding the local forces, but I see very clearly that great waste of money will be the inevitable result of providing such companies with arms and accoutrements These rifles companies will not be content, however they may have commenced, without finally obtaining the modern arm of the British army This may be taken to cost in this colony about a few per rifle, and it is impossible to ___Â£._? but that with a lastex population not to might be sustained by the issue of such arms without proper discipline and supervision." The last part of his evidence, which it is necessary to quote, related to the question of a reduction in the annual military expenditure of: this colony. He was asked "Do you think that a reduction in the annual military expenditure could be effected, having due regard to the efficiency of the military force, and without material injury to the service i"' \- and he answered, " I consider it impossible that the Commandant can entertain this question until that portion of the volunteer force, the Naval Brigade, is by law made to conform to the same standard of drill and efficiency (including the giving up of time during working hours to which the trained and paid volunteer forces are subject It is beyond question that the men | serving in that corps are placed at a great disadvantage over the rest of the volunteer force of i s- which they are members, inasmuch as, shown by the evidence received by the commission, they are not called , upon to make any sacrifice of their working hours. However, I consider that given the fact that the Government will place them in the same category and condition as their brother volunteers, the Commandant could make rc v auctions. I observe by the study of the estimates of expenditure that a larger expenditure is hIioavh than actually exists, inasmuch as, for the year 1888, no less a sum than j Â£10,000 has lapsed to the revenue, but which still remains , as a charge on the military department in the public view ,'. generally. I am of opinion that a, reduction could be made also in the Ordnance Department and I refer to my evidence, there showing that, to my mind, the Commandant . will see his way to make a reduction on the annual cost . per man of his trained and paid volunteer force."
