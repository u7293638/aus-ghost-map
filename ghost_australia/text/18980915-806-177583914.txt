FLOUTING THE COUNTRY AND SLANDERING ITS WOMEN. The country and the Legislative Assembly have again been flouted by the Legislative Council. Notwithstanding that the Council has just exhibited to the country the spectacle of 14 members walking in without anybody qualified to do so considering it worth while to put any of them to the test of an elec tion, a majority of this chamber is just as certain as over that it is quite safe to thwart the will of the people, and throw back in their teeth measures that have been passed as the Women’s Franchise Bill was by a majority of 2 to 1 of the people’s elected representatives. How for its own credit anil its own self-respect, the Legislative .As sembly puts up with this things is one of those mysteries as difficult to unravel as the identity of the Bendigo ghost or the; sacred nugget of JKanowno. It is not as if votes were demanded for the women of the colony for the Legislative Council. Practically no one in Victoria has a. vote for the Legislative Council, Tliis chamber should therefore be very silent and modest on such a delicate subject. But; instead of being so they are diotatoi ini and tyrannical—very much after -the style of ; tyrants engaged in the not altogether useless., or unprofitable task bf digging their own graves. The Legislative Assembly has over and over again, and tho country has over and over again declared that tho women of Victoria shall have votes for the Legisla tive Assembly. What moral rigid has the Legislative Council to say that they shall not be enfranchised? They have no morla right to say so, bub os a piece of utter foolishness on one side; and cunning State craft on the other perpetuated during the last generation; when the original Constitu tion Act of Victoria was drawn up, tho Legislative Council bias the legal right of act ing as it acts. There is a great distinction however, between justice and law, and the., same.power which made a law can also make another law to replace or supersede it. All these things will be remembered against the., Legislative Council so soon as the massed of tho people see what ,th& more, observant of the people have seen for a lbng timc,- that the cup. of its iniquities is full. ; Yet it must not bo Overlooked that; there are not a lew men even in the Upper House who are quite amenable to rcaspn and justice. We were pleased to see'two of the members for tho Northern Province supporting liberal and progressive legislation as exemplified by the 1 Women's Suffrage Bill, but wo were very sorry to notice that the other two toot sides, on tho question with tho back- numbered Conservatives of tho House. ' Because Orientalism which 'still sits as a curse and a shackle. on*tso much of European civilization and progress denies to women equal rights and equal stains with men, women in Victoria in the closing years' of tho 19th century are to bo-denied tho, simplest rights of citizenship, “ To keep them in countenance, tho members of the Legislative Council who voted against- the enfranchisement''of' women, and therefore voted for the. maintenance of tho Oriental superstition of tho inferiority-of women—to keep them in countenance, these members should have had a few Chinese and Coreans in tho galleries to applaud them as they crossed the floor. The yote that they gave, on the subject , was worthier of an assem blage of semi- barbaric Chinese,and Coreans than of white men who have enjoyed the advantages of living under free-institutions. Their mental calibre, as also an insight into their way of looking at matters, can bo gathered from tho extraordinary utterances of one of them who is styled the Mon. 0. J. Cam pell He has the brazen impudence, to declare tbnt th enfranchisement of the women of Victoria L only asked for by a few agitators and “un - fortunates.” What docs'tlio man mean? ;Is ho in his right senses ? Is he in his dotage ? Does Jib know what he is saying ? Is lie a fair sample of the intellect and court ■ lincss of the House of which, somehow or other, he became a member ’ Whoever he is, he has a most slanderous tongue "Many of these (meaning thereby lewd ami intfigu ing women) 'had members of PaiHamon: under their thumbs, and when they (tin. fallen women) got votes would have double jrower over them !” Adopting this aged scan dal-monger’s logic, would, it .be fair to ask wither the fear of enfranchising women of the class alleged influenced many of Mr. Campbell's friends to vote against the hill— so that the said women would not have '‘double power over them?” Wo do not take the spluttering old horse-dealer sori iously, and perhaps neither did pther mem bers. If, however, any one, does take him seriously, what ho said is the severest and most shameful reflection that has yet been uttered against the private characters of members of Parliament—that they arc under the thumbs of disreputable women. It would he exhilarating to leam whether this very honorable gentleman- means that mom bora of Parliament are under monetary ob ligations to such women, as has been said in regard to the Totalizator Bill of certain members and the bookmakers, or whether the obligations' are of another hut cquklly degrading kind. Had members no ! respect for themselves or for Parliament that they did not stop him vaporing and pouring out. his low-pitched scandals? It is a thousand pities that the political and social and family progress of Victoria sho.uld ho ,at mercy, of such silly, bod-tongued old menAnd their associates. 1 .
