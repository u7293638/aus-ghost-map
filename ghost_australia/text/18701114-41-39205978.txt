Each vertical and horizontal line of these squares gives 130, and the diagonals of each amount to 126 and 134 respectively. — Q. E. D. Mr. Catlow, -who propounded the problem, sent with it four specimen squares, Beta haa furnished two others, Zero, R. J- L.- Qneenstownian, and P. P. Wilpena, one each. 1.003.

The stone would reach the ground in 11 seconds, and fall 1,452 feet from the Btarting point of the balloon. — Correct answers by Tempo and Francis Duffield -T '1,005. It was required to find the length of two lines drawn from a point in one of the sides of a square of 10 X 10 inches, the point being three inches from one of the corners. The lines were to be at right angles with each other, and were to cut off a por tion of the square, so as to leave the greatest possible area. Mr. Hansen sent this pro blem, and has pointed out the singular fact that, wherever the point may be from which the lines are drawn, they will necessarily be equal to each other. In this instance each is V6157 + inches. Tempo gives 15*21 -}- inches as the length of both lines, which it will be seen is very nearly correct. Francis Duffield and Cynic give the exact dimen sions, showing that the two sides of each section forming the right angle are seven and three inches respectively, and hence that the remaining area is 102 — 21=* 79 inches. It also follows that the length of the cuts are each ^ (7s -f- 3a) = 7 '6157 -j- inches, as given above. NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE.
