Hawaiian Superstition- JL Verandah ChaU BY BELLE OSBOURN'E. " What a superstitious lot these Kanakas are I" says Joe, who is stretched out in the bamboo chair on the verandah, the moonlight throwing the shadow of tae vines over hia long figure clad in white linen; " if they have the toothache, aud it rainc, why, heaven weeps in sympathy ; if the little leiii steals the raw fish of his grandmother, bang goes the thunder, and heaven is angry." "They never seem to think,"says the navy officer, drowsily, from the hammock, " that if heaven wept with everyone who had tho heartache, by Jove I this would be a pretty damp place to live in 1" I am sitting on the verandah steps, idly watching the moonlight on the mango, •urely the most beautiful tiee that grows, almost too perfect in shape, shadowy, with shining leaves. " Yea/'^J say, reflectively—bang 1 falls a mango o7 the roof—" they arc full of a tbousanrt little superstitious trickB and mysterieB : don't you know bow they pound little sticks into the ground before their enemies' houses?" '« What's that for?" from the hammo ck. " It brings death to any one who steps on them, Ob, they profess religion, and eing, and pray sincerely enough ; but aB sure as anything is the matter with them, they get frightened and send for their kahunas." " And what mieht a kahuna be 7" "Oh, those kahunasr Joe gives an impatient kick ; '• they make me tired 1 They do the awfulest things ! They arc a sort af doctor and priest combined, and everything they say all right. Kid falls into the fire and gets burnt. Kahuna comes, eats a piece of roasted black pig—" *, It is always a black pig," I interrupt, "and then they go to sleep and pretend to dream." "Who's telling this story?"—a man always thinks he can tell a story better than his wife—" When tie finishes his mummery with the black pig, or chicken, or cat, he heats a board red hot an 1 applies it to the burn. How on earth they explaiu matters, when the kid dies, I don't know." " The strangest thing to me," I remark, in a meek snubbed way, " is the anaana." " I've heard of that," said he of the brass buttons, lighting a cigarette, and giving a momentary Rembrandt effect of broad white forehead and straight nose, and then fading back into shadow; " but do you really believe it?" " Believe it 1 Why, the kahunas have in their power every Kanaka in the kingdom. If tbey suspect the priest going to anaana them, or pray them to death, they lie right down aud die. and not all the king's horses, or all the king's men, to say nothing of the white doctors, cansave them." ''Well, you know," from Joe, "Doctor Thompson says that he is absolutely powerless to save a man who is being prayed to death. He says he has tried to argue with them that their disease is not fatal and they can not die, but the} prove their side of the argument by giving up the ghost." " I remember when our ship was at Hilo," said the navy officer, " we heard of a native politician who got awfully angry at three men for not voting his ticket. He paid a kahuna a lot of money to anaana them. The three men defied him for a time, and swaggered about, pretending not to care, but they gave right up to the first ailment they had ; one died of a cold, another succumbed tothemumps, aud the third one simply Kiel the bucket because he realised that it his fate." " The}'predicted when Like-Lika^Was go ing to die," I chip in, " You ne^r saw her did you? She was young, brjgtit, gay, and the best looking of the tii^l family. She dressed fashionably, wawRueautiful waltzer, and spoke English firmly. She seemed to be above superstiUiSfi, and yet she died when they &aid; she hbu And wyTwaa that 7" ^ The lava flow stopped. \Ifc!$ggid not th .Jeath that _ . with the news that the l^wflard?' li^'stopped' the very hour when o^prjLp&ess;^-eaihed^ihri i„... last.

" Don't you remember when Frincc Lunalilo was buried?" save Joe; "mat was enough to make anybody superstitious." , , What was that V the navy ollioer sits up, h R 'ancing ar himself in the hammock so that the moonlight D — — glitters on his blonde head, "l'eli f ^ au .-.bout it "Ting-a ling—ting-a-ling!" •'It's only the telephone,"! say, as I go to the instrument, "Lieutenant B. wanted en hard the Aflajns™ "Oh, pshaw P from the hammock.

" Well, I say, curling up comfortably on the corner of the 6teps, "lie was au immense favorite, you know." " Yea, I know—jolly fellow—heard a lot of good stories about him." " When lie died, he was buried with great pomp, but for some reason or other his style of burial was afterward changed, and when his body was removed the natives asked the government for another salute of twentyfour guns, to which the answer came lhat they had already buried him with all tnt honors, and didn't propose to waste any more powder. The natives were hurt and indignant, and though a great storm came up, thousands followed his body to its last resting-place. As the cortege passed into the gates of the cemctery, the thunder burst forth, and everybody declares that twentyfour distinct claps were countcd.'" "Oh, take off one Clap," says the lieutenant, flippantly, as he looks for his hat. ' Well, I declare 1 is that rain 7 After this moonlight, who would have thought it! Well, good-bye. Aloha nui, as the natives say." " Good-bye. So sorry to have you go. You nee * Heaven weeps in sympathy.'"
