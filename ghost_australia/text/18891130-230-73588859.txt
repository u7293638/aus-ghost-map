There was a holy hermit once Lived by the river Nile, Who wore a very dirty shirt t And laid his plans out to convert A lazy crocodile. "All day upon the river bank ' You lie," said he, "quite snugly. You never look in holy books I t Or stir, except to yawn, which looks 'Particularly ugly." The reptile roused him at the words, . Which might have been in German, t Or double Dutch.. The hermit says- t " He's quite repenting of his ways, I He's swallowing my sermon.' t He wasn't; but he swallowed him The hermit sable shirted He smacked his lips upon the feast, I And in the" stomach of the beast, The hermit was " converted." 'C Wriggles had -some teeth, pulled lately, t and took cold in his jaw, which swelled until it looked like a prize water-melon. He poulticed it and bandaged it all to no I purpose, and walked the floor several nights I with it, quoting choice extracts from Bob Ingersoll's lectures, but all to no purpose; i it kept on swelling. The other morning he remarked to his wife that he'd give Â£10 to anyone that would hit him a tremendous i thump on it suddenly, without expecting it, to see if it would not burst the swelling. ( The dear woman, smiling to herself, went and gathered a booftjack, and stepping up quietly behind the old man as he was trying to strain some coffee through his teeth, lovingly enquired-" Where does it pain you most, Wrig ?" "Oh lord I right here, right here," replied he, as he turned his jaw up and pointed to the apex of the protuberance. Taking a step back, the dear woman raised the bootjack 'on high and hit him a' regular bungstarter right in the centre of the calamity, and smilingly stepped back to await results. ' The old man's knees flew to his chin as he shut up like a patent rat-trap, and with a hollow groan he rolled off the chair on to the floor. But he was up in. a moment, and as he danced the can.can with original variations, his wife'smilingly asked -" Did it relieve you, dear ? ".. And as he tried to howl out an answer, old Miss Pry, who had just dropped in, beat a hasty retreat. And. now the whole (neighb.rbool has it that Wriggles has got 'em again. Blonde lady : "I really don't know what to give my husband for his birthday." Brunette Lady: "' Why don't you give him a rest?" "Well, if my husband was hen pecked as much as yours--" "Excuse me. But you misunderstand me. I' mean a foot-rest." "Oh, excuse me. But, then, he has a very pretty foot-rest." " Let me see. He plays the violin, doesn't he? ' "Yes; he is considered a beautiful performer." " Well, why don't you give him a chin reet ? I'm quite sure sure he needs it." That settled it. The blonde lady and the brunette lady do I not converse now, as they perambulate in. different directions. " My young friend," said .the solemn passenger, as the young man wiped his lips and returned the bottle to his valise, " it is beyond my comprehension how anyone can find pleasure or gratification in a drink of whisky, such as you have just imbibed." "Yes, sir," reponded the young man, " and" is no good ; they a ant a load. But I believe in moderation, even at Cap time." " Well, Browne, how do you find your . self ?" . "Never lose myself. If I did, I suppose I'd advertise.' S"My papa's got some new horses 'and a nice new brougham."--" Well, my papa's going to buy a new yacht."-" And my manima's got a lovely new piano."-" Well \--w-well, my mamma's got acook that has stayed two weeks." A statistician has discovered that a man 60 years of age has devoted two years ten months and three days to buttoning on his collar.
