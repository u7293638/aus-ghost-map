SMcbej:. A BlPEOOIiATjyjj SPIRIT. Now, to understand the solemnity of this storyyoumUBt-hsheyethat-Hopkms ?was -a changed -our opinion. We weie then in •young geniuses', who ioped. to .soar -to lame on the wings of-art, the most-ima^inativii art of all, figure painting: and we knew and were glad to hail imagination wherever we, sawit. Besides.: as ®lair truly remarked,: Hopkins was jb. man whose vocationit- was .io make money, -somehow, on the Stock Exchange ; so. one anight as well lookfor imagination m a model engaged »t a shilling an hour. IThen-Bgain. the- maii's facewas.-sufficient to assuie you that lie was .not blessed with any such quality. It is a large face, rather flabby and sprinkled -with frcckles s the ••nose:is short" and; thick, and : hp;: • chin, ;and : cheeks, quite destitute of hair Eoptan's bpdy. too, is:almost inchncd. to corpulence; he dresses in, a, commonplace, manner, . his fingers are short ,and jhick; so I think we •may safely settle,.to start with, that 3Iopkins :is a very ordinary man, and has no imagination I scarcely ;remeniber ,how, we fii'st foregathered with Hopkins, fie was hardly the • man we should have chosen for -an intimate friend;, yet, at one tune, we saw a good -dealof him. In those.jolly old-days Uranlc and I lodged in modest rooms together and . shared a studio. I think Mr. Levi Solomon, the picture-dealer, to whom, when hardly pressed, we would sell a picture or two, brought him to us .as a gentleman who - desired a personal interviews It was; of course; against Solomon's secret wishes that the-introduction tookplace, • as the worthy Israelite did not approve of direct transactions between artist and collector butHopkins was -doubtless a good-customer and stood -firm; so one vday Solomon-con-, ducted him to cur studio. We must have been m-innds at thatmoment; for, I remember we treated podr-Solomon i rather r cavalierly. $ and as for Hoplnns; we looked opon him as-a being from a lower sphere; a 3?hilistine; a creature whose- presence inv the world could only be tolerated>from -ihe stern necessity that; an artist must sell his pictures.' so- someone, m order to hve. Our- ideas of the grandeur and importance of ;th2 • true smission -of. .art were very lofty in those days, especially if we happened-to have a fewpounds in our pockets. - Hopkins, to us, was one of a class of men who buy young artiBts'pictures,- solely'With a- view; of reahsmg hundreds per cent, on the:invest- • ments-when fame conies, to-the painter.,. . : . - -However, whether from mercenary inclinations, \- or for the many good qualities that adorned us, Hopkins took a great fancy, to as - and sought our society from that day. Of course he bad the usual commercial faults, ; and not:a few defe&ts; of education;.but he: had a great and proper reverence -for genius,: and-dehghted-to do it-homage—at least so -we understood tlie meaning of those little dinners he gave us, at his o^vn chambers and various-' other • places.'-,. As- artists, /after al3, : are but mortal, and, when -young and struggling, not too: highly fed; we accepted Hop-; kins's attentions in the-spiat we fancied they were -meant,- and,-after-a bit;-tolerated-'him;. indeed,- even began to think he: -waB a ..desir-; able - aeqaamtancs—so, ; moved by a • feehng Jif gratitude for his civilities; only; doubled 1 the: market-price of the pictures we could at tunes induce him to buy •: "We. enjoyed -.the-dinners -he g&ve; vs.,very much, but I am sure Hopkins enjoyed himself more when we were kmd enough to condescend to invite -him to spond an evenmg at oni- lodgings. - He gave ns Iiafitte and choice cigars; we only-placed pipes and whisky upon the table vhut then, asilie said, our raoins, if humble, were the abode ^oJ iart, which he honored. Altogether Hojilans was not a bad sort, and those -were -merry;old times.-. , If Hopkins did -not himself take o leading part-m the conversation during these evenmg entertainments; he. was. at least,- a capital listener; and, somehow, when Siank Blair and-I, as was our-wont; got lnto hyely discus-' sions on-things m general, and.artinparticular,we-had contracted the habit of addressing our remarks • to our gutest, miich rn the same way : that • hoxibrable -members address their words to -the Speaker. Hopkins- would Bit in the crazy- armchair- -an d.listen -vvitii a sort •of' stohd impartiahiy, but rarely- ventured to make a-remark on his own account, ^cca- Bionally I fancied - his face ; --during -our talk would wear- -an- expression of'.-content, but should-not like -to -berash. enough to assert 'even: that much. • - <He would sit smoking his pipe'-or-cigar,-hut the,:nearest-approach--he made to entering into the discussion was by . giving an- occasional grunt; - which might he either of ajiprobation or condemnation, as those who heard chose to construe it. Spmetunes, for want of hettei- amusement, Frank and I -would jom our forces -together, :and' chaff our: friend unmercifully..

" ¥ou -want to sell -stock—another. - man wants to huy stock—you go to a brokei—he goes to a broker—both brokers go to a jobber, or-dealer, which sounds nicer—your broker sells him the stock, his broker buys it, of him. That's a 'stock-jobber's business m' a nutshell." : "But as Iain ignorant of-ull transactions m stocks I fail to see the pull of it" "Well, your broker sells it to mefor, say; :one hundred and twenty; the other man's broker buys it for me for, say, one hundred and twenty-one; and that's the way-we make our .living " " That is a nice business," said Blair, in tonesof admiration" so easy, 311st the thing to suit you, I should flunk." :-,.-- -.
