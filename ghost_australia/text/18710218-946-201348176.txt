' Oh, I'm not engaged,' Travers re plied, stepping . into the well-appointed carriage. . . .' Where are you going now?' ?. : ? ' To King's Cross Hospital, to look at a curious; case; Dewar wrote me: ? word about it yesterday ; the man's dying, I believe, and it's an opportunity not to be- lost.'. -..; ' : i .

There was, nothing -particularly inte resting to him- in. the^man, his friend had come to inspect, so. he amused himself by looking round the ward. ? ? Stopping by one' bed his eyes fell upon Micky Keane. \ The recognition was mutual. ? ? : He had seen the old man on the occa sion of his daughter's wedding,, and had been rather struck' by:his pleasant and independent bearing. . ?'?. 'Keane!' he. exclaimed, in surprise, ' you here ! How came you in London, and what has, happened ? ' ~ ' Yesi ' sir, I'm here,' the old man replied .. in i a dejected! tone. 'And I hoped I should never leave this place alive, but theyisay I. shall. God help me.' ; ' But what .brought you to London ?' ? '.Oh, perhaps you haven't heard ; Mr Horace— — ' ' Ah yes, I know. Poor Ratty ! he's gone.' ' And my girl, sir, she's gone too. My pretty Nora ! she's dead, and— ' Nora dead !'' exclaimed George Travers in utter astonishment, 'why, where ? I never heard it.' . : ' Maybe not, sir, but it's true. She died on the last night of the old year. i She was killed, Mr Travers — killed 1 through jumping out of a window at a fire. But it isn't her death alone that 'troubles me — there was shame and sor row with it, sir. She left her husband before that, whether by fair means or no, I can't tell, but she did. I had it from the man who wronged her. I swore to find out the truth before I died, but Heaven's against me, as yoii see.' Mr Travers thought his injuries had turned his brain, and stood blankly staving at him in mute astonishment. Presently he burst out again. ' I often wonder, sir, what I've done' that Heaven should be so hard on me. I didn't wrong any one that I know of, or did anything very wicked ; and now my girl's gone, and her husband, and I'm lying . here, a poor crushed creature, without a hope 'on earth, or a bright look out for* the next world to cheer me on.''. ' Micky, I think you are mistaken.' George Travers spoke slowly and quietly to arrest his attention, which he fancied was wandering, and Keane turned his head quickly, and looked at him with enquiring eyes. ' Mistaken, sir ! How ?' 'In thinking Nora is dead. L know you are.' The sick man's eyes dilated, and he looked impatiently at his visitor, with something of the half-crazed agony of King Lear in his face. . The passage, 'I am a very foolish, fond old man,' rose involuntarily to Travers' mind as he met his gaze, and he hastened to vindecsive him, ' There is a mistake, Koano ; unless Nora has died since .that dreadful fire, she is alive still. I took her away from it myself, and less than a week after wards she went away to Ireland to find you. Don't look so frightened, I'm telling you the truth. ? Nora and her child left London for Holyhead safe and well. I did not see her go, but I left her in the charge of a worthy woman, who cared for her as a mother might. I know; allr her story, -there was neither shame nor wrong in, it* . and I have no doubt poor Horace was coming over in ; answer , to my. letter when. he. met his dreadful fate.'' ' ' ' '-' ':' '? ' '' : _ .Micky- Keane looked-, up bpwildercd ; his head was confused yet.. ? .'. ,?-,.' - ? ... '.Nora .not dead,' ho said -feebly, 'and no wrong nor shame. Will you please i to tell me again, sir ? I don't quite understand it yet.' Very patieully George Travers re peated the story till the old man began to realize that what' he was listening to was no fable; that Nora was not only 'alive, but' blameless,, and his strength seemed- to., return, and his- eyes to brighten as he listened. ? . .'.Then I- must make haste and get well now,'- he. said excitedly. ' She'll be waiting for me at home. Oh, Alanna, Alanna, How long will, it be till I shall see you.?' , , '. ? 'You must get , well , as' fast as pos sible Mickey, ? I'll leave you no w ? to sleep'onthe good news I've brought yoUj and I'll come again to-morrow and will see what can be done.' ? ,, ' You'v.e brought my patient back to life,', the house-surgeon remarked in a i few minutes',' conversation with the gen tlemen ? before they 'departed. ' That old, man with, an iron constitution and recovering , rapidly from, his accident, was in a fair way to die of something no doctor, can curej mental depression.' ?'.I've relieved;, his -mind of a great sorrow',' I'knbw that.' '' ' ' .' '? ? ,/j'r : 'And- added 'a new- lease., to. his, life, —I wish 'I could get the same prescrip tion applied to some of my other patients here.' ??',', ..','.? ' I'm afraid that's put of. my power, i but 'I'll ' try and complete the;' cure, lix his case.' . Mr Travers recommended Mickey Keane to allow him at once to write to Augustus O'Grady, and tell him the whole story of Hetty's marriage from beginning to end, but the old man re fused point blank. ' Not 'till she's given me leave,' he said ' Not 'till she's cleared her name from all the foul slander that villain has thrown upon it. Mr Horace, God bless him, said the family should' nt see her till he'd made a lady of her ; she's ready made now sir, but she shan't go to the Dingles to be scorned as an un faithful wife, and looked upon as a dis grace. She's mine, now, sir, all mine — her and her baby, and with God's help I'll keep her. I've a bit of money, and she won't be backward in working for her living, I'd rather not have the mar riage spoke of till I've seen her, if you please, sir.' Travers was fain to comply tho' against his judgment ; after all what did it matter to him ? Nora was her own mistress, — Horace was dead, and if she preferred poverty with her fathei1, to the competence which the O'Gradys would doubtless allow her if they knew, that was her affair, not his. So no let ter went to Ireland in search of Nora, aud Mickey Kearie got. well enough in a fortnight to set out on his return journey. A week later Travers ac cepted an Indian appointment suddenly vacant ; and six weeks from the day when he had found tho old Irishman in the hospital ward had bid adieu to Eng land for an indefinite time, for aught ho knew for life. Mickey Keane made no attempt to see Captain Tristraile again ; it was enongh for him to know that Nora lived,— better that the man who had so slan dered her should think her dead. He left London as soon as his feeble strength was sufficiently restored, and went straight home, never doubting but he should find his daughter there. No sign of any one having been in the cabin since he left it was to be seen, and he went in, in stupid miseiy wondering what it could all mean. While he was refreshing himself after his journey,, and thinking of the squalid, forsaken look which had crept over his once tame little home, a neighbour dropped in. From her he learned that Nora had never been seen (she evidently thought him mad for asserting her to be alive), but heard at the same time of the visit of a stranger to the neighbouring farm. Thither he went post haste, and recognised Nora from the description, although the man asserted it was only a messenger from her. ' ? ' It was my girl, I know' it,' tho old man said ; ' tell me where did she go to the Dingles ? ' \ ? ' The Dingles ! What should she do there,' was ;tho surprised answer. ' She wont straight ,to ; Dublin by the train. I saw herget into the carriage myself.' ; ; ««;Y.ou.did ?':,?'.'???? ..:?:-????? ? 'Yes; you see* she seemed rather wild and enraged-like ; she'd rambled a ' bit in her talk about' going away, and never being seen again, and all that-; and as she; seemed.. in trouble my missis took it: into her head that she wanted to drown herself, and so I followed her.' 'And she didn't, 'you' are sure she didn't ? Oh, my. Norn, my poor Nora.' ' I don't believe it was your girl, neighbour; she said she wasn't, but only acquainted with her. Drown her self! '.Not she. .'She went straight -to the. station and paid her fare, and got into a carriage, and I saw the train start.', : ;= ? ? . ? ? 'For Dublin?' ': 'For Dublin.' ? .. . ; ? ' Then that's what I must do, I'll go and seek her. God bless you and yours for your kindness to her.' ? 'That old man's going silly,' the. farmer remarked ; to his wife when he got home., ' He's going to Dublin to seek his daughter, and she's dead.'' 'Poor old soul! Tell the. priest when you see him,- John.' ? ?' But before the good people saw the priest, Mickey Keane was gone, leaving no trace behind, and when the good father went to seek and console him, he found the cabin untenanted by all, ex cept the birds that flew in and. out at a broken pane,. and a starved cat that had sought shelter there. /-.*.'? ' Months passsed away,' and the soft summer weather came, lighting the earth into fairy beauty;: and making another: paradise of the Dingles. All was sunshine there, .ill bright sayethe mourning garb. all in the house ?still * wore for. Ratty, 'bright, joyous Ratty ! the sun of whose young life had gone down so suddenly. Angeline was well again, and her baby, the infant heir, a rosy little darl ing the idol of all the family. It had been a lovely July day, and Gnstavus O'Grady, his wife, and sister, had been out on a long round of visits. Tempted by- the hospitality of one friend they had remained out to dinner, and did not return to the Dingles until evening had set in. Angeline's first thought was for her baby, and she went up to the nursery ; her husband sat down in the drawing room, and a servant brought in a heap of letters. ' Put them down,' he said, ' I'll look at them by-and-bye.' ? He took up a new magazine which lay near on the table, and was lazily turning over its pages, when his wife came down. ' Any of these for me ?'she asked, pointing to the letters. 'No, I see they are all masculine hands.'1 ' All business, my dear, and all the same, if I mistake not.' She turned to the open French window, and tempted by the extreme beauty of the evening, she passed through it on to the terrace. Her husband called out a caution about the evening air, but she did not heed him, and passed out of sight be - hind a clump of trees on the lawn. In less than a minute, as it seemed, she was back again, her cheeks pale, her eyes distended, and her hair falling about her shoulders. She clutched him by the arm and trie'd vainly to speak, but fell at his feet in a passion of terror. 'Angel, .my darling, what is it?' he asked, raising her in his arms. 'What has frightened you so ?' But she could not speak for some time, and he had to caress and soothe her like a little child. Her fear was extreme, though he could see nothing to warrant it. Presently she shivered a little less, and grew more calm, and he repeated his questions.' 'I saw a ghost !' she said, faintly. 'A ghost, my darling. Where ?' ' Down there behind the groat oak ; I saw ? '' ? ' What dear ?? Who ?' . ' Ratty.' . . . ' Ratty ! My darling Angel there is some mistake ; ' you have seen some of the men crossing the lawn and in the twilight.' ' No, Gusty, no ; I saw him as closely as I see you now, he stood be fore me white and still. What can be hanging over us ? What can it por tend-?' ' Hush, dear, hush,' he began, but even as he spoke her eyes distended again and she , pointed towards the window with an hysteric shriek. . .' There, there !' . she exclaimed, f there again ! Ratty ! Ratty !'. . Her feelings were . strained to the utmost, and she fainted in his arms. , Hastily laying her on the sofa, he turned to ring the bell. and. confronted the spectre which had alarmed her. Ratty ! with outstretched hands and eager eyes' waiting for a welcome home. .'.Ratty!' . . 'Gus !' The ? brothers were in each other's arms in a moment. ' Not dead .?' .'. No, saved by a miracle almost, but safe. Look to Angel, Gus, I have frightened her almost to death, though I can't understand it, you surely got my letter?'- . ''?When'?'. 'To-day.' ' . ' We've been out all day, and the letters are lying there unopened. There's Augusta's footstep, she won't faint at the surprise.' . Not she ; she understood .all at a glance, and folded Ratty in her arms with a great sob of delight. ? . 'I must go to my mother,' she said ; 'she has mourned you sorely, dear, and the shock might kill her. Keep out of Angel's sight when she . recovers, she's but a weakly creature still.' Matter-of-fact oven in her great joy, she marched off, saying that explana tions would do by-and-bye, and Gus tavns carried his wife upstairs to her' room. '.'.-.[? The news soon spread in the.servant's? hall that 'Master. Ratty' 'was . not' dead. One after another they crowded up . to the drawing- room door and around the' windows, ' and if Horace had even doubted their love in the old days, their tearful welcome was enough to assure him of it now. Chapter VIII. noNon. ' A child no more, I love, and I am woman'—' Richelieu.' Bui,WEit Lyttox. No one saw the meeting between the mother and her rescued son ; no eye was witness to the holy joy with which she greeted her favorite child, come back to .her a waif fi-om the terrible sea. She came down to the family supper very pale but full of gladness, and sat proud and happy in the accustomed circle. No need for mourning now, with the morning they would lay aside the black dresses which had covered such aching hearts, and be the gay happy circle they had been six months before. Angel would not wait for the morn ing, when she found that the spectre she had seen was really Ratty in the flesh, she changed her dress and came down looking fragile and fairy-like in while robes to greet her brother-in-law. Far into the night they talked, and Ratty told how it was that he had not shared the fate of the rest of tho boat's crew. ' We all went down,' he said, ' but I and another man came up right along side the capsized boat, wo tried to right her, but it was no use, and we managed to climb on the top of her. Poor fel low he was washed off again, but I held on for hours that seemed like days, till the light came^and I saw a big ship not far from me. *I shouted and by heaven's mercy I was heard and taken aboard, not a bit too soon, for my power of holding on was going and I should have slipped off had not succour arrived when ifdid. The ship was the Beacon, Captain Thomas, bound for Lima ; rough weather drove us out to sea and prevented my being transferred to any homeward bound vessel, so you see I have made an unpremeditated voyage to South America since I saw you.' ' But were none in the boat picked up beside you, dear Ratty ?' asked An geline, her gentle face full of terror at the thought of that terrible shipwreck. ' Not one dear, that I know of ; the Beacon sailed about a whole day, hop ing to see something of the other boats in vain. It was only when I landed this morning that I heard of the safety of anyone on board.' Far into the nigbfc the brothers sat talking when the rest of the over ex cited family had retired ; Augustus had so much to tell, and Horace had so much to hear of what had passed in his absence. ' The O'Connor's came home on Tuesday,1' the squire said, 'and Lord and Lady Scattcrbrain with them; Italy has set her ladyship up in health, and Honor in beauty, she's a lovely girl, Ratty.' ' Is she ? It is a long time since I saw her, she was quite a child thon.' 'She's no child now, she's seventeen and womanly for. her ago;; she's a re fined likeness of what her mother was before she was married.' ' That was something very comical,' said Ratty laughing ; ' my boyish re collections of her ladyship are of a wild Irish girl unkempt and barefoot.' ' But beautiful ?' ' I admit the beauty, and so her daughter is like her ?' ' Very, both in mind and person, with a clash of her father's oddness, just enough to make her piquante and ori-- ginal.' ' She must be original if she is like him. Do you remember the blister,. Gus?' Both the brothers laughed heartily at the recollection for a minute, and then the squire said with a half sigh, 'Poor » father he little thought that his clumsy servant would ever come to be a friend to his sons ; we may thank dear old O'Connor and his lordship for our posi-. tion, brother.' ' That we may, we shall never repay them, except with gratitude.' ' You could repay Lord Scatlcrbraiu in one way if you chose.' 'How?' ' Marry his daughter.' Horace started from his seat as.' though he had been struck, and looked1 at his brother in astonishment. ' Me marry Honor !' he exclaimed.. 'That child! Whatever put such an idea into your head ? ' 'His lordship himself ; 1 did. not mean to say anything, but our talk led up to it; it has been his pet idea for some time to give Honor to you. He thinks that to thus unite our families would — Why, Ratty, what is the matter ??? What have I said ? '' For Ratty, in a tumult of feeling he could not repress, had.laid his head upon his arms and was sobbing with the passion which rouses a man to tears. ' Nothing,' he said after a while. ' Only roused some slumbering recollec tions, that was all. Drop love-making and marriage for the present, and go on with the news.' All the news was told ; amongst other things, the visit of Mickey Keane and the news he brought, which Horace heard with a face hidden by his hand, that his brother might not see its work ings, 'Do you know, Ratty,' Augustus said ' that something in the old mail's manner at most made me think that you had to do with Nora's disappearance ; he said yon knew about it. I questioned him, but he said she-had suffered neither shame nor wrong at your hands, and grew quite indignant at my suspicions.' ' And you did auspect me,? ' ' Not in my heart ; it was a passing ?fancy and no more.'' ' And what did old Keane do ? ' 'Went straight to London to inquire into the truth of what he had heard. It was a Captain Tristraile who had written to him.' ' Yes, I know, curse him ! Go on.' ' There is nothing more to toll ; some wild story has been afloat since about the old man having been back seeking for his daughter. The general opinion seems to be that the shock has driven ; him out of his mind, for ho has wan- ' dered off no one knows where, persisting that Nora is alive. Anyhow, the cabin is deserted, and no one knows whether he is living or dead.' ' And how long is all this ago ?'? ' I think it is about three* months since I heard of his being back, but the story is very mythical altogether.' ' There will come ^ day of reckoning yet !' exclaimed Horace, pacing the room in great excitement ; ' heaven's curse light on the man who wrought this ruin ! I shall live to it — I cannot die till I have seen it !' Giistavus O'Grady stared at his brother in mute astonishment — he thought he had gone suddenly insane. ' Then you do know about it as the old man said; what is tho mystery about Nora Keano, Horace ? She was nbt! your ? ' ' She was my wife, Gus, my loving,1 .gentle,' pure wife. T believe ifc now she's dead and I can look upon hor sweet face no more, but a villain stopped botween us and tolc1 us she had fled from ;my arms to his ; it was to reckon with him that I sailed in the Erin.' : : V ' And the letter you rcceircd tfrom London: ? ?
