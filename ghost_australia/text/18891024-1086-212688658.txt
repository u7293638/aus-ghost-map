Men Awaiting Execution. Judging from a remarkable report which the Abbe Faure has made to the French Government, on the behaviour of condemned men, it would appear that to even the most hardened criminal, the period between sentence and execu tion is one of cruel torture. And this state of feeling appears to culminate in the night before the exe cution. Of eleven murderers whom the Abbe attended at the last moment, three only were asleep when called upon. If any proof were needed of the manner in which the sentence weighs upon them, he says, it would be furnished by the difference between a prisoner sentenced, and the same man reprieved. On one morning he is ill, feverish, sleepless, breathlessly inquiring about his fate ; and the next, with the pros pect of a life-long toil at the galleys before him, he is spirited, bright, and cheerful. Outside the prison walls, it is frequently asserted that death is pre ferable to imprisonment for life : but it is evident that those who talk in this way, never spent a night under the death-sentence. If they had, they would have said with the ghost of Achilles, "Better to serve a landless man, than bear sway over all the king doms of the dead." At least, such is the conclusion we draw from the obser vations of the Abbe Faure.
