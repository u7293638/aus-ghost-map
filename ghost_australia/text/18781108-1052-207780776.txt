f o— ..... ) MACBETH. ' - Mr. Tliomas Kenny, a clever e.ssay- f ist, and who has written most ably pa » die subjectiof " Afacbeth," characteri ' ises it as " a drama of gigantic crime and terror relieved by the most niag- X nincent iinagiiiauve e.vpressioii, . yet : ( .markpd with great simplicity of general "design. The date, of the production of S the piece is .set by Furnival at 1605-6, and "we may take it, for granted," says Kenny, " that it was written in the. tim-f of James the First, who a.scende(! the throne March, 1603, as it contains an evident allusion to that monarch in act iv. scene i, and also a complimentary reference to him in aii- ) other part. Tiie material for the play y jwas found by Shakespeare in Holin- shed's History of Scotland, where the slory of jMacbeth is told at page 168." The Macbeth and Duncan are repre sented to have been cousins ; the first a valiiint gentleman but of cruel di.spo- sition, '.and. the latter "so soft :and genUe in.Jiis.-riature ih.at the pe.bple AVislied the inclination and manners of ' the two to have been so tempered and , ' intGrchangably sliaicd betwixt them ;lhat,'wh,<irc the one had too much of ' clehiciicy and the. other of cruelty, the , main, virtue bctwecH these two extrc- liiitics might have reigned by indilfer-. ' cht partition in Them bolli. The play all along keeps close, to the line of Holinsbe'd, yaiying from it in scarcely any particular except in the non appearance in the banquet scene of the niurdercd Banquo's ghost." This tragedy has bceit presented in Melbourne wc believe oftencr than any other of Shakespeare's works. The ; late G. V. Brooke, Charles Kean, , ' Charles Vincent,, in their time essayed the part, and we have had other repre- ' sentativcs, from the burly McKean Buchanan and James. Anderson to the little dapper J. -B.
