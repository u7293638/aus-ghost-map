THERE appears .to- b'e little reason to doubt that, despite , the assurance to the contrary given by the British Government to our Agent-General, some pf the vile sciim khownasTriehinformers have shipped to these colonies, and with the consent and knowledge "of the Imperial Government. The latest intelligence informs us that the steamship Pathan, now on lier way: to Melbourne, has on board Peter Carey, Kavanagli, Hanlon and Smith, and that , their identityisfixed beyond dispute.; We are happy to see tliat. no /tiine lias heen lost in eliciting from the.Premier his sentiments regarding this proposed shooting of rubbish on the shores of Australia. In the issembiy on Thursday, .night,. Mr Patterson,, as we learn from the Parliamentary reports, " asked the Premier if his • attention had; been called to the possibility of a number of the worst Irish conspirators and informers landing oiiourshprea-—(cheers)-- aud whether or not he had instructed, the Agent-Generai to mate any remonutrance , against such a step being taken. It was a great outrage, and' seemed as if the colonies were" still ta be treated as ifj>they ^ were a penal" settlement. There was a feeling of Btrdng indiguation among ,'^ classes of the S In the evening papers -he 'Noticed ithat. a.; ship called: the, Pathan.Thad,..arrived, at, Adelaide, and that it was eupposed thaty the bulk of the worst. <>L£he: mformsrs^ were Ifini: f their way to know how it would: be possible . tq -dea-j; with theiu in the matter of; legislation, Victoria being part of the British do?; minions, but he was. sure it would-be in accordance with the wishes of the Premier , that the arrival of the niisn Bhdiild be strenuously and lawfully . resisted - as far as . possible.""^ .Jffir;:;SemceV.."repl^'. was just tliat which 'was io ie -expected • Under the cireumstances.. But it will be observed that there are great difficultieB ; in the way of excluding th«ise -undesirable i people. That Mr Servicefully recognised- this may be inferred from the tone of. his ; remarks, He said': fM I: may «ay that, some six or eight weeks ago I observed in the telegrams from London that it was rumoured that, some of 'these informers were intended to be sent by the English Goi eminent to Australia." That very morning Iwiredhome iothe agent- generals to remonstrate and protest in.the strongest* manner—(cheers)—not only on behalf of victoris, but on behalf of the whole of Australia, against any such course 'being adopted (Renewed cheers ) T had a reply from the agent- general „to tlie effect that he immediately remonstrated as directed, hut had been assured that it was ' s intention of $he British-Govern-,. not( ment to send the informers anywhere. I am afraid from what I have heard that a number of them have come 'to thefce colonies by the ship whose-Arrival is announced to-day. I had a very serious deliberation over the matter'with'my 'cot- "agues, but there is great difficulty in vetoing any portion of British soil to a "rtosh subject. That is the difficulty winch I feel at the present time. I think were wouU be one unanimous 'feeling of utter detestation towards such -men tmoughout the length and breadth of the country. X think I am only speaking the ieeluig of Parliament and of the whole country when I<say that if any taeaps #an 6 0 taken to prevent them settling, down ^ong Ua these lifeans should betaken-^' kelleers)—but forni moment 1 am»entir% nonplussed to know -what panSe Mne. « 6 P 0o P le Wnot-ieen icowlctecl^f ® n y crime, although some of -them 4iaveJ e n 8 U1 % of ciimes—which are not only M "aes in themseUes, but crimes*of the ^neauest possible character, which render "em unfit to associate with any ^society.- ,e m a tter will not4)e long unnoticed by I shall keep it continually jn View,.
