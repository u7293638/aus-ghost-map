gold Soon after he got into Parliament, and so endeared himself to his constituents that they erected a statue to turn, placing it in the principal thoroughfare of the town Wags In the House of

If his personality were reproduced by the latest triumph of photographic science, the kinetoscope the range of human delight would be infinitely under No artist in black and w site, however skilled, could draw the philosopher and historian as I chanced to see him in the lobby of the House of Commons last night, giving a note in charge of the doorkeeper The sinuous grace with which he approached the humble official, the outraging way in which he dropped his head on one side, the wreathed smile, the almost im- perceptible ) et unmistakable gesture of a curtsey as he handed over the note, might

author of " Democracy and Liberty " His ordinary attire, with square) cut, loosely hung coat, shapeless trousers just covering the ankle, the clumsy boots, and the hat of shape familiar enough 10 years ago, is more or less faithfully reproduced in the caricatures of the day Duce this season it was on a a night he had been dining with the Speaker-I happened to meet Mr Lecky in levee dress Among
