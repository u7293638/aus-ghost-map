A True Ghost Story. This is a true English ghost story of an unconventional kind. A young lady arrived late at night cn a visit to a friend. She awoke in the darkness, to find a white figure at the foot of the bed. While she watched, the bed-clothes were suddenly whisked off and the apparition vanished. After an anxious, not tu say chilly, night, the visitor went down, with little appetite, to breakfast. At the table she was introduced to a gentleman, a very old friend of the family, who had, she learned, also been sleeping in the house. He complained of the cold. 1 1 hope you will excuse me,' he said to the hostess, ' but I found it so cold during the night that, knowing- the room next mine was unoccupied, I took the liberty of going in and carrying off the bed clothes to supplement my own.' The room, as it happened, was not unoccu pied, but he never learned his mistake.
