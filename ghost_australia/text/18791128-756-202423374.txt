[?] TAKE NOT YOUR LIFE. you look at the shining river — You gsze at the deep, deep sea — And because oi your many troubles, And because of your misery, While the beautiful sun is shining, Or the moonbeams softly fall, You say, perhaps, in your anguish, This hour I will and it. nil. Oh tarry, world-weary mortal, And question before you leap : " Is it honest to end the being That never was mine to keep ?" ' Is it manly to leave the dear ones To battle with care alone ?" 44 Is it safe with no heavenly summons, To rush to the great unknown?" Remember, if you have courage To look at the matter right, That no trouble will last for ever, And the brave will win the fight. That, oh friend, if we live for others, Though drinking at sorrows fount, When compared with the joy we give them, Our pain is of small account. Then gird on the soldier's armour, And march to the front to-day, Making war on the morbid fanoies That, ghost-like, intest your way ; Laying by all your selfish motives, Contented to kiss the rod — Living out his appoiuted season A man, with your trust in God.
