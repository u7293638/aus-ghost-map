FILTRATION FOR CATTLE TROUGHS. . SOMBTIUNO very much out of date presents itself in the common practice of watering cattle. There may be exceptions to this rule ; but a visit to the old ponds or the modern watering troughs at this season proves that such exceptions are few and far between in most of our English counties. From the important part which water plays in the animal economy, a dirty thick liquid, green, brown, and blue, from being literally in life by swarms of insects, with a luxuriant crop of cryptog.amous vegetation, is to speak in the mildest possible terms, the opposite of what it should be. That water is of more value than oilcake in the dietary of cattle ' cannot be doubted and yet how differently does it appear to be estimated, judging from practical data ! For, throughout the length and breadth of the land, the adulteration of the latter forms the universal complaint ; whereas the adulteration of the former is passed over as one of the shortcomings of a daily necessity. We hav e even heard it argued that the stinking pool was better for cattle than the clear crystal fountain. True, many of our clear crystal streams contain an amount of saline matter that reduces its value for cattle, often rendering it worse than the soft water in the ponds, although the latter may be literally s warm ? ing with insect life ; but the objection to the former State to the ground as null and void in a practical ( light, for water should be purified of its objectionable inorganic matter as well as of decomposing animal and Mifcelable feather, with the? dauntless brood, of insects invariably present in the whim vveatW' of summer" Altogether, from beginning to end, the subject evidently demands a thorough investigation. The common practice of purifying water for large towns is by filtration. The process is generally very imperfectly performed by water companies, while the allowing of the water to remain in large open public reservoirs and in uncovered house cisterns afterwards makes it often nearly as impure as in the outset, When the reservoirs and cisterns are covered it greatly retards the growth of animal and vegetable life ; but even when thus preserved from atmospheric influence the water is seldom fit for drinking until ' filtered a second time. The principles which experience has taught to be necessary relative to the health of towns in procuring a proper supply of pure water furnish the farmer with an instructive lesson as to how he should supply his cattle in order to preserve their health. Just now, when cholera is making its appearance here and there as if in search of an inviting field or predisposing ground, our civic authorities are alive to the dangerous character of impure drinking water, stagnant sewage matter, and suchlike choloroic-producing substances; and although our agricultural societies have not yet begun corresponding chemical, microscopic, and other scientific investigations relative to the cause of the growing mortality amongst cattle, and how much this is due to the drinking of impure water water that would, inevitably produce cholera in any of our large towns at the present time-yet the visitation of rinderpest is obviously turning attention in this direction. And the reader will perceive that, judging from parallel case of towns, stagnant ponds, in which the urine and pieces of cattle, and the washings of grass lands, &c.; are allowed to accumulate and purely, thereby polluting the atmosphere in the immediate neighbourhood of these ponds-this polluted atmosphere may be as instrumental in propagating disease, as it is taken into the circulation by inspiration. There is no doubt a difference between the stomach of a man and that of an ox, and no doubt also the vast majority of the agricultural body may as yet conclude that pie organs of cattle may have the power of de- fecating digested and inhaled matters of all impurities which the former has not. Though, however, this were granted, yet every species, of the animal creation has its weak points, the ox not-excepted ; so that when certain morbid substances are taken into its circula- tion they may prove fatal, although they might prove harmless in the circulation of man, the horse, or pig Naturally the organs of smell and taste in cattle are more sensitive than are those of man, owing perhaps to the omnivorous and depraved habits of the latter. It will no doubt be said that our cattle, strictly speaking, are now in an artificial state, and not in a natural one, and that their habits by long use are about as omnivorous and depraved us are those of ' man. The objection thus raised, however, may not inaptly be said practically to refute itself for by training our cattle, or perhaps we should rather say by starving ? them into the necessity of eating many things which they would refuse in a natural state, and of drinking water of a still more abnormal character, we are undermining their normal health, thereby predisposing them to all the contagious maladies now so rife and ruinous in our flocks and herds. From these observations it follows that farmers ought to study closely the natural wants of their cattle and one of these wants, more especially at this season 'at the year, is an ample supply of pure water. If water forms 83 per cent, of the whole constituent . elements of the body, and there is also a large consumption daily in augmentation and-excretion, how essentially necessary is it that this large supply should be free from contamination of every kind injurious to health The grand mistake into which farmers are liable to fall in this case, is to overlook or under-estimate its practical dimensions. In our climate water is such a common-place commodity, putting summer and winter together, that few ever think of setting a pecuniary value upon it for their cattle. If the supply is plentiful and the quality good at all seasons of the year, the blessing is a natural one, and accepted accordingly. If the quality is bad, it is considered a natural misfortune to which the locality is subject one that is often horne as if it cannot be helped. It is only when a deficiency in the supply is experienced that people grumble, and then the makeshifts to catch and store rain-watorcre of a more inefficient character. Had farmers to pay their landlords for their water according to its intrinsic and dietetic value, it would doubtless be otherwise for under such conditions they would not pay away sterling money for dirty water. but because furnishes get their water for nothing, that is surely no valid reason why they should water their cattle out of any stinking public. And this, too, is not the most unfavourable view of the subject that must be taken, for in our day the quality of the water-in our ponds and rivers is much worse than it was in the olden time, owing to the more effective drainage of land and the extensive use of artificial manures, together with the increase of population in towns and refuse from manufactories, AGe, and the impurities which find their way into the water from these sources. Altogether, it is not very easy to comprehend the real magnitude of the whole question involved in supply- ing cattle with pure water for at the present time the quality of the supply is annually getting from bad to worse over a large extent of the country. Those who have. regular supply of pure water from natural springs, or from artificial wells and pumps, have little more to do than to keep out im- purities, and attend to the daily washing out of the water troughs, and the supplying them with water. A sufficiency chould«be,put into the trough to supply the daily wants of the cattle, with the addition of what may be recjuinsdtto washout the trough, after which it should he rinsed out with a painful of newly drawn water, so as effectually to clear it of the seeds and germs of animal and vegetable life which may have been deposited during the day. Ignorant cow- herds who throw in fresh water upon the stale actually cultivate the growth of these microscopic broods of little bliss and vegetables that give to the water its green or brown colour. In the warm weather of summer, the atmosphere is often. literally thick with the germs, of which life, and cattle when they drink, whether in the house or in the field, invariably leave lees or mere of the food they are eating or ruminating upon in the water, which attracts and feed such organisms, thereby nursing thern into maturity. From the large quantities of artificial manures now used, the drainage' of arable lands ought not to be collected in ponds or reservoirs for watering cattle, if a supply can otherwise be obtained. Much spring water which rises in scale land, and is removed in common underground drains, is also rendered unfit for the use of cattle, from its being adulterated with the manure thus washed out of the land. In all cases, thereforE, where such spring water is intended to be used for cattle, it should be conveyed in close pipes either to wells or directly to the watering troughs for use. Where spring water does not exist, and where the dependence is exclusively upon rain-water, they should be collected if possible from waste lands, or grass lands not recently manured, or from arable lands where the manure has been exhausted by capping, so as to have it as free as possible from foreign soluble ma tier, which cannot be removed by filtra- tion. The seeds of small plants, spores of fungi, and eggs of insects, &c;, washed from waste and grasslands into surface or subsoil drains, and by these conveyed into ponds, may be got rid of by filtration. Some times these latter impurities are removed by natural filtration, the water having passed through a porous sandy subsoil into the pond. The beat ponds are those which are deep, and into which the water in thus filtered, for in the first place the water is comparatively pure, while in the second place a deep narrow pond presents a minimum area of control nating surface to the atmosphere and also a indus of less attractive power to insects, from the, water being of -a low temperature It is otherwise with broad shallow ponds at a higher temperature, into which the rum water flows in open furrows, for animal and vegetable life both luxuriate in such ex visits Open ponds however deep are nevertheless objectionable even when the water is filtered into them. The experience of towns on this head is practically conclusive, and therefore our open ponds, surrounded as they generally are with rowing wood of some kind, as it purposely to attract insects must be converted into deep covered wells into which the rain- water should be filtered by artificial means in the absence of natural filtration and from who h it may be pumped into the watering troughs as required If the well is deep and the water of a low temperature, a second filtration may be unnecessary but when the contrary conditions are present, and the first filtration not well performed, a second filtration may be the more economical and profitable practice As to water from rivers and their tributaries, numerous examples of this kind are in the summer time literally a series of putrid pools, in which modern eels i annot lix c And even in the cold weather of winter the water is now so polluted by the sewage of towns and villages is to be generally speaking, unwholesome for cattle in

superphosphate of lime, the former uses but one of the salts necessary for the perfection of a wheat crop But in the use of ashes the farmer applies to his land, besides the several Bales of potash,

furnish ready prepared, or produce after being put upon the land, a good supply of the silicate of potash a salt as necessary as any other sale of potash or even as very salt of phosphoric acid But

kind usually grows where a brush heap or log he has been burned and also, how superior the grain usually is, both in quality and in quantity, which has grown on such cases This consideration establishes beyond a doubt, the fact thatunlcachedwood ashes are excellent fertilisers, and are of more real value to a good farmer when they are applied to a crop than when they are sold for the purpose of making potash Unleashed ashes are far superior to reached ashes, because they furnish a large supply of fertilising material, which makes the straw more stuff than otherwise would be therefore if the straw of cereal grain can be rendered much more stiff by sowing a its bushels of wood ashes per acre, of course there will be a much greater yield of grain if the string. can be kept
