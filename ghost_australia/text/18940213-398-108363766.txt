TO THE EDITOR.. Sir—Your spectral Clairvoyants effusion in Friday's Herald shows- be is merely a • novice in that Utopian science, as. from what i& recorded by the preternatural ghost who. gives his version of what occurred: at the meeting referred to in a more correct and truthful form. Clairvoy ant—" I see by our balance-sheet we are in a better financial position, &e.; . . . ; so we had better husband our resources." Bat the Ghost's reeord runs thus—" We must shortly order thirty pound's, worth of new books ;■ therefore, we should husband our resources." Clairvoy ant—" President—Excuse me, but you have not made a motion, &-c. Mr. No, no; I forgot that." The Ghost remarks here, " Mr. —— is speaking to a notice of motion tabled by himself and which was called on and read by the president as follows— "That the Argus, S. M. Herald, Canterbury Times, Perth Enquirer, and Detriot Free Press , be discontinued." Clairvoyant—" I am , aware that admission to the leading-room is now free to everyone, and therefore we ' j ought not to have such a lot of papr-rs i there." The Grhost failed hi toio to. reeord • \ the latter dozen sounds in this conaection, • : but states the argument was advanced- to strike off these and other papers referred to, because they were neither read nor required, while the cost incurred could be more satisfactorily expended in the inter ests of subscribers, and further adds that the latter half of Clairvoyant's clumsy ridicule is a tissue e£ misrepresentation, and stupid tautology, unsurpassed even by the first half., I am, Sir, &c;, I THE GHOST. !
