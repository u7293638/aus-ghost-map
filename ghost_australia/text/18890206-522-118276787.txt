POETRY. VIGNETTE. Tho long waves wish tlie ftroud, the fog lies low, A moaning wind M)ft croons along the co.iat, And, white and gleaming like a new-made ghost, Tho seagull Hups nloug, heavy and slow, Then fades in tho gmy mist. Aye, to and fro Tho scented seaweed, twined around yon poat, rioats, falls, then ri^es, imtil we almost l)eem that a mermaid calls on us to go And join her court. The earth, the sea, tho shy Are one drear tint. Then round me a? I dream Dead days arise, and hold me in their am*, And whisper me : All men are bom to die, And dawn is nought, Have prestige of the gleam That kills our clay, e'en while itgildsher charms. â€”-iW the I car Jiomirf.
