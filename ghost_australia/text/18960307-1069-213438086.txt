The " Fetching " Fawcett. Praise From a Lad/. Thus Mrs Lance Rawson on a well- known oaptain now on the Queensland coaBt :— " We are tff at last, on our way up the Fitzroy, and I lie on a deck chair on the Taldora, and vaguely wonder how ever I am going to contain all the information and remember all the new and strange ex periences I have stuffed holus bolus into my one poor brain, till I can write it all down, as I have not taken the ghost of a note about anything. It iB a fine night, the hoavens are one mass of twinkling stars, and it seems very good to be lying so comfortably here, while the handsome ekippcr of tho Taldora tells me this, that, and tho other item of interest concerning places and people I have not once thought of since I loft for the sonth nearly three months age. He is a typical seadog, this good looking skipper — a man it .would be good to be taken care of by. He is so strong, so big, and bas sneh a firm grasp of life and its responsibili ties. It is quite refreshing to listen to bim as be enlarges upon things political, municipal, and river and barborwoiks, now and then bursting into little spasms of excitemont, and bringing ont expressions that do not quite savor of mother's milk. I do like a good healthy curse word now and then from a man who looks like it, and does not apologise for it. Nothing hurts my feelings more than for a man to say an infinitesimal damn, and thon instantly, " I beg your pardon;" it makes me feel as small and insignificant as the poor little swear word, whiob, under the circum stances, is usually uttered in a tone that iB an insult to it."
