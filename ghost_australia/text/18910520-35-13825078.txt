THE CELL SYSTEM OF INTERMENT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir, Replying to my letter of the 7th instant and. the above heading, your correspondents "Charly Hudson 2 and 3 Ignis "do not deny the facts quoted from Mr. Seymour Hadon's explanation, before Si funeral conference in England, of the earth the earth " system of burial, showing that a body properly buried is not injurious to the public health The, infer that a gravedigger, although he may work year after year in the very midst of the impure atmosphere IS not so apt to take any disease because his consisted tion is hardened by working out in the open air 44 may be so, but I cannot quite understand how that if the air in the cemetery is so very injurious and the germs of disease are floating about, he, although proof against disease himself, does not carry the germs woman in his clothes to his wife of and children, whose constitu- tions are much weaker than is own A few months ago a person who had lived for a number of years in the Rookwood Cemetery died at the age of 87 another is 82 years of age, and still hale and hearty The injurious atmosphere does not appear to have had any ill-effect upon them Your correspondent Charles Hudson" says we cannot reproduce any particular disease without is specific germ no more we can a cabbage without the cabbage seed HOT can he expect the gems of disease, buried 4ft, under the earth, to come to the surface any more than the cabbage seed would if sown 4ft. under- ground The Sydney Board of Health considered that a body buried 4ft underground was not injurious to the public health, and I understand issued an order to the cemetery authorities to the effect that every body should be interred 4ft. under the natural surface of the earth " 0 H." also says that cemeteries should be constructed on the sea coast, perhaps he has not thought of the fact that I the delightful north-east breezes which we got in. Sydney would blow all the germs of disease back into the city and its dense population I am not so sure about the atmosphere surrounding Rookwood being pure and unpolluted If you stand in the centre of the Rookwood Cemetery and walk from that point n I a south-easterly direction for the distance of about one mile you will come across a " boiling down," the obnoxious odour from which, especially in summer time, is so great that it can be almost,! felt " , with a slight breeze it is almost unbearable in the cemetery, and visitors to the Necropolis naturally think that it arises from the dead bodies in a south- westerly direction there are slaughter-yards, and in Rookwood itself, behind some of the houses, there are pig-styes, these nuisances do not make the atmosphere surround- ing Rookwood pure, but rather detract from its purity I cannot agree with your correspondent " Ignis " about it taking seven or nine years for a body to decay The soil at Rookwood Cemetery is of a clayey nature, and according to his statement it should take nine years for the decomposition of bodies I have seen bodies exhumed in Rookwood Cemetery that have only been buried three years, and they were thoroughly decomposed The cemetery authorities, I believe, consider five years ample time for the decomposition of a body. During the latter part of last year there wore a large number of bodies exhumed, and in no case was a body not thoroughly decomposed I dare say if you refer to the officers of the Rookwood Cemetery they will bear me out in the foregoing statements I would rather believe practical facts than all improved theory, as, for instance, Dr. Koch's cure, which, according to cable news, has proved a failure, and in some instances has done more harm than good The fact of the matter is the unhealthiness of the Rook- wood Cemetery is something like the ghosts that are always attached to it everybody talks about them is a reality, but nobody over sees them the " Southern Cross " ran firm believer in crema- tion, how would he act in such cases as the notorious Louisa Collins), who disposed or two husbands by poison, the traces of which were only found out by exhuming the bodies after they were buried 1 I am, &c.;, PUBLIC HEALTH. -
