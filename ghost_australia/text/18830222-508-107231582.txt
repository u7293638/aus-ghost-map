-MEY LADY'S PIiOT; OB. THB Ghost of Diavolo Castle. CHAPTER XVI. MY I.ADT'S WOBK. Close beside the bed Lucy lay stretched upon the floor in bar night eiothes. Her breast was still, her eyes closed, and her heny face and iron-g-*y iiair all stained with the ghastly stream flowing in an ensanguined tide from a gaping- -wound m her throat. Like one suddenly turned to stone Nina stood ^taring down at the woman. For a single brief instant, as the rushing crowd caused iu the doorway, there was a dead, awful silence. The next a low, hoarse, gasping voice /Murder I' said the voice. ? Murder !' repeated the second voice. ? Murder V cried a third and harsher voice, this time irom behind the shivering group at the door. ' Pcoi-: !' it -r.ezt on. c where are your eyes ? Can't via see tin- broken tumbler under her (Ohin ?

One and sil iho stupefied spectators began to think of Aldk^ ratlier than staring. Kiaa started from her trance of terror^ and was about to gather Lncy^siiead in her lap when Miss l-olby, the housekeeper, interposed, respectfully thrusting her away. ? For He.vren'6 sake, go back to your room, Mies Boauchanip !' she cried. ' This is no place jjbr yoa.' Dolores hastily broke upon the protest. 'Some styptic cotton/ she said, raising her ^bead-like eyos to Miss Dolby's pale face. *Is there any iii the house, ma'am ?' With as hasty a reply in the affirmative, .Miss J)olby turned and despatched one of the servants ?ia her own medicine closet. While she was thus engaged Nina again bent down to Lucy. \- But this time Dolores objected. ' Pardon me, Miss Beauchamp/ she said ; ' I would not disturb her head. The quieter she is ?kept the better. Ah ! that is something like V the suddenly exclaimed, turning from Nina to a Servant who at that moment hurried up with a iiandf ul of old linen and towels, and a sponge iand basin, of water. ? With an energetic rapidity, which no one' pre- sent coulS have equalled, she instantly set to Trorkto remove the ghastly traces of Lucy's dis aster ; and in a short time Nina had the satisfac tion of seeing .her unfortunate maid restored to -;oiiseiousness, and comfortably established in *ed. ' But how did you meet with the accident, :Lucy ?' anxiously inquired the girl, as she bent a moment over the recumbent form b ef ore return ing to her room. An odd look, which Nina did not observe, came into Lucy's eyes, and for an instant she hesitated. The next, she answered, slowly, feebly : ' I awoke awful sick this morning, and when you rang the last time I thought I would try again to get up/ ; ' Oh, Lucy !' exclaimed Nina reproachfully. Before she could say more the odd look deepened in. Lucy's eyes. The -woman had caught a glimpse in her dressing-glass of Dolores's dark face showing stealthily at the doorway. With a good deal of unnecessary energy, as it seemed to Nina, the maid went on : ' ? And no wonder I was sick, Miss Nina. I went to bed on a piece of cherry pie and a big glass of Irattermilk — * j; At Jikafc -point JDolores hurried naturally into the room, and addressed Nina. 'I heard one of t&e; servants saying the surgeon Jiad come, Miss Beauchamp/ she said. ' The surgeon ?' inquiringly echoed Luoy. ? * I sent for the nearest one that could be found,' {explained Nina. Before more could be said Miss Dolby^s voice' .?was heard approaching, with the stranger. '. Nina started hastily for the other door. There phe paused a moment and looked back at Lucy. ? ? Bequest Miss Dolby to come to my dressing room as soon as the surgeon leaves/ she said, hurriedly. * With that charge she disappeared, Dolores re tiring to the convenient seclusion of the b^H by 'which the surgeon was approaching. ' Lucy furtively watched the Spanish, woman in the glass, the same odd look of perplexity and anger in her eyes which had been there when speaking with Nina. ' It was some time before Miss Dolby made her appearance in Nina's dressing- room. She had taken a hurried bath, and was making her toilet when the housekeeper entered. \- Nina's first words -were an anxious inquiry after Lucy. Miss Dolby answered promptly with reassuring cheerfulness. ? ' Nothing worse than a disordered stomach, Hiss Beauchamp/ she said. ' The giddiness was the result of that, and but for the fall and cut she ?would have been about in a day or two. As it is, ehe has received a nervous shock, and will necessarily require a little more time to re cuperate. Lucy is not young, you know, Miss Beauchamp — past fifty, I have heard her say/ x ' But she is not seriously hurt ?' ' 'Oh, no. Miss Beauchamp. Pray don't dis tress yourself about that. Moreover, the doctor (will call again this evening/ i%: 'I wish they could wait a few days!! said Nina, abruptly, speaking to herself., *I don't like to leave Luoy behind, sick in bed.' ?? For a moment the housekeeper hesitated, look ing at the eirl as she stood gazing thouchtfullv at the floor. The next, she answered the ?words. 'I just met Sir .Eobert in the hall/ she said, 'and he spoke of fliat/ 1 Nina looked up at her with eager interest. \- ' He thinks I had better wait and join my friends when Lacy is able to travel?' she ex claimed.

She looked into the library, and, finding Sir Eoberfc there, entered. The unhappy old man threw down the paper he was vainly attempting to read, and welcomed her with his usual caressing tone. ' As I expeoted, I shall have to go, dear Robert/ said my lady, hurrying to him, and slipping her little, daintily-gloved fingers be tween his. Sir Bobert's only answer was a profound sigh. With that answer he rose, kissed her fondly, and attended ker to the carriage. Aa it rolled from the curb she burst into a soft laugh. ' I wonder what Sir Sobert would say if he could see where I first go, and for what purpose !'. ehe whispered to herself. _ . She allowed the coachman to leave Portland Place and then touched the check. The carnage stepped. The footman presented himself at the door. Lady Beauchamp gave her order. (to bm coktetobd.)
