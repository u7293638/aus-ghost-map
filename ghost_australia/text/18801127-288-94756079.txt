By Rose Hart wick Thorpe, Author of 'Onrfew Must Not Ring To- night,' 'The Red CroBB,' 'The Station Agent's Story.' &c.; «? Walk in, walk right in, you're welcome ; Whew ! how the wind whistles about. Take a chair close to the fire, sir; If s a bad sort of night to be oat. Yoa saw oar light through the darkness . And thought you would come ? That is right, Somehow my heart's warmer and softer On ev'ry such blusf rin' night. « Here, take a good drink from the bottle, 'Twill warm you. xon woa 1 i W ny not r You look liko you're needin' o' something And this is the best that Vve got. 'WeU, wife, just you get out some victuals, And inane a strong cap of tea, Aud while ehc'sa-gettin' 'em ready You'll take a good smoke with me ? 41 That's right, it seems kind o' friendly .And brotherly like, I think By th' w*y, stranger, 'tim't of ten That a man refuses to drink ! But just as you like. Hear the wind, sir, - A tearin' like all possessed,' ?? '? :: ?'.' As though ali the demobs o* darkness, Were troubled and couldn't rest. ?' You seem sort o' .pale like and nervous, Your walk was too much, I think ; Come to look, you're white as a ghost, sir ; Seems to me you'd better drink. ; - Well, well ',. I won't urge you, but really — What'sthat you're sayin'— this night With its storm makes y da think of another And the mem'ry saddens you quite ? *' It mast ha' been some tb in' dreadful To make you so tremble, I think ; You don't sat/, you lost wife and baby, : And aU through the demonp' drink ? 1 own I thought it was queer like, For 'moBt ev'ry one driaksj you know, - And I could'nt see why the tearin' O' the stormishould trouble you so. 'Mayhap if you'd tell me the story, . ' '.'. '^woold ease up your mind a bit. ' ' ' ~. *T was just such a night as i this one— Taint likely Til evier f orgit— That our blessing came, and somehow When the wind and storm are abroad, There's a queer kind 6' f eelin* iu here A sort o' thanksgivan' to Gjd. ** I don't take much stock in preachers, Can't say I believe in a hell; - ' LoveGod? Why bless you, sir, sometimes : ? J My thoughts aretoo precious to tell. , i When the long day's work is over, And I 'sit by toe fire at night — What's that you were say in*? Oh, sorely I couldn't ha*, heard you right. . ? . - : - *'IwaBa'tmore'nhalf wayliBtenin' — Tsthinkin'o' Dolly, you see.

That she went home kind o' early ; . ; -?.;__ , _ But they urged you to stay a spell, You told her you'd bring the baby, And see 'twas bundled up' well ? *' At last the wine you'd be'ndrinkin' Had somehow got into your head; : The wind and the storm were dreadful When you started for home, you said ? See here, stranger, '(wasn't near Alta, . Just five years ago tonight? Tm thinhin' o' that place always, So I couldn't a' heard you right. ' It was ? And the baby you held it And staggered on through the snow, ? Ycur brain growin' drowsy aai dizzy .9 And that is the last you know * Of tbatmght aid the storm, till some bae Found yia there crazy and wild, And carried you ihomej. but surely How, dida't they find the child ? ?cNq? well, I might, Vichown ifc, .; . ;. ..: . -; irom the first spmethin' told me, 'twas so.
