Old Davices of PLotographerz. * There are various ways for providingasor prising results'in photography, things that in one age would have been called magic, but in ours recogiis~ed as scientific tricks. .The ghost picture, for instance, in which a ebhdouy ghost-through which material objects are visible- is seen between natural ututtudes and occupstione. That is produced by an almost insOantanoous exposure of the ligure that is to'do duty as the ghost, fol. lowed by a full exposure of the figures and properties that are to appear natural. * Another novel trick was shown recently in a photograph reproduced by a prominent trade journal; which presented the proprietor scated at a table, playing chess with himself, sitting on theopposite aide of the table,while he,. himself, stood up in the background looking at his two selves playing. The figures wore all on the negative, which was produced by the su?eessire exposures of the plate;parts thareof being masked each time by a black velvet shutter. S:ill another sort of trick is that by which a pezeon who likes that sort of thing may ap. pear to be photographed riding upon a fly ing goose, or a fish, or any other desired style of ridiculous locomotion. This is done by the sntj ict holding upon his lap a huge piece of white or sky-tinced card with the fanciloul figure drawn upon it. His face appears above the upper edge of the card, and seems, in the picture, joined to the funny little body mounted on the goose or tisb. The statud picture is made by about the same deviEe.
