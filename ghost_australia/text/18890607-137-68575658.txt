Old Daviccs of Photographers. There are various ways for providing our. ptising results in photography, things that in one ago would have been called magic, but in ours recoguised as scienltiic tricks. Toe ghost picture, for instance, in which a shadowy gIhost-through which material objects are visible-is scen between natural attltudes and eccupatione. That is produced by an almost instantnoeous eaposure of the fiure that is to do duty as the ghost, fol. lowed by a full exposuro of the figures and properties that are to appear natural. Another novel trick was shown recently in a photograph reproduced by a prominent trade journal; which presented thoproprietor eeated at a table, playing chess with himself, sitting on theoppoeite side of the table,whilo he, himself, stood up in the beckgrcund looking at his two selves playing. The Ofiures were all on the negative, which was produced by the successive czpcsures of the plate, parts thereof being masked each time by a black velvet shutter. S:ill another sort of trick is that by which a person who likes that sor of thing moy ap. pear to be photographed riding upon a fly ing gooae, or a fish, or any other desired style of ridiculous locomotion. This is done by the subject holding upon his lap a huge piece of white or sky-tinted card with the fanciful figure drawn upon it. Ilis face appears above the upper edge of the card, end seems, in the picture, joined to the funny 1:ttle body mounted on the gcoee cr fisb. The statue picture is made by about the sam? devise.
