PUBLIC AMUSEMENTS. -AT THE 1 HI-AIUFS-The performance of " Hamlet" by a lady, to a certain extent precludes favourable criticism It i an scarcely be expected that the female mind, however gifted it may be, will fully comprehend the psychology of a character that, beyond all others, has baffled the most astute Itttciatcurs of all ages time it was written. The conception of the character varied with every great actor with Kemble, Hamlet was a cold and classic reasoner without any very apparent BLOW of sudden impulse Young bri ko m upon the icy picture with his manner tint, and gave to the audience the idea of a man forced to act on the compulsion of arbitrary circumstances, but irresolute in the course be should adopt, Edmund Kean followed the bent of his peculiar and mounted st) lo, and sacrificed the general grandeur of the character, in order to bring out in bold relief the E points he conceded would tell best with an audience, Charles Kean, on the other hand, was the opposite, and relied on a new reading of some portions of the navy, with studied attitudes and fruitless elocution, while the clear and beautiful enunciation of Phelps, and his wonderful correctness, mayor Varying a word from the text, is that fine actor s chief characteristic But it was reserved for aPrencbman to upset all the Englishman's preconceived notions of Hamlet, both in his pet soldier and his mental temperament M reciter reduced it occasionally to the level of lifchtcomed)-Hamlet appeared for the first time in Saxon hair and costume, a bit of a reveller, find of flowers and elegance in the arrangement of an apartment, rattling oil smart things with the abandon of a j ill) good fellow-and, with one leg thrown over the other (w wanting only a year to complete the picture of a man in a pleasant roveno),delivering the celebrated soliloquy on death been ter's portrait was at all events novel, so novel indeed that critics were nonplussed, and some praised without giving any very clear reason for so doing while others condemned, offering no more lucid grounds for their censure We can not presume to say which representation is the nearest approach to Shakspeare-though Young had perhaps the greatest number of admirers among those competent to judge in his day, and, from the r recorded opinions, it may be inferred that his Hamlet was a masterpiece of Thespian art in conception and development Mrs Charles Poole performed the club ractor well-forawoman1 but for the reason given above we cannot say that the performance was a successful one beyond the fact that it attracted large audiences on "Mond ty and Thursday evenings, comparison with actors who have appeared in the part is out of the question the public, no doubt, take the effort as a novel and during attempt to create a new sensation in dramatic impersonation The cast included Mr Burr) as the Ghost, Mr Bartlett as Osnc, Mr Vinson as Polonius, Mr Rayner as Laertes, Mr
