PICTURESQUE VICTORIA. . BY "THE VAGABOND." CROAJINGOLONG. No. III. After leaving Tungyhi we drive for a few miles over flats covered with wild oats until we strike the belt of timber bordering the River Cann. Suddenly we come upon a fence rail and a handsome white-painted gate. "Toorak?” I query in astonishment at seeing such an evidence of progress in this out-of-the-world spot. Through this gate and across a paddock, round the timber by the side of a deep lagoon, and the home stead of the Cann station is before us. It is a large, long, low build ing, situated on a high knoll, above flood level, dominating the flats below. Around it are a number of outhouses and the peaked roof of an old hop kiln is a pic turesque adjunct. Far away in the wilds it is strange to come across such a residence as this, which in any part of Australia would strike one by its romantic surroundings. Built of rough split slabs, with a bark roof and broad verandah, it is in complete accord with the scenery. A fresh painted weatherboard house would offend the eye by its incongruity, but this brown wood and bark structure seems exactly what one would wish in bringing in any traces of man’s occupation into the pic ture. One could not ask for a more comfort able residence. Silver wattles shade the yard, and in front there is a grand garden - beds of violets and geraniums and asters, with patches of strawberries and pumpkins and tomatoes. There is also an orchard full of thriving fruit trees. The lagoon is at the bottom of the garden, partly enclosed by the forest. There is in front of the homestead a fine open plain, where horses and cattle and pigs and turkeys, are feeding. And all around are the ranges. They stretch in every direction. Peaks un known and unnamed except it may be by Messrs. Black and Allan, who, in 1870-1872, struck the boundary of New South Wales and Victoria some 23 miles off. Perhaps this was one of the most wonderful examples of surveying in the world. The one com menced at Cape Howe, the other at Forest hill, near the Alps, on the Upper Murray. And their survey lines were within a few feet when they met after two years of hard work. I know no better description ot this border land than that given by Henry Kingsley in Geoffrey Hamlyn, the locale of which is placed in Maneroo and Croajingolong. He writes of it as "a new heaven and a new earth! Tier beyond tier, height above height, the great wooded ranges go rolling away westward, till on the lofty skyline they are crowned with a gleam of everlasting snow. To the eastward they sink down, breaking into isolated forest fringed peaks and rock crowned eminences, till with rapidly straightening line they fade into the broad grey plains, beyond which the Southern Ocean is visible by the white sea-haze upon the sky. All creation is new and strange. The trees, surpassing in size the largest English oaks, are of a species we haye never seen before. The graceful shrubs, the bright coloured flowers, aye, the very grass itself, are of species unknown in Europe, while flaming lories and bril liant parroquets fly whistling, not un- musically, through the gloomy forest, and overhead in the higher fields of air, still lit up by the last rays of the sun, countless cockatoos wheel and scream in noisy joy, as we may see the gulls do about on English headland. To the northward a great glen, sinking suddenly from the saddle of the hill on which we stand, stretches away in long vista, until it joins a broader valley, through which we can dimly see a full fed river winding along in gleaming reaches, through level meadow land, inter spersed with clumps of timber. We are in Australia, on the great watershed known as the Snowy River of Gipps Land " Henry Kingsley was as great a lover of Nature us his brother Charles Ile lived here on these borderS for a time, and knew what he was writing about. Yet how few read Geoffrey Hamlyn nowadays? Yet it is the best book descriptive of Australian life which I know of Not even "Ouidas ' J'nulelLitul can be more touching than the story ot the lost child in GeoJIici/ Hamliin And no othet man can describe the Upper Snowj as Mr Kingsley has done, or surpuss his bold imagery, such as "a great cape in the con fuient of timber which runs down from the mountains into the plains," which exactly convej B to the mind the appearance of the lar off sloping forests I little thought, when years back I read Oeoßiey Hamlyn m a village m Green County, State of New York, that I should ever be privileged to visit the scene of tne adventures of the Buckle)a, Brentwoods, and Hawkers, and to become imbued with the spirit of the author when he wrote of the Upper Snowy - "I heard a hoarse roar as if from the bowels of the earth, and found that I was standing on the edge of a glen about 400ft Jeep, through which a magnificent snow-fed mci poured ceaselesslj, here Hashing bright among bars of rock, there lying m daik, deep ronches, under tall, white stemmed trees Across the glen rose up a dark mass of timbered ranges, getting highei and steeper as fur as the eye could reach, while to the north east the river s course might be traced through the plains by the timber that fringed the water's edge, and sometimes feathered some tributar) gull) almoat to the lovel of the Hat lofty table land On either side of it, down behind down, folded one over the other, and bordered by great forests, led the c)e towards the river's Bource, till the course of the deep valley could no longer be distinguished, lost arnon,; the distant ranges, but above where it had disappeared rose a till blue peak with streaks of snow.

It is late when we get the buggy across the Bemm, on the other side of which I have to camp for the night. It is true Mrs Sumner presses me to sleep in her hut. They will make up a bed for me by the fire. But two families in a two roomed cabin seem to me quite enough for comfort, and I do not wish the good wife to "put herself out" on my account. Her kind hospitality I shall always remember. Like the cottage "Ned" Farmer made famous in his pathetic ballad, " Little Jem," this bark hut by the side of the Bemm is "wondrous neat and clean." Sitting by the ingle-nook after a good supper, I very much admire the patient way in which Mrs Sumner manages her four children, including the baby. They are being better brought up than many in the cities. I see now where " Jimmy" Shaw, the hired boy, gets his good manners from. My word, the mother has enough to do here. To cook the meals, nurse the baby, teach the two elder children their lessons, and hear them their prayers, makes up a consider able contract. But, as in their little white nightgowns, Nelly and May and Willie come toddling in and kiss me goodnight, My heart is filled with thankfulness that these little ones, although they only sleep in a bark cabin, have good food in plenty, warm fires, and a happy home-far different to the lot of their father's ancestors in England. For, as we sit at our supper of beef and apple pie and tea, which I enjoy as much as any banquet in the lordly halls, Harry Sumner returns. He enters with the peculiar stolid step ot the English labourer, still a strong and active man in spite of his 58 years. You cannot mistake the patient Wessex man. He is thoroughly English in his salutation to his family. What a fuss a French paysan would make in such case! But we Anglo Saxons feel quite as much as the Celts, if we do not wear our hearts upon our sleeves. With Harry is Mr Gurdon, the surveyor, whose men are on strike on account of the unavoidable short supply of tucker... Some 20 j ears back I knew in Liverpool Mr Charles Gurdon, a )Oung engineer, and became rather in tímate with him. Here in the wilds of Cioajmgolong I now meet his brother I leam that inj old triend "Charlie," the talented and promising, died of consumpt on in the Bouth of Trance VV ith this bond of reminiscence between us, I consent to Mr Gurdon camning with me on the other side of Bemm He has the tent which has been called "The Vagabona" by the importer, a bandy little thing similar to those in use in the tropics by the Trench troops But in weather like this we need no shelter One can sleep well under la belle étoile Ihe canvas, however, is us»ful, spread on the ground beneath us. A great fire is lighted, and we he with our feet towards this and talk of old days in Lanca shire and across the Atlantic.
