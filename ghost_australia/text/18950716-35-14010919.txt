He is perhaps prevented from doing so by the necessity of concentrating his attention upon a certain "knot of unscrupulous men, who by arts and artifices that would ill bear examination have obtained possession of the offices of State " At the (same time not too much importance is to be attributed to these bold, bad men who talk 01 then leader is but the childish monaco of a fe able bonnets," and they unhappily no but bogus democrats who have floated to the surface, but who will doubtless promptly sink into the depths of obscurity, now that there is no character is exposed As to the constitutional question it is disposed of in the remark that Mr. Japan has to thank his own arrogance and his own abusive tongue "-qualities to which Sir HENRY PARKES has a profound aversion and his notorious incapacity to wisely frame his measures," for most of his troubles with, the Legislative Council Sir In NeY PARKES then puts for ward his own policy, all of which is based on the belief in " the early federation of the colonies " In the meantime Parliament may properly occupy itself with small domestic reforms, including the passing of a local govern- most measure such as " was introduced by me in 1891, and was lost largely through the machinations of Mr REID, who joined the protectionist Opposition of the day to destroy it" "The protectionist Opposition of the day that is where the turpitude of those machinations lay Had it been an alliance with the protectionist Opposition of the present day, the transaction would have worn a different aspect While Parliament is busying itself with those blameless reforms it will avoid wasting its time with tinkering with impossible provincial tariffs" The fact is overlooked that while freetraders are thus bound over to observe the " truce of God," the field is left free for changes in the direction indicated by the protectionist leaders, who have never withdraw their pledge, if they got a majority, to " give the country real protection " But indeed it is needless further to dissent tina remark able manifesto So far as it presents a policy, it is open to the remark that while federation is tendered to us as a reason for abandoning fiscal and constitutional reform, no guarantee is given, or can be given, that it is possible at the present time to combine all of the colonies in laying aside all other matters and labouring for union The full significance of the manifesto, however is found not in the policy it professes to favour but in that which it would have the effect of obst noting and herein lies the source of those melancholy com parsons which its perusal can hardly fail to bring before the mind of the public As we pass through the stages of a crisis which has been produced by an attempt to alter the distribution of the burdens of taxation it is not em prising, nor is it unfair, that the existing distribution of those burdens should be closely scrutinised, and that the result of the proposed changes should be carefully examined This is a process of investigation which cannot be carried out too thoroughly But leaving now out of e, low the figures which have been put forward on this question, and attending only to the principles involved, it is well to recall to mind what these principles are It is to little purpose to engage in a discussion in which the opposite sides reason from entirely opposite sorts of assumptions The assumption involved in the taxation policy submitted to the country at the last election and then affirmed by mo doctors was that, in addition to the taxation to which all citizens are in some way or other directly or indirectly contributors, special taxation should be imposed upon wealth, with the object of roughly adjusting the pressure of taxation to the capacity of those who have to bear it. It would be to little purpose to engage in argument with those who refuse to con- cede this principle It is one which has the support of natural equity. and reason, it is announced by the highest. authorities, and it is in some form or other adopted in the taxation ss, stems of most IIMIISOII countries In this colony this principle of taxation has been affirmed several times in the Legislative a Assembly, and has formed part of the fiscal policy of the Government of Sir Pu HCk TlNMSOS, Sir lllîMlA Pvillvls, Sir Gi-mai- Davis, and Mr REID lines of tin so Ministers has been gilt in measures of taxation designed to spain of greater equity in the distribution of our taxation and better adjustment of the proportion of the burden to the means or supporting it Each of these Ministers declared that this more equitable arrangement could only be effected by lev ung a special and separate contribution upon wealth, and sought to compass this end by the imposition of direct taxation In view of these facts, and this universal admission of the government employed by those who now seek to obstruct its application, few would care to waste time over the discussion of a doct i in which has been underlying all of our taxation policies of the list ten years It may be said, admitting the principle Mr iviiDs application of it is open to objection We have never hesitated to declare that to our minds, very grave objections attached to those in asm PS We refer especially to the amount of exemptions, which impart a needlessly, class character to those taxes Cottle! those exemptions be removed or largely so duced, sons to give to the tax on wealth an iron of incidence covering all the wealth of the community, we should much prefer the policy of taxation This would give us At the same time, vi of cannot ignore, nor do we O feel called upon absolutely to condemn, the feeling growing in many, civilised communities, that the necessaries of life a perhaps rather adequate quantit*,-should be exempted from direct taxation The real question is, What is to be the practical conclusion in our These objections ' where no objections, mt near and inevitable once, to every form ofltaxntion VII taxation can only bonn nppioxitimtioi to equity The most elaborate and care fully balanced system army work very in equitably in practice If the objectors could see then went to eliminate the elements they oppose we should be glad to see this accomplished but if they use their objections as pietoxU for a ejecting the whole system, we would remind them that this is to maintain the system of protection, with all of its injustices and monopolies, in the face of its condemnation by the electors and their mandate for its removal The other wen Is this would be to make our objections of de till reason for disregarding the purpose which our whole constitutional system is formed to secure While wcrocognisotho fullest light and duty of every citizen to struggle for perfect equity in the distribution of exp Indianic, we emphatically refuse to follow the demand which seems now to be put for ward that close proportion is to be maintained between the contributions of special classes to the revenue and the .Khantugcs they are supposed to come from the open nature The demand is an impossible one and no statesman and not attempted to comply with it. The solo moral leniiireiiiont in regard to revenue is that it shall be fair and equitable, and adjusted to the capabilities of those who have to pay it the solo moral require ment in regard to expenditure is that it is demanded in the general interest of the State and of the community as a whole It is preposterous to insist that those classes who contribute most to the revenue should demo most benefit from the expense time or, conversely, that those who deem most benefit from expenditure should contributes most largely to the revenue The demand has never been recognised even in theory b> any financier 'The whole object and just fication of taxation are misconceived when it is argued that the poorer classes should be made to pay the greatest amount of taxation, since it is chiefly on their account that free schools, charities, and, it has even been cynically assorted, gaols, are established The only justification for taxing the community for free or assisted education is found in the belief that the community as a whole is benefited by the education and enlightenment of the people As to charities, if it were really contended that a proportion should be observed between class benefit and class contribution, the logical issue of the principle would be that only the absolutely destitute could be taxed for the relief of destitution The whole contention is not only absurd, it is dangerous in the highest degree It calls into life questions which it is by no means desirable to raise If this principle is over to find acceptance, would it not be a perfectly just Nemesis if a party were to spring into existence after using that, since the security of property depends wholly on our system of police and justice and punishment, on precautions being taken lost people be driven into crime by hunger, and on the proper education and enlightenment of the masses, the whole of the cost of legislative and. administrative Government should be put on the property which Government is mainly designed to protect ? In view of the fact that all methods of govoruniontaro more or less incomplete, and that all systems of justice me but approximate, We may well hold that all rational demands mo acquitted when we Bock to make our system of taxation just and equitable, and to lost our expenditure on the reasonable wants and necessities of the community, and the contentment and progress of the people as a whole It is a good man j' generations ago Since the popular idea of the Frenchman hold sway in England Long after the Battle of Waterloo, UUONAI mr was represented, not only in the creatures and lampoons of the day, as a sort of in credible monster who only Yvantod certain appendages to make him easily recognisable as a near relation to the Evil One, but the distorted view had taken a firm hold of the popular imagination as well 'THACKERAY has alluded to it in some of his " Founded about Papers," and helped as well, by the aid of social satire, to disabuse the minds of his countrymen of several absurd superstitions Since then the insular mind has gone on progressing in regard to the Grave and polite nations whose shores are but a stone's throw away, so that now even the great English proletariat never thinks of the pion as a man of frog orders, given 0101 to casual revolution and occasional social saturnalia If, indeed, the modern Englishman still fails to comprehend the national evil" and 17th of the spirited nation across the gray waters of the Channel, that sony because in his hopelessly foggy and dispirited island the elements for such priceless appreciation are not How can it be expected that homely English intellects should grasp that endless vivacity which makes the French the most graceful and careless people of the nations? And as that point of sympathy is apparently unobtainable, it is perhaps idle to speculate on the intellectual gulf that separates the two nations.
