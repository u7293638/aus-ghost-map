PORT ADELAIDE RACING CLUB. A SUCCESSFUL MEETING AT CHELTENHAM PARK. The Port Adelaide Racing Club were fortu- nate on Saturday, September 19, in having a fine day for their Spring meeting, -but were un lucky in clashing dates with the Agricultural Society, whose horse-jumping contests were taking place on the same afternoon. This had the effect of dividing the .spectators who have linrsptr nrnRlivif-.ipR. und mnnp nf loaiaf: n. nrmrtla of thousand difference in the attendance at Cheltenham Park. As it was between four and five thousand people were present, and £5,055 passed through the totalizator, nearly corresponding with the amount in vested on the same day of last year. The improvements recently made were well appreciated, and although luckily the new casualty-room was not needed we found on in spection that it was comfortably furnished and supplied witlrall the requisites in case of acci dent. The committee nave already expended a total of over £4,000 on their hew course, and it only needs another season to make it one of the best- appointedaswell as prettiest courses in the colony. Suffering like other plar- es from the want of rain the course was pretty hard, but the couch grass has made a beginning at * growing, and green herbage has taken the - place of weeds all over the centre of the ground. . The enclosures were a little dusty for want of water, but this defect will soon be remedied, and all who were present on Saturdas' ap peared to bo enjoying themselves, and the number of ladies was larger than ever before. The Go-vennncnt was represented by the Hon. the Premier and Parlia ment by the members for the district. The caterer, Mr. Mugga ? provided a good luncheon and afternoon tea, and Mr. Ben. C, Young and his aids had the arrangements of the day very well carried out. The afternoon's racing commenced with tha Trial Stakes, special weights, over six furlongs.' Owing to Alveary having an attack of influenza she was scratched, and seven starters were taken in hand by Mr. Formby, who as usual held the flag. A favorite was found in The Idler, with Bridal Morn and The Rector next in request. A surprise was in store, however, as the winner turned up in Longbow, ridden by Hodgkins, who got home first by half a length from Bridal Morn, The Idler being a neck away third. The winuer is by Lord Byron— Edith, and ran recently at Kapunda. He paid a dividend of £21 IDs. to those who were fortu uate enough to get on him. For the Hurdle Race the pen was put through the names oC Conscript and Dianthus, leaving half a dozen to fat-e the starter. It was given out that Rosed ale had been schooling well over the sticks, and she was made a bit better favorite than Home Rule, Snowdrift having the next call, Honie Rule lost his chance by jump ing the hurdles and the fence into the course at the same time, and thus was out of the race. This left a clear chance for the favorite, who waited on Snowdrift till the latter led into the straight. Holmes then gave Rosedale her head, and she scored a win very easily by three lengths from Snowdrift, who was four lengths in front of Paul Jones. Dividend, £2 17s. Credit is due to Mr. W. Mallen for getting a win over sticks from this mare on the first time of asking, and she will no doubt be heard of again at the same business. The big field of 15 went to the post for the Flying Handicap, My Novel and Diadem being most in demand. Electric put up 7 lb. penalty and led from start to finish, the issue never being in doubt. Successor filled second place, and Fair Saxon and Recoup ran a dead heat for third position. The winner paid the big dividend of £11 3s. There were cries from the crowd of 'What about Kapunda?' and Electric's easy win on Saturday will no doubt be remembered when the Kapunda running is under consideration by tho com mittee of the S.A.J.C. In connection with the Steeplechase Stockings was tiie only absentee, and seven runners went to the post. Eclipse, The Ghost, and Young Lucifer were most in favor at the machine. The Ghost and Postal, however, were the first pair to throw up the sponge, as they stopped at the first fence. Postal was taken over, but again stopped at the nest fence. Strike cried a go at the first of the quadruple, where Repetition also stopped. The race then lay between Eclipse and Young Lucifer, who performed together until the last feuce was readied, which Young Lucifer struck hard enough to bring him on to his knees aud nose and throw bis rider from the saddle. Hop wood, however, quickly remounted just as Woodfield came up, and the pair made a race home for places, Eclip30 having won by a street. The riders were cheered for their efforts, and if Young Lucifer had got safely over the last obstacle there would have been an exciting finish between him and Eclipse. Dividend, £2 9s. For the Spring Handicap the pen was put through the names of The Hector and Regent. A favorite was found in Trout, with Mompa and ISiackara . well supported. The early tunning was cut out by Mompa, but My Novel came with a wet sail at the finish and won easily by a length and a half from Wahine, who was half a length iu front ' of Fair Saxon. Conscript dieaijpointed his parly by finishing last but one. M.y Novel paid a dividend of £8 17s. The last event of tho day was the Totalizator Handicap, for which nine runners went to the post, Successor being the only absentee. The Idler was madd favorite, Doubloon and Bridal Morn being next in request. The finish was an excit ing one, as Bridal Morn aud Doubloon came home locked together, and man}' people thought it was a dead heat, but the judge-'a verdict was a 'nose' iu favor of Bridal Morn, Cigarette filling the third position.. Divi dend, £7 6s. Rogers rode the winners of the last two races. After the Steeplechase the stewards called up Farrow, the rider of Repetition, who kept his horse on the course in the way of Eclipse and Young Lucifer, and might have caused an accident. On admitting his error Farrow was let off with a caution. TRIAL STAKES. Of 45 sove. ; secoud horse to receive 5 eovs, out of the stake.

Before the hurdle in front of the stand was reached Home Rule had assumed command from Rosedale, Paul Jones, and Happy Jack,. who were together. Snowdiift and Orb were six lengths away in the rear. Home Rule showed the way round the turn just in advance of Paul Jones, Happy Jack, and Rosedale. -The two leaders had not been overtaken at the next fence, and were out from Happy Jack, while Home Rule spoilt his chance by jumping into the course. Happy Jack ?was first over- the next obstacle, and then came Paul Jones two lengths clear of Rose dale and Snowdrift. Happy Jack maintained his lead whilst passing the seven-furlong post, Paul Jones and Rosedale being the next pair, while Orb was still at the rear of the Held. The two leaders were showing the way with four lengths to the Rood from Rosedale and Snowdrift at the six-furlong post. Orb was fiix lengths away. Snowdrift joined the leaders at the next jump, and the trio led past the half-mile post, Rosedale taking the jump in front of Paul Jones.

The start took place at the milepost, and the first fence was taken by Eclipse, while Postal stopped. Young Lucifer and Strike went safely over, but The Ghost followed Postal's example. Woodfield Was the last to rise. The next obstacle was safely negotiated by the favorite in front of Young Lucifer, Strike, Repetition, and Woodfield. Postal and The Gboat, who had again put in an appearance, disappointed their backers by stopping again. The fence at the three furlong post 'was jumped by the two leaders, Strike being next and Woodfield fourth. Repetition stopped. Mr. Cudmore's colors were seen -going over the first of the quadruple in advance of Mr. Hopwood's gelding. Strike refused the jump and Woodfield was then left a bad third. From this point the race resolved itself iuto one between Eclipse and Young Lucifer, as Woodfield was too far off to be dangerous. The pair kept on fairly even terms after leaving the straight and gave place to one another until the last fence was being, negotiated, when Young Lucifer spoilt the good finish which seemed to be in store for' the onlookers and fell. Eclipse went on and won as he liked. Woodfield had just taken the obstacle which had been the downfall of Mr.. Hopwood's gelding when the latter was re mounted and made a good fight for second position, and although making ground fast could not catch Woodfield. Time, 5 min. 1 sec, SPRING HANDICAP.
