We have received from an old resident of ' Charters Towns, now inSydiiey, ji pamphkt beaded " Sydney Interactional Exhibition of 1879\. The Queenslaud Court. Rise and Pi-O gress of Queensland Industries-MJ." ft | printed by J. H. Reynolds, George-street, Brisbane, and we presume by the authority ot tlie Queensland Commissioners. Now trill it be believed by any Queensland miner that this pamphlet, pretending to give an account of the goldfields of this colony, docs not contain the word Charters To were or any allusion to it. Tbe msh tp Canooua, Kavenswood, Gympie, the' Palmer, Bbdgkiosoti, Etheridge, and GPberton, are all mentioned, but not a word about Charters Towers or Millcbester. fo~e should like to ask Mr. Gresley Ti«fcin, who ought to know soraediingalxtatOiartexsTowexB, how this omission occurred. Was it pre meditated? The only thing that makes ok doubtful of a Brisbane plot isjthat tbe famoog. Enoggera goldfield near Bwnhmm is also omitted, not a word said about it. "Hiere was actually a warden's ease lately from that field, and it is made the most of fay the Brisbane papers. We hope when the Commissioners send in their " little bill" to the Assembly Mr. Stubley will ask for an explanation and ask who wrote the pamphlet. by whoee authority and how much be got lor ** wiping out" Charters Towers. It is a g.aadatoas piece of work, aud a disgrace to the Com missioners, as well play Hamlet with the Ghost left oat.
