A CONVENTIONAL DREAM. Er MiMnEtKo. To say that I have been cruelly exercised in mind pondering the electoral dooemvirato for our beloved colony is only to say that I am in the same care as thousands and I use the word "pondering" with intent, as the participle of a verb active, seeing that the process of weighing the claims of 19 candidates has been the rub, appraising their qu fire irons and valuing their disqualifications, and sadly endeavouring to strike a balance I have even gone so far in my anxiety to solve the problem as to borrow a ballot box and 49 marbles, gumming a name on each marble, and then as the clock struck midnight, with face point- ing to the Southern Cross, bareheaded and murmuring the prayer of a Roman augur (us nearly as I could remember the form), I had of turned the handle of the cylinder and drawn forth lOmirblos, to find that the ballot was never meant for this business, for a more excruciatingly absurd result could not have been secured had I picked my 10 deliberately for some menagerie of incongruities Then there was the Prrmatial prayer Bilton consideration this did not seem to the purpose It looked like jumping before you caught sight of the fence And here I desire to record my humble agreement with a recent criticism in these columns, and to repeat that the letters need prill- ing for, and praying it, and prayer generally, quite as much is the elected delegates and the bigger your electoral college, I submit as a logical proposition, the more it needs praying for, collectively) and individually, and to die in diem, and mine pt of time, and any other way you like to offer it up The ballot, then, and Pnmntral prayer affording me no help, I tried Sortes Virgilianrc, Dominican, Biblical, and Shakespeare, but entirely without success, the words would not fit with the names of the candidates, and, as Malvolio puts it, " there was no conservancy in the equal" Then I proceeded somewhat more deliberately and (if I may so) mathematically) Baling constructed a seven square frame (7 x 749) I place (a square in each of 19 compartments, labelled with the name of a candidate, then in", rug procured a girl 7 years old, the initial letter of whose baptismal name was C (C stands for Convention), and the square root of 19 being 7, I had her blindfolded, and then desired her (this time at noon, and midnight) to draw 10 squares from the compartments This was done 19 times Result Square root of all in regard to value Thereupon, I proceeded more circumspectly thit is to say, more mather tically Clearly it was necessary for me to consider the problem algebraically and with more thoroughness One important question was, how many combinations of 10 this list of 49 candidates permitted and it was desirable to know this, because time was getting short Of course the formula must be set- <rPr>-= star, or Â«JnCr>=n and) (n-2 plus 1) 12 r that is to say a n C F > = 40 18 10-12 3.10 The Lord knows what, for I have never had time its to do the sum j Not having leisure on hand to thoroughly explore the question and work out the formula, and fearful lest the polling day should find me man abject condition of unreadiness, I fled for succour to a friend who, in virtue of a well-balanced mind and a special knowledge of general and particular average, is often employed as an arbitrator When I had made a clean breast of my trouble, he clapped me on the shoulder and remarking, parenthetically, that I was 1 certificated idiot advised me to waste no more time over the election, but to just start out and " split the difference " between the five freetraders and five protectionists, best and best Sir John Robertson, said he " a great ally of mine, was once troubled with the Local Option question and the Drink Bill but he took the shortest cut to it quiet mind, by appointing a Royal Commission, half of whom drank nothing stronger than gingerbeer, and half nothing- weaker than beer without the ginger That Commission was always known as the Shandygaff Commission, and its report did not bear the title friend ' depart Enough Said'" departed, and did my best to do likewise, no need), to ticket five freetraders and five protect unionists, and after several struggles, produced the following equation, for private circulation only, of course - x = n-tCxMxnxW(f) A x S x 6 x L x M (p) and converting these symbols into human values wohaveB r,C s, M mR deW.. o divided by A T (J) B H, O r (Q C ) , Le and -i M n This, then, was to be my freetrade protection bunch, or, if you prefer it, my " Shandy gail nomination " for the great New South Wales Convention Stakes, and the more I meditated and rehearsed it, the more comfortable it seemed for days I felt like the boy who has got the shoe of Christmas pudding with the shilling in it.
