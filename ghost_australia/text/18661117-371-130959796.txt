AT THE ADELAIBE TOWN HALL. 1 . TO THE KD1TOB. _ As this entertalBment Jwas nuder sndi distinguisbed patremaige, I adopted the jgniae 1 of a moit&l;, --and att^ded ^unotnaUy .ai o,-dockl past as the Bhow 55*^ -about pd isom-j ?menoe^' The ball'was bomfoxtably' £Dled with : a highly Teapf^taiblo andien^^hp ^Il eee^ed^ be^t jaa Zexsa&nait;&ig; ^ ? WelL ^jn0o^^4^^b^l'i«yr. and' ..-fche' Chxi^^s nled on to -i^^laiifonn isomewbat ^rl^t^rlyV aiid befere taMug tiieir ^eatg sang' ^Cted' Ble^ t3ie Prince of Wales™ in tole«bty ^ood style, excepting' th&t; thegeotleiian who aut-g the Jiret aelo was alitele tueby. .Next the instrumental portion --3 i&e; ?com- pany went through Jtheoyerfcure to the ''-Cdiph of Bagdad,' but thp'first'yiolin was esceedin^y flat, and galloped 011 as if be were in u hurry to get iihrough with it. Tl%was followed .by the 'Gipsies' Chorus' frop) the ' Bohemia^ .0ifl,* sang -without iqin-3i regard to piano or i^rjse parts. i (Mr. T. Mortiiger next essayed to ain» ' Dear mother Pll come hoine1 again, ** but as %e 'had 09! sufficient confidence in Ins powers, the 8«mgjras very weak and devoid of expression. 'The next oq the program n^e was a comic i song by Mr. Jeff Hprion, ' I'll throsy myself away,' and he did throw bimpelf away, and hammered his poor tambourine until I thought he would knock it all te pieces. ^Thig was followed by 'Ob gently lnreathe,** ! by Mr. W. V^ijom Tbisis-avefy pi^tty song, ! but'uhe chorus completely spoiled the beauties 1 of it. . | Bradder Bones thenperpetxateci '-Hold your; liOBjes,' and* here again the chorus was con siderably at fault-, as tnev did not take ud tbe last note at the proper tiuje. If that mother betting oe- me' was one of the best sgngs of the eyening, being rendered with considerable taste and feeling by Mr. H. Pearee, the chorus taking up the strain in good sjbyle. ' Tapioca' is a great comic song when well rendered, llf. Horton de^eryes great credit for ' the naaunar in which he sang- it, g.jjd kept the audience in a roar all throa^i. Mr. J. Horton then saag ' I long for my htane in Kentuck' pretty fairiy, but he Beemed as if he -vas afraid some gushing young lady was looking at him all the time. The ' Coon Hunt' came next, by Mr. Harry Har court, and showed a great want of practice. As a finish to the firet part the whole com pany did the celebrated ' Anvil Chorus' from Jll Trovatore,' which from the frequency cf ;its production is nearly used up, and might have been replaced with something new. The instruments, especially the first Violin and the violin dello, were again at a los$, however, the comicalities of the bla^&sinith; up for 4t to some extent. ' The Becond parjt cprnmenced with the 'The Huntsman's Cbonis' from 'Dcr Preitiiutz' and ? was sung without regard to tmje, especially the second tenor's, who gal loped °ff at .a fusions pace. The b3£§ wsa yery weak in the low notes. The duet by two violins was pretty fair, but became almost an infliction from its extreme length. When the ' De$th of Bcjson ' is put into a programme I always expect a treat, but it was not at all a treat— far from it, the gentleman's yoi pa shook and quiyered like mad, and I thought that K thfe author were preseuthe would fancy IJelgoa was being tilled over again, Mjr. A. J. Burnett next- put in an appearance with an English concertina, and played pretty well, but he waived it about as if it bad ^ggteUded him. — .lykyt. rmrnp the gjiaftette, Foresters soimd the .cheerful horn,' and ip TEhls 'the alto was scarcely audible, whilst- the ribcond tenor roared out to let everyone know he was aliv*. and well, especially about tie lungs. Mr. Vernon then gave ' Mndoline,' a very pretty ballad nicely snng. This gen. -Ionian possesses a fine voice, but he dees not £x.ow how to use it all. If he would open Sis throat a little more it would be of great advantage to bin*, and ploase hie audience a deal better. Tiiis .was sucee--ded by ' The moon has raised her lamp above' from the ' Lily of Kilaxney,' J^y Messrs,. MoyUmejc a#d Horton. Very passable indeed. Thsdpfcbnd part w^,s brought to a coneluciou jffith ,we ' Soldiers* Chorus' from -? Faust, ' and I never heard it 6ung better since I've been a ghost, and the .company deserve great credit £$r the manner in which they pro duced it. And now we come to the comic part of the entertainment, and begin with 'Dancing mad,' a most laughable arrangement ; it almost -made me wish I had never baeome a ' ghost It was a pity ose of the lunatics did uot take a little caose care in fixing himself up, ' but altogether it was the funniest tiling- of the whc#e evening, and I'll be bou&d; gn&ny; & side ached that night. The ' Nigger Paganiai' is perfect nonsense, and ^should be left e.ut in future, for the gen tleman who tried it had no conception of the character. ' The ' iStnmp speech *' was also a failure ; the ' lecture, evidently forgot his part, and left eat all iiie local hits, and .put inn. whole lot -of rubbish. The 'Swart boy' was a perfect cure, and knew wiiat be was doing; his acting and grimaces kept the people in one continual OTM-'Cm-mn first to last. I would like to know who made his boots, and whether there are any like -them to be procured. lift- Burnett may be right, or Fancy he is, but when I was in the land of the lining a theatrical manager was sagjsosed to be a gen tlemanly individual who understood grammar and tiie English language, but to hear a' manager say ' I 'thought I -se«n somebody' seems rather vulgar and rather ungrammatical too. - . ' I ought not 'to 'be loo napdon the Original Amateur Chri^tys, because I think thoiis was: the best performance ever given in the Town Hall, and I only say to them keep on practising aT,d giving entertainments for charitable and benevoieni ofcaejets, amj you may be sure you -will go through safe. It is alniest time 'for me to return to the ' fire-plaee and put en some fresh sulphur; so ' I'll ^.y good bye, O.A.G.M.; be good boys, and don't make such a mess of it next tigie, . and I will . come and see you again, yours, 4c-, ?
