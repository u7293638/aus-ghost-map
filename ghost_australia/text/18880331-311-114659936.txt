• AN INQUISITIVE BAKER. Dr Donovan, a phrenologist, with a view 1 to the " main oliance," persuaded as many aa hu c'onld to have plaster casts taken of their heads. What could be nicer thai to hove a permanent record of your posses sion of thebumps of self-esteem, venora tion, firmness (great stress laid on firm ness), time, tune, order, individuality , and benevolence ? The proposition "ff-as so I self-evident. Dr Donovan was of opinion j that a man's head was at his'best at I middlo life, and "might alter." ''Have a cast taken whilo you are young," he suid ; "I'll do it for a guinea." Bo. a number of men agreed to go to a room running out of the Mecbanics'Institution of .'the town and have the basts' taken. Donovan put them all on the ground in a row, poured the white plaster round their heads and leit the mixture to dry while'.he went out to have a look round, when an inquisitivo baker's man coming past-with a large board lull of dishes of meat pud-. dings and pies on his head thought he would look in the room and see what was going on. As he opened the door some of the wearers of the cast sat up. The man was horrified. He thought he had walked into a cemetery by mistake. With ■» loud shriek ht jumped back. Down went all the dishes on to the ground as the man bolted for dear life. A. dozen families lost their dinner that morning, and the baker lest his reason; to his dying day he gibbered and babbled of ghosts, and nothing' could bring him round.—, Echo.
