TWO SISTERS. I CHAPTEK XVII. fWx must go back afew days to watch with Dick . iStanmore through the sad sorrowing hours that . Jsucceeded his stepmother's ball. I tniBt I haTe mot so described this gentleman as to leave aii jimpression that he was what young ladies call a ^romantic person. Romance, like port -wine, \- iaftex-dizmer slranbers,- flannel next the skin, and , iSuch self-indulgences, should be reserved as a ilnxury for after-life ; under no circumstances :must it be permitted to impair the efficiency of imanhood in its prime. Dick Stanmore to** hie ipuniEnmenr wren me Mntian pmci ana perana icity. It was a 'facer.' As it could not possibly Jbe returned, his instincts^prompted him to ' grin jand bear it.' He had sustained a severe talL ?Trig first impulse was to get up *gn.iii None the jless did nerves *TirfM and! brain spin with the jforco and agony of the blow. Perhaps the very mature that most resists, suffers also the most. i severely from such shocks, as a. granite 'walli 'cracks and splinters totthe round shot, -while .an Jearth-work accepts that rushing missile -with a 'stolid harmless thud. Dick's composition was at least not earthy [enough to let him go to )-ed after 'liiis recent 'downfall of his hopes. Bestless, hurt, sorrowful, ?angry with hiTng^ifj not her — for his nature could ?be gallantly loyal under1 defeat — sleep was as im ipossible as any other occupation requiring jquietude and self-control. So. The only thing 'to be. done was to smojee, of course t and then to Jpack up everything 4he could lay hands on, ; without delay, so aa to leave Londen -that very Imorning, for any part oftEngland, Eotrope, or the .'habitable world. All places would ?be alike to! ihim now, only the farther, from Belgrkve Square the better. Therefore ifc ?was, perhaps, that, after shamming to breakfast, -and enduring con ?siderable pain in a state of enforced activity, 'while his servant completed their travelling larrangements, he drove through this very square, ??ttKW^b. it lay by no means in a direct line for the railway station to which he waa bound. Those who believe in ghosts affirm that » diseml»died spirit ihaunts the place it best lov\ed on earth ; and iwhat are we but the^hosts of our former selves, 'when all that constituted tho j£th and colouring land vitality of our lives has patssed away. Ah ! ILady Macbeth's are not the piily white hands ?from -which that cruel stain can nover-be removed. .'There are soft eyes and sweet smiles and gentle whispers enough in the world ginlty of moral' ! manslaughter (I believe the culprits themselves ?eall it ' justinahle homicide ')^ not entirely 1 divested of that malice prepense Trtfich constitutes r ;the crime of murder ! Happy tflie victims in a iwhom life is not completely extingnifihed, wlxo ^recover ttieir feet, bind up their wannds, and 'undeterren. by a ghastly experience, hazard in imore encounters a fresh assafisinlntion of the lieart. Such fortitude would hava afforded a :remedy to Dick Stanmore. ' Wanteli— a lady V' ? should have been the motto «mTda^»ned on his jbanner if ever he turised-hack infcoj the battle ?once more. Homraopathy, no- doubt, fli the treat Iment for a malady like that which yjrostrat&l; Ithis hapless sufferer, — hon*Bopaftiy, atffirstdis Jtrusted, ridiculed, accepted only »ander protest, iand in accordance with -3ie farce of\ circuin ?stances, the exigences of the position ; gtadually ifound to soothe, to revive, to ameBiorate/iill^at ^last it effects a perfect andfciirmph«,nt cure, naj% ,'even shows itself powerfnKcnougl;to produce** 'second attack of the same natuue, fierce anir virulent as the first. But, meaxqpriiile, Dick ?Stanmore followpdihoghoBt'cexampte, anddrove\ \sadly through Belgraye Sqoare, as he told him iself, for the last— last time ! Hadqhe been an -hour later,- just one hour, . he mightihave token iaway with him a Bubject: for considerable epecu lation, during his proposlsd travel^ in search of : distraction. This is what be -would have seen. A good-looking bad-looking .man, with dark ;eyes and hair, sweeping a» erossmg- very inem ?ciently, while he watched' the adjacent street iwith an air of eager anxifity, foreign to, an oecu jpation which indeed seems- to demand unnssal philosophy and composura of mind. Presently., ?Maud Bruce, tripping daintily acnoas the path he* ymd. swept clean, let herself ifijfco the square *gard.ens, dropping her glove ia|j|£-innady street jas' she took a. pase-kgy from i^r jwckeli.. Tlie .crossing-sweeper pounced i# it like a faawk, stack ?his broom against a lamp- post^and harried round ito the other side of the square. Hore Maud appeared at the gate, while ;' Gentleman Jim,' for it tibs none other, re ?turaed her glove without a word through the iironbars. - ? ? 'I hardly expected yon so ?coon,' said Miss JBruee. ' My letter could os^r have-been posted jafc five fbia morning.' 'You' might ha' made ettre Fd come that iiastant, miss/ answered Jim^Ms facabrightening ?with excitement and delimit. ' I kuowed who ^twas-from, well enough, tiiodeh 'twas but a line tas a man might say . I ain't Ihad it am hour, an* there I am, ready and willingtfor your job, be it fwhat itmay !' ' You're a bold fellow, I know,' eaid Hand, ''but it's a desperate undertaking-. If you don't hike it say so.' . Jim swore a horrible oath, and-then drew his jhand across hifilips aa-thoughto wipe away its ?traces. ; 'Look'ee here, miss/ he muttered in a hoarse ithick whisper. 'If you says to me, Jim, gays jyou, go and. rob that there church — see, now, I'd jhave the wardsof the big key in war , ah ! this iweary arternoon. If you says to me, says you, jjim, go and cat that there parson's throat,, I've igot a old knife in my pocket as I wouldn't want (to sharpen afore the job was -done, and' the {parson, too, for good an' all !' , There was a peculiar grace in the setting on ofj JHaud's head, especially in the firm lines of her- jniouth and chin.
