The crippled and the dying were left to their fate" in the hurrying on of the gallant 101 sportsmen, and some 2000 were driven into a small enclosure, where they were dispatched by tlie clubs of the barbarians—fitting implements of slaughter for such ruthless savages. : And this—be it remembered—was dnine in a Christian land, that boasts of its superior intelligence ; of its institution for the amelioration of the miseries suffered by dumb animals ; and abOVe all for the extensive ministrations of eveiy shade of creed. It was evidently " for sport" that the hundred arid one assembled for the common purpose of this cruel hunt; and, therefore ,what other inference can be drawn than that it is only the pressure of the law that restrains their passions from a development in a more serious direction. ' It T is "a pity that the names of the originators and leaders of the party have not been published ; but I trust'they will become known,and given to the world. That the kangaroo, when in large numbers, is very destructive of grass, and that when the female is hotly pursued she will eject her young from her pouch, is all admitted ; and, parenthetically, I may remark that she is -the only animal not possessed of maternal affections : but why this brutal battle.: why-this pleasure-muster • with such savage triumph over the dumb, and exquisitely beautiful denizens of our hills and plains : wKy : did not some ofthB hundred and one fall back to the rear and place the wounded out -of pain J .

Harrison called at this office on Monday* ^with'' -ten.' -'ounces of gold which he extracted from , twenty-six, cwt. of quartz by 4 mea^ o,F. his machine.' The quartz was obtained from ..the reef of Daly and party at Ringwood, within the distance from the metropolis already stated. This reef has been successfully worked during- the past ; two, years as an antimony mine, but this is the firsttimepayable gold has been struck*; . The gold is obtained in the same reef producinofthe, antimony, and besides the ten ouncos ofgpld, antimony to the value of £5 has been obtttiniSi from the quantity of quartz mentioned. The prospect was obtained at a depth of 100 feet, and was the result of three men's work for one week .with a common windlass. The result Of the' crashing has created considerable "excitement in the neighbourhood of the mine —The Bendigo Independent reports that , considerable excitement was created in mining Circles on Saturday by a report that a new reef had been discovered between the Mary Macdonald arid Carshalton lines, a small crushing from which was stated to have yielded the magnificent return of 114 ounci • to the tun. It appears that a.bput a fortnight ago a coloured man named Todd, whilst engaged in grubbing a stump, .came upon a well-defined lode at a depth of three feet from the surface, about midway between the Carshalton and Mary Maodonald Reefs, and to the east < t Dick's and Cullen's Tributes. The reef consisted of sandstone and lara, showing good gold in the solid stone, and having a hanging wall and font wail • it was 3 inches wide at the top, after being followed down a distance of about 35 feet, it increased to 18 inches in thickness, carrying galena and gold, and altogether bearing a riiost promising appearance. The discovery was kept very,quiet until last Saturday, Todd in the meantime having taken three other persons into his confidence, and obtained a tribute from the North Whip Company, to whom the grounds belongs, and on the day named a trial crushing of 10 tons was put through the batteries, and yielded the capital average return of lloz. lOdwt.' to the ton. The ground haB several times been puddled.,over, and was famous for its rich surfacing, a number of fine specimens having been met with from time to time, but no other indications of the existence of a reef. Several claims have been taken up, and one or two of these, we believe, have got the reef—and it has been stated that the lode can be distinctly traced through the ground of several companies in the direction of the Morning Light, Frasor's, and-South Alliance. On account of the shallow depth at which the reef was found, miners arid others of limited means arc greatly excited, and siiall claims are being taken up in all directions. ^Fhe reef'has been named e Todd's New Discovery, and if (the truth has not been greatly exaggerated, it seems that the next impetus that mining is to receive must be looked for in this direction.—Leader. ?
