SELECT POETRY. SILVERY RIPPLES. I TINfe we oftep bring the clouds. : That float around in shledows, And they, like ghosts revivcdin shrouds Of memories cnwrap us; As dailydown our path we onward wend, Nor see the sindling sunbeams round us spend Their silvery ripples. I know that as through life we tread Engrouscd in care and sorrow We miss the brightness overhead, And seldom thlink tomorrow Could ever steal the .darlings playiing round, Coiuld ever hush that laughing, merry sound Of silvery ripples. , The stunmor shadows fl6ating o'qr . Where the sasid'arid waters meet Enrich the beauty of the sho~e' . And the wavelets at our fef ; I'm sure that if we wouldmore careful be T?he rippling tide would bring to thee and meoro silvery ripples. * More silvery`S ripples.
