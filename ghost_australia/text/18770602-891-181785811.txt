FUNNIMENTS. HOW TOM SAWYER GOT HIS PENCE WHITEWASHED. ' Tom Sawykb. having offended Ms solo guar-, i diani * Aunt Polly, is by. that .sternly affec-. | tionateidame punished "by being'set to white wash thefenoo in front of the garden.- • Tbo world seemed a hollow mockery to Tom, who | had planned fun for that.day, and who knew that he would bo the laughing-stock of all the. ' hoys when; they came past and saw him set to [ work like a " nigger." But a great inspira tion buret upon Mm, and he went tranquilly to work. = What that inspiration was will appear i fro in what follows. < One of the hoys, Pen Bogcrs,. comes by and pauses, eating a par ticularly fine apple. Tom does not see Mm. 1 Ben stared a moment and then said: 44 Hi-yi I You're up a stump, ain't you ?" "■"No answer. > Tom surveyed his last touoh with the eyo of an artist; then he gave another gentle sweep, and surveyed the result as before. Ben ranged up alongside ofhim. Tom's mouth watered for the apple,: but he stuck to his work. Ben said : • . " Hello, old chap; you • got to work; hey . :• • 44 Why, is it you, Ben ?

And while Ben worked and sweated in the sun, the retired; artist, sat on a barrel in; the shade close.by, dangling-his'legs,; munched his apple,-and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but re mained to white- wash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kito in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with; and so on, and so on, hour after, hour. . And when the middle of the afternoon came, .from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morn ing, Tom was literally rolling in wealth.. He had, besides the things I have mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews* harp, a piece of blue bottle glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couplo of tadpoles, six firecrackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door knob, a dog collar—but no dog—tho handle of a knife, four pieces of orange peel' and a dilapi tated old. window sash.. -Ho had had a nice, good, idlo timo all, the.rwhile—plenty of com pany—and'tho fenco had three coats, of white-; ■waan.onit! If ho: hadn't run oat of white wash he would havo bankrupted every boy, in" the,village. •• ' ' -l ; . Tom said to himself that it was:not such-a hollow'world after hII. He had discovered a great law of human action without knowing it;; namely, that, in ordor to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the tiling difficult to attain. If - lie had been a great and wise philosopher, Iiko the writer of this book, he would now havo comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is obligod to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers, or perform ing a treadmill, is work, whilst rolling nine pins or climbing Mount Blano is only, amuse-! mcnt.
