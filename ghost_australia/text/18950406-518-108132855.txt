FOOTBALL. The first mateh of the season will take place at Berry on Easter Monday between tho Pirates (Sydney) and a oombined South Coast team. Mr. John M'Cafflery (Kiatna) has boon elected President, and Mr. C. Moss (Nowra) Secretary to the South Coast Eugby Football Union. The Cause op Laboto. — Sydney Daily Post has gone the way of all journalistic attempts to exist on the heave* offerings of Labor and Democracy of its peculiar kind. For twelve weeks the paper has run a very good staff, which, de. spite Innumerable disadvantages, kept the sheet well : before the public' as a news, paper. The first week's salary of- the literary staff was paid ; half of the socond Week's waB also forthcoming, then the limp and down-at- lieel ghost staggered on his halting parade and fell right down. Since 20th Jan. not one of me employes nas received a xsent by way of salary, and from the editor, to whom nearly £100 is owing, down to tho smallest boy in tlie office, all are creditors of tbo company. On Tuesday morning a demand was man for salary, and was not responded to. Then the boys struck. Labor omnia vincit. The Post, got about three month's work out of its employe's er about three weeks' wages.— An ordor has been made for the winding up of the company. Amongst those who had to do in some way with the venture was Mr. A. M. Woodhill, of Nowra, who also has an interest in a general printing establishment lu the city.
