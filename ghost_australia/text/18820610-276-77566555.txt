MONKEYS AND LIGHT. . It is a strange fact that in night-time an unknown sound will scare monkeys almost out of their wits. The creaking of a wheel barrow, a whisper, the rustling of a window curtain, is enough to throw them into a fit of horrified screams and contortions; capuchin monkeys rush wildly through their cage, mac aques try to force their prison-doors, the little marmosets huddle together like the princes in the Tower, all about a matter they would disdain to notice in daytime. The old males of the anthropoid apes are about as hard to scare as any living creature, but after dark the veriest trifle will inspire them with an almost supernatural fear; and it may be a mere fancy, but I cannot get rid of the notion that this night-horror of our hirsute relatives must be, the origin of the spectre dread of savage nations, and indirectly, per haps, of medieval demonism and modern spiritualism, -ghost-mongery," as ? the sceptical Germans call it. Monkeys are not very sharp-scented, and have to rely on their eyes, and in night-time, therefore, are almost at the mercy of their enemies, jaguars, pan thers, and leopards, whose owl-eyes enable them to hunt by moonlight, and in the virgin woods of the tropics the constant dread of mistaking the approach of a murderer for the rustling of the fitful night-wind would be enough to make a Berserker nervous. " It is not-books or pictures," says" Charles Lamb, " nor the stories of foolish servants, which create these terrors in children. They can at most give them a direction. The stories of theChimffiras and Gorgons may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition, but they wjere there before. They are transcrjpts, types: the arche-types are in us, and eternal. May it not be that those archetypes are the prowling ferae of the tropical forests? -Ex change.
