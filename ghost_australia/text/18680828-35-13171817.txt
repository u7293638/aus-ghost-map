M »in " said Lord Chesterfield in the days of his age, «"oor'oIdTjrawley and I are both of us dead, if we Jw knew it " It is astonishing that this fact of people being dead for years before they are buried is L more commonly perceived and acted on than it" is, a not people only, but books, newspapers, in mm 55\. and whatever else is capable of having life and VZUIR the appearance of it after the reality has come to an end TOT, look where we will, on every side you we incurable and incapables tapping and stumping hither and Outlier with all the pretensions and mrs of life (is if they were in the hey day of a career, while in truth they are only as spent cannon balls, toothless watchdogs, ghosts, or whatever emblem one may choose for what was once something an 1 is now nothing A book, for example an awesome an image ng air of vitality and currants for years after all the truth that was once on H has been absorbed into current opinion, transferred to new forms and expressions , or, owing to clause of circumstance, has ceased to be true at all Um notorious that a journal may keep most of its sanitation and "as to many of its readers long after any intellectual sop has ceased to flow in its columns, and after it has begun to give its readers, instead of fruiting, mere abundance of dry leaves and sticks and FO of human beings It is immensely difficult for man to know when he is dead to know, this is today which has lost the faculty of moving along with his life, and living in its foremost ideas" and aspirations, when he has no longer anything of hope for, nor much to care for, nothing to contribute to the common stock, nor much to receive from the efforts of others, nor any will to receive it Of course it may be said that, from this point of v over a great many persons are as good as still born to begin with And this is quite true there is some thing partly i written and partly comic in the number of men and women whom one meets in the world who have never been quickened into life by the stimulus of circumstance, and yet who move through their existence with all the manner of active creatures They eat and drink and to a certain extent have the gift of articulate speech, and they go i' th' catalogue fit him on creatures But what of all this simulation 1 life' They only move in a phantasmagoria Nothing comes of them, except a certain blocking up of the way for the living These persons, however, are to be borne with, in without sympathy, also without alive wroth Anger directed against blocks IB a vote of a good thing The case of those who have lived and live no more tetiemainontheface of the earth notwithstanding a different their obstructive power is of an active soft and with the reputation of their lives to back them their chances of doing mischief are most seriously ample Take a politician for example, who has been bred up in principles that have become sacred traditions with him, and which appear to him to con- nia all things that are needful to salvation The lessons which recommended them to him may have been good reasons, and for their time they may have acted circumstances to perfection But circumstances change and unless the man changes too, and lightships ground to match, then all the good which he i and to the credit of doing becomes in the public mind a ground for continuing to believe in him, and for past benefits grow into a root of present and future injury The Americans are often reproached with then short memories towards their statesmen They have a quaint proverb about the exceeding smallness of ex presidents "Vet would it not have saved would it not even now save, England many troubles if some ex premiers and ex politicians of 15 per degree were to fall into as small estate as that of men who have filled their political office in America > The good that men dependants dies with them, it were no bad thing if they should die when they have done what grow', They can Tor this is just one of those £'",0eS where our English fashion of reverence, good and gracious as it is in so many respects, does us real hum, and will continue to do so until some BBgicien hue conferred on statesmen, author?, end all others whom I' may concern the admirable quality of knowing exactly when they are dead There is not one leading men out of fifty with this me gift of knowing when the sap has ceased to flow, then his agility in moving with circumstances in pal ned, when the time has come for retirement into the cool and graceful region of reminiscence There are so many reasons why even a good man should be reluctant to acknowledge that he has a foot in the political or speculative grave His methods have answered in past times, why should they not answer now ?
