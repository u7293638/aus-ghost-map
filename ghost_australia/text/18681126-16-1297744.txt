Stage Courier PUBLISHED DAILY. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1868. In the LraisLATiTE Assfmrli yesterday, after the Sir iilER hnd i end prayers, The new Ministry being necessarily absent, Mr Douglas announced that Mr. Fitzgerald had attempted to form a Ministry and had failed, whereupon His Excellency had sent for the hon member for Fortitude Valley That gentleman had succeeded in forming a Cabinet, consisting of himself as Premier and Attorney-General Mr Macalister as Minister for Lands and Works, Mr Stephens as Colonial Secretary, and Mr Fitzgerald as Colonial Treasurer Mr Douglas then proceeded to move that the seat of the Premier be declared vacant, when Mr Paine objected on the ground that there was no positive information of Executive action before the House in the shape of a On elie After some discussion the motion was temporarily with drawn, and the Si baker left the chair until I o'clock On the assembling at that hour, Mr Douons produced the Gazette containing a notification of the retirement of the late Ministry, and the appointment of the incoming Cabinet, and then moved successively that the seats of Messrs Lilley, Macalister, Stephens, and Fitzgerald be declared vacant The motions were severally put and carried Mr Douglas then moved fhoodjournniciitof the House until the annual) 1935-6, in order to allow time for the re election of the members of the now Go\ ci nment -Mr Walsh imes ed, by way of amendment, that the date of adjourn- ment should be December 29, on the ground that if the House continued to sit beyond the end of the year the Government would have to expend money without Parliamentary sanction, -the amendment caused some discussion, in which a number of hon. members took part, and it was ultimately adopted The House then adjourned until December 29 succor dingy) Looking over the heads, so to speak, of both parties in the House, yesterday, there was in the proceedings a great deal to disapprove of and very little to advance When the House met, the arrangements of the new Ministry could hardly be considered much of a secret, but the bulk of those who occupied the strangers' gallery were taken by surprise when they learned that these arrangements actually were The selection of Mr Doll is as spokes- man for the new Government was a compliment due to him, from his position in the House, which we dare saythernenibeis of that Ministry felt much pleasure in pay ing him, and some anxiety lest he should decline it, but it was undoubtedly a great stretch of good nature, even for that very generous and well-meaning gentleman, to accept such an office It is matter of notoriety that in the existing arrangements the boil member for the kennedy is same lines as though not Prime Minister It is on record that in the very last speech delivered by the hon. member for East Moreton He declared that " he should seriously regret to see Mr Tit/geii held in office," that be (Mr Fitzgerald) was not a consistent politician, and his political conduct did not justify any very high expectations of his judiciousness, and after detailing various differences in opinion between himself and the hon. member for the Kennedy, and enumerating some of the ends which the legislation of the latter gentleman had brought on the colony, Ali Douglas concluded by saying, he felt bound to support the motion of want of confidence in the Government, come from where it might, but he would be as dissatisfied to see the hon. member for the Kennedy at the held of the Government as he was to see the present Ministry in office " This, we fancy, was about the poorest compliment which the hon. gentleman thought he could pay the mover of the amendment Any feeling of irritation under which he then suffered must, however, have disappeared entirely by the time the House met yesterday When a new Ministry takes office the member who announces the fact to the House does not by doing so necessarily commit himself beyond recall to their views , butcoitamly his announcement. is regarded as more than a formality of an act of passing friendship He may not be held accountable for the policy to be developed by the new Government but he is regarded as a sort of " best man at the union of the " high contract ing parties, and that union is supposed to have his cordial approval Mr Douglas may have seen reason to regret the very strong expressions of opinion indulged in by him on Thursday last probably the lavish encomiums of the Life Ministerial party had something to do with thisiepaiation to his party, but if he has changed his mind so suddenly, must it not be granted that he has fairly laid himself open to the compliments (?) paid him by Mr. Du, visit and that the less the honorable gentleman says for the future about "consistency' and "judiciousness" the less people will wonder what can possibly be the main ing which he puts on these terms Howes 01, to let that pass his averment that Mr. Lilley was to be Premier, and Mr lir/cntiiD Colonial Treasurer, while Mr. Stephens took the Colonial Secretary ship, was hardly be expected, that Mr. M vc vLiSTi it should take his old post in the Lands and Works was considered natural enough. This is not an opportune occasion for rWnoQi in the working powers of the present combination, me we an. inquiring differ from Mr P xlmlh in the opinion that it will dissolve like last years show Mr Little is not a man of commanding mind ence in the House or outside of it, but he has few enemies anywhere, and probably not one personal opponent in the present Pat I haven't If he will recognise the full weight of the responsibility and the house ( which is now his comport himself as be I seems such a position, and give himself here till to the performance of its duties, he may most successfully manage his party and lead the House He has tact and readiness, and without being arrogant overbearing can exhibit that decision of character without which any attempt at leadership must result in failure At present, w Uli many misgivings, the question is asked will be prove himself equal to the occasion He has been spoiled by too much petting, and perhaps the best service that can be rendered him just now is, to pronounce no opinion but to tell him condition that he will be watched even more closely than his colleagues, and none of them shall escape very deep scrutiny More confidence in the new arrangements would be felt with Mr. Stevens in the Tieasmj than can exist in the occupation of that post by Mr InvGLitu,Â» Beyond " tick ling" with some vigour former Colonial Treasurers mile taking an active put in Budget night debates, we no not aware that the hon. member for South Brisbane has ever displaced any remarkable finan- cial ability Certainly he has not had much opportunity to do so, for the church which looked most likely was suddenly snatched from him by the ousting of the last Michelsen.. Ministry, when Mr. Srrpurxs cleared out with his colleagues, leaving behind him the ' Estimates which he had hoped to lay before Parliament But,uiiquestioinbl}, he is believed to possess special capabilities for dealing with questions of finance, and would, as Treasurer, give a standing to the new Ministry which, at present at least, Mr Iii/gebald can not confer on it. It is possible that the hon. member for the Kennedy may turn out a first-class financier With all our hearts we hope he will, for of all things we should like to see such a Queensland una as to make its nest in our exchequer and begin to tire with the deposit of golden eggs at any rate we know the hon. gentleman is curious to peep into the strong box and see how the money goes Perhaps he will now be able to discover how the accounts between North and South may be satisfactorily adjusted It is a problem which he has long wished to solve, and no harm can come of his making the attempt The New Ministry have had but two steps to make since entering office, and in both of these they have stumbled rather aw kw hardly Neither the Constitution nor the Standing Orders of the House absolutely necessitate the production of a Gazette containing the resignations of the old and the appointment of the new Minister at the time that these facts are announced to the House, as they were as terday by Mr Douglas But it certainly is the custom to do so, and a useful and advantageous custom too, for at least it affords the Speaker and the House documentary evidence of the correctness of the statements made At the same time it was absurd and puerile for Mr Pjilxg to make the fuss about the matter that he did He knew perfectly well that the resignation of Mr Mackenzie included his resignation, he knew that it had been accepted, and that he was no more Attorney General when the House met yesterday than he was Chief Justice and he displayed much ill-temper and nothing more, while professing to bear fluenced by a desire to conserve the privileges of the House. The general, and possibly the correct, impression was that he, knowing that the only man who in a professional sense could deal with the subject, was out of the House, thought he would have a final ramble round the Parliamentary ring, as the great constitutional lawyer of the colony As for the other question-the motion for adjourning-thenewMmish} blundered miserably The adjournment to the 19th of January was not for too long a period, and all the eloquence expended about the Constitution and the dearly bought privileges of Englishmen, and such other commonplaces were simply bunkum and stump orators imported into an assemblage in which they were quite out of place Not for one moment either does anybody believe in Mr Bill's ponderous qualms of conscience and Mr Fit vncis' pretended virtue All that needs to be said of their objections is that it was only too apparent why they were raised The error was made in offering to the House in such bald style a substantive motion the new Government should have declined its willingness to meet Parliament before the end of the year w Uli such force as it could muster, but should have pointed out at the same time how inconvenient such a meeting of necessity must be It should then have claimed the courteous consideration always shown to a new Gov- eminent and asked for a postpone- intent long enough to enable it to meet the House in full form, and, without any more delay, to go to business It was a fitting matter, trade present uicmnstances, on which to consult the House, as of gene lal convenience, and no doubt the decision would have been in favor of even a longer postponement than that which was asked It is to be hoped that the proceedings of yesterday will show these gentlemen, who have had the boldness to venture on the government of the colony, that theirs is to be no bed of roses Some of the members of the late Ministry are evidently in a humour not to be trifled with, and perhaps it is just as well that their successors have so easily been made aware that they will have to keep vigilant guard on the position they have won If they are not the enough and strong enough to do this, then bourne of office is worth but little MINISTERIAL ORANGES YESTrnrjir afternoon a Government Ga- ella was issued announcing that the Honorable R R Mackenzie the Honorable Ratcliffe Pring, the Honorable Thomas Lodge Murray Prior, the Honorable Arthur Hunter Palmer, and the Honorable Arthur Hodgson had resigned their seats iib Members of the Executive Council of Queensland in the same Gazette the appointment was announced of the Honorable Charles Lilley to be Vice President and member of the Executive Conn), and Athol Roy General of Queensland, the Honorable As third Macalister, to Secretary for Pubholands and Secretary for Public Woi Is the Honorable Thomas Blacket Stephens to be Colonial Secretary the Honorable 'Thomas Henry Fitzgerald, to be Colonial Treasurer and those gentlemen to be members of the Tvccu tive Council of Queensland We are requested to state that Mr. Arthur Hodgson's party, for this evening, is unavoidably postponed The Criminal Sittings of the Supreme Court concluded on Wednesday. Joseph Downes was found guilty of obtaining Â£1 by means of false pretences from Thomas Henry Bowman Barron, and sentenced to one month's imprisonment with hard labor Michaelmas term sittings in Banco will commence this morning, at 10 o'clock, at the Supreme Court, before their Honors the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Lutwyche. It is very satisfactory to be able to state that Mr. Manning is progressing favorably, and that the medical men attending him confidently expect his ultimate recovery The wounds have not touched the brain, though the skull was out through in the places, and the bone prized up Mr Manning will not be removed from the office for some days A large number of per sons were making inquiries about his health yesterday, and it is evident that the incident, as might have been anticipated, has painfully interested, to a great extent, all cIusbqb. The name of Dr Emmelhainz was accidentally omitted" yesterday from the list of medical men who ve 000 present shortly after the assault Bowerman will be brought before the Police Magistrate again to day, but we understand that the evidence will be taken, and that he will be further remanded It is probable that this formal proceeding will take place within the gaol We omitted to mention yesterday in our report of what occurred that Mr. Walker, messenger at the Colonial Secretary's Office, was one of the first to run to Mr Manning's assistance after the assault was committed by Bowerman, and helped to secure the prisoner At 11 o'clock last night we were informed by Dr Hobbs that his patient was still progressing favorably, and that so far no dangerous symptoms had appeared A aioovlioht parade of both the Brisbane Volunteer Rifle Companies took place yesterday evening There were about forty members of each corps present. The whole were under the command of Lieutenant Macgregor The men, headed by the Volunteer Band, marched through the Valley and were put through various exercises in manual, platoon, and marching by the adjutant A great many spectators were present Mrs OnAniES Osbobm, late landlady of Os home's Hotel, Fortitude Valley, died very suddenly yesterday evening in the afternoon she complained of feeling unwell, and about 4 o'clock went to her room and lay down About 5 o'clock she was visited by some of the inmates, when she said she was no better About 7 o'clock she was found dead on her bed An inquiry into the cause of of her death will take place to day A comiESPOhDEM, in answer to a letter which appeared in our columns yesterday, signed "A Hater of Cara, writes to say that a mistake was made by the latter writer in stating that the dog tax in the old country is 12s per annum Hosnjsitis 5s per annum for each dog kept, and thinks a similar tax imposed upon all dogs kept within municipalities in this colony would not only sold a considerable amount of revenue, but would be a desirable step to take in order to abate the cm nuisance We understand that the Turkish Baths Albert street me now in a state of efficiency, and will be open to the general public on and after Monday next To the eastward of the Nichol Bay settlement Western Australia, a large tract of country has been discovered producing a plant which, on examination, proved to be a beautiful sample of cotton So abundant is the plant that it is estimated a dozen bales of fibre might be easily collected by two men in a, week's time The following extract from a private letter received from Taroom has been placed at our disposal the authority is undoubted - Matters up here, in this district, are very bad far worse than LEGG and far worse than when I wrote last week Sheep are dying everywhere at a frightful rate At Juandah I hear they are all turned out, and they have not got noises to ride on the station, at Cockatoo, they mo sitting Â£1,000 sheep on the roads a thing they never had to do before Mr Millar is travelling with all his sheep himself, somewhere about CluToul and Bondi, and I horn they also dying in great numbers, where all the stations are doing so bad), it is difficult to say which is the guest Added to all our other troubles, we have to look famine in the face There is no flour and sugar, and other supplies are running short- flour is the chief article, on none of the stations is there any of more than a few weeks' supply Some of the stations are almost completely out Those that have and will neither loud nor sell, and so cial people have been in here to try and buy, but there is none Zeibo has only half a beg to keep his establishment, Ashton has none to sell, and Heilborn has, I think, disposed of all his at Â£6 and it per bag Indifferent sugar is selling at 2s per lb There are no drays we can hear of, as being on the road Came is will not start. The most we have to eat is like canon The butchers sheep, that were for once upon a time, are now giving up the ghost from starvation Oh' this is a delightful place to live in and no mistake The short time I have been here is quite sufficient to make anyone abhor the place The towns you may imagine is very dull, no one coming in from the stations if they possibly help it Melmom Ham. writes as follows concerning the Clarence River natives -" Nothing on this river startled me more than the aboriginals Ovungto some girl having been kidnapped a fight was to take place between two of the tribes the fiery cross had sped and the gathering was unusually) large They were, without exception, the most hideous and repulsive along trials I have come across and it is a very hard nut to crack to believe that any amount of degradation can have so lowered Adamite man Both sexes and all ages were clad in nature's livery , not even on the figurative fig leaf indicated a consciousness of incurring the penalty of exposure They stalked about in all the naked dignity of innocence, or shamelessness, in the noonday! sun I was assured that they could not be induced to wear clothes, many a pair of trousers had been given to the men, and many a petticoat to the woman but after wearing them for a day or two the garments changed hands make the circuit of the tribes, and finally Mobo their play in the bush' And, to evince how entirely custom dulls the nice edge of per ception modest young girls stood in my presence talking to these savages, whose only cos tune, beside their unwashed black skins was a tomahawk, manifestly unconscious of there being anything calculated to call up a crimson d) o to their fair cheeks the only one n he was ashamed was I, and I soon found reason to be more ashamed as I soon found disgust usurping the place of over better emotion Mrs Garven told me that the remnant of the tube with which she is best acquainted system atically destroy their infants On my inquiring if she knew of any case, she narrated that she had herself on one occasion, not very long ago, discovered a newly born infant lying on the bare ground, near a freshly deserted on campment Knowing that one of the lubras who had occasionally done some washing for her had recently had a child, she sent for her, she did not attempt to deny that it was hers and took it away A few days afterwards Mrs Garron met her and inquired about her baby, ' back budgeree picaninny was the reply, ' gone do id ' Mrs Garran has no doubt it was murdered '
