The Ulster Orangemen. Says the Sjiriiuj/irhl Jtrjnif/licau :—“ While the enemies of Ireland are taking ostentations precautions against Fenian violence, which there is not the "host of a reason for expecting, the precious Protestants of Ulster, whom they are so anxious to protect against the dreadful Nation lists, are showing themselves in their true char acter asabominahle brawlers. The record of the Orangemen is always and everywhere the same; they are orangized for (he sole and only purpose of perpetuating hatred and creating riot; and the proceedings in Belfast are their natural action. What possible pretext they have for it does not appear, but. they have the city of Belfast in their hands, and are strong enough to drive the police into quarters. If Salisbury wants to apply his coercion and emigration remedies, he might be given a special mission for the purpose in that Protestant corner. It would be a good tbirtg for Ireland if t he Orangemen could be deported, but it, ought, to tie to some lone isle of the sea— there is no country on earth that wants them.”
