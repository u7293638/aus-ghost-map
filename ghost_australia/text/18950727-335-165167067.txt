SPRING-HEELED JACK. A Myth Great consternation has prevailed in the town as the shades of night have fallen owing to reports that the celebrated Spring-heeled Jack had appeared to several young women, and had frightened them to within an inch of their lives. This feeling was intensified when a further report was set going to the effect that a prominent footballer had received such a shock to his nervous system as to have rendered him incapable of appear- ing agaiust Richmond to day. Î’riefly, the reports were, that on Sunday evening week, when Miss Tait, of Graham-street, was proceeding along Graham - street, between Evans and Clarke-streets, a man appeared to her dressed in a big-jblack coat When but a few inches from her he threw the coat back and disclosed the representation of a coffin, illuminated with phosphorus, at tbe same time uttering in sepulchral tones ' Prepare for your doom,' and before the young lady could recover from her fright he had given a tremendous spring and was lost to sight. The same apparation was also reported to have appeared to Miss Lock of Ross street, and Miss Potter of Graham -street, and also to a married lady on the west side. These rumours, have, however, no foundation in fact, as all the ladies referred to deny having seen the famous Jack. I With regard to the gentleman men- tioned we understand that he did come in contact with some spirits, previous to the time that he is reported to have seen the apparition, but he caunot say definitely whether his visitant was the ghost of Joshua or Old Tom, hut he is certain that he never swallowed his pipe through the fright.
