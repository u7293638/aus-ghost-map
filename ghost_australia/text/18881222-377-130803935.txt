With sech a great and varied panorama as the daily life of America, whrre, at evcry turn, an heiress elopes with her father's coloured groom, a highwaymnn abt.'cl t . beauety, a murderer is lynched, a el rcr rolb:rry is executed, or a Western editor shoots .ome unfortunate "pete," tire journal. isns have little diclieulty in turning cat a paper after the Yankee's eoweanal. But, apart from these u? common adevantages, the "cut" of the piper is cer tainly incompnrvbly superior to that of the average English journal. The Americoas chisel down to their exact news tire Govcrment denpatoches, senators' spccli:e, and such-like corirmon deliveiies. A report of tire most ihpertant oration rarely ex. eecdo a celuonn. A trig debate in Ceaugree gets no more. American reporting does not consist merely in taking ehort-handnotes. The proceedings must be graphically and narrativcly described. Every eouluno. ic fact, is descriptive, and, iu nanycasos, elqrruret aned patiretic.

They are not bound by the red tape which ties the English. man to iaosagrown forms and traditions. If a murder is committed in New York, for instance, the reporters, without waiting for the Ceort.room die. closures, erust truer the action of the principal char acters till they get to the original cause, and then, from that point, their movemrrents must he decoribed till the teal vcrse has bec acted and the curtai dropped. The story, when putlishcd, is like a chapter froer a French norel. Romantic suicides are made a speciality. A portrait of the " uteor tunsse," and those specially interested in the case, rclieven the narrative, and the iuformation is ob. taimed y nny meaes. When a person is lynched, " in the for West," tie victirs's career, and a eens-. tional account of the "errermosy," is telegraphed all over the States, Mosh of the principal papers are illustrated with line-drawinge, but with a cleverness ol'd naturalness entirely their own. In the "inter. via'ring" line they "lick creation." No oe can cor.e near them. The momenct n English M.P, at any note, a historian, a novelist, a journalist, a show. man, or a player, or any other torcigner puts hir foot on American soil, he is mobbed by the re porters. "If you don't grant an iuterview," says Max O'Rell, "y ou'll probably find one manufactured for you." Their dramatic criticises are snequalled in their way. Whilenot possessing the seriousness and grand English of aczlett, by their humoroue strokes they please us, and by their gossip and general brightness they amuse and interest us. Newspaper warfare rages in America with ex travagant fiercenese. The Nzew flrub'tar, for in stance, recently alluded to the editor of the World as the "Danubean bluod- hound," and the latter, in reply,described his friend on the Star as "a mends. cilo mortgaged blacAguard." A leader in the Louisuillc Comnterdl opens thus mildly i-" The Coommerciar repeats its invitation to Deacon Walter N. Eandeman, proprietor of the C?ruier-Jouresol. He has made a claim, in regard to the cireulation of his paper, which is as famse as a dicer's oath." Cincin anti, "Tbe Paris of America" which has two of the finest papers in America, has long bees a rival field, and at one time the editors were on the point of fighting a duel. Thn city, however, hes now a Press Club, and the orbit of peace sheds its bright calm light on the busp propeiloe' of the quill. Rivalry, niodobt. is a great spur to effort; end the journal ist who wraps himself in the lethargic blanket will die the death of the juet. With the Yankees "'He liveth long wholiveth well ; All else is life but flung asay. He livoth longest who can tell Of soild deeds truly done eaoh day." As American paper must have a "living vertebrae to hold it together." America has seen more journals die like Mark Twain's Occidefteede "as peacefolly Man infant" than any country in the world. But the Tankees have a peculiar genius for starting journals on absent erpitan, and many newspapers that have come on to" this mortal coil" to "champion the eause of the people" lose their heavenly mission in teas than a month, and, bowing their heads to the inevitable, " Fold up their teuts, like Arabs, And as silently steat away." The "sinews of war" are almost as necessary for she pen asforthe sword. Thoy both requireintrepidiry. TThenuumbrr of newnpapere in Arrsrica hae, we'hin recent years, increased at an unparalleled rate, and the United Statesnalone now supports more journalists than sna other country in the world. Newspapers arc printed there in almost every modern tongue, in every hamlet, end for every sect. Besides this, the largvr journals are published simultancously in in differont states. The _Nero York: erald has its European edition. In the principal cities, Sunday cditions are issued, the aenountof literary, social, and .e,-rel news of wihichl, together with their flee ,-.1p" ani cheapucess, have made them " one of ate wonders of the world." No Asoerican paper is anything without a novel. You might as euccesfully try to make a kite fly without a tail oe to attempt to publisi in America naoel, maralieing eocular journal,laden with "sweet cess and light," bat steering clear of noveldom. Their ahort, humorous stories are decidedly American, good, and icimitable. Americun humour is unlike the hcmour of sa othrer coautry. The satiric Iteench, the keen Eaglish, the broad, rich Irish, and the quaint Scotch, all unite in making the Ameriean. It is superior to none, hut has a peco Liarity and fascination all it' own. Mark Twain. Bret Hurtc, Bill Nye, M. Quod, and one or two others trove rcolutionised the American press in this direction, The papers, all rouud,revel in eatire and wit. "At one tine," writes a reporter in a New York magazine, "I furnished the Chicago Daiuf/ Jferfld a report of a thanksgiving dioceuare by Mlder Y-, of tire Methodist Church.

The objectionable eomosent was as follows : 'roro allof awhic it world appear that the Rev. Y-- is a fool or en ass--perrhaps both' and thic was an addendum by the editor." A Nebraska editor, in apolegising for the latenses of his paper. s y.,:c " Our paper is two days lat, Iris week, owing to an accident to oar press. When we strted to run the edition, Wedoeiday night, as usual, one of the guy-ropes gave woy, allowing the forward gilderfloke to fall and breba as it straik the tiunkerflapper.

This loosened tsle flakieg between the remrod and the flittor-enatcher, which also caused trouble. The report that the delay was caused by ovrer-idulgosco in intoiclating etomulsnte by our. selves is a tissue of falstetoods, the peeled condition of our right eye being caused by our going ioto tire hatch-way of the press, in our anxiety to start it, and pollihg the coupling.prs after the slap.basg was brokhe, which caused tire disgus to rise up and welt us in the optic. We expect a brand-new gilder ftuks on this afternoea's train." Accidents like this, of course, are of common occurrence in oewr. paper aficen. Sorrow very rarely throas its shade e1ios their merriment, and they never go fortai in tioinrsing. If they are "loved by the gods," and d'. p'o0ng, they die joking, like Hood and Travcers. U'cbhlais has said that "It is better to go through t?h wsorld with laughter on our lips than with t?ars io our eyes." There is, no douht, a great deal of philo sophy in the dictomc; and I am convinced that, the more enlightened moet people get, the more they desire to be toecd ioat deep or general knowledge, an icnetogne woo amored into Greek and Latin. The American josrcualiate seldom throw their moral convictioes on "e suaffrieg humno ity." Their readers look for "the Ilow of e'it and fLuac." The editorials are therefore brief, hmoroues, and comparatively iscffletive.

Amen. The "Vagabond" remembers, with pleasure, his experience at Montreal, where the manager of a nowspopcr offered him the companionship of one of his lady'reporteru at the races. Au a matter of fast, we are told very little of the freedom of Amerisan women. They are not only employed as dotectives, as nhorthaad.'witsrs in the High Court of lostioe, end in other responsible departoieots; but no paper of any importanco is without them. They make esceedingly clever reporters and smart editors. Although American ladies are the cleverest in the world, posseseing, as they do, "s kind of spiritual. isod politeness, a tender solicitude for other people, combised with strong individuality," I certainly think that, in this direction, the Yankees expose our faults. Wno uan afford to hind the mothers of the future to the drudgery of school-toaching and dres-miahing, while we prevent accomplished wonmec from taking light and more profitable engagements. The old idea, put inv' the mouth of Deborah Woodhouse, is "John W.ird, Preacher," that" It's very unfeminine to think," must pass away with the Oriental notions of the proper sphere of women. The cleverest reporter on the Now York World was, recently, a young American woman, who succeeded in deceivisg competent doctors, gaining admittance into a lunatic asylum, nod exposing the dangerous systeis of the institution. Lookiog over the American journalist field, I think that, although the newspapers are not so powerfulas the English, their versatility more than coipesnsitc for this defect. The Americans are wide awake ;so are the newspapers. If they are at times abusive, they are also complimentary and genial, as, when Mr. Wattoreoo, of the Louisvil[e Couricr.Journal, invites the editor of the New York Son to visit him: "Come," he says, "and see us, and bring your kuittin', and stay 'most all day." If Americans keep their eyes open, that's no reasou why English tourists should abuse their smartness. "The silent watches of the night, about which the poet siugs,' observes a Westera pressman, " most have been the sleeping London policemen."
