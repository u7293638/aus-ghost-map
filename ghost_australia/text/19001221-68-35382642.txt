A SPIRIT SEANCE. Readers are reminded once again that the benefit performance in aid of the citizens' memorial fund will take place at the Albert Hall this evening under the patronage of the Mayor and Mayoress, Lieut.-Colonel Martin, Major Harrap, and the officers of the battery. A number of leading townspeople have also, it is said, signified their intention of being present. Professor Davis has undertaken to present a modern spirit seance, showing how latter-day ghosts are produced. The professor does not claim mediumistic powers, but wishes to to be understood that his "spirits" are particularly solid, though they are made to assume the unearthly appear ance of visitors from another sphere. This, in addition to other novel items on toe programme; should have the de sired result of attracting a large audi ence.
