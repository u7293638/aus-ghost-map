The good Madame DAicay places, her hand on the head of the kneeling Etas shesays, "Come back after the completion of your sentence and we will "rove to you that those who most love Ctice most love mercy." Armand excites, " put the shame is life-long. ^ The Abbe answers, " The glory is eternal, and the cur n falls The excellent impersonations ot Abbe by Mr. Tithcradfie, the oonviet by £ CX AT».a D'Arcw to Hr. Ward, Madame D'Aruay by Miss Bonier, and the Countess de TremeiUan by Miss Watt Tanner, all of whom have made a careful study of these strongly-drawn and well contrasted characters, have previously been referred to. Miss Gibson mayaJsobe com plimented on the pretty and appropriate way in which Bhe sustains the part of the cbsim inc ingenue over whose bright hfe the clouds cather so hopelessly in the last act Miss Major hits off cleverly the peculmnkes of the tyrannical but good-natured house keeper to the Abbe, while Miss Temple's leanne Torquenie is played with a strength which enables the character to take its. proper place in the picture. "Hamlet" was played at the Princess's Theatre on Saturday and Monday nights. Mr Walter Bentley sustained the part of the melancholy Prince at the Theatre Royal some months ago, when his impersonation was received with a large amount of favour. It is based on the modem method of depict ing the character which was inteoduoed by! Fechter and refined upon by Irving. This is so far removed from the old robustious style j of the Kemhles and Macready, that when a friend took Macready, after his retirement, to 1 see Fechter's Hamlet, the only remark he could extract from the veteran at the end of the performance was-"The music was very j good." Mr. Bentley presents an earnest, im pressive, and generally effective delineation J of the character, but the aspect which he places most in evidence is Hamlet's desire to j fool his intimates by assumed madness as the readiest meana of reaching a just revenge, j Less prominence is given to the circumstance I that Hamlet is a man dominated by an over- j mastering sorrow for the loss of his father, I and to his habit of vacillating from sensi- j liility and procrastinating from thought, j philosophical speculation taking the place of j action. Mr. Bentley's Hamlet produces the I impression of being rather a brisk and push- J ins personage. The weaker Bide of the de- j lineation is the inadequate expression I of the subtilities and insubstantail 1 elements of which the part is so largely I composed, being an expression of the 1 passions with the interest depending j more on the thoughts than on the action. I In one or two scenes Mr. Bentley'a by-play 1 differs from the familiar methods. No objec-1 lion can be offered to the substitution in the I play-scene of a manuscript.of "The Murder J of Gonzago" for a fan, Hamlet excitedly 1 turning the leaves and reading the words qf ] the speech lie has set down as they are deli-1 t ered by the actors, and then eagerly raising j his eyes to the face of the King, It is not an J improvement to deliver the soliloquy, "To 1 be or not to be," as ihough the words re-j ferred to the forthcoming performance of the J little play before the oonrt; nor is the fcban-1 donment of the miniature [portmtsof the 1 King and his brother in the closet some with j fie Queen mother-Hamlets teferenoes being I to two pictures drawn in words-apolnt] deserving 0f commendation. Miss Marie j Eraser appeared as Ophelia, and was called | before the curtain at the end of the mad] ^cene- Though possessed of grace and ten-l derness, her voice is deficient in flexibility. I r* Corleas's Ghost, on Saturday night, not ! only laboured under the disadvantage of not 1 knowing the words, but showed a dispose j on to wobble in his principal scene, which J was not only unsuggestive of the majesty of J uried Denmark, but must have beendisoon-1 ®»«ng to the representative of the Prwoe.

It has a slender thread of «tory which admits of the introduction of numerous songs and dances for three of the principals, aided by a chorus of children. The farcical comedy is carefully placed on the stage, and the performance is bright and lively, without in auy sense transcending the traditions of this house. Miss Agatha Greenwood makes a youthftfl and attractive little Tina. Miss Marlbel Greenwood, whose principal songs are from Italian opera, has a fresh soprano voice which she usee with faoile execution. She also presents her part, that of Miss Fleeter, an adventuress, with considerable dramatic strength. Mr. W. G. Carey is very effective as Joe Shotwell, a broken-down old sport, whose grim humour is largely composed of metaphors drawn from the card table. Tony is played by Mr. J. F. Williams, Dudley Har court by Sir. Kemp, Dr. Oliver by Mr. Roy Grenfell, the negro boy by Master Bob Green wood, and Mrs. Hatzell by Miss Uagleson. On Tuesday night, Miss Nellie Greenlees filled the place of Miss Agatha Greenwood in consequence of the illness of the latter. Mr. Dan Tracey's variety troupe at the Gaiety Theatre has been strengthened by the addition of Messrs. G. K. Fortesoue, Chas. Fanning, M'Kisson, and Reams, with Miss Viola Fortescue, Violet Kinsley, and the Sherwood sisters. A long and interesting programme is presented. The Cogill and Rickards combination at St. George's Hall continues to draw full houses. New songs and dances have been introduced, and they are all well received. Fitzgerald Bros.' Circus has been perform ing during the week at Malvern, Catilfield, Cheltenham, Box Hill, Auburn, and Glen ferrie. Mr. G. W. Collier, the actor, died on the 19th inst. Arrangements «re being made to give a performance in one of the Melbourne theatres for the benefit of his widow.
