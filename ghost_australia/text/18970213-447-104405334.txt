Notes and Comments. THE PEOPLE LIBELLED. The libellous attacks made on the Australian people by the 'Herald,' 'Telegraph' and 'Bulletin' in connec tion with the Cardinal's candidature for the Convention had no other effect than in demonstrating more clearly than ever the bigotry and hollowness of these organs of enlightened public opinion. His nomination, they shriek ed, will rouse sectarian strife, will set the entire community in dire confusion, will stir up a hornets' nest, will pos sibly lead to the most appalling public and private calamities, &c.; What was all this, but to directly impeach the people of the colony of being igno rant fools, stupid, unreasonable, and unworthy of civil liberty? Happily his Eminence the Cardinal has a higher idea of the good sense and of the pat riotism of his fellow-citizens. He does not bolieve that the great majority of them could sink to the low level of rank intolerance and petty, imbecile tyranny, in the dense marshes of which our contemporaries are floundering, and dailv contracting every kind of po litical disease. He has no hesitation in allowing himself to be judged by the suffrages of a free people, and events have splendidly indicated his policy. His nomination has brought about none of the predicted evils. The people even still quietly proceed about their accustomed duties. Peace to the 'Her- ald' and the other two bigoted papers, the democracy of Australia is showing that it is worthy of a man of the Car dinal's powerful personality and im mense learning and ability. They are no longer prepared to allow themselves to be frightened by that ridiculous phantom of bigotry, the 'Kiama Ghost.' They will persecute no man be cause of his religion. At the head of the poll they will place his Eminence.
