Ro®ley mile. Garterley Bell, ftnoueht, Telescope, Ciaremont, and E rlrillar have all found support at 12 to ! 0418 j have all, at one time or other, ran 1 if rkremont being the only one without AS to his name. The two first •S belong to Lord Falmouth, the ■5?TwoIre under Captain Machell's tw0 are nnaer laipbaui auuucua care. Srley Bell improved as he went on, •nine his two last races—the Criterion ST when his stable companion, Lady «u second to him, in front of Balfe an< irtsn others, and a post match, wherein he w Duke of Rutland, having previously ^ ftkd to Camballo and Craiig Millar for S? jtjy stakes, second to Mirliflor for the PHnce of Wales Stakes at Goodwood, second ♦/. Reealade for a Triennial Produce Stakes st Newmarket, second to Chaplet for the Pmndereast Stakes, and was only unplaced S-riz., in the Middle-park Plate. These «« pretty good credentials, and he probably fffflcany the first colours of Lord Falmouth on the day, although I hear that Dreadnought to to most improved-looking horee in train L laying grown and thickened all through iderably, his only bad point being his | ilj (rhieh is most decidedly plain. He sill'however, if I mistake not, -figure to mjtersd vantage over the Surrey hills than on | Ifffmark et'e famous heath. He wonthreeout 1 «feight attempts, and on the occasion of each victory odds varying from 2 to 5 to 1 were bid on him. He also ran second to Balfe in to Chesterfield, and a dead beat with CaJrine for second place to Telescope for the Levant Stakes at Goodwood. Ciaremont was to sensational yearling of the first sale at Cobliam, when he was put up at one thou sand, and Captain Machell simply adding "two," he was knocked down to the captain's plucky bid. He is by. Blair Athoi out of Caunbra, and has not yet repaid any of his purchase-money, having run second to Cam. ballo at Stockbridge and third to Balfe and Dreadnought at Newmarket but he was not qiute himself all last year, and I for one My expect to see a very different horse when he makes his bow this season. Telescope, in the same interest, com menced his public career at Chester, when he beat Fakenham Ghost by a head for the Mostyn Stakes; his next appearance was at Newmarket, where he won the Two-year old Plate at the second spring meeting; Strathavon, Macadam, Cachmere, &c.;, being behind him; he then, as abovementioned. won the Levant Stakes at Goodwood, and suffered his first defeat most unaccountably two days afterwards, when he ran third and a long last to Craig Millar and Fille du Ciel; his next performance I always have thought was his best, when he tried to give 51b. to Holy Friar at Stockton, and was only beaten by a head; and he made his bow in the IhddJe- park Plate. Craig Millar has won half his engagements, and bis last was his best, when he won the Home-bred Foal Stakes at Newmarket, beating Moriturus, lorkshire Bnde, Julian, and Velveteen. These, then, are the performances of the most-fancied favourites for the Two Thou sand.
