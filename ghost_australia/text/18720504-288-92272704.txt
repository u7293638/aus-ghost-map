Of the laity three voted for the amendment, and 25 against it. The amendment beingnthus lost, the original motion was carried. .' The Bishop's suggested topics of prayer were considered seriatim in detail, and accepted. CONFERENCE. The Bishop now proceeded to call attention to ' the Conference in Sydney, subjects to he considered,.. Court of Appeal, and the status ef colonlially-ordained clergy as to the Established Church of England.' With refe rence to this, His Lordship proposed, and Canon Farr seconded— 'That this Synod do accept the 'invitation of the Metropolitan to send represen tatives of the laity* and clergy to take part in the Conference to be heldin Sydney in September, with reference to forming a Provincial Synod of the several Australian Dioceses.' His Lord ship reminded Synod how in 1871 Archdeacon Marryat and Canon. Farr were selected to repre sent the clergy, arid Messrs. Thrupp and Colley th» laity. Among the subjects for the Con ference would be :^-L That the Clergy phould have a Consensual Court ,of Appeal to a higher tribunal ;|2. The constitution of our own Metro politan Court ; and; 3. To preserve union with England and Ireland, what should be the re lation of the Metropolitan to the Primate of Canterbury so as to keep up organic unity. He desired to send an answer if they accepted the proposal to have a general Synod or Conference. The motion, which was seconded by Canon Fake, was' pat, and carried. '' ' ' ' . MAEEIAGE, In the absence of the Hon. A. Blyth, Mr. Scott asked, 'Whether any instructions have been issued to the' clergy in reference to the marriage of a man with the sister or the daughter of the sister of his deceased wife'; and if so, will His .Lordship Jay such instructions before7 Synod.' The BI3H0P replied that this year he';had not issued any instruction. A year ago he stated his opinion thai, the lex loci did ?not supersede the obligations of ordination ; that no clergyman 'could be compelled to per form such a marriage ; and, infofo ConscienticB, he did not think they ought to do it. , ? ? tJNION Wffl STNOD. In accordance with notice, the Bev. A. HoNNEE called, attention to^ the 'report' of 'the Election Committee with regard to St. Martin's Chxtrch, Campbelltown, and expressed nis dis satisfaction, that this church had not been admitted to union with Synod. Mr. Thbupp, ithe ^Secretary, andbthers explained that there Had been no ? neglect. The \ Committee had found it impossible, in accordance with the rules of Synod,' to' admit this church in the rire sentr state of its trust deed, which they had not left themselves time to modify. ' They regretted much that for this session they had lost the presence of Mr. Downer. MELANESIA. Mr. g. W. Hawkes, according to notice, moved— 'That this Synod, sympathising with the conductors of the Melanesian Mission in the heavy trials through which they have recently passed, earnestly. recommend' the members of Church in this Diocese to give their best aid to the efforts being made to provide a new mission ship.' He felt that no appeal was needed. Their sympathies had lodg been given to this mission, and were now. especially required in the -almost irreparable uldss sustained in the death of the late Bishop Patteson. Special efforts were being made -at home.; £3,000 bad already beenraised for- a ichurch on Norfolk Island and the purchase of a new ship.- He hoped the Church would liberally assist these noble mission works; ? With 'respect to the notice 'That a letter- of condolence be addressed to thereprBsentatives-oftiie. Melanesian Mission,' panon FabE explained that he wished to make' an addition and cbrrection to tha letter already iwxitten bnt not yet sent. Mr. Atktn's name' hadbeen wrongly spelt, and that of the native: Oatechist omitted. .. His' LoEDSffTP spoke of jBishog Eatteson's great success at the very time' he .was cut off, he hiving within four months ? admitted ' ? about 303 converts to baptism, which fact spoke of a great work. Mr. Codririgtonhad been spoken of as likely to succeed .Bishop. Patteson. The motions com bined were carried unanimously, ; ': .' '.: ? ?: LkT BEADEBS.: ^IPhe Rev. W. Scott proposed, the Rev. H. J. Poole seconded— '3?hat in the opinion of Synod, lay readers should -be restricted in the performance of their duties to the districts for which.th'ey;are licensed ; or, in the case of their being under a clergyman licensed to two or more districts,. then the lay reader shall be re stricted 'to such two or more districts.' The Bishop explained that as -an act of courtesy and discipline, when the Services of a rlay reader were required in any place other than that tor ? which he held a licence; the circumstance should be mentioned to the Bishop, as the licence was hot intended to: be a' roving commission. The' proposition. was nofcformally put. . .i ':??-.-. ?- . Synod then adjourned till 3 p.m. next day.
