Concert at Riverstone. THE concert in aid of the Riverstone L & D. So ciety was held in the Temperance Hall on Satur day evening last. There was a fairly good audience present, considering the state of the weather. Mr J H Cragg occupied the chair. The opening over ture was an instrumental duet by Miss Stubbs and Mr Wilkins. Next was a song, " Queen of the Earth," by Mr Wilkins, who is heir to the stage here, and proved himself worthy of a place on future programmes. Mr Eirkby next appeared in a comic, entitled (l It never troubles me," for which be was encored, and replied with '< My mother-in law." Mr H Saundercock gave a recitation, "Ratber warm." Song, " Won't you be my sweet heart," by Miss A Westall, was enoored, and a repetition of the last verBe was given, Messrs Kirkby and Westall favored the audience with that old duet; .. Larbord Watch," and their efforts were received as if it was a thing of but yesterday. " The knowing little bey" was recited by Mr H Saundercock with, the usual effect. Mr C Westall sang " Love's Vesper hour" sweetly. " The little Alabama Coon" was then rendered by Miss A Westall, for which be was loudly applauded. Mr Eirkby then gave the comic song, " Last night," and an encore gave " Their heads nestled closer to gether." In the opinion of most of those present the latter is Mr Eirkby's masterpiece. After an in terval of five minutes the laughable farce, " The Ghost in the Pawnshop," was played by Mr Wilkins and the Messrs Stubbs in a manner that gave great satisfaction to the audience, and many expressed a wish that the piece "will be produced on some future occasion to a fuller house. Great credit is due to all those who took part in this eon cert, seeing that none of the local talent had got over the Record Reign celebrations.
