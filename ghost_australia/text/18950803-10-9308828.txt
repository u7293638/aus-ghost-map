I THE GOSPEL IN THE PASSOVER, A Sermon delivered in the Exhibition building, Hobart, by Rev. John McNeill " Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the Passover And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel, and the two side, posts with the blood that is in the base and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning ' -Exodus 11,2, 22 This subject is translated for us into New Testament thought and feeling by the Apostle when he says, ' Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us, and wish you to turn to the Old testament narrative to hand there illustrated a few points of the old theology, the ever fresh and ever now old theology for sinful men. It is evident that on this night there was hanging over those Israelites, and over that whole nation of Egypt, an awful doom and my first point would be that our circumstances, if we lookuttbom 111 the solemn light of God a revealing Word, are notdissimi lar There is impending over our unsheltered heads a doom compared with which this that tell from Gods mighty hand upon the Egyptians was a small affair indeed Now, I know that when I speak in this way I do not carry the sympathies of some moderns with me There is some young man who is saying; to himself, ' Ah, you are going to talk about fear, and try to frighten me into the kingdom I wish you to understand that I will not be moved by any such motive ' Indeed ! I know things are talked of in this way in the office and 111 the walks I used to talk so my self, and thought it was very philosophical and wonderfully grand, but I have altered my opinion now It is no good sign of you, my brother, to le declaring in that brazen faced way that you have no fear Last century talk of this kind was very common The Deist of last century was your forefathers. He purged the Bible of all strong passages His gospel was-Be sweet and genteel and don the afraid It produced, of course, 11 d tuity, dapper, little creature who had no great sense of his own sin, and no great fear of the Scriptural hell He was oneness with himself. and with good breeding, and fine manners, and getting up in the world, and that was all It is not philosophical for any man to say he will not be moved by fear We are moved by fear in other directions, and why should we not be so moved by the things that God has sworn shall come upon every soul of man that doeth evil Yesterday evening you were taking a walk and found yourself at a railway crossing You wished to go across in this direction, but you saw an express rushing down in that direction, and I rather think you judged it the better part of valor not to try conclusions with that train, but to be moved by wholesome fear tasty brother, my sister. Gods judgment express is coming Because the grass has crown a little between the rails, the devil gets you and me to believe that no more trains are to be run down the judgment hue, and we actually walk between the rails Stand back '-Step out Its coming ' That awful word that appears on the page of revelation, " Flee from the wrath to come," is no vain world, no hollow sound 'The dark cloud lies before us and behind us The skies are fairly flashing with the light of God's Rory FLEE FROM THE WRATH TO COME I We notice further, that on that awful night God took this matter of providing a way of escape from His righteous judgment into His own hand He left nothing to chance He left nothing to human wisdom He laid down a way of salvation so plain that he who ran might read And that again is why, to me, this old Gospel is such a glorious Gospel. It leaves nothing to man In it I see my Heavenly Father, my blessed Saviour, and the Holy Ghost, the iSnlightener, labouring, shall I say 1 to come down and strike my level, ray darkness, and ignorance, and sin fulness, and incapacity, and to lift me up to the height of God's thought, and the safety of God's salvation Ah, but this also is to some of us a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence I can imagine again the objector saying, "Now, preacher, I never heard a man who in such a short time had (gone so clean contrary to all my notions Preacher, you are utterly out of it, you and I are standing back to back " Well, turn round and looked me in the face You feel as I used to feel There you are "My great objection is that you leave nothing to human means, and I can't get over it And yet I trust you will get over it, for all truly wise men have admitted that in simple obedience to God's Word they have struck the true Philosophy. See how emphatically the narrative brings that out Suppose now that on that night of crisis God had said to Moses, ' I am coming to smite the egyptians Save yourselves full upon some plan so that My Angel of Death may pass you ever ' When Moses gathered all the elders of Israel, can you imagine some greybeard standing up and saying, Moses, the circumstances are certainly very solemn, indeed, I beg to move that the heads of families take a lamb with out blemish, and keep it for a certain number of days, and then kill it, and catch the blood in A basin and ga ft bunch of hyssop and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood?' We see at once that such a plan of salvation would never have dawned upon the mind of Israel No, but God did not leave them to them selves, and He has not left us Always before the wrath He sends the mercy : before the deluge He sends the ark and before that awful day that is coming He has sent us the Gospel to tell us that Jesus Christ is here to be our Ark of Safety, our Passover Lamb, trusting in whose shed blood there is no condemnation I can imagine a ration artistic Israelis 1 laying up and saying, " Now, let us stop a minute I fail to see, Moses, with all deference fail to see what possible connection there can be between the slaying of this innocent lamb and my deliver- ance from Gods judgment that is said to be coming abroad to night ' It is just the objection to day. " What possible connection is there between this Person who is said to die for us and our real condition How can there be such a thing in any real sense as substitution'' Ah, it is easy to ask these questions, and any fool can ask a question that no philosopher can answer I don't think! we are showing the depth of our wisdom but the opposite when we speak so God simply)) said, as it were, "Dont do it, if it does not suit your mind Here is My way I leave it to you ' Watch that swell nig, bursting scare in your soul, my young brother, to know everything Hold thou the truth done it well For fear divine philosophy should push be] out the mark and be Procuress to the lords of hell This story powerfully illustrates the doctrine of subaudition If these Israolitish fathers that night did this thing not merely with the eye and the hand, but also with the heart, each man as he took that white, innocent helpless thing, and plunged in the knife, and the gurgling, blood flowed out, was bound to have this thought in his heart ' If I have not to do something else has that's clear " Ah philosophy modern science, now gospel here may gather round this old atonement and put hard questions to it, but if you make the Bl bro your text book there is no getting out of it Without shedding of blood is no remission " Look how they did 1 ' Ye shall take a bunch of hyssop ' Notice again the great pains that God took to keep those people right If any Israelite that night was lost, you can see why he was lost. It was because he was a fool, and he died as a fool death How simple salvation is when you take God's way ' Hyssop was a common thing, like our broom, our furze, of which You remember in your own country home there was a very small utensil that was made of broom, and I believe among Israslitish housewives there would be a great rush on that humble article, and if there was none, out to the first dyke back and get enough to do the turn But what is the hyssop ' Well, what is that faculty in my mind and heart that is as common as a bunch of hyssop in Egypt or a heather scrubber in our houses ' Surely it is just faith Suppose we should wake up some morning and find that no faith in our follow men was left in our breasts, what a howling bedlam this world would become, and it is bad enough already 1 God says, " Take that common thing" Don't co dreaming about, saying, " Oh, I wonder what faith is I wonder if mine is the right kind of faith ' Take your own kind of faith, and put it out to God Do 1 you hear me " Man, woman, stop trifling ' he night is wearing, and the judgment is coming down Dont get excited, but be saved! Do you see that cross erected on a bill outside Jerusalem ' Do you see that Roman soldier as he drives the spear into the side of Him who hanns thereon' New mark that blood that flows from the wound was the last blood that was ever to be shed for human sin It is completed, and if you will not take your bunch of hyssop and dip it there, then " there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and of fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries " Men and women, again you are at the cross of Christ Are you trusting Him' For unless your heart is sprinkled with that blood, your feet are red with it. Thou art trampling under foot the Son of God ' . Let none of you go out at the door of his house until the morning ' that that is to say come to Christ and then abide 111 Christ I can well imagine that as that night wore on, and all things continued as they were through out the day, there came to be no small stress upon the Israelites faith and one bone I can imagine some eldest son with more bold mass than faith wanting to go out I can see him pacing; up and down restless, as you and I are sometimes restless when worldly men and women tell us, "You are living a poor, dull, doltish, sheepish life, on evangelical Christians come out, come of it"
