A MIRACLE IN SYDNEY. CASE INVESTIGATED BY A SCORE OF PEOPLE AND VOUCHED FOR BY A PROMINENT MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT. LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA LONG CONSIDERED INCURABLE BY THE FIRST PHYSICIANS OF THE WORLD HAS AT LAST BEEN CONQUERED. A GREAT VICTORY FOR DR. WIL LIAMS' PINK PILLS. (From the Australian Workman.) On Thursday afternoon our representative made his way to the bumble home of Mr. Thomas Jarvis, 45, Crown-lane, "Ultimo. He was discovered nursing a two- year-old baby, happiest men in Sydney, lie was up and about and able to answer the knock at the door. Although pale and bearing still the marks of a critical illness and a period of pain it was very clear that he was an invalid on the rapid road to convalescence. In reply to the preliminary questions he said—"You want to know all about my case? Well, I am glad of an opportunity to tell you. The facts may be of value to those who are stricken as I was." " How long were you suffering ?' " Well, twelve months ago I sot so bad that I had to.leave off work," and I have done iiothing since then. ? Abont five years ago next Christmns I met with an accident; X was badly scalded while taking a'bath tn Pitt street. Sydney. Since the accident I have been in failing health, and after four years of sradnal development of the malidy I was forced to give up my billet at the Glebe Island." "WliatwCTe the symptoms 1" "Simply indescribable. The pains were something terrible. They were just about as much as I could bear. They were for all the world like as if a Eaw were cutting my bones in two in every part of me. I had no control over my bowels or bladder and was a nuisance to myself, and everyone else. I was incesaatatly sniveling and shaking and could neither eat not- sleep. .On tile 23rd March last I saw a well-known doctor and he told me that my case was ntteriy hopeless. However, ie {rave-mean order to the Director of Charitable Institutions." "Did yon make use of the order?" "No; I came home land went {to bed and fawebeen Aetly.^rdlin-beH ever feince.' -Kve wieek?

Every body "who knows nie has been' arnazed at the chance in me. They can hardly believe their ?yes.

They -cure' locomotor ataxv. partial ?patalysiar and spinal disease,''also the many aisbroers which arise from an impoverished state of the blood, Koch as ttnasmla, pale and saUov complexion, general muscular weakness, indigestioo, lose aof appetite,',;Dhprtnese oi breath, pains in tbe hack, narvou? headache, Mr. J. S. T. McGowen, leader of the Laboi Party in tbe N.S.W. Assembly, was -seen hj oar reporter in connection with the remark' able case of Thomas Jarvis. If r. McGowen says he has known Jarvis from infancy. He also knew that he bad to give np his work at Glebe. Island abattoirs twelve, months age owing io a malady which%e developed. Ue afterwards heard that .Tarvis was bedridden and that there w&a; litde chance of hie recovery. He understood Jat\\-is wbs refused arhnisoon to the Sydney Hospital, as bis case had been proaoonoed - incurable. Mr. MoGowen waa .therefore, like-everyone else who knew tbe facts, astounded at the com plete'recovery of Jarvis.
