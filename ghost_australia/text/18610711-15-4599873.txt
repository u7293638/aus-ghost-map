MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF SIR W. W. BURTON, (From the Empire.) This heading may excite some surprise, not altogether unmingled with curiosity and alarm, on the part of the numerous personal friends of Sir William Westbrooke Burton In point of fact however, we do not mean that the worthy knight has disappeared through a trap door, or in a flash of red or blue fire, as might have been suspected, through the agency of his theatrical fellow passenger, Mr W H Stephens, 01 that he has presented anything like the vision of Sir Hildebrand, the gallant knight, Who saw his lady's ghost at night Shake off the veiling pall and shroud, And vanish in a parting cloud Sir William Burton s evasion was effected in the broad light of the afternoon, and witness sold by many , but, for all that, there were circumstances of profound my story attending his departure o, and they continue so to cn shroud that historic event, that we are obliged, reluctantly, forced to a subject with which we had hoped that we had done. It seems that Sir William had an Address presented to him "What was the character of that Address a What did it assert, and what deny ' What political dogmas did it lay down, and what political impostures did it stick up ? Why is it not published with the rest of the proceedings? If, as is said, it is to support a grey ance that is to be laid at that elysian gate, " the foot of the throne," why are we not allowed to li give a peep at its contents before it gets there ' 'checques tions are what may be called "staggers" Honest John Campbell evidently looked upon the document with suspicion He was a rather surprised that he should be asked to present such a thing, and seems to have held rather shyly aloof at first as if afraid that it would go off, but Sir William reassured him by reminding him that he was the son of his father, and therefore need not be surprised that he was selected for the office The anonymous epistle to Monteagle, in which the modern Solomon smelt the powder that lay hidden under the Parliament House beat eely created more con- sternation than did this mysterious Address It must have out toned the very latest tones of the old dominion in its original state Mr Thomson, it is said would not listen to it until it was modified Mr Hay insisted upon another excision Even Mr Want was shocked, and had some of it cut out Mr Irving, having signed in a hurry, even after these corrections, no sooner lend the document than he felt all the horror of a man who had endorsed a bad bill and was anxious to withdraw his autograph but repentance came too late to combustible a document must have had a combustible origin What was it about 9 Who wrote uncertainly not Mr Isaacs No wonder Mr Campbell approached it with timidity, touched it at first as if it was hot, and he apologised for his temerity when he presented it as a terrified man does a revolver, in desperation Even the recipient felt over helmed, notwithstanding all the water with which the iii of of the Address had been stacked To answer such an Address as you have done me the honour to present," said he, " is a task of so great difficulty that I would gladly be spared the expression of my feelings " May be so, but our daily contemporary s cruel reporter doesn't spare oars, when he keeps us thus tantalisingly in the dark as to the eloquent penmanship that created such ferment The "reply' speaks of the " degradation of the people, the designs of the deceased and other matters, which it is desirable should be amended , but still the public are deprived of the opportu nity of judging for themselves is to the merits and the truthfulness of the State ments responded to The Address is no where, so far as the public are informed It had been kicked from pillar to post cut up by one amended by another, interned by a thud, improved by a fourth, and disavowed by a filth, and, after an unsuspecting gentleman had been reluctantly inveigled into presenting it, to I it disappears like Aubicyb apparition, with a curious odour and most melodious twang " Whether Sir William has taken it with him, 01 left it behind for further collection before it is forwarded on contains one of its many mysteries It will probably turn up some day or other, in some Imperial Blue Book In the meantime study the public ought to be allowed to make the acquaintance of the interesting str anger, so that an opinion might be formed of the peculiar properties of a document which created such a unique amongst its authors and supporters on this side of the globe, and is, expected, on the other, to set each particular hair of her Majesty's Ministers on mid, " like quills upon the fretful porcupine ' ' COTTON Sun I During the year 1860, the world's cotton market was supplied with fl 124 000 bales of cotton Of this quantity, Ainei lea supplied 1,7 D,700 bales of of per cent of the whole Iharil supplied 123 300 miles or 2 pm cant , Egypt 119 160 bales of 21 per cent. west.
