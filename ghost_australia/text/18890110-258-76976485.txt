ON BOARD THE '«GINTRA" FROM BRISBANE TO TOWTs'S TTLLE. Jan. 5tli. OCTWAKD boiuid, I left the sweet-smel ling city behind me, witliont regret. The day is hot and sweltering, and it is a godsend to get a smell of old ocean again. I had intended calling on the Minister for Mines in reference to a: prospecting party to the Ethridge fuoin Charters Towers, bat I" found that he had gone to Toowoomba on Friday, one of his children being seriously mi well. Mr. King, one of the Royal Commissioners, who with Mr. Groom ^ and Mr. Will. Robertson, private secr»-i tary to the Premier, were going np on board the "Cintra," informed me that the Warden on Charters Towers eoald recommend the application. I would, therefore, advise Mr. Fogarty to apply to Mir. Mowbray. There were some 70 passengers on board the "Cintra" bound North. , She made a fast trip to Townsville being .two honrs under contract time, thonghihe^has *a broken propeller.

Anew chum" brasher" imported from home for the Company inspected the lights in Brisbane and prononnced the work all wrong, and proceeded to set it right by filing at the brashes, the result was that two of the wires were fused on Sunday night and an eclipse occurred, on Monday nigh-t during a concert given; There wasaveryrepresentativeaudience " seated on the poop. Hon. W. H. Groom, consented to preside, and the members of the Hansom Cab Dramatic Company, the officers of the ship and others, helped to bring oat a very attractive and varied programme. Mr. Lewis, the pianist of the company, played the accompaniments in a very masterly manner, some of the sailor ditties presented peculiar difficulties to "vamping," bat he got over them - all. The sea was as calm as a mill- js, pond, the audience most enthusiastic, even the inevitable baby was Inlledto rest "in the cradle of the deep.*' The ?> chairman said it gayehimgreat ple& sore to preside on that occasion, he would make some remarks lortJwr oa, present te would'^BcSiSrapffip7 selflo s announcing -the diffienent-eoiigs and -Tfeeifcyabns. in Sie ^c^ianime.'

Though played under diffi culties of shortness of stage fixings and under winking electrical lamps, the points were brought but tellingly,, and drew hearty applause. This com pany has had a great run in Brisbane, and will openin CharfcersTowers next week. Theylaaaded in Bowen and lam sure they will be highly appreciate in Charters Towers. .I'know what will £e£ch tfu! jboys here, and Carrie George will slaughter all ronnd her and in front of her. This concluded the pro gramme, and the 'chairman called on Mr. OTfane, of the NoRraKRN Mitter, to move a vote of thanks. , He said he was asked toperform a very pleasing dafy, that was, to move a vote of ihaiikB te all who had promoted the concert; first tothe peiformere, -vocal, instrumental and dramatic; next, to Mr. Groom, for his kindness in presid ing at the concssrt, ,and last, but not least, to the boss of the show, Captain Zjee (applanee).
