THE CUSTOMS REVENUE. This rallied again a little during the past month, and stands at £11,433 13s. 10d. for March against £8,67 4 7s. AL for February. Of this £11,435 13s. 10d., we have to set down £7,319 7s. 5d. to Hobart Town, and £4,116 6s 5d. to Launceston. But we have now the first quarter's receipts for the year, and they stand thus : Customs Revenue, January. £12.20 9 9 Ditto, February. 867 7 4 I Ditto, March..'. 11,435 13 10 Total for quarter.' £32, 310 10.10 That would come very close on the Treasurer's estimate, less the £10,000 he afterwards added to it, supposing it could be sustained, of which there is not the ghost of a chance. To have come up to the Treasurer's full estimate, it should have been £35,500 for the quarter, instead of £32,310 10s., and that would leave him with a deficiency of upwards of £12,000 on the year, supposing the next three quarters to be no better than the first. In the event of their being worse, the deficiency will, of course, be rateably increased.
