lfcoetrt>. Aniit Martha's Splnnlng-Whcel. With spfder-webbing tattered In travesties of lace, .Mid treaaarss yean have shattered-^ Once miracles of grace Imploring Time to spare ifc, With ruaty tongne of steel, Behold it in the garret Aunt Martha'* spinning-wheel, ' With slow and pensive fingera I wipe the webs away, While losing Fancy, lingers To paint an olden day, When youth and beaaty crowned it What gay songs usad to peal 1 Now crickets wail around it Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. I softly touoh the treadle ; It gives a plaintive squeak; It begs me not to meddle, In murmurs sad and meekÂ« Alas I the feet that lithely- ' r "** Onoe twinkled through the reel, No more shall pat it blithely Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. How oft its noisy turning Hath served a lover's need, And kept Age from discerning What only Youth should heed I 'Twould drown both vows and kisses. That lovers love to steal j A dear old treasure this is Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. For fear of house adorner In search of bric-a-brao, , Far in the garret corner /, With sighs I put it back; ' And there, just as I found it, I leave for woe or weal With ghosts to glide around it, \unt Martha's spinning-wheel.
