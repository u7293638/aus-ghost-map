THE MANLY STEAMERS. ,':! ADJOURNED MEETING OF THE ! . PORT JACKSOH S.S. COMPANY. 11 Tho adjourned annual meeting of share holders in the Port Jackson S.S. Company Limited, was held at the Sydney Exchange yesterday. Captain J.. Hcselton, chairman of directors, presided, and there was a good . attendance of both directors and holders of » shares. : ! " At the previous meeting, held on Monday, J July 25, Messrs. Mullens, Katcr, Russell, : I Carroll, Gorman, and Philbcn were ap pointed a committee to examine into the f bool:3 and papers anil ailairs generally of the company, and to confer with the directors , ; . thereon; and to report to the shareholders at a future meeting, the committee to have power to call in xirofessional assistance at ; the expense of the company. The mcetiug yesterday was the "future meeting" referred to. ' : . the report. ' Mr. Jostah Mullens, as chairman of the committee, presented the report which had , been prepared, which was as follows : — , : " The committee have held various meet ings with the directors of the company, and have to thank them, and also the olliecrs of : tho company, for the courtesy of their recep tion and the facilities offered to thcui in their inquiry. " The Accounts. — The question was duly raised as to the need of calling in a special professional auditor to examine the accounts presented on July 2o, but as they were duly ccrtibcd by gentlemen of standing, this was 'deemed unnecessary, and the inquiry was j limited to the questions of valuation of the company s property, of profit and loss as ! -shown in the balance-sheet, and of improve- ! unents in the trade of the compauy. " Valuation of Boats. — This matter has been tlje subject of careiul inquiry, with tho following results The depreciation pro vided in previous years, amounting in alt to £28,323, has not been sufficient, and there fore shows that the dividends paid in past years have in efloet been paid out of capital, and not out of profits. The amount required to be appropriated m order to meet the ease xs £18,058 3s 0(1, and the committee recom- ' mend that this sum bo written oil' the boats accordingly. ' 44 Laud.— The committee further recom- mend that a sum of £4879 4s 2d be appro; : ' ' \ priatcd in writing down the valuation of tho company's freeholds and leaseholds. With- i" out entering into detail it may be said that ( ; 1 the need of this appropriation is justified by the fact that the lease of Manly pier expir- ,i ing next year now stands in the books at > £3000. J ' Profit and Loss. — To meet the above ? " appropriations the following sums are avail able as amounts representing the earnings of : 'j the post half-year, or sums withdrawn from profits on previous occasions, and the com mittee recommend that they be so utilised '.v. accordingly: — Dr. — Depreciation of boats, £18,658 3s 6(1 ; depreciation of lands and leases, £4879 4s 2d ; total, £23,537 7s f- 8d. (jr.— Balance on December 31 and earnings oi last year. £6538 17a 5d ; insurance reserve, £3498 10s 3d; boiler reserve, £1500 ; deficiency, reprcscntiug .'loss of capital on June 30, 1892, £12,000; ''total, £23,557 7s 8d. The amended balance- 'sheet, duly audited and re-modelled on the : '< i above basis, is now submitted and reoom- 1 incudcd for adoption. ; « "The Deficiency. — In order to keep the ' deficiency ot £12,000 out of the working ac count the committee recommend that it be carried to suspense account, and further that at ho wntil.nii rtfi 4:600 rm December 31 and : < June 30 m each year, as a first charge on the ' ' net earnings. The adoption of this course will in 10 years restore the capital without : prejudice to the declaration of moderate . ; . dividends out of current workings if the : (board deem it proper. "Depreciation. — Tho valuations of boats -i A- and obner property now suggested for your approval give the company a fresh start from ; j ' this date, out the process of revaluation will ' . | 'need-to be carried oil from year to year with 1 j the greatest care. In order therefore to r,;diviae this absolutely essential burden . 'between the earnings of caeli half-year, the » committee recommend that an appropriation ibe made in January each year out of earn ings, and carried to an account to be called depreciation account, to appear in the jPrinted balance-sheet m that form. And, : ' further, that a like appropriation be made in ; .July, and the two amounts he then written oil tho book values of the company's pro- , ; i 'pcrty. : ; 41 Traffic. — This matter is receiving the ' ! -Attention of the committee, but as nothing ' ! in this direction can be concluded at present they recommend that their powers be eon- j tinned, and that tlicy lie called upon for a i further report if necessary at tho half- yearly . : | meeting in January, after which time tliey 'J i shall cease to exist unless thutmccbing other 's wise determine.— J. Mullens, chairman. 44 Note. — The undermentioned members of ' committee while agreeing to the amount to ri be written oil dissent to the proposed method h of dealing with the deficit. — Henry Gorman, 5 i .\h. e.

Siienstonk, Geo. Christie, l-'.LA., V. Sydney, August 19, 1892. : , , the discussion. Mr. Mullens, in moving the adoption of ; ( the report, strongly advised the meeting to : » accejit the suggestions which the committee ' . had made. Referring Lo the disputo which had arisen between the comxiany and the Manly Municipal Council, he thought t hat 1 matter would lie best left alone at a meeting i of that land. The committee were trying to :! act as mediators, and tho negotiations in pro gress were of such a delicate character that l in his opinion it would be injudicious to give them publicity. This, however, he would , say, that it was confidently anticipated that . i an amicable settlement would soon be arrived at. Mr. H. E. Rater, M.L.O., seconded tho ( adoption of tho report. Mr. H. E. Russell demurred. The only diflcrcncc, however, between Air. Mullens ' and hnnsclf was as to the mode of writing oil the dofictoncy, as to whether it should bo paid out of the profit and loss account by a ' prolonged agony of 10 vears or whether It should not be written oil at once out of the capital, so that the ghost of what was really a dead thing should not come un before tho : shareholders every half-year. Tlicy had lost bo much capital, tlic best thing to do was to write it oil' at once. Let them do what any business mau would do under similar cir cumstances. Mr. T. E. SynotTj who supported tho motion, held the opinion that it would be a \- good tiling to have the ghost rise at each meeting. By it the directors would bo re minded of their former errors and prevented from making similar mistakes again. : Mr., Russell moved as an amendment— . " That instead of transferring tho whole of tho available profits, thcro.be transferred tho sum of £3538 17a5d to the depreciation fund, ' and that the resulting deficit of £15,000 be written oil the cipital of the company by writing oil the auin of 15s per share m respect to botli paid up uid subscribed capital. ' The cifcct of this course, he pointed out, < would not be to prejudice debenture-holders, inasmuch as 15s per share from the paid-up capital would bring the shares to £4 5s. and 15s from the subscribed capital to £4 5s ; thus there would be the same diilcrence of : 1 £2 per share as ut present. If tho course he proposed vim adopted there would still :_ remain to the credit of the profit and loss account a sum of £3000, from which a mode- ) rate dividend might be declared at mice if thought fit. lie thought that the deficit of £12,000 among (lit issets would be mis leading and would tend lo depreciate the market valut of duires, especially as the company would not get rid ol the item under 10 years. Mr. Mullens disapproved of the scheme . pronoBccl by Mr. Russell, which, be thought, might land the company in an equity suit. he himself would takp tho necessary steps to prevent it being carried into effect. Mr. Russell maintained that the share holders ought not to be coerced in that man ner. Mr. Mullens' remarks were nothing more or less than a tlinaat. Mr. Mullens disclaimed any intention of making a threat. Mr. Russell accepted the disclaimer, but jioiuicd out that the cfficct of the statement would fie the same. Mr. J. R. Carey seconded Mr. Russell's amendment, and in doi ng so stated that the two balance-sheets—' v3y.m the directors' and the committee's — shewed practically the same deficiency, with the exception that the committee valued thci company's property at £5000 more than the directors diu, which was a very debatable question, but possibly not wise to dismiss at a general meeting. What remained was a question of policy only. The dircctorsU'ccommcndcd the writing off from the paid-up capital of a sum to cover the deficiency, and thereby admit of paying the ordinary dividend .out of the results of the last half-year's earnings. This course would insure tho payment in the future of a fair dividend on t;he reduced capital, by which the shares would command a more proportionate value iin the market. Tho committee, on tho other hand, suggested the addition of £5000 to the, directors' value of the company's property and the appropriation of the reserves, thus redlining the deficiency to £12,000, and to carry'that forward as a sus pense account, part to bo deducted year by year for 10 years. It remained for the share holders to say which poticy they preferred — the one keeping shares, at a nominal value while the market value was sure to be much below it. with a tendency to depress it more; or the other, to write off a sufficient sum to cover the deficiency from 1 he paid-up capi tal, thus insuring a fair dividend tor the future on the reduced paid up capital, which would make the shares of better value in the market, because people could then clearly and easily understand tho position of tho company. The creditors of tho company or debenture-holders, who were practically their only creditors, would not by tills course lose any of their security, as the shareholders were liable for exactly tho same amount as heretofore, viz., £7 per slui.re, and the pro perty was shown at its actual value, which in itself was more than double all the indebted ness of the company. On being put to the poll the amendment was rejected by 18 votes to eight, and the motion was then carried. Mr. J. Carroll wa3 then elected a director and Mr. W. Sanford rc-electcd. Messrs. G. Christie and W. Shcnstonc were also re elected auditors. A vote of thanks to the committee was moved by Mr. John Woods and seconded by Mr. T. Carlisle, and one to the directors and office-bearers of the com pany by Mr. W. Briggs. A11 extraordinary general meeting had been called to consider the following resolu tions : — "1. That the articles of association ho altered in manner following : — 4 By the in sertion after article 46 of the following article: 46a — The company may from time to time, by special resolution, reduce the capital of the company and may consolidate or subdivide its shares. Raid-up capital may be returned upon the footing that the amount may be called up again in the same manner as if it had never been paid up. The directors may, on any such resolution being passed, apply to the proper court and do all other tilings necessary or expedient to obtain the confirmation thereof.' 44 2. That the 71st article of association, fixing the number of directors, be altered by the substitution of the word 4 five ' in the first line thereof for tho word 4 six.' " This meeting, on the motion of Mr. J. Mullens, seconded by Mr. X. Carlisle, was adjourned sine die .
