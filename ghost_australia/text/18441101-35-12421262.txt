I rite statute which, as to the point in question is of a penal chair left the question is, in wh Horses md for what purpose was certain criminal jurisdiction conferred on this Court by the statute and if it appears to us, as it does after full reflection, that that decision, and the practice founded on it, having regard to the terms and object of the enactment, arc unwarranted, the duty seems plainly to follow of giving effect to our opinion the Act providing for the Administration of Justice in this colony, 9 Geo IV , c 83, enacts (s o) that, until further provision be made for proceeding by juries, all crimes and offences eli will be prosecute 1, b) information in the name of the Attorney (General in other Office) appointed for that purpose by the Governor by this enactment then close, until the establishment of a Grand Jury, the powers and fine tions of that body are vested exclusively in one other without super vision, limit a lion, or control But, I) s G, it is provided, that it shall be lawful for any) person, he had no time Cowl first obtained, to exhibit a Criminal Information against any other person, in the name of the Attorney i bear it or other such Officer, for an) Cunio or Misdemeanor not punishable by) death and, in gunning in) Rule for exhibiting any such information, (says the Act), the Court shall not be bound to require from the Party apply ing for the same as) ticulpaionj adjutants, intUsi the critic 11 the cnic appeals to injune that inch should first be made 1 The question is, as to the effect and object of these enactments It appears to us, that they plainly vi ore and he, Just, to give to this Court, the power possessed by the Queen y Bench, at Westminster, (which, otherwise, by force of s 5 and from the want of an appropriate Other, the Court would not have possessed ) or allowing a Criminal Inform men to be tried , power extending to i/mihincunois only be costly, to confer on the Court tli¿¡fljdl further power, in cases where it might be needed in or proper to exercise it, of allowing a Criminal Information to be exhibited, in cases of felony also, or other crime, not to deal in which the Queen b Bench has not that jurisdiction Now, in the former class of cases, the Court of Queen's Bench acts on certain prescribed and known rules founded on the principle that the application is addressed to its discretion- i which those rules are intended to restrain and (guide Ino j proceeding is regarded as one of an unusual nature , out of the ordinary course prescribed by law, for the prosecution of offences The Court, therefore, considers itself entitled to impose certain terms, of the condition of its interference and it looks not a merely al the transaction itself, but at all the attendant circumstances, the conduct of the prosecutor , the time at which his application is made and the object, for which it is made. What is there in the enact- ments cited, to induce or sanction the inference, that in similar cases different rules are to guide this Court' Nothing, certainly, in the language of the section conferring the power B) hate of the Cowl, an information may be exhibited, not otherwise But, whereas at Westminster exculpatory affidavits are always required from the prosecutor, (except where circumstances, without his default, preclude the possibility of their being offered, a wider latitude was allowed on such applications here. The Court is not bound to require them, unless it shall think them in justice called for the introduction of such a provision, pointing directly to the practice of the Queen's Bench in these cases, plainly shows (so to speak) what was then passing in the mind of the Legislature, and may therefore be taken, as under give of their intention But, if the construction hitherto adopted were the true origin other words, if this Court had no discretion in cases of this 1 and but must grant an information in every case in which a Grand Jury would find an indictment, the intention would plainly be defeated the Grand Jury, or the officer substituted for that body, can in no case, and under no circumstances, require exculpatory) affidavits or evidence from a prosecutor. The Attorney-General might, indeed, in his discre- tion, without such evidence, declined conduct the pt execution But he could not, on any such ground, lawfully refuse to initiate that prosecution, in his quasi capacity of Grand Jury. Hut this Court, in every' case, it would seem, they require, and, by the express terms of the stitute, it in certain cases must require, evidence of that nature it is, therefore, not in the mere position of a Grand Tun But, if not, as it appears, to us, cadet ghosts -the only argument against our being guided, on this motion, by the rules applied to such e fees, in England, is disposed of As I can discover nothing, however, in the ac ion of the thing, or the nature of thereunder tion, which the Court is in these cases empowered to exercise, to call for or justify the adoption of different rules the proceedings, by motion to the Court for a Criminal Jnunina tion, in this colony, is of as unusual a nature is as much out of the 01 dear 1 road se, prescribed by law for the prosecution of offences as it can be or is in England where, the 01 dinar j and prescribed course is, an application to the Grand Jury. Here, it is an application to the Attorney-General, acting in their place and stead Here, accordingly, as there, the devia- tion from it should be exposed to the same consequences Under what circumstances this Court may feel called on, in any particular case, to exercise the power of intervention, 111 cases beyond the jurisdiction, in this respect, of the Queen's Bench, we need not now consider But to hold that, in those e uses any more than in cases of music minor, like the present the Court can have no discretion is toititeiferencc.midmaj noticqune adequate grounds to be shown, for 1 depasture horn the odin 11 ; and described course of prosecution for crime, would be to place this Court in the mere position of an alternative tribunal for the initiation of prosecutions never be cision, concurrently with, to the exclusion of the Attorney-General, at the discretion of any individual in the community, desirous of exposing his neighbour to such an ordeal We come now to a consideration of the , meats of this this, in reference to the rules adverted to Of these, one of the most pro eminent indwell established is, that the party seeking the into a position of the Court or for whom it is in fact sought 01 intended, he himself free ft 6in blame in the matter Another 10, in cases more especially of this description that such interposition be Arms full sought, for its ownsike for the purpose in other winds for which it appears to be the applicant must, third to leave himself wholly in the hands of the Court and must cast no imput ations ex- traneous to that purpose, on his opponent. Looking, then, to these rules, we cannot divest ourselves of the impression, that then are two circumstances in the case, on which alone if there were no other, this Court ought to decline interference The prosecutor, 01 those it whose instance he his now appeared may still resort to that ordinary course of proceed ing and remedy, it so advised, which the constitution of the colony li is provoked , but to this extra holiday in interposition, we do not think he is entitled The first objection, is the me pointed out by the Court during the age mont This was an application to the Court, topcimitHobcrtl mu 1 squat, then a member of the Legislative Council, to be a criminal information against the defendants, the 01 e for sending and the other for bringing, a certain letters deal, with intent Just to intimidate him (Mr Lowe) in the performance of his duties is such member, and, secondly, to ] to vote and stir him up to light a duel It is to the latter a portion of theories' but, that we and dress ourselves the former we shall dispose of presently We enquire, then, in reference to the rules stated, which the conduct and the views are, is admitted by himself, of the gentleman who thus complains that, he has shown that he is not unwilling and in his own no raine he his himself (in effect) avowed, that in a lilting else it would not have heart Redgate break in the sinewy the very law under which he would have this Court assist him to prosecute another In what other better we regard Mr Lowes illusion to the station of the up posed eli silence But it we could doubt his mc ming in the reference made to it on the first occasion, it becomes warm when we lead the account of what it used on the second vi h it was this but a submission to the ven odessa recognition of and hope it to those very hay sales the offence of acting on which the Court is asked to prosecute his opp ments It is surely units -financed "Hitler «, as. (V ¿«x. shall "'be' JUW" ceded for such an offence to an applicant so circumstanced Hut secondly Mr I owe has not placed himself in the hands of the Court , in is he the poison we are really asked to protect He lead the letter in question on the 28th June and he comes here for the first time, on the 3rd August It should, perhaps, be stated, that he intended to have applied a day or two before, but this is firm item in It seems that the case was submitted by Mr Lowe, to the Honorable the Legis Give Corni cil (for reasons unnecessary here to enter into, on the 3rd July, and the motion to this Court a month afterwards on the last day of term, was the result Mr Lowe's is in his affect us that the proceeding vi is determined on after investigation by a resolution of the body it appears to us that, in so far is the supposed challenge is concerned this fact forms a decided objection to the application. The Court can only recognise Mr Lowe individually, was the prosecutor on that in utter But then we find that it is not he who in little seeks our assistance He comes to this Court in the last resort city and only at the instance of the Legislate Council. It is not for sin h circumstances that this particular nnied'^B^lepcnding on principles peculiar to itself wsydesigned line, the motion was doubtless made under an erroneous impression justified by the then practice, as to the duty of the Court, in cases of this nature The next point is the alleged intention of the defendants to intimidate Mr Lowe in the performance of his duties We are of opinion, that this intention cannot fairly be inferred, horn the terms of the letter It is therefore scarcely within our province to enquire how 1 u such an intention accompany inD such an act if established, would or would not be punishable by law 5 Mr do not conceive, however, that any serious doubt would be entertained, that any unlawful act however slight, done with such an intention, referring of course, to the future and not to the past would be so punishable But if any prosecution be con tempi i ted, in respect of the letter now in question, it may be well to consider what was its true character It is not impossible, that such a letter was less a challenge, than the prelude to one something intended to be followed by a cab allege probably enough but it may be doubted whether in itself it was a challenge But, however, this may be determined, we can have no difficulty in expressing our regret that sum a letter was sent or written, to say the least, upon the evidence at present before us, it was uncalled for and unprovoked According to Mr Lowe, he introduced Mr Macdermott s name into the Debate, referred to in the letter, with no design whatever to affront him, or to hurt his feelings, and in connexion only with a supposed intention, on the part of some other member, to bring the Defendant s name before the House, more prominently Under such circumstances, the letter was an improper one, and, how ever polite in terms, would naturally be regarded by the party to whom it was addressed, as an attempt to interfere with, and call 1 are to account for, the exercise by him of that privilege, to which every member of the legislature is unquestionably, and ought to be, entitled It would be vain and idle to suppose, that the great duties of a legislator could be discharged, in this colony or elsewhere with safety to the individual, or advantage to the country, if free dom of speech were not secured to him. But it would be as idle to call this secured, if he went afterwards exposed to question for using that freedom It is, how, ever, one thing to admit unqualifiedly that such privileges exist, and another thing to hold which we certainly shall not, that to call in question the proceedings of a legislator, or even to demand an explana- tion of them, or apology for them, is indictable' The right itself, of perfect freedom of speech in debate, and the importance of maintaining the right unimpaired, few will, I should think, seriously question All freedom may, no doubt, degenerate into licentiousness , but in our impatience of one evil, we should be careful not ourselves to create another, much more serious. It is enough now to say, however, that the privilege of which I have spoken exists and we must add, that no person who believed it to be Mailed, being. himself one of its depositories, not for his own benefit, but that of the community at large, would have been justified in placing it in peril, as Mr Lowe has invited to do We regret, however if this was believed by him to be his position, that he did not rest alone on that ground instead of adding refer ones, which (whether meant to reach the e us of the questioner, or not ) were not such as we feel in all disposed, of any point of view, to commend On the other hand, we too) equally called on to cxi less our disapproval of the nu petitions, so unnecessarily cast on Mr Lowe during the argument, by one of the defendants counsel imputations, for which we can discover no sufficient ground We have desired to look more favourably on the case of Dr Macfarlane, than that of the other defendant But, after giving both cases all due consideration, we feel compelled to deal with them, alike We give Dr Miefailanes assertion full credit, that he went with pict fie intentions But almost every second in a duel, we make no doubt referring to his first interview, at which he was probably the bearer of a cry it not only, might be able conscientiously to say the same Di Mic lane could hardly be ignorant that such letters are in fact of a hostile character , and, that he so regarded this is evident, from the question put by him to his principal, as to withdrawing you can we overlook on this occasion, (though the Court has not now to determine that case), his conduct on the following day, when he <o inconsistently accompanied another pin to, on an errand which, without his saying any thing as to the character of its proceedings, it is enough to observe was certainly), throughout, iincipinomHu inside In the whale, therefore, although we discharge the rule as against both defendants, we think it our duty to do so, in respect of each, without costs THE QUEEN, (ON THE PROSECUTION 01 U LOWE), I H M WIll It MOI T, T M\UUtIlNfc, AND SAME L MOORE The Cmtr JusTiCE said, with reference to the rule until, applied for in this case, that it would be sufficient, he imagined, to call the attention of the Attorney believed to the two first grounds, upon which the e as he had just delivered judgment in, had been determined The present application being virtually for a permission to amend the rule, the Court was of opinion that even if the amendment was allowed and the rule permitted to go it could not, for the reason before stated, be made absolute It was, therefore, the opinion of their Honors that they would best perform their duty) by declining to enter upon the matter any further taxing MARM, v yimtutnixri This was a matter arising out of a disputed bill of costs, and various cross motions having been made on either side, the Court had directed the case to be argued interim, with the view of disposing at once of all matters in dispute At present there were two applica nous one on bell ill of Mr. Clarke in the effect that Mr litrlnrduigebe ordered to ii) over to him the sum of 29 16s 1d , found to be due on a settlement of accounts, after the taxation of Mr Fitzhardinge s costs, together with the costs of such taxation, xc and the other, on the behalf of Mr Fitzhardinge, for a review of the 1'iothoiiotar) s lix action on the ground of his having fixed oil certain items, which, according to the spirit of the former decision, Givens thin honors with reference to this matter, ought to have been allowed The Court, after hearing the arguments of Mr Bno VDiiuiisrin support of the first motion, md of Messrs.

He also contended that This application came too late, as it was open to the other side to have applied in Chambers for the rescinding of the older of the Judge who had made it Mr WixntvLit, in reply, contended, that although such an application in Chambers as had been alluded to, might have been made, it was quite competent for the plaintiff to avoid prejudicing his case by such an aj position, and to reserve it for decision by the Full (Court As to the order not having been taken out, he argued, that having been fully entitled to sign judgment against the casual ejector, the plaintiff ought to be considered in the same position as if judgment was actually signed the Court was of ojHuon that the order ought not, as a matter of discretion, to have been granted, and their Hoxims were all agreed in thinking that no motion for an order of this description should in future be in use on at te, but only upon a rule nm, or a motion of which notice had been given in the present case, however the appearance and plea might be allowed to stand, upon two conditions first that an affidavit of merits be filed forthwith, and, secondly, that the costs of the present application be paid. h via i t in civil n in Uns was a rule mu, calling upon the defendant to show cause why an order of the Chief Justice relative to the payment of costs, should not be set aside, on the ground of the same having been obtained mcgill July, and in breach of good faith The rule was supported by Mr 1 suits, and 0] posed by Mr A hall li, the principal point in debate being, whether Mr Rogers, the at tourney for the defendant, had or had not declined to accept set was of the order to attend before the Judge, upon the ground of the notice not having been served in due time On one side it was contended that not only find Mr Rogers so declined, but that notice of in abandonment of the motion had been after w areas served upon him, and that consequently whatever costs might have been incurred Rela Ive to the matter, were unnecessary On the other side it was stated, that there had been no statement of an intention not to appear, but merely an assertion of the sufficiency of the sen- cc, andthntMr.liogtrs, conceiving he was bound to attend and to urge the insufficiency of notice as a ground of objection, had instructed counsel to appear and oppose before the notice of abandonment was given His Count decided, that although the defendant was justified in appearing and alleging the deficiency of notice as a ground for dismissal, there was no plea for retaining counsel to oppose upon an objection of this nature, the order therefore must stand , but the Prothonotary would, in taxing such costs, disallow the amount of the counsel's fee The rule was consequently discharged , but without costs DUCLOS V. PEnniEll. This was an application for the entry of a nonsuit in the above case, which had been tried before Mr. Justice Burton, or for the granting of a new trial. The grounds of the application were: first, that the seal of the Mayor of Nottingham, attached to certain documents which were given in evidence at the time of the trial, was not such a sea! as the Court was bound to take notice of; and that, although there was the signature of a poison attached who was stated to be a notary public, no proof was given of his being really an officer of that description ; secondly, that the declara- tion contained no count for money had and received, and that no evidence had been given to support the count for an account stated, which such declaration really contained. The motion having been supported by Mr Michie, and opposed by Mr. Broad fruits, the Court decided that the first objection, although tenable, could not be supported in, the present instance, inas- much as it was not shown to have been taken at the time of the trial, so as to afford the other side an opportunity of obtaining other evidence.
