SELECTED POETRY~ ON GLOAMING GRASSES. The light Is low upon the land* The wings of dusk are nigh, Upon the gloaming grasses standi Together, you and I. Why do we wait together bo ? I would we were apart, For you may give me more of woe And break again my hearti Yet, low bb snnset in the hills, So low my pulse for thee, Thy glance no vein with rapture fills, No passion eoatasy. Temp'rate aa shadows coolly lain About the earth's dark breast* ? So do I meet thy gaze again, Untroubled and at rest. Why Bhoald I see reproaohing eyes ? No Pbccoix heart is mine, From dead white ashes tip tb rise Responsively to (.hide. Why should I mourn to-night for thee ? Z ween no pity lay Within ycfar faithlesB brfiEiBt for me' The night you went aw&y.; IIOTB I I have ptayediforutr to aland Just aa we stand to night, And yearning so, ytour-toaehiotg hand Had filled my BOUI witblight, But praying daya'h&ve; passed for me And weeping nightSgrowH etilli Till freely nowis Riven'thee Forgiveneaa and goodwill! Nay, breathe no lie upon my faith, The heart you heid'ifratf trdS; Who bears the blame, tKatpasaion's wraith With wan eyes look at you? Who bears the blame that Z do hold Spent fireB where flames did start? For you did turn the embers cold . When you did break my heart. So in the sundown ^hadoWB take My answer to your claim Sweet love in ashes will not wake Howe'er you call her name. When gloaming grasses gather dew Zn Bome far evening's light Remember then the ghost you slew That walked the earth to night.
