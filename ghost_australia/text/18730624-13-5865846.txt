This lOsS they Aiibelj capitalised It amounted to £97 000 odd Instead therefore of dividing the £85 000 of life profits amongst themselves the shareholder magnanimously returned again to the life funds along with £13 000 move from the fire profits Is thin agreed not. to weaken confidence in a company The Liverpool and London and Globe has been the first to bravely grapple with this enemy of the future. The foreshadowed fall in the rate of interest looms over OA ery other life company The £600 000 000 of gold raised in the last 22 years and the £13 000 000 raised annually throughout the world is a rock ahead which will yet Alieck many a purely life company Under the English Life Assurance Act the fire cannot trench upon the life funds But the unlimited liability of the LIA el pool and London and Globe so acts that whatever de ficiency arises in the life from reduced in trees or any other cause must be supplied by the fire profits being appropriated to enable the life to fulfil its engagements Thus bonuses mother companies mutual ones especially depend upon life profits No profits no bonuses In the Liverpool and London and Globe the bonuses that will be paid at different periods are endorsed on the policies at time of issue and being contracts under seal are thus guaranteed and are as much bound to be paid by the shareholders as the sums insured No other company feminines its bonuses unless the imitators of the I ii erpool and London and Globe And if in time interest falls so low that the IHuely lite companies cannot pay their proposed bonuses they must be thrown over board The Liverpool and London and Globe could not do that the file profits would have to be devoted to the life, to prevent calls being made on the shareholder so that in this company at any rate the conjunction of the fire with the life is most advantageous to the life Policyholders of the Liverpool and London and Globe be reassured Since these Blunders not six persons have applied for surrender M my by letter or personally for themselves or as representatives for a number of others have applied for informant in and have been satisfied they have been shown that the fourth section of the English life Assurance Act says that the life funds shall be most easily be for all fire contracts on towed into after 1870 A (ne contract being an annual contract or mostly so it follows that all or most of those fire i shares in force then are now replaced by new ones and hence the life funds in any company down, a mixed business of fire and life are now are sponsible for his liabilities The 3 English I life ASBUI mee Yet under clause 10 requires that the returns to the Board of Trade shall be signed by the chairman and two of directors of the company and by the principal officer And clause 19 pro Miles that if any of the above Returns be of rise many particular to the knowledge of any person who SIMIS them Ruch Nelson shall be liable on indictment to have an him 1 risonment Still and likely to keep us all up fight The calumnies against my company no unmerited I will indicate then enter j eighteen months ago we reduced the fine rates we also abolished commission to be kers A storm arose Officers and brokers able views furious These were some of their tactics to enlighten the public After Chicago one of the managers made indifference to consequences by his angel told me himself that he had stood at his own counter and told the people that we could not pay £200 000 Another manager told me the same thing I replied Why we could p with it in Elizabeth street alone Another manager (french) speaking recently of the fire brigade dispute said that it was used to smite us for reducing the rates and that if we would not rejoin the other companies and raise the rates was their intention to refuse our policies that " to refuse a line upon any property which was partially insure My reply was in- stantaneous Do so and well appeal thiecttothe public against such tyranny against 17 offices endeavouring to crush freestone which has benefited them by reducing the rates They might as well try to crush Ailsa Craig ' jig, By putting A anouB this and tints together with surmises confined entirely within my own office I conceived a suspicion There upon I wrote to Mr. Martin the second in command of the Imperial Insurance Com- Many asking whether he was not Life policyholder who wrote in the Al us stating that I should be glad to receive his denial He replied thus -
