ARRIVAL OF THE STEAMSHIP GREAT I -BRITAIN. Prominent amongst the arrivals in port yesterday, was that of the above renowned veteran steamship, which has once more made her appearance In these waters, and added another to her already long list of fortunate passages from the regularity with which her voyages in the Australian trade have been accomplished, the arrival here of the Great Britain within a given limit from the date of her departure from the old country is looked upon as almost an absolute certainty, and rarely, if ever, does the dis- appoint expectation. On her present trip she brings about 60 passengers In the saloon and 850 in the second cabin and steerage. Amongst the former are Mr. Anthony Trollope, the well-known novelist, and the Hon. That. Howard Fellows. included in her list of 'tween deck passengers are a number who have came out here under the assisted Immigration or warrant system, and they are classified as follows :-Married couples, 8 ; single men, 11 ; single women, 14; boys, 12; girls, 8 and Infants, 2. The whole of the passengers have arrived in excellent health, and at the termination of the voyage an address of a complimentary cha reefer, and accompanied with a substantial souvenir, was presented to Captain Gray by those in the saloon. On the arrival of the good steamship being telegraphed from Port Phillip Heads yesterday, the steamer Mystery was chartered by Messrs Bright Brothers to convey their representatives and a large number of friends of passengers down the bay to meet her Mr. Leslie A. Moody, immigration agent, and Mr D W. Gossett, senior immigration officer, also went down in her to officially inspect the warrant San mongers and their accommodation. On the little Ijstery ranging up alongside the Great Britain, three hearty cheers were given by the passengers, and the company on the Mystery returned the same with all the lung power at their command The waving of hair and handkerchiefs, too, as friend recognised friend, was something demonstrative. Since her last visit to this port several changes have taken place amongst nor officers. Mr. P. Robertson, formerly second officer, has succeeded Mr. Lawrence son as chief, and Mr. J. R. Brown takes Mr. Robertson's place as second. Mr. G. A. Bell is third officer, and the others are Mr. G. Johnston and Mr. F. D. Denistoun and the now medical officer on board la Dr. W. S. Smythe. Amongst the "old familiar faces, there is still ber gallant and cheering commander, who, with his usual felicitous manner, has secured the thorough goodwill of all on board, and who, as the passengers left the ship, was enthusiastically cheered by them. Mr. Unsworth, the purser. is to be found at his old post, and in the engine-room Mr. Walker is still chief. From the abstract of the log which is appended it will be seen that the weather during a great portion of the voyage has been decidedly against the ship making a rapid passage, more especially during the last fortnight, when strong gales from the eastward were encountered. The Britain left Liverpool on May 24, and after experiencing westerly winds for a few days followed by variable and easterly winds, She crossed the ( equator on June 6, in long. 19deg. Stain. W. The meridian of the Cape of Good Hope was passed on June 28 In la;. 42deg. 10min S., and from thence the voyage, which had up to that time looked promising, was greatly retarded by adverse weather. Port Phillip Heads were entered at half-past 7am yesterday, and the ship anchored at her usual mooring ground about 1 o'clock in the afternoon. The following is an abstract of the log: Date. Winds.

The trim little ship is in her usual admirable order, and has again come out in charge of her well-known commander, Captain Largie. The Jerusalem sailed from the Downs on May 4 and after beating down Channel passed Start Point on May 7 with moderate variable breezes, which continued until falling in with the N.E, trades. After a run of favourable weather In the trades, which were parted with in lat. 7deg. N., light variable winds set in and prevailed until crossing the Equator, on May 20, in lon. 28deg. W.

After making Cape Leuwin. and until within 120 miles of Cape Otway, the ship had to contend against violent gales from 8.8 R. to E.N.E. The remainder of the voyage was marked by W. and W.N.W. winds and squally weather. A number of prize bulls and heifers have arrived in the ship in fine condition. The Jerusalem will discharge her cargo at the railway pier, Williamstown.
