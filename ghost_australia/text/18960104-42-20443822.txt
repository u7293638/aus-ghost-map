Taroom Grassfed Races. (From Our Own Correspondent.) December 29. The Taroom Grassfed Races, which came off on the 27th instant, were a great success. Large fields, fast times, and in most cases close finishes were the order of the day. Great credit Is due to the secretary, Mr. E. T. Gatehouse, for the way in which the programme was carried through. After paying all ex penses, the balance was on the right side. One remarkable feature was that the grassfed hacks did times equal to the trained cornfed horses. One of our local sportsmen remarked that the only, way he could account for It was that they trained the wrong horses ; the hacks were fed and trained, and the racehorses were let run in the bush untried. Below is a detailed account of the races :— Maiden Plate, £5 ; %- Mile.—W. O. Scott's eh.m. Zephyr, 1 ; W. Lxwson's ch.g. Stranger, 2. Twelve others started.
