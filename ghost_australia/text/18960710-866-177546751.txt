T h e Ghost Scandal The reply given by Ministers yesterday to Dr Crowther as to taking steps for the ... of the individual who is going about frightening ... females who are compelled to be out after dark in the less frequented parts of the city can- not be regarded with satisfaction. Some- thing will have to be done and if the Municipal authorities are powerless in the matter, then the Attorney General must come to their assistance. Shortly before 10 o'clock last night the vile scoundrel made his appearance in North Hobart near Colville street, and alarmed a woman who was proceeding homeward 'The miscreant, as far as can be gathered had inserted himself in Mr Seager's garden, and as the person in question approached he jumped over the fence. Two young men in the vicinity hearing her screams at once went to her assistance and found her in a dangerous state nervous excitement. This morning she had not recovered from the shock and was in a somewhat critical condition. There appears to be only one way to prevent the nefarious practices of the villain, and that is for a number of strong men to dress in women's attire, and when the vagbond makes his appearance to shoot him not necessarily in a vital part, but to prevent him making his escape. When caught he ought to receive such punishment as to secure the curtailment of his freedom for some time.
