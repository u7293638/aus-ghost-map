Somnething had woke, her; wlhat, she could not tell. Sle li mibtionlless, listening with tlhat peculiar intensity with which one is apt to listen when woke suddenly n the middle of the ilighlt.- The room .was ldark. There \was the sound of distant rumbling:: they were at work upon the line, wlhed they would sometimes continue shunt ing from dusk to dawn.
