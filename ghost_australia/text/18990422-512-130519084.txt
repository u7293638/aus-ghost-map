A SUPERSTITION THE CHINESE HOLD. The strange unwillingness of the Chinese to afford help to a drowning man, or anyone in absolute, peril of his fife, or. otherwise, iB based.upon the belief that the ghost of the last man killed always acts as watchman ' of tbe hades, or purgatory,' into which, accord ing to Chinese belief, the spirit of the depar ted lirst enters, and from which he can only be relieved by the arrival of a freBh ghost. If, therefore, a man's life be saved from accidental death', the spirit of the per son who died immediately before him is in a manner cheated out of his relief, and will assuredly haunt the person whose misplaced humanity has condemned it to a fresh term of servitude.
