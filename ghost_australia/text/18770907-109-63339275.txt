"Well, it is not unlike a theatrical performance in which the audience are. all actors. It is not unlike the waxworks with the breeth of life breathed into the dummnies. It is not unlike what the Yarra Biend would be if the inmates were allowed to carry out their wildest fhncles. It is not unlike History, Biography, Mythology, Poetry. Fiction and Drama run mad, and escaped flom' 'the pages of wormoaten books far one night's prank every three years. This it may lie said is 'what it is not unlike, but does not convey ari idlea lfr ?vJist. it is like. We are' not goling to shrinik from solving 'a problem simply because it is hard. We want every one, no matter how'. faur removed in time, or space, or position, from the revellers of last Tuesday evening, to have all idea of how they losrkeerl oil the iemonurable event, miad we are determined they shall have it.
