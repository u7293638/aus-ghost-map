III. ? [ ;1; ?? ' : ' ? Ifc wàs thre and the runaway< had not yet heen'arreatecl. , But the Governor'pf« Dówmoor was rejoicing jin his soul fbecauaefof? tidings just received. Mtor a fortnight had! elapsed, and the convict , was still at)lUberty,-it ! had really seemed highly probable that he would; never be taken-that he had managed to get clear away, either into some distant part of Eng-, land or on to the Continent. He might have contrived to secrete' himself as a stowaway ¡on; board some ship at Doveton, and so haye escaped;? s But the watch on the wolds was still kept up,; and now it was reported that the fugitive i was; lying hid somewhere among tho rocks, and morasses on their immense area. ; , ' ; f j The head and legs bf a mountain sheep had1 been found by an angler in a nook under a Btone, on the Btream not! far from Beacon Hill, rendering it almost certain.that the convict must be in hiding not far offyand'réducèdto dire straits of food. Meanwhile we have been paying but scant . ? - ; ; attention to the wounded Dr. Brand. Stephens had not killed him, bnlThis injuVy had necessi tated .repose and long pursing at home. The .prison dootor. live^d in a house of Iiis own in tho iittle town, ancfoattended the scattered inhabi tants of the'moor, and the few residents of the. -place, besides ministering to the convicta. As he. i-was a bachelor, his house was4oo large*forhim ; I his wants were attended -to? byj.¡a-'faithful' óld I.family servant, who every-day of the' dootor's illness used to answer the door to inquiries as to ¡how the patient was progresaing. , ;Even now,1 ¡'three weeks'after the at tack-upon him, he was'I unable to do more than come down from his bed room to his parlor, though-'he was hoping the j next day, under the caro ot the Eamsworthy sur I geon, to be well enough to be out and. about. ! ..: -The -Governor had called1, once or'twice to seo; I him..

Then, after a minute, Could ¡you send for Bob Jakes, think you ?" ' I "It's too late, sir j rlie. lives right up at Iron gate. But he'll be in at school to-morrow morn ing again." ' f ¡ The doctor fidgeted in his chair all teatime. Somehowr4-he could not account for it-a feeling oJf; .uneasiness had . crept over . him. It waa; un deniably f i strange, in a ' deBolate upland village, that an unknown man . should take the trouble , to ask after his, the doctor's/ health. 1, i. ; i. ¡ . '."I'll. just step over andi'see the .'Governor/ I think," he said to his housekeeper after the meal; And, in Bpite of her protest/he sallied out in the damp mist of the October night; driven forth by a feeling which he could not explain oven tor him self., :-.

" he asked peevishly. '' No/ doctor,", one of the men at last.said " only it's odd, you know-" ' > . 1 " What is ?" asked Dr. Brand, in rather a snap pish tone, ! " Why, sir, when you went out ten minutes ago, you said as how 'you'was going.home foi good." j ' 1 1 ... ' ; I ^Iti-was the doctor's .turn to] stare. \\...

"Comewith me;to the Governor's, one of you !1 shouted the doctor, with, sudden-, Marm an< energy, as ho pushed his way in through the half opened gate.
