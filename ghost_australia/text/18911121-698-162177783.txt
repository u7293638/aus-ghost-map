Then! Calm, be calm ! poor friend, and sleep ; Thy head lay on my breast. My heart for thine doth weep, My tears for thee shall fall like ram Upon thy silent rest. But for one hour to see thee lie By life's cruel vision unopprest — Fam would I dream thou wert again Yet as in days gone by. Xo more — those fatal words no more ! Knowledge is cruel and strong : Sharp pain glides love before ; Thou can'st not be as thou hast been — Lost health and woe and wrong, These have a power to blight and kill : Ghosts of dead joys and mem'ries throng — Thou wilt not be as thou hast been Until thy heart is still. ?. ^_ ?
