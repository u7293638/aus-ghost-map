GUMERACHA. [From our own Correspondent.] Gumeracha, September 6. On Tuesday evening the conversazione in the Institute Lecture-room went off with eclat. The admission was confined to members and their friends, so that the room was not inconveniently crowded. On the tables there was an admirable collection (for a country district) of curiosities of nature and art, also of philosophical apparatus. The walls were tastefully decorated with ever- greens, among which moss of all countries were interwoven with good effect. Dr. Dickenson was in the chair. The programme consisted of the following papers:—"The Philsophy of a Candle," Mr. H. Lewis; "Reminiscences of Western Aus- tralia," Mr. C. Heritage; "A Peep into Space," Mr. Hicks; "The Polytechnic Ghost," Mr. H. Creed; "The proposed Decimal System of Coin- age," Mr. F. J. Lewis; and, last, "The Laws of Gaseous Diffusion," Mr. H. Lewis. Several reci- tations were given at intervals by Mr. J. McEwin and others. HAPPY VALLEY.—On Tuesday evening, September 5, the second of a series of lectures, on behalf of the Manse Building Fund of the Congre- gational Chapel, was delivered in the chapel by the Rev. F. W. Cox; subject, "Tennyson's Poetry, with readings from Enoch Arden." The lecturer first defined poetry as distinguished from prose, and then spoke of the beauty of Hebrew poetry. To justify the practice of poetical quotations from the pulpit he referred to three instances of it in the addresses of St. Paul. The rest of the lecture consisted of a criticism of Tennyson's merits and defects as a poet. Anthems were sung by the choir at intervals during the evening. There was a good attendance, and every one seemed gratified, both with the lecture and the singing.
