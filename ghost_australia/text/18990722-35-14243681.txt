Tho statement by tho *' Times " that thu Trans- vaal crisis had boen ended by Great Britain'« I acceptance of the franobiso proposals hat caused consternation at Capetown. Air.

Englishman that if ho wants' to put anyone in a good humour ho first of all feeds him. As Mr. Meredith might say, humour relaxes through the stomachio unbending, and oven the mirthless Intighs. Perhaps the philosophy is true and is no moro shallow than moro pre tontious sounding inquiries into the human organisation. Tho world must bo fed, just ns it must bo peopled ; and it is oortain that a well-fed world is in a bottor humour than at any other time. Tho publio banquet is a diroct nokuowlodg niont to tho truth of that fact. Itivnl politicians aro ofton seated at the same boord.; but, ovon when they are com- pelled to disagree with each other, thoy do so with dooorum and moderation when an excellent dinner is being digested. Wo do not hear of those socnos and boated disruptions which are the eommon plncos of Parliamentary and municipal existence overywhoro ; and perhaps if governing bodies always dined on masso boforo tho agenda wore considorod at nil, bottor results might bo obtained. Of course such a suggestion is not at all .practioahlo ; it is only ono of those dreams of tho idealist whioh we all sigh aftor whilst wo know thom to bo unattain- able. To tho British banquot mon bring thoir settled viows on this or that.subjoot, mid express thom in a strain of mild and pleasant didaotics, or thoy moko authorised nnd nntioipatod announcements, or thoy aro congratulatory and in the mood to praiso dofinito objoct3 and mon. Tho nbsonco of dobato is the ploasantest foaturo of publio nf tor-din nor spoaking ; but it is to be foarod that ovon if Parlia- ment bogan o.toh day with a good general dinner to its members tho length of tho inovitnblo discussions would not bo cur- tailed. Tho noorbitios of dobato might bo somewhat softonod ; but that is doubt- ful, for familiarity might brood contempt. That is ono of tho advantages of tho modern banquot it seems. Mon of nil shndos of opinion may meet, and whilst thoy onjoy onah other's society liston, amidst pleasant surrouudiugs, to ofton woll-oonsidorod words. Tt is' not uninteresting, loo, to reflect upon the history of tho publio banquet. Aftor nil, though wo may bo inclined to smilo sometimos at thosu olaborato gas trononiical plncations boforo sorious matters aro ontortainod, the bnuquot in enmo shnpo or form was au institution in ovoiy age. Do wo not frequently rend in tho pages of the Biblo of solemn and fostivo foasts ; and, to thoso who put on an nffocted scorn of nil things ninterinl, these epic nccounts of tho banquot niny furnish n wholesome corrective. But porhnps any such nttitudo is an alïeota tion of nu nlfoctotion that noods no miBworing. In our day dignitnrios of soveral Churches sit and speak at tho public diniior-tnblo, nnd in their company aro to bo found mon of overy dogreo. Tho modern banquet discovers tho disappear- ance of many caBto traditions. Thoro is now no salt to mark tho estate of tho guests ns thero was in foudnl times. Oortainly thoro tvns no publio banquot ns wo know it to-dny in thoso times ; but tho groat feudal lord kept open house, and all woro welcome at ono or another of his tablos-Ivnnhoo and Jinis Giiilbort and Gurth, and ovon lanac of York. No doubt thore woro othor motives for this liberal ontortnin niont than moro 'hospitnlity, for tho possessors of cost-iron privilogo in days gono by had duties,to disohnrgo as well as rights to rigidly etiforco ; but at bottom thoro was no doubt the fooling tlinc tho banqueting table mado a common groui«l for intorciiurso and mooting. That fooling is oven stronger to-duy, so that tho publio banquet, is almost too readily resorted to whonovor tho socially inclinod wish to convoy thoir feolings towards others. It is ono of thoso fixed modern in- stitutions which weall occasionally jost at, but which wo aro all ready to avail our- selves of when wo are inclined. It is not likely to disappear ¡ and if the ladies como to bo recognised ns essential to it, its hold will not grow loss. A loading English politician roaently gave utterauco to some tronchant criti- cisms on tho subject of sport ns it appealed to an outsider, mid ovon to the most ardent supporter it pre- sents many aspects mid vagaries that aro sufficiently romnrkablo to o.tcito attention nud wonder. Tho growth of sport and tho incronsod hold that it is get- ting on mankind aro bocoming more markod overy day, and tho observer cannot fail lo bo struck with tho increased seriousness mid intousity that aro being importod into what in times gone by partook moro of the nature of pnstinio nnd recreation. ' Now it is a busi- ness, and a responsible and trying one, thnt calls for the oxorciso of tho keenest onorgies both of mind and body. But especially do wo noto tho onormous influ- ence that sport nt tho prosent day exorcises over the mass of the people. No event in tho political world can for a moment com- paro with the interest urousod by compe- titions of sport. If news of affairs in various pnrts of tho world should happen to bo cut off for a day or two tho general public does not grieve very profoundly, but lot thom lose tho account of a great sporting contest and murmurs loud and doop would speedily bo hoard. Dur- ing tho visit of tho last team of Eng- lish cricketers to Australia . tho complaint was that our telegraph service with its long overland line across tho continont was inadéquate. Owing to tho huge expanse ol' country to bo traversed mid the risk of n breakage occurring nt some distnnt spot it was iniporativo, wo hoard, that a duplicate Uno should be provided. This was tho decided opinion expressed in tho newspapers in England. Whilo wo only sent uows about our progress as a natiou, or of our wealth in gold and coal nud timbor, mid other prosnio mnttors, loss was snid. For nu examplo of the striking methods pursued and tho strange intensity dis- played, not merely by individuals but by great masses of peoplo, over a pro- minent sporting ovont, wo have but to noto somo of the features conneotod with tho coming international ynoht cou rests for tho America Oup. Tho races talco placo in October next, but so far back as March last it was aunouueed that overy available boat that was floatablo had already boon chartered in Baltimore, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia to oonvey sightseers to witness tho contest. Aftor that date no suitablo craft could be hired for less than ¡2500 dollnrs for tho three days' racing. Tho railroad oompanies, too, had thus early arranged a programme of a number of speoial trains to run to the const, and a prominent Now York journal announced that its speoially oqnippod boat for following tho race was to bo fitted with wireless tolography ap- paratus, from whioh during tho course of tho contest would bo flashed to its office particulars of the positions and movomeufs of thocompoting ynchts. Prom the accounts anyone might havo supposod that the race was coming off in a faw days instoad of six months later. But perhaps tho most curious feature was tho precaution taken to preserve the strictest secreoy re- garding the matorial and lines of conatruo tion of these fine raoing machines. Sir Thomas Lipton's yacht, the Shamrock, at ! Thornycroft's shipbuilding yard at Cnis wick, was coustructod in seu.ions, so that oven tho workmen engaged upon it would know nothing oxoept of tho pnrtioulnr parts upon which thoy wero engaged Cortnin sections of thn j acht about which tho most caro was being exercised woro biddon by thick canvns soroons oven fiom tho viow of those who had access to tho works, and tho wholo of that portion of tho shipbuilding yaid in which the Shamrock was being constructed wns entirely eovorod m by a largo Bhod It Booms humorous to ndd to thoso snfogunids a doteotivo, but it is a fact thnt ono of tho ablest officers fiom Scotland Ynid was pla.ed in chnrgo, and events proved that his pioseuco wns required.
