TJHE TWO ©REAMERS. Two Irishmen travelling, came to a very poorly supplied inn. ' What can you gisfe us for supper?' said they to the lean and shivering land lord. ?'I've naught in the house but ono siigeun,' replied he ; ' so you must moke the most of it between ye.' ' All rin-ht.' reulied the shrewder of him two ; ' bring up your bird and we'll divide Siini.' The dish was accordingly produced, when Paddy turning to his companion said, ' now Mike, I've been thinking this ghost ?of a bird won't bear dividing ; what do you say for tossing up for it in thi9 way — we'll -ro to bed, and tomorrow morning, who everiins liad the finest drame shall have the pigeon for his~breakfast.' The proposal was accepted, and next morning, when 'the fellow travellers' met lJ:id-ly took the word and inquired of his companion how he had slept, and what he had dreamed. ' Bedad !' replied Mike, 'and didn't I just drame, and wasn't it a drame that'll bate hollow every other drame thativer was drained. There was I in the very midst of the sivinth heaven, with all the powers of glory round' mo, and clouds of angels and at channels and a bewilderment of saints and patriarchs, all making much of me, and hoisting me up, and up, and up, till I couldn't go any higher and then I woke.' ' Och, well,' said the other ; ' its .a strange thing ; but 1 hnd exactly the self same drame meself, and I knows what you s;iys tin tie, far I saw ye .flying up ,«!;'.! up, and I says to meself, ' sure, now, Mike's got tip as high as that he'll never be sich a fool as to comedown any inore/ so 1 got up and ate the pigeon.' ? ? -' ? *' . ? . . ?
