CORRESPONDENCE. (Wo do not necessarily identify ourselves with the opinions ex presto* t hy our correspondents.) THE CII 011 A] i SOCIETY. To (lie Editor of the AnvKimsKR. Sin.—*T went to the Williumstown Choral Society's concert on Tuesday evening last’ mil a very en joyable one it was: but bow flat everything went owing to the very sparse at* tendance. The ghost of applause was the most any one received. Cannot the honorary secretary wake the members up to take a greater interest in the sale of tickets, or if it is not a question of money, hold the concert in a smaller hall, and then the very unpleasant ring of the human voice in a half filled building would be got rid off. These enter tainments should be made more popular, as they are really the best of their kind held in the town. Will the committee try and be energetic and repay the ladies and gentlemen for the time spent- in learning their patts in the various operas sung by having a bumper house at their next concert and a larger at tendance than last Monday evening at the} REUNION.
