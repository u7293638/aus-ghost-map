Thie mixed sentiment jarred on Leila; but he was rich, in al good regiment, with excellent prospects. What mattered it tilrt le was far beyond thirty, and no longer so llimi aI he had hcutu ? It was a good match for a lcteuilees girl, as:d he had no choice, and so, loi, before the ovenlig was over, people were wlispering to gqther concerning Miss Marsden and Major Ar. burton, unud a report flew about that lihe had proposed atd been necepted.

Leila bent her head in assent, aind they passedeoutof the rco n on to the long. low ver. intdalh, somewhat to tile dismay of hiersister, who had watched them eagerly while together. The moonlight threw the girl's IssIe fateo atl tall, slight figure into strong relict against the dark verllahta background. Clharlio Willoughby lianed againsta pillar overrun with creeper, and loe;od at her fixedly. He made no excuse for himself, nor did he break the silence botwecn them. His eyes searehod her face ns though he woul!d read there what he dared not trust him. self to hear. Prcsently Loeila spoke. Irr voice sounded faint and tar awaR, cven to herself. ' I hear,' she said pleadingly,' that you are going to rido u very vicious horse tomiorrow in the ladies' prize race. Please don't ride it; please do not.' 'And I hear that you are engaged to merry Major Arburton' (without the slightest refer. enco to her appeal.

SAnd you are good enough to take sufficient Interest s me to wish me not to break my neck to-morrow ?' She was still silent. Very good. Thin liMten tome.

If I win I shall con sider you mino in spito of nil the Major Arburtons in the world. If not--do youuunder stand the alternative, Lotla?' She hent her head. Could she avoid under stalrling it? 'It lies with you,' hle went on steadily. 'You :nown my horio, you know the racecourse, you know ie. If to-morrow before starting you bid me ride to win, very good : if not- 'he musllio has begun again. Shall I tike you back to yourelderly future baronet?' ' Mydear Leila, what nonsenso!' cried Mrs. Anatruther. 'Itub yourchous!ks, child, anddrink this wino. Youlookcs white as a ghost, mand about as unhappy.

Lolla, in her sister's room. was utterly refusing to accompany her to the racocoure and equally positive in her refusal to seoe Maor Arburton. I know hlat it is,' Mrs. Anstruther went on angrily; ' that boy has boon talking non sense to you. It was too foolish of you:to givo hIinu duaco last night. If I had known of it I should have taken you homo most cer tainly.' 'Ito dd not talk nonsense, and he is not foolish, nor Is lie a boy,' cried Lolla, vohe montly ; and then she gave way, and relapsed into copious wepisng. SAt any rnle, lie is only a sub- liautenant,and cannot possibly have more than five hundred a year. And olsat is more, he doesn't mean it seriously with you. If you throw over Major Arburtonnowyou will be throwing hint over for a more shadow. Everybody knows what a flirt Charlio Willoughby is. Ile makes love to every girl lie meets.' ' That isn't troe !' exclalmod Loila with an effort at drying her teasr. 'It'm! How about Fanny Hope, and one or two others I couol mention ' Biloence. ' And how about his debts I' Silence.

' I will go with you,' she said, scarcely above a wlisper. The ladies' prizo raco was the next on the progratrnmo. Coniedcrable excitement pro viilod among the fair sex us to who would win it.
