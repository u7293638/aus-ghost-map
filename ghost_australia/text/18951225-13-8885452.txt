WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1800. Christmas is an institution which, for the English speaking races at least, survives all the shocks of time, all changes of climate, all ebb and flow of national late The Scotchman, it is true, may have some unspoken doubt about the entire orthodoxy of mince pies ; but the Englishman takes his Christmas with him everywhere, as he takes his kite!' captain e, or his love of cricket, OIN lim mother tongue It is part, if not of his nature, yet of the familiar landscape of his life To the philosopher it is nothing less than wonderful how a festival purely heathenish in root and origin bom in the depths of some prehistoric Company forest, a mere fragment of Druidical worship-has been conquered to modern and Christian uses, and fills an essential place in the almanacs of all Christian nations in part the spell of Christmas lies in its appeal to the domestic affections It is a i allying signal for all scattered house holds In put, too, Christmas is beloved as the great holiday signal of the year As it dawns the roar of city noises sinks, and city men, whose nerves have grown over tense with the strain of office and shop are found scattered over a hundred sea beaches or mountain tops, absorbing ozone, removing the joys of their childhood, to come back from the process brown faced and vigorous The central significance of Christmas is, of course, purely religious The season is a perpetually recurring witness of the great pinnacle upon which Christianity KSIS, a miracle which, it true, makes all the other miracles of Christian story entirely credible If, indeed, under the dissolving needs of modem criticism the Divine Founder of Christianity is to lose His divinity, and to become a Jewish Socrates, a wiser Anrehus than Rome know, a larger browed Plato than Greece produced, a philosopher, that is, in peasant garb, and armed with nothing better than a battery of platt times then, alas I it is difficult to see how Christmas, the feast of His bath, can continue to survive, or why anybody should weep over its disappearance Not merely Christmas, indeed, but Christianity itself, may be expected to vanish like a ghost, when its super natural elements have been dissolved into more vapour theologians, however may be safely left to fight their professional battle for the theology of Christmas But the mere student of secular history can hardly fail to see that, whether a miracle does or does not he at the root of Christmas, not one miracle but ten thousand Jmvo somehow blossomed on its stem Somehow that " far off, divine event" has changed the very complexion of secular history It has evolved whole new civilisations It has altered the very balance and equipoise of the world, calling new nations into existence and blotting out old ones As the tides follow the moon so, answering the mj sterious ' pull- to pull ' as of grave station itself-of the Event which Christmas commemorates the whole drift of human history now flows towards freedom and happiness instead of towards slavery and ruin Considered as a mere datointlioalinamc the first Christmas is visibly the pivot round which the history of the world somehow i evolves Every nation to day moves on new lines and is shaped by new forces as a result of the 1 event for which Christmas stands ] very human life, in civilised lands at least, is different from what it would have been if thocluldof a Jewish peasant worn near by two thousand years ago had not been born 'I|icolo0iuis may try to explain that fact, the student of secular history can only wonder at it Over the metaphysics of the Incas nation high I debate may be kindled among piano others it lies beyond (rebate that somehow that event poured new blood into the sunken veins of a dawg civilisation I at even the most ardent and confident of theologians must admit that Christianity, looked at from the secular side, is an unf in Idled prophecy It is more like a s! itch in KOHLER and broken outline on the canvas of history than a finished pit turn The traditional Christmas song began with the note of " peace on earth the What a value on the propriety of that song it is that, as to the passage of nearly two thousand Clnistinascs, the two greatest powers in Christendom are trembling on the verge of was about a strip of South American forest ! The golden peace the first Christmas promised has somehow never yet dawned on the world. There is not a Christian nation in the world which does not spend ten times as much in preparation for war as in educating its children of light on as the burden of its poor The United States Coy on mont the other day launched two " commerce destroyers, the capital cost of which exceeded the whole endowment of Harvard University The canal at Kiel a few months ago was opened with perhaps the most imposing URIE gathering the seas of the world have yet witnessed The canal, intended to serve peaceful commerce, represented an expenditure of about £8,000,000 sterling The locals assembled in its honour, but do signed for purposes of destruction, represented the cost of a dozen canals It is a satire on Christianity, that after the passage of nearly twenty Christian centuries the nations are more fiercely absorbed in preparations for war than in the days when temples were built for the worship of Mary Nothing can be said in excuse for such a state of things except the platitude that great changes must come slowly. A revolution is not perfected in a day. And a revolution which is to transform, not merely the politics, the at, the literature, and the civilisation of the world, but the very nature and temper of man himself, may well con same in its progress, not merely twenty centuries, but twice twenty The dreamers of thirty or forty years ago who had visions of Victoria as a great wine country did not reckon upon wine selling at 6d per gallon To be able to produce June was in their cattle mation to be able to laugh at the world, to be mony at the shocks of fortune And when they do earned of such a happy state the first was by no means unreasonable 01 vam yet today in Victoria, in the country blessed with the capability of producing splendid Mine, there are many growers who are glad to Roll to dis tillones at 6d per gallon There are hundreds, mcleod, who would be glad to be so well placed as to be able to command such a price Snponco a gallon means almost starvation, and when growers cease to make then \ entire pay the vines will be torn up and the land will revert to cereal culture or grazing, either of which gives a minimum of employment, while vine growing moms the use of more labour to the acre than is the rule in any other rural industry It is unnecessary to enter into an analysis of the figures of the situation. The " sixpence per " gallon " fact shows what a condition the vignerons are in and they are close pressed because a considerable area planted under the stimulating bonuses granted at the instance of the Gillies Ministry has just come into bearing, because hundreds of settlers with small holdings, who More induced to plant vines, are now gathering grapes, and not having the necessary capital to build cellars and to buy casks, nor the necessary skill in the treatment of wine so as to make it a marketable commodity, are eager to rush the liquid to the distilleries to be made into spirit In other words, a gross waste of money and labour as proceeding for the want of some means of putting the wine obtained to the best advantage More than that The growers, who were enthusiastic when they embarked in the industry, are rapidly becoming disheartened, and there is danger that unless they are assisted the progress of Victoria as a wine country will be checked for years and years. It is in these circumstances that the proposal of the Ministry to pay three pence per gallon on approved sound wine exported demands favourable consideration It is not a policy to save about nor one to treat with indifference , it has good points and bad points Everything will depend on the practical working of the system, and upon whether or not the Minister is able to prevent the money made available being absorbed by a few rich wine masters who already carry on a good trade with England As has been pointed out in these columns, three hundred thousand gallons are exported yearly and it may be assumed that that quantity represents the absorptive capacity of English buyers If an export bonus of threepence per I gallon be paid, and no appreciable in crease follows, the state will simply pour money into the pockets of gentlemen who are well able to, and do help themselves It is by no means assured that, even if there be an increase, the small growers will receive the benefit of the bonus, but on the contrary it may be expected that the london distributors will gain the benefit Messrs BURGOYNE and Co and Messrs Gunn and Co could not be blamed if they deducted 3d per gallon from the price they offer for Victorian wine They have the right to manage their own businesses as they choose 'The argument, of course, may be pushed too far, but it is well to advance it to show how complex is the situation and how very careful Ministers should be to avoid making the fortunes of the firms which already do most of the trade while the small growers obtain no advantage It is, of course, record nised that every grade of grower must share in the improvement in exports, and even if a few of them were specially well favoured at the outset it would be reasonable from a broad minded standpoint to accept that circumstance graciously always supposing that trade was expanded But with the strongest possible desire to help the interest, we would have the Minister to avoid man and a grave mistake "Mint is Nv wanted is a small growers' policy-a down lopment of the or final idea for gr intend bonuses for planting If instead a few individuals mo entered the industry will receive a severe blow The aim should be to provide means for blending and maturing wine which now goes to the still it is wasted, and if the bonus regulations are so framed as to meet that requirement the scheme will unquestionably confer great benefit The investment of capital in the force tion and equipment of two, or perhaps three, large cellars should be encouraged, and the question was to how that may best be done A p 13 most of 5d per gallon on export would hardly suffice, because a few persons might solid comparatively small parcels and stop exporting when the bonus were withdrawn but if a fixed sum were promised for the ship ment on a given date of a stipulated quantity of good wine, it is likely that lasting benefit would seem to the industry. In September last, when dealing with him topic, we suggested that the most pi i cattle form which any oucoiiin0'oiiiont from the state " could take would be for the " Government to offer a grant of " CLOGG to any syndicate of " capitalists who would undertake " to erect cellars of approved com tine " tion and of such dimensions as would "permit of an output of upwards of " 00,000 gallons of wine annually It " could be arranged that two or more she is collarH might be subsidised in " order to prevent the business bosom " nig tv monopoly. There con" ditions should stipulate the payment " of the bonus pro- rate on every 50,000 " gallons of wine disposed of, provided " it realised a higher average price " than any bulk shipment of not less " than 5,000 gallons previously ex "parted" It would be wise to adopt some such arrangement as that described if the desire is to establish a permanent auxiliary to the industry Contral collars are required to which vignerons may have their wines between the vintages, and if they are provided we should see such a great expansion as would surprise the most pronounced optimist 'Iho vigneron s capital would then, to a very large extent, be employed in increasing the productiveness of his land, whereas now he must sink money in building cellars and buying casks, without even then being able to assure himself that his wife will be marketable Under a system of large depots here and there, there should be a good market, healthy rivalry, and, what is most important, a guarantee that from year to a cat the wine sold would be true to the po There will be no publication of the Aijjm tomorrow The office will be closed till 6 pm but orders had ndvirttsiraents can be left during the tiny at the side entrance J lie K M S Orient arrived at Adelaide shortly after 9 o'clock yesterday) afternoon.
