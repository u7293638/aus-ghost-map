Stables and Co.'s Circular, dated April 7th, we take the following Our tables of exports during the month of March show an increase in the gross amount of shipments to the extent of £01,421. The increase is not very heavy in itself, and is of still less importance when we note how it is divided. The total, to all Parts *' £738,002, against £666,645 in February. Of the increase hereby shown we have £31,860 belonging to Sydney, £9/50 to Adelaide, and £42,652 to Hobart Town and Launceston. Melbourne BUOWS a decrease of £22,515 and considering that we had not a single ship In February for Van Diemen's Land ports, the real increase resolves itself into only that of Sydney and Adelaide, less the decrease noon Melbourne-thus reducing the amount to about J. 18,700. We have commenced, and shall continue to give below our line of totals for the month, the amounts for the corresponding month of the previous year, which will generally be a better guide to the shipper than a mere comparison with what went in the month immediately preceding our present publication. Respecting these quotations of the previous year, we must remind our friends that they will of necessity slightly vary from, those published at that date, on account of the late entries which are constantly passed for Liverpool ships after they have sailed, and are here added to the various quantities originally given. Some idea of the extent to which late entries prevail, and the trouble they entail upon as may be gathered from a comparison of the statements given of the Liverpool ships in our supplementary list for the last Marseilles mail and our present amended report of this day. Melbourne and Geelong-road amount for March is £382,703, against £405,218 in February showing a decrease of £22,515: amount for March, 1859, was £316,G77-showing a decrease In present quotations of £66,126, The comparison with March. 1859, being before our readers in a shape more convenient and. intelligible than any remarks of ours could make it, we shall content ourselves with a few observations. Of piece goods we have very small amount of millinery and haberdashery next to no- thing-apparel very moderate wrought leather the same. Of hardware, bar, pig, and galvanised iron we have large amounts, though of the last not so much as in February. Linseed and rape oils are in reasonable quantities. Railway materials and machinery constitute very heavy items. In spirits we have a material decrease brandy, mm, and geneva being in particularly small amounts. Beers, both in bulk and glass, are rather above those reported in February. In cheese and butter we have a small increase upon last month-of bacon and hams rather less. Ship- ments of oatmeal have been very heavy and we have considerable shipments of salt. Candles, though reversed in the proportion of home-made and foreign, remain nearly as last month. We were misinformed as to the Chrysolite, from Glasgow, having put backleaky, as stated in the supplement of 18th ultimo ; she returned to port in consequence of having lost some spars, but her cargo is uninjured. The Elisabeth Kimball, from Liverpool, will yet be delayed some time before she it likely to proceed. The Star of Peace, 293 tons, which cleared from London on the 29th has gone round to Bristol to load. The Cora, which cleared from Glasgow for Newfoundland and Melbourne, has taken no cargo for Melbourne. Sydney and Moreton Bay-road amounts for March are £227,613, against £195,753 in February, showing an increase of £31,660; the amount for corresponding' month in 1653 was £94,349,-showing an increaseMipon that statement of £133,264. In plain cottons we have a very heavy decrease upon the February shipments. In other woven fabrics we have alas generally a decrease. Millinery and haberdashery are both very moderate ; apparel and wrought leather, however, present a considerable increase. Our remarks last month as to the shut out packages of wrought leather referred to the Centurion, as would be sure ulna, though in the hurry of adding that paragraph late in the day, we afterwards found that we had omitted to state the ship. Our columns for hardware, bar, and galvanised Iron show smaller shipments than in February. Nails nearly as before. Linseed and rape oils are tolerably abundant. Of brandy we have a mere trifle; but a fair supply of rum and Geneva. Wines are not excessive; and beer, both in bulk and glass, is rather over our report for last month the former being; double the quantity reported in March, 1859. In provisions of every description we have very moderate supplies ; of oatmeal none and of Bait only a very reasonable quantity. Candles are slightly above our quotations for February. The shipments of dried fruits have dwindled down to a very small affair. ' Adelaide-Our values for March are £75,034, against £35,67! in February, showing an increase of £9360. The value for corresponding month of 1859 was only £8521,-there not being during that month any clearance from London to report, and only two small ones from our ports. Hobart Town and Launceston We have only one ship for the former and two from the latter place to report, which have been a very long time on the berth, especially considering that we had not one clearance in February. We have papers from Hobart Town to the 21st instant. The Daily Mercury of that date gives the following report of the markets: Not much is doing in the wheat market ; a few sales were made to-day at 9s to 9s 3d, and some holders are asking a higher figure for very prime samples. There is no inquiry for oats to speak of, and quotations are unchanged. Very little is doing in barley, and prices have experienced no alteration. Bay is plentiful and moves off slowly at quotations, loose and country pressed fetching from £6 to £7 per ton, according to quality. Potatoes rallied again to-day, and are quoted at £7 per ton, with an improved inquiry. Flour continues in moderate demand at £23 to £24 per ton, according to quantity, for flour from the best colonial wheat ; is come quarters, however, lower prices are quoted. Bran is 6d to 4s 3d per bushel. - - LORD PALMERSTON IN THE REFRESHMENT Room or THE HOUSE In the Metropolitan Gossip of the Liverpool Albion, we find the following racy passage Having got rid of a disagreeable neighbour, who, on entering the room, had closed the window, and stopped the current of fresh air, Pam coolly rises, and lets in the external atmosphere at the same time ventilating his opinion of the fools some people make of themselves in trying to produce asphyxia by smothering. By this time his own tea is forthcoming and munching a French loaf with teeth - [his own not Cartis rights that would masticate the Atlantic cable, [if they eat his own words what would they not get through ?] he proceeds to absorb the decoction of the weed that cheers but not inebriates. Perhaps it requires milk nobody ever says cream in London, for the rather conclusive reason that there is one and perhaps the milk ewer" b2? absconded, or some- body with it, in no way disconcerted, he doesn't call to the neat-handed Phyllis perambulating the apartment, but takes up his cup and saucer, walks to the end of the room, and turns the tan of the store can just as Cincinnatus, or other Chis Romanes in his own Sabine dairy-farm might do,' only that souchong, swanky, or orange pekoe wasn't exactly in vogue in the days of S.P.Q.H. Well, having put the milk in, he resumes his seat, and presently proceeds to fill out another cup. to, the water runs short ! Opening the lid of the pot he looks in perhaps thinking of Yeh the while and swift as an arrow, meaning a torch, sails over to the fire-place, and from off the hob procures the scalding element, and returns cozily to conclude his meal. Now there's a picture for you, unthought of in Maclise's Spirit of Chivalry, and that would paralyze all the Pre Raphaelities with the mere thought of portraying such a tableau vivant Palmerston with a Britannia metal in one hand, a cambric pocket handkerchief [duty free, of course, in the other, and his mouth full of bread and butter ! Fancy Henry John Temple, Premier of England, Knight of the Garter, cousin of no end of Plnntaganets, Elder Brother of the Trinity, stepfather to Lord Shaftesbury, heir-at-law to Leofric and Lady Govida of Coventry, and guardian of the British lion ; fancy this tremendous puissance, whom foreigners used to call " The Lord Preserve Tis !" [they don't call him that now,] thus walking about a crowded room just as dexterously as if he were a steward on board a Cunard liner, coolly steering among legs and arms, pokers and tongs, waiting-maids, lords of the Treasury, and miscellaneous wild fowl, without spectacles, not the fowl, but the fowler. Ghost of the Black Prince, shade of Hotspur, spirit of Chatham, and oh, body of the living Jenkins ! can this be possible ? Fact ! What will the gents and gentesses throughout the realms of seldom say ? They'll never believe it they can't they won't ; they won't try ; it is too terrible to be true, as the gamblers say in the Young Duke, when they hear that his pigeons grace is actually eating cold pie, off the sideboard, like an ordinary human being, it seeming increditable to the harpies that people of rank could ever experience so vulgar an emotion as hunger, or, if they did, could ever appease it except with something or other at five-pound a mouthful. Consternation has been expressed in some quarters, and unmixed satisfaction in others, at the earnest- ness with which Lord Clyde is carrying out the order regulating the passing of officers for staff appointments in India. The Commander-in-Chief is thoroughly in earnest upon the subject. No officer is to be placed on the staff unless he be duly qualified and the appointment of a young officer upon the personal staff of a general in India has been promptly annulled by Lord Clyde, because the nominee has. failed to prove himself duly qualified. A grand banquet is to be given by the citizens of Edinburgh to the 78th Highlanders, in the Corn Exchange there, on the 24th of April. The Lord Provost is to preside, and Sir John M'Neill, G.C.B.. is to occupy the vice chair. About 500 officers and men of this gallant and renowned regiment will be present. Dr. J. R. Taylor, C.B., Inspector-General of Hospitals, and principal medical officer at Fort Pitt, has been selected by the Government to be chief medical officer of the sanatorium and invalid establishment which is to be formed at the Cape of Good Hope for the wounded and disabled troops from China,
