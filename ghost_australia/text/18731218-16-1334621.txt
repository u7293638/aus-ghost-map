A FINANCIAL CRISIS IN AMERICA. THE ACID FOR A Tuluna of September 20 stated -" Thursday's panic was followed by another financial crisis which culminated in Wall street yesterday the first great sensation of the day was the suspension of the well known banking and exchange firm of Fisk and Hatch This house had been earl) and honorably identified with the negotiations of Government securities and bonds of the Central Pacific Railroad of California, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Heavy advances to the last named road are understood to have occasioned much embarrassment to the house, and the peremptory demands of customers hastened the necessity of eusponBion L itch came the failure of nineteen brokers' firms of more or less note, some of which are old and heavy houses These failures are generally owing to the fact that the brokers involved were carrying at high prices large amounts of stock which had been so evenly depressed in value The suspension of Richard Schell, on Thursday, caused a continued run on the Union Trust Company, of which institution he is vice president the company met all demands up to the close of business The fourth National Bank fell under suspicion on account of its supposed close connection with the firm of George Opdyko and Co This firm has been involved with the affairs of the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad, now in the hands of a receiver ' Morning opened feverishly in Wall street, and men looked at each other with a curious sort of suspicion as if to say, Will you pull through to day ? ' General suspicion settled on the street, and the feeling of distrust affected the stock sales before the opening of the Board Western Union, which had closed at 81 the night before, and now at 75, and fluctuated between that figure and 77 North Western, which had closed at 590, sold down as low as 47, but in small lots, and Rock Island, closing at 98? on Thursday, ran up and down in considerable lots between 94 and 97 Those figures, which only indicated the general tremor of the street, Bignifiod nothing further When the Board formally opened at half-past 10 o'clock, the excitement ran higher Every door of the Stock Exchange was besieged by no eager and curious crowd!, the galleries were jammed with people, and the main floor of the great room was a turbid whirlpool It is never quite as orderly as a prayer meeting, now it was wild Bedlam The panic spread and Western Union sank to 70, 69, 686 Other stocks followed Pacific Mail, which had jauntily closed at 318 in the final rally of Thursday night, Bhd down to 30s Then it sounded a lower depth, and dropped into 30s New York Central, which had sold at 94 and 95 before the call, went down to 92 and a few small lots sold at 91 Harlem Bird, with extraordinary rapidity, from 120 to 95, though the transactions in that stock were light Sales of Dako Shore were heavier, but the prices showed the same downward tendency, opening at 85 and a fraction It ran down to 83, but rallied 2 per cent Wabash alone picked up from its low condition before the soil, and vibrated between 40 and 44 The lame ducks limped about in considerable misery Hartford and Erie were actually quoted at 2, and some other fancy stocks were offered at prices which only evoked a derisive yell from the mob below in the midst of all this the president announced the suspension of Fisk and Hatch, bankers and exchange dealers For a moment there was a pause of silence, then a low wail broke out from 1 bulls and bears alike, The harsh murmur, which was succeeded by a concatenation of yells and cries indescribable, spread into New street in the roar, and Broad street in front Fisk and Hatch had opened in the morning with an expectation of going successfully through the day It was not even suspected that there was any trouble in their house until their suspension was announced About this time early in the day four or five brokers' firms went down in blocks White, Dofroitas, and Rathbone, Boers and Edwards, Fugouo J Jack son, Thomas Rood and Co, and one or two other firms tumbled in about the same time In the Stock Exchange the announcement of those disasters created a ripple of regret, but the interminable ramp and roar went right on, every body being more concerned with what was happening in the board than what come in from the outside These failures were followed by numerous others, until by noon a dozen or so of more or loss consequence had passed in their chocks.' Some hold out manfully, and succumbed only when the pressure grow to be compulsory Haifa dozen hung out, until near to the close of business, and gave up the ghost at last heroically Many brokers were carrying for themselves or their customers huge amounts of stocks which had shrunk in value until their margins were exhausted Oustomori failed to respond, contracts were forfeited, and the brokers, big and little, went down in the crash Eyorybody gaped about to see who would come next The appointment of a receiver for the affairs of the Midland Railroad was followed up yesterday by an application to turn the concern into bankruptcy People thought that George Updykc and Co , finance in agents of the company, ought to fail, and when Fisk and Hatch s troubles were known, they were disappointed that the firm still hold out Distrust of uncertified cheques had grown up during the day, and it was found necessary to put a policeman at the door of the Fourth National, to keep straight the long procession of men flocking in to got their cheques certified, and to see if the money was really there. The bank responded nobly and Opdyko and Co stood the racket The Stock Exchange closed with a decidedly better feeling Stocks still vibrated, and some nominal sales at low prices were made , but most people had come to the conclusion that it was safer to stop buying and selling, and stop they did the closing sales were light, votes of money were only ascertained between the prices of stocks for cash and regular sake ' the worst 16 over ' Bait! everybody " Like all the frequent financial cases in America, this one did not last long, and is probably forgotten by this time in its leading columns, the Tribune says " " The worst of the pan o seems over Aside from the great misfortune of the failure of Fisk and Hatch, following hard upon that of J Cooke and Co. , it has been not at all a oom moreial hut purdy n fancy stock crush Not a mercantile house is affected, not a savings bunk is troubled General business in New York has really been bolter, and there is little of the alum outside of speculative circles But holders of third rate railroad stocks are destined to suffer For many a concern not yet reached, there is, through the approaching winter, a bad outlook Fancy prices have been broken, the public disposition to invest in fancy stocks 13 gone, even meritorious railroad enterprise will be viewed with distrust, and shaky houses inn) expect to spend the rest of the season in diligent under pinning For Messrs Fisk and Hatch, as for J Cooke and Co , there is only the sincerest sympathy They have rendered grout and honest service in the material development of the country Ihoirfoiluro is a public misfortune soon all will hope to be removed One lesson that may be learned without it is, that for years book the New York banks have been keeping on hand 11 very made quite amount of cash in comparison with the nature and amount of their liabilities to depositors Turning to the statements of the New York banks, we find that since 1866 they have never held legal tender notes to the amount of 30. percent of their deposits, while they have usually been before 25. percent, and often under 20, percent Oui maximum has been below the Bank of England's maximum, and of the two steeds, ours is the more difficult to control Now, without further enlarging on lins aug positive topic, is it any wonder that our banks have not worked with case 01 safely, that we so often see money landing in Wall street for i and even 1 per cent for use overnight ? That a degrading, demoralising, and in every way pernicious dependence upon the national tion sury has grown up among us So far from profiting by their troubles of last year, the banks have suffered themselves to be caught with even less reserve than they hold in 1872 Only once during this calendar year has 0 they hold fifty million dollars 111 green backs against debts to depositors payable on demand in gi 0011 backs of more than two hundred millions All summer long their legal tender averages have been allowed to run from five to ten millions below the corresponding figures of last year, while in the dull season, from the first of Bray to the middle of August, they heedlessly expanded their loans twenty million dollars "
