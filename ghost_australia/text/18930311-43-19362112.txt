'• Come, darling, let me take you to your room," he said, for the servant to hear. But tie look in his eyes was not for the man to see. Sibyl stood still, deathly pale, waiting. He went toward her.

He called sharply to the retreating servant, and went toward him in such ex citement that he did hot notice that Sibyl followed him noiselessly, gliding again, behind the window draperies where she had been at first concealed; This window was so situated, that, as she hoped, she was able to hear what Jaaper said to the servant.

Be aaw her. Ue knew that for many reasons it was absolutely necessary that he ahond conciliate her. As he went toward her, he shot stealthy and searching glance* in all directions for Sibyl, but in his flurry and discomposure, never thought ef the window. He went to Belle and put his arm around her. She, fresh from that dreadful inter view with Doctor Varle, with Jasper's own brutal words still echoing,1 iix "her 'ears, shuddered at the caressing gesture and drew back and away from him wjth whiten ing lips. --'-■' t " Well, what is it now i" the demanded, angrily, lifting her gleaming eye*.to hi* •• It's the' devil and all,' sure," he whis pered, with his lips to her ear, "Captain Dunniu'g's here.1-*.
