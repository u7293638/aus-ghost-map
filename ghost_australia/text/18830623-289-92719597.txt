Jftmkg |-ta&i;Â«0i RELIGION IN DAILY LIFE. THE ABBOT JOACHIM. My work is finished ; I am strong In faith, and hope, and charity ; For I have written the things I see. The things that have been and shall be, Conscious of light, nor fearinz wrone- : Because I am in love with Love, And the sole thing I hale ia Hate ; For Hate is death ; and Love is life, A peace, a splendor from above ; And Hate a never-ending strife, A smoke, a blackness from the abyss Where unclean serpents coil and hiss 1 Iiove is the Holy Ghost within ; Hate tbe unpardonable sin ! Who preaches otherwise than this Betrays bis Master with a kiss.
