He could come home on Friday evening. so> Alvira would be at home: and I'd Tie it so tbat ahe'd come into the room. I heard ma calling me then, and I had to go tetn the housr. Af.er I'd gone Bud got thing, mixed, and told the professor to time Saturday evening instead. When Friday night came T jot Alrita to If op by te'ling hei 1 was'mosl sure I heard pa invite one of the Briston boys over. I knew she couldn't prove anything by pa, 'eaose forgets awlnltMd. The professor didn't COM that oigtt, vn* ! ranWn't inntfm wky. 'caw Bud had gone home with Cousin Willie, and Bevrr toldme. Saturday night we was all except pi tired nnt, and went to bed early. I never seen such a'penon pais-he'll sit up till two in the ll morning end read Byron's poems. Our house is prelty big. hot what with bsving so many hired men, we don't hsve much sleeping ro<Mn. Alvira stayed all the week in town, and when sbe catne home Friday night she hsd to sleep 00 a sofa ii. a litlle recessin our parlour. Now onr home aint built like lhe hotises in town : i don't have a front ball, so when you open the frent door you step right into tbe parlour. After everybody wss asleep in the house but pa, there was a knock at the front door. I'a'a a dear, good man, and we just wouldn't Uke anything in the world for him, but he's the awrulest p: rmn to forget! On this occasion ha Torgot all about Alvira. He brought a limp and set it on tbe parlour table, and then opened tbe door. Of course it was tbe professor—what other luck could you expert ? Pa iusiste I on his coming right in, and when be foond out who he was they began to tslk about books. Alvira noon wok, up, and just had to 1ST there with the bright ligfatthining in her face, and tbuse two men sitting quite near her. They couldn't see anything enepther face and head, as the recess was p»itly curtained off, and tbe sofa almost entirely hidden. But her head was is enough: it looked awful. It'a the etyle now to srear your hair crimped; Alvira curia., her abort hsir with a curling iron, hut tbe rnmping she dee, on big hairpins, which stick out every way and made hrr head look real funny. By this time ma aod I was up and trying to aave her; we could see ber through the crsck of the door, ber cheeks like fire.. She waa ao angiy with " pa that 1 just etpecled to we her fly at him; and there pa aat, gently stroking his whiakeni end smiling, .tbe very personiBcation of goodwill to ram. Ma atood bade in the altting-room, where the profotsor couMnt see her, and made frantic motions to catch his eye; and when at tsst she succeeded what did the dear old pa do'? Instead of taking the hint and excusing timSelf he just alopped abruptly what he was saying, and turning upon ma 'a beaming smile tned he what she wanted Of oourtbma had Id go into ttieparlour then jand tdl^a to bring his company out into the sittin|-rioom. There Waa a emile around the profewora enouita&e; ell the mst of the evening, and hr looked at mn onoe and srinked. i.ra liked him rery much, andbeaat and talked till 11 o'clock. He told pi he ought to eeoii «e t« the town school,'cauie 1 nil bright one. , He came to our house lots of time, after tha snd as coon -as Alvira was through school he manned ber; tail myj y<m .never could make ALviral^lievefiuii and ! made thai rektrh;she Ihinka the proTeaaor fell in lore witb lier.
