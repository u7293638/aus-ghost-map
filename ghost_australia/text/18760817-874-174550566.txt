Enigma- THERE is a pretty lady keeps my company day and night, And though we are not wedded, she is spotless as the light : The impress of a noble house her Grecian face retains— The roses bloom upon her cheeks, the blue blood's in her veins ; I know her words arc wise and kind, tlio' I never heard her speak— Her boots are small, her instep high—though I never saw her feet. Is it goblin, ghost, old torn, or gin I've got upon the brain ? Or Poet Foe's old Raven to appal us once again 1 One moment to explain it concede to mc, I pray— "lis a tiny little Photo by an artist surnamed Kay."
