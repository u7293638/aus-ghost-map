SECOND DAY.-THURSDAY, FEB. 7. There was again a very good attendance, although the weather was the reverse ol inviting. A hot sun beamed overhead, and a high wind sent the dust flying in all direc tions. The afternoon's programme was in creased to half a dozen itemB, the whole ol which were disposed of between 1 and a quarter-past 5 o'clock, when the meeting, which had been a success throughout, came to a conclusion. The first item was the Flying Handicap, for which there were nine starters, with Chloris as favourite at 6 to 4, and Lenore next in demand at 5 to 2. The sprint proved a very easy affair for the pony, as she got off with the lead and never was caught. Chloris swerved clean across the course a few yards from home. After passing the post Ace came into collision with another horse, and his boy suffered a nasty shaking. An objection was lodged against the winner on the ground of an irregularity in weighing in, but the stewards declined to interfere. The next event had a spice of novelty about it, it being a race for polo ponies, ridden by mem bers of the Ararat Polo Club. The prize was a handsome silver cup, given by Mr. E. H. Austin, of Gorrinn. The whole of the seven coloured sported silk, Clytie de claring 2|lb. over the list., and Peter 71b. The favourite was Prattle, now the property of Mr. Robert Chirnside, and well known on the Melbourne suburban courses, who was backed against the field at 2 to L Nothing else had the ghost of a show with her, for she obtained the best of the start and won in a canter. Mr. Chirnside wore his new colours, viz., the cerise and French grey of the Duke of Hamilton on the English turf. After luncheon the Hurdle Race came on for decision with a total of nine starters. Nothing else than Sundowner and Fusilier -were backed, the Geelong winner having the call with so favourable a weight The affair proved a very good thing for Mr. Wilson's gelding, for he was admirably ridden by Carey, and defeated Sheelah by a head on the post after a capital finish. The Publicans' Parse was reduced to half a dozen, and as The Marchioness had to put UD a penalty of 101b. for her Cup victory, Barley Bree went out the favourite at even money, Suwarrow and the mare being equal at 3 to L The extra weight proved no bar whatever to Mr. Wallace's mare, who is just now in a winning vein, for she won in a canter, and the favourite finished a bad third. Poor old Suwarrow broke down, and will not be seen again on a racecourse. Barley Bree was sub sequently sold to Mr. J. B. Gill for £70. Seven Corinthians saddled up for the Welter Handicap, which was won by Captain Marryat, a useful colt, steered by Mr. J. 0. Inglis, who had a merry tussle of it with Moses, who came with a final rush almost on the post The rider of the winner, as also of the Polo Pony Race, received a valuable scarf pin presented by Messrs. W. Drummond and Co. The meeting was brought to a conclusion with a Selling Race, which was won by Shooting Star, another of the well-known veteran Hamilton sports man's successful team, who was afterwards sold to Mr. R. Howie for £40. The following are the concluding results: FLYING HANDICAP, Of 30 GOTO., with a sweepstakes of 2 SOTS, added. Half a mile. Mr. J.
