IMPORT MARKET. Heavier sales were reported to-day in one or two deep fitments, business generally, however, continu- ing quiet. Christrose requirements were chiefly in request. No very material changes in prices occurred locally. From abroad a rise of f s per ton on canary seed, a slight easing in common teas in Colomb], a firming in caustic soda and heavy alkalis generally, and sustained markets for cream of tartar and tartaric acid were advised by cable from their respective centres of supply. Buyers of new dates are finding, as importers of kerosene found before them, that buying ahead without having any certainty as to delivery is not always a wise proceeding, to a rising market alone can it be tolerated. Kerosene continued flat-unaccountably flat, holders think, seeing the strength of the statistical! position, Cornsacks sold freely in small lot. at late rates. Tea Privately there was little or nothing doing. At auction business was not briskly done. The steady decline in low-grade teas in Gul Soho and Calcutta appears to have unfavourably affected the market, With the fall in prices. however, there has when an even greater reduction in quality in the chief produc- ing contains. some of the news now coming down from these places are far from desirable. Pine leaf is well holding its own. Cables from Colombo advise an irregular market, with a further falling off in quality. In Foochow there are 60,000 half-chests of tea against not one-tenth of that quantity held on this date last year. However, the whole consists of such low-grade leaf that was unfit for the Australian market. Though apparently ecstatically drank, therefore, the position in China is actually strong. Messrs. Fraser, Uther, and Co offered at the City Mart to-day, under instructions from Messrs Par- bury. Henty, and Co., Fraser, Ramsay, and Co., Cowlishaw Brothers, and R. T. Remington, 3797 packages of China that, 367 Ceylon's, and 499 Indians. The trade was well represented, but was generally unresponsive, especially when Foochow teas were offered them. A fair clearance of Indians and Ceylons was made, considering the magnitude of the catalogue and the general quietness of the market. Actual sales were as follows Chinas : Pauyongs, 251 package at 4d to old ; 413 scented orange pekoe, Cjil to 7d and HO scented capers, (and.
