O, Ye Tiers! (of the Theatre Royal). ( Dedicated to Mrs. and Mr. Williamson.) 0, ye tiers ! 0, ye tiers ! Once more swarming high and low, What a welcome sight ye offer, Brimming, brimming every row. The Sydney public's waking, And the dauy box list s full, And the stalls are overflowing, Though the times they say are dull. 0, ye tiers ! silver tiers ! 0, ye tiers ! 0, ye tiers ! We are thankful for the crowd, Pouring in from far and near â€” Of such houses we are proud ; For the "ghost" can't walk on Mondays When the Treasury's short of tin, And to pull dejected faces " Stars" and " Stock" will both begin. 0, ye tiers ! golden tiers ! There is joy behind the curtain, There is gladness in our dance, And we hope to make a fortune, Playing Pirates of Penzance ; Ye restore us to the biz'ness And receipts of long ago ; 0, ye tiers ! 0, crowded tiers ! We would always have ye so. 0, ye tiers ! Paying tiers !
