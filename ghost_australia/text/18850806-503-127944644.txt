[?] Caldwell at Springfield. HiihG'S'tlifl'spot. Look around you; Abbvoion the height Lay tho HeaaiAnsoncamped. By tha ohuroh on-tharight Stood 'tlio onnnt Jdrsnv farmers. And hero ran ! . o'wnll— You may dig any whero nnd you will turn up a ball. Nothing moro. Grasses spring, waters run, flowera blow Pretty much as thoy did ninety-tlireo years ago. Nothing moro did I say ? Stay ono moment ; you've hetrrfi Ot Caldwell, tho parson who onco proashed £ho word Dawn nt Springfield.? What I No? Come, that's bad, Why ho hod All the Jerseys aflame. And thoy gavo him tho name Of tho ' rebol high priest.' Ho Btuok in their gorge, For ho lovod tho Lord God — and ho hated King Georgo 1 Ho had cnnBo, yon might say, when tho Hes Blana that day Marched up with Knypbauaen, they stopped on their way At tho ' Farms, ' whero his wife, with n ohild in her arms, Sat alone in the house. How it happened nono know But God— nnd one of tho hireling crew Who fired the shot. Enoujh I There sho lay, And Caldwell, tha ohaplain, her husband, away ! Did ho preach — did he pray ? Think of him, as you stand By the old church to-day ; think of him and that band Of military cowboys 1 Seo tho smoke and the heat Of that reokloss advanea— of that struggling retreat 1 Keep tho ghost of that wifo foully slain in your view — And what could you — what ahould you, what would you do ? Why, just what he did ! They were left iu tha lurch, For want of moro wadding. Ho ran to tho church, Broke the door, stripped the pews, and dashed out in the road With his arms full of hymn-books nnd throw down his load At their feet 1 Then nbovo nil tha shouting nnd shots Rang bis vqico : ' Pat Watts into 'em, boys ; give 'em Watt3.' And they did. ' That is all. Grasses spring, flowera blow, Pretty much as they did ninety- tlireo years ago: Yon moy dig anywhere and you'll tarn np a ball, Bat -not always a hero like this— and that's all. Bret Haute.
