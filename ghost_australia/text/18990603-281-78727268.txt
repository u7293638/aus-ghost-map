FARMERS AND WORKMEN. JUST READ.THIS! A Few Federal Facts to be Pondered Over. The Iron Industry will Employ 780.000 Men. LISTEN to what Mr W. G. M. Foote M.E., says :—" As l am constantly being asked what effect Federation would have on the iron industry of this colony, and also assured that somo statement on this point would assist tlio cause of union, and ns it is impossible to supply every inquirer with tho necessary information as fully as could bo wished, I beg that you will allow mc to placo tho follow ing boforo the public in your columns in tho interests of Australain Federa tion. From tho " New Sonth Wales Statistical Register of 1897," The latest edition before mo at the timo of writing, it appear? that we imported into this colony duriug tiiat year £1,413,033 worth or iron and steel in various form?, which might have been, aud could be, mado horo. In this total I have not concluded thoso things which it would be difficult or impossible to produce locally, nor tin plates and tinware. This total repro- Bonts 105.G55 tons, and I may explain that in the case of imported machinery, os the weight is not given, but only the numbor of " packages," I have arrived at my tonnage under this head by assessing its value nt the very moderate figure of £50 por ton. If that 108,658 tons was the result of a local manufacture, certainly not less than 115,000 tons of pig iron would be required as tho necessary raw material. I have been careful through out theso estimates to under-estimate, aa to avoid the danger of exaggera tion. To produce this quantity of pig iron four blast furnaces, equal to an output of 553 tons each per week, would be required. Now as to further details. To run these four furnaces certainly not less than 200 hands would be needed. And then when the pig iron went on its way towards the finished iron and steel stago it must pass through the hands of furnace, forge, converter, and mill, men, etc.; and the number of these cannot be stated at less than 1000\. And there is also the question of providing the raw materials necessary to produce the pig iron, which calls for the services of colliers, iron-ore miners, and limestone quarrymen, and, if steel is required, of manganese-ore miners also. The hands required in this way would number at the very least 500.- This gives a total so far of 1700 hands, and that on- the lowest possible calculation. On leaving tho mills and forges the metal passes into the hands of the various trades who use it as their raw material—viz , engineers, boilermakers, smiths, etc.; a considerable per centage also going direct from the blast furnaces iv the shape of " pig "to ironfounders. For every man employed in the actual production of the metal in convenient and usable forms, at least 20 are employed in subsequently shaping aud adapting it for industrial and com mercial purposes, so that the original 1700 must now be multiplied by 20, giving a total under this head of 81,000, or 85,700 in all. There is another aspect of the question which is often overlooked, and that is, (1) the dependents on hands employed, and (2) the number of those who supply their daily wants. As to the first, we may assume, at tho lowest average, that each of the 85,700 may he credited with a depend ency of two (wife and child), so that 85,700 multiplied by 8 gives us 107,100 on this account. As to the second, it is generally calculated that for every one employed in the iron trades five others aro engaged to supply his daily wants and the requirements of his household. Therefore, we must now multiply 85,700 by 5, and then we shall find that 178,500 has to be added to the already big sum. And I might even go further and show that each of those livo suppliers should bo also credited with family dependents and suppliers ; but I think it will sufficiently demonstrate tho great importance of the industry if the figures remain without further addition, and are tabulated thus:— Blast furnaces, mills, forgos, etc., and minos... ... 1j.700 Finishing trade? . 34,000 35,700 Family dependents on 35,700. at 2 per head 71,400 Suppliers of wants to 35,700 at 5 per head 178,5,00 294,000 Total " .... ... 285,600 At present I have not the latest statistics of all tho colonies ready lo hand. Actual reference to them would show the Australian iron and steel market to be worth between £4,00,000 and £5,000,000 a year, but the Now South Wales figures quoted give an average of I' 7 cwt por hoad in weight of pig iron, and a valuo of £1 Is Cd per head for the trado, on tho populatiou return of Dccembor 31st, 1898\. Applying these averages to the other colonies ou the same population data (Decombor 31st, 1898) the result is as follows -.— -.-. . . Pig Iron, Tons. 99,916 Quoenaland ... 42,375 South Australia ... 31,263 Tasmania ... ..'. 15,074 Western Australia 14,291 202,910 And tho value of the iron and stool trade of theso five State?, on tho same basis of calculation, would be :— Victoria £1,235,733 Queensland ... 535,923 South Australia 395,385 Tasmania ... 190,640 W. Australia ... 180,739 £2,538,420 No doubt those figures, showing the numbor of persons who would be sup ported by the industry if this colony supplied only her own market, may seem enormous and surprising, but a still greater surprise is to follow, for a simple proportion sum will show that if to produce 115,000 tons benefits 285,000 pcoplo, to produce 202,919 tons will benefit 503,915. Theso stu pendous figures aro not the result of any flight of fancy, but of careful cal culations, guided by an intimate and thorough knowledge of tho subject dealt with, and guarded by a firm de termination to avoid anything ap proaching over-estimation. In order that tho importance of the matter may be quite clearly understood, I will place the totals thus : — Persons. If N.S.W. supplied her own market only 285,600 If N.S.W. supplied the other five States also, then in addition 503,946 Total ~. ... 789,542 Now it enly remains for mc to point out two plain facts, and to recominond my fellow-citizens to give them full consideration before going to the polls ou June 20, viz,: —1. That New South Wales is known and acknowledged by every trustworthy man having expert knowledge of the subject to be the only one of tho six Australian colonies in which it would bo possible to successfully carry on the business of making iron and stoel from local raw materials. 2. That the establishment of this business absolutely depends on the acceptance or rejection of Federation, and that the people of New South Wales may look at the matter in this plain, blunt way—no Federation, no iron industry. I may also point out in conclusion, that in addition to supplying the Aus tralian market, there ib a large export trade iv iron and steel to China, Japan. India, South America, etc., of which New South Wales could secure a very considerable slice, probably equalling in value and extent the whole of her demands. There is not the least reason to doubt that New South Wales will be to Federated Australia what tho Stato of Pennsylvania has always been to the "United State?, the centre of industrial prosperity and progress. To Bocure bucli a desirable end is worth many sacrifices ; and evon if tho people of this colony had to pay the fanciful amounts of taxar tion somo of the opponents of Federa tion try to scare them with, thinking they are children to bo frightened with ghosts, it would pay them to do so. Pay them ? Yes ! Even if Federation cost them £5 a head in extra taxation, instead of 3s Gd or less.
