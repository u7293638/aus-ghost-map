even now sells at 50 per cent, premium. The new machine is called the graphophone, and answers every purpose of a shorthand amanuensis. You talk into a tube as fast as you please, and then the machine dictates it back at any rate you choose to fix the clockwork at. Edison's rights were recog nised by an offer cf a quarter of a million of dollars, but this was refused, and so the pirates coolly went ahead without his sanction. Edison has hastily re- arranged his old invention, and the two machines will be put on the market within less than 10 days. Then each side will enter caveats against the other, and there will be a tedious legal struggle, lasting pro bably over the greater part of the five years during which Edison's original patent yet holds good. Edison's dominant dream for the moment is a pyro-magnetic machine â€” designed to get electricity directly from coal, without the leakage in evitable from the intervention of steam. There would be a saving in this of four-fifths of the energy of the coal, and a steamer burning 125 tons of coal a day could get the same work done with 25 tons. Australians who may have seen Edison as he was a few years ago, as thin as a fence rail and pale as a ghost, would now scarcely recognize him, for he weighs 190 pounds and is plump and rosy faced."
