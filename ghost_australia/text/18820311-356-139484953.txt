THE NEWMARXEP HANDICAr. MELnoUnNa, Friday, ree'd. 10 p~m.-A good deal of excitement took place in the betting market to-day about to-morrow's evenhti, and especially the Newmarket Handicap. Several horses have very strong parties behind them. Hesperian is now v first favourite, and this white.legged choesnut's best price is 100to 14. The Ghost has a goreat many warm friends at 100 to 12; :this stable formerly fancied'Cromorne. The next on the hit are Anuroola, Larpent, Surrey, Venture, Tyropean, and Sir Joseph, at 100 to 7; then comes Biathurst,'Tumult, and Vordure, at 100's to 5. The race is an exceptionally open one, in consequence of there being so many known fast nags, in several of whom are reputed flyers, thus making the attempt to ehgose the winner out of a six furlong flutter some thing like searching for a needle in the proverbialbundlo of straw. Asl Hesperian, The Ghost, and Aureola Fare all three very fractious animals, I con sider them dangerous cattle to invest upon, and prefer good-tempered horses like Sir Josph1, Bathurst, Surrey, Baron Vou Mueller, and Tumult. I will not attempt to "spot" the winner, but just give your readers my views, as a\bove, and lot them please themselves. I was unfortunate in my cup selection in going straightfor SAUNTEmrem, but maintain that if lhe could have got out of the ruck he would have won. In mentioning I'oLaIo and SwvEar WILIAmr, I was successful in naming two placed horses.
