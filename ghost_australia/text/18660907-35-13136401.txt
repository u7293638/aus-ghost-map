SOME EFFECTS OF INTEMPERANCE ON THE BRAIN. BY A MEDICAL MAN THE ordinary evil effects of intemperance are so well known and generally admitted that it would be waste of time to treat of them here in this paper I shall therefore confine myself to pointing out, in a psychological point of view, how terrible occasionally are its results on the mind Dipsomunia, or drinking madness, is about the most distressing phase of insanity that can afflict humanity The sufferer is not only aware of the approach of the attack, but has sufficient reason to wish to avoid it He is conscious that he is about to commit actions of the most degrading and ruffianly description, and that during the terrible paroxysm he will be deprived of all self control He knows perfectly well that by abstaining from drink he can avoid the catastrophe with which he is threatened, and yet he is utterly incapable of resisting the temptation, even while he has sufficient good sense to abhor is in some respects the disease is more marked in women than in men, and, disgusting as in the habit of excessive drinking, they are occasionally much to be pitied when it arrives at that degree of intensity which precludes the possibility of their breaking off the habit Few women who have ever been accustomed to a respectable position in society acquire the habit of drinking from a love of the TICO itself The principal cause which induces them to contract it is sorrow Another cause, though in a far less degree, originates in the habit of certain medical men frequently administering alcohol as medicine My opinion on the former point received a full corobora Don from a remark made to me by the late Mr Gilbert Abbott A'Beckett magistrate at the South wark Police Court -' For sometime after I was appointed to that court, ' he said, " nothing passed me more than the language made use of by irreclaimable female drunkards when in the state of sobriety When under the effects of intoxication, language of the foulest description seemed perfectly natural to them, but as soon as the effect of the spirits had gone off, and the were penitent, their grammar was good, their language admirably chosen, and their general tone of thinking appeared to be irreproachable After frequent inquiries, however, I found that most of those women had formerly occupied a decent position in society , but sorrow, occasioned possibly by their own improper behaviour, had induced them to apply to drink for consolation, and the effects were that the natural habits of the woman when in a state of intoxication became completely reversed, and the language and behaviour, which were then habitual to her, were utterly repugnant to her feelings when sober ' s proofs of the difficulty a reclaimed drunkard has in avoiding the temptation of drink, even when feeling the strongest desire to do so, the two following cases may be considered as in point - A gentleman connected with the City Mission about two years since gave a lecture on temperance at the Portland Hall, in the Edgeware Road When he had finished his lecture and was about to leave the room, he noticed one of his audience-a tall powerful, Soldier looking man, between forty and fifty years of age veying him attentively Mr S , the missionary, immediately stopped, thinking the man perhaps wished to speak with him for some moments the man appeared to hesitate, but at last, when no one was near them, he advanced to the lecturer and said, " I hope, sir, you will not be offended at the liberty I am about to take, but I want you to do me a very great favour I am an army pensioner, and married to as good a wife as ever man had but some years ago, when my legs ment was in India, I foolishly took to drinking, and I also suffered from the sun stroke I was very ill in consequence, and was confined to the hospital for some time "When I arrived in England I determined to become a sober man, and took the pledge For some time I kept it very well, flattering myself that I had completely broken through the habit of drinking The first day, however, I had to receive my pension, I found I had made a mistake, for I met some old comrades, who invited me to a public house, and, not liking to refuse, I went with them, and the result was that I came home to my children far more like a mad man than a drunkard Well I determined this should never occur again, and that nothing for the future should induce me to enter a public house I faithfully kept my word till my next pension was due, and then, as I left my house in the morning to fetch it, my wife said to me, ' Take care, John dear and do not be tempted to enter a public-house You are as good a husband as ever lived, when you are sober, but since your illness, you know your brain cannot stand drink ' I promised her I would not, and was returning home with my money safe enough in my pocket, having taken care to avoid meeting with any of my old comrades, when I found that to pass a public- house with my pension was impossible 1 gave way to the temptation and entered one, resolving at the same time that I would only take one glass, but that one glass brought the desire for another, and the result was, that I became mad drunk, and every shilling of the pension I had received I either spent or was robbed of before I returned home Nor did it end there My wife received me without any anger or provocative remark, but simply asked me to go to bed, saying, I should be better the next day Somehow I took this as an affront, and it ended in my brutally assaulting her. The next day, of course, I begged my wife's pardon, and although she had suffered greatly, she readily forgave me From that time until my next pension was due I was never once intoxicated, although I frequently had money about me, and, singularly enough, it is only when I have my pension money in my pocket that this temptation comes over me Now, it will be due to-morrow, and if you will go with me to receive it I will place it in your hands the moment it is paid, and we will return home together, and you shall give it to my wife If you do not, I know it will end as before, for when the ht comes on I cannot help it " Mr S-met him the next day as he requested, and as soon as the pensioner had received the money he placed it in his hands, and they returned together to the man's lodgings The poor woman expressed herself most grateful to Mr S-for the trouble he had taken, and spoke of her husband in the highest terms, stating that he was as good a man as ever lived when sober, and that the temptation to drink never came over him unless he had his pension money in his pocket The next time the money was due, Mr S-agam met him, and the whole passed off in the same satisfactory manner On the third occasion, however, Mr S- was unfortunately absent from London, and the pensioner went alone for his money, and returned home in the evening brutally intOMcated, and raving like a madman His wife, seeing the condition he was in attempted to persuade him to go to bed and sleep it off This irritated him to such an extent that, taking the kettle of boiling water from the fire, he threw it at his wife who held an her arms a fine little boy of about eighteen months old to whom the unhappy man was himself tenderly attached Both mother and child were frightfully scalded, and had to be taken to the hospital, and the drunkard was placed in the hands of the police. The poor woman and her child remained for sometime hanging between life and death, at last both for turntely recovered, but the infant was disfigured for life The husband was committed for trial, found guilty, and senten- ed to twelve months' imprisonment with hard labour He did not, however work out the whole time of his punishment, for sorrow and remorse for his conduct, and the treatment his daring" , child had received at his own hands, added to the effect that solitary confinement frequently exercises on the mind, brought on lunacy, and the poor fellow is now an inmate of a convict lunatic asylum The other case I shall mention is that of a woman, and is singular in proving how strong occasionally the spirit of integrity maybe in the poor creature who has fallen a victim to the vice of drinking A lady of my acquaintance was in want of a nurse for her children, and on looking down the list of all enlistments in the Times newspaper, her eye was arrested by one which seemed to point to a person of a most eligible description. It was that of a woman, forty years of age, with five years' excellent character from her Last plate The advertisement-was answered, and the applicant made her appearance She was a stout, handsome woman, very respectably dressed, and with a remarkably good-natured expression of countenance The lady with whom she had last lived, unfortunately resided at Abergavenny, but the woman said she had no doubt all questions put to her would be answered The address was taken, and the letter written for the woman's character The answer was of the most satisfactory description , indeed one or two expressions in it were of BO laudatory a description, that suspicion might naturally have been aroused as to their bring genuine The lady, however, was satisfied , but not so her husband, and although the woman was engaged, he determined to make inquiries on the subject A friend, who was going into Wales, promised he would do so for him. The character, as the husband had expected, turned out to be a false one, and the person who had given it, although of most honest and sober reputation, was the wife of a journeyman carpenter there was every reason to suspect she was the nurse's sister With this letter in his hand the husband confronted the woman "Well, sir," she said, "I acknowledge that the character was not a genuine one, still listed for five years in the family of Mr., and if you like to make inquiries there, you will find that what I shall now tell you is correct I left the family to be married to the coachman, who treated me so badly, that one day, to console myself, I drank till I became intoxicated, and both my husband and myself were immediately dismissed " The gentleman wrote to Sir-, who, in reply, informed him that the woman's statement was substantially correct, but that both she and her husband (from whom she was now separated) had been seen several times intoxicated It was true that she had been five years in his service, and he had since heard that she had been reclaimed, and was now a very sober woman All this was satisfactory, so far as it went, and the woman was allowed to remain, and a better servant never entered a house At last, when her first quarter's wages were due, she requested to be allowed a days holiday, stating that she wished to redeem Borne of her things, which were in pawn Permission was, of course, given her, and she left about elet en o'clock in the day, with the strict injunction to return before ten in the evening But ten o'clock came, eleven, and then midnight, and still the woman did not make her appearance, and after waiting for some time longer, the family went to bed, giving up all thought of her return About noon the next day she came back, stupidly drunk and her clothes covered with mud As it was impossible to reason with her in that stole, she was allowed to stagger up stairs to bed, her mistress determining she should leave the house as soon as she was sufficiently recovered In the evening the poor woman descended to her mistress in almost penitent mood, and implored to be forgiven She said she remembered taking her things out of pawn, and feeling fatigued she had gone into a public house, but from that moment she remembered nothing, and what had become of her clothes she knew not She promised faithfully that when her wages again became due, she would leave them with her mistress to mt est for her in the savings bank, adding, "As long as I have no money of my own, ma'am, I feel no temptation to go into a public-house but if I have, I cannot resist entering one " The woman was forgiven and another three months passed over without a single fault being found with her As she had promised, she left her wages in the hands of her mistress, who invested them for her in theBBVings Vnnk three more months passed in an equally satisfactory manner, and the morning her wages were due she told her mistress she should like to have one sovereign of the money to purchase a pair of boots " Take care what you are about,' said the lady " Remember what you said, that if you had money in your pocket, you could not keep out of the public house ' ""Vert true, ma'am, was the reply, ''but I wanted to ask if you will allow the housemaid to go with me, for then I should be in no danger " Her mistress applauded her prudent resolution, and the housemaid and nurse left the house together It was eleven o'clock at night before they returned home Both were drunk' indignant at such behaviour, her mistress resolved that she should leave the house the next day, and that she would take no excuse She had no difficulty on this occasion, for the next morning the nurse came to her, perfectly penitent, and addressed her in these words " I am not a going to ask you to forgive me this time, as a lady you could not do it No person has tried to break themselves off drinking harder than I have, but it is stronger than I am there is nothing in the world but the workhouse before me, and I may as well go to it at first as at last ' Notwithstanding the terrible influence the drinking mania had over this poor woman, it was inoperative on her naturalintegrit During the whole time he had been in her situation she had not only abstained from using her employers money to purchase spirits, but never on a single occasion had she been known to taste the wine belonging to the family, which was frequently under her care As a proof how strong this temptation may be, even in a strong minded man, the case of Mr may be mentioned He was a member of one of the first families in Scotland, and a youngman of independent fortune He had secretly acquired the use of drinking, and it had taken firm hold upon his constitution before his family succeeded in detecting it. He was naturally of a very gentlemanly and amiable disposition, but when intoxicated he was more like a madman than a sane person, his language and behaviour on these occasions being of the most disgraceful description With a view of curing him of this habit, his friends placed him under the care of a physician residing at South Kensington He had great personal liberty given him, but, at the same time, was watched to see that he did not enter a. public-house, for it was in those establishments that he generally misconducted himself to make security doubly sure, he was never allowed to have money with him when he left home For some time his behaviour was perfectly free proach ible, so much so that at last the physician said to him, " Mr-, it is a most painful thing to me not to allow you to have any money in your pocket when you leave home If you will pledge me your honour as a gentleman that you will not enter a public house, you may have an j sum you wish " "I give you my word of honour, doctor," replied Mr-, " that I will not enter a public-house, and I should feel obliged to you if you will allow me to have ten pounds " The money was given to him. About mid-day he quitted the house, and it was expected he would return home to the family dinner at seven o'clock He did not make his appearance, however, and as he was generally very punctual, his absence caused the doctor considerable uneasiness, and after waiting nearly an hour, the family dined without him During the whole evening Ebsworthy doctor remained in a state of great anxiety, wondering what had become of his patient It was past midnight before he made his appearance, and then with such a changed countenance that it perfectly terrified the doctor Mr S had left in the morning in high spirits and perfect good humour when he returned he was pallid as a ghost, with intense and painful anxiety expressed on his features Before the doctor could ask what had caused his absence, Mr S thrust his hand into his pocket, and taking from it the ten sovereigns which had been given to him in the morning, he threw them on the table saying J " Take back your money, doctor , I will have no- | thing more to do with it, for I never passed such a dreadful day in my life from the time I left home to the present moment, the temptation to enter a public house was so strong on me that several times I stood outside the door of one for half-an hour together, try in g to summon up power to leave it Fortunately, I succeeded, but I will never be placed under the some temptation again, unless you will withdraw from me all restriction I will not, I assure you, enter a public-house if I can restrain myself, but to submit to a rl of the same torture again I will not " Shortly after, the poor fellow became a confirmed lunatic, and had to be placed under confinement the most terrible cases of the eccentric action of the brain caused by the excessive use of alcohol are perhaps those where strong minded men have deter- mined to cure themselves of the vice The tenacious manner which the temptation frequently clings to them, and the fearful struggles the victims make to relieve them selves from its thraldom, have something in them (savouring of the romantic Indeed they are occasionally such as would have formed a strong foundation for those monkish traditions of the Middle Ages, in which men are represented as nating sold themselves to the bend in return for some temporary happiness or success, and the firing of their b again and vainly attempting to withdraw from the contract The most remarkable instance in this respect is the phantom that opposes the wish of the victim to return insobriety, and actually forces him, against all his efforts and will, to continue the habit of drinking, until it ends in his death I will give two or three of these cases, out of many which have been at different times brought under my notice Mr G-, a young Englishman of large fortune tindyast expectations, resided about twenty years since in the city of Melba He was a kindhearted, amiable ; and liberal young fellow, but, unfortunately an incur I able drunkard Hebecameenamouredofayoungltalian lady, of a good but poor family, and he made an offer for her hand Considerable opposition was shown by her family to the match, sold by on account of the intemperate habits of her suitor, and his violent conduct when under the influence of drink , but the young lady herself was so fully persuaded of the sufferings of her power over him to cure him of the soil j, and perhaps puzzled at the prospect of a brilliant match, that at last all opposition was withdrawn and consent was given to the marriage. Among the guests invited wan a certain English physician, who was attached to the suite of a nobleman then travel- ing in Italy He refused the invitation, candidly admitting as his reason that he considered the poor girl was about to be consigned to a life of misery, in consequence of the intemperate habits of her future husband After the wedding was over, and his opposition could be of no avail, he became a frequent visitor at the house and a great favourite with both husband and wife For some time Mr Green- ducted himself with great propriety, and his friend, the doctor, on leaving Milan for two months, congratulated him on the improvement of his conduct. On the return of the physician to Milan, he called on Mr G-, who received him with a most sorrowful downcast countenance the doctor inquired the cause of the melancholy, and Mr G frankly admitted that shortly after his departure, the passion for drink had returned, and that in a fit of drunken kindness he had seriously and dangerously assaulted his wife The police had interfered, and the result was that a legal separation had taken place between G-and his wife, and he was threatened with a lengthened imprisonment should he again in any way important or molest her I am very happy to see you again," said Mr G-, " for I am sure you will act as my friend in the matter, and use your influence to effect a reconciliation between myself and my wife " " I am exceedingly sorry to refuse you," replied the doctor, "but at the same time I must positively do so, for I considered better for the welfare of both of you that you should continue separated, otherwise I am certain that in one of your drinking facts you will do her some great injury, if not worse " " I pledge you my word of honour as a gentleman, ' said Mr G-, " that if you will make peace between us, I will never taste a drop of spirits again " "I do not doubt your good intentions, but strong as they may be, your habit of drinking is stronger " " Only try me," said Mr G-, name any time I you like for the experiment, and see if I do not keep my word ' "Well," replied the doctor, "I'm going with his lordship for six weeks, to his villa on Lake Como and when I return, if I find you have kept your word, I will see what I can do in bringing about a reconciliation between you and your wife ' the doctor again left Milan, and returned at the appointed time His first visit was, of course, to his friend Mr G-, whom he found at home, and who appeared delighted to see him Doctor, said he with great glee, "I have faith- fully kept my word, and now you must keep yours I pledged you my word of honour that I would not taste any spirits, and I have not done so since you left, and now, as you promised, you must try your influence on my wife " "U here is she now " " She is in Florence, but will, I understand, return in about a fortnight ' " As soon as she returns," said the doctor, "I will call on her, and see what I can do." 'The conversation then turned on other subjects, when Mr G- inquired of the doctor if he knew Count Hatzfeld, the head of the police "Yes, I know him very well,' said the doctor, "but why do you ask' " " Because I want you to remonstrate with him on his behaviour to me, he has placed a spy on me, who folle, vi same everywhere ' "Are you certain of it"" inquired the doctor "Positively certain, was the reply, wherever I go, I find the fellow watching me I will certainly speak to the Count for you, and this afternoon, if possible, ' said the doctor, Accordingly he called, and found the Count at home, and told him his errand " I assure you,' said the Count, " Mr G-is under a great error, no person has been set to watch him, and beyond the dread that he may again annoy his wife, the police have no anxiety on his account Pray tell him so from me and also ask him to point out any person who annoys him, and I will have him severely punished The doctor communicated the result of this con- v ersation to Mr G 11 hardly believe him," said Mr G-, for no man would dare to offer me the annoyance that fellow does, unless he was certain he was doing it with an pump however, I will watch him carefully, and the next time I see him I will collar him, and hand him over to the police ' For two days nothing further transpired on the subject but on the third evening-a beautiful moon- light night, the doctor was walking home with his friend, when suddenly the latter stopped, and ex- oil lined "Doctor, there he is now now we will catch him, he went into this doorway " The doctor immediately daTed with Mr G into the passage, from which there was no outlet, but there was no person there, and it was very certain no one could have entered it "Mr G-," said the doctor, "you must have been mistaken , you did not see the man " " I saw him as plainly as I see you," he replied, " I have seen him too often to be mistaken " " "What sort of a man is he asked the doctor, beginning to think that Mr G- was suffering under some hallucination. " He is a tall thin man, replied Mr G-, " drcBBca entirely in black He wears three black studs in his shirt, and always carries a glove in his right hand " Always a" inquired the doctor " Yes, always," was the reply The doctor immediately came to the conclusion that Mr G-was suffering under some delusion, and he resolved to trace it to its source A week had yet to elapse before the expected arrival of Mr G's wife in the meantime the doctor began to be considerably alarmed about his friend, so pertinaciously did the phantom pursue him G-stated that night and day he had no peace, and that he could see the man looking through the window blinds at night as he lay in bed his, of course, the doctor knew to be a delusion, but that there might be no mistake in the matter, he requested the officer of a detachment of Austrian troops to allow a sentinel to keep watch round Mr G-a house, and especially to mark if any strangers approached it, and if so, of what description they were The soldier reported that during the first night not a person had attempted to approach the house The doctor then inquired of Mr G whether he had been annoyed the night before " Yes," replied Mr G-, " the fellow was peep Ing through my blinds all night long " The doctor was now fairly puzzled what to do At last Mr G-'s excitement and terror increased to such an extent that the doctor determined on going to Florence to ask his wife to come back, hoping that her presence might, to a certain degree, neutralise the effect the phantom seemed to have upon him Mrs G-1 now perfectly willing to be reconciled to her husband, immediately left florence with the doctor for Milan On their arrival, however, they found that a terrible change had taken place Mr G receiv ing his wife in the most unkind manner, upbraiding her for her conduct in having left him, and threaten- ing her with personal violence if she attempted to approach the house again The doctor had no difficulty in perceiving that Mr G-w as intoxicated at the time, and he inquired of the servants how the change had come over their master, having left him under the resolution to keep sober They told him, in reply, that no sooner had he left Milan, than the phantom never quitted their master night nor day He asserted that it no longer looked through the win- dow blinds, but stood by his bed-side Mr G could support the torture no longer, and one night, in a fit of desperation wearing a sword, he followed the phantom, which fled from room to room the servants, aroused by the noise, went to their masters assistance, and found him, in his night dress, stabbing the clothes on the bed through and through with his sword, calling out that the fellow had hidden himself there, and that he was determined he should annoy him no longer The servants took the sword from his hand, and Mr G-fainted from the effects of his exertion A medical man was immediately sent for, who, noticing the exhausted condition of his patient, ordered him a glass of brandy No sooner had Mr G-tasted the spirits than he exclaimed I I am all right again, the fellow has gone the next day the phantom again made its appearance, and the medical man being sent for ordered a repetition of the glass of brandy, and again the phantom vanished Having now found the means of relieving himself from the terrible persecu- tion which followed him, every time the phantom appeared, Mr G- took a similar quantity of brandy, and it vanished « I His habit of intoxication had now commenced again, and when under the influence of spirits he was a perfect maniac. Frequently, however, when sober, he would implore the doctor to get him reconciled to his wife, for the poor fellow was ardently attached to her. The doctor of course refused, and the police were obliged to interfere. Mr. G-now made another attempt to relinquish his habit of drinking, but it was impossible. the phantom never left him night or day. Its identity was so perfect that he would implore it, in the most piteous accents, to cease the persecution, but without the slightest effect. The phantom stood before him, with its cold, frigid glance, gazing at him with a look almost of indifference on its countenance, and, as usual, always holding its glove in the right hand. A. consultation of medical men was now held, when it was considered that the best thing that could be done for the unhappy man would be to persuade him to leave Italy and reside in some place on the-Con- timent where he could have the benefit of sea-bathing. Boulogne, in France, was chosen as his place of residence, and he went there, the doctor thinking that the change of scene might restore him to sanity. For a short time after his arrival a most beneficial change certainly took place in him, and he recovered both strength of mind and body. A temporary fit of illness having somewhat weakened him, the phantom again made its appearance, nor would it quit him until he again took to drinking. It continued persecuting him night and day, till at last, at thirty-two years of age, the poor fellow fell a victim to a phantom conjured up by the effects of his immoderate drinking. A somewhat similar case occurred in Belgravia during last winter. A gentleman had engaged a butler, whose character for integrity and sobriety for many years had been an excellent one but during the last six months he had not been in a situation, having attempted to start an inn with his savings, but had not been successful. For some time the man's conduct was of a most exemplary description. One night one of the young ladies, in a state of great alarm, entered the bedroom of the governess, and informed her that she had seen a light pass her bedroom door, and had heard a footstep ascending the stairs. The lady thought she had merely been dream- ing, and advised her to go to bed again, and nothing more was said on the matter. The little girl, however, was fully persuaded that she had not been in error, and resolved to watch again the next night, and at the some hour she saw the light pass her room, I and heard the step again ascending the stairs. She I immediately went to the governess, and this time informed her that she was certainly not deceived, and | requested the lady to arise from her bed and judge for herself. The governess immediately arose, and throw- ing a dressing-gown over her, stood at the partially open door, and in a short time she perceived a light descending the stairs, and directly afterwards the butler, carrying a candle in his hand, made his appearance. It was difficult for her to judge whether the man was asleep or awake I his eyes were open, but he seemed in a state of intense alarm, as it under the influence of some terrible dream. He passed her door without noticing it was open, and proceeded to the drawing room, which he entered. The governess, without hesitation, followed him and found him turning over the sofa cushions, and moving the chairs, as if searching for something. "B--," she said, what are you doing there?" "I am looking for them," he replied; " I know they're somewhere here, and this time 111 have them. They shall not escape me now ; I'll put a stop to this once and for all." The governess now called for assistance, and the man was advised to go to bed. On inquiring next morning, it was found that in consequence of the misfortunes he had experienced during the time he was keeping the inn, he had sought consolation from drinking, which he had carried to an immoderate extent. He was, however, resolved to cure himself of it and being a man of strong determination, he felt he had succeeded. No sooner, however, did he enter on his new situation, than the first night, on retiring to rest, two children placed themselves beside his bed and continued staring at him. He was not acquainted with them, and they afforded no clue to connect them with his history. The second and every following night, they again made their appearance ; the poor men feeling the while the certainty that if he took again to drinking they would vanish but he would not succumb to the temptation. Night after night, the same phantoms appeared to him regularly, till he could support the persecution no longer, and he attempted to drive them away, when he was detected by the young lady and the governess. What was the determination of his case, I know not. Doubtless he either became insane or returned to his drinking habits: all I know is, it was found impossible to retain him in his situation. The last case I ah ah mention is even more terrible than either of those already given. A lady called one morning on Dr. F-, a physician who was celebrated for his profound knowledge of diseases connected with the brain, and consulted him about her husband. She informed the doctor, without the least attempt at cone calment, that her husband had formerly been the captain of a ship in the East India Company's service, and that unfortunately he had acquired habits of great intemperance. In consequence of some act which he had committed when intoxicated, and which was little to his credit, he became so disgusted with the degrad- ing exhibition he had made of himself, that he resolved nothing should again tempt him to touch spirits, and he had since adhered strictly to his resolution. He felt the temptation occasionally come over him, however, very strongly ; still he would not yield to it. At last, when there appeared to be every prospect of his becoming a reformed character, his wife noticed he had become very uneasy, as if something was weighing on his mind of which he did not like to inform her. She pressed him upon the point, and he told her that every night he had the same dream. A I little old woman, with a red cloak and red petticoat, appeared to him, and gazed at him intently. Some how he got the idea, that if he again commenced drinking, she would leave him ; but nothing would induce him to alter his resolution. The phantom, at last, exercised so strong an influence upon him, that even during the day-time he had the blood-red colour of the cloak and petticoat she wore continually before his eyes. The lady told the doctor that she was afraid her husband was going out of his mind, and asked him what steps he had better take to prevent it. "I nmsorry to tell.you,"-said the doctor; " the case is a most serious one and if the greatest precautions are not used, it is extremely probable your husband will commit suicide. You must watch him narrowly, and prevent it if possible. My advice to you is, to take him abroad immediately to the south of Italy, or somewhere else so that he may have a total charge of scene and the sooner you go the better." The lady promised to follow the advice of the doctor ; and without informing her husband of her reasons, she earnestly pressed him to take her for a trip into Italy ; adding at the same time, she was sure it would benefit his health as well. He agreed to her request, and preparations were made for their departure. When the day arrived for them to start, and the carriage was at the door to take them to the railway station, he suddenly stopped, and told his wife to waite moment, as he had left something in his bedroom. A. few minutes afterwards she heard the report of a pistol, and on rushing up-stairs, found to her horror that her husband had shot himself. Should the few facts I have mentioned make any impression on the mind of the reader, I sincerely trust he will not be contented without investigating the question further. Let him inquire of any experienced medical man of his acquaintance, whether the facts I have alluded to are not of every day occurrence. For my own part I have but one test of the evil of drinking, either in a greater or less degree and that is of Scripture origin : " Therefore by their fruits shall ye know them." If the mature fruits of a tree produce effects such as I have named, what must be the value and quality of the plant itself ? Good Words.
