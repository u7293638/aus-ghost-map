PORT ELLIOT, May 15. During the last few days some of the resideuts near the Court-House have been very much alarmed by the rumours that a ghost has been seen and felt in the locality, on one occasion by a child, and from the general trutb.iDln.es3 of chil dren it is supposed that his ghostship has really visited Port Elliot, and a strict watch is bÂ«in2 kept that the statement may be confirmed. The residents of Hindmarsh Valley may now congratulate themselves on the probability that they will have a teacher permanently fixed for , them, the Inspector having lately visited the school and expressed himself quite satisfied with the number of children, and the qualifications of the teacher, Mr M. Phillips, who is to attend the Board of Education shortly to pass hii examina tion. Considerable delay through some ofiglecn. has been occasioned by this matter having been so long in abeyance, as tbe schoolmaster was recommended by the District Council and approved by the Board of Education during the latter part oi last year, yei ae nas nut reueiveu a lartmug from the Board, either as stipend or payment fes the destitute children,, of whom tne neighbor hood is very prolific We have lately had some splendid rains ; and the farmers are to be seen ploughing la all direc tions, and although the last harvest was almost a failure they seem nothing daunted, but ate again trying in earnest. It may be observed by advertisement that tenders are called for the improvement? at Victor Harbor, and great things are anticipated for the place in consequence ; in fact, times are now better for the laborers, as enquiries are being made for pick and shovel men for road work. *^ ^ ?
