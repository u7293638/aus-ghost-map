Tnr SMALL BoY To..L e TF.n To?rer.--It is the small boy who uulnllv tells things, and at the dinner table is his favourite theatre. A bright little fellow peered into the dish at the head of the table, and exclaimed, "What a little chicken for so many people !" The com. psny smiled surreptitiousoy, and his mother endeavoured to quiot him. But he was like Banquo's ghost. After they had all been helped and were eating, his face suddenly lit up, and. clapping his hands, he shouted: " Oh, yes, I know now, mamma. This is the little chicken that was ill so long in the yard, ain't it!"
