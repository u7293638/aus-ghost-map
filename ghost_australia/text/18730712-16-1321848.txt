ROCKHAMPTON. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPON.DENT.) July 1. THE strange and unfair orable weather with which we have been lately of were checked for a time all business transactions, and is a consequence, the good people of Rockhampton denounced in no measured terms their disgust at the unseasonable rush of waters I never saw the town look so thoroughly stupid and dull Many of Tyfo's friends stick to him, while a very great many have our of their b Icke on him, and I somehow think that he will not walk over the course so easily as of yore, should be Sport his colors at the starting post As a matter of course, rumor is very busy She is disseminating all manner of nonsense, a very great deal of which is accepted as gospel by the open mouthed sons and daughters of Adam Noinumby, Blackall, and Rockhampton, have, so it is asserted no end of patriots in their borders, ready to sacrifice themselves, their household gods, and their money, for the good of the country Normanby his its Do SILO and Mayoress the latter gentleman who for ward the former hadn't the ghost of a chance Blackall is singularly fortunate, Melbourne, Milford, Livermore, Hunter, M Donald, and £10 nous Tommie Smith are all in the Hold-so SUJB rumor But rumor lies I don't think one of the gentlemen (Jommio included) mentioned has any serious intention of making himself a mark for paper pellets, or has the least desire to represent the newly formed electorate Mr M Donald will I believe, be asked to allow him self to be nominated, but he may, possibly will, refuse If Jommio really puts up he will be returned, because no man with the slightest pretensions to be a gentleman will condescend to oppose him For the town, innumerable have been the names montionod,-innumerable have been the well to do citizens who have declined the honor Messrs Livermore and Hunter have both been warmly proposed, but, like my Lord Fairfax they are too wise to be there, and, for several reasons, they may be congratulated upon their forbearance Their time will come the war between local parties, although still raging, IS nothing like so hot as it was, and a very little calm diplomacy would, I am certain result in peace being proclaimed Mr Milford has also been mentioned by the Bulletin, but why I can't guess, us the learned gentleman shakes his head (and There is a good deal in it to shake) and declares that he has had a surfeit of Parliamentary honors A very large and in financial party would be glad to have Mr Archibald Archer back again, and there are reports abroad that a telegram will be sent to him, requesting him to allow himself to be nominated Xhon we have our old friend and townsman, Mr I\cz, one of our most popular men ha, I fancy, will not allow Eyfo to have it all his own way, but will come forward should he find it necessary to do so. He and Mr Archer are the only two who would stand a chance against Eyfo Mr Walsh has also been named, and though I should be heartily glad to have so good a man for our member, still I think it would be unwise for him to make an attempt, unless a requisition were sent to him signed by at least one half of the electors It is true he has won, and deservedly the confidence of the Northern people ; still Rockhampton ought to have a local representative, and any one coming from below would meet with but a sorry reception from a large number of the electors. Mr Graham IS sure of Clermont, and Gladstone would rather be disfranchised than lose the honor of having the Colonial Secretary for their member. Mr. Scott will be returned for the Leichhardt, and I don't see why Mr Boyds should be ousted It is stated that Mr Fitzgerald will contest a Northern electorate, but which one I have not heard Mr W O Hodgkinson has stated he will stand for the Burke, and his chance is a thoroughly good one, booked as he will be by a large mining community Rockhampton, Blackall, and Normanby will, I think, be hotly contested, not because the political differences are very? marked, but because there is an evident desire of the working classes to push their men in Although business is, as I have stated, dull, still money is changing hands in largish sums. Balnagowan station, the property of the late Mr Ross, has been sold at £1 10s, and Mr. Elliott, of Jaipur, has disposed of his run at 12s 6d Several buyers, both principals and agents, are in town, but they cannot find what they require close at hand, and they will have to go further north or plunge into the interior Stock of every description is far from being plentiful, and prices have, if anything, an upward tendency. informers continue to refuse loading except at advanced rates, which agents with equal per- tinacity decline to pay, us they are pretty sure that in a week or two, on account of the supply of water and grass, which will continue for some time without any further downfall, prices must come down At present there is great difficulty in sending goods up country, both in large and small parcels. Cattle of all descriptions, particularly milch cows, are in good request, and I am pleased to find that there is a desire on the port of small capitalists to take up land for entry and agricultural purposes the Rockhampton Jockey Club have put on a spurt, and their programme is far from being insignificant, more particularly as the races will take place so soon after those held at Alexandra Park, on the Queen's Birthday. A more than usual interest is taken in the matter, and I should not be surprised to see some first class horses at the starting post Several well known lings are now in town and in training, but it is too early yet to say anything about their quota to Brigalow and Loyalty look well A seam of very excellent coal has been lately discovered in the district, but the (Tenders are rather chary of giving information , but if it be really valuable, no shall not be held long in suspense The news that the steam tug Mary had been placed in thorough repair, and that she will shortly be at work on her old ground in the Fitzroy, is received with very much satisfaction by every one connected with the shipping interest. But 1 not inclined to believe that the dredging will do little more than remove existing in pediments, and that some other system came before long be adopted for the purpose of keeping the river clear the expense (consider ing the results obtained of keeping the Mary in full work is enormous, and the money is in reality thrown away But we must be satisfied with what we can get, and was until public none) is more plentiful, or until the Government see fit to utilise the waste lands in order to carry out large public undertakings the most direct and certain way, I conceive of peopling, the country and of introducing the right descriptions of immigrants Upon mining matters I have buthtlloto say ; the ivot M cat her utmost put an entire stop to work. The greater portion of the machinery of the Hector H now on New Zealand Gully and the boiler, which after mischance managed to reach Rockhampton, will be despatched to its now home so soon as the punt um safely cross it What a miser able mistake is being made by our merchants, squatters, tradesmen, and diggers in not pushing the bridge question. They are literally cutting their own throats by their foolish i carelessness about a matter which is of as much consequence to Rockhampton and its districts as the railway or the choice of a Prime Minister The weather is charming , the nights are cool but not cold, and the days are made thoroughly i enjoyable by the bracing mr If, however, frosts set in, anything like those we experienced last year, we shall lose all the grass which is spring- ing, and shrubs, fruit trees, and flowers, forced into premature bud by the rain, will be cut to pieces
