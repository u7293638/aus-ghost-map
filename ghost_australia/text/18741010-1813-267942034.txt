TO THE EDITOR OF TNE ARGUS. Sir,—Your review of the Rev. C. Fetherstonhaugh's sermon, which gave such offence to the worthy dean, was not overlooked by that little body worshipping in the Unitarian Church, Eastern hill, on Sunday last. The fair preacher directed the attention of her hearers to the sermon in question, and referred in glowing terms to the author " as one who bad the moral courage to say what he believed," although she predicted the result would be his severance from tbe church to which he belonged. Probably the lady had an eye to the reverend gentleman one day preaching frem the pulpit now so ably filled by her. By way of practically testing the feelings of her congregation, several copies of the sermon were offered for «sle at the church door in the morning and readily disposed of, and not a copy was to be had in the evening.— Yours. &c..; October 5. [We see above the ill effects of Mr. Fetherstonhaugh's improper example. It must seem strange if these Christians are really in earnest that they do not publish their names as guar- antees of their good faith.— RESERVES.—The following reserves are notified in the Gazette of Wednesday last :— No. 679.

IT is shrewdly observed that sawdust pills would cure a great mwy diseases if the patient would only make his own sawdust. TBB HON. J. G. Francis, we understand, is making arrangements to visit England with Mrs. Francis and;fami!y. Mr. Francis intends proceeding by the direct route, for the sake of the curative effects of the long sea voyage, and probably he will leave by the Renown or the Rodney, to sail about the middle of next month. The intention of the hon. gentleman is to beabsent twelve months, and the hope' will be general that he will return to the colony a new man in one sense, and yet the self-same man in another.—Daily Telegraph. EDUCATION j* VICTORIA.—We are told in the report that the rate per head for children in Victoria is now £3 4s 2d per annum.. It U6ed to be £3*14g. In New South Wales the rate is £3- 8s 9d. In Otago it is £4 6s 6d. All expenditure on the schools is, of course, reckoned in< these amounts, whether derived from grants, . fees,, or taxes.—Daily Telegraph. A GHOST.—From time to time we (Shoalhaven- News) have received startling intelligence from Bauierang anent a ghost, or rather ghosts, that have been seen by many persons, some of whom are persons not likely to be carried away, by idle fancies, Mr. Robert Williams, who has but recently gone to reside at Bamerang, bas been terrified, his faithful wateh- dog driven mad, and his whole household routed and thrown into the greatest consternation by the appearance of an apparaition. On Tuesday night Williams's family were startled- by what seemed to be a man walking. |up and down the verandah with heavy-nailed boots. The dog, who appears to have heard the noise, and it wou'd seem also saw tbe eause of it, was rushing about in a most frantic manner, and would every now and then make a desperate spring at the intruder, but finally gave up the contest in snllen- silence. The ghost, in defianee of ait u focks^ baits,, and bars," entered the house, and Williams then saw the figure of a man, dressed apparently in the garb of a bushman. It went to the beJ where Mr. and Mrs. Williams were lying, and'pulled the bed clotbcs off the bed and lay down beside Williams, who, however, could "feel nothing when he put his hand out to touch it. After a while the apparition went to where there was a crosscut saw standing, which it sounded several times, as if beating time to music. After keeping Williams and his (family in a terrified state for some time, bis gbostship departed. Williams avers that he has heHrd and seen this strange visitor several times since his location at Bamerang, and challenges all nnbelievers to go and stop at his house and judge for themselves. Other persons, as we have before stated, have reported to have seen similar apparitions in the locality, and one gentleman, well-known in this district, who resided at one time at Bamerang, saw, or will 'swear that he saw, a lowset man, with a manilla bat on, dressed in moleskin trousers and a blue guernsey shirt, carrying an axe over his shoulder, enter his bedroom, and when the party referred to attempted to ascertain who he was and what he wanted, found that the supposed man was only a shadow. It is asserted by the very old hands- of the district that one or two sawyers bad been found murdered in the locality many years ago. THE population of the colony on-- the 30tli June last was 797,000.
