THE DEEMING M.UKDERS IN ENGLAND, HOW THEY WERE DISCOVERED A TRTJE DETECTIVE STORY. (Continued.) 1 It was wonderful how readily Mrs I Mather talked. She had had the letting of Dinhamvilla, which belonged to Mrs Hayes, and applicants to view the property had to come to her for the key. Iflr, Williams wished Si take the house, I and when he came for the key he met Emily. He fell very much in love with Emily, and almost at once proposed marriage. The marriage came off in a very short time, and was celebrated by a dance in Dinham villa, in the kitchen, which had been newly cemented. Certainly some of the neighbours had! blamed her for allowing her daughter to marry a man whom no one knew anything about, but he was a free-handed well-spoken man, and he had promised her a good home. They were very happy together, and Emily had written I several letters home since they had left Her last letter was dated from Colombo but her husband had written from Mel bourne. I « Now, Mrs. Mather," said Mr. Lowe, I want to ask you about your daught , r» e " The old lady looked up at him sharply. "I want to know first," she said, " what you are driving at, and I will not say another word until you tell me." " Mrs Mather," said Mr. Lowe, « I have something very painful to say to you. I am going to tell you now about two people, a man and a woman. The man I am positive is Albert Oliver Williams. The woman may be your dau-hter, or it may be the woman who, I have ascertained, came to Rainhill to visit Williams as his sister, but who, I have reason to believe, was his wife. Williams murdered his wife in Melbourne on last Christmas Eve." Almost before he had finished speaking Mrs, Mather had fainted,and it was not without some difficulty that Mr. Lowe and Mrs. Pickering together managed to revive her. Then he told her all that he knew, weaving the tangled scraps of information together into as consistent a whole as possible. But I there were still some terrible gaps to be filled up I « Mind you, I do not believe that it is your daughter who has been murdered," slid Mr. Lowe, arguing against bis own convictions. I think it is very probable that his real wife, who visited him here at Dinham-villa, followed him to Melbourne, and that when she made herself ] known to him there, and reproached him for his desertion/he took her life." It was a plausible hypothesis, and it was of priceless value just then, for it enabled Mrs. Mather to hope. With her hopes her strength revived, and unlocking an old-fashioned secretaire she took out all the letters written by Emily Mather since her marriage, and also portraits of both the bride and bridegroom. After a little persuasion, she handed the letters and portraits to Mr. Lowe, who desired to take them to London and get them copied, receiving in return an assurance that they would be safely guarded and given back uninjured. " Now, you must tell no one what I have told you," said Lowe, aB he took his leave. " It is absolutely necessary that yon preserve the strictest secrecy. And the old lady, terrified and full of vague misgivings, pledged herself to silence. When Mr. Lowe took his seat in the up express for London he had good reason to congratulate himself upon hiB day's work. He had succeeded beyond his most sanguine anticipations, and he had made his position secure by closing the door completely against subsequent inquirers for information. Not only had he extracted a promise of silence from the one living individual capable of giving positive information about the murderer, but he had swept off all the letters and all the portraits as well— that is to say, all the documentary evi dence and all the means of identifica- tion. After rifling the treasure-chamber he had locked the door and left with the key in his pocket. Next morning, The Argus, away on the other side of the globe, published an interview, three-quarters of a column long, with the mother of the hapless Lancashire girl whose remains had been dug up a few days before from the cemented grave in the house at Windsor. It was the first of a series of perhaps the most remarkable coups ever known in the history of Australian journalism. Backwards and forwards between London and Liverpool went the restless Mr Lowe, collecting and piecing together all the ravelled ends of hearsay, all the tangled strands of inference, all the stray fibres of circumstantial and direct evi- dence, until he had made a rope that TO? strong enough to hang a man. And yet he was only at the commencement of blfl task. It was atrange how that other woman the sister or, more probably, the wife of Williams, who had visited him at Bainlull with her four children, kept on intrading into Mr. Lowe's busy brain. She quite upset his calculations. It was odd that, in spite of all his efforts, he could find no trace of her whereabouts. She and her four children were like so many unquiet ghosts that refused to be laid until they were avenged. As this last thought struck him Mr. Lowe lifted his hand to his forehead and found it wet. He was sweating from sheer excitement. A vague dea came to him, stayed with liim, and ; finally possessed him. He hurried from London to Rainhill once more anil hunted out Ben Young, the man who had cemented the floors of t h e kitchen and scullery in Dinhamv l l l a " "^ructions from Williams, n d e r n " , " cement from r e d , d e t t h e B e n f ™ eager question, * w a s e flrafc »" „ w u r m . t h . e c o o c h o u s e .

When the story of the Rainhill murders was published in The Argus alone of all the Melbourne papers next morning Albert Oliver Williams, alias Fred erick Bailey Deeming, was already on his way from Southern Cross in custody. If the Windsor charge broke down, the Rainhill case -would hang him safely enough. Ah ! Mr. Lowe, glad to see you," said Superintendent Shore next day, stretching out his hand cordially to his visitor. " Let me congratulate you upon the smartest piece of detective work that has been done in England for many years." THE END.
