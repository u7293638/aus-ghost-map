They all seemed— young and old — so gay and full of hope in the glad: incomkig of a new yearr while I— what had the year to bring to - me ? What I had saved and gained had waned so low that soon we must leave-the cottage and East Craig, and, go to some great noi&y; city, where employment might . possibly be found The night, as the bairn lay peacefully asleep. in her cot,. I could. not close my eyes through the long hours of the dark n-ss,. but. turned my throbbing head from side' to- side. ' ArcMe, Archie1.; How I sorrowed for the loss of. my man.
