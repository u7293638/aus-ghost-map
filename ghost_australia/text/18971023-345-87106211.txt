[To the Editor of The Herald.] Sir, — During my experience on earth I have seen many strange and (the*) unaccountable things, but the strongest thing upon which to ponder has been reserved for me since my entry into spookdom. I look back to the time when my old material self travelled over that road to Leschenault. brooding thoughts that must have been sensibly felt at the Capel, owing to the knotty intensity thereof; but now from my elevated view I ponder in an imbecile kind of way, wondering -whether the Bunbury Roads Board has turned childish in its old age or whether things are not what they seem ''and that my altered condition is reponsihle for an optical delusion. Can it be possible that the practical old members of the board are consenting parties to loose drift sand being used to fill up the holes and ruts in this road, which is a hard and in places like a metalled road? Never ! It is gravel or clay. I am informed that at the antipodes every thing is upside down and this circumstance accounts for my view of the inverted nature of the method of road making now being adopted by the Bunbury Roads Board. — I am, McADAM'S GHOST.
