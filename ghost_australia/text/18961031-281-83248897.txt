" The White Lady." Consternation has for the past 'two or three weeks possessed the souIs of all the inmates of the Royal Palace at Berlin, for the historical ghost of the Hohenzollerns has once again made her appearance. Her last visit was in 1879, just before little Prince Waldemar's fatal fall from the Palace window; although there are rumours of Countess Anna of Blammede —for such is the lady's name—having visited the Imperial House prior to the deaths of the Emperors William I and Frederick. This time she was seen by our of the Court Chamberlains in the long corridor, rising up, as it were, from the solid-tiled floor. She was clothed in pure white, and wore a wondrously jewelled belt; one hand-rested upon it, the other was upheld in warning. Her face looked ominously severe. This time she came empty -handed ; her usual insignia of office has been a bunch of keys. The Chamberlain, greatly alarmed, imme- diately spread the report, which soon convulsed the entire Palace. The Emperor when told of the affair evinced the utmost composure, inereiv ordering extra guards to be stationed about the grounds, and cautioning the servants to seize any intruder. White Lady or otherwise, whom they found prowling about.
