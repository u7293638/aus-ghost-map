HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES. v J ---??? The usual monthly meeting of this society, held last instit at (he Oddfellows Hall, Elizabeth-street, was largely attended, and the plants and cut flowers were for the ment putt tied Mr W Hemming occupied the chair, and on the table in front of him were displaced an extensive polite turn of Maurliird works on horticulture and bunny, which are to be awarded as prizes at the Spring Exhibition, to be held three weeks hence These volumes wore the gift of his Excellency the Earl of Dilmon, the Major of Sydney (Mr M Chapman), the hon 11 Moore, Esq , M.L.C., Mr. J R Young, Mr H Prince, Mr E Knox, Mr J Ihoinp ec u, Mr W Hemming, At German Kippax Aldermen Pal n r, Alderman Knph ill, Mr J Qrnhini, Mr S Kippax, Mr Moore, and of the society itself Conspicuous among the exhibits were several pot grown specimens of {jCranmiuB and pelargoniums, remarkably well grown and (lowered, a handsome stand of gladioli, comprising double and even double flowers, grown by Mr Saxby a no choicest of roses, from the garden of Mr Maurice, and a fine seedling clematis, shown by Mr R Henderson Mr, Fu i n called the attention of the meeting to the ravages of the insect which is now infesting the Moreton Bay fig trees grown about Sydney, and which threatened their destruction. The insect was very destructive about two years ago, when the matter was brought under the notice of the society The CHAIRMAN said that the insect belonged to the same class as the slug insect which infests the plum trees in GreotBritam.tind it threatened the destruction of all the lies in the colony It stuck to the loaves of the trees Like the excrement of birds, and was dormant in the day time, but as soon as the sun went down, it began to devour the foliage The insects charged into a fly and, after depositing therese, came out in the spring Mr M'Leod said that, at Toxteth Park, he had applied for to the trees affected He put the tar in rings round the stems of the trees and it had the effect of arresting the niournentof the insects up and down the trunk Masses of them were to be seen in the Letts of tar, and to that extent the mischief was lessened li did not open or, from the reports of the speakers, that six remedy was known for the evil We all send the secretary s list of an HITS Mr Goodenough, gardener to Captain Wharton, R N A fine collection of flowering shrubs, prominent among which were fine samples of Cantua dependents, Piiulonia imperials, Stutzer grounds, Bouganullias weights, both of the vanishing and plain leived kinds Also, nineteen varieties of the leading kinds of pelargoniums, and twenty six specimens of roses Mr George Mortimore, gardener to Mr T S Mort BY common plants of double geraniums, Gloire do Nancy, Mndauio deLemoino, Irioinpho do Lorraine, and Captain L lleimite, also, pelargoniums, Rosy Gem, geraniums, Queen of Queens, a fine silver tricolour leaved variety, Madame Youclur, and now an idea, Colons nouveau this r election were truly specimen plants They were dwarf in habit, foliage very perfect, and finely flowered It will not be invidious to mention that they were without doubt the most perfect specimens exhibited Mr Wood-, gardener to Mr Henry Bunce, exhibited a fine specimen plant of Caladium Wight.

Mr Goixb read the following remarks respecting his (visit - 1 this plant, which 1 imported about two years ago, was sent out to me he kies splendens Lebrina, and which, I iv appeals, is its correct one (though I believe it was imported by the Bot rare Gardens 11s " Rumania,' and was labelled as such within a short time back It was first introduced into England by Monsieur Neumann, who sent 11 to Kew from the Jardin des Plantes?, under the name of fillindsia splendens This very showy plant, however, was published by Sir J. W. Hooker as kiosks speewa in the Botanic Magazine in 1848 < Nothing appears to be known of its history except that it was introduced to English gardens from those of the Continent I believe it is as yet somewhat uncommon in collections, though eminently deserving of extensive cultivation Although the flowers of the plant are ephemeral, jet the plant itself contracts for a long time exceedingly ornamental the most showy part-the spike of richly coloured races being very enduring Gradually the bl right scarlet of the lower branches become duller, and even tually greenish, and at last the colour extends over the whole spike The culture of this plant requires peculiar treatment, viz, a season of free growth, a beacon of rest after the growth is matured, and then liberal treatment to compel the production of the flower stem The compost required for its successful growth should i ( sist of his turf loam, fibrous peat, and half decomposed leaf mould in equal proportions with which some gritty find, potsherds, and charcoal, might be intermingled Ueetho composting rough pieces, and potatoes lightly After potting, plunge in bottom heat of SO degrees, and when the plant begins to grow freely, water with weak in pure water once or twice a week This plant will probably require a second shift towards midsummer. If so, use the same compost, and pursue the same treatment, but take care to bring the plant into a state of rest by the end of April 1 through the winter it need only be kept in a warm part of the hot-house, and rather dry at the roots When you wish it to bloom, plunge it at once into a brisk bottom beat, water freely with manure water, and induce vigorous growth After the plant has bloomed, the old part may be cut away, and the suckers, of which several will be produced, may be treated for free growth, as before directed Mr GEORGE DE KHAM read the following paper - THE GARDEN OF ENEMY. Carlyle declared "Speech is silver, but silence is golden ' another form of expressing sur more homely axiom, " a still tongue makes a wise head " Now there are circumstances in which these proverbs may-like many other popular raymge-bo proved inapplicable, but if I had acted on their suggestion I should very probably have escaped this responsibility If I had not been emboldened to state my views on Mr Wolfe's very interesting paper on the "Plan of the Bible," I should have been allowed to rest in wonted retirement but having criticised that paper I could not in common fairness refuse you the opportunity of returning the compliment when requested to do so. Here is my difficulty, I am not a practical man in the sense that you are wholly practical, and to have taken up an ordinary subject would have been to expose my ignorance and impertinence The subject I have chosen is often said to be devoid of interest, except to the curious, the fanciful, and the theologian , but possibly it may serve as a salad to vourcoursoof essentially practical subjects, just as we take up a work of fiction to recreate our minds after hard philosophical study or it may be but the single loaf that is employed as a fell in the bouquet to bring into relief the brighter and apparently mere beautiful specimens of flower culture Who would not have the opportunity of recording his vinwf-imaginative and contemplative of this Divine creation ( Of Eden, which even in its etymology sig make pleasure Those bowers, where employment was delight, and enjoyment the atmosphere which man breathed ItH garden marked with the impress of Deity, and its care made the loving aim of man in his innocence , where man's path was encircled with flowers whoBO leaves and blossoms poured their nob and balmy fragrance upon his pure and sensitive nerves His eyes do lighting to gaze upon the gorgeous amaranth, the elegant palm, the umbrageous forest tree, and the graceful and delicate lay intermingled with plants exhibiting that mag patience of colour, splendour-which the botanical world under a tropical sun develops colour BO harmonious that every hue was the corn element of its fellow, and was a blinding so congenial as to be without rigidity, harshness, severance.

Thus it is, therefore it is, that Paradise has v finished, Luz, is gone, Jacob's ladder is only found as on apparition in the clouds, the true cross survives no more among Roman Catholics than the true Ark is mouldering upon Ararat. No scholar can lay his hand on Gethsemane, and for the grave of Moses, the son of Amram, mightiest of lawgivers, though it is somewhere near Mount Nebo and in a valley of Mush, yet eye has not been suffered to behold it, and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day) " But an objector will urge If all traces of Paradise were washed out by the Deluge, how have the names Hiddekel and Euphrates been given to streams flowing from the table-land of Armenia, if these were not identical with two of the streams of Paradise v In reply, it seems only natural to conclude, that with the delights Eden is admitted to have possessed, and which after the Deluge could only be expressed by una Hope, and finding portions of Armenia, near Ararat, (answering to their harmonized and degener Ueconceptions of earth's first-born joys, the descendants of Noah and his sons being anxious to identify then chosen residence with the garden planted by Deity, gave the names which oral tradition had handed down as those of two of the rivers of Eden to the Tigris and Euphrates, which rivers, in the facts of union, and again branching, like sense of the billy songs of this land (very unusual phenomena), were calculated to command special attention, and seemed to identify them with the antediluvian streams Wherever Eden may have been, however watered, and under what ever circumstances lost to man in locality, are of little importance to us as compared with its historical incidents These have surrounded it with a halo of glory, and upon (these its interest chiefly centres but they do not come within the province of a meeting for the study and illustration of horticulture. It is now our privilege to show how superior Eden, as a botanical collection, was to the elevated state which preceded it this we desire to do with the reverent footings of a devoted disciple, for, in pondering these traces of footprints of Don), we acknowledge them to be the earliest intimation we possess of the providential arrangements of a glow IOUS and beneficent Creator. The comparison of those two epochs cannot be made with any degree of minuteness or circumstantiality, and, until recent investigations, it was presumed that previous to the period when Eden burst 1 upon history in all the beauty, elegance, and luxuriance of a divinely appointed residence for man, the vegetable kingdom was unrepresented, and, supposing Paradise to be the inauguration of the present system, there is no doubt but we can show from the dank but unfailing, tablets of geological science that vegetable hie flourished through many previous ages. 1 ueee irrefragable records of vegetable growth during the darkness of an era which the light of our day finds it otherwise impossible to penetrate possibly do not show us every plant which then ,(\istcd,but they certainly do not lead us astray by pure traying what did not exist Some of these tablets are 1 treasured up for the instruction of the public in our museum yonder, and exhibit in minute far -Binnie plants 1 allied to special with which we are familiar, and principally 1 belonging to the class of which the tree fern may be regarded as the highest type The ages preceding Eden are shown to have been or gressive in character to the utmost limits geologic records penetrate Not illustrating the "Development Theory of Dai area, but progress in I love), and increased vitality and the introduction at marked geologic intervals of grander and more complex specimens of botanic anatomy, not the gradual spontaneous transition of one species into another of higher development - such a process of trans formation has never been demonstrated but the creation of the superior, while the inferior was in i existence, and fully developed 1 bus in the Silurian strata we find a species of plant of very simple construction belonging to the confers, a section of the alge,ouoof 1 the British seaweeds, and ascending towards the surface the fossil specimens are of a more and more complicated character In the clay which underlies the carboniferous or cool period, the stagnation roots of the sigillaria exist in comparative abundance, the trunks consist of flute! columns, richly carved and fretted, and are the purple of botanists and geologists alike, for they do not resemble j ny vegetable production the earth now yields From the carboniferous period we obtain tablets, which are wholly composed of what was once vegetable matter, as our eyes, anatomy, and chemistry conclusively attest, so that every atom of coal that is consumed was once a living plant, and still previous, a wondrous ray of light " Can you tell me what power is driving that train''" said George Stephenson to Dr. Buckland, on a terrace of Drayton Manor, on observing a train passing. "Well," said the Geologist, "I suppose it IS OBO of your big engines." " But what drives the engine " " Oh, verylikelyia canny Newcastle diver.' "What do you say to starlight of the sun -"' resid Stephenson " How can that be," said the Doctor. " It is nothing else, ' the engineer replied. " It is light bottled up in the earth for tens of thousands of years-light absorbed by plants and vegetables, being necessary for the condensation of carbon during the process of their growth, if it be not carbon in another form, and now after long ages, in fields of coal, that latent light is again brought forth and liberated, made to work as in that locomotive, and tor great human pur- poses." A singularly beautiful thought, and as true as it is beautiful. This light was absorbed by dense dark masses of vegetation, not like the forests of Brazil, nor the impenetrable scrubs of Australian rivers, for there was not the pleasing variety of colour and form, but they consisted of huge arborescent club mouses thicker than the body of a man, and two sows to eighty feet in height, " amid forests of aibornceoùs ferns, tall as our second-class forest trees, combining the towering strength of manhood with the slender grace of makeS beauty. 'With these sprang up the calamine, a plant form which no longer flourishes, a delicate reed of twenty feet in height, and growing as a thick and impenetrable as the fairy hodge which sur- I rounded the passes of the sleeping beauty." Here also were found stout and lofty pines-the graceful and magnificent araucaria- raising their green tops in regal glory 16ft fcetovorthewateryoozo. Apparontlytherowerothennoaltor nating fcsBons, for these pines grow continuously and so fast as to form hollows in the place of the path we look for in woody trees and they are remarkable for the absence of cones «ureeponding with those of recent pines and Mrs. Added to these were a few palms and a " very few flowers of a poor and low kind, but none on which a herbivorous memorial would browse," and none capable of omitting the refreshing odours which now so delightfully scent the zephyr, and cheer the faint and weary in this world of toil. During this period the most intense silence prevailed, there being no insooUi or life to break the solitude of that dreary world; " and the atmosphere was hot, steamy, and foggy. Some conception may be formed of the huge wildernesses of luxuriant trees and matted wastes of colossal ferns, mosses and reeds of the period, when we learn a single workable coal seam in Nova Scotia, into which this vegetation was compressed or fossilized, is of the great thickness of 37 feet, and this is but one specimen of a long series " of the otored-up fuel of a world." Approaching nearer to the recent period, and examining the Peruvian strata and Ti massive formation for the flora they contain, we are struck with the comparative barrenness they disclose, but still flora existed, as also throughout the Jurassic formation, and in addition to mentioned specimens of previous ones we find a few herbaceous plants. It is worth notice that two of families which still receive a very large share of the attention devoted to vegetable life have over had representatives. " These OTO the fern and pink families. All the species have become extinct over and over again, but the families and many of the genera are over reproduced, and so far as we know, (he earth never possessed a flora that has not its ferns and its pines," To the amber pine, now extinct, were the pre-Adamite indicted for a dewy balsam which constituted the beauteous and odoriferous amber still found in Scotland and Prussia. Enclosed in this amber five were found mosses, fungi, liverworts, and other plants of so very delicate a structure that would not have been preserved in shale or stone. In all, forty-eight different shrubs and trees, and not less than 300 different kinds of insects have been found preserved in this vegetable substance Before geology became known as a science, very much interest was centered upon those preservation, and we quote Pope's lines as an illustration : " Pretty in amber to observe the forms Of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare, , line wonder how the mischief they got there." Passing through the Cretaceous and arriving at the Tor trary formation, we find pines, yews and cypresses, oaks, elms, alders, and birches constituted the primeval forests, while climbers throw their tendrils over lofty trees and hung in tangled and enchanting profusion in circles and festoons. And later in this period botany assumed greater strength and beauty; planes, laurels, and fig trees congregated with palms and bamboos and the Pliocene was rich in walnuts, acacias, robins, and the tulip tree. In contrast with those epochs, our Eden seems robed with Divine majesty, and a few moment's' thought will prove its immense superiority over the two pre-Adamite periods when botany was in the ascendency. It is not our desire to depreciate in your estimation the flora of those periods, tor we are sensible the least of God's works is refreshing even to look at and said Henry Martyn, " a leaf or a straw makes me feel myself in good company." And while we prize them- as Divine crcatiouB and wonder at their peculiar character, we, as lovers of the beautiful, and as floriculturists, would not exchange for the whole Dro Adnmito flora the minute elegance and delicacy of leaf and flower of our lily of the valley, or the glowing fascination of our rosebuds. Then, throughout the long past ages we search in vain for the evidence of odour diffusing plants, such as the honeysuckle, the lavender, and the hawthorn to also are we compelled to admit the absence of fruit bearing trees and shrubs, as the luscious orange, the clustering grape, the apricot, or the rubicund strawberry. Cereals were wanting; neither wheat, oats, or barley flourished; and there were no esculents-nono of the classes represented by the cabbage, carrot, or pea. The grand providential character of these arrangements proves their divinity, commands our highest adoration, and con- clusively proves the benignity of our Creator. There is thus no opportunity for comparison be tween the pre-Adamite and Eden any more than we could institute one between Deity and man. Aden was rich in everything that could contribute to man's glory-, comfort, and enjoyment. It was a perfect cornucopia of fruits and flowers and seeds. The pre Aduuiitca did not contain a single moment that could have sustained human life. And man was not called into being until the coal had become transmuted from growing plants such an infliinmiaklo substance-until slates, and sand- stones, and lime, and iron were capable of being formed into his habitations- until every particle of earth seemed redolent of deligHt and eloquent in its Creator's praise, and not until " God saw everything that He had made, and behold it was very good." We may now be pardoned for making the very brief enquiry-In what did the goodness of Eden consist as compared with our present Horn And you, doubtless, are prepared to furnish an adequate reply-, for it is proved? Bently within your province. Whatever may be the comparative perfection observed in patents now, their normal condition is believed to have been absolutely good. Whether they degenerated immediately after the fall as one of the inscrutable sequences of man's disobedience ; or whether they degenerated from want of care and culture ; or whether the standard of perfection now striven for is a mere matter of taste, and that the glory of Eden was but the native beauty in which we find wild flowers robed, we have now no criteria to enable us to judge, and it is not a subject upon which the theologian or the botanist has cared to offer suggestions. But to suppose that our rose has descended in a straight line from the wild briar, and that the bread was the perfection of Eden, is abhorrent to our prejudices and subversive of all precon- ceived notions. Milton infers the bear to be the offspring of sin, and thus describes our mother Eve tending her Horal queen : " Veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood Half speed, to thick the roses blushing round About her glowed ; oft stooping to support Each flower of tender stalk, whose head, the gay, Cainiition, purple, azure, or speckled with gold Hung drooping, unsustained." , He evidently estimated this flower as surpassing our own so far as imagination can aid our conception of elegance and beauty. But we can hardly conceive that Paradise was such that it did not suggest elements for man's continuous mental as well as physical employment, and for the exercise of holy cosmetic aspirations. For whatever may be our foregone conclusions of the Edeaic condition of the TOBO, the heartiness, the dahlia, and the camellia, there must have existed ample opportunity for the 'exercise of all man's faculties in the culture according to his heaven-born tastes-of the very flowers which once surrounded and graced the footsteps of Deity. The wisdom of an ordeal of progress by the employment of human agency must be apparent to all who esteem success to be man's highest joy. What has not this activity achieved ? It enables man to riot and luxuriate amid the enlivening scones which nature aided by art presents for his delectation. By his labour our native hills and dales, (Watered by brooks" and rivers, afford a luxuriant green, enhanced by- the ever-varying brilliancy and grandeur of the landscape in which the diversities of colour and form give a living lustre to the spring, and deeply into the rich : glories of the autumn. It is now a well-observed axiom that there is not a wild flower on the wide prairie, on the high mountain, or in the deep valley so beautiful but that it may be made more beautiful by culture; the Rosjrian produces a flower with fuller petals and richer colour the dahlia becomes more symmetrical, and the carnation wears in more gorgeous dress. But in floriculture there appears to be no ideal standard of excellence. It is said of a famous Danish sculptor that having attained his ideal he wept at the thought that now he must inevitably decline ; but no . sooner do you as cultivators achieve one degree of excellence, (than in your admirable rivalry you start for a newly conceived goal, and hence become your own taskmasters-and quietly award to yourselves the conviction of having gained a well-merited victory. 60 not having a present ideal of perfection, it is impossible to fix one for Eden. Then of one fact we are cognisant. All our plants were created divinely perfect in the provision made for their (propagation ney were constructed so as to renew and ! perpetuate their kinds through an indefinite period, and ! the recent wonderful triumphs by culture in shape, size, and colour development which have been achieved were ; then in embryo. 1 In conclusion, there is no doubt many wish they had been formed superior to death-that they had been planted in Eden where the air, the earth, and the waters teemed with life, and immortality breathed in the winds, flowed in the streams, ripened in the fruits, and exhaled from the flowers." But, as Christians, we feel our prospects to be even more glorious than those of our great progenitor ; the hope of immortality in a celestial Eden of eternal bliss is, through Christ, of inestimable value; more to be desired than many terrestrial gardens, however pure and 'lot ely. ; A vote of thanks to Mr. Durham was cordially awarded, on the motion of Mr. W001 r. j THIS Volhlaal publishes an extraordinary statement ? which, it says, is official, about the number of sick and wounded in the German army during the late war. Apart altogether from deaths, the Central Bureau of information in Berlin reports that within twelve months it had authenticated 650,000 German cases of wounds and sickness, and 78,800 French cases. This, of course, represents the total number (who went through the hospitals, but it is not the custom in the Prussian army to go on the sick list for trifles. The reduction in the general power and comfort of the young men of the nation represented in these figures must be very great. I Tin: RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE Mr. G. F.
