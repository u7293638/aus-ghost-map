I A Peculiar Case. — Another instance I showing the inconvenience and trouble I 'caused by the discontinuance of free I 'passes on the railways for the escort' of I prisoners, has boen brought under our I ' notice, A man absconded from his mas I ter's employ at the Forth, and was ap I prehended in Hobart Town, and from the I /capital was passed: through the island by I stage to tho Forth for trial, the whole of I tho distance being performed on foot, in I the company of the various constables I on the route. The opinion is expressed I that the ' police forco will have to be in I creased if this mode of escort is to be con I 'tinned. ' I Accident at Skelbrook. — During the I 'gale of wind on Monday (says the Devon I ' Herald), a number of dead, trees were I blown down on Skelbrook, Mr Henry I ' Eockliff's farm at Sassafras.

Hobart Town Regatta — Tho meot I ' ing convened by the Mayor took place at I , the Town Hall, on Wednesday evening, I says the Mercury, and was numerously I attended. The day for holding tho Re I ? gattd was unanimously fixed for Tuesday, I February 4, 1879. His 'Excellency the I Governor was requested to become the I ' Patron, Mr D. M'Millen was elected I as Treasurer, and Mr O'Boylo as Hon. I Secretary. A vote of thanks was passed I to Mr J. E. Risby who, after forty years I active interest in the Hegata, had deter I ' mined to retire from, the treasurership, I and from the committee. . I The Hawkesbury Races —The racing I season for the year 1878 9 was opened I yesterday at Hawkesbury, N.SW., and I though no Victorian horses of note I , started, some significance will attach to I the event by the victory in the Guineas of I ? Mr De Mestre's stable over that of Sir I Hercules Robinspn. That His Lordship I should beat Emily, a filly which stands I fourth on the list for the Melbourne Cup, I will doubtless affect the market very con I siderably, and cause a rush to be made by I the public on Mr Do Mestre's cole. I Writing of his chance for the Cup, I Augur,', in the Australasian, says : — - I Brilliant colt though His Lordship un I doubtedly is, I've an idea that he is a I non-stayer. He is one of the speediest I yonngsters that wo have ever seen, and I , though not quite himself in the Marybyr 1 - ?n9ng Plato, he would have won had he I' not been interfered with; in fact, there I are many who aver to this day that he I did win, but the judge thought otherwise. I I In the aiilumn ho displayed excellent I form, winning Ihe Ascot-vale Stakes mid I Sires' Produce Stakes at Flemington, and I ( the Champagne Stakes and«Sires' Produce I ' Stakes at Randwick, where, however', 'he I had to succumb to Bosworth in the I Breeders' Plate, and the style in which I the brother to Richmond woro him down I created an impression that His Lordship I would not beat home over a long course. I Burwood is a mysterious animal, that has I ? always been'regarded as a pretty good one, I but has never yet been proved so, and 1 I | think it questionable if he ever will, . Of I ' Sir Hercules Hobinson's filly he has the I following : — Emily is a filly that I have I a great fancy for, and should she prove I i : successful, I'm suro nobody will begrudge I ' Sir Hercules Rol'inson so well- deserved a I victory. Emily was bred in Victoria, and I is by Mr Brown's Tim Whiffler from I Sappho, the dam of Lecturer, Kings I borough, and Savanaka— a rare trio from I one mare — and Emily makes a quartette, I for she is decidedly the best of last year's I fillies, and there is nothing in the Mel I . bourne Cup thai I like better than this I ' youngster. I ? ; To Evert Woman. —Think twice be I fore you beliove every evil, story you I hear, and think twenty times before you I repeat it, especially if it is about a woman. I Sav to voursolf. 'This mav not be: true. I or it may bo exaggerated,' unless you. I have proof of tho veracity of your, infor-. I ' mant. People sometimes tell falsehoods, I they often make mistakes, and they some I ? times 'hear wrong.' There is auricular I ' . illusion as well as optical illusion. : Take I all these things into consideration before I you even believe. As . for repeating the I story, ask yourself if it is necessary. It I . sometimes is necessary. Then do it with I the fear of God. and Lhe remembrance of I the golden rule before you. Let us give I ' : the helping hand, not - the downward I push; so may the angels reach their I hands towards us when we stand in need. I . — Danbtiry News.
