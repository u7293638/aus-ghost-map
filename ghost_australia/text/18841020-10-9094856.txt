They ran without variation in this order past the stand and around the turn, but, seconding the Hill Yately deprived Lavington of command. Holono here, too, improved her position, and was immediately in the wake of those two, Colstoun and Fryingpan both occupying positions in the centre of the field, which was thus early strung out.
