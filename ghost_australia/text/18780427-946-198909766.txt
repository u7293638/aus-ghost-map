The jury did not agree till a quarter past 10 o'clock, when it was; ascertained that his Honor had left shortly before for his residence at Hawthorn. The jury was in consequence locked up for the night.' Next day they found the defendant guilty of only a common , assault. He was sentenced to twenty-four hours' imprison ment, to pay a fine of £30, and to keep' in prison until it was paid. An information (says the .Age) was laid at the Brighton Police Court on Friday, 12th inst, by William Jolly, sen., that Mary Katen, or . Keating, did abandon a female child under the age of two years, thereby endangering the child's life. It appeared that Jolly's second son had beei.fc living with his father, but was at present working for somebody else. The girl, apparently supposing that' young' Jolly was still, living with, his father,' left the child at Mr Jolly's door with a letter pinned on its breast, addressed — ' Mr William Goley, — This child will eat sop bread and milk for i have been a feedin it on it.' Inside was written :— ' My dear, William Goley . . . . .Aperl 9. So you Bee that the child is yours and you sed that you wood'keep it and you se'd that you wocd stand your ground and'pay for it so do and ihope you will riothirt it, f or i love it and you as Well, and i think you will now that it is yours, be kose it is latri-t nmi nn/1 T ltnifA rvnf- nolnnift 4-T«n4- Ttrvwa JJIIW JUU C«11U J.

By the ' rary'' she is supposed to have meant the Yarra. '.'The bench issued a warrant for her arrest; The ..following anecdotes of the West Melbourne election' appear in the Mel bourne correspondence of the Warrnarn lool Guardian : — ' At one of the West Melbourne \ committee-rooms ^ the , other night a stout rosy-gilled gentleman pre sented himself, with a vie.w to give in his adhesion to the candidate. : The secretary had no sooner heard his name' than he at once cried out, ' Why, you're dead, air, dead as a door nail, according ; to the postman.' ' Dead, am ' I P' cried the elector, ' I'll show .you all about that;' and he floored the secretary. The dead man then walked off to the rival candi date's committee- room. ' The secretary says he has no hankering after substantial ghosts. An incident which occurred at Mr Francis' meeting ' in' Flinders street was highly amusing. While Mr IJranoiswasspeaking a drunken sailor came into the room, and marching right up until he faoed the candidate,'he ' at: once began to interrupt, good humoredly, how ever. Mr Francis put up with the nui sance for a while, but at last, wearied out, he said :— ' Now, my good ? ? felk-w; wilt you acceptone of two alternative's. Will you be ejected by force, or ? will you take 2s and go out yourself P-' I don't know anything about ? the alternative'- — hie — ? 1 .1 '1 ? ( L.' i.TIll l.l.- i.t ?
