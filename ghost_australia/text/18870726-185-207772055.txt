THE CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC CHURCH. The seating accommodation at the Catholic Apostolic Church was fully taxed last Sun day evening, when Mr Miller, the evangelist, gave a public address, as previously an- nounced. After pointing out that the open ing of the sixth seal iu the Book of Revela tions corresponded with the first French revolution, he said that a lull was then pre dicted, during which the four winds of the earth were held back by four angels until another angel had sealed the servants of God in their foreheads. The four winds (said the preacher) are the judgments of God, and nothing but the intercession of Christ can keep them back. This He offers personally in heaven aud by His ministers on earth “ I will that supplications, prayers, interces sions, and thanksgivings be offered for all men,” said the apostle Paul. This fourfold form of intercession was in the beginning offered by the fourfold ministry of apostles, prophets, evaugelists, and pastors for the universal church, and elders, prophets, evangelists aud pastors in the particular church, so it is no strained interpretation to say that the four angels standing on the four corners of the earth are none other than these four ministries again restored, and offering this intercession in every land. The seal of the living God, said the preacher, is the gift of the Holy Ghost iu His fulness. The apo stolic ministry alone can convey this. It was given in the beginning by the laying on of apostles’ hands, and the promise that it will be given iu these days is a further proof that this ministry will be restored. The preacher then dealt with the vision of the woman clothed with the Sun, pointing out that the woman was the Church, and the 12 stars could be no other than 12 apostles. He theu spoke of Antichrist and the coming judgment.
