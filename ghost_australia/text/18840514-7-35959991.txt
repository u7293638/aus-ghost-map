CHURCH OF ENGLAND SYNOD. The annual section of the Church of Eng-<*> land Synod was opened at the Cathedral on Tuesday morning, May 13, when there was a choral celebration of the Holy Communion, and the bbhop delivered bis pattoral address, which was as follows :— Beverend and Dear Brethren—l cannot but meet you in a spirit of deep thankful. ness. The year that has elapsed since we nut met in synod has been one of much anxiety. It was no easy matter to take the place of your leader, when the powerful guidance witii which you formerly had been Ueasedwas brought into memory. I had (as, indeed, I have yet) much to learn. But you have greatly helped me. Clergymen and laymen alike have held out the hand of warmest sympathy and friendship. On all sides, whether in our own communion or without us, a kindly generous spirit has been shown. I should be ungrateful indeed did I not acknowledge it. But to our God, our Father, and to hb ever-blessed Son, and to the guiding Spirit sent to teach ui, be the ftaneagiring and the praise. You will not inn yearlook for an address of any great length, I will bat briefly tone* upon come of the events that most concern us, and perhaps more briefly review onr position and the work we have in band or in twospecx. The whole diocese was stirred by the Bcwacf the death of Bbhop Short. Inaay position in this new country he would have made bis mark. Hb manly coinage, hb perseverance under dUncnltitis, hb extreme energy, his wise forethought, and hki constant CIMCnIICtfJ mli o?tnwflnfx tUkel CsUatsMwaHAUWS I which rendered him peculiarly fitted to be a pioneer. Men respected nun, ckUdnn loved him, all learned from him; bat win can tell as well as bis successor what reason we have to thank God for the lines of work be bid down, and for tat standard ot duty be set up as the first bbhop of thta see! That the church has grown in numbers, in her institutions, in her build. Ings to what we now have fa, under God's blessing, due to oar first bbhop. His memory will be cherished always through out Australia. But in Otis diooeso oar beat tribute to his memory will be in our develop ment of bb work, The year has brought m ite joys with its sorrows. The appointment of our Primate baa given us not only the highest encouragement in the greatness of the man and tab remarkable fitness for so importantaiM)sitioii,butintb?faet that oar organisation In thb greet continent has now tecdveditseompletion, Tnevarioui dioseses an now knit together, at least in their framework, in that solidarity and oompist ness which an so necessary for all ateadi. ness cf growth and harmony of action. Of the Bbhop of Sydney himself it is not fitting that in tab place I should speak aa 1 might be inclined to speak; nor fa it necessary, for much has men said, and yon indeed have aeen him facs to' face. Bnt I will add that from the ia> ttreating gathering ot bishops at his ?n -tbtonement in Sydney—the largest gathering of bishops of our communion, I suppose, which has ever been held in the Southern hemisphere etriti of no felt that we returned to oar work strengthened and animated with new hopes, with a loftier ideal of oar work, with a larger outlook upon our surroundings, and with a greater desire than perhaps ever before for the unity of toe Church of God, and for the realisation of the brotherhood of man in oar one Lord and elder brother Jesus Christ. Wo mayhethsnkfalalso totheGnat Head of the Church for tan steady growth which weeee hi the extension of the Episcopate in Australia, That the bishopric of Btverina has been created and has been so aatbfae totfly filkdmustbe a cause of gladness not onry to those who lira in that dioesse, bat to the whole church. We are gainers all along the line, white we keep touch with one another,by the spiritual growth in anyone part, And the men the church grow the more it will grow. A striking illustration of this comes from America. Last yew was the hundredth anniversary ot the conseera tion of tin first bishop of the Anglican earn munkm for it merit a, In one century how great the growth! Then one obhop and a baneful of dergy; now forty-eight bishop*, 3.572 clergy, and 372,481 commuoicaoti. It bin the number of these that the growth of the church fa most rsmsrirsMe; (or while the popdation ot the United States hai somewhat aeon than doubled amea say the year 18GQ, the number of cosimnniwmts has increased man than fourfold in tin same period. Last year I aUnded to the labors ot the extremely able and teamed men appointed ill Kngland as royal comndsdonen to enquw* into the vexed question ot eecfe. davtiosi courts. Their report since then has been presented. Ido not at present dedn to refer to it further than to call your atton. tion to the extremely valuable testimony which thdr patient historical investi Z ationi afford to the continuity ot the Church of Kngland from a period long antecedent to the Herman Conquest. It has been the thojusjbtleas custom of aome vfnwn* to ?ptmt of the Church of Boglaad as though her date of birth was to be found only in themxteenthcentury. Aperomlof thliim portent report will, I think, dissipate any each opbJon, and eouvinoa any attentive reader of the antiquity of the glorious in< herttacee which fa our*. My brethren, I mention thta, not, God knows, to foster a feeling of pride and superciliousness—ls* from it, as I hops yon will presently see but because reflection upon the fact should arouse us to a higher sense of curdaty, for it we review our position in then colonies. what fa then that most greatly strike ui?

We am, to for as all outward adventitious advantages are wmusineo, exactty ia the aamopodttou Hgatdipg the state as b the newest denomi nation of any religion that may seek its growth in thb land. Bat we have an inward conschwroess of lineage which can neither ba taken away nor bestowed elsewhere. We catty with us the doctrines and disdpllao of tie earliest agee of Christianity as they have descended to no interwoven with the life of cur Boguah lOniattun.

Still, coward it flows, and you look agate, and a brlghtnem has again attended it, and health and life adorn Ite beaks. Same of you will remember one of BuropVe meat famims riven flowing thus. Asitlraps from its fay Mrthplano anil roams down the gnat valley which been its name, the very rocks, fretted and fashioned by its impetuous flow, give of their sobnanes to its waters; and discolored with the fruit of ite own energies, and already yellow in iti age, it plunges into ths deep blue of Geneva's lake.

We an not more Tinglishmim by nature than we an (tor the most jpan^Englbh church, men by descent. We have thought it right to ding to the past, and, God helping us, we will so ding, xtat what does thb entail upon us* First, responsibility. If the teaching of tie church fa misunderstood, if men fal to see the nine of her ordinances or to be helped by the strength ot her faith, how much of that may be due to our short* comings? We have not, aaa whole, lived as though* we believed in tne church. These who have formed a sectional religious oommunity have thrown their vigor and onthnsiam into the cause of the community they have espoused. But churchmen have Uvedas though, because once the church and the nation wen (la prates* aion at least) identical, no cntiinslavm was becoming except to a clergyman. And hence arose the mfacaievoui opinion tint thechurch meant the clergy, and nothing more. Toank God, tint opinion fa fast dying out. Wo realise to-day man than for ages past the layman's priesthood and kingship. The gift of the 'Holy Ghost was to she church, not specially to tiwehngy of the church, san to fitthemfor thdr office. And that which we have freely received for the common good we an bound to freely give. Bach man who falls to stain even to live up to the chunk's standard fa a witness against the church.

For every man who loves Chrtatmon than summit must be wrung to the heart by the divWons which an ao contrary to Hia purposes. Our main doty then Is to aim at a high standard of Christian life. Wo would fain raise the spititnal tone of our own people— believing that thai wo bat acWevsour inuncdiate duty—and take our part in raising the moral tone of the whole oomnonitf. What ia there especially that wa may do to bring about this rault? The power of tfce early OhrbUana lay, I think, in their f?m belief in three great facts. First— They believed that parchamd with the precious blood of Christ and justified by His resurrection they belonged to God. They did not question the fact, or nope aome day to qualify themselves to belong to Kim. They took God at Hb word, and looked upon their baptism as a pledge that it was true. Secondly-They lieueved Out, ac* cordhtg to the promise of their Lord, whatsoever they ashed in Htename would be granted them. Hut afore in Hb Bane they met. fulfilling His oaered cemmand, and in Hb name they prayed. Thirdly-They /believed that the Holy Gfacst was in diem, a living power, and in that power they worked. Kow. our failing Is just wait of thia faith. Would the nwanlns of our prayer-book bo dark any longer to those whose belief was of thia kind? fctl* not the whole of oar Utargy pregnant with just these cardmal touthat ? every nominal churchman believed in them, anted op to them, how different the result from what we commonly find. How wo need to enable onr people to reattee them batter. What I cay, can we do? As clergy we must strive for the deepening fink ofour own ?nirltoal life. Every one who knows the cir enmttancra of a ekrgymarii lib in the country or both diatoiets of a large colony must realise that bis difficulties are extremely great. Alone, amgto- handed, without friend of kindred alms or con genial mind, he hat often to cany tn hb work amid some privations and amid great dweouragementa.

Therean twowajain wliic* I tbkkt&b; sense maybe advantageoualy ?*?*l?*- The Bbhop of Lfohfitld bat lately introduced into oil diocete a pastoral order of bro?isrhood, which a large number of the clergy have joined.

Wo are fortunate in pcutatiog in this colony a prom which evidently avoids as much as possible the parade of the wont cases of crime and immorality; but it fa too evident that sins which an aaid to be on the inornate in Kng. land are aadly prevalent here.
