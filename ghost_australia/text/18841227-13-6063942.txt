Of local aflairs a pleasant review baa been possible, but far less happy is the task of the historian who, whether occupying in the spirit or tho flesh the historic seat on London-bridge, proceeds to cast his eye over the provinces of the British Empire. The most sanguino may bo pardoned if for a time, and without any ultimate intention of despairing of the republic, he becomes a pessimist. Everywhere he sees evidence far too palpable of weakness on the part of tho Executive, and weakness accompanied by its inevitable shadow, violence. When the second Empire was in its zenith, De Tocqueville made a study of the situa- tion, and after dwelling upon tho vanity of the Emperor, his vacillation, his rashness, and his ignorance of details, tho seer concluded with the words, " I " don't know how long this can last, I " don't know where tho break will be, " but I dread some great disaster." Mr. Gladstone is not likely to remain at the helm as long as did Louis Napo- leon. A general election in a year might be fatal to him. Tho English people are bettor informed, and can bring moro pressure to bear, than could the electoral community of France; but given an era of Mr. Gladstone and Uko circumstances would justify the De Tocqueville pre- diction of a catastrophe somewhere. Africa first attracts attention, for that quarter of the globe must lie Uko a dead weight upon the heart of not only the patriot, but of the man of common sense. From north to south the record of the year is one of dis- grace. For proof of the utter absence of wisdom with which the foreign affairs of the nation are now conducted, it is only necessary to quote Mr. Glad- stone's triumphant utterance at the Lord Mayor'» dinner in IS». :-"We! " lmve reached another stage in the ' progress of our work It is tho pro " gi ess of our work and that alone, that " determines the continuniica of our " armed force m Egypt We are about " to withdraw-tho order has been "given-and that withdrawal will in " eludo the evacuation of Cairo I " think tho country will deem this is a " subject for congratulation It will " lighten tho burdens imposed upon " Egyptian finances It will offci a " new testimony to the world that we " have been m earnest in the declara " tions wo ha\o icpeatedly modo, and so on through a wilderness of platitudes, which aro described at the time as ' eloquence, ' and winch pro\o to bo rubbish Die question of whether it was a light policy or a wiong to go to Egypt and to íetire is as nothing What must alarm the student of the o\ ents of the day is the incapacity of tho (Gladstone Government to gi asp realities which were patent enough to other people lho withdrawal was dechued by all experts to bo impossible lho attempt to carry it out has led to an expenditure which is not so much to be deprecated -for those who support their Glad stone in Great Britain ought to pay for him-but to a

Gladstone a proclama tions invited them to do Hie expedí tion and the coming slaughter are now necessities, but the situation is self created The career of the first Napo i eon in Eg) pt was written m

Secretary of State is justly blamed for giossduphcity,wohaveto iemember that it was Mr Gladstone who, addressing the House of Commons, first juggled with words, and drew the distinction which gives Northern New Guinea to the Germans Macaulay, iu a prognant passage, speaks of a powor which enables a Minister of War to lose battles with impunity, a Secretary of State to throw over colonies, a Lord of the Admiralty to neglect the navy, and a Premier to bring the empire to tho verge of ruin lins quality, bo says, is Parliamentary eloquence The great Whig writer has no moro brilliant nor yet any truer sentences And once again the country is under the spell of the talker It is natural that the review m which Ma cauiay wrote should bo bold to say that what England needs at this june ture is another Cromwell, who, if halting m speech and cloudy in ex pression, was swift in grasp and wise and resolute m action Sixteen years ago, when the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science met for the second time at Bir- mingham, the lato Professor Fawcett delivered an address on Economy and Trado to that section of it which was presided over by himself. In so doing, he deplored the separation which has bo long existed between economic science and practical industry, and i-howed what material services the former waa" capable of rendering to tho hitter.

It was now proposed to relegate only 9 000 rècuUvmlea altogether, and to spread their banishment over three years, the bulk of them being despatched to Cayenne, and not to the Pacific. It was, besides, very noticeable that the tone of the 1 rencli preas had become almost hostile to the scheme, and it was confidently anticipated that when tho measure was returned to the Chamber the Deputies would refuse to sanction such an incomplete but costly experiment Under the9e circum Btances the agents general had felt justified in suggesting that the time seemed opportune for renewed remonstrances from the British Government ogainst the passage of the bill 1 he other agents general all expressed concurrence with this view Lord Derb) observed that he was not indis posed to make a fresh represent«tion io the 1 rench authorities but he declined to give oflhand an) pledge that it would be based on the lines which the deputation favoured What the precise terms of the suggested re presentation were has not been disclosed.

Some experts are expressing dissatisfaction at the moderate speed attained by the new Queensland gunboats, one of which (the Ga>undah) sailed from Dartmouth on the 17th inst Tlie oflicuil reply is that the gun- boats fulfil the conditions contracted lor, and that if the colonial Gov eminent wished their vessels to attain a higher rate of speed wtnch, it is admitted, is desirable for lighting purposes-they liad only to increase the cost of their boats The opinion is also held by cer- tain military experts that the < olonuil Govern ments, when ordering future torpedo bouts, should get the very best sea going boats to be procured, and not the smaller craft, which must confine their operations to harbour fighting l'red.

Considerable sensation was created in London on Saturday, November 15 (writes our London correspondent) by the announce- ment of the suspension of Messrs.

The firm, which is very old, held a first class position in the corn trade, and as general merchants trading with the Kast Eight or ten years ago, Mr Spartah, the sole partner in London, reckoned his realised fortune at half a million Merline.

'Hie prevailing impression appears to be, that though there must have been some imprudence in the firm's proceedings, their fall was largely due to misfortune. It is thought, however, that the estate will realise well, because payments have been suspended promptly, and the ussets are therefore unusually large. San- guine people say that a dividend of 12s. m the £ will be realised, but such an estimate can only be based on conjec- ture at present The chief cause of uneasiness is the fear that we may bave a aeries of almilar failures.

Cape Iteyl.janes, the south west point of Iceland, in order to observe the volcanic island which recently appeared off that cape It was first seen bj the light keeper at Reykjanes on July 2!) and had then the shape of an irregular trun cated cone,with a slight hollow on the top and a projecting shoulder on the north side No earthquakes or other volcanic manifestations accompanied its appearance, but on August "> a series of Bevere »hocks occurred, which split the walls of the lighthouse and damaged the lamps 1 or several da>8 rain and fog obscuied the island \\\ hen next seen its shape had altered, part of the south side had tullen down into the sea, forming two little mounds, nnd leaving a steep, almost perpendicular lace on the south The height of the island is about tv\ o thirds of its length If lies about west south vveBt of Iteykjanes Ivvo oflicers ol a I rench war vessel, who re cently v isitcd He) kjanes, estimate its distance from tlie coast at nine or ten miles, but Mr Paterson believes it to be considerably greater When first Been, the upper part of the island was perfectly black, but it has now begun to whiten, owing to the droppings of the myriads of sea fowl which frequent the ad jaccnt coast and neighbouring islands, and seem airead) to have taken possession of the newland Hie neighbourhood of Kev kjanes is noted tor v olcanie manifestations-islands have

supplementary elections in Berlin, wh eli were held to day, have had the anticipated result '1 he capital is divided into six constituencies, which have hitherto been a monopoly of the Progressists But it may be remembered that at the fust election, about three weeks ago, the only positive result waa the return of a Progressist and a Social Democrat, ' final heats being necessary between three Progressists, or Liberalises, and as many Conservatives, as well as between a Progressist and a Social Democrat, In the latter case, the Socialist (Hasenclever) has been returned by the tremendous majority of 24 <1( !) to the beggarly 721 scored by his opponent In the other three districts, the Progressists-Virchow, Richter, and Munckel- have succeeded by overwhelming majorities, m maintaining their seats, though only, it is plain, by the help of the Socialists The chief interest of this secondary election centered on the con- test between the famous scientist Professor Virchow and the Jew baiting Court chaplain Herr Stoecker. The Herr Hof Prediger had been returned by a provincial constituency, but it was a point of honour with him and his party to do their utmost to breach the fortress of Semitic Radicalism—for that in plain language, is what the capital is—and therefore the electoral agitation on both sides during the last few days has been something compared with which the journalistic fero cities of Eatanswill were mild and good tempered fence Take, for example, the fol lowing effusion from the Börsen Courier - "This is a day of momentous decision for Berlin, whereof the unfavourable issue would produce deep shame, and be more lamentable than the first case of cholera in our midst By electing Pastor Stoecker Berlin would declare itself to be the hotbed of an epidemic which would not, like the cholera die out of itself in weeks or months, and which once amongst us would be more difficult to deal with than the Asiatic pest.' It is probable, however, that but for the aid of the Socialists Professor Virchow would have been defeated by Herr Stoecker, who scored 15,849 votes to the 23 805 of his Radical adversary, and this be- tokens great progress on the part of the Con servatives and Anti- Semites, compared with the results of the election three years ago But the Social Democrats, on the other hand, now hold two of the guns in the Radical re doubt and of the captors it must be saul that together they have scored far more votes than any other pair of candidates throughout the Empire."
