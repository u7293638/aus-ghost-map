A Legend of Blarney Castle A modern proprietor of Blarney Castle took the liberty of cutting down various old trees which bad shed honour on tbc grounds for centuries. Having received the price of them in Cork, he went home wet and weary, ate a hearty dinner in the "King of Sweden's Room," warmed his inside with a couple of tumblers of hot punch, and with the feeling of a man who had done a good action, betook himself to is arm-chair to enjoy a sleep. At midnight he awoke and rung for his body-servant, Thady, and immediately fter heard a heavy and stately step on he grand staircase. Looking towards he door he saw a gentleman enter in the ostume of James li s. Court, holding gold-headed cane in his hand. He ceremoniously saluted the proprietor, adanced to the windows and sorrowfully contemplated the trunks of the fine old rees cumbering the ground. After a while the last Lord Clancarihy for it was his ghost) approached the frightned " sleeper awakened." looked down n him sadly and sternly, and pointed ith his cane toward the dismal scene broad. He then stamped on the floor and anished. At the same moment the astle shook, the bells began ringing, and very piece of furniture in the room fell own. The poor man was covercd with mass of articles and there he lay till morning. Thady then entering cried for help. Help came, and with some trouble the servants disencumbered the body of the poor man, and, by a good deal to do, he was brought to consciousness, the ghost not intending his death. However, he never ate another dinner nor slept another night in Blarney Castle.â€”Prom The Fireside Stories of Ireland, by Patrick Kennedy.
