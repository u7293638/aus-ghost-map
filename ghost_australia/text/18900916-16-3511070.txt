THE HYPNOTIC EPIDEMIC. (River r t II Rulinrthon in the Aichjniul) We are passing at the present moment through a mental epidemic YY Inch may be called the hypnotic or the epidemic of hypnotism 'These mental epidemics are very similar to those that are purely physical They often take the spreading form which constitutes them epidemical they start from one particular centre, and follow special lines of human intercourse riley feed at regular bones, appeal, case pen, of nearly disappear then reappear in full force in rest the attention of the show Id, and once more subside They seem to be modified by external conditions. and it might almost be said by season, or at all events, by cycles 01 consists of by em s In the phenomena which they aieinamtestcil the bodily physical phenomena combine with the spiritual 01 mental both leading to certain conditions which may more correctly be designated disease 01 discs ed condition, of body and of mind The above are striking features of an epidemical out break, but there is one other in this hypnotic epidemic still more striking than all the last-named that the persons in whom the phenomena of it are most easily manifested are they who, by nervousness stitution, the most impressionable, persons who, constitutionally, at a easily overcome by external violations, who feel most keenly the natural shocks that flesh is heir to and who are led to help and trust on other a more than on themselves Hit people so constituted, " Hypnotics, in our own communities, are by no means insight lacking in number, and in some parts of the world they cast in very large numbers indeed With us they are most frequently met with amongst women, but men are not exempt We may, speak correctly of them as poisons predisposed to quote isional influences, and in some points of view to an enfeebled or gains ition I see, in Dr luckov s recent and able work on " Psycho therapeutics that some authors consider them all as an hysterical cast, and it is not to be denied that many of them are strongly by stencil They are not all of this type, and with regard to them as a class, it is most correct to say that by slain is a rather to he accepted in them as a common coincidental affection than as it cause of the nnpiessionabihty to which they are subject I mean by this that they are hysterically inclined, for the same reason that they am impressionable, the tendency to both conditions hm,? behind both and being independent of both so it happens that some of the impressionable age hysterical whilst others do not, or, at all to this, have HOY et shown proof of the connection by the presentation of decided by step ital phenomena we the pi misty o pitnhatity or within o may be is not easily definable, beyond the bare statement that all members of the class hay of eli tain central attributes and (patches which distinguish tin in, to a considerable extent, as a class They are of the nervous combined with the bilious temperament 'Hit Y mo always sympathetic in their tendencies, commonly elibtinstfnl of their own powers, ready at any moment to fly to others in the face of danger, and in the defence of their opinions obstinate rather than resolute in their descriptions of events with which they have been personally connected they are apt to be contradictory when closely pressed and yet stubborn, after all, on some particular point 'they are freely community native of what they have felt and have been, and there is, I believe myan ibly a touch of sell romance about them which makes Hiern paint in strong colours events con- netted with their personal experiences 'they perhaps all shine in one in tide of belief, they believe in ghosts, and, as a rule, they do not conceal their beliefs this matter since they listen to, and read with avidity, stones of the ghostly and man Y (tions kind, and not even pleased I t being in 'hand IJY what they heal In plain words tin mining love for the lawn tennis is a true point of their nature It seems time that we need not go far to seek the genesis of the class of man and woman kind here depicted We may not be able to describe the constitutional basis of their mental state, but we may, perhaps, detect without much difficulty, its natural hot add to It is 1 astern in songs, and as it lingers the old and finished lord of ghosts, laines, thers, wizards, and witches, that was a prey ailing faith, still worthy of fullest acceptance, up to date separated from those days by a very few generations Go back in this England, six generations only, and there is a gentle tion in which the wisest and the best of the people were (mu in them both in all the arts of divination, and even in the art that would now be set down to the divination of hypnotism. A great and wise and what is more, good Judge, Sir Matthew little, would have had no difficulty whatever in accepting all the statements that have IIUOIY been formulated r< lative to the power of " suggestion, and the power of exceptional individuals in loading or mis- leading others by the influence of their will alone The picture of yÂ» witchcraft is of a craft of that character precisely, nothing more and nothing less 'the beliefs in these crafts are transmitted from a treat to child, partly by conversation and training, partly by the most mysterious and subtle effects of proclivity inherited from the womb It is strange that within the narrow limits of six generations there should yet remain many persons in whom the primitive beliefs of ages are still implanted, and in y horn the physical conditions necessary for the development of the impressionable nature should actively service? So far from this being a w under, the real wonder is that a larger community of the same type does not exist at one time the fact that the impressionable community is so small as it is, is a mighty proof of the advance of mental progress to wards a true and comprehensive o grasp and knowledge of natural law and of durance I spoke in last Aachpiad of the morning I explained the fact of the existence amongst us of an order of adult human beings, who are at any moment liable to death from some YOU slight shock of either a mental in physical character In his manner There are always amongst us a number offer lotus, who are ready at any moment to be overcome by external impressions and to give way to commands of instructions (low mg fiomasnpciioi will These are the persons who come under the institute of what was in old days called f poll and witch craft in later days mtsmtiii>in,und in these latest davshypnotibiii
