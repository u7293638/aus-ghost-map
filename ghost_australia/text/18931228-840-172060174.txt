Seated ut tho window of tho inn, I Could mark it dominating tho whole scene with, its malign influence. I saw it tlion, I poo it now, mid under its malevolence a ;man lying prono on tho quuking surface of 'themursh( gazing pallid-faced, wild- eyed, at tho oboii pool, on whoso ' breast flout traitor bubblob, telling of horror and of d ath. ' . ' , The window of a chemist's shop, tho com monplace signals of a great railway station, or tho starboard lights of a channol steamer, each brings to my. mind tho momory of that rod star. Then do I turn cold with fear. Then do I seek in thoatre, in dance, m travel, a for- getfulncss of that tall tower with its scarlet oyc. In vain my quest for oblivion; for tho horror thrusts itself unannounced beforo my mental gazo. I . leave tho present, I roturn to tho pust, thero to And tho rod star, burning like uu unquenchable witohlight. . .This bizarro episode of my lifo ocoukred somp. years since, when I was on u walking tour in Essex. An artist by profession, I combined business with pleasure by sketching, a great deal during my dosultbiy wandorings, so when I arrived at tho littlo vilfugo of E ; T was rejoicod that I had a good rouord to show to Hadrian. Ho was an author, one whoso pen (more graphic than my penoil) had brought him fiune. I was delighted when he proposed. that w« should, in partnership, -write and illustrato a small hook of English strolliugs. . Hitherto my- ambition lmcl heoii- confined to' 'more dilfittanteism, but now tho Offer of Hadrian inspired mo with 'tho desire for a certain notoriety (scarcely .to ho called fame), and I impatiently awaited his arrival o$ our appointed moeting-plaoo, tho Golden Plover, Inn. ' " ' Business lmd detained hi m in town; elso ; had wo journeyed in company ; ' but, as it was," I sauntered for a whole fortnight through tho pleasant English bounties, in tho hope that ho would join ino ero I reached E— — . No siibh overtaking ocom-red, and at the Golden Plover I awaited his . coming. Tho landlord wits nn oddity, with a twist of originality in his oharactor, and showed' him self, notwithstanding a certain statolincss of ;demean'our, dispoBOd to be companionablo." At tho cohclusioii of ray sapper I silt by tho case ment of tho parlour .with a' consoling pipe, while the host— John Ruth was his nomo — stalked stiff as Mulvolio about, tho room. This hinting, at sociability boing at the momqnt much to my tasto, I invited him to oruck u bottlo of port in my /company. ' Nothing loth ho nccoptod the invitation, . Thus having mutually arranged for' a pleasant evening Buth went off to hia collar, and I, in a pleasing stato of weariness, begotten by a; long day. on my legs; viewed the landscape from the parlour .window. ' A prospect more wild, dreary, and eloquent of desolation could' scarcely he conceived. Intho uncertain light — for it was now tho twi light hour — it took on 'an unwbolesomo look, which struok a chill into my -being. . Tho villago was not far. from tho sea, and the un canny seeming of tho outlook whs tho moro accentuated uy tho LoiiuW boui'u of linsaon waves. I'could hear hut could not see these complaining breakers, and this .hidden pre sence, betraying itself only by dreary moon- ings, seemed a fitting typo of .tho, intangible horror whioh environed tho Grange. Tho inn being at tho ond of tho village, there wus no dwelling beyond savo this', cum brous muss rising portentously - against the luminous sky. Peat my window ran tho hard ..line of tho high roud, beyond this it -stretch of sullen . marsh spreading - like . u , vyitob garden in ' front of the mansion. ; On a' slight riso it bulked, disproportionately '. in . tho land- scnpo, .and from . its',, blooknoss, a tall, lean towor shot .- upward, us; though tho house wore lifting, a warning finger. As is tho enso with- oomo faces, a history is sug gested by some Houses, and I felt sure, thqt d gruesome story, wqs uttaobed to this sullen mansion lying betwixt marsh and 6ca. - Tlie dull; rqar .of - tho' -waves- might lmye told tho story, or I might liavo gained some legendary fragments from the sighing wind/but unversed in nature's .voices I could trunslato, neither boom 'nor. sigh, und was therofoi-o, compelled to apply for information to tlib landlord. At this period of my reflections lie entered tho robm, with tho port' and oundies, much to, my relief, for the influenao' of that jonisly house -was do- ipressing iu tlnfcxtremb. v-', " '< ' -.

I felt a certain qualm of horror, and mecha nically turned my oven toward tlio Grange. There, from tlio height of tlio tower, burned a fierce red light, which in tho gathering dark ness did indeed 1'iok liko an ovfl star. "Every night, it shines," resumed Ruth,' wiping Iiio brow.

" ' As it turned out, ho did not roooivo my Btory so well as I hud expected, but this I" put down to his 'jealousy in tlio matter of 'xriondHhip. v , Hadrian was ..a good physiognomist, and anxious for liiiy unbiased opinion I " said nothing about Liidy Selwyn, but aiippod tbo portrait in with the rest of tlio sketches. In u low minutes Hudrinn, lis I cxpootcd ho would,, nsked to soo what work I hud done, so I placed tlio whole lot beforo him and waited tlio result in silence. IIo went to work in liiB usunl ungruoiouH manner, making remarks compli mentary and otherwise — mostly otherwise. In duo course lie came across tho portrait, und to iny astonishment allowed uu unexpected uequuintance witli tlio original. . " Wliy, Faloise," lie said, turning towardH me, slcotch in hand, "wliero havo you seen . Liidy Solwyn ? " . " Do you know Irar, Hadrian ? " Excellently well !

I would rattier have heard tho London his tory first, and then narrated tlio sequel;, but' Iladrinn, as I know of old, wus as Obstinate us a mule. Unless I gratified his curiosity ho certainly would not gratify inino, so with quick despntun I told him ull that lmd taken pla'co on tho previous night. Tho important detail of iny falling in lovo I withheld for tho present. I might us well liavo told it at once, for I saw Hadrian guessed tho truth from my toll- talo checks. Howovor, ho made no aign of atich knowledge, but, when I had finished tho story, looked out at the Grungo intently through the window. : Naturally I expected to ho directly addressed, hut in placo of this Hadrian begun a monologue as though ho wero nlonc. At first I felt indig nant, but as his soliloquy secmod pertinent to tho anbjeot, I listened.

As to your red star, I cannot divino its meaning; nor do . I think it ' wqrth troubling about. All ' I know for certain is that Lady Solwjrh loved Varst, and us you rssemhlo Varst, she will assuredly love you. r So tliero.you have too story." Suffi ciently commonplace, isitnot?"

"Nay,' I will liolp you to hear it." "You cannot. It Is too horriblo ! Latino go, Mr. Faloise. I cannot ! I dure not lovo you!" " Then, you do lovo mo," Without a word sho bent forward and kissed my cheok. At' that moment wo hoard tho wuiling of too aeoursed Thing, whereupon, witli a hurst of hysterical laughter, .she fled from tho .room. I followod with 'speed, hut sho had already vanished in the darkhqss, nor could my implorings call her huok'to my urms. .Tho next night too failed to appear,, but the old woman brought mo another lottor. "Pity iriy weakness, and go,'! wore tho contents, and tho paper was stainod with tears. Those tears derided my course. Notoin'g now would induce mo to leavo' tho plnc'o without soothing this sorrow. I sworo to enter the Grange, to enter that room ;whonco shone' the red. light, to discover what it was that wailed so horribly. 1 sacrificed my soul to keep that oath, but I kopt it. After a haggard night I walked up tho road at dawn to examine tho morass. If possiblo I desired to cross it and enter the Grange, but as I stood' hesitating on tho verge of too unsteady- ground a woman oricd aloud. On looking up I saw Lady Selwyn balanced above tho black . water, and in less than a minuto too was by my side. " Go away, Mr.'Faloise," sho panted, push ing mo backward. "What do you wish?" ," To enter the- Grange." " " Impossible. It is dqath to enter." "Nevertheless I will enter." " For what reason ?". \ I whispered my roply iti her ear, ns though it were too tiwesomo to bo spoken aloud/ " I wish to inarry you. That house holds Bomo horriblo seorot, which- is blighting your lifo. Let mo in. Toll mb what it. is, and I will freo you from its influence." ".There' is ho seoret," she denied, with downonst eyes.

Thon, with suddbn dofiancc, "I shall not tell you anything; nor will I seo you ngain." , ' . I would have, folded her ' iri my anus,; hut with a sudden spring too placed a portion of the morusB between us. \- " You will sink !" I oried, sick with horror, -as1 the ground quivered under her light woirfit. '."No ; I guide myself by too white stones 1" sho cullod buok. " Good-bye, Mr. Faloise. ' Do not como licro again. It means death to you and to me." With this she vanished into too houso, and daunted by that horriblo marsh I dared not follow her. Slowly I returned to toe inn. Tho east was red with too dawn, hut redder than too east burned too star from toe tall tower.' ' in. ' I determined to forco iny way into too Grango that, night. Devoured alike by lovo und curiosity- my stato of mind was favourable 'to the enterprise. 1 That it was a desporato one I gathered from the hints thrown out by Lady Sriwyni ' Thb half hystqrical life of too. pust. two weeks, in pluco of destroying my nervo, had sorowed up my courago to a point of rook- loss daring. I know, that Huch artificiality would sooner or later collapse, hut beforo too collupso came I sworo to discover, too seorot of too red star. Of suoh resolve I told no one, -not oven Euth.' but making somo trivial oxouso for -taking.a walk, strolled, up to that morass' whioh formed so effeotive t! defence , to tho Grange.' In tho soft1 Jnno twilight tho sullen marsh spread its sliminoss beforo mo. Tho inky pools of blnok water, too unlieoltoy green of tho vegotation, too graveyard nohness of tho mould, all filled mo with repugnanco. It was liko u griivo, and for aught I know might, ho miiioj seeing tout I was ignorant of tho secrot orossing. Lady Solwyii had guided her oourso by. too white stones, so for suoh lundmarlts I looked,. Thoy dotted tooblaokness irregularly, hut by following toqir ocoontriw cun-ings I mado.siu'o to nrnvo safely on tho.otoer side. I bin iiot religious, but ug I shivered on too edgo of that possiblo grave, and noted .too cvilglenm , of too rod star, I put up u hurried prayer for protection. .. Thon- I sot a cautious foot on tho spot indicated by toe first stano. ' I \- The treacherous ground quivered liko a jolly as tho blaek.hog wator oozed sluggishly round ray.fdot; Prudontly trying every rosting-placo in advanqo .with .riiy stiok, -I- sprang from one stono to aiiotlior,' over feeling too quaking of , thb quagmire. Thero was no sign of lifo about too houso; and though I half oxpootod Lady Solwyn, to issuo foito with . warning ones, sho did 'not inuke her appearance. Several times my hJart.was in my mouth ns I sllppod.on too spongy soil. But' in the end I was safely across, and found; myself on .firm -ground. I now stood fairly committed to too .adventure, for toe- morass was my Eubicon,. yet 'for .too moment -I 'felt/qualmish. ' My body counselled <rotreat,Jbut my soul / inolinod to pushing for- wurd in. tlio -oto of diingor. /. Urged 'on by this doBirb, I marolied boldly towards' too low briotwall of 'too 'house,' :i : It rah/too whole length bf the facade, ' and /the rusty-iron gate'1 in too1 centre was closely ;burred.: By looking through too' narrbw rail- tirigs I oould catch1 u glimpse of tho front, door. It stood' wide opoti, as though Lady Solwyn deemed the morass a sufficient proteotion from the outsido world ; so sooing that thoro was hut ono obstacio to ovorcomo, I pluoked up heart. Ono portion of toe dilapidated wall afforded perilous foothold. Of this I took advuntage, and not without somo abrasions of tlio knees, managed to clmnbor over. I then found mysolf directly under too red oyo of too towor. It seemed to my distempered fancy to follow iny inovoments in a stealthy -lnunnor, but undaunted by (lie bogey of suporstition, I hurried forward to too open door. Within was a mighty hull, with a wide stair case ascending into upper glooms, and so ghostly did it look Unit for tlio moment, mv spirit quailed. On recollecting, however, that tho house was but tenanted by .two weak women, I felt ashamed of my uiomontarypauic, and stole to tho foot of tho staircase. ,1 did not know iu which portion of this . vust piaeo.Lady Selwyn resided, but judging that sho would.
