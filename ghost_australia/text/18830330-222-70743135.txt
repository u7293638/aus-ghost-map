lBy Miawute J. BLovar. IasETTY ATTI- W?VTON had just finished that lovely, song " Dor.Erlkonig.!h:i The "Thankous"' and.! 0 how Lovelys" had been murmured in the tones of rapture usual on queh occasions, and linad been more or loss blushingly rcoeju', ;' hon somehow, by one of those ,tsrangO ttfns which no one can aecop?t.?cr, the corversation drifted to the .nbject of Imagination and the effect it hs on actions, and from that to Conscience.' There were a , 5hn of us in the room, a friend and m?ys' lip1;ing with Mr.' Weston, a few J' s J , *I .;",'on who had just i . -.u to Olp -, evening, and thl The discussion became gencral, and very ond had" some opinion to advance. As the subjects are necessarily vague, in about ten minutesa we had exhausted all weo did know about themn ; and then, as somebody says, we soared into tho freo and boundless realm of what we did not; bnow. ,"We argued high, .we argued low ; we also argued round about us," anidi ha every on .hnd!a:different theory on thoaquestion in-hanid, and the onea with the most'unreasondblh, idea were the most veihdmlerintin, expressing .them, we were wery far from arriving at a satisfactory conclusion: At last after many, arguments on all eides; ,Will Smith' was demonstrating forcibly to his own very e'ident, satisfaction that imagina tion is nothing"ini:the world but disordered digestion, and conscience synonymous with inactiveliver, and that a judicious course of exercise, vichy water,. abstinence from.:, tea and othdr eeciting beverages, would 'enable' a man to walk through a-graveyard at.mid. night without taking a cow for a ghost---the advantage of which is obvious-or enable him to run a man through, rob a bank, misma nagse railways: or break the whole decalogue without feeling any' of those uncomfortable prickings known as the pangs'of consceieice; ths0 advantages to! which, to tlhe world" at large, are not quite sd obvidous. ' Justithon old Mr: Linton, 'who had listened with : an attention very flattering' to thd 'speakers, drew :his chair forward' from' the corner ,wwhero' he had been sitting quletly all the evening, and said:-" I~am sorry than I cannot agree withiyou, Mr. Smith. I am an old man now;. Perhaps if I had been born in an "advanced ago" an advantage which you possess, Ii might have Iheld your views, but as it is I am old-fashioned enosugh to be lieve that conscience hans beeri 'divinely"im! planted in our breasts for our guidance, and that imagination is a distinctive faculty of iind' or brain-it is difficult to determine iliiclh-capable of greatly ennobling us if it is 'p'roperly regulated. .ut in the regulation of it', lies th'difliulty. The song Annie sang a little, while ago, and the recent conversation; call to any, remembrance a rather peculiar incident whic ihas some bearing on the subject that we have all been speaking about. I say it is,peculinarnot because there is any 'tling very strange gbout it, but because it is .uncommon. I think I heard of a similar case before, but this is. the only one that caome under my own observation." :The old gentleman paused, and. amid mur murs of "go on please," he continued:' "Eight years ago when, I was living At .Berunga. I was a magistrate there." 'My .surgery and dispensary were in the township,, but our dwelling-house, which had plenty of land ,attached, was on 'the Sadhurst' road, about 'two miles and a' half' from: Berunga. I generally returned'home about ix,' and, my son who was my partnbr, re. mained at the surgery. X had just come home one evening, and was dressing for dinner,' when the door-bell rang, and Jane, the house. maid, informed me that a gentleman wished to speak to me. ' " Some patient," I thought, " who will ex patiate on his symptoms, ad '~atc eaem.' I wish people would' not come at dinner-time. However, there is no help for it." Then aloud to the girl: " Tell your mistress not to wait dinner for me, and show the gentleman into the parlor.", In a few minutes'I en tered-the room .where I had told Jane to show the stranger.:" " I have not the pleasure-" I began, as he rose on my entrance. "My name is .'Henry Harper," said he quietly, then earnestly 'and impetuously " You are a magistrate ?/' I bowed and waited, feeling very uncom fortable, for Mr. Henry Harper was a strange. looking man of about five and thirty, very tall, very thin, deadly pale, with dark hair and unpleasantly piercing black eyes. " You must think it very strange, sir," he said, ' but I cannot-I will not offer any apologies. I did, not come-here of my own free will. I was impelled. to it, driven to it by that which 'haunts me night and day, vwaking, sleeping ;when I can sleep, every. where I go and in everything I do. i I hear it now. Oh, God, my punishment is more thni I can bear I" ' He nearly shrieked out thbd last words, and covering his face with his hands-" You, mrst hear the voice," said he, "it is louder than the roar of thunder." My face must 'have betrayed my very strong doubts as to his sanity, for he said quietly, almost sadly: "You think that I am mad. . I am not. I sometimes wish I were, then at intervals I should believe that the sounds which haunt me areounreal, but no, I am not mad, and I shall hear them till I die. I have come to you, as a magistrate, to make a confession, in the hopes of obtaining peace from Heaven, and enjoying a moment's respite from the horror that hangs over my life." Hero he spoko quite collectedly, nnd not at all like a madman. "You look' ill; let me feel.your pulse.' I am a doctor," said I.' oe did look ill, very ill. I felt his pulse.' 'It was perfectly regular' and normal, not at all feverish. His hand was very cold, but' not unnaturally so ; his eyes, too, though po Ipeculiar and piercing,; had nothing of that wild, shifty and uncertain' gaze of a madman; They were merely the eyes ol a porsone suffering great mental anxiety. In his whole bearing, however, there was a most extraordinary expression, one that I never-never saw before orsince, hnd which I cduld not defina fcr some time. Ashoturned his head while the hall clock, a veryloud one, struck seven, the attitude gave me a key to the expression, it vas that of listening, never ceasing listening,' is if every limb and muscle and nerve were enployed In it continually. The whole expressbn of face and body was a concentration of tie power of all-absorblig' listening. , But as far as myincdical experience could show, he was salo, nough. However, I heartily wished thathe would make haste with 'what Ihe had to 'sayand go. I felt I,could speal this parting guest with a great deal of pleasire. Altliough Ie,was aything but an imagina tive mann- ather natter-of.faot than other. wis?-I felt there. ys, as tho:e Scotch say, sometling " uncany"' about my visitor.; IlIe wcnton.,. ,, ., , : Itwas a.n evil dar that I ever left England.

' I landed in Melbmurne, and as:the;gold fever' wad still lingerlig about, I joined several others who were ruoingto the. Darunga !!rush."

My visitor hlad t!taken a seat whlile shying this, and.spoke in such a contained, self. posseed 'way, and as there seemed to be iothing very startling in whet he was telling, I' settled down half expecting to hear rather a prosy story; but still the listening--the in tensely listening air, the earenst black eyes, and the ghastliness of the face seemed at variance with the calm voice, and made me feel nervous every time I looked at him. Suddenly he started up, and continued ex citedly this time: ' I must liastcn'. It is driving me on.' A'c, if Icould but close my ears and brain for one miomsnt I" "Ihear nothing,," said I; " the: nightls ,very.still,eand the house is quiet."; ::1.

I doenot' know, what I said, but I struck.him I' struck him down I ' coward and madman that-I was,' and he fell: WeV had been standing, and the fact had been quite unnoticed by either ofeus, on the brink of an old and.very deep 'shaft; down whichlit -would be certain -death to fall.' He fell, ho'was stunned, and for one moment. the moon shone out to show me the white face and clenched hands. Hle fell: ''Some' earth that his fall had loosened, fell to' the bottom with a light sprinkling sound, then a stone or two, with a sharp, quick noise, then the dull heavy thud whichl sounded so dead that it :made my heart stop.!

"Poor fellow," said mywife, he is greatly to be pitied, I think the voice he speaks of must be the effects of.a heated imagination acting on his conscience. "I cannot tell," said I, " the voice to him is very real." , In the morning I went myself to Mr. Harper's bedroom, 'I knocked loudly at his door, no answer, knocked again, called loudly, still no reply. I opened the door and walked in. He was sitting on a chair by the bedside in a listening attitude, with a smile on his face--quite dead.. He had been dead for some hours... The bed was untouched.
