At the Oxfoeri. The change of management at the Oxford has not in any way detracted from ihe excellent character of the programme. Mr. Vliitburn's skit on the ghost scare Is as amusing as ever, and is unmistakably to the satisfaction of the audiences. The best features, perhaps, of an all round good show are the items ren dered by Miss Akarman. the Leonards, and Miss Fernandez, the mandolin? player.
