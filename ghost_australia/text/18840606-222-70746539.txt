I poetrp \- For tihose.' : . "Fail. ?. ,ALL honor to him who shall win the prizo, : The world has erieod for a thooueand years But to him who trie, and' whio fails,- and dies, I g great honor, and glory, and tears. Giro glory and honor, and pitiful tears To all who fail in tulir deeds sublime, Their ghosts are many in the van of years, They were born with Time in advance of Time. Oh, great is the hero who wins a name, But grenter, nInny and many a time, loena pale.fIcd fellow who dies in shame, And lets God finish the thought sublime. And great is the man with a sword undrawn, And good is the man who refrains from wine; B1t the oan who faili and yet etill fights on, Lo, bho is the twinhborn brother of mine.
