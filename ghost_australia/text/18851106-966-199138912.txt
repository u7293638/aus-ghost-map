Victoria R a c i n g Club. OAKS DAY. TBy Telegraph. J Flemington, November 5. ["From our Special Keporfcar.J The off-day, generally the most pleasant of the Spring Meeting, was attended to-day with disagreeable weather, a high wind blowing, accompanied by clouds of dust, The attendance was 8mall in comparison with other days, and the racing was very poor. Several hot favourites were beaten, but there was not much betting on the Flying Stakes and Steeplechase. An accident occurred in the last race, through which three horses fell in front of the Stand. Fortunately none of the riders were hurt. The horses- which fell were Doncaster, Grace Darling, and Kingship, and the former was killed on the spot. Only four went to the post for the Maiden Plate, and liberal odds were laid on the New Zealand colt, Winchester. The race was run at a very slow pace, the favourite leading all the way, but Derritt very nearly threw the race away through easing Winchester up the last few strides. Ffew of the bookmakers would field against Acme at any price, and this was fortunate for backers, as the boy could not manage her at all, and Bhe was never in the race. Blairgowrie and Maddelina were always in front, and the Sydney colt won easily at the finish. The time was very slow, owing to the horses having to face a gale of wind. Sixteen numbers were hoisted for the Spring Handicap. At the finish St. John was made a hot favourite, but Cerise-and- Blue, Lantern, Chuckster, and Lesbia were heavily backed. Lavington made the pace a cracker from the jump. At. the home turn there were only five in it> but the severity of the race just suited Cerise-and-Blue, who, steered by her light weight, had no difficulty in going to the front at the distance and winning easily by two. lengths from Velocipede and Lavington. Only five weighed out for the Royal Park Stakes, aud odds were laid on Trenton. The race was only run in the last six furlongs, but even at this handicap Trenton had no difficulty in settling the opposition. First Chester and Isonomy both cut up very badly. After the second race Joseph Thompson was brought before the Stewards for using abusive language to a gentleman in the paddock, and the Leviathan was ordered to apologize, the Chairman at the same time informing Thompson that if he came before the Stewards again he would be warned off the course for ever. The Ring were content to take 2 to 1 that Uralla went down in the Oaks, but Hales took the mare to the front, and sailing along rom end to end she won in a canter by two lengths. The Steeplechase was an amusing farce. The presence of Dsnmark frightened the owners of Bob Cooper, Lady Ashton, and Meander into scratching their horses, and only the very moderate Trickett and The Banker opposed the crack. Denmark led them over two fences, and then down he came, and made for the sheds. Even then he would have had time to win, but after being caught he came as far as the Stand and fell once more. About the same time Trickett and The Banker both fell. The former was the first up, but his rider stuck to the Btraight instead of coming inside and jumping the last two fences. The Banker in the meantime was caught and completed the course, with Dsnmark second. A protest was at once entered against Trickett, and the race was awarded to The Banker. A large field weat to the post for the Veteran Stakes, Britisher, Ceriseand-Blue, The Agent, Metal, and others being freely supported. The start was a very bad one, aud after they had gone 100 yards Grace Darling fell and brought down Doncaster and Kingship, while Comet collided with one of the falling horses ndgot rid of his rider. Cerise-and-Blue, The Agent, and Britisher were the first into the straight, and after an interesting set-to Britisher won by a length. The following are the details :— MAIDEN PLATE. A sweepstafces of 10 sovs. each, 2 ft., with 250 added. The second horse to receive SO sors. out of the stake. For three-year-olds and upwards Weight for age. One mile and a half, Hon. W.

Directly the ward was given Winchest9? took up the running from Parwan and Cyclops, and made play round the turn at a very slow pace, Percussion bringing np the rear. Along the back the order was the same, and no attempt was made to go to the leader until coming to the torn, when Cyclops moved np and entered the straight on Winchester's girths, with Parwan and Percussion also closing. At the distance Winchester had the race won, but Derritt eased up before reaching the post, and Sanders seeing this made a rush on Cyclops, who was only beaten by half a neck. Two lengths off Parwan was third, with Percussion last. Time, 2 min. 64J sec. THE FLYING STAKES. A sweepstakes of 6 sovs. each, 1 ft., with 200 added.

The favourite got off very badly, Maddelina, Blairgowrie, and chesham being the first away, and as (.they came on Acme was seen to be swerving &U; over the course with her tiny pilot. At the tan Blairgowrie and Maddelina were in front, and as they came to the course proper Acme took third place, but she immediately cut in towards the rails and lost all chance. Blairgowrie was now left with the lead, and he held it to the end, winnir.g e^iiy by two lengthy (rom Mad delina, who beat Chesham three lengths for second place.

They were kept at the post some time, but at last Mr. Watson was successful in dropping his flagto a splendid start. Velocipede, Camerina, and Lavington were the first to begin, and Lavington at once took np the running from Camerine, with Velocipede, Chucksfr, Cerise-and-Blue, and St. John heading the others. At the bridge Lavington was going on from Camerine, Velocipede, ana Ceriseand-Blue, with t1. John. Chuckster, and Lantern at the head of the others, Merman being strung out in the rear. Lavington was leading a full three lengths along the back stretch, but at the abattoirs Lantern and Ceiise-and-Blue drew nearer to him, the others being headed by Velocipede, Gratitude, and Camerine. There was no change passing the sheds, aud Lavington led to the tarn, but Cerise-and- Blue caught him entering the straight, and Velocipede, St. John, and Merrimu were the only others left with a chance- At the distance Cerise-and-Blue was well in front from Lavington, Velocipede, and St. John, and the lightly weighted four-year-old going on at her ease won by two lengths from Velocipede, who beat Lavixgton by a neck for second place. Then came Merrimn fourth, St John fifth,Camerine sixtb, with Merman last all the way. Time, 2 min. 10J sec. THE ROYAL PAKE STAKES.

They left the pott at the slowest of canters, Trenton and Isonomy being in f.ont until entering the course proper, when the fivealmost pulled into a walk, .end passing the Stand Dunlop and Trenton were in front, with the others together, the lot proceeding at a very slow santer, and the crowd calling out to the riders to go on.

Trickett then went on. with a long lead of Banker, and they got on safely enough until a mile from home, when both fell. Denmark, in the meantime, had been remonnted, but at the second of the^ quadruple he fell again. Trickett was remounted, and eventually Banker waa-got eoing, while Kildu&waa; quickly in the saddle. Trickett then had matters his own way, but his rifiei went the wrong course, thereby missing the last of the fences.
