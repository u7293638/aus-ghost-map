A -strange faltering stopped me as I said this; a -curious dim feeling mat there were hidden possibilities in my heart; dreams that I might have dreamt ; feelings that would have brought nty mind nearer akin to my mother's mind, if things had been different. . The look of absolute distress in his face made me uflbappy, and I tried to make amend6 for my silly 'speech. '.'..'' ' Why should yon be shoeked because I am not rowwafcic V I asked. ?' I don't think you are a very romantic person either. We have known : eacfe other ail our lives, and' we ought to be very , happy together by-and-bye. Is that not enough, Cyril?' ; ' N«t anite.' he- answered.' graver than I Viad ever seen nun until tbat moment, 'but I sappoM it isall I shall get, so I must be satisfied.' [ Yesterday afternoon I amused myself with an exploration. It was a lovely afternoon, almost summer-like, though we are still in the time of hyacinths, and the beeches hare not yet unfolded their tender young leaves. Mother had geno to London' with ner. husband to look at the drawing rooms, which are receiving their finishing touches ' at the hands of the decorators, and I had all the day to myself. I spent the whole morning at my studies, working upon asynopsisof Duruy's history of the Greeks, which Uncle Ambrose advised me to write, firstly, to impress historical facts upon my mind; secondly, to cultivate style ; and thirdly, to' acquire the power of arranging and condensing stibject^Mtli neatneBs and facility. It is rather dry woi-ic, but I like it, and I adore the Greeks. I have been reading Ebers's Egyptian story be tween whiles, and. I think that has helped me to realise the atmosphere of that bygone age when Pisistratus was ruling at Athens, aad Croesus w&a; discoursing wisely upon his fallen fortunes at tht Court of Amasis. I -finished my work before lunch, which is an absurd meal when mother is away. A mere scram ble with the dogs, who come in to keep me com pany, and clear my plate under my nose. Di rectly after -lunch I to«k up my hat to go out, whereupon Sappho and Ponto, my darling Irish setters, went mad, and nearly knocked me down in their delight at the idea of a ramble with me. We had explored every lane, copse, and com mon within four miles of Biver Lawn, so I wanted, if -I possibly could, to give the dogs a change; and! thought I would venture to peep in at Fountain Head, where the Bhrubberies are fall of primroses at this season. The -Fountain Head gardener and out under gardener are great friends, and I have often talked to him when he has been in our grounds. 1 know the old housekeeper, too, so I had no com punction in. opening a little gate in the shrubbery which gives on to the narrow lane that divides bur property from Mr. Florestan's. There is a grand entrance on the Henley-road, and high iron gates, and a rustic lodge with a thatched roof and the deareBt old chimney stack. The gardener's family live in this lodge, but the big gate is only opened when Mr. Florestan is at home, and that is very seldom. He told me lie meant to be oftener at Fountain Head in the future. He feels himself growing too old for a roving life. I suppose he must be at least nine and-twenty, which is certainly old compared with Cyril and me. How nice it is to be young — to feel oneself quite young, and how sad it must be when weariness jand age begin to creep over one. lam miserable sometimes when I think that mother will grow old before I do — that I shall soe the shadows stealing over that dear and lovely face — the ehadows that foretell the end. Oh, that L- the bane of life, that is what makes life not worth living — the knowledge that death, is waiting some where on that road we know not — the gray mys terious highway of the future — waiting for those we love.

I had my pocket Dante with me, meaning to fcry and fancy myself in the Pine Forest, near Ravenna, where he used to meditate, but; the book was so far true to its name that it never left tny pocket. I seemed to have so much to think about j and a spring Afternoon, with light cloud lets floating in a pale blue sky, and the perfume of violets in the air sets all one's most fanciful fancies roaming far and wide, I think my thoughts , were light as thistledown or vanity that afternoon, or they could never have strayed so far ; and yet there was a touch of sad ness in them, for I could not help thinking ' of Gilbert Florastan and bis sad position, quite alone in the world, mother and father both lying still and dumb, as my dear father lies still in his grave under the willows — no sister or brother, no one to c&refpr; lvw, or to lean upon him. No doubt he has cousins, as I have. 1 have not quite made up my mind whether cousins are a necessary evil or a modified kind of Wessing. I'm afraid if I stood alone in the world as he does. . Dora and Flora would not fill a large gap in my. life. I rambled in the shrubberies and the dear old fashioned gardens till I was tired, and then I began to feel the keenest curiosity about the in side of the house. It is not a pretty house, but it is old and digni fied. When one has come but lately from a city of palaces one can hardly be altogether alive to the beauty of an old English mansion, with moss grown walls and deep-set windows,' and a general grayness and low tone of color which some people find eo dispiriting. Yet the house touched me by a kind of mournful beauty, and a sense of quiet desolation such as I felt only a few weeks ago when I looked at' those old neglected mansions upon some of the smaUfer canals, so gloomy in their grandeur, us of the dead irrevocable past. I have felt sometimes as if I would give worlds to be able to buy one of those degraded, dilapidated old places, and to clear away all its parasite growth of petty modern uses, and to restore it to the splendor and beauty of 3flfi years ago. And yet I have shuddered at the thought of the phantoms that might come crowding round me in- those great grand rdoms, of all the dead people who might' awake at the sound of music and laughter in the house where they were once young and merry, I walked up and down the broad gravel ter1 race in front of Mr. Florestan's house. It stands, only about 20ft above the . level o£ tbft river bank, and a wide lawn slopes gently frem the house to ike river. I ooufd see the boats go*»8 fcy, mnAhaait theopoioea of the rowers, wkiah were a relief alter tbe uncanny feeling thai ; tutA-Qrept over me wfcile I was in tiie great ev«rgE«wn garden aa the other side of the house.

Not all the wealth of the Indies could create snch a house. It is the slow growth of time, like the golden ? brown lichens and cool gray raosses-on the garden walls. , I roamed and roamed about the rooms on the ground floor, opening one into another, quaintly inconvenient, with queer little doors, half wains cot and half wall paper; rooms without the faintest pretension to splendor or dignity, rooms that suggest the world as Miss Edgeworth and ; Miss Austen knew it, a world in which people dined at 0 o'clock, and danced country dances, and played on the spinet, and painted -on velvet, j and talked about the luncheon- tray and the ! Britska. ! I looked at all the ornaments on all the tables ! and chimney-pieces, the things our grandmothers j loved ; cardboard hand- screens, with pencil land- | scapes — Craigmiller castle, Guy's Cliff— spill- | boxes. What are spills, by the way? Old I albums and scrap-books, old work baskets lined with faded satin. Everything was arranged as neatly as it had been fifty years ago, when Mr. Floreetan's grandmother was mistress of the house, and these were her things, most of them. Bis mother's room had a more modem look, yet even there the books, desks, and workboxes were old-fashioned. How quickly the fashion of this Ef e passes away. At first I was too much interested and amused to feel the uncanny influences of those empty rooms full of things that had belonged to people who were all dead ; but presently that air of long RfgSj together with ike dag&s;&ke; sSeBoe ofesfche bouse, begsn to a£Eeafe. «jjg^^iritB.

I was idiot enough to mistake reality for appa rition. In that moment of*ersor I believed -that the figure standing there looking at me with a quiet smile was the ghostly semblance of the dead man whose picture I had contemplated so long. ' Pray, forgive me, for startling you,' said Mr. Florestan, offering- me his hand in the easiest way, aad not allowing me to see tbat he thought me an idiot, as he must have done ; ' I ought to have given you some notice of my arrival. Ton were so absorbed in my f ather'-s picture that you did not hear his son's footsteps.'

I had a secret conviction that Sappho and Ponto had gone peaceably home to the stables, but the dogs made a decent excuse to get me out of the house. ' I feel sure they won't do the slightest harm,' he said, ' but if you are the least bit uneasy ou that score we'll go and look for them together, and then perhaps your mother will take pity upon a tired traveller and give me a cup of tea.' ' I am so dreadfully sorry,' I said, ' mother is in London, and won't be home much before .8. 'ThafB a sad disappointment. I had looked forward to seeing her this afternoon.' We went out at the hall door together, and we explored the shrubberies and garden, but saw no sign of the dogs. He went home with me, and we found Sappho and Ponto in their kennels, whither they had returned half an hour before. Then from the stable yard we wandered naturally to the garden, where the basket chairs and tables had been set out in the usual place on the ter race, in honor of the lovely afternoon. The foot man came out with the tea tray, and arranged it, while we, Mr. Florestan and I, were standing looking at the river. ~ Servants are. so officious. I had happened to say at luncheon that if tine day continued fine I thought I would have tea in the garden, and here was the man setting out the cups and saucers under.

'Perhaps, as mother isn't here, you'll allow me to give you a cup of tea,' I said. He accepted eagerly. I almost hoped he'd take it standing, and go away directly he had emptied the cup.
