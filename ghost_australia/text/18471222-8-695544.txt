German Jurisprudence An extraordinary circumstance occurred at a recent sitting of one of the courts of justice at Ulm, in Wurtemburg. A peasant named Louis Rndstecher, of the village of Raethel, was about to be tried for having killed another peasant of the same village. In answer to the questions of the presiding judge, he energetically denied his guilt. The judge told him that he had confessed it before the examining magistrate, when he said that he had done so on account of the mortal torture to which the examining magistrate had subjected him. " This magistrate, he went on to say, threw in my face the hands of the murdered man, which had been cut off his corpse. He also showed me two ribs of the corpse, and said that if I did not avow the crime of which I was accused the dead man would appear at night before my bed, and would say to me, " Louis, Louis! restore me the life you have taken 1" The magistrate then asked me if I believed in ghosts, and, on my answering in the affirmative, told me that a great number of them would come and drag me into hell if I did not confess! Terrified at these threats, I confessed all that he wanted, and afterwards signed my confession !" The examining magistrate was immediately summoned before the court, and as he admitted that he had employed the means of intimidation stated by the prisoner, the court declared the examination null and void, and postponed the case for three months. It then addressed to the Minister of Justice a report of the conduct of the examining magistrate. Gang name. The Third-rate Actors have been in the profession about ten years, and, by the stupidity of murderers and the ignorance of the public, I am designated a third-rate actor; all I have to say about this is, that neither managers nor the public know much about the matter, and time will show who is right. My present object is to lay before the reader a plain unvarnished tale of the sufferings of that class of actors of which I am one, and thus I begin. I have frequently to fight a " desperate combat," when suffering from rheumatism in my right shoulder, with the dreadful certainty of an encore, while my antagonist, in robust health, keeps slashing away at me " without remorse or dread." It is also my duty to stand to be sung at (by a lady, of course,) through a long dull song of half an hour's length, at the end of each verse I have to clasp her hand, smile, and look at the ceiling in short, I strike as many attitudes as would fill out the Grecian statues, and get no thanks for my pains ! I have occasionally to support on one arm, mind-the heaviest lady of the establishment, during a long screaming hysterical faint, the other being fully employed in levelling a blunderbuss and robber, demon, seducer, or some such person. But this is not all on being pursued, obliged to carry the said lady to the' summit of a frightful precipice," and it being the end of the act, there I must remain, till blue fire and the drop puts an end to my sufferings. The Magazine of the Muses. Female Loquacity. - Jean Paul says, that a lady officer, if she wanted to give the word " halt" to her troops, would do it somewhat in this wise : " You soldiers, all of you, now mind, I order you, as soon as I have finished speaking, to stand still, every one of you, on the spot where you happen to be; don't you hear me? half, I say, all of your"
