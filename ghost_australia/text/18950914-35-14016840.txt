Other legislativo subjects como in thoir turn to bo practically doalt with and carriod through thoir stages, but so far tho greatest of all, the ono which makes tho broadest appoal to the sonso of citizenship and tho fooling of patriotism, is troatod as too holy a thing to bo profaned by being givon otfoct to ia prac- tico. Its placo romains in tho sphero of rhotorio and decorativo oloquonco. Federation, with its magnifioont possi- bilities, is so truly an opoch-making siibjeot that it seems a thousand pitios the "imtnonsitios " of it should be occasionally belittled by tho intriguos of local politicians. " It is easy," says a oharaotor in an old French comedy, " to bo serious ou a serious occasion," and ho bursts out laughing in tho face of a charlatan priost who is mouthing roligion to a group of rustics. And so it lias fared with many of tho promoters of Föderation. It is somotimos assumed, with littlo shrowdness, that thoro is a natural levity ia tho Australian eharnctor, and our want of veneration is proverbial amongst thoso who do not know us. But ovou if tho cbargo wero truo, ono might plead as an excuso that of the comedy. It is a littlo difficult to doTolop tho bump of vonoratiou sans an objoot of vonoration, and though faith has boon cynically doscribod as " tho faculty to beliovo that whioh wo know to bo untruo," it may bo doubted whother tho opigram has oven a suspicion of truth when applied to Fodoration. Iudeod, it is only too obvious that it has not. Tho great heart of tho pooplo turns not towards it, nor probably is tho alluring schomo dreamt o£ in tho philosophy of one elector out of a hundred at olection limo. His suffragos aro won or lost on quito othor grounds, aud though with sounding rhetoric and tinsol sonti uiout ho is besought to think of this matter o£ nation-building on occasions, no ono can doubt that ho turns a deaf car to tho supplication. In rioiut of fact, tho voico of tho charuior charms no longor, and ovon as a red herring across tho troublod path of politics Federation is scontless. lu tho slang of tho day the question is not within tho nebulous roalm of " practical politics." And yet thoro is, or ought to bo, no possibility of doubt of tho value and neces- sity of an oarly awakening. "Whatovor cansos havo contributed to tho apathy does not concern us much now-whether it is the transparonco of politicians or the unonlightonod selfishness of parochialism iii tho Govornmonts themselves. But what is certain is tho pressing neces- sity of tho work. wo Bhall bo told, of courso, that wo aro still young, and that all our days lie boforo us ; but that will bo merely the easily recognised voico of tho adherents of the disastrous laissez faire policy. If our own youth is granted, it will havo to bo admitted that tho rest of tho world is par- ticularly groy and old, and hungry for torritory, and deadly oagorfor safety- valvos for 'overcharged populations to boot. If wo aro dotorminod to lot " things " take thoir own course, wo may bo tolerably cortain that somo day tho courso will not bo much to our liking. Tho " practical man," who is commonly so utilitarian that his ogo bounds his montai horizon, may speak of Foderatiou as Philis- tines speak of poetry, but wiso mon look behind and bofore. Tho map of tho world has suilored such startling changos before now that fow but tho foolishly optimistic would vonturo to prophes3' for thoso coionios alono exomption from geogra- phical exploitation. Or at any ralo, if that is to ho tho fortunato rosult it will not como as n consequence of tho disre- gard of all precautions. In the East one nation has alrondy sprung into tho posi- tion of a first-clnss Power, parleying with tho notions of tho West almost on equal torms, and to-day h or journals oponly advocate tho annexation of Australia. China, with Japan in hor sido, is not likely to becomo less, but moro formid- able, ns a fighting Power ; and, within n fow days' sail, it should bo obvious that thoso two Powers, which in tho quick re- volution of timo may bocomo hostilo at any moinont, form of thomsolves a most cogent roason for tho drawing togothor of the Australian States. Ii lias oflon boon said that an imminent danger would causo tho colonies to fedo rato°in 2'1 hours. That prophocy may bo truo, hut, truo or othorwiso, tho necessity that forcod tho suddon amalgamai ion could not but bring startling oxporionces in its train. Doubtless whilst England mninlains hor supromacy on tho soas we aro tolerably secure against suddon attack, although it should not ho forgotten that tho samo foicos that oporatod to bring Japan to tho front have immoasurably complicated Englnnd's foroign policy. Hor Eastern Question has now roached gigantic proportions, and at any momoul tho jealousy of tho gioat Continental Powors might induco China or Japan to attempt armod colonisation. What would tho position of thoso colonies bo then ? England would havo her own hands full all ovor tho world, and ono nood not bo thougkt pessimistic or unpatriotic in supposing that tho bottor caro wo took ¡ of oursolves tho bottor wo should faro. Militniy exports havo pointod out how singularly open wo aro to attack ; and indoed it (loos no1 requiro groat astuteness to BOO that, oither as a nation oí- an integral part of the Empiro, time will forco us to adopt somo concortod and ndequato systom of dofonco. In certain phases history repeats itself with unfailing regularity. No nation over booanio grout, or, aohieviug groatnoss, maintained it without at somo period having roconräo to tho sword. As Princo BISMARCK said tho othor day, tho sss-ord is tho groatost nrbitor of all timo. That is tho aphorism of. tho man of blood and iron, nnd need not alarm us too seriously. At tho samo timo it is truo, and if pooplo could roaliso tho truth bohind tho réclame of wiro-pulling politicians it svould bo woll. But wo should bo far from resting tho coso for fodoration on tho singlo argument of self-dofonco. That is in a sonso tho most poroniptory argument, but it is less octual and moro remoto than many othors whioh como homo to our daily lifo. "Wo aro mado to fool in a thousandfold ways how nrlificinl and unroal aro tho haphazard boundaries which divido Aus- tralia into provincos, and how tho grosv ing community of interest is moro and moro submerging theso divisions. "Wo ovory yonr find oursolvos forced to com- bino in common action in respect to mattors in which wo ennuot act as soparato and independent Statos, oaoh going its own road, and tho logical conclusion from this necessity ought to bo tho provision of a federal authority to moot it. Australia is ovory year bocoming loss and less a "moro geographical or pression," but a concroto reality, and that dopreciatory oxprossion comes moro and moro to designate tho colonios. In tho provinces of legislation nud law adminis- tration, in regard to our financial interests, in rcspoct to tariff, railway ond marino administration, in rospect to our relations to tho Imporial Government and to foreign Powors, wo fool moro and moro tho nocossity of boing ablo to speak with tho singlo voieo of a united pooplo. "Whilo tho highly im- portant intorost of defonco is a con- tingent ono, theso which wo havo cited aro suggested to us by tho noods of ovoryday life. No doubt it is a little difficult to deciphor bohind tho munioipal squabblos abont differential rates and border duties tho loom of tho largor issues. And botwoen tho parly that insists that intornal reform must talco placo first, and tho party that will postpono every- thing local till federation lias dawned, thoro is little to cliooso. If Nono svero for a party, And all for the State, iutornal administration and tho welding togothor of tho colonios might talco placo simultaneously. It may bo hopod that tho sontimont of tho poople will yot bo trained to realiso that possibility. 'Tho broadouing nnd dooponing of social lifo aro not to bo ovorlookod in the pur viow of federation. Tho nood for octivo rosistanco to foreign aggres- sion may novor ariso, and on that scoro wo might content to remain a hugo parish of a straggling community. But art and litoraturo and scienco, and, it may bo added, manners and morals, do not find their fullest dovolopmont in Statos contiguous, but closoly wallod by differing aims and aspirations. The quickening of national lifo, groat and magnificent as it is in tho plonitudo of its accomplishment, is usually tho rosult of many homely utilitarian considerations ; and whilst thoso considerations sharply outlino tho iutorcsts of small States thoy chock tho larger grosvth of culture. A poot of Mr. LOWELL'S poculiar genius might find a thomo for his Batirio Muso in our border duties, but ono can scarcoly conçoive of an Australian LoNorEnow or a WiiiTTiER under present conditions. It is truo that poets aro born, not mado, but even tho divino afflatus must bo appropriately onsphorod, Tho truth is discorniblo in American and in Gorman history, and one has only to turn to tho rocords to realise tho immonso activity that sot in in ovory department of sociology and litoraturo in each of thoso countries whon the Statos governors and tho potty princelings had at last como to bo recognised as moro ser- vants of an Empire. Tho prospoct is not loss inviting with us. Whon tho sottlor of tho Northorn Territory fools that his dostiny is one with tlio citizen of Adelaide, wo, too, Bball bo ablo to soizo and uso all our resources instead of splitting and wasting thom iu fragments, Tho notion of tho Government in pro- claiming a day of publio humiliation aud prayor for rain is not without precedent in our records. Like tho tsvo 2'roco^mg instances it marks tho extraordinarily dry character of tho soason, and at tho samo timo it makes publio acknowledgment of de- pendence on somothing outsido oven Stato control. Thoro is a spocios of intollectunl priggism rather rifo just now which would call in question tho roosonabloiioss of the Stato taking tho action it has dono in a matter Uko this, but objection of thal kind can hardly bo allowed lo havo any practical weight. Tho Stato is tho community acting through its poli- tical loaders, aud au onormous preponderance of that oommunity is mado up of pooplo who boliovo in thoir dopon donco on a Powor outsido tho visible solióme of things. Eopresontativos of that boliof in the persons of a deputa- tion of clorgynion have waitod on tho Promior to request that it should havo public expression, and tho Promior lias complied. Ordinarily, some othor day than Sunday has boen sot apart for purposos of this kind, and tho cessation as tar ns possiblo of customary businoss has marked tho occasion. Nothing has boon interfered with by selecting Sunday oxeopt, perhaps, the order of church services, and somo of the loaders of tho Churches havo already sanctioned that selection. It may bo argued that this particular choice of a day for humiliation and prayor is somothing in tho nature of a compromiso botsvoon tho modern socular spirit and thoso who would havo rojoicod to co-oporato in such a movement in sackcloth and ashes. On the othor hand, it maybe contondod that the Govern- ment has "shown judgment in issuing its proclamation in torms which will necessitate no intorforonco with public or private business, and yot whioh havo mot tho rcquost of tho deputation to tho ontiro satisfaction of tho Ohurchos. "Wo aro not awaro that tl.o Govornmont is colled on to cliooso botsvoen theso tss'o nscrihoblo motives, any moro than it is expected to defond its action in complying with tho request of a majority of tho community. Thoro sooms to bo a good doal of mis- conception about what has boon said as to tho efficacy of prayer for rain or, indeed, prayor for anything else. A shallow clovornoss has mado pretonco of discover- ing that wo havo lost touch with Iho CREATOR, and managed somehow to mis- lay among tlio discovorios of rocont scienco that instinct of rolianco on tho supernatural which is OB much a natural habit of tho human raco as respi- ration or hunger. Many learnod mon, who havo been by no moons shallow, havo como to cortaiu conclusions from oscor tainnblo ¡ihonomona-conclusions which, in so far us thoy rofor to tlio supernatural, aro almost always of a nogativo order to which this kind of clovornoss has un- hesitatingly given positivo expression. It has dono much to niako capacity for I incrodulity appear a credential of good | sonso, and professions of faith unfashion- able. It has talton away .what PvOBESriEnnE and his cliquo called tho Eire Supreme ; but it has loft us iu its placo tho " cnsh-noxus." 'Tho substituto is a valu nblo ono in the absonco of anything olso, and arguments addrcssod to thal primal motivo may bo intolligiblo to thoso who find somothiug anachronistic in tho idea of proclaiming a day for public prayors for rain. From this" utilitarian point of viow, thou, tho action of tho üovornmont may bo accepted as a public acknowledgmont of tho inllueuco of tho Churches on tho sido of all thoso ogoucios which make for public and private morality, for public ordor, and for tho habit of fair dool- ing between man and man. Tho " ensh noxus" is an admirablo thing in its way, but for all practical purposes it is usually ropresontod by credit. Take that away and wo should soon ceaso to hoar anything of tho " cash-noxus," but if confidence in honost3' and honour wore withdrawn nil credit would quickly disappear. Tho inlluonco of the Churches is gonorally on tho sido of thoso things which mako for honest and honourable citizenship, and tho State loses nothing by oucouraging that inlluonco. Tho question of tho ofTicaoy of prayer for rain is not an arguablo one. In all agos and in all countries, aB in ovory grado of civilisation, whatovor oboali or god wos worshipped, tho raco hns always petitioned the objoot of its ro ligious vonorotion in its nocossitios. Simi- larly, tho raco has always venerated soiuothing, whether joss or JEHOVAH. Nothing is moro inslinctivo and charac- teristic of humanity thon tho tacit or activo boliof in somothing out sido solf and what is seen, unless it bo tho ovormastoring impulso to havo rocourso to it in timo of necessity or griof. It has ]>assed into a truism that "-ovory man, if pain, disease, or sorrow striko him, " Is almost sure there is a God, or something very uko lum." Culturo may modify or direct the impulso, giving it various forms thnt range anysvhoro betwoon tho sound of tho tom-toms of tho savago and / tho music of tho Sistino. Military genius or its soldior-liko équiva- lent may swoop ono form of such an impulse, as it existed in tho brain of a masterful opiloptio like MAHOMMED, over two continonts and nearly ovor n third. Or it may bo the gorm of a creed dostiuod to flower upward from the Catacombs until it ovorshadow tho oarth. In all its forms it is tho. expression of a primal instinct, and it is as fatuous to condemn the principle of player as it would bo to deny tho precossion of" tho equinoxes. To apply the principio as tho proclamation of tho Qovornment applios it is to do some- thing striotly in aocordanco with Scriptural teaching and procèdent, and it is difficult to seo how tho inspiration of tho Scriptures can boaccoptedbythosowho argue against prayor for rain. Tho mental attiludo of thoso who dony both is compréhensible, but in tho other caso tho one thing flatly contradicts tho othor. "When Dr. MOOR- HOUSE mado his remarkable reference to this subject of prayer for rain a fow yoars ago in Victoria, some 'misunderstanding was caused by tho way in which his observations woro intorprotod. The point ho aimed at making liad roforonco to the dilatorinoss of colonists in helping thomsolves iu tho matter of periodical scarcity of water by an intelli- gent system of water - conservation and irrigation. To lot tho lessons of oxporionce go on without learn- ing anything struck him ns boing un- worthy of Australian citizons, and to mako a habit of potitioning tho DEITY to savo thom from tho consoquoncos of thoir own lasBitudo or stupidity soomod to him somothing worse. But there is nothing in all this to discrodit such n move- ment as that to which tho ChurohoB will devoto themselves to-morrow, which lias nothing in common with tho idoa of the practice of prayer that oncourages a habit of neglecting responsibilities, in tho hopo that PROVI- DENCE may bo iuovod to como in later on and assumo thora. On somowhat of tho world-old principio ombodiod in tho phrnso nous revenons toujours à nos premiers amours, it is pretty to find Mr. GEORGE COITIN making his final bow to the Legislativo Council of Victoria, of which ho has boon a valued member for considerably over tho lifotimo of a wholo generation, in good old dramatic fashion. Tho rotiring stago-favourito takes his leave amid popular plaudits, and the drawn curtains behind him hardly shut out from his ears tho familiar muaio as ho goos. Tho oxigonoios of practical politics, to tnko a liborty with anothor fino old phraso, procludod that sort of thiug in Mr. COPPIN'S caso, but for all practical purpusos tho samo offoot oxactly was secured by his valodiotory letter to tho President "of the Legislativo Council. Jt is ourious to bo reminded, as that lottor does remind us, of tho projudico ho oncountored on his first ontranco into public lifo thirty-soven years ago. Tho Molbourno of thoso days was the Molbourno of tho gold fever, and the scone of very rudimontary essays indeed in the working of Parliamentary institu- tions, llosponsiblo government was only two yoars old, and it was hardly moro than Bevon since the first nows of tho gold discovory bogan to attract population to Port Phillip. Oddly nssortod and hetero- geneous as that population was, it still carried its prejudices with it, apparently ; for tho rotiring Councillor rocnlls for us how tho idoa of an actor being roturnod to Parliament mot with anything but uni- versal, popular nccoptance, while the fnct that a comodian and tho representativo of " Paul Pry " on tho boards had boon intruded by the nowly-iniind franchiso into tho Legislativo Council specially shocked a certain sensitivo portion of tho public sontimont. Aitor a record of sor vico porhnps unprocodontodly long, it is odd in its way to find that this survival of an almost prehistoric legislativo poriod sees nothing moro noteworthy at tho close of liis cai cor than tho fact that ho ovor enmo and livod down such a piojudico. And yet, looked at from tho propor point of viow, thoro is samething na significant in a fact liko this as in most of tho olhors that illustrate tho progress and liberal dovolopmonl public opinion has undorgono during tho Bpaco of oven ono generation. Porhaps in no way has this liberalising and broadening tendonoy bottor BIIOWII itself than in tito quenching of prejudice against tho representativos of coitaiu call- ings. The conventional popular tradition that mado ovory actor a barn-stormor by grado and a pariah by casto, had its origin in somothing very doünito iudood. Prob- ably tho buffoons who stainod thoir faces with wino-loos and plnyod thoir pranks in Thespis' enrt wero not coutont with tho offerings of comestibles with which tho grntifiod Groek yokols rewarded thoir olforts to amuse. This kind of income was uncertain at tho host, nud depended on tho caprico of thoir patrons. Much handior must it often havo como to theso poor players to holp thomsolves, and littlo wondor is it if thoir ros_ in this diroction brought thom into"confuct with a virtuous poasantiy That is as it may bo , but it is certain that aa old stn. tuto in England mado tho actor a rotmo and vagabond, whom it was tho duty 0f tho Lucios and Shallows of the day to soizo and sot in tho stocks, whilo in Franco eo great a classic as MOLIÈRE was domed Christian burial as an actor, undor tho canonical law of tho ponod. So sonóos woro tho social consequonccs of npncarini» onthoboauls that m tho îoign of Lomj XTV tho GiamU llonmquc had to issua a special edict in favour of a nolilo lady named Madomoiscllo DE CAsnm boforo she could moko a îecoid for horsolf as tho first femalo singoi on tho stage of tho Pans opera That edict solemnly ossured tho univorso that tho lady, by special loyal gi aco, lost nothing of hor titla of uobihts, 01 of tho pnvilogos, rights and immunities of hei ordoi, although sho consented to dolight her friouds and tho Couit in public So that when " Paul Pry " found himself compelled to uttor his characteristic catoh phinso in oil seriousness at the doois of tho Victorian.
