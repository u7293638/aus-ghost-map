Wo stated recently, on tho authority of a reinaik attiibutecl in oui report to Sir JAMES M'CULLOCH, that the funds required by tho company now being formed to undertake the exportation of frozen meat had been very nearly sub Bcnbed, and that consequently the quea tion whether operations should be car ned on m Victoria or New South Wales would shortly press for settlement There appears, however, to have been some inisstatement or misapprehension as to the present state of the share list, for we have been since informed that out of the £100,000 capital needed only .£40,000 has been promised as yet We must say that, having regard to the im portance of the trade which the pro moters desire to establish, wo aro astonished at the slow progress made Seeing how many aro interested, either as graziers, merchants, 01 shipowners, m placing meatamong8tout staple articles of export,we should have thought thit every share would have been eageily taken up within a few days Over three weeks have now elapsed since it was lesohed to constitute tho association, and yet subsciibeis aie not forthcoming foi the compaiatnely paltiy amount at which the capital has been fi\ed In endeatounng to account for this extraordinary display of lndifTeience, wo have to considei what effect the exist- ing uncertainty with îegard to tho stock ta\ is likely to have on the pro ceedings of those contemplating îmeat nieiit At fust sight, it appears as though the effect should be nu Troni the commencement it Ins been publicly announced that the operations of the company will be conducted wherever the circumstances give promiso of tho most successful results At tho meeting held on the 1st of April, Mr 1 AIR« vu f said -" The companys operations wera " not to be confined to " Victoria They intended to buy " their meat m the cheapest maiket, " and to ship from anypoit It was to " be especially understood that, in any " engagement of the steamship com " pames, their company were to have " the light to ship their e\ports eithei " at Melbourne oi S j dney, and then " operations would thoreforo not ha " restricted to any one colony in Aus " tralla " Such being tho caso, it is somewhat difficult to seo «hy tho non settlement of the stock tax. ques tion should lead to hesitation If the duty be lemoved, well and good, shipments will then be made f i oin Mel bourne If it bo retained, still welland good, exports v ill pass through somo other outlet There is only one way, w e imagine, in which the prevailing i"1 certainty pi events the speedy completion of the company's share íegistei People may think that if Sydney oi some other poit is to be the actual scene of opora lions, they would best consult their interests by joining an association on the spot, as eveiythmg then would be done under the immediate oye of dnectors, instead of being left entirely to the supervision of mere agents Wo do not think that theio is very much m this consideiation, but possibly it has weight with some Although the head quarters of the Victorian company might bo in Melbourne, thero can ha little doubt that local directors would bo appointed m any pott from which shipments were regularly made, or some other steps taken to assure the most zealous attention to affairs But assuming that, lightly or wrongly, wisely or foolishly, doubts occasioned by the present position of matters with re- gard to the stock tax have a deterrent effect on tlioso wlio would otlieiwiso givo the undertaking their support, we woald point out to Mr SLRVICI tlio great liri portanco of at once arranging with his colleagues to propose the abolition of this most obnoxious impost ITo must seo that it is highly desirable that Melbourne, from tho first, should bo amongst the head quirtors of the now trado If Sydney, 01 Brisbane, Rockhampton, or any othor place, should become associ ited in tho English mind with the eirly shipments of meat, a prejudico would probably spring up m their favom which would tako somo time to overcome " This is " contrary to reason, some may say, which is true But reason has frequently veiy littlo to do with tin» preference shown for names and brands m connexion with certain articles Wo aie aware that at a lime like the present it is almost cruel lo ask the Treasurer to surrender any item of revenue, but suiely some sacrifico should be made rather than allow a duty which has already impoverished hundreds in this colony, to pre%ent a ti ade from spring ing up which would bo the means of gieatly increasing our wealth, of assist- ing the struggling selectoi by improving the -value of sheep and cattle, and of furnishing employment foi a little anny of skilled and unskilled labourers. The whole matter lies in a nutshell Are we foi the sako of securmg a much needed £ 10,000 during the coming financial j ear, to cut ourselves off from participa lion in a business which Ins an immense future beforo it, and to give our com mercial rivals a start which would m all ¡piobability prevent our overtaking them if haply wo should come to our senses Lercafter ? But although the stock tax difficulty may have deterred a few ovei anxious Gouls from sending in their applications foi shaies, there must be hundreds m iVictona able to take a broader view of tho matter who hate not come forward lo support the company These gentle men, especially the pastoral poition, see clearly the gi oat benefits which would accrue to tho colony if Melbourne weie made ouo of the principal channels Muough which our own suiplua stock mid that of Riverina might pass to the ¡hungry millions of Europe Yet ap jiaientlj they decline to interest them Bchcs, c\en though they would find itheu own advantage in so doing This ïack of cnterpiise amongst the grazing class, although passmg strange, is by no means exceptional The squatters as a arulo alvv iys exhibit a decided preference Ï01 conducting operations of an experi- mental nature at other people's expense ii he bare possibility of failure appears Lo appal their sensitive minds Ono would think, to watch their cus- tomary proceedings, that they regal d the piocess of " throwing a sprat f to catch a mackerel "-of risking a thousand pounds to change a liberal ïortuno into affluence previously un dieamt of-as an exhibition of reckless giess calculated to bring upon them the frowns of fate A thinks that such and such a fertile idea may be very well in its way, and even goes BO far as to admit that should it be successfully reduced to action, he will not allow prejudice to prevent his pocketing any money that can be made through its instrumentality But on the whole the larfjC souled creature is inclined to think that he should piefor to see the notion tested at the expense of B %\ hen, however, the matter is broached to B, that public spirited gentleman does not exactly see his way to indulge the

Bent occasion it would bo well if the gianers would abandon then tradi tionaiy caution, and boldly undertake tho infinitesimal risk which is involved in becoming shareholder in tho com parry under

position to take immediate advantago of that repeal of the stock tax which wo can iiardly think Mr SERAICE will îefuse The statement of Di Tin \i, quoted t>y Mr D LTowir/ inyesteiday's.d?;7¡<s, that "after a constant íeseaich of thirty f ' years, he had failed to trace one case 11 of malignant fever oi of small pox to 11 a street planted with trees," is calcu ïated to nouso tho attention of the
