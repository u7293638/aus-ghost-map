A REMINISCENCE OF TENNYSON. I was present in Westminster Abbey on the occasion of the wedding of Lionel Tennyson, eon of the poet. It was a most memorable gathering. All the Whig, aud Liberal aristocracy were there, and almost every representative of Eaglish lettera. Dean Stanley, who was in bed and not well enough to perform the marriage, had arranged that, as Mrs. Tennyson was an invalid, and the poet did not wish to be needlessly stared at, they should come in with their son Hallam by the little private north door in the nave. But when they got there they found it locked, and had to make their way round by the Deanery. Meanwhile the service had inevitably begun, for the bride and bridegroom were ready in their plaoee, and the Abbey was thronged from end to end. The service was being performed, in the Diae's inevitable absence, by Archdeaoon Farrar. Mrs. Tennyson, who was even then a great invalid, oame in, supported by her husband and her elder eon, only just in time to hear the words, 41 pronounce that they be man and wife together, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.' The marriage register was signed in the Jerusalem Chamber, which was crowded with celebrities. The poet was of coarse to sign it, and I had to conduct him through the orowd. As we passed a lady stepped out and said, 4 How do-you do, Mr. Tennyson ?' 4 How do* you do ?' answered the poet cordially. 1 don't in the least know who you are.' 4 41 am Mrs. Lewes,' she said. It was the only time in my life that I saw George Eliot. The poot knew her perfectly well. Sh6 was, in fact, one of his nearest neighbors ; but, as he proceeded to expiain to her, the chamber was dark and dim, and he was short-sighted.â€” Arthdeacon Farrar, in the Sunday Magazine for March.
