It was a nasty, cold, wet morning in May, when Se-ma-Cronang (or whatever his name was) turned over his swag, destroyed some of the valuable papers, examined his razor, polished off a hearty breakfast and walked in from the kitchen on the house house, think- ing, I have no doubt, that it would be a greater honor to perform this feat (which one so seldom sees done) before the master, instead of the cook. The celestial remarked that "he was werry cold," and was told to "go into the kitchen and warm himself. He replied, 'I'll show you," and pulling out a razor (which, owing to the darkness of the room, looked like a piece of black tape), turned coolly round, compressed his lips, and made a long incision, severing the carotid artery, and which failing, continued hacking away. Se-ma-Cronang's spirit had fled before the body had touched the ground - merely a slight quiver of the lips John had "thanked the world. " Three hours afterwards he was buried. Since then his purturbed spirit has been seen twice, making night hideous, but only seen by one who believes in ghosts. However, it appears that his bones were not to rest in that spot. A month ago four Chinamen called, borrowed a spade, dug up the remains of poor John, drank brandy, burnt lights round the grave to appease the soul laid the bones most carefully on a clean cloth and started for China, not wishing to leave the remains of one who had sacrificed himself to some great idol, in a Christian country. lllP Raerme Eciald has been informal by Mi Nash that tho luiros turned
