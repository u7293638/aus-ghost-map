THE PAIMASISE SUPERSTITION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. Sir, Perhaps it may be useful at this uno ture to place before your readers specimens of the prayers repeated by those ill-used (?) Maoris, who have lately inflicted such severe losses upon the Colonial Forces in New Zealand, showing that even amongst " men of, color," religion may be perverted to very sad uses Many are doubtless aware that this superstition originated at the wreck of the Lord Worsley, steamer, at Taranaki, a few years since, when a Maori chief named To Da, or the prophet, in his efforts to restrain his country men from robbing said ship and passengers, be carne demented, and in his madness invented a jargon composed of missionary love and teach ings, intermixed with Maori superstitions, and so started the new faith called Hauhau, or peace, peace, otherwise called Paimnriro worship This religion was eagerly seized upon by the promoters of the Maori King movement as a link to bind together the fallen for tunes of the Maori race, who saw their European neighbors spreading through the land, and by steady industry and perseverance increasing in wealth and prosperity, while they, from idle ness and other causes, were gradually decreasing The new religion was rapidly carried from tribe to tribe, and eagerly adopted by the greater portion of them, but its votaries having, in their enthusiasm for the new faith, committed such deeds as the murder of the Rev Mr Volkner, Mr Falloon, and others, besides indulging in wild, licentious rites not contemplated by the original founder, the clear headed men amongst the Maoris gradually withdrew their support, and became what too many of them are at this time, know nothings An influential chief, who lately gave in his allegiance to the Government, stated " that himself and tribe, during the time they were under its m fluence, never knew a moment's peace of mind ," and all Europeans who have been in New Zealand know what a wild, haggard look the Hauhaus wear This faith is now limited to a few tribes, who live peaceably with their neighbors , but its chief stronghold appears to be in that fertile tract of country between Wanganui and Taranaki, known as the Patea district, the scene of the recent disturbances under Tito coward and his followers, who thus writes to a friendly chief " A word for you Cease travelling on the roads Stop for ever the going on the roads which lead to camp Mnn gamanga (camp AVaikt), lost you be left on the roads as food for the birds of the air and for the boasts of the field, or for me, because I have eaten the European (Smith, trooper) as a piece of beef He was cooked in a put the women and children partook of the food I have begun to eat human flesh, and 1115 throat is constantly open for the flesh of man I shall not die, I shall not die When. death itself shall be dead, I shall be alive The Paton land was fairly confiscated, according to Maori custom, by the Government, in indemnification of the expenses incurred by the late ware, amounting, 111 1867 to over £7,000 000 soothing and it is only when the colored gentleman above mentioned lines dm on off and murdered the settlers besides destroying the property, that the Colonial 601 opinions have taken up arms against them with but poor success as yet, but what can undisciplined forces di against men who fight like demons, 'whose trade is fighting and who, if they were not fighting then 11 late brethren who have treated them too kindly would be at war with each other just for amusement Such has been the sad history of Maori life in New Zealand from the bogus ning until now, and, like the restless lands of India whose descendants the) doubtless in the warlike tribes fought their way through the three islands, taking possession of the land and wiles, and making slaves of those whom they conquered the Native Lands Courts, in 111 vestigating the titles of the Maori land owners, have brought to light many a sad history of days gone by such us the fearful slaughter of the peaceful Memories of the Chatham Islands by the Maoris, until they have become almost extinct It is only since the advent of the 11 late man 111 New Zealand that those fierce tubes have been held in chock and as they gradually feel their reputation and prestige departing from them it cannot be wondered at that the attempt to withstand the wave of civilisation 11 Inch non washes their foot The sensible Maoris in leasing cultivating 01 selling their lands and as 0 thereby many of them better oil from Europe, and it is to be hoped that in a few years more all the well disposed Maoris will have given in their allegiance to the Queen while the only disposed will lines to both crashed into obedience, like bad tempered schoolboys There was not, when I left New Zealand fiOO Maoris 111 mania against the Government and it is to be hoped that when the New Zealand Parliament 111 a generous mood lots sufficient means to carry on the 11 upon a liberal scale (not on the chandler shop style as at present), the authorities will make quick work of them, and to the Hauhau legion will become a thing of the past It is with this now that I think the enclosed w 01 thy of publication-I remain, do , LANKA.
