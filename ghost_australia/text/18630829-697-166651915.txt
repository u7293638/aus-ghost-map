MY BUMBLE BUT BEAUTIFUL HOME. Oh, give me, wlien day i- declining, And tunelilno is flooding the west, My ivy-olad mound, wbcro reclining, 1 can watch the. birds seeking their rest, And 1i--ten to their twitter or sorrow, whilst Ibroiiel. the dew breeze* they roam, To nestle nnd drram of to-morrow In tcy hu»\\)le but Waauful home. Then Rive me, when moonlight is shedding Its briBl,uiQ8s o'tr Sowret and tree, And stars like on anny urc treading ToNatuit'aownmu.lcii., fr.n. And let me i.enelvcly wanner, Dcnculh the dark cciiar-trem roam And there on its loveliness ponder. In my bumble bul heuuuCul Uome, When morn the grcr orient Is ehccluur With purple and Tcrmillou r.uo, And myriads of inscols am grttiing First raye of the nun bursunc through ; Then lot me g&xc; O'll without measure, \VhilrliX8Douri, like sheeted ghosts rum, With a bean filled with lnnotonl pleasure In my humble but beautifu'. home. You may tell me of fitmc and ambition, Of pomp and wealth's dazzling array— Of those wbotro high in position, And homago receive every day ; Bul give me Ibe une I love dourest, A«ay from mi never to roam. Then Ihou like tin Kdcn appearcst. My bumble bui beautiful home.
