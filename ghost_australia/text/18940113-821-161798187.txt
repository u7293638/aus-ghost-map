POETRY. A NEW KIPLING POEM. Mr. Rudyard Kipling has .written tire following vernBi as an introduction to Mr.; John' Arthur Birry't published colleociqn of. t»!es and sketches trader the title of "8>tere Brown's Btrayip and Other Stories":— There dwells a Wife hy the Northern March And a wealthy Wife is she. She breeds a breed o' roviu' men And casta them over eea.' And some they drown fn deep water, And some In right of shore; And word goes bask to the earllne Wife, And ever she sends more. For eince that life had gate or gear, Or hearth or garth »r bleld. She wills her bohb to the white harvest. And tb&Ms; a bluer yield She wflls her sons to the wot ploughing To rids the horse o* Cr< e, And syno her sons come borne again Far spent from unt ihe sea. Tho cod Wife's eons come home again Wi* little Into their hands But the le&r; o' men that ha' dealt wi' men In the new and naked lands— But the faith o' men that ha' proven men By uiorx th <n willing breath, And die eyes o'men that ha* read wi'men In the open books o' l>eath. Bicli are they, rich In wonders seen, But poor in the goods o' men: And what tliey ha' got by the skin o' their teeth They sell for t heir teeth again.' Ay, whether they lose to the naked life, Or win to their hearts' desire. They tell it all to the carline Wife That nods betide the tire, fier hearth is wide to every gust That gars the dead ash spin— \- And tide by tide and 'twlxt the tides Her eons go out and in. [Out in great mirth that do desire Hazard of travkless ways In wi'great peace to wait their vratcli And warm before the bhze J And some return in brokenwleep, and some in waking dream, For the hears the heels o' the dripping ghosts That ride the long roof beam. Home—they come home from all the sons— The living and the dead— The good Wife's sons enmo home again For her blessing on their head.
