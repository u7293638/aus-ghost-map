My guide, looking e carefuilv at the names, taper in hand, stop r before one. I signify to liim that I would be alone for a few minutes and he retire I bend down and read the inscription:— " William Hamilton, horn May 17,1851 , died. June 9, 1873, He giveth'His beloved sleep. It is, indeed, sleep forhim, and unmaired by any dreams? ' I think of how he loved me—that love which I held so hgiitiy—and the plenteous tears come. But here is a step. The custodian of the place coming back, I suppose. I raise my eyes hurriedly, and Colonel Crordon enters but they have in them a milder, sweeter look than I have ever seen there before. He takes my hands in his and holds them looking long and lovingly at the inscription on the coffitL , We do not speak a word, but we leave the place together an come out mto the gray wintry light of th fading day.
