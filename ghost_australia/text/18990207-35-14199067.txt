TIFFIN TIME. Fleet-street on a drizzly, greasy day is (says the " Pall Mall Gazette ") as uncomfortable of street as London can show The printers are smoking their pipes and lounging away part of the dinner hour , bustling clerks, going to their lunch as swiftly as it who) were flying to catch a tram, push through the thin crowd, and the greasy, drink sodden loafers who frequent Fleet street more than any other big thoroughfare in London are strongly in evidence, looking for a sixpence to be borrowed, or, if it comes to the worst to he earned What Dr Johnson would think and say were he to be put down in Fleet street to- day one can pretty well guess He would roll his huge figure and growl and grunt, his stick would be at the service of the young gentlemen whose elbows struck him in the RIR, and with many " Sire and much gurgling he would resent the disappearance of nearly all his old landmarks St Ihiu stan's stands where it did, but Temple Bar is gone, and of all the haunts he loved before he gave up wine for to the Metro and the Cheshire Cheese, each in its own court, alone remain as they were When the looked for the lane that led to the old Cock 1 rivers he would find himself confronted by the fortress-like walls and iron ght iron doors of a bunch of the Bank of England while across the way he would see Grinling Gib bons's cock, or its double, which, with a circular lamp and a miniature copy of old Temple Bar, marks the position of the modern Cook In the very modern hall of the new Cook, tacked to a haire covered board, are a notice of the circuits of the Judges and a " daily court list " A board tells that the old Cook grill room is to be found up a flight of stairs, and I felt tempted to ascend , but the bustling gentlemen who came streaming in through the hall nearly all went down a narrow passage which shares with a long bar the front part of the house, and I followed them By the door that leads into the dining-room is a showed screen of ground glass, and from two openings in this the customers'' bills and their bottles of wine and other liquors are given out Kio room itself is lighted by two skylights at the highest points in which stars of gas twinkle all day, read) to take the place of daylight should a fog drop like a curtain on the city Down each side of the rooms are pens of wood with ground glass panels in the highest part of the partitions and a brass rail above them to hold hats coats are hung in a bunch at the end of the partitions and umbrellas are stacked m stands The paper on the walls is of old-gold colour with a coloured pattern on it, the panels of the paper are edged with blue and hanging on the wall in OKch pen is a print of some old fashioned subject, mostly on graviugR from Dead) Sadler's pit cures At the far end of the room over a door through which a glimpse is caught of white coated cooks, and great dish never running up and down on chains sea-girt COL. ; the brother to the one outside the house, and behind the cock and on either side of the door pro mirrors Concerning these two gilt cooks there is a royal- ler) When the old Cock across the street was sentenced to destruction, Grinling Gibbons cock disappeared one night stolen and carried away to America, so the Fleet-street gossips said but when the old title and some of the old effects had been taken across the road, the cock, or his exact fun simile reappeared and brought his twin brother with him " A tavern chair," Dr Johnson said, " is the throne of human felicity," but in the modern Cook he would find no chair, but touches that run along the partitions, and there is a constant " T3) your leave, Sir," and " Pardon me, Sir," as an income finds a vacant place and passes along to it, or a guest, his lunch fimtJied, passes out The old doctor's remarks as to the extent) of tavern waiters and of the way a of tavern patrons, " the more noise you make, the more trouble you give the more good things you call for the welcome you are," apply to the the era of the present day as they did to that of the past The patrons are nearly all in a great hurry Many of them will not waste the time spent in taking off -a great coat of A hat Most of them have no need to look at the bill of fare, is document that gives a oop oils list of soups, fishes, entrees, joint, and viands from the grill but give their orders in the sharp, decided tone that commanders of great armies find very busy men are supposed to adopt, with a reminder that their household bread must be trusty and their potatos flour, their shop lean or their stock underdone, and these orders the waiters, who move always at a " steady double," transfer to the kitchen in a code which is to ordinary speech what shorthand is to ordinary writing The guests no mostly connected in some way with the profession of the law Here and there is a barrister, next of dress, quiet of manner, lets in a hurry than most of the other gentlemen dining, and some of the guests I would identify as colic tors-quiet, firm of jaw but the greater proportion of the people lunching weiolaw)ers clerks Most of them had niotisla√ºios, many had longish hair combed over a rather bald skull and their headgear was not of the colonies in the use of silk hats or of the blackest if they preferred " bowlers " Their garments were for use, and did not conspicuously resemble the fashion plates that the tailors issue, and -some of them carried bundles or legal documents, the v of) apple sauce of which is going) ing to a la) man Some of these gentlemen read newspapers propped up against the water bottles but the gentleman who sat opposite to me at table, and who ordered a light lunch of brown biscuits, butter, and a pint of bitter, plunged into the centre of a great roll of foolscap, a bull y document that this limb of the law seemed to make light of, but which would have frightened an editor into a fit My lunch was a modest one, coating 3s 6d in all a cut from a sirloin of beef, a portion of cabbage, bread, Stilton cheese, a tankard of beer, and a half- pint of port, which were whisked in front of me by Charles the waiter, a Briton, bald of head and quick in manner, the food on brown and white crooks.-), with the book as a crest on it, the beer in a plated tankard, the port in a tiny bottle I had lunched once before in the new Cock, but had remembered nothing of the meal except the fracture of the waiter who served the table Given a threepenny bit as his tip by some body, he remarked that the gentleman evidently had not been to church last Sunday, and when another patron was doubtful as to whether con- somme or oxtail soup would suit his appetite the better, the waiter advised him against oxtail, " for," said he, " the summer was so warm that all the oxen got thin tails switching off flies " Charles, so far as I heard, did not indulge in facets Beyond the cabalistic words he shouted at the kitchen door, all he seemed to say was Sorry to trouble you, Sir Much obliged, Sir," when a newcomer handed down to him the plates and debris of his predecessor's feast I dallied as long as I could over my port, and shortly after 2 the rush of incoming guests stayed, and the small boys in grey jackets and aprons who had splinted continuously from the kitchen to wards the upper regions with piles of plates, guarded by tin covers, now passed at less frequent intervals and at a walk The most Britannic of all the waiters, with a bristle of hair and a s years beard, resembling the usual stage attorney, had time to say) "How do you do r" to a bank messenger, who, in his blue coat with gilt buttons and keeping on his tall hat, seemed rather disgusted to have been sent on such a menial errand as bringing out a lunch The lull having come, I asked for the manager, and, young, spruce, smart, wiping the perspira- tion from his forehead, he appeared, saying that it was warm work during the lunch hour, and offered to show me anything I wished to see With the necessities of the modern Cook and its patrons he was there I 0 ly familiar, but when we went upstairs into the old room with its Jacobean fire- place, its pens with green curtains above the dark wood partitions, its sawdusted floor, the old room as it was across the street transferred en bloc by Mr. Collett of the ancient hostelry, he knew nothing of the ghosts of the great men that should haunt the place. Here gay old Pepys ale lobsters and drank wine with that merry jade Kuipp till midnight. Herb Johnson roared his brutal snubs at Boswell. Here, of mon happily still left to us, Sir Henry Irving dreamed as a young man of the Hamlet, he would be when a chance was given him, and Sir Edward Clarke wondered if ever he would make his mark at the Brig. Tennyson, here as yet unknown, let the bouquet of the port move into the dance of deathless rhythm. Dickens to his chop here, and Lord Hannon and Sloutagn Williams exchanged wit and wisdom and here Professor Fawcett, giving his door of police as a tip to Paul the head waiter, who has now seceded to Simpson's, always solemnly told him that there were such things us Post Office savings banks. In conclusion, may I an anonymous penman, advance a claim to be included among the extraordinary men who have fed at the Cock ? I believe myself to be the only scribe of this generation who, writing of the house, has not quoted Tennyson.
