N0 TES AND COMMENTS. A correspondent has written twice about " Puppy Dog Corner,' and is astonished that the nuisance is not removed. A higher compliment has seldom, verily, been paid to the '' power of the press " Point the offence out, bring it prominently into public view, and it must cease But it doesn't cease It is not shifted out of the way. The puppy dogs assemble still, and stare at the women and puff the smoke of cigars and cigarettes in their faces, and annoy good and chivalrous citizens, and block the Queen's high way Why are they not moved on The question should come home to the Police department as doubtless it does, and bruits trouble with it at times, for it is not only the puppy dogs who assemble and block the way Following out the dog idea, it would be easy to instance Borac other meets in various parts of the city which are still held, or only with extreme difficulty dispersed There is a place in Bourke street where wolves and lambs fore gather Another in Collins street, where a sort of fox or fox terrier breed, with a mingling of jackals, arrogate to themselves a right to temporary, and almost complete occupation And still another, a little east of the Post-office, and on the other side of the road where those whom the term pariahs will well describe wait the good Samaritans call to come in No complaint is ever heard of the attractiveness of this last class Hunger has wasted them, and they are very time Against all the others there have been crowded, but none of them has had that effect which those who use the streets in legitimate fashion might desire. The police are stirred up to energetic action at times, but they seem to lack discretion or discrimination How now could a policeman display more gross incapacity or greater obtuseneBB than in placing a sacrilegious hand on the shoulder of an ex member of Parliament' Truly there could be but one way to touch the reigning king himself, the member who actually sits and governs, and has, of course, as much right to any place he chooses to write in the street as to the box seat on the coach or the guard's place in the railway van It would be almost fair to say that a policeman who cannot dig engines an ex member of Parliament from an ordinary man, who does not recognise the ghost of the divinity which once hedged a king, is not fit to be a policeman At least he might in his own interests be requested to resign, for he will never rise in the force And more than once or twice in our brief metropolitan history have these mistakes been made. A well known banker who had halted for a minute to meet a country customer was once moved on, and to wrath as well as progress When objections such as he made are upheld the police naturally are disheartened "What is the use of acting' they an) , ' we are not supported by the magistrates " "You are not discreet,' is the reply, and then comes the rejoinder from the police authority, "The discretion you want cannot' be purchased at seven shillings a day " Granted , but is the patrol and control of the city streets in the busy times of the day and night work to be entrusted to seven slid lings a day men' Apart from the move on business, is it not vexing to the stranger or the visitor seeking information to be met with the reply, ' B) my Bowl I don't know I'm a Bthrangerhere like yOUr Belf, just " Colonial men returning from London generally speak in high terms of the metropolitan force (none have returned since the strike) " They are so civil, so attentive so well informed " But it is very safe to state that they did not meet the recruits of the force the Irishmen wild from Connaught, or the Ilighlundmen just down from far Lochaber A "Government scent farm" 18 established, is actually fenced in we are told, and will shortly be cultivated This farm is not, as might be supposed, attached to the Parliament house ; is not intended to provide hon. members with a free supply of all rare and delicate odours to supplement the luxuries and refinements of the legislative palace which will by and by crown Melbourne. It is indeed far away from Melbourne, near to the old mining township of Dunolly It is part and parcel of that great teaching system we have a cently introduced which proposes to take all our farmers in hand, and teach them all that they ought to do the scent farm -It is not an apt or happy n desig nation-really ian concern which might lead to much pleasant country life and to good financial returns The time will come, and indeed seems very near ashamed, when only the ryots of India and the steam power wholesale farmers of America and Asia will grow wheat The poorest men of Australia give most attention to it now, and while the wheat grower with 320 acres will be in debt to the miller and the storekeeper his whole life long, the clever man with ten acres of pansies, camellias, and roses will have a good and easy life, and in ten years secure an Independence Another grumbles along with his few poor sheep on ten thousand acres, can hardly afford tobacco money, and doesn't Cape town once in ten years ; while his cousin, who always believed in small lots of good things, tells how he makes Â£20 a week the whole summer long out of a half dozen lily ponds. Still we cannot all live in that way. It is true OF trite But if a very considerable section of the agricultural community care is it not time that they began at least, to learn ' Mr Piesse, of the great firm of Piesse and Lubin, was enthusiastic over our opportunities in this way when he visited our first International Exhibition Our climate and soil, he animated, were perfect, but we listened and forgot again Will the scent farm teach us anything? We must wait and hope One thing however, may be mentioned in connection with the scent farm , it is a laboratory for distilling the essence, of native plants. We have sent the cut in pure oil far and wide through the world, but that is a medicine and lubricant A little care odour has been distilled alan from the boronia of Western Australia. But what of the fragrance of the wattle bloom, of the rich yet delicate music which perfumes the gorges of our big forest and scrub lands, of the honey Sweet which lingers on theatre it withered cells of the heath blooms v And to strike out another track altogether. What of the mystery which lies in leaf or blossom or stem of the Darling pea' Few people know much of the Darling pea, the strange vegetable which exercises such strange influences on horses, cattle, and sheep, and, as some back blockers will tell, on bipeds also The hemp supplies a solace and a stimulant to the natives of India and the whole of Southern Asia The coca leaf enables South Americans to mount to heights which without its aid would be practically in- accessible, and to endure fatigues which seem at times to pass the bounds of ordinary belief. Why should not this strange herb of Central Australia yield a nepenthe to its weariness and anguish ? Investigation might result in disappointment, of course, possibly in surprise. We might find something more strange than ever was told of locked up here in simple leaf and unpretentious bloom. Indeed, any person who has listened to an experienced bushman yarns of this most marvellous pea will acknowledge that it is a matter well worthy of investigation and there are acres, square miles of it ready grown
