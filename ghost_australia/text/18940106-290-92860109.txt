THE CYCLOBAMA. The morning, afternoon, and evening ses sions At tbe Cydorama were all largely attended on - Monday, and the publio interest in ithe- wonderfully realistic picture of the Battle of Waterloo shows no sign of abating. Mr. Lockley's illustrative lecture is listened to daily with tbe greatest attention, while the musical -nffeote under the direction of Mr. Dennis -Keenan leave nothing to be desired. A novel and striking innovation in the entertainment ' was introduced on Mon day evening, when the ghost of Napo leon appeared upon the scene of the famous battlefield. At the conclusion of Mr. Lockley's lecture the lights were turned down, and presently from the surrounding gloom the figure of the defeated. Emperor stood out before the onlookers, clad in the costume familiarised by bis pictures, and gazing with melancholy visage upon the scene of the great struggle. The effect was extremely good.
