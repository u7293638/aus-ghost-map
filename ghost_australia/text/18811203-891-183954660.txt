Cadmus* has been withdrawn. Pacha at 6 st.12 lba. is very well in, but Nabock lish at 6 st. 8 lbs. looks-very7 rosy,--for with but 12 lbs. from Proctor he led'the field in the Cup for nearly a milo and ' three-quarters; and as he now receivee 171be. more from Mr. M'Giil'e horse, he shoutd go to the front and stay there until thence il orer. I fancy the distance,is tod far for Mr. Qoeitt's Eclipse,.and do not care to trust him even with the light weight of 6 st. To Bum up, I think the Ipswich contingent bare .a mortgage7over the big monoy, and Nabock lisli and Proctor should be first and second, with a good race for.third honours between Finnio's Eclipse, Moorlad,aad Pacha.-, l.know very little about the Corinthian horses, but judging from the way Warfare won the Tnal.Stakes at Eagle Farm lost month, he should have a good deal to say in tlie raoe. Pastimo anil Zanco look well oh paper, and the former will probably carry the most confidence. Eclipse is, I ehould say, not likely to'itart. Tho attendance of sporting men at the meeting called last wcot for tho purpoeo of forming* a Tattorsall's Otub was not largo, and the pro ceedings were of the tamest. ; Mr. Noble ocoa pied tbe chair, and dwelt upon tho advantage! ■nch an institution would confer upon racing in Brisbane, andstrongly urged those interested to spare uo efforts to establish tho elub, and to make it a prosperous and: creditable : society.
