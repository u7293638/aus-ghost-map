~Mmfflm&mmm;&^ D'AR(i!Y- ; RE'AD'cJ'--' GHOSEV This ghostly entertainment,' under the' patronage oE -,a- large,, number,, of., people — the larrikin-- 'element - pre dominating— was ,lield at the Pavilion, Public Gardens,* :fori the 'first time iri'Launcestonori Mrmitayniglit.' The;ar rangements. for the. different classes of seats wore uiiavoiaauiyaeieci.iv«, .is-more is only one door for admission from Tamar street to the Pavilion/a passage- having been made from t]ier-- street entrance to the buildfhsj-tto'preventithe gardens-beirig; invaded during alterations. Owing to this one and all had to enter by the same door, and, although the back seats were railed off, a good many people, mostly '. drunk, jumped over the division during the ; ? \entertainjiient,\ ostensibly /.to get to the door, but no doubt actuated by curiosity to gain a closer inspection; of the modtis qpcrandi of the mystic;) scenes. The entertainni'ent?opeiied witli four scenes — drawn ~hv''R, R Cnnntir^— from Goethe's opera Faust, representing Faust's studio in the University of Gottenburg, \- ? exterior. off Marguerite's: cottage, a: forest. J in Germany;-and the ancient cathedral at' Heidelberg. In the first scene Faust is represented — as in the opera— as- an old: . ?? -University, doctor, seeking out. of his:lorev ?-'-?- the-;elixir -of life ; the1 ^appearance - of- Mephistppheles, and tlie: subsequent - ?'apparition of Margueri e— spinning;. The. last effect is very good, realislic in: the. extreme, but yet retaining an- unearthly? transparency that made the flesh creep.1 :j -,:?'.' The ,;i.ewjBl-.. scene is also very good, ; the reality of Marguerite and the spinning wheel being like; and' yet unlike; . the: apparition.
