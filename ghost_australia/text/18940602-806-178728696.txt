SABBATARIANS GOING BACK ON THE REFORMATION. A reporter of the Chicago Evening Journal, interviewed, among other divines, a Catholic priest of that city, the Rev. Thos. F. Cashman, in regard to the enforcement of Sunday observance upon the peoplo by law. = ] n reply the priest said : “ The church insists, remember, upon a proper observance of Sunday in com memoration of th 6 resunection of her Hoad and the descent of the Holy Ghost. But that is church law, not divine. There is no command in tho Bible which directs the observance of Sunday, That is canon law; and though our Protestant m igh bours have borrowed the day for us, we have no desire to meddle with them in its enjoyment in their own peculiar fashion. At the same time, wo don’t want them to meddlo with us. Now, as lo Sunday b a ing *a Christian institution, an error so loudly proclaimed: In the strict seme of tbo words it was not instituted either by Christ or His church. It is not ordered by divine law, nor was it ordered by tho ohuroh. Goostantino decreed the observance of Sunday, in order to givo tbo Christians a chnyco to compete with tho pagans, and, recognising it ns a good thing, tho chUKph in heV subsequent councils adopted it. At the Reformation, tho Proio-tmiis carried it off, along with many other good things. Sunday was made by tho church a day of rest ancTdevotion, and aim her childon to fulfil their duties on that day. When these dudes have boon attended to tho remainder of iho day is properly used for recreation. In conclusion I wish (o say that tho position of coercion taken by ko many of the Protestant clergy—tho position that although they ore admittedly in a hopeless minority of all tho peoplo of the so States, they would compel all tho rest off, us to accept limit Sunday dogmas by re course to law ami other methods—is n grievous departure from their old battle cry of civil and religious liberty.”
