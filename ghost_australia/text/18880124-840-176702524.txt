IAN OPOSSUM IN A FIRE-BELL. The local ike-bells (aays the Wagga Adver tiser of Thursday) have been called upon to do a fair share of duty lately, but tho oentral instrument in Fitzmaurico street was put to a decidedly novel use one afternoon, -when it be came a' temporary 'abiding place' fora festive young opoBBum, which was observed to be Tierched on the tonirue of tho bell, doincr a gentle swing. Had it been night, and had the 'possum succeeded in raising a noto or two out of tho1 bell, Wagga might havo been in a position to work up a littlo ghost story of ite own about (say) ' tho haunted bell,' for at the first sound of the dread note that 'possum would have fled for tho nearest gum tree, and then tho mystery would havo been how the bell camo to speak.
