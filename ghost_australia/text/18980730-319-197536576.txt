A MULE PANIC. illustration, of the. power, of animals to see in the -night, and as to their tendency to panic at that time. a correspondent' o'f the VSpcclutor" . . records a ludicrous, but Striking experience of t-:o:nc . M years ago. General Banks was besieging portilud- . son, Louisiana, the southern gateway to the control vol the Mississippi River. A body- of troops had marched into the back-country to look for.hovcring . .Confederate cavalry; and were sleeping one moon less night behiud stacked rifles, in readiness for a night attack, .The attack came in an unexpected . form. Some 0 or S-army mules, getting somehow detached from the waggon wheels, to which thev were tied at night, were seized by a panic, und came, charging down almost the entire line- of the : 5-'nd Massachusetts Volunteers. Every man lav covered with a "shelter tent," a piece of white j cotton cloth about 5 feet square. As the mules j imbed over each one of us, he woke snddcnlv with a en-, and sprang up, raising his shelter tent in one hand or upon his front, so that he seemed like ft sheeted and gibbering ghost. This successive rising of over -100 apparitions added wihlneas to the pan.c of the muics, and they fairly flew down the line, how U»e remarkable thiug is that, while manj a man .:3d hi? side rubbed hard, or his scalp abraded by the hoof or the leg of a mule, not a man \va realiy stopped on or really hurt. It was for months a subject of comment iviili us that the mules, in their unentitled panic, should neverthe less liave been able to see where to slop, should have cared where they stepped, and in their fiik-cd bhouid have been able always to step on the ground. The men presently lay 'down again, but for half an hour afterwards a laugh at the ludic- Tousness of the experience would start somewhere 3Td'd"owntJCl.b0,'t 'C-n3 Md- «P
