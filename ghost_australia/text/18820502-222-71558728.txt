That wortly did not make much of'an attempt to rejoin; i he did wildly flourish his hands in a clawing fashlionuat first, bult' the' second blow made him think a masterly retreat'cxpcdient, and away he ran, with Spot at hiis heels. Therewpps a little puddle a bit ahead, and into this, in hiis blind fright, Ohbadiah fell, umerging covered with mud. But Ilis terror would not allow him to stop, and away he scudded,.whilt J.Tack and Bartha fairly laughed unitil the tears ran from their eyes,' P'erhalps had they seen Obadiah's evil face when he was iv safe distance off, they might havo::felt inclined to fear instead of laughing. Bertha explained, to Jack- that shi had come out to bring home the two goats her mother kept wlen thliostorm began to gather, anl that she hall met with Obadinh, who had began to.tcanse her, and tried to snatch a kiss.

Jack did feel troubled about hbi mother; but thln he had been accustomed to these scones, and lhe felt sure that it would all blow over nal usual. Still the terrible face lie had just seen haunted his mind, and arose every now and then like a spectr.from the, dead., The llo an butd utli auid Jnck, however, soon dissipateld ali oeehitltoughts., '' Melon hurried too and fro,' in' Gritty Gully, Strying to ascertain thelo danage lonoa bythi waters 'sciclh still tumbleul 'lown, fannling' iil ronrieg.'

'Jack's. fists rbegan to clench, and he felt an if he could go up to Hector and fell him to the ground.-. -Jnack noticed that his father cime up to to Hector, and began to hold animated con versation :with' him.' Presently Dunakum jumped 'on to a form. Instantly the crowd left off drinking, dtalling, and smoking. H:'. Miners of Grit," cried Bunakum, "the timie has come .and the man.

A stampede at once took fllace, and, 'of course, Jack, was not to .be left behind. llefore many minutes an impromtic platform had been got up at the end of the largo room, and a' table fixed, whereon' sas a deeanter of lbrandy and a bottle of water. Mr. White, ]ortha's father, took the chair, and, after a few, reimarks, introduced their old -and esteemed friend, Mr. Bunaknm. (Cheers.)

Several entlhusiastio admirers at once rushed to him withlbrandy bottles. ' HAMr; Obadiah Swcelcomfort, son., rose to second the motion; and it was put and carried ner. con., amidst cheier and reiterated cheeirs; with groans for the coummissioner, and cries of "Lynch hllu I".. Whereupon several Cali-. fornians at once drew their bowie-knives. :. uncnktum jumipcd.np, however, at once, and cried out, "Down litlll the dust, gentle men I Give us life at once..

Jack rushod out of tlihe hlotel. loe weould taind no moi of this. With ]his blood at fever heat, hie slashed away up and down the townelip, iheedless of' where lhe was going, trying to clni Isle mlnd. Whalmt could he, a cere boy, do? tGradually the diggers becamo quiet. Tile men who were able to get to their tants stlaggered 'thither throughi mud and mire, tolllng about the now papor; while thlose who had fallen in the battle, elumbered in-the wot bars, gatlihering rheimnatisnm wheroveith to be tormented hereafter. r .. The flecoy clouds were sotiring along, per mIitlting.glimpsoes of a sky; clear and blue as lal?s lafusli, and spoltled with 'stare, like the iiantte of 'n'great Iking: nhoeath; the wsaters were rushing acd roaring, buit 'gradually sub. ,siding. Jack walked up and downi by the sidoe,. of tlhe creok,watchling,with theo pleasure a boy ' .over derives fron such a sight, the play'of the 'I ourrent as it swept by. 'He had gottowhere a a little bridge had ben'erected, lwhen he heard 'J a' sort of stifled cry, and, in a second, a dark. I bbdy floated by him in the water. Jack was' a, splondid swimmer, and hoe at onco:jumped, t in to save the drowning person. 'He found the stream very strong, but, carefully striking I out with it, ha was soon. able to reach the' a drowning man, vwho was wildly clutching at, . the sticks that wore careering on the water, I and 'eaught him by the hair. The drowningi .0 sman, however, made wild attempts to catch i hold of Jack; and it'needed all the latter's I ingenuity to prevent this, or, of. course, it , would have scaled the doom of both."' Getting f into a by current, Jack manageil to reach the ' boat., When he hauled his, flotsam'on'tlho' bank hoe discovered he had saved.nonaeother than his own father-the great Bunakum. I Not niuch danmago had.,been .ddnone, .as the' t clothes 0o each had rather beoncittod by im- t mersion. ' . . ' '' ": ' "Yes, 'it's me," said Bunakum, disgorging soma water, ahn indulging in a general shake. I "I. was crossing: tle bridge when it broke t down. ,The commnissioner, knowing Iwan, I .going to cross, no doubts had it sawn in two." I !' Niow, tell the trothi," said Jack. " Wasn't s you gone?" t "No, Jnck," replied Bunakum. _ "Nothing: F crossed my.lips this day, except a drdp of I brandy I took when I was speaking at the t Garryowoen. Jack you've saved your father, t and I'll do great things for you. I'm to be o manager of the new paper, my boy." ' "And,. general rum drinker," said Jack, very undutifully. "But, look hqro, old man, 1 don't you talk to me. I'm almost sorry I' dragged you out. It was clear waste of time. I believe such as you are better out of the world. Look hero l What have you done to a my mothor?" Q "Whathassahe done to m??' said annakum, a "After I'd kept her decently for years, didn't a she-" ' "'Shut:.upl' cried Jack, in a voice that t struck, terror into the soul .of Bunakum. a "Haven't you'ruined her? Sile, who ept your ' worthless life together; who was so good arid patient. She, who was an angel to boits of us.' She would have starved for you. And I, lazy hulk that I anl, I oven lived on her earnings. s 01h I feel as if I could jump into the gully and drown myself, when I think of it..' But, r I'll be different after this. I'll keep her com fortable. Aitd don't you hllow your, ugly face I round, nor come palavering about. I'm: ashamed to think you're 'my father. And, when such*as moe's ashamed, things are very. crooked. Clear out." And Jack walked away, his heart filled withI t loathling. . "Don't'go like that, Jack?" said Bunns.' I hum, in a whininig tone. "Don't leave your '1 poor father shivering here. You haven't half-. I a-crown about you? I'm dying for something t to stop the thirst." : ' I :'Plonty of water in the creek," retorted Jack, without looking round. "You'd better look after your motllher,' said Bunakum,owith assner. "If sho carries on the way she is going, Hector Macinnis 'Il settle her, my fine boy." !' Ho had better leave her alone," said Jack, shutting his teeth firmly. . " Wiat an undutiful child," said Bunakum; ' to leave me, as is his own father- me, as reared him and worked for him i" ".!'.What are you doing there, old blowhlard?:' said a voico; -and 'Iunhuma-behlld done of his confreres. "Dying," solemnly replied the veteran. "Dying. And my own son wouldn't bury me, nor revenge my death on the fell tyrant who caused the bridge to be broken." '.",Dyin' isn't pleasant just now," said the 1 digger. "lHadn't you better get up and have as nip?" S"Thank you, kiid friend,"' said Bunakum, gelting up with considerable alacrity.' Itoepro. sentativo -of the ienerous men of Grit, you haven't, any small change about you?- I must get now clothes." "I have nothing smaller than a sovereign." \- "That will do," said Bunakum, pocketing the ocoin. ."I'll pay you back in thlomnorning." And the two made off to the nearest hotel. Jack had dragged Dunakum out on the main street, so tlhat he was separated 'front his home. rBut he did not cam for that; lie did not desire to go home that night. HeI would return when the bright sun of another day had risen in the heavens, and his mother woulds have recovered. Then all would be well. He began to settle il his mind how to act in future. He would take up a claim withl one of his males, make money, would have a nice place for his mother, and no doubt, a fortune in time. Theni hIo would'go down nand live in Melbourne, and become a great gentll man. Hle would triumpll overyoung Obadiah, Sweetomnfort, and break his head at parting. Wouldn't lie astosish all his acquainlances, and make them respect his. otlclr. And, perhaps he would ask Dertha to become his wife; although at the time, Jack had no very clear ideas as to what getting married entailed. At all oveots, ihe wauld not quarrel with her; \--they would live a happy life. ' I Poor drr ilremer I Little can'st thou foresee wBat' the futurm thou thinkest so pleasant will be. But do we not all dream, as Jack did? And.is it not well that we shohld ? Is it not a mrcy that.the dark clouds of. thie future are hidden from view by a silver veil of our own weaving? " Slow pass our days In clildlhood. And the uIsui' of light son lnsg I lletwiat the morn and eve.

' ' '" -Eternal love loth keep n Iris complaeent arms, the earth, the air, the deep." OIIHAP'TEIR VIII. : Jack, journeyed on to hislfavourilthill of Grita There he gazed upon the panorama that a the moon rvealcd--the lights and shadows-and heard the distant sound' of rushing waters. Young as he was,' came the reemberance of a. faow 'years back,', when this place was all in solitude-when a forest covered the hills of Grit, and the only living beings were Bertha and himself, and their dogs and flocks of' sheop. What chainge would he see here in another few years ? 'H was too. uneducated to apply tihe words of 'Bryant to the scone "The clmlds . Sweep over with the slhadows, and beneath Tho suirfaeO rolls and flsucttlses to the oyo. Dark hollows seen to glide along and chase The moonlit ridges." Sitting gain beneath his favorito tree, Jack began wenaing dreams of, t'he future. Gradually the scene began to fade. His eyes closed in sleep, and, leaning against the tree, ieo slumbered peacefully, notwithstanding his wt otthes, Dlessid sleepl Thou com'st anbidden to thla young, but flee'st from tihe agedl and caree'orn, though wooed aon beds of down I Bleeping peacefully, in the slhadow of the tree., unconscious of pain and porrow, Jack heeded not tie change thiat case over nature. The cloads passed away, and' the moon aliono bright and clear in the intensely blue sky. l'Peace fell 'where' therm Iad been sucl wild comn otion--psc 'liks that of elornity I This oleep at first was a perfect blank. No images flitted aerosa his lbrain. 'But gradually thlero appeared as if thlere woar an intenasely blnck veil in front'of him', whlaih was lifted isow ad tidllesi roevealing lsis motller's agony. stricken, naeo. :Thesi thie sells was slowly ltlftedi tho sad'face failed away, aild thi' land. sacoperemmined just as it was' re the gbreat 'fiood of' 'humanity had changd its- fair 'features.'; His flock was 'feeding' by hisido,. I and. Siotl'snapping!at thetlle' l'os of old t There was no sun, however; 'only'a golden' i light' appearedl: to come from the east: ; Was I lit. dawn ?, It must be.', Dawn: ever"was of I 'that delicious, glorious, golden tint,,',:!" In oxpectancy he looked towards tho east, and Iis glanco was rewarded by to appearance la I a beautifult face-from, wlhence dine'tlie I golden anreola. . Bright ainbor hair fell doai I from the fast emerging head like the glory I a.round a saint.; Slowly the flguro'roeso'untit it assumed the form of a beautiful female, clad in, gossamer gold, with pearls and'diamonds I sparkling like stars in her vesture. Thori the figure glided to his eide, and, hovering near; thim, miled sweetly. i W ilho was thisnbeautiful, but awful being?' He had never seen aught human: tihat resembled her.l Bertha was beautiful, 'but' this being was too spirituelle toboe of this I this world.

It: sluly opsued until a gidat lssure, extending, it seemed to' him, for ,miles, resulted. Then lhe saw tlit'hat in the centre of 'this there was a will of hivte' rock'. Ie hald. secii' nasubstance like it,'and' remembered the.miners called it quartiz. The strange being touched it, and at, once there. issued fromntit streans oitgolde'light. By; that light hie saw streaks of gob permeating the lovely white stone. 'Thr e werei also specs of a bright blue metal, whi t he did noit know. .. SThen a voice camo.from tsie beaitiful unknown-a voice rippling withtoiuse.. "Yours-the shining reef, Ipmomber.". The vision .faded fast fro?n his view, and was followed by a dead blonk, 'scceeded by a gloom so intense that it pain 'leis eyeo:; A great horror, a fearful chill, caii upon him, as he gazed into the ebon darkcess. In this, as if illuminated by a lurid light, appeared the face of his mother, now ivid and dis torted; and gazing upon him an if striving to, speak. He strove to wake him elf. A terrible 'shriek appeared to echo throu? the air, aniid he awoke. The moon was shining pe cefelly on the quiet scone; the roar of the 'uaters had sub' sided, and there was peace. â€¢ ''' What was this? Spot, wh qm'h had left at hlome, stood near him,l whining :and scratchling with his feet, aod licking his hands. Something was wrohg. TTho' dog' gave a short, joyous bark when his master awoke; and prepared at once to'go;. Jack rubbed his eyes, and got up. He' felt somewhat stiff, sore,' and cold. He thought,i therefore; the best thing wouldiba to go home. Yet, as lieo went down tlil hill, lie could not but think of the strange droeao hl'e ld had. He looled" carefully at the grmund, and saw; that it w\nas exactly m its usualcondition. He' could not help smiling at hia own strang' fancies. OCIfAPTER IX. Jack walked' down to the valley. The food had now comlpltely subsided: The flat was "sloppy and wet, it isa true; but nature' had been so completely revived that 'these slight disadvantages "weordcompeisated ' by the generally improved appearance of every thing in the soft light of the moon. Jack felt little inclination to go to sleep how; the' air was.so purs and buoyant, that it inifused "f'ilh`life into'Iltm. Bait Spot's'aagcr:wvhiia s attracted his attention, and' caused him to, wonder. Had anything wrong taken placo at' home? : What did the dumb animal meai by his half-human appeals? Jack; in response to' his eager looks, crossed the .creek,and wentl 'to thila tent which he called home. ' There Spot became greatly excited, wagged his tail,' jumped on his master, and uttered, sundry sharli, angry barks. The dooriof ;the 'tent was open, and tlhe moon shoneintoit. The' boy looked, and saw his mother lying asleep in tile same place where tie had 'left 1er., In the moonlight her face looked" terribly' ghlistly,' and Jack tainidd away with, a. shudder. What good would it doi hinm to enter and awakcn her' Il' turned "away,' anxious to spare himselfl the tnlure he knew, would result, and walked up the township, which was now wrauped in slember, regard: less of 'thoe, demonstrations of Spot, who appeared to have absolutely lost his senses. SOct out, you old fool,",saii Jack, thrust iny the dog away from him. "You've got the distemper, I think. I'll give you such a hammering as you never had, except on that day you stole Bertha's dinner, if you go on iq this way"' Spot slunkl away behind, in a very melan choly mood; no doubt arguing in his simple mind that he was laboring unier a delusion, and that his master was right., Just as Jack was walking past the Garry owen, Spot gave a spiteful bark, and rushed spoli a man who had emerged fro'i that hostelry, accompanied by another. Jack saw it was Buniankuia. lie stared at lim with great surprise. The man absolutely looked white with terror; anid gazed on lhin as if horror- stricken. Jack set it down to fear of the dog. "S11ht tip, Splot I" lhe cried. ', "Don't you know him? lie deserves barking at; but you'd better leave him alone. Why, you needn't be frightened of Spot." "Is that you, Jack?" said Bunakunm, in a tremulous voice, whichl, of coursel his son set down to 'drink. "Keep your' dog off, will you? IIe's mad." Behind Buinakurn were tied men whom Jack recogniedl as Hecto Macmionis and the district cordoner-a gecitlmuan,' wlho ouglit Bacchus' to oenable lhini to' dischargo' his Ihidanmantheaf'idutims. Dr. llouse wnq one of the'greatest boa vliants and most unjust judges in the world. An im~n itation to drink would smfllce ton turn tho scales of justice with him at any momient.

Gritty Gully, and to note its: altered appeairance, when groups began to collect around the tent where the ghastly corpse of poos Janet, lay. After all that has been said and written of the lawlessness of the. time about whicl 'we write, crime was really, rare'. A better class, of men had conme to the Victorian gold-flelds, than the wild desperadoes who had invaded the golden land of California. Those who haveolived on the early gold-fields,' can afford to smile at the ingenious lies circu-! lated by gentlemen who would malke it appear; that thley passed through wondrous adventures.' To a great degree, in those times, the diggers! were the pick of every country. Young and handsome honest 'fellows, with the lessons of their mothers still strong in their minds, intent only on amassing a competency with' wlhioh to make the last days of their parents easy, or to enable them to wed some dearly beloved one' in distant lands, were in the majority. The mean, the depraved, were not to be found. People wore so lavish with what they earned thlat the incentives to crime were few, and poverty was unknown. Gambling there was, and immorality; but neither of these vices eer reached the height they did in California, as the soil was not suited to them. Indeed a desperado, or "Calfornian," was soon hunted off a diggings-the majority of the people zealously guarded against the adiission'of black sheep. The occurrence, therefore, of a murder in the " dommunity of Grit, was something so itusual,''so fraught' with interest, that it seemed as if no one would do 's stroke of work 'that day.:Tho bars were crowded early; and ithe hotelkeepers. smiled.: as they reflected on the probability of a splendid business.' The diggers, like all hard workers, liked a holiday, and "too, every.occasion to have one. What better chanco thian this, when two great eventii followed each other io quickly-n flood'and a murder. . : People talked in whlispers aibout the'horrid deed. They siid' all sorts of strange thingd, andnlany of.them.hinted that they know .a lot about the matter. On being closely pressed they, with commendable wSisdom, declared it would not do to" tell. A time would conie, &e.;, A. &'. 'There lay the last of poor Janet, stark in the growinlg sunlight ; the eyes that were wont 'to beam with joy gleaming with unearthly light ; the hands, generally, busy at that hour, clutched together, never to open. Men looked ii' upon the dead face, and thenr `withdrew their gaze with a dread shudder, .Two police men kept guard, and' excited the comntisera* tion of the crowd at their. onerous and dis. agreeable task to such an extent that bottles, containing something s'tronger than water, were lifted to their lips every few minutes.
