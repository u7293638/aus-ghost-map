TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir-There it not that I feel more than a passing interest in the spirited action of the Hon. Bruce Smith for his liberal definition of the law of competition, as described in your columns of the 18th instant, I would not trouble joutoinscrtthiBletter. Ibescandalousclans which a so-called representative body of architect sought to make one of the conditions of competition has happily been frustrated, and it would be interest' ing to learn from this enlightened body on what grounds competitions should be limited to the architects who have resided and practised In New South Wales for at least three years. Is it that the spirit of trade-unionism has sent on a profession which in all ages has been noted for its liberal feeling, and to- day, but for as commercial immorality of the times, could boast of as much freedom. I fear such is the case, and it is well that the Minister for Works ban, in a short, sharp, and decisive minute, pointed out that architectural come within is not to be restricted to any charmed circle hosting of a lengthened residence in New South Wales, is open to all young and untried men as well as old practitioners, clover in the trickery of business perhaps, but sometimes sadly imperfect in the at of which they profess themselves masters, as many who have assisted in their creations can verify, but whose identity is seldom revealed to the outside world, Those ghosts of the profession shows materialistic tendency and a disposition to launch out on their ownuoount: they are mostly men of experience, and from better knowledge of art in its true sense) and construction, must, in fair competition, relegate those past masters to their proper sphere. Is it from a fear of too keen a rivalry in this direction that those autocrats that) sought to crush their younger brethren end report the plums to themselves ? History has shown that at all times and in all professions competition has brought young and untried men into the very front ranks Let it be hoped that the generous action of a New South Wales Minister for Works nay do the same. I am, &c.;, """A GHOST.
