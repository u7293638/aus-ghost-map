^'^^^^W^^Sax^^^'^ ^^Jf ^TJtAdRnii|ABY CAEEER. r:.;'^t.;^|ie-xecezii::l^pb6bire (England) As vja$jff:'xi,.. man named Henry Russell wa! sentenced jto IQ^ears* penal servitude for a^i^glary :at Sjpndon. During Ms trial some rather affecting letters- to his wife' Were- read, and the attention they, attracted rleftto the editor of Li^vn's inquiring as to the history p£ the man, and the publication \n that newspaper of the following sketch af an, extraordinary career of crime : ? Bussell 'was born in the early part of 1840 at Islington, London, where in one of the numerous streets running off the New North-road his parents had lived for some time. His father was employed for^ a great many years as a warehouse man by a large city firm, while his mother Was the daughter of a tradesman who for nearly half a century had carried on busi ness in the North of London. Henry was the eldest of a family of four, and from the age of '5 until he was, quite 16 he went to school and received such an education that ids father ? succeeded in obtaining for him a situation in the. clerk's office of the firm where he himself was employed. After about two years the principal of the firm was so pleased with the atten tion and abilities of Henry that, he decided to -place him in the warehouse in charge of one of the departments. This change was the turning point in Russell's career. After about six months in Ms new capacity Russell's father had reason to complain of his son's late hours and the doubtful character of his com panions. Henry, always respectful to Ms parents, promised amendment. Two years soon passed away, but during this time Russell had, unknown to Ms parents, drifted slowly Tout surely into the meshes of criminality beyond all possible recovery. The father, Jionest old man that he was, told the masters he had faithfully served for over a quarter of a century that Ms son had fallen into bad company, and before any trouble came he had better l^ave the services of the firm. It was not a day too soon, for if rumor be true Rus sell's companions had induced him to become a party to a plot to rob the ware house of a large consignment of silk recently delivered to the warehouse from the Continent. His mother, as mothers wilTJ refused to believe that Henry was as 'bad as he was painted, and championed Ms cause when his father spoke harshly. ' The forebodings of the father only came too true, for less than 12 months from this date Jlenry was arrested on suspicion of being one of 'a gang who had knocked an old gentleman down in the City and jobbed.. -Mm. of his. gold watch. Absence of identification Baved Russell, and from this time little or ^nothing was known of Ms movements, save that he was seldom at home, and absolutely refused to give his parents any excuse for being away for ?weeks together. It was known, however, that Russell made periodical visits to the country, and that these visits were in the company of the passers of counterfeit , coin. Russell's success made him bolder, and* he decided to give up roving about the country and turn Ms attention to London. =? Working' with a 'pal,' RusselL passed some thousands of base coins, but not without detection on several occa sions ; but his suave manner and quiet air Btpod, him in good stead.. However, in the early part, of February, 1873, Russell was given into custody by a pub lican, and ultimately he was indicted at the Old Bailey for passing counterfeits. The evidence was very strong, and Russell was, in consequence of the bad character given him by the police, sentenced to 12 months' hard labor. Instead of acting as a deterrent, this imprisonment seems to have had a most pernicious .influence upon Russell, and to have brutalised him to an astonishing degree. The writer had an interview with one of KusselTs companions, who is responsible for the statement that up to the time of his imprisonment Russell ' would not hurt a ?worm,' fcut 'after he done Ms time he made it a practice to carry a revolver, and swore if ever the officer who gave evidence against .him crossed Ms path he would put » bullet through Mm.'' Finding London 'a bit too thick,' Bussell. again determined to work the country, and the Metropolitan police heard nothing of Mm until 1881. From the date of Ms discharge in 1874 until 1880, while in the provinces, Russell iad thev misfortune to ' fall ' (get into prison) twice, but we doubt if the Authorities at Scotland-yard knew of these two terms , of imprisonment (one of nine months and the other of 15 months), both of -wMch were for passing counterfeits, and Were not mentioned at the trial. In the early part of 1880 Rusaell returned to London, and for -two years was at the head of a gang of ** smashers,' whose headquarters were at a low public-house in Camber well. The house was raided by the police, and in a back room four men were found having in their possession some hundreds of counter ' f eit coins. Russell, however, managed to escape. . c- Again Russell disappeared, and was not heard of until September, 1881, when he was sentenced to 18 months at the Cen tral Criminal, Court for «' uttering.' '._ During the time he was awaiting trial at Hewgate Russell gave his fellow-prisoners to understand that it was the last time he meant to have anything to do with ihe *'iBqft** (counterfeit) forhe had an idea iqt £ **gopd game wMch would taring Boniething m 'worth working for.' WMle serving his sentence Russell carefully matured his plans and upon Ms discharge from prison in March, 1883- he ?vrrpte a letter '?; ;to '?'& **. fence n (receiver ', of stolen property.) complaining that the want of a little capital prevented, him from haying a **ij6?' *Jor at least £10,000 ^orlik of diamonds, . \ '\ ; _ \\( .'.'.';?/?.'?? *? . ... The plot was to rob the ojBS.ce of a Hat ton Garden diamond merchant, whose lat| clerk had through gambling fallen into the hands of one of RusselVs companions. This clerk imparted, the information that -j^pon certain dates Me lat« ;jaMa|^r^re -r^iiyed larjge consignments ?'??op-x'^^&ka;': ?c ^idaatnonds) from abroad, :&pBf;^^^^e^J^ui': clerk) was ready to assist in 'i^^rrying odt^of the robbery if a. -*;ja56periunder- ifajinding' was* ^xrived' itr-,.-T!i4-^^ito*f jstandini? ' was that Russell was t* find £200 out of the loib^1^ -ii& ^i.-^aistrapi^ and ?; to tMs Russell said he' wasyquite agreeable. The capital^eo£^i$f^ made up as follows i/^polsaind models of keys, £25.} . fanxCsss^^jjex^BUSBB, whilet watching the premises-, at £3 per week, £12 ; and the balanee^-£l3j was put down for expenses to Amsteicdaiae. The capitalist replied that he h*£d mbV^bJectMn to finding the money, 'but ib&t; jbLe, /f^ould not do so witho'ut being made aTcquainted with the details and the name ©jE the. merchant. It seems, however, thaj,%Russell declined to give the required information, and said he would go .** somewhere else.' -. It was during this, last imprisonment that Russell became acquainted - with a gang of forgers who obtained a ziumber of cheques from the cheq*ue bank, and, with the assistance of some .chemicals, succeeded in erasing the amount and inserting a much larger figure. The head of this gang was awaiting trial at the Old Bailey (he was sentenced to. 15 years' penal servitude) at the same time as Russell^and during^ Conversation he told Russell the name and address of a mail who; -would supply Mm withany numberof cheques he desired. Fail ing to get any ' capital??, to work the Hatton Garden affair #Russell said he would no longer put up with having no work to do. His companion had no suggestion to make, whereupon Russbll asked 'Mm if he were afraid of a dead body, -because whilst in prison he had thought of a scheme. Russell then explained one of .'the most curious as well as daring frauds ever thought out, and these frauds were to be practised upon undertakers. ? ,''?... It was at Wiliesden that the scheme was first tried. Russell had in the intervening time succeeded in obtaining a number of bjank cheque forms, and these he filled up for sums varying from £20 to £50. About 4 o'clock one afternoon in May, 1883, Russell, dressed in deep black, walked into/ the shop of an under taker in Wiliesden and asked, the assistant if his master were in. ?,'' The assistant ex plained that Ms master would be but a short time, and asked the future customer to be seated. Whilst -waiting for the' arrival of the master the assistant engaged the customer in conversation, and to put it briefly during the space of about 25 minutes. Russell simply 'pumped' the assistant and made himself master of cer tain facts and details of . the business which proved very useful] The undertaker arrived, and Russell explained in a most becoming manner that his brother-in-law had 'died that morning, and he had been recommended to pla0e. the arrangements for the burial in. the hands of Mr. ? by Miss J ? , who spoke Mghly of the man ner in which he had carried out the funerals of her two sisters whoai she had unfortunately recently lost* ?' In this way Russell quite charmed the undertaker, and in the result having explained the kind of grave, coffin, and funeral he. wanted, de sired the undertaker to give him a price for the whole thing. Bapiclly the under taker totalled up the whole cost, which he said would come to .£20. ?« Very -well,' said RusselL ' 1 will just consult my poor sister, and call upon you later in the even ing, when doubtless I shall have a cheque from my brother for yopf.' According to his promise RusseR called and asked the undertaker to make out the account and receipt it. 'Ah,' said; Russell, I am very sorry. My brother, thought I said £30, and has given me a cheque for that amount, but it matters little j just give me the difference, £10, in gold, will you?' The address of the deceased was in the very best part of Wiliesden, and the under taker made not the slightest objection, and promptly handed ?*' Mr* James Le Royt ' the £10 in sovereigns. Towards 9 o'clock Mr. Undertaker paid a visit to the address given, and to the servant who answered the door he explained his object in calling. The servant, .in turn, called her mistress, to whom; the undertaker ex pressed Ms regret for the loss of so excellent a husband. The lady had ' some doubts about the sanity, of her visitor. She told, him that he must have mistaken the house, and that her husband was on the premises alive and well. The undertaker showed her the address given Jby JRuesell, and said he felt sure that he had made no mistake. The - lady then called her husband, who was having dinner, in order that the un dertaker might have ocular . proof of the truth of her statement. Hardly had the first undertaker been, gone half-an-hour before another knock was' heard, and again the lady of the house was re quested to conduct undertaker No. 2 to ihe death chamber fjor the purpose of taking the necessary; measurements for a coffin. Again the i master was shown to be in the flesh — ?much,' T*e feel bound to . say, to . the .horror of * the undertakers, who '. !npw realised that they had been the .victims, of a very clever fraud, both the cheques .being worth less. Whilst talking to the assistant of undertaker No. I Russell learned that Mr'. ? f who kept' . a ^ public-house in the immediate 'neighborhood, had often changed Ms ^^ster's cheques, and before quitting SJ^iii^scfen Russell suc ceeded in inducing the landlord to cash a cheque of . the' ulajterta^r's. for £20, which, he ; (Rus'self) ^stated had just been paid to him forclotii'lid ;had brought down. The signature ^was, of course, ob tained from ike 'r'xep&j;^h -'for :the furietal expenses which ;Mi.;-^-e-ti tad given Rus sell.

'' When I gptjtb;: the house,' said Bussell, « T fbund; th^t they had made some 'arrangements witli Mr. S ?.. , and that he had actually rnaide a coffin. Well, I find he is a Veiy- JfeiiiaU; man, and I don't think, considering ;I aim one of my sister's executors, that I, ifian. allow him to carry out the furieraL -fit come to you because I know a Mr. Balman, and having mentioned- that my sister at Bedford had died, he recommended me to ' you, as he, was a friend of yours ; but I don't see .my way clear at all. What am'! tt- *U- with the other man. now he has made -*^e' coffin ? ' «? Oh,' replied the undertal^r, ' just tell him that you are going to make other arrangements, and then ask Mm what he wants for the coffin and the trouble he has been put to, and then pay him — that is what I should do.' ' 'V&ry; well,' xeplied Russell, «' I'll go down and Ho so at once, and come back tb-you.' - A little later Russell appeared, and exhibited to the undertaker Ms rival's receipt for? £§-' the price of the coffin, &e.; It may be^ as well here to tell the story of how 3ie obtained the receipt. Russell went to another undertaker in a small way of business, and explained that his sister had just given birth to a stillborn child, and he would be very glad if he would make a small coffin, aee Dr. ? , and make, arrangements for *he buriaL Russell then asked him whether he had a book showing the different styles of coffins, and whilst the undertaker Was hunting for Ms pattern-book Russell managed to abstract from a case on the counter several printed memoranda jforms and envelopes. Then Russell, suddenly Re membered that he had an appointment 'to keep in the town and hurriedly left. the shop, promising to come again later in tlie day. It was on one of the memo randa forms that Russell wrote 'Reed, of W. Wesson, Esq., the sum of £6- f6r coffin for Miss A. Wesson, No. 21,-——, Bedford.' : The production of the receipt of course inspired confidence ; first it established the fact that a Miss Wesson had died, and, secondly, that she .was in ben coffin...; it also showed that Russell was desirous of placing business in the way of Messrs. ? . Russell then described the kind of funeral he wanted, with feathers, palls, &c;, and asked hoW much it would come to. '£15,' replied the undertaker. . 'Very well, make out a bill, and I will pay you, I have just got a cheque from my cousin, James Wesson, for £20.' The 'account was duly made out, stamped, and. rer ceipted, when Russell said, ' I must send £5 back to London to-night, so I tMnk joii had better give me your cheque for the balance, and it will save me getting a post office order. Don't cross the cheque, as it is going to a poor relative to buy black with, and they will want to change it in.: London.' The undertaker gave- '/Mr. Wesson' the cheque for £5, and after having fixed the -late on which the funeral was to take place, and partaken of a . glass of wine at the before-mentipned. hotel, Mr. Wesson bid the undertaker good day. Half an hour later a cheque was presented at the -Bedford branch of thV bank for £50, and- Mr. Wesson requested that the money should be paid in gold. The five pounds had been cleverly: turned into fifty pounds, and .a nought placed after the £5. This fraud Russell always pointed to with great pride, and ' Undertaker Jimmy' was never too tired or too busy to tell this story, of course to an admiring circle of selected friends. After the frauds at Bedford, which led to the burglar Bussellbeingdubbed ♦'Under taker Jimmy,' a visit to Luton was sugges ted. His companion advised going straight to London, but Russell pleaded that their luck was in, and that they had better go on. Russell being 'governor,' he of coarse had Ms own way; but Russell's, lucky star was not in the ascend ant, for he narrowly escaped being ' pinched ' (captured) at Luton. Russell had succeeded in getting the manager of an undertaker's ' business to ac cept a cheque for £20 in payment of a bill of £12, the cost of the funeral of his son, and to give him (Russell) the balance in gold. The manager, having occasion to be in that part of the town, called -at the address given by Russell, only iojind that he had been victimised, the house being in the occupation of a widow and her daughter. Finding he had been duped, the manager thought it waV.liis duty to at once acquaint Ms master^ Tvijfch the facts, and the latter residing in an adja cent village, the manager went to the rail Tray station to take the train. TbcMs poxz prise he fancied he saw Russell on the up platform, and crossing overlie looked into the carriage and saw Russell getrini. Russell, too, had* not failed to observe the manager, but before he could decide WMt course he should pursue the train st^a&eji; out of the station^ When telling this:€i|^ Russell said, 'You should haVe's^ifi H-^ ? (Rus8ell*s companion) when : 1 ifaiA him -that 4he manager .'and1 ,-i&\' 'i§-i*' detective) ' had' joined the train:j:lie4-T|as nearly dropping, and looked as wMte as# ghost; he was trembling, and his tel^b.

Tf I had to. te hanged the ne^t minute I could not have moved for liaugking. Then he began to shout that His''b^pk was broken, and I thought the sta|idi^people— f or owing to his not having junked wnen I did the station platform wa&i-abf; very far off — would hear him. I told *MmL that if he did not shut up I would; put a bullet through him, _ and he sopii shut it when I showed him the bark iiig^ironi (revolver). After a little wMle we -managed to get over the fence into a field, and seeing a light we struck out for it. The nearer we got to it the greater dis tance 'it seemed away, and although we had plenty of money I thought we had better have a * doss * (sleep) under the hedge. 'We soon fell asleep and did not wake until daybreak, and then we took the train :f or London ; but before we went to - the station I made H — — put on my clothes' and wear my hat. You ought to haye heard me laugh; you would have killed yourself to have seen him in a high siakhat.' : In ~J 883 Russell -turned the death, of an old. gentleman at Highgate to nefarious account, and contrived to cheat both the sister of the deceased and a local under taker out of a goodly number of pounds. Jls in . several previous - instances, the fraud was accomplished by sheer audacity rather, than any special cunning. For some time. Russell was singularly successful in carrying out frauds on undertakers. He seems.to have stuck at nothing, seizing any opportunity that offered itself to abstract a cheqhe, or a letter, or any document that he could turn to account when visiting someone else. But at length, wMlst at tempting a fraud of this character at Tunbridge, he was caught and committed for trial on a charge of forgery. The Treasury solicitor tdok up_the matter, and a writ of habeas, corpus having been granted ~hy the Home Secretary, RusseJ.1 was brought up at Wool wich police court, where further charges were preferred against him. This re sulted, in his being finally tried at the Central Criminal Court in April, 1884, when he received a sentence of 18 months' hard labor. ' RussftU was released- in the autumn of 1885, arid at once resumed his old work. A caution, issued by the CMef Commissioner of Police, made undertakers more than usually careful, but Russell escaped capture until the autumn of 1886, wh«%He was again tried at the Old Bailey, aiuL this time sentenced to penal servitude for five years. He could not have been out long before he committed the bur glary at Swindon whieh led to his capture ia London in April last. Russell, prior to Ms trial at the Wilt shire assizes, wrote to his wife in a hopeful strain, bidding her cheer up and not be downhearted. When captured by the police he had on the spur of the moment said the case meant 10 years for Mm ; but, after Mr. Justice Cave had passed this identical sentence, he wrote as follows : JMEy_:3J!ear Harriet?— I cannot attempt to hide from you that I am quite broken hearted ; my sentence is so hard, so very much more severe than I expected it to be, that even now I have not fully realised all that it means. I feel just like one ?stupefied. The only reason, the judge stated, for passing so severe a sentence was that , I am older than the other man. I looked all round the court to see you, and your not coming to see me I felt quite as keenly as my cruel /sentence. My life has been a hard one i!rom ? iny boyhood. The only real comfort and happiness I have known has been with you ; and BQ3£ I haye lost liberty and happiness, and all but your lore, for years to come. He goes on to ask- that efforts may be inade to induce the Home Secretary to grant a remission or a mitigation of his sentence, and proceeds to say — ' H you saw a man drowning would you not throw him a, rope or a* flag to give him a chanoe to save himself, and will you do less for me ? Will you not rather do all you can kf help me ??, If you could see me and feel as I feel, you would move heaven and earth, to help me. Now, my darling, you must do the best you can, and I am sure if you do not let your trouble drive you to drink you will get on very well. Ton must not think you have lost me for ever ; I shall come back, be assured of that. When Mtb. — — —*a boy went away his parents did not think he was ever coming back, and when Tichborne got 14 years, no one thought he was gone away for ever. If any inquire for me you can tell them how I am, well in body but very ill in mind.
