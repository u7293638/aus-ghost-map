The Christmas Goose. To the Enrron.— Sir,— Professor Drnpor, in liis " Intellectual Devolopmont of Europo," states that "tho mcdimval Christians sym bolised the Holy Ghost bv tho figure of a fooso. "The crusaders led on by Potor tlio tormltworoprecodedatthohoadofthoarmy by thoHoly Ghost, undcrthoshapeofawMto gander, in company of a gont." Can any of your readers inform mo whether tho Christmas gooso of to day is a survival of this rolio of tho past ? In tlio course of ocntunes it may havo been trans muted, eo to say, into an ideo- pophagy, as tho hot cross bun may he said similarly to sym bolise tho Cruoiflxion. The earliest historical reoordof a like " Cbmmomorial Feasting" is probably tho mosalo command of tho eating of tho Pasohal lamb and unleavened bread.— Yours, &o.; FoLK-veuisr.
