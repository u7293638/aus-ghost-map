Mr, W.vF.t:,Campion considered the price, nf '.heer .was/too low;to!allqw'. the publicans; a fair living, and .he. contended that it- jwasli oiily; ' reasonable that they, should receive some profit on their husiness.; He proposed that the price of beer) from August 1, be 8d. per, pot out of doors; Mr; Clinch seconded the motion, and asked: the' brewers present—provided Messrs. ; Haussen .& Catchlove did not. supply Mr. Tux ford—whether they would not do so. Mr. "Chapman (Simpis & Chapman) said he .thought it waa unwise to attempt to coerce Mr. Tuxford;. and if the town' brewers refused to supply him, • he; believed he could go-"to country brewers. In reply to Mr. .Clinch, Messrs.,Chapman, Syme, and Blades, "stated that "they " would not' supply I Mr. Tuxford providedrthe others did not.do so. ! Mr) Trapman (of Haussen & Catchlove's) thought the question was not a fair one to ask the biewei'S^andt her could not' state: definitely, "what the, action of his firm might-he... The: resolution, was ..carried ^unanimously,) 1 The Qhairman suggested as they had agreed upon the price outside, that the price at the bar should be 2id., and 3d. in the .parlor. One or two gentlemen thought the suggestion would be unworkable in.;-the". hstck streets^-and nothing definite was decxaed'.upon. A ^deputation was appointed_.to.wait -upon Mr. Tuxford, to-ask hiip to waive his determination and - agrhe to \ the . resolution passed, - and! it was also suggested that the deputation , should- request the brewors':not to supply honsobqlders with 5-gallon- kegs, of b00r-at the same price as the publicans.
