It may be said that English capitalists send the money here for their own benefit No doubt this is the case, j but we benefit by its presence also, and for us to do aught to check the flow of I banking capital would be worse than folly It would be a bad thing for the banks in question as here the colonies to lose confidence in them, but as there are two hides to every question, so it would, be by no means to our advantage if English tain thats avoid to lose confidence in us, and able to withdrAW then funds, or any part of them, and employ) them else where and as a bank failure is, we must remember also that the shock is lessened when the loss falls upon Publish capital in such a case, Ailulo colonial depositors may lose something, yet there are comparatively few if any colonial shareholders to be called upon to pay up also Without entering fully upon these points, AAO have said enough to show the danger of taking an) step must the influence of panic All banking legislation will require to be carefully considered Investing to the latest incident of the situation, it may be said that the attention of the alarmists Aias directed to the London Ohm tired Bank by two recent misfortunes 'Iho in st is the heavy Robbery already alluded to But this was not a trade loss It was simply a theft, and should in no way affect the stability of the institution The second is that the retirement of Mr But as from the Austin allow management has led to domestic dissensions Some share holders have been moved to ask questions at the meetings, and that pro- ceding heart does an institution good By this time probably the quests of the London Chartered Bank are con a meed of their own food., for they must see how it is possible to put a meaning upon their action aaIiicIi was wiser in tended Such misfortunes as those who have mentioned may happen to all institutions in turn 'The situation is as thoroughly understood by the banks clients here, and are a venture to say that even yesterday's ghost of a run would have been impossible but for the present unsatisfactory state of the note on dilation the old belief that the banks would protect each other's notes for the sake of their corporate credit has been destroyed by the Oriental failure, and as the notes me in the hands of John, Dick, and Han), who have no knowledge of banks of banking, and who have no interest in the institutions, the air ord, it seems, has only to be passed about to produce a scare amongst these tempo rain) and accidental creditors and then one set of men commence a um, there is a danger of others being drawn into thcAoitex Our opinion that it it is a great mistake on the part of the banks not to protect the Oriental notes has been already expressed As it is Are fear the note issue has become a source of danger to the banks, and tins while. little, if any), profit attaches to it it will be to the banks' own interests that un statements should be made at once to render the local paper as sound in the popular estimation as are minted sovereigns Whether " society papers" are the cause of the consequence of one of the social maladies of the present day it would be unimportant to determine Then intimate connexion with it is too obA ions to be disregarded 'They are, so to speak, the superficial pustules as Inch denote the character of the disease that affects society) A paper of this kind fulfils the function of the ancient scandalmongei of the English village or COUlltty tOAAIl, m he used to go from house to house disseminating the tittle tattle of the place, dropping malicious innuendoes here, and scattering slan serious imputations 01 collections there Of gossips of a somewhat higher type, and occupying a AAlllci SpllCIO, SHER.IDAN 1918 given us some mineral examples mindy SncciAvell, Mrs Candour, and son Ben Jamin Backbite, and Pen has left us a general picture of them in his account of the ladies at Hampton Court, aaIibio ' One speaks the glory of the British queen And one describes a charming Indian screen A third interprets motions looks indeed, At eA cr) Avord a reputation dies If Aonisov and Sir I u failed to laugh the tube out of existence by coa ei in. them with ridicule in the passes of the 'I altar] and the b;
