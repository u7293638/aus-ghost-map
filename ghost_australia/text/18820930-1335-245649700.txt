Hayler, & Batty their new Commercial directory, and it is ui every sense a dangerouB rival to the one we have so longbeen accustomed to. £n tbe-first place tbe book is exceedingly well-printed, and is generally got up iu good etyle; its arrasiejnent also is very convenient, and doubtless advertisers will jutte the fact with satisfaction that &eir;'advertisements are inserted between the reading matter (instead of all being cramped together) which is a decided improvement. Besides the usual Alphabetical Directory, there is arranged a very complete T'rade and Professional Directory, which' will be found extremely useful. There ig also a Towusbipg Directory, which to iMUguess-men and others will be very, bandy, as at a glance the name« of tbe leading citisens can be seen. Altogether tbe publicilaon^or a first - issue is a really good one, aiti there appeara to have been a laige amount of lime and trouble taken in making it as oomplete as possible.

The Sunday-school was reported as being prosperous, and 5$ of - the scholars had •joined the church during the year. In the evening a fellowship- meeting was held, but there was a very poor attendance. BAROSSA GOLOFIKLDS.—A correspondent supplies the following:—About two years ago a memorial-was sent by the inhabitants of' Barossa Goldfielda.to the Minister of Education, stating that their children were growing up in ignorance, tbe nearest school being four or five miles distant, and asking that one might be opened in their neighborhood. The Government promptly made enquiries and found such to be the case. A small wooden building was 'obtained and a teacher appointed, and now a' marked difference cau be aeen, in the improvement of those attending- the school About six months ago tenders' were-'invited for the Section of a schoolroom and " teacher's residence. Messrs, ' Taylor & Forgie, of Gawler obtained'the contract at about £400, and tbe work is now nearly finished, the painters giving it the .finishing touch. The parents haviug Expressed their wish to the teacher that upon the completion of the building they should have a picnic or treat iven to the children, tile tune fixed was teptember 25 ; bat I regret to say they were obliged to bold it in the smaU old building, as the painters were still at the new puts. The parents a^ted most liberally )iy supplying. the tables with; the choicest provfeitfh, of which about 120 partook, inclndim; the children, and visitors. At 1 o'clock the children were called in to dinner, which wa* uicely arranged on three tables. I noticed xv'ha| I think was a good plan, a aide talrie on which were roast fowls, large ham, an ) rouud of beef ; and. three ladies were busily engageil in carving, "So" that plates could he replenished without waiting. These good things were followed by custards, jam tarts,, and cream, ad libitum. After dinner the children returned to their sports, .and the tables wane wpnodily.prepared for tlie adnlts. and if we may jud^e by smiling countenances they all enjoyed the good fare jwoviiled. At 5 o'clock the children were called into to-tea, after which the. parents and visitors. Abodt £4 was sub^'ri'jed for prizes among 40 scholars, and it was so arranged that they all got something. About 7 o'clock a gentleman proposed a vote of thanks to the friends for providing s'ich a feast^vbich was carried by acclauiuiatioii. the scholars giving three hearty cheers. A party from Sandy Creek when a?MUfc to return home found thems»dves in a fix. The horse had got loose and could not be found ; after an hour's fruitless search a friend offered them to drive them ; and during the night the horse came home. The weather was showery, which prevented some friends coming from Willi amstown and other places. A SHAMELKW PAIR.—On Saturday, July 8, a young woman applied to the magistrate at tbe Thames Police-cojirt, Ijoudon, for his advice. She stated that she was martia l a abort time ago, and haul been very happy with her husband until her mother, who was a widow, cameto lire with them. Her husband's manner then changed towards her.-he Jraagrn^ cool ;and offrhaod with her, while his '^pt&nner; to her. jhotber was very warm and affectionate. She remonstrated with bim ; but he only lan^hed at her and told her that she was dreaming. She did not like to «ay anything to her mother, but at last made up her • mind th*t she would speak to her upon the subject; but before she could- get an opportunity of doing so liar hupband and mother eloped together. The applicant .was farther understood~to'say that her mother had money, whilst she had none, and she believed that that was the bait which allured her husband. The magistrate told her that he was sorry he could not assist her. If abe wanted her bnsband to support her she must go to the parish authorities, and they—if -he was within reach—would, find her- husband, -anti compel him £6 «Saii)&in4ief;: applicaiit declared that. abe would rather starve, and left the court.

V, Mac4o»ald, an English authority, lian to eny on itbe subject of a good drink for usein the jUrvcst field. He writes:—"In harvest time thin oatmeal gruel is tbe liest. most nourishing, and cheapest drink for the field laborer. It quenches thirst speedily, and gives more strength and endurance than beer. It has j been couclnsively proved by experiments i that non-alcoholic drinkers utterly lieat j alcoholic imbibers in hard work, especially i when exposed to the heat of the sun. Beer i drinkers go ahead at first, but tlieir energies soon flag, and they are much more ji | exhausted at the end of tbe day. Oatmeal driuk is easily and simply jnade by putting the meal -into cold water by degrees as it is strained through the fingers, stirring it all tbe while with a short stick to prevent knots' until the- mixture become* homogeneous, iu fche proportion of a tahiespoonful to a quart ,of water, adding a little sugar to suit the taste. Then boil thoroughly, and let it stand till -cold. Wbey, skimmed milk, and cold tea are much better than beer, but none of these beverages equal the oatmeal drink. Where oatmeal cannot be got other meal sill do, but uot so welL" ."You are a very\iaugfaty boy, Charley; I shall have to buy a whip for you." " May I play with it afterwards, mamma
