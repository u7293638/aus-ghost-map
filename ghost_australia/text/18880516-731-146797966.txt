ELECTION MATTERS. The Wide Bay election comes off to morrow, also those for Albert, Buliraba, Lockyer, Moreton, Oxley and Kosewood. Saturday's elections include Balonne, Bowen, Bourke (2), Carnarvon, Flinders, Normanby, Toowong, Warrego, Wootha kata. On Wednesday next the only election will be for Stanley, and the following Saturday the seventh aud last battle will come off, when members for Bulloo, Car pentaria, Cook and Gregory will be elected. Hodkingson has given up the ghost for Bourke, so his torch-light procession at. Croydon and other tliedrical an ics have proved of no avail. The North, aB a matter of fact, is tbe stroughold of Sir Thomas, b -cause they know that the future Premier wiil do them justice. Tbe South admire him for this, especially as he will do so without risking the in tegrity of the colony. It is said that next Thursday and Saturday's elections will give a good many more seats to Sir Samuel. Tbey may, but it is always as well to remem ber that only interested parties announce that fact. The difference between Tozer and Flood is that tbe latter is a declared M'llwraitbian and Tozer an old one who bas cbauned his creed to suit his am bition. No one was more surprised than Tozer -himself when it was announced that he was to be put up in the Griffith interest. The dissatisfied of Miry borough who cannot understand that Sir Samuel Grif fith, tbe self styled Liberal chief, hag been thrown over by the Liberals in other parts of tbe colony, are trying to make out that it is M'llwraith and Co.'s money which is doing the work. Why then did none of it come to Mary borough. Tbis always was one of tbe doubtful electorates, and if the Opposi tion had a fund, as it is said, of Â£20,000 to work upon, some of it surely would have leaked this way. However, the list of subscriptions for all King's expenses is open to tbe t public gaze and the names only of Maryborough people are down.
