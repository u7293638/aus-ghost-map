Cardew ; secretary, Mr. Abel Hyde: The first day's racing in connection with the summer meeting of tho Queensland Turf Club was held at Eagle Farm yesterday, and passed off suooessfully tind enjoyably. The interest taken in the gathering was indicated at quite an early hour in the .day by the number of visitors who wore seen making their way to the course by train, tram, ana other conveyance. Gradually the numbers swelled until the grandstand and St. Leger reserves presented a orowded appearance, and .there was quito a representative and fashionable gatheriug. A very large propor tion of thoso who assembled consisted of laaics, whoso bright costumes added in effect to an animated sceno. Many country visitors also were in attendance. At this timo of the year tho courso and its surroundings do not wear a vary inviting appearance, and the grass very plainly showed tho want of soaking rain. It was clearly indicated, however, that the committee had not neglected anything, and, as usual, everything possiblo was done for tho comfort of visitors. The day was rather warm, tho heat though being temporod in tho afternoon by a mailing breeze. The programme arranged for tho day consisted of seven races, and these were curried through without mishap or unpleasantness. Keen interest was centred in the sport, and this was accentuated by tho fact that several southern horses were contestants amongst the fields in a number of events. Good raoing resulted, and there wore several close finishes. The sum of £7,114 passed' through the totalisator during tho day. On the corresponding day last year tho sum registered was £G,375, so that yesterday shows an inorease of over £700. Tho betting was in favour of the hooks, as tho first favour ites were defoated on all save two ocoasions; Speculation was very brisk on the Queensland Cup, which resulted in an easy win for Gold smith, who, on previous running, scarcely seemed to have the slightest chance. Baokeri were very much inclined to favour southern homes, but they suffered disappointment oii three occasions. Hero it may bo remarked that southern riders who had come to Bris bane Bpeoially for the meeting were much more successful than the visiting horses, as Huxley piloted Goldsmith to victory in the Cup, and Callinan scored two wins, having the mounts on Siren and Mulgah in'the Doncaster Handicap and tho First Novico Handicap re spectively. The Naval Headquarters Bund were stationed on the lawn, and, with excel lent music, added a good deal to the harmony of the gathering. The field that went cut to contest the Trial Handicap numbered . 19 starters. Several of them at the weights appeared to have an equal ohance, but baokers disregarded the local horses and went solidly for the southern visitor Fluker. TVith the large field the books, however, could afford to' give liberal odds, and tho offer of "5 to 1 the field" was only to bo expected. Gauntlet was next in favour and then Atlantic, ' but against the others long prices were quoted. Investors, or rather the majority of them, did not make a very 'good boginning. Fluker flattered them by leading for about 6 furlougs of the journoy, when the field closed on him. Atlantic then appeared in front, hut the handsome looking, although disappointing Ruby K. had to be reokoned with, and she, putting in a very fast run on the outside, succeeded in winning by half a length. The favourito was about a head away, third. The owner of Atlantic entered a protest against the winner for orossing, which was immediately considered by the stewards. They considered itffivolousaud dis missed it, and also directed that the £5 lodged as a deposit should he forfeited. From the Flying Handicap, Heotor II., Satrap, and Prince Bismarok were withdrawn, 'leaving a field of Id to contest the event. Telegraph and Veronica were made equal favourites at the odds of 4 to 1 against, and Araxes was the bent supported of the others. ' Veronica never-showed out, but Telegraph asserted his superiority over tho distance, and also demon strated his ability to curry weight, as despite the impost of 10 Bt., he ran the distauce in tho excellent timo of 1 min. 15£ seas. Notro Dame was second after run ning an excellent race, while Araxes was third, both being oloso up to tho winner. The Queensland Cup was the next event on -tho card, the scratchings being Musket aud Angler. This left a field of Id horses to go to the post. Evor since tho probable starters had been made known tho chances of the horses had been freely discussotl. Boscobel had ruled as favourite from the outset; and he certainly looked the pick of tho handicap. He had a light weight, and it wus known that ho could get tho distance. On ' Saturday, however, his supportors were inclined to waver until he won the Albion Park Handi cap in good time, and this re-established their confidence in bim. When betting started his quotation was lowest, and at starting time ruled at 5 to 1 aguinst. Goldsmith was next in favour, his prico being 0 to 1 against. The reason, however, was more tho confidence of his owner than anything brilliant that Gold smith hud done. At Saudgate, a fow weeks ago, he ran very indiff crently, but sinoo theu he had done good work on the track, and his owner backed him for a large stake. Amor andAdnaw found a good deal of support. Amor is admittedly a good marc, and her winning of tho Cup last year proved that she could stay. The only doubt was whether she eould carry the heavy impost (top weight) over the long journey. ' But little was known of Adnaw, and the support uccorded to him was probably because ho had the services of Gough. in the saddle; Nevermore, Reprobate; and The Guard were given a chance, and among the light weights The Afghan wus singled out. Therace was an interesting one, although luck ing a close finish. Mr. Kirk got the field away to a good Btnrt, Amor being the quickest to move. Sho did not uot as paoeinaker for long, though, us Master Bernio rushed to the front and set out to make tho pace merry. Past the stand the first time he led from Drake, Boscobel, and Amor, Goldsmith being near the rear of the field, as was Nevermore. There wus no material alteration to the buck where Reprobate made a move and drew up, with tho leader. Past the 6 furlongs Master Bornie was going strongly, but tho riders of tho others.now bogan to shake their mounts up, and Goldsmith and Nevermore began to work forward. Stiil Master Bornie was not overtukon until tho straight was reached. Thon Amor, Goldsmith, Heribali, Nevermore, and Brise-de-uuits appeared on the scene. Amor's victory was shouted, but Goldsmith smothered ull opposition, for as tho' furlong post whs rcaohed he took aommand, and leaving the field, won- very easily by four, lengths. Amor fiuished two lengths in front of Meribah, with Nevermore fourth. Gold-, smith's win was an exceedingly popular one,: more particularly as Mr. Tulty (the owner) made no secret of his opinion about, the horse's ability to win. The Sydney jookey Huxley liad the mount on the winner, and; ho rode a well judged race. Amor's second was a creditablo one, considering the weight, while Mcribah surprisedrnany by semiring third I place as very few gave .him a "ghost of a chanoe." Nevermore finished very fast at tlio end, as did tho erratio Briso-des-nuits.. Master Bernie's performance, taking his condition into consideration, shows what a sterling horse he is, mid it is certain that' with judioious training many first-olass events would be annexed by him. The favourito rau well to the straight, but then died away. Reprobate mndo a bold bid once, aud Mist was oloso up with tho front division most of tho way, but nono of tho' others showed any brilliance. Tho time for, tho journey wan 3 mine. 34 J sees., which is equal to the timo of Amor last year. After tho Gup, tho Doncaster Handicap for two- year-olds oloimed attention, thero boing seven starters. Biiekors once more supported a southern visitor, and mads Mr. Kelso's b.g. Loch Loekie a warm favourite. Thin calculation was upsot by another southerner, in Siren, who won from Bluelight, with the favourito ocoupying third position. Out of a field of 13 starters in the First Novice Han dicap, Vivandiere and Hardcaso . shared tho honours for pride of place in the betting at the odds of 4 to 1 against. Miilguh and Caddnleon were next in demand, 7 to 1 being obtainable about them. Fortune, however, still refused to favour tho popular fancy, the race being won by Mulgah from Saturn and Cadmus. Having won tho First Novice, Mulgah was at.. once withdrawn from the SellingRace, leaving a fiold of nino to faco the harrier in that event. Czar had the lion's shara- of the support, and at tho close 6 to 4 against was the best offer obtain able about him. Safety was second in favour at 3 to 1, the next prico quoted being 7 to 1. Battier mado the pace until tho dis tance post was reached, where Czar took command and won by two lengths. The winner was put up at auotion and bought in by his owner for 72 guineas, which, as lie was entered to be sold for £40, means a benefit of over £30 to tho club. From the December Handicap, the soratohings were Adnaw and Tho Afghan, leaving ten to contest tho ovent. For the third timo during tho day investors pinned their. faith to a southern horse, in Golden Ring, and for the third timo thoy suffered ' defeat. Golden Ring was quoted at 0 to 4 against, uud Athlono was uoxt quoted at 4 to 1. The result camo as a surprise, the winner turning up in a rank outsider in Circe, who bos "the reputation of being. able to gallop, but who has raroly shown any brilliauco in public. Sho won olevorly by a neck from tho favourite, "after the latter had held tho ' leading position all tho way until a short distance from the post. Tho dividend returned, .£11 0 s., was the largest paid at the meeting.
