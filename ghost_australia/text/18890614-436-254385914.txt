FOOLS AND THEIR MONEY. Fools and their money are proverbially said to be soon parted, and an excellent illustration of this is to be found in the rise and fall of a certain quack, by name Louis Crespin, who has been selecting the Department at Gars, in France, as the field of his operations. M. Crespin professed to have almost unlimited powers in curing the ills to which man and beast are heir, and so great was the confidence he inspired that be had consulting rooms in most of the towns in the department, attending, moreover, at all the fairs, to which he was driven in his own carriage and pair. On an unlucky dayfor him, however, it chanced that a ceitain wealthy peasant came to consult him about the illness of a pig. The animal, according to the quack, was possessed of the devil, and to remedy matters the peasant was told he must pay a certain sum of money to have masses celebrated. This the credulous client did, and the pig getting no better, a matter of another 400f. went from its owner's pockets into the charlatan's hands. Still the grunter remained in an alarming state of health, and at length it gave up the ghost. The peasant, exasperated at the loss of the pig, and at the loss of his money as well, lodged a complaint with the police, in consequence of which M. Louis Crespin has been arrested on the charge of swindling. For some time to come, therefore, he will probably be unable to ride about in bis carriage and pair.
