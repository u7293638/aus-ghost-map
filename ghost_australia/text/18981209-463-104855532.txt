POETRY. ? -»? LAVENDER. The waring corn was green and gold, The damask cones blown. The bees aud busy spinning-wheel. Kept up a drowsy drone — 'When Mistress Standisli, folding down Her linen, white as snow, Between it laid the lavender. One summer long ago. The slender spites of preyinb-green. Still moist with morning dew, .Recalled a garden sweet with box Beyond the ocean's blue — An English garden, qnaint itnd old, She nevermore might know ; And so she dropped a homesick tear That summer long ago. The yellow sheets grew worn and thin, And fell in many a shred ; 'Some went to bind a soldier'* wound*, And some to shroud the dead. And Mistress Standish rests her soul Where graves their iihadows throw And violets blossom, planted there In summers 'long ago. But still between the royal rose And lady-lily tall, ^Spring* up the modest lavender Bitride the 'cottage wall. The spider spreads her gonaanier Across it to and fro— The ghost of linen laid to bleach One summer long ago.
