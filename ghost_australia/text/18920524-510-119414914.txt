THE'abo've' spbrts will eventuate to 'dtty'^Triestiay), and 'ah6uld prove a success.1 -The secretaries have -worked well, and are to be congratulated on the good nominations ; it-is hoped that the adjustments' of the handicappers will prove Satisfactory, and that the. acceptance will also be. good. Looking at the allotments it will be tound tbat Ryrie occiipiesthe place of honor in $be Opening Handicap, 2 yards, and can't win. Goodwin and Bollard, 21 yards, nave no bIiow, but Fraeer on the same mark if he -will only keep up his pecker will give this handicap a big shaking. P. Sullivan on 7 yards will make things 'buzz' if he is in the humor. I think the winner will be found to come from 8 yards ; those who have a show ori that mark are H. Attwater and J.'or W. Hayes, whichever is spun, but I think Attwater will -- cop.' On 9 yards Solomon and Matthews are well in it. They will finish something like this ;— H.! 3. Attwater, 8 yards .. 1 8' Matthews, 9 yards . . . . 2 W. Salomon, 9 y aria .. .. 3 P. Solliran, 7 yarJs .. ..4 In the A.F.S.G.A. Handicap Billy Evans is scratch (14 yards), and if in form would run well. M. Coffey, 17, yards, can't win. J. McCarron, 18 yatqjs,' is a good man, but I don't think he can get up. Scott, 19 yards, wil) want to show more pace than he ever has done to get a drum. Good win, J. Sullivan, and J. Bollard,. on 20 yards, can't win a heat. I. Cogan, 21 yards, hasn't a ghost of a show. V. Frazer on 21 yards and H. Attwater on 22 will run well. The winner will come from the 23 yards mark. There are only three men on that mark who have any show, and they are Blewitt (who will win if he's 'spun,' and don't you forget it), S. Matthews, and W. Solomon. There are some fair men on 25 yards, and those who will run well will be H. M. Wallace, D. Flynn, J. and W. Hayes, and T. E. Dunn. P. J. Seery on 25 yards I don't know from a crow. The only other ped. from this down to the limit (31 yards) who will run up will be P. Bollard, 29 yards, and he will give it a big shaking. To select four men I will send them like this : — G. Blewitt, 23 yards ? 1 P. Bollard, 29 yards .. ..2 H. Attwater, 22 yard* .. .. 3 8\. Matthews, 23} ardo .. .. 4 With Dunn and Solomon to upset the ' pot.' These selections are made before the acceptances are due, and of course the men selected may clash in their heats
