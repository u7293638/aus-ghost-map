SUNDAY SERVICES. SI. ANDREW'S CATHEDRAL. At St. Andrew's Cathedral the Primate preached in the morning, and the rite o? ordination was conferred on the Eev. T. H. D. Morgan, of St. Paul's Col lege, and the Rev. Frederick J. Dillon, of Moore Theological College, and they were set aside to the priesthood. The Primate's text was taken from Psalm xx., 5, Proverbs xviii., 10, and Matthew xxviii., 19. His discourse referred to the special services which were being held that day on behalf of the Church Society, the function of which is to' assist struggling ohnrcb.es in localities \i here the parishion ers are unable to support without aid a minister. Then, speaking of the ceremony of ordination of priests, he called to mind the Saviour's, parting injunc tion to his disciples after his crucifixion to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. In the after noon the dean preached, and in the even ing the Rev. Dr. Stanton, Bishop* of 'New- castle, and the concluding portion of his remarks were devoted to the operations of the Church Society, which was, he said, one part of the machinery by which God worked for the supply of his ministrations to parishes where the inhabitants were not able to subscribe sufficient to supply their needs. The cathedral was well filled at each service, and the collections of the day realised a little over .Â£20.
