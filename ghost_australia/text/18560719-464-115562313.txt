[To the Editor of the Freeman's Journal.) ism, — 1 beg to draw your attention to the fol lowing passage, extracted from (he service of the Ordination of Priests in tho Church of JSngland: ? 'The Bishops with the Priests present laying their hands severally upon tho heud of every one thatrcceivelh tho Order of Priesthood— the Bishop saying,—' Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work, of - Priest; in tho Church of God, no\r committed unto theo by Iho Iinpcrsitiou of our hands. Whose sins thou dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins thou dost retain, they are retained, §c, §-c,' I do not nsk this information from any impudent curiosity, but' merely to bo informed through your columns, whether thepowors vested in tho ordaining of Priests' in the Churchos of England and Rome are in way similar. It appears to me from reading tho seryico (Ordaining of Priests), that Priests in the Church of England hnvo by tho authority ? of the Bishops power to forgive and retain the sins of the flocks committed to their charges. With your usual courtesy I have no doubt you will afford this information to Your most obedient sppvnnt:. A Member of tile Chithoii of England. Sydnoy, July 14th, 18,56. [There is no essential ..'.difference between tho form used in tho Catholic and Protestant Churches. The JPdntiJicale .Romanuvi gives tho following rubric on the subject -.—Ponlifex cum milra sedens super.faldistorium, ant? medium, altaris imponit amlas manus super capita singulorum coram co geniijlecteniium, dicens cuilibet : — ' Accipo spiri tuin sanctum: quorum remisoris peccata, remit tuntur eis: ct quorum, rctinueris, retenta stint.'
