Gibbs, Bright and Co., the managing agents of tho important steamship companies of the E. and A. Co.'fi China-Australian fleet and the Angip- Australasian lleot of London- Australian steamships, havo succeeded in rendering the Australian business perfeot. Tho annual excursion from Australasian ports to China, Japan, and British North Borneo is now coin ing to be reoogaised among tho "grand tours " of the world. Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Co" have, howovor, entered on a muon more am" bitious effort, and one which lias nuvurhitherto been attempted by any commercial institution. This i nothing more or le«s than a yachting | voyage round the world in the magnificent ; steamship Port Caroline, the commodore's ship of tho Anglo- Australian fleet of Port liners. It is proposed that tho steamship, under the command of Captain Orr, Bhull leave Sydney about the last day of tho present month for China and Japan. From Kobe tho steamship will proceed to America, and thence proceed to London. The vessel is to return to Australian ports by way of the Capo of Good Hope, and is timed to ai rive in Sydney about tho middle of January. Already a number of hard-worked colonists who require coinploto immunity from business enres, with a | bracing sea voyage, havo bespoken berths in tho lino steamship for the through voyage, and it is anticipated that hor saloon accommodation will be fully occupied before she is ready to sail. Tho Port Caroline is a magnificent steel steamship of 5000 tons burden, with a speed of 14 knots. Her saloon is most handsomely and comfort ably, not to say luxuriously fitted, her second cabin being equally good. The vessel is justly termed tho yacht of a fleet of handsomo dipper barque-rigged steamships. Such an enterprising venture on tho part of Messrs. Gibbs, Bright am >. deserves to succeed. In Peril of .,eiu Lives.— The small coasting schooner Tommy lias had a most exciting passage to Melbourne. She left Pen guin on June 30, and had only been at Bea a few hours when sho met with a terrific gale from west, with a high sea. The master ran the sohooner for Circular Head, where she re mained under the lee of tho land until July 3. At 10 a.m. sail was set, aiid with a frosb S. W. wind oleared tho land. At 6 a.m. on July 4, when off Hummook Islands, the wind veered round to N.E., and increased to a heavy gale. The vossel was put under close-reefed sails, ana a course steered for tho Otway. That headland was in sight at 12.15 ?.m. on the following day, when the ship was put about. The wind kept shifting from N.E. to E., and fierce squalls made the steering of the schooner difficult and dangerous. At 2 p.m. on July 5 a heavy squall almost lifted the vessel out of the water and threw her on her beam ends. . The waves broke right over her, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the men kept themselves from being swept away. All hands climbed on to the vessel's broadside, and after a lot of labor managed to out away the fore staysail, boom foresail ropes and the halliards of the mainsail. Although relieved of the weight of the canvas the vessel remnined in tho same position, with the lco side of the hatch in tho water. Tho master gave the mato an axe, and he com menced to cut away the foremast. He had two of the stays cut when the vessel suddenly righted. She was then hove to under close reefed mainsail, while the men cleared away the wreokage. The gale moderated on July ?, when it was found that all the fresh water had been lo3t, and a course was steered for Circular Head. The Samaria from New York.-t-TIki Ame rican ship Samaria arrived in harburthis morn ing after a passage of 114 days from New York. Sne brings a large general cargo, which is de tailed under the import heading. Tho vessel is consigned to Messrs. R. Towns and Co. Nkw'Gulf Linehs for the Australian Trade.— Messrs. Caird and Co. launched the steamship Gulf of Bothina for the Gulf line's Australian trade from their yards at Greenock on May 14. This firm has also received an order to build the Gulf of Toronto, to have a carrying capacity of 5000 tons. The Gulf of Genova was launched tome months ago, and the Gulf of Siam is now on tho stocks. Those vessels are all intended for the extension of the Australian trade from Liverpool and Glasgow. The dimensions of the steamships are : — Length, 350ft.; beam, 42ft.; depth, 29ft. 3in. Their engines are of triple ex| a isior, 2( 00 in dicated horse power. The ve.-sels are to have accommodation for 20 first-class and 50 Bteer- age passengers. The Rodney from London.— This fine clipper of Devitt and Moore's line is now Go days out from London to Sydney, and may be expected to reach the Heads by the end of the first week in August. As usual with these liners tho Rodney brings a full complement of passengers in her saloon. The names of these are : — Messrs. H. A. Black, I. J. Burbery, R. \V. Johnston, Mr. and Mrs. G. R. Iiogerson, Misses Funnell and maid, Strickland, Web ster, Messrs. T. A. Henery, J. Muraford, J. P. Powell, R. Rogers, Dr. Hareourt (surgeon). Messrs. Alfred Lamb and Co. are the managing agents of the Dovitt and Moore line in Syd- ney. The Howard Smith Liner Bunintono.— This steamship left Cooktown at noon on July 7, and oallod at Port Douglas, Cairifs, Towns- villo, Maekay and Rockhampton, arriving at Brisbane at G.30 p.m. on July 12. She had light winds and line weather during the passage. She left Brisbane at 1.15 p.m. on Tuesday, passed Point Dangar at midnight, Soutli Soli tary Island nt 11.15 a.m. Wednesday, and ar rived in Sydney harbor at 11 o'clock yester day, having experienced fresh south-west win s and high south-east swell on the run down the ooast. The Buninyong leaves for Melbourne at 5 p.m. to-day. The Americans as Shipbuilders.— The order received by a shipbuilding company on the Hudson for four small vessels for the Venezuelan Government is gratifying (says the Maritime Register). The order is a small one. It calls for two steam vessels of 20 tons burden each and two of 30 tons burden eaoh, all to be used as revenue cruisers. The smaller boats will be G5ft. long and 12ft. beam, and the larger ones 75ft. long and 13ft. beam. So much lias been said about Americans ceasing to be shipbuilders that foreign buyers have naturally looked elsewhere for almost anything in the way_ of sail or steam craft. But now that American built war vessels are attracting the attention of tho world and that a few small_ boats for foreign waters are being built hero, it is probable that foreign buyers may again visit American shipyards before placing their orders for what vessels thoy may need. To our shipbuilders we can only say that there is a futuro for them if they will accept its conditions. Smart Work. — Tho Naval Armaments and Construction Co., at Barrow, have just com pleted the plating of the 3G00-ton steamship Indianopolis, the work being performed in 13 days. Vessels are built by steam nowadays with a vengeance. Additions to the P. and O. Fleet. — Reference was made in Tuesday's Star to the additions to be math- by Caird and Co., in a very brief time, to the P. and O. fleet, consist ing of the magnificent /009-ton Australian liners Himalaya and Australia, and two 3000-ton steamships for tho Indian and China trade. By the latest mail comes word that tho Naval Armamonts and Construction Co., of Barrow-in-Furness, has boojcod additional orders for twoGOOO-ton steamships. Either thoro ia somo mistake, or tho reputation which the late Mr. Bryce Doug las made. for the firm has induced the P. and O. Co. to test the abilities of the builders of the famous Empresses of tho Canadian Pacific Railway Co.'s fleet. Messrs. T. Richardson and Sons, of the Hartlepools, have secured an important contract from the P. and O Co., it is srated, for the supply of engines and boilers for a largo vessel of tho fleet, which is to be specially fitted for tho conveyance of troops, the steamer to have a speed of 13 knots. G. W. Nicoll's Tweed.— This steamer, whioh is gaining the record of tho old Cunardians on a Bmall scalo — "never lost a boat or a man "—crossed the Tweed bar at 1.30 p.m. on Monday, and left Byron Ray at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, reaching Sydney G o'clock last evening. Shu experienced light southerly winds to Port Stephens ; thence to arrival S.S.W. winds and confused high sea. Scottish Boys for the Navy.— Tho old wooden line of battle-ship Impregnable, which latterly did duty as a training ship at Devon- pert under tho name of the Kent, has been transferred to the River Forth, near Quooiib- forry, for the training of Scottish boys for tho Imperial Navy. Sho was for some timoon tho " for sale list " ; but no buyers being forth coming, the Scots arc to have the benefit of hor remaining days. The Oroya. — Tho Orient Co.'s B.M.S. Oroya, from Sydney, June 22, arrived at Colombo on Wednesday. The Trial Bay Fleet Afloat Again.— Captain Jaines Banks, marine surveyor, is to be complimented on the succosb which has attended his efforts in connection with tho floating of the fleet of coasters which was re cently wrecked at Trial Bay. Three of tho stranded vessels were floated by Captain Banks during tho week, and as the Btorm-hatfyred Soii Nymph was launched into deep water last night the ringing cheers of the workmen testi fied that the veteran Sydney captain hitd eon- eluded his work. Tim Boomerang.— TheN.S.S. Co.'s steambr Boomerang left Newcastle at 8.35 last night, berthing at tho Sydney Wharf at G.35 tins morning. She experienced fresh S.W. winds, slight head sen, and showery weather on tho passage. Her cargo comprises 2 horses, 20 calves, 50 bis hay, b csks wine, 150 sks coke, 50 sks oats, 120 bgs bones, 50 sks potatoes, 30 bgs rags, 100 loose pumpkins, 20 plcgs harness, 2 tns castings, 50 hide's, 10 os wino, 10 bis skins, 2 Ids furniture, empties, aud 34 pkgs various goods. The Marifosa at Auckland.— The R.M.S Marifiosa, with the inward English and I American mails from San Francisco, viaHono- | lulu, arrived at 9.5 thi- morning, and is ex pected to get away about noon for Sydney, tho BtcamBhip being duo liero on Tuesday after noon. . New Caledonian Coastal Trade. — Tho coastal trado of tho French colony of New Caledonia is expanding at a rate which pro mises to give the group inter- island communi cation equal to the services maintained between Sydney and Noumea by the A.U.S.N. Co. and the M.M. Co. It was only tho othor day that tho line old steamer Hero, of New Zealand trading renown, was sent down to onter on tho constnl service. Several sailing vessels havo also jrana from British to French owners tho sales being effected oy Messrs. Ghost and Jowett, shipping agents of Sydney. To-day another fine Australian steamer was added to tho Now Caledonian steam fleet, through the same firm, who concluded the charter of tho Adelaide S.S. Co.'s steamer Otway to A. JouveundCo. Thosteainer is tobecmployed in the passenger and cargo trado between Noumea and tho other islands of tho New Caledonian group. She is now on her way to Wallaroo to load a cargo of flour for Noumea, for which port sho is to sail on Wednesday next. The Otway is a rather handsome iron screw schooner-rigged steamer of 5G3 tons, built in 1872 for tho Victorian coastal trade, in which she did good service boforo going under the flag of the Adelaide Co. Berthings and Removals. — Tho clipper Cutty Sark, from London, has berthed at the Tasmanian Co.'s wharf, and the steamship Hawkcs Bay at Circular Quay. The Bteamer Henley has gone to Cockatoo for cleaning and painting. The 4-mnsted schooner Tacoro, from Antwerp, will probably berth at Smith's wliarf to-morrow.
