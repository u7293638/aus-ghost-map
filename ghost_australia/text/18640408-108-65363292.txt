A Gtosr STOUr.-A Kilmarnock shopkeeper has earned for himself the souhriqset of "The Ghost."' One day last wekl, the shopkeeper irititiated.l to his shopbor that he was to Ibe from hoinme the next day, and he (the Ins) would require to attend the shop. Instead of leaving town, he got himtnself safely en. sconoed in a huge cask in the back shop in which holes had been cut to enable the occupant to see all that was going on in the front, his object being to watch the movements of the unsuspecting lad, of whosa conduct he appears to have le comne jealous of late. All, however, passed off well-the lad remiined true to his post, and did not attempt to go into the sanctum sanctorum of his master (shera, it is said, he had been forbiddlon to co) -till forced to do so by stern necessite in the shape ot a customer. On his. trance, what was his surprise to sce. pair of eyes glaring on him a oforesaid holes. A cyo 't n-r~~~ tt nm, au( i to a race tie was in the street telling his stiry. On returning however, his visions were dis pellediby his finding the evyes to belong to his master, who was there in propria persona. The story got wind, - and, however desirable that the matter. shouldl rest, that instiable monster, the public seems determined it shall not, and the cognomen of " The Ghost'" hals been be stoived on the unhappy cause of the ex citemnent. Every evening crowds con gregate aronud the premises, watching the slhopkeeper's exit, and then follow him home crying "The Ghost, the Ghost 1"
