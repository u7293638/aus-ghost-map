DESTRUCTION OF HER MAJESTY'S THEATRE BY FIRE. Another metropolitan theatre, on Friday night, December 6th, succumbed to that fate to which all theatres are sooner or later doomed destruction by fire At about fifteen minutes to 11 o'clock the passengers in thoHij market, Pall mall, and Regent-street were startled by an immense body of flames darting out from the roof of her Majesty's Theatre, and it at once became apparent that the theatre was on fire The alarm spread in a moment in all directions, and a rush was made for the stage-door in the Haymarket, when it was found that the hall-keeper was in entire ignorance of any thing of an unusual occurrence having taken place in less than ten minutes from the flames being first discovered the whole body of the theatre was one mass of fire, the roof being in flames from end to end The wind was blowing strong from the northeast, and the immense body of fire poured forth from the burning theatre like a volcano, emitting a thick shower of fiery flukes that completely covered the roadways and pavements of the adjacent streets. It was past 11 o'clock before any of the engines arrived at the scene, after which they arm id in quick succession, but the extent of the fire, and the the fire being surrounded with houses on every side, rendered it matter of difficulty for the firemen to decide at what point to begin operations By this time the flames had taken pus session of the houses on each side of the Opera Arcade, md the houses in Pall-mall, opposite the United Service Club, and at these points the firemen, mounting the colonnade in front of the houses, begun to pour great bodies of water on to the fire, but for some time, owing to the strength of the wind, with little apparent effect. At this time, hill past 11, the scene was impressively grand, trio great height of the theatre causing the flames to be v sible it a long distance, and by their light masses of people could be plainly seen, completely blocking up the whole of the approaches to the theatre, while every window, house tip, and available space was also filled with spectators The whole of the south end of the theatre and arcade was > in a heap of burning ruins, and the efforts of the firemen were directed to save, if possible, the houses in Pall-mall, behind which the theatre s el, and the back portions of which were already in fine These houses were built on a to go scale, and a re occupied by Messrs Ludlow, hatter s, Boucher, to see- a nist, Brooks, wine merchant, Egg, gunmakers, in 1 Graves, the eminent bootseller and engraver at 11 s establishment the extensive suite of rooms was filled with valuable paintings, many of them full-length p high, deposited for safety with the proprietor V body of the i searches to work to remove these paintings, and the majority of them were taken in safety to the United Sea so Club By His time (4 o'clock) the fire in the smiling son of the theatre had burnt itself out, and the firemen were enabled to direct the whole of their efforts to the li was in Pall-mall, and by this means the further spread of the fire in that direction was prevented Sion or one o'clock the wind moderated, and an alum i is given that the flames had taken hold of the northern portion of the theatre, in which are situated the store-rooms and other offices This was found to be the case, and a body of firemen were at once detached to that part of the premises Before, however, they could bring the hose into play, the place was one body of fire, and the II lines had caught the back part of the Grand United Hotel, at the corner of St Alban's street and the Ilnyiiiiuket After half-an-hour's unremitting exertion The flames were stopped in this direction also, but this part of the theatre was also destroyed, and nothing was now left standing of the building but the bare walls and the colonnade in the Haymarket, which was made use of by the firemen to play the hose on the burning mass A most distressing scene took place in the Opera arcade, running at the back of the theatre the occupants of shops and houses in the Arcade had succeeded in getting their goods and furniture out into the Viendo, but such was the intense heat and the rapidity of the fire, that they were obliged to leave them there and make their own escape, and in a very short time the whole length of the Arcade was one mass of fire, every particle of the goods and furniture being destroyed Such was the concourse of people assembled that the police available were utterly unable to keep back the crowds, and at 12 o'clock several strong detachments of Foot Guards were marched down from the barracks in the Birdcage wolk, and with fixed bayonets formed a most effective cordon round the burning pile Fortunately there was no performance in the theatre last night, or there must have been a great sacrifice of life, the audience portion of the theatre being in flames within ten minutes of the fire being discovered No certain information could be obtained as to how the fire originated,, but it is thought to have arisen in the carpenters' workshops Nothing whatever was saved from the theatre, the costly wardrobes, the valuable music, and the orchestral instruments, were all destroyed, and the amount of loss must be very great By 2 o'clock the fire was got completely under, and all apprehension of its spreading any further was at an end In the confusion and excitement which prevailed it was impossible to ascertain any details, or the amount of damage done to the surrounding buildings Several of the engines were worked by a detachment of Life Guards from Albany Barracks It appears that all the costly properties, including the wardrobes of the establishment, have perished with the instruments of the orchestra, the grand pianos, and a musical library of incalculable value, which had taken years to collect Aldme Huons alone has lost jewellery worth from £1000 to £1200, in addition to all her magnificent stage dresses The grand organ, which cost nearly £800, and all the stage scenery and decorations, painted for the most port by Belbin, Grieve, and Calcott, have been destroyed The only thing which has survived the general wreck is the dress which the ghost in "Don Giovanni" was wont to be played The actual and prospective loss to Mr Mapleson, the lessee, is estimated at £12,000, and the disaster, as it affects him, is greatly aggravated by the fact of his not having been insured to the amount of a single shilling, He was about to effect an insurance, 'but it had not been completed The large duty chargeable upon theatrical properties is understood to have previously deterred line In the course of Saturday morning her Majesty, through the Lord Chamberlain, sent a message to him expressly of of her sympathy and regret, and a telegram from Sandringham, in similar terms, accompanied by an expression of hope that no lives had been lost on the occasion, was received from the Prince of Wales Among the owners of property adjoining the theatre the greatest sufferer is said to be Mr Graves, the engraver and passenger, in Pall Mall Behind his front shop were four spacious picture galleries on the ground floor, communicating with one another, and lighted chie ly from the roof These were stored with a rare collection of ancient and modern works of art, collected during a period of forty years, the greater part of which, along with the galleries containing them, have been cut ely destroyed the place was full of ancient and modern pictures, Italian engravings, statuettes, water coloured drawings, and prints Among those which have perished are Roberts's fine picture of the " Temple of the Sun," Carnek's " Home and its Treasures, Long's picture of the "Matmakers," Miss Osborne's " Returning from Market," Gow's "Just Awake," Hayllrrs "Just Caught, and many more. All his pictures by Morlane!, Crowe, Muller, Vincent, Sidney Cooper, and his collection of portraits of eminent men have likewise been burnt But, happily, his steel plates, worth £20,000 to £30,000, which were kept in iron safes, have been preserved, as have also several pictures by Morland which had been left to be engraved, and all the books, subscription lists, and his bills of exchange, Happily, also, Mr Graves is insured in various offices to the amount in all of about £30,000, and, owing to the preservation of his collection of steel plates, he will be enabled to carry on his business The London correspondent of the North Janusz Mail says : " It is questionable if Earl Dudley, to whom the Opera House in the Haymarket belonged, will seriously regret the destruction of the building last night. It seems that the property has been a source of concern, if not of absolute annoyance, to the noble lord for many years past The rent was far below the value of the building (looking upon the large amount invested in it), and it is well known that it has not at all times been punctually paid Indeed, in former years the noble owner had to make heavy pecuniary sacrifices to prevent the doors being closed, as the club house in Covent Garden had attracted many of the patrons of the engine house, and had thus divided profits which formerly flowed into one treasury only Under these circumstances, it is quite possible that Lord Dudley may make some other disposition of the site, and decline to grant a new lease for the purpose of erecting another Opera house, which might prove as pool a speculation as that destroyed Her Majesty's Theatre was built during 1790, the first stone having been laid on the 3rd of April in that year by the Right Hon.
