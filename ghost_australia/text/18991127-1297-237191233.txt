THE AUTOMOBILE. It doesn't shy at papers As they blow along tho street. It cuts no. silly capers On the dashboard with Its feet; It doesn't paw the sod up all around the hitching post, - It doesn't scare at shadows as a man would at a ghost;' It doesn't gnaw the manger, It doesn't waste the hay. Nor put you into danger When tho brass hands play. It makes no wild endeavor To switch away the files; It sheds no hair that ever Gets In your mouth and eyes; It speeds along the highways and never looks around For things that It may scare at and spill you on the ground! It doesn't mind tho circus, It's not at all afraid; And It doesn't overwork us When tlio elephants parade. It doesn't rear and quiver When the train goes rushing by; It doesn't stand and shiver When tho little snowflakes fly; It doesn't mind the thunder nor the lightning's blinding flash; It doesn't keep you, chirping and connecting with the lash; It never minds the banners Thoy display on holidays. It's a thing with proper manners, Which It shows In many ways. When you clianco to pass Its stable You do not havo to caro Or cluck for all you're able To keep from stopping there! It will 'work nil through the daytime and still bo frosh at night; v ; - Thore Is no one to arrest you If you do not treat It right! It's wheezlngs ne'er distress you As it moves along tho way — Farewell, old Dobbins; bless, you! You woro all right In your day. —Chicago "Times-Herald."
