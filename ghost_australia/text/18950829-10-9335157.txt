Part VI. of this Art Series is now ready for distribution, and if it is possible to make comparison where all things are perfection, this particular number excels those preced- ing it in the special presentment of charming views of interiors, There is likely to be a run for this particular issue of the series, and those who book orders early will ensure freedom from disappointment.
