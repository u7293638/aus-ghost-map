TALE: ? The Ghost Dead-Bell; It ifl now many years since I was quartered Withhiy regiment in Vienna. Amon£ the acquaintances which I formed there was a young nobleman who was in the Imperial Baron Von Stemgraff. He was the etifc descendant of an ancient Syrian family tSi&t; had lived for centuries in a oastle 'near Salzburg. Afiner-hearted fellow could not be found iirhis Imperial Majesty'B dominions, nor a] better soldier in the army than Friedrich. Frank and ^ay as a companion, he was a ffcvourite with his own sex, and a good figure, to Bay nothing of a good property, made him ribfr unacceptable with old mammas and young daughters. Friedrich, however, seemed to be no marrying man, though he h&d; 'Nothing miBOgynistio in his nature. Wh<&.bhr friendship had grown into close intimacy ! happened to banter him on !th:e' of inatrinlOtiy, but friedrich as *that h$ had resolved nev&fc; o^SF^kia'he/'^^thatT nation to .the imt^iijibijial State,' 'jrat1 Fate, cruel'iftd ii&xoi;&ble;, ha^ forbidden ine to enterinto it*'r " v i l^etdred atWriiin silent surpriae. ..After a moment he tbld' in'e hbw, whenachild, he fe&l;'tiiiet aZifegaimernm, or gipsy jeototon, fraffl;!Bohemia, as huerossed & 'wood hear th& Sohlobfe. She Wd stopped him, looked ihto his hand and said .. '-Young Herr, when yougo to marry a wife, heed. The way to God's Altar lies through God's acre!' . i: '.Well !' cried I, laughing, (that waBa] safe prophecy. A man cannot well get to | tfy) ohurch door unless he walks through the churchyard.' _ j Friearich shook his head. ' That was not hermeaning,' said he, 'but rather tiiatl must die on the bridal day. Therefore, dear friend, I shall never marry. You may think me su perstitious and a fool, but there have been stranger things known to our family!' He Havered and turned pale, but justas I would have questioned him: he laid his hand on my shoulder and added, ' And now, Haupttuaim, et us never speak of this again 1' . A year passed by and I was far away in the north of Germany, when I got a letter from j Von Steingraff. It announced his coming marriage with a young lady of his own coun try. ' My destiny,' he wrote, whatever it may be, I must work out. I could not resist my passion for my little Hoesohen. Sjb come to. tae as soon as you can, and who knows but yoiir happier interpretation of the gipsy's prophecy may be the true one ?' I laughed heartily as I closed the letter. The old story! Woman's tongue had over come man's resolve-pretty Roesohen had *ibi£$j6d the withered gipsy from the field! and so Baying, I packed for my journey and taBftow found ine en route. At the close of a lovely autumn day I drove * along the road"between Salzburg and St. Gilgea where it skirts the picturesque little litite-df Mondaoe, so snugly embosomed in S-ecipitous hillsclothed with pine and larch, op tar from .this stood the sbhloss of my m&d;, built elbse to the ruins of a suppressed monastery, and sheltered by the dark forest pnwhoge tree-tops the evening sun glinted Sanely'. Hither I worked my way-but slowly-fot the approach was steep and cir tfoiiouk, and by the time 1 reached the en trance^nd stood under the heavy arches of ihe doorway the sun had set ana the great stone massofbuildfrig was lying in gioom. .TIub gavemea strange unpleasant feeling, which increased as I~8tood Imockin^ forma^ny minutes at the heavy open ported without re sponse, from within.

Well, sir, a long tiine ago-I don't know how many hundred years -the Baron Steingraff of that day who lived then in the old Schloss higher up in the hills above the Krotensae^-had a quarrel- withthe abbot. The baron was a fieroe and haughty man that pared; .little- jfor ohurth and ! priest, and tflki ifebot' VC^ais haughty in his i way, so the feudjgrew deadlier every day. At last the abbot swore on the holy xelios of Saint Wolfgang that he wOuld excommutiicate the baron. And tbe baron swore by the cross upon his sword hilt that he wouldtpar the frock off the abbot's back and drive him and his monks ont of the monastery. The abbot j wasas good as his word, and so, on the feast of ; the blessed Saint Wolfgang, he and till his J monks Walked in ? procession through the \ church up to the high, altar, and the ^reat book was opened and: the anathemas read, and then the bell was tolled and the lighted candles extinguished and thus the baron was excommunicated. 'Well! The bell was still tolling and'the priests were on their way back down the aisle when the shouts of the baron and his wild men-at-arms, his jagers and holvkneojhte r&ng; at the walls and sledges and great pine beams were battering at the gates.. ; > ' Short work theyinade of it!

A coin cidence-a sad ooincidenoe-that was all! And my grief had surely unsettled my mind. I pioked up a book from one of the shelves and tried to read. The words swam on the page. Not a sound was to be heard save the ticking of the great dock in the hall. I laid down the book and sighed. Just then the clock tolled the midnight hour. The deep bell stfuok twelve times loud and clear, and mechanically I counted every sfcrpke. Midnight! A Budden thought-the crisis. Then ihy poor Friedrich might, even now, be passing the portal of Eternity 1 1 was about to speak to Klaus when I discovered that he slept, exhausted, on the hearth. * Poor faithful eoul!' thought I. 'Best there awhile-ycu may awake tothe deepest grief.'. For I realized that he, like myself like RoeBchen-must lose, .with Friedrich, that which he best loved on 6arth. So I rose noiselessly, and passed sadly and alone into the great stone halt. A breath of cold air swept my cheek.
