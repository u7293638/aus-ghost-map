STRAY NOTES. (BY J. GRASSIE,) THE SPECTRE OF LAURIE PARK. Hark to the spectre of Laurie Park! How it mutters, and stutters, and whines in the dark; Wild as the howl of the dingo it screams, And the bushman screams in his midnight dreams, And bars his door with a sheet of bark, Afraid of the spectre of Laurie Park. That ghost is the ghost of Emir, and dwells In yonder swamp in the bright blue bells; But when all around is silent and dark It wanders howling in Laurie Park. It has lights to lure the traveller lone To a dismal doom at the Ruben Stone; But when owlets scream and wild dogs bark It hides in the tea-tree Laurie Park. Shepherd and herdsman shun this plain - Better be drowned in the raging main Than wander here, amongst swamp oaks dark, To meet the spectre of Laurie Park. *I got bothered coming through Laurie Park the other night, and in the dark thought I saw a horrid spectre, and what do you think it was ? It was a confounded Afghan hawker With a banket of paltries on his head.
