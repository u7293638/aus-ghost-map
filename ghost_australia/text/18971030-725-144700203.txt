For several years our volunteers have had no opportunity for continuous and combined training and in the opinion o~ Colonel Waddell the r 'lect is making the force ' simply a unformed rabble.' The death of Mr Joseph Mitchell eje M.L.A., promotor of the steel rail in dustry, is a pathetic circr nstance. His ambition for many years was the establishment of the iron industry in this colony and on the very eve of the accomplishment of his grand project fell cancer carried him off. Mr Mit chell was a splendid type of colonist and his death is a distinct loss to the country. His good work will, how- ! ever, live after him. ,
