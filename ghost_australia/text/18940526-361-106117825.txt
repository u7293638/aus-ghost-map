SALV ATION R~RjY. Grotesque, but hopeful ; absurd, but a blessing to the race of man, narrow iu oreed, but admiiaIle in deed, an angel of good cheer in Harlequin's clothing, a messenger of peace, with a brass drum for an irchestra, uplitting fallen men, while the ghost of murdered music flees at its approach ; ridliculously divino ; preposterously glorious - this is tho BalVation Army. After the manner of a clown it goes ioto the purlieus, and the blessing of those who have suffered follows it as it departs. In this city; on Christmaseely, it fed more than 3,500 homeless poor; and gave over 1000 well- filled baskets to the hungry. And this is the sortof work that it constantly does. The Salvation Army justifies its existence daily-red shirts, tin badges, bass drums and all. If you don't believe It, ask BanFracisco's pour.-" News Letter."
