S. it.— It was rwuired to fi»d the present value of a Government bond for £100, having 32 years to run, and bearing interest at £5 per cent., and the rate of interest actually paid ; the 6 per cent, bonds, having 38 years to run, realizing £114 lla. R. S. K., who appears to have made the subject his special study, gives £98. Is. 6$d. as the value of the bond, and £5 2s. 5£d. per cent, as the rate of interest actually paid. The only other answers received that are even approximately correct are those of J. C. Hansen and J, W. H. Hullett; We cannot find space for the elaborate details furnished by them, but as the problem involves a great deal of labour, and is at the same time of --so much] importance in its bearing upon the value of Government bonds, i we have much pleasure in furnishing the subjoined general formula, kindly furnished by Mr. J. C. Hansen. A similar problem was submitted to the Actuaries of Melbourne by the Vic torian Government a year or two ago, and its solution appears to have given them a good deal of trouble. Mr. Hansen says: — Three different payments will come under our consideration — 1st, the sum A paid by the buyer in cash for his bond; 2nd, the amount of the annual payments of pre miums (£ a per year) for n years; and, 3rd, the final payment of £100 per bond after the lapse of n veara. In reducing these three Bums to their present cash value we will re present the unknown rate of interest by p percent. Then . ( Present value of \ ( Present value of \ -annualpaymentsA.+- £100 payable -=«-i I of £a each ) { after ayears r J That is— '- '. ! lool : ??'#.: loo \n) ' '?:...' P [ \lQO + p } j From this formula the value of pis to be deduced, and, if known, it may easily be applied for. finding the present value of other bonds. With regard to the prerent problem, aa A = 114-55, a = £6, n = 38 years, we obtain p = 5*123 per cent. And for the second question, assuming a =£5, n=32 years, but A unknown, the same formula gives, as p = 5*123. A = £98-085= £98 Is. 8id.' Mr. Hullett, by an indepen dent process of his own, deduces the present value of the bond at £96 7s., and the rate of interest at £5 2s. 5£d. per cent, as above. NOTES AND CORRESPONDENCE.
