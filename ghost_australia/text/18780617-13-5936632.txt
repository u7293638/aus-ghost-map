RELIGIOUS EDUCATION OF THE YOUNG. The following circular has been addressed by the Bishop of Melbourne to the clergy of his diocese - Bishopscourt, Melbourne, May 31,1S78 My Reverend Brother recently asked, as you are aware, for information in connexion with the religious education of the children of our people The information supplied to me was not always of that definite character which I could have desired, but yet it shun a clearly, I regret to say, that the religious education of our children is in the most unsatisfactory condition I fully record nise the immense difficulties with which you have to contend Oniiigfo the banishment of religious instruction from the state schools, you are obliged, I know, either to abandon vi eek day instruction altogether, or to ask the children to attend to it when they are w caned by work, or drawn aside by the attractions, of their weekly holiday But however serious these difficulties maybe, I would strongly urge you to endeavour to over come them, and rather to be contented with the smallest measure of success than refer quish the effort to which we so recently committed ourselves I fear that very few of us have an adequate conception either of the spiritual destitution of the rising gener- it on in this colony, or of the probable effect of this state of things I do not believe that the majority of those who banished religious instruction from our state schools had any objection either to the Bible as a text-book, or to such undenomi- national instruction in divine knowledge as is now given in the board schools of London They banished religious instruction because they thought it impossible to keep the peace between rival sects and denominations I believe that the experience of the mother country shows them to have been mistaken But however that maybe of the result of their action there can be no doubt or question In order to banish all reference to God from the scholars mind and the t> scheme lesson, they have been compelled to exclude not only the Bible, but also those v voices of conscience and lessons of history which speak so plainly of a divine presence and providence in the world. The glory of heaven is carefully shut off from the page of knowledge, everything must be seen under the hard dry light of its sea ular aspect Should imagination attempt to escape from these low levels, it is to be suppressed Should emotion at times betray the susceptible nature into religious aspirations, these must be summarily checked to secure peace, we must imprison conscience, and et elude heaven I do not believe for one moment that the great mass of our people desire such a result They wish their children to read the Bible, and learn ltB holy lessons They believe that character can only be formed through moral and religious instruction, and that as a text book for such instruction there is no book comparable to the sacred volume But still the effect of our state education is exactly what I have described it, and would solemnly urge you, my reverend brother, to endeavour to set clearly and v h ally before by ourow n mind what must be the present moral condition, and probable moral future, of those who have no larger education than that given in our state schools Let us ask ourselves how we should have fared, if God, and all the religious sanctions of action, had been carefully kept out of our mind We know what our life has been, with Christian light to guide it and Christian grace to support it Can we hope, then, that we should have been kept from gross wickedness without such aid is that is till no better motive than interest, no worthier deterrent than fear, we could have escaped so far as by God's mercy we have done from the ignoble slavery of a sensual selfishness? What can be the effect, my reverend brother, of a merely godless education like this, but, in commerce, feverish speculation and systematic knavery, in politics, selfish ambition, cruel animosity, and unscrupulous oppression in social life, impurity, effeminacy, idleness, and inconstancy ' I cannot point the picture so darkly as it appears to my own mind, and it is because I earnestly long for the peace and prosperity of this fair land of my adoption, and for the extension to all its people of the infinite blessings of our Divine Redeemer's kingdom, that I am making this attempt to show you the urgent need of present effort as I myself perceive it. Since the State thinks it cannot, we must bestow a religious education upon our children We are bound to do this (not only to make the effort, but to go on making it till we succeed) by every obligation which we hold most sacred by loyalty to our Divine Master, by faithfulness to our ordination vows, by love of those souls over whom the Holy Ghost has made us overseers, and, not less, by patriotic attachment to the country which feeds and shelters us Won ustre- solve to succeed It were better to lose anything than the hearts of our children If one method should fail, we mystery another Alo must summon our people round us, we must ask them to join us in prayer to our heavy only rather that He may teach us the right way, and give us strength and grace to walk therein Vainly will our successors preach to souls hardened in habits of god- less thought and feeling if, while these souls are tender responsive o to the glow of erno tion, and plastic beneath the formative hand of love and truth we neglect to set before them the blessed gospel of salvation I would therefore earnestly and affectionately urge you, my reverend brother, to renewed efforts in this direction Lay the matter before your people remind them of the uttermost ciency of Sunday school instruction alone, or the necessity that there should be some kind of balance and proportion between sacred and if ocular education, even in the case of those who attend Sunday- schools, as well as some kind of week day provision for those who do not Remind them, more or, that a Christian man is not his own, but that bought with the precious blood of. Christ, he is bound to glorify God with his time, his talent, his strength, and his life that every spiritual life is bestowed, not that it may be enjoyed merely, but rather that it may be imparted to those who are less happy and instructed than ourselves Thus, by God's help, instead or merely folding our hands and waiting for the deluge, we shall be doing what in us lies to benefit men and glorify God I am, Your faithful Brother in Christ, J.
