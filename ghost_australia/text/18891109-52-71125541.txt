Garden Memories. Ã€ pardon old stretches down toward the sea ; The flowers untended, the wild thorns growing j The sun burns hot ; and the wind from the lea Now aud again is restlessly blowing; Trying to wake in this land of death Some song of the past ; a scentless breath, Of laughing roses, and lips so fair, And Bunbeams playing 'mid golden hair. The oleanders lie wither'd and broken.; From the thicket hard by comes no thrushes' song. Would a ghost not rise if a word be spoken,, Or a. step resound tho dark alleys along ? A ghostly.hand-full of fair wither'd flowers, Scattering its burden pale in showers, Like sea-foam driviner upon the wave, , To cover a long-forgotten grave. The sim, and the wind,- and the rain come thither To the garden old that stands by the sea ; The flowers dream, and blossom, and wither ; And the wild hawk hovers over the lea. But a fair head sleeps in tho bosom of death ; The red lips will never again draw breath. All are at rest now ; naught left to show The love and, the sorrow of loDg ago. .,
