HE WAS HAUNTED. When he first arrived in Sydney he was "taken up" by a friend who originally came from the same part of England. The latter took him to a boarding-house at Middle-street, Chippendale, kept by a highly respectable widow. The friend found employment for "Williams" at Tooth's Brewery; but this position he did not hold long, as he quarrelled with his superior. He afterward opened up a little business in Castlereagh-street, which abruptly ended with his arrest for theft, and a sentence of six months' imprisonment followed. While residing with the widow he was always talking of his "dear wife, Marion," who he said was in England, and for whose companionship he longed. This lady arrived in Sydney while "Williams" was in prison. He was accustomed to sleep with Marion's photo- graph beneath his pillow. He was remarked for his consistency in attending St. Paul's Church. The widow was eventually obliged to get rid of "Williams" on account of his mysterious manner, and particularly for his whining complainings that "a ghost haunted his room at night time." On one occasion he rushed down stairs to his landlady and, in a state of real or acted terror, said that he was intercepted on the stairway by "the ghost." It afterwards came to light that "Williams," who incidentally let out that the second name he bore at that time — "Bailey" — was the name of his mother's people, stole clothing and other effects from the mate employed on the vessel that brought "Williams" here.
