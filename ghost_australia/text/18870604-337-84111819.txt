s still Considering. The story goes, 011 the authority of "IshmaeV* in the Ipswich Advocate, that Bishop Webber wrote to Jimmy Tyson, the squatting millionaire, com mending to his consideration the scheme for the es tablishment of an Anglican Cathedral in Brisbane. Tyson replied and forwarded Bishop Webber a cheque for £500. Then---but I had better let " Ishmael" tell the rest of the story, for fear that Dr. "Webber might try to " Evenden" me into a con tribution of .£3000 to the cathedral. Well, to quote ''Ishmael": " His Lordship was not quite satisfied with the figures on the cheque, and wrote fbajbk to the donor* stating in effect '-.hat while thanking him for the! £500 he would have been better pleased had the figures totted up to a comfortable <£2000 at least. What Mr. Tyson remarked when he received this letter, I cannot even surmise, but he . wrote a courte ous note in reply requesting the cheque to be re turned. Tbe Bishop complied with the request, supposing, no doubt, that Mr* Tyson would send another for a far larger amount. The millionaire, however, wrote thanking the Bishop for his prompt ness in returning the cheque, and stating that he would give his lordship's hint full consideration. Mr. Tyson,'I may remark, is still considering, and that is how matters stand at the present moment." " Si non e vero, e ben trovato" If it be true, then Oh! Jimmy Tyson, You sinful bison, You'll pay for these here games, Ould Nick will post Your hardened ghost To Webber-lasting flames. ^
