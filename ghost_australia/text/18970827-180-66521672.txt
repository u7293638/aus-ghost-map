IIakcocrt's Autograph. — Sir William flarcourt was once persuaded to write his name and a ' sentiment ' in an autograph book belonging to a little girl, the daughter of a friend of his.

Some time later a would-be wit obtained secret pos session of the volume and added the words ' of Colney Hatch r' Nest time the little lady met Sir William, she asked him anxiously, ' How are your friends, the people in Causey Hatch r' ' An Appalling Invention.' — The London Daily Chronicle says : — We have been favered with a picture of an appalling invention^ — literally ' made in Germany ' — having for its object the prevention «-f premature burial. The machine is-well calculated to add a new terror to the graveyard. It works aa the slightest movement in the buried coffin, so that a passing van, or still more, a moving train, may bv the oseillation it sets up cause the dread thing to work. And what happens is this : An iron bos springs open ; a black flag flies wildly up-right, a bell clangs, and the glare of an electric lamp light ens the countryside. We can con ceive nothing more trying to tlie nerves of the living than the con sciousness that these dread engines are scattered promiscuously over the churchyards of the land. We are not afraid of ghosts, but we frankly confess that we would not pass by a church at night if we thought that one of these terrors was nigh. Labor Church. — The weekly service of tbe Labor Church was held at the Upper OddfelUws'-hall on Sunday evening, when Mr. I.angridye gave a thoughtful lecture ou 'Idealism.' The lecturer said that idealism had its uses in both barbaric and civilised communities. In barbaric coun tries idealism made enthusiastic seldiers. In civilised communities it elevated the tastes and aspira tions of the people. It tended to make human beings generous. Tbe spirit of idealism was to give rather than to get. Christians bad their ideals, but in many cases did not attam them. Atheists and 'anti- christs also had their ideals, but they were not always tbe best, and in the case of the anarchists, while some of their ideals were of an emancipatory character, their methods were too violent, and generally defeated the object they had in view. The world would be changed and bettered by lofty aims and ideals. When social ideals were adopted by the mass of tbe people, then social progress would be the order of the day. Electoral Roll Claims. — The closing effort of the Trades and Labor Council to induce citizens to fill up application forms, to be plated upon the electoral roll, was made on Saturday evening last.
