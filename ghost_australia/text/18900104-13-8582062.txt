A NORWEGIAN NATURALIST IN AUSTRALIA Somewhat above the middle height, com partly built, with 6, clear complexion, fair hair, light blue eyes, a modest and almost deferential manner, and apparently under 30 years of age Such was the naturalist who introduced himself, about eight years ago, to the present writer as Carl Lumholtz, of Christiana, Norway, who was then about to proceed upon a scientific mission to the interior of Queensland He did not look like the sort of man whom nature had qualified for a life of hardships and privations in a tropical country, or who would take his life III his hand and trust himself for months together to the society of treacherous blacks in remote districts beyond the verge of pastoral settlement, and where, as he observes, he found the natives in their original condition, uninfluenced by intercourse with the white man.

Certainly Mr Lumholtz found what Mr Curr was accustomed to speak of us " the terrible rate just as prevalent in Queensland as it is else where among the natives of this continent Although the blacks are incorrigible thieves, those of Northern Australia com- prehend the idea of personal proper to, and entertain considerable respect for the right "If for instance, a native finds a hive of honey in a tree, but has not an immediate opportunity of chopping it out he can safely leave it to some other dut 1 he discoverer owns it, and nobody else will touch it if he has either given an account of it or marked the tree, as is the custom in some parts of Western Queensland It the] hunt, they will not take another persons came, all the members of the same tribe having apparently full confidence in each other 'J bus, the right of property is to a certain extent respected , but, least of all, when it concerns their dearest possession-the women But it is, of course, solely among members of the same tribe that there is so great a difference between mine and thine, strange tribes look upon each other as wild beasts " In his normal condition, the Australian 18 sound and health in spite of the exposure he undergoes, and the precariousness of his supplies of food Most of the maladies from which he suffers are represented as having been acquired by contact with Europeans, and also by the clothing he adopts when he endeavours to assimilate himself to them 'These result in rheumatic fevers and lung diseases. "I never found fever and ague among the Australian savages," writes Mr Lumholtz, " except in the solitary case of a well dressed civilised black on the Herbert River In that time the natives are unacquainted with my remedy for snakebite, "The victim simply lays himself down to the " It is but justice to them to add that the blacks " are very kind and sympathetic towards those who are ill, and they carry them from camp to camp This is the only noble trait, remarks Mr Lumholtz, "that I have discovered in the Australian natives Warfare in the chrome condition of the aboriginal tribes of the north in a state of nature, and their greatest incentive to taking life is their appetite for human IICBD 'J he blacks never wage war to conquer now territory A potent cause of intertribal bloodshed is the superstitious belief that an enemy is capable of taking away the life of his adversary by witchcraft.
