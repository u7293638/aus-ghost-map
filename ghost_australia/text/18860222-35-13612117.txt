The third representative steamer of the British India Steam Navigation Company in these waters, the Goa arrived on Satur- day afternoon from Calcutta via ports with passengers and cargo. In accordance with the usual custom the Goa was taken over to Spring Cove where she underwent the usual fumigation and there having been no sickness on board she was granted pratique at 9 o clock the same night and came up to an anchorage in Neutral Bay. The Goa is in many respects a counterpart of the Rajpootana and the Khandalla, her rig, passenger accommodation, &.c being exactly the same. Like these the was built by Messrs. William Denny and Co of Dum- barton and was launched in 1874. The hull is of iron, and mea- sures 297 8-10ths feet in length, 32 2-10ths in breadth and 25 7-10ths feet depth of hold and it is divided into six water-tight compartments by five bulkheads The engines, supplied by the buildrs are of the compound surface con- densing principle and are of 208 horse-power nominal, and they drive the ship ant a fair rate of speed on a moderate con sumption of coal. Cleanliness and brightness are conspicuous on board, and there is no doubt that the Goa is a very comfortable ship for travellers. It will be of interest to state that the Goa was the first steamer to reach Malta with Indian troops when there was a danger of war with Russia in 1880. Captain T W Lewins is in command, Mr Alfred Houghton is chief officer, and Mr D Gilmour has charge of the engine-room The Goa left Calcutta on January 11, Rangoon on the 17th, Penang on the 21st, Singapore on the 26th.

From Brisbane she had fine weather and head winds during the first part, and strong northerly winds during the latter part of the passage. The Goa's cargo for this port consisting principally of rice, castor oil, tea, linseed &c.;, will be discharged at the Central Wharf where she will be berthed to day One of the second-class passengers for Sydney (D Cain died from consumption while the vessel was in Moreton Bay on the 13th Instant and was buried in Mud Island there.
