NEW CHURCH AT UNKYA. Gladstone Circuit. We have for a long time wished to begin to build our church here, .but the difficulties attending the first settle ment of a new place like this have prevented us. Last Monday, when the Revs. G. A. Reeve and E. J. Curwood, with Mr. ^ W . Harvey from Kempsey, were passing through en route for the Synod at Grafton, was fixed for the laying of the foundation block, ? but Sunday and Monday proved very wet, and it seemed as if we would not be able to carry out our proposal, but just at the right time the rain cleared, and in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost Bro. Reeve declared the corner block duly laid. Our hearts were filled with praise and gratitude to God for the vic tories won in His strength during the past year, and because He has put it into the hearts of the people to build Him a house here. What courage we received ; what hope for the salvation of those of our neighbours who are yet out of Christ ; what rejoicing in the presence of our dear Lord as we Bang around that block. And while Mr. Reeve read to us from the book of Nehemiah of the rebuilding of Jerusalem notwithstanding the attempts of the enemy to hinder the work, and the ultimate rejoicing of God's own people we were encouraged, but it was when he earnestly pleaded with our Father for a greatblessing to rest upon our work, anda mightily continued outpouring of the Spirit upon our neighbourhood, that we realised the f ulness of joy, and taith, and trust in our loving God. Bro. Reeve photographed the scenei, and at night we had a grand meeting addressed by Revs. Reeve and Curwood and Bro. Harvey, who all with Bros. Cassie and W. D. O. Hodge went on to Grafton next morning. Subscriptions ranging from one penny (from a little boy) to a half- sovereign were laid upon the block, and the church will be opened free from debt.
