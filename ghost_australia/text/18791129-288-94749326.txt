PORT VICTOR, November 26. The weather has been of a very variable = nature lately, and it is now cold, rough, and wet. A good deal of rain has fallen to-day. On Friday, the 21st instant, the Ereakwater Amateur Christy Minstrels gave a performance- ' in the local hall in aid of the institute. There was a very large audience, and alto^etber the entertainment was much appreciated, although the performers were laboring under a difficulty Frnm the want of a rrianist. Some of the sins ing was very good, and several local hits by the corner men caused much fun. The enter tainment concluded with the farce of 'A Ghost in a Pawnshop,' which was the source of much amusement. The institute funds were benefited to a good extent by the entertain ment. — The anniversary sermons of theNewland Memorial Church were preached on Sunday by the Rev. Osric Copland, of North Adelaide, to large congregations. On Tuesday a tea w« held in the institute hall, and was largely at- - tended. In th© evening the Key. O. Copland delivered a letter on '* John Bright, th8 great English orator, patriot, and statesman,' which was highly appreciated by a large audience. Collections were made after each service, and the proceeds were very satisfactory. The Sunday-school children took tea to-day, and spent the afternoon very pleasantly considering the state of the weather, as it rained for several hours.
