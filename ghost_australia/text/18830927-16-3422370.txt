WliFS Dane heard a hint his tutor proposed for him he was filled with the restlessness of anticipated delight Often, while helping Donal to get up his stock of fuel he had gazed at the roof with longing eyes, but Donal had never let him go upon it, describing the pleasures the time when he could have thorough confidence in him. It was to him the prospect of a grand adventure The horn came, and with the very stroke of the clock Lady An even a was at the schoolroom door. A moment and lessons were over, and the three set out to climb the spiral stair, as David now always called the spread of the north tower But what a change had passed upon Lady Victoria She was cheerful merry with Dane almost jolly I speak of this afternoon Her day had many alternating glooms, but it was seldom so clouded as of late If even in the solitude of her chain her, where most the simple soul is conscious of life as a blessedness she was yet mostly haunted by clouds of gloom and of ear, yet other forms also had three begun to haunt her, sweetest i ii s of hope would ei 01 and anon break the CUt., h the clouds, and mock the dark ness from the room She was beginning to be able to think that perhaps God might mean as thoroughly well by her as seen her imagination could wish Does some dull reads remark that hers was a diseased condition of mind I answer til the more did she need to be delivered from it, and that with the only real deliverance from any and all nursery But her musical misery, however diseased was infinitely more i seasonable than the fancied health of those who never trouble themselves Some sicknesses are better than any but the very best health She tripped lightly along with Dal to, Doing follow ing Dai to told her he had no idea what a jolly girl she was "I did not know tion were like this' he said A body would think you had been at school with Mr. Grant Oh, you don't know how much happier it is to have somebody you must mind ' Donal heard this last remark. and spoke "If having me, Dane, doesn't help you to do just as well and be as happy without as with me it will be all in run ' "Mr Grant ' How can I be so happy without you as with you ' It is not reasonable to expect it-is it now ' ' "Perhaps I should not have said happy" answered Donal, who never get used to be put right " What I mean is at able to go on and outer yow ways aright What I want most of all to teach you he added, "is to leave the door on the latch for some one-you know whom I mean to come in This he said more for the sake of the less declared pupil Race me up the stair, Arkie, said Day be, when they came to the foot of the spital ' Very well assented his cousin "Which side will you have the broad or the narrow ' "the broad " ' Well then one, two, three, and away we go ' Dawe mounted like a clever goat his hand and arm thrown about the newer, and slipping easily found it Aictuia's ascent was easier but slower, and she found her garments in the way She gin out up and waited for Donal, who was ascending leisurely Dane, thinking he heard her footsteps behind him, flew up shrieking with the sweet to i or of the imagined pursuit of love What a sweet boy he is I said Aictura, when Donal or crook her Yes answered Donal, one cannot help fancying such a child might um straight into the kingdom of heal me Yet I suppose he must have his temptations and falls before he will be lit for it It is out of the storm alone that the is no peace comes ' then I may hope that what I have got to go through will not be lost, but will serve some good in mc ' ' there had never been an j allusion to her trouble between them, but Donal took it to be under stood, and answered Doubtless La ci y pain and over by foul, yes, every doubt, sacks after God What mother refuses to go to her child because he is only on and not calling her by name ' ' ' Oh, if I could but think that' It would be so delightful-I mean to be able to think that about God For don't you think if it be all i right with God I mean if God be such a God that we can love him with all our heart and all all our strength of lung, then all is well ' Is it not so, Mr Giant'' " Indeed it is!

There is some thought wInclut seems nothing annexes set light, but all at once it is gone broken up and gone like that had cloud. Without any argument, all at once it will look its own foolishness and vanish "Do you know why things so often come light' ' said Donal " I would six always come light, only that is matter of faith, not sight " Arctui a did not answer at once Then she said "I think I know what you are thinking, but I do not w ant to answer ' "Why do things come light so often, Davie, do you think' ' repeated Donal 1 Is it, returned Davie, "because they were made light to begin with " There is much in that, Davie, but there is a better reason than that It is because things me all alix c, and the life at the heart of them, that which keeps them going is the great beautiful God So the sun for ever returns after the clouds A doubting man, like him who wrote the book of Ecclesiastes, puts the exd last, and says the clouds return after the dam, but the Christian knows that One bus master) Who makes these the last in every song, Those are the words of faith " "You speak always like one who has suffered ' ' said Al chu v, with a kind look up at him ' Who has not, that lives at all '' " That is how you are able to help others '" " Am I able to help others I am very glad to hear it My ambition would be to help other people, if I find any ambitions But if I am so able it must be because I have been helped myself, not because I have suffered ' ' But what do you mean by saying if you had any ambition ' Where your work is laid out for you, there is no room for ambition You have got your xi work to do.
