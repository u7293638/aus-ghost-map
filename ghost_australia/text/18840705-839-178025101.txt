{poetry For those who Fail, 11 Auii honor to him who ahull win tho prizo,' The world bus oriod for a thousand years ; But to him who trios, and who fails, and dies, v I give great honor, and glory, and tears.] Givo glory, and honor, and pitiful tears To all who fail in their deads Bublimo, Their ghosts are many in tho van of years, Thoy wore born with Tiino in advance of Time. OJi, groat is the hero who wins a name, But greater, many and many a time, Some pale-faced fellow who dies in sharao, And lets God finish tho thought sublime And great is tho man with a sword undrawn, And good is tho man who refrains from wine j But tho man who fails and yet still fights on, Lo, ho is tho twin-born brother of mino.
