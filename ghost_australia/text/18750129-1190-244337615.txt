SCHOOL BOARDS OP ADVICE woe more unfortunate," or nearly so, or else one more nearly fortunate. This is the thought suggested by the report of the ?,ard of Advio. wherein it is r"l .hl'hu.b,oard sojourned sine die , " u uoara naa no business before them transact since September last, and no prospsct of any in the future." The board, like most of the other boards, com- plamed of the utter want of courtesy and responsiveness on tho part of the depart- moot, and showed that Its own position was in the highest degree unpleasant and in. effective, so it did the next best thing to giving up the ghost absolutely, and in doing so threw upon tho department the onne of enforcing the oompnleory olanses of the Act. This sort of thing has been going on all round tbe oountry, and it is evldont there must be some ohaneo made in tho edminlstration of the act. Either ths Boards of Advice must bo done awaywitjh 2lAh.8Y.mu?t havjpiHs-. of the way or havo some powers, and be re- oogniaea ny the department â€” Ballarat Star.
