A VOICE FROM THE GRAVE. TO THE EDITOR. Sir — You might oblige by sending a message to Mrs. Besant. I used to live on Poonindie station, near Port Lincoln. My body went to dust long ago, but my spirit hovers about the station and burial-ground there. But oh, what a sight — what a wreck that graveyard ! Lately I noticed visitors from Adelaide wander ing around the cemetery, and I was not sur prised to hear their uncomplimentary remarks thereon. Surely the manager could have got the station hands to give up cricket once awhile and spend one day each year about the graves and fences. But we whose bones rest there were only blackfellows ! Why I saw one of the trustees at Poonindie some time ago, but I think he does not regard this plot of ground as God's acre, and without doing anything for us merely went off boating and fishing. In a few years all will be gone, for the land is taken away and my countrymen are nearly all scattered, being adjudged by the hind board unworthy of a block of land. Is not this a disgrace to white civilisation ? I will now go and linger about Forfc Lincoln cemetery as a ? BLACKFELLOW GHOST.
