THE OVAL., Eleven of Fibst Elevens v. Twenty-Two of Second Elevens. The third of the special matches arrajjgbclby __tha-Sorrclr Australian Cricketing Association was played on the Oral or Men Jay. , fanuary 1. The contending teams an eleven picked from the first elevens of "tie variov.M clubs form ing the Association and a- selected from the Second Stereo*- and junior club*. It being known that the Twenty-Two wm strong in fielding, it waB thought that a good contest would be the result, but the match proved anything but a close one. The at tendance although not so large as on Saturdajr when the Suburban Association played, yet numbered about 400 persons, of whom a larger proportion were of the fair sex, than is usually to"b®-seen at matches played on the Oval. The weather wag cool for the fielders, but the strong wind blowing was not favorable to the bowlers. The captain for-the Eleven was Mr. J.E. Gooden, and. for the Twenty-Two, Mr.C, W. Wren. Messrs. T. Burgan and F. B. Burton were the umpires , for the respective teams. Play was advertised to begin at 10.30 a.m., but with the usual want of punctuality observed int cricket matches played on the Oval, it did not begin tlinbxee-quj^ters of an hour after that time.. The captainof~tltaJTwenty-Two winning the toss sent his opponentsinto the field, and McDougall and Giles to the wickets." Bigaud and Cole were entrusted with the bowling. .The play at first was very steady, and from the first ten overs only 10 runs were scored. Of the ten overs, six were maidens, Cole being credited with four of them. McDougall played a very steady defensive game, and after..being at the wickets for an hour and a half retired with a score of 26. E. T. "Woods partnered him for an hour and made 13 runs,, -including one fourer. He was well thrown but by Millard. At the fall of the third wicket the. score stood at 49. Several bowlers had been tried, but had not proved successful. The other players did not make any of ."hem a very long stand, but as nearly all scored the total gradually mounted. Codling made a hard hit to short-leg, when Phillips made a grand stand catch. Codlingthought that he was caught out in reality and left his ground. The ball was thrown in to ijjie wicket-keeper, who knocked the bails off, and Codling found him self run out. Butterworth made a good stand at the wickets, and scored 13, composed of 3 threes, 1 two, and 2 ones. When the 20th wicket fell the score was 109, but the last two men, J. E. Woods and Warren, ad vanced it to 126 before a separation was effected, Warren obtaining 11 runs and Woods 7. Woods was smartly caught by Cole, and Warren who walked out of his ground was stumped. The consequence was that there was a doubt as to who was out. Warren's 11 (not out) was ob tained in a free manner, but the innings of the side was that of McDougall, who only gave one very difficult chance. The fielding of the Eleven generally was very good. Gibbs, as usual, distinguished himself at long stop, and Crichton at point. Morcom was very unequal at the wickets, sometimes being good, at others the "reverse, oeyeral sasy chances being declined by him. Philllprhad a .try at wicket-keeping, but did not remain there long. The bowling at first did not prove effective, and taken alto gether it was a very weak eleven in bowling. Giffen was most successful in capturing wickets, and J. E. Gooden came next. The Twenty-Two went into the field at five minntes past 4, and as they had 126 to make in 2A hours it-was thought that it was almost impossible for them to finish the game. Morcom and Gibbs went to the wickets, and after playing the bowling of Crocker and Burnett carefully for a few overs they began to score, and Morcom played a splendid innings, making some good drives and cuts. He was scoring much more rapidly thon Gibbs, as at one time he had scored 21, and Gibbs only 9. The first wicket tell when the score was 47, Morcom being well cahght by_ Stow off E. T. Woods's bowling— 1—25—47. His score was prettily made and contained 2 threes and 6 twos, the remainder being singles. He was received with acclama tion cn his return to the! pavilion. Phillips then took the vacant position, and after making a chain hit, settled down with Gibbs into steady scoring, and made no fewer than 14 singles before getting a double. Change after change was tried in the howling department, but in vain. It was evident thai the batsmen were too much for the bowlers, of whom 10 were tried. The match seemed to be a second action of the Kangarilla match, and it was fortunate that the Twenty-Two went first to the wickets, otherwise it it is more than probable that very few of these would hava had an innings. The bowling tried was of all descriptions, from the fast overarm of Bennett and Warren to the slow underhand screws of Bleechmore, off whose bowling Phillips gave an easy chance to Bennett/ which was not accepted. When the score reached 117 Gibbs was given out !>.<*., fc Furnell's bowling, after he had 59. II-.. was received with vociferous cheering on his retirement. His score of 59 was made ia a grand manner, without giving the ghost of a chance. The score comprised 3 fours, 10 twos, and 27 singles. Giffen went in, and soon hit up a score of 8, and Phillips advanced his score to 27, when the stumps were drawn. The total score being, with sundries, 132, with 8 wickets to fall, or 6 more than the Twenty-two. Phillips's score contained 1 four, and 2 twos, the remainder being singles. The fielding on the side of the Twenty-Two, with a very few ex ceptions was first-rate. "VVicketkeeping, how ever, did not appear to be the speciality of JV, Hawkes.
