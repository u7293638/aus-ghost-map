Queer Military Order. The chaplain of the Forty-ninth Tennessee Regi msnt, Rev.. J. H. M'Neilly, remembers the first battle order that he ever heard. And well he may â€” it was so peculiar. It was in the fall of 1861, at Fort Donelson, where there were ODly some half a dozen companies fortifying and drilling. The new chaplain was messing with the senior captain. In those days, he says, the men had not yet given up all home habits. They wore white shirts and under clothes, and every night undressed and went to bed 'like folks.' One day it was rumoured that the gunboats were in the river below us, and were coming up. About midnight, while all were sleeping soundly, the long roll began to beat in the company stationed on the river bank. At once there was a stir in the camp; officers were calling men to fall in, and there was much hurrying to and fro. Captain Beaumont was al ways careful about his dress when on duty, and 'even now he did not neglect his toilet. Quickly he put on hie uniform, buckled on his sword, and stepped out of his tent to take command of his compsny. But his men had not been so thoughtful. The.v sprang up and grasped thfiir muskets, and formed in line in front of their tents ; but every man of them had forgotten to put on his trousers, and there they stood in the starlight, in their night clothes, like ' sheeted ghosts,' trembling with cold and excitement. Ab the captain and I stepped out, and his eye glanced along the line, his sense of propriety got the better of his military ardour, and he shouted out his first command : 'Confound your foolish souls, go and pat on your breeches!' The situation dawned on the men, and with Bhouts of laughter they prepared for battle by putting on those needful articles of apparel. After all, it was a false aZarin, and they were soon Bent to j bed again.
