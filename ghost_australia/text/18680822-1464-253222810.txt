AN ATTEM OP INTELLIGENCE. After the manner of Mrs. Done Browning. There's a City of the South, where, 'tis rife in rumour's mouth, People suffer oft from drouth — (mostly men) And where, also, 'twould appear, that, by sundry draughts of beer, They assuage it — (pretty near) Now and then. For a moment I'll rehearse how, for better "or for worse, Just to bless the place (or curse) came a swell ; And in ev'ry ear 'twas told he had boundless heaps of gold, And abroad the rumour roll'd Like a bell. He was treated to the best : Was e'er mortal man more blest ? At his Countship's high behest, ev'ry one Rush'd his wishes to obey ; and, while doing so, would say, ' ' What a bill he'll have to pay When he's done. " Thro' remittances delayed, he to raise the wind essayed ; While some pretty cards he played : — of the use Of turning up the knave, he a bright example gave. ('Tis but few their tins can save From the deuce). Ho, my Suabians ! gather round. Have you e'er an extra pound, For which use you have not found ? One and all To Von Attem's have it sent, and be sure, when it is lent, He'll return you cent, per cent. When you call. Out of pockets (not a few), soon the Count the "ready " drew, When away the birdie flew, and was lost ; While his creditors, bereft, found no Attem of him left — He'd skedaddled in the deft Hamlet's Ghost. "Where, oh where is now the rover?" cry all those who'd fain recover Their little bills, just over-due to day. " Will the Count return from Cleveland? May his word we all believe, and Find he will the money leave, and Fully pay ? " Hamlet's Ghost, with great effront'ry, from " the undiscovered country, " Back again, you know, has run t'ye, ere his dwindling ; But no otfier Hamlet's Ghost, back, I deem will Sydney boast — For " Success " — is Attem's toast — ' ' Unto swindling.
