NIOIIT. Nioht is tho timo for rost ; < How swoot when labours cIopo, To gather rouud nn aching hroast The curtaiu of l-oposoâ€” Strotoh tho tirdl limbs, and lay tho head . . Down on our own delightful bed ! . G&5 Night is tho time for drowns ; Tho gay romimco of lifo, When truth Hint is, and truth that sooms, Mix m fmitnstio strlfo ; Ah 1 visions loss hoguiling far Than waking dreams by daylight aro! ! Night is tho time to woop ; To wet with unsoon tears TIiomo graves of Memory, whoro sloop > Tho joys of othor yours ; Hopos that woro unguis at thoir birth, But died whon young, ltko things of earth. Night is tho timo to watch ; O'or ocoan's dark oxpanRO, To hail tho Pleiades, or catch Tho f ull moon's ourliost gluuco, That brings into tho homesick mind AH wo havo lovod and loft behind. Night is tho limo for earn ; . Brooding on hours misspoul To see tho spectro of Dospair Oomo to our lonoly tent ; Liko Brutus, 'midst his sluinboriiig host, Summoned to dio by Caisur's ghost. Night ib tho timo to thiuk; Whon from tho uyo tho soul \ TaUob flight, ami on tho utmost brink Of yonder slurry polo Discorns beyond the abyss of night The dawn of uucroatod light. ,
