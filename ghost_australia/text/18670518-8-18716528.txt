THE WEATHER -Smoe last we wrote we have not had a day quite free from rain. On Saturday afternoon some rather heavy showers fell, and on Sunday afternoon, for about haif an hour, rain fell again in torrents accom- panied by very vivid lightning and one ratber heavy clap of thunder, after whioh showers fell at lutorvals all the evening. We never ramember to have hoard heavier rain than fell about midnight on Sunday, for about twenty minutes it was a perfect deluge giving one the idea that each drop must be a bnokot full, a very heavy wind was blowing at the same time. Mondar morning proved warm and fine, with not a sign of the heavy rain, except that it had left the hills and roads remarkably clean and dry. Monday and Tuesday slight showers fell, and to-day again rather heavier, this even- ing there is a frosty feel. May 15th, 1867._
