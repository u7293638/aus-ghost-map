Select Poetry. WHERE THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY. (by Eliza Cook.) We have faith in old proverbs full surely, For Wisdom has traced what they tell, And Truth may be drawn up as purely From them, as it may from a well. Let us question the thinkers and doers, And hear what they honestly say, And you'll find they believe, like bold wooers, In 'Where there's a will there's a way.' The hills have been high for man's mounting, The woods have been dense for his axe, She stars have been thick for his counting, The sands have been wide for his tracks, The sea has been deep for his diving, The poles have been broad for his sway, But bravely, he's proved in his striving, That 'Where there's a will there's a way.' Have ye vices that ask a destroyer ? Or passions that need your control ? Let Reason become your employer, And your body be ruled by your soul. Fight on, though ye bleed in the trial, Resist with all strength that you may, Ye may conquer Sin's host by denial, For ' Where there's a will there's a way !' Have ye Poverty's pinching to cope with ? Does Suffering weigh down your might? Only call up a spirit to hope with, And dawn may come out of the night. Oh ! much may be done by defying The ghosts of Despair and Dismay, And much may be gained by relying On ' Where there's a will there's a way.' Should ye see afar off that worth winning, ; Set out on the journey with trust; And ne'er heed if your path at beginning Should be among brambles and dust. Though it is but by footsteps ye do it, And hardships may hinder and stay, Keep a heart, and be sure you'll get through it, For ' Where there's a will there's a way.'
