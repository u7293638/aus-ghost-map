THE FLIGHT OF KING FRANCIS. [From the Weekly SCOTSMAN.] Onward he flies, amid grief and dimay, With terror his craven heart bounding: Onward he flies from the dawning of day, Scorch'd by the lightning of Liberty's ray: For darkness and dungeons have vanish'd away, And the horns of bright Freedom are sounding! Onward he flies and aloud in his ear, The ghosts of Palermo are crying, "Traitor to all that is sacred and dear, Tremble false King! - Garibaldi is here!" And the coward grows pale with the madness of fear, As he thinks on the dead and the dying. Onward he flied - ever rack'd with distrust, No longer his destiny braving; At the throne of the despot he kneels for a crust With his sword in the scabbard, his crown in the dust; For the fierce Lazzarouii's stilettos are rust, And the banners of Victor are waving! Hark "Viva Italia!" now rings on her shore! Will the tyrant return to her? Never! Lo! the flash of her cannon - the deep thunder-rear Of her millions, proclaim that oppression is o'er. For the Bourbourn of Naples will triumph no more, And the cry is, " Emmanuel for ever !' Edinburgh, September 12, 1880.
