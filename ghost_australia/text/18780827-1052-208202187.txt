"Well, I will relate a peculiar affair that happened on Tallmaiis Gully, in 1859." S We \yere all attention, and listened to the very remark- f able narrative he related in the following manner : J " Yon must know, eoinmenced my uncle, "that 1 and ) four mates were living iii a tent on the banks of the r river — living, I .said, I should have called it existing, for ) we were most unfortunate, only finding sufficient gold to \ keep us in the commonest tucker. After our everj'day's work, you may be sure we were tired enough ; but we were ) evcty night disturbed in our rest by the clink, clink, clink of a pick, about fifty yards from our. canvas home. This confounded noise always commencetl at midnight, and did ) not cease until the break of daj'. One night, we were V determined to sec who it was ; so we sallied forth in the bright moonlight, and saw a figure in a coarse red flannel ) shirt, high' boots, and slouched hat, hard at work by an . old claim which had been deserjed for many years. I was chosen spokesman, to expostulate with this noisi' digger; ) but when' I was within twenty yards of him, I stood still, . transfixed with horror,-— for ' the, wearer of the digger's clothes was no 'hut. a .dmlotoii ) " rJncle.!Ned r' we all cried, ' how. fearfuL'' .
