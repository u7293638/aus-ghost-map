%\\}t .Meritenr ROMA, MONDAY, JUT.Y 14, 1879. IT. would appear that Mr.: M'ILWRAITH'S Administration .isto be hampered at every point, and, if poisible, worried out of office. The time that has been wasted in tisdess talk,' and wrangling over petty, <x>riteinptible nothingnesses since -tlie House!1 met, iias scarcely been exceeded during :-any previous session-' since ^aeerisland has enjoyed the advantage, if advantage, it^ be^ of -responsible Government. " The debate on the address was (dragged out to. such a length that the fate of empires might have been -dependent upon it. There was scarcely a nonentity in the House who-did not consider it his business to air his vanity, and expose his ignorance, on-that occasion . and what did it come to 3 There was not one man. on the Opposition benches1 possessed of sufficient temerity tochalenge the Government policy in a straightforward; constitutional way, vi&: by moving anamend pierit . upon .the address. . -All - the speeches made by the Opposition revolved around one point^the Ipswich dismissals ; and, though we in coipmon .with other journals in the colony, deplored :the .necessity that }iad arisen ibr that particular action on the part of the Ministry, we must say mueh morewas made of those dismissals than there wa^ fairjustifi cution . fori But they proved ja perfect god send to the Opposition; and acted -as a- kind ': of magnet in drawing ;tpgether their broken ; -ranks. Several grand -field nights were en joyed, ' attid'-'tlie G. TX _P. had opportunities r<cutedf-groun4 down, and cheated " by-the-olid deo^on ofpquatocracy. The new -leader of'the party promised to "give Mr. M'Ilwraith ;hon^t.''support,'aifl induced many. to ljelieve -that h^ ' iikd' resigned; all hopes;: of--again ien joymgthe sweets of office-for. some little' time at least. Bufc his- well- known greed for place, power, and - patronage has in tyro short month? .quite- changed the - tone- of - Mr. Walker O-riVfi'TH and his 'followers/ and because - two -or - .three r meetings ; have been called in some of the more jpopulous towns of the; ;col^h^%lieh Kajre pronounced i against the policy of Ministers, he feels like.a"£sh out of water,^and - has -convinced1 himself; beyond : all doubt that his place is on the Treasury j Benches. There is not a- single: inieasure which the Government has^ .introduced, -in whifeh he does not discover the ghost of the squatter; and if he does not attempt to knock BERRY clean into the ehade before many months are passed we shall rbe ; very greatly -.disappointed.. Nor' - does-^ Mr. ? GRIFFITH stand-alone in this respect, qffjg friend,*the member for ' Moretori^-who""feelS" the position of Attorney-General for a few weeks befofe the late Ministry wsjs dispensed with,. and who ^usually managed -to- -guard : himself agqinst extvavagance of expresoipn seems, to have lost all his self-control, and would ?riinp9b rank - with' the. JM'Elhox«s or BUCHANANS of, the Sydney ^Parliament. This is the sort of language he indulged in the other day in speaking of the Minister for Works (Mr. MACROSSAN) :-?'He'was always rampant when on his feet, -and *eady to jump across the table to vent his spleen and rage. His whole career in and out of office had been to attack the leader of the Opposition, but he was glad to say bis hon. friend was "ten times too much for him-because he was honest. His hon. friend was no Jesuit." This is the sort of entertainment that the public are treated to by men who have dragged the country into ruin, and who, fearful that more of the fruits of tneir bad management of the country's finances may be brought to light are, fairly., thirsting, to get back to the Ministerial larder once*jnoi^sr~ThTiy-«mo likely to get there, however-at least not just* now. Legislation is required, and must be had before'the present occupants of the Trea sury benches quit their seats; grid we trust that the trumpery adverse njeetings held here and there, originating in many instances out of gross ignorance, and in others out of a spirit of intolerance and bigotry, will 'only serve to weld the Government supporters more firmly together. A notable instance of the blindness which has overcome some of the constituencies of. the- colony in . reference to the real intentions of the Ministry was afforded the other evening at, Harrisville where a meeting was held ostensibly to con sider .the Divisional Boards Bill, but really to have a fling at Mr. X>& Bubqh PERSSE, the representative of the district. The chair was taken by a Mr. Sells and this is the way in which he attempted to "sell" those who were listening to him " If this BUI passed the House. the agricultural population might leave.tlie country, and that sis soon as .they liked. The object of " this Bill was that u fttiuiei owning a propejty^oi-tU £400 should pay 8 per cent, on that sum, |wrt M>40 annum." And then he prweedea^i jtise the Bill as the most d&jurii; brought before Parliament, as no doubt " it would have been if it was what this highly enlightened gentleman represented it to be. "But it is nothing of the sort j and Mr. 0'StJtt.lvAN, who was "present at the time, pointed this out very clearly when he said " A false issue altogether had Jbeen<jilBeedai»sT fore them. It had been said that if a fanner owned a property worth £500 ha would have to pay £i0 a-year in taxes. Now, if *jjer-£ son owned-aformworth, say, for'thie^salSoT example, j£200,tbat was assessed at its yearly value of 8 per cent; and they would have to pay not £16 ^r anniun as iEey were? erroneously led to believe, but 16s/, teingls.' 1 in the £ On its assessed annual value." The: words of the Bill itself leave no doubt what- , ever that Mr. O'SutLiVAir's statement is the' correct interpretation of the casef The artf to this effect" The iboatd shaU /fixKn^tiine to time make a valuation of':all rateable pro perty within the division, and the rates made by the Board for the purposes q£ <ihi« Act shall be made upon, such valuation, which shall- remain in force until :a.fre^ Evaluation shall 'have l>een made, and in every such valuptiop the properfcyja.teab'fo shall be <tan£ putedat itB net annual value,' that istosay' at'fche rate at which thfe skJne mig^sf. reason ably be expected to let from year to year free of all:Aisual tenjints' imtes-tkiad 'Jtaxes, <">«* deducting/ tbetrefromi ;t in a > ^Provided that rio rateable; prtperty, sh^becompjited' as of an annual value of lees ^than..eiglit -pounds per centum upon the fair capital;, .value ofthe fee simple thereof. " And -pro-; vided that no -homestead - or conditional selection shall be .xpmputed pal |0f greater, anpdall yalue than %ignt per &entum;'upon the capital value, of J;he rJfee flimpio^heteof~a,tJtbe tame ofTSfelecfcidn ^ Irtit tKs proviso sliaIl_not extend to' buildings '&nd;' <^er'lm^r*jvements upon such homestead or conditipj^J t selection.

It is clearly to be seen from the .foi^ox|^2t^% initich of the agitation against Government is ,founded in ignorance, and Is the result of ablind follow ing of -the blind. Wedo rnotj ioWever, fear that Government toII *<Sn" thatr score be deterred from following the course-they have marked out for themselves. Iib.is ^ofc their fault that men will n6t see'wliat' is plainly put before them; tHey cai^ only ,pitythe leaders who woald seek WiK^ain power b^ aisisting to continue .the? people iii their present-mani fest condition of ^ incapacity. to . think for themselves.
