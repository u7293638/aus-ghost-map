ONE WAY TO DETECT A THIEF. " I'll tell you how I ran down a thief recently," said the man in the Lewiston police station. I lost SOdol. in money. I did not say a word. I did not even tell my wife. 1 hardly told myself. The other day, two years after the occurrence, a woman inmy neighbourhood said: ' By the way, did you ever find out who stole your SOdoL' I looked her in the face and said, * I never had until just this minute.' She turned as pale as a ghost, and the result was that she paid me SOdoL and interest on the same for two years."
