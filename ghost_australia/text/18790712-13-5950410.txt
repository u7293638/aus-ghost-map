BRANCHES FROM THE MAIL SOUTJSS. A VOLCANO'S VICTIMS. BY J. H. The need of the Neapolitans to propitiate Vesuvius ia conspicuous enough to those who look upon Pompeii-the chief of ita many victims. If honouring the memories of saints can help to safety, as appears to be sup- posed, then the more honour tho better. What has been uncovered of Pompeii is moro than twenty times that which has been exposed of Eerculaneum, for the explainable reason that ashes and scoria) had only to be shovelled off in the one case, and dense layers of lava, hard as Btone, to be quarried through in the other. Quite a township has been excavated hero at Pompeii, which word the IUUans pleasantly pronounce as if finishing with a soft a. It lookB a miniaturo place altogether, from tho narrowness of ita streets and the smallnessof thehouses, most of whicharenow roofless. It really strikes one as having been constructed to meet the fate that awaited it -to have been built for easy burial and after concealment. It was n eil to go to it as I did immediately after seeing Vesuvius, to which it is what the ghosts of Ban quo and Duncan were to Macbeth. From Vesuvius one looks down upon Pompeii in pity, but when there and among its sad sights the look upward at tha great destroyer is accompanied by a strongly-felt curse best expressed in Macduff's language as he hearB of the destruction of his household gods, wife, children, and all, a fate which has been here similarly served out to a whole city full. To go to Pompeii by tho train from Naples is to lose half the romance that should accompany the visit. The effect of many sights that would be impressive, is often carelessly lost for want of a little forethought as to the right way of ap- proaching them, and that is most notable of Niagara, That meaning which Scott had in his mind when telling the visitors to Mel- rose who would view it aright, to visit it by the pale moonlight, applies equally in various ways to all the Bighla of the world that aro worth visiting. To see Pompeii rightly it should be as the finish of the day's visit to VesuviuB, to come and see here its greatest victim. Pompeii, which is said to have had over twelve thousand population at the time of its destruc- tion, stands on a promontory much extended to seaward by the additions from the crater of VesuviuB. It was a seaside resort for many wealthy Romans, who could afford to reside here that part of the year when their city was malariously afflicted. A house is shown here which ia said to have been Cicero's villa, and another whereSeneca lived in his earlier years, and a third as that of Sallust. It is supposed to have been a Bettled city for nearly seven hundred years, when, in G3, an earthquake gave it that preliminary shaking which was token as a notice to quit by many of its people. It was a long sixteen years' no ti co that they had, which might have enabled all to clear out comfortably. Looking to their small houses, the furniture of most of them might have been carried away in a handcart at an hour's warning. Like to the late eruption of 1372, the moro destructive one of 79 lasted three days only, during which time Vesuvius poured forth a mass of Btuff-stones, lava, pumice, and ashes-that would have made a mountain three times its own Bira, I say Vesuvius, when I should say Somma, which was the really destructive cone of the double-headed mountain on that occasion. Both Vesuvius and Somma are merely con- duits for what they eject. If all they have ejected was but what they themselves con- tained, they would long since have collapsed and been flattened out. There ia some great smelting work and factory of asphalte under- neath them which thus, in the course of the years, occasionally clears out stock, and shows us, by such outlets as these volcanoes, that we of this earth live only on the cooled exterior-the thin crust-of a burning world. That which the burning ashes left, the boiling water that came after effectually finished. Vesuvius having cleared out itjj aBh-pits, now emptied it3 boilers There was time given to escape, and by thä few skeletons yet found, it seems to have been well taken advantage of. Many of those found met their deaths as those have done and will do who rush into fires to rescue some treasure dearer than life itself, and Borne doggedlj resolved to see it out and wait for the worst. A village afterwards Phoenix-like, arose from the ashes of the city, at which presumption Vesuvius quietly looked on for four hundred years, and then obliterated it altogether by another eruption /that overlaid everything and filled up the .cracks. I give history as I get it from Bartolo, who has been here weekly, for years past, and knows more about Pompeii titan I do of any city that I have long lived in. The discovery of the buried city was made in 1718, and its uncovering was shortly afterwards begun, and then dropped end begun again spasmodi- cally after long or short intervals. About the ? end of 18G2 a beginning of something like \- continuous work waa made, and what was .cleared out of one excavation waa not thrown înto another, aB before done. Pompeii waa a city walled only on its land aide. Its streets, like to thoBo of Iferculaneum and the older cities of the East, scarcely permitted two vehicles to pass each other, and were paved with triangular-Bhaped blocks of lava. Like to modem NapleB, Pompeii was furnished with fountains at its street intersections. The people of Pompeii must have given very small parties and no dances. In their houses I saw no apartment in which ona set of quadrilles could have been well got through with. The fiddler certainly might have been placed in the second story that one's upraised hand could in most cases have reached to. These residences, with little in the way of windows, and nothing of chimneys, must have been mero resorts for a night's rest and a change of clothes, as we use a ship's cabin passing the other time on the deck, as the Pompeiians of the general class must have done in the public places of their city-going to their houses only much as rabbits do from their warrens to their holes. Tlio better claBS of houses were of the Roman fashion that models have made so familiar to us. It is supposed that what is now to be Been un- covered constituted half of Pompeii a3 the sun last saw it in 79. The amphitheatre, and tho greater of tho two theatres that have been uncovered, aro larger than might be expected. Everywhere .throughout Italy, ancient or modern, at old 'Baiai or modern Naples, the theatres are . on the largest Beale. The Forum is in an incomplete condition, but it was only building when all work, on that and all else besides, WOB suspended in 79. The law courts, the public baths, ia great form, and moBt of the public build- ings common to Italian cities, have been restored to the light of day, and look as if they had been better left buried. The effect is something like to opening all the . above-ground tombs in a cemetery. We aro much too curious in many things, and it is not every one that wants to see that which ¡baa been buried. The excavations of Pompeii have been greatly helped by ita having been a compact little stone-built city. Its folks Bcem to have prepared for that which happened in other ways than what I have noticed. The namo3 and signs are sometimes painted in red letters, but offener enduringly cut in the stones of the houses. No one appears to have been ashamed of a sign to his house, though thero wero many that might have been, judging by the singular things they have left as such. It is, I see, the lower stories that wero mostly only of stone, the upper one and the roof being of wood, which was another provision for easier extinction and burial tho fire destroying the upper part of the building that the falling ashes might the easier and sooner cover up the lower. Hero is the House of .the Songstress-a little bijou villa, with small courtyards, having marble statues and a little marble stage, fit only for marionette performances. In one of the court yards there is a fountain, the pipes leading to which have tapa finished in modern plumber s style The Governor of Pompeii seems to have stuck to his post to the last, m the fashion of a good ship captain. His family imitated his heroism, judging by the skeletons that were found m the palace vaults One of these got the name of the governors daughter, from the quantity of jewellery found about her skeleton They occupy a little division to themselves m the museum. In that way Pompen s productions must be seen, both in the museum hero and in that at Naples, to "vlnch this Pompeiian one is as an inte room, containing always the later discoveries only Not alone must the Gov ernor have mention as one who was true to duty in the hour of danger, and dauntlessly ao met his death Let the like honour, and if there be anj dif ference the greater, be given to that soldier guard who died at his sentry post at the city gate, where his skeleton was found grasping his sabre in its bony fingers Of this hero mention has been before made but once again to name Ins fidelity is only what one muBt do who hears it told A sense of duty that dread of death could not deaden, nor the example of crowds of llj ing fellow creatures cause one to forsake is a sense no doubt given to man), but few have the opportunity of so fehovv ing it is did this sentry of Pompeii who died at his post In the halls of the local museum are irnny glass cases, in which are models of some of the skeletons found here Beemingly chosen to illustrate the strange position to which tho circumstances of their death, or its tor tures, had drawn their forms A saucepan is carefully kept here m which aro the bones of some animal that waB in process of cooking just eighteen hundred jears ago The form of one man that was found in the hardened scorid. that had fitted the body like to a mould of plaster of paris has been BO perfectly reproduced therefrom that the fea tures and expression are quite discernible, and it is the greatest of the attractions in the way of human relics that the museum has to show To several of the skulls there is still adhering the hair, that appears to bo all that is indestructible of poor humanity I see it here only at eighteeu hundred years old, but it looked much the same when I saw it else- where on mummies of twico that age and Bomethingover Half a day in Pompeii slips by very quickly though I am shown only matters of most pro minent interest Iho temples of Jupiter, Mer cury, and Venu3 are not unlike those seen in other Neapolitan suburbs The hall of the ex change is here, as also the municipal council chambers, not looking as ancient as they would hav e done if they had not been so long and caretully covered up In a building to which different names are given-the Templo of Vestí, of Augustus, and the Pantheon several goodly statues were found, and from the fine paintings still upon the walls it may bo taken to be a palace or a temple, and of that like there are several here fantas tically christened At the corner of fortune and Bath streets, Pompeii-an address that one may well be exact about-stands the ahrmo of one whom we seek for a lifetime all the world over It is the Temple of Tortune that, by marks upon it, was set up here in the j ear 2 There are some temples that w e enter with trepidation, such is that one of the five hundred gilded tods at Canton, but here was the shrine of a deity whose worship is so genuine and general that she has monopolised all devotion -the w orld itself being but her larger temple ' In its marble adorned interior some few stairs lead to a recess where stinds an altar, behind » Inch stood, on a pedestal, the statue of the goddess of all goddesses of this world To my dismay, Bartolo does not know what the proper propitiating sacrifice is that should be laid here upon the altar He doubts whether the folks at the museum could tell mo, thinks it very likely that nobody knows, believes that sacrifices were mide according to fancy, 1B they aro to many other goddesses moro ripe and real, but often found equilly stony His lfenorauce loads, as with others, to his totting profane, as he mostly does in difiicul tics \\\ here information fails wo have to trust to instinct and to seek

which was proper to the occasion, as one w ho might, in the general muddle of things in this world, do right by accident In that sort I evolved from inner consciousness a way of sacrificing here to Fortune that was perhaps as worthy of gaining her grace as any of the millions of modes in which she has been wooed To please her I would trust her, and so proposed to Bartolo the common sacrifice to this goddess known to us all from our jouth Vie could, I found, muster between us three coins that showed on one aide n man s face w ith a reverse of a womans figure Tor several reasons I chose the latter for my luck, and vv hen thrown the coppers fell with two figures up turned in my favour Thus smiled upon by Fortune I laid the gifts, value twopence, on her altar, and so departed with the feeling of one who has done his boat under the cir cumstances, and wo are taught that 'He docB w eli who does his best ' Until the race, the human race, is ended it is hard to say what shall win* Our early education helps to teach us that we monopo lise the wisdom of the world, which an ex tended acquaintance with it does by no means confirm Wo are bid, however, to " try all things, and to hold fast that which is good, as likewise to be courteous to all, us we may be sometimes interviewing angels unawares Hence I had tried the immersion baptism of the Jordan and the washing of the sacred

Old Cairo and nt Canton had kissed, as all seemed to do, what remains there of the face of tho figure of the God of Good Eye sight -all, similarl) to this offering to lortune, as things of small means

preservative nature had prevailed among that by which they had been BO long surrounded, and they looked after all those long j ears as hut dead of jesterday Men who had mean time grown old and

like kind to that coal pit Bcene In tha* way the world has nothing to show of the like of Pompeii The streets of tho disentombed citj all bear names that seem to be chosen with more taste than are thoso of most modorn townB The Street of tho Tomb3 is, as it should ho, outside of the city, but not all of it has jet been uncovered The goldsmiths street his jet to be found, and is for Bei eral reasons anxiously ex pected A house called that of Diomed, from its facing a famil) tomb of that name, is one of thell-cstin Pompen, andonoof thofevvthat luid thtce. Toora to it I enter it with a feel mg of respect to the name of its late owner as being also the name of the winner o£ the first , run of the Epsom Derbies In this houso were found seventeen skeletons One of them is 'supposed to be that of the proprietor, because 'ita bony fingers grasped a key, and the money and valuables found about his remains are assumed to have been carried by an atten dant It is not difficult m find matter for many romances on the last days of Pompen from all that is hereabout The " Upper Ten of the twelve thousand of Pompeuan people adopted the plan seen in Bomo modern cities, of turning the lower part of their houses into shops or Btores I Ihey retailed their produce, did these pa tncians of Pompeii, in veritable business fashion, selling their grain, oil, wines,

and hermetically sealed up jears, are now liable to rapid decay from atmospheric causes and sudden et posure It is pleasant to notice that care is being taken to shelter them, and that this resurrected Pompeii is strictly guarded by caretakers Any attempt to take away a room wall for the sake of its frescoes would prov e a failure, and the pilferer be made to put it back A keen look out is also kept upon that other trick of travellers, aa bid is theirthievings, knives and pencils for cutting and inscribing names may not bo used I think of such caro when in the house of Meleager here When I am taking out a pencil to make o sketch of a fresco of a votary of Fortune, who is offering a purse to her much as I had lately done m pene», I am bid put up tho pencil, and told that I must get permission to mike sketches from the authorities at the museum m Naple3 In similar way I was forbidden to write J Hingston m fhe Temple of Venus at the end of Marine street here, which I desired to do m the vtayof leaving my name as one who had made a morning call I pass from the Street of Abundance and through Forum street into another named after Mercury, where is a double houao called is that of Castor and Pollux These sons of Jupiter were evidently great patrons of the fine arts judging by their dual dwelling Its tv alls haï c some of the best fresco paintings in Pompeii, and some that might furnish new ideas to some modern artiBtS" of barren brains The same might also be said of those to be seen in the elegant building called the Ilouse of the Poet, from its frescoes showing man) of the scenes from the Iliad It may be that the painter was of poetical taste, but the house was probably occupied by Borne rich Roman army contractor for a seaside residence No poet could have paid the rent of it-as books went in Pompen a days It is spoken of as likely, Bartolo says, that a theatrical manager at Naples will open one of tv* o theatres here, which in the way of i sensation for the curious may be for that reason patronised The last manager wag one Marcus Q Martius, whoso season came to so sudden a stoppage eighteen hundred y ears ago All the time cannot be given, however, to Pompeii, as there is Hercalaneum, that other v ictim of Vesuvius, to be seen, and only one poor day in which to do it all, and then to write of it for remembrance ere the ideas aro forgot-

Most MBitors to Pompeii como luther, as also those who wish to study ita scenes, learn ita lessons, and sketch its sights, who make a boardinghouse of it during their stay Parenthetically, here of both Pompeii and Herculaneum I may refer to a specimen of the literature of their day, found in the ruins of the latter, and now on show m the museum at Naples It consists of many hundred rolls of pap) n or the bark of tbo cypress, prepared for writing purposes When taken out of the recesa in which they were found, they numbered three thousand, and were, from their appearance, taken to be sticks of charcoal, and nearly half of them were so m ignorance destroyed Tho trouble was now how to open the car boniBcd rolls, which seemed an impossible thing One Piaggi, whose name ia worthy of mention, devised however, a machine which proved efficacious The larger part have now been deciphered, burnt and blackened as the) were They are found to consist of essaya on matters which trouble the thoughts of writers even in these latter days, such as habits, manners, ideas, life, religion, and death Of these essajs several volumes have been printed, and moro aro to follow That Resma to which I now go to find Her culaneum is but a continuation of Portici, from w Inch it is separated by a Temple Bar like gate Over a doorway on the right of the main street here appears the word Ercolano, which is the Italian form of the name of the buried town Being Sunday, no fee is demanded by the door keeper, who, in addition to letting Bar- tolo and self in gratuitously, gives to each of us a taper On lighting that we descend a flight of Bteps cut m the lava, which hore covers nerculaneum and forms the founda- tions of Resino. It is now all blackest of darknoss, which our miserable tapers only made the moro ap parent Arrived at the bottom of the steps, I am as at the bottom of a mining shaft, and m one of its excavated drives It is, however, re_'ly the theatre of Ercolano, or old Hercu- laneum, that I am now standing in Here, Bays the guide, is the orchestra, and there the stage A brilliant bghting np is, how ever, necessary to Bee anything, and after groping about in what seemed a coal working for half an hour, I return gladly to daylight 1 urther along the street of Resina we descend into open air excavations of Herculaneum that can be seen by the light of day. Not much of it has been yet uncovered, and the work has now been stopped It has been too laborious and expensive to cut out the lava, hard as stone, which has here em bedded ever) thing W hat is exposed of Herculaneum consists of three or four miniature streets or parts of them It is noticeable here, as at Pompeii how narrow were the streets, and how small the housea of theae old towns The rooms are only about half the size of those of ordinary modern houses, and were, seemingly, the residences of a small race of humanity, though such vi as not really the case Similar fresco paintings on a meaner scale than those at Pompeii are discernible on some of the walls Great labour has been given to what is here shown Much care had to be taken to avoid the destruction of the embedded build inga in course of uncovering them from the lav a, w Inch must hat e been in difficulty some- thing like detaching the fly from the amber that holds it The pnncipil one of the sights of this open iir part of the city of Hercules and the Ltruscans is called the Hoaae of Argus that lias a portico supported by twent) columna, and was evidently the best built residence of its neighbourhood These excavations were firat touched in 1719, recommenced in 1828, and continued to 1837 Among the tlnngB found there, and now in the Neapolitan Muaeum, are the figurea of the oft seen drunken raun, the group of the Satjr and the Goat, and another v\ eil know n group of six dancing g ria Her- culaneum should be seen, however, before visiting Pompeii, as the lesser Bight Bhould be seen before the greater It is too disap pointing as seen after vards The houaeB of Naples, tall bejond the com- mon, present the strangest contrast to the c)ea of the viaitor who returna from Pompeii and Herculaneum It ia as if one had come from Swift s Lilliput to the city of his Brob dignagianB I xtremes truly meet in these dissimilar habitations BO neighbourly situ ated The cause of the man) stoned houses of the Neapolitans has been, as I have pre lions)) supposed, the desire to avoid a Bimi lar smothering up to that which their neigh (boura experienced On the other hand the I amaller houses were built, no doubt, with their wooden upper stones for atoidaucoof earthquake troubles, that are as likely here- about as volcanic eruptions One dreads the thought of an earthquake m Naples, cape cially when sleeping, aa I do, on the seventh story of one of these tower like houses Pompeii and Herculanoum are usually classed together as sights, but the former is all that a traveller pressed for time need caro about It ia well worth caring about, too, among the wonders of the world, and none more so Bulwer a imaginary ac count of its last days has boen gene rally considered the most interesting of his writings Such interest is a hundred- fold intensified to those who tread streets and look at dwellings that aro now as the dead arisen, and, in Shakspeanan language, " re visiting the glimpses of the moon.' Wo might all wish to do similarly after a two thousand jears Bleep m a well preserved state such as Pompeii has bad The thought may be a vain one, but we have evidence that animal life can be preserved equally as well for that long timo as the bricks, Btones, and bones of Pompeii In gold digging at To cr a Creek, in Victoria, in 1852, I witnessed the disentombment from blue clay strata, thirty feet beneath the surface, of a live frog, which had poBsibly slept there so covered up for twenty times as long as Pompeii laj preserved in Vesuv ian ashes Nothing of imagination is wanted by those who now see Pompeii to see also, in the minda C)C, what Roman life was like two thousind j ears ago Tho well preserved Italian city is now as it then was, m all but the life Ibis child that nestled on tho bosom of Vesuvius, and was, so to speak, overlaid by it, looks more sleeping than dead-all un decajed as it is One can walkabout m the empty houses thinking that the owners may return again, or their heirs at law come as hey might and claim the property, putting up ' 1 o let on the long untenan ted buildings The museum supplies all that one wants to know of the departed inner life of the empty houses, and of the domestic habits of the people As we can know nothing of the next world, it is some satisfaction to the inquiring mind to see what like was the dead w orld of the long past At Pompeii it is to bo seen better than can elsev here be guessed at or imagined Of its interest to us there ia this much more, that when Pompeii was a Roniuil possession Britain was also one Possibly many Pom peían like towns existed there of which time has preserved nothing In the roads and walls, or the traces of them, that ore occa- sionally found m Britain, we seo a little of that outline which is so fully filled up by a visit to Pompeii It must be something pleasing to a well satisfied Englishman, if such exists, to seo how much the present cities of his native land have improved on this old Italian model. In a volume of the many books by Eng- land s present Premier, one of his favourite characters is made to enunciate this sneer at us and our doings - "The snub nosed Frank, spawned in a northern forest not 3 et cleared, talks to us of progress !-Progress ' from what and whither' The quoted paBaage, ov er which I boggled so much at the reading that I shall never forget it, occurs to one here in tho fullest force The answer to it and all such Uko sar casm is supplied by the sight of Pompeii We may there road among its acenes of the condition of the ancient world in its day The day when the so anubbed Trank was beginning his clearings in his northern forests-clearings that it is quite true have not ceased yet, though they have cleared away the dark ages, and let tho light of knowledge shino upon the world The hif,h bridged noses of the Romans, those admirable features in our author s idea, were then to be disjointed by the decrees of fate As a nation the Romans had had their da) They wero now to stand aside that therranks might take their turn on the world s stage, and show intellectual m place of nasal de vclopinent A comparison "of any Trank city of the present day and of the condition of its people with this Pompeii and the social life of its citizens goes far to answer our author a questions of " Progress ' from what and whither ' ' All the advantages of that civili sation which we now recognise as making life bearable-not to say enjoyable-were un known to the RomanB and their contem poranes The Trank, having cleared out of hiB forests and cleared away f'om the mind the rubbish of the ancient world, has made exact scientific knowledge and its proper application the prominent characteristic feature of his career.
