THE PICTURE GALLERY. CHARGE FOR ADMISSION. A corrrepondonl, signing himself "Barry's Ghost," writes to-day:— "It waa always supposed that Uie Picture Gallery belonged to the public, but tout delusion bus been long dispelled. For tnonliis paat the. trustees have charged Lsndmls- slon fee (now reduced to 6d) to Uie gal lery/ just because some Victorian artiste choose to exhibit there; 'consequently, my friends imd 1 cannot get admission to our own property. I will not; submit' to pay a fee and many others are uf the same opin ion. This Tax beam very- heavily on jvlsltors to town, families, etc., and prac tically excludes tiie majority of people who visit Uie gallery, only To meet with disappointment. Will you kindly lend your powerful aid to have tills restric tion removed, and further ask for the balunc-e sheet of the show, and thus ob lige thousands of would-be visitors 7" "One or the Public," on the same sub ject asks:—1 "Is It justlflahie for the trustees to close up the best part of our National Gallery these holiday times, ami allow an association of artists, by -adding a few of their productions to It, to make a charge .of Gd to tho public for admission?" Inquiry at tho gallery elicits tlie fact Hiul the M'Carthy Gallery only tins been lent to tho artists, who charge for ad mission. But nil the public pictures have been taken out of thu gallery lent.
