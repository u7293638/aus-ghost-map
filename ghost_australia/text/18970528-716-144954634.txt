Among the pupil teachers was a patty girl named Alice Crodk, .a favourite 'with tho whole school, apd it soon became apparent that for har smiles the two fiivmle were rivals. And when Ovaries Baylor made the mortifying 'discovwy 'that Alice preferred Aibart's company, and that she gladly accepted bis assistance in pre p&rlog; her evening lessons, tbe spirit of the : .Youth agajn burned fiercely, and he rowed to bave his revenge 'some day.' .Outwardly, to all appearance, he was as : friendly *a« ever ; he could not pick a quarrel with Langdon with out giving a r- ason ; and to confess that be sighed for tbe affections of tbe fair Alice was impossible. ' What do you think af entering in the two oared boat-rare atthe regatta, Charlie ?' asked Albert one evrniog ' There are no boats on the river so light as onra, and it is not likely that there will be any competitors from other plaoes ; the prizes will scarcely tempt them. Besides, if tbey do, we are not obliged to com ptte.' ?? If you are thinking of it, I'll enter,' re plied Langdon. ' And I'll take his insufferable pride down a peg or two,' muttered Naylor to bimself, as he went down to the rirer at sunrise qpxt morn ing, to pnt himself in training for the raco. He , would win easily, he believed, and thereby show Langdon that he was not A 1 at every thing he aimed at. And as NayloS was fully two inches taUtr, : and at least a stone heavier, than Langdon, It ! seemed a foregone conclusion among their ac ' quaintances when it became, known that the two had entered for the race that 'Naylor ! wooid be a comparativeIy'ea«y winner. | The weather on the regatta day wss all that i could be desired, and the northern bank of lha : river mi crowded with spectators, the grand I stand being filled by tbe elite of the town. Tbe ; race for' which Langdon and Naylor bad entered ; was far down in the programme, and meanwhile J they tat with their friends in the grand stand. ' Alioe Crook was there, and to Naylcr's j ntesse chagrin, the wore a neat little blue tie, i ihis competitor's rowing jackct having blue | atripee, while his own bad chocolate brown, | 'I'll tike the puff out of him '' thought ] Naylor, strolling off in another direction, to the | wonder meet pf bis friends. . I There ware aeven entries for the two-oared boat race, and Naylor was first favourite. He bad shown himself on the previous Sunday | afternoon to admiring crowds between tbe bridge*, bis rapidity Of stroke being commented ! upon by all who professed to know anything 1 - about rowing. There was a capital start, and before tjie com | petit-ore .had .gone 100 yards Naylor was leading | : with Langdon close behind. Straining every j nerve the favourite kept wt 11 in front until iie j bad rounded the buoy, but getting too mar the bank he was compelled to chip one oar for a few seconds, and^t hat lost him the race. Lang don managed to keep the left of his antagonist, and, 3n spite of almost superhuman efforts by : Naylor, won the race by about ten yards . .: Furiously disappointed, Naylor cculd hot face the sympathy of his friends, and af'er resuming his ordinary dress, went tome, leaving '.Aiice Crook to be escorted by Langdon. it bad been previously arranged .that the two fiiends should go tq a concerji that eveningj^btin^ Saturday 5 but Naytor did not turn-up at the appointed time, .and having purchased two reserved seat tickets, , Langdon 1 called - on' Mrs. Ckook, and begged hfer to allow Alice -tb go with bim.

' Ship aboy be ebon ted, but his voice was as hoarse as the croak of a raven, and could not: have been beard a dozen yards away. Tbe moon was shining biightly, however, and tbe lookout man on board the steamer happily espied tjje boat, which was painted white, with blue stripe* around the gunwbale.The engine? were stopped, and a rope thrown to Langdon, bnt he was too weak and numbed tQ catcbit. ' They have gone, and left me to perish !'* he groaned. Bat it was not eo. A boat soon put off from the steamer, and the baplees l angdon was soon on board. The reaction produced by the certainty that he whs safe, however, was more than be could bear, and when lifted on board be was insensible. ' A narrow escape !' said the doctor? ' See, ' his watch stopped at 7.15 ; he must have been sitting iu that boat, in bis wet clothes, for uearly six. hours. Only a strong constitution jcoald have stood such an ordeal.' ' ' Is it safe to send htm back with the pilot ?' jasked the captain. ' ' By po means. It would be sending bim to jthe grave. He will have a sharp attack of jfever, I am afraid.' His pockets were searched for some evidence [of his identity, 'but no papers or letters of any jkind were found. } ' His clothing and the possession of a good ! watcji and chain show him to be respectable ; I we must ask tiie pilot to 'make known the rescue jto tbe Liverpool papers ; his frieuds will thus ibe informed of bis safety,'- said the captain. ; The doctor's opinioo was verified, and Lang jdou was raving in the delirium of fever dur jing the whole of the passage across the Atlantic . :to New York. . But having safely turned the jcrisie, be mended rapidly. A colKctiou among itbe passengers had produced sufficient to pay ;for his passage home, and he thus returned to {Liverpool in tiie same steamer. ' Iu the meantime, consternation, followed by Intense grisf, reigred in two homes at Preston. iWhea Charles Naylor realised that his rillaiuous jscheme bad been successful, so far that when |hs ventured to look, round, Langdon'a boat was .not in tight, his satisfaction was but of a .mingled character. What wouW b* the result ? H«d be really contemplated the murder of his^ ?old friend ? What would he gain by it ? If :Bert. Langdon weredrowned/would Alice Crook transfer her affections to another, even though' that other tad been to Langdon like Absalorn -to David P . 1 These and other questions- of a similar nature (Charlie Naylor aEked himself as he pulled; Isteadily onwards. Tbe fog was so thick that 'he could hot aee three yards in any direction ; j :and with ears strained, he went slowly on to-, ? | ward the town, not much, afraid of being run jdown, for he; knew that very few vessels left 'Preston on a Saturday night. ; 'Thank goodness, there's * light at last, That ?tmust.be the chain light, : and I have yet morel (than two miles to go. But the tide is helping mb splendidly.' ; Ere he 'arrived at the new pier, the fog 'lifted, and then he rowed much faster. He had jfixed upon. tiie course be intended- tq adopt.

No one in the front could see the light in the . back parlour, and guessing that someone' from Langdon s had come to ask . for him, Kayjor sat stall, saying to himself/'Let them knock !
