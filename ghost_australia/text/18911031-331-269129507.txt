Much as she disliked it, therefore, at first, she had to hand herself over :o the tender mercies of Iho fashionable dreamsker. 13ut ap* elite comes with eating, mM wh<»lh*rit was that the rnthu&Aun; nf ihn moriUt' nlout gorgeous gowns, and mantle*, and what not was canUgii.us, or ti-nt the young lady had never really understood whit delight theiViiml-* mind can find over the sMection of materials. th« all-important decisions nnent cut aud shaj*©, and especially over that sujwrUtivdv exciting occupation of trying on. Mim Angel** opinions about frocks nnd fro :k-builders gradually, but s indy, underwent n complete change, nncl she was as hsppy over her newly due jvered excite ment as a child over a new toy. Miss Kershaw was closeted with her philo sopher and guide, the fashion a hi* milliner and dressmaker, deep ia th» study of the intricacies of the last Parisian edicts relating to frocks, when Hubert Underwood was admitted Ixlow, an i immediately proceeded to the library, where he hoped to find Daniel Kershaw. TL«* young man was palo. His eyes wan dered about the room restlessly, aud hi* hands trembled. Mr. Kershaw happened to bo momentarily absont, and to the young jour nalist the few minutes that elapsed before tho millionaire entered the library Appeared in t* rmiuable. Tho old pioneer at once noticed the pecu ! liarly nervous condition of the usually so calm I aud unexcitable young man, aud immediately | faced him with the remark : •* Thar’s somethin’ gone crooked, boy, I know. What is it?” ** Mr. Kershaw,” answered Underwood, “ I had intended, if possible, to spare you tho worry and auuoyance which are bound to arise from the disclosure 1 have to make to vou, but matters havo taken such a turn that 1 ilteoi it my duty to till you what has hap “ Hold hard,” exclaimed tho eld man. “ 1 guef* shat vew’ru goin’ to tell me ain’t as swert as maple sugar, and if yew don’t mind, Tilsit down to it. Now, my l>oy,” he rou* tiiiut-d. Beating himself iu his big armchair, “ yew cm Hart, an* ruu, an* race, an’ have the whole length o’ tho road." “ My father, th» f ither of whom I have such r.aecn to be ashamed,” continued Hubert, with an anxious tremor thrilling in his voice, “ is iu New York. He has been iu New York for some days.’ It was Daniel Kershaw’s turn now to feel his nerves tingling with an unaccustomed trepb datiors. .He had faced danger* of all kiuda over and over again ; he had laughed gaunt death in the face on scores of occasions, but shame, and tap<*ci»ilU shame and distress to his Angel, affrighted him. A ghost had hauuted him for two cr three days past, a ghost called up by Michael Turner’s face which he had seen from his window, the ghost of Hollfire Joe that scowled at him of a night, and glared at him from odd corners of hie dreams, and pointed with claw-like fingers to iu tom and swollen neck, and cried, ” Whit right have you with ray daughter? Give up my daughter ! Tell her tl at rou killed me 1” “ Waal,” he said slowly, “ that ain’t news as one would print, an’ buy a frame for, an’ hang in the parlour, but I guess it wos to be some day or other. I reckon he wants money, ad’ he’ll have to have it.'* ’ i 41 I h-tva given him money,” retorted Under* wood, bitterly, *'hut it ia like droplets thrown into tho oewn. The more you give, the more ho wastes in debauchery, and the more he wants. That would be little, but he has just e§» aped from gaol, aud there is no crime that he would not commit, when in drink, or to got drink. He made a great show of being anxious to reform, and very nearly succeeded m throw ing dust iu my eyes. Luckily he betrayed him* Eclf/atnl he betrayed himself over a real or pretended grudge against ’^u the cud lain in astonish ‘Agin rue ment. “ \Vh T . - ft he got A.gln me; , 1 , -*r»oie story hid to be told—-tho sore bad -/W liU lully bare. 11 Ito Lays,” continue 1 Hubert, with slowly hervous deliberation, ‘'that you hanged hia partuer, IXellfir*? Joe, tint you nearly hanged him, that Mis* Kershaw is Hellfixc Joe’s daughter, and that he will not allow her to remain in ignorance of her father’s name.” The old froutierfman had risen slowly, with blanching face, and stonilc hardening feature*, riler.1 firrv’-’-Ty the hearing bosom fiwthrJ, the op;*- 1, showing :he teeth, bird set. ati l r. h> rc1 *.

Not much he won’t, I reckon. Whar ia he:” he de manded nearly savagely. 441 have him safe for the moment,” answered Underwood, aghast at the impression his announcement bad made uj>ou the millionaire. 44 He is under lock and key in a email hotel in Cans! street, and the _ proprietor is keeping watch and guard over him.” •* But yew cayn’t keep him thar for ever,” cried tho pioneer. 44 Let’s ke.'p our head* cool, an’ see that the primin'* dry. It won’t do now to go to Yewrup, an’ leave him hyar. That would look cowardly, an’ no man or devil shall ev-r say that Han't Kershaw wos afraid of him. It ain’t yewr fault, my boy, that Choescface Mike i« yewr father, any more thau it’d my Angel a fault that Hellfire Joe was her#.” He had confessed the hard naked truth without knowing that he had confessed it, but, now that it was told, ha felt tho load of a millstone taken from his miud. For years be had jealously guarded the secret. Now another man shared it, the man of all others most likely to shield, with the bulwark of his own life, her whom it threatened. Aud Hubert, knowing that his betrothed was of as lowly, as mean, and as despicable birth as himself, was *o steeped in his love that he felt not even a tinge of added joy over the dis covery which brought Angelica Kershaw to a nearer level with himself. She was not lowered a liairsbrcadth in his esteem, in hia reverence, iu his adoration. Only a tremorous pity, a Under sorrow that anuolnted Ins love, aud made it a trifle softer aud balmier. Not a re mark, not an exclamation of surprise escaped from hia Kps. His Angel was his Angel, and he would as lief have chided a butterfly for having sprung Horn a chrysalis aa having dreamed of deeming it u reproach that the was as low-born as himself. I , ”1 gues* yew’ve got to let mo handle that ! filher p* yewrn,” continued Daniel Kershaw. \ u It ain’t to be reckoned as yow’d keep j the grrp on him another mun could. He ain’t I quite a dog gone fool. Cheoaefuc j Mike ain’t* j 1 f he’s escaped from pris’n, he knows that he j cm be sent back agin. lie may think that bis I son wouldn’t do that, but he’s tasted samples] of my pepper afore, an’ I guess his mouth is . smartiu* yet. Thar’s two things ho did. >I:k« Turner's got to l>e made to keep a close tongue, and”—here the old msn’s voico dropped, and a tremor vibrated through it— *' my Angel’s got to know that I ain’t her But surely——” exclaimed Hubert, Oh, don’t yew go an’ frighten yourself,” j interrupted Kershaw. ** I ain’t goin’ to tell her ! hen about lied fire Joe an’ his gallows. Tin ain’t nothen to be gained by that." But I count as I got to bo honest at last, an* tell her as I’vo stole her love, an’ beg her to forgive me—forgive The voice became Fofterand nearly tearful as he weut on. It was tho voice of a poor repentant sinner proclaiming his hopo of a pardon to ** Yes, my hoy,” he repeited, u I’ve stole her j Isyc ; au' what'ti more,” ho added with a stern j rcsdutioD. *’I mean to keep it, God bein’j wili n’, all the days of my life. Now yew go 1 down town, au’ if it can be did, yew bring that father o’ yewrn to me hyar. If it eryn’t be ! did, yew come back an’ let me know, au* 1 11 go down to him.” “It’s only right,” he muttered when tho young man was gone. “It wasn't fair to start with, an* God kuows I’ve tried to fight agio it, in’ t-rll her of it this many a year past.*’ The young ludy was in a pretty j»out at being Jisturbed. “What a bother, daddle dear!” she ex Jaifjifd as pho came into the room, radiant with ihe glow of agreeable excitement. “Mr?. Mortimer is upstairs, and her assistant, and she ias to go back nearly immediately, and iho lan’t wait.” “Sit down here, my Angel,” ho said softly. ‘Never mind the dre*emaker for a few “A few minutesV’**she cried, pursing her j >rctty lips. “ A few minutes?” i ** Ye*, a few minits,” he replied. “ Perhipi j tea—perhaps tifte»n, Yew'll givo them to vowr d.iddi©. won’t yaw, if he asks yew V" “Why. \on'r*>ii«. so; »u.-as a judge, daddie dear,** rejoined Mi h A:s,*nl seating horrolf ua a foot8t<%<»l At hia f.-.t looking up into his i eyes. 44 What i* the matter?

He turned his face nude end buried it in hi* hands. She, slowly and gently, and with the tears of piteous sympathy veiling in her eyes and rolling over her check*, drew his tin gem aside from where they rested, arid encircling his neck with her ^It arms, pressed her face against his, sobbing as if her heartstrings weru over- i etrained in their effort to make awed muric. i “No dad die darling," fIio cried. “ Never, daddie darling—never, now, in this lifo which is ycurs—never, now or hereafter, lyn not my father Y There is only one for motasidesyou— the Master in heaven.

Ho was not a very* good mm, but it ain’t my place hytir to cay a word ogiu biro afore yew, his daughter. Yew wos the prettiest bibby that I ever seed, an' the mo ment I ret my eyes cn row I took to yew, nn* I yew took to me. You could barely toddle then, an’ I wos as pleased as a s.juaw over a new red blanket to have a little thing like yew crowin’ at me whin I cum home from the mounting or from prairie loafin'. An* then yew growed, an’ the inoreyew’d growed, the more yew got to bo a need tome, au* I would rather have done without my pipe, an* my whisky, fifty times aye, without yew. An* then jew got to be old enough to talk, end to ask about things, nn* then the lies had to begin, and yew called me daddie, an11 didn’t like to say nay to that—it would have hurt me to ray nay to that.

I am doubly your child, for now my sense \- ; g-vitude is awakened, and I am beginning to sc?! how much I owe to your love.

I’m a fright,** she exclaimed with changed counte nance, jumping up and regarding herself in the mirror, 41 aud Mrs. Mortimer will think you’ve been scolding me, and have made me cry. I don’t care,** >ho added brightly, smoothing her tresses and cooling her plowing face with her handkerchief,44 ltt her think what she likes.*’ She blew a kiss to him aa Bho paused fora moment at the door. “ God ble'8 you, daddie darling,” the whis pered, and was pone. Gone like a soft breeze that has cooled the burning face. Gone like a bounteous shower that has refreshed the fun scorched plain. Gone like blessed charity that leaves its happi ness in its wake. Gone* as love does go when it has brought life and hope, and has promised to return. The pioneer wis fitting in his arm chair dreamily, us he had never remembered himself before. ’ A doubt still battled in his mind. Ought I to have told her all? ho deliberated with himself. Ought I to tell her still No, no, no, no! enmo the answer of hia conscience, clear ns a clarion; you must not break her young heart and blast all her life with tho eaiik?riog thought that her father was an assassin. At that moment young t'ndtrwood appeared at tho door, paler even than ho had been earlier in the morning. '* What's tho sign now?" asked Kershaw. 41 Js lhar a paiuther loose r" "No," gasped the young man, 44 but a j creature that’s far worse.
