Friebteued to Death. ? « ? . Startling Experience of Salvation Army ITasshs. A correspondent sends ? the following startling narrative to the Daily Chron icle : — The peace of a select circle in Oxford is just now considerably disturbed by the facts having leaked out concerning a very thrilling ghostly visitation which happened a few weeks ago in an old house, reputed for a long time past to be haunted. No tenant had been found sufficiently bold to hire it until lately, when some young ladies connected with the Salvation Army, under the head of Miss W ? , a well-known worker among the poor, ventured to take it off the landlord's hands for a small rental. The first night they slept there they were much disturbed by uncanny noises and by strange sounds of the moving of furniture. Determined to discover the truth, they set to work in a very metho dical way flouring the staircase, so as to detect footsteps, and by pasting up the fireplace. They .? moreover induced the policeman to watch the house, so as to prevent any knavish attempts upon their credulity. The result was highly unsatisfactory, for on the second night of their stay they all saw the figure of a woman apparently issue from the wall, and pass up the stair case and vanish. Miss W ? declares that the apparition actually 'passed through her own person, as through a door.' On the following night Miss VV ? was upstairs, the other two ladies remaining in the parlor. Suddenly Miss W ? heard an awful scream, and rushed down to see what had happened. On the stairs she was met by the ghost, which once more 'passed through' her.' Nothing daunted, the brave lady pro ceeded to look for her companions. She found one of them in strong convulsions and the other in a dead faint. The sad part of the story is that one youp.;j lady has since gone raving mad from the effects of the fright, and the other died a few days ago from the same cause. The ghost is that of a tall female in a long grey dress or robe.
