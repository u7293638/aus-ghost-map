On tbe Appearance of the list there . was a generally expressed opinion ' . among good ju dge b that M slua bad been let down very ligh tly . In this opinion f folly . agree, for when really himself it takes a lot to stop the flying son of St. .Albans, With 88t. 71b, Malua won tb fBteBt run Newmarket . Handicap on ieoord when be n&siiy; defe&tfid; Le Grand, Claptrap, and iwpntyglft " ; Others. He followed up thfvictprjr hyl winning . the O&kleigh; ' Handicap at : .'-"-A;. Caulfield . in a canter, with Dst. l -- in the saddle. When lankily : suffered . a narrow c efeat by NewetOfid, . in , the Flying . Stakes the six - ; farlonga being 14|sec.f -which, with, the ezcaeption of a reccrd of halt a'secpad ieis! . J r obtained by an Amertrtn horeel name -- Barrett, is the tastesttime/the threeuarters f- of a .mile: has ever bebn accomplished . by a - ' horse. On that occasion Mr, InglU bay . : had 9st. lib. in the saddle, find his defeat by Newstead was entirely due to the feotthat r Robertson, who rode him/ topk matters . rather easily before crossing . the v fan. Jlb it was, Robertson thung|ht ; . that Malua got home „ first ; byV 04 ; 3 bead, but, as the pair finished on opposite :V l sides of the straight, the judge was the only person to state' positivelj as to whioh hiff won. Anyhow, leaving' that aeide ahd' discarding his Melbourne Cup and Adelaide Cup victories as not having a very A s direot bearing on such a _race as that under review, the faot rsmains that : Malua has a record over short distances that has never been eqoafled in. Australia. For some time past Be has been rnralising at his owner's residence at lubes' ton, near Baltan, where, dutinghiB vtiuiri dig. he has served a few mares. He is now said . to be m a forw&rd; eondition, and, depend upon it, if he is brought to the post- in "his best form, which a handicapper is hound to assume in framing his adjustmeht, he must, . indeed, be very difficult to beat with 9 -t. !21bi op. Somehow, whenever this hcree Is most to be feared in hisT&o;'ss, rumohrs prejudicial to bis chances are freely oiioulated and generally /believed. Previously it was "spavins," " queer leg," and kindred ills. Now it is that he has been too freely used at thestud,and suffers from weakness 'Now, while I am not prepared to deny the troth of : tbe latest rumour, I . shall bo deddedly' soeptkal until I ascertain the correctness the statement. As, however, the entries; were made some; timcAgo, I deollne to believe .. .. . that those in charge of the horse would be so foolish as to throw away whatever ohanoe the horse might have bad for this year's New- " jnarketby Indulging bimtoofreety at the harem.
