CEMETERY GAMBLING. Tho playing of euchre and nap in tlie shade of a treo behind a paddock fence is tlie country and suburban representation of "heading 'em," and such sports, in tho city streets, and. as such, occupies a good deal of the attention of police constables in charge of outlying stations In their spare time. Sunday is always a great day for the sport, and every now and then tlie pollco drop on a social card-party and break it up, getting one or two fined, perhaps, but only, as a rule, making tbo players seo tlie need of greater caution. The latest discovery of a school, however, shows some amount or reflec tion, and not a little originality. They fixed on tlie Rookwood Cemetery as a trysting-place, and ill somo of its more sequestered spots wore able to util'iso mortuary masonry for tables, and play "all they knew" without fear of ghosts. Tilt- local pollco, however, got wind of tlio plan, and now tills playground is taken from tliem, and .there Is much disgusted comment In local larri kin circles in consequence.
