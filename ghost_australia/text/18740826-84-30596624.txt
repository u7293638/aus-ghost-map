You know .that "with the chairman rests the do t 'cisioni of who is or is not entitled to , vote.. This, doubtless, is giving one u man a tremendous power; but such, I doubtless,is the fact; and if any abuse vI of power; is shown, the- wronged party r has .his,remnedy.. Well, one gentleman of great respectability was proposed by r' another gentleman-I shall not men a tidii' 'ni'oa-4nd 'the proposal was I secoindod; but,' 'unfortunately,'" the \- secoonder was declared by the chairman" I a non-voter,, and then commenced a dis 1 graceful 'scene-the proposer doolaim r I'ng against the decision of the chair. a manll, and the seconder throwing over \- his shoulder the British Flag of Free 1 dom, swearing by all creation that he a would vote, defying all and everybody Sto deprive him of his sacred right. Un \-- seemly noise grew into violent olamour, i till all was'drowned in: an uproar of f. voices. This lasted some time, and l partially subsided, when another gen tleman-a voter-rose and seconded 9 the first proposal. Things seemed growing calmer, when a person rose 3I and proposed a second !candidate,' and Sthen the storm-burst forth with heavier t power. 'The proposer's right 'to vote Swas questioned, and his eligibility ad. miitoed by the chairman;' and then, as. if Tartarus buhad broken loose, the Babel :recommenced, the commoniers weie called upon to resist the decisiontof the 'chair and'nit allow themselvs.'to 'be trampled in the dust, cruel ungeneroii assertions were tossed about like chbam pagne.corks at a racing ball, and at last a' stampedoe from the Court house of about, half the assembled party. One or two other gentlemen were voted as trustees, and when the meeting was asked.if there was any oth'er person' to be nominated, a ,voice proposed a cer tain individual, whieh was seconded, everyone present looking upon the thing as amorry jest. The votes were taken and given to the scrutineers, who returned with tho:ballot the last., named gentleman, 'having nine votes above all other nominees; and so the -persons whose votes have placed a man whose: age, infirmities, position,' and. lack of business habits in the position of trustee to the eommon maylay. their heads' to' rest and safely say we at least are' unworthy of the noble privilege given us by the franchise of our coun try, and that an insult of a most grave natiryv sthrown at the.worthy man wi'o were' willing i use their influence for.tho.benefitof theirfellow-townsmen.
