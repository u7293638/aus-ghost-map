BULONG. (From Our Own Correspondent.) BILONG, October 28. On Wednesday, the 27th instant, the first mask ball held en the goldfields of West Australia eventuated at the Miners' Institute, in aid of the local cricket club. For some considerable time the district has been in a ferment, and great secrecy had been main tained as to costumes. etc. At 9 p.m. the hall was fairly filled with "dominos," and great was the speculation as to the identit ies. Sharp at 9 the grand march was led offby a " Queensland Stockman" and the graceful "Nedda." All and everyone dressed and acted their parts in a most able manner. To see " Dr of Music " flying round in the arms of a "Ghost" 't Pierette," the fascinat ing, trying to overcome the taciturnity of a Mute;" "Monte Carlo" with a sort of " Parson," '" Bo-Peep " looking for her sheep with a "Butcher," "Fairy Queen" with " Night and Morning," "Cherry Ripe" and "Gentleman of 20th Century," "Queen of Roses" and " Mephisto," the Grecian " Par thenia" with a "Clown," and a " School. girl" with a " Real Old( Irish Gentleman," whilst " Deadwood Dick " had in his arms an "Alsatian Peasant." All this gave your scribe much food for thought. and long and bitterly did he wrestle with the supposed in congruity of the matings. About I1I the order for unmasking was given, and then, in. deed, there was a revelation. Having been here so long I thought I knew everyone, but I have been talking ." horse" (rather vulgarly) to "Deadwood Dick," and " he" was a lady, who shortly after appeared in even. ing dress. The supper (the giftof the ladies) was a most decided success. Too much praise cannot be given to the committee who engineered this inaugural mask, and Professor Leippert's music was what it always is, a treat. Whilst on this I may ay that no one would have known our " Musico " had it not been for his " touch," as his get-up was simply perfect.
