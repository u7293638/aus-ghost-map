POETRY. THE SUMMERS OF THE LONG AGO. " I sleep, but my heart waketh." (Publithed bu remutt.) When silence (oils upon the solemn night, And all in house and street is bushed and still, Bright visions rise before my happy sight. And come and go at will; And days long Bed, Ghosts of the past come to me from the dead. And friends I see in dreams as fair and sweet As were the summers of the long ago, "When the golden days we used to meet And talk in voices low, And often stand Within the sphere of an enchanted land. Awake I die; in dreamp1 live again For then return the b apes I knew of old, Ere I had wept, or love had grown to pain Ana left me sad and cold When all the hours Were scented with the fragrant breath of flowers. So when the waking comes, it comes too soon, For with it pass my bright and blessed dreams, My sun sinks suddenly-goes down at noon leaving behind no gleams; Gone is my spring, And life becomes a wintry frozen thing. Ho would I dream, and wnke, and dream again; Oh love! ob hope! come back a little while. What though the wak'ning must be full of pain ? In blissful sleep I smile. Come vanished years, Let me dream still, althouch I wake in tears. CANON BELL, D,D.
