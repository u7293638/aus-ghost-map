MOODY AND SAN KEY. (THus THE WORLD, MARCH 24) From the number of letters which we had received thanking me for having raised protest against the crusade of fanatics inaugurated by Messrs. Moody and Sank we are led to believe that we have do good service to the cause of honest racing in treating these orgies of ecstatic piety w the ridicule which they deserve Wl an American citizen announces that he who call to convert the whole of England and a preliminary step prays with uplifted hand and eyes that the spirit of criticism may taken away he put himself beyond ' pale of sober reason We are by no men surprised at the crowds that attend i performances of these quacks for novelty is attractive more particularly what is well advertised and exhibits free of charge That ungainly be the hippopotamus daily attracted me thousand spectators to Regent s park wt he first arrived in England and Kenealy has only to hire a large hall of to revile his letters in order to become pot lar for the idea of a Queen s Counsel OBE ing with scurrilous invective the Lord Cb Justice is at once novel and mongrel That the Moody and Sankey entertaining should however be countenanced by p sons of thought and intelligence does inde fill is with wonder We should have a agined that the serious evils prepared from the emotional religion which they celeste would have prevented all except t most fanatical of sedans and the most Be of human beings from giving even a ta support to these dangerous men. America is overrun by wild, ignorant a ardent fanatics. Some of them give out as they have a mission to preach a scheme existence in which sensual enjoyment is st limated into a doctrine in Boston a se periodically assembles a flock of dupes in t streets who arrayed in white Lonnen fancy that they are about to be bodily tra sported to heaven Spiritualism bag believers in countless numbers a there is hardly a town too small in t poorest state of the Union to support medium who professes to call up ghosts as to see visions Evangelists of the Moo and Sankey sort are numbered in thousand they collect together crowds at cam meetings where young girls of nerve temperament are thrown into convulsion and converted If once we cease to surrender our reason into the keep up the first fool who pretends to have a miss from heaven we bid farewell to the landmarks of common sense in whether we become Shakers with Mrs Gi n g in the New Forest or Revivalists wi Lord Radstock and the Earl of Cavan the Agricultural hall or err with Mr John son of Colchester the latest of religious m romantics and batter in the brains of age relatives with a poker is a matter of no chance. It is by no means easy to understand the tenets which Messrs Moody and Sankey pr fees So far as we can gather they won have us believe that the vast mass of the who heretofore have supposed that they we Christians will go to hell To avoid the fate they must suddenly feel an intern commotion which is to be promoted by the contagious nervousness that is developed 1 meeting together in crowds to pray and sin All who venture to question the truth this strange doctrine or to regard eye evangelist who preaches it as an apostle teacher is an enemy to Christianity TI evidence of this new birth is a tendency relate experiences to pray in public distribute leaflets to listen to eva geese and to denounce as infidels all we prefer as spiritual guides respectable clergymen YY bat the movement is to become we lead from the pages of the 61 than a period line which is published in the interests of li Revivalists. ii e ask again Days this official organ what does this present movement moan Does it mean the restoration of the form power with the preaching This will soon with the restoration of the apostolic Gosp preached by apostolic men They will Go Himself bear witness with silica and wor dera and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost The same newspaper informs us what revivalist meeting ought to be by a reporter what a revivalist meeting already in in Wales The narrator is a brother of Mr. C 1 Hurditch We have had such a time of blessing yoste day-such a breaking down and praising Go never was seen or heard at Tanyb vic before Husbands wives fathers mothers brothers and sisters were all crying out at once.

The idea of a clerk in a Boston boot store arriving in England to convert its inhabitants with a copy lighted assortment of prayers, a s veot toned organ and a friend who can ani- is exquisitely ludicrous How can Mr Moody seriously ask us to believe in the divine origin of his mission when he on playS a lawyer to prevent the dissemination of his doctrines 1 By no effort of the imagination can we conceive an apostle preach nig a new religion with an attorney a clerk by 1 is able to land or anyone from parting IIB projects We are quite ready to admit that the publication of Mr Moody's due course and supplications would not tend to increase his fame but this dread of public on the part of the Beer is a confession weakness that tells its own tale We ft appreciate the policy of the veto Mr Moi recited lately, from his own experiences i story of a father who after searching for prodigal son in every city of the United States at last discovered him in California. Were story published it would be found to be feeble adaptation of a tale of Bret Harte the Archbishop of Canterbury said I Moody at a recent meeting were to win through the streets of London blowing from st like Joshua before the walls Jericho the press would be down upon him. This sort of nonsense would hardly p: muster were it printed. W but does it mean Absolutely nothing Does Mr Moody ci sider that his grace ought to elapse about t streets with a trumpet ? Does be think the if he did the press ought not to be do upon him ' There is no intelligible c planation of the phrase It conveys no ill It is simply the utterance of a bullet accustomed to raise a silly laugh by jingle of words the only point in what is their ludicrous 'appositeness ' judge from the discourse which we were privileged to hear the observation respecting the trumpet and the archbishop is a ft sample of Mr Moody's style when he come seconds to jocularity He has by heart t usual commonplaces of the ranter and endeavours to relieve the monotony of th deliverance by stones which be has filch from American humourists and burless adaptations of the language of Holy Wr When these fail in thou: effect he calls up Mr Sankey for a song It is extraordinary how these revivalists i sist upon persistently praying for every o except themselves and how all want to leaders in larool Chicago the city fire which Mr Moody bids proudly boasts it is the wickedest town in the universe b the evangelist loaves the sinners of the wicked town to themselves an 1 crosses t seato convert England Glasgow we had always understood is not a town pre name for its virtues but in Glasgow "he elect meet together to pray for London forgery of the northern proverb which counsels wi men to keep their am breath to cool the air parritch At the prayer meetings London special supplications are made of those who are not present Children bag of audiences to pray for their parents still sin.

Moody and Sankey are apostles therefore they will soon w one miracles Neither Mr Moody nor Mr Sankey probably would understand what is meant by a val to prm c won but we would suggest that Mr Cowper Temple might perhaps explain to them the meaning of the term It is idle to hope that the spirit of fanaticism will ever be extinguished Sects will always exist in every part of the globe with strange and mystic tenets In the LEW dervishes will continue to dance themselves into a delirium when they will form at the mouth and fancy that they are in a condition of religious ecstasy In England awakened evangelists will require influence over the ignorant by emotional declamations blasphemous pretensions to prophetic power and appeals to the most dangerous of human passions But because a plants cannot be eradicated its progress should not be vie vee with indifference The disingenuous tricks of religious quacks should be exposed then impudent assumption that they and then delivered dupes alone are to use their own words Christians should be rebuked al who have been taught to believe that piety if not allied with convulsions public worship with the irrational ravings of a madhouse and religious observance with weeping lass ing and incoherent Bhonts should unite together to defend society against the inroads of self ordained evangelists and self dubbed apostles. We subjoin a letter from a lady giving a description of the women s meeting held last Sunday and the proceedings in the inquiry room - March 21 18" J fair -I have just returned from a Moody and Sankey women's meeting and it may perhaps interest your readers to learn what took place At 4 o'clock I found myself at the gate of the Agricultural hall in the midst of a crowd of women poorly dressed but most of them I imagine respectable working girls There we remained for an hour and a half sings it hymns when the gate was opened There was a general rush to got places but after a policeman had bawled out These women are all Moody mad don't rush ladies there e plenty of room we quietly took our seats A gentleman now appeared on the platform and requested us to inform our respective pastors that there would be tea the next night at St Mary s Hall on which they were invited when Mr Moody would discuss the (good work with them After a short i ause Mr. Moody and Mr. Sankey made their appearance Mr Moody having requested the ladies who had sought to Hit their handkerchiefs before then mouth s and not to se ellie our feet Mr Sankey took his place at the origin and with the preliminary observation Ml rise and sing, burst forth into a lively negro melody to the words of a hymn This over Mr Moody said I of us have a short prayer and an old gentleman read a i prayer Then Mr Moo by 1 rayed aid again Mr Sankey sing Mr Moody s discourse non commenced the anecdotes with which it was interspersed created much laughter the doctrinal portion consisted of the stereotyped appeals to sinners to be converted which are habitual to the preachers of his class i Son Mr Sankey by particular request sang a solo > Again w e r rayed after which Mr "Moody said that any one who wished to speak with his would find him in the inquiry room The inquiry room in which I pe retreated was a long sort of corridor with benches and chairs On one of these I sat down when a woman came up to me and asked me if I was a worker or it I wished to be spoken to I replied that I wanted to speak to Mr Moody Then an old man took a chair and sat beside me no took my hand in his and squeezed himself unpleasantly against me After those preliminaries, be asked me if I was a Christian I replied that I was and he then offered to show me the way to Bowen On my saying that I preferred seeing Mr Moody he replied that he could show me the way to heaven as well as Mr Moody as he knew the word of the blessed Lord which had made him what he was a good and true Christian Will you be continued queen ing my hand warmly kneel down with me and offer up a short prayer ? Again I answered that I wanted to see Mr. Moody when he left me and was succeeded by an old lady who also offered her services to show me the way to heaven Dear sister She said I am in though perhaps you would not think it I know what a blessing and a comfort the Saviour has been to me Do do kneel with me and pray him to save your soul Again I answered I want to see Mr Moody This gentleman now came into the room and put on his greatcoat. He was instantly surrounded by a number of women who formed a new round him which I joined no talked in a pleasant agreeable manner told us some funny stones, and said that the road to Heaven was so smooth, that we had only just to walk along, and the gates will open without any trouble, 'You are confident that the chair you are sitting on will bear you ; why can't you be as confident in Jeans?' Then he asked each of us, 'Have you got hold of Jesus?' Some said, 'Yea.' To these he replied, ' Keep him you are all right, ain't you?' To those who answered 'No,' he said, 'Well, and why ain't you got Him ? Ain't I been talking to you this half hour to show you how easy it is to get Him?' Then he told us to spread ourselves out and kneel down on which he prayed for us. This concluded the interview. There were about 300 women in the inquiry room, and a few ushers. The workers, consisting of women and ushers, numbered about 20. Most of the women were crying, and kneeling in groups about the room, with a worker in the midst of each group. In the midst of a large group was Mr. Sankey. Many women were hysterical, and uttered ejaculations. A woman next to me kept constantly repeating ' Bless the Lord, amen ! '-Your obedient servant, E.G." Comment on this veracious account In un nessary. M
