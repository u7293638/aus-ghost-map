From the Lancefield Guardian. WE believe'the fate of the M'Culloch Mi nistry is sealed at last-they having placed their resignation in the hands of His Excel lency on Thursday. The cause of death may be stated to be general corruption which had the effect of disordering the constitution to that extent that they were forced to give up the ghost on that day after having for years stood many severe shocks, and after having submitted to repulses which men of a more spirited and dignified disposition would long ago have shrunk from, and would rather have laid down their lives honorably than cringe and crawl doggedly. The sound rea soning of Mr Fellows on the Appropriation Bill which contained the Â£20,000 grant to Lady Darling was too much for the Ministry to withstand, and they wvrithed and twisted for some time, but subsequently had to ex pire, and in their requiem we cannot say else but that they have gone to the grave "unwept, unhonored, and unsung." A meeting of the Ministerial supporters was to be held yesterday evening, but the result has not yet transpired. It is thought that Mi nisters want to bind their supporters to a certain course of action similar to that re sorted to in connection with the "tack" of 1865, but it is generally believed that the supporters of the Government will not do as requested. The Governor has placed himself in communication with Mr Fellows who has consulted with Mr MacMahon, the re cognised leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, and we believe there his every likelihood of a party sufficiently strong to carry on the business of the country for a time being formed. Whatever party takes the reins they cannot be worse than those who have managed business for the past three or four years, and have during that time placed the colony on the verge of de struction.
