CR. JOSEPH. [To the Ediiov of ihe Bcndigo Advertiser.) Sir,-So there is a Darling Ward ratepayer dis satisfied with Councillor Joseph, and who, from inquiries, has found out that he has to absent himself to attend race meetings. I doubt very much, even among those who opposed him, if a single Darling Ward elector can be found who is dissatisfied with him. Never lias successful candidate been truer to his pledges, or moro inde fatigable in tb.e interests of tho oity-ind his ward in particular. It wants no ghost to tell us that Cr. Joseph attends important race meetings, and that he betsonthemjneitherdoes itrequire asageto interpret " Ratepayer's " letter. With Connaillors Jackson aud Bayne, how dooa tho ward suffer ? However, aa ono who is perfectly satisfied with hia august vote, I take it as a compliment to tho judgment, of the large majority who returned Couucillor Joseph, that he is only to be absent at one meeting to be missed. How many other councillors can the same be Paid of? I could have pureed with '<Ratepayer." if he had said It was peculiar that the estimates for the year were passed during a Christmas holiday, and that he did not consider a fortnight at Christ mas time was too long for councillors to expect, when ipambero of Parliament, who aro paid, allowed themselveB fivo months in a year, and the balance spent in some instan ea in the billiard room or cardroom till the division bell rang, __IÂ» " Ratepayer " aware that nearly everv i^y (not only on Friday.) councillors to Attend com mittee meeting?, w-'.Cr Joseph is always at his jjost, iet anonymous pop-puna doter'yo'o, , Joseph : keep on 'a3 you have been ffojng and you will have the public with yon. -Yours, etc., .
