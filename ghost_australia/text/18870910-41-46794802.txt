\- POOTB±IiL'irOTESr ~ ' -rBTGOAIJOST.1 - The match played at Alberion aa Saturday betweeen the Ports and South Adelaides wa3 a great boQ over. After defeating tha Norwoods and Ade laides the Souths antictaatMi that thm wnnlfl hn able to tie up tha Ports, bat the calculations of the majority weie upset by the defection of the minority Alstrong team had been chosen, and all turned up with tbe exception of Watling, Sliddleton, and Grogan, -who quite unexpectedly failed to pat io ah appearance, as soon as it was known tnat'.they vrera sway odds were laid on tha Ports, 'who justified the confidence reposed in them by winning with 11 goal3 11 behinds against 4 goals S behind^. Tbey had th.3 came in their grasp from the start. The Souths opened with the wind, which was strong, but even then tbey only had a little the best of matters. The Ports, on the other hand, when they Lad the -wind behind them, bad the Soutb3 in a corner. Tha winners finished up with great dash, pntting op 4 goal3 in about twice a3 many minutes. Tbeir kicking was wonderfully good, very few easy chances being missed, while most of tee bebinds came from SIcKenzie's 60 or 70 yards fihota A prominent feature of the Ports' pJay -was their little marking, which tbey adopted with success, especially -alien opposed to the wind. Cofieo excelled in this branch of the game. A. Busbhy for the Ports notched 4 goals out of 5 chances. The Souths, a3 was only to be expected, with their captain absent, lacked unity. Indi vidually some of them played splendidly, Monck, in tha centre, doing perhaps more work *M' any one else on the ground. Iney Mebrten3 was also as good as ever, but his brother's brilliant dishs3 were too often thwarted. At Kensington the Norwcod3 defeated tbe West Adelaides for the fourth time this season, the final scores being— Norwood 14 gosls £0 bebiad3 ; West Adelaide, 1 behind. Of coursa the Wests, who tried several juniors, were never in the hunt. For the Norwoods C. Woods, from the Creswick3, kicked three very fine goals. Another soft thing was the contest on the Ade laide Oval between the Adelaides and Qawler Albious. The Uawlers did not have all their best men present, so that it was no wonder that the Adelaides kicked 7 gcals 20 behinda against 1 goal i behinds. The Gawlets made some brilliant dashes but were quite unable to sustain an attack. Tbe Ports by defeatinz tha South Adelaides have once more drawn up level with ths Norwoods for top place on tbe scoring-list. But the Norwoods pJay another match to-day, whereas the Ports have nnished their programme. If the Norwoods win, which is probable, tbey will technically ba -013 of a point in front of the Ports, This advantage will be the result of the extra match the Norwoods played with tbe West Adelaides, who had not the ghost of a show to win any of the games. If they claim pre miership honours under tnese circumstances an un usually successful season will terminate rather un satisfactorily. Ihe test ha3 really been be tween the four old clubs, and the resnlts of the matches between them leave tha Norwoods and Poits level. Looked at in alaiost any way, tha Norwoods have tbe best record, but the fact re mains that piactically they are level with the Ports, and a play .off would be the only equitable way of settling the point. It Is understood tint there is a desire on the part of both teams to play off, and it is to be hoped that some satisfactory arrangement may be made. The Ports are especially anxious to play and have challenged the In or woods, who will not decide until after to-day's match.

On Wednesday, Ausust 31, they met twenty-three from Mount Gambier. The fame was very evenly con tested, and the city team only won at the last moment, tbe final scores being— Hotbam, 4 goals 4 behinds; Mount Gambier, 3 goals 3 bebiada. There was another tcujth ttruggle on the following Saturday, when the Combined South-Eastem Twenty tried conclusions with the visitors. The game was even and somewhat rough, the Hothams eventually winning with 1 goal 10 behinds against 14 bebinds. Tbe trip was a most enjojable one, the visitors being treated splendialy. Several enter tainments were arranged for their delectation, and tbey were publicly received by tbe Mayor. The only unsatisfactory element in the trip was tha sc*nt patronage accorded to them. They were, however, che victims of misfortune, as rain kept the people away. The Hothams went down expecting to make money, but they have lost considerably. The running for tbe honour of being premier goal kicker for the season is very close. A. Bushby and Stephens have had a neck- and-neck race, tha former having a slight lead now. His rival has. however, another opportunity to score to-day. At present Buihby has 25 against the S3 goals notched by Stephens. Irnless the unexpected occurs Carlton are sure of top position in Victoria. They defeated Melbourne after a good struggle last Saturday. The scores were respectively 5 goals 8 behinds and 1 goal 8 behinds. Geelcng defeated Sou h Melbourne for the second time tbis season, the scores being, Geelong, 7 goals 7 bebinda; South Melbourne, 6 goals 15 behinds. With the wind to help them in the last quarter. South Melbourne at one period kicked 3 goal3 in 5 minutes. 1 he game was splen didly contested. Ibis win put3 O eelong second and Somh Melbourne third.

The old club will doubtless win, but if tbe Hothams play as well as they dia against the South Adelaides they should have a satisfactory record at the close of the game. They have stuck to tbeir work splendidly hitherto, but have had few opportunities to make money, and it is therefore to be hoped that there will be a good crowd on the metropolitan Oval to-day. The West3 will probably meet with another defeat at tbe hands of the Adelaides on tbe Kensington Oval. These matches will conclude the programme arranged by the Association.
