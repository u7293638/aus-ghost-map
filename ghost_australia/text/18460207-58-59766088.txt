Original Poetry ? AN ACCOUNT OF THE VISITATION OF SUSAN SOME- BODY, WHO WAS KILLED BY THE LATE MAIL ACCIDENT. Versified by order of the "Humane Society." 'Twas twelve o'clock--a melting night-- To sleep in vain I tried, When Susan's ghost came stealing in, And sat at my bed side. O, Charley dear! O, Charley dear! Pray "take a last fond look;" I'm just "come up" now by the Mail-- You see I'm safely "book'd." My arms at Campbelltown I've left-- My hands so soft and clean, Are now pack'd up in white kid gloves On Mr. Smedley's team. And, oh, my head with ringlets black Was injured in the slush, And so, to renovate my curls, They're left at "Bargo Brush." Those dear small feet, those dear small feet, Alas! I've left behind; And if not hanging in the "trees," Why in the "Boot" you'll find. My mother, too, was coming up, But now is distant far; At Doyle's her lifeless corpse I left, Where I did "Berri-ma." But as a token I will send, (And from it never part), Encas'd in gold for you I left , My HEART with Mr. HART. And Charley dear, and Charley dear, / To tell all do not fail; / Let "passengers" come up by Jones-- "Dead Letters" by the Mail. F.M. Goulburn.
