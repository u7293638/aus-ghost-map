THE V.R.C. STEEPLECHASE MEETING. [Abridged from the Daily Telegraph.'} TLe Maiden Hurdle Kaoe vm lbs first event of tbe dny, and this was thought to be virtually a match between The Star and Handy Andy, but the former was never in It from tbe fall of tbe flag, and Handy Andy, who teas very patiently ridden by Oorrigan, won very easily at tbe last from Malatto and the others. As was generally anticipated tbe Maiden Steeple chase resulted in a match between Great Western and Ooliingwood, who ran neek and neck nearly all the way, but the first-named had always a little tbe best of it, and beat Ooliing wood eomewhat earily at the finish. There were eleven starters for the Hardle Baoe, bat Sir Peter9* friends were so confident about his chanoes that he almost tonohed even money when he left the saddling paddock, Young Alfred and Diecoout also receiving a fair share of support. A magnificent race ensued, but Cumberland and Sir Peter were tbe only two in it a quarter of a mile from home, and tbe last named finishing with great determination, he just beat Cumberland by a neck. Sir Peter9* victory was received with eheers. and as this was Gorrigan9s third successive victory it made the baokera of Twilight very confident about her chance for tbe Grand National Steeplechase, Busies, however, coming in for a deal of enpport / at tbe last. There tpere seven starter*, bat half a mile from home Twilight, Gazelle, and Sussex were the only three Id it, which was lessened by Gazelle falling at the last fenoe. The finish between Sussex Bud Twilight was a mostezclting one; bat Mr. Goyder's horse oame home as only a thoroughbred oan, and won very cleverly amidst tbe cheers of the onlookers. The cheers were renewed after Sussex was declared , "weight," and Mr Uoyder has every reason to be proud of his horse, which, it will doabtless be observed, was giving some of the ! competitors . no' less thsn 43 ib. A sad accident occurred in the Selling Bardie Race, aa Monitor feil before they had gone three-quarters of a mile, and it waa subsequently ascertained that his rider—tbe English jookey Barlow—had sustained a compound fracture of hie right leg. The unfortunate lad was removed into the casualty-room as soon as possible, and was subsequently taken to the Melbourne Hospital, where he ia I ov doing ea well as can be expeoted under the oiromnstanee*. Presi dent, Zephyr, Monitor, and Nimrod were each supported for tbe race; and the first- named eventually won comfortably from Alb.vn, bat as Mr. Jelleit had to pay no leas than £310—£260 above tbe entered celling price—for the privilege of baying bim In, tbe victory was not by any means a very profitable one tor him. Fifteen horses came to the Handicap Flat Race, bat it was partly spoiled by a bad start; and Wood lands, who went out at a very long prise, won very easily at the last in the extraordinary time, if it be correct, of 1 min. 43 sec.

Passing the Btand Dhurrin* gile held a trifling advantage of Bheana, with Oyclopa, Sir Peter, Dieoonnt, Yonng Alfred, and Mulatto coming next in a cluster, but after they rounded the turn Cumberland came ont from the field, and led Dbnrrlngile six lengths along the back cf the course, Sir Peter, Oyclopa, Bheana, and Dlsoonnt being the most coDBplououa of the others.

Twilight and Lncy were almost together as they oaine to the Stand obstacles, whioh all took in due style, but at tbe tog fence—tbe last of the 8tund jumps— Gazelle beaded Twilight, Lucy and Sussex being well np. Twilight, however, was again in front of Lucy at tbe next feuoe, and as they sailed past the railway bridge he was abont a length in front of Lnoy, Sussex by this time having gone np third and Gazelle fourth.
