Sweet Peas and Flies. The “ Scientific American, quoting from tho “ Louisville Journal,” gives the following. The accuracy of the statement can be tested by tlioso of our readers who grow sweet peas and aro troubled witli (lies :■ “ ‘ Como inside a minute,’ said a Eourth Avenue dealor in pianos, yostor ,day afternoon. * X have discovorod tho greatest fly trap on earth and I want to bUow it to you.’ He led tho way to an instrument nt tho rear of the store on which was a nowspaper. On tho paper had been placed a bunch of Bweot peas. At least a thousand dead Hies wore lying on tho pnper in tho immediate vicinity ot tlio bunch of flowers. ‘ X throw thoso hero by chance,’ he con tinued, 1 and in about ten minutes I noticed that every fly that alighted on tho flowers died in a very short time.’ Even ns ho spoke a number of the insects which iind stopped to suck tho deadly sweet had toppled over dead. They alighted with their usual buzz, stopped momentarily, quivered in their legs, flapped their wings weakly several times, and thou gave up tho ghost.”
