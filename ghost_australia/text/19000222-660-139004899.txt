ONE ON '.THE ' JUDGE.' Rny Bean, the high judge of the courts of Langtry, where justice is dished out to the living and dead alike in Judge Bean's own novel and distinctive way, was in San An tonio last week, on the occasion of which viBit he was made the victim of a cruel practical joke, sayB the San Antonio ' Ex press.' He met a drummer at the hotel, who Baid he had just come from Lanatry. ' Did you see my bear ? How is he getting along ?' was the justice's first question. Judge Bean's bear throughout West Texas Btands second in fame to the judge himself. The animal was chained to a tree in the rear of the judge's beer saloon, and in its day drank many a bottle of beer at a cost of 25c per bottle, to the edification of the wayfarer who was compelled to Bpend a few hours in Judge Bean's judicial district. ' Didn't you hear of it ?' asked tho drum mer. ' The bear died last night.' The dununer had an old score to wipe out at Roy Bean's expense, and he succeeded in convincing the judge that his bear wns dead. Roy Bean ' lost no time in making for the telegraph office, where he penned these in structions: ' Skin the bear, and express the skin to me at once.' ' ' To this he attached his signature, which is the law in Langtry. Bean's man at the saloon promptly killed the bear and expressed the skin,' and in the letter that- accompanied the fur was this note: ' We hated to kill the bear, and he hated to die. It took three sliota before he gave up tho ghost. Weare now smoking the bacons.' When Roy Bean received the message he broke three chairs and then set out in quest of the drummer. The offender is said to be conducting earnest diplomatic negotiations by mail with - The Law of West Texas.'
