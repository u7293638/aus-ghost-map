THE TROUBLES OF GRAHAM BERRY With grief is Berry overwhelmed, Lest, now his mission's ended, Some prying fellow should demand How Graham has expended, Those nounds. five thousand, that he tnolc For travelling expenses ; And all clean gone upon a scheme, Resembling false pretences. And many do insinuate That Berry's nest is feathered, And that he made his fortune when Black Wednesday's storm was weathered; In that dark day he still exults, And would not have it undone, As his reward he'll represent Victoria in London ? His rest is much disturbed of late — Though that fact doesn't pain us — In dreams and visions he beholds The ghost of Africanus. Affrighted he starts up in bed, For aid to Pearson shrieking, And cries, " The demon for my crimes Is vengeance on me wreaking." Another ghost appeared to him And asked with threatening action, A full return of billets filled By Berry and his faction. For of retrenchment such as this, One fails to see the beauty — To sack a man and then appoint Two men to do his duty. And then he sees dame Telegraph Armed with an umbereller, And standing o'er him prostrate, cry " You skulking lying feller, You say the Press is subsidized, You shall retract that, mark us ; Produce that squatter or we'll break Each bone inside your carcase." Last scene of all, he hears a judge Reproving him severely, For making public statements from Imagination merely. And Berry then with piteous tones, And manner penitential, Promised he would amend his life In every way essential.
