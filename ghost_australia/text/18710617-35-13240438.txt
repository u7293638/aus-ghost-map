public house system An impression prevals among the reputable sections of the British public that new laws are necessary to check drunkenness, which entails enormous calamities Evidently Engliind has passed beyond the stage of doubt and armed at full conviction in reference to the evil to be abated "With cieiy deduction fiom the \aluc of si ttistics on moral questions, there renmns a tremendous

many persons who think the species of monopoly which has ansen out of this special legislation tends more to encourage drunkenness than to prevent it It is cudeni that those who hold this opinion must wait years before it will be ndopttd bj the nation It is highly possible that if drunkenness were to decline, and the consumption of alcoholic drinks to become as limited as other aiticles of subsistence, that free trade would become the rule, and ob struction the exception At present, howevei, the prevention of drunkenness is sought V\ the regulation of public houses, and to dimmish their

We doubt however if any measure will become law in the present state of parties Tins lias bien described f. s the age of great cities ; and nc\er before in the lnsloiy of the world was the influence of great cities 60 marked on all that affects the social, intellec- tual, and political movements of mankind The development of manufacturing; industries and the gi cat impiovements in machiner) liare done much to intensify this agglomeration of men into great masses, and the phenomenon, u to be traced not only in the old world, but in America, and even in the colonies In England one-half of the popuhtion is stated now to be gathered into great towns, in America the giowth of gi cat inland cilio» like Chicago has been moie marked than the spiead of population ovei the country. Our own recent Census has shown that the mci ease during the last ten j ears has been pioportionatelr more metropolitan than niral, and the same lesult has been displayed by the Census m Victoiia. In the Middle Ages the cities laid the found- ation of liberty and commerce. They clustered together for some mutual protection against feudal tyrannies, and the burgess class de- veloped itself as a potent element in society. Modern manufacturing industry has in a similar way given a special development to the artisan class. Craftsmen have been gathered together in huge numbers. Their special class interests, as opposed to those of their employers, have been strongly defined. Their opportunities for discussing their own interests have been ample, and a special political philosophy has grown up out of their consideration of social question from their one particular point of view—a philosophy which is finding its practical deve- lopment in the regulations of trades unions. In France, where thinkers are more logical than in England, more daring in carrying out abstract theories to their ultimate issues, more unrestrained by any consideration of consequences, more accustomed to re- volutionary processes, more fascinated by the ideal, and more careless of the inter- mediate sufferings endured in the chase after that ideal, the philosophy of society studied from the labour point of view has been most completely developed; and it is one of the results of that development that the world is now witnessing in the insurrection in Paris. It was as the guardian of France against the spectre rouge that NAPOLEON THE THIRD claimed the sup- port of the country, and that the spectre was not altogether the ghost of the imagination has now been sufficiently demonstrated. A power that could hold the metropolis in de- fiance of a majority of the citizens, and in defiance of the national Government, forced to encamp outside the walls, is certainly a very solid entity. For twenty years NAPOLEON has kept the socialist element tolerably quiet, but he has not kept it from growing, The Paris improvements and the rapid prosperity of the city have increased the numbers of workmen collected together, and they have become deeply imbued with socialist theories, and the suspension for a moment of the supremacy of a strong Government gave them an opportunity of making a dash at the possession of power. In France, says M Micheley in a recent publication, there are two classes—the peasant and the artisan. In England there is not the same contradistinction of classes, since the peasantry are the lowest class of wage-getters, and politically count for nothing. The artisans there find themselves in con flict not with a mass of small freeholders, but with an aristocracy and a middle-class. Uni versal suffrage in France gives an enormous voting power to the peasantry, which owns as well as tills the soil By the votes of this class, combined with those of the bourgeoisie, Napoleon the Third was elected. The artisans resent this despotism and clamour loudly for their emancipation from this thraldom. Why should the towns, they say, be governed by the country ? The towns are the centres of light. It is there that political education is most advanced and that ideas are most freely developed. Why should the progress of which they are the heralds and the pioneers be arrested by the votes of a peasantry sunk in ignorance and enslaved by priestcraft ? Let it not be thought that this is a pecu lairly French idea, for precisely the same doctrine was developed, and very unhesitat ingly propounded in England during the discussions on the late Reform Bill The politicians of the Manchester school advocated such a reduction of the franchise as would em brace the artisan class of the great towns, and yet would leave out the agricultural peasantry, and they did so distinctly on the ground that tho artisans were sufficiently educated in politics to assist in wise govern- ment while the peasantry were under the thumb of the squire and the clergyman The theoretical equality of universal suffrage had no charm in their eyes compared with the practical disadvantages of neutralising the educated by the unedu- cated vote. The tactics of Mr DISRAELI consisted in meeting the liberalism of this school by what had at least the appearance of a larger liberalism It was his task to con- vince the Conservatives that the only way to circumvent their opponents was to go beyond them, and by giving household suffrage to secure a county representation that would balance that of the boroughs The Communists in France, finding tint they are in a numerical minority, anxious to realise their own ideas, and impatient or distrustful of the process of converting the majority to their views, clamour for a town government distinct from a rural one They not only ask that Paris shall be entirely self governed, and free to develope its own specialities, but that all the great towns shall have sim- ilar rights, and the idea has been further suggested of a league among all the great towns to work together as so many little free republics to develop the doctrine of the organisation of labour The more enthu siastic go further, and propose that the towns should not only govern themselves, but should also govern the country, compelling tho reluc tant peasantry to obey, if they cannot be made to love, the evangel of FOURIER. The enthusiasts of this modern faith overlook the fact that even in towns their disciples are not in a majority, of which the exodus from Paris of all who could get away is a sufficient proof But that is a fact which does not seem to distress the modern apostles In America the little sects, so vigorously described by Mr HEPWORTH DIXON in his " New America," which are working out the socialist problems, are content to plant new settlements in the country, and to begin everything de novo on the basis of their own labour and the great Mormon settlement has done the same But in France the Socialists prefer to commence their work in a great capital full of the collected wealth of a great nation It is more convenient to make requisitions than to collect new wealth by painful industry, and those whose cardinal doctrine is that " property is theft ' inaugurate their reign by a series of enormous confiscations Theorists are not always very consistent when they undertake to reduce their own ideas to practice DISTKICT COUJÍT -Business for Monday, the lOlh insliint Causis lull) t and anotliT v Musson, TiWo v livrne, Kelly v Bunts, lhompson v I Ilia and wife, Coates v Anderson, Mulet v Dun, Minty v.
