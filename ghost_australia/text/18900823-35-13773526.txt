I HENRIK IBSEN. 1 -e- I I LECTURE BY MR. CHARRINGTON. Yesterday afternoon at the School of Arts Mr Charles Charrington lectured on " Henrik Ibsen " before an appreciative audience The stage sins tastefully arranged, and gave a pleasing effect. Mr Durrington, in handling his subject, showed intense love for Ibsen and enthusiastic appreciation of his work He lamented his want of capacity to do justice to the pool-dramatist, but said that a great man taken up in all) was good company Itnonhodoscnbod as the strong, musical world since the nineteenth century Shako npOHro, a man of supreme intellect His was the voice that gave no clear note in the buzz around us All that he had won I ton was what he had lived through himself Mr Cherrington, after briefly outlining lb sen's life, a ferring to his appointment as director of the National Ihoalrnat Bergen by Ole Bull, and Ihoeffiot lins had in perfecting his stagecraft, proceeded to give a port of configuration of hisputin-plny "Brand" (166) This was described in his central and most important stock, and plant from which he gained European fame Brand was the prophet of the ideal, the story was of a hero who unflinchingly followed his own ideals Ibsen in "Brand" might be called the poet of woman. Mr Charrington delivered with line I feel none of Brand's savings, such an "Room to keep oneself inviolable is surely a lawful desire," or There is no greater Vic for) than defeat, " organs whotonogivoÂ» up belongs to us eternally , " or again, the dying speech, " told me, God, is not for sale allow man's will enough r" "Import and Galilean" and "Pear Gmt" were touched on Au emphatic protest was entered against the ship ment that Ibsen was dull and didactic, but a passing reference was made to Mr Robert Hills by an adverse criticism of "A Gollin H mine " Only nine of Ibsen's plays have been translated into English His life is divided into four periods, in the last of which come his modern prose dramas In discussing those, the lecturer said that "An coming tboPooplo" was his favourite pin). He remarked that in The Wild Duck" the moral was not that stated L) Mr Havelock Ellis or Mr William Archer, but "that it is one's own ideal, not onotLor's, that must guidons" "ft jib regard to furl nor productions Mr Chamnglon said, " I hope soon to produce another play of lion's 'A Lud) far as the Son'", and added parenthetically, "it is one that ends happily) " The lecturer pointed out that the essential difference between Ibsen and others is that in Ibsen shines the light of the future, while all others more) reflect a radiance that is passing. He then concluded his thoughtful and brilliant address- with the following reference to the poet play " lined " - If you over have to epitomise a world poem, written in a language which you don't know, you will feel for me Although I have misled out long discussions between Brand and the Mng strain, between the Dean and the Matislrili between the best n and Ihn Schoolmaster, between Einar-who returns as a sound missionary - and Brand,! but of taken so long over it that I shall i bus to leave his first union world poem "Peer Gynt," alone altogether I'm almost sorry I did give the preference to "Peer" He is a lighter, more fantastic, figure flinn 1 Find," n id would perhaps have been more acceptable told you is a tale He, too, claims the right to be himself Completed)," but reads the command in a different spirit, and fo ends in being nothing rhoovetilsb) which he arrives at this result are more varied, the east is longer, the action brisker, but after all, an he typifies the Norwegian nation, he is in the first place more local, and therefore, as I have said, perhaps of less laden st lo us "Peer" was written the year after "Brand," and in the following roar when Ibsen was on, in the prime of his manhood, he published his first in flour prose drama, "The League of "Youth" This, like the ' Comedy of live," is a transition play, for after writing it Ibsen returned to his Emperor and Galilean," which he gnvototho world in 1873 Itisovsit work, in two parts of five acres each, and deals with the history of Indian, nicknamed the A pass- trate One is reminded a little of Oarljlo'n " I Friedrich " in considering this colossal work. Ibsen haschisch his subject, and will not give it up He works through it with enormous industry and untiring genius but all along one feels that he is not in his most (essential element This, is I must leave on one side to night, for 1 want a few minutes to speak of the modern dramas " The League of Youth " is, as 1 paid, a transitional play unit is the most conventional, perhaps the weakest of Ibsen's modern works "It was produced," sovs william Archer, at the Chrlalianis Ihenlro mind is plant at riotous scene of protest the second and third representations were equally) stormy, but before long (he pig) was re gained as one of the classics of the Scandinavian stage and when Ibsen, in 1871, paid his first visit to Norway, since his Ilogiro 10 years earlier, he was present at the representation of " The 1 league of youth," and was received with wild enthusiasm. Now we come to his entire) modern plays, on! in speaking about them I should like to record one or two protests against the way they have been received in some quarters Snd 1 appeal to the peo. To who feel called upon to mention his great name for their own sales to do so with becoming reverence Ibsen, like Brand, held on the denial lies ' free of Thought" has its roots deep down in the heart of nature, and when men think of any branch of this tree is Express, likely to wither from mere want of vitality, which I take to be the destiny of fads They are saving a manifestly untrue and unworthy thing It in not for Ibsen's sake 1 speak he will not answer them, he doesn't even hear they are quite safe SS o revile and bound him, surely Hill Is unworthy.
