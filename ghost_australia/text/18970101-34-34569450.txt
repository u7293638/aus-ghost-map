ENGLISH SPORTING NOTES. [From our Special Correspondent.] London, October 23,1896. Wednesday was one of the most miserable, Cesarewitch anniversaries on record. The rain poured down in torrents, a biting wind chilled visitors to the marrow, and the course was a quagmire. Nevertheless the Westralian set rolled up in goodly numbers to see Cliit-Ctiat i win, aud there appeared any amuunt of money J beliind Mr. Albert Calvert's gelding. Of the 15 runners Sir.

Low's St Bris (3 yrs., Gst 0 lb.), and ouwide prices the rest The ground of course was enormously in favor of the lightweights, and in the result the first seven,' barring Laodamia. (who is a notorious mud lark), belong to the 0 st division. Kingsclere does not often prove formidable in the big handicaps, and consequently only a select few believed the rumor that St Bris was a real good thing. The few, however, included the Prince of Wales and his friends, who were large winners by the result THE CKS-IHEWITCH STAKES. A handicap of 25 soys. each, with .TOO soys. added; the second horse to receive 200 soys., and the third 100 soys. out of the stakes. Cesarewitch course (two miles two furlongs and 35 yards). Mr. W.

Bettingâ€”ll to 4 against Laodamia, 11 to 2 Chit Chat, 100 to 15 Count Schomberg, 10 to 1 each St Bris and Alexins, 100 to G each Van guard, Piety, and Phtebus Apollo, 20 to 1 each Nouveau Riche and Son o' Mine, 25 to 1 Soli man, 40 to 1 each Cypria and The Corsican, 50 to 1 Lady Normanton, and 100 to 1 Fusilade. The race was run in pouring rain, and little more than the finish could be seen even with the best glasses. One heard that Alejrina made running early, but when the field strag gled into view she had disappeared, and only Chit-Chat, Laodamia, St Bris, and Count Schomberg had the ghost of a show. The latter " cracked " at the bashes and almost im mediately cries of "10 toT bar St Bris" rent the ring. Little Cannon was sitting steady as a rock, whereas Bobinson and Hunt were both uneasy. Cbit-Chat now led, but 'twas obviously on sufferance, and Hunt tried in vain to rouse the tired Laodamia. In the Abingdon Mile bottom St Bris shot to the front, and leaving the others as though stand ing still won in a canter by five lengths from Chit-Chat, who finished a neck in front of the favorite.
