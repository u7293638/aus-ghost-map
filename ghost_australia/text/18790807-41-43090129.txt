THK TJTTEETOF EDINBUKGH'S ' BIRTHDAY. Tbe anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgbs Biithdsy (Wednesday, August 6) was observed as a general holiday throughout tbe country. The weather in town was gloriously fine— being in every respect sucn as gjaaueus w i-wirm ui those who love to seize the opportunity afforded by the somewhat frequent occurrence of our colonial f.'ic days to enjoy themselves in the open air. Had the 'Clerk' who is supposed to regulate the blowing of tbe wind and the falling of the rain be«n consulted by holiday-makers on the subject he conld not have complied with their wishes more completely. There were not so many means of relaxation provided, however, as are generally presented on these anniver sariee, the Exhibition Building grounds, for a wonder, remining in their work-day quietness. The principal attraction was the military sports on the Cval, which were largely attended, the Newmarket Races, on the Morphettville Course, bcicg the only othor public amusement. The Botanic Gardens, which have now a beautifully fresh appearance, had a large number of visitors in the afternoon. In the evening, in addition to the ordinary representation of Jane Shore's woes at the Theatre Eojal acd of the ghost's vagaries at White's Rooms, an entertainment was given at the Town Hall, and a military ball was held at the Town Hall.
