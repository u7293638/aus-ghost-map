These gradually lose their bright ness by cooling, and become absorbed into the vaporous mass. The spot then assumes a regular form, and a calm succeds the period of eruption. In time the clouds are dissipated, and the spot consequently disappears. The learned astronomer sums up his conclusions as to the physical constitution of the sun by saying that lie considers it to be a fluid incandescent mass surrounded by a highly luminous envelope above which there is a second atmosphere of Ies3 density. This latter,, he believes, consists of metallic vapours combined with hydrogen gas. To it he has given the name of chromo sphere. He refers the phenomenon of \\*he so-called corona visible during : Alipses to the presence of this outer atmosphere. While some of his conclu sions and observations require confirma tion, Father Secchi has undoubtedly accomplished a great and important work, and one which must form the basis «-f any future labours in the same direc tion. ^« _— — — — — Telegraphic Business lx 1870. — Through the courtesy of the Postmaster -itner.il and Superintendent of Telegraphs we are enabled to publish to-day some in teresting statistics relating to the tele graphic business of the year. It woxild be impossible to give the exact figures in each case so soon after the close of the twelve months, and hence the busi ness for the last two or three days «f the year has been estimated upon the basis of the previous work. The number of local messages transmitted, including those between Adelaide and Port Darwin and intermediate stations, is given at 2!)2,7i-8, while of intercolonial despatches there were 75,479, giving a total of 308,207. On referring to the statistics of the two preceding years, we tind that in 1S74 the number of messages -*n the local and intercolonial lines was i'58,442 and in 1875 315,342. The amount of cash received in the colony in 1870 was £20,117 6s. Id. The number of cable messages trans mitted by South Australia was 499, and 41KS were received. The gross number of cable messages forwarded ty all the colonies was 2,983, and 3,386 were received, the total number trans mitted being, owing to interruptions r *o the communication, 3,340 less than in 1875. The value of the received traffic is put down at £30,978 4s. od., and of that forwarded £38,417 10s. lOd. The South Australian proportion of the international business amounted to £8,829 128. 4d. It should be mentioned that the Penang and Madras cable was interrupted from March 28 to November :j0, and that the Port Darwin and Ban joewangie cable was silent from April 24 to August 6. The result was of course a serious interference with the international business, besides the reduction of the receipts on our Transcontinental line. The falling oft' on our revenue from this source as compared with last year is about i.').000. ♦ The Eastern Question. — It will be seen by the telegrams which we publish elsewhere that the Great Powers have taken a determined position with the Stillan. That monarch and his Ministers seem to have shown a marked disincli nation to yield to the advice of the assembled plenipotentiaries. At least matters must have approached almost to a crisis before an intimation was given to the Governent at Constantinople that if the proposals of the Conference were not acceded to the Powers would withdraw their ambassadors. This threat has in some measure brought the Sultan to his .senses, as a later telegram states that he is not absolutely prepared to reject the pro posals of the Conference. He is deter mined, hoivever, to obtain better terms if he can, and will, it is said, bring forward proposals of his own. Unless these are very different from his former offers their rejection may be regarded as a foregone conclusion. Although the present aspect of affairs is far from being satisfactory, we sincerely trust tliat an appeal to arni3 will yet be averted. New Year's Day. — This being New Year's Pay it will be observed as :i public holiday. The principal advertised amusements are the South Australian Jockey Club Races at the Morphett ville Course; the Foresters' Picnic at the Exhi bition Grounds; the trip of the steamer Euro t«- Edithburgh, chartered tor that purpose by the J^outh Adelaide Cricket Club; cricket match ou the Oval between a first eleven of the Association and tweuty-two juniors: cricket match on the Noith Park Lauds between the Gawler and ,' .Register Clubs; Dr. Silvester's entertainment at the Theatre Royal; the Lo-Lo combination com pany at 'White's Room; and the Lynch Family of Bellringers in the Town HalL Several races are also advertised to take place in the country districts. Tire Telegraph Office*. — To-day, Jauuary 1,* being a public holiday, all the Telegraph Offices in South Australia will be closed, except between the hours of 9 and 10 a.m. aud 6' and 8 \\-.m. Ocr Xew GovEU-fOR.--\Ve hear that Mr. W. 'W. Cairns, the newly-appointed Governor of South Australia, will not arrive in Adelaide as Mion as was expected. Owiug partly to the fact that he has not yet received his uew commission, and partly to the delay iu the arrival of hi* successor, he is not likely to arrive much before the end of February. As Sir Anthony Mus grave will leave for his new seat of government «m January 27, it will be necessary to swear iu His Honor the Chief Justice as Actiug i-ioveruor. Mr. R. C. Patthuson-.— This gentleman, who it will be known, holds the position of Chief Assis tant Engineer, aud who has been away ou leave of absence, arrived iu Melbourne from England )-y the Sobraon on Thursday. He will return to Adelaide by an early steamer. We learn that the last letters received from Mr. Patterson gave the gratifying intelligence that his health was completely restored. New Year's Dat Race?.— His Excellency the Governor and Lady Musgrave have signified their intention to occupy the viceregal box iu the Grand Stand to-day. Jockey Clcb BIidscmmeb Racks.— Thesa races take place to-day ou the Morphettville Course. The Governor and Lady Qlmvrave will he present A programme and anticipations regarding the meeting will be found in another column. Forestees' PifXic. — The picnic to be held to day at the Exhibition grounds in behalf of the 'Widow and Orphan Fund of the A.O.F. promises to be a great success. The principal prizes will be a handsome silver cup, presented ty His 'Worship the Mayor of Adelaide, and two others of £5 each. A large number of toys are to be presented gratuitously to the children. CHn.DUEx's Hospital.— It will be seen by advertisement that an entertainment iu aid of this excellent object is to be given at White's .Rooms on Thursday evening next, under the patronage of His Excellency the Governor and J-ady Musgrave, by members of the Register staff and several well-known amateurs. The programme will consist of scenes from ' Hamlet,'' and also Byron's pretty burlesque, iL Aladdin, or the Wonderful Scamp,' which has been amu singly localized for the occasion. Astronomical. — The average period from one quarter of the moon to the next is about seven days nine hours. It occasionally happens, however, that the moon changes her phase twice in one week. Thus during the present week the moon was full yesterday (Sunday) at 7h. J3m. a.m., and the last quarter will commeuce on Saturday next, at llh. 31 p.m. This is the more remarkable from the. circumstance that these two phases occur in the same week, tut net iu the sanift year. The SEJiArHORE KArLWAT. — The inhabitants { cf Glanville and neighbourhood have, we believe, j represented to the Commissioner of Public Works that danger is likely to arise by taking the Semaphore Railway along the main road to the beach, and it has been suggested that a curve to the west of the proposed line should be adopted. In order to judge of the matter for himself Mr. Colton intends to visit the district on Tuesday with the Engineer-iu- Chief, and he will endeavour to arrive at a decision upon the subject as soon as possible. As the material for the Port Bridge is now on the way to the colony it is important that the line should be con structed with as much speed as is practicable. We understand tliat the party will proceed to Port Adelaide by the 11.30 train on Tuesday. The Accident at Port Adekaidk. — The City Coroner held an inquest on Saturday after noon, December 30, upon the body of Patrick O'Rourke, who died that morning at the Port Casualty Hospital. The Jury decided that the deceased died from concussion of the brain, caused by a fall from the flagstaff of the Club House Hotel. Death of Mr. James Galloway.— This old colonist died at Morphett Vale on Friday last, December 29, after a long illness, by which he was incapacitated for business for several months. The deceased lived in the district of Morphett Vale for many years, first as a farmer, and then as a miller and grain dealer in partner ship with Mr. James Clark, of Noarlunga. He was one of the pioneers of Port Pirie, where he erected one of the first wluirfs at that rising place. Besides holding the office of District Councillor on. several occasions, he took an active share in public matters, and had for some years been a Justice of the Peace. He leaves a widow and a family of three sons, who form the company of Galloway & Sons, Port Pirie, and two daughters, one of whom is the wife of Captain Dalziel, of Port Adelaide. Fihe Decorator's Work. — The shop front of Mr. H. L. Vosz, in Rundle-street, which has recently been altered and renovated, now pre sents the most striking example of house decorator's work in the city. The signboard, to make a pardonable bull, is comprised of thick plate-glass, behind which the name of the firm is emblazoned in highly ornate gold letters, re lieved by a deep background in imitation of malachite, which stone is admirably copied. The cornice above is of serpentine, and the pilasters on either side have been altered into columns with white gilded capitals, the body being beautifully painted in close imitation of 'Broccodalla and Vertlantique marble. In the panelling, too, extra care has been taken, the panels themselves looking like the best bastard, pollard oak with wainscot stiles and rails. In the centre of the shutters on each window a large garter is painted filled in with writing signifying the business carried on within. The whole front is an ornament to that portion of the street, and a credit both to the designer and painter. A Novelty in Billiards. — Billiard amateurs are to be treated to another wonder in this wonderful game. They have had an oppor tunity of witnessing the play of the best player in the world at the ordinary English game. To-night they will be introduced to his young brother, Herbert Roberts, whose speciality is ' hand stroke billiards,' that is billiards played by giving the impulse to the playing ball with the thumb and finger instead of the cue. Mr. Herbert Roberts arrived in Victoria by the Kent on her first voyage two or three weeks ago, and came from Melbourne with his brother. He remains in Adelaide for a few days to give exhibitions of his dexterity in this new way to play the old game, making his first public appearance iu Australia this evening at the Globe Saloon. We understand that in addition to the ordinary play Mr. Herbert Roberts shows a number of extraordinary fancy strokes, which, judging from the published list, must be some thing in the same style as those displayed by M. Carme. The Narracoorte Railway. — Various com plications, including the change of Governors and the contemplated visit of some of the Ministers to attend the Cable Conference in Sydney, have prevented the exact date for the opening of the Narracoorte Railway being fixed. We understand, however, that it is likely to take place about the middle of February. We learn that the Government do not intend to convey the whole of the members of Par liament to the scene of the opening ceremonies. It is probable thatr the Governor Musgrave, steamer, will be employed to take a representa tive party, consisting of members of the Ministry, the President of the Legislative Council, the Speaker aud Chairman of the House of Assembly, the members for the two South-Eastern Districts, and possibly one or two other gentlemen. Guo-elq New Wkslbyan Church.— On Sunday, December 31, the opening services in this church were conducted in the morning by the Rev. S. Knight, iu the afternoon by Mr. J. D. Bone, and in the eveniusr by the Rev. C. Lane, who preached to large and attentive congregations. At 11 o'clock a watch night service was begun, which continued until the uew year had been ushered iu. Ou 'Wed- nesday, January 3, a tea and public meeting in connection with the same church will be held at the Glenelg Lecture Hall, when a number of well-known gentlemen will take part iu the proceedings. Theatre Royal.— The Fakir of Oolu and his company gave two very good performances on Saturday, December 30. That in the afteruoou was attended by children and people from the country, aud the pantomime went dowu well with the former. The attendance iu the evening was moderate, but the warmth of the weather had no doubt a good deal to do with keeping people away and pre venting a much larger number being present. The bill included some very good items, which were well given, and wound up with the beau tiful fairy fountain. To-night is the last of the season, and we have no doubt that with more favourable weather there will be a good house. The Theatre will be closed ou Tuesday night, so that arrangements may be made for Dr. Silvester's benefit, which takes place on Wed nesday. White's Rooms. — The Lo-Lo Company had a moderate house on Saturday evening, wheu the programme of the previous night was repeated. The sensational feats of Lo-Lo and the De Glorious and the efforts of Messrs. Margetts, Vivian, and Israel, aud Misses Nordt and Grey were appreciatively received. A number of presents were distributed to holders of lucky tickets. This evening, in addition to the tea service and other gifts, Lo-Lo will present to the winner of the Selling Hurdle Race a hand some aud novel inkstand. The article is com posed of half of an emu's egg set in silver, surmounted with a quandong stone, also set in silver, aud is appropriately supported on three silver horseshoes. It was manufactured and designed by Mr. fitters, a working silversmith, and is well worthy of inspection. Doubtless the troupe will have a good house for a wind-up to the season. Presentation.— Ou Saturday, December 23, a pleasing ceremony took place in connection with Messrs. D. & W. Murray's Clothing Fac tory, the employes presenting Mr. R. Threlfall, the Manager, with a large aud well-executed likeness of his wife in oil colours, from the studio of Mr. Solomon, Bundle-street. The employes assembled in the reading-room pro vided by the firm for their factories, and after singing Mr. Tester, who was voted to the chair, said they were called together to testify to the esteem and respect their Manager w.is held iu, aud to present him with the eighth token of that esteem and respect. He spoke lengthily of the good that had been doue by the firm in connection with their factories, and, iu conclusion, wished Mr. Threlfall a merry Christmas aud a happy New Year. He then called on Miss Potter, who said she made the gift in the name of all hands. She hoped Mr. Threlfall would appreciate it, and that it would he a pleasure to him, to Mrs. Threlfall, and to their children. (Cheers.) filr. Threlfall, on rising, was greeted with applause. He said he hardly knew how to thank them for their valuable gift, for it was one he should highly prize as long as he lived. He gave a brief retinue oi the years transactions, and showed that an astounding amount of work had been ?lone considering the short time the factory had been in existence. He said he was glad to see them all looking so happy, and hoped they would continue so. It had always been his endeavour to make the work profitable to the firm and pleasant to the employes, and it was a source of satisfaction to him to be able to say that ho had never had occasion to send one single hand away for loose conduct, which was. a great credit' to the whole establishment. (Cheers.) Mr. Threlfall concluded by wishing them all prosperity. Songs and choruses diver- . s-ified the proceedings. Thr Lynch Family. — The entertainment given by this talented family is certainly deserving cf a far larger audience than that with which it was favoured on Saturday evening, though doubtless the sfcit-e of the wtather materially affected the attendance, as the performers are too well known in Adelaide for the public to require to be informed of their ability. On Saturday night there was a change of programme. In place of 'The Death of Kelson' and 'The anchors weighed,' Mr. Vtrten rendered the two popular songs, '* Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee^ and ' Then you'll remember me' — both of which were appreciatively received, and were admirably sung. Mr. Verten, how ever, Appears to excel most as a dancer. His champion sailor's hornpipe was almost faultless. The skill displayed in campanology by the members of the Lynch family, but particularly Mr. Lynch, sen., and Mr. H. Lynch, was such as to elicit the frequent and unrestrained plaudits of the auditors at the conclusion of every piece. Perhaps the best rendered was the duet 'Home, sweet home,' played by the Messrs. H. Lynch, sen., and jun., which met with universal approbation. The following, however, may be selected as particularly suc cessful, ' Still so gently' (from Sonnambula), ' Tramp, tramp, tramp,' The girl I left behind me,' and ' The soldiers joy hornpipe,' all of which were played on the handbells. Three pieces were performed on the standbells, namely ' The Copenhagen Waltz,' ' We home ward fly,' and ' St. Patrick's Day.' In addition to this, the bill-of-fare was further extended by two comic pieces — 'The shoemaker family' and 'The hallelujah band'— both of which were irresistibly laughable, as was also the farce entitled ' Mr. Johnson in want of a coachman,' which terminated the entertainment. On Tues day evening the clever performance of the Lynch Family will be witnessed by His Excel lency the Governor and Lady Musgrave, when there will be an entirely new programme pre sented. Travelling in the Xorth-East. — Owing to the drought travelling in the North-Eastern District is just now attended with considerable danger. 'Three weeks ago,' remarks the Northern Mail of December 29, 'Mr. F. T. Jones, of Kooringa, left the Burra in company with Mr. W. Halliday, with a buggy and two horses, to visit some land of which he had recently purchased the lease, lying about l(i0 miles E.N.E. from the Burra, and adjoining the Mutooroo Run. The travellers were led to believe that when they reached the land they would find plenty of water in the dams, but to their dismay they found that they were all dry, and consequently attempted to return. On the ?way back they were overtaken by the very hot .weather of a fortnight back, and their water ran ! out. Halliday started to look for water, leaving his companion with the buggy aud horses, and with considerable difficulty obtained a supply of the desired element. On returning to the place where he had left the buggy he found the two horses dead and Jones absent. The latter was subsequently discovered by some fencers who were out hunting after bullocks, and taken to their camp. When found he was lying under a bush in the last stage of exhaustion, and had not timely aid arrived he would soon have been beyond all chance of recovery. It is rumoured that Halliday (who was very much knocked about) had started to a place where he had been fencing, near the scene of the catastrophe, to procure horses to return to the Burra ; and if this ia correct, and he was successful, the travellers will by this time be on their road home. A party started with a four-horse coach on Wednesday afternoon, under the pilotage of Mr. W. Watts, to fetch back Messrs. Jones and Halliday, and they will probably return at all events within a day or two.' Narrow Escape. — On Saturday afternoon (says the Northern Mail of December 29 last) Mr. J. Roach, jun., had a narrow escape from drowning in the Burra Creek, and Mr. E. W. Minchin in attempting to rescue him was also placed in considerable jeopardy. Mr. Roach was swimming his horse in the creek at the back of his father's mill, and getting into a deep hole was washed out of the saddle. He was unable to swim, and commenced to sink. Mr. Roach, sen., was on the bank, but being no swimmer was unable to render assistance ; he therefore called out, and attracted the at tention of Mr. Minchin, who was in a boat with Mr. Mackenzie a short distance off. The two rowed to the spot where Mr. Roach had disappeared, and seeing him just under water Mr. Minchin jumped overboard aud seized him by the arm. He was nearly uncon scious, but feeling the grip seized hold of his preserver and by some means got on his shoulder, forcing him under water. Mr. Min cliin's foot was entangled in a stump under the water, but he succeeded in getting Roach into shallow water, and then extricated himself and swam to the boat, but on reaching it he was so exhausted as to be unable to get aboard without first resting. Both are now all right, but Mr. Roach has reason to be thankful for his escape aud to congratulate himself upon the proximity of his preserver. The Late Fibk at Glanvillb. — Mr. C. D. Aston, the agent for the Britannia Insurance Company, miorins us unit ilou, tne amount oi the insurance of Mr. Jones's premises, which were destroyed by fire a short time ago, has been paid over. Colonial Defence. — His Excellency the Governor of Victoria, at the request of the Treasurer (writes the A rgit.-t), has sent by this mail a formal application to the Secretary of State for the Colonies to request the appoint ment of a permanent engineer officer of standing to undertake the duty of carrying out the works considered of primary importance for the defence of this colony. The salary of this officer will be borne by this Government. In accor dance with the recommendation of Commo dore Hoskins, application has been made for the appointment of two gunnery officers well acquainted with the latest improvements in tliat branch of military science. Their salaries will also be provided for here. Application has already been made by letter for the appoint ment of au engineer officer of eminence, who should visit the Australian Colonies for six or twelve moutlis, to devise a proper scheme of defence ; but in order that no time may be lost Sir George Bowen has sent a telegram to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the sub ject, mentioning that Sir William Jervois had been indicated as an officer admirably qualified to perform the duty, but that if his services were not available any officer possessing similar qualifications would be acceptable. The Aus tralian Colonies will combine in giving to such au officer liberal remuneration for the duty. A sum of £10,000 has been placed at the disposal of the Agent- General for the purpose of pro curing torpedoes and other material of defence which may be recommended by the engineer ofiicer to be permanently appointed. The name of Colonel Scratchley has been incidentally mentioned in connection with this appointment, but the home military authorities have been left quite untrammelled in their selection. The Late Fire at Mr. White's. — The Kapunda Herald states ' that the South Aus tralian Insurance Company has decided to pay the full amount for which Mr. White had pro posed to insure the stack of hay destroyed by the late fire. The Company does not admit that Mr. White had any legal claim upon it, but decided to make the full payment so as to support the honour of their representative, Mr. W. Lewis, J.P. (who has held the position for 19 years), he having stated that the stack should be regarded as insured.' The OPENtxd of London Bridge. — An iute resting memorandum in reference to the fes tivities at the opening of London Bridge, in 1S31, by their Majesties the King and Queeu, lias been handed to us by a gentleman related to the writer, who is now dead. It is in the form of a statement of the provisions at the fe&st; which was given by their Majesties, and is as fol lows :_' The plan and arrangement of the royal table embrace every delicacy the season can afford. The total of the supplies furnished by Mr. Leech are we understand as follows :— 370 dishes of chickens, 150 hams and tongues, 75 raised French pies, &c;, 75 pigeon pies, 40 sir loins of beef, 50 quarters of Iamb, 250 dishes of shellfish, &c;, 200 do. salads, cucumbers, &c;, i-00 fruit tarts, 200 jellies, creams, and straw berries, 350 lbs. weight of fine apples, 100 dishes of hothouse grapes, 100 do. nectarines, peaches, apricots, ic, 100 do. greengages, Orleans plumbs, &c;, 100 do. cmrants, gooseberries, raisins, kc, 150 ornamented Savoy cakes, 300 ice creams, ic, 300 turtles, roast chickens, .fee.' We have also been shown a medal struck in commemoration of the construction of the bridge. It bears a repre sentation of the bridge with many of the build ings of London in the iKickground. On top are the words ' carriage-way, 33 feet,' and below is the inscription— ' Length of bridge, 782 feet; centre arch, 130: side arch, 140.' On the other side are the words—' The first stone of the new London Bridge was laid by John Garratt, Esq., Lord Mayor of London, on the 14 of March, 1824, aud opened by their Majesties August. 1st, 1831.' Thb Anniverhaky and ovk Fioneek.«. — Mr. James Hoare, of Donnybrook, near Clare, one of the gradually diminishing band of pioneers who was present at the proclamation of the co'eny in 1836, informs us that he attended the aniiivtrsary festival at GleueJg on December 28, and intended making a speech. The arrange ments did not admit of his doing so, and he therefore sends us the substance of what he interded saying, -which we subjoin, as beiug likely to interest many of our readers: — ' I.adits and Gentlemen — If I were an orator — which I am not, either by nature or by educa tion ? I should like to be allowed to m*.ke a speech just now, for I feel my old blood mantling in my veins while I recall to memory the scenes of 40 ytars ago. Forty years ago, ladies and gentlemen, on a bright September morning — I think tr-i 10th — the good ship Cygnet, after a tomewhat lengthy voyage, discharged a hopeful band of adventurers upon this strand. Among them might have been seen in the full pride of vigorous young manhood Messrs. G. S. King ston, John Morphett, B. T. Finniss, and others who have since attained to most deserved dis tinction in your midst, together with men of humbler stamp who have uiade less figure in this little community — men among whom your humble servant counted one. AVell, ladies and gentlemen, as I said, I have no faculty for drawing pictures or for moralizing ; but my old heart fairly leaps within me while I contrast the then and now — the aspect of these shores and of our beloved South Australia at that time with that presented now. True, the natural features were the same. There was the same grand sweep of ocean and of shore — there were the same beautiful uplands and valleys — the same fertile plains av.d smiling glens; but where was this busy town with its massive jetty ? Where were the beautiful villas now dotting and ornamenting these shores ? Where were Adelaide and the Port with their teeming thousands ? and where were the inland towns ? Well, I'll leave these moralizings to abler hands than mine, and confine myself to humbler nights. I landed with the rest full of hope, but withal a little apprehensive, for I knew that the capabilities of the country were all untried. How, then, have the generous soil and balmy climate responded to our wishes ? Let the thousands upon thousands of smiling corn-fields answer that. Let the export mer chants of Port Adelaide and the other thriving out ports answer it. Let the thousands of happy independent homesteads scattered up and down through the length and breadth of the land reply to it. Let the mighty preparations that are being made by road and rail in every direc tion to carry the precious burdens to the sea answer it. Above all, let the thousands upon thousands of us working men — men who in the old country by our utmost efforts were liardly able to keep body and soul together, but who have here founded happy and prosperous homes — let us answer it ; and let us answer it with deep thankfulness to the Giver of all Good by admitting that our advent to this country was the advent to plenty, comfort, and prosperity such as we never knewat home,and such too as we would probably have never known elsewhere. In con clusion, I would say let this assembly answer it with one voice, by one tremendous cheer that shall make these shores respond to the honour of our beloved Queen Victoria and of her happy, he:tlth-giving, life-sustaining, bountiful, and blessed South Australia.' Vesuvius as a Bchial-place. — The writer of 'Specialities' iu the Queens-lander says: — 'If the extraordinary suggestion to utilize the crater of Mount Vesuvius as a general receptacle for the European dead should ever be carried out, some very curioTLs results may ensue which, in all probability, have not entered into the calculations of the originator of the notion. For instance, the animal material tilted into the fearful chasm will, of course, amalgamate with the boiling lava, to be again shot forth at the succeeding eruption. Of the lava, ornaments, such as brooches, bracelets, &c;, are made and sold in large quantities. Is it then an iiicon ceivable fortuity that you, madam, may yet unconsciously walk about with your grandfather hanging from your ears, the lover whom you lilted resting on your bosom, the husband you have forgotten clinging round your wrists ? Or should your unhappy relatives be ejected in amalgamation with pumice stone, is it too much to imagine you removing stains from your fingers with a lump of your uncle, or John iu the stable cleaning the harness with a cinder that was your aunt? Again, we ourselves having gone through the tourist experience of roasting eggs by volcanic heat, and of thrusting a stick through one of the many puffing aper tures in the vicinity of the crater, pulling it out in a state of ignition, and lighting a cigar therefrom — it seems to us to require no great stretch of imagination to picture a mourner of the future lighting his pipe from the combus tion of his father, or roasting eggs by the heat of fuel that once taught him his catechism. Moreover, we doubt if the patentee of the Vesuviau-mortuary-receptacle idea foresees that there is ' a heap o' trouble stickin' out o' this' for us Cis-equinoctials. As it seems to be a law of nature that the southern hemisphere follows in the wake of the northern, we will feel bound to take volcanic action in this matter too. It will become unfashionable to return to dust in the quiet old wormy way. Nothing short of volcanic cremation will satisfy the souls and bodies of the swell ish dead. But what are we to do for a volcano? Never fear. Our ruling passion of imitation will be found strong in death — aud burial. We venture to predict as certain that if it becomes the fashion in Europe to deposit the dead in volcano craters, we will have our volcano, even if we should have to import Cotopaxi : though for a good lively flare up article in permanent working order, we believe the Sandwich Islands could supply as neat a thing in mortuary cooking-ranges as the heart could desire. Suppose then we have our volcano ; and suppose we have a grand opening day ; and suppose the members of both Houses of Parliament are conveyed by special mortuary to the mouth of the crater, and unintentionally proceed to examine the interior. But here we force ourselves to pause. We have always beeu accused of optimism in our views of the future of our beloved country.' The Explosion at Ingle wood. — The corre-' spondent of the Bendigo Advertiser, writing with reference to the late serious oexplosion at Ingle wood, states that ' the powder was placed iu a de tached brick house in Mr. O'Donorans yard, and stored on a solid brick floor at one side of the room, and on the other side was placed a quantity of kerosiue. Over the powder were laid a number of pick handles, which afterwards went in a shower, not ouly over the town, but almost over the district, for some have been found on the Kingower-road. The origin of the fire is just as much a mystery as ever, but a theory has been started by Mr. Payne which certainly bears the impress of feasibility. His opinion is that the great heat of the weather caused gases to generate in the kerosiue-tins in the powder house, and probably one of them burst and set fire to things in the room, after which the explosion followed. If, in the opinion of the authorities, this is likely to be the cause of the fire, they should insist on kerosine being stored in cool cellars. The ex plosion itself was felt to a much greater dis tance than was at first imagined. People who were picnicing on Mount Korong distinctly heard and felt it, and made the remark to each other that an earthquake shock had taken place. Persons on the Jersey Reef thought a wholesale falling in of old workings had taken place. At a farm on the Swanhill road, 10 miles away, the shock was distinctly felt. The windows of a house fully a quarter of a mile away were shattered by the concussion. Some children sitting in Market-square were blown right over. All this evidence leads most people to the conclusion that several hundredweight of powder went off in the first explosion.' The Victorian Pahliament Houses.— A \- Royal Commission is to be appointed in Mel bourne to supervise the improvements to be carried out iu the Parliament Houses, as re commended in the report of the joint Com mittees of both Houses, it haviug received the approval of the Legislature. During the recess (remarks the Argus) the improvements in the ventilation of the present chamber for the As sembly can be carried out. The alterations re commended are : — 1. To clear away the division walls at present standing between the Council and Assembly Chambers, and throw the entire space into one large hall, 100 feet in length by 47 feet wide, crossing the corridor to the entrance vestibule. 2. To have a wide corridor extending across the front of both chambers and to either extremity of the new buildings. 3. To make such openings in the present roof of the Assembly Chamber as will provide for the more rapid egress of heated air. 4. To clear away the obstructions in the existing corridor at the back of both Chambers in order to admit cool air from the east, and in winter, if necessary, from the north. The cost of these works will be, it is estimated, about £10,000. and as the Legislature has signified its approval of the plan the Treasurer will be prepared to advance the amount required, so tliat the improvements may be effected by the time the new Parlia ment meets. Recetvkd. — ' The Garden and the Field' and 'Willianos's Monthly Diary,' New Year's Eve. — The streets of Adelaide as a rule present a very quiet appearance cwards the 'wee sma' hours ayont the twal.'' The solitary policeman on'his beat, an occasional belated -worshipper at the shrine of Bacchus, or an unfortunate member cf the fourth estate who is obliged willy-nily, to steal a more than few hours from the night, form the principal of the side-walk proineiuulers after the mid night hour has struck. Once only in the year is this state of things different — that is on the night which precedes the ushering in of the new year, and for tome hours after the in teresting stranger hns been born. Last night was no exception to this rule. From about 11 o'clock watch-night services were held in a number of the city churches, which were largely attended. At the half hour before 12 the Albert bellringers woke the echoes, and at the same time those of the citizens who liappened to have retired, by ringing merry peals on the Town Hall bells. As the hour struck the streets, hitherto comparatively quiet, began to fill with people, and universal hand shakings, wishing of compliments of the season, and cheering made things lively for the time. To add to the unwonted joy of the occasion several drum and fife bands paraded the streets and made melody, or what passed for such in the estimation of the performers and their friends. This is certainly a better way for our juveniles to manifest their delight at the fact that they have entered - into another year than that in which a portion of them have sometimes indulged. Mr. Superintendent P- rswald deserves the thanks of the community for the trouble he has taken to prevent the senseless practices which have been so popular amongst the larrikiu element of Adelaide iu past years, sucli as marking the date of the new year on doors, walls, and shutters in chalk, paint, and even tar, and indulging in other mischievous pranks. On the night of December 31, for the past two years, and again on Sunday night the whole of the police force were sent into the streets, the majority in plain clothes, to keep in check these little ebullitions of youthful spirit, which, though doubtless vastly amusing to the perpe trators, are a source of considerable annoyance and trouble to the people whose premises are embellished by amateur efforts at house decora tion. Tee New Steamer. — The South Australian has made her maiden voyage to Melbourne and back, and in addition to proving herself a fast boat she has been very generally admired, and 'stood well the crucial test of criticism to which she was subjected when in Melbourne. Capt. Lcckyer reports leaving AVilliamstown at 5 p.m. on the 28th, and proceeding down the Bay, passing through the Heads at 7.35 in company with the P. & O. Company's steamer Assam. The wind was then strong from the south-west with an attemlaut cross sea. At 2 a.m. of the 1 29th she rounded Cape Otway with a furious head gale that continued for some time, but ; which only tested the thoroughly seagoing ' powers of the vessel. At 3 pan. she passed Cape Northumberland, and as the wind veered to the southward it moderated very consider ably, and at 6 a.m. of the 30th the steamer entered Backstairs Passage, and was reported off Cape Jervis at 7 on Satur day morning. It was four hours 40 minutes afterwards before the Assam reached , the same point, and at that time the South ; had touched at Glenelg, discharged mails aud passeugers, aud liad steamed up the Gulf nearly as far as the Bell Buoy. On the boarding officers visiting her the tide liad run low, and . she found it necessary to stop for a time before attempting to pass the bars. Eventually she steamed into the Narrows with barely sufficient water to save her from touching, so that it was impossible to take time over the measured mile, as she was obliged to head through the cut under quarter speed. Partiality of the Elements. — As giving an idea of some of the crops in the agricultural district lying between Clare and Port Wakefield, we (Y. P. Advertiser) have it on direct autho rity tliat one fanner in the Skilly Creek has gathered 22 bushels to the acre; but on the South Hummocks one farmer obtained so much from 160 acres that he was enabled to carry one full half in one load on his wagon, whilst another who liad cropped 115 acres had even to buy his seed wheat to try again for another year. The Wheck of the Otago.— The Otayo Daily Times of December 15 writes : — ' We see that the Associated Press telegrams iu the Australian Press state, regarding the wreck o the Otago, ' the officers and passengers behaved admirably, but the seamen behaved very badly, forcing themselves into the ladies' tents, from which they were promptly ejected by the cap tain.' This report having beeu shown to be utterly without foundation, it is to be hoped its contradiction will be circulated by the Austra lian Press Association.' Accident at Moonta Bay. — A lad named James Simpson (says the 1'. i*. Advertiser) was run over by a cart thriven by a boy named Remlet on Boxing i-ay at Moonta Bay. Captain Hancock, who was driving past at the time, took the lad into his buggy and placed him under the care of one of the medical gentlemen at Moouta, when it was ascertained tliat the in juries received were of a rather severe nature, but no fatal consequences are anticipated. The Seringa? atam. — The Argus of December 28 states that ' Messrs. James Service & Co., who are the agents for the City line of ships, to which the City of Seringapatam — reported as lost — belongs, liave uo information of the occurrence beyond what has already appeared in this journal. They cannot say whether there were any passengers on board the ship, but the probabilities are that there were none, as the City line are more cargo than passenger ships. The papers relating to the vessel will not reach here until the arrival of the next mail steamer, and therefore no particulars can lie given as to the cargo on board or the insurances effected on the ship. The City of Seringapatam was a 1,200-tou ship, and had been to this port on two previous occasions in command of Captain Murray. On this voyage, however, she was in command of Captain Reddie, who had been transferred from another of the ships of the City line. Messrs. George Smith & Sons, of Glasgow, are the owners of the City of SeriDgapatani.' The Rabbit Nuisance. — Our Mount Bryan East correspondent lately wrote, stating that it was the opinion of many of the local residents that the Government should stringently enforce the cultivation clauses of the Land Act, and not allow some to hold land, ostensibly for sheep farming, but which was kept swarming with rabbits, to the serious loss of the bona fide selector. We have now received a letter from a Hallett farmer, who admits the extent of the rabbit nuisance, and states that seven or eight persons in the ranges who keep sheep, to whom he evidently thinks our correspondent refers, could comply with the cultivation clause if it were not for the pests. All-England Eleven v. Victorian Fif teen. — In another column we publish from our special correspondent a full telegraphic report of the great cricket match in Melbourne, which ended ou Saturday iu a victory for the colonial team. Railway Survey xn the Socth-East.— Arrangements have been made (remarks the Border Watch) for two more surveyors to assist iu the survey of the railway liue from Mouut Gambier to Rivoli Bay. We understand Mr. Jonathan Rogers, the Assistant- Engineer for the Soutlt-East, is now about to take up his resi dence here again, and that he will see there is now no unnecessary delay in carrying out the work. An Old Orange-Trek.— The World says:— ' A most ancient and respectable inhabitant of Versailles has recently given up the ghost. This is an orange-tree more than four centuries old,5far older than the chateau and as old as the family that built it. The Queen . of Navarre gave the original orange-pip to her gardener in 1421; he sowed it at Pampeluna; from there the orange-tree was- moved^ in the days of its youth to Chantilly, where it was the property of the Connetable de Bourbon, whence its name of ' Le Grand Connetable.' Francis I. seized it, and transferred the tree to Fontainebleau. When its master turned traitor and went over to Charles V., Louis XIV. transferred it to Versailles, where it has survived some half dozen revolutions, two or three invasions, and nearly 200 winters. But the Third Republic has beep more than it could bear, and it has died without giving any previous signs of ill health.' Defrauding a Gas Company. — In Hobir Town a man has been committed for trial for defrauding the local Gas Company. He had very ingeniously connected his house with the main by a secret pipe, through which he drew his supplies without paying for them.

The state of the ground may also liave had something to do with Dalesman's running, aud we may see a total reversal of that form when he gets on to the sounder going at Flemingtou. The Hurdle Race, the Steeplechase, aud the Three- year-old Handicap likewise promise good s^rt.' The Vagabond. — According to the following paragraph by ' Atticus' in the Leader the Aryus ' Vagabond'* seems to be a source of terror iu other places than charitable institutions: — 'A literary vagabond has beeu taking the round of our public institutions lately for the purpose of ' doing* them into so many columns of matter. The officials aud managers of places tliat he has not yet visited are rather shy now of strangers, and more than one new chum has had the finger of suspicion pointed at him on account of his fancied resemblance to the notorious Press detective. The week before Parliament was prorogued one member invited auother down to the refreshment room to have a drink. 1 No,' said the invited one, ' aud if you take my advice you'll keep away too. There's a uew fellow serving iu the bar that I've bf eu told as a positive fact is no other that dashed .'Vagabond'' that the Art/us set on Service. But Til go over to the White Hart if you like.'' Kerosine Lamp Accident. — Another case of burning from Kerosine oil (says the IVallaroo Times) Occurred to a Mrs. Plunkett, Hospital nurse, on Christinas night. Sho was carrying a tin kerosine lamp, which burst, aud her clothes caught fire. A patient jumped out of bed to her assistance, and Corporal Smith and Police constable Sullivan, who were passing on their usual rounds, rendering their assistance, the fire was extinguished. The poor woman is severely burnt, but no serious consequences will residt. She is now under the care of Dr. Jay. The Palestine Exploration Fund. — A meeting of gentlemen interested iu the work of the Palestine Exploration Fund was held on Wednesday afternoon, December 21 (reports the Age) at the Assembly Hall, in Collins street. Mr. E. M. Gibbs was iu the chair, aud Mr. H. W. Fry, the Honorary Representative of the Society, was present, and gave a statement of the work already accomplished by the Society, their present doings, and future aims. A Pro visional Committee was appointed, consisting of the following gentlemen : — Dean McCartney, Revs. A. Gosmau, S. L. Chase, C. M. Yellaud, A. Davidson, Dr. Ifiia, aud Mr. Gibbs, for the purpose of taking steps to establish a branch of the 'Palestine Exploration Fund iu Victoria. The special object of the fund may be briefly stated to be the eludicatiou of the Bible, by a careful survey of the whole country west of the Jordan, conducted by trained officers aud wen of the Royal Engineers in the pay of the Society. A large map, similar to the Ordnance survey of England, is being prepared ou the scale of one inch to the mile. It will be published in 26 sheets, and each sheet will be accompanied by a memoir, giving minute details . as to topography, archieology, ethnology, &c.; When this \v t of the work is completed exca vations in Jerusalem aud in the surrounding country will be proceeded with. The examina tion of Jerusalem has already made some progress, but this is now in abeyance until the survey is completed. On the following day another meeting of gentlemen was held at St. Paul's Schoolroom, Swanston-street, ? when a Permanent Committee was formed, aud steps were taken to bring the Exploration Fund before the public. Dr. lflla was appointed Treasurer ; the Rev. W. Poole, Hon. Secretary ; aud the names of the Revs. W. Wood, of Haw thorn, and G. P. Lush, of Fitzroy, were added to the Committee. A Delicate Watch.— Every one knows (says ' Atticus') that some watches are exceedingly sensitive to changes of temperature, but I think I heard of the most sensitive iu the world the other day. At a diuuer party a gentleman declined to take some ice cream for fear the chill should cause his watch to stop ! The owner of a sensitive article like that should take care tliat he never looks upon it coldly for fear of upsetting its delicate organization. Sleepy Judges. — Perhaps (writes ' /Egles') if their Honors took a leaf out of the book of the late Judge Burton, of the Irish Bench, they might avoid the danger of misdirection. During the last years of his career, being deaf and infirm generally, he occasionally fell asleep upon the Bench. And it was observed tliat his decisions were clear and good iu proportion to the length of his uap. Wheu some one hi private con versation suggested this curious result, he explained it on the ground that iie ' escaped so much of the humbug talked by the Bar.' Cool. — When the refrenhineut tent at the cricket grouud exhibited symptoms of giving way during one of the squalls on Boxiug Day (says '^Egles' iu the Australasia a) the owner sprang to one of the guy-ropes and held on man fully against the wind, leaving his bar im tenanted. Just then a bibulous- looking person, addressing a companion, said, ' Now's our time, Bill,' and helped himself to half a tumbler of brandy. He bowed pleasantly to the tl'1 frauded proprietor, who glared at him, but couldn't leave his rope, and retired gracefully before the gust was over. Qtjeen?land Railway Rk«buve*.— We have received from the Queensland Government a sketch plau of the railway reserves in the western part of that colony, near Roma, showing the lots of land to be offered at auction at Bris bane in March next, together with a catalogue of the various lota. Any one desirous of seeing the .same may do so ou application at this office. Weather at Mount Gambieu. — We had a splendid fall of rain here yesterday, which will do much good (says the Border IFatch of De cember 27). Never was rain more anxiously looked for. It would be au extraordinary thing for Mount Gambier to get over a whole month without rain, and till Christmas night there seemed a strong probability tliat this would be the case. There was a little rain during the iiight; but it came dowu in good earnest about 8 a.m. on Tuesday, and fell tliroughout the day with only a few breaks. It spoiled the lioliday, but has saved the potatoes. A Refohsi rN Playing Cahos.— I uuder stand (says ** Atlas' iu the World) that it is proposed to introduce round instead of «quare shapfcd playing cards, as beiug more easy to manipulate while dealing, kc. Also, tliat .instead of merely having the suits coloured black and red, they are to be red (hearts), green (diamonds), black (spades), aud yellow (clubs). This will certainly help to keq- the several suits distinct. SriciDEs. — The total number of suicides in France in 1874 is said to have reached the unprecedented total of 5,617, or nearly Id a day. [From Saturday's Evening Jour/uU.] The Ovebland Likh.— Communication lias been restored on the Port Darwin Line. Mk. Henry Tayloh. — We believe that Mr. Henry Taylor will in the course of a few days give an address at Hindmarsh on u The Farm Labourera' Revolt.' The Echo. — This coasting steamer will leave for Moonta Kay and Port Pirie as usual on Thursday, January' 4, at 4 p.m. The advertise ment, jvas accidentally omitted from Saturday's Reyiiier. . ? ? .
