THE MY8TEEIES OF CEIME; OB, The Experiences or ajs EonrBFEGH Detectiye. — No. XIX. [Published by special arrangement with the Author.] A BIGAMIST AND HIS VICTIM. Anonymous letters are stabs in the dark. The best place for them is the fire. So we think, and so we generally act. But the burning of the letter does not always de prive the thrust of its sharpness, oi the intelligence of its startling nature. If the letters come in regularly, with steady per sistence at the one statement, we find the subject cropping np in our minds and creeping into our discussions' ; and sotne^ times, in the long run. as in the following case* .we really' take action in the matter : an&| have done with:it:— ' ^ : y Tp the Ciiisff ofPolice, Edinburgh.* - ,- ' *' Sir— I again beg- to call your attention to Aspen Villa, the residence, of Major Scoular, near C ? - . — X have every reason to suspect that .a acme woman is confined in that house against her will, .and, treated with crufelirfand .severity. By investigating ^e matter at once, you will confer a favor -: -m,-\:j; ?..:.. '?':?.?? : ?'?- - --? '.: -...?': ??? ?? ; **/Boius truly, - ; ??-? .: .???;»= -?;? ♦« £xnx-:b*e:w ? ? ? :- The above -was i;he seventh or' /eighth ' ' letter that we had reCeiye^ V^thin. .a:, month s time ; but though ; eterg f one '? 6Z; { them was in the same handwriting, and;, contained exactly the same ? 'statement^ ' Lynx-eye' shrouded herself eo well that * we could' not safely take any action iii 'ihe ; : matteT. The ^letters mostly bore the '??'* Edinburgh postmark, hut bj . the district stamp— now fallen into disuse— we could ' see that they: were never twice dropped into ? the same Ietter4»x ;? and so we gave up the idea of trying to discover. her by watching the receiving-house,' as' we might ' have done had she stuck to one. ' It was not, want of sympathy for 'a sane woman, confined against her will,' &c;, ? that tied our hands, but a due regard for our own safety and a seasonable tlread of a hoax. The few facts we gleanedin a quiet . way as to Major Scoular and his surround- : ings appeared to confirm us in this course. ; He had retired from the anny-^a bachelor of thirty-five or so — on half -pay; and shortly after suddenly augmented his for tune by marrying a young lady, an orphan, but holding in her own right wealth to a great amount. Thus the Major's quiet and - retired ' apartments' in Forres-street were exchanged for two brilliant establishments — one a countiy one, away in the North, and another at C ? -, close to Edinburgh. The Major was a 'fast man.' This is a re- - spectable term, and means literally a drunken beast and a brutal libertine— at least, that is the meaning 'I wish to give it here. For a time, however, all had gone well. His young -wife had either become reconciled to his failings, or had learned ta . submit where there was no remedy. But a : fearful rupture came at last, and it- was ' : snpposed that the lady had returned to Lei* friends^ leaving him to' squander ii| his- own ' way the wealth she had fiung at', hfe feet* The house at ?;C— ^- was all but: closed, an ', old woman being left in charge, and the: . Major seldpm.if; ever going near. the places : * while that in the North was never occupied, but when its-owner chose to. take:a number of his boon companions to ft; itfiat; they . might hold their revelries undisturbed. Aa ? as ruleVliowever, he kept by his splendid -fiuite'bT apartments at the West End, and- :? '.seemed to live but for one object — how to^ get rid of his money. ? °: Now, putting these facts alongside of our anonymous letters, it seemed not at ail. unlikely that the whole had emanated from spite or spleen in one of the Major's dis carded mistresses. Women are strange beings. As they can love, so can they hate; and I would rather have twenty .men seek my destruction than one woman. I admire women, but I fear them; -also— ^a& every one must who has seen as much of their doings as I have^ ? ' Perhaps, had the complaints come. from. - more ' than one source, we might have moved quicker ;.butj as it was, the month had nearly elapsed, and then I received the . , following important order: — . - - ' That ' Lynx-eye' r again ! You might just take a walk out and see what like the -i house is, if you have nothing in hand. Do not interfere in any way, nor let yourself be seen. Just look about you and let me know the. result.' , ; This vague order I understood perfectly % and the wary and cautious execution of? the same was just a task suited, to. my peculiar likings. I walked leisurely out by : the West End thinking the matter over, ? and got within sight of the house* In stead of approaching it, I turned into the old churchyard, where an ; old gravedigger was at Work, and sat down on a tombstone near him to fan myself and rest after the hot, dusty walk. , , , L . . ?.. ' If any one in the place has heard or knows anything about this business, this man will, was my mental conclusion ; and - veiy soon we were 'cracking' away like . old acquaintances abo.ut the old church and. . its antiquities. After he had given me snuff, and the history of the box, and had retailed to me the usual nonsense traditions regarding the stone ladies and headless knights in the adjoining church, I gradually edged away to the surrounding scenery and houses^ — including, of «jourse, the lonely house, Aspen Villa, which we could just see, and no more, through the trees at a - distance. But at this point he drew up and grew cold and reserved. I pressed him for a reason. ? ? . ? ' I dinna ken — I've nae particlar rea son,' he answered at last. ' Jist, I dinna like tae speak aboot it. The fact o' the matter is — the place is haunted.' ' Haunted ? How so ? You don't be- y lieve in such nonsense, do you ?' ' Believe or no believe, their's mair than me thinks it,' he doggedly returned, sud denly resuming his digging, as if to get rid * of the subject.- - - - ? ? ? : - ' Is that a fact ?' I said, simply, dropping into his own broad Scotch ' Mau, I thocht thae sort o' things were a' by wi't now-a-days.' 'Ay, but they're no,' he quickly re turned. 'It's the same world now as it was long ago ; so, if there was ghosts then,. . there must be ghosts now.' ? This was a position which I did not for a. moment attempt to dispute. ' But what kind o' a ghost was it?' : ' I dinna ken that, though ; for ii has : never 'been seen.' ' Never been seen ? Then hoo dae ye; ? ken it's there.' '? ' Because ifs been heard.' 'Oh, ho! I see; Man, I like tae hear about a' thae sort o' funny things. Tell us . noo it Degan, and what it s a aboot.' ' It began when the Maior's young wife dee'd.' . . . . : ' Oh, his wife is dead, then ? ' I said* almost forgetting myself with the start. . 'Yes; they didna 'gree very weel, and, separated after an awm row. She went J^., hame, and dee'd o' a broken heart, they say.' - .

Like the ./.^nonjmous/.v'LyjttHeye,'' :I twas now be4 ginning to believe that a woman was shut .*ip in that r gloomy and lonely 7 place. The only question was — who was the woman, and what object could he. have in.-shuttoig1. her up? Had his .wife .really gone away after the rupture ? ..It did not^ seem quite clear to me that she had; -; There was a sus picioas mistiness about the whole concern.

' In a word, why was the woman shut up ? ^ i JRTwst w^heobject^wsjesfflflished? .That was just wherel waspuUed up; andl had little hopa of assistance 'from the old man. : I knew, jof course,; that in:r a small village the most trifling sayings and doings are ' known perfectly from one end of the place to tlie otkeiy almost as soon -as they- are in lexistence-; but 'it ^was evident to tub 'that the suspicions of the people had never once been directed into the same channel as my .own, and I despaired of:, getting; much ?nearer the truth for the present: ^3till? it was worth a trial, -'aad-I: gradually edged him back Jto the old'topic. ': f ? ' Did you. ever hear what the Major's final TquarreL with his wife was about ?' I aske^'-afteka fewJeading questions. . .' No, it. was never kent richt wiat it was ' aboot, except that she|had imade_spjtiie dis^ covery, an' wadna live wi' him ony langer.' ' A discovery ?. what could-it-be, I won der ? Perhap^ that he had a town mis tress, or something of that sort;' ' No', she kent that ianj* afore : for he had the' impidence tae -Ming ane o' them oot tae the hoosewi' him one day. She was sent hack -smert enough the 'road slie ? came, and there was a row ower it tag; ' but they didna separate then.' ' Did you never hear folk talking about the thing,,and speculating on what the dis covery could be ?''.'. ' On ay,-rve heard mony a queer story, but theyVe a' blethers.' ' Let's .-hear one of the l blethers.' ' ' Weil, mind ye, I dinna say they're richt ; but there are some that say the Major was man-it afore.' f ' Well, there's no harm in that, is there ?f — tbat couldn't cause them to separate, could itr'1 - ' No, if his first wife was deid at the time.'' - . . ' Ha! I've got it now!' I cried, with a .jump. a Got what ?' asked the old man, looking up in surprise. ' I mean, I understand it now,' I said, with some incoherency, noticing the slip I had made. ' Ab, but it's only a story, ye ken.' 'Ah, of course; you said so before,' I vaguely -returned; and then he got leave to dig away without interruption, while I tried to put all the stray pieces of informa tion together, into one unbroken chain, with the aid of the fresh clue which I believed I had lighted upon. ' The title of this paper gives the reader the whole gist of my thinkings and suspi cions ; but I need scarcely say that it took me a considerable time to get at it. And even then I was by no means certain that I had hit the .truth— the thing, seemed pro-! bable, that was all. - Ifow, I like probable things, and in-; . variably fasten on them, in preference -±o : anything wonderful- or supernatural. Vlf the Major .was a bigamist, and the know ledge of the fact had come to the ears of his second wife, he had a great deal to hope from keeping her shut up, and every thing — the loss of the fortune he had sinned for, the hootings of the world, the -revengej .jftf.an insnired .woman and- .her.~relativ£3r- andftlie losfr of ,M* owttlibertvrand^eputa-j ti-m^6^earfroni-ldM^4iy^free.

But here th& whole thing seemed reversed ; no o^e took the slightest; notice of him. The commonest person; seemed' toshun him like a' pestilence. He] stalked up-and. down, glaring fiercely and; haughtily on every one and everything,and ; shx^hjng^ impatiently at ? liis tspu3ejrs^ with the riding-whip he' carried— alone in the^ midst of a, chattering, lively crowd. By- ; and-bye/after studying the man's brutalised and debauched' countenance, and not being mightily pleased witlrthe prospect, I was attracted to a noisy trio gathered round a; nevrspaper, and arguing warmly as to the ; meaning of the words' decree etbsplv&ur.;' One was perfectly right, and the other per fectly wrong; but wishing to see how they would settle, I did not interfere, or offer an opinion. All at once a harsh voice be hind us took the matter up, with the words — '. It . means that the man is legally ab solved from all claims.' , Every one looked up in surprise, for the speaker was Major Seqular; but not one, -look of intelligence showed that they ap preciated liis opinion, or even recognised1 his presence. A dead silence fell on .the i group ; they fidgetted uncomfortably, and stared stupidly, but doggedly, before them. . Like a flash it came to me that now was a chance fpfine. TEere' was nothing about ' me to indicate . that I was not a country bumpkin like the rest, so. with a&stupid; ai look as I could manage to put on at a mo- i ment's notice, I drawled out enquiringly — . 'What way can they no say. that in the paper ?' What's the use1 o? pittin' in these lang- nebbit words that naebody under stands?' „ * 11 Because it is a La-tin phi-ase which ex presses the idea more tersely,' said the Major, evidently relieved at some one taking' notice of his remark. -- .

'It was something 'like uxorem incarcero ?' ! The moinent the two words' fell on his ear, the Major's face whitened to the lips ; his twitchino; fingers tightened on the riding whip in his hancL, and his ferocious eye be- ' came chained in a tigerish glare to my ^ace. .. ' '''' /. - ' - .-' \- ? No -answer canie^but Bsawthat my probe : had struck the right spot; and I was now ; neither to be frightened nor diverted from ; following up the advantage. ? ' Doesn't it mean something aboot sliut- : tin' up or imprisoniiH^ti wife f I said, tis simply -as. possible, but speaking the last three words \rith a 'deaf, -firm emphasis. I There was a sudden swish through the \- air, and, before I could interpose a hand, I got the ridingwhip . like a red-hot brand across niy cheek.' t I would.Jia.ve been through .the^ajr and. at his throat like- a flash — for in a moment : my blood was' up, and I had forgotten all but the sudden cut and burning pain— but those at my side, with well-meant land-, ness, instantly threw their hands upon me and held me back. ' Don't move — he would kill you,' whis-r pered. one, as I struggled to thi*ow them off. 'Take that, for an insolent knave.!' foamed the Major, who also had forgotten hiniself and made an admission, but was for the present too f urious to be aware of the fact ; ' and think yourself lucky — I have killed a man for less. You will know me better the next time we meet. ' And yxm me !' I retorted, and then he was gone, with a haughty stalk and a look that was meant to petrify all present. He took the inside of the coach, first class, and I took my seat on the. roof, where I moodily wiped away the trickling blood from' my skinned cheek, and wished that things had only been a few stages further 4n advance, so that I might have- used the handcuffs clicking in my pocket there and then on the brutal ruffian now riding com fortably beneath me. My companions on the roof, I was glad to find, did not under stand the sudden outburst, and strongly advised me to inform the police and bring the Major up for assault; but I need not say I had quite another plan chalked out in my mind. - . ? Half an hour's reflection in the empty compartment below me seemed to have convinced the Major that his passionate outburst in such a place andubout such a suggestive topic had been dangerously un wise, for when the coach stopped at Eriacess street, he got out hurriedly and picked me out of the crowd. 'Pardon me; I was foolish,' he said, trying to soften his look of hate into a mollifying expression, as he touched my shoulder and produced his purse. ' Take; that,, and say no more about it,' and he held out a sovereign. __ . . I looked at him and then at the sove reign, but merely turned away without a word. ?

Meanwhile, after makiiig sure that I was not watched or followed, I made niy way to the Office, and' so stated the facts that. I was not only allowed McSweeny's assis tance, but armed with. ^,' search-warrant: as well/though this latter I did not intend; to use except as a last resource. At. half-past ten that night we started\to walk out, and in less than an hour were treading -with hushed breath the lonely path leading down to Aspen Villa. Had I been less excited and interested I believe the appearance of - the place would have struck me as just thelocality for a ghoat. Tie house was chill and solemn, and atasost shrouded in treesj and everything about it weedy, tangled, anineglected. There TOas an iron railing, jwith a gate and a bell in front; but we olid not seek admittance there. 'We went ~ further ?? aloijig,. pressed; . thi-out.-h the hedge, got :over aiow paling, and stood ? close to the house among the tfeses. '' ?'' ': ' ? - ??''' ' ?' ' 'I-don't liketfcis place at all,^ whispered' McSweeny to me, with something like a; shiver. ' I don't believe there's a livin' sowLin it barrinUthe ghosts, .an' I think I, see heads — queer heads an' no bodies- to them — over beyant there among them dark trees.' *' That's only the big leaves moving iu^the wind 4 it's a peculiar kind of a tree.' 'Very peculiar,' he emphatically- as sented. ' I hope it won't take legs to itself/ and begin to walki Ss-s-sh ! what's that?' Something like a long-drawn wail .came from the house ^md rose distinctly on the air. It had a mournful, ' eerie ' sound, and certainly did appear to come from the - depths of the earth -below the house* with a wavering, spirit-like sigh. The eSSpct pn. McSweeny was instantaneous. . 'Oo-oo-ooh! that's it now, an? we're dead men !' he cried, in terror-stricken ac cents, grasping at me for support,. with the eyes starting out of his head, andi his knees knocking violently together. 'Why did I ever come near it at all ?' 'Shut up! and don't be a feol. What are you afraid of ?' 'The Banshee.' 'Who's he?' ' Don't you ask to ' see. Didn't ye hear it?' .. . ? m . - -»--- ' Yes, and 1 hear it again. It's a woman singing — listen.' Very faintly, but with inexpressible sweetness, the sound of a woman's voice rose on the air, singing one of the plaintive songs of Beethoven, and McSweeny became 'calmer, and even curious, as he listened. ' Are ye sure it's not the Banshee ?' he jasked, 'for divil a word' of it, I under-' 'stand, it spakes a f urrin tongue intirely.' ' It's German.' 1* ' Then it's a German ghost ?' ' No, it's neither a German nor a ghost — 'it's an English lady singing a German song. We must try to get in somehow. Go you first and try your hand.' ''But l^can't, spake German, and; she mightn't think it . polite,' he returned, evi dently not relishing the task. '' You'd better go first, and if anything happens Til be ready to fight like the divil for ye»' ' Ay, or to use your legs at the first sound in the direction of Edinburgh,' I said. ' No, I'll stand by you ; but you must try to l multaver,' as you call it, the old woman into an admissionas to the lady being there, and,,if possible, discover where she is con fined. We might hunt for 'her all night in vain, if the Major is the man I take Mm for.' This did not seem unreasonable, and he consented at once. We approached the front door and rang the bell with a force that roused up every echo, in the place. The singing instantly ceased. . No one appeared to stir: so we rung again louder than before. This wa3 more effectual, for now we did hear a sound, and presently caught sight of a glimpse of light through the key-hole, and then heard the words — . . 'Is that you, §ir?' I nudged McSweeny,. who instantly an swered, in his gruffest tones — ' Yes ; open the door.' We heard the old woman prize at the rusty lock with all her might, but it would not yield. ' I can't move it. Why didn't ye come round by the back ?' she growled at last. ' Comin' through them long, cowld pas sages 'ill 'be the death of ine.' ' Why were you singing ?' imperatively demanded McSweeny. , . 'I wasn't.' «riieaTd%w - 'It must have been &;??,' whispered the old woman through the key-hole, in reply.

A lady, with long;. dSshevelled.Uiairj white face, sunken cheelss-. and, groat eyes almost maniacal ,. in tiiey- brilliancy, stood facing the door — her hands- clasped'1 tight against her heart, . her bosom heaving, and her whole form trembling: -and swaying with eager, expectation.

' Speak to me I speak to me! — pnly let me hear your voices!' she cried, at lasti 'Ithinkjammad!' r [ '; I could only get out a huskyvg-urgie, bui McSweeny clieerily put in — : i K 'Divil a bit, ma'am — ^axing your pardon.; You're not mad at all; an' we're .no more ghosts than you are yourself. W«'re the police, an' you're as safe now ? a&kif; your mother's arms were ?about*youiv-neck. ' ' And I am to live — and be free — and see the sunshine, and sky, and glorious earth!— she~~cried^'with such, wild fervor that I began to fear;; her brain i was really turned; and then her eyes- and clasped hands were raised,.' Oh, _ EBpaven^ how shall I show my gratitude?' ' 'i- At this moment tke rum.Mg^o£_carf|iage wheels in the. lane in front, struck on my ears, and I turned sharply/ on the old woman — 'What's that?' ~ 'r 'I don't know. Nobodji comes- -down here but the Major, and he generally walks.' ' Go and see ; and, if it is- he,_ say a word about us being here, at yovj? peril.' 'Yes, aiid I'll go- along; w4d ye, to see that no ghost grips ye by. the ear,' said McSweeuy, with a wink. '*? If it's him, I can get behind the dure^ an' see that ye din-t let out a word by. mistake j' and they disappeared together j whHe I arranged with some difficulty that the ilady Should allow herself to be locked iix- and receive the abhorred visitor as if. nothing had oecurred. I left the key in the door and -got into the next cellar ; and? then the sound of voices told me that the Major was ap proaching, cursing the old woman at every step for her tardiness in opening. He car ried a great horsecloth over his arm, and as he unlocked the door of his captive's cell I was a little curious to know what it was intended for. As I crept forward in the dark passage I touched McSweeny, and we peeped in together. The Major took no notice of his wife — or rather his victim ^— but coolly spread out the horsecloth and pointed to it, while he unrolled, a bali of stout twine — * ' Lie down there,' he said, in harsh tones. ' I am. compelled to remove you from here ; but you must be well covered up, to prevent the night air from injuring your delicate frame. Resist, and I will kill you. Fora ^hort time you are to be a large parcel, and that you may act the character to perfec tion, this is for your mouth,' and, with a cruel smile, he held up an ingenious con trivance in the form of a gag. The poor lady shrank and shrank as if chained or fascinated by the power of his eye, and from her drooping eyelids I saw that she was .gqing.to faint, and touched McSweeny significantly on the awn. - With out a word, we dashed in, pinned Jiis arins to his side, and snapped on his wrj.sts-the steel bracelets which had already adorned those of the old woman. The whole thing was done so cleanly and swiftly that it was over before he could find voice, but then the oaths, curses, and threats came freely enough. M Who are you, and what do you/want ?' was the first intelligible question I vcould make out in the stream of horrible words that flowed from his lips. . . 1 faced him, and turned the glare of the lantern full on my own face. 'My name is 'McGovan. I said you would know me the next time we met. You are arrested on two charges — first, bigamy ; second, detaining and confining this lady against her will, to prevent fier making known the fact. What other cruelties and crimes you are guilty of will soon ap pear.' il Yes, an' we'll trate you an' the owld woman to a ride in your own coach all the way to Edinburgh for nothing,' said McSweeny. ' You'll go in ours the next time— over to the Calton Gaol.' The Major at once relapsed into sullen silence ; then we were conveyed bodily to Edinburgh in the vehicle he had brought, where he was at once locked up:, after which I drove with the lady first to a lawyer— whom we roused out of his bed — and then to one of her friends, who was equally surprised and bewildered at the unexpected arrival and disclosure of vil li ny . The case at the trial caused considerable: stir — as some, who can see through the; fictitious names I have used, may remem ber ; and on the double charge the Major was tried, convicted, and sentenced to ten year's penal servitude. A narration of the cruelties he. had practised on the poqy lady would fill a book.
