A Short Sermon. Mr. Spargeon has a sermon to yoong men, in which, commending the service of God as the most desirable, he says : I have great delight in seeing my children in the same service. When a man finds that a business is a bad onto, you will not find him bringing up his boys to it. Now, the greatest desire of my heart for my sons was, that they might become the servants of God. 1 never wiBbed for them that they might be great or rich, but. oh, if they would give their young hearts to Jesus ! This I prayed for most heartily. It was one of the happiest nights of my life when I baptized them in the name of the Father, and of the 8on, and of the Holy Ghost, upon proession ef their faith; and now, while I am speaking to you, one is preaching in New Zealand, and another in Greenwich, and my heart is glad that the gospel which the father preaches the sons are preaching too. If my Lord's servioe had been a hard one, I should have said to these lads, " Don't yon take to it. God is a hard master, reaping where He has not strewed ; I went into the service blindly, but I warn you to avoid it." My oondnot has been the reverse of this, and thus I have given you hostages in the person of my eons for my honest love to my Master and Lord; I do, without reserve, commend to you the service of the L>rd Jesus Christ, for if you enter it you will wish your sons and daughters to enter it ; and it will be your ambition that to the latest generation all yonr house may fear and serve God.'
