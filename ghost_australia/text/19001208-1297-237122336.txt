PERTH, Thursday. â€” Tho obBcnco of roliablo information as to tho movemonts of Lord Hope- toun and his arrival in Fremantle, as well as tho desire of tho home authorities that 110 reception should tako plaeo on account of his ill- hcaltb. accounted for tlio -fact that no arrangements had been made to formally welcome hint to Australia. But the overhead railway bridge at Fremantle had been decorated with flags' and greenstuffs, while "Federated Australia Welcomes the Go vernor-General" extended around tho end of the brldgo in red lettering on white background. Over tlio centre of tho Inscription was a design on calico representing tho flags of the Empire enclos ing a painting of the Governor-General. The R.M.S.

LORD I-IOPETOUN INTERVIEWED. \- His Excellency granted an Interview In the cap tain's cabin, which had been placed at his dispo sal tor tho voyago by Commander Crewe. Lord Hopetoun was looking: thin and pallid, and seemed generally the .ghost -of - his former self. .

While ready enough to converse, he desired to keep away from political matters,: and in reply to the tntcrvloavor could give no liifonnotlon as to whom ho would call upon to form; tho flrot Fed eral Ministry. With regard to his Illness, Lord Hopetoun said ho had gone to India for ; a five- weeks' holiday, and at that time' he had' every reason to believe that the cliiflate would suit him. For the first 10 days he was particularly well: then, all in ono day, ho was - stricken with fever, and -became- seriously 111. This was at Mecrut. Ho had af terwards' to be carried into Government House, Colombo, as the attack had developed' into a sovero form of malarial -dysentery.- "I ant quite fit. now," ..remarked his Excel lency, but ills appearance belied it. "At Meerut, I believe, I hardly weighed as 'much as my eldest child. I am able to dress myself now, and toddlo about.. It was only the day before yesterday that- I was able to walk about 'deck. I don t want to see any more of India, "- and his thoughts very, evldoutly went back to unpleasant experi ences he had encountered there. LADY HOPETOUN'S. ILLNESS. .

The years lie had spent in Aus tralia were, lie said; tile happiest years of his life, and he was pleased to bo back again. It was , graLifying to find that tho people wero so kind nnd thoughtful in ..remembering ono who bad loft thorn, though only for a tlriie.

' With reference to tlio feeling In England at the Federation of the Australian colonies, 'Lord'Hopo- toun said that grent delight was felt throughout the- kingdom at tho fact that the colonies had entered into a union. When asked if he had a mes sage to send, to; the. .people of Australia ho re marked that his message would bo to tho whole of Australia this time and not to any one part of it. Ho- added jocularly that ho would take caro not to quota Kipling, but would consider what message ho would send, and lie would. glvo It to his interviewer later in the day. Major Phllson medical adviser to Lord Hope toun, regards .tho Earl's complaint as a oovoro. attack of acute dysentery, which is a very serious - malady in India. Tho Govornor-Genorni was- very fill when ho boarded the steamer at Colombo, but had improved .con siderably during tho trip.
