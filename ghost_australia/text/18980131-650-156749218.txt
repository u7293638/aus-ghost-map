POLIT ICS AND LETTERS. Is it not remarkable says the 'Catholic Press, ' that with the exception of Mr. Wise, not one of our leading public men can write a good article 1 Every English statesman of note is, or was, a writer. Gladstone, if not luminous is voluminous; Lord Salisbury was onee a working journalist ; Lord Rosebery's 'Pitt' is the best modern study of character; John Morley once edited the 'Pall Mall' and is better known as a great writer than a3 a statesman ; even Henniker Heaton has written articles, or fathered articles written by his ghost Robert Dennis â€” anyway he kept up his end in this respect. And so on. Mr. Reid has written articles for the ' Review of Re views,' but if he values his reputation he will not write any more. We are not acquainted with the literary efforts of Messrs, Brunker, Carruthers,. Young, Jacob Garrard, Cook* Want, Lyne, and M'Millan. Mr. Bruce Smith has certainly written a book on 'Liberty, ' he has another ready for the press ; but his pen hai not bad much influence. Mr. Barton writes an admirable private letter, only that. Sir George Dibbs . has written leading articles ; and R. E. O'Connor once kept the pot boiling by newspaper work, but his pen has been rusty for years. They have magazines in Eng land where the best men can meet, but here we have no neutral meeting gronnd, except the ' Catholic Press. ' Perhaps when we get Federation we will have our ' Fortnightly Reviews' and 'Nineteenth Centuries, ' and ihe art of writing will be more honoured than that of speech making. Still the public should demand a book on Education from the pen of Mr. Garrard. Some of the younger members of the House write. Ashton and Millen are vigorous leader writers ; Mackay is the author of two novels and a book of poems; J. C. Neild has written poetry the world will not willingly forget ; Tom Ewing is the author of a novel, and John Haynes writes advertisements for country papers.
