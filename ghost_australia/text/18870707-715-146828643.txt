V i ■ The action and the words j caused Yip^et to succumb utterly The last remnant of strength deserted hdr, an&,. inVhelplesB half-fairitihg-seohdition, she felt her bundle taken from her, and she herself borne into the cottage and hot in a capacious armchair near the cheerful fire.

"H thocht ye had sjvarfed clean awa," slie said. : "No," returned Violet. " I have not been unconscious. I krow all that you were doing for me, and you have .given such relief. "Words fail me to express my sense of your kindness." " Never speak o' that, my dear, she's an ill woman that wadna tak' pity on ; a human creature sae forfochan, and a youny ladylike you thatisna fit for a nicht's travelling; But wait a wee, and Fll gie ye some breakfast, and dinna speak a word mair at pre sent." The teapot which ;-had been in us for her husband's breakfast was stam ing by the fire making* ready her owi SYom it she poured a warm cup of te; and having prepared slices of brea ami butter, handed them to Viole and smilingly bade her "fa' tae." Be the latter no second invitation wasri quired, her faintness was the result a much of hunger as fatigue, and it ws with "eager alacrity that she {Viole! partook of the offered food, and neve did food seem so eweeb and deliciou as that homely fare when: it passed he lips. Her strength returned wit every mouthful, and fe the time sh had diposed of two cupti and the.larg fr-edi egg which her hostess had boile for her she was both satisfied and we. recovered from the weakness which had-so.greatly overcome her. i"-Now the next thing ye need is a sleep," said the considerate woman, who showed all a mother's attention : to'the. unknown wanderer, "sae justj 'lie.ye hack again, and I'll mak' ye' comfortable, and nae noise shall dis-; turbye." - j ; Drowsy now, and under a feeling j of ineffable-repose, Violet resigned herself with perfect confidence to the slumber which was stealing over her as an effort of nature to demand that sleep of which she had been un duly deprive-7, unresistingly submit ed to have her feet propped up by an other chair, and a coverlet spread over her. -Scarcely had this been done, fwl^n^mth, ji smile of peace settling on he^ruby.lips, she sank into a slumber •as deep and dreamless as that which fnsits the innocent soul of infancy.
