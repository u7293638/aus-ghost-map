EVERY YEAR 'Life is a count of losses, Every year ; For the weak are heavier crosses, Every year ; ' Lost Springs with sobs replying Unto weary Autumns' sighing, While those we love are dying, Every year. The days have less of gladness, Every year ; The nights more weight of sadness, Every year ; Fair Springs no longer charm us, The winds and weather harm us, The threats of death alarm us, Every year. There come new care and sorrows, Every year ; Lark days and darker morrows, Every year ; The ghosts of dead loves haunt us, ? The ghosts of changed friends taunt us, And disappointments daunt us, Every year. To the Past go more dead faces, Every year As the loved leave vacant places, Every year; H Everywhere the sad eyes meet us, ?L In the evening's dusk they greet us, Bl And to come to them entreat us, B Every year. 4 You are growihg old,' they tell us, Every year ; 4 You are more alone,' they tell us, l\\\ Every year; M. I'M 4 You can win no new affection, BvJ You have only recollection, Leeper sorrow and dejection,' . *;/ .Every year.' J. Too true ! Life's shores are- shifting, V' Every year ; And we are seaward drifting, Every year ; Old places, changing, fret us, t The living more forget us, . are (fewer to regret ue',' r sflr Every, year. ' [ / But the truer life draws nigher, ri / Every year; ',? / And its Morning Star climbs higher, j Every year ; JB Earth's hold on us grows slighter, ' m And the heavy burden lighter, ? And the Lawn Immortal brighter, ? Every year. B . — N.Y. Christian Advocate.
