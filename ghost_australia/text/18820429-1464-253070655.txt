MUNICIPAL PICTURES-GLEN INNES. The Matoe. A fidgety, busy young man, A fussy and fizzy young man, A bark seldom bite, Always go home at night, Good-hearted and merry young man. The Aldermen. Whosoever thinketh the capfitteth , let him wear it. A crusty and cranky young man, A no hanky-panky young man, A come to the point, Never work out of joint, Precise, and exacting young man. A ' d independent' young man, An ever ascendant young man, A will of my own And surrender to none, Ungoverned, and canny young man. A'quiet and steady young man, An off-hand and ready young man, A muscular, calm, And I don't wish to harm, Unobtrusive, and plodding young man. An honest and placid young man, A sort of sub-acid young man, A help you along With a hearse or a song, Good-natured, well-meaning young man. A stout and compact young man, A matter of fact young man, A mean what I say, Never think of display, Reliable, thoughtful young man. JJH I love the gladsome music of a brassy touting band, ®ypj That raises ghosts outside a certain hall, As I tear my hair with ecstasy and keep it off the stand, Try in fact to keep it on my head at all. For I dearly love the bandman who plays upon the flute, And the lunatic who hammers on the drum. As for the ophicleidist — he's a brute — a perfect brute — I would like to give the lot of them ' f um fum. ' There's a crooked-visaged villain with a perfect coil of brass, With distended cheek a-blowing all he can, And the neighbours' cats are silent, having voted him an ass ; Oh I'd like to only interview that man ! Then I'll ask in that conductor, and make him take a seat, Just where Growler takes his winks in forty halves — And then that great musician can take it mixed or neat, But I bet he'll leave behind his dainty calves 1 fHERE was an old man of Junee, Who thought that the best drink was tea, Till they gave him three-star, When he said softly, ' Ah ! There's nothing like prime eau de vie.'
