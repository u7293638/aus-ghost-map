nail and His Friends. By JOHN BROWN; M.D. FOUR *t>D THIRTY years ago, Bob Ainslie and I were coming up Infirmary street, from the High School, our heads together, and our arms twisted as only lovers and boys know how we When we got to the top of the street, and turned north, we espied a crowd at the Iron Church" A dog fight !" shouted Bob, and was off and so was both of us all but praying that it might not be over before we got up ! And is not this boy nature? and human nature good and don't we all wish a house on fire not to be out before the Bee it Dogs like fighting, old Isaac says they "delight" in it, and for the best of all reasons, and boys are not cruel because they like to see the fight They see three of the great cardinal virtues of dog or man com age, ends meet, and skill-in intense action This is very different from a love of making dogs fight, and eu30)mg, and aggra trating, and making gun by then pluck A boy, be he never so fond of fighting if he be a good boy hates and despises all this, but he would have run off with Bob and me fast enough it is a natural and not a wicked interest that all boys and men have in witnessing intense energy n action Does any curious and finely ignorant woman wish to know how Bob eye at a sluice announced a dog fight to his burn 3 He did not, He could not, see the dogs fighting, it was a flash of an inference, a rapid induction The crowd round a couple of dogs fighting is a crowd may either marry), or h an occasional active, com passionate woman fluttering wildly round the outside, and using her tongue and her hands freely upon the men, as so many " brutes, ' it is a crowd annular, compact, and mobile , a crowd centripetal, having its eyes and its heads all bent ^ downward met me and to one common focus Well, Bob and I me up, and find it is not over a small thoroughbred white bull terrier is busy throttling a huge shepherd s dog, unaccustomed to war, but not to be trifled with They are hard at it, the scientific little fellow doing his work in great style, his pastoral enemy lighting wildly), but with the sharpest of teeth and a great courage Science and breeding, however, soon had then own, the Game Chicken, 13 the premature Bob called him, working his way up, took his find grip of poor Yarrow's throat, and he k) gasping and done for His master, a brown, handsome, big young shepherd from Tweedsmuir, would Inn o liked to knock down an) men, would "drink up Esil or eat a 'crocodile," for that part, if he had a chance It was no use kicking the little dog that would only make him hold the close Many were the means shouted out in mouthfuls of the best possible ways of ending it "Writer! but there was none here, and many ened for it who might have got it from the well at Blackfriars Wyud "Bite the tail and a large, Augue, benevolent, middle aged man, more desirous than rise, with some struggle got the bushy end of Y arrow s tail into his ample mouth, and bit it with all his might This was more than enough for the much enduring, much perspiring shepherd, who, with a gleam of joy over his broad visage, de- ered a terrific strain upon our large, vague, benevolent, middle aged ft lend who went down like a shot Still the Chicken holds , death not far off "Snuff a pinch of snuff .

"Yes, ' said I, and was off after the mutiny He made up the Cow go to at a rapid swing , he had forgotten he engagements He turned up the Candleunkei Ron, and stopped at the Harrow Inn There was a carrier's cart ready to start, and a keen, thin, impatient, black a vised little man, his hand at his gray horse s hold, looking about angrily for something " Rub, ) o thief I said he, aiming a kick at my great friend, who drew bringing up, and headed the heavy shoe with more agility than dignity), and, watching his master's eye, slunk dismayed under the cart, - his ears down, and as much as he had of tail down too What a man this must be-thought I-to whom my tremendous hero turns tail ! The carrier saw the muzzle bringing, cut and useless, from his neck, and I eagerly told him the story, which Bob and I always thought, and still think, Homer, of King David, or Sir Walter alone were worth to a hearse The severe little man was mitigated, and condescended to Bay, ' Rab ma man pair Rabbits, ' whereupon the stump of a till close up, the ears were cocked, the eyes filled and were comforted , the two friends were reconciled " Hupp and a stroke of the whip were given to Jens and off went the three Bob and I buried the Game Chicken that night (we had not much of a ton in the buck- often of his house in Melville street, No 17, with considerable gravity and silence and being at the time in the Iliad and, like all boys, Trojans, we called him Hector, of course Six years have passed long time for a boy and a dog too Taisho is off to the wars , I am a medical student, and clerk at Minto House Hospital Rab I Biw almost over week, on the Wednesday and we had much pleasant maniac) I found the way to his he n t by frequent scratching of his huge head, and an occasional bone When I did not notice him he would plant himself straight before me, and stand wagging that had of a tail, and looking up, with his head a little to the one side His master I occasionally saw ; he used to end in "disaster John," but was laconic as any Spartan One fine October afternoon I was leaving the hospital, when I saw the large gate open, and in walked Pub with that great and easy saunter of his He looked as if taking second possession of the place, like the Duke of Wellington entering a subdued city, satiated with victory and peace After him came Jess, now white from age, with her cart, and in it a woman carefully wrapped up the earner leading the horse anxiously, and looking back When he saw me, James (for his name was James Noble) made a curt and grotesque "box," and said, Master. John, this is the mistress ; she's got a trouble in her brest some kind of' an income were thinkin' " By this time I saw the woman's face, she was sitting on a sack filled with straw, her husband's plaid round her, and his big coat, with its large white metal buttons, over her feet I never saw a more unforgettable face pale, serious, lonely, delicate, sweet, without being at all what we call fine She looked sixty, and had on a much, white as snow, with its black ribbon, her silvery, smooth hair setting off her dark gray eyes, eyes such as one sees only twice or thrice in a lifetime, full of suffering full also of the overcoming of it, her eyebrows black and delicate, and her mouth firm, patient, and contented, which few mouths ever are As I have said, I never saw a more beautiful countenance, or one more subdued to settled quiet "Allie," said James, "this is Master John, the young doctor , Rab s freend, ye ken We often speak aboot you, doctor " She smiled, and made a movement, but said nothing, and prepared to come down, putting her plaid aside and rising Had Solomon, in all his glory, been handing down the Queen of Sheba at his palace gate, he could not have done it more daintily, more tenderly, more like a gentleman, than did James the How gate over, when he lifted down Ailie his wife. The contrast of his small, swarthy, weather beaten, keen, worldly face to hers, pile, Subdued, and beautiful, was something wonderful Rab looked on concerned and puzzled, but ready for anything that might turn up, were it to strangle the nurse, the porter, or even me Allie and he seemed great friends "As I was saying, she a got a kind of trouble in her breast, doctor with we take a look at it We walked into the consulting room, all four , Rib grim and comic, willing to be happy and confidential if cause could be shown, willing also to be the reverse, on the same terms Ailie sat down, undid her open gown and her lawn handkerchief round her neck, and, without a word, showed me her right breast I looked at and examined it carefully, she and James watching me, and Rab eying all three What could I say ? There it was, that had once been so soft, BO shapely, so white, so bountif also." full of all blessed conditions, h 3rd as a stone, a centre of horrid pain, making that pale face with its gray, lucid, reasonable eyes and its sweet resolved mouth, express the full measure of suffering overcome Why was that gentle, modest, sweet woman, clean and loveable, con- demned by Go to bear such a burden ' I got her away to bed " May Rab and me bide 1 ' said James "You may, and Rab, if he will behave himself " " I'se warrant he's do that, doctor ' And in slunk the faithful beast I wish you could have seen him. There are no such dogs now He belonged to 1 lost tribe As I have said, he was brindled and gray like Rubislaw granite his hour short, hard and close, like a lion s , his body thick set, like a little bulls sort of compressed Hercules of a dog He must have been ninety pounds weight, at the least, he had a large, blunt head, his muzzle black as night, his mouth blacker it) in any night, a tooth or two-being all he had gleaming out of his y ins of darkness His head was sen red with the records of old wounds, 1 sort of series of fields of battle all over it, one eye out, one ear cropped is close as was Archbishop Leighton's father a , the remaining we had the power of two and above it, md in constant communication with it, was a tattered rag of an ear, which was for ever unfurling itself like an old flag, and then that had of a t me, about one inch longer it could in any sense be said to be long, being is broad as long, the mobility, the most mtineousuess, of that had were very funny and surprising, and its ex pressive twinklings md workings, the water communication between the eye, the car, and it, were of the oddest and swiftest Rab had the dignity and simplicity of great size, and having fought his way all along the road to absolute supremacy, how is as mighty in his own line as Julius C ear of the Duke of Wellington, and had the growth of all bread fighters You must h ii 0 observed the likeness of certain men to certain annuals, and of certain d LS to men Now, I never to let it Rib without thinking of the great Baptist preacher, Audrew 1 Idler The anne large, he u v, menacing, tom bitive, sombre, honest countenance, the same deep, inevitable eye, the same look as of thunder sleep, but ready, author a dog hold min to be in tied with Next day my master, the surgeon, examined Ailie there was no doubt it must kill her, and soon it could be removed , it might never return it would LIVE her speedy relief, she she with five it done She c no desire 1, looked at James and said When! 1 To morrow, bud the kind Bindoon, 1 man of few we 01 is She and James and Rib and I refused I noticed that he and she BE like little but seemed to anticipate everything in each other The follow HIL. day, it noon, the students came 111, hurrying up the great bear At the first landing place on a small, well known buckboard was 1 bit of paper fastened with waters and many remains of old waters beside it. On the paper were the words, "An operation to day J B, Clerk Up in the youths, eager to secure good prices in they crowded, full of interest and talk " Vv hat B the cast " V Each side is it Don t think them heartless they are neither better nor worse than you or I , they get over the professional horrors, and into their proper work, and in them pity, as an emotion, ending in itself, or at best in tears and a long drawn breath, lessens , while pity as a 1901 e is quickened, and gains power and purpose It is well for poor human nature that it is so The operating theatre is crowded , much talk and fun, and all the cordiality and stir of youth The surgeon with his staff of assistants is there In comes Ailie , one look at her quiets and abates the eager students That beautiful old woman is too much for them , they sit down, and are dumb, and gaze at her These rough boys feel the power of her presence She walks 111 quickly, but without haste , dressed in her match, her neckerchief, her white dimity short gown, her black bombazine petticoat, showing her white stockings and her carpet shots Behind her was James with Rab James sat down in the distance, and took that huge and noble head between his knees Rab looked por plexed and dangerous , for ever cocking his ear and dropping it as fast Ailie stepped upon a seat, and laid herself on the table, as her friend the surgeon told her arranged herself, gave a rapid look at James, shut her eyes, rested herself on me, and took my hand The operation was at once begun , it was necessarily slow and chloral prisoner of God 's best gifts to his suffering children-was then unknown The surgeon did his work. The pale face showed its pain, but was still and silent Ribs soul was working within him he saw that something strange was going on blood flowing from his mistress, and she suffering , his 1 rigged ear was up and importunate , he growled and gave now and then a sharp, impatient yelp he would have liked to do something to that man But James had him firm, and gave him a glower from time to time, and an intimation of 1 possible kick all the better for James, it kept his eye and his mind off Ailie It is over she is dressed, stops gently and decently down from the table, looks for James then, turning to the surgeon and the students, Blue courtesies, and in a low, clear voice begs their pardon if she has behaved ill The students all of us wept like children the surgeon happed her up carefully and resting on James and me, Ailie went to her room, Rub following We put her to bed James took off his heavy BIIOCB, crammed with buckets, heel e nipped, at d put them carefully under the table, say ing " Minister John, I in for names yerstryngo nurse bodies for ATION 111 by her nurse, and 1 is going about 011 my Btoekm soles as canny as pussy And so he did and handy and cleveland swift and tender, as any woman was that horny handed, snell, peremptory little man Everything she got he gave her, he seldom slept, and often I saw his small, brown eyes out of the darkness fixed on her As before, they spoke little Rab behaved well, never moving, Bhowingua how meek and gentle he could be, and occasionally, in his sleep, letting us know that he was demolishing some adversary He took a walk with me every day, generally to the Candle maker Row ; but he was sombre and mild , de chased doing battle, though some fit cases offered, and indeed submitted to sundry indignities and was always very ready to turn, and came faster back, and trotted up the stair with much lightness, and went straight to that door Jess, the mare, had been sent, with her weather worn cart to Howgate, and kind doubt less her own dim and placid meditations and confusions on the absence of her master and Rab and her unnatural freedom from the road and her cart For some days Ailie did well. The wound healed " by the first intention for as James said, Our Ashe's skin owes clean to bell " The students came in quiet and anxious, and surrounded her bed She said she liked to see their young, honest faces The Surgeon dressed her, and spoke to her in his own short, kind way, paying her through his eyes, Rab and James outside the circle, Rab being now reconciled, and even cordial, and having made up his mind that as yet nobody required worrying, but, as you may suppose, Semper Paratus So far, well but, four days after the operation, my patient find a sudden and long shivering, a " groom',' as she called it I saw her soon after, her eyes were too bright, her cheek coloned , she was restless, and ashamed of being so the balance was lost, mischief had begun On looking at the wound, a blush of red told the secret , her pulse was rapid, her breathing anxious and quick she wasn't herself, as she said, and was vexed at her restlessness We tried what we could James did everything, was everywhere, never in the way, never out of it Rab subsided under the table into a dark place and was motionless, all but his eye, which followed ever) one Airlie got worse , began to wander in her mind, gently , was more demonstrative in her ways to James, rapid in her questions, and sharp at times He was vexed, and said, "She was never that way afore , no never ' For a time she knew her head was wrong, and was always asking our pardonable dear gentle old woman then delirium set in strong, without pause Her brain gave way, and then came that terrible spectacle, The intellectual power through stones and things Went sounding on its dim unit perilous way she sang bits of old songs and Psalms, Stopping suddenly, mingling the Psalms of David, and the diviner words of his Son and Lord, with homely odds and ends and scraps of ballads Nothing more touching or in a sense more strangely beautiful, did I ever witness Her tremulous, rapid, affectionate, eager Scotch voice, the swift, aimless bewildered mind, the battled utterance, the bright and perilous eye some wild words, some household cures, some thing for James, the names of the dead, Rub called rapidly and in a of remy t v one, and he starting up, surprised, and slinking off is if he were to blame somehow, 01 had been dreaming heard, many e eager questions and beseechings which James and I could make nothing of, mud on which she seemed to Bet her till, and then sink back up understood It was very sad, but better than many things that are not called said James hovered about, put out and niiscriblt.but active and exact as ever, resaid to her, when there was a lull, short bits from the Psalms, prose and metre, chanting the latter in his own rude and serious wa)s showing gunt knowledge of the fit words, boiling up like a lion, and floating over her as his " am Annie "Allie, me to oman Ma ma bonnie wee dug tie The end was drawing on the golden bowl was by taking, the silver cold was fast being loosed that animals bland a, Nangula, hoyles, coursing, was about to flee The body and soul-eompniions for sixty years were being murdered, and taking leave She was walking, alone, through the valley of the shadow into which one day we must all enter and yet she was not alone, for we know whose rod and Still were comforting her One night she had fallen quiet, and as we had hoped asleep , her eyes were shut Wro put down the gas, and sat watching her Suddenly she sat up in bed, and taking a bed gown which was lying on it rolled up, she held it tenderly to her investgate the right side We could see her eyes bright with surprising tendencies and jo), bending over this bundle of clothes She held it as a woman holds her sucking child, opening out her nightg w n impatiently), and holding it close, and bleeding over it, and murmuring foolish little words, as over one whom his mother comforters, and who sucks and is satisfied It was pitiful and strange to see her wasted, dying took, keen and yet vague, her immense love "Preservene' groaned James, giving way And then she rocked back and forward is if to make it sleep, hushing it, and wasting on it her infinite fondness " W ic's me, doctor I declare she is thinking' it's that burn "What bank ' The our) burn for over hid, out were Mysie, and she is in the Kingdom forty years and must " It was plainly true, the pain in the breast telling its urgent story to a bewildered, mined but, was mislaid uni mistaken it suggested to her the une siness of a breast full of milk, and then the child, and so awaits OHIO more they were together, and she had her an wee Rosie in her bosom This was the close She sank rapidly the dear mm lift her but, as she whispered she was and still it was the lightning be fore the final darkness After having for some time lain still, her eyes shut, she said, " Innes He came close to her, and lifting up her calm, deal, beautiful eyes, she give him a long look turned to me kindly but shortly), looked for Rub, but could not see him, then turned to her husband again, it if she would never leave all looking, shut her o) es, und c imposed herself She lay for some time breathing quick, and passed away so gently that when we thought she was gone, James, in his old fashioned with, held the mirror to her her face After a long pause, one small spot of thinness wires breathed out, it vanished area), and never returned, leaving the blink, clear darkness of the mirror without a stain " What is our life ? it is even a vapor, which appeareth for a little time, and then varnish away ' Rab all this time had been full awake and motionless ; he came font trd beside us Airlie s hand, which James had held, was hanging down , it was soaked with his tears , Rab licked it all over carefully, looked at her, and returned to his place under the table James and I sat, I don't know how long, but for some time, Buying nothing He started up abruptly, and with some noise went to the table, and putting his right fore and middle fingers each into a shoe, pulled them out, and put them on, breaking one of the leather hatchets, and muttering in anger, "I never did the like of that before ' I believe he never did, nor after either "Rab! he Bald roughly, and pointing with his thumb to the bottom of the bed Rub leapt up, and settled himself, his head and eye to the dead face " Minister John, ye 11 wait for me," said the carrier, and disappeared in the darkness, thundering down stairs in his heavy shoes I ran to a front window there he was, already round the house and out at the gate, fleeing like a shad Ivy I was afraid about him, and yet not afraid ; so I sat down beside Rab, and, being weaned, fell asleep I awoke from a sudden noise out side. It was November, and tWc had been a heavy fall of snow Rib was in Pfau QUO, he heard the noise too, and plainly know it, but severance I looked out, and there, at the gate in the dim morning, for the sun was not up, was Jess and the cart, a cloud of steam rising from the old mare I did not see James , how as already at the door, and came up the stairs, and met me It was less than three hours since he left, and he must have posted out-who knows how? to How gate, full nine miles off, yoked Jess, and driven her astonished into tow n He had an armful of blankets, and was str carrying with perspiration He nodded to me, spread out on the floor two pairs of clean old blankets, having at their corners, "A G, 1794, in large letters in red worsted These were the initials of Alison Gi line, and James may have I looked in at her from without-himself unseen but not unthought of when he was "wat, wet, and weary, and after having walked many miles over the hills, may have seen her sitting while " a' the lave wore sleepin', and by the firelight working her name on the blankets, for her son James's bed He motioned Rub down, and, taking business in his arms, laid her in the blankets, and hap( id her carefully and fully up, leaving the face un- covered and then lifting her, he nodded again sharply to me, and, with a resolved but utterly miserable face, strode along the passage, and down stairs, followed by Rab. I followed with a light; but he didn't need it. I went out, holding stupidly the candle in my hand in the calm, frosty air ; we were soon in the gate. I could have helped him, but I saw he was not to be meddled with, and he was strong, and did not need it. He laid her down as tenderly, as safely, as he had lifted her out ten days before, as tenderly as when he had her first in his arms when she was only " A. G.," sorted her, leaving that beautiful sealed face open to the heavens and then taking Jess by the head, he moved away. He did not notice me; neither did Rab, who presided behind the cart. I stood till they passed through the long shadow of the College, and turned up Nicholson street. I heard the solitary cart sound through the streets, and die away and come again ; I returned, thinking of that company going up Libberton Brae, then along Roslin Muir, the morning light touching the Pentlands and making them like on-looking ghosts ; then down the hill through Auchiudinny woods, post " haunted Woodhouselee ;" and as daybreak came sweeping up the bleak Lammermuir, and fell on his own door, the company would stop, and James would take the key, and lift Ailie up again, laying her on her own bed, and, having put Jessup would return with Rab and shut the door. James buried his wife with his neighbors mourning, Rab inspecting the solemnity from a distance. It was snow, and that black, ragged hole would look strange in the midst of the swelling, spotless cushion of white. James looked after everything ; then rather suddenly fell ill, and took to bed was insensible when the doctor came, and soon died. A sort of low fever was prevailing in the village, and his want of sleep, his exhaustion, and his misery made him apt to take it. The grave was not difficult to reopen. A fresh fall of snow had again made all things white and smooth ; Rab once more looked on, and slunk home to the stable. And what of Rab ? . I asked for him next week of the new carrier who got the good-will of James's business, and was now master of Jess and her cart " He put me off, and said rather rudely, " What's your business with e dows ?" I was not to be so put off. " Where's Rub ?" He, getting confused and red, and intermeddling with his hair, said, "'Deed, Bir, Rab's dead." " Dead ! what did he din of ?" " Weel, sir," said he, getting redder, " he didna exactly dee ; he was killed. I had to brain him with' a rack pin ; there was one down' on' him. He lay in the treviss withe mear, and wadna come out I tempt him wi' hail and meat, but he wild talk teething, and keep me free feeding' the beast, and he was aye gur gurrin, and grip gripped' me by the legs. I was laith to make away with mild dawg, his uke wnana tween this and Thornhill but, 'deed, sir, I could do nothing else." I believed him. Fit end for Rab, quick and complete. His teeth and his friends gone, why should he keep the peace and be civil ?
