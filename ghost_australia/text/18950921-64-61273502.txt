THE Imiïift- remains outside Truth office. "Whether he will ever get tired and give the job best is doubtful. He has taken root; hail, rain, and sunshine couldn't move him, and there aro indications that he will still be found there when the Millenium comes round, unless he gives up the ghost in the meanwhile. The proprietor, editor, staff, etc., quite enjoy the fun of being hauled up through the window, and their ceaseless jokes rankle in tho breast of the poor bailiff to such , an extent that' murder is often, observed in his. eye. It appears an easy matter to obtain judgment, but a hard mat- ter to execute it. Some two or three months have elapsed since the . proprietors were ordered to pay £11)00 for alleged libel. The plaintiff continues to meander about the city in the hope that the bailiff will effect un entrance into the premises while the mem- bers of the staff are away on a journalistic carousal. ..'..-.
