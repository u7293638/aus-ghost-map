A French Ghost Story. Galignani tells a curious story respecting the trial of a small farmer named Pfister, of the Department of Bas llbin, for a breach of the Game Laws. A peasant returning home late one night, saw, as he thought, the horned head of a frightful monster in a pool, which be bad to pass. He rushed reathlees to the village with an alarming account of the demon, and a band of villagers immediately sallied forth with weapons. When they came to the pond they saw the creature, an Pfister fired at it. It turned out to be only a slag which had gone -into the pond for cool ness. As the harm was done, the body w&b; cut up and divided, and the Tillage feasted. However, the authorities heard of the story, and Piister was prosecuted for a breach of the game laws, the shoot ing season having closed. An advocate who d fended him tailed attention to tbe fact that on the same day as that on which the offence had been been committed tbe Prince Imperial had shot a stag in the forest of FonUinebleau, that all tbe journal* had recounted the exploit, and that no judicial pro ceedings han been instituted against his Imperial Highness. The advocate did not desire the applica tion of the law against the Prince, but onlv asked for indulgence in consequence of the coincidence. However, the tribunal wus properly impressed with tha difference between a prince and a farmer, and condemned Piister to oOlr. fine, and the payment of costs, ordering also the gui to be confiscated. Under the ci.cuiDBtances a ghost would have been the more satisfactory antagonist.
