CHAPTER I. . - "I say/Tom, I want you to go ont to Brig;, low Bend. The roan bull has strayed away from his mob, and Christy says he cut the beggar's tracks going In that direction. I'm awfnlly sorry to have to send you to-day, bnt I can't help it. You're the only man oa luv SVUIIVU II UU t«lU IIUVO IU tud( blind country, and he's too valuable to lose. The boss gave £200 for him only last moath."- The speaker was George Dalryinple, mana ger of Violet Bank, a cattle station on the head waters of the Dawson, on which I was overseer. I had jnst ridden np to the hat after a' hard morning's work, and was look- tag forward to a luxurious dip la the big water hole, followed by an afternoon's spell; for It was Christmas eve, and all hands were to knock off at dinner time. ' "ri " 1 that is/'blcss the ball 1" I ei- claimed; 'swInglng/myEeif from -the saddle. ,'Tt's a bit rougU'on a man to lose his Christ- inas dinner' nnd' all the sport afterwards ;6ver that bhast- Wliy-in blnzes-didn't Christy go after hliii-bimself?' He might have found hlinreastly if he/had taken the trouble to look."! - ' l- "He did run'tlie tracks as-far as he could, but when they; led -into that; patch of rough : country; beyond ;the Box -Flat he lost them altogether;;-: >You know: Christy's not a star at that game,;; Fin certain you'll find the bull somewhere about- the- Bend. Ho camped there on the road up, and tried his best to -.break.' away with some scrubbers that sneaked np dnrlng the night. At ail events, lie's gone In that direction, as I said before, and : he must be found, Christmas or no 'Christmas. I wouldn't send you if I eoulil 'help It, but who else is there? All that country . round the Bend would puzzle a biackfellow since the brlgalow got a start on it, nnd, if It comes to tracking, you're the man for the job. You can sleep in the hut to-night If you go straight to the Bead; that Is, if you're not afraid. I think I've heard you say you don"t.belIeve..in ghosts?" "Not II". I replied.! . ;'i: might have been, scared of old Lanty lii tlip flesh,. but I don't think his spirit can hurt .me, even if It does 'walk.'

' ilnrlng come to this' heroic, determination, I shook up my horse and cantered steadily on towards the Box Flat,; across .whlch tlie bull was snhl to bnve passed. On reaching the flat I picked up his tracks without piuch difficulty, and ran them three or four miles, uiil ii they led in to the! rbiigli, broken country , spoken of by Dniryiiiplo. To follow ; tliem here required slow, patient work, so, as they, headed almost duo north, I resolved, lo leave, tliem, push on to the hut, niid make nu early start next morning. CIIAPTEK II. Barely half nu hour of daylight remained when I rode Into the clearing In which' tlio, deserted humpy stood. As my gnzq rested on Its dark, weather-stained walls, and tliou travelled round the belt of dull, ..greyish- green scrub which shut out the last; level; revs of sunshine, my lieart grow chill, aud a shiver, such ns Is said to seize oue. when a stranger trends ou the spot destined to- be. one's grave, shook mo from head to foot; hoc an Instant a fooling of actual bodily terror took possession of me, then, with a laugh— somewhat forced, I must coiifess-nt my childish weakness, I sprung from Illy horse, nnd unbuckled the swag which I had enrrieil before me on tlio saddle. 1 Gathering all my traps lu my arms, I a.l- vnncod to the hut, and, pushing open the crazy door, whleli drooped mournfully from one lilnge, stopped boldly across the thresh old. Instantly there came a startled "hoot hoot!" followed by n scurrying and ruslilng, as a whole colony of, paddy melons dashed past me,, running ngnlnstniy legs, niid, falk Ing oyer, each other Iii tlielriiiiad liusto, while h huge wlilte owl, scared out of his (lull wits by, my. sudden entrance,; flapped through the doprwnjv -.ncnrly knocking my hat olf us he tvent. I: felt; Inellaeil. to drop uiy load ; and ru|i, but I liad screwed, my .courogoi.to tlio sticking:, point,, .and, .presently, : when quiet was restored, I . placed my, baggage on. tiio ricUcl.ty, tabic nnd, wen, t. outside to unsndflle my horse. .in.flvomniites I had hobblcd hlm out; with ong ring,,' 'and gathered an armful of, dry, wood for iny fli-q. Then) taking iny quart pot, and tlio billy which I liud brought at- the cook's suggestion,," I descended the sloping bauk.aiid.fllleiDtiieui out of the liver, which, ran,,, dark, nndslnggish, around the bond., .My horse, li(id already .ninde his why fn! iliA wnioi' ntiil wiiti nnu' flliiililnir elnwlv. up the baiik,!iilhbling at the green fiver grass as. lie shujiicd hloiig. , He whlnueyed ns' I , nnsseil. mill T pnnseil 'to pnf Ills firm' glossy neck, feeling, as even I Imd never fclt.before, tlio bond of sympathy and com- pniiioiiship which so closely unites the bush- mini and Ills faithful slave.
