His One Patient. There is a good old story told in Spain, that runs somewhat to this effect ? There was a certain man who was gifted with a very peculiar kind of second sight : When he went to a doctor's he could see | outside the door the ghosts of all those patients who had died during the time they had been attended by the doctor. One day he himself fell ill, and it became necessary that he should seek the assistance of a physician, so he stirted out to find the best one he could. He visited tbe houses of ull I the medical men who were supposed to be the cleverest in the town, but he found all their doorways so blocked up, as it were, with ghosts that he did not like to go in. After traversing all the principal streets and not finding a single doctor whom be thought he could trust, he at last turned into a side-turning, and, outside tbe house ol a seemingly very insignifioant doctor, he saw only one little white ghost I glimmering ; therefore, thinking he must be a very clever doctor who had only killed one person, he went into the house, and was attended to by tbe doctor. As he was leaving ! the doctor said to him ' I cannot think who recommended you to ' oome to an Insignificant man like myself, seeing that during the whole time I have practised I I have only nad one patient, and I am quite sure tbat he did not tell you,'
