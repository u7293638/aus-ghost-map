' But she had been there only a few Juntos \- -when she relinquished all hope of effecting' _er ' escape & that direction. ? The oastle on that side was built upon the \ sharp elope of the -wild southern bluff, thus plac iing her ?frindows, as she had observed, from her 'xoQm. at an immense lieis-hfc above the court.. Bat while she might have hoped to overcome that obstacle by some ingenious device* thexd was [another and insurmountable difficulty. ; The high walls Eurrounding the ruins had been ?tepfcin so excellent a state of repair that they irendered escape absolutely impossible. She thought of Becret and underground modes of egress. But she had no opportunity to prose . cute euch a search. . Hampered, as she was, by Brigitta's respectful [but Oloee eurveillaiice, she was obliged to depend i wholly upon her quick observation, and «ven that '?obseivation had to be exercised with the greatest ;circtnn8p6ction. 1 She left the court-yard not altogether dissatiB ififtd, It was fiome£ning to have discovered the 'utter futility of any attempt in that direction. The return to her imprisoned chamber was 'accomplished with the same privacy that her [departure had been. They encountered no one, that portion of the castle being quite untenanted iBave at intervals, -vhen its few furnished sleeping chambers were- occupied by certain doubtful guests. 1 The remainder of the daypassed without events rand the night also, though Brigitta madesher early entrance, the following morning, with many and terrible feara as to what she might en counter. The next two weeks proved equally eventless. t-iavolo's ghost made no sign, and the Ailing* hams scrupulously refrained from intruding in .any way upon Nina's retirement. Both mother and son had determined to avoid irritating in terviews till the final moment when the latter [would bo fully prepared to press his suit accord ing to his intentions. , Impelled by an ? unalterable purpose to escape at the first opportunity, Nina used every possible means to regain and preserve her vigour. Each day she exercised in the mined court yard; and several timesj to Brigitta's infinite dis . ;gust, strengthened her muscles by ascending the ?mountain side, though never without the woman's strong hand upon, her arm. . i And the effect was plainly noticeable in her ,l6Vely colour, rounded cheeks, and clear, bright :eyes. Undoubtedly the pure air- with judicious .medication, was doing its healing work* How ; ever discouraged she might feel in view of her 'fruitless efforts to find some means of escape* it was certain that she was slowly, but surely, approaching a condition absolutely essential to iher success in that direction. t-vnhg the progress of these two unevenif nl weeks, letters had duly arrived from Sir Robert and the Jeffries, and also one from Lucy by the :roundat-otit way Nina heraelf had innocently in*, dicated. The latter If ina never saw. The former she quietly read and quietly put aside. The folly of answering them was too apparent for the idea to be entertained & single moment. Mrs. Allingham's facile pen, however, made due amends in forged replies that admirably served her infamous purpose. Precisely fourteen days after the beginning of Doctor Allingham's dark preparations for the open development of his plans he announced mem completed.
