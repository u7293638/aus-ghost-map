WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1874. In the Legislative Assembly yesterday, the Speaker took the chair at half-past 4 o'clock. In reply to questions by hon. members, it was elicited—That the Government could not pay the workmen on Evans and Christo- pherson's contract at the Yan Yean, because Major Smith had placed a notice oí motion on the paper relative to the matter, and therefore the House would havo to decide the question ;-that the Messrs. Callaghan had withdrawn the legal objections to the confiscation of their goods, and therefore the whole of them had been confiscated ; the value of the goods was £740, and besides that Messrs. Callaghan had been fined £100. The House went into committee for the further consideration of certain Customs duties. A lengthy discussion took place upon tho proposed new 20 per cent, duties, after which, with the consent of the Govern- ment, "latches and locks, wrought-iron," were struck out of the 20 por cent. list. Mr. Bent then moved the omission of all the other proposed 20 per cent duties. The motion was negatived by a majority of 36 to 23 ; and tho whole of the _ per cent list waa I carried by a majority of 35 to 20. The in- creased duties on wine wore agreed to, and on a proposition by Mr. Munro, to place tin- ware on the 20 per cent, list, progress was reported, and the House adjourned. In all probability the debate on the second reading of the bill providing for the payment of members, will be taken to-night, and as the question is one ol grave importance, it iß desirable that the public should have a definite opinion respecting it. We do not think it can be truly affirmed that the country, as a whole, is very ardently attached to the principle ; but this fact is attributable in all probability to a want of duo con- sideration. The cost is heavy-viz., £28,800 per annum-and it was evident during the general election that many people thought themoncy might be better spent on public works than in remunerat- ing hon. members for their attendance in Parliament. It is difficult, we know, for the men of the present generation, with their English ideas and traditions, lo understand what necessity there is for payment. They know that in the mother country a seat in the House of Commons is eagerly sought, and that gentlemen, so far from requiring a pecuniary recom- pense for their services, are willing to spend sums equivalent to a moderate fortune in order to gain an entrance. They remember, too, that before Parlia- mentary stipends were heard of in Victoria, there was no dearth of candidates for electoral favours, and under the circumstances they can- not understand why we should pay for an article we can always procure gratis. We admit the full force of all that can be said against the system, and are also fully alive to the magni- tude of the expenditure that it in- volves, but, after giving the matter careful consideration and attentively watching the course of the experiment which has been going on during the past three years, we are driven to the conclusion that, not only is the custom of remunerating our representatives sound in theory, but it is also beneficial in ope- ration. Ab most of our readers are aware, the bill awarding 6300 to each member was passed by the Parliament before last as a tentative measure, and its dura- tion was limited to the end of the first session of the second Parliament from the date of its enactment. Unless, therefore, otherwise provided, payment will cease when Parliament is prorogued. In view of this fact, the Treasurer has only provided £14,000 on his estimates for this year, but as Major Smith's bill is almost sure to pass, Mr. Service will have to add another £14,000 to the expenditure already proposed. With regard to the fact that in Eng- land the mere honour of a seat in the House of Commons is sufficient to attract the best intellect of the country without fee or reward, we must re- member that we have no leisure class in this country analogous to that which exists at home. As a matter of fact, most of those who have amassed suffi- cient wealth in this colony to render them perfectly independent in their cir- cumstances, and free from any pressing calls on their time, are not such as we should care to see in preponderating numbers in our Assembly. As a rule, wealth without education and culture is by no means an unmixed blessing to its possessor or those with whom he comes in contact. Too often it depraves his nature, narrows his sympathies, con- fines his views, and warps his judgment. The struggle for its at- tainment, commenced under hard con- ditions, and carried on for years with the most grinding perseverance, de velppes to the fullest extent all the in- nate selfishness of the man. It is therefore desirable to pick our represen- tatives, not from the class that has fought the battle of life, and come out hardened from the contest, but from those who are actively engaged in the strife, and who consequently have a fellow feeling with their neighbours who are involved in the same struggle. Many men, however, who are perfectly eligible as represen- tatives - men of large heart and average intellect-aro unable to give their services to the public for nothing. They have themselves and their families to provide for, and must have remune- ration or else decline a seat. Hero, again, many will exclaim that, in their opinion, no one should be in Parlia- ment who is not perfectly independent, and so removed from all corrupting in- fluences. Without staying to discuss whether men who are pecuniarily inde- pendent are therefore necessarily be yond the reach of temptation, wo would point out that the number of men in this country who would be eligible under such conditions would be very small indeed, and would comprise within its limita a majority of the class whose fitness we deny. There can bo no doubt, more- over, that according to our democratic theory of government, the choice of the electors should be perfectly unfettered. They should bo froo to select their representatives from any section of the community, without regard to anything but their meetness for the logislatorial office. In order that they may be un- trammelled in the exercise of their discretion, it is absolutely necessary that provision should be made for tho support of thoso who neglect their own business to attend to that of the country. As to the abstract fairness of giving a quid pro quo-pay for service-wo presume there cannot be two opinions, so on this point we need not enlarge. If in some in- stances the public does not get anything in return for the honorarium it bestows, it has only itself to blame. People who prostitute the franchise must expect to reap as they sow. It is frequently urged, however, that there was no lack of candidates for a seat before remuneration was provided, and that the capacity of the House as a whole has not been increased since the introduction of tho system. No doubt there woro plenty of aspirants, but there were also plenty of scandals connected with their conduct. Every one must remember with regret the disgraceful tales which were at one time current concerning this member and that, how that some were plundering the people through the Land Office, and others robbing the country with the connivance of the Mining department. Those scoun- drels, of course, ought not to havo been in Parliament, for in the absence of pay- ment they could only live by swindling and corrupt practices generally. But there they were, and as thoy laboured under the prevalent delusion that " a " man must live," they preyed upon the public estate with the mo3t un- blushing effrontery. All this, of course, was very bad, for not only did the com- munity suffer in pocket, but also in morals. Sooner than such a state of things should be rovived, it would bo better to pay hon. members any sum thoy had the conscience to ask. Since, however, the moderate remuneration at present given has been provided, it has been possible for the poor representative to live honestly ; and wo are happy to say .hat the public mind has not been shocked of late by rumours of shameless venality. Another beneficial effect of the existing arrangement is, we think, the discouragement of factious opposition to the Ministry of the day. Speak- ing generally, it is very desirable to stiengthen the hands of the Executive in all colonies under responsible govern- ment, and whatever has tips effect must commend itself to intelligent men. It was thought at one time that it might interfere with the independence of hon. members by rendering them too appre- hensive of a dissolution, but the way in ?which they sent the Duffy Ministry about its business when there was every probability that its defeat would be fol- lowed by a reference to tho. consti- tuencies, clearly showed that there were no grounds for this apprehension. The debate which took pi ice last night in the Assembly was one of " thrilling interest The matter under* discussion was of most momentous importance, being no less than the question as to whether gridiron?, meit hooks, furnace pans, and corksciews should remain m the comparative ob scurity of the 10 per cent list or be promoted to the highest scale of duties under which fiscal marauders are con- tent for a while to plunder the coun- try. For an hour or two the issue was uncertain-the fate of the inter- esting articles of domestic economy wb have mentioned trembled in the balance Some hon members spoke slightingly of " grids," others cast contempt upon the claims of meat-hooks to attention, while third parties, yet more wicked than these abandoned people, ventured to doubt the eternal fitness of protect- ing the native manufacturer in the pro duction of furnace pans and cork- screws But, thanks to the brilliant oratory of a Cohen, who shifted his ground so often in the course of a short speech that he completely annihilated the arguments of all as- sailants, no matter from what quarter they emanated, and the convincing eloquence of the " Ministerial tail," all opposition was at length overborne, and a majority of twelve on the decisive division proclaimed the completeness of the Ministerial victory After this signal triumph m connexion with hard- ware, no doubt the protectionists will breathe again. We may congratulate the Treasurer on the character of his first great achievement as a finaucier But while we may smile at all thi3 pother over the classification of these few useful but slightly insignificant articles, the subject has also its serious side Mr Luvgton, m opposing any addition to the 20 per cent robberies, acknowledged that the question was scarcely worth debating, so far as the slight addition to the taxation of the country involved in the Government scheme was concerned, although he could not but consider that doubling the duty on some items included in a miner's expenditure was a curious answer to the petition presented that evening asking for some relief from the burdens by which the mining interest is oppressed But he said, and said truly, that theio was a great principle at stake, and foi this reason asked the Treasurer not to press his proposals in this par- ticular If public men are not only to administer distasteful laws as they find them, but are to tike an active part in advancing a pohcy of which they disapprove, then good bje to all political honour and all political virtue of every kind It is needless to say that Mr Lvngton's appeal was unavailing Wo agree with the hon member for West Melbourne that there can be no sadder sight than public men trifling with their convic- tions, and advocating measures which they have always denounced, and m the wisdom of which they utterly disbehe\ e The spectacle Mr Slr\ ice last night presented to the Houso and the country was of this sorry description He may shuffle with the matter as he pleases, and prattle about the convenience of trade, and the neces- sity of strictly observing his unholy compact with his protectionist allies, but he cannot get over the fact that he -a freetrader-has prostituted Ins position in order to forward the views of the monoprhsts, not from any neces- sity, but of his own free] choice and unfettered will. The Treasurer is rather sore in conse- quence of the buffetings he has received, and wo do not wonder at it. The utterance of the word " principles " is utterly distasteful to him ; for, to use the words of Mr. G. P. Smith", ho has so " utterly befouled his own that they " are past all cleansing." And not only so, but his example has doubtless had something to do with inducing others to drag theirs through the dirt also. The freetraders who voted for the in- creased duties last night were not all in the ranks of the Government, and it is difficult to know how far the demoralisa- tion will extend. One renegade makes many. Mr. Joseph Jones, adopting the words of the Treasurer in connexion with ad valorem duties, said that the conduct of the Government over this matter has introduced a~new crime into our politics. We think so too ; ai*\ if wo wore asked to name tho sin, we should call it " treachery." Thoso modest " friends of humanity" of whom Mr. KNIPE was the fugle- man, who waited upon the Attorney General yesterday to ask the Govern- ment to establish, "a kind of labour " exchange," only wanted a trifle, it seems. They would be satisfied with. £5,000. to start with. Probably Mr. Knipe, when he got home, was asto- nished, like Warren Hastings, at his ? own moderation. Ho might just as well have asked for "20,000 whilo he was about it. There is quite as good a chance of his obtaining the largor as the smaller sum. With a hundred pounds a week, however, for the pur- pose of paying rent, salaries, <fcc., Mr. Knipe thought he might manage to rub along for a year certain. With an active and liberally-remunerated ma- nager-and we have no doubt Mr. Knife had the very man for the '.?A 'let in his eye-no financial arrange- ants to be looked after, no treasurer, no books, and no audit, the nice little project was bound to go on swimmingly. Ju fact, he painted the scheme in such glowing colours that another member of the deputation, Mr. Mars Milleu, seemed to get jealous of him, and begged to assure Mr. Kerferd that he differed from tho views of his enter- prising friend. What the deputation really required was " a powerful ajgis," .which the speaker seemed to imagine ? was a tarpaulin with the same capacity for adapting itself to the * require ,monts of a multitude as the expan- sive tent in the fairy talc. Ho and .the other gentlemen present were "a "cry of distress from the labouring "classes;" and the regis was impera- tively demanded, because " all the laws ."in the statute book were in the "interests of capital." Mr. Coppin ? sensibly remarked that the insti- tution should be rendered self-sup .porting, while Mr.. L. L. Smith -objected to lose sight of the money; . and Mr. Sullivan could not help per . ceiving and confessing that the whole .scheme was a crudity, and that the .promoters of it had placed themselves in a ridiculous position. Finally Mr. Kerferd told these discordant gentle- men that the Government would give the subject-its careful consideration, and ?would endeavour to suggest a scheme for the establishment of some such an institution on a self-supporting basis. ' We are afraid this must have operated as a cold-water douche on tho fervour of the ardent Knipe, and that it must have oruelly dashed his hopes of seeing ihat eligible and excellent manager en irustedwith ¿£5,000 for a twelvemonth's ?work, and exempted from the inconve- nience of keeping accounts and of being responsible to anybody. But the public will not share in Mr. Knife's disap- pointment. On the contrary, with that cynical method of looking at things which has grown upon it of late years, it will be apt to conclude that some ihing which might have ripened into a job has been happily nipped in the bud, and that if the labouring classes want nu aîgis, price ¿£5,000, they had better purchase one by general subscription, or trv and nick one up second hand. _Mr Bur'wood's views appeared to be more rational and practical than those of most of the other members of the deputation, and while we should be glad to seo every facility afforded lo employers and employed for ad justing the supply of labour to the demand, we trust the Government will firmly adhere to its avowed determina iion of making the proposed " bureau " entirely self supporting The (sydney Morning He) aid puts the mattoi very fairly and clearly when it states that a protective tanfl "hasbroken " down tho power oven of thefiee handed " Victoria people to indulge as of old in *' their accustomed luxuries The people " of Victoria consume less than our people "do of those articles which are taxed *' alike m both coloniea, in great part " because money that should be avail " ablo foi that purpose goes to pay heavy " duties upon other goods which oui e< people obtain free from duty " This is ¡the inevitable and universal result of pro lection There is a double loss in con- nexion with every shilling that is taken out of the pocket of tho taxpayer under this dishonest plea It is a loss to lum, "ind it is also a losa to tho person who would otherwise have received it _Vs Colonol Thompson once pithily described it -" It meanB robbing one *' tiadesman who can make what people " will voluntarily buy, to give the saino *' amount of employment and profits to *' another that cannot, with a loss to tho " consumor equal to tho diilerence of " puce besides ' Compaiin¿ the osti Mated Customs tot-ernie of tho two colo- nies, oui S} olney contemporary shows that, cutting asido the ad valuiem duties and "nliaifa¿e ratos, Mr Sri \ ici oxpects to collect fioin 800,000 poisons only t£2o8,200 in excess of tho amount Mi ¡Lioin anticipates ho will raiso from 1300,000 , whereas if the consuming Jioweis of tho two populations woio on a _ni va tapitc, our Customs íevenuo ou{,ht to be ¿14.8,000 greater than it is _Che consumption of spnits, wme, tobacco and ci0ar_, and tea, is actually moro pel lieadin Now South Wales than in Victoria, mid this lBieadily accounted forby tho fact -hat wo aie expected duun¿ the cuiront jeal to pay Customs dutios to tho ertönt of £452,000 upon articles winch aie ad Srutted into tho noighbouung colony free of impost But this is the land of ano .mhos, and its natural histoiy has ¡nothing to show half bo anomalous as tho Hecoids of our political caroei Hoio 5s a population which is not moioly not afflicted with tho national antipathy to Ihxation, but bogs and prays for an in- | cieaBo of its fiscal burdons And hore is p fice ti ado Premioi, with a free trado | Jreasuror, and thrco oi four froo trado colleagues who are as eager and active in consolidating and oxtending a piotoc I ¿îonist policy as though thoy had boon foi ought up at the foot of SiurHORra or Chow leu The Legislative Assembly was engaged during almost the whole of yesterday's sitting En discussing in committee the proposed new customs duties. The whole of the new 20 ¡per cent list was agreed to, and also the increased wine duties. Shortly afterwards fcrogress was roported, and the House ad Bourned. To-night, tho Government will »nnke an attempt to finish theconsideration oi the amended tariff before the adjourn tacnt for refreshment, as afterwards the Bitttic will be devoted to the second reading Df ',luríaymont of Members Bill. Whilst the proposed new Customs duties *vero under discussion in the Legislative 'Assembly yesterday, Mr. Langton favoured *be committee with a statement as to what üio intended to havo dono had he remained in the Government Ho said he proposed *o remit the duties on imports amounting to nbout ono million and a half annually, and 4o have made up the loss by imposing a stamp ta, and a tax upon bank notes. From Mr. ¡Kcrferd's remarks, howover, it appears that these propositions were never discussed in the Cabinet There was a slight interchange of oomph menta between Mr Langton and Mr Service ni the LegislativeAssemblyyesterday During the debate relative to the imposition of new 20 per cent duties Mr Langton after re grettmg the course taken by the memb°rs of the (. overnment who were freetraders in. Introducing new protective imposts said that whatever convenience might result from the proposed changes in the tariff it would not bear the slightest comparison to the injury which the Treasurei had done both to the cause which ho once professed to serve and to his own reputation Te this Mr Service replied that the bon members opinion of 1 is (Mr Service s) reputation and his (Mr Service s) opinion of his (Mr Langton s) were both of about equal value in the eyes of the public lo this Mr Langton again retorted I don t know so mt h about that Shortly afterwards pursuing the same line of

petition was yester day presented to the Legislative Assembly by Mr A T Clark from a stonebieaker named William Bow residing at Williams town The petitioner stated that from March to May 1872 he bad worked for a contractai named John Doherty at Wyndham and on the refusal of the contractor to piy for the amount of the work £8 11s öd he had sum moned him at the Melbourne District Court by mistake when Air Call dismissed the case as being without his jurisdiction In July 1872 ho again summoned Doherty at the Williamstown Police Court when ac cordint to the petitioners statement Mr Mollison the presidinj, magistrate refused to hear his complaint said that Bow had in suited his court by going to Melbourne first and ordered bim to pay £o to the defendant or to be imprisoned for one month Having no money he went up tho country and 12 monthB afterwards returned to the shire of "Wyndham in July 1873 when he was sum moned to Williamstown on 8th August and sent to prison for a month although he had a legal claim against Doherty as was afterwards proved by Judge Cope in the County Court Melbourne awarding lura a verdict with costs on the 17th April 1874 Under these circumstances the petitioner asked the House to take 1 is case into con »ideration as he had been in the colony stace 1850 and had nev er been guilty of any offence against the law In reply to deputations which waited upon them yesterday, the Treasurer and Commis- sioner of Customs agreed to reduce or amend the proposed duties on several kinds of boots and shoes, and to place stamped tinware and ironware under the 20 per cent instead o£ the 10 per cent list The deputation appointed at the public meeting recently held in the 1 ltnoy lown hall, with reference to the establishment o£ a labour bureau, waited on the Premier yes terday, and submitted to him certain propo Bitions, which w ore certainly not lacking in cool assurance Mi Knipe who acted as spokesman, asked that a sum of £ > 0O0 should be placed on the supplementary Estimates to start the bureau, that the persons em ployed through the medium of the bureau should be allowed to travel to their destina tion by tbo Government railways at half ox cursion fares, mid that the postmasters throughout the colony should act in effect as registration clerks Tho bureau would make no charge whatever as by this means its operations would be much simplified These proposals were too much even for some other members of the deputation, who expressed their dissent from thom The scheme submitted to the Go vernment was correctly described by Mr Sullivan as crude and ill considered Mr Kerferd stated that the Government would take the question into consideration, and endeavour to elaborate a scheme for the establishment of such an institution on a self supporting basis A correspondent writes to complain of the dilatory action of the Education department Ile states that he has received information that the teachers in certain schools near I Sandhurst have not received then salaries for three months Considering the small remiineiation paid to most teachers, our cor- respondent thinks this a hardship In a leading article on the subject of the new boot and shoo duties which appeared in our issue of jesterday, the following sentence occurs -" It was altogether contrary to truth for Mr Cohen to say that the importers were satisfied with the alterations We have since ascertained that the lion gentle- man did not make any such allegation What he did say was that both the importers and manufacturers desired a change from ad lalorem to used duties which would be beneficial not only to them, but also to the consumers Our reporter misunderstood lura as affirming the satisfaction of the importers and manufacturers with the change as re- gards the items of duty instead of with the alterations m the method of levying it It is notified that the electric telegraph has been extended to Ballan, and that the ofhce at that place is now available to the publia At a public meeting held at Al Dury on Saturday it was resolved to take action with the inhabitants of Wodonga in sending a deputation to Melbourne, for the purpose of asking the Victorian Government to come to an agreement with the Government of New South Wales to make the bridge across the Murray free of toll. It waB stated at the meeting that the Governments of both colonies had at different times expressed their willingness to abolish the tolls. We learn from the Mxmay and Hume Times that a public meeting was held at the Exchange Hotel, Albury, on Monday even- ing, for the purpose of considering the ad- visability of sending a deputation to Mel- bourne, to urge on the Victorian Government the advisability of opening negotiations with the New South Wales Government for the suspension of the Border duties. The mayor (Mr. K. M'Lennan) occupied the chair. The following resolution was unanimously adopted hythe meeting :-" That this meet- ing is of opinion that action should at once bo taken with a view to socure the free interchange bordorwise botweon the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria of colonial produce, and that a committee bo appointed to carry out the wiBb.es of the meeting by the collection of statistics to be laid before the Victorian Government, and hy such other steps as they may consider necessary or expedient." In accordance with the resolu- tion, a committee was appointed to take action in the matter.

The new meat market in Elizabeth-street north, just outside the city and within the Hotham boundary, erected by the butchers and salesmen of Melbourne in opposition to the corporation meat market, on account of the rental for the latter being raised, was opened yesterday, and the occasion was marked by a banquet which took place in the evening. There was a large attendance, and Mr. W. Reynolds occupied the chair. From the tone of the speeches the market appears likely to be a success.

Stephen, for the defence said that Mrs Riddell was well known as a nurse, and that the publican, if he supplied the liquor, as she said, might very well have supposed that it was a case of emergency, in which some patient required the rum as medicine He also said that the law against Sunday trading was one which was generally broken, though the law should be respected, and that if the samo tactics as those adopted hy Mrs Riddell woregenoially practised, at least one half of the puhhchouses m Melbourne would havo their licences for felted for Sunday trading Mr Sturt, P M said there was no reason to disbelieve that the defendant had committed a breach of the law by selling on Sunday, but that at the same time it did not appear that the house was one of those in which the landlord allowed an amount of drinking onSundaj. lhe defendant had been careless on this occasion but Mr Sturt was glad to find that he conducted his house in an oiderl} manner, and he would be fined in the small penalty of 10a The water police met with a very firm and unexpected resistance when endeavour- ing to execute a warrant on board the American Bhip Arcturus on Monday night, lhat day the Sandridge Bench issued a war- rant of commitment against E L Aires, the chief oflicer of the ship, at the instance of a local tradesman, and it being known that the vessel waa ready for sea, the police at about 10 o clock at night w ent off to the Bhip, which was lying in the stream After some difficulty Senior constable Mtnto and three men got on deck, and the oflicer acquainted the captain with the object of the visit The mate dochned to accompany the police, and consequently the latter pto ceeded to forcibly remove him lhe captain called his crow aft, and ordered them to expel the police Tho visit was evidently expected, foi a whip had been run up to the yardarm, und one of those inconvenient supports known as a boatswain s chair ' was in readiness The mate was rescued, and then, ono after another, the three policemen were alungover the side by means of the whip, and landed in their boat, the senior constable discreetly accepting the alternative of walkint, down tho ladder in preference to reaching the boat with the agency of the " chair lhe police trew tame ashore, and the authorities placed themselves m communication with the American consul, the captain haunt, in formed the senior constable that he was utting under Mr Adamson s ad\ ice in oller ing resistance The pilot board issued mstruc tiona that iio pilot Bhould take charge of the Artturus but the captain endeavourcd to get awaj without professional assistance Ile first got his ship on the St Kilda bank, and after getting two or three milea down the bay ho brought up In the afternoon, Senior constable W hitcher and a water police crew again went down to the ship taking to the captain a letter from the American consul lins having been presented the chu.f mate waa surrendered Aires made no further objection to accompany the police, and asserted that m resisting on the previous nifeht he¡vvas carrjmg out the injunctions of the captain and the consul The mate was brought aahore and lodged m the Williams town lock up preparatory to being sent on to the Melbourne Gaol, as ho had not the means of satisfying the demand in respect to which the warrant was issued. On Sunday night between the hours of 6 and 10 o'clock, some scoundrel amused him- self by smashing the iron gate leading into the Botanical gardens, near the iron bridge. This gate was partially broken on a former occasion. Acts similar to the foregoing at different times, have rendered it necessary to appoint a special night watch in the gardens for the future.

' So far as ia known, nothing very serious resulted to either the doctor or the boy. During the year ending 30th June last, the Geelong Savings Bank received from deposi- tors the total sum of £i8,4S816g. 8d., and paid (including interest amouuting to ¿3,021 Ids. 7d.) the sum of £4G,759 13s.

The amount to the credit of the depositors on that dato waa £101,180 10s. Gd. A peculiar kind of accident occurred yes- terday at Cargerie, near Geelong. A little boy named Richard nodges was carrying some wood and an axe, when ho tripped and fell. In falling, the little finger of his right hand got between the wood and the edge of the axe, and the result was that the top joint was cut clean off. Strange to say, he is the third member of his family whose hand has been similarly mutilated. Kor Bome time past Mr. Ham, of South Geelong, has occasionally missed small articles from his grocery establishment, in which he did not sleep. Ho thereupon watched for the thieves at night, but with- out success. Yesterday morning, however, lie went earlier to the shop than usual, and there caught two lads, aged 15 and 14 respec- tively, in the act of stealing tobacco, the younger one having gained access through a gap caused hy the removal of a weather- board.
