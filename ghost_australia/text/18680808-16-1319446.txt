THE GOVERNMENT AND THE BANKS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. SIR-It is not at all surprising that, among other charges brought against the Government during the debate of August 4, that of limiting the amount of deposit at the Savings Bank to £500 should have been prominently urged Ministers attempted a justification of their most impolitic action by arguments and explanations at once vague and evasive, and it becomes the duty of any person acquainted with the circumstances to expose them Mr Mackenzie domes that a deputation of bankers waited upon the Government relative to this question (it is true, nevertheless) He admits, however, that subsequently he had some conversation with a bank manager Mr Palmer also concedes this, and gives some details of the interview The impression thus sought to be conveyed is that the Government upon variously, without any pressure o, or even their attention being directed to the subject by the banking interest, did, in March last, make the regulations the wisdom of which has been so freely canvassed ever since Now, what are the facts and Mr Mackenzie is challenged successfully to contradict them. About January of the present year a creditor of one of the banks withdrew £2000, and placed the sum to his account in the Government Savings Bank Now was commenced a direct attempt by the banks to have a regulation made prohibiting sums larger than £200 being received Mr Mackenzie had several conversa- tions (and I have no doubt correspondence passed with persons connected with the banks, one of whom was the manager of the A J S Bank For some time the attempt was ineffectual, until Mr Bank Manager excites the fears of the Treasurer by playing off upon his weak mindedness and ignorance of what the question really involved This was accomplished by invoking a financial hobgoblin This was highly successful, not only with the hon the Treasurer, but his sturdy colleague Mr Palmer, who gives a most graphic description of the apparition, his hair standing on end the while Here is the description, as recorded in your columns of this day - "If the Government had not limited the amount of deposits receivable at the Savings Bank, tons of thousands of pounds would have before long been paid into the bank, and great inconvenience would have arisen from the aud don w withdrawal of such large sums One banker had told him that he was prepared to pay just after the regulation complained of had appeared, £10,000 to the credit of the Savings Bank, with additional sums soon afterwards By passing that regulation the Savings Bank did not receive the heavy deposit, and consequently there was no inconvenience " I Willi in that all this took place antecedent and not subsequent to the 10th of Marh last, and further that a quasi compromise was arranged, and the maximum limit fixed at £500 instead of £200 The latter area was almost insisted upon, and among the forces employed a " counsel's opinion " was made to play its part in the drama Thus, however, was the terrible hobgoblin tmnpor;inly laid, and it becomes us to inquire why it was not invoked until January, 1868, for the Savings Bank Act (28 Vic , No 2) had been in operation since August, 1864, and Mr Manager might, during a period of nearly four years, at any time evident order to swamp the Government's depositing the tens of thousands of pounds sterling (so ostentatiously angled) to I his credit at The Government Bank Yet he I did nothing of the kind, he mercifully forbore, and only threatened to do so early in 1868 I Mr Mackenzie had a splendid opportunity of retorting the argument of the bank manager, and of exercising the ghost, for about this very time the directors of a certain colonial bank had issued their report, from which it appeared that the bank refused to had lost all its reserved fund, and castor oil more thun£60000 of its capital, over £21,000 of which sum was appropriated to a dividend of 8 per cent The Hon Treasurer might fairly have enquired whether the three- . tots of this unfortunate institution would have been very much alarmed if a few hundred new accounts had been opened, and some tons of thousands of pounds deposited and if so, what amount in slotting coin of the realm would be required to frighten them into saying, " Hold, enough " To ask the question is but to answer it Why, then, should the Treasurer proclaim that the colony of Queensland, with its immense resources in coin is of development, as well as those realised, cannot prudently be trusted with more than £500 to any single account at the Government Bank ? Because, for sooth, a arms, a rush, u ghost might appear I contend that a Queensland Government society is better certainly than that of such a limit us I have above referred to, and, to be modest, not inferior to that of the whole of them together To appropriate the language of the Hon. tho'TioaBuioi, I protest against his Bhoutuigout stinking fish (vide Treasurer's speech in Courts) of this date) any longer The obnoxious regulation will, I suppose, be laid before Parliament within the next fourteen days, when, it is to be hoped, that the Legislature will uuhoBitiitiiigly cancel it, and, as money is required by the Government, why not got as much of the people's cash as possible at £5 per I cent, instead of borrowing of the banks and others at eight and nine -Yours, Brisbane, August 5.
