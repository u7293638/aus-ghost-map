Mouxr pleasakt. rFrora our own Corresnondent.1 Mount Pleasant, October 21. In addition to a bal! we have lately had other festivities in this township, a large picnic party bavins assembled on Monday and spent part of the day at the Mount, which gives its name to tlie township, and which rises a couple of miles to the north of this. The party drove into the town ship seemingly in high spirits, and assembled afterwards at a private house, where the merri ment was kept up unflaggingly till late the follow ing morning. It will be seen that the good people of this neighbourhood are endeavouring to amuse themselves while they may, and enjoy the little space of liberty that remains to tiicm before the liard work of liarrest comes on. On Friday evening a young man called Royal on his way to school was thrown front his horse, which shied at some object in tbc road, and his left arm was broken between the wist and elbow. He was immediately attended by Dr. Youuida, and is in a fair way of recovery. Tile patient is rather unfortunate, as I believe it is little more than a year since lie had the other a broken by a fali from a dray. The Rev. A. 1!. Russell lias consented to lecture for our Institute on Monday next, when we expect an opportunity of hearing I he collection of ghost stories with which so many other districts are familiar, and as to the absolute truth of which so many people appear sceptical.
