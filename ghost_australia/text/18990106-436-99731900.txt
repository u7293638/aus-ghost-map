CHILDREN'S COLUMN, QHOST STORIES. HAUNTED HOUSES. What is most interesting about haunted houses is the persistence of the types of 'haunting' â€” the steps, knoekG, and rat tling chaina. From ancient Egypt and Anavrin. in thn DvnltR. the Anstr&lian; blacks, the Burmese, the Incas, the Vik ings of the Sagas, through Tedworth, Epworth (the Weslsys' Eectory), Wiliington Mill (the Proctor's), through ' Brownies,' in Major and Kirk, to yesterday's news paper, haunting is always ' the eam8 old game.' In dozens of cases, the tricks by servants, children, or smugglers, have been actually discovered. In other examples, rats, cats, wind, water, have been been detected in the act, as when Mr. Penys apprehended ' a sprtght,' and only found ' our young gib-cat.' Yet, while verae causae have been established, it is not quite honest to shirk the fact that often all search has failed in the most famous examples. The 'Wesley bogey ia well known. The evidence iB documentary, respectable, at first hand, and no system of explanation yet advanced is worth a brass button. Something may, .indeed, be done, if we start; from noises caused by tricks, and then suppose that fear and fanoy may set up a train of hal lucinations. Any reader of old Mr. Wes ley's letters and diary may read one of the best ghost stories ever written. He was, of course, Samuel, the father ot. the cele brated John and Charles Wesley, and the whole family, including his famous sons, were witnesses of the doings of the ' ghost,' and their testimony ia of the most un doubted order.
