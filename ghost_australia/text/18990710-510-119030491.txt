WHY WEDDINGS IX HAY Altli UNIXTK1. It has been considered to be unlucky to he married in May ever since the days of OviJ. In ancient Rome there was beld in May a festival called Lemuria, or feast of the Le mprps- whinh w.is a eeremonv in honour of the Speeches of Departed Souls. It became with the llomans what we should call ' bad form ' to have matrimonial feasts at the season of a solemn ritual, be ing no doubt, thought to be an insult to the dead to marry at Fuch a time. From this a number of stories grew of the revenge made by the outraged ghosts upon those who dared to disregard them, and if any thing unfortunate happened to a couple who had been married in May it would, of course, have been put down to retri bution. So the tradition of ill luck arose, and its influence has lasted, ever since, even to our time.
