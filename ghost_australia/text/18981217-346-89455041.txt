She is smiling now: .smiling bJcau;:c she knows T'lnvve done the work. She will always smile now, and it is I who must weep. Ah, keep her away ■ " she cried, ■ clinging to his arm for protec tion. The wind caught up her words and whirled them away jiiiiiml. The jsoundroused. the marsh biTiis i:ito grim croaking.-:, and a dis tant dog began to lurk. Oliver saw that it was time to end the scene. '• Ro," he said, calmly, as an idea struck him, "you don't know what you're saving. Mr. Aitken ain't--killed-at all. I met-him going back, to 'The Anchor'; and 'e asked me to bring you bacic to 'im at once. Come. This way." " The story was clumsy enough, but it had the desired effect. " Not dead ?J'"shir cried: " IIare'I been dreaming then ? Oh, take me to him at onco." And she started" hurriedly along the river bank towards the village. Oliver followed, congratulating himself on the way in' which circumstances had favored his plans. ■ Only a short way down the river Tom Debney would be wailing with the boat, and once get the girl into that it would be easy enough to keep her quiet. She had ■ a shawl round her head .already. - - ■■ Her delusion seemed to endow her with niore than human strength. He had the greatest diiliculty ill k' • ling pace with her, so rapid was her walk, and- though he him self continually stumbled and tripped the girl never made a false step. She seemed by instinct to avoid the places where the edge of the bank was worn away and the danger of falling ■ into the river was imminent. Straight. and s wift she hurried on, and Oliver's only fear was le: t he should fall too far behind to-be ready tit the first sign of the boat. Thoy had readied .1 point about half-way between the village and the studio when he heard the soft dip of oars in the water, and peering through the darkness made out the dim form of a boat that v.as being pulled up stream against the rapidly ebbing tide. Rohilla had stopped, and was gazing fixedly at the boat. "Who are you ?" she asked. There was no answer. "Tom! Is that you, Tom?" said Oliver. .. . . "Ay," said Tom, without turning round ; and his voice sounded strangely husky and nervous. " Bring i'er in -quick,- then. I-'ll- gefc- the girl down 'ere." - He turned to Rohilla and said softly, " Come' into the boat, Ilo, and we'll take you to Miv Aitken." For a moment she seemed inclined to comply/ She held- out her hand-that he might support her into the boat; but in.the darkness she caught hold, not of his hand, but of something that was sticking in his belt. She shrank back wi..h a scream of horror. ■ ; In an instant he had covered her head with Jier -'shawl, and seeing that she still struggled he wrenched the cl'.'b from his belt and struck. It was but a light blow, but her head;fell like a flower with a broken stalk. He lifted-her into the bout. "I 'oped you'd come aboard*quiet," he muttered.' "But you wouldn't. Make another sound and I'll silence you to some purpose."; The girl lay motionless in his arms. Stretching her along the bottom of the boat, he propped her head against the thwart. It drooped sideways limp and helpless. "'Urry up, Tom," he said." But- the advice was needless. Tom was rowing down the ebb with all his strength. "We must get 'er aboard quick, and see to 'er. She ain't much 'urt though, luckily. We might 'have'ad far more trouble with 'er." On that rapid ebb it needed but a few strokes to bring the boat just above the landing-stage of the ferry, at the end of the village green. There was a light ■ in the parlor-window of "The Anchor." . I "Quiet, Tom," said Oliver, as the swing ing rowlocks grated in their sockets. But he ' was over-nervous. The howling of the wind drowned all lesser sounds, and. Jhe brown waves began to lap ovar the. side of the boat. Oliver bent over the proctrate form of . Rohilla to wrap her more closely in her shawl.. . . , ' . When he -looked up it was with a cry of apprehension. ■ •-, ........... "Look out, man ! Where.are you going?" he asked." • ; ' For almost within ' reach of liis hand loomed the stone pier of the laiuling-stage. "Pull your loft, man," he shouttd. "Your left, ,'ard!" ■ \ • But Tom took no notice. ' Oliver sprang- towards - the bow ot the. boat. ■ ' •' • —— " ifcj...Arp,you .drunk?." lie.cried., " (jive m<j the sculls." . . But Tom merely doubled with greater' force over his work... A strong._p.ull of the righ.t shot;the bows of the boat towards the banV, a little holding with the left brought her to against the; pieT. 'Tom shipped iii.v sculls and; leapeel aslior.e with Uie pr.iriter rn his hand. I ^ . A stream of-curses bu£st from Oliver's lips and then a sudden silence...., . For the-'first time he lookpij. straight at tho supposed To.ni: Debney, and saw. in an instant that lie had fallen into a trap. The man's sou'-wester was pulled forward over his tape, and the collar of his pea-jacket turned up, "but".as he stooped over the painter, making it . .fast with "strong, deft pulls to a ring in the pier, it became evident thafc he was not Tom Debney at all. Oliver sprang forward to seize the painter; but he had 110 knife to cut it with. ' He tried to leap ashore ; but his foot struck against the lifeless form of the girl in tlie bottom of the boat. He staggered aiid the boat lurched. He tried again to save him self, but could not. Tho boat rocked and swayed; and after a fierce ineffectual struggle to regain.his balance, he fell. His head struck against the stones qf the pier.;. Then the black rushing water closed over him and he knew no more.' ' CHAPTER XXIII. — ' - :r ~ The Little Box. ,. ' /When the company returned to "The Anchor " after watching the working of the new light,* they had no thought of staying long. The absence of Aitken and Rohilla took away their chief interest, and one and all were beginning to think of making their way home to bed, ^Vhentlic entranee'of Tom Debney once more roused the embers of joviality. :. . : Tom had been absent from Alderswylcc for some time, and-it was the duty of every man to stand liim treat. Moreover, Tom was a jolly companion, a teller of good stories, and loud laughter, and it was some time before the merrymaking, to which Oliver had lis tened outside the window, showed signs of abating. For Tom Debney, as: soon as his heart was warmed by the generosity, of his friends, insisted on returning their kindness, and plunging his hand into his- pocket brought out the bank-note just given him by Oliver Magub. Tho sight of Tom with so much money caused great excitement,; and Tom seemed to have no hesitation in spend ing it right and left. Glass after glass was filled and emptied, and the uproarious merri ment made the time fly. Gradually, however, sleepiness began to creep over most of the revellers. One by one they dropped out of the circle, till but three were left with Tom.' Then two more de parted together, and only one, Jack Briggs, stayed to keep up the ghost of a happy even ing, and mako further inroads into Tom Debney's wealth. " Whatover's comu over young Jack fo ni'jht?" said Mrs. Twaddell aside to hor hiisbrnd. "I never sac him drink like this before. Don't seem fuddled, though, neither." ■ "Not lie," said William. "lom'sa bit on, but there's no call for me to interfere, and it wants fifteen minute:; of closing time yet." " "Well," Slid Mrs. Twaddell with a yawn, "I do hope Ro won't be out long. That child out to have stopped in her bed as X told her. And her wedding day to-morrow, too ! " For some time sho sat knitting on one side of the fireplace; while William sat smoking on the other. Jack Briggs and his friend at the far end of the room were very quiet; and a glance out of the corner of her eye showed Mrs. Twaddell that Tom, by now not. far from splendidly drunk, was whispering some long story in Jack Briggs's ear. .She tried to catch what- he was saying, but could not, She noticed, however, that though Jack repeatedly slapped his thigh and protended to bo hugely amused, his face was really grave -„nd anxious. • At last he rose. "Come outside, Tom," he said, "and tell me all about it. That's a good yarn, and I'd like to 'car the end of it. Well, good-night, mum; good-night," Mr. Twad dell." — And steadying Tom's steps by the aid of his strong aim,- helyft-the-room. • For half-an-hour more Mrs. Twaddell yawned and knitted in her corner, and .William yawned and smoked in the chimney; but there was no sign of Rohilla's return. Mrs. Twaddell fidgetted, but it was no use talking to! William when he-was ill-(hat state. One could not get him to worry about anything when he had his grog by his side and his pi]e':in his mouth. But at last she could keep silence ho longer. " William," she said, returning to her old formula, '' I'm'SuTeTfOpl'flethirg's up." - William grunted. "I never knew the child stay out so late as this before^ AmITwKarwTtlr'heT''Coining down out of her bed like 'chat, and wanting to go for a walk, and what with Mr. Aitken's story, and [Oliver Magub turning up again like that so sudden, I don't know what to make of it.!'

Why, he's' as honest as the day's long." - "All right, mis3us," said the imperturb able William. "I know you're soft on him." "Well, William, if that's all you've got to say, I shan't stop to hear any more. - I shall go to bed,' ana you'll have to sjt up for Ro by yourself. And mind you give her a good scolding wljien she does come in." And the good lady flounced out of the room, ;>retending to care no mere about Iiohilla's Absence, but knowing perfectly well that she would not sleep a wink till her return. Scarcely Iiad his wife left-the room, when Wil'tam lieard—T...tap._at . .the door. lie opened it,'and saw outside tho pale face of Jack Briggs. . ' . ' ' "Can I speak to you iv moment, Mr., Twaddell?." said he. "I'll do it 'ere if I may. I didn't "like to talk before Mrs. Twaddell for fear of frightening her. So I waited till;I see 'er go to bed." ; " What's "tlie""matter, then, Jack ? •" said Mr. Twaddell. . ^ " 'Tis this, sir. I kept Tom Dehnev 'ere o'purpose;; 'cos from something 'e.let drop soon after, 'e ccime ■ in, I knew 'e 'adn't got all that money out of . the ship, and that Oliverwas1 mixed up with 'im in some bit o' devilry.

Debneyof, the-plot to carry-oft' Rohilla, oil board his ship. " Tom's lying dead drunk down' by the ferry, sir; and Oliver, so far as I know, 'as zone up:.the river bank after Mr. Aitken and Ro. ^ 1 tell you what I'll do, sir.. I'll take Tom's' boat and row up; and would you. mind walking along the bank in the same direstion, ; just -'keeping mo in earshot V 'Tw ill be 'ard if we don't get there in time to ■ prevent the mischief, between us. And if we can ub it without attracting anyone's attention, so much the better. We don't want all tlie village talking." ."Right!" said Mr. Twaddell, briefly. "You run on and get the boat up, Jack, and I'll get my hat and come ait once." "Oh, never mind your 'at!" Jack im plored. "We may be too late as it is." But W illiam—was-n0t-«oing to-be hurried for any consideration, and repeated his in tention of getting his hat.' " Besides," lie-added, -" we want a lan tern." . Jack hurried away in anxious disgust, while the' landlord returned to the parlor. He reached his hat from a peg on tho door, lighted the lantern, and was just on • the point of starting/ when )t struck him that he might need some othw";.v«Vp'oii than that of his own ! herculean sfci'o.ngfcii. He looked round-for;the "chaiiman's hammer " of that' night; bitt could not .find_.it, and was.won dering where it could be; when lie heard his wife's voice -calling him. '• •./■ " vVilliim !

' " The scene had been short, but meanwhile. Jack Briggs was pulling with all his strength up stream, too impatient to wait for Mr. Twaddell's help. And thus it came to pass that the landlord, with a lantern in his hand, had but just reached the river-bank by the landing-stage, when Jack stepped ashore with the lifeless form of Rob ilia in his arms. " You've got her, J'auk ?.. Well done, lad. Little doubt but what Mr. Aitken '11 make it well worth your while to have saved her." " If she's dead, I've done no good. If she lives, I've saved \\-.r, and that's enough for me." And there was a sob in Jack's voice. Mr. Twaddell thought it best to say 110 more. lie saw that the young man's love was too strong c-ven for jealousy. He had and that was his reward ! "Where's Ohver ?"'" asked tiie landlord. L'Y>r answer Jack .shoo], his head. At that moment, not fifty yards from ivhere they were standing, Olivers lifeless body lay wedged between two broken piles in the old harbor, and in his belt was the " chairman's hammer." " You didn't " "JSTo," said Jack. "ISo need to touch, him. 'E came for me, and fell overboard There wa:> no saving 'im." "We shall know to-morrow. Come along, lad, anrl bring the girl into the house. The missus'll see to her, while we go and look for Mr. Aitken. You didn't see anything of him ? " "Nothing." Silent and sad, with the girl's still help less body .between them, they crossed the green and! entered the door of the irn. It was some time before they had carried her up the narrow stairs to her own room, whore Mrs. Twadjdoll was busy lighting a fire. A brief glance .showed Mrs. TVaddell that the girl was not dead, and in the happiness of that iy-v.\3 Jack would .-willingly have lingered all night, 011 the chance of getting ! one look o| recognition from her eyes. But the moment came when male hands were no longer of service, and Mrs. Twaddell asked them to leiivo her alone with the girl. " Come,1, Jack," said the landlord : and added, as tjioy descended the stairs together, " P!c;is>!;God, he's not in the w<~.ter !" •It cost .J|ick a pang to answer " Ay," but he said it stoutly, and inwardly vowed to do his utmost! to tind the man who was to rob liiin of all hope. But the} vow was needless. For as they reached thidoorof the inn they both stopped, dead to listen. Above tne howling of the angry wind came a human cry, faint but unmistakable. Bomethingjwas lying on the grass, near the river bank,- moaning feebly. For a moment all presence of mind de serted thciji. On. this night of terror they had begun! to distrust the xery cryj.of the wind; imd Ihe incessant winking of the great eye in th<j heavens was' alone sufficient to unsteady sample nerves.
