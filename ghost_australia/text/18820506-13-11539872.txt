LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR OWN OOnitlBPONDENT.) LOKDON, MATton 21. The immense prices which old booka und old china fetch never fail to aatouud ina , in the former co.se I find it difficult to imagine tue condition of mind of the purchaser in tho latter I find it impossible There seems the same sort of absence of all pro portion ni tho matter which one sees in a child s first attempts at drtwing Two thou sand five hundred pounds were given the other day for a blue jar that could never hare hold half the money Whore does the plea sure come from m spending a B_n.ll fortune on such a thing' Ia it derived from the more possession of it, or from the contení plation of it' Docs the happy proprietor hug it exclaiming, ' This ia miue- mino' or doea he aolaco htmaelf with the reflection " Although of clay myself and not generally thought "ood looking I am not so n_ly as this! On the other hand some things as tomah na by the smallness of the Burna tiley fetch Hunk of tho whole contenta of the poor old I olytechnic having realised only £2 500 the prico of that ono Iittlo ugly pot When I it IIB a boy the treasures of that place Beemed priceless The electrical machine which could have thrown tho elephant Jumbo into cona tilaiona, and which omitted sparks of fire on the very least provoc itlon, I thought must have been worth a million at least V hy the electrical eel, BO long aa he lived would never have been parted with under five figures And the diving bell ' Who

noble tree would have been an interesting object in one B gatden I suppose eveu Pepper a ghost went for some Bhadow) aura Poor Pol I wonder whether it waa the excitement about Jumbo which haa produced the idea of a public cemetery for domestic animals pets Such a notion haa actually come into being, with a chairman, secretary, and a board of directora Only a few shareholders are wanting to make it complete Of courae one a peta must be buried and with decency and reBp°ct, but aurely not in a public place' The ono great advantage of having four footed nud feathered frienda ia that when they die their bones can still rest near us I have a dot, and cat which I would not ex chango for a dozen Jumbos, nor sell to any Darnum living, but I am certainly not going to invest money in the purchaae of a " roolo gical grave for ihem m the Cemetery for Peta, where any ruffian may make fun of the inscriptions on their little tombstones I Buppose it ia rather shocking out it ia vory true that the deaths of our dumb favountea affect ÜB far more than those of our ordinary acquaintances, nor doea it Boom much less likely that we shall meot them again There is nothing that makes the vtviaoctiomats BO generally despised, as well aa loathed, aa their incapability for understanding the ¡affection between men aud anímala They have only one notion of the Brute, which ia tho oue I entertain of them A very eminent geologist informa me that if the public knew aa much of the matter as he doea, they would not diatreaa themselves about the dangers of the Channel Tunnel in the matter of invasion There ia no example known, ha Bays, of o geological valle)-such B3 the Tunnel engineers are dealing with without cracks m it, and that, sooner or later, the Tunnel itaelf will be invaded by a much more formidable foe than the Trench Directora may speechify and chain pague may foam, but no one will ever come from Trance, or go thither dryahod The workmen may go a little way, but only aa rharoah a liOBt did through the Red Sea I BuppoBo there are abielda for them to work behind, aa there were in the construction of the Uhames Tunnel, but for my part I Bhould have very little confidence in a shield with the waters of the Chin nel demanding admittance at it and my self some 13 mileB and u half from land At the foot of the excavation at I olkestone I would not mind doing a little submarine work, but I Bhould Btipulute for hiving one band always on a rung of the lalder and nobody Btopping the way One can easily imagine the rl.sire of Mr Bugg, of name changing memory, to ndop *be patronymic of Iloward lhere muât be something depressing to any mau influenced b) associations in the possession of an absurd or hideous name There is a poet-and n good one-of the name of Bigg, but I doubt whether any one called Bugg could bj a poet, even if be were born one Never thelesa, if Milton'a or Shalcapeare a name had chanced to be Bugg, we mi.ht think differ ently upon this subject The name of Dickens ia not one of itself to inspire admira tion, but genius has surmounted that little obstacle The author of that charming book of anecdotes and reflections called Patch oorl Rives an example of the curious effects of Bpelhng in nomenclature There lives near him a greengrocer of the name of Peraey as he sees it over the shop door there seems no thing incongruous, Bince the lettera do not recall the great house of Northumberland , bnt if he reads it aloud, the coincidence of sound at once awakes a sense of the re diculouB Though aa I have aaid it is easily con ceivablo that a man should wish to change his name without having any reason to evade the police I can t imagine the inhabitants of 9\. town being solicitous to have thal called by a new title Hie dwellers in Slough, however, are agitating to get it called "Upton Koyal, I suppose from Slough having the dictionary meaning of morosa But the town of Slough haa ao long existed that tho original senBe of the word haa

A faithful friend, who haa obeyed the written wishes of a deceased perron by get ting him reduced to oshea and buried ¡n an Ltruacan vase, has had to pay for the3e costly ntea out of hia own pocket a he dead mans family, who were not in favour of cremation would not defray the expenses This aeema, I muBt Bay, hard If the dead man had written, "Unle83 my body ia thus disposed of, my property Bhall go to So and BO, their BcruploB would, doubtless, have given way Tor a time, at leaät the idea of cremation has gone out ot fashion in this country, but it does seem strange, though a dead man a wish has power to do BO much-and often so much harm-it cannot ensure the disposition of his own lemamB To my mind, it is ao attractive notion to keep the ashes of those we loved in our own poasossion, and not to let the wintry rama at night beat upon their gravea, but at all events, where people are allowed to do BO very much as they please " with their own ' as] they are in England, thia late decision of I the law Béeras marvellous indeed I wonder why it ia the lawyers are always 80 antagonistic to the church, and indeed to Christian folks generally Is it really that they are irreligious persona or ia the phr ne ' Then came certain lawyers tempting Hun, spoken Borne 2,000 yeara ago, still rankling' At all arenta the Bench-with tho exception of the Colendgea, ;>_reci fila-has always set ita faco against the cloth. Tho conversation between tho judge, in the Lamaon caso tho other day, and the foreman of the jury waa an example of thia The foreman saul that some of the jury wanted to go to (¡burch on Sunday Might they do ao' "Certainly,"replied the judge with suavity, "twice, if they hU ii, only remember they must be of ono mind All must go or nona Which, considering that ho must have boen well aware that there was a Jow among the 12, was not granting a good deal Sometimes, though very seldom, the law j ere get the worst of it A certain li^ht of the Scotch bar, who had ohanged bia liberal opinioimfor toryisuj, was bitterly inveighing in the presence of a clergyman agamst a political opponent " Very true, air, ' aaid the parson, " but matters might have been worse; he ti an Irishman, but he miclit bare been a Scotchman , he i. a rebel, but he might have been a rene gade , ho ia a priest, but ho might have been a lawyer Which, it must be owned, was very neat.
