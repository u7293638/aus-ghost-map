ACADEMY OF MUSIC. There was a brilliant assemblage at the Academy of Music last night, when Mr W. J. Holloway took his farewell beuefit, on the occasion of his departure on a two years’ tour through the colonies and New Zealand. The large hall was packed from floor to ceiling, with an audience quick to notice an excellency in acting, and to applaud it. The play chosen was “ Hamlet,” in which Mr W. J. Holloway is well known to a Ballarat audience. His performance last night was, if anything, better than on previous occa sions. He was at all times forcible, without ‘ ‘ o’erstepping the bounds of nature. Miss Essie Jenyns undertook the part of Ophelia, and played as she always does, with grace, spirit, and naturalness . Mr H. Hodson as Polonius, Mr H. R. Jewett as the king, and Mrs.W. J. Holloway as the queen, all acted well. Mr C. Holloway doubled as the ghost and the grave-digger, and was successful in the latter part. The other characters were well filled. A departure from the usual style of ghost scene, in the interview between Hamlet and his defunct father was made. The dialogue served to introduce a fine rocky scene, that did credit to the scenic artist. This innovation on the ordinary style of stage ghost colloquys is certainly more in keeping with the text of the play, and decidedly more effective. The play was well mounted throughout.' Mr Holloway’s reception last night was as flattering as it was well deserved, and formed a most fitting close to a successful season. The company leave by the first train for Melbourne this morning en route for Tasmania, where Mr Holloway will open the new theatre at Launceston on Saturday night.
