AMONGST THE NEW ZEALAND . , MOUNTAINS. By Telemachus, ? AT WAKATIPU. I have a friend who on rare occasions introduces a select circle to some spirits of the great departed JJe compels the spirits to his will-at least be tells us so-and their natural voices proceed from his lips The task, however, is difficult, and not accomplished with out frequent refreshers One evening, after a good many notabilities had expressed them- selves through our medium a more than ordinarily august personage was named But the reply was, "If you want him we must have champagne lean do the others very well with beer or whisky), but I could not do him without champagne ' I am not prepared to any that he succeeded very well with the champagne, prayer and fasting might have been a better preparation But his idea was all right, he required a higher stimulus a nobler inspiration lit, felt as one feels who ascends from the hum of city life and the commonplace attractions of Exhibition work and festival, to the greater glory of New Zealand, which is found in the majestic heights of her mountains, the pro found depths of her lakes Tat over towards the western coast the lakes are found running as a broken chain of inland seas about the eastern feet of the mighty peaks, whose western fronts are towards the Pacific Ocean thence the long arms of the fjords reach in, and receive the snow torrents and the eternal glacier rivers thundering over rock faces, or roaring through forests, with voices worthy of their mighty parentage, everlasting and ever grand Pukaki and Ohau, Wanaka and Wakatipu, Te Anau, Manapouri, and Hauroto are the most notable of these lakes. Each one a great sheet of pure snow water, or a basin father, whose bed is deep down as that of the ocean fjords on the west 'the lead line dropped in Wakatipu s centre, goes down 1500ft The eye gazing aloft to Earnshaw or the Cosmos peaks, looks through more than U 000ft of atmosphere All aloft is ice and snow, and all below a mystery of intense and deathly cold, which Melds nothing to any investigation and has never given up its dead Mysterious in its pro fundit), awful in its immediate environment, desolate, weird, vast, Dantesque-so Wakatipu impresses and depresses one when for the first time seen from Kingston or Queens town, the southern and the middle port The Waimea Plain narrows into a gorge at Kingston, barren hills on either side, and all that remains of the Morning of the ancient glacier stretched like an artificial mound across its mouth 'the pure blue water laps a pebbly beach, the train comes right along side, the lake steamer receives the passengers, and on the evening of the day on which the eastern ocean port is reached the traveller may be gliding over the blue deeps between the mountain walls, towards the ice peaks and the snow crowns, the jewelled head of New Zealand, which proclaims the little island a prince amongst all Australasian peers Close beside the one hotel at Kingston uses a rock wall a thousand feet, almost perpendicular, a sparse scrub growth, dotted with cabbage palms, creeps up the crannies, but all along the ridge the unclothed rock is frowning On the opposing side the mountain face is clothed with bracken and coarse grass, and the ridge lies against the sky, sloping gracefully and rising into occasional peaks There is nothing which can be termed failure on either hand in the two light, a steely sky above, a lake which, till struck by the steamers prow, is us a single sapphire below, mountain walls on either side, which seem only less dead and cold and barren than the towering ice cliffs of the earth's poles The puffing, barking, merry steamer seems an intruder here, a single Maori pulling a long canoe would be more appropriate 'the cook and the steward and the aroma of Melbourne are almost as incongruous as '"Arty" on the Great Pyramid or Paul Pry about the feet of the Sphinx.

A new development, however, is talked about a new plan of winning muni tes8iraally small quantities of gold from enormous quantities of drift The scene of operation is the Shotover River, and toward the Shotover we travelled A fair enough road considering the nature of the country. Westward, around the lake, abreast the Remarkable, past the village of Franktown, where is the local hospital, and also the new outlet of the lake, a great cataract, dram ing away some portion of the waters which stream down the bills in a thousand star acts, and flow perpetually from the glaciers on Earnshaw Every body in the district believes that the ancient outlet wits by the old moraines below Kingston, and they assert that a steady current sets that way, still percolating through the drift and spreading out under all the broad Waimea plains The river of ice went that way be and all doubt, and found the sea somewhere on the cold shores of revenue Straits What, indeed, but glacial action could have formed that strange mound of a he must Huge boulders of granite, beds of cement, layers of drift, all mixed together higgledy piggledy, just us in primeval days they were gathered by the avalanche, frozen in the ice river, and launched from the morning Round about the hamlet, and, indeed, on every patch of fair and accessible country the miners have taken up t irons instead of claims, their green fields brightening the somewhat dreary landscape, and their gardens making pleasant resting places by the dusty roadside Wonderfully hospitable folks too, ore these farmers and permanent residents in the mountains Every stranger who comes to their door is welcome Even the man who keeps a public house takes his sixpence for a drink, and then bids you go into the garden and eat for nothing a shilling's worth of cherries. I saw a dozen visitors roaming at will in a garden, treading down the potatoes, plucking the cherries, pulling roses, and lupins, and sweet peas, and the man of the house looking on quite content. They seem to enjoy themselves, ' he said " Poor folks they don't get a chance of the like of that in Melbourne " As, in case, they do not, nor yet in Australia, for, speaking broadly, we Australians are not a truly hospitable people V e stick, close enough to the old Scotch proverb of greasing the fat sow, and we are ready enough to bid those to our feast who will bid us in turn unto theirs, but, except in our highlands and cold country we do not under stand hospitality aright. It is a product, I think, of cold weather and indoor life, but it will only take root and grow in the genial soil of kindly, unselfish, unostentatious nature We came on little Lake Hayes, a couple of hours from Queenstown, a jewel of waters, crowded with trout, amongst the brown hills patched with green, and by lunch time we were down at Arrowtown, where a digging community still lives and prospers The dirty river comes swirling around the bends, always in a hurry, broad beds of shingle are on either side of the water, and beyond them rises a mountain range, bare of timber, and poorly grassed, a race cut parallel with its ridge 2000ft from the river, testifying to the enterprise and pluck of the miners of old There is nothing but lunch to detain us a Arrowtown, and very little that is either grand or significant on the road traversed later on Flats which look rather sour than rich , hard, poor bulls, which aspire in vain to the mountains, deep, cruel gorges, their native bareness all unclothed , mud running rivers, still busy in their depths cutting faster than nature comes to clothe, and then a single island, almost surrounded by the hills in which has been commenced the "new mining" Bearing along sand and shingle, and crumbled down mountain material of all sorts, the river has entered by a gorge at the one end, and, spreading itself over some hundreds of acres of flat, has through centuries made a vast shingle bed, in the depths of which are embedded whatever of gold or metallic substances has beononginally held in the matrices of the bills Hundreds of millions of tons are deposited here, and it has long been known that it contained a little gold But it would not pay for the working many ordinary way The first diggers tried it, and left diBgusted Chinamen came, and cradled, and sluiced, and paddocked, but could do no good-the ordinary Chinamen, that is. It was left for an extraordinary man of that race to devise means which will probably bring to him fortune, and open up we know not what opportunities of development throughout the island His notion was to dredge the stuff and wash it as raised-not exactly a new idea, for dredges were worked successfully in the Molineux River 20 years ago But he set about the matter in rather a new style His dredge was to be worked by steam power, and to be utterly independent of the ordinary current of the river It was also to be worked with a minimum of labour, and once established on the scene of operation, to cut its own way. To manage this, an excavation had first to be made in the shingle bed, in which the barge containing the dredge and pumping machinery was placed The steel lipped buckets run against the shingle face ahead, each picks up its load as the stuff falls, from a maximum depth of 50ft, bears it aloft, and tips it into a sluice box about 20gr. loan, sloping gradually, and turning under than almost equal length beneath 1 sat as the stuff is tipped by the dredge buckets into this sluice box, a powerful head of water is poured on to it by the pumps, and down in a cataract go pebbles, sand, and whatever particles of gold may be mixed with them A Chinaman with a miner's fork pitches out the big pebbles and stones, all the remainder is carried down and around the bend, and out at the other end All but the gold. Even the incessant rush of the water cannot carry this away It is held in the ripples of the box. it is collected easily enough when the day's work is done, and it amounts now from this one machine to 10oz. per day. Ten ounces per day, and recovered from something like 1,200 tons of stuff ! In that statement is the crux and the significance of the business With very little labour-four hands, I think, on the shift-the dredge will put through 50 tons an hour, and then such a result as three grains to the ton will give returns which must grow rapidly to a fortune. About three grama to the ton they are getting on the Shotover now, and it is tolerably sure that as much will be got over all this shingle bed, or island And if in the Shotover, why not in half a dozen other rivers'' That is the question which is agitating New Zealand just now. For over the South Island there are now beds and shingle drifts millions of acres in extent and from 20 to 200 in depth Wherever they have been washed down from auriferous Inila they must hold gold, but in such small quantities as by all processes hitherto employed to be unpayable Even as the quartz to the miner of three decades ago, so may these vast shingle beds have been to the miner of yesterday And yet a few years hence we may see them worked to as much profit as the best of the quartz reefs, and if so we shall see Now Zealand forge ahead once more and make cities of her villages, and win back from us all the population she lost a year or two ago, and from the outer world folks enough to consume all the produce she can raise And Mr Sue Hoy, with his dredge in the bed of the Shotover, is to be the beginning of all this When will a Collingwood or a Bourke street larrikin begin any thing of the sort Home to the village by the lake when the dredge had been inspected, rattling along a very good road, swinging round to a very high bridge, and running down a long gorge to the very edge of the waters. And then there was dinner and dispute, but the former I first, good Mrs Lichitrdt, her ripe and rosy t face shining like the silk of her dress, superintending the distribution of soup and trout, and lamb and green peas, and straw berries and cream Toa lover of good fruit, it would be almost worth a pilgrimage to the lake to eat of Mrs Richards a strawberries. I quite believe the people now, who tell me that if good strawberry was never eaten in Melbourne, but utterly disbelieve that Scotchman who asserts that the best in the world are grown at Aberdeen The best in the world are grown at Queenstown, on Imito Wakatipu They must be the best, for strawberries could not be better A small one in the size of a walnut, a big one makes three bites, and they are red, rich crimson without, and deep pink within, and lustrous and cold, delicious in flavour, and in aroma divine Moreover, there is a plateful beside every guest, You may take one, as a slice of watermelon to prepare your palate for the meal, you may take another, us an olive, between the courses, and you may finish the plateful before you leave the table, and then get up and find an answer to the question, "Well, and what can t you stay in Queenstown''' " Man shall not live by strawberries alone," may be the answer, but straightway comes the reply, " Look at that What is that, ' It is Ben Lomond. It towers aloft 6000ft from its summit you shall look out almost to the western seas You shall see 1 Ernshaw and the cosmos and the Humboldt ranges, and beyond all the glorious cone of Mount Aspiring All the lake shall be at your feet, and all the lower hills shall spread themselves beneath you It is a marvellous, a glorious a stupendous panorama So the people of Queenstown speak of Ben Lomond, and I have no doubt that all they say is true Indeed, I have no right to doubt them, for I did not make the ascent of Ben Lomond I have no passion for climbing up a mountain to look out on a view One has to feet up enough mountains in the ordinary way of life, and always sees more than it is possible to remember So I did not do Ben Lomond , but do not for a moment suppose that I desire to dissuade anybody else from that task Go right up, my friend, and see glory and win fame, though there will not be much of the latter, for you can ride a horse within "ten , minutes of the mountain head ' 1 We do not, however, escape by discarding Ben Lomond Look at the Remarkable I have looked a good deal, and with much interest and pleasure and pain I would rather have named those mountains Les Miserables than the Remarkable they remind one of some other bills once well described as " consecrated to the genius of suffering, they are bold in form, massive, lofty They rise with a terrible precipitancy 7,8ft from the water's edge but they are naked , they are like poor wretches stripped for torture They are under a curse and a ban borne god has spoken it over them, "Let no grass or herb grow on thee for ever They are blasted, furrowed, seamed, excoriated. Their face reminds one of the back of one of those old convicts whose nervous system, and consequent sense they, had been destroyed by innumerable Hoggings. Yon might well imagine them to be the bulk of some litan fettered there under everlasting doom It is sober truth that after facing the Remarkable for a while I find it necessary to go back and look at rubicund Mrs Richards, in order to recover my belief that there is a good God in the world. or I should think in that good lady and that awal mountain the two extremes of creative genius are reached And yet the Remarkable are very grand, emblems of strength, as pictures of Desoza iron, works worthy of the hand of a mighty and mysterious nature, mainstays of the fabric of the world Meet are they, also, to tower above this lonely, beautiful, mysterious lake For there are strange true stories told of Lake Wakatipu I have said that it never returns its dead, and all evidence tends to corroborate this statement Many and many a man has been drowned here, but not one who went down in deep water has ever been recovered or restore 1 You ask the reason, and meet with divers answers home say the under current, which flows away to the southern end of the lake, bears them down, and ultt mutely buries them in the shingle or drift of the bottom It may be, but again there is a better reason given The water is intensely cold, fed by the glacier stream for ever flowing out of Mount Earnshaw Is it not possible that the cold may be so intense in the depths to which the body sinks, as to in the first instance, numb the faculties, and after death, to prevent all decomposition' "When we sent down the lead 1 GOLL ' save an old mariner of theakeR, and got bottom, it came up deadly cold, and the tallow in the lead. was harder than any stearine candle It would bring up nothing What then ' Are the bodies of all those drowned equally hard' It may be Professor W ville Thompson gave it as his opinion that the bodies of men buried in Bhotted hammocks in the deep waters of the Pacific stand erect there as they alighted, preserved for ever from decay by the enormous water pressure Upright on a hard rock floor may be, even of these others, at rest on the icy bed of Wakatipu Will they remain thus for ever ' Who knows " Every where heard will be the judgment call An old Victorian got hold of me in Queenstown with a request to go to the head of the lake He said he was an old Victorian do not set that forward us any guarantee of his veracity. I indeed, know many old Victorians who, in the way of tale pitching, would not give in to a down easter-or Pacific slope man- without u try But this Mr Burley was a good old miner who had prospected the Goulburn and the Buckland and all the western slopes of our great divide, and had not found much gold, who had come over to New Zealand and settled down about these mountain heads , who had a very little luck at digging, and had at length taken up the business of hotel keeping, and with his son of guiding travellers and conducting tourists about the mountain heads. "It is all at the head of the lake, be said Do we not sometimes hear something like "It is all in Melbourne Mountains, glaciers, forests, waterfalls, you must come to the head of a lake " And to the head of the lake we went the Lake Company's steamer bore us thither , a good fast boat, specially put on by Captain Wing to take up a contingent of Victorian legislators I believe in the end they had some trouble about the price of the charter, which may have been high, but it would be reasonable for travellers to remember that running boats on Lake | Wakatipu is not just like running them in Port Phillip The first cost is about three times as much, and the chance of employment as one to ten perhaps It was a marvel to me to find such steamers on this far inland lake, so fast, as well found, and also well provedore, and at a reasonable price [ We steamed away at the sunset, we saw The Remarkable, a bar of gold on their summits, though there was a deep gloom over the lake We saw the light die off the hills and out of the sky, and the mighty walls shut in about us on the pre I vious evening We marked the moon come up over a long serrated ridge, and as sheeted ghost- we caught glimpses of the mighty snow peaks far away. We saw lights twinkling on heights along the shore, and on the waters where fishermen were busy I lay on the deck, and marked the majesty of form as revealed by the increasing moonlight, valley and spur came out, flakes of snow listened on the summits, a little wind rustled the bracken which clothed the mountain's feet, and with incessant pant and throb the sturdy little steamer went along Away into dream land again I or we could only conjure up pictures of what should be seen at the lakes head It was dreamland Indeed when we arrived there For there is no telegraph wire to the head of the lake the whole place was asleep. It was nearly midnight, and while lights and fires were kindling, and prepara- tions making to house so large a party, there was opportunity to look out and see what roar the moonlight might reveal Looking right across the water then, a mightier mountain wall than any we had seen before seemed to rise, abrupt, stern, close upon us, cutting the sky within a very few degrees of the south there was abundant snow along its ridge, but when the moon struck lower down no sign of timber or any luxuriant vegetation ; the timber along the base was clothed in shadow. A monstrous wedge of land seemed to close all the upper end of the lake, and beyond it we could see nothing, for a mist had arisen covering all the face of the earth On the eastern side we could see great shadowy mountains again, and at their feet terrace like formations, land lines which seemed drawn with a mathematical accuracy, and yet outlining masses too vast to have been wrought or heaped by any human hands Everything huge, mysterious, fire in the moonlight, inspiring no sentiment but that of expectancy) because so un- familiar, so utterly unknown. Within the house it seemed impossible to realise that such vast surroundings were immediately without, that you could run up the blind and look right across to that great mountain wall that opening the dear and listening intently for a moment you might hear deep calling unto deep in the voices of a hundred waterfalls The vision of it came again in the darkness and in sleep And the morrow brought more than we had over dreamed of That golden morrow, that long just yesterday now It led UB over long lake like meadows, above which the skylarks sang, through marvellous forest-clad valleys, where inexpressible beauty Rested, and to hills where glory shone the majesty of the glory of the world which is only revealed in 1 her noblest heights.
