POETRY. BACHELOH'S HALL. Hurrah I hurrah for Bachelor's Hal! ; The Queen's away and I am monarch of all ; I I don't have to lrnng up my coat or hat, ! And wheD I get lonely I talk to the cat. I come when I like, and go when I choose. The Guest of cigars help me scatter the blues ; No bundles I carry, aud nothing . I buy, There's no one to care about ouly ' big I.' I revel in wildest confusion around ; There isn't a thine in its place to be found ; My books and papers, they lifter the room That hasn't for weeks seen the sight of a broom. There's clothing or sorm-thin? oo every chair ; My bed's never nude, but it's litt'e I care ; I sleep like a top, for there's one to call — I take solid comfort in Bachelor's Ball. I've used all the dishes and now its any fate To eat, when I'm home, on the back of a plate ; I'm learning to cook, but, alas, I confess I ohoose to go hungry than swallow the mess. But, Bachelor's Half with its comfort and qaiet, Is almost too spooky for regular diet ; No children live in ic to welcome their dad, No supper iB waiting, no wife — Oh so glad. No 1 nothing but ghosts to the loved ones away Inhabit thi- tomb where alone I must stay, Compelled to break silence by having a chat With my woful companion, the strange acting cat. Oh, gladly I'll yield my crown sceptre anJ all The kindly delights of a Bachelor's Hall Tn tbe Queen of the Home when she comes with her train To wisely and lovingly over me reign. Free Lance.
