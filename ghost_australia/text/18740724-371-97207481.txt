SELECT POETRY, CHANGED. Like a dream that was fair but has faded And died in a day that is dead, Like a gleam through the mist that has shaded The land when the sunset is red. Like the scent of a flower half forgotten * That brings back a buried delight, Your face comes to haunt me to-night. Thpre is ju3t the same freshne3s and splendour, The glory of colour and hair ; There is just the same smile and the tender Old look that your eyes used to wear. But one hing has changed; not the stately White curve of the throat to the braist ; Nor the calm on the browi set sedately, To show that the soul is at rest. . Yet one thing has changed, and can never Begain what was loth to depart—^ The love that has fled, and for ever, And left it so lonely— my heart ! Ah, sweet, in the old summer weather, lLneath the fair calm of the sky, When we walked in the green ways together* And plucked the old flowers, you and I, And talked the old follies and treasons, And plighted the vows that are dead And cold in the dust of past seasons. If any had met us and said, ' This fancy of yours, that misplaces Tove's name, is a dream that will die,' We should straightway have laughed in their faces, And bid them for fools to go by. Yet now, when the years are gone over, Asd things are no more what they seeing To me — neither friend now nor lover — You come like the ghost of a dream. But your face has no charms to excite me, That once was so fair iu my sight — Your presence no power to delight me. Old love, I am \reary-*good night !
