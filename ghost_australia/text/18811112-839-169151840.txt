l^aMM, PARTNERS : A TRUE STORY. BY A COUNTRY ATTORNEY. ' CHAPTER XVIII. 'Wi must do Hooky the ?justioo of saying . that his inoaroeratlon of the banker was not the result of a deliberate plan. It was done -on the impulse of tho moment, and must be considered as an evidenoe of something like . Napoloonio genius on the part of the lawyer. It came on him like an inspiration while ) Paffy was pleading for a restitution of the C plunder. Hooky was perfectly aware that, ) onoe started on a career of orime, retrogres sion was impossible.' The disappearance of .'???' Puffy - moreover, would benont .him in several ways. He was the only witness of , , his first forgery, and the only aocomplioo- in -:. .' his aeoond. Both secrets would be burled '\\. with him. The faot of Puffy being non eat ' ??'?;- the .very day of ter the accomplishment of a ' swindle whioh nearly emptied tho coffers of bUO 01UGIUU DrilflOU numu luuu DUDjjiuiim yu iua track. The huo and ory of tor Puffy would' allow tho lawyer time to got to tho coast, in disguise, and ship for San EVanciaco or Honolulu, or some other equally safe asylum. The feelings of Puffy whon ho found huusolf locked in the strong room may bo niaro . easily inmginod than described. At iirst he could not realise tho situation. Ho thought tho door had closed by accidont, and, al'tor searching in rain for tho money, which tho lawyer had told him was in tho left hand far corner, ho oallod' out to Hooky to open tho door. To this thore was no answor. The sound of his own voico oven seemod muffled and sepulohral. ? . ? Tho- horror of his situation all at onco flashed upon tho unhappy man. His blood .ceased to flow, and it Boomed ns if Giant Despair had clutched his heart. Thon, all at onco, tho very excess of his fear lent him super human strength, and ho sprang to ' the door, in spito of .the darkness, whioh was abiolute and appalling j .and, soil ing the handle tried to shako it in his ?frunzv. hiih hft miarhfc jm wn]1 hnvn Attamntod to shake tho Pillars of Herodes. Hdiin«i- plored Hooky to open tho door, oonjurodhim. by all that was most saored in heaven or earth to let him out. ? , ' 'You oan do what yon liko with tho money,' ho exolaimed ; ' tako it all, every penny of it — only let me out. I'll tako all the blame upon myself. Not a soul shall know you had anything to do with it. Oh ! for God's sake 1 don't leave mo to die in this living tomb.1' Ho response from tho out side. The walls wore thlok and impenetrable to sound. Tho lawyer could barely hear the Toioo of his prisoner ; and a smilo of satis factionjlightod up his faoo as ho thought how little ohanoe, there was of anybody outside hearing his ories for help. Tho unfortunate banker was now getting desperate. He yelled and howled at tho top of his voice cajoling, boseoohing, threatening, praying, oursing, and blaspheming in the same breath. - In the meantime the lawyor was going on with his preparations for departure. He 'wrote a note to one of his acquaintances in the town, and mentioned casually that he .was going on a walking tour aoross country as far as. the Killbogio railway station; and that he might possibly go on, by train, as far as Wagga, to ' pay his . ro. ?? epoots, he added jooularly, at the shrine of tho claimant Sir .Roger Tiohborno. Ho did not oxpoot to be baok for a week or ten days, but business was not particularly brisk at present, and boadoa he wanted a holiday: Jdis next prooedure was to put on a groy wig, an old pair of trousers, u very disreput \- able pair of boots, an old wido-awake hat ; and, slinging on orthodox swag over his shoulder, ho sallied out of tho baok door, tho , beau ideal of an old Bwugman, on the wallaby traok, with his tin billy and every thing complete. About 0 o'olook that night an old swag man might have, beon seen dropping a letter into the Slooum PoBt Offloo, a oiroumstanoo hot very remarkable in itooli; but it was certainly a vory remarkable biroumstanco that the old swagman, instead of makiug for the nearest publio-houao bar, and beginning to'knook down his ohoquo, if ho had one, or longing upon somebody for drinks if ho had no money of his own, snoaked out of the loyn, as 11 no were a oriunniu lnswaa 01 Doing ns-honest loafer seeking for work, and pray ing that ho wouldn't get it. _**^--rtunutoly for Mr. Silas Hooky,,tho oaglo ?*^£^ : of Sergeant Nttilom did not reBt. upon I jm' \/tn erratic speoimen of the genus tramp, ^jfir lie would havo arrested him npoususpiolon of being too good to bo wholesome. 1 \ Thfc night was oold and tho sky was over cast with hurrying clouds whioh shot past, iiow obsouring and now allowing to bo neon, (, tho orosoont moon whioh rodo high in tho heavens taking -what, in this oonnootUm. w I ' .;? :' 1 -.???;... ; ' ' ?? . . ?? . . '. \ may, without any irrevererioe, call a 'lunar' at the ' brimes and 'miseries, tho sins and sorrows, the woaknoss and meanness of humanity. ; ?-??.? As Silas Hooky Bkulked past the Oommor oial Hotol he looked askance at tho moon and, inBtead of bloBsing her for her refleotod light, he ouraed her for an intrusive jade whoso rays wore Bhodding too muoh lustre on his' path. But he passed the Oommeroiol in1 safety; tho1, when he looked into the well-lighted bar parlour, and saw tho oosy fire, and hoard the: light laughter of some happy man, who, apparently, as -yet, was tainted with no deeper orime than drinking, ho almost wished that he could obliterate from tho calendar the lost two days — and he ielttho weight of the gold he carried' as a ourso. ? ??' ' 'Soon :ho loft tho last', straggling house behind him, and,in ten minutoB more, a turn of tho road hid1 from 'view the last, faint, twinkling light of Slooum. ' ???- '-??- ? ???,?? Mr. Silas -Hooky was not mnoh given to moralising ;'? but, as ho trudged along, under oover of the darkness, it seemed to him that the force of circumstances had hurried him into the perpetration of crimes whioh h(S had never contemplated.1 If it had boon sug gested to him twenty-four hours bofore that the murder of Pult'y was nooossary to the buoooss of his sohemo, ho would haverejeotod the murder and the forgery, -at the same time. But tho first f also stop bomg taken the second was a neoessity of fate. At least bo he argued. It was not so muoh his fault as his misfortune that he had beonoompollod to dose Puffy in a living tomb. Then his imagination began to run riot on tho possibilities -of pursuit. Everything whioh seemed bo safe when he loft Slooum now appeared surrounded with uncertainty. AlrotMy he pictured to himself the discovery of Putty, and he started at tho melancholy ory of Borne night bird as if the hand of justice had touohed him on the shoulder. He preased on for about six miles along the main road without mooting with any r thing to induoe him to change his course, until his cense of hearing, quiokened by apprehension, apprised him of the vioinity of an enemy. Anything, however innooent, was, in his present atoto of mind, to be shunned ; and the noise whioh proceeded from tho awkward motions of a hobbled horse grazing on the road indicated to him the presence of something to bo uvoided. A few more stops and his eye caught the gleam of a oamp firo. ' A tilted waggon by the Bide of the road ; two men seated on boxes, each with a pannikin of tea in his hand; a ieleotabls savour of grilled steak— and Hooky began to fool that he was hungry, and oold, and wot, and miserable. Ho longed to go up to that cheerful firo, and ho would havo ijiven a handful of tho gold for whioh he bad' risked so muoh to be able to go boldly into the light of the camp; but ho was doubtful of his disguiso, and the reoolleotion of tho imprisoned Puffy drovo him away. He olimbed over tho fence, and, shunning tho main road, struok aorosB tho paddock, with ao very definite idea of where he was going. His main idea was .to got as far away from 31ooum as possible. Ho had not gone Ear in this new direotion when ho hoard a aoiso behind him liko the thunder of a uhargo of oavalry. Being unable to see my thing he pioturcd to himself fresh horrors ; Out when, as the sound beoame louder, and 20 felt tho earth tremble beneath him, he ileo, at tho same time, began to boo emerging from the surrounding gloom a dark inasB whioh bore down upon him, he reoog lised that he waa an object of attraotion to 1 mob of wild oattle. Huge, shuggy-gforms wero darting baok wards and forwards, hero and thoro, now ippearing and now disappearing in the un joctain light. Ho could almost fool their iot breath upon his faoo, and tho oxoited breathing of the startled animals was dis tinctly audible. Hooky was not by any means a timid man ; out no was totally unacoustomed to oattlo, and such attentions from 'a mob of infuriated animals wjib anything but reassur ing. He devoutly wished that ho had stuok to the main road, in spite of tho possibility of pursuit; and it is oven' doubtful if, at that moment, he would not have gladly exohanged positions with Puffy. Tho toBBing horns and fiery eyes and shaggy fronts came nearer and nearer. Bight in front of him ho could see one huge, wild-oyod fellow, who pawed the ground and shot out his huge, red tonguo and bellowed like a veritable Bull of Bashan, while as far as he could see ovor their baoks in tho dim moonlight, and extending to the right and left, was an angry sea of tossing horns. Hooky faced tho living wall, and walked baokwardsstop by stop, audwhilo horotreated the cattle camo steadily on — but ever gain ing, little by little. At length it occurred to Hooky to do what ho should havo dono before. Ho gave a torriflo yoll, and, swing ing his swag in one hand and the tin billy in tho othor, ho charged right at the middle of tho line. It broko in an instant, and, ? dividing to his right and left, two flying masBOB disappeared in the surrounding gloom. Hooky now walked on briskly, buc he had not proceeded moro than a hundred yards when ho heard tho thunder of hoofs again, and in 'an instant ho was a aeoond timo surrounded by tho samo mob, who wore either moro ourious or loss timid than bofore. By this time, howovor, Hooky had .got used to thorn, and, in faot, rather liked thoir sooioty aa being better than communing with his own thoughts. Ho, therefore, walked on slowly, conversing, familiarly with his body guard, whioh accompanied him right aoross the paddook, occasionally disappearing with a rush when startled, to ro-nppoar again moro ourious than ever. At leugth, getting tired of tho accompaniment, Hookey made anothor rush at the foe, who disappeared almost as preoipitatoly ,os did Hookey himsolf, for the lawyer, not taking notioo of where he was going, plungetl head first into a drain, and after Bomo frantio struggles in the liquid mud, orawlod out at the other side, moro offootually disguisod than if he hud donned tho entire wardrobe at tho disposal of tho Corps Dramatigtie, or the Chamber of Horrors in tho Waxworks. CHAPTER XIX. AfarnotTGn Tom Parohmont did not fool particularly anxious to loayo Slooum for n wook or bo ; yet his intondod trip to Mol bourno, at tho request of Mrs. Hardgrovo, was not so distastotul as it might havo boon. Whether this sudden satisfaction was to bo nocountod for by tho. fact that Mrs. Hard jrovo and Polly Wnlkoi1 had signified 'thoir Intention of accompanying him, has novori boon rovoaled. Writers of fiotion arotoo much in tho habit of assuming to tbomsolvcs tho power of reading tho moat secret thoughts and inten tions of tho characters thoy dopictj- but whoro a plain narration of facts 'is roquisito, all Bitch assumptions aro manifestly out of placo. All tlmt tho writor of this history can vouch for is, that tho two ladies montionod, woro going lo docompany Tom Parohmont — and that uo did not look unhappy. , It may bt as well to state that Tom, after ho left Slooum on tho ocoa gion first montioaod, had sought, and ob tained, tho position of confidential olork to » vory respootablo firm of solicitors, who know his valuo, as hi had loarnt moat of his law in their office. Uis nj^7--\vaj,^r-00, f: yearvyithapvojpcfltJTD^aii^ #t!)$m **TT7 ~~ had to bo at tho office within a-wook, it suited him just as well to go: down now. 'His first duty was to' sooure a box-seat for tho ladios/ which ho .did -by '.tho judioious ex penditure of half a sovoraign. ! Among tho .possongen was a tall, blaok whiskorod, forociouB looking individual who sworo at tho grooms, oursoa tho horsos, &d;' dnathomatizod all and sundry. Ho seated' himsolf next to Tom, and ; bogan a livolyj)on-, vereation, ohiofly about, himsolf and his own ' adyiontiu'os. To hoar^him, ono would havo SuppoBod that his principal bcoupation was murdbr j and that ho rovollod in blood for tho mere sake of j diver sion. In a belt round his waist' ho oorried four revolvers and an uidefinite number 'of bowio knivesl He had shot tigers in India; lions in Afrioa, and had, single-handed, cap. turod pir'utioal junks in the Chinese seas.' - It was ' his ' oommon oustom to drill a given number of holes through a given number of men per week while he was seeking for re laxation in San FranoiBoo ; and all he thirsted for, now, was to have a brush with the bushrangers of -Australia.. This harangue, plentifully interlarded with strange oaths of {earful' and wonderful construction, had an obvious effoot upon his fellow-posBengers. He produoed a still greater effeot when' he pulled from his broast-pooket a huge flask. of rum and, after helping himself, passed it on, beginning with tho ladies. As none of tho passengers availed themsolvos of his offer he took it as a personal insult and began to be 'abusive. , . , : - , , . ; Among the passengers was a slight, quiet man, -who apparently had weak eyes, for ho wore green speotaoles. -To this gentleman 'the flro-eating Btronger eBpeoially. addressed .'himsolf, possibly boouuse ho was tho smallest man of tho party. , ; The little man had, up to this point, been a listener. ? ? ? ? ? Our belliooBO hero now turned on him fiorooly, and, twirling his moustaohe with one hand, while he handled a revolver with tho other, ho oskod tho unoffending traveller ' what he meant by sneering that way P' To this the other replied : , ' Far be .it from me to sneer at Buoh undoubtedly accurate acoounts as you havo given us of your wonderful adventures. On the oontrary, I oongratulato myself, and our entire oompany, on having suoh a protootor. Your fame is not unknown to mo, for, if I do not mistake, I am addressing the renowned Captain Blometite.' 'That id, indeed, my name,' said the swash-buokler, graciously, handing his snuff box to his follow ? traveller ; 'but I was unaware that my famo, suoh as it is, had spread to this remote quarter of the globo.' ' Suoh virtues as yours are not easily hid,' oontinuod tho little man. 'The trump of famo whioh has handed down to our day the wrath of Aohillos, the labours of Horoules, the teats of King Arthur, and his Knighta of tho Bound Tablo ; tho adventures of Amadfg do Gaul, and of the renownod Don Quixote,, de la Munoha; the victories of Puhtagruol, the son of Gargantaa, tho son of Grangousier, over tho Dipaodos, will not fail to enlightoa future generations upon tho merits of the most renowned Captain Blomo tito.' ' Sir,' roturnod the oaptain, ' I am proud to meet a gentleman of your good sense, and I regret that undor a misappre hension on my part, I spoke to you just now in terms you so littlo merited.' 'That is a matter of no oonsoquonoe,' replied the other; 'your presence makoB amends for any little roughnoss of spqeoh, whioh so well becomes your person, and only adds additional lustro to your oharacter. It is probable that, bofore vory long, wo 'shall want your assistance. Although wo are not vory near 'to tho haunts of tho notorious bushrangers, who havo bo long kept the oountry in oonfusion, they often make raids in this direotion, and it is rumoured that they aro in the neighbourhood.' ' You don't say so,' oried the captain, and his faoo lengthened considerably at the information. 'I thought this part of tho oountry was perfectly safe.' 'So it was until quite reoently; but I suspect that the bushrangers have heard that the famouB Oaptain Blomotito is travel ling through, and they havo determined to capture him.' . The oaptain here applied the rum flask to his lips again; and if his hand shook, it must have been from tho motion of the ooaoh, whioh was just then oh a rough pieoo of road. 'You are of course aware, oaptain,' oon tinued the man in green speotacles, ' that the bushrangers of Australia aro a ohivalrio raop t«,they havo at least adopted tho armour, if tb$y?havo failed to copy the graoos of the knights of the middle ages : and if you meet with anyone olad in complete steel, with on iron helmot on his head, you oau draw out your rovolvers and shoot at once.' ' But d — do you think there is any ohanco of meeting thespa bloodthirsty villains,' inquired the oaptain anxiously. ' I am rather afraid of it,' was tho reply ; ' in faot, within a mile of where we ohungo horsos, ono of tho gang was seen the other day, bo that I should advise you to look to your arms.' ' Tho information thoy had just rocoivod caused no littlo consternation among tho passengers ; and Tom Parohmont Vas about to suggest thnt tho ladios should go inside, vrhilo tho revolvers, of which tho captain had four, should bo distributed among tho men, wbon tho horo of tho groon spootnclos Blipped a noto into his hand, which mado him ohango his intentions. Tho captain, howovor, handed ovor tho four rovolvors to ,tho littlo man, who, aftor carefully oxanuning all tho chambors, dis tributed thorn j giving gno to Tom, ono to tho captain, ono to anothor pdssongor, and rotaining tho othor himself. \ CHAPTER XX. : 1 The driver, who had been an attentive observer of tho littlo episode just related, showed considerable indications of perplexity in his faoo ; however, he said nothing, but drovo on, and in about half- an-|)our pulled up at a decent looking roadside publio-houso, wnioh was dignified by the name of tho Travellers' KaBt Hotel. .( The ooaoh ohanged horsos hj/ro, and re mained about a quaitor of An hour for refreshments. / Tho tiro-eating oaptain wan himsolf again. Ho had oaten and he had drunken ; find onco more the old Adam was in .'the ascendant. Tho potent whisky of tho Travollors' ReBt, dispensed by a pretty barmaid, had roused his warlike spirit to the sticking or tho shooting point. Perhaps ho had rocoivod Bomo private information from tho barmaid, who was ovidontly struok with his perfections. She may have assured 'him that bush rangors woro unknown about tbo distriot, and that tho only danger he was likely to exporienoo was from the arrows of tho wioked littlo blind god, Cupid, i ' At all ovontB, Oaptain(Blomcti to was, roar ing liko ono of tho lions ho Was so fond of killing whon ho sojourned in Africa. - ' Who caroB for your paltry cow-catching bushrangors P Lot thorn show thomsolvos now whUo thore w suflloiont daylight to draw a bead upon thoir cowardly carcasuoB.

The revolver whioh -bo had been flourishing, fell frop. his hand and ho looked as liko a washed-out dish-clout as it io pomiblo for a human being to look. Tho bushranger on his right fbocJionod him down from the top of ' tho oojtoh, as ? Hamlot's :' father's ghost beokonod* Hamlet's father's Bon from the ramparts of Bhinoroj and tho captain followed Mrn, while tho glittering oyb of tho knight of the nail can apparently had tho same effootjipon his viotim that the eyo of tho anoiont nmrinor had upon tho : wedding guest. . '? ?????. In tho rear of tho establishment was a room that sorved as a sort of - doad-house, whore drunkon bushmen woro beetowod .to sleep off. the effects of thoir debauch on bad liquor — when all their money was spent. Into this doleotable abode' Oaptain Blomo tito was thrust, and tho key turned npon him. -?'.???? Upon the return of tho first bushrangor, he took off his helmot and revealed- the ferooious countenance of — the man in green spootaolos. His mate was no other than Tom Parohment; and they were proceeding to explain that, as Oaptain Blometite' a room was better than his oompany, they had adopted this mild stratagem , to got rid of him — when two ominous- looking figures wero observed skulking mysteriously round the oorner of the verandah. On their heads was tho orthodox nail oan, without whioh Australian bushrangers never think of venturing into the light of day. l ? One of thorn carried a huge weapon, whioh looked like a fowling piece of Goliath of Gath— if suoh had been, used- in the days: of that unoircomoised 'Philistine, but whioh ; was, in reality1, :an abominablo pleoo of ordnance- whioh the Philistines ' of . sport calls a duck gun.' This' frightful! death dealing oontrivance (whioh bears about the came relation to an ordinary gun,; that Gargantua's mare's tail bears to the oaudal appendage of an. ordinary horse) takoB for its usual charge about five ounoes of powder, and two pounds of shot. Now, as a modern breeoh-loader, suoh as aportsmon use, requires a oharge of. about three dramB of powder and an ounce of shot, it will bo seen that we are not exag gerating in our comparison, although wo are assured by that careful historian, Rabelais, that tho aforesaid mare (whioh ' was as big as six elephants'), had a tail ' little moro or less than every whit as graat as tho stoeplo of Saint Mark.', It is not to bo wondered at, then, that when Tom Parohment saw this diabolical oontrivance, with a', tors three inches _ in diameter, and a barrel ten feet long, pointing at him, and within 'three feet of his breast, he should feel inolined to obey the commands of tho bearer of thiB persuasive instrument, when, in a sopulohral tone, ' rendered moro hideous by the vibration of the tin pot on hiB head, he commanded him to— ' Bail up!'1 It is not to be supposed that '.Torn Parch mont had any partiaular desiro to havo two pounds of buok shot lodgod in his visceral region) and yet ho could not altogether reoonoiio himself to bailing up without a struggle. He looked at ms antagonist, and saw his oyes gleaming through a slit, in tho nail oan with that pecu liar ' glaro that always indicates tho ruthloss and sanguinary marauders of the Australian bush. Ho glanced at his com panion in distress — tho man in tho green Bpeotaclos. Soeing him looking steadfastly at tho corner, of the house, Mb eyos naturally followbd tho samo dirootiori, and thoro ho ob sorved tho barrol of anothor gun, with anothor bushrangor bohind it, who had as sumed tho UBual and customary attitudo ?which an Irish Land Loaguor assumes, quite naturally, when his landlord comes for his ront. But Tom Parohment was at a difforont angle from 'his friend, and, in fact, ho could sco a little bit round the oornor. It struok him that tho second gun had a voiy anciont look; and, glancing along tho barrel, Iris quiok oyo dotectod that it had no cap on, and that it wa», in fact, deficient of a nipple. This discovory made him think that pos sibly tho gun pointed at him had the same peculiarity ; but ho found, on looking at it, that it was capped in propor order, and that it was, moreover, at full cock. Tho bushrangers began now to be im pationt, and, with tho most frightful impre cations and ouraes, commanded Tom to turn out ? his pockets and hand over all his valuables. A third bushranger now made his appear ance, but ho had no gun, and his duty was to do the stealing part of the business, while tho armed bushrangers hold tho viotims covered with their weapons. Tom, expostulating with the man in front of him, asked him to bo good enough to turn asido tho muzzle of his gun. ' My friend,' ho said, ' I am sure you do not want to commit an unnecessary murdor. All you want is tho money, whioh, of oourso, you shall have. If your fingers wero to slip it would blow a hole through mo as big as a barn door. Looking at it from the point of view of tho welfare of your honourable pro fession, unnecessary bloodshed (is always a mistake.' Bushrangers ore not, as a rule, very muoh givon to conversation, although, in romances, they occasionally indulge in spooohos as long as those with whioh the heroes of Homer's Illiad are credited ; but it is always best to Btiok to simplOj plain facts, and what the bushrangor replied to Tom was simply : 11 Stow your gaff, and shell out.' . But Tom Parohment had gained his end, for 'tho hugo gun was of Buoh a monstrous weight that tho villain holding it was obliged to drop the : muzzlo for a moment while he took a rest.;' This was Tom Parohmont' s opportunity ;'? and, making a jump from tho box-seat, ho landed with both foot fair upon tho shouldors'of his enemy. The shook* sent tho bushranger. Bprawling, and tho duok gun wont off with Buoh a torrifio roar that tho horsos took fright, and turning suddenly round snapped one of tho swingle trees ; and overturning the ooaoh, sent those of the passengers who had already taken their seats rolling into the middle of the road.
