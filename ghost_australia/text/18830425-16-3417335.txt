QUEER STAGE DIRECTIONS. (The Standard.) THE modern theatregoer who picks up an old play may be excused for puzzling his brain as to how a good 1110113 of the stage directions were carried out Not infuse quently, the manager, whose stock of stage furniture and properties were limited to to t green cut tain and two or three lusty. bloods Olds, scalded upon by an author for an effect which all the resources of the Lyceum could not produce The conditions under which the South, dramatists of a by gone time shore to secure then Royal patrons ne, of course, not to be confounded with those under which the strolling player pursued his trade, but, then, the requirements we particularly refer to were just those which no amount of kingly favour and lavish patronage would help the stage manager to fulfil " Enter so and so with an now through his head was 1 rather a modest demand for an author to make upon an actor in the palmy days of the races ev al drama and it was as likely is not that the di amatiAjje) your afflicted with this trifling inconvenience would further be charged with 1 long soliloquy in blank verse, bustling with classic ii allusions of the first water Few actors on the stage at the present time would, « 0 suspect, be quite equal to such an appearance The "gods' are sceptical in these days, and given to passings, and it is not safe to leave any thing to the imagination of the modem audience With our forefathers a placard on the green court on inscribed " A street in Verona, 01 " A gi ivey ird, might conjure up a scene, but the modern playgoer has been spoiled by the realistic proclivities of the modern manager, and the result of the many aids to the imagination thus proudest is that we shall soon be able to imagine nothing at all How did the " it is, the hands, the ghosts, the good and evil angels, the personified virtues and vices which the old di contests set walking about the stage, 01 fighting and g unbolting in sight of the audience, comport themselves ? With dignity, whose dignity was required, we have no doubt, and any 13s after a spiritual of fashion But then the imagination of the audiences was quick in those days, and then faith was great TIow, let us ask, would the moduli manager set to work to produce not to go too far afield for an e\amj)le-the " Honourable History of Tutu Bacon and fine Bungay, as it was " made by Rober tG 1 seen, Master of Arts, was played by her Majesty s servants Gretna was one of the most popular, as he was one of the most profligate, of the 11111101 Elizabeth in dramatists There is nothing can displace about his characters His duty maids and ploughmen level in classical allusions, his " noblemen and gentlemen conversed familiarly with all the spirits of the earth, air, and sea A "Devil md "The Spa it of His suits are among his chances prisons, 111 the play just named Emma Bacon compels Burdens landlady to appeal before the company assembled to open over as magical as " JJ ones ideas in hats Dclciphon ' cues the conjurer 111 mc intation-and the, result is startling "Enter Hostess, leads the stage direction, with 11 shoulder of mutton on a spit, and 1 devil Indeed, devils play a VICE important put in most of the scents Bacon shows Prince Ede and, 111 1 might mu 101, the courtship between Lace and Margaret Ina Bung 13, the rival magician, is about to in 1913 the two, when seen, by his itself this is seen in the magic nuuoi-stukes Bung 13 dumb " Enter 1 div ii, who cants oil lunch on his back Miles, B con s servant enjoys a long conv erection in front of the audience with one of his master s familial s, who made matters writes to give him 1 1 ide upon his back Miles put on his spurs, and mounts Exeunt the, day in hearing In the low side igitdIIistoi3ofDt Pantin - 1 HILLS which, besides being a remarkable 1 enduring of the old I must legend and old ring in the character of the doctor a powerful psychological study, contains indisputably some of the most beautiful passages in the 1 high interest 155 tins wonder and address to the spirit of Helen, with its crowning smile On 1 thou art fairer than the evening and Child in the beauty of a thousand stars the mil 01 makes ample use of the supernatural, often in a delightfully grotesque form Ijiiufei, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles, 1 good angel, and a bad night, impressed into service, along with two or three ghosts, and devils innumerable the clown of the pi ice is clubs pestered by these fatality "J enter two devils, and the clown runs up and down 11 613 tug 1 aust com pi ins that he cannot sign the bond because his blood conge ils "111 fetch the fire to dissolve it straight, 13s Moplnsto plants taking the Doepel s metaphor with the hypothesis of a tube Philistine, and returning soon after with a chance of ends I Te goes again and he enters with devils, who give towns and 5th appeal to I instils, quite, and line depot Taust wishes for a wife, re-enter Mephistopheles with 1 devil dressed like a woman with (networks Soon after there is a stage duce tion which is simply apinlluig-"Cntoi the Seven Be fully Sins The Sins explain the nature and pedigree and heart This is a curious state, in which I first used his families in ment the wept, but He is mad, and Haig Inewoiks upon,, them I just sells his horse to 1 horse come in, aid when the purchaser puts the man is to the w shot it turns to 1 bottle of law I and his se Fraser ill but living In the highest st n (f all to funds rain III fice of the in to on, and turn off the same who had signed I the author bond in Massingu s classic. d play ' IhoNitgni JMIIIIVI, two of tin chief char actors live 1111 pay, an I I ii spit it follow m" I Theophilus uithcsliipe of 1 seed 1 tin and Angelo, a Ooilsptul s living together in the habit of a pig's life 11 11 a IN, in left 11 ful shape, his finishing at (f Hi study In 11111113 old 11 w s 1 by. his Midd nil To use it] in the shell when it is no issue is ] sent a sh 1 in" iii rub 1 ' Intel Mis 1 1 infor 1 111 her but is for His mu 11 stage directions in i in in in I low ) d s Woman filled with lvuidnis.s in Marston's " Antonio's Ho verge," ,Aiidi'agîo's ghost is discovered " sitting on the ridges curious posture for a ghost. In Peele's " Love of King David and Fair Bethsabe, with the Tragedy of Absalom," Absalom hangs by the hair, and in this inconvenient position delivers a speech of no inconsiderable length. Dyce surmises that an entry in Hanslowe's diary may refer to this, which records a payment for polices and workmanship for to hold Absalom." It would be" interesting to know how the miracle of the Brazen Head, mentioned in the Honourable History of Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay" was managed. Friar Bacon made a brazen head, which was to speak prophecies, and by the help of which he was to put a wall of brass round England. But when the brazen head uttered its first words, Friar Bacon was asleep, and his stupid servant did not wake him, so that the charm was broken. " Time is," said the head, " time was," " time is past." " A lightning flashes forth, and a hand appears that breaks down the head with a hammer, and wakens Friar Bacon to see the ruin of his hopes. In Beaumont and Fletcher's excellent burlesque, " The Knight of the Burning Pestle," there are some quaint stage directions. Enter The leading one winking with a basin under his chin, as if prepared for shaving." "Enter George, leading one with a patch over his nose." In In Marston's " Antonio and Mellida " occurs the following :-" Enter Balurdo backward, Wilde following him with a looking- glass in one hand and a candle in the other, Flavia following him backward with a looking glass in one hand and a candle in the other, messaline following her. Balurdo and Bos saline stand setting of faces, and so the scene begins." ' Instead of ink," says the King in Marlowe's " Edward II., " I'll sign it with my tears," and the stage direction is "subscribes." One of Friar Bacon's miracles not always mentioned is that of making a tree appear on the stage " with a dragon spouting fire." It might be worth something in the production of a modern pantomime, to which all our stage wonders are now relegated, to understand exactly how this was accomplished.
