NEWS OF THE WEEK. A- gentleman informs us that a pros pector showed hi™ a number of specimens of conglomerate of ironstone and, .quartz, very thickly studded with gold. The discoverer would; sot state rwhsre he had. ? found- these specimens, as .he intended to make his claim .. - secure first, but they were not from the Jupiter Creek Diggings,, although somewhere in that direction. . . . . - . . The fortnightly meeting of the Execu- . tive Committee oflthe Prince Alfred Sailors' Home, was held on Friday, October 2. The Secretory stated that the Port Corporation, on receipt of an application from the Committee, . to invite tenders for filling up Si. Vincent street, had resolved, in the first-instance, to ask' the Government 'whether the 6ums' con tributed towards the work would be supple- . mented by Government. No reply had been received by. tHe Town OlerE The Treasurer reported receipt of £7, as proceeds pf an enterr . - tainment given . in North Adelaide by the Juvenile Amateur Christy Minstrels. It was mentioned that Captain -Wagstaff's suggestion for a bazaar, to be held on board the Commis sary, in aid of the funds, had riot been adopted, as several ladies to whom the matter had been.' ' referred were of opinion, that the limited stay of the ship in port would not afford the time requisite for preparation. ' Captain Wagstaff had!, however, handed the Committee £10 10s. as his subscription to the Sailors' Home. A -letter was read from the Hpn. T. Elder, an nouncing that Mr. A. L. Elder, of London, had authorised him to contribute £100 in aid of the movement. The amended trust-deed was passed as recommended by the Subcommittee, and it was resolved -that, the Institution be brought under the provisions of the Associa tions Incorporation Act. A message was re ceived from Mr. O. P. Angas, expressive of hia warm interest in the matter, and hoping that the ; erection of the building -would be pro ceeded' with in a short time. The Secretary reported that Mr. B, O. Thomas hoped to , have the plans and specifications read; within a' week. ? * : We have to acknowledge the receipt of thp October number of the Australian Christian Pioneer. 'There was not much news by the Northern mail on Wednesday. At Umbers tana there had been a light shower or two, but not sufficient to be of the slightest benefit. On Thursday afternoon, as two gentle men were driving along Sing William- street in a buggy, they came into contact with a dray at Platts's corner. The vehicle was overturned and its -occupants thrown out. Fortunately no injury was sustained by either.

C. Manthorpe delivered' a lecture on ' ' The Crusades,' at the Hindmarsh Congrega-' tipnal Church, in aid of the library in connec tion with the Sabbath-schooL The attendance was large, and the chair was occupied by the Hon. T. Beynolds. ; The proceedings having been opened by singing and prayer, the Chair man introduced the lecturer, who after some prefatory remarks glanced at the period when Peter the Hermit started to; -the Holy Land with an expedition comprising people of all ages who came from different countries in Europe, forming one vast assemblage, and who whi proceeding on. their mission were slaughtered on every hand, the carnage being, so great that the rivers were said to have flowed with blood. He also alluded to the various other expeditions . which followed, but which suffered, the same privations and loss of life. He referred also to tha numbers who were sold in slavery, and to those who perished miserably from fatigue and privations. He adverted to the advantages arising from the Crusades, and said, although they presented a mournful aspect in the many lives that had been sacrificed, a vast amount of information was gained, and they had been productive in diffusing knowledge and' developing trade and commerce. The lecturer, on resuming his seat, was much applauded ; and the usual votes of thanks having been passed, the proceedings closed with prayer. During the evening a collection was made, and the school choir .sang several sweet selections of music. The Rev, J. Crawford Woods having delivered a lecture on ' The Rise of the Church of England, with some observations on its pre sent condition and influence,' has been re quested to publish it. A copy of the pamphlet is now before us. The rev. gentleman takes his text from Ezek., xvL 44 — 'As is the mother, so is her daughter;' and commences as follpws : — ' I select these words as my text, because they describe briefly the resemblance between the Church of England and the Mother Church of Borne ; but I do not wish to convey by them the reproach which, in their connection in the prophecy of Ezekiel, they so powerfully express. This lecture is not in tended to be antagonistic and controversial; it is * given for the information of the younger members of the Congregation. I shall, how ever, make some pl.un remarks on certain things of which I disapprove, without, however, I trust, offending against the spirit of Christian charity.' We must candidly say that we do not think Mr. Woods demonstrates the 're- semblance' which: (in another sense) the words of his text affirm, although there are doubtless points of res mblance, ecclesiastically. But so wide- a theme could not be expected to be com pressed into ten. small pages, and- in attempting such a feat- of compression-; Mr. Woods has scarcely done justice to his subject or to himself. He has, however, undoubtedly thrown together in the limited space at his command, a consi derable number of historical facts of great in terest, not only to the religious community with which he is more especially identified, but to most others. ? papers totbjO;24th-ihsfcu3£ ,. ?/ -.].'., . - ? ]'~ ] '.,; ? ^Sie *fiernibmetery;iii ihe'suisy 'reached : ( ?

A vote of thanks td; Mr*' Pizey for bis paper, and to the Chairman, concluded the proceedings. ? It; is with, much regret we record the death «f Dr. J- Walker, Protector of A.borigi nes, -which took place at the Tork Hotel on Saturday morning, after a brief illness of only an hour's duration. . He sot down to breakfast in apparently the best of health and spirits, end partook heartily, but immediately afterwards, at about half-pafet 9, ie began, 'id: vomit and complained of a pain inthe back of his bead. Dr. Moore, his nsnal medical attendant, was at once called in, and be ?declared 'the attack to be apoplexy, from which there was no hope of recovery. His prediction proved to be true, for by- balf-past 10 the unfortunate gentleman had breutbed his last. .Dr. Walker was the son of the Bev.. John Walker, of Manoblane, -Ayrshire, and -was. born. there in 18L2. He studied at GiasgbwrUnivereity, where he got his diploma.' After. this he practised for three or. four . years in his native county, chiefly at Oirvin, Ayr shire. About 1839 ie went to Balize, Honduras, where he practised as a surgeon. He was also , for a considerable time in the Employ of the Government, acting as Staff Surgeon when that office iwas -vacantithrough. the absence of its regular 'occupant. .Dr. Walker took a leading par t an public' afiairs in this settlement. The 'Colony/is governed by a Superintendent, assisted by seven XJminoUlxaB,' who are elected annually.- . Dr.'; -Walker was one of the Councillors for^a considerable period,, and, as member of the7 Court -of Policy, exercised- -judicial ras well as administrative functions. With the exception of an occasional visit to Britain, his experience inSonduras lasted till 1855, whsn he: returned to ScoMand, andsailed for South Australia. On his arrival in tbis xolony he settled, at Mount: Barker, where iie practised in his profession for about a year, ' and then removed to StrathalbyDi where he remained till, in November, 1861, be srasappointed Protector of Aborigines, which omoe he lield till his death. Ur. Walker was a widower, and leaves 'two daughters in the old country, $he eldest being about 13 -years of age. .?''. Qii Monday evefling! : a most : cruel- act was perpetrate(i at Dry Creek by some person or persons unknown — -the victim heinga valuable Horse, 7tbe property' of a. Mr. Tennant, sheep faTmer,*of :P6rt ilncoln. Trom What we can lsarn it appears an aboriginal native in the. employ ,of Mf? Tenilant was' coming'' into Ade laide, on.' the horse and stopped at the Gepp's1 Cross'lnnjfor a? short time, where bethinks he must have' gone to sleep, for after coming into town he found that he hid been .'robbed' to the extent of abbut £3, , and. on taking the horse tp^ tbe ...'Jpnn 'Bull- lar^B,' it Was dis cpvered, that: the 'horse was ... bleeding ;prp fnsely— the iesult of some 20 stabs which had' been inflicted; asllhe jiafiye' .thinks, by some, soldiers^ for he states that the only per sons be sa^ about the Gepp'-s .Cross, .Inn when he stopped isrerefour. soldiers and two females! The hoxsejoad .been ridden pretty' freely, and from^he loss of blood, which the. native states he was ignorant of,' the unfortunate animal ;was almost* exhausted. We may 'mention that the parties- at the John Bull,- on hearing the ;cir- cumstances, requested the native to accompany them tojthe Detective Office, wbere he.was care fully Searched ;'~by|i ^nothing was found that would give 'any 'suspicion that the cruel deed. had been committed by him. . :A.;h5tber ^rom -l^r. ;J. ; Rawlings to & friend in Sown iias just been received, and we have ;inuch .pleaBnre in making the -following extract, v It is;as follows :—** Duke ,of Sutaer* land; St vHelena, June 13, 1868,7-rHeie we are all in jolly .'good health ; long passage, .'but otherwise yery pleasant.

Usually upon these occasions, the mem bers are in.jthei habit of ibringing mechanical modeb-ortoyB, and other articles of interest and curiosity to form a miniature Polytechnic; Exhibition, -but on Tuesday night there was a great lack of articles..

The interest of : theimeett.ng was not, .however, sustained as; on previous occasions, but the Committee would doubtless seek to remedy this defect in future. ; On Monday evening, -September 28, the 'nineteenth0 baS-yearly soiree; of the ? Trinity Church Toiuig Men's Mutual Improvemeht Sociefy was: held :ih;tne Trinity Ghureh Schoei room, which 'was nicety decorated with flowers, *&c;!j for the . occasion; : There was a^vety large attenSanCe',' many persons being obliged tostani ::The 'chair- was occupied by'Mr. -S. fTomkinson, ? whoin. commencing the proceedings referred, to the benefits he, -in 'common' with others, had received from -attending a YonngMen'p Society.

In commencing h» lecture Mr. -Gardner saldj in compliance wi^i * request by the Rev. Mr. Beid -^hat{' he would give- -a lecture he came i»efore themon that -occasion.1' He referred to poeiry, paiiiting, and music as the fine arts,' the' former being the; music of -the 'heart, painting pleased the'eye,- and- music was the^melody 6f ihe spuL Tjje next position, he-thenght^ might *be fairly given to-eloquence-MiWart of distinct' articufetapn or utterance. For thisa good voice was/neoeisary/and^thebaritonewaB^considered^ best, riThe rev. gentleman related an aneedbte' of 'ProfessorWflflon^ «f Edinburgh, fwho had a very fine voice, of which he was not a little proud. . A.conversation between the Professor :ana' the Bttrick Shepherd ' (James 'Hogg) was given by Mr. Gardner, and as the latter spoke in his native tongue, there was considerable laughter. The rev. gentleman went on to ?speak of errors in writing and spelling, and of woman's voice, which though the softest, sweetest, and most musical, might, if not pro perly trained, be spoilt. In like manner, the tone of man's voice, , though noble and com manding, if it had not undergone proper train ing, would be entirely lost on the hearers. He thought that by a proper training of the human voice, many' firesides would be rendered doubly attractive, and many happy hours might be spent with some of their best authors. Painting was well, but it only afforded amuse-, merit to ; one ; music the same, but both, he thought, rendered the palm to eloquence. By a proper use of this, both amusement and in struction could be combined. The beight of eloquence was to make the hearers forget the actor while their interest was Centred on .the character represented. The lecturer concluded the first portion of the lecture amid great applause. - Mr. ' A. -James sung- in it masterly manner the Bong ' When Time Hath Bereft Thee ;' f oUowea by Mr. A. Mullen, who gave a recitation; -Tbe first part of the programme was concluded by Miss Vaughan -singing -her well-known song ' Kathleen Mavpurneen.'; The second- half ' of 'the evening's entertainment was commenced by two songs followed by a reading from one of Dickens's works. After a duet by Messrs. T. W. Lyons,' and A. James, the Rev. Mr. Gardner illustrated the second portion of' Ms ^ lecture' by reciting ' Young: ?Lochinvar '- and the: ''Haunted House,' in a manner that elicited rounds of 'applause. This was immediately attended by Mr. C. Lyons singing ** Molly Asthore.' ' The next on the programme was a scene -from Shakespeare's play of ' Hamlet,' in which Messrs. W. Shakespeare, F.-Calf, A. Mullen, and C. Potter took parts. For the better rendering of the moonlight encounter between 'Hamlet and his father's ghost -the - lights', were turned down, but the effect of the scene was' con siderably marred: by a continual request from -sottte person behind that the ghost would speak a little louder,' which, of course, rendered -the keeping ^ of a serious faoe;almost; impossible.

Beveral have been attacked with a hitherto unknown complaint/ something like that.- familiarly known as the wildfire rash, and that the medical attendants have- declared that the. cause of the complaint is the patients having, eaten too freely of vege tab'es grown by. the ; Chinese, the vegetables: having been inoculated with disease by the peculiarities of Chinese irrigation. We hope - the medical gentlemen ; will publicly give the result of their, skill and observation, so that the minds of vegetarians may be set at rest.

The Ararat Adikrtiser ^ve's the fol-: lowing account of a remarkable tragedy -z—-1*. An occurrence, which ..terminated fatally for one of the parties concerned, took place.- ion Saturday -evening last at the tent of j a miner named White, which is situated butween. three arid four miles, from Ararat.;- White. had- been to town :for the purpose ^df .purchasing a week's supply of provisions, and he did not reach his abode till pretty late. After having made pre parations for jetiring to rest, his attention was .directed :to a ; slight ,;movement and heavy breathing beneath his stretcher ; when, catch ing sight of ,a beard and. eyes, he seized his gun, which was standing near the fireplace, and covered the intruder in an .instant. White states that it was not his intention to do any thing beyond .taking up this position, which was merely assuined with the view 9f protecting himself. The intruder was cha'eriged, and ?being ordered. to come. forth,,thea; rvdusness of the speaker overcame his first nr sn tions; un fortunately, the trigger was pi s*ed, and the charge lodged in ''Hie head pf.thr unfortunate.

Youl assumed an inquest at the Hospital on- Thursday, con perning the depth, of Ah Sham, one of the un fortunate passengers, by , the Dayspring from . Hongkong to this port. : Several witnesses were examined, :but the evidence taken added little, to the facts which have been already pub lished. ; Prof essor Half ord had made a micro scopic examination of a portion of deceased's blood, but was unable -to detect any difference between it and the bipod removed from other bodies, after death had , taken place. There was no appearance of pyoemia. He believed the cause of death, to have been from bad.. and insnfncient- food;- and want of prpper ventila-: tion. Mr. W. Johnson, Government analytical; chemist, examined portions of the provisions which had been served put to the passengers during the voyage, ; He^discovered the salt fish to be in an advanced stage of decomposition— in fact, putrid and offensive. The Chinese turnips were in a rank istate of decay. ; The. lime- juice was genuine, and in. fair condition. ? Mr. Lang don, the cabin passenger who had been an inmate of. the Melbourne Hospital since the arrival of the vessel in. Hobson's Bay, confirmed the assertions made by other witnesses respect-;, ing the filthy, unhealthy, and un ventilated con ditipM. pf tbe:y^sseL He had repeatedly -remon- strated with the captain concerning- the putrid condition of portions of the provisions, but had been .unable to' effect : any change.-- Whenever the ^captain; was informed ofu the .illness' pf a Chinese passenger, he invariably replied : — 'Dr-r them, (the Chinese); I' wish they were all dead and over tne side,. I should then have ao more trouble with, them.' The coroner summed :up the evidence, and after some consulation the following verdict was re turnedi:-r-'.We : find that Ah Sham died in the Melbourne Hospital, on the 9th instant, of disease causepL by improper and insufficient :fpddand'.want;Of proper ventilation.;.. The Jury also find thai George Middleton, master of the Dayspring, is guilty of the manslaughter of deceased.'

' | v ,: The third anniversary of the Primitive Methodist Chapel, Kensington, was 'celebrated on Sunday aniTuesday, the 27thlnld 29th inst.: On the Sabbath three sermons wese preached-r morning . and evening by the Rev. J. H- Williams, afternoon by the Key. H. Gheetham = ? (Independent). The congregations were large and attentive. On Tuesday, at 5 o'clock, a public tea took place in the chapel, which was well sustained by friends of the town and neigh borhood. An interesting public meeting was held in the chapel at 7 o'clock, under the presi dency of His Worship the Mayor of Norwood and Kensington (E. T. Smith, Esq.), and ad dressed by the Revs. H. Cheetham, E. Griffiths, J. G. Wright, J. H. Williams, and other friends. After the usual votes of thanks, the meeting was brought to a close in the general way. On the whole this has been an interest ing and profitable anniversary. The anniversary services of the Pres byterian Church, Clare, were held on the 27th and 28th September. On Sunday' the Bey, Janes Henderson, of Port Adelaide, preached morning and evening in the Town Hall to large, attentive audiences. The Rev. W. Davidson, pastor of the church, preached in the same place at half ?past 2 o'clock. On Mondav there were the usual tea and public meetings, both of which were well attended. The Sev. J. Hen derson gave his lecture on ' The Fall of Jeru salem,' which, notwithstanding that it occupied an hour and a half, was listened to with breathless attention to its close.' The weather was excellent, and the services were . a great success. We understand that the collections at the various services amounted to nearly £27, which go to the ordinary funds of the' congre gation. - ? . \- A numerously-attended public meeting was held in the Schoolroom, Bletchley, on Monday evening, September 21, for the purpose of passing a vote of thanks to. Messrs. Cheriton and Rogers, ; for their' successful endeavors to procure a Post-Office at Bletchley. Mr. Robert Foster was voted to the chair, and introduced the . business ' of the meeting. .Mr. Francis Edwards proposed '.That the thanks of the meeting be conveyed to Messrs.

Seconded by Mr. Charles Docherty, - and sup ported bylMr, James Hamlyn, . who spoke in very high terms of the respected gentlemen, who had . done the neighborhood such a large amount of good by satisfying the milch-felt want. . The quarterly soiree in : connection with rthe St. Patrick's Temperance Asso ciation and Guild of St. John Baptist was held at the St. Francis Xavier5* HaU on Wed nesday evening. There was a very fair attend ance, and the President of the Society presided. - The room was nicely decorated with banners bearing temperance mottoes, &c.; Solos, duets, &c;, were given by lady and gentlemen ama teurs, and some very good recitations were de livered. Several-fine selections were .rendered by the Catholic brass, band, and the amateur bellringers contributed in no small degree towards the: evening's entertainment. We should not forget to mention the comic song of 'Paddy's Wedding,' which was given in the Hibernian costume by Mr. Charles Kelly, who Was accompanied by his sister on the pianoforte. The; entertainment was over soon after 10, and was apparently enjoyed by alL ; We have beein favored with a letter written by one of the passengers in the Orient, on. heir late voyage home, f. which we have, no doubt will be interesting to many of our readers. : The Orient was the, first of the. superior class of clippers laid on for the Adelaide trade, and she is still a favorite with, those, who bare proved, her ' capabilities. The writer .says:- -'We. arrived in the London Docks by the good snip Orient on July. '22, having had what may be considered rather a long'voyage ; but ii reality . . it' was 'not so* if - you take . into account the sea- . son of the year when westerly winds so much - prevail. No doubt if Captain de Steiger had acted on his own judgment instead of being bound by his ' arrangements in Adelaide . with some of the passengers to [ go by the Cape of Good H6pe, he'. would! have made a much quicker passage by the Horn. But a few days more or less is little in comparison with otter things which make a. long voyage pleasant, or anxious and disagreeable. Our Bhip was to us eyerything that yraa desirable, a good sailor, passing almost every ship we sighted, and she is a dry, comfortable, and steady sea boat. Her commander, Captain de Steiger, is a good, seaman, having, I should think, a thorough knowledge' of his profession ; one in whom you feel entire, confidence,' and who is anxious to do all he can. for the comfort of: his passengers. The provisions were ample and first-rate during the whole voyage- In short we h&ve; not only no cause for complaint, but have much cause for thankfulness that our voyage home was both a safe and pleasant one.' ?'' [ A: gentleman' who was on .the Jupiter Greek diggings on Wednesday informs us that he saw -there a nugget -weighing 4oz. 2^ dwts, several others of ab3ut l^oz. and 1| ox.', besides a number of ; smaller. ? pieces. : In addition to this, various diggers showed him nice lots of gold they had washed out that morning, amounting altogether to a considerable quan tity. The field appears to be extending southward, some . having, been, found in that direction, where diggers used to main tain it - did not and could . not -exist. Our informant states that the successful diggers show their gold more readily to -strangers than to persohB living on the goldfield, this fact arising from ' the annoyance . of fossickers and loafers perpetually hanging' about 'the indus trious miner's holes and -wash-tubs. ALacepede Bay correspondent says :— ' Melbourne has commenced another locomo tive line,- like the one she has already working, , [tapping New South Wales -at Echuca. This, one is perfectly separate, and stretches near to Albury. It is about 170 miles long, and: will cost £1,750,000, or £10,000 per mile. The one Adelaide proposes from Port Caroline to the Border is 67 miles, at £4,000 per mUe, and would make one of the cheapest first-class highways known; of, 257 'miles, when added ,to'196;miles of sea communication at half the cost of a metalled road. Will South Aus tralia delay her work? ; But Melbourne, , laudably ' active . iSj . $y '.the last ac counts sending H.1LS.S; Victoria, the Com missioner of RaSlways,: the Hon. C.E. Jones, and other members of the Ministry, including the Mayorlof ' Melbourne^ J. S. Butters, Esq., in order to form a breakwater atPortland Bay, and a railway, to Hatnilt on. Will' South Aus tralians sleep?' Hamilton is 50 miles from the sea. ? This' line would be 148 miles long, with -let ours: through a hilly,, country tp reach the same point in the'Wimmera.tnat South Aus tralia can reach in 67. What is the money value of our' position if _we be up and doing ? The idea of Victorian railroad' extension over land from its length. and cost, appears to be abandoned. Our interest at this port, or what ever else strong' South Australian feelings may be called, compel; us simply to report these mall matters for *' ereneral information.'
