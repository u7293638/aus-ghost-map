The ' splendid performance of Tom GtriffiHuB on 'Wednesday last- will not readily, be. . forgpttcn by those who were Portunato enough to witneas it. Starting Bff the. 15yds. mark it wan thought . by most of those present that Myers would, run over him.; ; but Tom uses his head as muoh as his.feet, and kept up a nice easy itride for thtee . pa^ts of, the journey, saving himself for tbe run home. Myenr Dime at him about lSO;ds. from homey and it was. thought would beat him easily; ; but Griffiths responded, and putting on a fine spurt completely smothered Myers in ten yards, in fact so duheartencd^ him that he stoppad- running . altogether, and: walked in laafc. Griffiths had still a difficult cask set him; asrTobin teas loading .by ten yards' on coming into the straight, but this did not deter him . in the least,' go keeping up . his run he decreased the gap inch by ' inch- ? until five yards from home Tobin only led by a yard and a half.

Scott, 1 and, amoof runners, Mick Monnock. In his own country he had a great reputation for speed, and to start from -the .^cratch and win aa he did last Wednesday was'nothing new to Morshead.' .He-is a very fair goer, and has never been accused of ...lifting, while that he has great pace over a mile or so. has been , frequently proved. 7 He was t pretty well cock of the walk/ after i Libeau left the South Island, and when he went North to Auckland he showed; himielf a hot 'un till he had the misfortune, to; make a matoh-with little Sammy Goodman,.' tho' boy . walker,' then a procty old.boy of , about , nineteen. They had a , difficulty ; in, securing aground, and tho best they oould ?get was Dilworth's Paddock, , where the ?cup football, matohes were played ; that year. - The ground was fearfully .heavy, after ram, and Sammy got over the mud like a Canadian. ou snow shoes,, his light -weight stgjijiinfl^ to - him, while Morshead 'was Viompletely. bpa£ffi'^^t\e mucky going. v Goodman won ihe match' euei.y, covering, the twomlleainfourteehminutes . :aiid, a :yery feiw^Xlr, forget, hoy iriaDy), sworids. - .Mprthead.floon -after «iine* over. here, and hu: best performance previous to Wednesday's was winning a mile handicap at Carringtb'n Grounds ' and . ,the two-mile walk off 125yds at* the Highland Gathering on New Year's Day. ? It is a pity that . some of our fast peds do not' go in for Kugby football.' How they would go through ,tne ranks, of our present players,, for with the exception.oC Billy Macpherson and George Maiden, there is' hot a respectablb - runner playing for any of the clubs, -'fin our combined team ther^ is not a man who pan get inside Usee. . . If «uiy further proof ..wore wanted of the I necessity, of laying down .'additional tracks at the Carringtbn Gcourid. EO that five or six' men could start in a heat, the benefit hahdicap tendered to L. E. My era furnishes it. ? ' ' One :' hundred . and sleety : men . have nominated; and asfit is impossible at pre«. sent with four 'tracks', to . run- ; more than sixteen heats in onaught -without making the' men in the ;final run four, times, the promoter^haveannouncedthatthey willput the whole' of; the acceptors ; names in a box and. the first sii(ty,-ibur drawn oufc will only be allowed to .start. . This is very unsatis factory, as it debars a lot of runners from competing who might wish to do so, '-while it also; stUt3 any betting that may-: be :on the event.; .The; four.tracks have also been the cause of much infusion during the running of the last three handicaps, when mo'ro. men ' accepted than . there was room, .for, and had; to be put in heats ati .tho la3t -moment, when if unaera did not . turn .up.
