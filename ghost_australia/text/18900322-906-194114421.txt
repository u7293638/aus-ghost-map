The tender won I forgotten, The letter you did not write. The flower you might hare fent. dear, Are your hauutiug ghosts to-night. The Mono you might have lifted Out of a brother's wav. The hit of liuurtsome counsel Vou were hurri»i too ftiuch to kiv. The luviug touch of the hand, deal, The gvuitlc niul win- onii touc Th.it you luul no time nur thought for, With trouble enough of your owu. Tixyc little Acts of kindlier. tki easily out of r.iiud. Tla'so chnniNs tu lie angels Which ceuti ruorud- find — TJiey come in night and sih-nrv. Kuch chill, jvpixvichful wraitli, When hope is faint and flagging. Ami a blight liasdroppal <»:i faith.

And itV not the thing you do. dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heart -ache At the netting of the fun. Makoahet E. SANK K? EH.
