Double Bay Regatta. The Double Bay annual regatta was held in the bay last Saturday afternoon, under favourable aus pices. A gentle breeze prevailed, the water was calm, and the clouds that occasionally straggled across the sky, while not making- the . afternoon too dull, tempered the rays of the sun to a pleasant cool ness. The s.s. Newcastle, anchored in a convenient n'tion, was flagship of the day. Captain Skinner his boat in excellent order, and he and his officers did all in their power to make visitors comfortable. A good view of both rowing and sailing races could be obtained from the upperdecfc, while on the lower deck there were many sheltered spots where different parties gathered. The attendance compared favour ably with that of previous years, and the visitors in cluded not OBly the residents of Doable Bay and the surrounding districts, but aliso many from Sydney, North Shore, and Balmain. From the bay they were taken off to the flagboat in the committee's tender Agnoria, while the launch Bee plied at not toe frequent intervals between, the Circular Quay and- the Newcastle. All the spectators, however, were not on the flagboat. The bay pier was packed with people, and round the shore and at Darling Point -and Point Piper were assembled many a duster of enthusiastic devotees of the sport, while from Clark Island a fair number looked across to the regatta. The scene was extremely enlivening. .All round the harbour from Fort Denison to the Heads could be seen the white sails of the boats, darting hither and thither. The larger boats were scattered all over this expanse of water, while the course for the 16ft. dingies and the canvas dingies was limited to' the space between Shark Island and Fort Denison. Round the flagship were gathered rowing boats innumerable, of all sizes, and of pretty well every imaginable description, ranging from the 8ft. dingies to the man-of-war's cutters. The fewness of the yachts was noted on all hands. The little interest taken by yacht owners in the regatta was, perhaps, owing to the absence of yacht races. Two were put on the programme, but neither filled. The secretary, Mr. George HeUings, assisted by the committee, worked hard for the fixture, and well was the success that it obtained deserved. The committeemen were assiduous in looking after the comfort of those present, and it was agreed on all hands that their duty had been ably carried out. During the afternoon the Centennial Band, under Bandmaster Vassie, gave a number of popular selec tions, which appeared to be fully appreciated. The water police skiff was about the whole afternoon, and did good service in keeping the course clear.

The first race was Maiden Double Stulls, for which there were six entries, but Manly did not get up in tame to atari;. Glebe had all the best of the start, but North Shore, going very well, soon showed in front, and had a comfortable lead at Clark Island, with East Sydney and Mercantile together, some three lengths away. Sydney had been shaping-very badly, and at the turn touched the rocks, losing the fin. North Shore turned so badly that Mer cantile and East Sydney went by and raced for home. The former was greatly hampered with washboards, and the latter won by three lengths. North Shore beat Glebe on the post by a few feet, and Sydney gave up. E.S.R,C. (J. Andrioli, J. R. Reid), 1 ; M.k.C. (S. Daley, A Wil liams), 2; N.S.R-C. (R. Johnson, A. Bellette), 3; G.R.C. (L. Pettitt, W. Crispin), 4 ; S.R.C. (A. Lamb, A Cadell), o. Five crews came out for the Senior Double Sculls. The start was all in favour of East Sydney, and this crew held a strong lead up to Point Piper, followed by North Shore, Mercantile, Sydney, and Smith's East Sydney craw. A very close race took place for some distance further; but North Shore was hampering East Sydney considerably. The third crew, Mercantile, was a long way astern. At the turn off .Shark Island North Shore was two lengths from East Sydney, and five from Mercantile. On the second turn East Sydney came up and smartly out ont the leaders. The race for home was all in favour of North Shores which won by many lengths, and beat the last craw by a quarter of a mile. The rowing of all the craws was not np to senior form, bnt the best crew won. N.S.R.C. (F. Moor, H. Waters), 1; E.S.R.C. (C. Keenan, W. Bridson), 2; M.R.C. (F. Fike, F. Stayner), 3; S.R.C. (A Aldworth, J. E. Kennedy), 4; E.8.R.C. (J. A Smith, G. Biggs), 6. Nine men entered for the All-comers' Handicap in best light skiffs. Messenger got away with the lead, followed by Carter 'and Cormack. The others soon fell astern, and 'one man fell out of his boat. Messenger rowed very well, and drew away several lengths, while Garter and Cormack raced side by side, and Strettles was fourth. The first turn at Shark Island was made in the same order, bnt at the southern buoy Cormack closed on Carter, and claimed a foul, which was not allowed. Messenger won rather easily, and Carter just struggled home ahead of Cormack. C. A Messenger, list 61b (25lb), .1; T. CBrter, 9st 61b (15lb), 2; A Cormack, list (30lb), 3. Other competitors : T.

Mfller, feather. \- The Service Whalers' Race was well contested by five crews, and they finished in the following order H.M.8. Mild lira 1, H.M.8. Royalist 2, HALS. Wallaroo 3, HALS. Orlando, H.M.8. Karr&katta.; The Vernon Boats' race this time was hardly so interest ing as usual, as only two crews were entered. No donbt the regatta is held rather far away from the Vernon, and this may be the reason why the usual entry of four crews was nut made. Young Jack HeUings proved himself a good tub sculler as well as a swimmer and coxswain, and just managed to , win the tub race from Stannard and Barley. This event caused mora excitement than any of the ether races. In the Junior Double Sculls there were four crews, in cluding the North Shore, which had already won the senior race. East Sydney had a long start, but North Shore BT'1 Mercantile gradually drew up, while Manly fell astern, being badly boated. Turning at Clark Island North Shore lost some distance, and Mercantile cut out East Sydney. A very fine race for home then took place, and Mercantile came up steadily, until overlapping North Shore. Just at ' this time stroke in the latter beat broke his scull, and shortly the other scull went Meanwhile Mercantile had gone to the front, followed by East Sydney. M.R.C. (S. Daley, A.
