It was np/^pn derthat the Sweeper had'mistaken him for one of his nervpUB passengers. ' Withput|'taB^apv peajred by hia delay, . this gentleman's having, the least cause for haste, his mpvements were impatient and incessant, , Now he glanced. on' this side, now ;,pn that1, aifd, now over his. ahojilder behind him. A fbotstep heiivier than', common would seem occasionally to attract his attention ; l hia a,ttitu'de '.became 'that of an anxious listener ; and aa the stepa grew nearei1, ' ho would huddle his cloak about hia ears until' only hia pwrcin'g' eyes Were \ visible' ahboting oropiswise at the ; ''expected ' f ace., ; ' But' if he ^ w!a^ looking for iny particular indmdual| his search was fruitless. .' He Bee'med io expepfc (it would be so, for. aa;th6 man '.passed by (and.,1^ was always a' man), he would smile to himself' contemptuously, arid draw a1 long breath, aa Jf of reh'ef.. Andyet^ if h6; was afraid .of being1 recognised, it was strange that he .Bhoiild' stand so ieng, in .'so thronged 'a 'spot,', arid' .px-' posed to a glare of light on 'anight '^Jaeri1 privacy and gloom ^ere so easily attainable. ,' '.' ; Now 'that he is once more in m'Ption^ho.' passes swiftly along vacant spaces, and. walk's more slowly where 'there are knbtapf paa'aeri gers, accominodatirig his pace, so far as heoan do so without exciting observation,' to theh's, It would seem as if this gentleman had an un' conquerable aversion to being left alone. Having left the main thoroughfare, and plunged into a net of little by-streete, companionship is more difficult to obtain, and the stranger sd quickens his pace that he soon reaohea the' ob ject of his destination.' This is a plain unpre tentious building, but contrasting greatly1 with the other houses in the same street in point of size. It would make ten of any one of thosp mean and slatternly tonomonts. As no gentle mad'd ! hbuso- can be Situatod iii anohts, neighbor i ' hood, it must be ;,'sohie public Tiuilding,; and, in|deed, if the fog were not so dense', you might read over* its wide double' doors the word 'Refuge.'

Stand up I' - ; Without replying a syllable to this harangue; oxbept i,. by; a quiet smile, the young man rose ? ^from his seat, as thongh politely aoknowledg*-'' ing the presence of a stranger, rather than cbeying a command. 'So you are going to be a'sohoclmaBter, I understand,': observed ;the fainter encouragingly. ' The chaplain . here has been bo good as to promise me such n place,' returned the lad with courtsey, rather than deference. 'Why don't you say sir?' inquiMdthOepnly-mYBter savagely.

'Just so:; but still, ifjou Lad any better offer, you would not heBit*tti to take it. The fact is, I am a painter, awii I came here, for. a .atudy-r-a model— -for a parti cular picture.

You have thda great advantage in ray ' eyea ; over those who might suit me aa well in other respects: you have a story to tell, and will be able to narrate it so as to interest me.

' - ;:?????.*« You -have a shrewd eye to the future, young man; and, you are right. Well, even afterwards, I shall find something for you to do,. You will mix my colors ; you may be my amanuensis ; you will have to arragne my library' (the painter suddenly turned deadly white) ; ',' yea, my &w; books will be under your care. I am not a rieh man— very far from it; but lean make it worth your while.' 'Come, sir,' interposed Curtis sullenly, much displeased that the painter should be holding go long and apparently so friendly a parley with his mortal foe ; ' it is just upon closing-tima. I am sorry we have nothing to suit you; better luck next time.— Sit ' down , you boy, to table: here's your supper, and mind youjre thankful for it.' A man had entered, bearing a quantity of tin mugs, and a basketful of hunches of bread. 'Stop a little, Curtis,' said the painter ;-' I will make it worth your while to do BOi' ' When; ;I'ye fetched the milk and water, you must go, sir,' returned the deputy-maater; ' that's our rule, even with subscribers. Our meal here ain't a - beast show.' 'That fellow lik6B you so ill, that Jie even quarrels with me for speaking to you,' obs'srved the painter significantly. ?' You will have Ilia insolence to endure for days, perhaps /weeks, before you get this appointment you i apeak of.' ' And when could I get yours, , air ?' ' Immediately. There is a spare room ; at my lodgings':; and I can certainly give you a better supper than this will be. You can enter ? upon your duties to-morrow morning. Willi you come with me now, at once ?' ' What ! j in these rags, sir?' ? - ; ' Pooh I what of that? In my eyes, poverty i is hot ' disgraceful, but only picturesque ; be- 1 , sides, it is as dark as the devil to-night,; and i aiobody will see you. To-morrow, you shall be ' rigged out in one of my old suits: wo are; about of a ' size, I think.'^ 'You are very; good,-siri' said the young man gratefully;; ..' bat I don't like to leave this place without a' word 'of, thanks to the chaplain.

'You must; ichofljae^ between the chaplain and myself at; oncejVbUDg sir.' It was curious to watch the; 'expressive play of the lad's features ; the com- ^ 'hat of astrojpg will with one yet stronger;; determination to refuse, yet regret at having to: do bo ; hesitation between two courses— the one; .more dutiful, the other more attractive. ' Now, ? : young shaver, here's your eky- blue, and mindj ; it don't get into your head,' ejaculated the 'deputy -master with a. wink addressed -to the j general public ; and a ' servile laugh broke j forth from the abjeots round the table. 'I accept your effer, sir,' exclaimed the young f.maa eagerly. 'I will' leave this 'place/to- ; jnigtit; at once, if you please. My name is ' OhdrleB Steenl Let me know.'I pray you, to. whom I am indebted for resone from suoh a fen?' The painter, with a, smile of triumph, drew forth his card-case, and handed to tho lad' Yhis .name and address.
