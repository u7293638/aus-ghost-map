[A PANTOMIME REHEARSAL. BY L. C. Pantomime is full upon us again Harlequin, pantaloon, columbine, dwarf, giant, fairy, elf, and sprite, tricked in fantastic guise, once more pass before us in merry procession The dazzling; glory of the transformation scene, the bewilder- ing intricacy of complicated thousand-fold bal- lets, are here to tickle the fancy of the grown-up jaded, and excite the mysterious wonder of the susceptible young The average person accepts all this theatrical magnificence in a calm way To him each Christmas, like the pudding and the indigestion, it simply " comes " He does not trouble his head much about all that leads up to is the in- stating brain, the controlling hand, the army of carpenters, upholsterers, scene shifters, dressers, mechanicians', chorus, ballet, super, the months and months of careful thought, the harassing round of rehearsals, the thought of excision and interpolation of stage grouping, the drilling and drilling of refractory ballets and choruses all those things that go to prematurely ago a conscientious stage manager Nor is there any reason why he should But the time preparatory to a pantomime is full of interesting experience that once in a way is worth remembering Short shrift should be given to the foolish spoil sport who delights to remind you that at a theatre all is tinsel, the jewels paste, the crowns of cardboard, the golden goblets of tin, the complexions and the rich tresses not nature's Without being guilty of this ineptitude we may be allowed to, in friendly fashion, raise a corner of the curtain that hides the mystery of a panto- mime in embryo An empty theatre by day is a strange sight, but its emptiness by night at a pantomime rehearsal is far more wonder compell- ing The rows and rows of seats stiffly ranged with their dust cloth coverings are disconcerting There, you mused, sat the lovely Miss X- the other night, a dream of beauty , yonder lolled Mr Y-, that persistent theatre-goer, and here, in vulgar balk, squatted Mrs Z-, fat and fifty, This only in passing, for the stage commands our chief interest. The stage manager in shirt slow as is the presiding deity, though his anger and ferocious energy would with some consign him to the sovereignty of a lower region A scenery rehearsal is gone through Certain " bets " are stubborn and refuse to let themselves be fixed in suitable fashion The carpenters are anathematised, the scene shifters apostrophised with copious vocabulary Those concerned in a particular scene fairies, rustics, and funny oomedmn-j,o through their parts It will not do , " the wooden " is the dictum, and over it they go again and again till something nearer to form is attained Later, vi, of have choruses carolling lustily, ballets floating in and out of many figures, and hosts of supers marching and counter marching All are in the distressing plainness of everyday dress, and the scene is one of uncom- promising comedy Surely, never were a public admitted to any pantomime that afforded such scope for diversion Slowly out of chaos order begins to ev love No one stage manager, ballet mistress, or scene shifters knows how it comes about, but on the opening night things somehow shape themselves, and, many curious to relate, the pantomime is gone through, if not brilliantly, without serious bitch So much for the inside of the theatre There is, however, another play going on outside in the purlieus of the theatre that rivals its follow within for colour, viv city, and human interest On the pavement around the stage door is con- gregated a group of girls, and close by are some young men of di nt) attire moths attracted to the name of theatrical beauty These oaths are toying with cigarettes, and occasionally having a word or two with one or more of the girls as they come and go, for the group is continually being augmented and thinned Some young follows strolling along the street are arrested by the sight of the throng round the stage door and stop for a moment to take in the situation One say a to the others " Wait while I stand like an actor The) '11 think I'm on the boards here," and with a leer he strikes an attitude, cocks his hat on one side, displaying a curl on the forehead, div cs his hands into his breeches pockets, and deeply inhales the smoke of his cigarette Turning to his coupon one he says loftily, "Wotprice me?" The girl's keep rushing in and out of the stage door They emerge, take a turn or two up and down the street, have a few words with a "boy," and re-enter Out again, dive into the adjacent f fruitshop, and wonderful creatures enthuse over a bottle of gingerbeer Out again, capture a bag of fruit and some sponge cakes, and triumphantly return to share them with their sister choristers or ballet dancers within Left to them selves their living is of the simplest, but the fortune of the life they are in brings about strange inter-sandwiehmgs, so that one night it is the modest sponge cake and gingerbeer and the next it is Supper after the theatre with champagne, oysters, an omelette, asparagus, and olives But they are cosmopolitan girls, and genially prepared to take life as it comes quite nonchalant about the everyday horrors of the table at a poor boarding-house or a second or third rate hotel, and yet some of them able to appreciate with the gusto of a gourmet the delicacies of a good table and the bouquet of fine wine They present a strange medley of hats There is the neat sailor straw with its band of black ribbon that seems to vouch for the quiet taste of its wearer the castle hat (as I call it for want of a better name), with its wall of fortification rising sheer from the rim all round the simple cap, the wide Soft straw, the radiant picture hat, the hat decked with resplendent feathers. soft muslin creations, captivating white hoods, Kate. Greenaway bonnets hats big, hats small, hats coquettish, hats rakish, hats awesome, hats horrible millinery in all its shades shapes, and BL7e8 In the matter of costume, blouses seem to claim the first place Some are loose and prettily negligee, others trim and neat, others again care- less and sloppy There are tailor-made dresses, pink prints, and white muslin confections The) have their hair fixed in various delightful ways you see it done up in those roguish little knots, I know not what they are called but that seemed to be introduced here by the American girls playing in Chinatown "-m Simple plaits down the back in masses of duty glor), m bewildering knots and knobs, and with others feeling is caught up straight from the back into a coil the top of the head, leaving seductive curls about the nape of the neck to allure one from the observa- tion of more serious and more reasonable subjects Then demeanour is a study in the art of diagnosis All are at once distinguishable by of red swinging walk an easy carriage an upright grit, that marks them from the other city girls who from time to time pass along the pave- ment by the stage door Some perchance mar their port by a jaunt), aggressive mo repent of their bodies as they wall, but they are in a minority The remarkable thing is that of the swarm of girls there are so few to whom you feel you would if you knew nothing about them, apply the description " theatrical " They do not in the least carry the sense of this adjective in their appearance It is, it seems, only another of the many examples of that crude gene- ill nation to which people are so prone to it at all true that members of the theatrical profession alw iva carry about with them the brand of their work impressed in their clothing Can we fairly say this of the shining lights of the theatre, those stars in the dramatic firmament upon whom the multitude are SO astronomically fond of levelling their telescopes, and yy those over) by variation in place, time, and mood is observed by this host of interested ones with a fidelity and eagerness that would do credit to a rapt astronomer royal watch- ing the transit of Venus i Opinions will differ, but on the whole I think it is not And about the lesser lights, it is possible to speak with more certitude, at least on the woman side They as a class dress and move like natural, bright, self possessed, independent girls - the dominant note, quietness with merriment We can call an apt comparison from the literary ranks, when we consider this question of the adherent denoting the corporation to which he belongs Do we look for, as the signs of J. literary man, an individual with a greasy coat, fra) ed cuffs, unkempt hair, and hands not innocent of ink stains ' Some would say so, or at least would declare that a general untidiness would be evident This is about as true as the idea that a man with Bohemian tastes must have long hair and so hardly) on speaking terms with soap and water Du Maurier know better when he gave us in " Trilby " the story of that happy band of brothers who, after all, are but the pale ghosts of Murger's more vigorous and picturesque trio in his splendid Vie de Be home " New comes a moment when someone appears at the stage door, a signal is made that without words flies round, oven being understood by a group at the street corner some hundred yards away, who relinquish the fascinations of street corner chatter and burr) down, and soon the lot are within the theatre and quiet reigns The waiting brigade" took disconsolate. They wheel round and go off for a drink Has the world altered much ? Let us glance back a few hundred years Old Samuel Pepys speaks for us "To the King house, where going in for Knapp, the play being done, I did see Beck Marshall come dressed off the stairs, and looked mighty fine and pretty and noble and also Nell in her boy's clothes, mighty pretty But, Lord ' their confidence and how many men do hover about them as soon as they come off the stage, and how confident they are in their talk '" Not much, you will say This outside pantomime proceeds through the evening-work interlarded with periods of gossip, sauntering, and consumption of fruit and ginger beer The Post Office clock booms out the hours, and when the sound of 11 of the clock strikes the car of pallid night the end of the proceedings is still far off But the well-groomed brigade still stuck nobly to their posts Their fortitude and con- stancy are touching to behold Just now two girls who have been taking a breather come back to the stage door, and on leaving the young exquisite who is escorting them say, "Now, don't wait, there's a good fellow, for we'll be worried over you It may be 3 in the morning before we're done The stage manager is form and won't let us go till we do things as he wants to see them " He says " All right then, girls, I won't wait Good night" The brigade took uneasy, stand first on one foot and then on the other, and vanish like smoke into the gloom The streets are beginning to empty and the foot- falls to echo down the deserted thoroughfares A lumbering coff co-stars pushed by two men good by) to take up its all-night station at an accustomed street corner Cabs at a snail's pace wander aimlessly past the horses, the cabs, and the drivers the picture of listless boredom The city looks blaze, the result of Christmas over-feeding It has no pulse, or at best but a flaccid one The feel of a city's heart-beat is weird Now all is sparkle, fyfe, offer essence, a sort of carnival time, with invisible but perfectly palpable confetti merrily striking and impressing your understand- ing Now, on the other hand, things are glum and spiritless, a brooding dulness is over all, and the city says, " Alack, aback " Ah, me I would I were dead " Again a more sombre note is struck, and gTuesomo und grisly shapes seem keeping revel You start when you come suddenly on the shadow of some grim sentinel lamp- post The banks of the great clock seems to vibrate with unusual intensity, and it takes the tone of a stern moralist relentlessly chiding you The streets are black, terrifying avenues, leading straight to the depths of Avernus, the occasional radiation from the scattered lamps but serving to accentuate the gloom This, however, is usually in the early hours of the morning, and it is a pulse of the city beyond the experience of those who keep " elders' hours '* Who has not experienced these alternations-of what shall I say of temper, of that conglomeration of brick, mortar, and humanity we call a city? All must know it in some degree London, Paris, and Vienna has each its distinctive pulse, just as Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide has each its similar distinctive manifestation However, I yy ander, wander into vogue imagin- ings when I have before me such concrete realities as a pantomime rehearsal, a bevy of charming girls, and the study of the group of stolidly waiting elegant young men But the stage manager is to storm and reiterate his directions for another hour or two, the girls have vanished off the pavement, the brigade has moved on night is moving on, so are lost trams why should we carry 5
