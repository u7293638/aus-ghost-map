THE EAST SYDNEY CONTEST. Both the candidates for East Sydney were actively engaged last evening soliciting the suffrages of the electors Mr Barton addressed a gathering from one of the windows of Keary's Hotel, at the top of William-street, and had a favourable reception Mr O O Beale presided, and amongst the gentlemen noticed in the room from which the Attorney-General spoke woiothoHon R E O'Connor (Minister for Justice), Mr W Stephen (secretary to the Attorney-General), Mr A C Fraser (Under-Secretary for Justice), and Mr Pinhey (Registrar-General) Mr Burton addressed the audience in substantially the same terms as those which he employed at the New Masonic Hall on Friday evening last In reply to questions, he said that if he were defeated he would not accept a seat in the Upper House, that he was rather inclined to support an elective Upper House, but was not prepared to say upon what principle election to that Chamber should be that his sy inpatients were in favour of a Government which gave the freest scope to the will of the people Heralding the eight-hour question, he would notgivohis support to any measure which would provide for punishing a man for using his strong light ulm, as he greatly objected to any measure that would take aw up a man's liberty A vote of confidence in Mr Barton was proposed by Mr R Atkinson Price, seconded by Mr James Hunt, supported by the lion It E O'Connor, and earned almost unanimously Mr Grantham addressed gatherings of the doctors from the balconies of the New Zealand Hotel, Yurong street, Woolloomooloo, and the Bien cry Hotel, Oxford- street, Paddington, and in both Cases had friendly audiences Mr J F Mulhall presided at the former, and Mr E Moremon (president of the East Sydney Labour Electoral League at the latter gathering Mr Grantham speech was in thorough hope tition of that already reported and embodied a severe criticism of the conduct of Mr Burton, whom he accused of have been guilty of political chicanery At the first meeting the vote of confidence was moved by Mr Alexander M'Lachlan, and seconded by Mr. H C Cato, and at the second it was moved by Mr W P Johnson and SEConded by Mr J C Watson In both cases the motion was carried, there being only one or two dissolution Respecting the East Sydney election, Mr Pulsford, the late secretary of the Freetrade and Liberal Association, writes "Apparently in some quarters there is an idea that the freetraders are not doing their duty in East Sydney The idea springs from an insufficient grasp of existing facts and of future prospects Certainly an attack is being made at this moment on the freetrade policy of the country but the attack is one that cannot reasonably be expected to succeed whilst the manner in which the attack is being led, and the violence that is being placed on an expectation of treachery, are elements that in the end will discredit and weaken the party of trade restrict-, tion 1 The constitution of the Legislative Assembly to-day is precisely the same as it was on the several previous occasions during the session when the efforts to re-open the fiscal controversy ended in failure It is not denied that the number of members who personally support a trade restriction policy is greater than the number of those who support free fr side, but on the other hand it cannot be denied that the restrictions pint)- as a parting outnumbered by the total representing the aggregate of the free trade party which combined with the labour party, who are pledged against a reopening of the fiscal con honors How, then, can a trade restrictive tariff be carried in the present rirhauiLiitP Clearly, only in one way that is, by treachery on the part of the labour members if they choose to ignore the free trade vote, which was the main use of their election, and to be false to their pledges then, and only then, can Mr Dibbs carry his restrictive to off Freetraders at present need be under no excitement, and above all the need not join the new Ministry in insulting the labor members with the assumption that inherit they are already traitors As far as this Parliament is concerned, trousers controversy has been closed Evidently the Dibbs Ministry expect to persuade the labour members to break their pledges on this point If they succeed, they will be the time for need rulers to bestir themselves With regard to the East Sydney election, the contention that a Minister should not be open sod on presenting himself for the election is a sound one, day says providing the contingency has not arisen, which presumably is at the root of this part of our Constitution It may be presumed lb it this provision was not meant to foster mere contests for Parliamentary honours), but to prevent Ministers misrepresenting their constituents Mr Barton was elected to light for federation, and was elected for this purpose almost wholly by a freetrade vote having been so effected, it is a tolerably cool thing for Mr Barton to assume that he ought to be let alone while he assists Mr Dibbs to remodel the fiscal policy in a manner simply abhorrent to his constituents Opposition to Mr Barton is therefore clearly justifiable Of one so he is well aware that he would not at present have the ghost of a chance of being returned in a single handed contest with a representative freetrader but he knew a he has a good chance against a labour candidate, and also a good chance against two candidates one a freetrader and one a labour candidate The question arises, whether the freetraders to do in view the fact that a 1 labour t candidate in already in the field and sure to take a course der one vote? In reply to this question I should say that ficUrudois ought to go straight for Ali Grantham, the labour candidate Had the real rulers put a man in the field directly the vacancy arose it is possible that Mr Grantham would not have come out, but now that he is in the field it is better, considering all the circum stances, for the freetraders to Hipp at him a rather than cause a further division of the votes by bringing out a special candidate of the own It is my interest n to do my best dunn of the week to promote Mr aianlhaiii's return, but I wish to Blythen Ida to entirely usa private member of the fro lindo j city and with the knowledge that some of my friends differ with me as to the course which it is most desirable for us to follow in the present emergency "
