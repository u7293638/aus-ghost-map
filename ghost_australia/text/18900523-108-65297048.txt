PORTFOLIO. WHrMSo.-rTDE.-We say in our Creed. speaking of the Holy Ghost--" the Lord and giver of life." This is true. And yet God the Father giveth life; and God the Son quickeneth whom He will. Yet, in the economy of salvation, it seems to be the special ministry of the Holy Ghost to give spiritual life to the souls of poor sinners. Therefore Christians are said to be born of the Spirit ; and the gifts of grace and holi ness, which adorn mankind, are called the fruits of the Spirit : and to he spiritually minded is life, saith the Apostle. Now, when we reflect on the cold and barren and lifeless condition of mankind, with regard to God; when we actually see how careless even multitudes of professing Christians are, about spiritual realities ; when we contrast our former self with our present self, or con sider ever now how little we are influenced, reallyU influenced by the grace of God, what a Comforter doth the blessed Spirit seem. We would not for ten thousand worlds be dead in trespasses and sins. Who hath quickened us? The Holy Ghost. Are we all really alive, or buried alive, some of us? "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light." There is no miraculous display, as once there was, but there is the same divine Agent; and He giveth life to as many now as ever. And is it not a comfort to have life Do we not bless God for our creation ? If natural life is a blessing, what shall we account spiritual life! If to live on God's earth, see its beauties, hear its music, be ravished by its charms, is a comfort and a blessing; oh ! what a much greater com fort and a blessing it is to live in Christ's Church, to sing. His praises, to experience His grace, to bIe constrained by His love ! This is life. and this the blessed Comforter accomplished for us, and in us; no marvel that we pray to God always-" Take not Thy Holy Spirit from us." If le leaves us, we die.-Sermons by a CountryJParsons.
