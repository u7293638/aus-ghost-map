If there is any true Christianity; mustrit not have exist-' ed among those tr&ined;^y the ApoStles and their unhiediate discipbea^ - In the. Second Boojc. of Machabe^s, Chapter. 19, parses 43, 44, 45, 46, .we find t^at Judas Machabaeus, the chief and High £ rie'sf pf the ' Jewish 'na tion, sent money to- Jerusalem to have a ser vice ottered, ia ;ther ten&jjjfle; for-the . soldiers who had -been elain4i£ battle^;. Here are the worde— ' And m&kjng; ^ gathering he sent twelve thousand drachmfe oftflvet td'Jer\l6a lem'for sacrifice to be 'offered for the sins of the~de&d; thinking well.and religiously ccn cerning the resuirreotiop. ,j For i! he had not hoped that they that were slain, should rise agaia it wodld have seeffiied superfluous and vain to pray for tlie dead. And because he; considered that they who- ? hiad fallen asleep, with godliness- had great graca . laid -;vip for. them, .it is therefore, a. holy thought topray for the dead that they may loosed from . their sins.' What'boiild be 'plainer and more direct ? In theBe words and reflections of the sacced writer we have devotion for the dead — devotion which shows itself to us in all itB beaaty-ln 'the CatUo&c; Churoh. From this text it follows th th^^rst'place that all the penalties of sin are not paid, and tbat all' the^relica of sin are pot washed away , at death. Judas lifcd sacrifice olfered for the sins of the dead^ 'Se^Would not ha^e done so if there wasiio aw4o be expiated in thft^ other life, as tbe impure. Knox and his fol lowers would h%ve us .believe. .

Butthe ' ' ' OPPONENT'S of THIS.CONSOLINiJ D0CTEINE say that this Book is not canonical, How do they'know,? Let theip prove' 'if it ia not. We^have the same 'probfs for 'these books as fovihe rest-of the^ilile. It is declared6o by the:- Catholic Church... The Lutherans have them in. their Bible, Bt. Clement, of Alexandria, Origen, St. Cyprian, Tertullian, St. John Chrysostonvtiegesippus, St. Jer ome, St. . Ambrose? ^St.' Augustine. They were declared canonical and inspired by the Sixth Council of CaTfchage jin 419, at which 218 bishops and two legates of the Pope were present. They were inserted - before that time fin the Alexandrian version of the Septuagint in the Coptic, Ethiopian, Syraic, Armenian, Sclavonic,, .gjid Sii^aite veraions. The second objection is. that these texts prove too rtiuch -and, - therefore, ' nothing at all, because under the'teoafs of the^slain were foui^ the doiiaries -of t^p . idols,, and, there: ? fore Judas prayed lo^ tjipse who were damn ed. How futile is this' objection. What proof can be giVenH£lA tti^y died in mortal sin ? They may hax4 bteti ignorant of the laws prohibiting from taking pr' appropriat ing these .things ; prof .they were aware .of it, they may have repented before they breathed their last. :'it was the part of a charitable and pious man such 'as*!

There must be sins then that can be remitted in the future life iihless ire go po far as to say that Christ spokfe foolishly and abeurdi.dly, i'St. Gregory, Lib. jL,~Diifl, ch. 39) Vcn. Bede cb. 3, S. Marci, S. Bernard Sermon 6f in Can and Catholic writers generally interpret tbifl text in the samb sen£e ds St Augustine— 2nd. In bis sermon on the MOtibt Christ says fMatt. v. ch., v. 25 and 26), ' Be at agree ment with thy adversary betimes whilst thou art in the way with with biro, lest perhaps the adversary deliver tb'ee to the judge, and the Judge deliver thee to tbe officer, and thou be cast into prison,' amen, I say to thee thou shalt not go cut from thence till thou repay the last farthing.' To be.sure these words can ?be understood of a Judge and prison on this earth. ' But if we refer to tbe chapter in whioh St. Luke ch. 12,'. relates tbem tbe oontext^there* will . lead us to understand them solely of the judgment of God, There 'we read 'Be you then also ready, for at what hour you think not the Son of Man will come.' This fehows he Epe&ke; of a future judgment againat which we should prepare ourselves. -Yh(m then he says, thou shalt not' . we mus\ understand that there is a 'prison in the othef life -from wliicb the soul is set free after it has paid its small debts, after it hae ?Ba&fl;^ WodJn'iuU for them. In his flrsV episliq tq ibe pprjnthians 8 eh., 2 v. St. ^ad'^ysrotti^fdandaUon'no man can lay, hutffiAt which' is laid, which is Christ Jesus. Now if any man build upon this foundation -gold,' «ilw,^$rectous ..etonea, wood, bay, ;stubble, every man's work shall be manifest, fbr the day of the Lord shall declare it, be cause it shalFtSS'lSfailSflnllHTaWi the fire shall try e^eryjnBtfs work of what sort it is. H any min's abide 'which he hath built thereon, he stall' refei^ei a reward. If anyjsa^'s work btm-)%e shall eufler loss, but be himself yet. to at. tyjhr*. The fontiSation Aientioned is Christ and bis Holy, Doctrine, or true faith in him enlir enKl by charity. Hhe gold, silver, precious st^naii denote, tho more perfect preaching and practice of {he Gospel, the wood, hay, and stubbie the .preaching of the Corinthian teaciefs wb'o iffeoted human eloquence, and made'a^fliepfiiy of ^ words, they also include thai praotioe of -€be/Gospel whioh is mixed with small sins, and imperfections. . THE HAY OF IIIE LORD and - the trial by fire in the particular judg ment which takes place - immediately after death shall disclose what sort every man's work has^ been. It . is not easy to form a judgment of a .man's work during life, but after death tbe fire ol God's judgment shall reveal it. They whose works are like wood, bay, and stubble, on this acoount cannot stand the fire shall suffer loss however because they bnilt upon the right foundation, having died in true faith, and in grace, though with imperfections they thallte tdved yet to at by fire. We can .draw. -two conclusions from tbis text, first: that there are venial -ins which are denoted by wood and stubble, and secondly that ' THEBE 19 A'FCBOATOBY which is a place of punishment in whioh they who -have bail) up .wood, hay, and stubble that is sins differing in degree, but still not mortal, are purified until they are fit for heaven* St.' Ambrose understands this text in this sense; Here are his words: When Paul says, |Tet so as by fire' he shows in deed that he will.be saved, but that he shall suffer ths punishment of fire, that purified byjfire he may be 'eaved, and notjlike the damned be -tormented for ever with eternal fire. This interpretation is the more general opiuion among the Greek Latin Doctors. 'Now there are thrfee objections by our adver saries against this interpretation. 1. By fire we are to understand the trials of this life. 2. By fin means the fire of hell. 3. Fhe judgment. of-God approving of what is true, and condemning false doctrine. None of these objections hold. The first does not -hold beoause -tbe time of this present life is loot a certain ,«$, ij&ci;/ui day suoh as the apostjje .jpdicatei^Ihe, epaoe. .of this life is rnoi,.-»TlS3ni3cnpf5re.&e;d'ay6fthetiord, but our day; -whilst on the other hand the spaoe 6f the otheif life ls called the day of the Lord, and not oars, see St. Luke, 19 eh. 42 v. 22chl S3v,; Sopboniaa l ch. 14 v., also Joel, 11-ch. 1 and 2 v, iforeover the Apostle says that the day of the Lord, shall declare, eto. Now the present time does not declare this, for the just suffer tribulations in this life, as well .as . the -unjust. The second objection 'does not hold, .that. Js, by fire means hell. The .fire of which the A.post!e speaks shall try every man's work, whether it be gold, etc. But the fire of hell can lay no claim to gold, silver, or precious Stone ; neither can it touch wood, hay, etc., for they who build up suoh things will be caved, though it be by fire. ? T&E; HBH or ttttt. is not a saving fire; therefore it must be tbe fire of Purgatory. The third objection can not stand because the Apostle says ' he shall suffer loss..' Now tbe judgment at the hour of 'death by whioh false doctrine is con demned, and -errors are consumed like hay, shall- cause no loss, but great gain, for it will lay bare to us tbe truth. Uoreover, in that interpretation, all would be saved by fire, whioh .woulcl be against tbe distinction of the Apostle, who says those' only shall be saved by firs, who, having true faith in Christ, have built 'on it. wood, hay, and stubble. Another objection . raised against our inter pretation is that, when it is said he shall be saved, yet ' so as by firs; the words to at ex press a similitude, or lilreness, but not the truth or what really takes place. But to givs them this interpretation would acoord badly with this other text frop the Gospel of St. John, 1 ch.' 14 v., ' And we saw his glory as it was.' ' 'In the Greek' and Latin the same word is use-i in: bgtli texts. In Et. John it expresses pot thelikenefes. but the truth and the.r^itrof-the 'On.ly.-bCgotten. I shall now give' V on a, few quotations from the earliest writers of (£e Church. , Tertullian, who died about' the 'Tear 220, when speaking of certain apbsldieM ?fraditiofcs,:' W says Lib de Cor., on. 3;- - We make « VSiBLl OFFERINGS TOE.

See his epifctle.' 66. Can : there be anything clearer. Again, St. Basil, who belongs to the 3rd century, in speaking of the Athletes of God he says that -when they have arrived at the end ofiife if they be fobnd to bave retained either wounds after the contests, or any stains or relics of sin they thould be detained, but it without them . -hey would be translated to rest; in Psalm'7. Therefore, DiVm PRAYS roa THE PRKSEHT it fUTUBS LIFB. Therefore there are some detained. St. Epipbaniut. who livedjin the fourth century and , refuted Aerius,. the first author of Presbyteriaiiism, ssys: — 'But the prayerB that are offered.up to the dead are useful to them.'— (Haer.'76.) 8t; Cyril of Jerusalem, St. Chiy stratum,'.' St. Jerome, St.. Augustine, who tells ub that his mother St. Monica spoke thus to him:— 'Place this body any where, be Bot iroubleS about it. This only I a'sV of you that you remember me at tbe altar of the Lord wherever you be.' I might easily multiply quot&tlona;, in fact I have thirty-sey&h;^uotations from the Fathers *1 the Ohitfoh.* This, doctrine is admitted by the Ritualists aud others, among whom are eminent Protestant Prelates. In the first liturgy of the Churoh of England, whioh ! irai dnlwn up b/ Crammer and Eiiley, ftnd | deolarsd by Act of Varliamsnt to hats been framed by inspiration of the Holy Ghost, there is an express prayer for the dead that ' God would grant them mercy aud ever lasting peace.' — (See Collie 's Eco. His. vol. II, p. 267.) The Bishop of Exeter, in 1818, in a sermon published, prays for the soul ol Princess Charlotte ' as far as this is lawful and profitable.' — (Cellier's Hist.) The following Bishops of Church of England be lieved that the dead ought to be prayed top Andrews, Usher, Montague, Taylor, Forbes; Sheldon, Barrow {of St. AsaphB), and Bland ferd also Dr. Johnson. The Bev. Mr. Stewart says that the doctrine bas a Pagan origin, because he finds some lines in Virgil on it. In reply I say. that if YirgU and other heathens, ancient and modern, likewise Mahomet and hie diecipleB together with the Protestant writers quoted above have em braced this doctrine, it only shows how conformable il is to the diotates of natural religion. We know from Soripture 'tbat the just man fails seven times a day.' — (Prov.!4thChap„ 17 vet.) 'lhat men must give an account of every idle word that they speak. — (Matt- 12 ohap . 36 verse.) j WHAT TBBN VTLL BXCOHS kDULJ which are surprised by a sudden death. We are sure from Scripture and reason that no thing defiled 'shall enter heaven' (Rev. 21 sap. 27 v.). 'Will God make no distinction in godliness as Parson Stewart would have us maintain. Will he Joondemn to the same eternal punishment the poor child who bas died under tbe guilt of a lie of excuse and tbe abandoned wretch who has died in the act of murdering his father. To say he will is so monstroui a doctrine in itself, aud s6 contrary to Scripture. .which declares tbat God renders to every man .according to hii deeds ( Rom. 11 c. ? v.) that it seems to be universally exploded. Therefore thore is a Purgatory, and the alms, prayers, and sacrifices of the faithful can benefit them. Let us sum tip the evidence. Tbe DOOICA OF IDBOATOBY was universally believed by all Christians of the East and the West from tbe Apostles till the fourth century, when it was denied by Aerius wbo was condemned and avoided by all as a criminal innovator. From that to tihe 16th century it was believed by all except the Reformers. At the present time more than 400 millions af Christians believe in it, and have never had any doubt about it. The Scriptures, both Old and New Testa ments , sustain the belief. The 'universal consent of all nations at all times and hi all places of the learned as well as of the illiter- , ate about the existence of a middle state be tween heaven and bell fo; the punishment of ' small offenders shows that they had received this notion originally by a divine revelation. J The testimony of all the Fathers and Doctors of hoth Oriental and Western churches prove it. Lastly, the Dogma of Purgatory Is per- 1 fectly in accordance with reason and God's mercy. He concluded his address by thanking the congregation for the patient hearing they bad given hint, and hoping that bis re marks would have the effect of making them think and inquire for themselves , and they ? would see that the doctrine was both a scriptural and reasonable one.
