LINES ON THE SCOTIC DINNER. Hall! longed-for dish i aye, three times hall I The want o' ye, my youthfu' meal, Has been to me a daily wail O' noo sma' kind, Since I across the Forth set sail A hoam to find. MIy hopes to see your form ano mair, An item o' my humble fare, Ho? long been blasted into air, Past a' redemption; Ioero cooks o' ye are unco rare, Few merit mention. Neeoo, CoGude be praised, your e0nsi0 face, O'er which my forefolk--honest race Would say a long an' solemn grace, A gold Scotch eloil, Each year my humble board shall grace, Just like yoursel'. Your worth's aboon my humble paise ; Whichever way my voice I'd raise, In screeds o' print or rhyming lays, I'd fail to vaunt Your noble worth-confessed always As I would want. Ye'ro noething thought o' here ava, By rich or poor, by great or smne'; Beef, bacon, torkey, is the law, Wi' routh o' beer; An' nought but goose will please their maw In times o' cheer. It grieves me unco much to hear Those carrion eaters at ye sneer, An' wi an assured horror leer, Ca' ye "hogg's stow;" While they feast not your compoer The prejudiced crew. The very quack, ghost haunted wight, Wha lives by mankind taking flight To dungeons dark, or realms bright, Speak o' your merit, An' says the folk gae seldom gyte Whaur ye'ro a diet. The truth o' this can't be rescind Whour can be seen amang mankind 3Iair stalwart men than the brave hind That haudo the plough; Wha seldom has on aught else dined His halelife through. lWhen John Bull bhoasts o' his roast beef, An' how its made him the warl's chief, I aye can find some sma' relief Frae his foul spurn, On quietly speering lis belief O' Bannockburn. That day ye showed the warl' your mettle, An' a vexed questlon soon did settle; That day proud Edward sorely nettle For mony a day ! And we were left our rights to fettle In our own way. Noo, friend, I find the time is night When I man tao my work must fly; Sao I will ha'e tooe say good-by, And wield the spoon, My love o' ye to verify To a' areon. River Forth, March 8.
