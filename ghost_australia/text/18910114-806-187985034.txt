A GRUESOME RECORD. [?] Davidson, the master of the [?] and orderly for Dr. [?] Yunl, l||j c'Iljj *uh nor il 'I- 1 of 3»>n- rujf ; *>li»c*r.

The, ) aw of averages opUtns further corrobora tion. of it* unfeeling accuracy in the figures "compiled by~ -tfJWTTW'r Utterly,: la 1889 fim rw >*$, inquests, which was jdlgntTy ’c&o;** thff'~lVgragw. Duiing*480Q Hiw'» wBrt 416 inquests, or precisely the same number as in 1888, and this was the normal ratio for the past 30'jVari. So little do the coroners statistics vary, that It can bo safely ’predic|pd tljaia the year qo which ,wq have just emorod D> Yoel will hold, somewhere between 400 and'4&0 enquiries, and in each set of oascsi ! which supply, ,cadsvers for the attention of himself and juries, there will bo a surprising closeness. In 1889 there were 1CG0 inquests for the: whole colony. The statistics for 1890 am not yet available, but without waiting for thOTn Itirill bo quite safe to down at 1700,and at 1700 (pl.t)* an allowance for the increase of population) for the coming twelve months. To the uninitiated it um> appear remarkably strange that tbqm should b©' sbeh monotonous aamehrfcs in this branch of human affairs and actions, but it was bog ago discovered that what men have done or suffered dur ing one given space of time in a past period they will unfailingly do or suffer in a similarly given time in some future period. There is, for ex ample, nothing mom uncertain than the life of one individual, but as the “ ex periences” of fhe life Assurance actuaries have proved over and over again, therd is nothing more certain than the duration of life in a multitude of persons. In the same way it Ja exceedingly improbably that during Jpe .coming 12 months any specified individual will be so unfortu nate as to be the subject of a coronial enquiry, but take iO.OOO or 20.000 persons, and it can, with the data be fjre us, be calculated almost to a unit how many of them will bo interred on a certificate of a coroner. In deed, the law of averages as applied to humanh. inga is equally operative whether cognisance is taken of the most solemn oi the most trivial events. So many persons will die per qr, ten thousand, either naturally or through violence dur ing a stated period i;»o many houses will he burned down ; so many window panes will be broken, aad so many husbands will discover that they have forgotten to execute commissions entrusted to thorn by their wives, and so on, from the most serious things down to the most insignificant. It is only, how cver, in connection with a few of the causes by which humanity is objectively or subjectively acted upon that statistics are obtainable, but we now know an much of the unerring operation of the doctrine j of averages, that given a sufficiently com prehensive data, it would be the easiest thing imaginable to forecast replies to the queries above suggested, and to scores of others whioh it would be tedious to specify. Reverting to the melancholy work per formed last year by the Melbourne City Coroner, we find that of the 416 cases laid before him for Investigation d-ath in noil ess than 188 was directly traceable iq drink. This is on the direct evidence of witnesses, but according to Constable Davidson the alcoholic influence was even stronger in providibg subjects. The con stable verbally supplements his gratis tics with the statement that in 80 per cent, of the cases drink w«s the direct or indirect pause of the sudden or mysterious cutting short of life. Now, leaving out the violent deaths and taking only those oases in which when the deceased person had prior to his demise been regularly attended by a physician, an inquest thus being unneces sary, the deduction is warranted that a very much larger proportion of people die from alcoholism ur aftootiono accelerated by alcoholism than perhaps the most exaggerating temperance lecturer has any conception of. Thus the coroner held inquests last year on live fatql cases of sunstroke—all brought on by unseason able and excessive drinking; pneumonia, consumption and what doctors tern) alcoholism claimed SI victims—31 due to drink; heart disease and aneurism, 39 cases — -2 due to drink • Brights’ disease, 20 cases —18 due to drink: apoplexy and brain diseases, 19- 6 duetb drink. Now, as it is-on the “sub merged tenth ' and the very poorest and most ignorant of the lower classes that in ceneral inquests .-are deemed necessary, whereas these classes have not unfortu nately a monopoly of the alcoholic habit, we leave it to tb« medical profession, to reflecting men and women and to social reformers to draw their own conclusions. It was a proverb with our forefathers that a mild winter made a fat churclir yard. Here, according to Constable Davidson, a fat sqason qf general pros perity makes extra work for the ooroner, and vice veesaj Hh tails us that Dr. Youl was least employed during the recent great strike than at any period of the past year. . One deduction is that there was less money in circulation amongst the classes'which keep tbe-morgue supplied, and therefore, fewer opportunities for ob taining drink. Bat another, and some what more gratifying 'explanation is offered, namely, that as there were fewer men then employed in factories, oh wharves, in tjie streets and elsewhere, there was correspondingly less probability of accidents, The chances are, however, ■that both causes' tended to make the coronial work lighter during the quarter year over which the atrike extended. The figures as a whole are roost gruesome read ing, more especially as there is the absolute certainty of identically the samp story being told for 189|. j fotmm Pao»— The fsIMwtef additions' matter . will be found oo tbe fourth page Mining News pod Kota* The First Quartz Battery at Ballarat, Mnsfoal Entertain ment and Temperance Meeting, BagUkawk, Dr. Koch's Cure for Comumptfor.
