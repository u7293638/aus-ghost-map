MONSTER KLONDIKE NUGGET. Mr. Maitland Kersey, manager of the Klondike Gold Mining Company,has sailed for England on the Lucania, taking with him a gold'nugget worth 50,000dol., to hbe exhibited in one of the branches of the Union Bank of London. The nugget was closely guarded, and was put in a strong box in the treasurer's room of the Lu canla. The Duke bf Alva is interested in the company which owns the nugget. The 10,000dol, church chimes, which were presented to the Holy Ghost Greek orthodox church of Bridge port, Connecticut, by the Czar of Russia shortly after his coro nation, have been attached for 3000dol. by Charles H. 1awley to re cover on a note of 2550dol. Instead of foreclosing, Mr. Hawley, who holds the note of the church trustee, has seized the bells and is preparing to cart them away. The six bells are said to be the handsomest of their kind in the United States, having been cast under direction of the Imperial Court of Rus sia. They are highly ornamented with inscriptions and figures. The Czar's gift has proven a white elephant to the church. The society is now trying to raise the necessary funds to lift the at tachment on the bells. EAT JONES' IX1; JAMS.*
