WEST BOURKE ELECTORATE. MR. HARPER AT KENSINGTON. A meeting of about 150 electors of West Bourke was addressed by Mr Robert Harper at the Clorence Hotel, Kensington, on Satur- day nifeht Mr Archibald Taylor presided Mr HAÜFFU said that at the time of tho West Bourke election, in Tebruary last, he had expressed disapproval of the embassy to England Since then Mr Berry had returned to the colony Had ho brought back what he went home to get' ( ' No, and " Yes ) His object was to tet an enabling act, and ho didn t get it Instead of it he had got a de Bpatch (He proceeded to give the points of the despatcli, but Mr Laurens, M L A , re pcatedly interrupted lum, atatnifc that Mr Harper was misinterpreting the document These interruptions caused some con- fusion, beveral persons present object- ing to Mr Laurens a interference, as ho va" not an elector of the district) 'I he embassy was a total failure (' No,'and ' \ea ) Ho denied that Mr Berry had a rifcht to claim any credit in connexion with the new ocean mail contract or the settle mont about the diviBion of the postage As to the last loan, the Ministerial prcBS went into absurd ecstacies about what Mr Berry had done , and then, when a New South Wales loan was subsequently lloated on better terms, the same papers Bald The Argus was to blame He would explain how it was that the credit of the colony had been destroyed The Al gut bad sent home true and laithful accounts of what the Ministers had said and done The cause of the decline m our credit was the nggreSBive attitude of the Ministry and tho Lower House towards capital and capitalists (Cheers} lo- instance, Mr Longmore lately talked about the Ministry hav ing their j»nds on the throats of the propertied classes It had been hoped that Mr Berry would come buck deBirous to settle the question in a moderate and reasonable manner, but ho had now proposed a measure far more objection able and outrageous than the one he had in troduced before (Cheers and counter cheers ) He condemned those portions of the new scheme relating to money bills, a nominee Upper House, and the plibiscilum As to the latter proposal, he observed that many men hadn t time to read anything else but their newspaper Consequently tho plibisctlum would simply make the proprietor of the newspaper having the largest circulation the dictator of the colony He didn t care what newspaper it was , he objected to the country being ruled by any newspaper proprietor ¡Cheers) When Mr Longmore was pitched into by the Age for throwing open Mount Macedon to selection, he sent an officer of the Lands department to Mr Syme, and Mi byrne recommended that 3,000 acres near hia house should be reserved, and it waa done '1 hat was a pretty state of things The other d ly he waB misreported by the Age to have said that Mr Syme got 300 acre3 for himself He had never said thnt and he had sent a letter to the Aqe correcting the report which letter had not been published It had come to a pretty pass when our government waa carried on in a newspaper office (Cheers ) It was partly bcciuiBe Mr Deakin was the apostle of the pUbisatum that he (Mr Harper) was opposing lum Hie Ministry had shown lamentable incompetence Wrhen Mr Berry assumed office in May, 1877 he had the largest and most pliable majority that any Government ever had in the Assembly W hat use had Mr Berry made of the splendid chance he had had ' He had imposed most pernicious and absurd taxes-for instance, the redgum duty the wattle bark tax ind the stock tat He (Mi Harper) was in favour of a land tax and of a ti.x on all realised wealth, but be objected to Mr Beny s land tax because it was unfair m ita incidence W hy w as not city property taxed ' The Berry land tax had been a failure It had brought in nothing like what had been expected and when an account of the le(,al and other expenses connected with it waa published it would rather astonish some people Hie new tariff imposed fresh taxes 1 he state was in a miserable financial mess W hen Mr Berry took oil ce he had a lary; surplus , now there was alarie deficit Taxation was being m creased at an alarming rato, and on an unBound basis laxca were being steadily heaped on the maäscs, to an extent that would incapacitate them from competing with other countries (Cheers and counter cheers ) Public expon diture was increasing tit an appalling rate and the constitutional reform cry was raised in order to divert public attention from money matters He waa in favour of con etitutional reform, but financial reform and reduction of the public expenditure consti tilted just now a Bull more important ques tion With retard to Black Wednesday there were more people now m the public service than before that date Referring to the laat W cat Bourke election, he said that if he had petitioned the Legislative Aasembly Mr Deakin would have had to i,o out ( No and "Yea ) Mr Deakin had given up w hat ne knew he could not retain In the speech delivered by Mr Deakin m the As sembly, he Bald that it seemed hard that he should haveauun to contesttheseat that it waa a personal misfortune but that should not le id hun to be unjust Yet m a speech delivered by the same genMeman at Bacchus Marsh on March 1, he characterised the action of those who wished to void the election aB being on moral grounds d13 reputable, and he alBo said the action of the Government in that matter was not only legal but just But yet at that very time he must, according to his statement in the HOUSP, have been conversing with Sir Bryan O Loghlen about his resignation Mr Deakin, in the action be had taken Bince Parliament met, was entitled to nothing more than credit for prudence ("No and "Yes ) It waa safer policy to walk out of the door than to be pushed out Mr Deakin waa the Minis tenal champion (A Voice-"And you are chamj ion of the Opposition ) He was (Cheers ) Mr OAKEY asked whether Mr Harper was in favour of givint, capitation grants 01 pay ment by results for education to any deno mination ' Mr HARIER Baid he was glad the question had been asked At the time of the last election be Btated his views pretty fully on the education question He said then that ho desired an amendment of the Education Act 111 various directions, that vs to its ud ministration ho desired decentralisation be cause it waB rapidly becoming a political in stitution (Cheers ) He also objected to it on the score of ita expenaivenesa, and he ob jected to it still more seriously on the ground of what he called its rabid secu lanty At the time referred to he stated his wish was that tho act should L» amended m the duectioii of enabling nil classes of the population to have their children re li(,iously educated (Cheers ) That was his position in Tebruary last, and that was Ins position now He was accused at that time, and had been accused since of having trimmed on this question-of having turned against the 1 ducation Act merely to get the votes of a certain section of the con stituency That statement waa simply untrue (Hear, hear ) His opinions on that subject had been the same for jears As evidence that those were his views before he entered into politics he might mention that at a meeting held in the Assemblj hall, Collins street, in October last he publicly stated his views to be in favour of a change in the education BJ stem, BO as to enable religious instruction to be (,iven in tlie schools With regard to the present state of the case, he held, as a Protestant that every child, whether Protestant 01 Catholic, ought to havo instruction in the fundamental principles of the Christian iuith (A Voice-"So they have ) The present act forbade and prevented that Ho was in favour of trying to cometo some settlement between the Catholics and Protestants, for that was the real difficulty, as the Protestants could agree, and the difference was between the Catholics and Protestants He was de sirous, in order that every child might get the best and h ghost of all education that some settlement should be come to between the Protestants and Roman Catholics With a view to that and aB a sincere and, he hoped, earnest Protestant, be would like to Bee some By stem arrived at by which the Catholics and ProtestantB might meet in the aamo school and have religious instruction at different timcB (Cheers ) That was what would he like, but he was told it was not practicable He didn t know that it was not, and would like to try it But if it was not piacticablo, he was distinctly in favour, instead of de barring our children from having their highest heritage, of tho adoption of tho result Bjstem. or an adaptation of the result system, or the Canadian system, 01 some other system that had worked well else w here, m order that some settlement between thevanouB denominations might be arrived at (Cheers ) But he said that distinctly on the understanding that the Catholics would, if some arrangement was come to, go with others hand in band to enablo them to have the children m their schools taught the fundamental principles of unsectariau Chna tian religion Mr OAKEV -Say yes or no, Mr HAitrEn- I have answered the ques tion It can t be anavvered with a simple yes orno An ELECTOR Btated that at Essendon Mr Harper had said he would not support an educational grant to his own or any other religious denomination Mr HAitriR observed that he was asked at Essendon whether he was in favour of a separate grant to the Catholics ne replied that the Catholics had not asked for a separate grant, but that a proposal of a dif. fercnt character had been mode on their be- half. TIIP same questioner then asked him whether ho was in favour of giving a separate grant to any denomination, to which he (Mr. Harper) replied that he was not in favour o£ giving a separate grant to his own, and there- fore he was not in favour of giving one to anj other denomination (near, hear ) In anBvver to other questions, Mr HAtirtu Baid the new tariff added vastly to the burdens of the working classes and farmers, and he was decidedly opposed to it. Of course ho wou'd object to a large mllui of Chinese , but what was the use of mal'ing a fuss about that race if more of them were leaving our shores than arriving here' lio waa opposed to payment of members An Litcron-A\hat do you think about Mr Woods' conduct at the last election' i Mr líAiirLii replied that, if the horn-..,]«! not so late, he might tell sume curious stonea on that Bubject. One anecdote he would re- late A gentleman in Mr Woods' position, at a certain place not 50 miles from Lance- field, waa accosted bj a man who, a week after the election got a Government billet, and asked whether the Railway department didn't carry cricketing teams fice, or nearly ao "Yea," said Mr. Woods, or the gentle- man m his position 'J hen the individual who waa speaking to lum said, '"liiere are 19 voteB down the line Supposing I get upa hurling team, will jon carry thom to Riddells Creek on the day of election free ' ' Mr. ^\oods, twirling lim ejeglass, aaid, "Happy idea1 (Laughter, and a voice, "It was a joke ' ) What could be thought of a Minister conniving at a fraud on his own department hy making such a rejoinder' (An Elector "Did the) cair) it out ' ) Ho didn't know. In answer to other questions, Mr. IlAiiFLn said lie was in favour of re- forming the Upper nouse by reducing the qualification of its members, the size of the provinces, and the term of office As to re- forming the constitution, lie was prepared to agree to a joint standing order, or possibly to some adaptation of Mr Francia proposal made some time ago He had pledged him- self , vv ith regard to freetrado and protection, not to agree to alter the present BJ stem with- out a preliminar) appeal to the constituen- cies No vote of confidence waa asked for, nor waa any adverse resolution proposed A vote of thanks was passed to the chair- man.
