(By Louise Chandler MoultoiO Though we repent, can any God give back The dear, lost days we might have made so fair — Turn false to true, and carelessness to care. And let us find again what now we lack? Oh, once, once more to tread the old time track, The flowers we threw awav once more to wear — Though we repent, can any God give back The dear, lost days we might have made so fair? Who can repulse a stealthy ghost's at tack- Silence a voice that doth the midnight dare — ? IMake fresh ho-*'- spring from grave-sod of despair— ?Set free a tortured soul from memory's rack * Though we repent, can any God give back The dear, lost days we might have made so fair?
