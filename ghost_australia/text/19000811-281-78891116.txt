PEBF3CT a PB0F3SSICNALS. The Bey. Sheldon's Ne~ Idea in { Ixrs Eev. C. M. Sheldon has be-on 1 telling tho people of Edinburgh that, j in order to apply the teaching of Jesus j Christ to four different kinds of j people, t:3., lawyers, doctors, bus:nes3 1 men, and journalists, ha got Isavo 01 absence from hi 3 church in Topeks, atid lived a week with the lawyers-, another with the doctors, a third with the business men, and edited a news paper for a week. As to the lawyers, his general conclusion was that Christianity did no'; influence their lives at ail, and some of the best lawyers said they did not think msn in their profession could be Christians. He did not belieTe that. He wm disappointed with his week among the doctors. They never talked about | Christ; they became hardened, and 1 talked about the human boiy, " the temple of the Holy Ghost," as if it were a bit of meat. He urged dcctor3 to snnoble their profession. I They should tell patients, and par ticularly young people, of the evils of alcohol on the human body. Not raors than half-a-dozen business men with whom ha talked in his week with them could say that they really tried ?to lire a Christian life in business. They said it was not possible. He did not believe that, though it might mean loss of money. HÎ² bated the word "success" when applied to the success of some business men. Succe2sful thieves he called them. In America men who had pews in church and helped to pay ths pastor's salary sosnbined to " corner " the necessities of life. Dealing with journalism, Hr Sheldon denied that 1113 essay ac editor of a daily was a failure. His editing was meant as an object- lesson, not as an experiment. He had received thousands ct letters promis ing support to a real Chr-ahan. daily if ho would only start one. One day he got 953 letters.
