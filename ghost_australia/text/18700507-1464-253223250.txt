To AtXra of the " Herald" of last Monday. Thou wert gone to the dogs, and we did not restore thee, By turning 'gainst Cowper and Robertson round, So thou pinnest the rag of thy grievance before thee, And makest thy fierce hurdy-gurdy to sound. Thou 'rt a worthy old gent, but yet not such a treasure, That to thee we must sacrifice 'irutn ana a air n ay ; And by no means it follows that every measure Is right if it helps thee again to thy pay. The New Members. Oh, if I wrote like thee, and made thy prose My great example, I would hide my nose ; But if I strove to emulate thy verse, My friends would swear I'd gone from bad to worse ; Though weak not clear, though angry yet not strong, When funny, dismal ; when dogmatic, wrong. Charles Cowper. What means she-cane, I neither know nor heed, But tough he-cane is just the thing you need. Jack Robertson. Ferocious patriot, all you mind is self, Embroidered breeches and official pelf ; Unhappy Delta, why yourself defame By choosing such a true but hapless name ; Self-d d as slime wherein are gendered all The loathsome worms that into sunlight crawl. W. F. When you invoke old Billy Wentworth's shade, It seems as though of him a ghost you made ; But Wentworth still is living, and who knows But he mav come to null Scrutator's nose. John Sutherland. When you praise us and slander Charley C. , We wishes he was us and we was he. De Salis, Mate, Tiglie. Them's my sentiments ! Dan. Egan. As when a horse- leech from the skin is plucked, Where long its parasitic food it sucked, The writhing reptile in its eyeless spite Gropes for some tender surface where to bite, The wary traveller baffles its intent, And yet a chill through every nerve is sent ; So though we safely scorn old Delta's sting, Our senses shudder at the nasty thing. Edward Butler.
