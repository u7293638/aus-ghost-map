THEATRE GONG IS 'KIOTO . JAPAN. We set out on our first visit to a Japanese theatre, not exactly knowing whether we should be moved, by what we saw therein, to laughter or to tears, or whether either ought to come in the programme We had at least a feeling in common, that of delightful uncertainty It gave one a sense of security to feel one's companions could have no superiority over one on this point We met at the door of our hotel, and, everyone being afraid of his neighbours asking him an awkward question, all were seated in the jinrickishas in an incredibly short time I remember its coming to me as a kind of revelation after the difficulty we generally had in recognising our coolies, each one seizing somebody else's 'ricksha, and a great amount of talking before all were settled comfortably This morning, however, saw us, in less time than it takes to write, trundling down the street, dragged by our willing " karuma " men, all laughing gaily and evidently cracking the greatest jokes We felt the business on hand too serious for any such love., and at the end of our five minutes' ride descended from our carriages and followed our guide solemnly up the dirtiest flight of star it had over been my lot to me ant The little man, with a beaming face, marshalled us into our " but "-a post about 4ft square, I may remark, en patsttnt-aad a smiling " mouse " carne bowing to know whether we would have cushions or stools women to sit Scornfully wo waved aside the stools and spread the cushions, declaring we would do it in true Japanese fashion or not at all Only one dissentient voice was heard that of a man, of courier ayr if he thought a stool would be more comfortable But he was promptly crushed We had only time to get a general view of a large hall, with a confused vision of people below us having their meals, when we found the curtain had disappeared and the play was in full swing Gorgeous was the scene before us ! The am poor s courtiers were seated in robes of State discussing documents brought by messengers from a neighbouring Kingdom-grave, dignified men, in the sides of most lovely hues, some a mass of gold, others plain in their simple richness, each and all wearing swords in beautiful scabbards and of the finest workmanship Enter the Emperor in a most uproarious state, having taken too much sake Great confusion ensues, and in the midst of it the scene is changed by the whole stage revolting The Empress IS discovered in trailing robes of scarlet, and long black hair falling down her back. She is apparently engaged in painting a picture, and all the tv hill bemoaning her sad fate in having a husband addicted to drinking late The door is slid back, and the Emperor appears, having come from the Council Chamber A long room, ersat on takes place, and finally the Empress rises to sweep from the room. The E never, however, detain her by keep ng firm hold of her skirts with his his word After some vain struggles to get free, she takes refuge behind a screen, which she plies between herself and him More warfare of words, and-thrilling moment she "makes suicide," our guide tells us " How does she make it, in a gentle murmur from the back- ground This is too much for us all, and we forfeit our reputations for ever in our guide's opinion by giving way to untimely merriment And it is some time before his ru'Scl feelings can be soothed and he will explain the " makes suicide " by cutting her throat For fully five minutes after the ex ent she talks on, the orchestra " playing soft music," and, just as onoVattention is wandering?, gives up the ghost The next scene shows the Council chamber again, Twth the Emperor solemnly apologising for his recent misbehaviour and promising amendment for the Future One of the courtiers comes in bringing the Empress's boat tied up in a handkerchief, and presents it to th J Emperor He relates the sad story of her in timely end We notice he does not seem much overcome by it, and the curtain is drawn across the stage by means of a coolie taking hold of it and running along the stage, dragging it after him We turn our attention to the busy scenes below, glad to have a few minutes' rest from shower lasting twanging of the samisen and the | monotonous drone accompanying it. Most of the little pens were filled to at of rowing not only with people, but with their refreshments also All lands of good things brought in on red lacquer ] stand out shelf above another , the lowest and highest salad with rice the next perhaps with fish, the nLXt with c dies, and the top with sweetmeats of the most brilliant colony bright yellow, emerald green, sun lot, see the family congregations mile and ply their chopsticks in the common bowl, and a mons mu trips along on her bare foot bringing hot mile in a dainty blue and white china Wo recognise some old friends, the " geisha," who danced so prettily the night before They look up smiling and bow ing until their numerous hair ornaments quiver again We hardly have time to return their saluted one, when the curtain again r st, or rather is drawn, on a new play, in which Japan's most " lobban" (No 1, ax 1) actor, all the way from TOKIO, IS to appear This time the landscape is wrapped in snow a pretty red lacquer temple in the foreground Mon in black garments and pointed taps flit about altering here and there a stool, so We ask our guide who are these mysterious apparitions ? ' He answers that they are the sconesluftors, and the black sole iks are supposed to render them in visit to " Are the actors not going to appear ? " " Why, yes Here they Come " And turning we see them slowly stopping up an mained piano which somehow lea is through the audience Tnosoarotho Tj coon's brother, with his faithful in minors, disguised as farmers in straw raincoats and basket hits covered with snowflakes Solo only they come along, lifting each foot on a level with their knee, and giving a little final kick before putting it down again, which is very funny Still in silence they divest them selves of raincoats and hats, and appear in shining apparel, finally changing round their straw sandals in order to make the enemy believe they came the reverse way A case calculated only to deceit of a Japanese Then all being seated the Tycoon's brother speaks of how hating i " lived in concord " with his brother for many years, they have quarrelled and are now at war ' fan " He has been forced to fight and to fly in consequence of having been defeated Horrible dilemma How is he to escape? His followers counsel him to disguise himself as a priest Here enter three soldiers, the " Coliban " actor leading He declares he will die for his master, and after a most affecting scene they change swords, and the Tj coon's brother and his followers except in a state of profound emotion It is irresistibly comic, and we are obliged to bury our faces in our handkerchiefs, to prevent our tears from flowing too, of course The faithful servant tries in vain to dismiss his servants " No can , everyone going to do with everyone " Finally they retire into the temple to await hostilities f 16th the enemy Up the inclined plane comes the comic actor with a colossal broad knife by way of a weapon, his walk, gestures, and grimaces all stamping him the funny man of the play Behind them come hordes of the enemy They discover the to reports of the young prince's party, and institute a search in the neighbouring wood While they are thus engaged, the prince's party issue from the temple, and a great fight takes place, in which they come off victorious Taon the comic actor, with his broad knife, fights a duel with the faithful servant, who conquers, and " bread-knife " expires in the funniest dying agonies, in fact keeps up his character to the last (Curtain ) We had a hearty laugh over the fighting, it was even worse than what one sees on our stage, and that be saying a good deal ' We took one linger- ing look at the pretty scene and the contact with the names of " chilian " actors in In age characters on it, and went out into the sunlight, through the merry- making, laughing crowd, which sent us on our way with many a gay " Ohyo Good day I.
