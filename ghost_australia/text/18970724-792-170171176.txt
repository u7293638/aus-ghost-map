THE BLESSING OF THE ROSSES. From the Gaelic of St. Columba. I. O, Rosses, ever dear to me, May Mary, Queen of Heaven, I pray, And hosts of holy angels, be Your glorious guardians, night and day. II. May countless favours from above Make rich your plains, your glens, your coast; May you have blessings, mercies, love, From Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. III. Blest be your sons ; may they abound In faith, good works, and every graceâ€” An honour to your famous ground, A glory to their noble race. IV. Blest be your chiefs and warriors all, Bright be their blades with victory's light When, answering to their country's call, They bravely battle for the right y. Blest be the tillers of your soil; Blest be the men who guard and keep Your flocksand herds, and those whose toil Wins treasure from the stormy deep. VI. May sun and dew and wind and rain Make fat your fields and great your store; And hill and vale and spacious plain Grow fair and fertile more and more. I VII. | May lake and river, creek and bay, And each bright stream that wanders through Tour winding vaJes, I fondly pray, Be stores of living wealth for you. vni. 0, Rosses, land of high renown, Of women fair and stalwart men, Such blessings bright may God send down On you and yours. Amen ! Amen ! T. D. S.
