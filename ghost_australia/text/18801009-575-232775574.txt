WOOD'S BBAKB.—One of the coupling pipes belonging to this ingenious oontrivsnce burst just as the midday train was entering the Kyneton station on Thursday last. Passengers who happened to be lookinjg out of tbe windows at th'e time received ratter an unpleaunt baptism. A new coupling was attached as speedily as powible, and the train again sent on its way. Misfortune followed it, however, as another coupling broke as soon as the pressure wis put on in order to pull the train up at the Woodend station, and here the drenching operation was repeated- The contrivance ought to be accompanied witi a notice to passengers to keep the windowi shut while it is ia operation.

COMMERCIAL FOOTBAXLCLTTB.—The memberp of this olub wound up the season with dinner and entertainment in the Temperance Ha.ll, on Wednesday last. About thirty perecme sat down to dinner, which wa& provided by Miss Page in a manner that cave every satiflfafeHon. After dinner the following programmfe was gone through in the presence of a Tiutu«rous andience, who; $udginc by the continuous lauebter that was evoked, heartily enjoyed themselves. Thfirst part con sifted of an Ethiopian circle with the following cast:—A. Coles, centre-man: "V. P. Hobbf, bones; T. Elliott, tambourine; G. White, violin; C. S. Ginn, banjo. We need not say that such a combination of artists succeeded in producing some roost remarkable strains. The next part consisted of sons* as follows, and the effect of 6ome <* them wa* heightened by the fact that it tras found difficult to remove the black from the faces and hands of those who had taken part in the necro business. They, however, compromised the matter by appearing as halfcastes:—Song, 11 The bloatod youna* aristoerat," C. S. Ginn, encored; recitation, 41 Fifteen cents off" A. Cole®: sons. " Clementina Johnson," T. Elliott; violin «oln and chorus, G. White; recitation. " Yorkshire Humphrey," J. F. Man son: pong, " The warrior bold," W. Tule. Tho latter song wa« extrcmrly well rendered, and an ercore being demanded, "The Midshipmite** was jrfven. The next was a comic impersonation, entitled " The Travelling Minstrels." by Messrs. White. Elliott, and Hobhs. This aeain was very much enjoyed, pnrtirulary as the latter performer, who took the part of a ghost, had to appeal as a " piebald,"' his face being appropriately masked, but his hands still bearing traces of recent nigger Exploits. A song:,' ** "Uncle** Christmas Party" followed, by Mr. J. S. Manson, and the entertainment concluded with the amusinjr farce "Cherry Bounce," which sent the audience away in hiirh good humour shortly after ten o'clock.
