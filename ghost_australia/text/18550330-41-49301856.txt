PIERS FOR BRIDGE. TO THE EDITOP. OP THE REGISTER. Sir — Your correspondent 'L. A.' recom mends, as ' a thought of his own,' the adoption of the form of the Eddystone Lighthouse as that best adapted for the piers of a bridee in the Torrens, referring to me, at the same time, in a complimentary manner. Now, although I am glntl to find the Eddystone Lighthouse to be still standing and approved, I beg to call ' L. A's ' attention to the fact that £ have also built bridges myself, and never with cir cular piers. The thought is his own, and de serves his signature — ' La !' The width of a bridge being, say 30 feet, the piers would, on his plan, be 30 feet in diameter at least, and two towers of 30 feet, diameter built in a river would lamentably abridge the water-way in the time of flood, and turn the stream upon the banks. The old notion of a pier, on which I have often acted, is to present as little resistance as pos sible to the passage of the stream ; and uules3 things are altered at the antipodes, and you there find the washing tub the best form for fast sailing, I cannot but think that tho principle still holds good. You must have very queer engineers indeed on your side of the world at present, if such a correspondent as 'La!' can mend them. But he seem3 to be pursuing engineering kiaowled ge' under difficulties ;' and with best wishes that he may ultimately attain it, and meanwhile be a little modest in urging his suggestions, while they have so very little to recommend them, I am, Sir, &c;, SMEATON'S GHOST.
