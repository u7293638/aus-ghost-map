A GOOD TEST. A well-known solicitor, of subscriptions to charities called at the house of a gentleman more noted for withholding than for giving. The time was late in the evening, and it was very desirable that the visitor should remain at the house for the night. But to his surprise was courteously informed that the house was full, with the exception of a haunted chamber. The gentleman said that, not wishing to offer that to a guest, he was compelled to decline entertaining him for the night, and imagined that in this way he had effectually disposed of his mission. But he was mistaken. The visitor very promptly assured him ihat he would cheerfully accept the hospitality of the haunted chamber for the night, and was therefore assigned to it. Of course he slept comfortably and saw no ghost. But at breakfast the next morning, being questioned by his host as to the experience of the night, he cleverly humoured the ghostly whim by assuring his host and fellow-guests that he had indeed seen a vision—had without doubt been visited by a veritable ghost. As he lay upon his back in bed, meditating upon his work, he was startled by the accustomed apparition. But not in the least disconcerted, he calmly extended his •collection-book toward the spectre, who, or which, instantly vanished. And thus, or similarly, it is often found that much of the boldest and noisiest piety vanishes on the presentation of the collection-book. The first time I read an excellent book, it is to me just as if I had gained a new friend: when I read over a book I liave perused before, it re- sembles the meeting with an old one.— Gold- smith*
