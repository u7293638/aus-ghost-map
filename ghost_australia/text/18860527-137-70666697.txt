Ballad of Christmas Ghosts. Between the moonlight and the fire, In winter eveniasg long ago, What ghoEta I raied at your desleO To make your leaping blood ran Elow I How old, how grave, how wise we grow I What Ch-iE.isn ghost can mske ua chill, Sa?e these that troop in mournifl row, The ghosts we all can rae at will? The boasts can talk in barn and byre On Christmas reve,'~d legends know, As one by one the years retire, We men fall silent then, I trow, Such sights has memory to Ehow, Sch voices from the distant thrill, Ah. mel they come with Christmas enow, The ghosts we all can raiee at will. Oh I children of the village choir I! Your carols on the widnight throw I Oh, bright acroes the mit'and mire, Ye ruddy hearths of Christmas glow l Beat berk the shades, beat down the woe, Renew the strength of moral will; Be welcome all to come or go, The ghos.s we all can raise at will. Priend, sursu, cordo, oon or nlow We part like guests who've joyed their fill; Forget them not, nor mourn them so, The ghmaN we all can raise at willi \--Andrew Lang,
