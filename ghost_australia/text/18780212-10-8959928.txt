TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY. SIR, Assuming the acceptance of the proposition that it is the province of the newspaper press to encourage the free discussion of every class of subjects affecting the well being of mankind, subject to editorial discretion, and, moreover, that there exists no other medium of equal efficacy for reaching the public mind and thought, I desire to avail myself of the proved liberality of The Mercury in placing its columns at the disposal of the public for the benefit of the public interests, for instituting inquiries as to certain systems of teaching in which the whole human family is deeply concerned, and promising what follows by remarking that the investigation involves no reflection on the individual personal excellence of those who see fit to yield their adhe- sion to the systems reflected on Allow me to inquire whether on this sin stricken earth there is an institution the Scriptural authority for whose pretensions more urgently calls for searching scrutiny than assumed human priesthood, whether Greek, Roman, or Anglican , whether Christ, with His perfect acquaintance with human fallibility, His perfect love of humanity in its every condition, could, by possibility, have inflicted so dire an affliction on humanity as priestcraft, with its arrogance of superiority, its tyranny, its shedding of the best blood-blood yet to be avenged-that ever flowed in human veins, for no other cause than loyalty to the Master even unto death, has proved itself to he Whether, in the profoundness of his wisdom, he could possibly have committed to fallen man an office, the obligations of which none but a divinity could discharge, and which, accordingly, he has taken on himself, being our Great High Priest before the throne on high v Whether it is possible for him to have committed to one poor sinner among the test of us, to dictate the religious faith of the myriads of his fellows' We hear much of the senseless credulity of mankind, but this bowing of the knee to a fellow sinner, because he has the audacity to demand it, beats all When our Saviour was about to depart from this earth, for the comforting of the hearts of his dis- ciples, he said, " I will send the comforter to you, which 18 the Holy Ghost, he will lead you into all truth " The alternative, therefore, we have before us is, the Holy One in our midst, commissioned by Christ, or the poor sinner like unto ourselves who claims to be Christ's vicar, on no better warrant than that of his fellows. Let us not make a fool's choice " Chambers's Etymological Dictionary" defines priestcraft as " the craft or schemes of priests to gain wealth 01 power History amply verified tim definition I desire to be understood in what I have written as rather recording a protest than offering a I challenge. Yours, etc., STEPHEN OWEN.
