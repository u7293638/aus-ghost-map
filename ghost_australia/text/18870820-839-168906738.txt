MEETING NIGHT. The German proEcssor, when ho had fin ished our lesson, nnd was waiting for tho thunder shower to pass— for, though he hnd brought his -big blue umbrella, ho did not cai o to face the flashes of lightning— suddenly turned to us, nnd said : 'It wns exactly sucli an evening as this I saw Leopold—' Wo looked up at him and waited. Wo knew ho wns about to tell us a story ; he al ways bognn in this way, without preface, ' In my native village,' he said, ' people bclicvo that whoever will go alono to the cathedral on a certain midnight in summer, which we call ' Mooting Night,' and with his own blood, and a quill from a bird's wing, write the name of adeail friend in tho form of a cross at tho foot of tho altar, may sec that friond and1 speak to him. People be lieve this, but vory few ever try. the spell, When it cornea to' tho point, ghosts scarcely pruvo satisfactory; ,and writing in one's own jlood is iraHier a solomn proceedliig,especially in an empty church at midnigbt. ' Ono man who hnd lost bis sweetheart did it. They said ho saw her, but lie bled to death from the wound he gave himself to got tho blood, having accidentally severed an artery. ' When I loft the town, tbe custom wns spoken of as amongst the things, of tho past. 1 left in haste. I hadhad a quarrel with my cousin Luopokl. ' Tlio quarrel was about n lady I loved, Frit/. Wagner told me some thing that made me furious and I challenged Leopold on the spot. Wo met in tho great open clearing in tho heart oE the pine woods oEtcn used before for tho samo purpose. It wns dawn— tbo pink dawn o£ summer. I can soe him now, stand ing, handsomo and tall, in ttio sweet light, his coat off, his sword in liis hand. Ho looked at me reproachfully, but not angrily. I was furious. Tho word wns given, I did my best to wound him. Ho merely defended himself. Then lie lay on the ground at my feet, and my second hurried mo away, put on my coat, and dragged mo to. where a car riage awaited ino. ' ' Uo !' he said, ' Tho quicker the bottcrl You havo killed your cousin Leopold. This plnce will not bo safe Eor you. ' Tho coaohman drovo furiously, Aa for me, I was in a sort of dream. ' Had I Uillejl Leopold whom I loved so?1 1 asked mysclE. Then I replied : ' Ho desorvert it. Ho de served it. I diet well.' ' Tho next day I loft Germany. I oame to Australia. I established myself here. Ono day, in the mid$t of the great throng in Col lins Street, I mot Fritz Wngnor. He lookod like a ghost— gray, hollow-cliccked— scarcely moro than a skeloton. ' ' You sec it,' ho said, as I glanced at him; '1 am dying. This Is my address. Do not corao until I send for yon ; but when I do, como at onco, Swear it.' ' ' My fiirtnd,'«f said, Met mo noinc before thnr, Lot mo holp you it I can.' 11 ' No,' ho said, ' no ; ' and turned away, ?-- ^?T!ireu...iiuintlia,nftcnMii h a m es ntjer ; ' 4 \l, cnino to mo at rniclnij.'lit, iml s m 1 * * ** '*?*?
