SEMAPHORE. The crowds taken to the Semaphore by train were supplemented by vehicles of all descript- tions filled with excursionists. The tide being suitable the juveniles were soon sporting in the briny, and the elders set up camps on shore. The steam-cutters had a lively time in making short trips, but there was a manifest want of music. The rotunda was like a ghost as a banquet. Another lamentable want is proper accommodation in drinking fountains. The day proved a most enjoyable one, the light sea breeze keeping the place beautifully cool, and the enjoyment was unmarred by any accident.
