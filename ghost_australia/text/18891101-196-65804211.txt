HE RODE TO WIN. I did not know you had so much poetry in your composition,' observed MIrs. Anstruther languidly. Leila Marsdcen arranged theu delicate laco at her wrist with an air of abstraction. ' Ho is very goodood-looking and he rides splendidly,' she aid, *and ho-or--lho aoes love me to distrac tion, you know.' ' As many others probably will do before your time is over, msy dear; but that has nothing to do with the case. You must got married, and Temple is just the man for you. As for the other one, he'll got over it in time ; they always do. You ars surely nsot going to trouble your silly little Ihead about him?' Miss Marsden rose and walked across the room to the verandah. ' I'll think about it,' she said, half turning in tle doorway to glasses back at her sister.. ' 'll think aboutit, and I'll make up my mind this evening. There ! I can't promise more than that, can I, Ros Y? You are satislied, aren't you r' ' Yea, I am satistled,' replied Mrs. Anstru ther; tuod, as siteo dozed through the long aftcer noon that followed, she allowed her sister to fiure very prominently in her dreamsns as the wife of Major Temple Arburton, of the - l.usoars, ansd future baronet. Sieirabad is famous for its pretty girls; but prettiest ando most striking of all was Leila atarsden at the mraco ball that mught. ' Race ball' is, perhaps, too big i? torm to be Iroperly appliedlt o it; bt tihe arrival of ca couple of regimeuts on their way to the frontier had stirred up Sizirabad to sports on three days of the week, the race ball intervening. 'You'll comeo down to see the finish to morrow, Miss Marsdone?' asked Tommy Campbell the wit of Sizlrabad, as he strolled up to Leial that evening and ashed her for a dance. ' There's the cup race comingoffi, you know, and the ladies' handicap, and the raco Willoughby rides to win--the o n wil the lady as prize.' ' What do you mean ?' asked Laila, lauSgh lag. inHo means the ladies' prizeo r?ce,' eai i Major Arburton, standing close behind her, acnt glowering at Campbell over isershoulder. 'AAni is Mr. Willoughby quito likely to winit ?' asked Leila, sonaowhat indifferently. ' The botting is all on him; but Ihs's got a ticklish mount, and I don't like that left-land corner of the course. With a pulling horse and a vicious brute into the bargainsi, you stand a rare chanc of Jumping the hedge acnd dis. aplpearing down the preciplice.

And he disappearJed among thie dacsers with s conmical look on Ihis face, whlile Lcila laughed forcedly and turned to her partner. ' How odd he is I' she said. ' By the way, what horse is Mr. Willoeughby going to ride to. morrow in the ladies' rnace ' ' One of mcine--Mazzeipa. You seem to tare a great interest in that fellow Willougby' tjealously). ' ot at all. He is rather a friend of my sis tocss,' replied Leila carelessly. 'Aro not you goifg to ride ic this intereosting race, Major Ar. burton ?'

Alnd what is more, he doesn't mean it seriously with you. If you throw over Major' Arburton now you will be throwing him over for a more shaldow. Everybody knows what a flirt Charlie Willoughby is.

You seem to forget that lhavochildreu of my own to be brought up. I counted on your tuarryin g as sooeen as possible. I did not couot on your tlirowing up a reason. able chance.' It was cruel, but it had its effect. Leila turned very white, then she moved to the door. ' I will go with you,' she said, scarcely above a whisper. The ladies' prize race was the next on the programme. Considerable excitement pre vuiled aimong the fair sex as to who would win it. Leila aloneo at calm and unmoved among the spectators. She did not seem to hear or seeo anything, till suddenly there was a little stir and bustle, and murmurs of ' Of course heo'll win.' ' Ho's suro of the race,' ' I feel inclined to congratulate you' already, Mr. Willoughby, you Ioolc so like winning,' etc. The iero of the race took little notice of such like remarks. Iie made his way to Leila and bent low overher. ' Which is it to bo?' he asked. For an instant earth and sky reeled round her, then her brain cleared, and she saw his face. resoluto lhandsome, desperate. She hesitated for one instant, then sle spoke : ' Ride to win.' The words were so low he could scarcely hear them, but when he turned away there was a snmile in 's e;ees. The horses and their riders were drawn up in a line. Leila strained her eyes to watch every movement of black anud white, Mr. Willoughby's co:ours. ?nazeppa lidgeted and caught at tl.o bit. There was some little delay, then the ilag ewse dropped; they were off. At first lreathless silence, then growing excitcment. The course was a small one, uni the race was to be run twice round.
