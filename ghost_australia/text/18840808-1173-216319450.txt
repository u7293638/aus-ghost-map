Confiteor. A MOMENT may oome to a man, and save Eternally; A green yew-tree and a little grave, And a memory. Heart throbbing quick, as the swift days sweep Past like a ghost, Long days, sad days, since you fell asleep, Little one lost. Can you hear me, little one, sleeping fast Under the yew ? I have missed you since the Death-Angel past Betwixt us two. Years since, I carried you robed in White, In sad spring hour, And hid you here from the warm sunlight— Poor little flower 1 I may not roll back the sealing-stone, And see you, dear, But let me whisper you here alone— No one can hear. Why did you leave me ? I needed aid, Aid of child-grace, For the evil things would havebaen afraid Of your sweet face. For a whole life's wrong I would make redress For your loved sake, I have Binned a sin;—let heart confess, Or heart will break. I kneel by the dead child's grave, and vow A sacred word; And through the silence that falls, I know My vow is heard. Frere Sauvage. AN American paper calls attention to a theory of life which, it asserts, was held by the great Faraday. ThiB theory makes the duration of life depend upon the time occu pied in growth, leaving all questions of disease or accident which may shorten life out of the question altogether. Man ocoupies twenty years in the business of growing. This number multiplied by five will give the age to whioh he ought, under favorable circumstances, io live—namely, one hundred years. A camel, occupying eight years in growing, ought to live by the same role forty years; and so on with other animals. Human life he divided into two periods—growth and decline, and these were subdivided into infancy, lasting from birth to the age of twenty; youth, lasting from twenty to fifty; virility, from fifty to seventy-five; after which comes age.
