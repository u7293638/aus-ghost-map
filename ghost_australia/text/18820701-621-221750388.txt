Add hereto that Lily was dzsfisoefn% pretty, and it will be seen that rise prospect before her was fax from cheering. Strange to say, even the gentlemen were not favotzrably disposed to oar heroine, fox most of them were either married, or ought to have been married, to ladies of the company, and were therefore scarcely less annoyed as her advent. Bat Boggles knew all this right well, and before Lily's arrival he had spoken his mind on the ssbject pretty freely, declaring that any attempt to queer T the novice wooli be met by immediate dssansgaL He also advised Lily, privately, whilst the prompter was distributing parts, to' tell her tale to the ladies, and strive to enlist their sympathies. Actresses, my (tear, he said, are jealous, envious, even at times vindictive : but they are romantic, generocs, and good-hearted. Too tell 'em your story, and, my word for it, some of 'em will be on your side in future ; anyway, yon can bet 111 make it lively for those who annoy yon.' Pursuant to this advice, ha the eonrse of the morning Lily opened her heart to two or three of the ladies, and was pleased to see, from their altered manner, that tbe manager had not been wrong in his estimate of their good nature. She found, too, that the gentle men gianeed at her now and then with no unfriendly eyes, and, altogether. &s; she icid | the doctor, she was pleased with her recep- i f tion. i | A far more trying ordeal awaited her on j ' her first appearance before the puoiic ; bat j | she came through it triumphantly, and Boggles was so delighted with her success . ; that, he shook hands with her at least ; sixteen rimes inths coarse of the evening, and : would doubtless have kissed her. had there - | nm been something in Lily's manner which j ; warned him she would resent any astesssts j i at undue familiarity, not to mention the f"i j i that Mrs. Boggles, the black-eyed soabrette ! of the company — known to the public as Migg j Ssilie Despard — kept a very close watch upon 1 him all the rime, and would infallibly have ' made it warm for him bad he so misbehaved himself. jC:i?ixa HL — A Peoposau of Mabstags asb . rrs CoseBQuxscss.
