MEETING AT BALMAIN. ON Sanitary evening, Mr Donaldson and the" electors of the Hamlets resident at Balmain at the Burnbank Hotel, in that locality. The meeting it is numerously attend" 1 ant was adjourned to the open air, in consequence of the largest room in the inn being inadequate to contain those present The proceedings were orderly, although marked by considerable enthusiasm Captain last NTiiri was voted into the club, "and, in opening the proceedings, expressed a hope that each speaker, it mattered not which side li" took, would receive a fair hearing at the close of the proceedings the can induce would arise on such questions as might be put to him. Mr. Do\»in-io\, who was received with three cheers, then proceeded to address the meeting He said that this was the fifth time he had addressed the electors of the Hamlets, md he requests that his friends as well as those who might be opposed to him would refrain as much as possible from giving his lungs unnecessary labour by interrupting him He came there that e owing to c explain his views at a time when his views and opinions were of the greatest importance to the entire colony (Cheers) His canvass in the Hamlets he regarded as like the cooing of a hovel The more the level avoided the one nom ed suited, the more she became a pi ice w o th liar mg and so it was an electioneering contests (Cheers) Now the Hamlets were a constituency which was not easily won, because it required a man of some energy of some eloquence, of some ability in fact, a man of some bottom-to convince five distinct Hamlets each having separate interests, and each operated upon by a variety of conflicting influences Dies the candidate to whom they would listen or who would win then favour, must be a large married man (Cheers ) The Hamlets were in fact, a sent of God in among the col- stituencies of the colony they were a level not easily won, and that was the reason why he sued for their favour (Loud cheers) He (Ali Dpinllson) had sat in the life Council during six sessions member for Durham When he lecturette the colony after his visit to England, a year or two since, he was elected for the Hamlets and at the recent general election he was a second time returned by the same constituency and now for the third time he presented himself before them (V Port " And we will accept jun and cheers ) If the accepted him then he would feel that they had placed him in the highest position he over occupied, because then they would elect him, after he had been selected by the Governor to be the first Prime Minister of New South Wales He appeared before them on the present occasion to solicit the suffrages, not because it was the end of the session-not because he had lost the confidence of his constituents but because the spirit of the Constitution under which they now lived was such that he could only hold the office to which he had been appointed by the sanction of the people and when that was obtained, he could only hold it then by having the support of a minority in the Legislate of Assembly (Cheers) He was desirous of disabusing the minds of those who might vainly lmigmethat those who now governed were a nominee power He who holds the rents of gov ci intent now holds then because he has been in the first place, elected by the people the second place, because the Assembly gives him a majority and in the third place because return ing to his constituency, he has been re-elected by them That was what was called responsible govern- intent (Renewed cheers) Tinalh, the government in this colony was exercised solely by the viceroy of the Sovereign finis, if the most eminent for the time being put a proclamation in the G vrrn'ient battle declaring that all lands this side of the Hawkesbury should be sold at ten shillings an acre that was a law, if he issued a notice declaring that no man should pass over the Blue Mountains without a pass that was law Every thing in the shape of government they merged in the proclamation of the A ice-cream In the next place, a Council composed for the most part of military j men was no rain used to advise the Governor then followed a Council partly elected and partly nominate I, to ve horn who is entrusted the duty of making laws, subject to the approval of the Home Government The next step in advance was the Constitution of 1856, by which a peaceful revolution was effected, and now the only Government the country can have is an Executive Council, composed of men elected by the people, appointed by the Governor, approved of by the Legislative Assembly, and finally returned to the people, whose will virtually forms the governing power, for election by them That was the position which he (Mr Donaldson) now occupied (Cheers ) Since he had accepted office, the pen and tongue of dear action had no doubt been aimed at him, as well as at his colleagues, but as the brazen shield threw back the arrows directed against it, his breast hurled back the arrow s of detraction, as a breast v aid of offence (Loud cheers ) One thing amid the storm of opposition and calumny buoyed him up , it was the consciousness that in the position he occupied he was capable of doing some" little good for this country, and that he had the wish to do her great good (Renewed cheers) He admitted what was charged against him when it was said that he was ambitious, but his ambition was the ambition which influenced Michael Milligan when he received his death wound in rushing up the battlements of the Sedan (cheers) the ambition which induced his ev ornamented friend Colonel Shadforth to sacrifice lies valuable his in a ditch before Sebastopol-(cheers)-the ambition which caused a brother in-law of his (Mr. Donaldson a) at the present time, if he too had not ere this sacrificed his life, to stand at the head of his regiment in the field of battle, with his wounded arm in a sling (Renewed cheers ). He might be defeated in the present contest he might, if the occasion one e, be laid dead on the turf beneath his feet, but no consideration would deter him from pursuing that course which he believed to be the path of duty (Continued applause ) He had repeatedly been asked by constituents w b lie made so many speeches when one would answer all purposes To this his answer uniformly was, that he had five families to look after in the electors of the five Hamlets, and he felt it to be only his duty to devote a. proper share of attention to each (Cheers and laughter ) His object in holding so many meetings was to give the electors the fullest opportunity of asking questions, and of becoming thoroughly acquainted with his views and if they looked at the document which he held in his hand (the Viceregal Speech), which contained an enunciation of the policy of the Government, they would find that it referred to matters in reference to which he might occupy them during the entire night (Heat, and cheers ) He had been told among other things that he was shown , if he were, his show mess arose solely, from a desire to do good, and from a consciousness that he was public property (Cheers ) Since he had been elected by the Hamlets, and since he held office under responsible Government, he knew that he did no thing he might be ashamed of, this a few weeks would show whether he retained office or not, but he entertained a hope that he would not be compelled to stop in the work which he had commenced, but that he would be enabled to continue carry me out the places tical beneficial labours on which he had entered (Cheers ) With regard to the land question, in reference to which he had been grossly misrepresented or greatly misunderstood, he would take occasion to say a few words His theory on this intention was simply this that he would like to see ever possible facility placed before the poor man for obtaining small farms When he was asked for his mo ius in quo for the manner in which he would attain this result he said that he would in the first place, in order to comply with the-law, put the public lands intended for immediate sale up to public auction but in such large quantities that none could possibly have with the levy to selling it farmyards in small lots, at the upset price It was said that this plan would be giving opportunities to large capitalists, but the reverse was the fact, because he would, have the had offered for public sale in such of ire- quantities the no case I must could mo 10 point (C seems ) His plan was at once the safest and best for it would be of to the age, of the law over the small purchaser t it' not violating the" law (Hear hear The rep" ited that he would not, it He continued teacup, his present position leave the land which the small sanded vi ought require to be competed for by auction Of the unjust operation of the present sy s ten, every day furnished proof He had recently he comes acquainted with an instance wherein a man bought land on the At anning River at £1 in ano, and rest and it to small settlers at £12 The reason of this was that the land originally was not sufficiently described Now he would have the land intended for sale so fully described that he who ran might lead (<" hows ) He would Lithograph plans of a 1 rigor description indicating ill the lee limits in the district in which land was to be sold and he would have plans of a smaller description in which the in the sling purchaser would be enabled to put his finger on the very line which he might desire or intend to be) (Cheon ) 'Hint was las law with regard to the land question (Cheers) If he were accused of being a son after he would say that as such his interest was father to his wish, for he main mud it was the desire it was the interest-of Every squatter to see population springing up around them. No doubt demagogues qtudni ncs and humbugs men whose desire ippi area to be to establish the maxim of the first French revolution that property is a robbery, would say otherwise, an I possibly even after the" explanation he had now given his remarks might still b misrepresented ; but he would repeat his object was to open the market for the purchase of land on reasonable an I equitable terms to all (Cheers ). In selling the public lands it" would feel that he was bound to get the fair value of it as much as if it were his own at I that he was so men to rain burst the full value to the public if they applied the same rules to the Government in this matter which they would apply to their own private affairs they would take a safe view of the question (He is heard ) V public man spoke for the public His words were reproduced each morning in the columns of the public journals and, unless lit spoke the truth and promised only what he intended to perform, he would be acting with as little wisdom as truthfully -, md, therefore he promised in advantages which he did not intend to be real, and which he was not determined to carry out to the best of his ability, no matter whathunbugs might say to the contrary (Cheers-) The second subject to which he would allude, was the position of the Government at the time he and his colleagues oak charge It had been said that, from his ambition and his nnpind'aicc, he had taken a position he should not have taken, and that consequently the country had been injured, and therefore he should be put out and Mr Campbell put in Had he and his colleagues not taken thee, what would have been the effect On the 21st of April last the State vessel was becalmed close to the rocks, there was no one at the helm and the Governor was like the ancient mariner, sitting in his ship with nothing but ghosts around him (Air Simms You will be a roar annual ) He might be near admiral, he would wear his colony on Ju scholars colour was the native blue, and Air Simms might see him if he attcncWl, xv oaring it V voice Campbell for ever A sicoxD voice Oh, j c31 the man who will not tie himself to any principle, but simply became Campbell of the What of Air Dox vi used continued He was afraid he could not indulge them with any jokes this evening at Mr Cowper's expense for that gentleman had laid himself so open to IO'SCS that if he (Ali Donaldson) were once to commence joking about him he would crack their sides with laughter before he concluded On Monday they would see this " rat a was in ten t s, ' who, like the ostrich, buried his head in the sand-of the wharf shot mg oal) Ins stern The Opposition had let the cat out of the bag When it was found Mr Cowper was at the back of this, Mr Martin wrote an insolent letter a id Air Flood came out at the last moment, and Dr Lang acting-clerk great confusion ensued, and the latter part of the speaker's sentence was inaudible] He was not going to say any thing against Dr. Lang or the other gentlemen who of names he had mentioned, he was only going to add that Mr Charles Cowper would make an excellent Colonial Secretary (Laughter) Dr Lang a capital Treasurer, for he would keep the cash (Cheers and laughter.) Mr Martin an Auditor-General, and Mr Flood probably would act as Solicitor and Attorney General both (Touclcheers and laughter ) (A voice "Lay down ) No he did not intend to do anything of the kind , but with reference to the state of the country, supposing no on had taken the helm of State (i voice, " V he would have been the booby on the) aid regatta), that was the question , the ship would have been drifting away, her helm neglected, and when parlia- ment met there would have been no Government to meet them-no policy prepared instead of is at present a liberal course of action proposed, and probably carried out, and it the present Government remained in office he had no fear, was, no doubt, but that they would be able to guide the ship of State safely through the quick sands and shoals by which it might be surrounded He would call their attention to those gentlemen who had joined him in the service of the country, for the merit due to him was due to them likewise In the first place Air Darvall, who was a gentleman of the highest standing in the professions w Inch he belonged, was offered the Attorney Generalship, but he, wishing that the country might have the benefit of the able assistance of Mr Manning chose rather to take the less lucrative office of Solicitor-General, and the acceptance of office was to him a sacrifice and not a gain (Three cheers given for Mr Darvall) Mr Manning, preferring to he of some service to the country rather than accept the pension to which he was entitled, for nothing, saved the country £000 no annum, by taking office, md he" (Ali D) might here mention, that Mr. Manning had recently) given a cheque for £3000 on his father's pub he account (Three hearty cheers for Mr Manning) Air Holt, bx devoting himself to the service of the country, suffered a loss, and Mr Macarthur, they would also admit must also have joined norn dis- interested motives Mr Nichols, for whose health greatness had been entertained, but who had with ciently recovered to attend to his duties, sacrificed a profession worth £2000 a ) car to accept an office that was not nearly as lucrative, and those were the members of his cabinet and they would, if re-elected go through the difficulties surrounding the Government for the benefit of the country, c to que in de and in i years to come the country would see the benefits of their services they all knew the philosophical belief that the atmosphere" which surrounded this earth gave them life-so with political life the atmosphere which surrounded a public man and gave him public life, was the confidence and esteem of his fellow -men Without them he must sink into oblivion, but with it, public life was the nearest approach to Paradise he knew it was the enjoyment of the greatest happiness next to love, and that he must give of the first place , it was that public confidence which bore him up He hoped they would not content themselves with standing his meetings or leading what the papers said about him, but if they wished to show their confidence, the) mist not forgot to be at the poll on 1 uesd u (Mr Donaldson resume 1 his seat amidst loud and prolonged cheers ) Mr. IS AIiTcurn moved, that Stewart Alexander Donaldson still retains the confidence of the electors of shelterless, and they pledge themselves to use their strenuous enden ours to secure his return in the ensu- ing election Huco cheers were then given for Air Donaldson Mr Alircuixi addressed a few words to the meets, but, owing to the confusion, created by a levy persons opposed to Mr Donaldson, and the tremendous cheers of Air Donaldson s friends his remarks were for the most part inaudible Mr P R I VAiox seconded the motion, urging the necessity of sending a member to the House to re- present them who was able to propose useful measures, and who had ability to carry them out.
