A CURIOUS STORY. In the last n timber of the China Overland Mail we find the following: — 'A curious story is in circulation amongst the Chinese — carious, as it re In tee to the alleged appearance of the murdered man's spirit asking for re dress. Some time ago a Jan k sailed from 'ioifoong, containing a number of coolies for the barracoons of Macao. Having arrived tbere, tbe live cargo was quickly disposed of, and the captain roceived as freight something over 1000 dollars. This incited the helms man and sofue of tho crew to league them selves with two piratical junks to attack the boat and to rob the captain of the money, A. short time ago the junk left Masao, going back to Hoifoong. On tbe way, near Chang Chow, the two pirates hove in sight, and the helmsman steered close up to them, when tbe pirates boarded the junk, killed tbe captain and threw him overboard. Here comes the ] mysterious part of the story. The master of the Luk Koe barracoon one night dreamed a dream, iu which he saw tbe ghost of the mur dered man before him, saying he bad been murdered, that lie wss robbed of his moaey, and that he wished the barracoon master to complain and try to obtaio redress for him, which he thought would not be difficult, ns the pirateB were sailing off Chong Chow. On tbe strength of this dream the barracoon master complained to the Portuguese autho rities, who sent oat a gunboat, and the pirates were fonnd at tbe spot indioated by tbe ghost. It is said that the crew of the attacked junk, who had come to Hongkong since the robbery, bad gone over to Macao. One of them was the brother of the deceased, and had been oat in several places. Whether there ia any truth in tbe statement of the appearance of the ghost or not, the facts of the robbery and capture are correct.
