BOER PLAN OF CAMPAIGN. CAPTURE OF PiETERMARITZ BURG. GORDONS AT ELAND'S LAAGTE. , PRAISE FROM COLONEL SCHIEL. LONDON, Nov. 13, 3.50 p.m. Colonel Adolph Schiel, General Jou bert's 'tactical ghost,' and the real brains of the Boer campaign, who was captured at Eland's.; Laagte, has ad mitted that the intention of the Boers in their invasion of Natal was either to overpower or to elude the British forces holding Ladismith, to advance rapidly on Pietermaritzburg, capture that town, and then dictate terms of peace. He further ^admits that they .had quite underrated their adversaries. All the Boer leaders thought the plan could easily be carried out, and that they would meet with little or no opposition. He (Colonel Schiel) could see now that the task they had so lightly set them selves was utterly hopeless and doomr ?ed to failure from. the outset. The ex-Prussian officer of Hussars is . also higly complimentary on the valour of the British troops, both at Glencoe and at Eland's Laagte. At the latter place, in their magnificent rush up the heights, he says the Gordon High landers fought so grandly that he feelr he must salute their uniform whenever he sees it.
