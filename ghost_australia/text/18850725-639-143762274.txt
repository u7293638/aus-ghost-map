CRUMBS. Dog-day. Mr. L. Gormly, Wagga, to be j udge. The dog-men very excited — in fact, mad. Wife of a local Boniface : Be off with ye, ye informers. No hope, according to Mr. Farnell, of the Local Government Bill being passed next session. The Mahdi has positively given up the ghost. He died on the 29th June from small-pox. The Postmaster-General is opposed to the free postage of newspapers, and in his annual report he proposes a charge of one halfpenny each. Wagga stock crossings : — 100 bullocks, Mr. Y. Jenkins owner, from Queensland to Nangus ; 100 bullocks, Mr. G. Lintott owner, from Queensland to Cunnuydroo ; 700 mixed sheep, Mr. G. Power owner, from Lake Albert to Ropingpoles; 8,470 mixed weaners, Mr. T. Harden owner, from Boree creek to Melrose. Mr. Levien at Gosford : " The day is not far distant, when I shall publish to the world the the grossest case of robbery [query, " jobbery"] that has ever taken place in New South Wales. I am now referring to a matter which I have had the honor to investigate, and if it is but the only public duty I will have performed, I will thank my God that I was able to dis- charge it up to the present, and I hope I will be able to fufill it to the end."
