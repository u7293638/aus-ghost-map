Topical Sketches , :. By EZRA Soo :' ... l" hlAMLET PINT IIIT:SUR URS.&, One day lst nuLsek the ptf stlibrught me an invitationto' attendd a p-erforin;;iae 'f "llaslet"'lrhiech was to be giscrienmder the auspices of the Collingwood '"orties,;' by various members of, that body who had been inspired by,;Mr., Miln's admirable re presentation of the Prince of Denmark. On the evening set.aside for.the play, I accord-. ingly ventured to the furthermost corner of that delectable suburb, and duly presented nyself at the theatre, which wnas no other than a long cellar occasionally used by a publican for theustorage of hiscommodities. After modestly falling down the steps which led totthe cellar, I-found, myself, confronted by a hlaughty-looking'dobrkecpj'r, who' was proudly expectorating' tobacco juice on the opposite wall, and, at: intervals,'whistled 'a tune through his teeth'which sounded like a wail from a wounded wombat, only more so. "Is this the 'place where 'Hamlet is to be produced 'to-iight !" I- asked, to make assurance doubly sure: "You bet your bloomin' boots it is," he answered, spurting "a pint "of pang-essence over his shoulder. '"of?yer stiff, pal ! ?" I infterpreted"this to refer to nmy'tikedt, and gve it td him, and as I passed through the doorway ibe said, " -" "Roost w herd yoit like, loss' it's all one price, toffs or no toffs;" 'and accepting: the intitnation, I dose a place.at the side; ad took observations of the curious scene aromid me. At the farther end of the cellar, sohe barrels 'had i been placed' together and covered with boards which irepresented .the stage. The orchestra, a boy 'tith an ac cardeon, sat on one corner of this platforni, .nd the audience, to the number of thirty or forty, squatted on' gin cases, kerosene tins, casks and such like. The place was lighted up with candle-ends stuck in beer bottles, with here and there an oil lamp distributed about to vary the monotony. The specta tors were of either sex-in some cases it was hard to tell which-and conducted them selves with an entire absence of that cold etiquette which obtains so largely in the mansion of the aristocrat. Titus, while one young man would be gallantly reclining on his sweetheart's bosom, another would be imbibing common ale from a pannikin, and gently bantering the actors on the stage. There being no "wings" or dressing-rooms, the actors, after delivering- their lines, would step off the stage, and mingle amongst the audience, until called sui~i'by apimply faced youth, who acted as stage manager, call boy, and prompter, to "resuman their parts. I learned afterwards that there had been no studying from the book, the actors and a:tresses relying on what they. had picked up from hearing Miln, and filling in crevices' witl what had seemed most appropriate to them. There were no acts or scenes;, the performers skipping from' one" part to another just as the stage magager directed. Two or three rehearsals had given a Ieciuliar sort of regularity, but there wasn't. eiougli of it to bet on with any certainty. - On my entrance the stage was vacant; and the stage manager was calling on the ' star." "Chuck yerself around, 'Shortl',' the Ghost's waiting," he said; "yetrcan ave yer boose after'ds,'"and "Shorty," pitttin& down a bottle from which he lad been seeking'-in spiration, ran his dirty fingers tlhrbugh' his greasy hair, and swaggered up to the stage, while the manager said, "This yore is where 'tilet cops sight on ther bloomin' Ghost, so sling' it orf yei chest, Shlorty-yer knows 'ow to do it." ' "Shorty' was a bull-necked, flat-nosed individual, dressed in a Crimniean shirt, no collar, bell-bottomed trousers, boots: with high, narrow heels, and a red belt round his waist. Puftingtwo fingers'in his 'nouth, he drew them around his teeth,'and pulled out a quid of masticated, tobaccd, which he threw with considerablo'force against the wall, where It remained, while he, gazing at It solemnly, roared out, ini'a?oice strongly I aggestive of-" Any bottles to sehl -bottle he i! bottle ho !'-the. speech'shicsh;as a rule, starts with Angels and ministe rsof grace, defend us l' This is'" Shorty's " version: "Holy Smoke I here's'a go, take my word fir it. : wonder what the": Moses it; is.

The Ghost,whowasan enaciated youth ina blanket, in lieu of a sheet, I supposo, replied: tt"Shorty" thus: " .
