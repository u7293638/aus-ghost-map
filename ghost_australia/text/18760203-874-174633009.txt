" THE PLAGUE OF 1878." (From the Argus, 1900.) AFTEE raging three weeks, as described hi the Argus foi 1S78, " A Still Strong Man" arose with an iron hand" and will, and made himself li Director," who turned out the last two members, viz., the rival secretaries, still clamouring in spite of the horror around—one for Dissolution and the other against locking the doSFs of TaHiament House and the Tdwri^Uall, &c;, called round hini all whose constitutions had withstobd thcpllgue; ihey levied xm |h<vj»aiilcs, and givuig and treats, &Ci.; to alllhe poor and whoever wished, they were, sent up country anrf di^&^juiipngst the large estates;jiro ttim. Bjviding his supporters into parties. one company fired all the baekslnms, rookeries, Chinese dens. &r;<\\. and blew theni lip with gunpowder ; another parly were pfevided with earbolie disinfectants, sulphur, &c.;, and the whole city was fumigirtetllicaidjolicised, and the stfcfets even covered with them. The Director having no pretence to speculative science, concluded that the Plague of ISli^ghtliavclieejieaiised by polluted waters, had tons of the most powerful dMiifefeiahts poured into the Upper Yarra, and also into the Van Yean, saying it was as well to be poisoned by them as by plague-water. Another company went round ami'tilled up all the cherisliedcorpoirition holes, made large bonfires of all the rubbish, and visited all the manufacturers of abominations, lynching the proprietors and firing the premises which were not kept strictly clean. All this being strictly carried out, and the city thoroughly fumigated by the aid of the imrn^^ piles of^coal and timber in the swamp, Chinese lotteiy-tick^^^m-suc, opium. Sec., the Director, considering that the plague mjjgfii be due to iallurie" emanations, had all the streets of the cit^|pid suburbs oyeiQaiil with a coating of coal tar and other sj^jSjajS^, thus preventing the rising of noxious exhalations, the accumulating of mud in rainy weather and dust in hot, and xaUsirig ^^enerAl healthy effluvium of gas tar to pervade the whole atmosphere within a radius of ten iniles round Melbourne, instead of the?orm^%herished oorpomtioU';jmixture.'';;$ai , Hi^ air and water haviug be&ifh.us; powerfully acted on, the Still Strong Director of the Iron Hand fiftd Will and his friends retired to the Town Hall, to await calmly the result and drink success to their labours in the defunct City Council's best wines, while J.H.K.S.P«.A.M. played pieuns on the organ in his praise, and the only editor remaining of the Argus staff, in addition to the inevitable leader on free- trade, always had a sub in the Director's honour. The Age, which still had a ghost of a squeak left for dissolution, vowed that next to Berry, the Director of the Iron Hand, See., was the only man who could have saved the country. As for the Telegraph, that respected journal collapsed at the first attack of the plague, enhanced by heavy tea-fights and general debility. And 1'UXCH, the chief supporter of the Director of the Iron, &c.; Sec., was about to propose the usual Coppinian swindle of the inevitable emu egg testimonial, when onv reporter loft.
