This latter circumstance led to Mr. Ryder's appear- ing' as second in oh adair of honour, which the ' late, Lord, Sidmouth, then 'Speaker of 'the House^f.

In- the month of february. 1820, an event took; pUce, the narrative bf which seems more properly to enter into a .biographical notice of, Lord Harrowby, than into,the memoirs of any other amongst the eminent persons who might have been'affected by. its results.. A gang of conspirators, with' the .well-known Arthur Thistlcwaod as their lender, formed, a carefully-. organized plan. to assassinate. all .the King's ministers. On the 23rd af February, a cabinet dinner was to tált© pisco at tho residence of1 Lord1Harrowby, in Grosvenor- square; and, although government learned some particulars of the plot, the precise hour appointed for its execution had not been jnado known at the Home Office until within a day or two of tho time which the conspirators had chosen for the perpetration of this enormous atrocity., Lord Harrowby was tho first to-be made acquainted with th« exact moment intended to bo fatal to himself..and his colleagues;, and'it was generally believed that his Lordship re oeivod information on tho subject from a mon who. seemed casually to have met him in tho Park,. Of course, the intended.dinner in Grosverior-squaro was privately postponed ; and twelve liow-strcct officers, with Mr. 'Birnie, tho magistrate, at. their head,- acting upon previous information, proceeded.to pAto street, Edgewarc-road,. where, in ' a hay-loft, nearly thirty of the conspirators had assembled,. Nine of these .were, after a desperate conflict, taken into custody ; and eventually five of tho number wera .executed., Thc. conspirators had ?provided cutlasses, carbines, pistols, doggers,, and bayonets) sufficient.to arm a hundred men. They had a large supply'; .of.ammunition, |be- sides several ' hand granad est; and they, were fully ' resolved to destroy jwéry individual, whom they might Änd^ia^iLord.Hajrowby's house. This awfuilyj. criminal .purpose .was, however, frustrated by.tta^cjeax «nd exact in-, formation which the Government contrived to. obtain. r Of. Lord Harrowby's life, either In public, cr, private, Texy. little more remains to bsrer. corded.. Every .ono recollects, that during.the ministry, of .Lord liverpool .-.the Koman-Ca- tholic claims were regarded- as an,,".open qäestion."' Of this, Lord .Harrowby evoUod himself,' and .'generally supported a .measure of ' relief. Though ' "ho hod been' .through life.': a jealous member, of the- Church ot England.'.he did hoÇ oppose, .but on , the. contrary supported, a -repeal of the Test, and Corporation Acts. On the 17th of August, 1827, tho Buke of .Portland ^kissed hands as President of the .Council, and the noble, earl just deceased,' finally retired, from., the service of, the. Crown. For, some y sari afterwards, he continued to attend the 'House of Peers and occasionally, to assist in its deliberations by. delivering, with his usual good sense and good taste, a few of those just and. appropriate re- marks by which Jiis speeches in carly life were usually .characterised. But-.-gradually his attendances became less frequent ; at length he began. to vote - by proxy, and finally, was' no moro seen in the. senate-house," Full twenty years, have elajwed'aince his lordship withdrew, from public life.to'.that dignified leisure .which he had carácd.hy.á career of useful activity, .to thatrbpjMB wbich'the infiriaities of;advancing years demanded, and.to those, opportunities, for reflection and 'retrospect-whioVaU, men .désira to; enjoy towards the close of their earthly existence. _, .
