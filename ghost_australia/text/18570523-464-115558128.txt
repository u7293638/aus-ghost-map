SWITZERLAND. In Geneva, which has been called the' Rome of Protestantism,' superstition is at present presented in a form so profane and ridiculous as almost to ex ceed belief. Under the name of ' Bortism,' a certain Uort, a Protestant Minister, has just founded the religion of ' Speaking Tables.' A crowd of de votees have attached themselves to this new doctrine. The object of their superstitious worship is a table, around which piously assemble the believers. The UJIillV.l U.1IU -]£/L,-lJ-W U- lllltl lUIJll, UIUI It J , llll, IMUUlll Ml the Minister are amongst the most distinguished. For example — ' The Angel David,' the. ' Angel Uriel,' the 'Angel Gabriel,' the,' Angel Luther,' the 'Angel Michael,' and more often, by a profana tion still more impious, Our Lord liimsel f introduced, and when He commences to speak He announces Himself by these words, ' Peace, my lambs, in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.' Then the assistants rise and con. tinue standing through respect, but remain seated while the other spirits speak. Already the answers of this new oracle form two volumes, published by M. Bort under the title of ' Divers and Mysterious Revelations or Communi cations between Heaven and Earth through the me dium of a Table. Lausanne, 185 !?.' In these two .volumes there is not, according to the editor, a syl lable which has not been dictated by Heaven, the preface ' by Jesus Christ Himself,' n second preface is 'by 'the Angel Gabriel,' and declares to be false the assertions of.some, that the revelation's Which' follow were the- work of Sataii. In it a hew ' Our Father' is taught by the Snviour. There are histories of the Millinarians and a hundred other reveries of the same description. — Univers.
