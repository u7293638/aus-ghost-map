ABOUT THOSE GUNBOATS Our popular and rospoctsd Agont- General, Mr Robert Murray Smith, is about the Inst man ill tho world to. do nny thing out of a mere wish for notorioty. Otherwise thore might have hcon just tho ghost of a suspicion that ho desired to Bhow tho British Government that there had boon a slight uiistako in loaving tho representative of Victoria without the titular distinction conferred upon Sir F. Dillon Bell and Sir Saul Samuel, Eho'Agents-General- for Now Zealand' nnd Now South Wales, Had lie been actuated by such a uiotivo, bo cnuld not havo taken a better course to put it in action than that which circumstances havo forced upon him, As a matter of foot, of course, bo could do no thing less as a loyal subject of the Quoon, aril ae the representative of a loyal and dovotod community, than make tho offer of the gun boats, wbich happened to bo ready for sea at tho vory moment when tho breakdown of tho Egyptian military system forced the British Govorumout to send forces to Egypt, Such offers iuo tho plain duty of all persons so placed. But thoy are sometimes rather embarrassing, and tho British Admiralty seem to have boon not n littlo jpuzzlod. Firstly, they expressed n littlo offended sur prise because tho gunboats had assumed naval status and; displayed tho British standard before they had been formally recognised as vessels o f war ; secondly, thriy fonnd out that their own resources wore sufficient, and politely declined tho proffered aid for which, however, thoy expressed thoir thanks in a propor aud graceful manner, Now they eeem to have discovered, what every one olso'know nlroady— that is, that tha gun boats are really vessels of war, as a simplo uiiiiucr ui nice, ana cant to aoiay thou roco nition would be, to eay the lonst of it, an un necessary aud undeserved discourtesy. But from this follows tho fact that as vossols of war passing tho scene o' operations thoy are actually hound to report themselves to tho commander in ohargo in case their services are required, nnd this is the posi tion of the caso borne out by the Intost tolo- grams— "If recognised ns vessels of war by tho Admiralty, thoy will have to report to Admiral IlowottatSuakim as they pass through tho Red Sea, "And to this we may add that if.whon thoy report, Admiral Hewett havo any neces sity whatever which they can supply, it will bo his positivo duty to accept thoir cervices; so that wo may yet seo tho Victorian gunboats engaged in the Egyptian operations. It ie not necessary to add that wo shall all ho very delighted to see thorn of any use to tho mother country in an emergency. Tha only department that cornea with less eredit than is desirable out of the transaction is the Admiralty, which has actually, byjdeluy- ng recognition of the status of Uio gunboats, introduced a doubt as to whether thoir cervices woro or wore not available, Mr Murray Smith vory correctly gauged public feeling in this colony when ho offered, jaa tin immediate and voluntary courtesy, tho aid which, in any real omorgoucy, tho Queen oonid clsim as a right, and it is not tho first timo that an Australian colony lias shown a Britiuh Government department itsjdnty, aud ound it slow to learn the lesson.
