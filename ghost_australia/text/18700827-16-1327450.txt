MARYBOROUGH. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) August 25. ShOE my last letter we have had several changes of weather, cold nights succeeded by warm and summer days ; these again followed by a drizzling rain and thunder storms Now we are enjoying a return of sunshine, and it is sincerely wished by all that fine warm weather will be our portion for some time to come One of the local sugar mills attempted to crush last week, but owing to the unpropitious weather the cane was not fit and operations had to be suspended for a short time longer Tbeciush ing season ought now to commence The mills are ready, and if a success ion of Lot days come in a fortnight. we shall be in the midst of making sugar The Building Committee of the School of Arts have abandoned the idea of raising money in the town for the purpose of building a new hall, and at a meeting of the subscribers to that institution last Tuesday, a resolution was carried to apply to the Hon the Colonial Secretary for the loan of Â£1000 at 6 per cent, so as to enable the committee to carry out their proposed object Much grumbling is now going on among us (and very justly, too, I think) about not having an Inspector of Weights and Measures The consequence is that all kinds of measures are used in the town, and sometimes the buyer suffers very materially We ought to have an authorised person to adjust our weights and Ethics, and no one wishes for it more than our principal storekeepers Among miscellaneous news I may mention the arrival of the schooner Jason, with OG Poly Friesians on board, and the arrival of 25 very fine rams from the celebrated stud flock of N. P Bailey, Mudgee, purchased for the Messrs Jones-, Boonara Station, in this district. The Maryborough Chronicle of the 23rd says -We have also availed our small difficulties with the aboriginal race, and we suppose we shall until they die out or become in number so in significant that their existence may practically be disregarded Just now their presence in town is very obtrusive, they seem to be plentifully supplied with liquor, and being either half drunk or wholly so, their language and demeanor is anything but decent and agreeable in a community calling itself civilised The rowdyism of the blacks seems to occur as a sort of epidemic, breaking out at longer or shorter intervals with great violence, in proportion, no doubt, as they are supplied with money and grog by white men A good deal of harm, we notice, is done by strangers when passing through the town to whom these half naked savages are evidently curiosities by getting a group of them in our principal streets to indulge in their wild cries and fantastic motions for their amusement, liberally rewarding them by doles of small change, on which the poor wretches mediately go and get drunk in the name of decency, order, and respect for our common repute, we beg our fellow townsmen to aid the police in keeping down the nuisance For some time past our townsman, Mr Howland, has devoted his spare time to constructing a new description of boat It can busts of two i tubes, euch formed of cedar staves, hooped with non and forming an elongated cigar shaped cv finder J is so tubes are sixteen feet long, fifteen inches diameter in the centre, and tried to it point at either end 'They are placed pul nth 1 to each other, at it distance of three feet, spanned by two transverse iron bars, on which is fixed a long cedar box, containing heats The vessel is fitted with a must and sail, und goes-very well under canvas, not being liable to be new hoped or upset She has also a puddle on a new principle, being suspended on two acres near the bow, and, when working, describing the segment of a circle, the puddle is worked backward and forward, between the tubes, on a lunge, by means of two rods held in the public's hands When pushed forward the paddle moves vertically along the surface of the water, and, when making the stroke, it takes the water perpendicularly 'the whole con In once we understand d, is regarded merely as on cxpt raiment, and IB, no doubt, capable of being (greatly simplified and improved 'The boat is to amend the The former, and is now afloat on the river, and II y p iron on the look out for this strange ei day is have frequent opportunities of araucaria, his performances We in understand that Mr. li cloth, 1' M , as local immigration agent, has el edutck^ium to the a fleet that the living Gio an, immigrant ship, which sank d fin v J attention June 4, may be expected at Mimbjrniqh in about a fortnight in our own while the number of mum grants allotted to our district is- we hear, -JO, which are classified as follows M irriotlcouj les, 30, single men, 52, single of mails, by, the remainder being made up of children and young persons. We are informed that several applications for the kinds of labor most in demand have already been made, and as the busy season of the year is just commencing, there is no reason to doubt that the whole of the now rounds will be absorbed in a very short space of time Mr Mcioio, photographer, Sturt street, has shown us some very admirable illustrations of the progress of the timbering industry on Fraser's Island 'The timber, judging from the photos in question, must be remarkably tall, straight, and well grown There is quite a colony of the bar getters on the islanders whom the blacks render valuable usaistiinctTin then culling, the martial appearance of the latter, who seem to be on the most friendly terms with their white ghosts, is strikingly depicted, and the glories of a costume consisting mainly of pipeclay, and in comparison with which the most decollete of opera benuticB would appear even as a draped vessel, are vividly brought home to the astonished spectator. CANIA DIGGINGS-The correspondent of the Chronicle, under date August 13, says :-" I cannot send you a very glowing account of these diggings at present. Since the last rains the men find it impossible to compete with the water ; the consequence is that a large number have left no doubt, with the intention of returning again when the busy season is over. I have not heard of any heavy find, in fact I do not believe that one-fourth of the diggers have done any work this last fortnight. I believe there is a good bit of gold here yet, but there must be a few months of dry weather before diggers will have a chance to find it. I intend taking a turn round all the camps here in a day or two, and may be able to send you a little news next week."
