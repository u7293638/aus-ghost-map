FEDERATION. DRAFT COMMONWEALTH BILL OF j ADELAIDE CONVENTION. CONSIDERATION IN COMMITTEE. The consideration in committee of the Draft Commonwealth Bill was resumed. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that before the discussion on clause 92 was resumed he would like to read to hon. members a telegram he had received from Sir Henry Wrixon in reference to the costs of appeal to the Privy Council. A good deal had been said as to the costs of an appeal to England, and statements had been made as to the low rate at which counsel could be got to conduct business there. The appeal to the Privy Council in the case of Ah Foy v. Musgrove was a very simple one. It was a question of dry law, and the few facts connected with it could be stated on a sheet of foolscap. The telegram was as follows:- "Be Ah Foy v. Musgrove, total costs connected with appeal £1,476 4s. 6d.; total fees paid to Sir Horace Davey, £469 2s." (Laughter.) On clause 92 Payment to each State for five years after uniform tariffs " The TREASURER said there was a motion before the chair that clause 92 be struck out, and an alternative one inserted in place of it That motion, if he was not misinterpreting the hon, member who moved it, was following the practice which New South Wales, in its Legislative Assembly, desired to lay dawn. The great question for the committee would be not so much whether they entirely agreed with that proposal, because to a greatness in it most of them would assent, but seeing that the Convention did not appear to previewing; practical remedy for the financial dealer, the responsibility of tin eolntíeaeT*» fraud problem was, by a cM*3 Wi nature, thrown entirely into the hands of the Federal Commonwealth. They did not know ! the position they might be called on to enter. It might be necessary, as far as Tasmania was concerned, to wait some considerable period before she entered. As the Parliament of New South Wales would send several amendments to the Convention, would it not be advisable for Tasmania to send another alternative, and the alternative he was going to suggest would be couched somewhat in the following terms. He would propose to leave our clause 92, as the hon. m member for Devonport did, and after a few words only in clause 93, so as to cut out entirely the reference to this five year period. Mr, HENRY: Hear, hear, you are content to do that. The TREASURER said he was acting in the hope that there would be magnanimity enough in the larger States to enable them all to go into this federation with a common pocket and begin from the first to share and share alike in the revenue of the Comm HiwuaHh. He was compelled to admit that the prospects of this being accomplished were somewhat remote. He feared that any proposal for Dm Tasmania in respect to finance would not receive that consideration, because they had something to gain thereby, which a proposal from New South Wales, which professed to have something to lose, would receive. But if the federal spirit was gaining ground, and day by day as members met they were dayes nearer and nearer together, then he wsj^^»osed to think there was some hope forj^^Kprpose he had in view. If, therefor^^ôakT dealt presently with some of the claOOes he intended to introduce in lieu of the clause 92, they would then finish with clause 93. Mr. HENRY: Are you dealing with clause 92 The TRE PURER : No ; he was not discussing clause 92. He could not show what was to be substituted without referring to clause 93. He had pointed out that they had some substitutes, and it New South Wales was sending a substitute, Tasmania could do so at the same time, and they could both' be discussed at the Conven- tion. His purpose was that starting from the imposition of the uniform duties, so soon as they were settled by the Federal Parliament; then on the imposition of the uniform dumps it would be observed on reading clause 93 mention was made of " five years." Now be desired to strike out the time, " five years," and he also had another purpose in view, and that purpose was to have as small a surplus as possible in the hands of the Federal Executive for distribution. They had all been striving to arrange that there should not be a large surplus in the hands of the Federal Executive to be worked upon as it pleased. Therefore they had already framed, in clause 90, a plan with respect to the distribution of a certain surplus monthly. He wanted to cut down that surplus as much as possible, and secure another great desideratum, taking over by the Commonwealth the whole of the responsibility of every thing upper anning to the State. (Hear, hear.) Every time they discUBieil that subject he thought their way became clearer, and every time they moved in a wrong direction and reconsidered the matter, he thought they would be able to eliminate those that were wrong. There was a great difficulty arising in reference to the question when they mentioned the railways, he thought they should secure what was required without mentioning only the surplus earnings of the railways. He thought they would find the Customs revenue always on the assump- tion that they were imposed as indicated by the clause that had already been passed, to which no objection had been taken by New South Wales, or by any of the other colonies. Mr. HENRY : What clause? The TREASURER: Clause 90 No exception had been taken by New South Wales, nor by Victoria, nor, he thought, by South Australia, Mr. HENRY: They all agree about it. The TREASURER: He was assuming they would secure sufficient for all the States. He was not forgetting Mr. Holder's plea at Adelaide that there must be a sufficient revenue raised from the instrumentality of the Customs to meet the present needs of all the States. Therefore, on the assumption that the coming Federal Parliament would enact a tariff which would be sufficient to meet all those necessities, and that they would get something approximate to the marginal figures put forth on page 42 ; they would find that New South Wales would get a federal surplus of about ¿'2,000",000. while her interest would be a little over ¿'2,000,000. Victoria would also have a surplus, but South Australia and Tasmania, if they agreed to divide their surplus per capita, the people of Tasmania and South Australia would have a deficiency, rather than a surplus. It was therefore, in view of the deficiency which he had pointed out as almost certain to result, that he desired to insert certain words, and hon. members would see what the purpose of them was. Mr. HENRY: Will you explain that? The TREASURER : Yes ; if Mr. Henry would follow what be said. He would explain what his intention was with respect to the clause, and leave the rest to the Attorney-General as far as the drafting was concerned. His purpose was that in the whole of the succeeding clauses where the Federal Parliament had to deal with any States whose surplus was not sufficient to pay interest that it should be entitled to receive from, and should claim from the defaulters bonds to cover the amount. Bonds to cover the amount which, in the case, of Tasmania, be hoped would be a small sum, because their revenue was increasing month by month So they should not have such a large deficiency as was supposed. They would have to give bonds year by year until their surplus revenue was sufficient to cover the charge against it and interest. Mr. HENRY : What does that mean? The TREASURER: I am endeavouring to explain. Mr. HENRY : I have read the clause and do not understand it. The TREASURER : I am explaining the clause. v Mr. HENRY : I wish that the Attorney-General in drafting the clause would follow what the Treasurer is saying. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL: I apologise ; I was attending to something else. The TREASURER: On one side they would find a debit, and the revenue from the Customs on the State side. Mr. MULCAHY: Over and above the cost. The TREASURER : Yes. As he had explained, the revenue and expenditure of New South Wales and Victoria were likely to be approximately very close, so that for them no special provision need be made. But the Commonwealth would ask, "How are we to pay the deficiency with which South Australia and Tasmania will find themselves at the end of the year ?" If there were such a deficiency, the deficient colonies would be responsible to hand over bonds to the Commonwealth equal to the deficiencies. Let them work out a case. As far as the deficiency of Tasmania was concerned, let it be taken at £50,000. Then that amount would have to be made up by Tasmania. Mr. MACKENZIE : By taxation The TREASURER : Yes. And so with South Australia. They would have to raise the amount by taxation. Mr, MULCAHY: Direct taxation The TREASURER : Not necessarily. At the present moment South Australia had got a surplus, and under the Commonwealth it might be more because her tariff now was a low one, and gave only £1 12s. per head, whereas the proposed tariff gave £2. Therefore South Australia would not need to give bonds, but would pay it out of her surplus revenue. And Tasmania, if, as he believed, her revenue was going to be so much in excess of her present Customs revenue (for they would share in those advantages to which Mr. Henry had referred on a previous evening). If New South Wales by its Customs revenue made £2 Ss. while Tasmania only got £2, this colony would benefit in the proportion of the Commonwealth. By such a proportion as that, he was bold to Bay Tasmania would be considerably advantaged. (Hear, hear.) If Tasmania entered the Commonwealth on the principle to which so much reference had been made, and to follow the words of Mr. Bird for the common weal, and not looking to see who drank the most whiskey, and not separating individual colonies, then he was sure she would realise the advantages of being associated in the partnership. Mr. MULCAHY : Are you basing all your calculations on the present tariff of Tasmania? The TREASURER said the Federal Committee had charged the drafters of the Commonwealth to insert in their bills such clauses as would suffice to compel the Federal Parliament to raise revenue sufficient to place each colony in that position it was when it entered the Commonwealth. Therefore, if they based their work on such a proposal they would have such results. Tasmania, he believed, would not give any bonds at all South Australia would be £300,000 or £400,000 deficient as far as the Commonwealth was concerned. She would have £370 000 to pay to the Commonwealth. But the Commonwealth having taken over from her £931,000 of interest her ordinary revenue will come up and show an increase on that. Therefore, instead of having to give bonds she will be able to hand over her cheque at the end of the year. That was the meaning of the whole of those clauses. It might be argued that the State might refuse to pay the claims of the Commonwealth. There was no authority to collect these claims against a deficiency, although there was authority to collect a uniform tariff. They overcame that by agreeing that the practice should be to give bonds for the deficiency. But, suppose Tasmania were £50,000 behind on annual revenue there was not to be a funded debt. Mr. MACKENZIE : Is that the anticipated deficiency says (Continued on next Page). DON'T Couuir. - Relief can be obtained I immediately.

The colony was in debt-the con- solidated revenue was in debt and they should be that amount in debt under certain disadvantageous circumstances with the Federal Government and they would take time to pay the debt off The Federal Government would have the bonds It would throw upon the colony the responsibility, not only moral, but under Act, of raising a sufficient amount of revenue to recover those bonds within a reasonable period He would leave the matter at that in the hands of hon members Mr HENRY said, that in rising to make a few remarks on the important clauses which had been submitted, he would like to say, that although he had had the advantage of having the clauses placed before him, he confessed he had not taken time to study them only in a very cursory manner, but he must say that they appeared to him as very difficult to understand and complex Mr MULCAHY He understood the Treasurer's speech all right Mr HENRY questioned whether the clauses and the speech agreed altogether That was his difficulty in the best place he wished to point out that under the bill there was no provision for a surplus That was left entirely in the dark, and the provision of a surplus was really an all important consideration So far as providing a surplus was concerned under the proposals submitted in the amendment that clause 92 be struck out and that a new clause be introduced, there was no provision whatever for a surplus It rested entirely with the Federal Parliament. The TREASURER See the first words of -clause 90 Mr HENRY was sure that if the Treasurer would refer to clause 90 be would see The TREASURER That is as to the division of the surplus 54 Mr HENRY said the Treasurer merely knew that clause 'KJ provided merely for the distri button of surpluses during the periods before uniform tariffs were imposed Clause 99 was very simple, and was agreed to at the Convention, and at the Finance Committee, as a matter of course Under the Treasurer a proposals they were trusting entirely to the future Federal Parliament The ATTORNEY GENERAL We are compelling them to raise a certain revenue The TREASURER said the proposal was to strike out clause 92, and it would be seen that following what he had said, it would be absolutely necessary to secure that surplus Mr HENRY did not think the Attorney-General and the Treasurer agreed, and he wished to point out the difference in the minds of the two the Attorney- General had said that he relied on the definite obliga- tion being laid on the Federal Parliament to pay those debts, and every member knew that he was himself pretty strong on that point He held, too, that they should endeavour to come to some uniformity on that question (Hear, hear-and although he had been charged with acting in a party spirit there was no such thing in his mind But he could not having the convictions he had on the question, give them up because the Treasurer and he did not agree and he did not expect the Treasurer to give up his convictions At the name time he thought he was as much a trustee in the interests of Tasmania as the Treasurer The TREASURER Hear, hear Mr HENRY said he was amply justifying his position in the matter, and if members would study that new clause they would see that the amendments to clause 52 which had been distributed were precisely the same in effect as the proposals which he had submitted Mr MULCAHY The whole thing is Mr HENRY said that according to the Treasurers explanation it appeared to him that supposing the obligation was laid on the Federal Parliament to take over those debts at a 7 cr capita rate on the population, of their share of the surplus Customs revenue was a comparatively insignificant amount, the Feder if Parliament would have the right to come back on them for the deficit The Attorney-General, he thought, agreed with that The ATTORNEY GENERAL The deficit of interest Mr HENRY Assuming that the annual Tasmanian share of the surplus was £100 ODO, and the interest bill was £100 000, would the Federal Party ment have that claim upon Tasmania The ATTORNEY GENERAL Of course not Mr HENRY Yet that was the Treasurer explanation though there printed clauses did not say so If the Treasurer read them carefully he would see they only provided for deficit of interest according to population The TREASURER It comes to the same thing Mr HENRY How could the interest on £2 per head of the population of Tasmania come to £300 000 It was the interest on that they were, according to the Treasurer, to be liable for, but how could that amount to £200 000 » That was the problem to be considered The Treasurer hardly seemed to understand the proposal he had submitted to the Committee It hardly seemed right for the Committee to be asked to adopt proposals on an explanation which was not contained in them After having laid a definite obligation on the Local Parliament, the interest of the debt contemporaneously with it taking over the Customs and excise, the result he found on looking at the figures, was that a debt of £47 per head of population would necessitate a revenue of eight millions from Customs and excise to cover all expenses, loss on departments etc. Now, from what he knew of the feeling in the Finance Committee, and in the Convention generally, there was such a strong reluctance to face such a position as this, that he felt he must abandon it, for he knew that New South Wales for instance would not enter a federation in that way It was only the hopelessness of getting his own position accepted that made him give it up, for he still believed in it thoroughly That more over was the reason for his advocacy of falling in with the ideas of New South Wales, and trusting to the Federal Parliament He would take that risk knowing full well that the financial necessities of every colony except New South Wales would be such as to cause sufficient Customs and excise duties to be let led to make the State Treasury safe, and that would be the paramount consideration for the Federal Parliament if they over saw one Tasmania would strengthen New South Wales by sending forth as a voice of its own that these debts should be taken over and dealt with according to population The ATTORNEY h Y GENERAL Several of the New South Wales members were in favour of taking over the debts, but they did not enter much into the discussion personally Mr HENRY hoped they would not now have a lot of discussion on the point as he was ready to full in with the suggestions of the Treasurer though his own amendment was still before the committee, and if it were preferred he should not object to it At the same time he thought the Attorney-General should explain these new suggestions a little more clearly The ATTORNEY GENERAL thought Mr Henry understood them clearly enough, for be put the position very clearly when he assumed as a possible case the amount of indebtedness of the State which had the lost population at per head £47 Tasmania was ii" per head so it would only have to give bonds for the 12 difference ThelRLASURER And would have to pay interest on that, which comes to be in no thing The ATTORNEY GENERAL was not disputing what the Treasurer had said he was only giving as an interpretation of the clause what it was intended to represent Mr HENRI Has the Customs nothing to do with this * The ATTORNEY GENERAL No he had kept that apart Clause 11 proceeded with the distribution of the surplus, and he know that by itself, for the two things were different entirely They must both be provided for, and in that way would work harmoniously together They were taking the colony that had the lowest amount of debt per head The Commonwealth or the b Federal Government would take over the whole of the debt of the colony without any bonds at all Then it would come to the colony with the next highest debt. The Federal Government would take that over but would ask for equivalent bonds, or debentures, for the difference between it and the other colony p r i soils, and so they would go on all round those bonds were, be proposed to bear interest at 12 per cent. The TREASURER And so the working out would produce exactly what I say The ATTORNEY GENERAL did not say it would not All the colonies giving bonds for excess would have to pay interest on the excess until the census was taken His proposal was that a census should be taken in five years to allow for growth of population by natural causes immigration or otherwise, and for the condition of the colonies becoming redistributed in accordance with the changes of the industrial and commercial conditions of the Commonwealth The Parliament might decide to take the census more quickly, but whenever it HOB taken it would show which of the colonies had an increase of population, and they would be entitled to have a proportion of their debt cancelled according to the increase, we never it was They would be entitled to that on account of the increased revenue they would return to the Commonwealth treasury Mr MACKENZIE The revenue would show that The ATTORNEY GENERAL No, there would be no books kept to show it There would be no return of increased revenue it was by the increase of population that the debt would be cancelled, for under federation they would not go into questions of how each district of the Commonwealth lived or how much whiskey or tea it consumed, any more than they did so in America Mr MULCAHY How if the population fell off' The ATTORNEY GENERAL If there were a falling off of population the colony would have to keep on its debt, but there would be no increase on that account. Let them take each of the colonies as regarded the debt. If Tasmania increased to 200 000 in five years, it must necessarily be something less Mr MACKENZIE But supposing it is only 150,000 The ATTORNEY GENERAL said that that was an absolute decrease but he could hardly imagine that under federation any colony would absolutely decrease The rates of population would vary, hut a proportionate increase would not enter into the matter at all With an absolute increase the rate of debt per capita must necessarily decrease, until at last the excess vanished Mr MACKENZIE But we will still have to pay the bonds until the nine years' census is taken The ATTORNEY GENERAL said that if the effect of the Commonwealth were that the industrial and commercial interests of the colonies increased so rapidly that a large amount of population was attracted from the other parts of the world, the Parliament might say, " the time is now come to take that off ' He put down five years as a period that, in all probability, would be found to be very com- moment and proper in the order of things 4, Mr MULCAHY They will be gaining an additional revenue from the other colonies The ATTORNEY GENERAL said that he proposed to say immediately upon the imposition of uniform duties of Customs each State shall be deemed to contribute to the revenue an equal sum per head Let them take the case of Victoria for instance it had a lower debt per head than Tasmania For all they knew a system of book keeping might show a greater return to the Federal 1 reasury per head But what did that matter, when the constitution said that although that might be so, they were to be deemed to be contributing the same If they contributed the same, and increased by 30,000 people the) must naturally be deemed to he sending that larger amount of revenue to the Federal Commonwealth Mr FOWLER Supposing the colonies arepayingdifferent rates of interest upon their debts do you propose to equalise them 2 The ATI ORNE Y GENERAL Yes It comes to this, we have all borrowed lately at a less rate than we did formerly The TREASURER Nearly alike, £317 The ATTORNEY GENERAL said that if they attempted to divide their debentures, and Bay they would hand over to the Commonwealth all they issued up to a certain date and retain those they had issued since, they would be only retaining those of the smaller interest The Federal Government would have to take over the bonds as they found them, some at u some 4, and some 50 per cent. Mr. MACKENZIE Wa will be charged with exactly what we take-our interest. The ATTORNEY GENERAL The Federal Government will pay the interest for the debts of all the colonies per head Mr HENRY Will the Attorney-General make this clear ' Supposing that £40 per head is the lowest in any one State, which it SB in Victoria, will the Federal Government relieve each State absolutely, irrespective of what Customs may be returned, of £40 per head '' The ATTORNEY GENERAL Yes it will Mr HENRY No matter what the surplus is '' The ATTORNEY GENERAL Yes Mr HENRY And the lowest State shall be absolutely relieved for ever The ATTORNEY GENERAL YOB Mr HENRY And we will be liable for the difference of the interest on the debt The ATTORNEY GENERAL Yes Mr HENRY That is exactly what I understood from the Treasurer The ATTORNEY GENERAL I think he has it in his mind the same, but he has not got the same way of putting it The TREASURER said that he did not wish to complicate the matter in its) way but had merely tried to put before the committee what would be the absolute result, and whether the absolute result was that the Federal Parliament charged them with the smaller money or a larger amount of interest it would come to the same thing, because if they were going to charge interest on the £47 per head, and their debt, as in Queensland, happened to be £.>9, then Queensland would have to find the interest on the other £12 per head, which just came to the same thing As far as the reading of the clause was concerned, he left that to the Attorney-General and only cared to arrive at this conclusion, as to what were to be their responsibilities, and getting rid of the payment of their in terest, that what they did not take out of their surplus they had got to find He was only adhering to his statement that they were going to do this equitably and regard each other as brethren If they were going to apply the principle that no one should lose anything then there was now out of it but to keep their books for themselves The great difficulty was that New South Wales would never charge itself. It would mean her raising a revenue through her Customs of nearly 50s per head, whereas in the present year the revenue was only 25s per head The result would be that New South Wales would be raising a very much larger revenue than she needed to raise, but, however be put it be simply came back to the statement of figures pretty nearly as he had stated them to the House Mr. HENRY said that he had no desire to prolong the debate, but wished to call the attention of the Treasurer to his figures If the Treasurer's way of looking at it was right, it was serious If they were to be relieved of £40 per head, but no assurance of what surplus they might get The TREASURER We keep the first few lines of clause 62. Mr HENRY That provides an aggregate surplus It would not give us enough The TREASURER It is giving us enough, as this year is giving us enough, if we went into federation next year Mr HENRY Victoria IS 40 and we are £19 Mr WOOLLNOUGH £47 Mr B.r NltY £47 is the mean , ours is £49 and Victoria is only £40 The TBHAMJIiER The funded debt is £47 but the floating debt is over £400 000 Mr HF N RY said that the position he had always held was, that if they took away our C customs a definite obligation should be laid upon the Federal Government to give them an equivalent. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL Jost M in hol. Mr HENRY said that the figures he wished to call attention to wore these If the financial obligation was laid on the Federal Government, it would only be equal to 2lb 000 of interest, and they would take £170 000 of Customs revenue How about the alarming gap between £250,000 and £170 000' He wished the discussion to be postponed until 4 o'clock next day, that they might have time to think over it. The TREASURER supported the course suggested He did not know that he was at issue with the Attorney-General They had the same object in May, but had gone about it in a different way He would far rather wm k on the lines he had laid down that o\ ening that the whole of the interest should be taken over with the whole of the debt It left them in this position for the future, that so soon as they got into further debt, which he hoped would be through the instrumentality of the Federal Executive, then the same thing would recur It was quite right that they should have an opportunity of still further discussing the matter next day The ATTORNEY GENERAL thought the whole difficulty and it was only an apparent difficulty in expression arose from the fact that the Treasurer had in his mind the present Tasmanian tariff and the revenue coming from it They must remember that there would be a totally new tariff, and if the Treasurer remembered that he would see that he could modify his opinion and agree with himself (the Attorney) General) and the hon member for Devonport that tariff would no longer exist He thought that the Treasurer would see it The TREASURER I argue that the same tariff must exist The ATTORNEY GENERAL Yes, some uniform tariff, but it would not be our tariff or our surplus The Treasurer talked about our tariff and our " surplus there would be no such thing as our surplus it would be a general federal surplus They could not talk about their surplus There was another thing He did not think they should let their public debt trouble them Clause SC provides that the Commonwealth should appraise the value of all public works they took over The debt was about £150 000, and the amount that the Federal Government would have to pay for our public works would pay the public debt The TREASURER That is an easy way of paying off our deficiency The ATTORNEY GENERAL As far as our present debt goes Mr. WOOLLNOUGH said he hoped that the Treasurer would next time he brought the matter forward inform them what amount of interest Tasmania would have to pay to the Federal Government upon the bonds they would hold against this colony They would be due for something like £1,30 000 upon which they would have to pay interest amountingtoebout£42 000 madditiontoasum of about £60,000 they would otherwise have to pay as the cost of federation He thought it would be helpful to the House if the Treasurer could find time to give them some idea of the amount of money that would have to be paid, and, moreover, what amount of revenue they would have, and find out what extra taxation they would have to undergo The ATTORNEY GENERAL Our present i avenue would meet it all Mr WOOLLNOUGH He was glad to know that, and would be still more pleased if the Treasurer would point out how The TREASURER We cannot pay more than we are paying at the present moment Mr. WOOLLNOUGH They were paying it upon the present tariff It did not follow that the tariff they were going to have would be as high The people of Tasmania were poor people, and were going into partnership with wealthy people They were most heavily taxed as regarded their sources of revenue It was quite clear that when they passed over those sources of revenue to the Federal Government the tax was not likely to be heavy, the tariff might be less, and the cost of raising it would not be the same He would be glad if the Treasurer would explain the matter Mr HENRY The rise of the uniform tariff was not within the Treasurer's knowledge Mr WOOLLNOUGH ItappBarodtomm futile to say they had revenue, and should have revenue wherewith to pay that in debtedness something liko£l,d5U 000, which was to be their debt as distinguished from the federal debt In the meantime they had to (and interest on that money It would be helpful if the Treasurer would give them some sort of idea how those now liabilities were to be met They were now liabilities that could not be disputed He would like to know what new sources of revenue they were likely to have in order to pay them It appeared to him that there was a likelihood of them making a far heavier sacrifice in parting with the revenues they were about to part with than any of the other colonies As far as New South Wales and Victoria were concerned they were non paying more than Tasmania if they passed over the Customs and excise revenues they were practically paying 10 per cent more than New South Wales Victoria or South Australia Tasmania was actually undergoing a heavier sacrifice It seemed to him that some return was due to the people of Tas mania in order to make the sacrifice any thing like equal He again expressed a wish that the Treasurer who Id give some further in formation because they should have some idea how that expenditure was to be met The TREASURER That question had I already been answered It would be seen by all how difficult, how useless, it was to argue upon the basis of something that did not exist (Hear, hear ) He had therefaiealwuys I to speak in the subjective If the federal tariff was framed at Weather Tasmania [ would be very seriously affected If it was framed on the tariff as it existed to day, then Tasmania would come out all right what ever that tariff might be it would make no difference to Tasmania as far as the interest was concerned, and whether a part of the debt were taken over or the whole amount were taken over it would make no difference They could not be called upon to pay more than they were at present pay ing, they might have to pay part to the Federal Parliament, and part to their creditors, but they would have to pay the amount all the same. And then what was it going to cost them ' That had been answered, and it was apparent to his mind that the extra cost to Tasmania would be £64,000 Mr HENRY To the taxpayers The TREASURER Yes, he had already pointed that out There was £10,000 as a portion of which belonged to Tasmania of the £300 000 of new expenditure and £15,000 in connection with the post offices that was to be handed over 1 hot made Ul COD Mr. WOOLLNOUGH I know all that she TREASURER Then there was the sum of £10,000 more they would lose by reason of having to share in the more extravagant expenditure Notwithstanding that extra expenditure they would be receiving per head of the population from the Customs a larger area than 'Tasmania was collecting at the present time Mr DOBSON said he understood from the remarks of the Treasurer, that the colony was at least to lose 234 000 The TREASURER Yes Mr DOBSON He wanted that statement to go through the country coupled with the other statements that the treasurer had made, that if Tasmania adopted a uniform tariff and got the richer colonies to join, they would gain about £50,000 Mr HENRY More than that The TREASURER With a common pocket Mr DOBSON said that a great portion of the colony were under the idea that the coat of federation would be so great to Tasmania that they could not entertain it. He thought that was wrong The MINISTER OF LANDS Under this bill' Mr DOBSON They stood to lose 2,000, but got back under the sliding scale, and a uniform tariff, a greater sum than £64,000, so it was not correct to allow the people of the colony to believe that we would lose such an amount It struck him that Tasmania had hardly a right to talk about a federal spirit in the partnership in which she was about to enter If six men were entering into a partnership, four of them being wealthy and two poor, it would not show much of a federal spirit for the two poor ones to ask the rich ones to pay their share He did not think that they had a right to suppose that the four rich colonies should give out so much of their revenue to a poor colony. He desired to point out that the whole of the discussion they were proceeding with was on that basis It was perfectly true that the basis was suggested by Mr Reid, and that he appeared to have thought that if New South Wales got the benefit of her extra revenue for five years she might then be content to divide her larger contribution with the poorer colonies But look for a moment to the instructive figures that Mr Henry gave last Friday He had got the Statistician to take out some six articles of expenditure, and the anomalies of those between Tasmania and the larger colonies were quite as great under the uniform tariff as at the present time The items tea, coffee, sugar', tobacco, spirits, and beer were some 52 per cent of the whole Supposing the consuming power of Tasmania was equally below the consuming power of the larger colonies on good clothing, dried fruits, etc that would give the following figures New South Wales £2 Os 6d per head Vic tons, £2 5s 7d , Queensland, £2 4s t>d Those three colonies were almost alike, he would have thought Victoria to be a little behind. Those three could very well afford to change hands for uniform tariff South Australia was £1 13s 10d , which was 6- or 7s below the average for the three larger colonies, while Tasmania was £1 is 5d , which was £1 a head lower than the average, or a loss of £166 000 to the Commonwealth by Mr Henry was perfectly right when be said that the £("4,000 a year loss to Tasmania was a perfect fl able to what she would gain Then there was West Australia with a revenue of Li (is 100, which WaS £1 above the true larger colonies Mr HENRY they are in an abnormal condition There Mr DOBSON Q nts so it was an abnormal condition which could not last for ever but it was going on very steadily and might last f r years. Mr FOWLER Whnlisthecostof government in each colony' You have not told us that Mr DOBSON said he was only dealing with one part of the question of finance , he would come to that in a moment When the delegates of New South Wales and the Parliament of New South Wales began to discolor from stn istics that what they had to give up under the uniform tariff would be similar to what it was now he very much doubted whether they would show the federal spirit or in other words would they give up so much revenue There were three ways of dealing with the financial problem One was to pass Mr Henry s resolution similar to that passed by New South Wales and leave the whole matter to the Federal Parliament Mr BIRD Take a leap in the dark Mr DOBSON No sir, not take a leap in the dark They would be asking the Federal Parliament, by passing that resolution, to take a leap in the light At the Convention they were trying to take in my reins in the dark and they all ended in utter failure The second way was the proposal of Mr Piesse in another place, and that was an exceedingly good one If Tasmania was essentially the poorer colony, and if they had the right to live economically, and administer their affairs economically why should they be asked to join the richer colonies in a partnership they did not want they did not want to go to Mr Reid and told him to his chaff. offer If £10 000 a year was going to keep Tasmania out of the fodder for, the rich colony of New South Wales would give poor little Jassy the £10,0110 to join If Tasmania was going to ask to give more for defence, and to give up £11,000 on post and telegraphs, and to take up a share of a loss on other matters why should the poor colony be asked to go into federation Surely they could go in without losing £04,000 a year. The THE Abe Bill That would be by the book keeping principle Mr DOBSON hoped they were going to get over book keeping by the clause Mr Piesse had suggested He did not think Tasmania's share of the cost of going into federation should be more than Loo 000 or £30,000 The Federal Parliament should civ e back a sum every third or fourth year, having regard to the economy which spent loss on defence and produced from post and telegraphs Tasmania should have £00,000 a year for three or four years, and then the amount could be fixed again The figures could not be fixed for all time, for there might be a Government in Tasmania more economical, or a Government more extravagant than usual When the Treasurer told them that federation would cost £64 000 under that bill he ought to have told them that they would get back more than that (Hear, hear ) And with book keeping or without book keeping under certain clauses whichwouldbejuBttoTasmania.andwbichttuy had a right to put in and which he believed the other colonies would not object to, they could federate for £25 000 at the outside The SWISS constitution bristled with sections which reserved to certain States certain rights They were people speaking three or four different languages The ATTORNEY GENERAL Which we are not Mr DOBSON said Tasmania wished to join one colony worse off than herself, and three better, and in order to safeguard her self, wished to put in the clause that Mr Piesse had suggested The TREASURER said Mr Dobson had charged him with a responsibility that he could not accept Mr DOBSON thought the thanks of the community were due to the Treasurer for pointing out these things The TREASURER said the revenue to be made good in Tasmania in each of the five years would be - First year, £103 000 second, £84 000 third £6 6,000, fourth £47,030, and fifth, £28 000 After that, they would lose nothing they commenced to gain The revenue to be made good under the bill was about £115 000 in five years, and the people would have had five years of intercolonial freetrade from which they would have been saving out of the pockets of the tax payer £40,000 a year He suggested the post portrait of the clause The clause was postponed JJ Clause 98 "Tuting over public debts of States was postponed On clause 10/' When a law of a State is inconsistent with any of the Commonwealth the latter shall prevail and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid - The TREASURER said the Commonwealth could only make laws with respect to those measures which had been handed over to it Was it possible under the clause which had been read, that there could be any disagreement or anything incongruous' The ATTORNEY-GENERAL thought there was too much language in the bill altogether But the fact was this that the control of certain matters had been handed over to the Federal Government giving exclusive powers and if any State entrenched upon those duties that which the State did would be invalid It was quite possible that the State might some times entrench upon the domain of the federal Government and if it did, then any body who felt inclined might challenge the action and take the matter to the Supreme Court Mr HENRY The Supreme Court is the check The ATTORNEY GENERAL Yes. Of course there were some subjects upon which they were absolutely prohibited from touching Mr HENRY We could not make Customs laws The ATTORNEY' GENERAL No, and other matters might only be invalid because the Federal Parliament had already dealt with them Mr LEWIS And as to river navigation The ATTORNEY-GENERAL They would not deal with inter State commerce but if the river flowed altogether within the boundaries of one State, that S tat 3 might attempt to deal with it but not as to another stage There could be no harm done how ever, by leaving the clause in TheclaUBewas passed The AT TORNEY GENERAL moved that there be inserted in Chapter V the following new section -' The powers and authority of the Executive Government of each State shall be exercised by the Governor thereof, and the Parliament of each State may make such provisions as it thinks fit for the appointment of the Governor of the State and the tenure of his office and his removal from office He believed that in the Draft Bill submitted to the Adelaide Convention there was a clause providing that there should be a Governor in the State, but nothing was done the clause being ultimately withdrawn Some members took objection to dealing with the question of the powers of the Governor at all, and his friend Mr Wise, who very strongly supported the clause as it stood in the bill and also an amendment proposed by Dr Cockburn, ultimately agreed to the excision of the clause, because it was pointed out to him that it was compelling every State to have a Governor, whereas a time might come when they might desire to have a Board of Advice instead of a Governor He did not him salt believe that such a state of things would arise, but what he wanted to point out was this that there was another aspect of the question, which did not appeal to have been noticed by the members of the Convention and which he would bring under the notice of the House Some members seemed to think that each colony could at any time so alter its constitution as to provide some new method for appointing as Governor That was a very grave mistake There was no provision in the constitution for appointing a Governor at nil The Governor represented the Queen, and the Queen was supreme, and in some sense sole executive officer throughout the Empire, and she could at any time she liked appoint a Governor in any part of the dominion The constitution simply referred to the Governor as an office already existing, and no amendment of the constitution could possibly provide for changing the method of the appointment of a Governor The only power which could make any alteration would be the Imperial Parliament If at any time this colony or any other colony, desired to have its Governor appointed in any other way, then it would have to get a bill passed through the Imperial Parliament, which would be a law on the Imperial Statute Book. As had been pointed out by Sir- Samuel Griffith in the 1891 Convention, they were going in for quite a new departure with regard to the powers of amendment of their own constitution in the proposed Commonwealth Bill, and in that matter they were going a stage beyond that which was adopted in regard to Canada For better or worse they had agreed to take, and the Convention in Sydney agreed to take, quite a new departure, and to ask the Imperial Parliament to give them power to amend their constitution without going to the Imperial Parliament They were now actually making themselves, as far as possible, an independent nation with the same Crown as before They were practically setting up legislative independence, only they were retaining their allegiance to the same Crown as the supreme executive authority At the present time as he had pointed out, if they wanted to amend the present constitution with regard to the appointment of a Governor they would have to go and ask the Imperial Par- I lament to pass a bill for it, and so far as the Canadian constitution was concerned if they wanted to amend any part of their constitu- tion they were in the same position But they had deliberately in Sydney in 1891, and in Adelaide this year, gone . step beyond, and asked the Imperial Parliament to give them absolute independence, so that they should be a distinct nation with the same Crown head as the supreme executive power Therefore all amendments to their constitution were done by themselves without consulting the I'm - i penal Parliament in the matter at all Were A they going to put themselves in this most peculiar position, that with regard to the superior constitution, the Commonwealth itself, they were to have absolute legislative independence, and be able to amend it on their own motion, and yet in the inferior Parliament, with its restricted powers and of much less importance in the general relations of the Empire, they were to be compelled to trouble the Imperial Parliament if they wished to amend its constitution. Sir Samuel Griffith had spoken strongly on that point in the Convention of 1891, and then on the question of the appointment of the Governor he used similar language Some men are said, " Why not leave things as they were" But Sir 'Samuel Griffith showed that they were making a totally different departure and they could not leave things as they were This was the peculiar position they would be in The greater and more important constitution, which would certainly be more important in its relations to the Empire, more potent to affect the relations of this part of the British possessions with at of rest of the Empire, they actually had power to amend as they liked, while the subordinate, inferior and much more restricted constitution, which could not in anything like the same degree affect the relations of this part of the Empire with the rest, they could not amend without troubling the Imperial Government Mr DOBSON Do you contend that we can amend the Federal Constitution and take the appointment of the Governor General out of the Queen's hands The ATTORNEY GENERAL I BBy you can amend the constitution as a whole, I am not referring to the Governor General in particular Mr DOBSON That is the point. The ATTORNEY Y GENERAL said he was not referring to the appointment of the Governor General at all, but he would meet the question , he had no wish to shirk it The appointment of the Governor at present was no part of our constitution He was the representative of the universal and supreme Empire which existed outside the constitution, which, he might say, existed outside the Imperial Parliament, because it was a co equal and co temporary part of the British Constitution with the Legislature The Legislature of Great Britain did not create the Executive probably the Executive, the King and Crown existed before the Parliament Certainly it did exist before the Parliament in its bl cameral form Mr DOBSON You have not answered my question The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said he wanted to point out that the Governor represented that executive power, which existed co equally, if not previously, to any legislature in the Empn a » He had already pointed out that they asked power in this constitution to alter it without consulting the British Parliament, and he now told the hon member plainly that they would have the power, if they liked, to provide in this constitution for the appointment of the Governor General He gave that opinion deliberately Mr DOBSON Apart from the Queen The ATTORNEY GENERAL said no If the hon member got his mind clear he would see that they would have to send home to England for amendment of this constitu- tion for the consent of their own Crown, their own supreme executive head, and not to any legislature that happened to sit in London It was their own Executive hoad as much as it was the executive head of Engand Under this constitution the colonies would be not quite the same but nearly analogous to Hungary and Austria They were part of the same empire, under the one Crown, with one executive for both, but with distinctly separated Legislatures The only difference between the colonies and Hungary and Austria was that in regard to the colonies a Parliament sitting in another part of the Empire had the power to effect legislation on some matters for the whole of the Empire, while the Parliament of Hungary had the power to Icgia late only for that part of the Empire called Hungary, and the Parliament of Austria had power only to legislate for that portion called Austria The Parliament of the British Empire could legislate for any portion of the Empire The TREASURER Is there any Imperial Act under which the Governor is appointed The ATTORNEY GENERAL said there was no Act whatever The Queen was the one executive officer for the whole Empire The prerogative the Governor exercised here, the very prominent one of granting pardon to a criminal, was not given to him by any Act of Parliament of 'Tasmania or Great Britain, and he did not exercise it as any thing based on himself, he simply acted as the locum tenens of the Sovereign of Great Britain It was she who pardoned prisoner, even in the Hobart gaol and not Lord Gar manston, or any other Governor Mr DOBSON To come back to our clause, do you think the 1 federal Parliament can send home a clause saying that they can appoint their own Governor General, and take it out of the Queen's hands * The ATTORNEY GENERAL HOW confused the hon member is I distinctly said we have to send it to the Queen for her consent, if she likes Mr DOBSON Will she like The ATTORNEY GENERAL We are actually getting the power to amend the constitution, so that we shall hereafter elect our own Governor General has TREASURER Does an amendment of the constitution go as far as that' The ATTORNEY GENERAL Of course it does why not Mr DOBSON If the Queen assents to our appointing our own Governor General we will be a federation under the Crown no longer The ATTORNEY GENERAL said that dependencies of the British Empire had often governors elected by their own people, and were still colonies of the Crown The governor in those colonies was the representative of the Crown, and administered the prerogatives of the Cross is a lion the American Revolution broke out it was not in the States that elected their own governors that there was the most disloyal or rebellious spirit There was a greater spirit of rebellion in Virginia and Massachusetts where the Royal Governors were appointed by the Crown -und because they were so appointed they caused much greater friction-than there was in Maryland and Connecticut, life the governors were elected by the people Mr LEWIS What has the Governor General to do with your clause The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that Mr Dobson had pushed the Governor General into the question , he had not He was trying to explain that they could not make any alteration in the manner in which the Governor was appointed without going to the Imperial Parliament to get an act to enable them to do on , whereas in the larger constitution of the Commonwealth they were actually asking the power to amend it without the consent of the Imperial Parliament, and in doing that they had gone beyond Canada They were making a totally new departure They had gone beyond Canada still further in the very matter the hon. member had got on his brain. The British North American Act did not provide for the appointment of the Governor General at all It went on the same lines as our local constitution-it pro Burned that the Queen was present all over her Empire. She, of course could only be present in distant parts by her representa- it was Now he would come to that very clause 2, which provided that there should be a Governor General He wanted hon. members to force the position The TREASURER Clause 2 ought not to be there I The ATTORNEY-GENERAL It ought to be, it was there in 1891 Sir Samuel Griffith, Mr Kingston and himself knew what they were doing They went to work with their eyes open and be claimed part of the responsibility, or glory, or whatever they might call it They told the Convention what they were doing, and it agreed with them He had quoted Sir Samuel Griffiths words at the I convention and surely they did not shirk the question. They did not hold any thing back They faced the position, that they were going in for absolute legislative independence for Australia as far as it could possibly exist consistent with allegiance to the Crown, and else consistent with the power of the Imperial Parliament to legislate for the whole Empire when it chose Mr DOBSON Amareb towards repub localism The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said they could call it what they liked. The Conven- tion of 1891 was all for it If it was repub. localism, then Sir Samuel Griffith was a good republican, and he was as good a one as be. They had provided in this Act for a Governor General The TREASURER . Under our amended constitution, do you think we have the power to amend clause 2 as to the Governor General, without representations to the home Government The ATTORNEY - GENERAL . Why should not we have the power ' Why say we have power to amend that and not thereat' The British North America Act, clause 91 said, " The Executive Government for and over Canada is hereby declared to be vested in the Queen ' we went no further in 1891 The TREASURER You did not tell us all in 1891. The ATTORNEY GENERAL said he had told all What had he told them of Sir Samuel Griffith ' But perhaps the Treasurer was down in the refreshment room at that time (Laughter ) We had gone further, and it had a more practical bearing They said that the power was vested in the Queen, and should be exercised by the Governor General, or the Queen s representative They had provided that the executive power was vested in the Queen, and should be exercised by the Governor General The TREASURER But we have struck that out about the local Governor. The ATTORNEY - GENERAL His amendment intended to deal with that it stipulated that the power and the authority of the Executive Government of each State should be exercised by the Governor thereof. 1 He wished members to consider the British North America Act It omitted to provide that such power should be exercised in the, State What was the consequence? The question was raised as to whether the local Governor had power to exercise any prologue tive whatever, as it was said not to be vested in him Mr HENRY The Governor of Ontario I was appointed by the Imperial authorities The ATTORNEY GENERAL Itdulnot matter He represented the Q mon just the same The Lieutenant Governor of Canada represented the Queen directly in the same way as the Governor who used to be appointed That point had been raised before, and decided that it was an appointment by the Governor General in Canada was the same as an appointment by the Queen He directly represented the Sovereign The question was actually raised saying no provision had been made for him to exercise the pre- native in the State Sir Richard Webster used line Tory argument in an appeal from Canada before the Privy Council. It was argued that no provocation was given the Lieutenant Governor Hint contention was not upheld That was what was done by the Privy Council long before the question crept up in Ontario They were compelled to pass a local Act to authorise the Governor to remit fines and i exercise other prerogatives In the case to which he had referred the judge argued that under the British North American Act the Governor hold the power, but he admitted that it was a proper thing, in order to set doubts at rest, to pass a local Act They did not want to leave things in that in certain State, although it was admitted that in the case of Ontario it was a proper manner in which to set doubts at rest The clause 102 did no more than clause 55 in the British North American Act The prerogative of the Crown as left to the Queen in her original executive office, seemed to some to be not vested in the Governor at all But with our local Acts certain powers were given to the Governor and afterwards further power was vested in him But that was not a part of the original prerogative of the Crown, and the clause 102 would be held to simply transfer to the new Governors powers that had been directly, by legislation vested in the Governor as an officer They had the same case in the North American Act Hon members would see that he had taken the second part of his amendment first, for the reason that the subject had already come up at the Conven- tion of 1931, and had been discussed, and because it had been dealt with ho referred to it first The other part did not come up in 1891, nor in the Act of the present year Mr HENRY That was an unfortunate way to deal with them Members might agree with one half and not with the other The ATTORNEY GENERAL Hon members would do as they liked in that respect He knew his reasons for restoring the provisions of the bill of 1891, and he would show them how desirable it was they should have Mr LEWIS You quote clause 102, and are going to put in the first clause of your amendment The ATTORNEY GENERAL was in the hands of the committee Personally, he thought the clause should go in He thought some had members did not realise the position they had to face, or the position they were taking up if they expected to have the power to alter the appointment of out local Governor The TREASURER We do not want the power to appoint our local Governor, we struck it out. The ATTORNEY' GENERAL Why was it struck out s At Adelaide Mr Wise, who was a strong supporter of it, withdrew his support when he saw the compulsory nature of it The TREASURER The constitution of the Commonwealth has nothing to do with the States The ATTORNEY GENERAL That is your opinion, not mine The TREASURER We are making a constitution of the Commonwealth The ATTORNEY GENERAL To give some hon member really more credit for constitutional law than to talk like that The Treasurer was frightened in Sydney, and in 1891 he voted against it. He found that some men knew so little about federation that they supported his views Sir Samuel Griffith voted with him, Mr Kingston voted for him. Sir John Downer voted for him the Attorney General of Queensland voted for him, and others voted with him The TREASURE R I voted against it. The ATTORNEY GENERAL Yes, the Treasurer was one who was frightened at a ghost So far from wanting to get hon. members to vote for it by any sort of argument, he simply explained what he believed to be the position that they were in, that the proposed constitution was taking a new departure with regard to certain powers He asked them to agree to it and not make a provision for the Commonwealth they were not prepared to make for the constitution of the different States in order to avoid a dispute hereafter as to what powers were actually given, be proposed also to provide for the exercise of elective powers Of course he had already said that in Canada and in the Privy Council they did SO But Australia did not want to frame a constitution that was going to give an opportunity for able and elaborate argument before a Court some time afterwards They should do their best to exclude such opportunities, and when a clause was pointed out that absolutely pro ducoed a dispute of that kind they should try to avoid it He was going, therefore, to move the clause as it stood Mr DOBSON Your amendment as it stands' The ATTORNEY GENERAL Yes, theRE hon. members who wanted to leave things as they were could strike out the latter part Mr LEWIS thought that the keynote of the Attorney-General's remarks was to be found in the argument that the local Legislatures wore subordinate to the Federal Parlia- mont The ATTORNEY GENERAL No Mr LEWIS He used the words " inferior and subordinate Parliaments The AT TORN BY GENERAL had not meant'. subordinate ' but he had said they were inferior because they had a much more restricted jurisdiction and would have nothing like the power in the Empire that the Federal Parliament would Mr DOBSON They are both sovereign Mr LEWIS was very glad that the Attorney General had withdrawn the word subordinate ' He had used it several times and had tried to belittle as much as possible the States Legislatures" The Star s Legislatures were as sovereign and supreme as the Federal Legislature would be, and believing that so strongly himself be hoped that hon members would not yield to the eloquence of the Attorney General and put anything in the bill which would impair or mf rings upon their own constitution s rights (Hear, hear ) They had their own constitu- tions and means of dealing with them, and why should they put into the bill clauses that were intended to interfere with the constitution The ATTORNEY GENERAL I am not interfering with them Mr LEWIS said it did interfere with them if Ewers said that Parliament might make such provision as it thought fit for the government If they wished the States Governors to be appointed in any other way than by the Crown, they must approach the Crown and ask the Crown to abandon its prerogative The present clause was designed for a totally different object The first part of the clause required further thought and further consideration The matter was a very important one and be hoped hon members would not arrive at a decision upon it hastily He might inform them that the reasons he had attempted to give were those which he believed swayed the majority at the Adelaide Convention and which induced them to leave that clause out They felt-at any rate the Constitutional Committee felt that it was not a right thing in a measure of that description to interfere with the rights of the various States in deal- ing with their own constitutions (Hear, hear ) If the Attorney General referred to the Hansard he would see the main of this clause was left out by the Constitutional Committee The ATTORNEY GENERAL Dr Cockburn moved it afterwards in committee, I said so Mr LEWIS said no members were expected to get upon every occasion and give their personal views, if they felt strongly-and the Constitutional Committee, as a whole did feel strongly ther this should not be left in the Federal Constitution It was left out after a very short discussion He hoped that the clause would not be proceeded with that evening, as many of the members were fired by travel The ATTORNEY GENERAL was only too willing to let the matter stand over, but he must protest again against what Mr Lewis had said He thought the support of men like Sir Samuel Griffith and others was sufficient to show that this was no attempt whatever of interfering with the local constitutions of the States it was recognising their independence and securing their in dependence But they had not the power with regard to the Governor that the Imperial Parliament had Mr HENRY If we agree amongst our selves we can always got that The ATTORNEY GENERAL said they were now creating the constitution of the Commonwealth with powerful the Commonwealth to alter the constitution without going to the Imperial Parliament Sir Samuel Griffith himself had proposed to place the local constitutions in a similar position subject to the Queen H approval, without going to the Imperial Parliament Mon members wore seeing ghosts in this matter If the people of any particular colony 10, 20, or 28 years after the Commonwealth was established found there was a necessity to alter the appointment of Governors they would get it done whether that claim was put in for not (Hear, hear ). If that clause were put in the bill and the present system were found to work best it would be left alone. Mr NICHOLAS BROWN Then what is the necessity for it Mr BIRDaskodif the people had not got the power to alter the constitution The ATTORNEY-GENERAL: To. Mr. BIRD: Then this alter the constitution. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL : It Urn hon. member sees it in that light, it is only a matter of words. At this stage progress was reported, and leave given to sit again next day. ADJOURNMENT. At 10.15 p.m. the House adjourned till 4 p.m. next day
