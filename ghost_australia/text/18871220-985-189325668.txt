Keep Out of the Past. Keep out of the past! for its highways Are damp with malarial glootn. Its gardens are sere, Mid its forests are drear. And everywhere moulders a tomb. TVno seeks to regain its lost pleasures Finds only a rose turned to dust, And its storehouse of wonderful treasures Is covered and coated with rust. Keep out of the past; it is haunted. He who in its avenue gropes Shall find there the ghost of a joy prized the most, And a skeleton throng of dead hopes. In place of its beautiful rivers Lie pools that are stagnant with slime, And those graves gleaming bright in the phosphorus light Cover dreams that were slain in their prime. Keep out of the past! it is lonely And barren and bleak to the view, Its fires have grown cold and its stories are old, Turn, turn to the present, the new! To-day leads you up to the Hill-tops, That are kissed by the radiant sun ; To-day shows no tombâ€”all life's hope in bloom And to-day holds a prize to be won. E. L. Wilcox, in Chicago Times.
