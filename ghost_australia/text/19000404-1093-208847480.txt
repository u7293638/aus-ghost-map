THE ISTBTAiST FAMINE. Perhaps it is foolish to bonder When pity is nipped in.the bud. Your ears hare 'been deafened with thun der, ? ? . Your eyes have been blinded with Wood !Bnt if, through a'lull in the battling, You listen-ah, listen again; Out-ioared by the voice of the Gatling, They cry! Are .'they crying in vain? Oh, Britain! On lowering pinions A fiend from the nethermost hell. - Is scourging your fairest dominions, Is scouring through city and dell. Look up from the spoils you examine, The laurel you flaunt in your hand! Awaken! The famin^!. The famine Is eating the heart of the land! 2vo trumpets .and bugles are wailing The fate of the slain, of the slain; JNo streamers and ribbons are trailing; 2so tenderness softens the pain. iAnd yet, in rough the hills and the valleys Red murder is leading the fray; In silence King Death and his allies f- Are holding carousal to-day. Greyhued, with their burning eyes sunken* Deep into the famishing flesh, Foam-lipped and despairing and shrunken They clamor, and clamor afresh. IA11 army of shuddering spectres, A horde from the realms of the dead: Row help us, white sahib, protector! . Now barter your cannon for 'bread! They file in an endless procession, Like ghosts of some terrible trance, Some dream of demoniac c/bsession. . Room, l'oom, for the skeleton dance! Ten millions-and fifteen-and twenty ** * * * * n 'Ah, you chat have'money for lead, God knows, you can spare from your ? plenty' lA nennv. oiie nennv-for bread! -WVon Kofcze. Queensland, March 22.
