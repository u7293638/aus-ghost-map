THE EDGE OF THE EAST By RUDYARD KIPLING. PART I, The mist was clearing off Yokohama hair hour and a hundred junks had their sails hoisted for the morning breeze so that the M tied horizon was stippled 1 with square blues of Bihar An 3 English man of war showed blue white on the lines so new was the day light and all the way the lay out as smooth as the inside of an oyster shell Two children in blue and white their tanned limbs pink in the fresh air senile I a marvellous boat of lemon hard wood and that was our fairy craft to the shore across the stillness and the mother of pearl levels there are ways and ways of entering Japan The best is to descend upon it from America and the Pacific from the bar banana and the deep sea Coming from the East the blaze of India and the insolent tropical vegetation of Singapore dull the eye to halt colours and little terms It is at Bom in that the Smell of All Asia boards the ship miles off shore and holds the passengers nose till he is clear of Asm again That is a violent an aggressive smell apt to prejudice the stranger but kin none the less to the gentle and insinuating flavour that stole across the light airs of the day break when the ferry bout went to showers smell of very clean new wood split bamboos Woodsmoke dampness and the things that people who are not white people cat-a homelike and comforting smell Then follows 1 on shore the sound of an Eastern tongue that is beautiful or not as you happen to know of the Western races have many languishes but a crowd of 11 Europeans heard through closed doors tall with the Western pitch and cadence so it is with the 1 nst A line of Gcuncl shaw cools s sat in the sun discoursing to each other and it was as though they were welcoming a return in speech that the listener must Know as well is 3 nglish They talked and they talked but the ghosts of Iminbar words would not "row any clearer till presently the Smell came down the open streets again saying that this was the last where nothing matters and trifles old as the low-cut Baker mattered less than nothing and that there were old acquaintances waiting at every corner beyond the township Great is the smell of the last I Railways telegraphs docks and gunboats cannot banish it and it will endure till the railways are dead He who has not smelt that smell has not lived three years ago I of Rohanna was sufficiently 1 Europeanised in its shops to suit the waist

apple green silk, under the other We being wise, sit in a garden that is not ours, but belongs to a gentleman in white coloured silk, who, solely for the sake of the picture, condescends to work as a gardener, in which employ he is sweeping delicately a well of fallen cherry blossoms from under an azalea aching to burst into bloom steep stone steps, of the colour that nature ripens through long winters, lend up to this garden by way of clumps of bamboo grass You see the Smell was right when it talked of meeting old friends Half-a-dozen blue black pines are standing akimbo against a real sky not a fog blur nor a cloud banK, nor a grey dish clout wrapped round the sun but a blue sky A cherry tree on a slope below them throws up a hive of blossom that breaks all creamy-white against their feet, and a clump of willow trail their palest green shoots in front of all The sun sends for an ambassador through the azalea bushes a lordly swallow tailed bitterly and his squire very like the Hitting " chill le blue of the English downs The warmth of the Post, that goes through, not over, the lazy body, is added to the light of the last-the splendid lavish light that clears but does not bewilder the eye Then the new leaves of the spring work like fat emeralds and the loaded branches of cherry bloom grow transparent and glow as it hand glows held up against flame Little, warm sighs come up from the moist warm earth, and the fallen petals son on the ground turnover, and go to sleep again Outside, beyond the lounge, where the sunlight lies on the slate coloured roofs, the added. nee fields beyond the roofs, and the hills beyond the rice fields, is all laun- only all Japan, and this that they call the old French Legation is the Garden of Eden that most naturally dropped down

the garden stands Any other curve of the caves would not have consul ted with the sweep of the pine branches , therefore this cane was made, and being made was perfect The congregation of the globe trotters are in the hotel, sculling for guides, in order that they may be shown the sights of Japan, which is all one sight They must go to 1 okio, they must go to Nikko, they must surely see all that is to be seen, and then write home to their barbarian families that they are getting used to the sight of bare brown legs Before this day is endi d they will all, thank good ness, have splitting headaches and burnt out eyes It is better to he still and hear the grass grow-to soak in the heat and the smell and the sounds and the sights that come in asked Our garden overhangs the harbour, and by pushing aside one branch we look down upon a heavy started fishing boat, the straw gold mats of the deck house pushed back to show the perfect order and propriety of the housekeeping that is going forward The father fishes, sitting frog fashion, is poking in a tiny box full of charcoal, and the light white ash is blown back into the face of a largish Japanese doll, price 2s 3d m lay a water The doll wakes, turns into a Japanese baby something more valuable than money could buy a baby with a shaven head and unless legs It crawls to the thing in the polished brown box, is picked up just as it is ready to cut live coals, and set down behind a thwart, where it drums upon a bucket, addressing the firebox from afar Half a dozen cherry blossoms hide off a bough and water down to the water close to the Japanese doll, who in another minute will be over side in pursuit of these miracles The father fisher has it by the pink hind leg, and this time it is tucked away, all but the topknot out of
