ELECTOBB BEWABE! (7o the Editor of (he Examiner and Titnu. Sib,—I do not often worry myself very much about election contests, but the doubtful ex pedients tbat are being resorted to to. catch votes lor one of the candidates in the Conning ham |contest prove to me pretty clearly that, unless the electors mind what they are about, our best interests will be sacrificed. I litre it on very good authority that Mr. Allan's toots are flying about Killamev, broadly hinting that if Mr. Allan is returned ne Till have a survey made to bring the via recta over the , range at the head of the CondUnine, and thence direct to Dalveen, leaving Warwick entirely out in the cold. Similarly, the Emu Vale people are being told {that Mr. Allan will have a survey made by way of the head of Emu Cn-rk, which would rob Freestone Creek, Glad/if and Campbell's Plain people of the benefit they would derive if the line were carried out as at present projected by Cunningham's Gap. Mr. Allan may be able to get all these survey* made, but if they are made it will delay the work for another five years at least. This is perhaps what he would like to see; at any rate he must know perfectly well that then is not the ghost of a chance of our setting the line from M'llwraith, Morehead, ana do., with whom he will sit and vote jf U gtU i». I strongly urge every man in Freestone Greek, in Oladfield, in Allora, or in Warwick, who has a vote for Cunningham to record it in favor ot Mr. Eates, who has proved true to our in terests.
