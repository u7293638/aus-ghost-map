The other day I ? called at the Emigration Offices arid found ; 'a i stout,' well; built 'nian/'ap parently in comfortable circumstances, and who' seemed' to' me the very type, of a .desirable emigrant, talking to Mr. Buckler. I ascertained that he was one of a party of about 30 'who had been sent but inl June last, ' ihaving1 between them' capital amounting |to ab'outJB30,000, and being, Mr.- Buckler jassured me, in every respect an exception 'ally eligible party of emigrants.

I , ' . ... WOBKING i-BOM WITHIN. .' , ? On, t}ie,,14th December a meeting was hold at the Mansion House with the object, pf promoting a scheme for the establish inent of a centre of educatien and recreatipn , for the people of the. East End of Londbn.. The effect which the, work of the School Board has already, had in inducing, efforts after decency in home and habits, in many, whom custom had adapted to a sluggish, toleration of their former foul surround-, ings, has been sufficient to show that the inotive power from within maybe made a more -ppwerful agent than any other, in reforming the worst characteristics of our London slums. The meeting^ referred to was .one outcome of the appreciation of this fact, to which appreciation Professor Huxley jjave expression, when he said, ' Improve them from the inside ; give them a higher sense iof dignity, and they will improve pheir houses of their own accord.' Nor did he, speak as. a mere theorist, for he spoke put of a practical experience of the wants of the East End gained while practising as a medical man. Sir E. Currie, also speak ing from a long experience, said, 'The great want in the ea3t of . London was' some : place where pecple might gp f pr.edugation and recreation!' To supply this want.it .w,a's ?, proposed to- utilise the Beaumont Trust,a_sum of ^812^000 left by Mr. J.,-. Beaumont, a' gentleman who Jiyed in the EastEnd. Thetrustees of .the. Trust were, prepared to give , ^65000 out of the .£12,006 ^for the,, erection of an institur tibn to include a hall for lectures, a library, and.reading-room and a winter garden, to be open all,, the year round, and to spend the.balance in maintaining the institution, should sufficient help be forthcoming to enr able them to carry out the soheme. That it, will be forthcoining there is little doubt, and this scheme may be welcomed as a practical answer on one phase of 'The bitter cry of Outcast London.' To the possible objection that these fpr whom the advantages of the institution are intended will not be likely to avail themselves of them, Mr. Groschen, M.P., was able, as Chairman ef the Lendpn Spciety for the Extension pf University Teaching, te answer that experience had shown that there were audiences ampngst the artizan classes in the East End whp wpuld hang on the lips of the most distinguished prp fessors, and he also testified from personal observation to the eagerness with which rational forms of amusement were sought when , offered,' as alternatives- to. the gin palace. , Other speakers, including the Lord.
