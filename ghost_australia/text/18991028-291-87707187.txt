(Smtbag gUabmg. TRUTH'S TRIUMPH. (By Philip Wendell Crannell.) 'Magna est veritas est prevalebifr— Greai Is truth and will prevail!' Thus lightlj saith The student in his cloister, and his faitl Is shared by millions in the mart or State Content at ease Truth's triumph to await Won without hands by her own God like strength, Her leap from mind to mind, until a! length, All realms subdued, they hail her victory though late! Not in such wise doth victress Truth pre vail— A ghost, unbodied, powerless, and pale, Till, born in some great heart a scorn of wrong, A passionate desire, a purpose strong, Through tears and sweat and hunger, pain and lose, Seourgings and death, she conquers— by a Cross!
