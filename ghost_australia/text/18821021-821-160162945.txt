VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. Second Day. [By Telegraph.1 [From oar own Reporter.] Melbourne, October 15. A light rain fell on Saturday morning and continued up to 12 o'clock, when the clouds cleared off and the sun shone, and ultimately for the rest of the day the different roads to Caulfield were lined with traps up to the hour of starting the first race. At the time the Cup was run there must have been 8,00® persons present, which is far the largest attendance ever known on this course. The rain served to lay the dust on the round, but after the first race the running ground was very much cut up, and in the Cup the horses were lost in a cloud of dust from the. time they passed the Stand until they got to the top of the hill. The racing throughout the day was first class, but'it was a disastrous afternoon for backers, as Little Jack was not mentioned until late on Friday night; and as the stable did not touch him on the course, he was driven back to 100 to 6, and the public little thought that he was to figure in the light of a winner. The Assyrian's running was too bad to be correct. He was uiilucky in getting. a bad position at the start, and after passing the Stand with about twenty horses in front of him he never seemed to be able to get through the crowd. Sportsman was made favourite in a field of fourteen for the Hurdle Race, but there was . a strong following behind Lord of Clyde,'-and he went to the front and stayed there to the end. Eighteen runners were telegraphed for the' Nursery Handicap, and Mr. Saviii supplied- a favourite in Delusion. The Caulfield filly. Duenna, a very nice yonngster, was a!so:at 100 to G, and the pair fought it out from start to finish. It was one of the best- ridden races I have ever seen, and Yeomans just nicked a verdict bya head in the last naif dozen strides. With this evidence of the stable being in form the Assyrian shortened to 4 to 1 when the ring was formed to the Cup. Little Jack after having touched 10 to 1 in the morning was driven to a 100 to 6; hut there were some very heavy outlays on Verdure and Fryiugpau, both of whom touched 6 to 1 before the start. The lot were saddled and paraded the pad dock some time before the start, and nothing looked better than Darcbin, Commotion, Assyrian, Verdure, Fryingpan, and Gipsy Cooper. Neither of the St. Albans pair came in for much attention, consequent upon the report that the stable believed Mistaken to be the better of the pair. The preliminaries took some time, but Mr. Watson had the thirty-two marshalled at the post in good time, and it was a splendid sight to see the lot spread out at the top of the straight running. Fryingpan, who was in a very bad temper, broke away several times,. and de layed the start a few minutes, but eventually they were sent on their jour ney on very fair terms. Dougalstoi, appeared to be the first to move, butasthejr uame to the Stand Verdure was clear of everything, and was making the pace a cracker: while Darebin, Fryingjjan, Calma, Tumult, Dougal-, ston and Flying jib were in good places. After rounding the turn Tumult made an effort to cut down the flying grey, hut she shook him off with great ease, and continued to lead from Calma, Flying Jib, Darebin, and Fryingpan. At tho-five-furlong post Calma was trying his best to lead Verdure and Darebin, who had been galloped on and badly cut, and had given way to Flying Jiband Fryingpan. These four were at the head of affairs od entering the straight, and as Verdure was in iront when they became fairly in a line for home her name was sounded on all Bides as the winner, but at the distance Little Jack got clear of the crowd, and came with a wet sail. The boy on Verdure was watching Calma on the whip hand, and not seeing Little Jack, he left his position on the rails and gave the latter a chance, which Moore im mediately availed hunself of, and dash ing up on the inside he caught the mare, and won amid tremendous excite ment bv half a length. Had Sheehan not made the mistake mentioned Little Jack might not have won, as there was no room for him to get past on the outside at the time he made hiB run. Calma, Fryingpan, and Baron Von Mueller were just at the heels of Gipsy Cooper, and then came Gudarz, Coor cena, and Prattle. The favourite, after getting off badly and being knocked ont of his stride in a collision, never seemed to get going, and he was not in the hunt at any part .of the race. The victory was very quietly received, and the St. Albans party are reported to have won only a trifling stake on the race. Had Verdure won the ring would have lost heavily, but as it was they won to a man, and taken all through the meeting has been a bad one for backers. As a race the Findon Harriers' Cup was a farce. Of the twenty four starters all were out of it but four when half a mile had been traversed, and the Melbourne amateur riders are, with a few exceptions, quite out of place in a steeplechase. The Open Steeplechase was a grand race. Napoleon, the favourite, refused repeatedly; but a party of six or eight were in close company, and lamped grandly, to the finish. Erin looked like winning after they got over the last fence, but he and Colling wood tired to nothing at the finish,and Sailor, who was very badly ridden by a mere lad, come in the last hundred yards, and won easily by a length. When the betting opened on the Windsor Handicap. 3 to 1'wob offered on the 'field, but. directly a move, was made on Prometheus the ring drew in their horns, and it was difficult to get 5 to 4 at the finish. Saionara, Trevellyan, and Gasalier were all supported, but they had no chance with the brilliant son of Lurnne, who jumped away in front and .was never caught. . The following are the results...
