HEART'S-EASE. ~aeis a feowar I cought for ye??r, crt'e-eaee and rest from csae, Flr osy heart was erushed by pain and tents, Anod the world was lone and bire. FP?r from the msdding crowdrI went, I iought the flower alone, But utillmy heart with wee wasb iod still my soul made moan. I ought the fight, I longedto ti, I charged mid shot and shell, Death like a rwhite mist passed mra by, Where others dying fell. I railed pon the lonely sea, I trod a foreign shore, But the ghost of sorrow folowetd ra. For aver, ever more. One day I met a little child, Sweet as a bud clfMy, - he bars a wreath of foworee wild, I !ollo~ed in hdr way. She came onto a dim green plaes, nelt tby gra~ve in prayer, when passed, with teas upon ly fa.s, And left the fiowereto there. O,notin vain! O, not in rvair, My quest by sea and schore, Best, rest, thou troubled ghost of psI'n, Ver thou my Easoulno more I knelt anon the blessed cod, I wept an earnest p-'?yer, I found the fower, the peace of God. . Heart's-ease and rest from care. -PDr FaHSaOcX E. V1Pz51EZ3LY. .ri- 5''
