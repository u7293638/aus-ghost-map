UNIVERSITY EXAMINATIONS FOR WOMEN. BY ISABELLA M. S. Tones Wura the history of education comes to be eminent it will he, like many) other Justices, in great part a record of compromises In nothing is this more true than in regard to the important system of university examinations for persons who have not studied in the colleges of these universities, or in any way under, their sanction or guidance This system is of very went growth and is anything but symmetrical. The various universities have been led to adopt such, plans at different times, with different nuns and arrangements , nevertheless, a certain resemblance pert rides them throughout ANhen the older universities first arose, no one but hot ed that all human minds were worth cultivating; no one thought that intellectual training responded to a common need no one supposed that the ordinary work of life would be done the better for it For centimes the instruction given in the universities suited no career but such as had been originally included within the comprehensive sweep of possibilities open to Churchmen C consequently the subjects and modes of stud), and all arrangements, connected with them, presented, up to very recent times, no aspect of exclusiveness, well fitted to confirm the idea til it education-be) on the mere rudi- ments of knowledge-was a quite unnecessary luxury), which might he sought for ulterior ends, but which it could never be a duty either to attain for one's self or provide for others The some agitation and discussion which led to considerable changes within the old universities, led also to the establishment of new universities within the empire of these, the Queen's University) in Ireland bears some resemblance to the Scotch diversities which had in vi a) s been freer than the English, differing from them, however, not only in the peculiar distribution of its colleges, but also in its strict neutrality in religious matters, and in its more modern arrangements in various respects the, London University, however-a university without colleges-a body which proposed to guide without providing teaching-a body whose examinations were its sole means of doing its work introduced a perfectly new idea into the educational world. It is not difficult to see that the establishment and success of such a body, just at the time when public interest in education was being strongly aroused, irresistibly) suggested a new motive power to he brought to bear upon large sections of the population hitherto quite removed from any help in this direction. The abuses prêt ment in many of the endowed schools were among the first matters connected with education which attracted much attention Iaultsof a different character, but no less serious, were alleged regarding many private schools for boys Public opinion being directed towards them, and the necessity for reform being acknowledged by the most enlightened teachers, many changes began to be introduced in subjects, modes of teaching, 1c In the meantime the growth of the system of examinations suggested the possibility of ascertaining the wisdom of these experiments b) actual results, and of stimulating other teachers to take similar decisive steps It was under these circumstances that the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, in 1858, instituted their middle class local examinations for boys. Their success was immediate and marked, and though they deal only with individual boats, and not with schools as such there can be no question but that the work of the schools sending up candidates to them has been in no small degree approved, enlarged, and animated ht them If boys schools so greatly) needed an external guide and test it this ten evident that girls schools needed it still more However well educated individuals might be, it was too certain that the great majority of women of the middle and upper middle classes were provided with only the very slenderest assistance in developing their mental resources No doubt, vigorous efforts were being made by some heads of schools to introduce order and dignity, breadth and energy into the studies of girls Act the difficulties to be contended against were so great that it was not to be expected that such efforts would become general until some recognised authority should place before parents, and the public generally, some rule to indicate what subjects should be taught, and how they should be taught the University of Cambridge deserves the lasting gratitude of all women for being the first to perceive that in its new machinery of local examinations it had the means of assisting the education of girls, and for being willing to use those means After a voluntary experiment, with the same papers used in bias, made by some friends of the cause, the subject was brought before the syndicate and in 1865 then granted that where the local examinations for boys were being held, similar examinations for girls might be held, pro aided a sufficient number of candidates presented the mach The 6ub»ectswere to be the same in both cases, the rules the same, and the ages the same namely, under sixteen for the junior, and under eighteen for the senior candidates The results were eminently lat ourable A very) considerable numbers of girls came forward to these new examinations, which were held at several different duties, chiefly in the north of England. The sale is from a high those candidates came, immediately showed the benefit of the necessary) preparation In the words of the North of England Council of Education, they have proved of the greatest advantage in stimulating and steadying the work in girls schools The Universities of Edinburgh and Durham were the next to admit girls to the local examinations which they had already established But the second and still more important step in this great movement was taken almost s multaneously) by London and Cambridge A memorial was presented to the sonata of the latter in 1868 from the north of England Council of Education supported by the signatures of a large number of ladies, both professionally and non professional!) interested, requesting them to institute examinations for women above the highest age allowed by the scheme for girls They felt that the fixing of so early an age, with no provision for testing continued progress beyond it, involved the loss of the most valuable part of the services which the examinations could render to the cause of education The senate, after careful consideration, granted the prn) er of the memorial, and in July, 1869, the first examinations for women were held that they also were successful, in the truest sense, I need hardly say, though the want of satisfactory means of preparation was, of course, more evident here than in the case of girls, who had mostly come from schools already adapting themselves to the current of thought in this matter. The plans are, to a great extent, an amplification of those for girls In both cases there is an elementary and compulsory group of subjects, and a number of other groups, from among which the optional subjects may be chosen. In the case of women, the compulsory group-which consists of religious knowledge, arithmetic, English history, and geography as connected with it, English language and literature and composition-mat be taken either at the same time as the more advanced, subjects, or in a subsequent year, in which case the value of the marks gained in that group is added to those games afterwards In order to obtain a certificate of having passed one optional subjects least must be taken, Jam the r range of choice is very wide The London University scheme is much more elaborate, corresponding to the severer character of the qualifications it exacts four men It attempts no junior examination at 11 Those coming forward to its first or " general ex- men men must he at least seventeen years of age, but there is no limit above that age The subjects which they must take in order to pass are fixed and are swallows -Latin, two other languages of which one must be modern English (including his tory and geography)), mathematics, natural philosophy and either chemistry of botany Die candidate in- it win honours if she until a satisfactory position in all of these, but not to special success in me Holders of pass certificate may in ant future tear present themselves to the ' high examination I can then subjects are then offered, in and one or more of which they and) 2 examined, and out in certificates of higher pro scene), and they m ii take my number of these subjects one after another in subsequent years. This plan differs ten decidedly) fiona that of Cambridge in fixing a definite course of leading subjects besides those which are elementary, for every one who tries to win her pass certificate, and in refusing to examine in an) che sen 01 specific subject anyone who has not first passed the general examination I he total amount of . knowledge required is also Tcr2t much larger and more varied j 'This year the two lush universities, which had not previously) extended then loe ii examinations to give have instituted them for both girls and women. The first of those established by the University ° Dublin were held in April, 1879, for Juniors beat' eighteen years of age, and foremost above it I" arrangements are similar to those of Cambridge ' group of elementary subjects, which is computed! and a wide range of other subjects one of which least must be taken in order to pass.

On the other hand, the clearly defined course and high standard of the London examinations show, with unmistakable and authoritative emphasis, what kind of education can alone be henceforth considered satisfactory) for women of the influential el isses i he distinctness with which the path is marked out difficult though it may be has already recommended it to the acceptance of the heads of many of the best schools for girls These examinations are an educational compromise Tliet test teaching, and therefore are a valuable to the teacher , the) stimulate stud), and therefore are Valuable to the taught the) place before the public in detail in many different localities, and influences which might present the spontaneous for Hiafion of a favourable atmosphere-the matured opinions of the best and most experienced authorities on education and therefore are a valuable to the whole community), students, teachers, parents, and society at large It is true that a scheme which would provide calling itself of the highest order, would be better Bull, but it five waited for such an event it would never come It is by doing the best we can, with the machinery we possess, that we may hope to evolve organisations more nearly corresponding to our ideal It is, however, significant that, in the majority of cases, the wish for these examinations has originated among those who were already engaged in trying to bring a higher order of teaching within the reach of girls than they had had before Indeed, one great result of the extended use of these examinations will certainly be to show that collegiate training, or something as nearly as pas Bible corresponding to it, must be provided for girls an all the great centres of the country the Schools have already done something to meet the new order of things, and will do more, but the more effectual]) their work is done just the more clearly Will it be seen that the same person or body cannot carry on the ordinary work of good teaching, for average girls of from two the to sixteen or seventeen years of age, and also the kind of teaching needful for studious women of from sixteen to twenty-five This, of course, is quite irrespective e of the adv all- ages which such students would gain from associa lion with each other, and the help which they would send in each other sympathy and heightened. interest This kind of help is not to be had in any other way, and IB, of all aids the one girls need most has, however, to the authority of the universities, was expressed in the first instance through their examinations, that we look to convince society of the great necessity of collegiate teaching in the meantime it would be difficult to exaggerate the good effect they have already produced Of course no one supposes them to be perfect , but faults of detail will Î)C detected and rectified in working There is room TO connection with them for schools, colleges, most lines, associations of all kinds, to try the mysterious plans, and from the collision of all these to strike out sparks of intellectual light which may be fanned into a steady Haine But now, at once, the fact of the relations formed by them, in each locality, between the most diverse and scattered educational agencies and the universities, secures a unity of aim amid this diversity, and a sense of the importance of the work, which never before existed It is a perpetual reminder to parents that the standard of education is being rapidly raised, and suggests do girls also a wholesome object of ambition. The course of study required, and the mental and social characteristics of the majority of the students, will presently) be recognised as having so obvious a superiority over the old type, as to exercise a deSirable sort of moral compulsion, and draw all girls of the cultivated classes within their range The more commonly) this is the case, the greater w di the usefulness of the examinations be, for there are disadvantages connected with new experiments, which disappear with their novelty Non- essential cream "stains are often unjust!) allowed to colour the opinions of persons respecting new and important schemes of this sort Ike full sympathy of the public will only be given to the system by degrees, Just as they become so common that no sense of strangeness presses upon the young student who is preparing for the examinations, and no dread of un- welcome singularity), or suspicion of eccentricity, vaunts the w inner of honours Every day brings this desirable and reasonable state of things nearer, and every examination held brushes away ghost of old world cobwebs, and lets the delight of practical wisdom shine into corners not reached before Examinations are not means of educating, but they Me means of testing education and their immediate effect has now a) s been to change the aspect of the schools of the district It was not merely that, for want of a guide, they had wandered far from the path but that they had gone to sleep altogether No one outside seemed to care what was being done there, and girls found no interest taken at home in weirs adie, so it was no wonder they took none what could a schoolmistress do > Herself no better armed than the rest, she had no power to make a change, so." accomplishments ' were pressed forward more and more, to fill up the huge hiatus in teaching, jNJu hide the unfathomable ignorance" boland -ino agitation, of which University) examinations were PLC that, shook the schoolmistress from their slumber , but it needed the authority expressed by one examinations themselves to show the gravity of J f'»ation to parents and society) The awakening Li roe Ultc,r<:^ is to girls str dies on the part of one of IS t"0;»»11«'T al of a tv eight and restraint upon the natural thirst for knowledge, and a stimulus M once the most powerful and the safest that could -I, wished there " now therefore a chance for -a education which is worth the name. Dr. Arnold says -"the difference between a useful education and one which does not affect the future life, res > mainly on the greater or less activity which it his communicated to the pupil a maid ,

strict, one might almost say is rendered possible, only by activity of mind in all who influence the student to ir inst this is the first and out of the most important services in which the examinations have done and art dung and they are the only available means by which it could be done at present for the community at large It must be remembered, when considering what good is effected by this system that it is by no means confined to the actual candidates Every girl in a school in which candidates are prepared is benefited by the high standard set up, and the elevation of view, the regular int) and animation, which must more or less characterise the school work Even smaller or lower schools, which send up no candidates, are raised in tone by the improved sentiment around them This sort of indirect influence is certain to increase When it becomes known that a school is Biittessiul in preparing candidates, it will become more popular, and therefore larger and size is an important element of usefulness Other things being equal, a large school is always a better instrument of instruction than a small one-better classified, better taught, with more scope for action, more dignity, more life lins indirect influence is, indeed, that by which tlusmovimtnt can best direct younger girls, for the only real objection to examinations is that they are sometimes rather too great a trial to young girls It is better that their knowledge should be tested in a simpler w as, before they come forward to the open examination and I am inclined to think that it is no disadvantage in the plans of London and of the Irish universities, that neither of them have junior examinations for girls As regards elder girls and women, there can be no doubt that neither in health, nor spirits, nor in any other way, are they injured by the efforts requisite to meet the examinations The L endowed school Commissioners state in their report ' A preponderating number of authorities have testified that, judiciously applied, the system of examinations, which necessarily involves emulation more or less, has been found in experience to be entirely harmless and if it is so, it is needless to say that its effects in stimulating the mind must be powerful in the one sex as it is in the other University) examinations are in their essential nature of a very broad and liberal character They can adopt no special aims, and admit of no extensive nesS, either of class or sect For this reason, no less than from their connection with the highest centres of intellect, they possess a dignity and authority which has never before attached to any plans for the education of women We are thus justified in looking forward with the utmost confidence and hope to the results
