' . -. - " ? The young marquis conducted his gueBt, Mr. Tempest, arid thc detective, "Mr. Bisset,' to the library. Here his lordship, at Bisset's request, recapitulated the story of Lady Chetwynd's spectre and the facts connected with its repeated appearances, submitting to be cross-examined even to tbe miautest de tails. The dandy-like officer dropped bis little affectations of eye-glass and drawl, and listened with a keen interest, and ex hibited : a cool, calm Judgment, a clear per ception, and an acuteness and shrewdness that caused Lord Chetwynd to revoke his earlier opinion "of him," and to respect and have fa* th in him. "I am to pass as your guest, my lord, equally with your: actual guest; Ur. Tem pest," said the officer, -when Chetwynd bai given all the information in his power. wHow many people in your bouse, my lord, know me in my true character?" . "Only Miss Monk, Mr. Monk, Mr. Tera E"est, and myself," was tho response^ The ouspkeeper, butler and under tarrants, pf course, are In ignorance of your business here, of your name, even. They. have been 'told that I expect a guest." j ."Yet 1 wish that .even Miss Monk and ;Mr. Monk knew me only as your guest," said the officer. " Men of my profession like to work in secret. - : Most ladies have a maid or confidential attendant to'wlibu they impart a good share of their secrets, -and these maids aro- sieves, for tho most' part.

Aa Bernice was safe in the hands of his. allies, and not w«il enough to be remo ped to Mawr Castle, be could afford to wait a week before going on to see ber. He felt it necessary to communicate with Flack and Mrs. Growl immediately, andas secretly as possible. Accordingly, directly after luncheon, he went to bis own room to write a letter to his confederates. ; Bisset excused himsuif, and wandered away by himself. Lord Chetwynd ordered ont a pilr of thoroughbreds, and with Tempest went out for a swift gallop through the park and over the estate. Some two hours afterward Chetwynd and Tempest rode slowly through the Tillage of Chetwynd-by-Sea, and ascended tbe hill that lcd to the park. In advance of them a slender, gentlemanly figure was walking slowly, twirling in one gloved hand s small erne, or walking-stick, and smoking a cigar. " It is Mï. Bisset," said Tempest, " He's been down to the village." " What caa be hope to discover by a visit at the village inn?" said Chetwynd. "He knows h¡B own business, I suppose, how ever. I fancy (bat foppishness of bis is a mask he likes to wear because his real nature, which be hides beneath it, is so different." : At this moment Bisset, who was still in advance of the riders, paused at the small lower gate of tbe park, and looked in. Gil bert Monk was in the very act of opeuing tho 'gâté, having a letter in his band, which he was conveying to Chetwynd himself, instead'of intrusting it, as was customary, to the butler and the post bag. ;. i Bisset stepped back, raisisg his hat to Monk, wbo thrust his letter in his pocket and came ont, securing tbe'' gate ' behind him. ' : .. . , . At thia juncture' Lord Chetwynd and Mr, Tempest came up, and reined, in their horse«. : "I see , that you have been - over to Chetwynd,' Mr. Bisset," said the marquis. ?' I fear I did not make it plain to you that the mystery of the spectre is known to but a very few.'and no one outside the Park, ex cepting Doctor Hartright, of Eastbourne, the Chetwynd rector, and my bailiff. ' You won't get any light upon the matter'in the village." . ' : '-'.'.?'' i ' i " I beg leave to differ with* your lord, ship," said Bisset; respectfully.. ; "I have obtained light upon the mystery even in the village." - 'Tho throe gentlemen uttered exclamation! of surprise. "I'm' afraid you've permitted yourself to be imposed upon, sir," " said Monk, with' a sneer. " You would do better to concentrate your attentions upon the house maids.":. ' * .'. ' . ' Mr. Bisset did not deign to reply;' Ho raised his hat, and moving aside out of Monk's path, passed' on. - Monk-went hiB way toward the village; and Chetwynd 'and1' Tempest canterod .on toward tho1 Pork.' ? '?.'??.? ^--.i"'- ?/ : There waa. a Btrango Bmile on the-Dun dreary face of the? detective officer aa'he daintily picked his - way,' and- proceeded slowly in the direction the marquis and'the explorer had gone, :í c ' '', " '!
