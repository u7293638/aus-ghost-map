KINGSTON. (from our own correspondent.) i March 31,1877. On Thursday last the inhabitants of Kingston were called to enjoy a treat such as they seldom have in the shape of an entertainment given by several local residents. The programme presented came off favourably. The first was an overture from some of the grand masters by the whole orchestra, Frederick Wagstaff conductor. Mr. Wagstaff was very successful in " Susan's Sunday out," and being encored gave " Mercenary Jane after which Mr. T. Matthews gave in Ids usual style "All-Fours," andbeing encored gave " Sold Everywhere." Mr. Sims' voice was remarkably clear in the " Paper Collar," «Style," and "Willie Bay;" after which followed a duet on the flute and violin by Messrs. Benton and Wagstaff. Professor Arnold then gave some of his celebrated magic tricks, the principal of which were the card tricks, and gammoning a young lady that her handkerchief was full of lollies and biscuits. The performance which seemed to tak£ most was the watch trick, and the professor drawing out of a hat belonging to a bachelor from the Tatiara a complete snit of baby linen. Whether he thought the bachelor required them or not it is difficult to tell. Half-anhour with Sable Brothers passed off well, the singing and performance of Master Johnnie Bull (pupil of Mr. Wagstaff) being greatly admired. In the farce —"Ghost in the Pawn Shop"—several local hits were introduced, the principal of which were the Salesman applied to the master for a perambulator to convey Mr. Bull's customer from the hoteL to the billiard-room as he was sure the DistrictCouncil of Lacepede were determined to> give no outlet to- the water which accumulated between the bar and the billiard, room. Another sale was made,, in which a key was bought for Mr. Bull to opens up all the land in the neighbourhood of Kingston. ,
