Ibumour. The Latest Important News- Foreign Denhabk.—A terrible tragedy his been enacted at Elsimore. It seems that tbe widow of the late Thomas P. Hamlet married her hnsband's brother, James Q. Hamlet. This so annoyed ber son, Colonel Hamlet, that he took to hard drink, and, in a fit of delirium tremens, declared he saw tbe ghost of his father, the late Thomas P., anl that the ghost informed him that his father had been murdered by James Q. Colonel Hamlet had been affianced for some time to Miss Ophelia Polonius, daughter of Judge Polonius, of the Supreme Conrt of Denmark. Colonel Hamlet imagined he had heard a mouse behind a screen, and, seizing a carving-knife from the dinner-table, plunged it into the screen, behind which Judge Polonius was concealed, to keep Colonel Hamlet from mischief. Judge Polonius was killed by tbe knife. An evening or so afterward, at some private theatricals, Colonel Hamlet behaved so rudely that his mother, uncle, and Miss Ophelia Polonius were compelled to leave the room. Colonel Hamlet's conduct so preyed npon Miss Ophelia that she drowned herself. At her bnrial Colonel Hamlet jumped into the grave, and her brother following him, a most unseemly fight took place, resulting in the two drawing knives and stabbing each other, and, just before dropping, Colonel Hamlet stabbing his uncle, James Q. Hamlet. All three died.—Puck.
