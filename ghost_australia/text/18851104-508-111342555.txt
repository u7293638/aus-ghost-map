V.Xt.0. Spring Meeting. THE COP DAY. (F&oie;: 'Maetmtdaie.') MJELBOTJUBK, Tuog day. — The day is fearfully tot, and it ia not long odds a eiorm will come up in the afternoon. Tae attendance is enormous. SSvery seat was taken in the grand stand before 11.30 a.m. TJielawii is crowded, an* all too oatleta So the stand are blocked up. The weather is tolling on tbe ladies, and already several have fainted. IS.' Grade, fthe injured jockey, has been allowed to visit the course, and is at present looking very well. Tlie ptnple arc still rolling up is crowds. Racing began with the Railway Stakes of one mile and a quarter, for which the Booth Australian colt Isonomy was installed favorite. He certainly looked better after his Derby gallop, and never left bin party in doubt, winning by three lenpfths from First Prince. In the Kensington States Madolina made amends to her party for her defeat in the Maribjrnong Plate. Ho secret was made about her high qnalincationa as a galloper, and the stable, after putting down the ' dollars ' in princely fashion up to even money, went so far aa to lay odds on her, despite the fact that she had to meet Tbe Nun, who had hitherto proved her&slf; a real good fitly. However the South Australians stuck to their colors, and landed a good stake with the daughter of Keckersgat. In the Hurdle fiaca the bookmakers had quite a throw in. Brigand lef (..the paddock at 2 to 1 against him, while Gasa lier, Agitation, and Bavensworth, all came in for a fair share of support. The winner turned up in the South Australian mare EuW by Lamdiet — a. ten to one chance. Duration fell. The Melbourne Cup next attracted the attention of visitors. So great was the crowd in the paddock that it became next to impossible for anybody to get a glimpse of the favorites undergoing their toilettes. The field was one of the largest whlgh ever started for the Cup, and about the best lot of hordes seen on Fleminprton since it was a racecourse. The t^cs was purely of an intercolonial character. Every on© of the colonies, except Weatern Ausvraiia, was represented. A good start was effected, and wh«n the ?e'd streamed past; the grand stand no more lovolj sight could be witnessed. Before a mile tnd a half h#d been traversed many of the favorites were done with, especially the Kew Zealanders owned by Sit. Win. fiobinsen, who wore evidently above themselves in condition. Trenton, tbe other representative of Maoriland, did far better and managed to run into third place, while the winner turned up in Sheet Anchor, by Bt. Albans from Queen Slay, by Castle Hill. Last July this horse (who hails frqpi Tas mania) was first favorite for the Grand National JKJiidcn Hurdle Bocs, and at the V.B.C. Autumn Meeting ifellarch ran. third in the Newmarket Handicap and seco^to his stable companion Bingwood — anotherhordle horse-dor the Australian Cup. Grace Darling, who ran second, gas the Caulfleld Cup winner, and there could have been lit$e of a ficke in her win on that occasion, as many people amerted. If the daughter of the Diver and Zoe had not been Hocked, it is just possible sue would have won. The Sursery Handicap next came in for decision, and was appropriated by tbe favorite Yellow Jacket, by the Drummjr, from Baroness, one of Mr. Loder'e breeding.
