?? AT CHRIGHTON ABBE5f. -: '?'. [from bbi.ciiu.via;] , '?'?''. '[ ''' ;'The Chrightons were very great, people in that part. of the country where my childhood; and youth. werb spent. . To speak of Squire Chrighton was to speak of a power in that romote western region of England. Chi-ighton Abbey had be« longed to the family ever since the reign of Stephen, and thore was a curious, old wing and a cloistered quadrangle still remaining of tho ori ginal edifice, and in excellent preservation. ' Tho rooms at this end of the houso were low, and some' what darksome and gloomy, it is true; but, though rarely UBed, thoy were perfectly habitable, and were of scrvico on great occasions whenthe Abbey was crowded with guests. Tho central ' portion of the Abboy had bcon rebuilt in the reign pf Elizabeth, and was of noble and palatial pro- , portions. The southern wing,, and along music- i room with eight tall narrow windows added on to it, were as modern as the time' of Anne. Alto- 1 gotherj the Abbey was a. splendid mansion, and one of tho ohief glories of our County. All the land in Chrighton parish, and for a long way be yond its boundaries, belonged to tho great Squire. ! The parish church was within the park walls, and j the living in the Squire's gift— -not a very valua-i ble benen'ce, but. a useful thing to bestow upon a| younger eon's , younger - Bon, onae In a.iyay, orj Bometimua dn a tutor of dependent of the wealthy httuse, I was a Ohrighton,' and iny father, a dis tant cousin of the reigning Squire; had been rec tor of Chrighton parish. His .death left mo utterly unprovided for- and I was fain to go out into tha bfeak unknown wfifld, ahd earn my UV, ingin a position.cf depeadence— a dreadful thing j for a Chrighton to be obliged to do. Out of respect for tbe traditions and pre-j judices of my race, I made it my business to seek: employment abroad, whore the degradation, of; one Bolitary Ohrighton was not bo likely to inflict', fihatne upon the ancient house to which 1 belonged, i Happily for myself, I had been carefully edu-| catedj and had Indiistriously Ctiltiyated the usual; modSrti ftBcompliShmerits in tho calm retirement 1 of the Vicarage. I-was'so fortunatd asto obtainj a situation at Vienna, in a German family of highj rank'; and here I remained seven years,, laying! aside year by , year a considerable;portion 6f my liberal Balary.:. When my, pupils iad grown -up, my kind miotresB prooured me a atill^more piofit ablepoaitijOn at St. Peisrsbarg^whereXremained; fiire.morb, J-eara, 'at' tHe end of .?^hlch;tlme'.ll jielded 'to a yearning that had been long growing 'upon median ardbnt desire to 'B'eo mj uear' old country home once 'itibre. I had no vbry^earj ?relations in EDgland.

In all: her Ietteraf6r| Borne thne;;pasfc Mrs. Ohrightoni begged that,) .whenever I felt myself justified in coming .home, I would pay along. viBi't, totheAbbey. ,'f I-.wish you could come - at , Christmas,' she wrote, in the autumn of the year o£ which I am speaking. ' We! .fihttll be fety. gajr, and J expect all kindB of plea sant people 9$ the Abbey: Tildward is to be mar ried in the Bpring-^much tb hiB father's satisfac tion, for the match is a good and appropriate one.
