I WORSE THAN BEING ON A JURY I Tiie C.mclave of Gregory X. Listed Iwo years, during which the Gliurch of Roma was without an infallible head. Clonieut IV., till) predecessor of Gregory, died at Viterbo, and tho cardinals, not being able to agree upon the choice of a successor, were preparing to leave the town when St. Buona ventura, the disciple of St. Francis of Assisi, persuaded the inhabitants to shut thoir gates and not let tho cardinals go till a Pope was made. The people took the saint's advicu, and not only shut the gates of tho town, but set a guard over the cardinals at the doors of the palace in which they met, and informed them that they could not even leave the palace until they had elacted their Pope. However, oven then the cardinala could come to no agreement; they went 0:1 from mouth to month and month to month still voting without producing tho requisite iwx joritv, till one day the Cardinal del Porto exclaimed that the Holy Ghost could never come down and inspire their choice as long as they had a roof over their heads. The people of Viterbo took this profane joke seriously, and unroofed the palace. This measure, again, was still ineffectual, and the cardinals, it seemed, would never have ar rived at any determination had the device not been hit upon of diminishing the sup plies of their tables. This measure suc ceeded. Hunger effected more than the rain or wind had done, and Gregory X. was elected. Gregory X., on his election, issued the Bull that a/1 future Popes should be elected in conclave-that is, by an assembly of cardinals locked up together, and subject to specilied restrictions as to diet and at tendance until the election was over.
