KATE ROBINSON. . By Fiiaxcis Adams. (Queenslander.) I. When Nellie Munro made up her mind that she would stay at home no longer, but set up in a little shop on her own account in town (in town meant Melbourne), one of the few friends in whom she confided was Kate Robinson The two girls had known one another is children Old Robinson had made his pile' before Kate was born, but that made little difference in his manner of life or of his family's At his wife's insistence he consented to buy a small station within thirteen or fourteen miles of Melbourne, which was "only worse,' as Mrs Robinson mournfully remarked, because now they were near enough to want to be right in, and were, after all, 3 just as far off as ever The rail way which has made of Hastings, with its three divisions of Hastings, Middle Hastings, and Hastings Bench, a fashionable Melbourne suburb was then undreamed of, and the place was pretty cally speaking, in the bush Old Munro was the doctor, then the solo doctor there, and the ord) Hastings people the Munros knew were the Robinsons, and jk<? exist Dr Munro was one of those demoniac sort of characters which are more frequent in the lives of country families all over the world than is generally supposed He had brains and a certain amount of manners, and both of these he was generally went to produce for the benefit of strangers and acquaintances, with whom he was said to be popular At home his brut 1 selfishness shone out with an intensity) that occasionally reached the pitch of madness He had married twice, and had four daughters by his first wife. He had allowed his children to grow up as they pleased, subject only to his own whims and brutalities His eldest daughter had shown her feelings towards him by rise lately refusing, after her marriage, to recognise him at all Nellie's two other sisters had almost followed suit, after having several times run away from home, and now Nellie, who had endured her utmost, through pit) of her not too amiable step-mother, left alone to the doctor's tender inert, res, had made up her mind that she would attempt to earn her own thing When she came of age a little money was due to her from her dead mother, and with this she doubt timed to very literally) set up shop is a tobacconist and fancy goods dealer in Melbourne By this time old Robinson was dead, and Mrs Robinson, with Kate, now her only daughter (one son had shot him self by accident, and the two others had been drowned by the capsizing in a squall in Port Philip in the crazy little Yacht which their father's meanness had purchased for them), was installed, after some little preliminary trouble and misadventure, in a fine house in Toorak, and doing her best, with a soured ill condi- tioned, and premature old age, to take) herself Kate was quite a Melbourne personage ' Everybody knew her but this popular topic tation was not of the pleasantest description IS of stones of her were deemed too extravagant to be credible She wore her hair, which was jet black, cropped short-a very unusual thing for girls not so many years ago Show is tall, almost 6ft, with the splendid massue afoot the Venus of Milo stays and corsets She held in abomination, but not even her inevitable loose w dustcoat with pockets, and the originality of her late way jackets could disguise the fact of a bust and torso worthy of days when women had not learned the hideous barbarities of the modern toilet dresses were worn tight and drawn back then but hers were loose to e, ii a play to her long swinging strides, and in he early mornings the greener, freshes, outskirts of the tow in beheld her riding alone in abusers and turn , galloping, taking 'still' places, or walking along thoroughly enjoying her thoughts and a cigarette Happening to be one of the richest girls in Melbourne, and also, despite her brown Bit urth) skin, one of the most beautiful ('prettiness a word that made her arch red lips curl abnormally) with a scorn- ful ascent), all this, as was natural created much comment Her manners with men were considered of the freest Often at 4 o'clock she would be seen striding along with someone (and too often with someone, whom that curious, vulgarised, but v, Ethel healthy and energetic little coterie, which calls itself Melbourne 'society,' considered nobodies), chatting and laughing (and, if Miss Robinson was amused, her laughter would make the fact patent), doing the block, with a sort of indifference or ignorance of the sensation she was causing that was viewed as 'loud' of defiant or both by her less emancipated sisters-. She brought a perfectly untrammelled ingenuousness to bear on all with which she had to do Outside the circle of those who really knew her, there formed the inevitable sea of slander and calumny But the men who thought her acquaintance easy to make, and herself the object of more or less modified impertinence, soon found out their mistake, and became of the number of her friends and partisans, or retired to develop into sources of tons innuendo against the girl who had abashed those Women friends she had but two, and these were almost address, not but what she was always kindly to her own sex, but her own sex received the communications and attention of such a personage with a suspicious dislike which was never overcome Kate did not think of troubling to overcome it Like her mother, her great, her sole, object in life was to enjoy herself Mrs Robinson wished to enjoy herself in other people's way, Kate in her own That was the difference Kate had only her simple downright intentions to trust the, intentions of a girl who had lived in the bush all her life, and now was proceeding, with unlimited resources in the way of money, to live in the same spirit in the town She was very happy She had as a it had but one cross in her new career, but that had really provoked her Minnie Gentle, her greatest friend (for during the last two years circumstances had necessarily kept her somewhat apart from the other, Nellie Munro), had managed to make the acquaintance of that lovely and talented stranger whom Melbourne society' knew for so short a period as Mrs Brown, and who presently flamed up, comet-like, the popular "stage idol of the hour, as Made) Brown or (more shortly still) ' Muddy ' Kate first saw her (as it happened on the first night of her greatest success, 'Les Boulevards,' and at once conceived an ardent desire to know her Miss Gentle had undertaken, through her friend Stuart, the journalist (who was said to be something nearer and dearer still to the fair Creole' than a mere friend), to bring this about. A few days later, on the last night of the old year, as every- body knew, Mrs Brown was mysteriously murdered Kate took quite a personal interest in the matter, and it was a standing cause area to her that the murderer was never run to earth, but to all appearance escaped scot free Then Nellie Munro's trouble came to distract her attention, and she threw herself into the plan with her accustomed ardour It was she who insisted that nothing would do for her friend but a central position That's half the battle, Nellie,' she said emphatically (Nellie was on a week's visit at the Robinsons, and the two girls were deep in consultation up in Kate's boudoir ) ' It must be Collins street or nothing '* ' But the rent said Nellie ' Bother the rent ' I'll pay the rent '' " No, you won't, Kate ' Now, you promised -you know you promised you wouldn't talk in that way any more Mightn't I as well have come and stopped here with you all along r' '-I meant, to an tm estment,' said Kate, is on should pay me interest if you wanted son. are people are so proud 'of ' So would other people but, if they were 10 r " ' How much did that man want for that little hole by the bank r' ' Five pounds a week ' ' Nell, old girl, you must take it I'm sure it's wisest I wouldn't advise it if it wasn't wisest You will do a grand trade there All the fellows on the block will got you I'll send every man I know, and you are not to give them back any change You dear Mid Nellie, rising and kissing her 5 and if you and Minnie will only promise to buy all your cigarettes from me I shall make a pile in six weeks, and the three of us will go to Europe together ' They both laughed That is understood,' said Kate II Nellie's shop turned out a real success in every- way the first week's profits reaching the very respectable sum of £10, and the second and third £10 as much again Kate was jubilant, and at 11 t succeeded in pel trading her friend to let her furnish the little back-room, in order that the The (Miss Gentle of corned was the third) might spend pleasant afternoons together over tea and cigarettes Iden Kate gave free vent to her fancy and this little back room, sacred to the virginal deliberations of the three, blossomed out into a oriental luxury as high excited the keen curiosity of a wonderful man ber of people both in and out of Molbitiuie ' society ' No promise cv e showed er, male or female, had as yet succeeded in penetrating it Heavy embroidered cm bun s beyond the sole port of entrance returns I the secret of the penetrate whence the small silver press hell fixed in the counter calle 1 forth the shop keeper At times Kate herself might be seen behind the counter, and, as elie find a powerful lniiiiriiintion in the matter of prices, and novel could persuade herself to learn the mysteries 'secretaries with which Nellie was want me to marry her articles (after the approved an inner of the trade) the till had a way of replenishing itself on such occasions that was really short hair Had not the Ino emphatically favoured the early closing movement, there can be small doubt that (Nellie would have had few hours of peace from the east mess of her customers This idea of early closing was Nellie's own, and had screen front two causes First, she thought ten horns (> to 7 was quite sufficient . we work for anyone Secondly, she -soon found that the evening customers were not of a sort she skid or rather, the descent of night seemed to act troublesome on the male intellect and IN ellie preferred to see the Sprightly Messenger (nsthoTuohadnimedtho small boy who took down and put up the shutters and is he alleged, ' made himself generally useful') closing up her best inhalations at 7, and herself on her way home to her boarding house One morning, at about 10 o'clock (it was in November almost a year since the Maddj Brown tragedy) Kate, in a white diaphanous toilet of more than ordinary free loin and Tttuictiveness, nlacopirasol in one hand and a book in the other, burst into the shop, and, after embracing INelho, held out the book with some excitement Have you read it she asked Nellie looked at it It was a thin book, bound in deep blue cloth with gold letters and (what presented itself to her as, a twiddle' of gold in the right bottom corner Along the top, in two lines, also read 'Echoes drink Hawkesbury ' ' No,' she said, I haven't " 'It's splendid said Kate 'I mean, it's very sad, very sad He's written two other books of poems "Random Rhymes" and and I forget the name of the other this moment, I am so excited Nellie, the " Random Rhymes" are as good as Gordon ' ' I don't believe it said Nellie Kate dropped the parasol and began to quote, Old, is r 'I issue a I c- i 1 iiM If I had a la Rey it 117 e I f of will tell i le, I I til, A.

' Why, year, old girl,' said Nellie that's him and a precious miserable, bilious looking fellow he is I always feel low-spirited when I read poets-even G irJou I wouldn't marry a poet for worlds " ' Not even Gordon ' asked Kate . U, he's dead, said Nellie, and besides, he was married to somebody else." ' Yes, he's dead, said hate, and besides, he was married to somebody else HE Kate did not come to see her friend the next day, in the next, nor yet the next, somewhat to Nellie's surprise but as trade was brisker as she had plenty of small family troubles of her own on hand she p and no use it heed to it.

The two girls spent the whole evening together, and parted without the one subject that was nearest to them both h nag been broached A week passed-two works, three weeks, and Kate came from time to time to the shop She was growing listless and pale each day, it seemed to Nellie, and she At could sit in the little back room 01 he on the sofa for linuis, while Nellie attended to her business, 1 ending or thinking, and 1- art ely seeming to c are to speak Then she would not come for three or four days, and all the while Nellie felt that salt is as being Hawkesbury often, and that develop ments of great moment in the mutual relations of the two v. ei e taking place Once or twice she expressed her anxiety about Kate's health the looked ill she BÍ0111 go away for 11 change The summer months there too a) big in town what with the heat and dust and showers and changes Kate admitted that she was not feeling very well, but she would 'work it off ' Occasionally Minine esme 111, and in the flood of her talk the name of 11 Tewkesbury 01 of Hawkesbury and Kate together, would be in, but Nellie would ask no questions, and Minnie troubled h rself little with connected theories on either people or things At last things reached to a crisis Kate came 111 one afternoon looking wretchedly ill, and, after having some tea and dawdling about in the back room 11 little, came out and said that it was sitting in there, and went home Three days passed, and she did not come again so on the fourth, Nellie determined to go to Toorak after dinner and I try to catch her On arriving she was told Miss Kate was up in the boudoir, and mounted alone Nellie opened the door quietly and entered A candle burned on the table at tv with her friend was Boated, and Nellie, un- observed, stood and looked at her Astranve, dull, fevered breath oppressed the beautiful far e The eyes had a dazed look, as from the intolerable ache of till bewildered brain The red lips seemed to burn with the line of red hot bricks in a smoking kiln She But there absently gazing at a n« wspuper spread in front of her on the table, one elbow stretched out and the hand propping the wear) head Nellie had a sudden panic She had seen that look on a girl's face before, and it had meant fever and a desperate struggle for life She came behind and put her arm tenderly round her shoulders, as only lovers and chums' know how But Kate did not seem to notice 'What is it, Kate old girl Nellie said, softly kissing her Are you ill r' Kate shook her head, gave a her one look, and then stared at the parish With quick intuition Nellie saw what she was looking at It was a little paragraph b) itself-a list of the passengers by the Orient mail ship that had left Melbourne the day before Half way through it, at the end of a line an 1 separate somewhat from the names that followed it, was this one 'Mr Frank Hawkesbury' The two girls was 0 in complete touch with one another in a few seconds Kate slowly looked at her again, a dazed and dreary look, and putting both her arms onto the table let her head fall onto them > ellie could neither speak nor move Then all at once she saw Katie s body shaking-sometí mg of a sob, something of a shudder-and with a low cr) knelt beside her, wrapping her with her arms, drawing her down to her. 'O Katie, Katie,' the said, my poor Kate " IV It was characteristic of Kate that almost at dawn she was up and on horseback and out for a long ride She rude furiously at first She had got it into her head that she would like to go out to Brighton Cemetery and look at Gordon's grave. This wild loved) burial ground had a great attraction for her The curious struggle in it between the cultivated and natural flowers and shrubs, their training rank luxuriance, like an amorous death struggle, the unkemptunteuded grave of her poet, all this seemed to make a sort of temple torherdaikei and stranger moods Once she used to come here pretty often, riding over from her old home in the sea shore with a packet of bread and bitter and a small bottle of water, lunching time and corn is back after sunset She had brought out Nellie with her on one or two occasions but to that gentler and more everyday mind there was something repellent in the neglect of the dead the seemed implied in this rank and uncultivated his fiance Later on in Melbourne, during a short visit of Nellie's, the two girls is id lit by character the St. Kilda Ctinetoi v and Nellie had confessed that this was to ride to, and Kitto had an enforced iSo poem of Hawkes bin s 's clung to her more is northerly than that on Gordon's grave, uni the weary iteration and doubt of one of the list as the book of "1 bees" addressed to Gordon, and full of the feeling of suicidal death decided to list to be her own utterance to it till size I I code el I I r ii li' till! 11 yo I eat li 1 Through her sick, for bread, and half bewildered by it the evidence of the horse ran ociisolosBiy There was a dutiful on and the mr find all that sent action of a clear wine v is rich comes its those rather dusty hours pass into the settled warmth and in li ml light of morning The sun rolled up ruddy and gold, doings in the pi mi and filling her with a feeling akin to worship All over the tommy thnbinrht yellow broom lit up the hodges find fields, while here and flies (to go across vagabond eglantine lifted up her dell into pink petals uni s carted the breeze On the his voice the lok witligit.cn or lit up with the christening cherries it stone 1 at her morbid much as if she were riding to isolate death that it was the the utterer of that Heytesbury came there, in the i f to noon of just such a day as this She would b there before him and he and think and dream fill she saw him in taking up short by over Hu mass through the trees to the shattered column with its poet laurel wreath how well she knew the way he would come his movements he was look on his face as he lifted it up and saw her ' He would pause a moment (only a morne nt) and then some light on smil- ing a hill in the way he bud, so gentle so like a silk hand kind on your brow to one s and soothe you, and he down on the grass best to be, and they wouldn't together as they had talked sometimes in the past She kn If it is now There was no hope "she had been blind not to see that He could not have anyone else but Alison-his love, Ina Eileen, Iris goddess .

At the same time she fed her humour by going to place that received all that was uppermost in it But now her mother great fright ned as soon passed into afternoon and afternoon into evening, and still no sign of her The great round harvest moon rose up ruddy over the tenderly, and then grow pale and that and at last attained to light and radiantly and Mrs Robinson, with Munno Gentle, and Nellie goading hot dull qiioruloiiH apprehensions into excitement, priced up and down the veranda, and inco- herently considered plans for making a search after her eccentric child But what restrained him was the hour of annoying that child, who was wont to have her own way in her own affairs unquestioned Nellie, however, objected that this case was a peculiar case Kate wasn't well, indeed, Ntlho was afraid she was going to be ill, very ill indeed She had just the look about her that Nolllo's Sister, Polly, had when she was sickening for tin fever But neither Mrs Robinson nor Munro had noticed anything the matter with Kate lately This angered INellia, who came very near to administering a suit rebuke to the heedless Minnie ' There are some people, thought Nellie to herself, ' who never notice anything'' However, she suc color in restraining herself, and, acting on Minnie's impressionable mind, soon succeeded in getting her to take a similar view to her own, and presently Munro was urging energetic and prompt action It was long past 8 o'clock when they all agreed that, if Kalo did not appear by I, they would have a search begun for her time after time the two girls had gone down the drive to the garden gate and walked a little way down the load on the lookout for her Nellie now set off by a result, declaring that this was the last time, while Minmn remained on the veranda, persuading Mrs Robinson, who was still a little peevishly afraid of such a bold proceeding as sending out the coachman, groom and gardener in different directions after Kate, and letting the two girls do the same All at once Minnie heard Nellie cry out something, and saw her set off at a run to the gate Then she followed crying out, That's him, that's her'' and there sure enough, entering through the gate that Nellie had pink d open, was late on horseback in her riding habit Even Minnie was struck by the listless attitude of her friend Kate seemed uttf rly worn out, bent down, the reins fallen from one hand, 111 whip in the other holding on to leafy to the saddle The thieoiatnoup to the house in silence Nellie, leading the horse, full of anxiety Kate did not answer their questions, but looked at them with a sort of childish, almost idiotic, heedlessness Nellie lifted her d 12 n out of the saddle, and with her arm round her waist led her up to her bedroom, Minnie and Mrs Robinson of living There Nolle at once assumed the director, sent lift Mrs Robinson to order warm water and blankets and tell Fanny (the maid) not become me, while she and Minnie set to to undress Kate and get her into bed 'His poor girl was quite passive Now and then she looked up and around in that childish, almost idiotic, way that frightened Nellie, hut for the most part she seemed oppressed by some great and dull pink She said once or twice '0, my head' 0, my head" Nellie's idea was to send for the doctor immediately, and when this was done she proceeded to clear the room, and then came and sat down by her friend's side, holding her hand and waiting Kate seemed half asleep, and began to be very troubled. She seemed to think she had been at Hawkesbury's grave, f-be w murdered on incoherently about him and herself, confusing him with Gordon, and some times speaking as if they were all dead and walking together about in a dark place under the earth, where there were blood buckers and beetles and tins roots of the trees and flowers. The sobs rose in Nellie's heart as she listened, and once when, in the childish voice of most of her ramblings, Kate tried again and again to I remember a match of Hawkesbury's verse and could not, and was much distressed at it, Nellie covered up her face with her hands and felt that she might not be able to bear what she ' felt was coming.

It was more than a year since Kalo had died January with its feverish bent and dust and hIiovvcis was over, and the autumn had broken with closing Pobi may mild and mellow She came back by tram, and passing out from the station and up 1 Elizabeth street suddenly found himself alone (if 0110 man say he of two people momentarily isolated in the stream of passers) with 11 figure which recalled to her some man she had once known well He tins walking in front of her listlessly, his stick thrust (through his arm, his head bowed, his hands behind his back She was a little startled, and the hot flush handed itself across her blow Then She made up her mind to speak to him The first time she addressed but he did not hear her the second time she accompanied her words with a light touch on the arm. He turned, and they looked at one another It was the fate of a ghost The tiny skeleton skull petered out The great show of cs gazed from the depth of two dark-haired caverns The thin lips and still, but partially and wore drawn back from the teeth that showed Strangely bleached The white cadaverous cheeks were hollow The same impulse guided them. They went on together side by side in silence Neither knew whether they had greeted one another At last he spoke ' It is very curious to meet you," he said I never expected it somehow But you have something to say to me, I think, Miss Munro ' ' Yes,' she said I live ' He seemed to allow 11 little 1 Shall we go up to the Gnidonsr-' he said or sit down in one of the arcades i Are you tired (' ' No,' she answered ; ' let us go on to the Gardens.' They went on together again in silence all the way up Collins-street (neither of them thought of the little shop lower down), and across to the Fitzroy Gardens. It was close on sunset. The slanting light shot in a great banded tide through the trees. They went on till they came to a retired seat by a littlupond, where the frogs, darling in the water from the edges, reappeared presently to breathe and gazed stolidly up after the manner of their kind. She sat down first, and then he. There was a pause. ' So you've come back 'e' she said I've come back.' ' I want you to tell me why you went away.' I will tell you. The woman I loved had gone away. I followed her. I could not help t.' Nellie was troubled. Then it was nothing,' she said nothing nothing to do with Kitto-with Miss Robin- son 'e' He looked at her with surprise. Miss Robinson's' he repeated; 'I don't understand. Another pause. 1 She is dead, said Nellie softly. ' I heard so I was told so. I am very sorry.' Nellie flashed out. 1 Very sorry ! What do you mean? That's an insult to her! Sometimes I have felt I should have to go after you, and find you, and shoot you!' 'Shoot me?' (He sighed.) I wish you would" ' And all the time it was another woman ? I don't believe you!' ] It was very gentle with her, and ready to explain, and at last he listened to him quietly. He told her that he had loved a woman here in Melbourne. He need not tell her her name, but perhaps she could guess. Well, that woman had never loved him he had never imagined it but she had passed him, and her pity was more than another woman's love. He had no word to say of her but gratitude and worship. The time came when she in her turn loved. And so she left him here, and what with the man she loved to England. He had nothing to say of him but what was honourable, true, great oven. He himself had no cause for complaint in anything. Well, he had tried to remain here and work and die, but he was a wretched weak-willed idiot, and he could not. He had to follow her to England and see her again once more, and then he thought he would be able to return and end it somewhere where she would never hear of him. He would not give her one pang. The thought of any sorrow to her was intolerable to him, and she was so piteous for all ! He- saw her he saw him. Truly he was almost worthy of her. He was great. He might yet be England's Ottmar, and show as with him as a queen, a goddess ' It was well so-best so He was content Nellie's soul revolted against the tale, although she fell that it was the simple, earnest, actual truth Her heart was very sore for her Kate, her dead ' chum ' Thophrnso ' maudlin sentimentality' rose before her, but those grave deathly eyes drove it back from her lips ' said ' she said suddenly, ' did Kate know of it all r' ' Kate r' he repeated, ' Miss Robinson' No How should she ' 'You're told me easily one go,' and Nellie, and vi is not her 'I understood,' he said slowly, that you had particular i reasons for wishing to know why I went to England ' Ntlhu missed She had indeed said so, and, with a significant emphasis that standly bole dund, she turned Percyton to his and looked at him on next by I believe von,' who said 'Those' T belive veil' She held out her hand to him, and he took it He was untiring in his (unit, and for a few moments he did not let it go A st ning brooding look was in his eyes She was almost ready, to be a little frightened of him ' Do yon an ' he said, ' do you mean that she Miss Robinson I hope not '" 'I mean tins,'saul Nellie, 'that, "he while you were morning and thinking yourself half mad about someone who didn't t no n me about you, and kind married someone else had gone to ngillin!-lilted you in fact, I suppose that was the most Intuition and nobles! and best and oh you st girl in all Australia mainly to But you men are the stupidest things in creation A on what killing off also in their You're no good I at all any way What does my girl was not to go at fuelling herself to a man for, which there are other girls who gave her a id would die for her r I think men are cause stupid bl lies They are the cause of all the suffering in the whole earth 1 Imtr them " She had a little ] Puseyism of age and that the reaction t fine, and oil burst into a passion of sobs ' Go away she Rind, 'gnaw ay' you in the mu assumed loved j at ten o a mi ' 1 li to you again that any of them in 1 till July on You 1 died as i Why shouldn't I I ill I was ' I ask you to go away mouthings and hysterical I am not only bite you as I should hut of a murderer who killed the most beautiful thing in the world I know all about it now For cups you mount no for me You without wicked A on were only stupid Some lines it's worse far worse to be stupid than w ii and Co away that all I ask of you now so we may Leave me alone He fine, looking at her vi ill i aspect and on the tenderness J lo saw he would do best to go, us she uses d line 1 He turned and w and as 11 the grass The sun had set A cool breeze was blow over The light was I rising quickly When she raised her head and looked for him, she could see him passing chiefly dark shadow h Hythe gave '1 lion he was gone, and she shivered He seemed to have passed down somewhere into some place where he was for ever lost the plate into which Kate had passed -the Valley of the Sh show of Death
