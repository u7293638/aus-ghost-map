WAGGA WAGGA. rpTtOM out CORRESPONDENT.] JUNE 17 The past week has been one of almost continuous rain For the first two or three days it came do in steadily, with cold cutting winds, and an occasional driving sleet, nor were we without the variety of a fall of hail to that the week has been altogether fraught with much discomfort, which was a matter borne with considerable cheer fulness in view of the undoubted improved prospects which that discomfort brought The latter part of the week found the rain slackening of, four light drizzling showers of 11 each day at intervals, the told being most penetrating On the whole, the rainfall will, I suppose, give a register close upon three inches, not such a return as one might be led to expect from its dura- tion, but still sufficient to make us very thankful Very little chaff has been effected in the river the thirsty earth, it would B] pear, has taken in all that has fallen, so that creeks an 1 v waterholes have derived little or no benefit from the change On Saturday there was a partial cleaning up, with an hour or son gleam of sunshine, but the fe Mow- ing day showed its thickly overcast sky, and to-night there is every indication that a further heavy fall may be expected, for the rain comes down steadily while I write Upon business generally the change will no doubt, exhibit its efforts for the better The stock business has already shown nonie spring of activity, and there is reason to believe that matters in Uns important item of our local affairs will now be pretty brisk for a time wet and stormy as the n ghost have been it appears that they were not severe enough to quote that fiendish spirit of evil, incendiarism for this week I have to chronicle two cases of nek burning, which have all the appearance of this crime. The first that came to our cars was one that took place on Thursday night, at Warby s Island, a large fattening paddock close to the town, belonging to Messrs YVoimnll and Hlnymoy Here they had stored some 120 tons of hay, which was entirely consumed, though the rain was falling heavily at the time the, police have Their suspicions as to the perpetrator of the outrage, but it is feared will fail to obtain any direct evidence in the matter No doubt whatever is entertained as tons being the work of an incendiary, as there is no circumstance 10 justify the notion of an accident in the locality in which the note was raised, and a bottle which appeared to have bad kerosene in it was found on the spot The property was insured for £300, but this amount is far below the present and prospective value of the hay the other case of rick burning took place on Tuesday night last, at Spring Hill, the farm of Mr I T M Crno, near W iliaco Town At some distance from the homestead Mr MCrae had some lady and Oaten straw stacked which he values at £150 Near the stacks stands a hut, in which a man employed on the farm slept The Diet was wet and stormy, and the family all retired to rest about 9 o'clock the man referred to retiring about the same time About 11 o'clock he was awakened by a crackling noise, and get ting up discovered both studs on fire, their complete destruction being the work of but a very short time Unfortunately, the property, in this instance, was not insured, and the loss will be severely felt At a meeting of the members of the Mechanics' Institute held on Thursday night for the purpose of confirming some alterations in the rules proposed by a rev mon committee, and making others if necessary, a new rule was adopted which will give much satisfaction. It was decided that ladies, near relations of members of the institute, shall be admitted as members on payment of 10s per annum, instead of the guinea subscription demanded from the ordinary member The rule, however, was not allowed to pass an this simple form, for one stern specimen of the "lords of creation no doubt having a wholesome horror of women s rights' movements, and their influence- proposed as an amendment the addition to the rule, ' I had no such lady member shall be el gibB to fill any office in the institution,' the amendment being carried by a good majority of those present A c residents amount of snrrnsoand regret has been manifested on the suspension of Mr Middleton, the post and telegraph master, who has occupied the position for a number of years The change is suppose it to have been mainly l-ou¡,Lt nluutbv the recent post office robberies, for which the two lids Clunes and Jones have been committed for trial A 1 large body of public opinion taking this view is round holding that the summary removal of Mr Middleton is a display of an unnecessary and unmerited amount of official harshness, and memorials urging a rever al of the decision, have been forwarded to the Post j master-General and to the Superintendent of Telegraphs, each being signed by a very large number of residents in the town and district, in which Mr Middleton is a very general favourite Mr Unwin, the gentleman appointed to take Mr Middleton's place, come.-, to us, I believe, from the Sydney office, and took charge of the office to-day The desire that the district should take its share in the Pearce testimonial has been get an expression to amongst us, and accordingly Mr A T Bolton, it appears, has in mutation of Sydney set on foot a sixpenny subscription to the fund Properly worked, the idea ought to bring in a good round sum, but it must be remembered that the facilities for making a collection in this fashion are much greater in the city so far as the leading streets of the town are concerned, a zealous collector might get on to his satisfaction, but there are numbers of people belonging to the neighbourhood of the town living at such scattered distances to whom, I am afraid, his zeal would never reach However, I think we ought to be able to muster at least £100 for the fund in this way When the Inspector of Cn innes was here it will be remembered he condemned the present site of our hospital for its bad drainage and 120 dill cult of originating a system of surface drainage thereon He urged the committee strongly to take step for the removal of the institution from the low-lying land to a more elevated site, and promised to lend his aid to induce the Government to grant the better site required On arriving in Sydney this gentleman inten lowed the Minister for Justice, and placed his recommendations on the matter before him, with the reasons which prompted them On doing this he wrote to the committee, advising them to speedy take some steps to back up the representations he has made Accordingly, a special meeting of the general committee was convened for Tuesday evening last and at this meeting arose one of those debates, peculiar I must say to the meetings of this body, in which one alway s bus the uncomfortable impression that there is a secret bottom to which it is impossible to get. The meeting was convened to take steps for the removal of the hospital from its present site The chairman, Mr H E. RUESOII, manager of the A J S Bank, in introducing the matter to the meeting, said that the convener s were not prepared with any scheme, but desired that the meeting should consider one Oddly enough, as it appeared to me, the initiative in the proceedings was taken by those who had discovered that they did not want the hospital removed at all Mr C Bolton, one of these, led off with a lengthy speech, which may be briefly and truthfully summed up thus The present hospital site is quite a paradise, the Inspector of Charities knows nothing about drainage, I do, and I say the place is splendidly drained, and has great natural facilities for good drainage The Government has no high land in the district to give away, and if they had, neither the business men in the town nor the doctors would pay proper attention to the institution if it was shifted upon the hills All this at great length, Mr Hunter following admitting that he thought the objection about the difficulty of getting business men and doctors to walk a little distance in the work of mercy was one of great force Both these gentlemen, with some others, talked some time before it was suggested that there was no motion before the chair, and it was only when Mr Hawkins -rose to speak on the other side that the ob\ loud irregularity of the proceed- ings became patent to a good many That gentleman accordingly moved-' That in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable that immediate steps be taken for the removal of the hospital from its present to a more elevated site, and at a greater distance from the centre of the town In reply to Mr Bolton's as certain that no Government land was available Mr Hawkins urged that they could purchase a site the present site was estimated to bring 2500 The Government, he held, backed up as the change was by their own 11 officer, would readily grant £1000 and the chairman pointed out that they had £400 out at interest so that the £1000, the sum mentioned by the Inspector of Charities as the amount they ought to spend in building, was almost made up without going to the public for a penny Mr Hawkins' motion was seconded by D Mangan O'Connor, one of the medical officers of the institution, who certainly spot 0 to the question in anything but I read li cats and whispering humbleness " He flatly contradicted Mr Bolton's a section that the drainage was good, and stated that at the then present moment his stable (the doctor s residence, his own property, is close by,) was filled with the drainage from the hospitallatator} andiard, right on to the mangels He showed that the present site of the hospital was perpetually overhung with dense fogs in the morning, and that it was positive cruelty to a number of poor old asthmatic patents not to make some effort to remove eat He denounced the building us in every way unfit for its purpose, insufficient in its accommodation, and evidently erected by a man who knew nothing of hos- pital requirements He stated as a fact that he knew of poor creatures, and had attended them, dying in calico tents about the town, because they had no room for them there, and he pointed out to the committee v jth much earnestness the cruelty that accident mauncd- paliuifs were submitted for, under present arrangements, by being forced to occupy the same ward as the poor patients stricken with contagious disease These men, he said, might perish from infection, for they could not get out of its war, and their death might with truth be attributed to blundering imbecility, and not not to God's providence He urged them strongly to adopt the Inspector of Charities' recommendation, and to build anew hospital furnished with all the appliances that modern science had brought within easy reach, and trusted that they would also obtain a resident medical officer, and that he hoped he should not only see this change, but also see, as he was sure he would all the medical men of the town giving their services to the institution, gratis An amendment to the motion was moved by Mr Bolton, that the present site be retained, and on being put to the meeting this amendment was carried, Mr Hawkins and Mr. O'Connor only voting against it. A resolution was then moved by Mr Hunter, that steps be taken to secure a good site for the hospital, and that a site might be secured before the price of land ran up higher Mr. Bolton moved as an amendment, that no steps be taken to secure a site, and, after a very long and irregular discussion, an amendment, moved by Mr Jackson, was carried, which shelved the difficulty by postponing the consideration of a better site till that day six months, and so concluded the meeting. The Capel inquiry into the charges against the wardsman and the hospital management is still proceeding The committee But twice last week On Tuesday night Dr Wren was examined, and on Friday night some patients were examined at the request of the wardsman, when the committee adjourned until Tuesday (to-morrow) night Fresh evidence has, I believe, appeared, which will demand the attention of the corn cutter, and it is difficult just now to conjecture when the report on the inquiry will appear. Judging from the number of sittings the committee has already had, that document m likely to be as lengthy as it is interesting The final engagement in the war of the brakes took place on Thursday last, in the Municipal Co sell Pursuant to notice. At Jerram Shaw moved,-" That the resolution committing the Council to the new bridge over the Wollundry lagoon be rescinded " Alderman Shaw reviewed the whole of the proceedings in this matter in a most effective manner, and was somewhat amusing in characterising the arguments . produced for the new star turn The motion, seconded by Alderman l'ltrhnrdingo, was caused by the casting vote of the Mayor, who justified his action by saying to the had five or mion of the railway engineer, Mr R T 1 nth, who considered the present bridge was good for ten years yet, and so has ended, at any rate for a time, a struggle T Inch has occur in the lore ground in the proceedings of out Mtumipil parliament for the past six months. The "bridge again their own door party, hitherto found to have plenty to say upon the subject, appear to have been thoroughly cowed on thlioirnsion, for, though both Alderman Shaw and Alderman 1 itilmrdlngo indulged in some provokingly caustic he or, they con II not trusted amongst them sufficient oratorical coming to venture a single word in reply. It is confidently stated in town talk that energetic measures will be taken by those interested at the opening of the railway to Junee to incur near the Ministers then present to consider a proposal to alter the line of railway across the river, to that, instead of running as designed in front of the Wiipoa convent, it may be diverted to the back of that institution, one of the arguments for such a change being the great danger children going to the com- ent schools will be subjected to in the necessity for crossing the railway line for stock market returns for the past week exhibit considerable improvement on the previous week, though matters are yet in some classes of stock extremely quiet The dullness in store cattle continues, but it is expected that the rain will bring a speedy change, as confidence is restored in the prospects of grass for the future.
