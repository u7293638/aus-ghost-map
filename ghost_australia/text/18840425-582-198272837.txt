FOR THOSE WHO FAIL. All honour to lum who shall win tnc prize, The world has cried for a thousand years ; Bht to bim who tries, and who fails and dies, I give great honour, and glory, and tears. Give glory, and honour, and pitunl tears . To all who fail in their deeds sublime ; Their ghosts are many in the van of years They were bom with Time in the advance of Time. Oh. great is the hero who wins a name, Bnt greater, many and many a time, Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame, Ar-H Jets God finish the thought sublime. And great is the w.an with the sword undrawn, And good is the man who refrains from wine ; Bnt the man who fails and yet fight3 on, io, he is the twin-born brother of mine. Joaquin" Miller.
