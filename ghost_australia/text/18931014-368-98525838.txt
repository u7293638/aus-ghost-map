Venus and a Comet. THE Rev. George Martin writes:--" In observing the planet Venus this (Thursday) evening just after sunset, with 4in. Grubb equatoral, I was surprised to find a comet in the same telescopic field with the plenet. I thought at first that it must be a ghost, or some flaw in the glass; but on turning the telescope on to the double star Antares, I found things all right and the little com- panion to the star quite distinct. On-re- observing the planet with various powers the comet was a fine object. In relation to the planet the nucleus was south, following, and the tail spread out in fan-like curve, in part enveloping the planet but in nowise detract- ing from its brilliancy. For a few moments to the naked eye the planet was involved in a distinct nebulosity though no clouds were in the sky near the planet.
