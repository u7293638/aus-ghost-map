I wonld like to print tba latter, but cannot on aeooant of tha filth, but I will show it to any subscriber of this paper on application. I am told, tha Brighton people posted my article oa a blackboard in their ' saddling paddock,' on Monday, alongside of aomathing eulogistic whioh appeand in thia paper in tb* dim past, CEEBLB AKS DAVIS. I never, except oa one occasion, wrote a line in favor of Brighton track, The ecoep tion waa whan BUI Davis, or tbe Canterbury stewards, grabbed Daeble's dates, and, in istpoMt vo a crying latter from Peters, I wrote a par in whioh Z elded unmistakably witb Deeble. I aald Deeble. was a better aportiman than any of the Oanterbury push, and had done mora for sport. That was quite true. None of the Oanterbury push ever supported any kind of eport unless they saw money in it Deeble may be as good a sport as ever he was for all I know, but I am judging him now on What I aawand know to be true. If Deeble is aggrieved why don't he write a letter to the ' Herald,' or one of the other daily papery and let me reply to it ? Not he, he knows perfectly well all I eaid was absolutely true. Besides he knows who I am, and has his remedy. I didn't go to Brighton on Monday ; one day was enough for me. Besides I couldn't command the permanent artillery and we are not on speaking terms with the police, so I dare not show my nose about Deeble's delight unless protected by a strong body of fearless men. Tnongh I didn't go I was represented, and hear Deeble aud Co. disqualified a couple of trotters because the handier of tbem told everybody the winner was 'dead.' Tbe disqualification was sup posed to be for ' inconsistency.' Fancy the Brighton push noticing inconsistency ? Any how, tbe disqualification got into tbe papers, and Johnny has gained a cheap reputation of 'firmness.' Johnny knows how to work the papers— so does his friend and pattern 'Arry Biokarde. JOHNNIE, &ET; Y0VB GUN- j When Deeble hit up against me tbe I other day he threatened, in his pnny way, violence with his little fifts. He hurt my feelings very much when he threatened to ' see Jack Want' I suppose he will get an order to have me lauded in a dungeon vile for tbe rest of my life for daring to say a word of truth about hi* terrible little track, Johnny is a good fisherman and koows where all the fish — human and otherwise — are. and how to catch them. Such a man is right after the heait of good- fisherman Jack Want, aud no doubt Johnny has t;id himself oat to please the Osar ot all Australia by tbowing him where to fieh, and singing him tetchy little songs when the finny fools fought shy. After a good day of ' eighteen dozen and four* [Jon t forget the odd four, printer] and half a dozen good songs rendered iu Seeble'e best mmis-hatl style, no doubt big Jack has extended the hand of friendship to tbe cocky little pony-course proprietor; and now, if anyoody offends the latter, ne is threatened with Jack Want and gaol.

When Deeble tells Wa&t; about me I nope he will make it light and not put me ia gaol {ot all my life, because I would lik* to be out when the great revolution begins, to attend the hanging of a few raoe course ' proprietors ' and their pimps; as owes tbe mcg A Queensland friend who ha* been ou a short visit to Barataria, writes concerning pomes add pony race promoters of that interesting oountry. Of .course there is no auch pUM as Batataria, bat that doesn't at all matter. He writes:— '- I could scarcely mafce hah out at fifat ; leas eo when he spoke. His appearance was bad enough — his speech was worse. When he was not lying he was swearing, and 1 never met a man who -*uld da both better, or who eksreised his eeoomplisb ments with such unconscious effect He waa proud of them, because they were gjfts of nature. Seeing 'I wore a worried look' at being (without preparation) confronted With the blatant person, kind, friends rushed to at assistance, and one,' quicker than the rest said : ' What don't you know him?' 'No,' I gasped with some difficulty, fdr such ehoeke to my system do not agree with it. Yet,, gathering courage when I noted the animkted visages around and about me, I aaked boldly, 'Who is he ?' « Why, he i* the ovmer of Out pony track? was the fateful ohorns of response; Each of Sty friends seemed anxious to beat conviction into a mind habitually sceptical. When I ventured one more longing look at th* * Owner of the pony track,' he waa smoking a cheap agar, as if he had been used to the best Star de Naves throughout ail his pot-boy life, , I could iiot help but wonder why euch men WW* permitted to run a ' raoeoourse.' or why, owning one, he was not chained down, and all i valuables pnt carefully out of reach.

There ia little doubt bat that th* whole Itsry was written in Ibis city and wai a pure Imagination. I I suppose that a very large proportion of tbe Oaraon swriea were pretty much of the eame order. I omit from that signed statements by reputable men, for although they will at times make a statement on behalf oi another it is never without tbe content of the person quoted. I have done that myself and in view of possibilities have had consent to make statements on a certain line if necessary to maintain a position. With a thorougu understanding a* to a perecn's vie^s it is not I unoommon to have it said : ' Whatever you say in that line I will abide by, end if you tbink it advisable to make a statement for me do so, and I will abide bj it' Bach confidences are not given to every man. and it it quite out of the way to mike a man the mouth pieoe of abuse. ON TEE SAFE. ' From ths many reports cf the fight it ia easy to see tbat the msjority of the reporters were of tbe opinion that Corbett was sure of victory, and these men naturally watched Oorbett and what be did. To read these reports one would imagine t^st Fitzsimmons Was standing for half the tame witb his hsiude down and letting Corbett hit him at will Little is aaid about ths blows that Fitz must have sent in in return. Even taking fht report as it eame over the wire, eeut by tbe men at the other end from dictation, it was, to anyone acquainted with glove fighting, very soon apparent that Corbett would need a breather alter the fast fighting that he was reported to be doing. I was with a (eayB the 'Sporting Life' man) little company that waa receiving the report that waa published in all tbe evening papers, and when, the news of the sixth round came over the wire, aud made the Corbett men full of enthueieam for thair man, an old band at the game laid, 'Not toe fail, my boys, your man has got to take a breather vary eoon, and it even now looks to me ae if he was flighting himself oat If Fiiz can come back forthe next round I think be will win the fight,' It was about that time I remembered tbe views quoted in the ' Sporting Life ' as coming from one whom I said was one of t&e; best judges of fighting men in tbe city. This was to the effect: that if Fitz once got the upper hand of Coroett the latter would bs a beaten man, as he was not dead game. The result seemed to bear out exactly the opinion then erp'eessd. The fight hss removed tbe bogus 'gentleman' fighter from public view. Hereafter it Oorbett fight', be will not be accepted at his own estimate. Tbe man who spat in Fitz simmons' face while the letter's arms were held, the 1 Gentlemao Jim ' who taunted John L, Bullivan with unprintable epithets when Sullivan was at his mercy in the ring at New Orleans, th6 self-styled 1 jtentlemau ' whoee everyday language reeks of the slaag of the slums, will hereafter be known for what he really is — a common bruiser.

This is a question much asked of Ute by the tm washed. Tkotk doesn't care much what has become of 'tbe Bridge,' bnt prefers asking what will become of tbe other tracks f We fancy we can answer onreelVea, They will, like the Bridge, elbee for 'alterations and repairs.' Perhaps while tbe alterations and I repairs are going on some kind millionaire will set about repairing the stomachs, boots and clothes of the late aapporters of the Glebe Point rink. Thres years ago ' Dela ware' said 'the Bridge* would yet be desolate; and only inhabited by tho ghost* of the departed stiffs.
