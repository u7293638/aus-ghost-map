The Storyteller. Rab and His Friends. BY JOHN BROWN, M.D. FOUR-AND-THIRTY year ago, Bob Ainslie and I were coming up Infirmary-street, from the High School, our heads together, and our arms intertwisted as only lovers and boys know how or why. When we got to the top of the street, and tamed north, we espied a crowd At the Tron Church. " A dog-fight!" shouted Bob, and was off; and so was I, both of us all but praying that it might not be over before we got up ! And is not this boy-nature ? and human nature too I and don't we all wish a house on fire not to be out before we see it f Dogs like fighting; old lease says they "delight" in it, and for the best of all reasons; and boys are not cruel because they like to see the fight. They see three of the great cardinal virtues of dog or man—courage, endurance, and skill—in intense action. This is very different from a love of making dogs fight, and enjoying, and aggra> vating, and making gain by their pluck. A boy, be he never so fond of fighting, if he be a good boy, bates and despises all this, but he would have run off with Bob and me fast enough: it is a natural and not a wicked interest that all boys and men have in witnessing intense energy n action. Does any curious and finely ignorant woman wish to know how Bob* eye at a glance an* nounoed a dog-fight to his brain ? He did not, he could not, see the dogs fighting; it was a flash of an inference, a rapid induction. . The crowd round a couple of dogs fighting is a crowd mas culine mainly, with an occasional active, com passionate woman fluttering wildly round the outside, and using her tongue aud her hands freely upon the men, as so many " brutes;" it is a crowd annular, compact, and mobile ; a crowd centripetal, having its eyes and its heads all bent downward and inward, to one common focus. Well, Bob and I are up, and find it is not over: a small thoroughbred white bull-terrier is busy throttling a large shepherd's dog, unac* eustomed to war, but not to be trifled with. They are hard at it; the scientific little fellow doing his work in gnat style, his pastoral enemy fighting wildly, but with the sharpest of teeth and a great courage. Science and breeding, however, soon had their own; the Game Chicken, •s the premature Bob called him, working his way. up, took hisißnal grip of poor Yarrow's throat,—and he lay gasping and done for. His master, a brown, handsome, big young shepherd from. Tweedamulr, would have liked to knock down any man, would " drink up Bail, or eat a crocodile," for that part, if he had a chance. It was bo urn kicking the little dog; that would only make him hold the closer. Many were the means shouted out in mouthfuls of the best , possible ways of ending it " Water!" but there was none near, and many cried for it who might have got it from the well at Blackfriars Wynd. "Bite the tail!" and a large, vague, benevolent, ■riddle- aged man, more desirous than wise, with some struggle got the bushy end of Yarrow's tail into his ample mouth, and bit it with all his might This was more than enough for the muoh-enduring, much-perspiring shepherd, who, with a gleam of joy over his broad visage, de livered a terrific facer upon our large, vague, benevolent, middle-aged friend,—who went down like a shot. Still the Chicken holds; death not far off. 44 Snuff I a pinch of snuff!" observed a calm, highly-dressed young buck, with an eye-glass in his eye. «Bnuff, indeed 1" growled the angry crowd, affronted and glaring. « Snuff!" a pinch of anuff I" again observes the buck, but with moreurgency; whereupon wer* produced several ops* boxes, and from a mull which may have been at Culloden, he took a pinch, knelt down, and presented it to the nose of the Chicken. The laws of physiology and of snuff take their course; the Chicken sneeses, and Yarrow is free. The young pastoral giant stalks off with Yarrow in his arms,—comforting him. But the Bull Terrier's blood is up, and his soul unsatisfied; he grips the first dog he meets, and discovering she is not a dog, in Homeric phrase, he makes a brief sort of amende, and is off. The boys, with Bob and me at their head, are after him: down Niddry-street he goes, bent on mischief; up the Cowgate, like an arrow,— Bob and I, and our small men, panting behind. There, under the single arch of the South Bridge, is a huge mastiff, sauntering down the middle of the causeway, as if with his hands in his pockets: he is old, gray, and brindled, as big as a little Highland bull, and has the Shakespearian dewlaps shaking as he goes. The Chicken makes straight at him, and fastens on his throat To our astonishment, the great creature does nothing but stand still, hold himself up, and roar,—yes, roar; a long, serious remonstraUve roar. How is this ? Bob and I are up to them. Ht it muzzled/ The bailies had proclaimed a general muuling, and his master, studying strength and economy mainly, had encompassed his huge jaws in a home-made apparatus, constructed out of the leather of some ancient breeching. His mouth was open as far as it could; his lips curled up in rage,—a sort of terrible grin; his teeth gleaming, ready, from out the darkness ; the strap across his mouth tense as a bow-string; his whole frame stiff with indignation and surprise; his roar asking us all round, " Did you ever see the like of this T He looked a statue of anger and astonishment, done in Aberdeen granite. We soon had a crowd ; the Chicken held on. " A knife I" cried Bob; and a cobbler gave him his knife. You know the kind of knife, worn away obliquely to a point, and always keen. I put its edge to the tense leather, it ran before it; and then I-one sudden jerk of that enor mous head, a sort of dirty mist about his mouth, no noise,—and the bright and fierce little fellow is dropped, limp and dead. A solemn pause : this was more than any of us had bargained for. I turned the little fellow over, and saw he was quite dead : the mastiff had taken him by the small of his back, like a rat, and broken it He looked down at bis victim, appeased, ashamed, and amated; snuffed him all over, stared at him and taking a sudden theught, tamed roaod and trotted off. . Bob took the. dead dog up, and arid, "John, we'll bury him after tea." "Yes," said I, and was off alter the mastiff. He made up the Cowgate at a rapid •wing*; he had forgotten some «ngagement He turned up the Candlemaker Row, and stopped at the Harrow Inn. There waa a carrier's cart ready to start, and a keen, .thin, impatient, black-a-viMd little man, his hand at his gray hone's head, looking about - angrily for something. " fob, ye thief 1" said he, aiming a kick at my great friend, who drew cringing up, and avoided the heavy shoe with more agility than dignity, and, watching his master's eye, slunk dismayed under the cart, — his ears down, and aa much as hie had of tail down too. • , What a man this must be—thought I—to whom my tremendous hero turns tail! The carrier saw the muxsle hanging, cut and useless, from his neck, and I eagerly told him the. story, which Bob and I always thought, and still think, Homer, or King David, or Sir Walter alone were worthy to rehearse. The severe little man was mitigated, and condescended to say, "Bab ma man, puir Babbie;" whereupon the stump of a tail rose up, the ears were cocked, the eyes filled and were comforted; the ■ two. friends were reconciled. " Hupp!" and a stroke of the whip were given to Jess ; and off went the three. Bob and I buried the Game Chicken that night (we had not much of a tea) in the back green of his house in Melville-street, No. 17, with considerable gravity and silence ; and being at the time in the Iliad, and, like all boys, Trojans, we called him Hector, of course. Six years have passed,—a long time for a boy and a dog: Bob Ainalie is off to the war*; lam a medical student, and clerk at Minto House Hospital Rab I saw almost every week, on the Wednes day ; and we had much pleasant intimacy. X found the way to his heart by frequent scratching of his huge head, and an occasional bone. When I did not notice him he would plant himself straight before me, and stand wagging that bud of a tail, and looking up, with his head a little to the one aide. His master I occasionally saw { he used to call me "Maister John," but was laoonio as any Spartan. One fine October afternoon I was leaving the hospital, when I saw the large gate open, and in walked Rab with that great and easy saunter of his. He looked as if taking general possession of the place; like the Duke of Wellington entering a subdued city, satiated with victory and peace. After him came Jess, now white from age, with her cart; and in it a woman carefully wrapped up,—the carrier leading the hone anxiously, and looking back. When he saw me, James (for his name was James Noble) made a curt and grotesque "boo," and Mid, " Maister John, this is the mistress; she's got a trouble in her breast—some kind o' aa income * we're thinkin'." By this time I saw the woman's face; she was sitting on a sack filled with straw, her husband's plaid round her, and his big coat, with ita large white metal buttons, over her feet. I never saw a more unforgetable face, —pale, serious, lonely, delicate, sweet, without being; at all what we call fine. She looked sixty, and tyad on' a mutch, white as snow, with its black ribbon, her silvery, smooth hair setting off her dark gray eyes,—eye* such as one sees only twice or thrice in a lifetime, full of suffering, full also of the overcoming of it; her eyebrows black and delicate, and her mouth firm, patient, and eon* tented, which few mouths ever are. As I have said, I never saw a, more beautiful countenance, or one more subdued to settled auiet "Ailie," said James, "this is Maister John, the young doctor; Rab's freend, ye ken. We often speak aboot you, doctor." She smiled, and made a movement, but said nothing, and prepared to come down, putting her plaid aside and rising. Had Solomon, in all his glory, been handing down the Queen of Sheba at his palace gate, he oould not have done it more daintily, more tenderly, more like a gentleman, than did Jamas the Howgate carrier, when he lifted down Ailie his wife. The contrast of bis small, swarthy, weather beaten, keen, worldly face to hers, pale, subdued, and beautiful, was something wonderful. Rab looked on concerned and pucsled, but ready for anything that might turn up,—were it to strangle the nurse, the porter, or even me. Ailie and he seemed great friends. " As I was savin', she's got a kind o* trouble in her breest, doctor ; wull ye tak' a look at it T' We walked into the consulting-room, all four ; Rab grim and comic, willing to be happy and confidential if cause could be shown, willing also to be the reverse, on the same terms. Ailie sat down, undid her open gown and her lawn handkerchief round her neck, and, without a word, showed me her right breast. I looked at and examined it carefully; she and James watching me, and Rab eying all three. What oould I say ? There it was, that had once been so soft, so shapely, so white, so bountiful, so " full of all blessed conditions," hard as a stone, a centre of horrid pain, making that pale face with its gray, lucid, reasonable eyes, and its sweet resolved mouth, express the full measure of suffering overcome. Why was that gentle, modest, sweet woman, clean and loveable, con demned by God to bear such a burden ? I got her away to bed. " May Rab and me bide V said James. "You may; and Rab, if he will behave himself." " I'se warrant he's do that, doctor." And in slunk the faithful beast. ■ I wish you could have seen him. There are no such dogs now. He belonged to a lost tribe. As I have said, he was brindled and gray like Rubislaw granite; bis hair short, hard, and dose, like a lion's; his body thick-set, like a little bull, —a sort of compressed Hercules of a dog. He must have been ninety pounds' weight, at the least; he had a large, blunt head; his muszle black as night, his mouth blacker than any night, a tooth or two—being all he had— gleaming out of his jaws of darkness. His head was scarred with the records of old wounds, a sort of series of fields of battle all over it; one eve out, one ear cropped as close as was Arch bishop Leighton's father's; the remaining eye had the power of two; and above H, and in constant communication with it, mi a tattered rag of an ear, whioh was for ever unfurling itielf like an old flag; and then that bud of a tail, about one inch long,—if it could in any tense be •aid to be long, being at broad aa long,—the mobility, the instantaneousneas, of that bud were very funny and surprising, and it* ex pressive twinklings and winkings, the inter* communications between the eye, the ear, and it, were of the oddest and swiftest. Rab had the dignity and simplicity of great sue; and having fought his way all along, the road to absolute supremacy, he was as mighty in his own line as Julius Cesar or the Duke of Wellington, and had the gravity of all great fighters. You mast have observed the likeness of oertain men to oertain animals, and of certain dogs to men. Now, I never looked at Rab without thinking of the great Baptist preacher, Andrew Fuller. The same large, heavy, menacing, oom bative, sombre, honest oountenanoe, the same deep, inevitable eye, the same look, —aa of thunder asleep, but ready,—neither a dog nor a man to be trifled with. Next day my master, the surgeon, examined Ailie. There was no doubt it must kill her, and soon. It could be removed ;it might never return ;it would give her speedy relief; she should have it done. She courteaied, looked at James, and said, "When?" "To-morrow," said the kind surgeon, a man of few words. • She and James and Rab and I retired. I noticed that he and she spoke little, but seemed to anticipate everything in each other. The following day, at noon, the students came in, hurrying up the great stair. At the first landing place, on a small, well-known -blackboard, was a bit of paper fastened with wafers, and many remains of old wafers beside it. On the paper were the words, "An operation to-day. J. 8., Clerk." Up ran the youths, eager to seoure good places; in they crowded, full of interest and talk. "What's the case?" « Which aide is it ?" Don't think them heartless: they are neither better nor wosse than yon or I; they get over their professional horrors, and into their proDer work ; and in them pity, as an emotion, ending in itself, or at best in tears and a long drawn breath, lessens; while pity as a moth* is quickened, and gains power and purpose. It is well for poor human nature that it is so. The operating theatre is crowded; much talk and fun, and all the cordiality and stir of youth. The surgeon with his staff of assiatanta is there. In comes Ailie; one look at her quiets and abates the eager students. That beautiful old woman is too much for them; they sit down, and at* dumb, and gate at her. These tough boys feel the power of her presence. She walks in quickly, but without haste: dressed in her mutch, her neckerchief, her white dimity short gown, her black bombazine petticoat, showiag her white stockings and her carpet-shoes. Behind her was James with Rab. James sat down in the distance, and took that huge and noble head between his knees. Sab looked per plexed and dangerous ; for ever cocking his ear and dropping it as fast, Ailie stepped up on a seat, and laid herself oa the table, as her friend the surgeon told her ; arranged herself, gave a rapid, look at James, shut her eyes, rested herself on me, and took my hand. The operation was at once begun ; it was necessarily slow ; and chloroform—one of Qod's best gifts to his suffering children—was then unknown. The surgeon did his work. The pale faoe showed its pain, but was still and silent Bab's soul was working within him; he saw that something strange was going on, —blood flowing from his mistress, and she suffering; his ragged ear was up and importunate; he growled ana gave now and then a sharp, impatient yelp ; he would have liked to do something to that man. But James had him firm, and gave him a glower from time to time, and an intimation of a possible kick: all the better for James, it kept his rye and his mind off Ailie. It is over: she is dressed, steps gently and deoently down from the table, looks for James ; then, turning to the surgeon and the students, she courtesies, and in a low, clear voice begs their pardon if she has behaved UL The students—all of us—wept like ohildren ; the surgeon happed her up carefully ; aud, resting on James and me, Ailie went to her room, Rab following. We put her to bed. James took off his heavy shoes, crammed with tackets, heel-capped, and put them carefully under the table, saying, " Maiater John, I'm for nane o' yer strynge nurse bodies for Ailie. I'll be her nurse, and I'll gang aboot on my stockin' soles as canny as pussy." And so he did; and handy and clever, and swift and tender, as any woman was that horny-handed, snell, peremptory little man. Everything she got be gave her; he seldom slept; and often I saw his small, shrewd eyes out of the darkness fixed on her. As before, they spoke little. Rab behaved well, never moving, showing us how meek and gentle he could be, and occasion ally, in his sleep, letting us know that he was demolishing some adversary. He took a walk with me every day, generally to the Candle maker Row; but he was sombre and mild ; de clined doing battle, though some fit cases offered, and indeed submitted to sundry indig nities ; and was always very ready to turn, and came faster back, and trotted up the stair with much lightness, and went straight to that door. Jess, the mare, had been sent, with her w,eather-worn cart, to Howgate, and had doubt less her own dim and placid meditations and confusions on the absence of her master and Rab, and her unnatural freedom from the road and her cart. For some days AiHe did weU. The wound healed "by the first intention;" for, as James said, " Oor Ailie's skin ower clean to befl." The students came in quiet and anxious, and sur rounded her bed. Bhe said she liked to see their young, honest faces. The surgeon dressed her, and spoke to her in his own short, kind way, pitying her through his eyes, Rab and James outside the circle, —Rab being now reconciled, and even cordial, and having made up his mind thai as yet nobody required worrying, bat, as you may suppose, temper paratus. So far, wall: but, four days after the opeta* tfon, my patient bad a sadden and long shivering, a "grooshV," ai ahe called H. I aiw her aoon after; her eyes were too bright, Ver cheek oolored; the waa restless, and ashamed of being so; the balance waa loat; mhiehief had begun. On looking at the wound* a blush of red told the aeeret; her pulae waa rapid, bar breathing anxious and quick, ahe wasn't herself, aa she add, and waa vexed at her rsetlsssnua. We tried what we could. Jamea did everything, waa everywhere, never in the way, sever out of it Bab subsided under the table into a dark place and waa motionless, all bat hia eye, which followed everyone. Ailie got worae; began 4o wander in her mind, gently; was more eVmon* stratiye in her waya to Jamea, rapid ibr her questions, and sharp at times. He was vwped, and said, "She waa never that way afoM r no never." For a time she knew her head waa wrong, and waa always asking oar pardoa,-~the dear gentle old woman: then delirium.set in strong, without pause. Her brain gave way, uA then came that terrible spectacle,— The intellectual powar through word* and thfop' Want Mantling on iv dim and pariloos way: .•• I. she sang bits of old aonga and Psalms, stepping suddenly, mingling the Psalma of David, aiKHhe diviner words of his Son and Lord, with homely odds and ends and scrape of ballade. ' -> Nothing more touching, or in a aeose more strangely beautiful, did I ever witness. Her tremulous, rapid, affectionate*, eager Scdtoh voice,—the swift, aimless, bewildered mind, baffled utterance, the bright and perilous'eye ; some wild wordß, some household cares, tome* thing for Jamea, the names of the dead; Bab, called rapidly and in a "fremyt" voice, and'he starting up, surprised, and slinking off as if'he were to blame somehow, dr had been dreaming he heard; many eager questions and beaeeehnga which James and I could make nothing of; sod on which she seemed to set her all, and then sink back un-underatood. It waa very sad,' But better than many things that are not called Mid. Jamea hovered about, put out and miserable^ fcut active and exact aa ever; read to her, when there waa a lull, short bits from the Psalilis, prose and metre, chanting the latter in hb qrtrn rude and serious way, showing great knowledge of the fit words, bearing up like a mad, ajnd doatingover her as hia <rain Ailie." "AiUeVnia woman!" "Maainbonnie weedawti*!*' ' '" The end waa drawing on; the goldeti bbwl waa breaking; the silver cord waa fast being loosed: that anin*l* bUndula, vapula, kotgta, cowuaque, was about to flee. The body and soul—companions for sixty yean—were being sundered, and taking leave. Bhe was walktjig, alone, through the valley of the shadow itato ' which one day we must all enter,—and yet the waa not alone, for we know whose rod and staff were comforting her. . One night ahe had fallen quiet, and as w*)Ld hoped asleep; her eyes were abut We vat down the gas, and sat watching her. Suddenly she sat up in bed, and taking a bedgown which was lying on it rolled up, she held It eagertt to her breast,—to the right side. We could seelter eyes bright with surprising tenderness and toy, bending over this bundle ofefothes. She hefd it aa a woman holds her sucking child ; opening out her nightgown impatiently, and holding it close, and brooding over it, and murmuring foolish little-words, aa over one whom his mother comforteth, and who sucks and is satisfied. It was pitiful and strange to see her washed, dying look, keen and yet vague,—her immense love.* ■ " Preserve me 1" groaned Jamea, giving way. And then ahe rocked back and forward as U. to make it sleep, hushing it, and wasting on ii per infinite fondness. ' " "Wae's me. doctor; I declare abe'stkiaiu' it's that bairn?' , \^7T "Whatbairnr , . . ..„.. "The only bairn we ever had; our.,jree Mysie, and ahe'a in the Kingdom forty jean andmair." ',:»'• It waa plainly true; the pain in the breast telling its urgent story to a bewildered, rafted brain, waa misread and mistaken ; it suggested to her the uneasiness of a breast fall of mjlk, and then the child; and so again once more they were together, and ahe had her am wee Mysie in her bosom. This was the close. She sank rapidly t the delirium left her; but, as she whispered, ahe waa "clean •illy;" it waa the lightning before the final darkness. After having for some time kin still, her eyes shut, she said, "Jamea!" He came close to her, and lifting at> her calm, dear, beautiful eyes, she gave him a long look, turned to me kindly but shortly, looked for Rab, but could not see him, then turned to her husband again, at if she would never leave off looking,■■ shut her eyes, and composed herself. Uhe lay for some time breathing quick, and passed away so gently that when we thought she waa gone, James, in his old-fashioned way, held the mirror to her face. After a long pause, one small spot of dimness was breathed out; it vanished away, and never returned, leaving the blank, dear darkness of the mirror without a stain. " What is our life I it is even a vapor, which appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away." Rab all this time had been full awake and motionless ; he came forward beside us: Aijie'a hand, which James had held, was hanging down ; it was soaked with his tears ; Rab ticked it all over carefully, looked at her, and returned to his place under the table. \ Jamea and I sat, I don't know how long,'but for some time, saying nothing. He started up abruptly, and with some noise went to the trfble, and putting his right fore and middle fingers each into a shoe, pulled them out, and put them on, breaking one of the leather latcheta, and muttering in anger, "I never did the like o' that before V I believe he never did; nor after either. M Rab!" he said roughly, and pointing with hia thumb to the bottom of the bed. Rab leapt up, and settled himself, his head and eye to the dead face. " Maister John, ye'U wait for me," said the carrier, and disappeared in the darkness, thundering down stairs in his heavy shoes. I ran to a front window: there he was, already round the house and out at the gate, fleeing; tike a shadow. I was afraid about him, and yet not afraid; so I sat down beside Rab, and, being wearied, fell asleep. I awoke from a sadden noise out. aide. It was November, and there had been a fceevv fall of anow. Rab was *t stafo 9110; he Ksard the noise too, and plainly knew it, but never moved. I looked out; and there, at the fit*, in the dim morning,—for the bud was not up,—waa Jess and the cart, a cloud of steam rMng from the old mare. I did not see James ; ' he was already at the door, and came up the stairs, •jfti met me. It was less than three hours since ha left, and ha must have posted out—who knows how. f—to Howgate, full nine miles off; yoked Jess, and driven her astonished into town. He had *a armful of blankets, and was streaming -with perspiration. He nodded to me, spread out >*■ the floor two pain of olean old blankets, ; Isvrtog, at their corners, "A. 0., 1794," in large latter*, in red worsted. These were the initials of Alison Ontme, and James may have looked in 'Sjt 'her from without—himself unseen but not tmthought of-when he was "wat, wat, and weary,** and after having walked many miles ; over the hills, may have seen her sitting while ** a' the lave were sleepin';" and by the firelight working her name on the blankets, for her am James's bed. :. He motioned Rab down, and, taking his wife In his arms, laid her in the blankets, and happed : .«w Carefully and firmly up, leaving the face un covered ; and then lifting her, he nodded again v sharply to me, and, with a resolved but utterly .miserable face, atrode along the passage, and  down stairs, foUowed by Rab. I followed with • light; but he didn't need it I went out, .holding stupidly the candle in my hand in the eaim, frosty air; we were soon at the Rate. I , Ooo)d have helped him, but I aaw he was not to be meddled with, and he was strong, and did not . need it He laid her down aa tenderly, aa safely, as he had lifted her out ten days before,— , a* tenderly as when he had her first in his arms , .whan she was only "A. 0.," sorted her, leaving \- ftbat beautiful sealed face open to the heavena ; Mid than taking Jess by the head, he moved Away. He did not notice me, neither did Rab, who presided behind the cart „ 1 stood till they passed through the long •Mow of the College, and turned up Niobolson atreet I heard the solitary cart sound through the streets, and die away and oome again ; I returned, thinking of that company going up Libbarton Bras, then along Roelin Muir, the morning light touching the Pentlands and makinf them like on-looking ghosts; then down the hul through Auchindinny woods, past •♦haunted Woodhouselee;" and as daybreak feme sweeping up the bleak Lammermuirs, and fell on his own door, the company would stop, and James would take the key, and lift AOie up fcgain, laying her on her own bed, aad, having put Jess up, would return with Rab and shut the door. Jamas buried his wife with his neighbors j., mourning, R»b inspeoting the solemnity from a . distance. It wm snow, and that black, ragged aolw would look strange in the midst of the swelling, spotless cushion of white. James looked after everything ; then rather suddenly fell ill, and took to bed; waa insensible when the doctor came, and soon died. A sort of low .. Jsver was prevailing in the village, and his want of sleep, his exhaustion, and his misery made Aim apt to take it The grave waa not difficult tp reopen. A fresh fall of snow had again made all things white land smooth; Rab once more  looked on, and slunk home to the stable. And what of Rab ? I asked for him next week of the new carrier who got the good-will of James's business, and was now master of Jess ' and her cart "He put me off, and said rather rudely, "What's your business wi' thedowgt" ' I was not to be so put off. " Where's Rab!" He, getting confused and red, and intermeddling With his hair, said, '"Deed, sir, Rab's deid." "Dead! what did he die oft" "Weel, sir," Mid he, getting redder, "he didna exactly dee; fee was killed. I had to brain him wi' a rack ets } there was nae doin' wi' him. He lay in the treviss wi 1 the mear, and wadna come oot I tempit Urn wi' kail and meat, but he wad tak seething, and keepit me frae feedin' the beast, and he was aye gur gurrin', and grup gruppin' me by the legs. I was laith to make awa wi' the auld dawg, hia like wasna atween this and Thbrnhill,—but, 'deed, sir, I could do naething else." I betteved him. Fit end for Rab, quick and . eosßplets. His teeth and his friends gone, why Should be keep the peace and be civil?
