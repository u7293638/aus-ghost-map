A BUSII.M AN ON BUSHMEN. I To the Editor. 1 Sir-I'm a bushman-a real bush-man - one who has had more experience than any man nvat ever lived or ever will live, and what I want is to be put at the heaxl of this Bushmen's Corps. I got a bit mad 011 Saturday when I saw in the paper that I had a rival, who claimed to be the great est bushman. Iiwv he does gas! Does he want to pick a team of his own and run the show hisself with the help of a man in gaol, who proved he was a* go<.\ bushmau by wiping his face on his horse's tail. Fancy a bushman being that particular! Why, when I aud Tommy Walker and Weary Willy were in the "back blocks, we never wiped our faces for nine years. Wipe his face, indeed! We want no such blessed dandies for the Transvaal! My great 'ambition is not only to pick my baud oif men, but to lead them, and, by Great Caesar's Ghost, I reckon I'd bust up all the Boers in about three weeks. But 110 taking orders from Buller.-f, or Kitcheners, or llo bertses, or such small fry as that. I should just do things my way.. If after reading this letter the Government should-as, no doubt they will-send for me to form a company of bushmen, I shall not need to visit Central Australia, or even the gaols; in fact, I shall not have to go further than the list of those who have already volun teered. Among them are some of the grandest, hardest, and most experienced bushmen in this or any other country, and no nobler company has ever stepped into the field than will be picked from them. I am, fc?u' &c.;, ' TOiU COURAGE. Goodwood, January 21.
