TUESDAY, NOVEMBER-ii, 18!)3. There is decidedly an element of humour in the intelligence, published in our columns yesterday, that the new French Chamber, which only mot last Tuesday, has indulged already in the lukury of a crisis, and has put an end to the official existence ol' its own author, jr. DUI'UY. M. DUPUY is an ex schoolmaster, who, less than eight months ago, shot suddenly into fame and power as Premier of Franco ; or at least into such moderate degree of faino and power as tho uncertain politics of Frunce permit. Franco seemed bunk nipt of administrators who were at once clean-handed and capable, and M. CARNOT in despair laid hands on M. DUPUY. His Cabinet consisted of such absolutely unknown " items " that, ns was said at the time, it was " as if M. CARNOT had taken the " first ten Republicans that passed " under his window, and made out of " them a Cabinet." But M. DUPUY devoloped that most usoful of all quali- ties'in'a politician, a faculty of sur- viving. Ho outlived the Panama scandals ; ho defeated successive com- binations of hostile "groups" in the Chamber itself ; and he was supposed to havp fairly swept Franco at the general elections. Tho new Chamber, it was believed, was his personal pro- perty, or was, at least, ovorwhclmingly in his favour. All the other groups in tho Chamber ivero efl'accd. Duona partists and Monarchists were smitten hip and thigh; the ingenious politicians who tried to exploit the Panama scan- dals to their own political advantage were ground to powder. M. CLKMEN CEAU failed, oven on the second ballot, to secure a seat, and M. Duruy rode tiiuiiiphaut, a sott oC political Noah, on tlio flood which hod subiiioigod all his innis Lut in 1 rcnch politics tho only thing ccitam is-unccitainlj ïho deluded 1 lench I'rcnuci intet vicwod what was supposed to bo his docile and enthusiastic Ghamboi last luesdnj, anti that body limiiediatel) pioceodcd to mveit the fable of SAIUKN and his oflspnng It dcstiojed, that is, tho authôi of its own existence i 'Ilie usual cusís occuued , tho Ministi) lins vanisliod, M CARNOI lins nnder taken a new pilgi imago in seaich of a Viemiei, and thebewildcicd I\l Dunn is left to meditato on the mutability of caitilly politics Iwonotveiy distill gtushed Î.ouch stntosmeii have alieadj íefused the alippeiy and peulous omi nenco oilercd to them and the Pie miciship of I lance-one of the gicatest posts the modem woild has to otlei - piactically goes a begging 'JhesofnctspiotuthatFiciichCabinots, Uko hot honso plants, oailv aspuagus, and othei Icndci foi ms of life, die soon not to say often , and they d10 on ami/itigly slight piovocatiou Amongst out.oh es South Austral) in Cabinets oil ei, poiliaps, the most sti iking cxamplo of tondei and tiansitory existence J he sister colony is j oung , but the pioces sion of its Cabinets, foi length, speed, and genciol tcnuitj, leseinblcs nothing so much as a pi ocession of ¿hosts 1 hti L IS moi e than one e\amplo in South Ansli than hisloiy of a JVlmisti > -which has boon boin, has leached its lusty punie, his sunk into dotago and second childhood mid peiishctl of men senility - and al' in thuconipassof thtcc weeks1 One Alim-li}, indeed, is on lecoid which lasted eleven dajs uuolhci ten dujs, and jet anothei nine dajs1 One South Austialum Cabinet is known lo funo as "the clean "shut Munstij," mid tiadition-pel haps with that economy of ti nth usual in tiaditioiib-îepoits that this title is duo to the ciioutnst mee that the piotul and happy I'leimoi who hail taken office went homo to do honoiti to Ins new dignity by putting on a clean shut, and when he lctuined to the House found himself in a minoiitj and had to olhciallj expno ' J lench Miuisliiet, it is tiue, do not mai eh on lo the bingo, and then bun y oil again with this bienthlcss speed, but «ant of stability is the cuiso of 1 tench politics Cabinets comeandgo like phantom.

The prisoner also stands committed to the present criminal sittings along with her hus- band, Rudolph Knorr, charged with the murder of a male child, name unknown, found buried in a yard at the rear of 25 Davis-street, Brunswick, on the 5th September last; and further, with her husband as accessory before the fact, with the murder of a female child found buried in the same yard. The prisoner, who was exceedingly pale when she entered the court, was plainly dressed in a dark cos- tume. She was given a seat in the dock, where she very composedly followed the wit- nesses from a typewritten copy of the deposi- tions. Mr. Walsh, Q. C., briefly opened the case for the Crown, showing how, according to the evidence, the prisoner had entered a house at Brunswick in which she clearly did not intend to remain, taking a young baby with her; how she borrowed a spade from a neighbour; how the baby was never seen again; and how a subsequent tenant found the remains of a female infant buried underneath a few inches of soil in the back garden. Mr. Walsh also produced a letter which the prisoner, after her arrest, had contrived to write to "Ted Thompson," whom she asked to carefully "manufacture" certain evidence on her behalf, pointing out the possibility of a "life sentence" or a "long sentence," and urging him to take charge of her two children in such an event.
