Original Poetry. BOTANY BAY FLOWERS. [The following lines were written on reading a worthless collection of colonial poetry entitled Botany Bay Flowers, written by Barron Field, Esq., late Judge of the Su- preme Court of New South Wales.] 'Tis strange to see a Justice turning poet; And writing doggrel verse! 'Tis passing strange! 'Tis wondrous pitiful, Judge Field! I'll show it From some quotations! You ascend the range Of Mount Parnassus! Mr. Justice, no! it Will never do! Down! Down! When once the mange Of rhyming doth infect a Judge's skin, He'll scratch for ever if he once begin. I've seen in drug-shops flowers of camomile And flowers of brimstone for our brother Sawney. Jalap in flowers comes from some Indian isle; 'Tis a good purgative when mixed with honey. Some flowers are good for physic--some for bile, While some, though prized, are scarcely worth your money. But "Botany Bay Flowers," one grain for a dose, Would make a badger vomit, I suppose. The Ghost of antient Bavius stood ashamed, When the said flowers arrived from Botany Bay; And MÃ¦vius by the bard of Mantua famed, Stormed like Hibernians on St. Patrick's day; And Pluto had not soon the tumult tamed, Had he not thrown the Judge's flowers away. "These filthy flowers," they cried, "pollute the place, We sha'n't stay here, great Pluto, in disgrace." In Pluto's realm there ne'er was such a kick up; (You'll read it in his Government Gazette,) Even Cerberus himself caught a vile hiccup From barking at the uproar. Nay, so beset With sickness was the cur, he would not lick up His own sweet vomit, and his three heads met Like Quakers at a meeting. Nay, old Charon Vow'd he'd ne'er ferry o'er more flowers for Barron.
