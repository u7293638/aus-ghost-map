Time had mel lowed him somewhat, however, and there was a softer expression on his face. - ' I Strangely enough, these • two had become friends. Though that Clirismas Eve was never mentioned by either—though, both had left Balph Bandolph's name unspoken—she had. shown to hitn, by a woman's subtle -ways, her regret and repentance: ' —• > Seeing this, and: understanding horj her hod learned t> judge the beautiful > woman*-less harshly. ,He had drifted into-aclose friend ship.withher, and > had a vague hope that time, might.rigbfcaU things. , He was so.raucli.older > tluui she -and,so. well known to<bo, enlisted, beyond all possibility of > desertion,; in the ranks of bachelorhood, tliat their intimacy excited no > remark.- .... , ; -• r,; , ' Ealph:/Pandolph had. gone abroad a few days after that Cliristmas Eve..
