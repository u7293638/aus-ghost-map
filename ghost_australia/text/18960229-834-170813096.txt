THE COLLAPSE OF THE OPPOSITION. ATTEMPTED RESDCITATION. A Straight Out Opinion. On Mr Drake's Speech. A Dead Party. Only Two Real Parties. Government and Labor. : The Brisbane ' Courier' in referring to Mr Drake's speech on the. remnant of tlie Opposition and their chances, says : â€” ' It was only in the last few minutes of the ? discourse that Mr Drake made some attempt to expound the future policy 'tofi the , Opposition, and to define the Upposition attitude in the elec-; tions. But all that was given was not worth' waiting for.: The only notable feature of it was that the Opposition proposes to itself the' task of checkmating some mysterious ex-, ploitation party. If we understand him, this party '.has its headquarters in Great. Britain, and its baleful policy is to first ex- i ploit, then ruin, and finally desert young1 countries. And it haj its evil eye on Queens-; land. The Opposition has its eye on the exploitation party, so Queensland is safe.! The electoral attitude of the Opposition is to go straight forward. It is to have noth ing to do with other parties. It will not even recognise ' Independents:' But there was a suggestive silence and softness in re gard' to the Labour party. The note of indignation in Mr Power's Maryborough speech was absent from last night's deliver ance. Evidently Opposition candidates are relying a good deal on the Labour yotel. The country at large will do well, we think, to look upon the Opposition as a dead party. Let it join its beloved ghosts of '1888*.' The two real parties with real politics are the Ministerialists and the Labour- Socialists The choicc'thatis to determine the political history ot the next three .years is between them.
