STORIES. Komfy and the Nino. Picture a long, rolling sea, and a low. stormy sky ; light up the westward with a baleful glow as if a furnace door, leagues wide, were flung open ; switch across a tibia band of black purple where the lurid clonds join the sea; coverall the water with a Bheet of rushing spray like steam ; then imaginea hot. roaring wind, driving a tumbled bid ship along with a snow-white bed of foam ever rolling from" the bows ; and you have the Ariadne, with Monte Video for the purple streak astern, and the hot " pampero" blowing. The ship was the last afloat or in a wrecker's yard to take to herself such a name. She was a rusty, paint-begrudged old barque; hog-backed, too. Her sail6 were ill- fitting, and patched in every seam ; at present she did not show much of them. Her inky-black spars were nearly ' stripped. She rolled and plunged, creaked and groaned, while the crew snugged her down for the gale. They matched the ship. The men in the waist had stopped with the ropes half coiled on the pins. Something had happened. They were staring aft at the ship's officers, and they in their turn were staring over the captain's shoulders into the cabin. A little mite of A girl, not more than four years old, sat on the locker under the skylight, and soberly gazed at ihelieads in the doorway. , She had a bright blue cloak around her, and a vivid yellow handkerchief over her curls, and tied under her chin. It wa6 like the setting of a bunch of flowers in a marine store. Now this ship of all sliiips was branded " tramp," from her copperless. keel to her paintless truck. Since daybreak all hands hqd been, trimming the ship to run. and here was breakfast time, and the ship snugged down—and a passenger! Never before bad one crossed her deck or stowed a trunk in her cabin. And here was one below, and that one, .of all people, a helplt-SB child! " Where did you come from ? Who brought you here ?" gasped the old man, at the little yellow-decked head. "Jnnie tookedme, an' I'm Belle Steve, d* injwieer's nin.o," eaid; the little one with confidence. ; The old epan rubbed his nose mopped his hot face. " Well!" turnikg to ; his officers, " this is a bare polesarcher. Jffobpdyinow.? Here, Komfy, smart, you limb o£ the dark." " Ise coming, Bah," and the black cook hurried from the galley. " Who's this ?" " Lady passenger, sah !" " Can't I see ? But who in thunder broughther on board ?" , " Ladf bro't her at daybreak. Said us take mos' big care of her. So promised, sah." " You addle-headed nigger. Why didn't you tell her we ara't a passenger boat 1 Why didn't you fetch me ?" "'Sense me,'sab ; you mighty busy in de dark, an' de lady said all ber baggage in your cabin' waiting her ina." ' "Utter nonsense.

"Some silly woman has taken. us for the Enropa, and ber£ we ate howling out to sea and not a ghost of a chance to pnt back. Whew ! Let's think it out."'

She leapt, and reeled, find burst shuddering through the rolling seas. The " pampero" screamed and whistled through the weather-beaten cordage. Men splashed along the flooded decks in 6hort runs, when the watch time came, to relieve the wheel; and the men from the wheel crept limp and aching to the fo'e'rie. In the cabin the little nino lay in the berth watching with wide-open eyes the black shadows from the lamp crawl to and fro on the deck above. She heard the dull thuds of the sea breaking over the stern; now and ngain sliort rushes of heavy-booted men, and the flinging do»n of ropes answered loud orders roared on deck. Ever and again wet oilskincovered men came in. Then the nino's eyes closed, for the men came softlv— though the old ship's timbers creaked and groaned terribly—a->d gently fastened the bedding more securely in the new bunk,' At last the tired eyes closed in earnest, and Belle fell asleep without fear. She had been born on the Pampas, and the town girl's little trick of questioning was not hers. She had only seen implicit obedience to her father's orders. And" Belle/had ccme down the noble Parana River a thousand miles, with a kiss from her father, to sail with ber mother.. Surelv the little nino was not afraid to be among those sailorfi after passing down the river with half-savages. And the wind and plunging strip 1 What were they after the dark, trackless forests brooding under the noonday sun ? And the night time, *hen they were on fire for leagues, and wild thing6 howled and screamed and fought on the banks, and swam round the boat with gleaming eyes ? They had told her to sleep then, and she had slept. 'You must be a good nino," her father had said. So,Belle was a good nino. The morning broke, and the ship had outrun the "pampero." Aloft and on the decksthe menwere busy covering the naked spars with swelling sails. The rising sun' brightened the smoke eddying from the galley chimney. It rose higher, and crept under the foot of the foresail, and; every time the old ship stooped her. -old : square bows, a flash of light swept into thejjalley. Komfy was there, resplendent in a soldier's red coat and white belt. It was Sun-. day morning. . He" wais eoratching bis wool in . deep perplexity.

The ^limejtbed' .ttoj ta^^lA It was wonderful to see the big, knotted brown hands of the skipper patpatting so gently the little rosy back. Belle was dried, and sat on a reefer waiting orders. The two old oen were staring at one another and then at the little heap of clothes. They were lost in diBtiay. The skipper whispered—at least he meant to, but it was a goodtoned rumble—" Which came off last ?" " Dundo," said the mate, rubbing his chin. Belle said, "Please may I put my things on ? " Both men slapped one another's knees. " Now, there's a clipper for you!" and forthwith made a fence of their big fiats round her. for the ship was still rolling. The dressing difficulty . wae no sooner got ov^r than another cropped up. Komfy reported " No milk !" But this was triumphantly got over in the same way. The li tie one could drink coffee and eat bacon. '•Well," said .the old man, as he turned in, " things don't look so black windward now." • Belle went on deck in the cook's arms. She shouted with delight as the seas rolled up andswept along the old ti aula's sides. And when duty called Komfy to his galley, wasn't there the whole fo'c'sle crowd waiting to train as nurses ?—sea nurses, that is. That afternoon the sailiuaker entered the cabin as a dressmaker. He had much advice, though but lit<1e material. However, there were some odd r«*uinants of bunting lying in the lockers, and what was laoking in style wa« made up in color. The ship steadily pbuajhed her easting to get the S.E. traces. As the days went by the nino became a centre from which all things were ruled. - It was a f dirty, day: ^elLtbe liest hands were at ithe wheel, dogging, the old square ihrough the seas, as dry as diy conld be.

Then the hoarse voice, of the skipper would roll along the dark deck. " Bedtime, Belle Steve's nino ! Lay along, Komfy. Steady at the wheel while she comes." It was Komfy's part to march aft and hand her to the skipper, solemnly salute, and return his coat to i*s box, ready for the next day. It came to the last day of the easting, and sorrow came on board. The sky whs full ot dragons that night, and the niuo was tired. In the morning her breakfast was untouched. Komfy was deep in woe. •• L'ee made it clar an' juicy, whof fo' you no eat Him ?" But the little head was weary. It was hot. too, and wanted to keep it down. That afternoon found the old man and the qpates sitting round the bei'th, helpless as children to face the trouble. The nino was delirious and talking fast in a strange tongue. The niedicine chest was open upon the floor, and exposed its shameless array of empty holes and half-filled bottles. The old man turned the leaves of the medicine-book with his big, rough thumb. » "Now, if it was only yellow-jack or cholera—see, we could just mix up for that—is there enough in that one ? " But it ain't," broke in the mate. " It's likely one of them cursed shore fevers/' £le turned round and replaced the clothes the little restless hands threw olf. The old man cloned the book and sat staring across the cabin, ruefully shaking his head. There came a patter of bare feet, and Komfy's big frame loomed dark against the twilight streaming through the cabin door. " Cap'n, ship away to wind'ud, big ship, an' mos' shoahof doctah !" The old man seized the glasses, but the mate took them from him and sprang up the rigging in big lifts./ •'Make sail, sir," he hailed down. "She's, a passenger , boat,' dead true." And he came swinging down the rigging.' Then the old man's voice broke cut, and the hands below tumbled out and-leaped aloft. "More sail! Another Bweat on the sheet forward there. Stand along, you holjrgrnb scoffers 1 Another sweat on the main tack. Smart now! all together, make your ' bowline screech forward thfere, I tell yon. Lift it, lift It. That's the sj^le.

Before another ten minutes had passed, a skilful hand was feeling the little wrist and smoothing the hot brow, while the grizzled old skipper and his mates gathered, round the little ship thai labored so heavily in the sea of fever. Hope and fear, fear and hope, chased one another in the dingy cabin. Hope at last drove fear away to the dragons and the dark, wet night. " We'll tow" the little ship into port, yet. Captain, some hot blankets." " Aye, aye. Hot blankets'tis pir J" And away they rushed, and the sparks swirled up from Komfy's chimney. There was running of men like powder monkeys, with the blankets rolled tight and hot under their jackets. " Captain," 6aid the doctor, in a lull, " you've given us a terror of a chose. We're the Europa, and have this little one's mother en board. Don't signal who you are till we get this nino standing into port." " Aye, aye." And through the night the meii Bat round the doctor, as the little brow grew moist and the little hands grew quiet, they nodded and slapped one another's knees. Komfy at the door, seeing this, passed the news forward in a how] of triumph. And from the Danes, Finns, Swedes and English of the forecastle, a rolling cheer went across the night to the shadowy ship beyond. Back in its proper time the answering echo, for it is the law of the Goth crowd that a cheer must be answered by a cheer, and a blow br a blow, the second one being heavier than the one received. When the sun leapt up (there was not a dragon in the sky) the mother was on board the old tramp. She was kneeling by the little berth, crying and laughing by tarns, and kissing the little brown hands. * The two ships were heading for San Roche together ; the big clipper with shortened sail to keep pace with the old, square-bowed tramp. Three days thus, and then the Ariadne's rigging was covered with l«er crew cheering three times three to Belle as they carried her np the- big ship's side. And all the time the little nino watched the red co&t; in jthe rigging until it wais lost amidst the patched and dingy huddle of the old tramp's sails dropping astern. ; ; At sunset the clopds were packed on the horizon, and the distant ship seemed to.lose..its way among them and- disappear. A cloud high np took pn to. itself :), red glow from the ;6£tting , suo; The nino cried to her mother," See, d' dragons have: swallowed all bnt Komfy, See, see, he's climbed.np the sky to fight dem.
