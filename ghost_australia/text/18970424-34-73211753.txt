This school, which was at ^dod by nearly aU the Baptist ministers in toouti Australia, was held in cooneotion with the Sooth Australian Baptist Ministers' Union. J.nree sessions each day were held on throe successive days, when subjects of a literary, critical, theological, and practical nature were discussed. Hie inaugural address was mven a7 ^li?6^ a Bri«ht (President of the South Australian Baptist Union) on 'Jesus Christ, the aABwer of God to the instincts and hopes -X 'humanity.' In eloquent terms the speaker claimed that great gain had accrued to the Christian Church through the work of the 'Higher critics,' especially in tbo fact that every book of the New Testament was proved to have been written in the first century. He admitted that the celebrated analogy of Bishop Butler, written to meet the deism of last centory, did sot meet the objections urRed to-day. The disciples of Jesus Christ rested upon His own words and found that Jesus is God's answer to man's hopes and aspirations. One afternoon was devoted to 'James BuBsel Jewell, America's (rreat humorist poet.*' Readings and recitals by members of the school, supplemented an exceedingly able paper by the Rev. J. H. Sexton on the subject. Tbtee thoughtful ex positions o& 'Isaiah i his tines a&dois; teach ing,' by the Kev. J. S. Raws, were of exeat educational value. A synopsis of Dr. Fair bairn's great book. 'Christ in Modem Theology,' by the Sev. J. Baynter, was . a contribution of a high order. Other subjects dealt with were : — 'Christian eschatology,' by the Rev. W. Bell M.A.; 'Ramsay's Church in the Boman Empire,' by the Ber. C. Bright ; ' Pastpral visitation,'' by the Bev. E. J. Henderson ; 'The Ho Spirit,' by the Rev. R.

Steward, 'Zoroas- trianiam ;' and the Bev. A. Mettsts, 'Moham- medanism.*' The summing up on 4C Gompaxa* five religion' by the Bev. C Bright was the chief feature of the school. In ao address last ing overas an hour and a half Sit Bright went fcrtfchfttinnfcrTTTi—tpT^ftnf thoiiiral fllJiim HjpiiUinin^ Chiefly those OX ftfr*hwniii^» vn*A Tt«rt^hi«fn showing the relation of these principles to all human attempts to «'TVm the facts of lite usiverseandofhumsalife. The ?various forma of faith may change, but the religions spirit must remain. The awrwwwit^p up was ooobhided in an eloquent r»»«vatifTn on ™* inrwiropftTaWft* person and rtrarartter .of Jesus Christ. His principles are essential to the bmldiogapof a perfect character among men, and ate abso lutely necessary for any true life. Apart from His principles society cannot be beld together. Should there ever come a time when tiuciety would not need ncfateoosness, purity, 3usticev love then it would not need' Jeans Christ. He is the real need of humanity^' and that was tie reason why Jesus died and why He lives to - effect Ss purpose. A largely attended i»hhi»««i service, at which the Bev. XL H.
