Select Poetry. FALLEN LEAVES. I LOVE to steal my way Through the bright woods, when autumn's work is.dohe, And through the tree-tops ell the dream-liko day Breathe the soft golden enn; When all in bushed and.still, Only a few Jast leaves, fluttering slow Down the warm air with ne'er a breeze's will— * A ghost of sound below; When nought of song i« beard, Save the jay laughing while nil nature grievest Or the lone chirp of some forgotten bird Among the fallen leaves. Around me everywhere Lie leaves that trembled green the summer long, Holding ihe'rainbow's tears in sunny air, And.roofed the summer song. Why shnn my stepB to tread These silent hosts that •every where are strewn, As if my feet were walking among the dead, ; -' And I alive Alone P . Hast no bright trees, 0 Past! Through whose bare boughs, once green, the '. sunshine grieves f No hopes that fluttered in the autumnal blast, No memories—Fallen Leaves 1 J. J. PIATT.
