CHILDREN'S INQUIRY COLUMN. Ella.—Would you kindly explain the meaning of John xx. 23— Whosesoever sinB ye remit, they are remitted unto them; 44 and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained." Our Saviour had just given the Holy Ghost in an especial manner to His apostles, and chose these words as an encouragement to them in their future service. They were a promise of His support in their actions, seeing they were now peculiarly fitted for the work before them, which was to proclaim the terms on which human beings mav be forgiven—Lukt' xxiv 47. This they did. (See Acts iv. 10—12; v. 29 -32; xvi. 31; Heb. v. 9; 2 Peter i. 1—4; 1 John ii. 12; Jude xxij Paul received a similar commission (Acts xxvi, 18), and fulfilled it (Acts xiii. 38), and in various parts of his epistles, as in Eph. i. 7, &c.; That the disciples never attempted to forgive sin on their own responsibility, is evident from their precept and example; for even Peter told Simon the sorcerer, " Repent, therefore, of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven tbee."—Acts viii. 22 Their teaching is in accordance with that of the entire Bible: namely, God alone can forgive sin, and Christ did it, because He was " God manifest in the flesh " This column is intended to assist young people in the study of the Bible, and their efforts at Christian service. All letters in connection with it should be ad&ressed; to me at the Colonist Office, Leigh-street. THALIA CURTIS.
