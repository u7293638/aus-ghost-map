THE HUMOURIST. Pug&ley; .: 'Wonder what's the matter 'with the mails. Something ought to be done to see that letters reachr their destination* M^Jiggs : ^ Why, what's the trouble?' Pugsley: 'That's just what I want to find out. I've been sending poetry to the new York magazines rc^ularlv for the last. six months, and not a line of it has been pub lished, yet. I'm going to write to Washington and find out, if I can, where all my letters have gone to.' Mrs. Pneumonie : ' I was so provoked at the art. museum to-day. There -was a painting there which thej. told me was painted by; a jnan ?by,, the name of Murillo. If you believe me, it ivas only a copy of that beautiful chromo of ours over the parlour mantel ! I don't know who this Murillo is, but I think it's shameful '{hit he should be allowed thus to cheapen -works of ait; and I Jidn't hesitate to let the people know just how I felt about it.' By thrift he had become a millionaire, and he had a splendid St. Bernard dog which he was very proud of. One day the servant came to him ' horror-stricken. ' Master, master 1 Caesar is ? ' 'Is what?.' 'Mad! .He won't touch 'water, and.he foams from the mouth constantly.' 'Great heavens i It is lucky. you discovered it in time. You must not lose a minute. Take the animal at once, before he has bitten any one^ — r' 'Yes. eir.' 'And sell him ! '—From the French. A general, on his return from the ware,' showed his family a regimental flag, all tattered and torn and riddled, with bullets, which lie had captured from the enemy with his own hands. On the following morning the trophy was to be presented to the General Gomnianding-in-Chief. When he came to look for the flag his industrious house keeper brought it to him with a smile of 2-roud satisfaction, aud said, ' What a job I've had, but I managed it ; I sat up all night and mended that . old flag, and it now looks nearly as good as new.' A debate was held in the schoollicmse at Bar boursville, Ky., the other evening, the proposition being *? Resolved, that fire is iriore useful than -water.' After a heated discussion of two hours the matter went to the referee, who, being a mar ried man with a large family, declined to decide the question. Then revolvers were drawn and there was every prospect of a lively time until a cool-headed person moved that a conference com mittee of two from each side, with the referee as the fifth member, should adjourn to the hotel and endeavour to arrive at a settlement. This carried, the committee withdrew, and in half ao hour returned, presenting the following paper :— '.'.As a compromise, your committee has unanimously determined in favour of fire- water.” An old Scotch fisherman, who happened to cross the Atlantic Ocean in one of the liners during the recent heavy cyclone, was recounting his adven- tures to a small circle of acquaintances in his native parish who had gathered to give him a kind of welcome home. Among these the parish minister had dropped in to see his old friend, and listened with great interest to the tales recounted by the. traveller just returned. “ Ay,” said the old fisherman, “ we had an awfu’ time o’t comin’ ower again. There we were, wi’ the wind blawin’ like a hurricane, and the seas sweepin’ ower the deck, and tho’ we were gaun full speed we hardly moved forritt, the win’ wis sae strong against us. And we rolled about in the sea like a cork, liken’ to gang to the bottom every meenit.” “ Ay, but,” said the minister, wishing to put in a word in season, “ there was ane at the helm.” “ Yin at the helm ! ” exclaimed John, in amazement. “ Man, yin couldna’ even haud it ! There wis eicht o’ them.” _________________________________________ It is said that a new beadle of Tranent, not many years ago, received an order to have a grave ready for a burial on the second day follow- ing. The morning arrived, and with it came intimation that the parties had changed their minds, and were to bury in a different church- yard. Terribly excited, the new man hurried off to the old man (his predecessor). “ D’ye ken onybody that’s deid, Jock ?” inquired he. “ What’s wrang noo ? ” rejoined the old hand ; “ you look as if you had seen a ghost.” “ No, but I have a toom grave, and naebody to put intilt.” “ My conscience,” exclaimed he, “ an empty grave and no a corpse for it. Well, mony a time in my day the Doctor has sworn in his wrath to drive me out o’ the kirkyaird for not having the grave howkit when the corpse arrived, but a case like yours I never before heard tell o’. Noo, I dinna ken o’ onybody deid ; but I ken that Jenny M‘Leish, o’ the Auld Wynd’s dein’. Gang owre and see if she hasna ‘ pappit’ awa’ yet, and if she’s no deid jist gang doon an’ drive the Doctor’s black soo intilt ; when the mound’s made the Doctor’ll no’ ken the difference.” Strange as it may appear, the black sow which used to run in the kirkyaird, was amissing next day, and though a liberal reward was offered for the recovery of the stolen property, it was never discovered. __________________________________________ The train was just pulling put of Westori, New Mexico, lor 8t Joe, when one of the passengers in the smoker put his head so far but of the window . that a man felt it his duty to Viittefa note of warn ing: '',X?P» tt w,a little rUky,' f^pUed|the man, as.he piilled. in h(s head and,6at down,'butl was looking for a grave in that field.
