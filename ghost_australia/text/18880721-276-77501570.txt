You are ray only son, Max... If anything should happen to you,; I-I should die. You must give up the hope of searching out Arthur Ilnrlliurst and holding him accountable," . she faltered. ? " 1 will trace him and find out what lie is to Florabel if it costs me my life'," lie answered, bitterly. '"He is in Sydney, niother," lie went oil, huskily. " I have traced him here ; sooner or later we shall meet." . . - . "I pray Heaven you may not," an swered Mrs. Forrester, fervently. i " The following "day, as Max stepped from a cabs' the first person whom he-met was Gerald Thorndyke, his ,old collegfe friend. . -.

"Fate has taken,:all choice in the mat ter out of my hands," hc 'repliecl, with much, embarrq^sriieht. ' "The heiress broke olf;tKe.. engagement, with me ; and "the girl fov whora I would have renounced; a .fortune refused me point blank, with scorn and derision, then suddenly disap peared. I have been trying to discover her whereabouts aver since." / . , - Gerald . Thorndyke knew his friend's" (Strict notions of honor too well to tell him ?exactly how the affair had happened; iudoed, it was a source of deep annoyance to recall the matter at all, all save* that' pa rt: of it relating'tb Florabel. '! : : " ITo doubt yoti censure me, Forrester for admiring oho when I was engaged to another, but if you had seen Miss Vane you would nob thave. marvelled at-(that. Whyj she was as beautiful as a dream, with a beauty at once peculiar and strik ing. Her face, was as fair as a lily; her dimpled cheeks like two pink .roses ; and her eyes-it would take a painter or a poet to describe them- they were of a rich hazel, wonderfully pathetic ; and the little head was crowned with a mass of j curling,, golden hair. Why, heavens! Forrester, what is the matter ? You look as pale as a gho3t." "A ghost of the past has just risen up to confront me. Do you know, Thorndyke, you have described accurately-my wife ! I did not believe the round woUd held one j like her. . You shall see her picture, and you can judge for yourself. No doubt but you have heard my story ; the news papers have aired it pretty thoroughly."" "Yes, I have heard -of it," replied Thorndyke, extending his hand and grasp ing 'that of Max in earnest sympathy; " but I hope all will come out right in the cud." ' " Never !" declared Max, firmly. T As lie spoke he took the portrait from his breast pocket and. handed it across'tlie, table to his friend. . One glance, then Gerald Thorndyke sprang to his feet with a startled cry. , "My God! am I mad, or do I dream ?" he cried, excitedly. "No. no, my senses are not playing me false; this is the por trait of Miss Vane! Even her name, in her own delicate chirograph}', is beneath jt-Florabel. Do you mean to tell me this-this-is your vjifc, Forrester?" he said, -his voice husky with agitation. "Yes," ronlied Max, wonderingly. _ >' Theii, by- all that is wonderful, I declare solemnly this is the same young Pirl I know as Miss Vane-Florabel Yane," said Gerald, white to the lips but not more white than Max. " This is the girl with whose lovely facc I-fell madly in love at first sight." Max had sprung to his feet in intense amazement. " I do not comprehend what you say, cried Max, hoarsely. "Make this thing -clear to me, Thorndyke." .. "I will," replied .Gerald. " Calm your self. -* Sit down and.listen. .1 willtellyou alland he tolcl him briefly .and truth fully the story of Miss .Carlisle's accident, which had brought her aiid the beautiful young stranger together, and all that had transpired1 since. i - i : ; ^ " It is but two.days.since that you saw iter in. the park, you say ?" gasped Max. .'

He walked into the.reading-room of the -hotel; and-threw himself down into an arm-chair near the window. A young man sat opposite him,. glaucing eagerly down the columns of a newspaper. ; . ; '.
