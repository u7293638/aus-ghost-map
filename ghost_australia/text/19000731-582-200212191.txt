. A PRIZE STORY. , . /We have received from the proprietor of the ,'Stawell News,' through Messrs Gilo. Robertson and .Oo.'i n copy of " Luke Mivers' Harvest," an Australian story, which was awarded the prize of L100 offered by the ' Sydney Mail.' for which there were between 61). and 76 competitors. The tale has so many qualities- of merit, that it is destined to take "a high place in Australian literature, for the . characters drawn by the author are delineated with strong individualitcs, the situations in whioh they are placed are fre quently perilously emotional, ranging from love involving poverty, inextinguishable hatred for avenging wrong. gaioty of balls, fervour of horse racing, with exciting steoplechasing mishap ; the bar's of public-houses with tho varied customers admitted at them, and those selected to occupy tho parlours ; these, with splondid descriptions of scenery, are all objects familiar to our lives. Tha tragicial part of tho tale consists of pathetic death seenos that aro related with great pathos, the chief of which consists of that in which Miver, a squatter, who, by bullying and wrong ing his workmen from niero avaricious greed, has to surrender all his hoards, amidst avenging ghosts. Having quarrelled and lost his intended heir, his son, all his endeavour at acquisition lias been worthies in its fruition. The most disappointing portion of tho tale is where the author raises the ourtain and shivers ruthlessly a beautiful, lovely, graceful, refined' true woman, who declines the offer of marriago to the rich squatter's son, by telling him at her doath that she had been, used as a decoy by her old sycophant, cringing father to avongb wrongs ugain'st the paternal Mivers.
