Even'nofr am ' so confused as to'what it was and what it' meant thaf 'I am utterly'at a' loss how to describe it. It consisted of twentythree gentleriien' present-in.-person,, some six others;: who, desiring to wait to see how the cat jumped', sent letters, and it was attended 'in the corridor by about fourteen representatives of the Press,'so that you can judge it was considered.an. interesting political event.
