So they came back again and made fo: Efoemselves a home on the shore of the gjJfcejyJake so famed in song, where they fcqpedrto r9st»from their weary journeyings. Bnl it was not so decreed. Slowly as poison works within the blood, a fearful bHght^was- stealing upon the noble, uncom jplainipg Richard, who had sacrificed his teariy manhood, to his father's fancies, and hrhen at last the blow had fallen and brushed jtjiiri. in. its might, he became as help Ies8»asa.littiecbiid, looking to others for the fcizLhe bad heretofore been aoeastoxaed to bender. Then it was that the weak old.

Such was Grrftce ^taetton, a prond, independent, but well-principledl woman, attendingstrictly to her own affaire, and expecting others to do the same. In the gossip concerning CoUiagwood, she had taken no verbal part ; butchers-was no one more deeply interested |kan herself, spite of her studied indif ference. ' ' Yq» --never knew the family,' a lady caller said to her -one morning, when at a ratherjate hour she eat languidly sipping her rioh ehocol&te;, asd daintily picking at the enowy rolls and nicely buttered toast, ' you never knew tbepx or you would cease to wonder whv the village people take so much interest *jn their movements, and are so glad to have tkem back/ ' I have heard* their story,' returned Mrs.. Atherton, ' and I hav_e no doubt the sou is a very fine specimen of an old bachelor; 35, isn't he, or tnereabonts r' ? * Thirty-five !' and Kitty Maynard raised her hands in dismay. ' My dear Mrs. Ather ton, he's hardly 30, and those who have seen him since his return from Europe pronounce him 3. splendid-looking man, with an air of remarkably high breeding. I wonder if, there ts-anytruth in the report that he is to bring with him a bride ?' ' 4 A bride, Kitty S* and the massive silver fork dropped from Grace Afcher^on's hand. She was interested now, and nervously pulling the* gathers of her white morning gown, she listened while the loquacious Kitty tolii her what she knew of the imaginary wife of Richard Harrington. The hands ceased their working at the gathers, and assuming an air of indifference, Grace rang her silver bell, which was im mediately answered by a singnlar looking girl, whom she addressed as Edith, bidding her bring some orange marmalade from an adpiningicloset. Her orders, were obeyed,, and then-the child lingered bythe door — listened eagerly to the conversation which '£rrace had resumed concerning GoHingwood and'.jts future mistress. Edith Hastings was a* strange child, with a strange -habit of expressing her thonghts aloud, and as she heard the beauties of Col lingwood described in Kitty MaynanTs most glowing terms,' she suddenly exclaimed, ' Oh, jolly, don't I wish I could live there, only I'd be afraid of that boy who haunts, the upper rooms.' 'Edith,' said Mrs. Atherton, sternly, ' why are you waiting here ? Go at once to Rachel ami bfil her give you something to- do.' Thus rebuked, the black-eyed, black haired, dark-faced, little girl walked away, not cringingly, for Edith Hastings possessed a spirit as proud as that of her high-j born mistress, and she went slowly to the kitchen, where, under Rachel's direc tions, ene was soon in. the mysteries of- dish washing, while the ladies in the /parlor continued their conversation. ' I don't know what I shall do with that child,' said Grace, as Edith's footsteps died away. ' I sometimes .wish I 'had left her where I found her.' c Why, I thought her a very Bright little creature,' said Kitty, and her companion replied, * She's too bright, and that's the tronble. She imitates me in everything, -walks like me, talks like- me, and yesterday I found her in the drawing-room going through a pantomime of receiving calls the way I do. I wish you coiild have seen her stately bow when presented to an imaginary stranger.' * Did sne do credit to you ?' Kitty asked, «nd Grace replied : * I can't say that she did not ; but I don't like this disposition of hers to put on the airs of people above her. ISow, if she were not a pooi* ? --* 4 Look, look '.' interrupted Kitty, ' that must be the five hundred, dollar piano sent tup from Boston,' and she directed her com panion's attention to the long waggon which was passing the house-on the way to Colling wood. This brought the conversation, fcack from Hhe aspiring Edith to Richard Harrington,, -and as old Rachel soon came in to remove ;her mistresses breakfast, Kitty took her leave, saying that she bade her friend good, morning, ' I trust it will not be long before you, know him.' ' Know him !' repeated Grace, when at last she was alone. ' Just as if 'I had not .known him to my sorrow. Oh, Richard, ?Richard ! maybe you'd forgive me if you ?knew what I have suffered,' and the proud, beautifnl eyes filled with tears as Grace Atherton plucked the broad green leaves from the grape vine over her head, ?and tearing them in pieces scattered the fragments upon the floor of the piazza, * Was there to be a bride at Collingwood ? ' This was the question which racked her Pbrain, keeping her in a constant state of fererish excitement until the very morning came when the family were expected. Mrs. Matson, the former housekeeper, had resumed her old position, and though she came often to Brier Hill to consult the taste of Mis. Atherton as to the arrangement of curtaine aaad furniture, Grace was too hanghtHy polite to question her, and every car whistle f bund&er; at the window watching for the carriage and a sight of its inmates. One after-anofcher the western trains arrived andiheBoffc September twilight deepened ^into darker night, showingtto the expectant Grape the numerous lights shining from the windows of Collingwood. Edith Hastings, too, imbued with something ofiier mistress's jepirifc, was-on- the-alerfc, and when the last train in which they could 'possibly come, thundexed £hrougb_ilae town, her quick ear LwaS'£he -first to catch the sound of wheels grinding slowly up the-hill. * They ape coming, Mrs. Atherton I' she cried; and nimble as a squirrel she climbed the great jgatd|iiOBt, where wiih her elf locks floating about ner sparkling face, she sat,, m&ile; the carriage passed slowly by, then, aaying to herself, * ffehavr, it wasn't worth itfce%ouble-- 1 nerer saw a thing,' she slid ^own from her 2%h position, and stealing in %be back way so as to avoid the scolding Mrs. AJfbei*en was sure to give her, -@h@ orept up to her^own chamber, where -she stood long by^ie open window, watelung ^hejiefate at CoHSngWiopd, and wondering & it w-mM mttkB a |-erson perfectly happy to be its miBtrese snd the bride. of Bichard Harrington. - .- '- .?- ?
