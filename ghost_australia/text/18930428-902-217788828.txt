A cuneiform, a Hittitei'mseription/is as legible. A factory withits steam-engine and com plicated wheels and whirr is full of mystery, : but of a Mnd which makes the beholders wonder and utter vague commonplaces about the ingenuity mi man.- A studio with pictures in various stages of advancement, from the portrait which . is as yet a mere ghost in chalk to thefinished figure ; with bits of tapestry ; with a gallery of carved Wood ; with armour, spear-heads, : swords, mirrors, costumes, and properties.of all kinds, is full of mystery. Eat s chemical laboratory, with its bottles," retorte, ; crucibles, scales under glass, blow-pipes, - glass rods, glass cylin ders, jars, pestle and mortar, and its" estrange smells, is the most mysterious thing j in the whole-world.— Walter Besant. -
