PORTFOLIO. We say in the Creed, " I believe in the Holy Ghost; the Holy Catholic Church," and there is a very close connection be tween the two clauses. But for the Holy Ghost the Church could never have arisen, continued, and spread as we know it has. Though the Father gave the Son, and Jesus lived and died and rose again, and ascended to the Father, yet without the descent of the Spirit and His continual working in the Church, there could neter have been a body of faithful people, and the possibility of such continuing amidst the perils to which the Church has been exposed. But what is the Holy Catholic Church 1 As our Church teaches us, it is "the blessed company of all faithful people." It is the company of all those who love God, and are joined to the Lord Jesus by the link of true faith. In its essence it is a heavenly and spiritual body quickened by the Holy Spirit from a death of sin, crucified with Christ, risen with Christ, sitting in heavenly places with Christ now, and hereafter to appear with Him in glory. The Church is described in Holy Scripture as a temple ; how is this temple formed I Christ is the one Foun dation Stone. The soul lies heedless of and without spiritual perception or desire in the quarry of our corrupt and fallen nature. But the Holy Spirit awakens, arrests, and convinces of sin. Then fur ther, the same Spirit leads the soul into the knowledge of the Lord Jesus, and fixes us on this rock by a steadfast faith. So, one by one, through the years and ages, the Spirit brings many to Jesus. And what is the result ! A glorious Church ; all the living stones of this temple knit one to another, because all built on the one Fosundation ; and thus is formed that Holy Catholic Church, which is the Habitation of the Triune Jehovah. -Rer.
