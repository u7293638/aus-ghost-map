Then the figure changed and I saw a mau lying on the ground with his droopiug head auppurted on rmy knee.

CHAPTER II. Although I am.very muoh tempted to ito so I m-ust refrain from enlarging-on bho hearty welcome I received at JdeBio' from all the family. Mr Maitland"was a tborough specimen of what is the colonial ideal of Pather John. 3ulb-hbluff,kind, ioapitable, and .trustworthy. - Mr Mait. land was a lady frma the crown of bor ailvered head to hor foot, well shod and nroall, There wais a little army of brothera and stators, and for. a wonder they oould get along without much tramping on each other'as toes.- The heouse was a big goo, and the faintly fully occupied it. Mr Maitland was a large land owner, and of 'ourse he-waee deeply intoreated in overy mining adveuture about Maryborough; - Sie spoke of the Altan- at- breakfast several times, and seemeod to think them u pair of Quixotes with more aldney than cotumon. aouso They bhad atarted; he aid, a philanthropio sheohme up .in thi Witomora, but he evidently thought littleof thb prospoeoe of suoccnu. SXetthey wore reeoived:whoa they drove up tftr bre?akfal t with the utmost cordiality, The gentleuoen retired-ito th erudy ihmodiately eafter the latroduction of the strangera, but during--the short time they wore with no I felt that the eyes of tho younger Mr Allan wero.always fallowing r vim whroverl went about the room. :-t.g gave me quito a etalige oen oation---very-pleaoetat, undoubtedly;-bat utterly bewildering to a young girl ha bud' alwaysebeon on a.perfectly unem. barassed footing :with all theo o s?I1-ath had .tbehito umet, annd hat pve?.dr:deemiadt of liwhat St allEd love. .lt wis:-a :revjo After about an hour I was asked to the study, and Mr Maitland laid the ease before me. The gentlemen were thorough believera in rhhatdomanoy, or the power of diseovering certain mnetein by the wand, I had never hoard of the thing before, and I supposa expreased my wonder in my face, Mr Allan explained. "There are certain persona-and you are one-who poseese this power. Wu shall only ask you to take a walk with us and your friends and hold a little stick in your hand in a certain way. You know," he said in a lower tone, " what depends on it, We have purchased is large tract of land, andweo know there is a rich roet below the surface, We want you to bring us as close as possible to it to prgvent un. 'necessary expense. That is all.': . 1 I have never heard of minerals hlinar discovered by this means,"' aid'Mr Mail. land, "but I know that it hasue been tried with the groatest aoecess for water. if thle youn i?dy liad ki to make the erperi. moet, I shall take a great deil of interest in it." What else could I do than say it would give me the greateet pleasore to be of use, though I doubted if I could do much good, Tod- I always thought of him as Ted -benot over and sald "forely you cannot have forgotten what occurred only yesterday." I had not forgotten what had ocoure., and Tod read his reply in the quick flickering glance I threw into his smiling and earnest eyes. Ubritmaas Day was fixed for our ex. periment, and I confess the ordeal through which I ha-I voluntarily promioed- to go prevented me joining in the Christmas Eve jollity with the vivacity of toy ago or spirits. Jeaeie rallied me on my unwonted quietness, and said it was all through the magnetic influence of young Mr Allan. t f course it was, but.i was not going to confoes it to her or anyone else, Christmas Day came,- and the whole party of us starter out on our adventures, some on horseback and a big load in Jessie's pony carriage. What I had to endure in the way of "chafling" I was the witch of Endor at the very least, and Jessie would have it that I wanted nothing but a broomstick and my place in the carriage might bha taken by, Mr Allan, I was demurely ailent under it all. An im promptu pionio had been suggeotod, and the good thinge provided. About half an hour'a driving brought us to the acone of operation. I was impressed by the experience of the day before, but - moet say the company generally looked on the whole thing as more of a "lark" than anything plee, and the young Maitlande, all home from school, did.not hoeeitate to expreos in plain terms their hbortical ideas. But lMr Allan and his son eernued to have no doubt on the matter, and tieated the scepticism. of the others with quiet disregard. t? was a pretty spot where we halted, The woodmon had long forsaken the glade botween two swelling hills, but Ead lelt behind them the great stumps of the trees they had folld, adil round theo trunks had sprunk up smail thickets of shoots crowned with the soft, gro-nu foliage that contrasted with the silvery pltiant brnauctl,. - 'T ho sell asso enor.acted with tiny quartz pebbles, barly leaving room for the stunted -bush grass and vagrant orchid, "Now, my doer,"seaid old Mr Allarn, "all you have to do is to take this rod by theos two prongs anol hold it out before You." The iod was V shaped, with -what may be called a long stern. I really dlid feel ridiculous, but I had promised, and was determined to go Ibhrough with it, It Was a trying time. - At first they all came after us, and we had the full benefit of their qpinions, and these not very coin. plieloritary, but gradually oven Mr Mait land got tired of the experiment, and they. all went off to see about the contents of the beakots, except, of couroe, Mr Allan and his san., "Up the hills and down their eloping sides and across the gullies, whore here; and there we saw the little holes of the prospeolors of the old digging days, withl the tiny hoeps of "nmulldok" at the side, Notwithastanding all my determination I was geoaing tired and discouraged myself, when ssddenly A troinor shot through thi roi and quivered through my arms, 'The point of - the stick twisted and gorved atd wrinkloe,-and actually boot itself in the ,air.until.it. formed aleaoat a eimi.cire'o, and nearly forced:itself out of my hands. I was frightened-so, much so, that if I had possessed sufloient prosence of mind, I should have drop?ud the wand to the earth, It-reminded me of Aaron's rod, which turned into a serpenat. "I know it," Mr Allan almost shouted. "to for Mr Maitland, Ted, animd bring the pick and shovel.

In a minutoe he had off lir coei, and craing thebo great pick with-hia brown, sinewy hands slroick it into the earth. We all stood round in a circle wondering what we should see next. \- The eteel point dug deep in the stubborn soil at every stroke, and rooted up thu groat boulderea of qualre from theoir ancient Oud. -Taien the slrong man bent to the habovel, and awvept'away the loosenod oarth Irom the excavation, Buddenly le krrleh down and soutaed to-ereamino the spot where- hislasat stroke had fallen. '' There is a reef bare," he said, "and right beneath where I am-e standing, I can't judge of its thickness, bat thies," continuap he, "will show what it's value may be." - We gathreod round him, and he held up a little cornered maess of white crumbly quar.ra, evidently btoken away, and all along tho.bluelshea-sea were tiny opeck, of haniong yellow- metal, which cantered in a mes ae of loaf-like gold, thba filled a little cavera in the body of a fused rck. It we gold-gold indeed, and expectation was justifieud \- I need not repeat all that was said,in the way of. wonder by Mr Maitland and his children. Jessi was more than astonished, Like myself, eho was huif trtghtened, and thouglht it was a bit uncanny. As for myself I was astuall bowildered; and could not help wondering at the change which the expeerinice of toan daysa had made in the character of a young, iunxporleiced and fickle girl, One can easily guess what was the topio discasaed at our alfresco luncheon. When we were.luaving, Ted came to me and said- ":There. Is no one here, perhaps, who will retain a more vivid remerabraoca of this ?brietmas Day than. you will, but you must. have a momento. ,This piece oc qluatisi yours.

ITed Allan was a coaetant visitor at "hlrs," With ?ll the energy of hie strong nature he threw himelf into the work of developing the "Chrietmanu Reef," whiolh lrroisdeed to become one of the wonders of the country; His father's trouble about the futuro of his great echeme wae at an end, and he -soon left for town to carry out his philanthropic ideas--whioh com. pl;tely absorbed himr.

I think be thoueght te toso?g cui?- or -oauah . things, and I-ame sure I had no idea of theb extent to which he cmonopolieod my thoughts And my existence. One evening he mentioned incidentally that he was going to explore the next day an old shaft about half a mile from the. place where we hld diecovered the reeoof, "It looke," he aid, "tr if it was on the tame line, and I should like to see how 1oe country makes Joe Perrian eand I will have a look. It ie just on our borders and it will.a interesting to tse how the . people who sank it failed to got the gold.' Jeesie and I know where the shaft was, and half.-layfully she proposed that we - should walk over and eco Mr. Allan and his mate at work, H1. eoemod delighted at the proposal, and" we promised, uviose, somnothing else turned up, to meet hial on, the condition that he canme back to "Irae" with us. We know Joe w ll-a big, blue eyed Cornibhmau, with the strength of a giant, and the sunny kindliness of a child. Next day we did walk over in that direction. The shaft wae at the foot of a little hill with a great mound of yellow earth raised beide it, and near it an old waterhole mader yeara ago for -mining purposea, and now partially ailtad up with big tree tronks stranded in the thick, muddy waters,;ind throwing their gnarled shadows over its dim ourfe0o. When we amoo to. the top of the little hill, we were surprised to see a man running rapidly round the greoat heap ita the direction of "Christmae Reeff." He saw un and began goaticulating furiously and ahouting -for ua to come quick. "There is something the matter," said Joesie, " that isJoe Perrian," My heart leaped to my throat, but I? gulped down toy emotion, and o:sing Juahio's arm, I ran with her towards the shaft. Perrian was at the mouth of the shaft when we reached it. " Mr Allan has fallen down," he shouted, "are you girls strong enough to lower me? The air I thought was bad, but he would go down. It muet be bad yet, but thole is a chance it is diatorbed, and I bhall take. it. ,fomething hao to be risked. I should go down hand over hand, but have-no knowledge-of the depthi;" The moments woere precious. If there ' was a chance it must be taken, and at- - orce. I felt every idandol in ry body: teiroma " etrenied - n-cd tti'-htroprd evsriT .. - -. ' Go down, Jce-" I said, "and we shall men." There was a windlass bridging the black serare hole, When we knew it, it was covered over with a number of planks, and we used to a take girlish delight in lookhig between the intoreticea and cal. calating the depth to which the gulf ex. tended. The, rope hang looee over the oylinder. Prrie.n caught the rope and placed bie foot in the loop. We then lowered him away -into the darkness. I could not even at that normeit of intense and agonisirg urneortainty help thinking what a brave man this was. Without comurneit and without demur of any kind, he simply offered himself to death in th - way of duty. Thereo wasee no mock heroism there. The toanty light of the candle h held :.. in his htnd was soon awallowed up in the overwhelming blctkneso, and then we heard a shout-a aiout of somelhing ilike - glaineos-not the ahout of horror or - ,despair. 'DoJn't lower much further. Easy, masy, that will do." . Westood there wondering and wondering what was happening to close bhaido us yet so far removed from ua. In actual di-tance it was only a few eteps, but-what a obhange that distance moade We had noticed that Joe had a long, small cord wound round his body when he went down. We heard nothing from him, but we saw the windlasr rope tighten, and in a few mintoas-porbapa they were only aceonodi, out time wae an awful laggard just then--Pe;riat'a frce appeared at the surface. (He is still alive," he said. " When lie fell he caught hltween a plank and tihe wall of the behaft, The plank had been left neaor an old drive, He was far below It when ha told me to 'wind up.' The air is not very had. Soruetlhing must be done, and at oce.

"You will," aid PPerrian, "Well you are a breave girl, indeed." I don't know about being brave. I could have thrown myeolfdtlown on the yellow ugly sai, Â·aiird -wopt--.ja an ccstasy oL: hyoberical frenzy, but I kneow that -that woauld be real mwlanes. "I'll go,"I eaidl" if ayor will tell me what I am to do. I hiave often enough climbed a rope and slrd down a rope in the gymrnatiumn." S"'Ihbt wae in fun, but, tia is in grim earnesat, fernuambhr your lifo and his depend on 3our ocuragre. Give me your hand." I hold out mny hlnl and .t-aoei it in hlt, It waS errll and broeu, but I know not a tremor betr-lsed the awful -truggl, that was going ni in tny aonl. "Li wll do.

Tihen with a gleam of light in his kind face, -" 1o will owe tauch to the coprage of a brave woman," Ssaitd nothring. I dared not speak. 'lHeoaven I what a sensation -it was when I woing myself over that yawning abys? of horror I I gripped the rope with the tenacity of steel. My fingeirs clutched it asif they would bury themselves in its - tough fibres. Then I "?ent down. The cold walle, ugly and blotched, eprang up past me and shtut out the light of day until 1 travelled through a twilight into almost palp~iblo darktrcss, It aseemed an :gc, butt was in reality only a few seconds when my foot touched the plank and I know that the first part of any work was comnpleted. ucere, hiuddled up, waR the form of the men so dear to moe.

Joe was not atn an to do things in balt. The cord was partlt coiled on the plank, and the end trailed down far below, Now I could seeo. My own body had abut out the light, but now a square patch of sky was cut out above mo and I could seeo Joe looking down. "In God's name haul up,"I shouted. The faeo wac withdrawn. The Tope tightened and I felt the plank shako and quiver and rock as gradually the tension increased, and slowly the tody roee and sot out on its awful j amrney. I think I did my dety, although even now those awful seconds seem hburied in a cloud like the ghosts of a flichtfal dream, Up the awful burden went, and again darkness was all around,but Ikept steady, and at last I could see the load taken from the rope and drawn in by the Cornishman's strong arms. Then a great loneliness descended on me. There was a dreadful consolousness of being forFaken, and for the first time I myself became the subject of my own thoughts, and the terrible possihbilities of my own position almost ohattered what little there remained of my courage. "Are you strong enough to tie yourself to the rope," Porrian shoeted down. " If oua place your foot in the loop, you will be up here in no time. but the oxoitement may have been too great, cud I am afraid to trast you. Will you tie yourself to the rope ?" "I will, I will," I cried. "Send down the rope," The rope descended, and I wrapped the cord round it and my body sasin and again, and tied it as fast as my hands I could, now trembling with excitemoeat, de, brutsed and torn by the chafing and the I unwonted work. A few miutes, and I waa in the free open air of Heaven agaOi, and the |Ire z. kissed my cheek, What a diffirenc. between that glorious freshnses and th, stagnant and sluggieli atmosphere below I "I shall inn for assietance," Perriae, said. "Miss Midtland has gone alread) towards the reef." Now that the excitement was over I felt the reaction. I felt the hysterinal earasile and tottered to the spot wheoe Mr Allan lay stretched out as if he were dead. Sitting down I lifted his head on my lap, An awful gash had tarn the soclp, and there was a dreadful supplenres in tha arm bent beneath him, Tie groaned when I touched him, but he was evidontly reviving. His eyes opened, and there passed over his poor, bruised and wounded face the smile of welcome recognition. I bent down my head and caught the words as they straggled through his feeble lips "My wife for the ages-I know it." Yes, and at that solemn moment I know it too. The clands of fate were rent, and I could catch a glimpse of the soul life of the past. It was no longer a girl they found there ending over the seuseless body-it was a woman with a woman's soul vivified into a new life and a larger exisltenca. 0 0 0 0 0 0 I am contented.
