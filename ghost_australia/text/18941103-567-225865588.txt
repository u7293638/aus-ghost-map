A STRANGE PROBLEM IN THEOLOGY. The Chinese have more than once served as a means for political agitation in ibis ooontry. In the following wickedly amusing remarks an attempt is made to show how they may be made neefol by ministers in tbe Telegraph i« guilty of tbe remarks, which are as follows Half a million Chinamen die every mouth without God,' said a missionary i in Victoria the other day. Ia other words, aooording to the good old missionary logic, 6,000,000 Chinamen go to eheol annually. Tbe Chinese are a very, very old nation, which seems to have starred ia tbe early dawu of the first day, and, at the very lowest estimate has probably been going on for 5,000 years. This means that there are now 30,000,000,000 Chioamao in eheol, and they still beep going there at the rate of 500,000 a moutb. There IB an endlfBS stream of Cbinameo pouring, like Niagara, dowa the slippery slope which leads to the final drop —an endless, ceaseless torrent of dead men with pig-tails flying behind them — a howling blast of yellow ghosts, screaming in strange, angular characters, and trying to brace their flesh less feet egaint nothing, to stop their descent. Perdition, in short, is a place that 1 is full of Chinamen, which lends a new 1 horror to tbe hereafter, and adds a new j odour to tbe hottomhss halts of night. This ! ia an impressive vfcw of the caee, and one j which hae not received tbe atteotion it j deserves. The material horrors of Gehenna have been worn threadbare ; but the fact J that Gehenna ia full of Chinamen has not been impressed on the public tniud a& it j ought to be.

Think of tbe I impreaaiveuess of it ; ' Brethren, H — I is full ! of Chinamen !' j
