! £ A GHOST AT GERMANTON. The local correspondent of the ' Albury Mail' gives the following version of the vision : 7 — On Friday niglit last, as a 7 gentlemen well-known here 7 was returning to the township 7 by a lonely road, he was greatly 7 startled by the sudden appear - . . ance of a man on horseback <7 who seemed to arise out of a neighbouring dam or waterhole 77 and after crossing the road by which he was proceeding dis- 7; appeared in a mysterious man- 7 ner. The same unearthly visi tant is reported to have been 7\. seen by two old residents of the district some 18 months ago, r . and who are prepared to vouch 7 for the accuracy of their state- 7 ment, so much so that neither 7 care to pass that way after nightfall. In both cases the ghostly visitant is said to be riding a gray cob. That some discontented spirit is dissatis fied with his mode of exit from this sublunary sphere is evident but why bring the spirit of his horse ? Why not let the spirit of his Bucephalus rest in the happy hunting ground ? But perhaps the horse wishes to gaze one the pastures where once he fed. It is said that one or two venturesome indi viduals purpose interviewing his ghostship.
