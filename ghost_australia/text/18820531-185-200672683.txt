A GHOST AMONGST THE BABBIT TRAPS. The Myrniong correspondent of the Bacchus Marsh Express writes:— strange story comes from Pyke's Creek, from which it would appear that the locality is honoured (or otherwise, as the case may be) as the residence of a visitor from the world of spirits. It appears, as the story goes, that some rabbit trappers, in pur suing their avocations in that locality, bad in the, to them, moat unaccountable manner— their traps sprung and carefully laid on one side of the rabbit barrow. This had happened to them repeatedly, until at length, when setting their traps late one night, the spirit or ghost, or whatever else it might be, became so bold—en couraged, no doubt, by former success—as to follow the trappers at a respectful distance, and spring trap after trap. The trappers listening to the * click, click' of tber traps, thought it strange, but could not account for the vagaries of their traps until, after listening attentively and gazing eagerly in the darkness, something all at once appeared to their vision resembling a human being dressed In white, minus the head. The young men at once saw through the mystery of the springing of their traps, but did not wait to question hisghostshiponthe subject nor did they finish the setting of their traps that night, but made tracks for their home at a pace somewhat quicker than usual, the ghost pursuing until reaching a stream of water— which it is eaid, ghosts cannot cross—where they managed to escape its clutches at the expense of nothing worse than a good ducking to one of themselves. The young men have, I- hear, left that locality, and gone trapping elsewhere."
