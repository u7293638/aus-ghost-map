what fines Morning grates WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1870. In the Legislative Assembly, j ester eli j, Ministers, in answer to questions, said -that 1919 had been expended out of the solo voted for the Bathurst and Ophir Road, that the members of the Gold Commission had not been paid for every day from the elite of their appointment, that the return of the crimes, nationality, and religion of convicted prisoners was in course of preparation that the crew of the "Pearl tender were without pay for two months owing to the contingent vote having been exhausted, but that they were paid now that a tender was called for by the Council of Education for books and stationery, and that of Mr. John Ferguson, being the lowest, was accepted, and that Mr. is It Pearce acted as Secretary to the Necropolis. under the let without sale, and performed all the necessary duties The petition horn Mr James road was ordered to be printed On the motion of Mr "W ToitsTrit, the papers relating to the appointment of the Rev. A. H. W itt to celebrate Damages were order feel to be held on the table Captain Onslow moved for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the working of the Civil Service He admitted that there were many cases neither the inquiry by a select committee would be quite sufficient, and that there was a great objection to a Royal Commission on the score of its expense At the same time only by an liquor) by, bitch a ( commission could the ends desired be obtained, provided that good men were selected to conduct the move) Such i Commission need not entail much expense on the country, because there would be no necessity for its members to leave Sydney There was a general and well founded on pression that the number of Civil servants wits for in excess of the requirements of the colony, and that some of them were entirely useless He believed the only remedy for this was to leave the offices in the public service open to competition after a public examination Some least) was required to prevent the country from being injured by the expenses entailed upon it by the present system, and such an inquiry) as he recommended was the only way he saw of meeting the difficulty Mr CowTFit doubted if men could be found in the colony capable of conducting such an inquiry, and even if they could, lit feared that the report they would bring up would not be such a one as would be of any service to the colony) Mr Buchanan, legal ded the motion as useless, as it was in the power of the Government to appoint such a commission if it was considered necessary He denounced the system of public competition as a farce Mr I'm variety pointed out the evils of the present system of appointment, and plan he would propose for the regulation of the Civil Service Captain Onslow, after a few words in reply), withdrew the motion Mr Taumíll moved that the case of Mr John Bush) be referred to arbitration, and explained that this gentleman had come out from England with his father, with an express promise from the Secretary for State that he w could receive a grant of land if he brought out £500 of capital with him. When he reached the colony he took employment under the Government, and remained there for eleven years At the expiration of that time he left the public service, and claimed the grant, but then the regula- tion had been done away with, and the application was refused. Mr Roiiehtson opposed the motion, because re- fees ing the matter to arbitration would be admitting the existence of a claim, and that he was not prepared to do Besides there were many other similar claims, and the House ought to be cautious how, b) a decision upon this, they opened up other cases After a few words from Mr Tunks, Mr Taiineli, replied, and the motion was negatived by) 18 to 8 Mr "W foRSTER moved that it was desirable to introduce a bill to reduce the upset price of land. He said that the settlement of the country should be the last object of the Legislature, though if in doing this, revenue could be obtained so much the better would it be free grants were objectionable so long as pa) ment could be obtained for the land, me! free selection was also objectionable, because of the cost of supervising the conditions, because of the complicated nature of the state of things which it induced, because it conferred a right of freehold before an) condition had been fulfilled, and thus operated as a check upon the sale of land in freehold, because it gave a pit emptive lease which would always be the source of litigation, and because the whole transaction, from beginning to end, was full of doubt Thus the sale of land was not only the best meant, of distribution, but was the least open to objection and in any system of that kind the sale by auction, md at a fixed price, might be combined He did not object to speculation in land, as he regarded the speculator is one of our best colonisers, whilst the extension of municipal institutions and the putting up the land in small lots would always be a check upon over speculation If we intend to sell our land and settle the country we must reduce the price in so far is large tracts are concerned, which would never be sold it the present price He regarded this question is vital to the improvement of the country, and the only means by which insolvent) can be avoided He regarded the carrying of this resolution into effect as of far more importance than any Government, and should not be deterred from pushing it for vi aid by the fear of embarrassing this or any other Govern- ment Mr Robertson regretted that a question of so much importance should be brought forward at a time when there was barely a quorum present, and that an attempt should be made to alter the land law at a time when the whole colony was satisfied with it. He defended nee selection as established under the land law. and contended that it had been success \- full in every way. He stated the amounts received from free selectors, and from rents and sale of land, whilst for the use of the pastoral lands under the Lands Occupation Act, the total was one third more than it was in 1861 Going you) fully into the provisions of the Lund laws he contended that it had doubled the early income from the land At the same time some amendments were required, and as he had before observed 1871 was the year in which they could be best dealt with in co of all complicity in 1 he recess then that would follow the present session vi ill be the best time in which to prepare a bill to be submitted to V filament so as to to use it in such a way as to meet all objections though he was not the inclined to sell certain of our hands at a reduced price, jet he would commit himself to nothing on this point He would pledge himself only to such a measure is he would consider calculated to bring the most advantage to the best interests of the country, met to do the least possible injury to any With regard to the stutters, such a measure as that proposed by Mr. Forster would allow capitalists to buy the sensations out of their very homes the runs would all come into the hands of money jobbers, and the whole public domain would be you kindly thrown into their hands Our lands brought in now an annual lentsuibcient to pay the interest on five millions of money, an amount that would construct a long extent of railway By extending the lines of railway, that) would increase the value of the public domain, and help its sale, whilst at the same time our Customs revenue would be necessarily increased It would be folly then to hold out inducements for sale until the lad ways were pushed forward and the lands received a y clue which they did not now possess No case of urgency had been made out for any change, whilst the present was a most inopportune time, and the country had a light to be appealed to before any alteration was made Under all these circumstances he should move no amendment, but should meet the motion with a direct negative Mr 'Wïavfk said that the and Law was not in such general acceptance as Mr Robertson imagined, even with the free selectors, and he should vote for the resolution. Mr. TiT/iATnicu did not believe that the reduction of the price of land would have any good effect It had so long been fixed at £1 an acre, that a kind of vested right had grown upon the part of those wished purchased On that ground he could not support the a resolution, yy Just, at the same time, he admitted the necessity for an amendment of the Land Law The i residence condition was the one town which he mainly took exception, as the country was interested in improvements rather than in residence He objected also to deferred payments, and would prefer that instead of paying interest, the annual payments should go in reduction of the purchase money) The mention the points in which amendments were necessary, and expressed his opinion that the split- ters had been named by the free selectors The debate was adjourned to Friday) next The House adjourned at three minutes to 11, until 3 o'clock this day The Budget will be again discussed to night "We do not expect a determination of the control ers).

Ey on the private affairs of members have not escaped Most assuredly the public have lost all interest in these topics. It is hal di) w o th while to ask who among our public men have given promise of an intelligent administration of our finances by the accounts rendered to the Commissioner of their private affairs It seems sometimes to be assumed that the most qualified to judge of the measures which make the country insolvent, are those who have traversed all the mysteries of indebtedness-all the difficulties of staving off creditors, who have known the pangs of presenting a schedule, and felt the joy) of emancipation b) i full and nee discharge 'the discussion of a land, however, may be enlivened by anecdotes horn the counting house, and rays of light may come home the minds that have been clouded b) difficulties, as flashes often be detected through the obscurity of the hen ens 'The public have less pleasing in these items when connected with ornamental) celebrities, than the) might tell if they had less personal interest in the facts It would not be very pleasant for those who approach one another for his fortunes which are common to many of them in the) heard the people talk of the topics on which the eloquence of some of the speakers is expended It is time, however, that this long episode in Paihamcntai) affairs was brought to a close If we are to have a change of Government, pia) let it come We are now half through November. Six weeks will bring us to the time when the present appropriations will be exhausted. A new Ministry will I require weeks to be re-elected. An uncertainty will exist probably in reference to their measures during the year. Who then will give us assurance that those measures will be earned ? Thus months perhaps will elapse before the Estimates for 1871 are discussed, and what is still worse before the tariff of the country will be definitely settled. Country gentlemen who have no particular interest may look with indifference upon all these things. The) may defer engagements until it is convenient to make them. But the inhabitants of this great city, with its thousands of shops, are troubled by this delay. The persons employed by them must be paid or dismissed. The rent and taxes are going on. The cost of living is increased by these new burdens. A declara- tion of insolvency may improve the circumstances of some but in drooping times it only sells the ruin of others. We therefore say to the Parliament, what they do let them do at once. Suspense cannot longer be borne without the most serious loss. It will be far better to make every man qualified to take office a present of its emoluments than to suffer the embarrassment created by this delay. It was not without reason that Victoria set apart a sum of money to pay those that were " out," as well as those that were " in." They, by this means, bought off several candidates for place; and, while these enjoyed a fair income for doing nothing, they were the more content to suffer those who were a little stronger to rule in comparative peace. There seems no other plan by which responsible government in the colonies can unite the interests of the public with those who are so fortunate as to obtain an active or latent title to manage its affairs. The demolition of African Slavery in America has led to the systematic introduction of Chinese labourers and mechanics into New England, and the process is not going on with the consent of the settled population. Those who advocate the movement say, naturally enough-On this continent we have space enough for all the surplus energy of Europe and Asia for ages to come. Land in thousands and thousands of acres lies waste, the taking of which will add to the comfort, if not to the wealth, of every individual member of the community. This, however, is not all. Work of various kinds has to be done, the doing of which at a reasonable figure will relieve hands and brains which can be profitably employed in higher and more useful fields of enterprise. Crowds come from Europe at the rate of ten and fifteen thousand a week, and the addition to the population is felt to be the addition to the nation of so much actual wealth. With the single exception of language our emigrants from Europe find no difficulty in becoming good American citizens, and the one difficulty soon disappears. Crowds now begin to come in upon us from Asia, and the remarkable fact is, that Asia has begun to show her ability and her willingness to give us skilled labour. If Chinamen can give us cheaper shoes, why should not Chinamen give us cheaper coal and iron ? If the importation of a few hundred China- men adds to our general comfort as a people, and if there is room and work for more, why should we have only hundreds ? Nay, why should the hundreds not become millions ? This is the tenor of the apology for John Chinaman. It is not impossible to point to the successful planting of Asiatic population in the West. In the Antilles the importation of Asiatic labourers has been carried on on a large scale for years. But it has been done so quietly, and the labourers have conducted themselves so peaceably, that the people of this country have never had their attention attracted to the subject. Since the year 1843 the number of Asiatic labourers who have been imported to the islands of the West Indies has swelled to very near a million. The official statement makes it out to be 963,576. These are scattered throughout seven of the islands, neither Cuba nor Porf;o Rico being included in the number. If the coolie labourers on the island of Cuba were taken into account, it would swell the figures. Last year the number of coolies taken from Calcutta to the islands of Trinidad, Demerara, St. Vincent, and Mauritius amounted to 12,912. The flow of emigrants, therefore, from the East to the - islands of the West Indies is steady and continuous. Their frugal habits, untiring energy, temperate living, and acquisitive pro- pensities enable them to lay aside something from the meagre wages they receive for their labour, to sustain them in declining years, or enable them to return to their native country."- The fact that four hundred and thirty-eight coolies recently were able to return to Calcutta, and carry with them a sum amount- ing in the aggregate to over sixty-five thousand dollars, is matter for. consideration. In like manner three hundred and seventy-two coolies were sent home from Trinidad, their term of service having expired. These labourers did not go home empty-handed. They took with them eighty-eight thousand three hundred and fifteen dollars-their savings for years. No better inducement could be held out to the Chinese and Japanese to emigrate to America than the return of so many of their countrymen to their native homes, with their pockets well filled with the money they had honestly earned in a foreign land. Thus coolie labour is popular with parties worked for and the workers themselves. The writers and speakers who are determined upon carrying this question against the prejudices of the class of labourers who view the arrival of a foreigner as an intolerable invasion of their rights, do not appear to be much appalled by the troubles involved in the new experiment. When taunted with the difficulties of the case, they say in effect, We do not say that there will be no trouble; but this is no valid argument against the experiment. Labour leagues may resist this new movement, but labour leagues must, in the end be defeated. If John Chinaman can give us cheaper boots and shoes, cheaper coal and iron, there is no good reason why the community should fight against him, They call upon politicians who do not like this new thing to remember that there are such things as principles involved in the question, and that men should not allow their conduct to be a matter of feeling. If negro emancipation has turned out so rich a bless- ing why should not a new nigger be gladly welcomed?,' They are far from dread- ing a collision of antagonistic civilization,, and rival ? races, and rely with some assurance on the remarkable fact, that the strength of the natural stock is so great that the miltons of foreigners Germans, Scandinavians French, Italians, are absorbed by. great communities, without leaving so much as their skins visible. .

Mr Foster then called upon Mr E Dowling, the hon secretary of the Sydney Association, who read the annual report The report reviewed the history of the association, which was formed in 1863, and stated that 800 young men had since been enrolled in connection therewith Under the auspices of the young men who formed the association, breakfast meetings had been held for the last nine years on the last Sunday in each month, and on other special occasions The association gave thanks to the ministers of various denominations who had presided and given their assistance at these meetings The book stall held at the late Centenary Exhibition was particularised in the report which mentioned that it had been very successful some thousands of moral and scientific publications having been disposed of, to visitors from all parts of the colony, and a number of exhibition papers on social science subjects printed and distributed Thanks were awarded to many kind friends who had assisted by contributions and other wise towards the erection of the Exhibition pavilion, and in the printing and he oksolhng operations Communist forces had been received from the secretary of the Dublin Association introducing Mr R L Murray) (who had been a delegate at the late Conference of Christi m "Voting Men's Associations held in that city), and from the secretary of the London Society for a aiding a parcel of books Mr N J Crockei,as treasurer, then read the b dance shoot of the association, which showed that a small balance to His credit of the Society remained in his hands Addresses, living reference to the utility and the mission of Chris- B in "Young Men's Associations were delivered by Messrs S li Lewis, Samuel Goold, H B Lee, R L Murray, W S Buzacott, A Allen, T Griffiths, and by the Rev.

Mr George Butterfield, the author, has been induced, by the compliments paid to his map to have it engraved, and it is now on sale at the establishment of Mr T Edwards. It is likely to be largely patronised by those engaged in teaching, as well as by adults who wish on fine evenings to have at hand a simple means of identifying the principal stars above the horizon. It is not every one that can afford to have it hand a good celestial globe, and to those on this side of the world it is only the map of the Southern stars that is practically useful Mr Butterfield's apparatus consists simply of a sheet of cardboard, overlaid by the other circular sheets rotating on a central pivot. On the lowest sheet is marked it circle graduated for the twenty-four hours, with then subdivisions The upper sheets, either of which may be used as required, are star maps, and which can be adjusted as required, according to simple directions easily understood after a little practice. By this means an observer, with very little practical knowledge of astronomy, can soon learn the names of the stars and make himself easily familiar with the mighty science. The map may not improbably become a favourite in the bush, and may lead many to take an interest in astronomy who have hitherto been deservedly its apparent difficulties Mr Butterfield has submitted his map to the Government Astronomer, from whom he has received the following certificate -- "I have examined the hemisphere of the southern circumpolar stars, by Mr. G.
