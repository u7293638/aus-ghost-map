A POLITICAL CRISIS IN HOLLAND. (From the Times.) RECENT intelligence from the Hague points to an increase of agitation in Holland the stir among political parties in that country arises from a variety of circumstances In the first place there as the dispute between his Majesty of Prussia and King William III of the Netherlands The European possessions of the latter make up a population of 3 69.7 U, of which 427,050, or about one eighth, inhabit those parts of the territories of Luxembourg and Limburg by virtue of which, till very lately, the Ken" of Hol- land enjoyed the privileges of a member of the German Bund, was entitled to vote in its deliberations, and was bound, whenever required, to furnish a contingent of 1913 foot and 1001 horse to the Federal army When, on the 14th of June 'last, the question of the mobilisation of that army was put to the vote in the Diet at Frankfort, and all its members were expected to pronounce either for or against Prussia, the King of the Netherlands deemed himself entitled to declare himself neutral, and upon the dissolution of the Bund following close upon the battle of Sadowa a, to with draw himself and his Grand Duchy of 1 Luxembourg from the German connection He assumed that the Germany to which he belonged, the Confederation of which he was a member, had ceased to exist but the King of Prussia, or for him Count Bismark! contended that Germany as a nation survived the Bund, and that for any thing concerning the northern members of that body, and consequently I Luxembourg, Prussia had put herself at the head of a new North German Confederacy, upon which devolved all the lights of the old Band However desirable it might be that that mixed empire, which proved so fatal in the case of Denmark, should cease so far as concerns Holland Bismark shows himself inexorable and refuses to evacuate the strong place of I Luxembourg, which as a Federal fortress is still occupied by a mixed garrison, Dutch and Prussian I he question would only be of moment for the peace (1 Europe if I France should avail herself of the pretext afforded by a dispute arising from the possession of a first class fortress lying almost on her borders, but the Emperor Napoleon has engaged in no event to pick a quarrel with Bismark, and Holland left to her own re- sources would have no better chance with Prussia than Denmark or Hanover or Saxony under the same circumstances have had the King of the Netherlands must feel all the more loth to proceed to extremities in his foreign disputes as he is now at issue with his subjects on some most important points of home and colonial policy Parties in Holland are divided on the subject of" J vu Juv i as the reader is aware, is the brightest gem in the Netherlands' diadem, the pride of the Indian Archipelago, unmatched for beauty and fertility by any equal extent of the earths surface Java, an old Portuguese, and substantially a Dutch colony, came into the hands of the English in HU, mel only fell back to the Netherlands by an act of spontaneous cession nee years later the Javanese, a Main race, were already civilised at the time of the first Portuguese settlement in 1911, and by the advanced state of the agricultural industry, aided by the most perfect system of irrigation, they had made their land the granary of the Archipelago The Dutch, who previous to IS 11 had only some settlements in the island, had introduced forced labour in then plantations, but their "peculiar institutions were abolished during the English occupation, and not restored for several years after the reinstatement of Netherland rule One of the Governor Generals of the Dutch East Indies, however, by some Van den Bosch, effected a revolution on a large scale in the island, appropriated all such soil as could best be turned to the production of sugar, coffee, indigo, xc, and, by the means of compulsory labour, changed the whole aspect and economy of the land The results of these measures, a is state el, were a rise in the revenue to a sum of £1,000,000 yearly, and an increase of the population from o,000,000 in 1835 to 13 GJ9.GS0 in 1863 We must not, however, so der these somewhat, startling numbers to mis- lead us The population of Java, with all its won draws increase, is only about half the density of that of Lower Bengal, and as to trade, while the joint îm ports and exports, not only of Java, but of all the Dutch islands in those Eastern Seas, are valued at about £13,000,000, they are exceeded by £2,000,000 by those of the three little British districts in the Straits of Malacca, the two principal of which were still uninhabited eighty years ago that, with all the wealth which they accumulate for their taskmasters, the Javanese labourers do not greatly improve their own position one might feel tempted to infer from the fact that the price of corn has during the last sixty years risen 200 per cent The island, which was once as we have said, the sole granary of the Malay Archipelago, has ceased to export corn, and the supply of those islands comes at the present day from the British possessions in Pegu, Arracan, and siam But, however splendid may be for Holland the results of the forced labour system man economical point of view, the time has come in which such questions are put to the test of humanitarian, no less than utilitarian inquiry, and an outcry has been raised among a party in the Dutch Opposition by whom the system of cultivation in their East Indies, however disguised it may be under the specious name of " apprenticeship, is stigmatised as unmitigated servitude It is little to the purpose to assert that the Javanese are not demoralised by their present condition, or that they are aware of no oppression, that the system is indigenous, and has always been in the island Our age is at little trouble to distinguish between curves and battle and downright slavery It will put up with no forced labour, even for the negro , so much less, then for the gentle and patient Malay, who seeks no escape from his lot except in emigration, and goes forth as a sailor, sometimes even as a pirate, or looks abroad for employment in any other capacity but upon conditions of freedom of such a nature is the question which seems to have roused the Dutch politicians from their wonted sluggishness After the abolition of negro slaves in the Dutch West Indies in 1802 3 the 1 Liberals w wished to proceed to a similar measure in behalf of their eastern possessions A bill for the abolition of the sy s term of forced labour in these colonies was brought in last year in the Dutch Parliament, but was rejected, as fraught with utter ruin to the colonies themselves, no less than to the mother country More lately the Government failed the measure of popular discontent by the appointment to the office of Governor General of the East Indian possessions, the highest office in the Crown's gift of a man formerly well known for his leaning to the principles of free trade and free labour, but who had abandoned his principles and rated from his pain A vote of censure was passed in both houses against the Ministers who had advised the nomination of the obnoxious Governor The lung retorted by the dissolution of the Chamber, and Holland LJ now in all the throes of a general election A royal proclamation, intended to soothe the angry spirits," seems to have been void of effect The I Liberals are likely to muster stronger than ever in the new Parliament and in the event of a new vote of want of confidence, the Ministers are said to contemplate a resort to exceptional measures equivalent to a violation of the chatter of ISIS 11 c bevy of young ladies who received the King of Prussia on his triumphal entry into Berlin have been presented with gold to ches Ornamented! with the head of the

the inner casemate, and climie ing into his father s arms, who had just leaned upon the sofa, gave occasion to Mrs Davis to in make some remarks about her other children, particularly those in Canada Bishop Green then remarked that he would not have ventured to introduce the subject, but as Mrs Davis had done so herself, he felt bound to say, as a bishop of her own chosen Church, he did not think she acted entirely wisely in sending her the then to a convent to be taught Mrs Davis replied 'I was in Georgia, and had no money so institution of my own Church offered to teach my poor children One day three Sisters of Charity came to see me, and brought me five gold dollars, all the money they had in the world Thor almost "forced me to in, the money but I did not They then offered to take my children to their school in the neighbourhood of S svan Bab, where the air was cool, and they could be e m fortably cared for during the summer months Then came an offer from a convent school in Canada i, whither, when I got permission from the Gov- rn nent which was not without great trouble and di h city I took them It is true I do not wish them to be Roman Catholics, but then person is as good is they can possibly be and become arc and have been, and doubtless will continue to be Roman t arches These good people were the first to offer me Mitchell I will never cease to be grateful to them for it Mr Davis then added Bishop, there never was more unanimity in any nation in the world than there was in the Southern Confederacy It would be invidious to single out any class of our people for special praise The churches and ministers were all, or nearly all, entirely devoted to our cause, but, as I said before, if it would not be regarded as invidious, I would say that the Catholics of the South were conspicuously devoted to our cause I could relate to you cases of great suffering and trial to which they were subjected, and in no case did any of them ever flinch Besides, Bishop, Pio None was the only Prince in the world that really wished well to our cause, and sent us his blessing I cannot help liking the Catholics The happiest hours of my life were once spent in a Catholic monastery By the w y, Bishop, I see our Church in the North is establishing sisterhoods in imitation of the Catholics How do they work' 'So well,' says the Bishop, that I intend introducing them into my own diocese as soon as possible Indeed, there are many good things and good people among the Catholics, but I think, Mr Davis, that our Church is good enough for us A GHOST UATTtmfiD-.The It'cstnn Morning News reports a strange case of superstition in the west of England About three weeks ago there died the Rev. E D Rhodes, vicar of Bathampton, a tillage two miles from Bath, and on the borders of Somerset and "Wilts Mr Rhodes was a man of very remarkable powers, his teaching was far above the average of country clergymen, and his parishioners were com u only supposed to be, so far as intellectual attain- ments are concerned, much above the level of an, ordinary rural parish Nevertheless, since his death the rumour has become current that his ghost has been seen in Bathampton churchyard, and has been heard groaning and sighing The witnesses increased in number and in positive cases of assertion, and the report obtaining general currency crowds of persons came over from Bath to verify it Their testimony was abundantly confirmed, and one old parishioner, entering more into detail than the rest, said that he had seen Mr Rhodes with a crown of glory round his head and a trumpet in his hand. The matter now be came serious, and the aid of the police was asked Constables accordingly were sent over The ghost appeared as usual, pale and ghastly, groaning and sighing He was captured, and turned out to be a great white owl which is henceforth condemned to humiliating imprisonment in a barn, with hard labour in the shape of micccatching RAH WAA s IN Tuf Hoia LAMB-The directors of the Smyrna and Aden Railway have had surveys made for great extensions of their system Smyrna will continue to be the 1 of station, and a new line, it executed, still pass to the north round the head of the gulf It will then take an easterly course in the direction of Yards and Philadelphia but stops short of those once renowned cities, upon the ruined portals of which, in common with those of the other " seven churches in Asia" "Ichabod" may be written The railway, on the other hand, strikes southward in the direction of Ephesus, which will be resolved by a branch line The projected main trunk takes an easterly course from Aden, to which it has already been opened In its route it will touch at, or pass by.
