, A . Slow Town. HË'wore a"faint smile of pleasure when he walked into the down-town drug store, unbuttoned his coat, and leaned with an1* air--'bf expectancy against a showcase. " Can I do anything for you ?" asked a clerk. - " Well, maybe you can and maybe you can't" answered tho .other, care- fully removing a speck from his, coat sleeve. " I don't know," he added re- flectively. . "Anything in my i>ower I'll be glad to do," said the clerk, smiling encouragingly. . " Well, I'll tell you," answered the stranger. " I live over in Jersey. My town is pretty slow. You might also call it dead. . I'm sure you would if you went over there ; only we're, so used to it that we don't notice it much." . " Oh, yes,"; said the drug clerk, look- ing a little dazed." ? - . " Yes, exactly," said the other with a flattering smile., ." You see,.there is never any excitement over our way ;. it's, just dead-dead as a door- nail. ; No^v, coming over on the ferry boat to-day-. By the way, do you know:much about cholera?" " Cholera ?" asked the clerk, looking startled. / What's that got; to do With it?" . ;'.!- ! :'". ':'! -. 1 -:¡.". Why, .yes,, cholera. Know nny ithingabout the symptoms?" : " Symptoms !" said the clerk, with a gasp, and he took: two or three steps backward and his eyes began to dilate.-. ; : , o.."??.:. . " Symptoms-that's it. : Should you say; for instance,, that I had the cho- lera? Would you behove rit, I mean, to look at nie ?'1. .? . ; p ' The young -man "who dispensed drugs began to back away, looking as if ho were, waiting for : a chance to make a break'for the street. . ';0h, don't.get frightened," said the New Jersey man,,with his calm smile, "il-haven't got tho cholera-no such luck." "Luck !" exclaimed, the/Startled clerk. ,"..,",_."..!..' "Yes, luck. I'd call it luck lo*'gel' an Al.'iirst-classy gehiiine, guaranteed ease of true Asiatic cholera, freshly imported.". .' ; "Why, man, you're., era/.-excuso me, you can't mean what you say !" "Mean*wHât~T'say.?'doclàï,ed the searcher for cholera. I mean every word that I say.r,I tell you, sir,, that, I was born in the/deadest to\yn that ever, died. , I,was raised in it. I ha ve livcd.iii that town for 34,years. . I'd rather live in a graveyard." "There aren't even^ghosts -pr? spirits in my town. "Now", that place lins got to be waited up. If we don'tdo something we won't be able to distinguish-be- tween a dead, man and, a live..mari." Theil we'll be' in' a pretty fix, won't we? We'll have dead men-I'mean really dead men-I mean.men that breathe; and we'lljfhayçf-live :inen hobnobbing with men tliat ought tb have been hui'ied long ago, just be- cause everything's "so dead that it seems natural. ... " Oh, of course," gasped the bewil- dered clerk. "Now that place has got to wake ,uj)., -There's only one thing in the world that will wake it up. That's cholera. Now, I thought that I would be willing,to catch tue cholera and. take it ovbr there" just for the good' pf my town." I'm a public-spirited citizen and I'm willing to.make some sacrifice to benefit my native town. But I found around to me-of course it would take..a. long time, for it's a slow , town-I'd grab; 'everybody I could reach and yell " cholera".' I thought that would fetch them. They d have ;tb rig un a hospital for me, and get me into it and take care of me. They'd get more pr less inter- ested, you see^ Then, if I knew the symptoms by heart, I'd go through the whole business, and by the time I was convalescent I thought that everybody in the town would have heard that I had the cholera and that would do them good. It will wake them up, you see." " But they would not let me catch it.' Can't get to people who have the cholera-that is, I can get there, but I can't get away again. Of course, that wouldn't do any good, would it ? Would it, now ? " "Of coürse not," answered the clerk, ready to shout " lunatic" at the first sign of violence on the part of the stranger. ¡¡ú . " Ot course not, that's just what I .thought.' So I thought maybe I could get up a. gobdsjiinitatipn bf cholera/ and take , it^ .'ôyeç 'thieré. ' I'd have it break out soon - as I got well into town;- I'd 1 drop4;'right down:: in the street and; beging to' howl. I'd kick andI'yell and'.digj^myi! hails into the ground and turn somersaults.
