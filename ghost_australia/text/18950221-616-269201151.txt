THE FELL-THORPE MOST, By “ LUCY HARDY” (Mns C. Lord), Author of “ Our Bear Bogs,” etc,, etc. [ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.] “Sleepy Hollow/* as I have heard Fell Thorpo irreverently described by casual visitors, hut 1 loved the place well. It was one of those hundreds of pretty English villages lying nestled away amid green hills unit woods, whoso existence is practically unknown tcany save resi dents iu the vicinity. It had its “great house** near, but Sir Usury Colvi!, our squire, was x. middle-aged bachelor, who lived chiefly abroad or in London, only paying his country estate a brief visit in the shooting reason. There wrs no inducement for any family to bury itself in a remoto country place, without society, though my Uncle Thilip had been vicar at Fell-Thorpo for twenty years, and would not have exchanged the living for an archbishopric. A quiet, studious man, immersed iu his hooks, Fell Thorpe exactly suited him. Ho hated society; «jur village afforded none; his means were small; Fell-Thorpo was a cheap placo of resi dence. Ho was a good and earnest man in the performance of his clerical duties, but the most fervid zeal could not fill up the entire day with pastoral work amid so small a population. So that with all his duties to his flock, scrupu- , lously performed, Undo Philip had yet leisure ■ to pursue his beloved studies, and think out his I great always-to-be-written book ; I believe on | ahe subject of the differential calculus. Look ing back, I can understand what a sacrifice of inclination to duty Undo Philip made when ho consented to receive mo, a girl of eighteen, into his quiet household. My mother was Undo Philip’s only sister, and had eloped with an artist twenty years before, dying when I was about six years old. Uncle Philip had opposed her muiritigo as strongly as so gentle a creature could oppose anything, and it was partly iu cousequence of hyi desertion by his mother (who had lived with '£iiu in his Loudon curate days, and had kept his louse) that lie was was so ready to bury himedf with his books in a remoto country village. Little intercourse passed between tho brother and sister in after 3*ears, although no actual quarrel ever took place (I cannot imagine Uncle Philip quarrelling with anyone), and after my mother died, my father kept up no correspondence with his brother-in-law. Only when my father was dying did he be think him of tho relative of whom I knew nothing, and write, consigning his penniless orphan niece to his care. Of my father I would prefer not to speak ; he was my parent whatever were his short comings. I believe, iu his way, he loved me; he managed to keep mo at school until I was bixteen, and thou, when the lady principal, wearied of tho irregularity of his payments, politely but firmly declined to retain me longer, he shared his Bohemian menage with me. He had talent undoubtedly, and might have made hia mark in the world had he chosen to do so, but patrons and dealers weary of encouruging an artist who can never be relied upon to com plete a picture or keep an engagement, while a taste for cards and dice soon drains away a larger income than usually falls to the lot of even a successful painter. Two uncomfortable, restless years intervened between my quitting school and taking up 1113’residence with Uncle Philip—years of shifting about in cheap pen sions in France and Italy; of debts, duns, questionable Bohemian associates; years j which taught me to appreciate even steep}' Fell- ! Thorpe as a haven of refuge from a troublesome ! Uncle Philip had generously responded to the appeal to receive his sister’s child, and even made tho sacrifice (110 slight one to a man of his shy, recluse habits) of journeying so far ns , Hover to meet me and take me to my now home. I shall never forgot the anxious, puz/.led glances the good old man cast at me as 1 sat opposite to him iu the train, evidently regarding me as a strange creature, of whose habits and ways he was ignorant. ** A hope you will be happy iu your now home, my dear,** he said, at length. “I have never been accustomed to take care of 3toung ° “ I have always been accustomed to take tare of myself, Uncle Philip; at least, ever 1 since I left school,” I replied truthfully; and | Uncle Philip’s countenance lightened consider ably as he said, in a tone of relief, “Have you, indeed, my dear; I aai glad to hear it; I dare say we shall get on very well together.” Very well indeed we had got on for over four years. My arrival had made very little difference in Uncle Philip’s habits, and Deborah, tho old housekeeper, who was at first inclined to resent my coining, soon learned to tolerate me amicably when she found I never interfered with her. For myself, it was such a blessing to be spared all the mean Bhifts an-1 contrivances of our former existence ; never to have to confront insolent landladies or clamorous tradespeople, to live iu an atmos phere of solvency and respectability; for small as was Uncle Philip’s income, it was amply sufficient to supply all his modest requirements, and even leave"a little surjilus over. Moreover I had an occupation, aud occupied people are never dull. I had inherited something of my father’s artistic tastes, and had cultivated my capacity for painting under his tuition. Fell-Thorpe was rich iu “ bits” suitable for landscape paint ing ; and I was able, through a picture-dealer in London, who once patronised my father, to sell sufficient sketches and small studies to supply myself with a inodeBt little income, enough for all my private needs, uncle Philip absolutely refusiug to allow mo to contribute to the household expenses, which he declared I scarcely Increased. Bo we lived tranquilly to gether Uncle Philip deep as ever iu his books, I busy with my easel. Dull as Fell-Thorpo was, we possessed one source of excitement, we had a local ghost. Tho village church, though small, was an ex ceptionally beautiful one; it had been built early iu the fourteenth century by_ some un known benefactor, after the loving, lavish style in which our forefathers were then ■wont to erect sacred edifices, and through tho poverty of the local residents had happily escaped the beautifying” (by galleries and whitewash) of the eighteenth century, aud tho yet more destructive “restoring’' of the nineteenth. A convent of nuns had formerly adjoined tho church (tho conventual buildings had been destroyed at the Dissolution) and a curious sort of gallery at the west end of the church was still called the “Nuns’ Gallery.” It was shut in by an exquisitely carved stone tracery, which rendered tho occupants invisible below (unless they actually thrust their heads out of one single kind of “ oeil de hccuf” in the middle of this stoue screen) and yet enabled persons in the gallery to hear the service in the church below, and even to catch glimpses of the con gregation through the open spaces between tho carving. This gallery was disused now, but tradition asserted that it was once connected by a passage with the convent; and that the nuns had been wont to occupy it on great festivals, when they attended service in the church. Here was the locale of tho Fell-Thorpe ghost. In days of ydre, so ran the legend, a certain valiant knight deceased, leaving large estates to his eldest daughter Sibyl; but providing that, should she die without issue, they should descend to his 1 younger daughter Maud, child of his second wife. His widow, who proved the typical “wicked stepmother,*'had therefore a strong motive, if not to take the life of her step daughter, at least to keep her unmarried. This latter plan was easily carried out. Sybil was betrothed to a young knight who joined the Crusades; plausible evidence of hiB death was forged, and tho heart-broken girl easily per suaded to immure herself iu a convent. When her betrothed returned Bhe was for ever hidden from hia sight. Years rolled by, and some of the nuns, among them Sybil, now Sister Ave, migrated to the newly-elected cloister at Fell Thorpe. And it so chanced, on one high festival, when the nuns were singing behind their stone screen in the church gallery, that Sister Ave beheld among the congregation beneath, the lover whom she had long mourned as dead, alive and well, and with a fair young bride by his side. With one wild call on her lover’B name the nun thrust her head through the opening in the screen to gaze once more on his beloved features, and then sank back insensible, and expired, literally of a broken heart, as the scandalised sisterhood were carrying her away. And, tho story ran, on each anniversary of her death, a pallid face in nun’s coif and wimple -looked out of the gallery, aud a wailing cry resounded through the church. It was even added that sometimes the Bpectre “ named** some of the local residents, and that the persona so distinguished invariably died during the year; hut the ghost had not been “personally interviewed” for centuries, ns its manifestations only took place at mid night, and tradition had not preserved the exact date of Lady Sybil’s tragic demise. The legend was remembered because Fell Thorpe folk had so little to talk about. The old sexton, and even Philip, conscientiously related the story to any stray visitor who was taken over the church; and the former, at least, devoutly believed in it. Still, as no one . -in the village was likely to be in the church at the hours the ghost “ walked** (we were far too sleepy for “ watch-night** or kindred services), (399) “ our local spectre was at least a most inoffensive i Among our few resident neighbors wore an old major and his wife, the latter rather an invalid. They had come to Fell- Thorpo some years ago, and apparently lacked the energy to go away again. Their little house suited them; Mrs Grant was benefited by the country air; they found variety in an occasional visit to Hath or Buxton, and returned to Fell-Thorpo always talking of removing, but never carrying' out their threat. Undo Philip and tho major became great cronies. From lack of other occupation, Major Grant became an enthusiastic archmologist. He took in a quantity of litera ture on the subject—remarkably dull publica tions they appeared to me—and ho was always prowling about tho church and finding (or imag ing) some hitherto undiscovered attraction m its hoary stones. He lmd lately lighted upon a small window in the chancel, now built up, and had conceived tho theory that this was one of the aucieut “lepers’ windows” (made to allow tho victims of that fearful disease to behold from without tho church sacred rites they might not mingle with tho congregation to share in), and was simply wild to have this window re opened and tilled with stained glass. He suc ceeded in infecting Uncle Philip with his enthu siasm, but restorations cost money. This con sideration, however, by no means damped the major’s zeal. His idea was that we should gather all we possibly could in the neighbor hood, and then make an appeal to tho gene rosity of the public in tho newspapers, setting forth how we had done our little all, and now appealed to “ lovers of archaeology” to help us to complete our good work. “I’ll tell you what I’ll do myself,” said the major, “I’ll give you a beautiful old seven teenth century alms-box in carved oak—I picked it up cheaply abroad one year—and you can set it up in the church and. invito contributions for our fuud. Why, my dear fellow, surely even the poor folk will feel a little interest m so important, so local, an object. Now Sunday woek is your harvest thanksgiving—by*the• way, Sir Henry will be down here then—you just preach a good, impressive sermon, and point" out tho architectural gem I have dis covered, and invite liberal contributions.” “Kveryoue is poor here,” sighed uncle Phillip. ‘•Poor people can give something—look what. a year this has been for tho farmers (it was sunny 18S7), beside wo never had any real local Jubilee Memorial. Now, the restoration of this interesting—this glorious—window, would be a very fitting one.” Carried away by the tide of enthusiasm, Uncle Philip readily consented to exert his best eloquence to induce tho congregation to believe that to contribute to our “ Restoration Fuud” would be the most appropriate form of evincing tlieir thankfulness for the harvest of 1S87 and the Accession of 1837. “ But we really cannot—kuowing the circum stances of the congregation expect above-” “Ten pounds,” interpolated tho major; “ re member Sir Henry will be there and all his servants.” “No,no,say seven—well, maybe rather over. Of course we may gather more by special house to house appeals.” The festival day came, and Uncle Philip preached one of his best sermons; he really was eloquent sometimes, though he varied consider ably, often preaching admirable, scholarly dis courses, but completely “ over tho heads” of the rustic congregation, who had never read the Fathers and know nothing of early heresies. But on this occasion Uncle Phillip laid aside allusions to Gnostics and Manicheans, and preached in a style comprehensible to his hearers; and I felt sanguine as regards the col lection we should find in the box “our neigh bor’s kind gilt,” as unde Philip explained this receptacle to bo. Unfortunately tho major and his wife were absent, also our senior church warden ; tho former obliged to stare earlier than usual tor Buxton in consequence of a fit of gout; the latter ill in bod. But both had promised to forward contributions to our “ Window Res toration fund,” so their absence would not affect us financially. “I will leave the box unopened until Satur ay,” remarked Uncle Philip as we ate cur early dinner. “X should like Smith (the churchwarden) to bo present, and it is possible that as there is a saints*-day service this week a fori fie more may be added to the contents of the box after to-day.” I knew that Smith had somewhat “cold watered” tho scheme of the collecting box, and understood that Uncle Philip was looking for ward to a mild triumph wheu it was unlocked. Saturday afternoon accordingly my uncle, Mr Smith (the keeper of the village shop and vicar’s churchwarden) repaired to the church, I accompanying them as a curious spectator. “ And now' to see what our good neighbors have done for us,” said UnclejPhilip, as ne un locked the box and raised the lid. Could we believe our eyes ? Uncle Philip fairly rubbed his as if to make sure that he was not the victim of some strange optical delusion. Yet. gaze as ho would, count as ho would, the fact remained that eightpence in coppers and two peppermint drops represented the entire “ thank offerings” of the congregation. Mr Smith first broke the awful silence. “I never did hold with this new- fangled idea of the major’s about a box.” be remarked solemnly. “ Perhaps,” said Uncle Philip, in the tone of one who catches at a straw, “ people made a mistake and put their money into the poor \Ve boasted an antique receptacle so labelled, which was opened quarterly, and itscontonts (if any) distributed among a few needy widows. It has been recently so emptied, and was found empty still. Uncle Philip was a mild man, and a patient, but worms turn at last. He preached next day in a stylo wholly novel to his hearers, and, for once, the entire congregation sat awake &ud; attentive, tho bucolic mind slowly gathering that “ passon do seem terrible put about like by suimnat.” I sincerely hoped that Sir Henry, whom we all looked upon as the worst offender, would feel pricked in his con science, and it seemed as if tais was the case, for the baronet lingered after the congregation had dispersed, and said good ^ huinorcdly, “Well, Mr Archer, you don’t give us a very good character for liberality, I really think you aro a bit hard on us, though.” “I have my duty to perform and my message to deliver, Sir Henry,” said my uncle, gravely. “ Ye3, of course. Only you know we are not Cra*sus down here, and if each gives according to hip ability-” “Aro you aware of the amount of last Sun day’s collection r'” aBkea my uncle. “ Not at all. I should recognise my own con tribution. though.” “ Oh, would you,” said Uncle Philip, with a curious little smile, “then if you will accom pany me to the vestry I shall have pleasure in showing you what the liberality of FelUThorpe has considered an appropriate thank-offering at their jubilee harvest festival.” We entered tho vestry; Uncle Philip unlocked the quaint antique safe which contained the Communion plate, and drew out a bag which he emptied on the table. “ Six pennies, two half-pennies, three, no, four farthings, and two peppermint drops. I leave it to you to identify your own contribution, Sir Henry,” said Uncle Philip, with sarcastic politeness, adding, “I scarcely think the remarks I made regarding this collection were unjustified,” Sir Henry stood with an expression or blank amazement upon his ruddy good- humored “But, my dear sir, there’s something alto gether wrong here.” “ Exactly what I said thi3 morning—it is sadly, lamentably wrong.” “But I mean,” almost shouted the baronet, “ that this isn’t the real collection. I alone put in five pounds; I gave a five-pound gold piece, one of the newly-coined Jubilee ones. It occurred to me that you might get a trifle more for it as a curiosity. Mr Archer, the box has been robbed.” We returned to the church, and scrutinised the box closely. Neither the lock nor the box, bore the least signs of having been tampered with—and yet, where was the gold fi ve-pound piece? “The box has a large opening,” Baid Sir Henry. “It would not bo difficult to insert a thin stick or piece of whale-bone, smeared with bird-lime, and so extract the coins. I have heard of such things being done before.” “ But there iB no one here likely to do such a wicked thing,” said Uncle Philip, warming to the defence of his parishioners. “Well, I don’t know. Fell-Thorpe can furnish a poacher or two, my gamekeepers tell me. It is clear that the box has been robbed, Mr Archer, and you ought to have the matter investigated. By the way,” and the baronet paused before leaving tho vestry, “ do you keep that fine Sacramental plate in the church?” It really was fine plate, unusually valuable to be in use in a village fane. Some two centuries ago it had been presented to the church by a pious maiden lady, who bequeathed her modest savings for the purpose of replacing “ ye altar plate and furniture,” which Waller’s sacri* ligious troopers had plundered in the Civil Wars. Apart from their intrinsic value, the massive chalices and paten were exquisite specimens of silversmiths’ workmanship, and might have graced a cathedral. “ Where should I keep tho Communion plate but here; it has been safe in this vestry for two. centuries and more,” said Uncle Philip. “Well, it seems clear.that thieves have carried off something already from the church, and I hope they will not pay you another visit,” said Sir Henry, and departed, leaving Uncle Philip in a condition of the deepest dejec* “I thought my flock misers—am 1 to be licvo thorn thieves also ? ” he asked, in despairing tones. Tho village constable and Mr Smith were both summoned to give counsel in tho matter, but without much good result, tho former frankly avowing that tho matter “ heat him; ” tho latter repeating that ho had “ never held ” with tho box. A plate held at , tho church door would have obviated all risk of robbery. Mr Smith, however, made one prac tical suggestion that certain pieces of money should bo marked and placed in the box. Should the theft be repeated and these coins i changed iu the village they might lead to the identification of the tKief. Uncle Phil p listened dejectedly to a scheme which seamed likely to place him in the unenviable position of a prosecutor of oue of his own .parishioners ; but. Mr Smith was insistent, and some coins duly marked were dropped into the box. Wo , spent a miserable evening at the Vicarage. . Uncle Philip, an almost morbidly conscientious man, gave himself up utterly to self-reproaches. If, after twenty years’ pastoral work, his teachings had borne no better fruit than this, it was a clear proof that he had mistaken his ‘vocation—ho was untit for his post, and so on ; until Deborah, who was clearing the table, openly “ dratted’’ tho major and Ids scheme of restoration. “ If he’d a been content to leave the church as ho found it, there’n a been no box to rob, and master wouldn’t a been worrited.” Truly, “les absents out toujours tort.” Every one seemed to put all the blame on poor innocent Major Grant. Uncle Philip was equally despondent when Monday came; so much so, that in the afternoon I made up my mind t;* go off and see if the Grants had re turned, as they had arranged to do on this day. Major Grant was a cheery little body, and would pay him a visit. Besides. I was naturally anxious to be the first to announce the startling news of the suspected robbery. 14 You’ll be caught iu the raiu, Miss Annie, I’m thinking,” remarked Deborah, as she saw me about to set out on my expedition. I had a good two miles’ walk before me, the Grants living at the extreme end of the parieh. “ If it rains I may wait to dinner and walk back with the major afterwards,” I said; “don’t let Uncle Philip wait fox me if I am not back to tea, Deborah.” Deborah gave a sniff, which I knew meant that Bho would see that Uncle Philip waited for no one. I was often accustomed to drop in to meals at the Grants, and the major to return the compliment at the Vicarage; but the Grants still kept up the fashion of a late dinner at six o’clock, while we contented ourselves with the humble mid-day repast. I think, however, Deborah’s housekeeping wa9 the more liberal of the two. Mrs Grant was always glad to welcome a visitor to break the monotony of her quasi'invalid life, and wo had a fiction of reading French and Italian together which served as an excuse lor frequent visits. Before 1 had gone far on my way, however, the rain began to descend. I have before mentioned that I sketched and painted. I had lately been finishing some small studies of the views from our church tower, and had taken the freedom, without consulting Uncle Philip, to make use of the “ Nuns’ Gallery” as a kind of temporary studio. The old woman who cleaned, or was sup posed to clean, the church, readily agreed to sweep and dust out this disused part of the edi fice for my convenience, and here I was wont, after concluding my day’s painting on the tower, to stow away my palette, paints and canvas, instead of troubling to carry them to and fro daily as I did the great church key. Now, as the raiu began to descend, I remem bered that I had lett my waterproof cloak as well as my painting gear iu the Nuns’ Gallery. Luckily I had the key of the church in my pocket. I seldom went out without it, Uncle Philip possessing a duplicate! It was tut a step across tho road to the church, and I soon found ray property, but as 1 turned to desceud tho dark winding stairs which led from the Nuns’ Gallery I stumbled, and, in the effort to save myselr, foil against the half-opened door which shut off the cud of tho staircase. It closed with a slum, and I immediately remembered that it was only opened by an outsido latch, conse quently I was caught in a trap. I groped and fumbled, and hurt my lingers in vain. It was impossible to open the door from within, and I resigned myselr to the inevitable. I was less alarmed at ray predicament than many girls of my age would have been. As regards the ghostly associations of the gallery I was utterly sceptical. My life, before coming to Fell-Thorpe had been too full of practical cares and anxieties to leave much room for imagina tive terrors. I had faced the stern realities of life too early to be much troubled with “nerves.” I BbouId bo missed and inquired for as the evening drew on, and Deborah at least knew that I was in the habit of making sketches from the church tower. They were sure to lock for me here when it was discovered that I was not at the major’s. It was pro voking to bo thus caged, and I hoped that I should he released before I began to grow hungry, hut any fears of a supernatural visita tion in the gallery never crossed my mind. To beguile the time, I commenced a sketch of the church as seen from my eyrie, and thus occupied, worked until the'evening shades began to fall. Seven o’clock, eight, the church was growing dark now, and I began to feel chilly (though it was warm weather), tired and decidedly hungry. Well, it could not^ be long before 1 was missed and sought f:>r, so I wrapped myself in my cloak, and nestling my self into a convenient angle of the wall, set my self to await release as patiently as might be. At last I fell aBloep. I awoke suddenly, with a sensation of having slumbered for weeks, and was startled to see a light in the chuich below. I sprang up, and was about to call out, when a voice fell on my ear. “ Nobody ain’t there,” and the door at the foot of tho staircase, which had apparently been opened, gave a click. “ I’d have settled ’um if there had,” growled another tone. Peering cautiously through the interstices of the stonework, I perceived, iu the nave, two men, one of whom I recognised as Roger Simmons, a village loafer, strongly suspected of poaching proclivities the other a most vilHauous looking man, who carried in his hand a heavy bludgeon, and a bag over his arm. Perhaps the ups and downs of my former life had taught me self-control, fori checked my first imoulse to call out, and waited. There was little doubt that I was face to face with the robbers of our alms-box, equally little doubt that it would be wise to conceal my presence. Squeezed against the front of the gallery I held my breath and watched. “ Come on,” said the strange man, im patiently throwing down his bagaud extracting therefrom some toolB. “ What (with an oath) are you staring about for ? “ There’s t’ ghaist,” half blubbered Roger, who seemed as if dragged on against his will. “I be mortal feared to think wc may see she.'* The elder man swore roundly at Roger’s cowardice and superstition in terms which I re frain to quote. “ Meastmy* said Roger, desperately, in the tones of one making a last appeal; “ 1 can’t go for to do it. Why, my old dame ’ud break her heart to think of them holy things beiDg touched ; no good ’ll come of it, you’ll see— taint like taking silver out o’ passon’a own house!” “No, I don’t think tnnt your ‘passon,’ as you call him, deals in such silver,” said the other ruffian, coolly, as he sorted and selected his tools; “but you village fools don’t know valuables when you see them. To think!” he added, with another oath, “ that it was just by | chance I caught sight of these things the Sunday I came to church to gammon you good folks, and you only telling me of the haul I might make out of the alms-box. By the way, hero goes again,” and by the device which Sir Henry had suggested—a bit of whalebone apparently smeared with some sticky substance, : the box was again rifled with a dexterity which told of long practice. “ It’s no use standing shaking and shivering (now,” weut on the remorseless robber; ‘‘'you’re in for it all the way; you helped to rob the poor box last week, and you’ve got to show me where the silver’s kept now, so come along and no more talking.” Hesitating and trembling, Die less courageous thief followed towards tho vestry, murmuring about his “dame/' “passon,” “f ghaist,” religious scruples and superstitious terror warring with the the power his fellow-criminal had obtained over him. I had not lived for over four years at Fell Thorpe without becoming imbued with some of the sentiments of the place, and the sacreligious theft to be perpetrated upon our treasured altar vessels roused me to intense indignation. An idea occurred to me, I might run some risk, but I would chance that. Pressing my face against the openings of the carving I gave ventto a long sighing groan, and was delighted to hear the sound greeted by an absolute yell from Roger. “ T* "haist, it be she,” he cried, and would have rushed from the church had not his com panion held him. „ “ Wait a bit, you fool,” whispsred this latter, but I was pleased to detect a decided tremor in his voice. I gave vent to another melancholy Sx<?li loud enough to be audible below. ” Curse it, thero’ssome one spying up there,” cried the stranger, flashing his bull’s eye lantern on tho gallery. A sudden inspiration, born of the danger wnich I knew I was in, flashed upon me. I hastily wrapped mv handkerchief round my face, drew the dark cloak over my head, and thus having arranged up a very fair imita tion of a nun’s head gear, thruat my head out of the opening where tradition asserted Lady Sybil had protruded hers, and poured out a loud wailing cry like a veritable Banshee. Cold and terror doubtless gave to my voice a wierd sound enough. Tho effect of my appearance was magical. Roger fled yelling to the door, end his companion was appearautly now more solicitous to outstrip him than to detain him—in a second or two the men had vanished, leaving their tools and lantern behind them in Iheir flight. It was some time before I ventured to descend tho | stairs; aud then found to my great relief, that tho door, which one or other of the thieves had opened (I suppose to see if anyone was hiding on the staircase) had not quite closed. As I stepped out into tho church, tho outer door opened, I shrank back into tho darkness, but was relieved to see only Undo Philip, to whom 1 rushed; and rather startled the kind old man by bursting into a convulsive fit of sobbing in his arms. “ There, my clear, there,” he said soothingly, patting my head, “I suppose you got 3’ourself shut in somehow by accident, and it’s sadly uufortunate that you should have been kept j here so long; midnight, bless mo,” as the clock } chimed above us. “But the fact is that I was called out just as I was going to bed, to baptise , a dying child at the other end of tho parish, and i when I came back aud found you still missing, I, of course, started off first to the major’s, where Deborah said you had gone. The Grants have not yet como home, and I found the house | empty and locked up. But us I came back, I | remembered that you sometimes sketched at the I church, and thought it just possible that you I might be in here, particularly as the outer door [ was ajar—careless of you to leave it so, by the way, my love—but, eh, what’s this,” and Uncle 1 Philip broke of! his narrative as hiB eye fell ' upon the fools and lantern on the floor, visible ! by tho light of a similar bull’s eye which he himself carried, a serviceable guide for bis nocturnal perambulations over our dark country I rapidly explained my adventure, and how I had played upon the superstitious fears of the thieves to save our altar plate. Uncle Philip was delighted. “ You ran some risk, though, my brave, clever little girl,” he said at length, after laughing heartily at my description of the abrupt departure of the thieves, “aud I am thankful all has ended as it did. And now, Annie, remember, not a word of this adventure to any one for a day or two. I think I see my way to get back some of our lost almsbox col lection.” Early next morning Uncle Philip paid a visit to Roger, who lived with his old mother, a re spectable widow, to whom her son’s idle and discreditable courses were a source cf siucere regret. It was, indeed, consideration for old Mrs Simmons, whom evory one liked and pitied, which had made Sir Henry’s head gamekeeper somewhat blind to Roger’s more than suspected poaching proclivities. Tho village ne'er-do-weel was now, however, laid up in bed; groaning under the newly-awakened terrors of a guilty conscience, and a firm belief that ho should not long survive the ghostly warning which he be lieved himself to have received from Lady Sybil’s wrath. He needed no urging to pour out all his guilty secret to Uncle Philip, con fessing how he had long had secret dealings with the stranger, a noted London “cracks man,” regarding the disposal of his poached game; how this “Bill” had come down to lodge at his mother’s cottage for change of air (burglars, like other people, may take an occasional holiday), and how the ; announcement of our proposed collection for j the Restoration Fund suggested to the London thief an opportunity for combining professional business with pleasure. Roger, already in his i power from their previous illicit transactions, ! was a hopeless tool iu his hands. Like a once famous London burglar, Mr Brown, as the thief chose to he called, passed for an extremely respectable, even religious, kind of man, and quite won poor dame Simmons’ heart by the regularity with which he accompanied her to church on Sunday mornings, a thing she could never induce her son to do. We have seen how I piously Mr Brown employed himself during service time by “taking notes” of our local valuables, with a view to their ultimate plunder. Uncle Philip had the satisfaction of recovering from tho penitent Roger a part of the spoils of our almsbox, notably the gold five pound piece. The congregation had come for ward very handsomely after all, and 1 think I Uncle Phillip preached to himself as well as to his hearers when he delivered himself of an elo quent harangue against “ rash and uncharitable judgments” in his next sermon. The stolen coins, or at least the larger part of them, had been concealed in a hiding-place near Roger’s cottago, and Mr Brown had been in such haste to catch tho next train to London (one stopped in tho early hours of the morning at a station some five miles off) that he had actually struck straight away across country to Byford Junction, without delaying even to fetch his clothes from Mrs Simmons’. I wonder if this worthy believed in the ghost, or sus pected a police ambush ? Any way he disap peared, and Fell-Thorpe Baw him no more. There was no doubt about Roger’s view of the affair. Uncle Philip felt bound to explain the real state of affairs to him, when the man as serted the ghost had appeared to him, called him by name, and therefore sealed his doom. But Roger rejected all attempts at explana tion. If, as Uncle Philip asserted, I was iu the gallery, well, like the Mousquetaire in the “Ingoldsby Legends,” Roger could only declare “ il y a deux.” “I know what I seed, sir,” he persisted, with a stolid obstinacy pecu liar to the bucolic organisation: and Uncle Philip was silenced. Of course we ought to have prosecuted Roger; so said Sir Henry, and the major, and even Uncle Philip. But the fellow was only the minor criminal after all. He had received a terrible fright, was apparently sincerely peni tent, aud had made all the reparation in his power. Village communities are always glad to be rid of a local black sheep quietly, with out scandal. Our local magnates decided to act like the kindly suburban gardeners who, loth to crush the snails which they remove from their own cabbages, quietly drop them over their neighbor’s palings. Roger was offered his liberty ou the same terms accorded to many an ancient wrong* doer, on the condition that he “presently transported himself forth of our dominions.” Sir Henry discovered that a re cruiting-sergeant waB busy at Byford, and Roger, who was a stout,-well-grown young fellow enough, was readily enrolled amongst the new recruits. We kept his secret; only, like the Justice in ti e “Critic,” piously hoping that the church robber might, in future “ Defend his country’b laws With half the vigor that he broke them all.” I wqb glad to learn in after years that such actually proved the caso. Work, and discipline, and removal from evil associates, worked wonders for Roger, ‘as these factors have done for many another apparent ne’er-do-weel who has “ joined the colors.’’ As Uncle Phillip wrote to me a month ago, no one^coulti have recognised the idle, poaching loafer of days gone by in the smart young Boldier who was paying his mother a visit during his furlough, on the return of his regiment from abroad, where he had served with much credit during j one of our ‘ little wars.’ “ Lady Sybil’s ghost” saved more than the altar plate,” laughed good natured Sir Henry; and immoral as our leniency may have been, I am glad that Roger, more weak than wicked, was saved the stigma of the jail, if only for his old mother’s sake. We gained our window without applying to the general public. Sir Henry was liberal enough to make up the deficiency in our local fund, remarking to Undo Phillip that he thought the “lady who saved the altar plate” deserved Borne recompense, aud that he knew I, as well as Uncle Phillip and the major, desired to see the church beautified. Sir Henry is a kindly pleasant man, I ought to know, seeing I have been his niece for some years now. Arthur, my husband aud Sir Henry’s presumptive heir, tells me that it was his uncle’s praises of “the girl who kept her head in circum stances where many people would have screamed and fainted,” which first made him desirous of staying at Fell-Thorpe Hall, and making the acquaintance of this female paragon. “ Lady Sybil ” is still my nickname from Sir Not very long ago I happened to take up a work on the local traditions and superstitions current in that part of England in which Fell Thorpe is located. Our ghost was described in its pages ; and I read, with much interest, that “ as late as the Jubilee year ” this spectre was beheld by “ credible witnesses ’»and by its timely apparition prevented an attempted burglary in the church. It is always unkind to spoil a good story, so “ Lady Sybil ” has allowed this interesting narrative, founded pre sumably on the authority of Roger or Mr Brown, either of whom may have let out some scraps of the occurrence, concealing of course their own share therein, to pass uncontra dicted, and our local ghost may still be credited with the beneficent guardianship of our sacred valuables. _
