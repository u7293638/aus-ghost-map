FEMALE SUFFRAGE. In the Court of Common Pleas on November 9th, Lord Chief Justice Bovill, with Justices Willes, Byles, and Keating sitting in banco, judgment was given in the case of " Charlton, appellant, v. Lings, respondent," the appeal from a decision of the revising barrister for Manchester, which was argued on November 7. The Lord Chief Justice and the other Judges delivered separate judgments, but they all agreed that there was not sufficient authority for saying that by the common law women had had a right to vote for members of Parliament; whilst, on the other hand, there was the uninterrupted practice of centuries to show that women had not voted. There was no reported case in favour of thevote, except that in a note to " Olive v. Ingram " there was reference to a manuscript report of a case to show that women could vote. This note was only to be found in 7 "Modern Reports," whilst there was no reference to any such case in Strange ; and Lord Coke gave his express opinion the other way. In his (the Chief Justice's) opinion the Reform Act of 1867 in saying that men should vote, although considered in conjunction with Sir John Remilly's Act, did not entitle women to vote. The term nen in the Reform Act did not include women; and even if it did, then women would come within the term " inca- pacitated." For these reasons he thought that the decision of the revising barrister refusing the vote should be affirmed, but he also thought that it was a case in which no costs should be allowed. Mr. Justice Byles said that he hoped that their unanimous decision, coupled with the unanimous decision of the Court of Session in Scotland, would for ever exorcise and lay this ghost of a doubt which ought never to have arisen.
