V~eictoria Theatre. T~E nearness of the Christmas holidays must have doubtless been the cause of rather a slack house last night, but the drama of "The Ticket-of-Leave Man" was played with the same sterling ability which has hitherto characterised the performance of this company, with Mr. Dillon, Miss E. Pender, and Miss Marion Willis, as the leading actors. The whole of the powerful caste will appear this evening in the tragedy of Hamlet, the itle role being sustained by Mr. W. Dillon, and that of Ophelia by Miss E. Pender, supported by the whole strength of this powerful company, assisted by Mr. T. E. Ellis as the Ghost. There will be addi tional entertainments, the performances being for the benefit of the Seamen's Strike in Sydney. This rallying cry will, we are cer tain, result in an inmense gathering this evemning.
