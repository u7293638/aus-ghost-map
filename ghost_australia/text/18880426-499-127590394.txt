THE ' BEKEBEE.'' gf- Allow mi spaoe in your valuable paper to fr attention to tha horrible treatment wm .Mr. James M'Garrigal has beon re cef % at tho hands of the southern handi ouPra Buioe he has been down there, now oJtwo years. Ho has not had the ghost of a,hw of winning anvthing. They must han (Jtp on their own opiniou of a man, and not ie anything in Sydney to warrant him ctingr the starts ho is getting now. He was k on by the handiouppors hero to that extent Aat he had to either seek fresh fields or Ifivenp running altogether. But instead of pettftring himsolt in the fresh fields he iB .weafed wnrin than ever. What iu tho name ^of reason do thoy moan by aBkinp a man who lias never shown anything better than half Booond over evona.to jjivo evoh- timers a start. As for the Newcastle Handicap, thehandi oappera must have followed tho other handi oappera blindfold, for they havo only given him ' three yards from Samuols, the groat flyer, two yards from Joe Price, aud ono yard from T. Malono. These aro man who have proved that they can boat ovon timo badly. Now, Mr. Editor, any parson that reads the RBifEREE regularly will own that he has had' 'Ihuythiap like justioo shown him. I Jiopo that h« will he given a fair show in Borne of the oomlng handicaps, for a more honest pad never laoed a shop: Ho is tho worst treated Qaoonslander that over ran in Sydney. Hopipg that yon will find room in your paper for tlieso faw romarks. — 1 am, '&o.; Queensland, April 10. PAIR PLAY. [It iB no doiibt very kind on Fair Play'B pu,rt to write in thia strain about M'Garrigul, but as he's so well known to thehandioappera it is unnecessary for me to Bay unything, ex cept that I don't agree with Pair Play in any «ne particular. — Ath.
