SATURDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1878. The embassy dinner—the dinner with the free railway pass taint, which was apparent in the assemblage—took place yesterday evening, and we pro- ceed to deal with the utterances of the delegates. Of the swam it has been declared that the sweetest song is the last it sings. The members of the em- bassy have not been generally compared to swans. Their mission is rather held to be that of the wild goose ; but still there was a sort of climax in the final utterance, and Mr. BERRY'S address may with justice be described as the wildest and most threatening of all his reform orations. The references to the Imperial despatch, which has so mate- rially changed the situation, were alter- nately vague and violent in character. As to the missing bill of particulars with regard to the crimes of the Council, the Chief Secretary says he has not had time to prepare his case, but he will do that on the voyage home. And in the absence of a case, the lion, gentleman took refuge in the time-honoured precept to abuse the other side, and attributed motives 'to the " oli- " garchy" and to the Opposition press which must considerably astonish the world at large. The only parallel he could find for the conduct of the press was the action of the Southern senator, who struck down CHARLES SUMNER in the Capitol, and it is necessary, he says, to put a check upon the Council in order to secure a free people against Chinamen, to provide that the in- dustrious man shall go upon the land, and to insure a system of free, secular, and compulsory education. People may ask themselves, is all this a dream ? They may inquire, has the Council ever had a word to say on the Chinese ques- tion, is not the land free for every man to go upon, and did not the Coun- cil consent at once to the bill which Mr. BERRY voted against, and which made a free, secular, and compulsory educa- tional system the law of the land? And we can imagine people declining to believe that any sane man, let alone a responsible Minister, could indulge in any such assertions as those attributed to the Chief Secretary. Our reply must be to refer them to the verbatim record, which appears in another column. It will be found that the lack of secu- rity with regard to the Chinese, the land, and free and secular education are the heads of the plea for reform which the Chief Secretary is to fill in at leisure. And if he and Professor PEAR- SON do work at any document of the kind, we can only say that when it is ready for publication its proper place will be a comic periodical. The most interesting portion of the address is, of course, that which refers to the despatch of tho Secretary of State. In the first place, the Chief Secretary says that he did not know of its arrival until long after Parliament had been prorogued, so that any blame for allowing the House to disperse in ignorance of the fact that the mis- sion had been vetoed must be trans- ferred from Mr. BERRY'S to other shoulders. In the next place, he declares that the despatch is of a highly comforting character. We are told in it that an appeal to the Im- perial Parliament to give effect to the mature and deliberate will of the people would be justifiable as a " last resort," and the lion, gentleman with triumph puts the question—when are we to sup- pose that the last resort has been arrived at ? He has only to read the despatch for an answer. The Secretary of State was assured by Mr. BERRY that the Minis- terial Reform Bill was universally accepted by the country, and that it would be put before the Council in a spirit of " con " cession and conciliation." And on those suppositions-which are not true, in fact—the Secretary of State intimates that "the rejection by the " Legislative Council of this scheme on " the first occasion and under the cir- " cumstances surrounding the case," would not warrant an appeal to England, and would not justify him in asking the Imperial Parliament to interfere. What plainer statement does the party want ? However, in the face of it, Mr. BERRY contends that the " last resort " has been reached already. The delegates cannot, he declares, come back unsuccessful, for the Secretary of State cannot want " broken heads and houses in flames." We are asked in all soberness to believe that this free colony, in which liberty may be in danger of degenerating to licence, but is certainly exposed to no other peril, is so tyrannised over, and is so trodden down, that the population is ready to seek deliverance by revolution. The Chief Secretary declares in fervid tones that, in the lack of immediate aid from Eng- land to crush the oligarchy, there is nothing left for the bondsmen of Vic- toria but either an abject surrender to the Council or a resort to a contest " marked by the humiliation-the per " petual humiliation- of opponents, and " accompanied by circumstances and " events we should all deplore, and which " could not be read in future history " with satisfaction." In other words, if the Secretary of State declines to eat his words and reverse his despatch ; if he will not interfere, and interfere on Mr. BERRY'S side, then the mob will rise. We shall have, to use the Chief Secretary'!; phrase, " broken heads and " houses in flames ;" that is to say, if the words have any meaning, that the country will be given over to rapine and pillage. The Kelly gang may well pray to live until these days come, for, then banks will be plundered with impunity, warehouses will be gutted in town, and the owners of large estates will be assailed in the country. Such is the picture conjured by the words of the Chief Secretary ; and we can only say that the language is a libel upon the colony. If it is used for purposes of intimidation here it will signally fail, and it is not to be supposed for an instant that it will in any way influence the Colonial Office. The powers and authorities there will know very well that the reform issue is not of the ret hot urgency described, and that such reform as is really needed can be readily obtained within the colony by any Minister who chooses to ask for it. There is every reason to believe that Mr. SERVICE'S proposal could be carried at once into law. If he so pleased, Mr. BERRY could make the Council a popular house by an extension of the franchise, he could make it a responsible House by subjecting it conjointly with the Assembly to dissolutions ; and he could secure finality and avert deadlocks by the two Houses sitting together-an arrangement which would give the Assembly a power of two to one, and would insure any heavy and hearty vote of the people becoming law. What more can be re- quired by any democrat with a trace of prudence left in him ? These terms are open to Mr. BERRY to accept, and in this fact we have the simple but effectual reply to his roars that the "last resort" outside of violence has been arrived at. Mr. PEARSON was milk-and-water. His feeble platitudes were hardly listened to by the banquetters, and require no comment from us. Mr. BERRY'S violence and wildness threw, in fact, all other incidents into the shade. The hon. gentleman, in his final remarks, assured his hearers that he went home with the firm belief that request could not be refused, because England would be aware that the consequent danger would be to her as well as to us. And the delegates, he added, would not forget that while they asked the Imperial Goernment to effect their object one way, yet that we could do it in the colony in another—by mob law and revolution. And with this threat on their lips the commissioners leave us, to bully the Colonial Office, to talk of "broken heads and houses in "flames," and to ask for a loan of five millions on Victorian security. After the "cosmopolitanism in ex- "celsis" of Mr. GLADSTONE'S "Nest of "Kin" article in the North American Review, it is refreshing to turn to the sober and matter-of-fact review of the position and prospects of England and America as manufacturing competitors, which Mr. JAMES HENDERSON contri- butes to the Contemporary Review. Mr. GLADSTONE writes from impulse, not unmixed, perhaps, with a craving for praise and admiration. He irri- tated the Northern States by a rash statement made during the progress of the civil war ; and, by way of reparation, he promises America the reversion of England's manufacturing and commercial supre- macy. But his article is that of a rhetorician, who deals chiefly in brilliant generalities. Mr. HENDERSON, on the other hand, crosses the Atlantic, visits the chief seats of manufacturing industry, examines the cost of production and the conditions of competition, forms his con- clusions from these data, and gives the public the results of his inquiries as a " not unacceptable contribution to the " discussion of this important and most interesting subject " He unreservedly admits that Ameri- can calicoes have been imported into Manchester, where they have undersold those of local manufacture. For a twelvemonth past they have been intro- duced into our own market, also at very low rates. "Two years ago," writes Mr. HENDERSON, "I found this process in " full operation in Canada Merchants " in Montreal assured me that United " States calicoes were being delivered to " them considerably below the prices, cur- " rent for the same goods in Boston and " New York. Ironfounders and ma- " chine makers in the province of On- " tario had the same story to tell with " respect to their own trade. Their "markets in Canada were flooded by "the surplus stocks of their competitors in the United States, at prices which "were far below the actual cost of pro- " duction " This is what is technically called " slaughtering," and is described by Mr. HENDERSON as "a reckless " sacrifice of manufactured goods at "whaever price they will bring, so " that the pressing want for immediate " cash may be supplied. " Consignments of American goods have been made to this market under pre- cisely similar circumstances. We have seen cases of new books from New York publishers sold in Melbourne for little more than the cost of then binding, and at a reduction of 70 per cent on their retail price in that city. Slate and marble mantel- pieces, hardware, and other commodities, have also been "slaughtered" in the same way. In fact, as Mr. HENDERSON remarks, "the extent to which this " system of trading is indulged in in " the United States, during a time of "commercial depression, almost sur- "passes belief. its results may be "traced in the registers of the bank- "ruptcy courts of that country." But this sort of competition will be as fugitive as it is factitious, and the only effect of selling American goods under cost price in foreign markets is the impoverishment of the country that exports for the benefit of that which imports them. If, for example, a few tons of American dollars were sent abroad to be sold for two or three shil- lings each, the sacrifice of values would be precisely equivalent to that which is incurred when the calicoes of Massa- chusetts or the hardware manufactures of Connecticut are sold for whatever they will fetch in Canada, Great Britain, or Australia. England's geeatest defence against American competition is the protective policy of the United States , for, as Mr. HENDERSON justly observes, " the more " absolute the system of protection main- " tained, and the heavier the duties levied " upon the imports into the United States, "the more thoroughly are her manufac- "turers disqualified from competing suc- " cessfully with those of Great Britain, because, practically, "the Customhouse "cordon which the Americans have " established is like the Chinese wall "it debars the intioduction of foreign "manufactures, it is true, but it is "equally as effectie in preventing the "exportation of their own." But Mr. HENDERSON has here stated the case too favourably for the other side. The high tariff of the United States may restrict, bul it does no1 " debar, the introduction «. of foreign manufactures " The im portation of theso has been, it is true, steadily diminishing during the last few j ears, owing td the distress which has prevailed in America, but the following figmes, taken from documents issued by the Buieau of Statistics at Washington, will prove that even duties which aie in tended to bo piohibitivo aie impotent for the end designed -

It is proposed to erect a suitable monument in the district where they fell, and weo doubt not that all closses of the com- munity will gladly assist in the work. The committee adduces a number of reasons why the public should support the pro- ject liberally, all of which will no doubt carry more or less weight. It points out that no application has been made to the public for subscriptions towards maintain- ing the families of the murdered men, as the state has undertaken to piovide for their support, that Sergeant KEN- NEDY and Constables SCANLAN and LONI- CAN died biavely in the discharge of a duty they were "specially directed by their superiors to carry out" that they were all three men of merit in the force; and that it is deäirable under existing circumstances to encourage the constabulary in the onerous and dan- gerous work it is called on to per- form, by its members some assur- ance " that their efforts in the public service will not be unfeelingly ignored." All these considerations will doubtless re- ceive the attention they merit, and we shall be disappointed if the subscriptions be not sufficient in amount to enable the committee to express practical sympathy with the living, as well as to do befitting honour to the dead. The relatives of those who fell in the discharge of public duty are proper legacies to the state. But the state is an abstraction and its liberility, although of coourse accept- able, does not carry with it that comfort which springs fiom assistance which is accompanied by an assurance of personal iregard. And really a very considerable feeling of personal regard should be felt towards the police, for people have come almost entnerly to rely upon them in all cases where perisonal danger is involved. The least the community cm do in return is to take care that it does not check their wilhngness to serve it by índifference to just claims.
