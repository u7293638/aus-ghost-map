! AH INTERESTING HALMOUR I FOR BOYS AND GIRLS READING OUR YOUNG FOLKS' LETTER} IT/'KMIinit. December's horo, and with her brought A world in whitest marble wrought; The trees and fence and nil the posts Stand motionless and white as ghosts, And all the paths we used to know Are hidden in the drifts of snow. December briugs the longest might And cheats the day of half its light. No bird-song breaks the perfect hush; No meadow-brook with liquid gush Buns telling tales in babbling rhyme Of liberty and summer time, But frozen in its icy cell Awaits the sun to break tho spell. Breathe once upon the window-glass And see the mimic mists that pass,-. Fantastic shapes that go and come Forever silvery aud dumb. December Santa Claus shall briug, Of happy children, happy king. Who with his sleigh and rein-deer stops At all gQod people's chimney-tops. Then let the holly red be hung, And sweetest carols all be sung, While we with joy remember them, The journeycrs to Bethlehem, Who followed trusting from .afar Tho guidance of that liappy star Which marked tho spot, where Christ was born Long years ago one Christmas morn! -St. Nicholas.
