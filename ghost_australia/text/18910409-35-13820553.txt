BENARES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir, Benares is the headquarters of hindoo Brahminism. To the pious Brahmin it is what Mecca is to the Mahomedan, and whatever distance he liv s from Benares he looks forward at least once in his life to make a pilgrimage there, bathe in the sacred waters of the Ganges, and wash away as many of his sins as possible before he dies, when his greatest wish is to have his bonus deposited in the Ganges I here is no other sacred city in the world that has such a continuous or ancient history as Bonuses, or that influences so many millions of people who bow down to the end of Brahminism and worship in this council sted idolatry Benares was a religious centre 2500 years ago, and has continued so to this day, The group of filth to be soon by a visit, r to Donaros is the bathing on its banks, and the day after our arrival here: festival day we went on board a dekee lost (which are used for the purpose and went up and down the river close to where the bathing was going on, in front of what are called the chats. I beso bathmir-frbats continue for three or four miles, and there are about 60 of them. At all these great stone stops are built from the top of the bank to the bottom, and they vary from 60 to 100 step each the bat lins platforms run out over the river from the steps or bank 30ft to 40ft, and each of than about 4ft. wide, they are supported by bamboo poles driven into the mud and tied to the platforms, and are fixed a few inches above the surface of the water The bathers bathe all along the sides and ends of the plant forces, on the stope, and wherever there is room for a wash or a dip Scores of thousands were bathing at one time, as far as the eye can see on the banks in both directions Some are prostrating themselves a certain number of times, others ladling up the water according to the rules laid down, others taking up with a copper scoop a certain quantity of water and pouring it out again - all under fixed rules- some looking fixedly before them and saying prayers, other smearing their forehead, with mud, and most of them looking miserable, as it is a cold morning and they begin at daylight, and it was then only 7 30, some of the platforms were occupied by vladrsasio pilgrims, other pilgrims from JoyDoro, Bengal, Poona, Wopal, Bombay, and many other places all over India, Some from nearly a thousand miles distance on purpose to bathe in the sacred Gnullo got rid of their old ears and commence again with a long sheet Very curiously the men, women, and children all bathe together indiscriminately, and while some are bathing there are others making genuine lions, and many in different attitudes of prayer and still more keeping very close to the bank for fear of getting out of their depth, and do all their relations bathing by stopping in shallow water. At the same time many of both sexes, have g taken off their clothes are hard at work washing: them and blistering their linen on the stones to got the dirt out, for not only must they was then seven in the river, but they must throw some of the water in their mouths a certain number of fines and then wash all their clothes, dry them, and put them on again, and when they have accomplished this they have to walk up under a big umbrella, and a priest will be there ready to properly brand the individual on the forehead, according to his caste, hear him say a proher or two, then bless him and, last but not least, pot Let the fee which must be according to the individual's three instances, but after seeing this priest, if he is a really pious person, he then walk up the steps, and 1 at the top are numerous temples where he can go and pray to any good he may think would be most likely to do him a kind turn-for instance Live, who appears to be a great favourite because room he and his wife do so much mischief, and they appear to be more frightened of Live than any other god. But they say Life has a thousand pounds, and, if no, I should think it must bodiflluilt to remember the right one for it seems that it is necessary not only to remember the right mine of the god for the thing: wanted to he done, or the supplicant, instead of getting what he wants, gets something he does not pray for, there may be a way of obviating those evils, but the matter is not very clear how to do it in viewing the bathers we came near a large number of women bathing Our guide said, " IhoBoaro Mahra ta women " I said, "How do you know them ? " He said, " By their costume.' the women wear the doors drawn over their shoulders same as men work at Benares, and they wear no veil The Mahratta men are known by having long hair on a report of the head.

The devotees, while bathing praying, and doing the required prostrations, and ladling up small quantities of water, both with a copper scoop made for the purpose and also a number of times with both hands, and again with a brass chain, do not take the slightest notice of those Jose around in some places very thickly lying about, and standing, Hitting, and washing; their clothes, and in washing them they do not in any coop, but take h and one and wet, swing them over their bonds, and whack (her in to a stone, and then wring them, and mirror set to work what king them till they are guilty ally clean I bia process is being on for miles up and down the never and among, the crowds that Uno the b nks, all are intent upon some form of religious genuineness. The surface of the water to covered with flowers in offerings to the CaitiroH, and the copper an I brass utensils they use, brightly polished, flash in the sun and show out very strongly against the dark stone steps I sons one end to the other of the ghosts there are umbrellas about li or 7 feet diameter placed upright on platforms, and under each There is a Brahmin priest equalling 1 ready to do his part towards the date of the de- votees, and in order to promote and gain a larger share of the business, many of them erect their sacerdotal umbrellas on platforms out alongside the bathers. But these are the most enterprising and pushing and probably looked upon with contempt by their more conservative brothers on the banks, the name as established medical men do not approve of an advertising doctor The priests on the bulk wait for their customers to come to them, and turn them out with a brand new coat of paint on the for oh ad, some a round red mark on the forehead, alive to three white stripes-, and in various ways a white round spot, the whole of forehead white, one down stroke of wife red spot and white stripe, and various other wuvBOf in taking-off mountain uoiiiolbiiiir. only known to the railhead There are about 50 of the principal share, besides others a smaller character, and there are several temples to every one of them, and as there are about 1500 Brahmin temples a together in Benares and suburbs, so there is no lack of nee mme dation for either pilgrims or others to go through their to militia exercises It seems to have been the miners for costumes for Hindoo Rajah of different butter to build either a couple, a that, a palace, or real-houses for pilgrims at Bouuros, 20 uctliniiB all of those for the use of his own p "opie when on a pilgrimage to the Holy City, so that the buildings are close together on the banks for miles for this purpose, and although their centre line or architectural fell upon (Xloriiullvaro am not a prepossessing character, connect the Hindoouirving In the interim s is very bountiful, except those goods, which they make tombly ugly The number of (soda two Hindoo rise (and I suppose required) is surprising, but none are good working crayon canna anatomies ly correct The most sacred Club in the Muuikarumku, as in this there is the sandwich dug by no less a personage than Viahnn Hero all pilgrims must have their first bathe The Maharaja of Gwalior built a large hat, with huge columns and we. idle and altogether an immense building, on the banks of the Churches, but he found mons were not deep enough, and the ah all of it has fallen into the river, but the people still bathe am in the broken pedestal. and iHrno masses of stonework in the water Another specially sacred I heads the l)a«asamedh, bocausoBrahma overhead TO horses here which gives the Ghat Its name Other hats have special qualities on pro- tects from smallpox, others drive away flomlB ore will turn evil spirits and a variety of other ills, and there must be a demand for these sort of presentatives by the people or they would not exist, There is a very curious branch of Hindoo relief in the gold shares, Mr S Cairo says of those per the -Star says the terror inspiring " He is God of the UBootics, and when clothed in the skin of an elephant leads the wild lantana dance His followers go naked, cover themselves with ashes, and twist their matted hair round their ho the, others follow secret rites and incan- tations, others pass themselves in immovable attitudes till the sinews shrink and the picture becomes rigid, others tear their bodies with knives or devour carrion and excrements Those wretched beings load wands r ing lives and swann st Benares and all other holy pi ices " I saw a number of these people about at Benares and other places, but from inquiries that I made they are gradually living out, and although there are plenty of mendicant professional beggars all fakirs team who put themselves- to and in im- movable attitudes till their posture becomes rigid are very few and growing? less and loss Among all the numerous Hindoo shrines along the bank, of the Benares there is one mosque which stands by itself among the 1500 Brahmin temples This mosque was built by the Emperor Arungiebo on the site of a One Hindoo temple be destroyed. It is of stone and has Two minaret towers," but the architectural features are poor and commonplace, as most of the buildings of the Moguls are It is strange, however, seeing that a large, Hindoo temple originally stood upon the site of this mosque, that when the Mogul dynasty came to 1111 end the Hindoos did not pull the mosque down and re-erect their temple as before at any report shows great tolerance of the Mobamodan by the Hindoo. Going up the river we passed the burning: Ghat where the dead branches of the Hindoos were buried There lay the dead body of a man covered with calico ready for burning, and two men were putting down the first pieces of wood in a pile to burn the body. In one place was a burning pile with a body in it, and a man attending to and supplying the pile with wood. We went up the river some distance, and returned again, past the burning Ghat, when the pile that I saw burn- ing coming up had consume. the body, and nothing but a handful of ashes remained, which was put into me Ganges, us all the ashes of the Hindoos burnt at Benares are at once put in the river. The pilot that we saw commencing was now completed, with the body in the middle of it- There are three roan around the piles Brahmin priest, a relation of the deoe««od,andt» man who was to attend the burning The relation took a bundle of brass made for the purpose, an i lighted one oud , then he waved the grass five times and lighted the funeral pile All this was going on close to the bathing; Ghats, and apparently no notice taken. The body of a, I emu be had been brought to tar burning between the time of our go ng and returning, and the large lay up in the ground closely on vor oil up in a winding sheet, ready for cremation Before burning the dead body is dipped in the danger I made inquiries how many were burnt a day here, and, was told the present, average was 2d per day, but that it vari is, as when cholera was about the rain was much higher The natives use and drink the Ganges water, thousands bathe and wash their clothes in it, and I iimealiiitel« after they take bottles full of the water with them to be drunk at home The water- carriers also are continually carrying water but a the same places, even from amongst the people while all this bulling and washing of dirty clothes are going; on lucy als drills, it while bathing, and even below the Ghat, where the bodies are burned and whom the ashes are thrown into the Ganges in fact, within reach They do me room to be aware that in drinking water our of a river so polluted they may be swallowing a portion of the fishes of this cemetery pin lives a portion of an old friend or relative not to say anything of contamination of the water by thousands bathing, and a 1 their duty was washed therein. I saw several women washing their red and blue roses, and the dye coming out, discolour- ing the water for yards round. It is true the Gauges is a large river, but this bathing, washing, and cremation go out for miles on its banks, and the Hindoos so reverence this water that they convey it hundreds at miles for their friends to drink. And when a Hindoo d as, if he lived a thousand, miles from the Ganges, it his Iriunda can stand it they will, after burning his body, send his ashes to be deposited in the Gauges, and although the poorer sort living at so great a distance from their sacred, river cannot afford to send so far not, as there are nearly 200 000 000 Hindoos in India, the Ganges must absorb the aroma na of many generations of the Brahminical 1 authoun-vvurshlpilng people On inquiring who it was t at lighted the funerAl pile when a person 18 cremated, I was informed that if a father or mother, it was too son who lighted the pipe, or in any case to is supposed to be the nearest relative, and if no relative comes forward and there is money to pay for the wood and attendance, a Brahmin priest fulfills the office, but whoever lights the Ure, whether relative or not, he is duQlod for 10 days, and must not touch anyone, when, after the expiration of the 15 days, of a relation or friend, then he has to pay all the expenses of cremation mill fees to the priest. I was told) that li a person dies and his friends were too poit to pay for emulation then the Kuj ,h of his district paid for it, but although this was the theory it was seldom carried out in practice, and the result is that if a person dies and his face is are too poor to pay for the firewood the body is only burnt a little at one or two places, and then thrown into the Ganges it is true the municipal authorities have man on the banks of the river to prevent this, but it is frequently dot 5, and more especially of" a distance from a town. W orkn are now being carried out to pump water from the Ganges at a clearer place up the river into a reservoir to supply the town of Henry B, which will be done by having water-tap in every street at intervals of 100 yards, which will be more convenient for the women to obtain than by carrying it up a long flight of steps and from a long distance, as they do now in getting it from the Ganges But the people are very apathetic and diseased the necessity for it here cannot understand the Engl as being so particular, and laugh at us, and think nothing of contaminating the water, and would as soon take the water in their duties from the Ganges close to where a large drain runs into it, as from an olhercloauor piece 1 shoW Several Large tanks that could only be fitted in the rainy season, and then only from the roots, back yards, and streets in densely populated neighbourhoods, and the winter WUK < entirely covered with a green slime, yet in all there was a continual stream of water carriers taking water for domestic use from them I do not feel surprised that cholera never was absent from those localities, but how it was possible for them to be free from disease We visited a considerable number of temples in flounces, but they all had that peculiarity in them of putting their gods in a dark place, like a dark cup- board with a curtain in front, although some of the gods were not allowed to be soon by unbelievers, and pruned notices were in most temples that no person VVUB allowed In unless with their shoes off, but here the Indian Government stops in and directs that Uuropoaus mud not take off their shoes, but must take off their hut, the same as going into a church. As we were not allowed to go into the Guidon locale, we were taken up a narrow stairs, on the opposite side of a narrow trot t, to see it out of the first floor windows and we saw the high in rumula! towers < covered with gold leaf, and we could really imagine there was a god in such dome Iwluw, but the front walls of towers were not more than 12 t. from the street W.ell, so them could not be much space for worshippers. But there were numerous temples all round among the shops, very close together, and an a muscular Brahmin priest showed us over several 1 offered him a rupee, which will modesty nrovmUd his taking readily, Buying unit priests did not take money; but us we were leaving he wanted more, and I said to him, you have one race of already. He replied "Yes, but there are -UO priests in this temple, and I have to divide it with them, and it is too small for that purpose." He was a prince who could speak English very well, and he used is for banksia ah purpoioa\ory colony is similar close quarters to the Golden our pas la the Cow temple, and this is so very sacred we were out) allowed in just one cornered it, which was fortunate, as tho they use as dirty au worst cow yards around Sydney. There appeared to be about a dozen sacred cows strolling around the temple n me of them wire tied up-and so far UB outing, drinking, and butter, they were comfortable, but looked delicate through eoiilinoRieiit under cover, but some of them were very old, for they remained until they died a natural de rub the atmosphere in the temple was strongly impregnated with the smell of the cattle yard which must have hindered the devotions of the worshippers only that the nose of the Hindoo is not affected by bud Huioiis of any kind, I cannot say that the Hindoo worship in the Cow temple, whether it in the god of co in which has the usual dark closet for himself in choosing of the temple, or whether they worship The cows direct, I did not see any one praying by either one or the other, but perhaps it was not their turn that day. Although the Hindoo bus a great many prevora to do he has invented a ready met sod of getting through them, for he has a prayer-bug made, like a stocking, with a fool, at the corner outside is embroidered in out- line of the god to be or led to, inside the < bug in a string of 108 beach, when he commences praying he takes the first bend and say what he has to KB), then he reports it 108 tunes, keeping count by the boards so that when he comes to the in-t bond he knows little has auld 11 1.1 smyers the Btipul itod number of times, when he carries in praying bug home, to be used as occasion requires. The Monkey Temple is on the contents of the city, and at present there are 100 monkeys thura scampering about in all directions. I gave some Eulalie (monkeys some sweet biscuit, Indian plum and grain, but the big ones resented this favouritism and would have jumped upon me only the priest k on them off with stake. In the temple grounds were some old tamarind trees said to be 1000 years old. they were hollow, and families of monkeys have been bred, born, and grown up in time for hundreds of years undisturbed. The trees wire full of monkey i Not long since there were bet ten 2000 and 3000 monkeys at this temple, and us 6 oz roamed about where they liked became a great nuisance The main roads authorities dare not kill them on the people would vote against such an insult to their religious n mobilities, so they ought nearly all of them and put them into a railway train and liberated them in a jungle a great many nil s from Benares to prevent their returning (about 2500 were so line and, said as it was in a jungle in a MuhoiiiuUun district, should they are here was the i crops of the cultivators of the district they would not llOMUto to kill Ihuiu wholesale I was told that at Muttra There in a monkey temple was about 2000 monkey a, and they are the terror of the neighbourhood, as the Temple in their home and the total about among the homes of the inhabitants of the district and there and carry off any thing they funny, and the natives being mostly Ennis will not interfere with, them Near Benares to the site of old b mind, the place where Budda began to preach upwards of 2000 years ago, There are I the ruins of an immense temple called!

Benares is justly celebrated for its brass and copper work, all kinds of vi soils are made in this material, and goods are coat here and engraved by the law, and if they were beautiful and works of art would meet with ready sale, all over the world, that they are conventional and ugly, and therefore only of use to 200,000,000 of the human race who appreciate such things But the dishes,, bowls, water vessels, i undlnstliUn, Temps, boxes, and numerous other domestic and scored utensils are very excellent, and the engraved brass and copper work it wocdU be very difficult to over!.
