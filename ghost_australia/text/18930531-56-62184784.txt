That £1000 Again Mr. Haynu, M.L.A., write* to the Evening Nev)$x— 'I propose to leave the inquiry Mto who paid the Premier's £1000 where the Go vernment have stopped it ; and the Minister's have themselves only to blame if the pnblio put unpleasant constructions on the whole basinets. The Colonial Treasurer is about the densest man in the 'Assembly, and is without a shred of an idea of a Minister as the servant of a people. Otherwise, apart altogether from the expediency of being perfectly open in a transaction of this kind, he would have Bean that the most minute detail of business in respect of receipt and out flow of money at the Tteasury is publio pro perty, and that the enquiry I made should have met with prompt and frank anBwer. The Treasurer, however, does not appear to have colleagues inuoh abler than himself. No greater blunder could have been committed by Minis ters than to mask this business as they have done. The payment now looks like conscience money, or toe act of oompounders. No more miserable baok down by a braggart, if we con sider the whole business was ever made than when Sir George Dibbs struok the item oat, for his bluiter in the early part of the session was immense. It was the ghost of theHoyle and Miller jobs which startled the Premier and his colleagues to avert certain defeat over their own little business. The whole business shows the Ministry up in a thoroughly bad light. In the first place they outrage the constitution ; in the second, while blatantly claiming they did no wrong, they allow a compounding of the amount at the Treasury ; and in the third, they settle the thing in socrot. Taken, in a political sense, by stealth, they allow a restoration of the sum by stealth. I have done my duty in foroing the Government before the publio in the ques tionable work, and there I leave them.'
