THE YOUNG FOLKS. A WATCH WORD FOR THE HEW YEAR. [By J. Edmund V. Cooke.] When yon find a certain lack In the stiffness of yonr back -At a threatened- fierce attack, Just the hour That you need your every power, Look a bit For a thought to baffle it. Just recall that every knave, Every coward, can be brave Till the time • _ That his courage should be prime-— Then 'tis fled. Keep your head! • What a folly 'tis to lose it Just the time you want to use it 2 When the ghost of some old shirk Comes to plague you, and to lurk In your study or your work, Here's a hit Like enough will settle it. Knowledge is a worthy prize; Knowledge comes to him who trie3— Whose endeavor Ceases never. Everybody would be wise As his neighbor, Were it nob they who labor For the trophy creep, oreep, oreep, While the others lag or sleep; And the sun comes up some day To behold one on his way Past the goal Which the soul Of another has desired, But whose motto was, "I'm tired." When-the task of keeping'guard Ofyourheart— Keeping weary watch and ward Of the part '• - • 1' '■Won are oailed upon to play Everyday— Is becoming dry and hard— 'Conscience'languidj virtue irksome, Good behavior growing worksome— Think this thought: ,t Doubtless everybody could, Doubtless everybody would,' Be superlatively good, Were it not That it's harder keeping straight Than it is to deviate; And to keep the way of right You must have the pluck to fight.
