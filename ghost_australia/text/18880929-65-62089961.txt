Protectionist Arguments. - WE have been so surfeited of late with lectures, letters, orations, and such like, on the merita or demerits, aa the case may be, of Free-trade and Protection, and have had experience of so much " coffee-grinding," that it is refreshing, in a way, to meet with a fresh idea, a novel metaphor, or a variety of any kind. Here is one, however, from a conntry paper :-" The fact is when people have picked np a political theory they are like children i with a new toy ; they can see nothing else except as reflected in its polished surface, and when people credit all the world's progress to Free-trade, they are about as reasonable as the old woman who felt sure she could explain the cause why the steeple was blown down-it was all owing to the new weathercock. We in New South Wales have hung on long enough to England's ooat taila-we are about old enough now to walk alone ; and because the old conntry, with limited space, carries out a policy which Buits her dense population, we Bhonld be unwise, with practically unlimited land and sparse population, to follow her footsteps. In large families of limited means boya are sometimes compelled to wear their father's coats, cut down to suit their frames. The other youngsters call them ' the old man's ghost.' It would be better for ns to wear Colonial tweed made to order than the cast- off political garments of the old land, besides having to stand the chaff of our better-dressed American and Victorian cousins, who at any rate have pocket money, while we have to go tick for our tarts and lollies."-Eclio.
