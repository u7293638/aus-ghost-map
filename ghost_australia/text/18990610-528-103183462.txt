'No, I seen him,' paid John trembling, as lie croMcd the t'hre&hold.; 'I seen him with niy own eyeu.' 'Man alive, you're white as a ghost,' ex claimed Kzekla'h, holding up the candle and dropping thu ki-cmi; along the Hoor, to acru tlnlae his midnight visitor.

'Gwod God !' exclaimed Ezoklwh, with a Ohuddor. 'Hut 'oiv did it Rot thoro ?' 'Don't know,' Bald old John, shaking hla Jiend dubiously. 'The devil's In It oome whereH. U'a devil's work.'

Tho old moro was pirt into tho e/hMts without delay, and they started off dovm Vie river in tho direction at Joe Sawklns' farm.

'Mornln', Mr.' Simpson,' said Joo, ex amlitfng tho situation out of the corners of his eyes. ;, 'Good mornln', Joe,' said Mr. Qorjnlcy, with cxlremo friendliness. They had not spoken ror six months pre viously. 'Good mornln', Mr. Gormley,' nald Joe, with equal cordiality. 'Comln' to look at «omo o' them young pigs I got for aale ?' asked Joe, casually. 'They're nittllnc fine pigs.' 'Well, ahem, no, not exackerly,' said Mr. Simpson, 'Wo'vo come on a bit o' business, Jos; a bit o' rathor Important business.' 'Oh !'? said Joo, leaning gracefully across tho fence, aud chowlng a straw. 'Yes,' said Ezeklah, carefully, 'and any thlnk we eay may bo taken -io\va in evi doncc agin us.'. 'Ah .'''replied Joe, 'How's that ?' . . 'Woll, between. you and me and the post, Joo,' snld Mr. Simpnon, dn7i-pinK his yoico to an electric whisper, charged' with' mas- tery, 'There's been a murder committed !' 'No, Ezy,' ejaculated John, In approhen slvo tones; 'don't say that; we don't know that !' - 'Anyhow, there's gi^vo suspicions,' as sorted Kzcklah. 'Good Lord !' ojaculated Joe. 'You don't say that. Where 1' 'Wo don't know where,' explained Eze klah; 'but it must a' boon somowhorca about 'ere.' 'Who found tho body ?' «uerled . Joe. 'What is It, a man or a woman ?' 'What in it, John ?' enquired Ezy, turn ing to that sMUloman, 'f man or a wo man 7 I never thought 0' that.' 'It's neither,' replied John, moistening his lips with -hia tongue, thoy wore so par ched and dry — 'It's a. skeleton !' 'A nkoleton ?' cried Joo 'Yes !' 'Who found it ?' 'John Gormloy here. Ho found It. It was In hlrt -bed.' 'In his what ?' choked Joo, whoso faco was tho color of boiled beet — froin oxolte mont, presumably. 'Why in hla bed,' said Simpson. 'Not all of It, lOzy,' corrected John, 'Some of it wan In the oven.' 'Oh, that bo Mowed for a yarn,' cried Joe. 'You two old fossils In tryln' to take a lift cut o' me.' 'Joo Sawklnn,' exclaimed old John, ear nestly, 'It's a!i truo a;i Rod !' 'Whon did you ilnd it ??' demanded Joo, lauRhlnK outrlRht; 'You're having a lark with me.' 'Joo Sjlwklnn,' i.'ald Mr. Slrapnon, oovero ly, 'this 'ero ain't no lark, nor no laugliin'. mattor, either.' 'What did you do with It ?' dananded .Too, affecting to compose himself aud'bo llovn. ' 'Loft It there,' said old John, tor.iely. , '.Left it there,' corroborated Slmpnon^ 'LeTt It and run.' ? 1 'I didn't exactly run, Kxy,' isald John, 'I sort of conio away quick.' ! 'All rlL'ht, John. That'11 all rlRht. No -boi\y blamoii you If you did run. Any ma^' vrould run undor them clroumiitanceH.' j 'Whon I rumo down tho mountain last; night,' mild tho old m-an to Joo, beginning tho story, and telling1 It over agYiln with little forgotten details and bits of local color Added. 'Hy gosh !' cried Joo, whon ho 'had. llnlohwl, 'That's tho awfulciit thing I ©vcii herard tell on. An' what arc you goIu' to do now ?' 'Wo thought of Rottln/; you to eomo up to tho houno with us,' explained ESzokiah, 'an a kind o' wltncBS, an' wo thought of aaklnt Bill l^lommlng to eomo along.' . \ 'Bill will eomo,' anse-rtod Joo. 'Ho ain't a' bad s6rt,' la Bill; I'll rldo down right away, for him.' ? '. So Joo rodo down after 1)111, and loft tho two old follows dlfiotiHEilnR Uio matter wltU vory serious faceu until thoy roturnod. lllll and Joo deemed excited arid Interea '?? tea, and they rodo behind tho spring cart all the way to normloy'n. ^Vlth trembling 'flngern John, lifted tho latch, and tho party 'of Inquiry' eiiicred tho Ultohon togcither. .Tohn looked oasorly around tho floor, Thcro wan nothing thoro. Tlo looked at tho oton. 1 Tho door wan open, and a glanco iihowcd till handB that there wau nothlnk thoro «l»o — nothdiR oxccptlng a tin plato of meat, and n good-el'dod plopo of damper. Joo looked vit Dill, nnd Bill looked at ?Toe. 'Thoro'/i nollilriK lioro,' /raid llxo latter, with ft ntninno twltchlUK about tho cornern ot hid mouth.

''Phitra'n riothinp; hero, John,' ho nald, with an air of Beverlty, not unmixed with »adnoss and pity. John gazed from ono to another, stared round 'tho walla, peered under tho dresser, and In a pathetic volco finally exclaimed: 'Thcro'a nothing hero.' Joo Sawkins, in e, sort of atago aalde, put hlo linger alcniacantly to his forehead. Bill Fiemmlng shook hla head gravely In reply. Somo of thjs pantomime was observed by John, and ugoln ho turned a alckiy 'gray. Doubts, terrors, and, at tho Bamo time, strong -Kmvictlona, nwayed, pendulum fashion, In Jiis exalted soul. 'Coano into tho other room and let's look at tho bed,' ho cried, hoarsely. They trooped after him Into the other .room — Bill and Joo last. Tho clothoa wero arranged on tho bed as if they had not boon disturbed lor at least two days. With trenibllug ilngors old John drow back the blankets. The bud was empty ! John ga;tpcd, shook visibly, and aat down, with his head botween his hands. 'l'oor old covo,' uald Joo, in an audible whisper. 'Ought to aee a doctor at once,' mur mured Bill. 'John,' said Mr. Simpson, In a kindly, sorrowful voice, 'You must a' been drinking heavy In Cauidon yesterday.' 'I swear to God, E seek lab,' groaned th'» victim, 'that 1 nover had moro nor threo at tho very outfilde.' 'Well, then.' r.aid Ezeklah to Joo Saw kins, 'the very best thing to bo dono Is for us to take him up to tho hospital at onct.' 'Wluit for, Ezoklah ? What for?' de manded the victim, with anguish. 'BocauKo you'vo got a fever, or eomc thlng,' ropliod Ezeklah, ''an' If you don't take tho thing in timo it '111 most likely do for ye altogether.' But when Ezy nald 'hospital' ho bad winked Badly at Joo and Bill. And Bill had turned to Joo and whispered audibly, 'Aaylum'o the placo for him, all ripht,' 'I ain't goin' to go to no asylum,' cried old John, starling up. 'I ain't no moro mad than any one of ye.' 'They all say that,' whlspored Joo to Bill. 'lOvery blanky one of em sez it,' agreed Bill, In another stngo whisper. 'Look a here,' cried tho old man, 'I did aee that.' j 'What ?' asked Joo. 'What did you seo, Mr. Gormley ?' asked Bill, more in sorrow than In anger. 'What I cm Id I saw,' shouted John, an-' grlly. 'I'd Uiko my dyln' oath ou It aforo a regiment of Juries.' 'Thai's all right,' agreed Joo, 'Don't got yourself excited, Mr. Gormley, It ain't good for you.' John looked wildly from ono to another. He saw how norry _they all wero for 'him— especially Bill and'Joe. And a groat tloubt wedded to fear took hold ot him. '?PorhapB,' ho faltered, 'I'd better go up to Camden and seo tho doctor.' 'That's right, Mr. Gormley,' said Joo; 'That's tho most oonatblo thing to do. Doctor '11 glvo you somo medicine that'll fix you right up in no tlmo.' 'Yes,' concurred Bill, aweotly, 'An' after you'vo Uikon a fow good doaoa you won't be aeeln' any nioro shlnbones In tho ovo- «-r. Kkulls in your bed.' 'The skull was in tho ovon,' corrected John, 'and the ahinbonoa was In tho bed.' 'Chut! Chut ! ' .observed Bill, pitying ly. 'Didn't he tell us first that it was tho ohlnbonoa in tho wen, and Uio akull in tho bod.' ? ? 'Ho did,' replied Joo, forvenlly. 'I'd take my oath ho did.' 'What did I nay, Bzy,' demanded John, turning to hifi friand. 'I'm bloWed if I know, John,' replied Bzy, scratching his head. 'It's tho queerest bit o' business from fn»t to last an over I wan mlxod up lu.' 'But what did I say ?' demanded tho noarly demented Gormloy. 'Well, I hollove you b-aid tho ahiubonea wan In the oven, John. I'm noarly ouro you did — and that tho ekull was In tho bod.' 'Kzoklah,' said John, in a .' low, awed voice, 'I'll go to Cnmdon and sou the doc- '' tor. I bollevc I ain't well.' Joo nodded his hend to old Simpson. 'Keep him at that,' ho whlspored; 'It's tho best thing for him,' 'Host thing in tho world,' concurred Bill. 'Ilo'll bo all rlyht In a week, Bill,' oald Joo. ? . , . 1 . 'Touch of tho horrors, Joo,' said Bill. Thoy woro to sympathetic, uo affected — U. was qulto touching. 'Ill drive yu un to Camden now, John,' voluntcored old Simpson. 'I'll tako tho old maro land give her a feed while you'ro cot tlnc ready,'' John prcnacd his friend's hand. 'I'm nil broko up, Bzy,' ho wild. 'I bo Ilcvo I must a' been shanghaied, or somo thlnK.' 'That's likely,' /mid Bill to Joe. 'It's dead likely,' said Joe. 'I got a dose onct meself up In the Bogan, an' lt.mado mo queer in tho head tor a month. An' olo dovll of an ole woman gavo It to mo in a puMlc-'oiuio, Wanted mo chequo. She 'ad a wicked oyo, that 0J0 -woman, I believe «hc'd a thoiiRlit nothlnk o' poluonln' a covo right out.' 'That tho tlmo you wnn away shearing, Joo ?' 'Ayo. That tlrr)o. . You remember. Wasn't I a bit funny when I eomo back ?'
