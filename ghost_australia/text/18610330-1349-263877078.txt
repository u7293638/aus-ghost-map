OUR ANNUAL RAGES. To the- Editor of the Yais Courier. Siti,— I hope you will not consider me im pertinent when I enquire of you— " How are our races getting on ; and if there is any prospect of /the money leing collected?'" xou are well aware that unless the stewards exert themselves there is little chance of any one coming forward with the £ s. d. I. troubled you, a short time since, with a brief'disputation on the terms under which 8 inie of tlie prizes are t > be run, and alluded to tlie al'Surdity of excluding two and three year olds that have won advertised prizes from two-year-old and Ieger stakes. Your ptcwards have taken no notice of this also ; -mid I ain very much mistaken if they care pne fig whether the races come off or nbt, iiur- uhcitlief thc- spirit of- racing. -pervades , plhe meet;" It is' all very well to have the r«me of gentlemen as, stewards who stand ltjgh iii the social seale, and nothing gives ine greater pleasure than to see such take San interest iu these affairs ; but it clearly Veaolves itsplf into a fares when 'tli»y- will not put their shoulders to the wheel, and not only that, but allow themselves to he lid away by persons who know literally nothing, about horse-racing. However, let the prizes be w"at they may, it is very clear there can be no races unless there l e monev ; and as the time is fyst approaching fir holding the meeting, and as stewards are severally responsible for the payment of the prizes, their indifference is absolutely suicidal. Trusting that apathy may no longer be shown, and that the stakes for the young 'uns may be made conformable to all racing rules, I am, Sir, yours, &c.;, THE GIIOhT OF JORROCKS. Yass, 28th March, 18Q1.
