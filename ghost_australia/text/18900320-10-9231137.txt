QUARTZ MINING, This industry has temporarily Boer armies suspended, with the exception of the Madam Howard, under the able management of Mr. Peter Irvine, who has, since taking charge, began work in a permanent manner. The sinking of an underlay shaft to the depth of 100ft. on the reef has been let to Mr. Lorraine, and fair progress is being made. Should the reef live down to this depth, as indications favour, the work will then be pushed ahead, The Macquarie Co's battery as been purchased, and will be re-erected on the Madam Howard's ground so soon as the Government have completed the read, which work was supposed to be taken in nds months since, but as yet no movement towards the end seems even to be contemplated. As this is a track that is admitted to be one of the most needed in the district, it seems passing strange that so long a delay is thought necessary by those in power, but then it is assumed that when all the fine weather is over the road will be commenced as is usual under all disadvantages. The Princess Co., I understand, are taking out a crushing from another part of their roof, and if it prove favourable there is still a hope of future prosperity for this company. The scarcity of water prevents a crushing taking place of about a hundred tons of stone, they have to grass already, but there are only two men working besides the manager. The old King River claim has at last given up the ghost, the enormous amount of money expended by this company in the endeavours to obtain a payable lode has met with undeserved failure, and is regretted by all. During the time this company have been working vast sums of money have been paid for labour, and the class of the community who benefit so much by this expenditure will miss the payment regularly made by the company. It was thought a shaft would be sunk to a depth of 100ft. or 150ft., but this to all intents and purposes has been abandoned, and the works hung up. ____________
