WHAT FOR NO?* "An imitation of the bagpipes (and this on an organ which has cost little under £7000.")—Argus Critic. "Music of the mighty masters on their vulgar souls was lost, For a bagpipes-imitation was the thing that charmed them most! Heedless, while they heard unshrinking bursts of such barbaric sounds, That the desecrated organ cost about seven thousand pounds!" Thus the critic. Well, for my part, from the "classic" style I flee, I've a down on obligatos, symphonies, and fugues in E; Pianists have come from far, and bored me with their rattle-thump; HORSLEY wrestled with the organ, and I didn't care a dump; Cold I've sat while "variations" made the roof above me ring, But the music of the bagpipes is a very different thing. While their wail is like a Banshee's o'er the last of some great Line, How the Ghostly gather to it!—How their rusted weapons shine! From the heights of haunted Flodden, from Culloden's ghost-walked moor, From the Belgian field of battle, from the Black Sea's frozen shore, From the shattered Gate of Delhi, come those noble spectre- throngs, With no happier mien the Blessed march through heaven to angel- songs, With reluctance to their measure danced erewhile the Russian Bear; NENA SAHIB doubtless shuddered, listening in his gory lair; Overmatched, the Allies heard them, and rejoicings rent the sky; Sore beset, the Indian cities prayed to hear the slogan's cry. Here is one who scorns the bagpipes! Let us hear what he admires. Will the rising tears salute it—tears that flash in glory's fires?— No! When this and that "Composer" sinks in Fashion's maelström whirl, Critic, o'er Oblivion's Chaos, you shall hear the Bagpipes' skirl!
