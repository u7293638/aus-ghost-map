POETRY. THE PURPLE EAST. I. You in high places; you that drive the steeds Of Empire ; you that say unto our hosts, ' Go thither,' and they go ; and from our coasts Bid sail the squadrons, and they sail, their deeds Shaking the world : lo ! from a land that pleads For mercy where no mercy is, the ghosts Look in upon you faltering at your posts— Upbraid you parleying while a People bleeds To death. What stays the thunder in your hand ? A fear for England ? Can her pillared fame Only on faith forsworn securely stand, On faith forsworn that murders babes and men ? Are such the terms of Glory's tenure ? Then Fall her accursed greatness, in God's name ! II. Heaped in their ghastly graves they lie, the breeze Sickening o'er fields where others vainly wait For burial : and the butchers keep high state In silken palaces of perfumed cage. The panther of the desert, matched with these, Is pitiful ; beside their lost and hate, Fire and the plague-wind are compassionate, And soft the deadliest fangs of ravening seas. How long shall they be borne ? Is not the cup Of crime yet full ? Doth devildom still lack Some consummating crown, that we hold back The scourge, and in Christ's borders give them room ? How long shall it be borne, O England ? Up, Tempest of God, and sweep them to their doom ! —William Watson.
