THE OPEN COLUMN. TO THB EDFTOB. Sir.â€” I saw a letter in the Times, of Oct. 16, by the Ghoit, stating that he had been on the look oat for news, and bearing that Mr. M. W. Green was going to speak in the Institute, he went in unobserved and took a ?eat on the wire over the platform. Now, Sir, I think that he would have to make himself very small so as not to be seen, and very light also, or else the wire (which is not drawn very tight) would have bent down and broken with him. I do not believe this Ghost is anything more than a hmman being just waiting to try and frighten superstitious persona who believe in Ghosts. la he clever enough to put the name of the writer of this letter in the paper next week ? If so there might be some truth in what he says. He ?ays he was grieved to see so many go to the ?how grounds without paying. I wonder if he paid himself. I dont think he did be cause he did not make himself visible. He says again that he warns those young fallows against throwing stones at him (I would not blame them if they did), bat he says they would all glide off. 1 wonder if shot would glide off also. I should like to have a chauce to try. I am, Sir, &c.;, One Who Does Not Beuevx In Ghosts.
