S SELECT POETRY. " HEAIRT'S-EASE. There is'a flower I sought for years, H?eart's-ease and rest from careo, For my heart was crushed by pain and tears, . And the world was lone and bare. Far from the maddening crowd I went, , I sought the flower alone, But still my heart with woe was bent, And still my soul made moan. I sought the fight, I longed to die, I charged mid shot and shell, Death like a white mist passed me by, Where others dying fell. I sailed upon the lonely sea, I trod a foreign shore, But the ghost of sorrow followed me For ever, ever more. One day I met a little child, Sweet as a bud of May, She bore a wreath of flowerets wild, I followed in her war. She came unto a dim green place, SKnelt by a grave in prayer, Then passed, with tears upon her face, And left the flowerets there. O, not in vain! O, not in vain ! My quest by sea and shore. Rest, rest, thou troubled ghost of pain, Vex thou my soul no more ! I knelt upon the blessed sod, I wept an earnest prayer, I found the flower, the peace of God, Heart's-ease and rest from care.
