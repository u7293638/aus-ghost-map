The falling off in bDwling is specially notice able. ? A few seasons back we could put a Victorian eleven into the. field that could hold its own against a .strong. English ' team. Who can forget biir. splendid victory in 1882 over the Hon. Ivo Bligh's team, undoubtedly one -of the finest teams that ever visited Australia ? In every department of the game we were better then than we are now. Our present dearth of good bowling is truly, lamentable. Indeed, in the past 20 years I do riot remember a time when we were as badly off as now in this important depart ment.' If we were to meet a first-class English team, we would not stand the ghost of a show. They would get as many runs as they liked against us on a fast wicket; and they would get our batsmen out for very few. I say in all seriousness, that if you look round Victoria .arid try to pick out men who would be worth choosing . ip 'a first-class Australian Eleven, you could riot name more ? than three or four players who would be considered class enough as ' batsman, and I do not think iyou- could name one1 man who ; would ??'
