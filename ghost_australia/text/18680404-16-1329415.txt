I still make use of the sod occasion to recall to you my most earnest exhortation, to set your faces like that against any habits, or societies, or modes of spr Loch which may excite and maintain unfriendly class or factions We have many blessings litre, we have too the afflictions which the good Providence of God permits, but let us not wantonly and wickedly import miseries and enmities Australians we should all be We owe it to each other we owe it to duty, we owe it to Christianity And I say, Australia for the Australians, our solo and sufficient nationality under ' rule of our ever good and gracious Queen, whom, with Her Boy an family, may God in His infinite mercy long preserve to us " And now, dearly beloved invite you all, as many as can be present, to the Cathedral on Sunday evening next You have already, during the Holy Sacrifice whilst I was absent and in ignorance of our calamity, offered prayers for the Prince's speedy restoration to health and strength, and I thank you for the generous eagerness and faith of your prayers On Sunday evening we shall sing the Te Drum in humble, exultant thanksgiving, that it has pleased God to protect and restore the royal guest, whom it is no less our sincere delight than our duty to honor Come all that can-I wish the Cathedral were large enough to hold all, that do, 1 well know, as their Holy Church teaches them, fear God and honor the Queen " One word only more the defilement of blood, if not blood-guiltiness, is amongst us, and it was surely a happy thought of some one, I know not of whom, that a new hospital, the evidence and fruit of our grateful joy, would be an appropriate expiation. It was a good, and a Catholic thought, and I trust that all the Catholics of the land will promptly bring their help to confirm it " May God inspire and bless you " + JohN Bede, Archbishop of Sydney.
