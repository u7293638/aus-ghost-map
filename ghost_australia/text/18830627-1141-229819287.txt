Bettiog-fiCaricet. " What aSereuce from last year" is the usual remark of tbe owners, trainers, and backers, auent the Bracelet race at Caulfield. At this time last year it would have been a very easy matter to back a horse for this race. to win five thousands, but to-day, when the commissioner" asked for a price abont two hones, to win a couple of thousands each, scarcely an offer was made, aud thoBe which were made were at an unreason able price, considering the number aud qualify of tbe field.

Various reasons have been advanced for this, and the one most generally accepted is that the numerous bogu- totalizator clubs now in existence, while breeding and fostering the spirit of betting iu the rising geueration, materially injure, not only the ring, but the owners of horses. By means of specious advertisements, the foolish and inexperienced arc induced to invest their money in these so- culled clubs, and the clever people follow iu the expectaiiou of Utteuiug ou their lolly, A few horses have beeu backed for small sums iu tbe Ladies' Trophy, Verdure, Ghost, Transferred, and Josephine appearing most fancied at the prices already mentioned, but it would take but liulc money to place anything right ubead of all these.
