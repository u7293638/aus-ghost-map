A GHOST STORY. Wo don't havo many ghost stories in our neighbourhood but wo havo ono in Turadalo. An elderly man who fulfills Hovcrul functions, one of the principal being that of gravodiggcr in ordinary has seen tho unearthly visitant. A short time ago he had two graves to d jg, and iu the afternoon had also to boil tlio kettles for a tea-fight. In order to accomplish both tasks, lm rose shortly iMkui miu wiiumiig iiuui oi mgiiL, anu roaclicd the couiotory by 3 a.m., and commonccd liis work. Ho had mado soiuo progress, ami was nearly nock deep in tlio " narrow home," when lie raised himself for a stretch. To his intense horror ho saw something which lie maintains was a ghost. Ho scrambled out of the grave ami made tracks for tho gate, and so overpowering was bis fear that ho folfc as if tho few yards era ho got on tho road wore ten miles. Ho has been young and now is old,' hut he thinks ho never covered tho ground so rapidly ns he did until ho reached a human habitation. Hero ho felt com paratively safe, and sab down meditating until daylight, ho shares tho popular bolicf, that ghosts must rofuru to their shades' ore day-dawn and then resumed his work. Byc-and-byo his wife cam willi Ids breakfast. To her ho tohl liis " terrible adventure. He described the visitation as " large and brown," hub could givo no further particulars. Rumour is a lying jade, no doubt, but still rumour 1ms it tliat this eldorly ghost-seer is not over kind to his belter half, and so the nature of tho consolation she tendered may bo understood. " I tcll'd tlioo so," she said, " it's Iho devil at thy elbow, it is, and he'll have thee, somo day. The evil conscience is tor menting llico." " I knew thne'd say that," responded the gravediggor. lie has repeated tho story to mora sym pathising ears lately, and find full cre dence with dip majority of his hearers, who absolutely rofuso to go near the comotory after dark. IToro is a fine chance for tho Spiritists. â€” ' astlemaine Representative.
