TRAINING NOTES. Bt Little Terror. Much of the'interest which up till Thursday last was taken in the forthcoming Geraidton race meeting has since been discounted by the fact that Messrs. Smith & Co. have failed to accept for anything. Wandering Willie, Hart- lands, Satyr, Aim, Music and Will-o'-the-Wisp am uui to ma&e; ineir appearance, x ue reason given for this is that Messrs. Smith & Co. are disgusted with the weights, which must be the purest bunkum, as had their string come to Geraidton they must almost inevitably have scooped the pool. However, they are not com- ing, and there is nothing for it bnt to accept the situation. Both enps would now appear to be Burgoyne's, unless St. Ives, who at the pre sent moment is known to be in anything but racing condition, can be put right in a few days,' which is more than doubtful. He looks very fit for a show, but for racing, even apart from being beefy, his game leg puts him out of it. If he has a ghost of a show for either of the cups I am no judge of horseflesh, and I shall be surprised if he runs at all on the second dav even if he does on Wednesday. Burgoyne Is small but looks a real clinker what there is of him, and must triumph on both days. Somnolence looks very fit, and may have a show, at any rate, she may be counted on for second money on both dsys. For the Bracelet, although only two have accepted, I anticipate a good race bet wen Woorabba and Mr. Darlot's pretty little mare. Long legs will, I am afraid, have to take second place, though he be close up. Lottery is too beefy-as- usual, and will, if I mistake not, be beaten' both by Irwin and Jiloong wherever they meet, , and the only race which Warlock with his" greasy heels might have appropriated, he does not liappen to appear in, and that is the Bracelet.
