PRIANTOM-PROTOGRAPIS. A photographer, taking a photograph with a particular lens, detected in it not only the usual portrait of the sitter, but at a little distance a copy, a phantom, ghost, or double of it - producing what was certainly a startling effect, and one not likely to be very pleasant to the sitter, especially if of a superatitloui turn of mind. Fortunately science came in, and left no room for the creations of marvel-mongers. At a meeting of the Photographical Society, it was shown that these phantoms (if we may so call them) present two different varieties, and spring from two different causes:- lst. A photo. graphic image is sometimes so very deeply impressed in the glass of the negative of the action of light, that the subsequent cleaning of the glass plate, even with strong acids, will not completely remove, the picture. When such a plate is used for receiving another picture, the original image faintly makes its re-appearance. In this case the phantom is not the "double" or " fetch" of the sitter in the second picture; it is a very faint photograph of one person on the same plate which contains a fully developed photograph of some other person; and the juxta-position may, perchance or designedly, produce startling Pepper-like ghost effects. 2\. When a lens has inequalities in its substance, due to an imperfect process of an nealing, or when it is subjected to an un equal pressure in different parts, it acquires the property called double relfraction-two images of the same object being produced by it at the same instant. 'This explains the production of the double or fetch phantom. \- " Chambers' Journal."
