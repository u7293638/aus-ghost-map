A BIC EEL. IForsome months past(writes a Wannou correspondent of the Spectator) a mam moth eel has been sporting bis slippery dimensions in a water hole on Boehara estate, and though local anglers made several attempts to secure his eelship bv the conventional method, the fish resented the hook with an indignant slash of. its tail and disappeared as mysteriously ss Banquo's ghost. An employe named Arthur Poole, however, adoped the novel method of bringing a breechloader into requisition, and with a well-aimed shot got home on the eel's forehead. The fish gave a terrific bound out of its native element, and after performing several original gyniDastic evolutions, tore round the dam with lightning rapidity, leav ing a clearly defined red streak after it. Beconiiog alarmed lest the animal might make a land attack, Mr. Poole again fired, and the eel, uttering a pathetic shriek, disappeared. Next day the life less body of the fish lay floating on the water,' and though both shots had taken effect it is believed by many that the eel died from shock to the system. The fish measured 4 feet in length and 12 inches in girth and weighed 13 pounds. It is to be regretted that this excellent specimen of eel met with such a tragic death. Captured alive it would would have been a splendid ichthyologieal exhibit for the forthcoming; exhibition in Paris. On the waterhole being cleaned out there was no trace of any antecedents, contemporaries or posterity. The eel was evidently playing a lone haud, or it might be more accurate to say a lone fin.
