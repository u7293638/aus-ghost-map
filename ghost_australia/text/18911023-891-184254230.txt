Ghosts on the Track. " Talking about ghost? on railroad traoks," said the engineer, as he mapped hie hrow with a piece of dry waste, " I believe in them." " Why so ?" ' " Well, I hilled a man once—that la, my engine hilled him—and I can't get rid of him. " Hannts yon, does he ?" " Not exactly. Bat I can't get him ont of my memory. It happened on the OldBruns wioh and Western Railroad. I had taken a young man—a tramp—on the engine with me. He was a northern man who had been south for his health, and had got broke in Florida. He was going home to die, he said, and asked me to give him a lift. I was sorry for him, and granted his request with pleasure. " The fellow had consumption, and the jolt ing of the engine resulted in a hemorrhage. I wasn't noticing the man, when I heard a shriek, and then—out of the oab' he tumbled, and then under the engine 1 I heard the wheels pass over him and grind his bones to powder! " After that, whenever we wonid reach that spot, I seemed to hear a shriek, and then the grinding of the wheels on hnman bones. I oonldn't dispel the illnsion to save my life. On one occasion the fireman Bwore that he saw the man picking up his bones along the track; bat, of course, there was nothing in that. Bnt for six years afterwards, as long ae I remained on the road, I imagined I conld hear the shriek, and feel the engine jump when we got to that place. I suppose it was all imagination, bnt I oonldn't help it all the 1—Atalanta Constitution.
