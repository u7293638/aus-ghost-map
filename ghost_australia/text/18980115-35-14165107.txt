He had, however, dealt with matters relating to engineering, and he had had a great deal to do with the George street tramway Regarding the fiscal question he contended that the Premier was, by reason of his policy, closing up all the avenues di local industry is" Shanio ") Mr Hold told them that a freetrade policy would put industries upon a sound footing, but there was no chance of a Freetrade policy doing anything to assist factories The Premier said that he had taken off taxes from the working class and put them on the wealthier 1 istes (Applause ) But was this so ' Mr Bold certainly planted the taxes on the wealthier classes, but those gentlemen passed them on to the working people (Hear, hear ) Artiions well know that of late years wages had gone down from 2s 6d to 10s per week (Voices " More than that") Take the loss in wages at is per week each artisan It aggregated about £3,000,01)0 per annum It was in this way that the rich men paid their taxes He had talked with a good many labour members in the House, and had found that they were at heart as good protectionists as he was himself Yet immediately the division bell rang these members were found voting for Mr Reid and his freetrade policy The Premier had claimed credit for economy in the Civil Service , but men had been turned out at a moment's notice either to beg or to work the streets (A voice ' Why should the State support them A"') a ell, be thought that some time ought to have been given them to find other employment He contended Uni t the Civil Service to day was in a state of unrest There was a clamour at the present time for everything to be done by the Government by day labour, but he contended that work could not be done so efficiently and cheaply in that manner as by contract With respect to the reform of the Upper House the Premier was simply abusing the members of that Chamber If the Council had to be re- formed, why not meet and discuss the matter in a legitimate and proper manner? There were able men in the Council who would be willing to discuss the question in a reasonable way If it was necessary to reform the Council it was doubly necessary to reform the As'erablj Why, for instance, should not legislate all hours of the night and until the early hours of the morning If they had not a " safety valve " in the Upper House the bills passed into law would be even of a more slipshod character than at present. He moved,- That, in the opinion of this meeting, the policy of the present Government u injurious to the best interests of the people, and should be allowed at the earliest possible opportunity " (Cheers.) Mr Copeland seconded the motion He said that the poverty throughout the colony was a scandal and disgrace to the Government, If workmen could not got work they could not get wages, and they had nothing to live upon The freetrade policy meant discharging workmen in the colony, and employing foreigners in other countries in their place Our work was now being done in Germany or Belgium Foreigners were receiving wages for work which ought to be done in New South Wales Mr Reid said that he had taken £900,000 off the taxpayers of the colony but he had really distributed this money to the employers in other countries The fact was, if the freetrade policy was to force much longer there would not be an expert artisan left in the country. The old ghost of Legislative Council reform ought not to be allowed to be galvanised into life again at the next election. Seek out the freetraders, and fight them to the death but do not let them adopt a dog eat dog policy by bringing out protectionists to lUlit protectionists Let them Back to their old member (Cheers ) Mr. Lyne said that Mr Nelson was a good protectionist, and could be thoroughly depended on to vote straight He commented upon the Civil Service Super annuation 1 mid, and contended that the action of the Government in relation to the matter was re- pudiation of the most diabolical character Large German steamers were bringing goods made by prison labour into New South Wales, and the wages of our artisans were thus being cut down Mr Reid had received the gold medal of the Cobden Club, and he would seek the interests of that club rather than those of the people of this colony; Let them, therefore, support the protectionists Mr John Norton also spoke The resolution was carried with cheers, and the proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to-the chairman for presiding
