SELECTED POETRY. LAND AT LAST. Day after day, upon my coach I lie ': Lonely and sad, by phantoms vague oppressed; Ghosts of the Past, whom truant Memory : IRecalls to life to rack my tortured breast With vivid retrospect of fancies bright, High hopes, and strong afrectious in whose ray Life, love, ambition, glowed with roseato light, Sooming to herald forth a "perfecot day." Light faded--hopes extinguished-fancies fled Feolings repressed till hardened into stone The one beloved estranged, and worso than dead Helpless, forsaken, humbled, and alone One beam still lingers in the western shy; Love only dies with life: Life-is Eternity.
