POETRY- ALONE WITH YOUR CONSCIENCE. I Â«at nlono with my conacionco, In n place whoro timo had eoaBoil ; ' And wo talked ot my formor living, In tha land whoro tho yoato increased, And I fait I should havo to answar Tho questions put to mo, And to faco tho questions and nnBwev - Through an otcrnity. Tho ghost of forgotton actions Camo floating boforo my sight, _ ; And things that I thought wore (load things Woro alivo with a tbrriblo might ; And tho vision of all my past lifo Was an awful thing to tasto, Alono with my conBcianco sitting, In that solomnly silant placo. And I thought of a far-away warning Of a sorrow that was to bo mine, In aland that tlion wns tho futuro, But now is tho presont timo ; And I thought of my. formor thinking, Of tho judgmont day to bo, liut Bitting alono with my conscionco, Soomod judgmont onough for me. 1 And I wondered if tlioro wns a judgment, To this land boyond tho grave ; But no ono gavo an answer, And no ono camo to snve ; . Then I folt that tho futuro wns presont, And tho prOBent would novor go by, ! For it waB but tho thought of my lifo Grown into eternity. Then I woko from my timoly dronming, vTu And tho vision passed away, . And I know the far-away warning, Wns but a warning of yesterday. And I pray that I may not forget it. In the land boforo tho grave, That I may not cry in the futuro And no one como to savo. And so I iiavo learned a losson , Which I ought to havoloarnod before, , And which, though Iloarntit dreaming, : I hopo to forgot it no more. j " : So I sit nlono with my eonBcienco In tho plnco whoro the years increase, ; And I try to romombcr tho future In tho land whoro timo will conse And I know of tho futuro judgmont, How dreadful so e'er it bo, That to sit alono with my conscience Will bo judgment enough for mo.
