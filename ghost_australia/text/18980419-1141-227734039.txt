Boxing in South Africa. The M'Auliffe-Erugel fight at the Amphitheatre, Johannesburg, on 5th March proved rather a disappoint ment to those who had pinned their faiih on Krugol. From tbe start of the first round he never stood a ghost of a chance with the Australian, and a great deal of doubt lias been expressed as to whether the supposed body blow alleged to have given him his quietus actually occurred in the tenth round. M'AuUffe was very clever with both hands, and went in for hard punching right through. Ou the other hand, Krugel "monkeyed " about the ring just a little too much, and not once could he be said to have made any sort of sound fighting play. He was undoubtedly clever at ducking and squirming, and this activity alone saved him from being knocked out earlier. He proved a big disappointment to his backers, who encouraged him all they could so far as applause went. On the other baud, M'Aaliffe proved himself a cool, collected, and determined fighter ; &P; he wanted was to get to close quarters, and when by chance he did get there Krugel knew all about it. Repeatedly he gave tbe latter one, two, three in quick succession, with out & single return being made. He, moreover, got Krugel several times in a very uncocufortablo position against the ropes, from which the lattcrs agility alone saved him.
