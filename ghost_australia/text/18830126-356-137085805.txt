EATEE8R WARM !fIul Sydney Daily Telegraphl of Wednesday, says .-"It is understood that the editor of the tllelctin has entered.into partnership with a sexton; and that in future.that dole ful publication will beknown as the Grave yart. A ndw offo, we believe, is in course of excavation at H?aslam's Creek, and t?bo burial service is to be kept in type as a perpetual and appropriate leader. Sick persons, who find a menolancholy interest in the perusal of this publication, state othat there has. never been an issue without a corpse, a' gavestoeio, or a ghost. Thoro was,. however, an effort to be chlieerful at Christmas time, and accordingly a coloured supplement was produced, representing a dying bushman. In last week's issue there is an old cut of Kelly, the bushranger, with the namen of Mr. 'Wright, the'Postmaster General, printed under it. Mr. WVright may not be altogether a Model Minister, but he has dqne nothing to justify the Gravcyeard in first disfiguring his personal apearance, and then putting: himini the Ohainber'of Horrors.
