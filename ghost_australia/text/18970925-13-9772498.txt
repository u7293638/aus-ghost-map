A cn few books in this dull season are better worth reading than the story of A Great agricultural Estate, written by the Duke of Bedford (Murra)y Apart from its value to the political economist and the agriculturist it will be found extremely) in arresting To the student of life and history while as a mere recital of a great social experiment bearing on the welfare of many thousands who live by the land in old Lng I md it deserves by the simplicity dearness and fire with which the story is told at least as high a place in literature as any other story in this age <f story-teller The Duke of Be [ford if it is he himself is doubtless it is who is the author of this narrative, is to be congratulated on the excellent style and spirit with which he sets forth what must be i eel oned is a most able and strike ing plea for the large English landholders the estate in question is the great and famous patrimony of the Russell family, in the counties of Bedford and Buckingham The estate has been almost unchanged in charge in the possession of the family for some two hundred and fifty years it the siihstmtmlli the same in natural features as it was in the days of Henry the I eighth Such improvements its have been made no clue entirely to the enterprise and public spirit of the proprietors and they have been made not only without the assistance of the town but in spite of much discouragement and many impediments in the shape of excessive Imperial and municipal imposts which has borne with special hardship on this put titular property respect ally as that port on of it which comprises what used to be called 1 Thomas).
