I nSAn rumours of tho advent of another ghost, this timo Rt tho Royal Uotel. 1 am not surprised at tho news. The foot that thero woro spirits at Louch's has beon long Imprinted on tho tablets of mv raamorv. but that thoy wero strong enough to throw brick bata about, la a novelty that requires careful consideration, I am not mysou a belioer In tho ghost thoory, partly bocauao I uovor heard of aav gontloman in that lino who was able to do anything useful. If tho bodiea of deceased persons roBO from thoir oiloot tombs, to chop flrowood, or to administer ghoetly consolation to tho Inst baby during tho all'out hours of the night, then an on lightened proas might be ablo to do eoraething to wards recognising fito faot of thoir bri"tpco,and oudearouring to aiooUorato thoir uuhawy con- dition. Any euch ghoBt, posscaaing references, aud to whom salary is not an objeot, can hoar of a constant billot by applying at the office of this papor. Hut wheu one hears of ghosts haunting tho pnblio roads and taking up thoirro"- donco in liotols, without offering to pay thoir bill, it Tory naturally tbro\?a a s tignrn on tboprofeaMon-- aud makoa pcoplo incline to the coutictiou that wttBOghost who cleared out with Nluholafl' cash- bor. I bnvo ntOHon to bcliovo that it is » feraulo aplrit who Is eausiug all this commotlou at Loucu u, and if I hoar of anymore bricks Imuf tucked u> in tlio sheets, I will pubiiab the name of its comottry and the number of its grave, that is, u tho nplrit bo i-eally dead ; but when tbo ou swa imbHs cau hear tbo ghost's stays creak aud seo us iKjtticoata wbliik round tho cornor, there is a dim ausDioion tliat the tbiug doeau't hangsomohow, and euauiry Is apt to bo mado whothor the ghost came honestly by Its wearing apparel. But enough of this-I say simply »w u warning whocvor yon are drop it. Givo up tho ghost.
