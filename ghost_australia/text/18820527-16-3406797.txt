CONSECRATION OF THE RIGHT REV, DR. (JANE, FIRST CATHOLIC BISHOP OF ROCKHAMPTON. [FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.] Sydney, May 2-2. On Sunday last an event of very great importance to the Catholic residents of Queensland, and in which an unusual amount of interest has been manifested, took place at St. Mary's pro-Cathedral, Sydney namely, the consecra- tion of the Right Rev. Dr. Cam, who was recently appointed by his Holiness the Pope to the position of Bishop of the newly-estab- lished, diocese of Rockhampton. The consecration of a Bishop is one of the most interesting and solemn of the ceremonies of the Catholic Church, and the whole proceedings at St Mary's on Sunday were carried out with much solemnity by and ecclesiastical grandeur. It was not till half-past 11 that the service commenced, but long before that time the spacious building was filled in every part, and anon; an ornate and brilliant appearance. The entire sanctuary was artistically draped with bright coloured silks and damages, while the Archi- episcopal throne was covered by an elegant canopy of white satin. The high altar was adorned with Church ornaments and flowers, and as the light through the windows was subdued by the heavy draperies the appearance of the sanctuary was made the more imposing by that " dim religious light " which heightens the effect and adds so much to the impressiveness of all Church ceremonies. In the right aisle of the pro-cathedral a chapel was fitted up for the Bishop elect, and on the altar in this chapel there were vases of flowers and lighted tapers. The ecclesiastics who were to take part in the ceremonial assembled at the presbytery about 11 o'clock, and there the con- secrating prelate (Archbishop Vaughan), the assistant Bishops, the Bishop elect, and the officiating priests were attired in the proper vestments. Under the direction of the master of ceremonies (the Very Rev. Dean Dwyer a procession was formed, and after marching through the cathedral grounds the ecclesiastics and acolytes entered the church by the door near the choir. First came the acolytes in their picturesque costumes, preceded by cross and torch bearers ; then a number of priests attired in cassocks and surplices, after whom walked their lordships the Right Rev. Dr. Murray (Bishop of Maitland), Right Rev. Dr. Lanigan (Bishop of Goulburn), Right Rev. Dr. Torreggiani (Bishop of Armidale), and the Bishop elect, and their respective chaplains; then the archiepiscopal cross bearer ; next the deacons of the mass and throne and last of all the Archbishop and his attendants. As soon as the sacerdotal procession entered the building the choir burst forth in the anthem "Ecce Sacerdos Magnus." As chief celebrant and consecrating prelate Dr. Vaughan was arrayed in full pontifical, mitre on head and crozier in hand, and the attendant deacons wore elegent vestments of white and gold richly ornamented. The Bishop elect wore a magnificent cope and a small black Biretta, wine the Bishops of Maitland and Goulburn, in addition to copes and mitres of white silk, wore rockets, dances, and stores. When the procession reached the sanctuary all who had taken part in it were conducted to the places allotted them. Archbishop Vaughan was escorted to his " toadstool" near the High Altar, and the assistant Bishops and Bishop elect were accommodated with seats immediately in front of him, facing the altar. Dr. Torreggiani, who did not take an active part in the ceremonies, retired to a place prepared for him on the epistle side of the sanctuary. In addition to the Bishops the following clergy- men were present Very Rev. Dean Sheridan, V. G., assistant priest ; Very Rev. Dean Dwyer and Rev. J. Fleming, masters of care- monies ; Rev. J. P. Fitzpatrick and Rev. C. F. P. Collingridge, deacons of the mass ; Rev. J. J. Garvey and Rev. J. M. Garavel, deacons of the throne; Very Rev. Father Dalton, S.J.; Hew W. J. Kelly, S.J.; Very Rev. Pere Joly, S.M.; Rev. P. J. Mahon ; Rev. Father Ecnycr, S.M.; Very Rev. Dr. Byrne, of Bathurst ; Rev. A. Ambrosoli, and Rev. B. Callachor. Dr. Byrne acted as chaplain to the Bishop of Maitland and Father Ambrosoli as chaplain to the Bishop of Goulburn, while Father Callachor attended on the Bishop elect. The proceedings were commenced by the assistant Bishops bringing up the Bishop elect and. presenting him with respectful obeisance to the Archbishop, after which they resumed their seats. - The senior assisting Bishop (Dr. Murray then said :-.' Most Reverend Father Our Holy Mother the Church demands of you to promote the priest here present to the office of a Bishop." To this the consecration replied, "Have you the apostolic mandate?" The senior assistant Bishop said, " We have," whereupon Pure Joly, S.M., acting as notary to the presiding Bishop, read the mandate. After this somewhat lengthy document had been read Dr. Cani, kneeling before the con- secrating probate, pronounced the prescribed oath. The Bishop elect, in the words of the office, declared that with his whole heart he desired in everything to act in conformity with the Holy Scriptures. He also promised to teach by word and by example to the people over whom he was to be set whatever things he had learned out of the Holy Scriptures. He promised also that he would reverently receive, teach, and keep the traditions of the orthodox fathers, and the decretals, and constitutions of the holy and apostolic sec. He likewise promised canonical obedience to Pope Leo XIII, as the representative of St. Peter that he would so order his personal conduct as to avoid all that was evil, and with God's assistance would follow after all that was good; that he would teach and practice the cardinal virtues that he would as much as possible avoid secular affairs, and forbear to seek after worldly gain, and that he would practise and touch the virtues of humility and patience and lastly, that he would, for the Lord's sake, be kind to strangers and be pitiful to the poor. After all the questions had been satisfactorily answered, the consecrating prelate said "' Most beloved brother in Christ, may this thy faith be increased by the Lord until thou shalt come to true and eternal happiness." All in the sanctuary answered " Amen !" and then the Bishop elect was conducted to his chapel, where he divested himself of his cope, and was vested with chasuble and simple, stole, tunic, dramatic, pectoral cross, and sandals. Pontifical High Mass was commenced by Archbishop Vaughan and Dr. Cani, and the assistant Bishops at the special altar in the chapel recited the serviced the mass in unison with the consecrating prelate at the High Altar. The epistle and tact beingunislicd, the Bishop elect proceeded to the sanctuary, accompanied by Dr. Lanigan and Dr. Murray, when the consecration briefly instructed him on the duties of his episcopal office. The consecrates then called upon the congregation to pray for the newly- appointed prelate, that his episcopate might be for the benefit of the Church, and then followed the Litanies with special suffrages for the elect. Then the book of Gospels was placed on the shoulders of the Bishop elect, and after that the consecrated and assisting Bishops solemnly laid their hands on his head, saying the sacramental words, "Accipe Spiriluin Sandton" (Receive thou the Holy Ghost). The consecrated having laid aside his mitre, offered up the prayer propitiate domine, etc, and so passed on to the Susan Coats. The beautiful hymn, . "Veni Creator Spiritus," was subsequently begun by the Archbishop, and completed by the assembled clergy, with Fntheirf Fitzpatrick and Garavel as the principal chanters. Whilst the hymn was being rendered the presiding prelate anointed the head of tbenewBishopwith chrism, saying the duly-appointed words, "Be thy head anointed and consecrated in the order of high priest by heavenly benediction, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." The hands of the now Bishop were next anointed, and having done that the Consecrated said, " Be these hands anointed with sacred oil and the chasm of sanctification ; as Samuel anointed David to be king and prophet, so so they anointed and consecrated. In the name of God the Father, and of God the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, bearing on them the likeness of the holy cross of our Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ, who redeemed us from death and obtained for us the kingdom of heaven." Pi ayers were then offered for the check at the conclusion of which the consecration blessed and gave the new Bishop his crozier or pastoral stall', which was of brightly burnished silver ; his episcopal ring, the book of Holy Gospels and lastly, with the other prelates he greeted him with the fraternal kiss of peace according to the ancient custom of the Catholic Church. When placing the ring on Dr. Carr's finger- the consecrated said, "Receive this ring the pledge of silence, that, being adorned with the token of untainted fidelity, thou mayest guard with honour incorrect The practise of God, His Holy Church." On handing him the crozier he said " Receive this staff of the pastoral office, that in the correction of vice- thou mayest employ severity with kindness,,' and exercise judgment without auger, and that in cherishing virtue thou mayest soothe the minds of th dear sis without neglecting faith peacefulness, the severity of i em off, and on presenting him with the Book of Gospels, "l√Æcceivothe
