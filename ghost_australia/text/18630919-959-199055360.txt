HUNTING. 8EVBKE - IHIJ WKDH ? IHB : ? ':? «B.O, . . . ? Deae Bell,— On Saturday last, a lovely ? morning (despite a spice of frost and fog at son- . . rise), there was a muster of some forty mounted at Jesse Marley's hoBtelry, Cheltenham road. . Tbo route to the kangnroo coverts, taken by the ;. llnstor, was the same as asual; but better luck . attendod his throwing forward the hounds than ' nsual, for within half an hour after the ohenrfnl ' Yoicks 1 in there I' the nick wore in fnll cry after a doe, that led tho field so merry a ... dance for about six miles, and over tuck rattling , enclosures, that scarce a dozen sportsmen wcrO1 up when the scent failed. Finding it useless. to; oast round and round, Mr. Watson made for : Graham's, where game is always afoot, and speedily a long tailed 'un bounded away. Fence after fonce was luckily crossed by the few,, and plncldly charged by the many, but ' small , by degreos, and disgustingly less,' waxed tho ;: cavalcade, until a bare half 'dozen were within cooey ! at tbo Dandenong road. In fact, only the Master, on Jumbo, the whips on Littlo Wonder and the little grey, Young Hector,' ' the judicial chestnut,' and the Don; composed the six fortunate ones able to live bo far at the Blasbing paco caused- by a breast high scent. Soon after crossing the said road, all arand and trace of the honnds were lost, and the remnant ol the field wore ' left lamenting,' like Lord UUa for his daughter. ? NIMROD'S GHOST.
