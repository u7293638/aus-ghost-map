Step by step he advanced nearer to the: fleeing girL Nina, turning her white face ever her shoulder, east one quick, despairing gfeaoe backward. Only too well she recognised the tall, 'Oh,. Heaven help me!* she thought, 'my etienffth is failing ! Death, would be preferable to falling into his bands ! but I may not take the life Heaven — ' The thought ended in a low cry of thankf ul ness. On the little wooded plateau, to which, she had nearly descended, she bad all at once descried a rude cottage. ' The toy-maker's !' she gasped, recalling Mrs. Allingham's answer to a question which the lonley habitation had drawn froci Doctor Jeffries the previous evening. Inspired with fresh hope and courage, her feet bore her swiftly toward the haven. Ab she neared the cottage her flagging strength vtkb plainly evidenced in her reeling steps and diminished speed. . Doctor A^'iE^gY' watched her with a madden ing anxiety. ! 'She will kill herself!' he thought. 'I shall lose her after all ! Ten thousand curses on Lady Bsauohamp and her cursed pellets.' Almost as the thought framed itself in his taind Nina pulled open the rough gate leading to the toy-maker's humble tenement. In a moment more she had flown, across the porch and tottered into the room. At the sound of the gate-latch and the sight of \- tiie pale vision of loveliness that instantly con fronted him, the artisan dropped his tools, rose hastily from his seat, and exclaimed in German : ' Ah J what is this ? What is this ?' With a -wild, anguished cry, Nina flung herself e*t bis feet ' Oh, save me ! save me ! 'For the love of Heaven save me !* she cried. ' They are poison ing me ! They are plot — ' The words died on her lips in a frantic scream. The rueh of feet, the loud bang of the gate told her that her pursuer was close at hand. In the extremity of her terror she clasped the toy-maker's knees with the desperate clutch of the drowning. 'Oh, save me from him I Pity me! Protect tae !' she shrieked, turning a swift, shuddering glance backward to the door. \- As .the wild appeal broke from her lips the poctor bounded into the room and to her side, and bent over her in a glow of passionate ten derness. ' Mj poor Nina ! my darling girl !' he cried, Ms voice ijremfBous in its caressing fervour. \ The words, the look, the tone, completed the girl's terror. » As .her shuddering, abhorrent, gaze met his, eha uttered a low, moaning cry, and the nest instant swooned at his feet. ? The toy-maker, warned by her relaxing grasp, hastily extended his arms. But, before he could do more, young Allingham had caught her and lifted her to his breast. ' Water, .Rudolph ! Water V he shouted im periously, bearing hi? insensible burthen to a rude, cushioned settle against the wall. ' Water, wine, brandy ! anything that you have., and be quick.' Almost before the command was spoken the artificer had disappeared, running hastily* into the little kitchen beyond. He returned with a bowl of water and a bottle of Shenish wine. Standing the former an a chair at the doctor's side he proceeded to uncork the bottle. ( It was done quickly and with a will; but his fchrewd eyes watched young Allingham's half frantie efforts to restore the prostate girl with something more than interest in the result. There was a brooding anxiety and questioning doubt in them that the doctor could not have failed to notice had he been less absorbed. The cork drawn, Eudolph poured a portion of the liquid into a cup which he had brought with him, and harried to young Allingham's side. , For a little the hitter took no notice of him. But presently, as a gasping sigh and a fluttering movement of the eyelids betokened the return of consciousness, he dropoed the wet handkerchief, and with a stifled 'Thank Heaven!' wheeled round and seized the cup, Hastily drawing a compressible little silver oup from bis pocket he poured a spoonful of the de epiaed Shenish wine into it, and putting aside the remainder, gently raised Nina's head and pressed the cup to her lips, as she opened her eyes. Too weak to resist, or even to think of resist ing, the girl sipped its contents, and again sank baok to her former position. * For a moment Dr. Allingham gazed down upon the white exquisite face with eyes of mingled 3-fl»r and fear. Then ail-at once softly turning : e motioned the toy-maker to follow him to ci ih. ? v r-\i,' he said, rapidly, in lowered tones, ' you 1st go up to the castle for me.

He seemed to hasp gathered something from the swarthy, 'fviJl-jg.wR^ fⅇ immensely con solatory to him. His fiast words as-the toy- maker entered proved that it was so. He said : 'It is all as it shpald /be, thoa^ Budolph ?' At the souad of fcha singalatly fine, clear voice Eudolph turned -with a hearty but profoundly re spectful laugh.r 1'hea ha? cjrifed : - - * Ah, boarder 1 you Tbavebeenreadingme before-, hand again! T«s,it is as it should be. I, too, was in moitaj feai ati first. You heard her, boarder ? You heard what she said ?' ' Yes. X was just about ooming ia yonder.' With that answer the old man shook his yellow-white locks in the direction of the tall closet. . ' Ah V breatihed En.d,o3ph^ in frightened tones. ' No «ause for ala^ia, Eudolph,' answered the other, quickly and sadly. * I always listen. But go on/ he oontinued, returniag to the point from which they had wandered. ' Hgw do you know it is sight?' . ' She is insane, boarder, and his patient and sweetheart.' v'Ah!' There was a world of doabt, fear and anxiety in that simple ejaculation. Eudolph read 'the tone, and cried out cheer fully, once more x&suraing; his seat at his work table: ... ' ^Nevejcfearjboavdej'. It is all right, I promise you. I Eiwhin},, remember. He loves her as he loves his eyes, s,e4 no woader. She's a beauty, in spite of her wild looks.' The old man sat down without repjy. His chin dropped to his breast ; his hands to Ms lap. He neither moved, or spoke, but sat with eyes fastened upon, the floor. The toyrioaker now and then looked a tbim, but silently pursed his work, with the air of o»e not unaocustbmedto such moods. lleaawhile Kina was dxivea rapidly and in an incredibly short spaoe of time to the' castle. ' Mrs. AlMngham received them at the gates, where she had anxiously stood watching the road from the moment of her command to Ber nard. She led the way into the porte- cochere with feelings she had no intention of betraying. . But at sight of Nina's paULd face, as the doctor tenderly lifted her from the cushion, she forgot her caution, and cried, in quick, smothered tones : ' Berthold t Is she dead ?' Doctor Allingham's eyes blazed upon her in a passion too deep for -words. Look-and tone had said as plainly as look and tone could say — * I hope she is dead 1' Eeplying with a stern, negative movement of his handsome head, he strode into the rotunda. Brigitfca stood there ready to receive her charge. ' Lead on !' called out the doctor, harshly. The placid, satisfaction of the woman's counte nance was dispelled as if By. magie. Grave and frightened, she hastily obeyed. The doctor sternly followed, Mrs. Allingharn, pale and anxious, dose at his heels. Arrived at Nina's chamber, he placed the girl tenderly on the bed. That done, he paused one moment to try her pulse, and then -wheeled fiercely round to the terrified Brigitta. Seizing herrbuphlybythe shoulder with one hand, he pointed witii the other to Nina. ' Listen !' he panted, hoarsely. ' I love her ! I mean to marry her ! Harm one hair of her head, utter one harsh or disrespectful word, and you will wish yourself fathoms deep in the sea ! You know me ! See that you obey me!' Ending with those significant words, he turned to his mother, and firmly but courteously taking her by the arm, led her to the door, saving : ' Brigitfca is capable. She knows -what to do and how to do it, and it is better that the poor child should not open her eyes upon either of us. Be sides, I wish to talk with yon.' As they passed into the corridor he suddenly paused, with his hand on the door, and looked back at Brigitta.. 'In less than five minutes I shall bring the necessary restoratives, he said, rapidly. ' In the meantime get her to bed without the slightest delay.* With those words he cast a last impassioned glance upon Nina and closed the door. Addressing a hasty apology to his mother, he dashed past ner and down to his study for the promisedTpestorativee.' _ By no means sorry to be relieved of his com panionship for awhile, Mrs. Allingham pursued her way to the same drawing- room, from which they had been so' unexpectedly and startlingly drawn. There Dr, Allingham, a . little later, found her. Mrs. f liinjirTnyn received him in silence. Her eyes fastened solicitously upon his white and agitated faoe, she waited to hear what he had to say. He wasted no time in needless words. Flinging ivJTnggif into a ohair close to her own, he began harshly and abruptly with this etraight f or ward declarations ' The best/ he said, *«od, indeed the only way to preserve our unity is to mate it clear to your, mind that njy plot is , eminently worthy of your full and earnest commendation— thai it is one which wholly and solely considers our advan tage, to the complete exclusion of j&ady; Beau ohamp.J 'Ah!' involuntarily breathed Mm Alling ham. /Lastly/ pursued the dootorj. heedless of the interruption — 'laatly, it i? a plot as deep as the sea, and capable of being successfully developed down the minutest, parttendar/ ' ' He paused, there witk darkening brow.

Brjgiifca told her, aad in. a voice so markedly soft aad deprecating that the girl was seized -with, a ne?f terser. J Ttowoia^had always been strictly respeet ful, but this gentleness- (born of the doctor's finely threats,/, \taa something eatvcGly foreign to her ordinary BaaHaer, and, therefore cause for' .wiljiBusBicions to,ifina.. . . Brigitia, observiiig tbe girl's 'evident fear and hesitation, said quietly in the- same soft way : ' The njftster told ms to oaH him, Miss, if you refused to take the medicine.' As the doctor had foreseen in. leaving that mes sage, it had, its iostani effect. Nina swallowed the drops- with almost eager : haste. The dread, of young Allinghaxa was. Hiore temble than the dread of the woman's treachery. * The master/ continued J&igitia;, as she laid the spoon, aside — ' the master ai§o told me to say that you musi not be afraid of anything that is brought you, Miss. — that you must always remeffi buF- you are safe.' Nina looked, at her a moment without reply,, and then «bsked_ abruptly. , though feebly : 1 * Who are you?' t . i Taken by surprise, BrisjittO: hesitated, but quickly recovering herself again, answered : * I am the mistress' maid/ 6he said, the doc tor's instructions still fresh in her mind. ' ' Then you have lived at the castle before ?' ' Since I was fir it brought here by the mistress, years ago, I have been her maid and assistant maid for twenty years, Miss. I took mj mother's plsee, iKho. died -when I was fifteen.' Nina asked no more questions. The sickening f assurance that she had been foully entrapped needed no further connrmation- .Closing her eyes she yielded herself toBrigitta's manipulating hands, 'her- thoughts busy -with the probable part that Doctor and Mrs. Jeffries; had played in the discovered' plot. She directly, dismissed them, strong in the be lief that both they and her- fatke? had been the blind instruments of Lady Beauchaznp's wilL Her thoughts next turned to the consideration, of the events of the morning. ' Yes/ she finally said to herself, cfor the pre sent I am safe, so far as regards my life, and, being so, I wiU qxiietiy submit to Dr. Allingham's treatment. The sooner I am well the sooner I shall be in a condition to devise and make my escape.' But evea as that hope entered her mind she shuddered at the remembrance of the terrible obstacles in her path. True, however, to her determination to recover strength as speedily as possible, she committed herself- to Him in ?whom she believed, and sooa. after fell quietly asleep. Under the combined influences of Brigitta*s manipulations, the doctor's drops, and her own fatigue and loes of rest, she slept long and placidly. Three or four times during the hours in which 6he lay unconscious, Dr. Allingham stole softly to her bedside, and as softly felt her pulse. ' She does well/ he breathed, at his first visit to the patient and watchful Brigitta. ' Let her sleep ob till she awakens naturally. For her sleep is the best and surest invigorator/ That said, he turned and looked sharply around the chamber. Brigitta, still in wholesome awe of his anger and vengeance, looked at him with anxious eyes. Presently he gleneed at her and beckoned her to the other end of the chamber. ' ' That cursed bottle !' he hissed, fiercely. 'Where is it?' Brigitta nodded hurriedly, and went to a close cabinet at some little distance, returning with the article in her hand. * Whendidehe take the last dose?' againhissed. tbe doctor, tna brow black as night. « This morning, before breakfast, master.' The doctor clenched one raised hand in im potent wrath, and strode savagely to the nearest, window. He drew back his arm in the act of fiingin? bottle and contents into the ruinous courtyard below, and then all at once checked himssif . He looked at the bottle, hesitated, then raided his hand again, and finally, with a muttered ejaculation, wheeled sharply from the window and left the chamber. At the end of the long corridor he went through the same silent pantomime, with the same fruit less result. 'No !' he said, slowly moving on to the stairs— 'Hfo I Betterkeep it ! She might drive me to the deed ! I love her now with all my heart, strength, and soul ; but she must not brave me too far — niy beautiful, peerless darling !' With those strangely caressing and threaten ing words he carried the botfcle dowa to hi8 study, and locked it away for possible use. A few minutes later Mrs. Allingham entered the chamber. She entered by the ante-room, in which Nina's luggage had been placed, halting a few steps from the door. There she beckoned Brigitta to approach. As the woman reached her she caught her by the arm, at the same time gently closiner the door. , 'You have-not told your master?' she whis pered, hurriedly, anxiously, adding, in a quick, half-skriakiag tone, aa the maid looked at her in questioning doubt: 'I mean concerning — .what— she saw last night, or rather, this morn ing?' Brigitta answered in the negative. * You must not I' pursued Mrs. AI^TigTig.^ im, presaively. 'These is not Another chamber; in the castle in 'which she will be secure, absolutely secure.
