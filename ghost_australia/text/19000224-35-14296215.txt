CHURCH THANKSGIVING FUND. LETTER FROM THE ARCHBISHOP. The Archbishop has addressed the following letter to the clergy, laity, and friends of the church in the diocese of Sydney -" You are aware that a resolution of the synod, in its session lost September, asserted the Jdcsircbihty of a vigorous and united effort lifting made to establish at the close of the century ' a Church Thanksgiving Fund,' and I was requested to take such measures as I deemed expedient to obtain thanksotferiags for the sus tentacles and extension of existing organisations and the reduction of parochial liabilities ' As this year is the closing year of the 19th century, the definite initiation of the fund should be secured during the year, and in December last 1 issued a circular letter to the archdeacons and rural deans, asking; them to bring the matter before the clergy and laity in their districts, so that I might receive such suggestions as might aid me in estimating the feelings; of the various parishes in regard to the fund. The general tenor of the replies I have re- ceived is sympathetic I append to this letter a reviSed memorandum on the range of the fund and I ask your careful cout ideration of it I will now proceed to express candidly my own views as to the principles which should actuate us in raising this fund First, let me say that if the establishment of the fund meant the introduction of another permanent financial organisation I should not suppose it or ask for its establishment I believe that to have sufficient parochial and diocesan machinery already in existence for the distribution of financial aid for church purposes, if the machinery could be kept up in full use Ino real need is that of more r og ular, proportionate, und systematic giving by all classes. Now, the idea of the Thanksgiving Fund is to stimu- late generosity, and to make a special effort which may give our machinery a new start, and relieve it from some impediments to its action The thought of what we owe to God's mercy in the development of the Church of England in this century, and of its expensive progress in our colonies, should be a pure erful motive in constraining us to carry out that special effort which we have asserted to be desirable ' 2 I wish to lay emphasis upon the positive duty of making the effort an extraordinary one As has been rightly said concerning the jubilee after ings in connection with the missionary festival, to be held, God willing, in August next, our offerings should be a reality, not it sham.' to transfer and so to diminish subscriptions or donations from the list of our usual contributions would be a delu- siva show and not a real gift This should mean a, determination on the port of those who are already supporting Church work to dust themselves in order that they may give more, whilst those who have hitherto given nothing are hereby offered an opportunity of making special gifts, in the hope that fresh interest may be aroused in helping forward the work of the Church 3 The extinction of debt should form a primary and prominent feature in our special effort The release of the large amount of money now expended for paying annual interest upon loans would in many cases remove a clog to Church progress, which at present hamper? parochial freedom and also prevents that oxtrn-parochial sympathy without which diocesan life cannot but be feeble, and our missionary obligations full to be satifactorily fulfilled 4 You will agree with me, I am sure, that the whole movement for this fund should be accompanied by earnest prayer to God We need to pray for an increased spirit of liberality and self-sacrifice, and for the removal of any mutual jealousies or suspicions which may impede godly union and concord ttmougot us, It is only by the in wrought energies of God's Holy Spirit that an effort like that proposed in the Thanks giving Fund eau really succeed If we are in wardly moved by the Holy Ghost,' the ministry, whether of clergy or laity, will wax really strong and ladriTerenco, apathy, and backwardness in giving will be overcome I earnestly command the formation and raising of such a fund as was contemplated in the resolution of BJ nod, and I will take measures; us carry us I can to secure the nomination of the. executive committee mentioned in the annexed memorandum "
