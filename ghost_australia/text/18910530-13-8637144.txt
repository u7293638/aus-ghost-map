THE QUARTERLY REVIEWS. The formation of the British Economic Association has led to the institution of a new quarterly review, entitled the Economic Journal, issued under its authority, but open to writers of different schools. It will cover the same ground as the Journal des Economistes in France, and the Giornale degli Eonomisti in Italy ; and the first number is so good as to justify the expectation that this periodical will render an important service hereafter to the cause of economic science. In an article on the eight hours day in Victoria, Mr. John Rae relates the history of the movement in this colony, and shows its beneficial re- sults. He also points out that the protectionist si stein here has hail little or nt thing w do with the establishment ni the jir'.iciple and that one of its best mends was CiV-iin (now &ir; ".ndrew) ( larke, at that time June)or General, oi, in othei woids, Munster ot Public Works Mr Rue com c lis in the "uhno't universal opinion in tlietoloin that the men work hauler now while thei ure at their work, und that they turn out work of a better quality than they di I uutler the long houi sjstem ' An nbstraet ol the general census taken last) ear m the 1 intcit Stutes indicates that, it the figures au to be idled upon, the population has ver) ncnili doubled itself m thirt) ) cars, but that the rate ot increase has been steadil), though nut greiith, declining during the hist two décades J lie population is now l>2,li__,_ ill dr Seebohm contributes a papei on french peasant proprietorship, in which he brings to light a new and iaht! explanation ot the enessiie stibdniston of the land in thut countr' and this is that it had its root in the open Ililli S)stcm of husbandr) once so widely spiead over Europe, the chief feature of which was the cultivation of strips by their individual owners, and the right of common pasture over them after the removal of the crops The mansus of Mero vingían Gaul and the hoba of the Rhenish districts, like the "yard lands' of Saxon england, seem to have been composed of scattered holdings over which there was a traditional right of raine pature An investi gation of economic doctrine in England during the eighteenth century by the Rev Dr Cunningham brings into well deserved prominence the great obligations which the science owes to Adam Smith, by which a new form was given to old inquiries. 'He severed economic science from politics, " observes the writer ; " he dealt with it as concerned with physical objects and natural laws to his English predecessors it had been a department of politics or morals, while many of his English successors le cognised that in his hands it had become more analogous to physics, and delighted to treat it by the methods of mechanical science Whether consciously or uncon sciously, he gave the turn to economic pro blems which has brought about the develop meut of modern economic theory." Who is the "capitalist who has become of late yeura so obnoxious to a large section of the community in Great Britain, on the con tinent of Europe, in the United States, and in the "Australian colonies'? The answer supplied to this question, in so far as the mother country is concerned, by Professor J S. Nicholson, in an article, entitled '"the living Capital of the United Kingdom, is a startling one, for it discloses the fact that while the value of such capital, as represented by human factors of wealth, is more than five times the value of dead capital, that is to say, of all the lands, houses, railways, mines, furniture, pictures &c;, in Great Britain, more than one half of the living capital of the nation, or to be exact, 24 000 million pounds out of 47,000 million pounds, is represented by the wage earning classes, who are there fore the largest capitalists in Great Button Adopting the methods of estimating the value ot the people pursued bj Mi Giffen, nutt talune, the income ot lalioui, in the or linar) sense, to be SOO million pounds I« i annum, he reckons its capital value, at 10 jems' puichuse, to bl 21,000 million j omi,Is, while that of the trades and protessioiis-consideied meiel) as "superior domestic annuals, i eared for their nftection til. dispositions and intellectual and moral nclit it it s -he estimates nt 12,000 million pounds , domesticated humanitj, 10,000 mil lion pounds, and professional salaried oflicial ilniu, 1 000 million pounds , making a total of 47 W10 million pounds Jrgo the vva-e earn inge lasses of Great liritam hold, ni their omi .mons, upiwuds of a cleir moietv of its hung capital, and just tlnee times the amount oi its dead capital, which is rt kout d it S,O0O million pounds 1 he Au.tiinn view ot the theoij of value is set loith bj Piofcssor E Mieser, oi 1'rugue , lins being, ns it is in deinuiii), that "in etonoiny value decides ever)thing not onl) the puce of the bar ¡.inn but also what amount of consumption, productive einplo)ment, und outliij entering min it is permissible Some aspects of the tluoi) of rent aie presented by Mr L L 1'iiee and the fall m tliepnecof silver isdis tu-stii b) Mr li II Gibbs, who contends thut it w as the cause, and not the efleet, of tlie c1 isnig of the I lench Mint to that metal, the liuul of that institution giving it as IUB opinion that the German demonetisation and the el ist over) of the silver mines in Colorado «ere the leut occasion of the stead) decline «Inch has takeu place since 1872 In a paper on the bo) cott us tm element in trade dis pates Mi lohn llurnett speaks of it as one of the links m the chain of retaliatory warfare between capital and lnlotir and uryies that " if -kilfull) ami judiciously used, it must ni« ti) s remania terrible weapon in the hands of labour for use ntninst eapital, where the circumstances ore luvouiuble to its application ' Ihe pntctiitil dtfhculties of Soualism are dwelt upon in an cssaj bj Mr Leonard Goiutnej, M I' tluso ditllculties being both moral and uittllectuul, and he contends that thev me not merelj serious, but insuperable '"Hie organisation suggested bj it of a national, Btill more of nn international, economj, he ii series "is impossible This, if true, is lund as fur as its pretensions nie concerned , hut if does not tlnow us back hopelcssl) on an ^unimprovable anarch) lie believes, ni lectl, that soeiet) is cupable of being tunis f ruiedbv a growth in temperance, prudence, nii(lthegittofs)mpnth) Hit present is on the whole, a heavy number ot the Edinburgh Reuen Its most entertaining article occupies the first place, nnd skims the cronin oft of the two volumes ol letters written fiom Pans during the _,rent »volution bj Mr *.\ A Miles, and no« published bj Ins lost surviving son Mr allies vasa confidential u_pittn» the British Coi eminent, and he seems to have (.one to liunee full of ardent sympathies with "the cniiseof f leedom, wine li was supposed to lind its noblest representatives in the men who, after overthrowing the in stitutions of the countr), foimnll) de positl the Almightv Hut a closer in sight into their charactei and conduct s iberetl his imagination 1 ighteen months i^tir the tall of the Trench monarch), the v"ter informs his coirespondent that ' from dint ptuod to the present moment ever) Mud of savage enoinnty- every possible 1 hinder that the most confirmed ignorance could commit-baie stained with sable spots tin annals ol this wretched, impoverished and distracted kingdom As to the condi tion of Paris he compares it to "liedlnm Irokcn loose uni its wild and melancholy inhabitants going full course to lunacy in Moorfields - mialling St Georges Iields, «e pastime An eindite essui on Sunuli ni" ian antiquities, bused upon the most i cent woi! s upon the subject calls attention to thecuuous points of lesemblance »Inch present themselves between the characteristics and customs of the North men and those of the earl) Greeks as »usciibed bj Homer, as also the gieat poll tun! events vi Inch followed the coming of the »'kings one ot these having been the Beieiance of the Uirlovingian inheiitnnce, iio-th of the Alps into a German Retell and a Frencl kingdom, and the transformation of the Saxon confedeintion into nn English monarch! In the next article, a jurist reviews the administration of justice in the mother country dining the last half century, and examines the various reforms which have been eflected, while at the same timo indicating the remedies which appear to be required in consequence of the existing defects in that system; the abolition of the old circuit system and the throwing of more of the ' judicial business of the country into the county courts being among the number. A sketch of what lins been accom- plished by the various expeditions which have explored the Antarctic Circle forms an' appropriate prelude to a plea for fresh efforts in that direction; and Great Urituinis ad- monished that her position in this hemi- sphere is such that she ought not to relinquish " to any other name or nation the priv ¡lege of accomplishing within the Antarctic regions whatever Is able to be accomplished hythe wit and energy of man having at his disposal the full resources of .the present and : the fertile'experience of the past." A critical survey of .the War of .Secession in the United . States, from the pen, ap- parently, of a military contributor, exhibits both the faults and the virtues of those who were engaged in that great conflict, and declares thut. nothing more than discipline was required to give either belligerent an easy triumph. Tlie writer praises the good qualities of the American soldiers, whom he pronounces to have been superior, in some respects, to the conscript levies of Europoan states ; and adds that, in his opinion; " only sounder training is required to make our own citizen soldiers fully equal to the troops of any possible, invader." It is not agreeable to li'itrn,' flinn nn article on Cyprus, that " the history of our 12 years' occupation of that island is n record of wasted . op- portunities, of disappointed hurles, . of loss of prestige, of loss of self-rcspecl, and of loss of that power to do good which is the proudest privilege of a great nation." Why this is so is fully explained, and the writer argues that " with a little more fore- sight and a little more liberality Cyprus might become a possession not inferior in value to Malta, anti superior to Corfu." In the matter of finance it appears there lins been an annual surplus of income over ex- penditure during the last 11 years amount- ing in round numbers to £500,000. A scho- larly analysis of the. newly-found treatise of Aristotle sets out witli the contention that the manuscript is not a modern forgery, nor a forgery belonging to any century of our era, and tliat '' it is the work which is quoted by grammarians, and ail other later writers, as the composition of Aristotle, tinder'the title which it now bears." Anil after measuring the degree of authority which should be attached to the statements 'con- tained in the work, the critic arrives tit the conclusion that it is one of the deepest interest, and as such will he heartily welcomed by till historical scholars. " The liiillling of the Jesuits" is the titln of a nmrative of the events which occurred in the mother country with respect to that organisa- tion during the hist 20 years of the'six- teenth century, when such energetio attempts were made to place the whole of the Catholic priests in England under the direction and control of the Jesuits. This was frustrated, however, bytlte issue of a Pupal brief in October, 11102, which settled the dispute between the Jesuits and thesecnlar.clergyin favour of theiutter ; and since then, it is said, the most eminent Catholics in . Great Britain have been seculars to a man. The career of the late John Henry Xewmnu while a member of the Church of England is described in nn article which constitutes au acceptable contribution to his biography ; and we are not aware that the motives which inlluenced him to forsake its communion have been anywhere more acutely discerned or more clearly explained than- in the last three or four pages of this paper. Tlie publica- tion almost simultaneously in Paris of two works-one by .a French and the other by n Russian writer - on the relations of the Emperors Alexander mid Napoleon at the time of their meeting at Tilsit and Erfurt, suggests the discussion of the revived project of a Itusso-French al- liance, for which an influential party in France is so jmssionntcly yearning. lint this can only be brought about, ns the reviewer shows very clearly,' by France surrendering her, secular policy in the Levant, and opening the Dardanelles, to the maritime, power of ltussin hy the possession of Constantinople. This was the .in. qua non of an alliance be- tween France and Kussia more than 80 years ago, when Napoleon and Alexander were virtually the masters of continental Uuiope, and if it was then found to be an, impracti- cable chimera, observes the writer, " it would, in the present state of Europe, encounter obstacles still more insurmountable.". That significant and widely-extended move- ment of our own times which has been called the new Paganism is the subject of an nbly.-written essay in the Quarterly Review, which exhibits ¡ts influence upon con- temporary literature, and more particularly upon that of France, and exposes its -sen- suality ; while deriding its pretensions to humanism, because it is " u philosophy which corrillos because it despairs, and oners man a momentary thrill > of passion in the place of life everlasting crowned with perfect human love." Ibsen's morbid and often. filthy dramas are dissected with a keen knife by a crltio who charac- terises the whole of their inise-en-i>eene as " entirely suburban- the pseudo-culture of the women, the vain bumptiousness of the men, the astonishing frankness of the language, the grasping eargerness to parade the latest scientific idea." Of " Ghosts" it is remarked that " it is too frankly horrible, too barbarously crude;" while' "Hedda Gabler," the heroine of which is " so monstrous a specimen of unfettered woman- hood," is deprecated ns exhibiting realism " in its most extravagant and possibly its most shameless form." According to the writer of an article on the newlj'-discovered palimpsest, the original manuscript is neither the work of Aristotle nor of any of the pupils whom he taught in person. Which ure we to believe, the Quarterly or tlie __Win burgh? A review of Major G. S. Clarke's work on fortification, past and present, con- ducts the reader of it to the conclusion that the British navy should be materially strengthened ; mid that "a reliance on forts, .harbour defences, and submarine mines is a first step towards relinquishing the command of the sea, on which our commerce, our empire, and our national existence depend." The provisions of the International Copy- right Act passed by the United States Con- gress ure exumined and explained by a writer who seems doubtful as to its effect ; and until this has been definitely ascertained, he is of opinion- that the English Government should hold ¡ts hand as regards any lemediiil legislation on the side of (Itcut Britain. An article on uiilveisity extension in the mother country, where it has already established, in nearly three hundred towns, " little garrisons of cultivated people who are anxious to organise a more thorough system of advanced instruction," concludes by re- minding the university authorities thut now is their opportunity for giving England an educated democracy, and for elevating mid ennobling that elementary instruction which lias shurpened intellectual curiosity in the minds of the musses. A notice of Maude vilU's Travels, suggested by the recent publi- cation of the version of them gil en in the unique copy which is preserved in tlie British Museum, seems to settle Eretty conclusively the fact that the ook was originally written in French and translated into English. Nearly forty pages of letterpress are devoted to an elaborate disquisition upon the recent judg- ment of the Archbishop of Canterbury with respect to the proper position of n minister of the Church of England during the com- munion service ; this judgment being, in the opinion of the leviewer, " the beginning of the end of the war of suppression which has been waging for half a century between High and Low Church." The nature ot the con- troversy will remind many persons ot the dis- pute between the lîig-endians and the Little enduuiB in the island ol' Lilliput. In a teview of the Plea for Liberty, already noticed in our columns, Mr. Charles Fairfield's chapter is dwelt upon at some length, and the Eng- lish publicare recommended to take waining by his " terrible account of the chaotic state into which Australian finance has fallen ;" while colonists themselves nre cautioned ugainst making such an unregarded múrente of their dobt as may endunger their credit, and perhaps entail distress and social ruin. The political article in the current uumbcr deals with the past and present relations of Canada and the United States, and is, to a great extent, historical. The Canadians are reminded that they arc now practically the musters of their own destiny, and that they must face grave political, financial, and com- mercial problems, which will test their patriotism to the utmost, and will require no ordinary statesmanship to solve wisely and well.
