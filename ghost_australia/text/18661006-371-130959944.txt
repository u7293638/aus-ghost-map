The^talk is that as ordinary trades are very dall of late, many persons are likely to adopt that of Captain Thqnderbolt, 'which,- whether the profits are largo or email, evidently has the advantage of being free from risk; that he and his accomplices are notoriously safe as long . fls .they .confine their depredations to the immediate vicinity .of the chief police station ; itbat tfce idea of a good haul of highwaymen occurring some day cannot * be entertained, since -^oodall, who was .apprehended in connection with the Hindmarsh matter, was dismissed 'for good and all,' without any attempt at identification ; that Mr. 'i&rangwaysV; friend, Captain, seems especially ^ pleased with ^playing '' hide-and-seek 'in the beart of 'the city 5 th$t if Ide had : turned to last Tuesday, and given him a **« 9M4jyv%&'{^ Appji^dc^pe ajjght not havebeen wounded;' 4hat Thunderbolt evidently ne\ er shuns policemen, while jhe is constantly in search of ^£a$-men ;. and that while his pistols only go off' ?occasionally, himself invariably manages i ^bodoso The talk is that Mr. Justice Boothby for ever presenting himself to the public in some new -fight, or rather in -same new shadow ; that in the *iase on Tuesday last, Macdonald y. Cralbraith, wherein His Honor endeavoured 10 prove ;that there was 110 Special Jury, but failed through the Jury finding a verdict specially opposed to his order, he gave a fresh instance ofthepro found originality of his genius; that t$e report states; that Special Juror John Brown, who dike John Smith, is supposed to be ' ubiquitous, was fined £10 for beiug absent from Court, but that on Mr.* Ingleby showing there was no such John j Brown 3s the one described, ' His Honor ' observed that in that case of course he would escape the fine.' The farther talk is that no human mind inferior, to that ,of a ^ewton or a Boothby could have conceived the idea of a non-existent per son escaping ft fi^e. ' ? The talk is th^t it is weljl the Adelaide : * General Post-Offiee possesses' more sub ttantial pillars iu the persons of Mr Lewis and others than the iron pillars .placed at the oonier8|oC,tti£ streets ; that if Mr. Hydrick's account of the latter bt * .correct, go citizens will be disposed to [ go from post to j?$Utr** although th- latter may be more conveniently situated for them ; that Mr. Hydrick's statement ^ ;is not intended to be ironical although the .pillars are; that the affair is alto gether a case of ftuJF—%, s regards tht apertures leading to the interior of tht .pillars. The talk is that, -the Registers para graph respecting the new wine-cellars l at the corner of Gilbert-place and Currie street . is important tp people *yho like to .take hoi^lgys ,-joplly ; tth^t it ig lucky tht ^cellars Jwre been ' opened,'as otherwise nobody could enter them.; -that feeing .situated -underground it is 'difficult to .understand how ,-the^r can have beei - »':fitted vrpf that ,if-'a couple of harr sandwiches' can secure the sale of » - goblet pf the wine, probably ;an immense ^quantity might be sold dt exported to tht Sandwich Islands; .that some , -interest .attaches to the question .whether Mr. J. W. Bull' will persuade his kinsman John ^nlltQ imbibe . colonial wine .in pre ference to -English ale. The talk adopting-the Register's .account of the ipatter, the popular oppo sition to the performances of the .ghost ? ^ .exhibitors, the ^Brothers Alexander, on i W edpesday night was quite unjustifiable ; J; .that the spectators, whatever they may ; ,eay to the contrary, -were most decidedly ^furnished with an illusion ;' that the .putting, out of i&e; Rights was t-$uite pro- !' :.per,seeing-that^i©^|-peai^ince of ghostss : -have always been attended with obscurity -that such incorporeal beings cannot be ! .supposed to have any connection with' .'lights;' lungs, heart, liver, brain, or? .anything else .substantial ; that it was ; ;not to be expected that Alexander either ; Jthe great or the little, would 'give up -the ghost' (and the half-crowns) in con- : jBequenee of ' a hubbub iu the shape of; snoises of every description^; that the; ^phrase, '.the illusion was repeated three ; -times with different su&jecis;' must be- ,npderstood tp mean that the ghosts of; -three several defunct persons were* ;ntteippted to be produced. The farther, talk (is that the matter of the ghost or ghosfes, whether produced or not, is alto- 1 .gether ^immaterial ; that the exhibition, instead fof being a spicy one, was evi dently deficient in ' Pepjoey and that a question arises whether, af the ghost did -not appear, it was ^titled to be con sidered an apparition. ^Rietalk is that the Northern Terri 4»ry land-holders are settled if the City .of Palmerston is not— that is if Crovern jnent do not ,deal liberally with them.; bnt littie doubt of the MinwW cting tonorablytn the matter; tbatthey over Hus^an^ of aJHgatore, nor treat the spe^u1it^«^bb1l5rn%;lettang tthem lose the price c^Sieir jBct^ib. , * JChe talk ^ |^at ;|iie 5nTit»tq:on;to go ' to .the 'We^baend jof ^Cg^ie- Btreet tp Bee V.

Ramsay on the high way Jeads'tbe leister's correspondentto suppose that Thunderbolt .gild Mi gang have ' travelled towards the northern shearing ; that the correspondent must be mis^fken, it is an ait leaat iu. the old country, .iliat men addicted -0 the ;lj^nd of v#A«^i»y iu which Thunder^ bolt indulges wzw travel northward. The tali is .that ;#lthough lawyers abound throughout South Australia, the eolonys&dly.reqiiire;^ another conv^^cer; that it is therefore gratifying that .Cobb and Co. have-established stables in Pirie- . street, for eobs, and eyery other class of horses; that it is bop^d th^t Messrs. Cobb's undertaking will be a ^i'tfJ?^ one.; that it is gratifying to observe that Mr. Roiiijse vell is delisted at Ane ' (J.Qod Times Coming,' and rejoices with the public at the prospect of reduced ;fapea and in creased facilities for travelling ; -th^t it is to be hoped there will neither be m$ carriage nor capsize iu bringing aboiit these amiable goings-on. The farther talk is that there is a general wish that both whips may drive a roaring trade, and that fares may be permanently fixed at a fair rate throughout the colony.
