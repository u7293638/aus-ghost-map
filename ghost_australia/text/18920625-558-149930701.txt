Besides, the meals Charley aud Nita liadnboeh used to of late had .not been very;-.,ela borate ones, -albeit Nita was ail - artist in matters ciilinnrjv.- -y:}' ■''■> Nita was thinking of '-this :as • she stood looking- for ."Charlie. Charlie had been having hard luck for two months.- - The boom: in ither Keystone district, gave! out first and capital with drowfrom the held, -leaving labor to seek" cinploj-ment elsewhere so,when Charlie's bad.luck began, there ,was\ nothing-he could fall back on ,-i in an einergencj'.- Then he and his" partner, Jem Brill, concluded that the claim they had been working on so diligently was a.-bad job, and they gave - it : up and took to the gulch, with-Weadily diseouraging results. . Charlie had tlie blues. Who would not hayo them, situated as , he was ? He owed more - money : in . Keystone than lie could ever hope to pay,unless by a run of wonderful good:luck, -for which the prospects were very slight. His .u-cdit had'1 given' out long1 since, aud it was only, by grubbing: hard every day that , ho could wash out enough,to buy the merest necessities for Nita and himself. Jem Brill pulled out and went over into the San Juan country. But Charliel-'nrquhar with-characteristic British stubboriioss said lie was going to stay and get square;witli Keystone if it tooka,life time ; and so,-every day, all alone, he worked like a slave, down in - the gulch ; and Nita, at the cabin, felt sorry for him, because he seomed so blue, and she wished she inight do something to help him. On her own «account,1 : she'. aievof worried—-not Nita. Win- should.she ? She had alw ays enough to. eat, and clothes to wear, and her wants were1 simple. When queer old Pablo, herJ father, died, two years ngo,- she. had been frightened, for she Was alone with/him. at the time : aud, after tliis, eaine- Nita's;ouly worry. .- Alone with the dead old ex-grandee, she • won dered what was to become of hor, now slie was alone. Tho slumty they lived in, even, was not theirs, and there was hardly enough iu Don-Pablo's purse to give him the commonest'sort; of burial. ■ And so, poor' little Nita, alone, and friendless, aud iguorant, sat, aud wondered, and cried until her pretty liead aclied. She had always been afraid of the dark,-butmow there was other and more ■ serious trouble to occupy her attention, and she did not : notice when the ' sun went; down, and the shadows deepened, into- darkness outside the open door. '-And there, ■ crouched in a comer, the dead old dou ljing "rim and silent on the bed beyond, the Seuor Eai-qnhar found her, when he canio to sec how Pablo was getting oh—foivhc had a kind heart, had the blue-eyed Senor" Earquhar—and. the handsome young Englishman picked up tli9 tearful, forlorn little biuidle, and cuddled poor, son-owing Nita in his arms as if she had been a baby ; and there was a queer note in his voice as he told her how he had promised the old don that his child should never lenow want, and that he would always care for her. So, the next day, after the dead wreck of the former proud Spanish gentleman had been buried, in an unmarked grave, far from his beloved Castile, Nita contentedly went home with the big young Euglisluuan, and there she had ' been o.ver since, happy and care-free, except - for the occasional little tits ol. sadness caused ky Charlie's blues. ■ _ Nit a, standing at tlio corner ot tlio cabin, looked wistfully "up the'; trail for Charlie. It was : of Charlie and Charlie's happiness and eomfort, that she thought. They had become nearer to each other of late. Nita, with a new look in her. dark eyes, and a new tender note in ker wonderful voice, as she flittered about, singing at her work, stopped ofteuer to handle sonic possession of Charlie's—his best pipe, or his neck-tic, or anything—aud Charlie knocked off work in the gulch a hit earlier every now and then,, and was always pleased to ace the glad look .with which she welcomed liini home. He had more time to spare from, his books now aud to hold- her on: his lap and talk to her,' and she loved to bo held and talked .to., Lqolc: in"'so intentlv up the trail, Nita was startled to hear a slight cimgh .vevy nearby, and turned, sharply; townee who or wliat the,intruder ..might!,,ho: An,, American, -seated easily! on-.a sleepy mule, was the author, of -the cough and he was looking at hoi quizzically.' • '"-mm " piave I tlio honor of addressing the Sonorita vJuauita hAristano^" he asked, with a flourish of ;hik hat; [.as he" removed that" article.
