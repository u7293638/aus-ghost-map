About a quarter to six the girls, whose names were Emma and Ellen Clover and Mary Ann Woodgate, aged respectively six, three, and two years, were playing in the Sicklesmere road, on the Bury side of the tollgate, whon their attention was at- tracted by some crab apples growing on a tree standing in the fence of a garden belonging to a Mrs Upsom. The children tried to get some of the apples and a little boy who saw them ran in and told Mrs Upsom that they were after her apples. She took no notice of what the boy said at first, but, on his going a second time said she would come and see after them, and took a gun which was hanging up in the house, saying she would frighten them with it. A neighbour, Mrs Wright, who was with her at the time, told her to mind that it was not loaded ; but she said, " Oh no, it is not loaded." She went out, taking with her the gun, which she presented at the children, who were about twelve yards from her ; when, either from the nipple catching her dress, or the pres- sure of her hand, the gun went off, severely wounding the eldest girl, and slightly injuring the other two. Two of the children were at once sent home, but the injuries of Emma Clover proved muoh more serious, she having been struck by no less than forty-saven shots, all over the front of her body, on both thighs, the left leg, and both her arms and hands, some of the shots having penetrated more than two inches. The woman on seeing what her thoughtlessness had caused, became so excited that it was necessary for Police-constable Grimsey to re- main with her all night to prevent her doing herself an injury. She declares that she was not aware that the gun was loaded, and expresses the deepest regret for what had happened. She is in the custody of the police, and will be brought before the magistrates tomorrow. The poor girl Emma Clover remains in a precarious state —Bury nnd Norwich Post.

Observing a number of poor people in a state of distraction around something ia the middlo of an open space, ho asked the causo. " Sure, then, where will poor people get the watlier at all, at all, barring the salt wather from the say ? " was tho reply*. Some mischievous boys had injured the publia pump, no water was to be had, nor could any ono be found either competent or willing to remedy the evil. Ilero was sufficient to excito the activo sympathies of Brunel. Impressed only by tho misery before him, to which ho believed he could supply the remedy, he did not hesitate. His coat was instantlv off. Tim win of the handle of the pump was at onoo knooked out, the piston raised, and the choked valve rectified. In his delight at witnessing the happiness which ho had thus spread around bim, he utterly forgot the coach and the objeot ^ of his journey. He cheerfully accepted his I position, however, and consoled li i m Belt' in being afforded the opportunity of forming an acquaint- ance with an Irish car, in which ho was obliged to continue his journey.-Life of Brunel.
