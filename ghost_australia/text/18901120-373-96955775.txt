DOCTOR SPENCER'S GREAT CRIME. I was sitfing in my offifia, half dozing over an interminable article on nutrition in the laet medical review. The fire in tbe grafe was low, the night was stormy, and the clock was just on the stroke of eleven. I was about to turn off the ess and retire, tor, nsing a b*e£ielor, I slept m the room eoimecied with my office, when tbere was a pull at the bell. I s-arted up feuddenly, for this was something quite new. Rliddlebury was a decorous sort of place- and the people usually managed to be, taken sick at seasonable hours. Old Mrs. Jerome had been threatening tt\ *3io r--l!* f'K/» Tiact- fi*r*» -rraaya finrl drnitir time I visited her she solemnly informed me that -when the decisive moment came she desired me present. But as nothing ailed the old lady beyond now and then sn indi mention, from too high lirinsr, I hid never yet been called upon to be present at her death. Now, I thought it must be that old M-3. Jerome i- eoine-. I took up my night lamp and went to tbe do--r. A gust of strong, damp sleet wind nearly extinguished the lifjht, but, sharting it with my hand, I discerned the face of a woman. 4 Gome in,' I said, holding open the door. She declined with a gesture of im patience. * You mast come out and be quick about it/ she said, in a sharp decisive vote?. I put on my overcoat without demur, locked the surgery door, and Rtenped into thft storm. As I did so the woman laid a arm nanu on my arm, and pat tinp h^r fnce close to mine, said : ' Doctor Lockwood, can you keep a secret ? ' ? I think so, madam.' * Swear it.' 1 Very well, then, I swear i(.' 'That is ri Au.' A man respects an oath, tfiou^b. why he should is a snysterv, since men's mouths are running over with them. ' \Ykitlw are you tikin? me, end for viist purpose ? ' 'To the Clifton House to see (he tH'.'jt' !?'.:?; '.' W'i t:.o rer.'y. I started . , ? v Cliftoa Honae was the o'd mansion recently taken by Dr. Speneex,. « stranger to every one in Middlebury, Spencer was a tail, dark, rather dimiti gaished looking person, who bad h«n-j oat his siga in the village on\ y a few doors above minp, but as yet he had no practice. He was unsoci^e in the extreme, avoiding bis neighbors persis tently, and when he did speak It was in so curf, half savajje a way that no one wa« Hkelv to prolong tbe convers&Hon.; The doctor bad a wife, it was sRid. but no one bad ever seen her. She was an invalid, and Miss Melrose, a friend of tbe family, presided over the bousfe, and eat at the head of tbe table. Miss Melrose was very beautiful, and won tbe admiration of ail who visited Clifton House by her ease of manner and fas cinating conversation. * As ^re walk alone, let me explain to you jnsv what is necessary for yot* to know. My mistress ia very ill,' said my companion. *I beg your pardon — :s it Mrs , Spencer or Miss Melrose?' t '.. She laaehed bltierly. * Miss Metros? ! I wotrfd sfab her to the heart sooner than own her for a mistress. Mv mistress is s lady— nobl?, ro-f al, and of gentte birth. It M.. an honor to ser^e her. 'And is she ill ? How Ions: since ?' * 'Rrer since she married him — curse him !' phe muttered in a fiercer tone-; ' But I must not get excited. I nius^ tell my etorv. or rather hers. Two years ago, through the desire of her riving father, Alice Hendon became James Snencetrfl wife. Before that she was a bi-althv, blooming girl : immed iately after their marriage she beann to fail. Do vou see anything etrange in ' that?' *Not necessarily.' * Let me enlighten you farther. Doceor Spencer was at one time en gaged to Miss Lucille Melro?e, but he broke the engagement, and married my mistress instead. Miss Melrose was as poor 88 Jobr8 turkey. Mt«5S ffendon was an heiress, and Doctor Spencer was deeply in debt and hard preRsed by hid creditors. Do you see anything strange in that?' ' Perhaps so. Go on.' * When ray mistress married Spencer she was only seventeen, and had been taught to obey her father in evervtbing. She was a gentle, affectionate child. «nd it would have been easy for Spencer ? to have won ber lovp. But he did not care for that. It paid bis debt and and bought him fast horses ; it set bis table with nice and costly dishes, and put it in his power to keep Miss Melrose roHed like a a -queen. And all this time my mistress has been slowly hut surely sinking, and look you, Doctor Lockwood, I think she is not dying of disease, but of — sbe lowered her voice to a whiaper as she spoke the word ' poison!' ' Impossible ! This is a grave charge.* * Of poison given her by her husband, who, at her death will ha^e tbe sole control of her property and be free to marry Miss Melrose, There is no time to explain the details of the thousand Btki circumstarjees whSeh have led ma to believe it, for ive are almo«t at th« door. It is never the ease that Mi-=s Melrose and Spencer are out of the houBe at the same time, or I shou'd have called a physician before ; but to-night they are both called away by the death of Miss Melrose's sister, and will not be back until to-morrow. With the con sent of ray mistress I came for you, and ob. Dr. Lockwood I pray you to sv--e her. I nursed ber when her mother died and left her a helpless infant ; atl ihrougb. her innocent youth sbe «ne like an own child to me ; nnd now to see her fading hourly before my ey^a ! Great Haavan ! If I know beyond a doubt that he was guilty, his life should pay the penalty. I was already beginning to fael a Aaan intBrART in \Tt'R Sncnftpr nlttinncrVi I had never seen her, and like her own nurse I was beginning to feel a deep animosity for Doctor Spencer. Mrs, Spencer received me in her bed chamber. It was on the second floor, and was furnished with exquisite elegance. Everything in the room bespoke the refined taste of the occupant. The warm air was fragrant with the odor of heliotrope, and glancing around I saw the purple blo3soras and fraen leaves in an alabaster va.se oa the edge of the south window. She was a woman who, once seen, could never be forgottsn. I have met in my life many a beautiful woman, but never one so lovelv. She was tail and straight, with a purely oral face, liquid brown ey«s, and a dash of bectie in ber cheek which is not seen in health. She received me gracefully, as I knew she did every one, and though there was a slight embarrassment in her manner when I spoke of her tlluess, she answered my professional inquiries without hesitation. As for myself, I laid aside pII false delicacy end questioned her plainly as to her sympforap. Mrs. Hurd, the nurset remained in the 1 room, and added mauy iini)o;tant items of information. When she spoke of ber husband it was with a sort of hopeless sndnes? which distressed , me greatly. Kot s breath of suspicion against him was in h^r answers to ra? questions, and I felt sure that at present sba knew nothing of such serious apprehensions. I was glad it w?.s so. for, with her finely etrunjj organisation it might nave proaucea f-enou=; resuiis. 1 tiiaai? my examination of tha patient as closely as I csuld, ar.d drew my own ? conclusions. I could have sworn th;:t Mrs. Spencer daiiv sallowed arsenic in small quantities, and tiift ««atlly druE? was tilling- on her constitution. She said, answering mv qiiosiions, that she had no physician exee t her husband. He thought hiin*e'.f b?tier acquainted with her ei^?, and therefore ? better qualified to treat her, He never left raertieine for her to taks ; he always brought it f.-orn his office acd adminisTrx?;! it promptly. There vrss lilt'o, I 0 .vM no in pvjch ? Ciso. Asxious to i') v\ S'-v'.uingj ths I rerv cirenmstances of tbe aff-tir left me- |H -nearly powerless. A. cborge of «uch Wm 'nature, of course I could not m»k» ^1 agMinst D-cor Spencer without the |H proof- If I hinted a suspicion every- §? one would oet it do.vn to my pro- W3A fe^sional prejudice ; and if I could not Wm substantiate uiy statement the doetoi ^1 coul i make rac pay dearly for such a Wm slander uttered against him. t^B The only dependence seemed to be in :|m Mis. Hurd. To her I unbosomed Wm mysftif freely. I tcW her wi-hout $gk reserve that I thought Doctor Speucpr '^m was killiiiif his wife bv slow poison, ani III I bethought her to constantly wet.:h to ||M save the viciim, and discover some ^H proof bv whieb we could fasten tbe guilt ||fl on her hnsbon^. F^H She smiled grimly and promised |^B obedience, and 1 gave her s powerful |||1 itntido'e for the poison I saspecled, and) 'f*m went home pertnrbed and anxious ia S^9 mind, I did not sleep that Bight, and || I all the next day I was in a high fete M 1 of excitement, A ring at the bell mad §| 1 me tremble — ?* step on the gravev 'M I outside nsy office stopped my breath, M I and I hardly knew wliul I expected to MM hear. I felt sure thai. I should hear ff|l something before I slept. ^fl And now I must tell the story as it y|l was told to mo. i|| Doctor Spencer returned home (be ^j morning after my visit to the Clifton Sva House. lie looked wretchedly, the ||| nurse said ; appeared gloomy and de MM pressed. Miss Melrose came with him |S and looked decorously sad over the lf§| death of her sister, Women of he |Mj stamp slwavs do mourn to perfection WM They neither overdo nor underdo the |||| thing as women of feeling are likely t» l||§ do. ^ Doctor Spencer came at once to his -..;S| wife's chamber. He thought Bhe looked ||f| ill, and prescribed a cordial at oace, ;|p saying he would go and fetch it. |^| ' You ate always ordering cordials for i||j her,1 said Mas. Hnrd, musingly. * Why S||| not take something yourself? Ton look ;':.;V like a ghost I' J|g Doctor Spencer eyed her keenly, but t^. replied eotn,iose(lly : |4ff ? I think I wilt take some of the cor- y^;, dial myself, for I do not feel quite well. -r£ A ice dear, shall bring it here and -^S; drink your health? \ :£t M s. Spencer smiled sadly in assent :;:^ ? she never disputed her husband— f!:;|| and he went out. Presently be re* p^: turned with two glasses. Both coo- ? $ tained liquour colorless and odorless. ^% Mrs. Ilurd was watching him with hit y^ heart in ber throat, for she told me that V:;4| she felt the decisive moment bad come. | ^| There was something in the grey pallor ^ of the doctor's rigid fece that told her of U ':*& a detperafe purpose in tbe man's sou!« | ::^ He lifted tbe jlass to the right of thf Pf* tray and gawe it to his wife. |- ? ,'-| « Drink it, dear/ be said, * It's a f ^ panacea for all evils. I am alto going. ;;,,;?; to take a f^ass of it,' and he pointed Kb \ .;,;- the class sti'l oa the tray. r ^ Mrs. Spencer aceept«3, and waa j ?' '% patting it to her lips when Mra. Hurd , iuterropted, ' If you will bring her a tumbler of I- ? water, doctor. Mrs. Speoeer eomplaina that the cordial leaves a bid taste in ber : . roootli, and my old bones are eo full of ; rcbumatism that it nearly kills me to .' go down stairs. ? '-. The doctor turned and bent on her a : look as though he meant to read her through. Bat sbe kept her face passive. : : If he had any suspicions her manner ' quieted them, and puttbg down the b1b8s he left the room. Then Mra. llord changed the position of glume*. ; When be cume back— and he waa gone but a moment — the nurse stood ?- exaclv where be had left ber, and Mn. - :: Spencer was lying hack in her chair [ with her eyes clo.«el. Again he lifted the glass this time it was the one intended for himself— and placed it at iho. U\m of hn wife. She swallowed (he coutcnis, drank a little of the water he brought her, and thauked . him in her sad, sweet war. * Now for my own cordial ' be ssidi with affected gaiety. *I indulge in soroetbtng stronger.' As he apoke he tossed off the mixtare. 1 It made me stone cold to tay finger's ends to see him do it,' siid M-s. Hurd relating the circumntance to me, * but as Heaven is my witness I felt no con science. I argued like this : * If it was simplv cordial, it would do no harm ? if it was poison, his blood would be upon his own sinful head.' He went to bed half an hour afterward complaining of fatigue. In the morn in; they found him dead I was called tn the post-mortem, examination, and we discovered in the etoinach of the de ceased a sufficient quantity of a deadly poison known tc modern science to kill halt a dozen men. My brother pbyaic ions agreed that *be m«n was insane, and had probably taken the dose in one of bis nnsettled fits of mind. I did not dispute them, but, even before Mrs. Hurd told her story, I bad my own theory as to the cau~~e of his death. There was no public exposure, however. Mra. nurd and I agreed that it would profit no one to make the wretched, nffair public, and so we kept our own counsel. Miss Mtlrose, in spite of my con viction that she had an active part in the conspiracy against Mrs. Spencer's life, I could not help pitying. Such a iniBPrable, worn and haggard face as hers I have never seen, and when tbey had buried Doctor Spencer she was confined to her bed with brain fever. I attended her illness*, but, though she recovered in hfsltb, she was never herself again. She was a harmleog maniac, wjioHB denial vis in aecoraung the doctors grave -with flowers, Sbe )iv'n-? .-;tiM, srj'l still gath-T-* flowers and layn thorn on that grarp, eiiging to ber s»lf a low incantation, which no one ever pretencta to understand. N--t unti Mr*. Spencer hid msnv days Iwvjn mv wife, and the f .ithfat' Mr«. Hu.'d slept under the violets, did Alice know the perfidy of her fonder husband. When I told her, af;er the first sbre'e vvkr over, she crept in«o mv arms aud whispered : , ' Rnt if it had not ben for James* crime I should not have found you, Herbert. So good sometimes comes cut of evil.'
