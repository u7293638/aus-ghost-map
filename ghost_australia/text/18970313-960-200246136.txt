.GRANNV'S /GHOST. It was in Milltown, (his hittnted house of which 1 write, arid, as is usual in such oases, tbe: occiipatits wuro ili nt ohs. It was annoying, to say the least, to hoar that ghostly rocking, rocking to Arid tro in midnight hours, whori tho slightest sound assumed startling proportions.. ; bquiro blkiua bad nought Ibe place at a bargain— or »o it seemed ; but if he had kiiown it was bauuted he would not liavo taken it at any price... Not that ho was nervous or believed in ghosts ; but it was "douccdly uncomfort able," He said, to be roused from slumber half a dozen, times iu a night with Ihe information; that somebody wis rocking tho big armchair." 44 Well, let 'era rock,"ie growled. 14 I don't wont to." 44 Yes ; but Harvey, whit is it ? " ' 44 1 don't know arid don't care. Go to sleep, Sarah." And Farah tried — perhaps she succeeded ; but wbeu that mysterious rocking began again the scene wis. repented, uritifcin desperation the squire would go to tho largo apartment which answered for liilchtm and dining-room, It was very comfortable there. A big rocking-chair occupied the cozy corner tatweun tho hearth and tho, pantry door. Upun a amnH stand were tho evening papers nnd n lamp. Just opposite was Sarah's lew chair, in whic h she waB wont to rock and bnit, But why the rocking should continue after th'1 occupants of thu chairs were in bed was a matter that puzzled aud alarmed her. Only lately had she heard the Bound, hut she was sure her ear did not deceive hur. The squire did uot toll her upon hia return from tho investigating tours which sbo forced bim to msko (hut thn big chair was swaying , hack and forth as if recently vHfwtfd, 44 Some natural cause for it ; but I'll he eonfoiu.dud if I see just what." fir muttered, then unbiuklimcly declared to his wife that not a thing was rtirring, not even a mouse. Whin sbn hrgan to talk of ghosts he ridi culed the nl< n, yot wc-ndered thn whilo why the plana wis sold so cheaply. To he suro the house wns somewhat cut of repair but paint and platJ.t-r would soon remedy tb«t ; tho laud was good and well located ; if Ihsro should bo such a thing a a hounn being haunted, that would account. 44 Hut, pshaw ! there am no ghosts," lie mentally u.relaiincd ; and lie dis atirscd tho matter from his mind and hlept tho sleep of the ju.-t Nut so poor Fur«h.
