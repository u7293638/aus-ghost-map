CATHIE'S CORONACH. A LAMENT OVER THE DEMISE OF HIS REPUTATION. (Kindly lent for the purpose, by the Ghost of Lord Ronald.) For him the fleeting forms of earth decay, And beer and wine the strength of men impair, And spirits hasten on the fatal day; While heartless he, but with a craftsman's care, Sees all his phantom train their gloomy work prepare." —Collins (improved), O hone a rie! O hone a rie! The pride of Ballarat is o'er Fallen in the Corner's stateliest tree Who can have faith in Cathie more? But slightly sprung with eau-de-vie, He still could draw the lengthy bow, Firm was the hand that oft had laid, Both friendly mate and foeman low. Well can the Grenville widows tell, How far adown the long Main Road The noisiest digger's voice was quelled, Whenever Cathie walked abroad. For he, 'twas said, in mystic mood, High converse with grim death would hold, And oft prepared the fated shroud, That should the future corpse enfold. And so it fell, that on a day, For drunken men and women's sake, Our Cathie took his toilsome way, To Learmonth's melancholy lake. Cheered by the strength of Adam's well (And whiskey—as we said before), Our friend forgot the truth to tell— In truth, he voted it a bore. He drew from that exhaustless tap, His brilliant and inventive mind, A picture of a drunken chap So tipsy, he was all but blind. Not one alone. It made him sick, To think how many men he knew, Could say but "Mr. Speaker—(hic)." Alas, that this should be untrue. * * * * * Woe to the sullen Yarrowee, And woe to Learmonth's dreary glen, There never Legislative wight Shall draw the lengthy bow again. And we behind our Cathie's shield, No more in confidence can dwell, None leads the people to the field-- He but misleads them to the well. O hone a rie! O hone a rie! The pride of Ballaarat is o'er, Fallen is the Corner's stateliest tree, Who can believe in Cathie more?
