THE BEECHES SCANDAL. Fbom the San Fflncisco Examiner the fol lowing is taken:— 'Nothing could beinore wide of the mark than the idea entertained , in some <juarterb that the Plymouth Church scandal is to b* permitted to lie dormant and suffered to die from old age. As far bb the public is con* earned,. of course, lfth^ whole hideous thing could be (Timed in oblivion it were well ; and Beecher'e partisans might ? purtue, 4heir efforts to cover^np' t^e s|e}etop 'exorcise the ghost undisturbed. But, unfprtunatejy, 1 , the side-issues . of the case have 'served fto keep the bbdy~the '^Bsenlial '^feature-^ery much alive and kickiftg. uOnly a email percentage of the ' Congregational Churches respopded to the -eall fori an Advisory Coui cjl' pp the question of Mrs. Moultpn's status in j?lymojutb;. evidencing -that the movement was generally regarded as of no significance, and merelv intended to intensify the fog in which Plymouth Church has sought to .envelope its affairs; Whatever the result of the counciU it will be meaning less to the public. - -But a movement, of whjch Drs. Buddington and Storrs are said io lie at the bottom, is already afloat, to re- inveBtigate the whole case, as between Beecherand the Tilton family by. a general couclave of' the _ Congregational Churches, and the' anxiety of Plymouth to escape going to the foundation of the matter will avail nothing. ' The Church having declined BoWen's offer to eiibmit his testimony to a . Committee of prominent Congregationalists, ;in order to. pvooid publicity, 4 he. fwill, no i doubt/ be prepared to go before the Eccle- 'siastical Council and tell, -he:^ knows} rthen, it is predicted, .the. case will have a very different. conclusipn. from that of the trial in court—^and. inde^d, any conclusion which shall flecure the public against further annoyance concerning the scandal must be devoutly wished for.
