ipoctn?. | Conscience and Futnre Judgment. BiOnlBLKa W. BTPBD3. . X Bat alone with my ooneoienoo, In a plaeo where time had ceased, And wo talked ot my former hying In the land whero (ho years increased. And I felt l should havo to answer Tho question it put to me, And to face tha answer. and qacBtion Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotten notions Game floating.jbefore my sight, And things that I thought wero- dead things ?; Wera alive with a.terrible might. And the vision ol all my past lifo Was an awful thing to faco, . ? Alone with my ooneoienco pitting In that solemnly silent place. And I tbonght of a far away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future, But now is tbe present time. And I thought of my former thinking Ot the judgment day to bo, But sitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment enougb-for mo. And I wondered if there was a future . ~ To this land beyond tho grave ; But no one gave me an answer, And no one camo to save* Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by, For it wqb but the'tbonght ot my paetlifo Grown into eternity. , Then I woke from ray timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I knew tho far-away warning Had a warning of yesterdayâ€” And I pray I may not forget it In this land beforo the grave, That I may not ory in the future And no one oome to save. And so I havo learned a lesson Whioh I ought to havo known beforo, And whioh, though I learned in dreaming, I hope to forget no more. . So I sit alono with my conscience, In tho placowhero the years increase, And I try to remember the future In tho land whero timo will ccaso. And I know of tbo future judgment, How dreadful soe'er it bo, That to sit alone with my oonsoionoe Will be judgment enough for me.
