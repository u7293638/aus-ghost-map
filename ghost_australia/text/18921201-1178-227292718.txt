Buiiuumbef.t. — Agreeable Ceremony. —Shortly before tho Huddurt-Parker steam ship Burrumbeot reached Sydnoy from Mel bourne on lmr last trip her commander, Cap tain 1J. Lo Novoit was invited to moot tho pas songors in tho saloon. On making his appear ance tho popular commander was loudly ap plauded by tho ladies and gontlomen, who, to tho number of 30, weio seated at tables well supplied witli wino and fruit. Mr. P. W. Chapman occupied tho chair, and, having invited tho guest to a seat, informed liiin in a neat speech that iiis follow- voyngcrs had deputod him to express their deep senso of tiio kindness and considera tion which had been so liberally shown them while aboard. Indeed, it was difficult, ho said, to understand how so many acts of good- naturod attention could bo worked off in such a short poriod ; and it aeeinod as though tho officials had been always looking for someone to oblige. All present, Mr. Chapman added, knew how much of this was duo to tho jovial skipper, who had shown himself to bo tho embodiment of kindness and pleasantry. Ho assured tho captain of tho gonuino esteem of tlioso present, and called upon tho pas sengers to drink " Health and Prospority to Captain P. Le Novou.'' Thocaptniu, in respond ing, thanked tho passengers heartily for tho honor paid him, and said that though tho Burrmnbeet was not a flyer, as flyers aro of tho present day, what .slio did lack in speed tliey endeavored to mnko up by nttontion, cleanliness and sociability. Tito praiao bo- stowed by tho passengers, lie said, reflected credit on tiio owners, and also tho provcdorc. Several other toasts, including "Tho Ladios" and "Tho Officers," wore then honored, and tho gathering broko up with "Auld LangSyno." Coal for Valparaiso.— Tho ship Republic is expected to auil to-day for Valparaiso with 1200 tons of coal and 570 tons of shale. Coal for Honolulu. — The barquo Lady Lampson is to sail to-day for Honolulu with 600 tons of coal.

Tho Tarawera loft Auckland for Sydnoy on Tuosday, and is duo hero on Saturday night or early on Sun day. Tito Hauroto left Wellington yesterday afternoon, and is duo bore on Monday. Tho Flora is to leave Hobart for Sydney on Satur day. Tiib Huddaiit-Parker Fleet.— Tho Tas mania, from Hobart, is duo in Sydney to-night; tho Burrumbeot will leavo Sydney for Mol- bourno to-morrow; tho Elingamito will leavo Molbourne at noon to-morrow, and is duo in Sydnoy on Sunday ; tho Tambo is duo on Saturday from Launceston and ports, nnd will return tliero on December 7. Tho Tasmania will shortly undergo a goncral overhaul prior to opening tho Tasmonian excursion season. Mararoa for New Zealand.— Tho depar ture of tiio Union Co.'s magnificent express 2500-ton liner Mararoa, from tho Margaret- street pior, for Wellington, was tho occasion of as much onthuaiiism as is usually displayed in connection witli tho departure of tho mail steamships for tho old country. Tho vessel was announced to sail at 5 o'clock, but on nccount of tho difficulty of clearing away tho shore visitors it was 5,45 before she bad her head down harbor, and had way on. Tho vessel was in splendid trim and looked as bright mid natty as a toy ship just out of its box. That tho Mararoa is no plaything lias been shown ovor nnd over again, and more particularly on her last few runs, when her speed was 15 knots between somoNew Zealand ports on short and difficult runs, and 16 knots nnd a little more whoro she could ho opened out. Her passenger-list Inst evening cum prised 170, being 110 in tho saloon and 60 in tho second cabin, this latter com partment boing in many respects superior to tho saloon accommodation of steamships bf a few years ago. Tho Mararoa may be expected to roaeli Wollington at daylight on Sunday. New Steamship Waiuu. moo. —Tlio steam ship Warrimoo, tho pioneer of tho Now Zea land and Australasian Co.'s lino of inter colonial express pussi-ngor steamships, is to leavo tho Huddart-Pnrkcr wharf next week on her third voyago to New Zealand. Sho will go by way of Molbourno and Hobart, thenoo across to tho Bluff, up the East coast, calling at all ports, and finally leaving Auck land for Sydnoy, thus making tho round of Australasia and calling at all tho ports which possess tho most interest for excursionists. The magnificent steamship, which shows a gross tonnage of 3330 tons, and a deadweight capacity of 5000 tons, is already becoming highly popular on account of her palatial accommodation, Bpeed and steadiness in a sea way. Tho vessel has not yet attained her full sea-going speed ,011 account of not having been docked sineo her launch, but she will start her prusont voyage in the perfection of trim, in which sho was plnced wliilo in Mort's dry dock. It is confidently anticipated that on thu round trip on which uhe will enter next week sho will attain elosu on hor trial trip speed of 17 knots, and her work will, therefore, ho watched with interest. Lund Liner Waiirnamrool— Presenta tion Flag. — Tho new steamship Warrnam- bool, of tho Lund Blue Anchor line, under tho command of Captain ,T. E. Ilbery, the commo dore of tho Heet, which sailed from Sydnoy on Sunday for tho London January wool sales, arrived in Hobson's Bay on Tuesday after a smart passage. Tlio Augur thus refers to tho fine Bteamship: — "Tho Warrnnmbool has been docked nnd thoroughly cleaned and painted, so that hor fine proportions aro aeon to tho best advantage, and sho looks more like a vessel intended for tho highest class of passenger traffic than a cargo- carrier first and n passenger steamer after wards. Her cabin and saloon accommodation, however, where luxurious provision lias been made for travellers, will bo well patronised on the voyage to London, most of tlio berths having been already secured. Tho Warrnnm bool lias brought round from Sydney in transit 1500 bales of wool, 200 casks of tallow, and a quantity of sundries. Sho will take altogether from Australian ports about 14,000 bales of woo!. Tho steamer has beeu berthed at tho Breakwater Pier, Williamstown, where a pleasing littlo cere mony will take placo on Thursday afternoon. Tho peoplo of Warrnanibool aro so apprecia tive of tiio compliniont paid to their town by tlio ownors, who havo named their newest and linest vessel aftor tho capital of the Western district, that tlio Indies of Wnrrnambool havo inndo a white silk houso flag for tho steamer with tlio blue anchor, tho emblem of tho line, worked upon it. This is to bo formally pre sented to Captain Ilbery by Mr. Murray. M.L.A., tho member for Wnrrnambool, and a number of visitors have beon invited to assist at tho ooremony. North German Lloyd and the Austra lian Trade. — Tho fine steamship Karlsruhe, on her third visit to Australia, left Sydney yestorday for Bremen, via Melbourno and ports. Tlio handsome vessel was inspected by a great number of visitors duriug her stay at tlio Circular Quay, nnd tho praises wore warmly tendered as to the palatial accommo dation provided for passengers and tlio solidity and graceful eliaractor of tlio fittings and furnishings. Captain J. Kossler was congratulated by his Gorman friends on tho energy of tho company in placing such a magnificent steamship in tho Australian trade. There was a large number of people at the Circular Quay to see hor off, ana n great deal of enthusiasm was shown as she steamed away amid the inspiriting strains of her oxcollent brass band, cheers, waving of handkercliiofB and dipping of flags. The vessel took away a valuablo ca-go, tiio principal item in which was 4258 bales of wool. Tho sister ship to tlio Karlsruhe, tho Nurnberg, loft Colombo on Sunday, and is duo at Adelaide about December 11 or 12\. Tho North-German Llcyd at head quarters, and thoir general managor in Aus tralia (Mr. J. Mergell), are sparing no pains to make tho Australian trade successful and popular. A fow days ago tho particulars wore given of tlio now 700l)-ton twin-screw steam ship for tho Austialian line, the order for tho construction of which has been given to Scliichau, tho celebrated to:pedo-boat builders. Tlio dimensions of tlio vessel are :— Length, 465ft. ; beam 51ft.; depth, 33ft. She is therefore 5ft. longer than tho Kaiser Wilhelm IT., and is expected to bo a speedier boat, while she will be a good carrier. Tho company havo just secured another magni ficent steamship ready built to their hand, which it is anticipated will early next year bo despatched to Sydney, via ports, as one of tiio mail liners. Tho history of thi3 vessel in brief is that tlio steamships General Werder and Hormann have been exchanged for a twin-screw steam ship of 6750 gross tonnage, just launched by Sir William Armstrong, Mitchell and Co., nnd now boing fitted with her triple-expansion machinery. Tho new vessel is 435ft. long, 48ft. beam, and 32ft. deep. Sho will have a speed of 14 knots at aoa. Hor accommodation is equal to 50 saloon, and when required 1750 in the 'tween decks.
