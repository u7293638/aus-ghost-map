Christ Himself says in St. John xiv. 6., "I am the Way, the Truth and Life ; no man cometh unto the Father but by Me.â€” (Douay) Now is it not plain ,from Christ's own words, that it is useless to invoke the Virgin or any other saint for blessings ? St. Paul says, 1st Timothy ii. 5-6., for there is ono God, and ono Mediator of God and mon, the Man Christ Jesus, Who gave Himself a Re demption for all. Also first epistle of John ii., 1. 2. "But if any man sin, we have an advo cate with the Father Jesus Christ the Just. And He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only,, but also for those of the whole world." Also St. John, xiv 13 14., "Whatso ever you shall ask tlio Father in My name that will I do." Here wo have a distinct promise from Christ that iE we ask anything in His nartie,; (in faith) He will grant our request. But the. Church of llomo would have us to bast aside the proriiises of Christ; and seek help where it cannot bo found. For, as the Scripture says, there is no othor name under heayeri whereby wo can be saved, but through. Christ alone, and according to the word of God He is the only Mediator and- the only propitiation between God and - men. If you will, permit, me, I will, on a future occasion notice, the anti- scriptural doctrine of Purgatory. Yours truly subscriber, :
