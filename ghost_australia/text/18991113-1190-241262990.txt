THE GOSPEL OF IMPERIALISM. "THE HOLY GHOST ODDS." The latest "sect" In the United States calls itself "The Holy Ghost and Us So ciety." The founder is the Rev. Frank W. Sandford, whose doctrine Is Imperial- Ism before everything else. He puts an Anglo-American alliance even before the Gospel. He declares that It Is distinctly prophesied In the Bible that the English and the Americans together will rule the world after conquering ail other countries which they will do in one long, bloody war. Next to Imperialism. Sandford places prayer, teaching that there Is no r-lraele that cannot be accomplished through an appeal ;o Heaven by the holy. Iu tho temple there are always twelve men at prayer. There are 1600 students, male and female, at the institution being instructed in the new faith.â€”' "Cape Argus."
