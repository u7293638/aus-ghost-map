Tho lovors of -fistic sports in San Francisoo : are disgusted at sooing boxers enter tho ring inthosamo condition as if they wero about to competa for a fat man's race. Indoed, tho same might be said to apply to not a few instances ia Sydnoy A boxing oontoat is in a I great measure to do juupfeu oy mo condition in whioh the principals appear whon they outer the ring. If their form is poor it noeu not bo oxpeoted that the exhibition will be of muoh account. Tho sporting fratornity in this city1 aro.'not slow in detecting the system adopted by some professional boxers when supposed to be training for a fight, and onoe a pugilist plays his game on tho patrons of boxing he might as well retire, for its transparency is too pal pable.

Hanlan might win one day, Teemer the next, and myself tho day after. Hanlan is a great man in spite of his re oent defeats. I think Hamm aan beat any one in the seoond division. He is as fast as a ghost and can stay, toD. As rogards Komp, tho new world's champion, lie is as fast as a bullet, but he cannot stay. Still, he is as big a man as Beach, and if made fit wonld come near being mado first-class. The lato reoord breaking iH duo, in my opinion, to tho fact that tho rigging of tho boats is better and that the men thomsolves are better oarsmen. Tho mon havo bocome moro skilled in tho uso of tho difforont apparatus. For years Hanlan hid a walk ovor simply becauso ho had reduced tho uso of the appliances at hand to a scionco. When the otheroaramen mastered them Hanlan com menced to lose onco in a while.'
