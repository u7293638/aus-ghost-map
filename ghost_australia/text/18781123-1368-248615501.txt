JOSH BILLINGS ON BIRDS. THE QUAIL. THE quail iz a game bird, about oue size bigger thau the robin, and so sudden that they hum when they fly. Th*y have no song, but whistle for music, tlie tune is solitary and sad. They are short on the wing, and a man may be good in arithmetic, fustrate at parsing, aud even be able to preach acceptably, but if he ain't studied quail on tho wing he might as well-shoot at a Btrcak of lightning in the- sky as at a quail on the go. Briled quail, properly supported with jelleys and a Champagne Charlie, iz just Ihe most difficult thing, in my humble opinion, tew bent in , the whole history ov vittles and something to drink. I am no gourmand, for I kan eat bread and milk five days out of seven, and smack my lips after I get thru, but if I am asked to eat«briled quail by a friend, with judishous accompany meat, I blush at fust, then bow my head, and then smile sweet acquiescence — In other wordB I always quail before such a request. TEE PARTRIDGE. The partridge iz also a gome bird- Their game iz tew drum on a log in the spring ov the year and keep ! both eyes wide open,, watching the sportsman. Partridges are shot on the wing, and -are as easy to miss az a- ghost iz. It is pliun enutf tew see the old bird hide her young brood when danger is rear. This must be seen, it can't be described and make ennybody believe it. The partridge, grouse, and pheasant are cousins, and either of them straddles a gridiron natural enough to have been born there. Take a couple of young partridges and put them down, and serve them up with a hind of chorus," and they beat the ham sandwiches y$u buy on the Camden niid Amboy Rood 87£ per cent. I have eat these lamentable New Jersey ham^audwiches, and '"pinst sny that' I prefer a couple of ba.^swood chips, soaked in mustard water,-.and stuck together with Spaulding's gliie^
