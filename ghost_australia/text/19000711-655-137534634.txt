I A 8PE0TEE HAND. The ghosts whioh are said to frequent the preeincts of Hampton Court Palace are more or leas known by reputation, but their raiublings have been pro miscuous and uncertain. Great interest in tboir roovemeuts has, however, been „o«,l« omiisod 1,t tho sLrunf-s exDPrience undergone by an artist who, during the past week, has been visiting certain moral of the palace for the purpose of sketching the old Flonniah tapestry on the walls. Whilst engaged in the Guard Watching Chamber in broad daylight — for the 100m is closed to the publio at 6 o'clock — this gentleman, Mr. Haynes, of Surbiton, positively asserts that a spectre hand, white and delicate, and 1 ichly jewelled, has persistant ly intru ded between hiin aud the taprs'ry. At first heimagined the disturbing element must be one of the many hands so beautifully inscribed on the tapestry, but the limb, he says, moved slowly from one stage to another, and pointed downwards. Mr. Haynes was much agitated, and told several friends of this curious visitation. They not unnatur ally-, perhaps, advised him to dismiss the subject from his mind, and return to the chamber and his work. But the hand re-appeared before his startled eyes ; and on the last appearance of the phantom the aitist made a hurried sketch of the outstrotched hand, the rough outline of which depicts a bril liant marquise ring on the foro finger. Tho eflect of these continued visits of the supernatural on Mr. Haynes is very visible ; he is unnerved, and he has bus pended his skatohing. These are the plain facts, but there is, it would a weird and historic conneeticn between this hand and the hsnd of the Queen Catherine Howard, one of the wives of King Henry VIII. — ' Pnblic Opin ion.'
