' Someoiody'ids pouring brandy doivn' her throat, raising, her' up,'speaking 'to her, ' chiling her cold hands. " Who are you? " she said, feebly. "I thought that I was dead." "I, am the messenger," was the ansiwer, after she had sufliciently ro 'covered 'to sit'up. "I 'followed you oti''the last'iiglit'"on Which "you came here' because I 'adinired your condudt so much, and I tliotiglit'thlat I would 'see you' ?safe 'on such a wild night. The second 'tiine---when you returned ,with the paller-I 'thought that youi looked unfit for your hard task, and I wished.to follow and be near you. iI saw you disappear. I waited for hours, 'but'you'nover retidined,' and I deter mined to come back to-night and find out whether any accident had hap. pened you. I had long suspected tliohe existence of a secret room, and when 'I watched you ' difappear behind tlio ibuttress, ny suspicions were still moto strongly roused. Last night the secret was i'onfided to me, and I went to tile castle,, and, finding that you had not b'een' miesed, 'I did 'not rest till I hadd made sui'o of'the clue, and discoverdd you lere. Are you strong enough to hear bad news?" ' 'The 'laird is dead?" she said. ?Yes," 'ansiwered the messenger, sadly; "he was killed in a terrible battle which was fought yesterday. It was' on 'account of the confusion and distress occasioned' at the castle by his death that .you were not missed before." TlIere was a long silence, and then I-Ileh left' thb secret chamber never to re-enter it. Her solitary midnight expeditions' wero over, for before his deatli the laird had entrusted ilho secret to liis faithful friend, .tlhe messenger, a young soldier of much promise. SThe laird's sister soon found coi. solation in matrimony, and left Scot land for ever. As to Helen, I cannot tell you much about her. Ihave heard it said that she and the messenger kept the secret together, and that she mar. ried him not very long after the dlopar. turo of the laird's sister, but of that I cannot rightly speak. The story coded, as it had begun, dreamily andt suddenly. The fire was out. VWe groped our way out of the room into the dark garden, and there parted-very quietly and bilently. IThe person ' who had told the story said something more bufl'oro thie meeting broke up, but only those fow wordst "''The story is true: I can vouch fir it on very good authority."
