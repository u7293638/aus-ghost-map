A SHILLING SHOCKER. Tʜᴇ Daily Telegraph has got hold of the making of a ﬁrst‐class “shilling shocker.” At Penrith human bones were found by the police while searching for a reported ghost. It appears that a foul deed had been committed, and the guilty one attempted to bury his victim, but, not having proper tools, tried cremation. A hole, started for the grave, was found near the remains and close to the spot where the vision was reported to have been seen. There now! who has the hardihood to disbelieve in ghosts after that? Why need an author sit down and rack his brains when he has all the materials ready made for him? Cʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ Ⅰ. Tʜᴇ murder in the bush. My old mate. I want your gold. Never. It is mine. I mined for it, and it shall never leave me till it is sent to my wife and children. Cʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ Ⅱ. Tʜᴇ Struggle. Life or death. Death. The robbery. “What shall I do with the body?” Ah! I have it—cremation! Heavens! the body will not burn. Why is this? My crime haunts me. I will bury the horrible thing. I have no tools. I will dig the grave with my hands. I cannot. What shall I do? Ah! the ghost of my old mate. Cʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ Ⅲ. Tʜᴇ police station. A1 seated. “Who’s there, be jabers, I’m looking at yez now, I knows yez, yez larrikins. Thunder and turf, what’s this—a ghost! It beckons me. Wait a moment till I get me helmet and truncheon. Go, and I’ll follow thee. Going to Penrith, eh? All right. Cʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ Ⅳ. “Sᴜʀᴇ, Mr. Ghost, it’s a nice dance ye’ve led me. What the devil are yez pointing at. Bones, as I’m alive! Murder! and the divil has tried to burn the karpse, and then bury it. But, me foine ghost, who killed yez? Be jabers, he’s gone. We must ﬁnd that out ourselves I shall take these bones in my helmet down to the inspector, and if we can’t catch this fellow it’ll be a rum start.” Cʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ Ⅴ. Tʜᴇ history of this chapter is not yet made. We are waiting to hear how the ghost ﬁnished the business.
