D. , Bishop of Ballarat "We, the Vicar General and clergy of the diocese of Melbourne, desire on the occasion of your first visit to Melbourne since your installation, to offer you our heartfelt congratulations upon your safe arrival in the colony, and to express the satisfaction with which we see amongst us, at last, a bishop of Ballarat That those congratulations are made now, instead of having been addressed to you on your landing, has not arisen from any want of forwardness on our part to bid you welcome, but rather from our respect for the natural desire of our brethren of Ballarat to be the earliest to give you a public reception We could have wished that our own bishop had been with us to day, to see the result of his many labours and prayers, but his very absence will to you who know why his voyage home was undertaken, and what it has involved, by the strongest assurance of the deep interest which he feels in the 6ul ject of our present rejoicings It is indeed with unfeigned joy that, having had so good experience ourselves for so many ears of the value of a learned and godly bishop to his clergy and people we now bail the increase of the Victorian episcopate in your person, and the prospect afforded to the large and important district over which you are called to preside, of enjoying that close and constant over- sight which its necessities demand We regard with pleasure the preservation of the unity of the Victorian Church, in the division of the Diocese of Melbourne by the constitution of a province in Victoria, and would express our sincere hope that not only all the free intercourse and friendly inter- change of duties that have hitherto subsisted between the clergy of Ballarat and Melbourne may continue undisturbed but that a new bond of union and source of strength to the church in this colony will be found in the meetings of the bishops clergy and laity, of the two dioceses in a prov line assembly We are in the interests, of our own diocese unaffectedly glad of your arrival not only for the permanent relief to our dioceSan by the abridgement of his immense labours but especially now in the absence and expected resignation of our bishop, for the comfort of knowing that we are no longer without a bishop of our own church in the colony, at whose hands we may look for needful ministrations, when opportunity permits of his spiritual office W trust, however, that we may be allowed to welcome you not only for your office, but for yourself We are no strangers to the zeal and diligence with which you have done your Master's work on the parish which you have recently left, not to the re- grets from rich and poor among your parishioners which followed you on your departure for those regrets we can promise you the sincere sympathy and affectionate regard of all classes of churchmen in the land of your adoption, for that work of the past, work in the future, in building up the church for Christ, which forarduousness and importance may well satisfy the pious aspira- tions of the most devoted servant of the Lord, that God may give you grace long to live, happy and honoured in the fulfilment of your sacred ministry and that the church committed to your charge may, by your wise and faithful ordering continually walk in love, and be edified, is our earnest prayer to Almighty God for our brethren of the diocese of Ballarat, and for you, their first bishop ' (Loud applause ) The Bishop replied as follows -My Dear Vicar General! and my Reverend Brethren Clergy of this Diocese Your congratulations and your cordial expressions of regard and goodwill, are most gratifying to me, and I cannot sufficiently thank you for all your brotherly attention When I entered the Heads only three weeks ago, I believed that I was personally unknown to anyone in the colony besides the Acting Governor, and thankful as I was in common with all on board to reach the shore again the prospect of landing as an utter stranger among strangers filled me with no small anxiety, not to say trepidation But nothing could exceed the kindness with which I was encountered the instant the ship reached the wharf at Sandridge, and it was evident at once that it had been the result of not a few of my fellow churchmen in Melbourne, both of the clergy and laity to do everything in their power, without regard to their own convenience, to make the strange brother forget his Btiangerbood, and to girdle him at once with friendly BJmpathicB and all the offices of Christian love I have said that nothing could exceed the, kindness which I met with the day of my landing, perhaps I ought to have added, except that which is finding its manifestation to night We had but little tempestuous weather at sea but since reach- ing shore we seem to have been beset with a perfect tornado of kindness, not only at my new home at Ballarat but also here in the mother diocese of Melbourne We seem, as far as Melbourne is concerned, to have reached the vortex or focus of the hurricane to night. I am afraid the ship will labour a good deal. I only trust she may not founded altogether under the too favourable winds she noa SO unexpectedly met with No doubt calmer weather will soon act in, when she will have time to make all fast, in view of the adverse breezes which, sooner or later, from one quarter or another, are doubtless inevitable. Dropping metaphor, I feel really overwhelmed, my brethren, by the cordial welcome you have given me I am sure I shall be right in attributing it in large measure to the respect with which the career of my revered friend, your own bishop has inspired you for the office which I unworthily share with him, and to your generous desire to receive with special cordiality any one coming here with his sanction and through his instalment (lilly. It will be well if I may hereafter, with the Lord's help, succeed in establishing any sort of claim to the kind things you say in your beautiful address Without at present touching upon any of the points referred to in it I beg you to believe that I received it with unfeigned gratitude and that I cordially join in you earnest desire and prayer that what has now, by God's blowing been accomplished may prove in its measure a means of sets forward that supreme and paramount object of the march s existence the honour of our blessed Master, in the eternal salvation c human souls Mr Hy Henty then read the following ac- dress from the laity - To tbeAight Rev Saml Thornton, D D Â»j? w Bishop of Ballarat AY of the undersigned lay members of the Church of England in the diocese of Mebourne desire to offer our congratulations of your arrival amongst us giving thank got God the Father of our Lord Jesus Chris that it has pleased Him to bring you in safety to these shores- We rejoice in the prospect of great additional strength being imparted to the action of the church in your diocese from tho'ntluenco of that energy ability and earnestness by which as a Christian minister in the mother country, you have been E highly dist anguished one we thank Almighty God that he first put it into your heart to her from all the attraction which England offer to men of mental and moral power, and t 8everthetioswhichattachedyoutoyonrnfttiv land in order to do the work of your Divm Master in a new country where the impression made on the eye va home you any hope of influence may be a prolonged from tener how to Sensation In tD\mg up the "room lately occupied by our own beloved bishop you find that it has been prepared for you b one whose personal character administrative ability and devotion to his Master service will be remembered with the warmest affection by all who know him and will be recognised hereafter so long Vi Victoria posse se;

held not only by those who regarded his office as of divine one's but by others who. considered it one of expediency or dis regarded it altogether He had been shown more his devotion to the well being of those whom be watched over than when he left them to seek for a Shep herd for one portion of his flock to which he was not able homage" to attend and he congratulated their brethren in the diocese of Ballarat in having within their limit3acen'roof spiritual activity winds went forth in the church of their fathers from a faithful bishop He could not doubt that the diocese of Mr bourne Would feel the benefit of this and he might mention otic immediate and direct 1 event which they would receive Their guest had already undertaken to order the candidates for the ministry in this town when the t me I lived for the proper fulfilment of that ordinance and he had likewise promises to confirm in the month of December in as many parts of the diocese isle could reach within the limits of the time at his disposal ( W please There was one thing peculiarly gratifying to him in the addresses their honoured guest had given to them They looked for piety devotedness wisdom and learning in the man chosen by their bishop and Sir William Stawell but they were not sure that one would come amongst them who would call this his adopted country too many came here to fulfil a duty for a few years and thou turn away but they rejoiced to hope that they bid one noble citizen added to their number who came to live and die amongst them ( \p plause ) They would notice that they did not call their guest My lord but addressed him as the Right Rev. the Bishop of Ballarat He was not glad of this for the honour done to those who presided over the church was one of the brightest jewels in the crown of their Sovereign It might be a question whether the title should not be continued of courtesy but the church claimed nothing but its rights and when the title in withdrawn she yielded and did not pretend to assume an honour which the state had not bestowed In conclusion be expressed his deep joy at seeing such on assembly gathered together for such a purpose (Applause ). The chorus 'The Heavens are telling from Haydn's ' Creation was then given by the united choirs and the people The Bishop who was received with great cheering then addressed the audience He said that although he had been three full weeks in Australia yet still he felt strong" upon him the Innocence and Experience of a new comer He had already perceived that he had much to learn and much to unlearn not indeed that he should forget the old fatherland for that were impossible (Cheers ). He wondered whether anyone ever left such friends behind as he had but in starting for Australia starting for his now adopted country he did so full of hope but that hope was based in part upon one fact of his experience Ever since the trouble came-ever since the feeling pointed to another hemisphere-he in terested himself to come in contact with Australians in England And he might say that his personal experience was that he never met with one Australian who spoke ill of his adorred lind (61 cora ) He know more of Australia note from his own personal knowledge, and though he had met with so many kindnesses already he had met with some difficulties arose and he might say that the arrangement of the part he should take in that evenings proceedings was not the least difficult enterprise (laughter) to preach without a text He had no topic for his address He was sure they would not wish him to launch upon that onions 1 emIn lam alia which translated for the ladies meant everything general and the Ministerial crisis in particular (Laughter ) No the business that brought him here and I lie Lords work itself to which he a IU solemnly set apart in the old Abbey know is no doubt to nearly every one among them For that purpose he had come and what he intended to say vatuld lo in reference to that work the great work of Christ at Church upon earth and they should not forget indeed that it was also the reason of their meet in g there to night Note there was a value in his impressions and value also in last lmprors.onrj and his last impress notes of old 1 inland from a religious point of NOW might therefore possess interest These were dangerous thy a religiously in England and he expected 1939 in Australia but although they were dangerous bia 1111 1 version was that they were eminently hope ful days There was no doubt about it that there was at this time in our old fatherland n merv pious impulse with regard to spiritual things and spiritual directions and there fine Lis topic to night was one which could not fail in interest. There was a warm interest transferring the whole mind of Lot Inn! 11 reference to directly spiritual topics Of course the religious phenomena of the old country were very painful if we looked at the dark side as he dared say wore found also in Australia There was the luxury of the great and the misery of the poor at home and there was the separation and alienation between class and the separation, too of many leading men of science from loyalty to the faith once delivered to the saints But there was a gracious compensation also for the ore was at this time in intensity far beyond anything that had been experienced for a very long time in the spiritual life of the mother country (Cheers ). This warmth of which he spoke was not the mere warmth of controversy though certainly there was plenty of that he was going to say, the were sick to death of it. That was a kind heat which did not illumine or comfo very much It seemed to him general] a kind of noxious gas, in which spiritual day velopments drooped and withered He spot of the warmth which was melting down t (separations and barriers between believer a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ's warmth which was smiting down with For unseen hand that barrier which men though at one time must be made of adamant at last for ever They had been learning England to try and overcome evil not much by fisticuffs with it if he could went to use the term as by diffusing the antagonistic truth as the- doctors met the smaller with vaccination How great and marvelled was it to see the difficulties which beset a ligion die and disappear grow faint and feeble, like distant things when we pressed into the nearer presence and compamonBh of God So the difficulties which beset of faith lost their power when individuals all churches got closer into the presence of God and were thus all drawn by that we act more closely towards each other (A plause ) it come to him that this was gracious countervailing on the part of of God to those dangers which at present seemed to beset Christ's teaching through the attitude taken by eminent physicist The intense and spiritual life was God contrary to that cinseitigUil as the German called it which characterised some model teaching where men were so deeply absorbed in physical effects and laws that they ignore the momentous phenomena of spiritual light It was that work which brought bishops here-not to sustain old world di] nities in another hemisphere but to work shoulder by shoulder among their friend (Cheers ) They would agree with him that the responsibility resting upon one who has come here in his position was very great and he thought he might claim at the hands that Christian sympathy and believing prayer which he longed for- (applause) esp cially os as had been wisely remarked in a kind address of the laity to him the work the Church of Christ at this particular case of the development of this marvellous color would tell tremendously on the future an reach into eternity itself He had ron: acres a a passage in the writings of the late Dr Arnold which startled him as he had never noticed it before That. Christian ma longed most ardently to come here to Australia and plant his wisdom in the Australia colonies feeling that as there had been already a marvellous past so there would b a momentous future (Cheers ) In comm 'into Port Phillip Bay the first thing li (the bishop) had seen wore the three masts of a sunken ship which might have been thought by some to be an omen of the Church of England (Laughter) They were those who believed that present on entrances were like the prophetic writing of the wall the men feel pests but he bel another view He regarded the difficulty through which their church was passing here to be only the prunings of the tree which made it put forth more vigorous life (Applause ). The next thing he had me coming up the bay was a newspaper telling them of the Ministerial CUBIS (Laughter That was not of course the only newspaper he had had to read since his arrival and he could only say the it was obvious the freedom of the press existed here in all its full entirety (r daughter ). This was clearly a land of ou spoken freedom and on that ground among others he rejoiced that he had come to a (Applause) He liked such a life as this He had been more or less accustomed to it the place which had been his home for 1 years past They were men who stated their minds freely and independently without fear or favour There was a brace atmosphere in such a condition which braced the nerves and when success was attained made that success more real He trusted that he had learnt. one thing in Birmingham which was not only to tolerate peoples opinions but to let them be welcome to them without resent the fact that their opinion s were different from his own (Applause ) They would not doubt the very shortly after his arrival the new bishop; found himself confronted with difficulties but difficulties were things to be surmounted just as the lion which Samson slew in the vineyard was a thing to be slain that none; might be got out of his carcase depend upon it difficulties like marrow bones were hard but the best meat was inside them (Laughter and applause ) Their good old church had al done flourished in difficulties and would continue to do SO Ly the difficulties which they had to encounter in this country and he was not disposed to say they were not great especially at present they would learn to en and and make more elastic then church system He would occupy them to fe mu used in conclusion by stating n: v I at we it seemed to Inn they might meet the difficulties of he church Thiaetlinge mark ed the church of housecoat times he was brotherly unity and there it as I cared to him was one essential of success of church work in this modern age and in oil tunes They w nted unity between believes such as would convince the world that without more um formity there could exist unity between true Chr stands, compatible with and side by side with the pigs different on matters he h with a separate them (Applause) He did not hesitate therefore to say as an officer of the church that brotherly unity with those who followed not with them as a denomination was essential for the Lords work in a country like this (Applause ) He did not mean merely unity between members of other denominations and believes of their own church but also between their clergy and laity Then there was a rather venture to be tried in the church of posts' c Games This was the spirit of self sacrifice in other words liberality They must have the spirit of Natal exercised paid the agent of Abigail ever tired He saw there were many Abigail's in Victoria's laughter he hoped they might prevail over the Btoi y hearts of their Nabpl In hands They did not want the superfluity of the rich-they wanted every member of the Christian church to give not to the bishop and clergy but to the Lord and to press self sacrifice till it stand, 'therein lay a blessing and a joy they wanted a spirit of large hearted giving which he rejoiced to see was being marvellously developed in their native land He meant anonymous liberality Stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant And to <s liberality not only in money matters though they wanted item p) atically there and he did not doubt it would be forthcoming for he touched to scorn the idea that in a colony like this they must needs have the church bob bring along in a crippled condition If they wanted to get gold out of men's pockets for the Lord they must make a hole in their hearts and it would come out Not only this did they want but personal self sun onder They wanted their sons to go forth to be ministers of Christ the best intellect in Australia to enlist in the service of Australia's word There could not be a nobler calling a higher work than this They did not want only to send to England for ministers but to see them coming forward here even though no prizes of worldly honour or wealth awaited them. If the Holy Ghost came amongst them stud stirred their hearts they should no longer have the spectacle they saw now of their fellow churchmen in the outlying" bush craving in vain for the administration of God's Word and Sacraments Lastly but not least they wanted the spirit of prayer and a believing dependence upon prayer and the grace of God After dwelling upon the efficacy and need of prayer the bishop went onto say that the church s system was sufficient for all things desirable if faithfully carried out and to express the hope that there would be a godly emulation between the two choice as or rather a noble spirit of coo eration which could not but be fruitful of good results he thanked the meeting for their exceedingly kind reception and referring in grateful terms to the music which had been provided said that as the pipes of the organ each had its distinct place and round and each worked together in harmony under one governing band, but would be silent without the wind which was blown into them to what the church needed ! in order to perfect its work was God's Holy Spirit, w ill be played might be most abundantly poured out upon them "Oh statistic mbrcallelwlnl TI it is due b pipes to come 'e of announcing, Every heart a \ leo raised t tin I All of nee Ila To touch to nicetne'S In the 1 cases sauce t con r, they pour, in GoduircBG nevermore (Great applause ) The Doxology having been sung the ban on pronounced the benediction and the meeting closed
