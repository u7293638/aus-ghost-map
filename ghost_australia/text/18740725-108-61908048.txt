PORTFOLIO. When any of us prepare r:ud try to fly to Christ,-whencver we begin to try to "walk with God:" whenever we endea vour to become the servants of Christ, and to do what lie has commanded, depend upon it we shall find difficulties enough. The world will be against us; our own flesh will be against us. The same merci ful Saviour who cured the paralytic will have compassion on us. lIe will teach us to look for forgiveness in His blood. He will teach us to seek for sanctification in the Holy Ghost. IHe will show the way of life in this world. He will help us to walk in that blessed path: and He will teach our hearts always joyfully to remem ber that he that believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved.-T. Short. Make a conscience to perforni those duties which God hath required of thee for His service. Work and spare not, but yet pray too, or else work not. Prayer is the means to procure a blessing upon thy labours from His hands who never faileth to serve them that never fail to serve Him. Did ever any man serve God for. nought? A man cannot. have so comfortable an assurance that he -shall prosper, in the affairs he taketh in hand by any other means as by mnaking God the.Alpha. and Omega of his endeavours,: b beminning them in His name, and directing thens.to Ilis Glory. .; . . Be not tei u so all for thyself as to forget IIim.-lBishop Saunderson. Take heed, lest at any time sitting still, now that we aie -called, we. fall asleep in our sins, ands;the wicked, one, .getting power over us, stir us up, and shut us .out' ofthe kingdom of th Lord.-StBarnabea. .",
