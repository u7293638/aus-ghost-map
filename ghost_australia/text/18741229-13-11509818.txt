THE OCTOBER REVIEWS. -» No. II. Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, the pope mayor of Birmingham, who has just be elected for the second time chief magnates of that town, contributes to the cure number of the Fortnightly an article entity! "The Next Page of the Liberal Programme It explains the secession of the Radicals in the moderate Whigs, as represented by J Gladstone, and declares that he can or regain their support by taking up so questions as those of free church, of land, free schools and free labour the same time he deprecates any attempt displace the Conservatives until the metal desire for further progress has recurred a all sections of the liberal party are ready gratify it He mentions as a striking sign the times that the Labours s Union Chrome which circulates 60,000 copies weekly arno the cottages of the poor and IB read by least half a million people, has from t first made ' freedom from priestcraft one the objects of the most outspoken advocate and the connexion of church and state t subject of its continual denunciation " V XeBhe Stephen, who seems to entertain a great contempt for statecraft, combine with a high respect for literary genius reviews Mr Disraeli's novels and deplore that gentleman's descent into the sports arena, where he is described as wasting 1 intellect in talking clap trap and politics to a drove of bovine legislators and squandering the powers of his imaginary " upon the alternation of truckling as blustering which is called governing a country Mr Stephen seems to have ju as little respect for Parliamentary institutions as Thomas C îrl j le or Prince Bismarck and to be just as deficient in veneration what Togo calls the trade of warsaw we find him writing in such high unconventional language as this - ' would rather have written 'Hamlet' the defeated the Spanish Armada , or Paradise Lost,' than have turned out the Long Park ment, or the Waverley Novels, than he won Waterloo, or even Trafalgar I would rather have been Voltaire or Goethe the Frederick or Napoleon and I suspect the when the poor historian of the nineteenth! century begins his superhuman work 1 will, as a thorough philosopher, attribu more importance to two or three recent English writers than to all the English statesmen who have been strutting and fretted their little hour at W Westminster And therefore, too, I wish that Mr Disraeli could be' stuck to his novels instead of rising to be Pan Minister of England ' Really these waters iconoclasts will leave us nothing to revere 1 and by Mr Ashton Dilke favours us with chapter of his forthcoming work on The Rev Brian Power ' He has penetrated a part of the empire which is very little known Butove there, he tells us he found the remnant of a Scotch colony which originally went on with the laudable intention of converting the Circassians, but as they would not t converted, the unsuccessful missionaries subsided into agriculture in which they have had more success They still keep the good old Scottish names, and the kin flourishes in the Caucasus, though the younger branches have forgotten the native language " Professor Bensly under: takes to furnish a brief but comprehensive view of the history of the Republican party in France, and to show that is a great mistake to suppose that the French people were converted to Repul realism, even momentarily, during the fin revolution At the same time he contend that the march of events is towards the establishment of a firm and durable government on a Republican bills A review t " Supernatural Religion from the pen of the editor of the Fortnightly, deals with the whole question under discussion over trenchantly. With respect to the merit of a work which has been sneered at by religious newspaper in this city as the produc- of infinite index hunting 'Mr Morley re marks -' To praise a book of this extraordinary kind would be an impertinence for any less erudite a scholar than the write himself ' And he then proceeds to give a excellent analysis of its contents, and show wherein the writers position is unassailable and his arguments are unanswerable Speaking of those who "will no doubt declare their indifference to th irresistible reasoning of the present work,' the reviewer observes -" To refuse to take the trouble to think out whether your religion is a supernatural religion or not, it either cowardice or else the most ignoble fund of indolence The result of such an inquiry must have the widest and profoundest bearings over the whole field of aspiration and conduct ' But to "think out' anything in a process to which some minds are wholly unaccustomed, and besides it is so much easier to abuse a writer and to call him very hard names than to try and understand his arguments and statements The obligations of Prussia to General von Scharnhorst, by whom was created that national organisation for war which has been turned to such advantage by the political sagacity of Bismarck, and the military science of Von Moltke are lucidly set foul in the Edinburgh Schamborst, however, was but the pupil of the Count of Lippe with whom originated the Landwehr and the Landsturm, as well as the whole modern method of making war It was an axiom of his that " the more perfectly military science is studied the more dangerous will it be found to commence a war and the more rare, consequently, will war be, and when it does occur, the more removed from use less murder An agreeable paper on English fugitive songs and lyrics only skims the surface of its subject but at the same time Boys enough to show how rich our literature is in Venusian verse although the reviewer is constrained to confess that although I ng land has its Shakspeare it has not yet found its Horace A short article on the census of France in 1872 is interesting, as exhibiting some startling facts in connexion with that country. Its population has died rushed-quite apart from the loss of Alsace and Lorraine half a million in six years, while between 137 and 1871, the deaths exceeded the births by 368 680 Of the whole population of France, 52 per cent the by agriculture, 21 per cent are artisans, 8 per cent live by trade, and 0 per cent and in independent circumstances. There are only 2 800,739 men in France between the ages of 20 and 30, and one in every seven of these is serving in the army So far from being over peopled, " many parts of the French territory,' observes M. Baudet a member of the National Assembly, " require to be colonised ' An essay on comets and meteors professes to offer an explanation of both by representing the latter as the trail of the former Thus it is contended that the August meteors consist of a group of minute bodies, 4,01.1,520 miles broad where the earth plunges through it, and extending through an elliptical course that has a span of 10 088 millions of miles for its greatest diameter. This stream is annually crossed by the earth in six hours,' and is the trail of the comet of 1862 which " has a period of 19 years and moves in that period through an orbit which runs out from the sun as far again as Uranus, and which, therefore, extends quite to the remote confines of the solar system " The A'citiiburo/usdelighted that "the historical Protestantism of the nation" should have re- asserted itself in the Imperial Parliament by the enthusiastic adoption of the Public Worship Act, and urges upon the Legislature not to tolerate the revival of convocation and not to reckon at every turn with the sacerdotal party as though its theories had any serious hold upon the national con- science" The reviewer of M Renan's "at christ asserts of its author that "as though he is great in history he is hardly a historian ; though he deals largely in criticism he is hardly a critic, still less, though he much delights in theology, in he a theologian. He is, first and above all things, an artist," But it is alleged against him that, artist like, he presents the precise facts of the outer world in their somewhat chaotic and prosaic incoherence M. Renan may be incoherent, but most persons will b apt to pronounce his critic crazy Outside of the apocalyptic dissertations and predictions of Dr Cumming, we do not remember to have met with anything wilder than his hypothesis concerning the scarlet woman the seven headed beast, and " the number of a man " He transcribe the " curious passage in full, because," he says, "of th singular certainty with which ltB riddles can be deciphered, and because of the remarkable interest and importance of its contents And then he goes on to make confusion worse confounded by his extravagant conjectures Warm praise is bestowed upon the late Mr. C. C. V Greville s Journal of the Reign of King George IV and King William IV, c which it is said that "there is no better a more graphic history extant of the event which occurred between 1819 and 1837, wind it is added that the writers " habit of leaving; his daily impressions uncancelled while i impairs the accuracy of his opinions add greatly to the vividness of his book as a history The work of the session and the policy of the Ministry, are roughly handled in the political article, which warns Mr Disraeli that in the coming year, "the Government will have to act in the presence of an Opposition which has already begun to recover from the blow which fell upon it a the commencement of the present year, and that its measures will be sharply criticised by opponents who are under: no obligation to propose alternative schemes A very disparaging estimate is formed of the mystics of the fourteenth century by writer in the British Quarterly who stigma uses mysticism as the philosophy of despair and complains that those who held this be lief rejected the doctrine of the Atonement in favour of a theory of self renunciation that they neglected the historical element in revelation and theology, and that they affirmed that " there is within each man a spark of the Divine presence which if not hindered by the blinding influences of sense, will reveal to the individual believer in its own way what is divinely true In fact, their views appear to have been identical with those afterwards held by Madame Guyon and Archbishop Tenelon Another contributor, in an article entitled, "The Lesser Light," describes the moon as to po graphically as Jules Verne himself, and is good enough to suggest that as there is every reason to conclude it is uninhabited, it is a pity human beings cannot utilise it as a kind of convict settlement He says -"There ought to be a penal planet somewhere in the solar system We stand very much in need of a floating Botany Bay We have produced rascals enough on our globe to fill a moderate sized orb like the moon, and if the other planets are equally prolific, it is clear that we could not only cover all those ' grey plains ' with miscreants, but even crowd the craters with villains of an aggravated type" Probably the foregoing is intended for a stroke of humour An article on "Our Naval Requirements seems somewhat out of place in a religious review, especially as it breathes a decidedly bellicose spirit throughout In a review of Mr Morley's recent historical work, exceptions are taken to it on the ground that it is more of a biography than of a history, that it makes too great a hero of Barneveld, exaggerates the position of the Netherlands in the affairs of Europe, and does not catch the true significance of the religious movements of the period treated of But like most other critics the reviewer designates Mr Motley as the man who is pre-eminently qualified to give us an enduring history of the Thirty Years' War A clever essay on the aboli- tion of Church patronage in the Scotch establishment conducts the reader to the conclusion that the event foreshadows a similar change south of the Tweed and that " English patrons must ultimately suffer from the transference of the whole advowson property of Scotland to a democratic and spiritually qualified body ' In a succeeding article we are told that the disestablishment of state churches is the political problem of the hour and that the Church of England has far more to fear from the prosperity and power of that body than from the Nonconformists whom it principally dreads It is argued that no special sanctity attaches to church property which would make any interference with it by the state an act of sacrilege, and a conviction is expressed that so soon as Mr Gladstone clearly perceives that the Establishment can exist only as an Trastian institution, he will put himself at the head of a party which will determine that it shall not exist at all. An able and comprehensive dissertation on the genius and work of Edwin Landseer touches upon most of his productions and exhibits on the part of the critic a discriminating judgment, accompanying a careful study of the painters manifold achieve- ments An admirable engraving by Heath of W Hunt's humorous picture, entitled "The Attack and a clever copy of "The Ghost Story, by BUBS, an artist who was popular thirty years ago but has almost passed out of recollection, form the most attractive illustrations of the Art Journal which is also rich ID woodcuts, Mr Robertson s views on the Thames being, as usual, excellent The little vignette representing a sunk bargo though very simple in its elements, contains the motif of an impressive picture In an obituary notice of sibley, the sculptor, Mr S C Hall relates an anecdote showing the prudery of the public mind When he began publishing engravings of statuary many persons remonstrated with him, and in two or three instances persons sent him by post the engraving torn from the number, with a strong protest against a publication that endangered the minds of those who found there such perilous stimulants ' '
