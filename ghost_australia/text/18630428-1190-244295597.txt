MR. CARRUTHERS AND THE RAIL WAY OFFICIALS. To the Editor of the Herald. Sin, — The plan, of yonr penny paper meots a great public want, and I am glad to see tbnt you do not flinch from giving, impartially, the views of sect and partv, no matter how ex- treme. Somo opinions ore, no doubt, absurd ; but it is only by tbe light of publicity that people can understand what is going on around them, and, in the ond, that truth can prevail. Now, as to tho question of Mr Carruthors's case. Why should I, as a subordinate om- ployed in the railway department, be pressed and taken before Mr Mitchell, nnd asked .various questions through tho instigation of Mr Carruthers, regarding the trial now in oommittoo of the Assembly, and which I re- fusod to answer ? I am now told that I shall bo dismissed from my present position in not obeying my superiors. I know this loiter may prove fatal to mo, but I cannot refrain from lotting tho publio know tho tyranny that is carried on in this disgraceful department by Mitchell and Carrutlicrs.— I am, Sir, yours respectfully, A SUBSCRIBER. Tub Wifb of a Collector ia a town in Illinois was recently frightened to death on licr own threshold by a respectable merchant of tho town, who ' had, for a joke, dressed himself up fantastically as a ghost, and presented him self suddenly at her door in the evening.
