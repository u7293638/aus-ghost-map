The New £.G*PttsbJtay. Formal Opkninq. The new presbytery, just erected im-: mediately to- the eastward of thi* R.C.1' Church, was on Sunday last formally: opened. The Rev. Father Tierney, M.S.H., of Rand wick, conducted special services in connection with the event forenoon and evening. Immediately after early Mass, and in the presence of a very large gather ing, Father, Tierney blessed the new premises. At 11 o'clock Mass the church was thronged, there being representatives of several Christian denominations other than members of the Roman Catholic body. Mass was conducted by Rev. Father Sheri dan*? the respected parish priest, after which Father Tierney delivered an exhaustive and 1 interesting address pourtraying the duties and responsibilities of the priesthood, and their obligations to their people and their Divine Master. After having explained tlie object of his visit, and having con gratulated the Catholics of Milton upon the building of the presbytery, the rev. gentle man came to the subject of his discourse, ' The Priesthood ' There was one great fact, he said, which dominated humanity, which enlightened its past, and solved the problem of its future destiny — the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ He then showed how the Word of God as 8umed human nature, and, clothed in the vestment of our humanity, He, the God man, offered himself a victim on the cross for-,-theTausou»io£tbeiW.orJd.-r..jT-iiat3oblatioii-j was of infinite worth, and fully satisfied the claims of God's justice. It was offered by One who had the nature of God and the nature of man ; as God His sacrifice was j fully adequate ; and as man he represented the whole human race and made ample reparation for the sins of men. But Christ was to be a ' Priest forever,' and although from His throne in heaVeufj He could haS e. applied to all future generations the merits of Hie sacrifice once offered, upon ther'alt-ar of the cVbss/ile* did not-t-b-will it, 'but tie devised the means by which that sacrifice was to be perpetuated upon earth unto the end of time. , tion of the Eucharist and %y th'e e^f Jbf ment of the Priesthood.

There was bu£ one priesthood^ though, there were many priests. Later on, buril/brcl gave to His apostles a second power, ? tfhe -power to forgive sins. ' Receive ye the Holy Ghost ; whose sins ye shall forgive they are-forgiven' them,, A and whose^ ,sins ye ^shall , £Vr.etajju, they are rfetaitieol.' This 'fwb'-fold ' pbw'e?','1 the power to consecrate the body; and blood of Christ, sind . the power to 'forgive ? sius, cbnstituted the 'plenitude of the pi'iest hood. . But the apostles did not receive: the priesthood for themselves only ; it was. »ot tadie with them ; .and just as Christ ordained them priests, sb they in their turn transmitted the power they had received,1 aud hence it was, he said, that the Catholic \ priesthood had continued in unbroken suc cession from the time of our Lord Himself unto the present, and would continue to the ehd of time. The priest, the rev. gentle man continued, was. invested with great yjpower and great dignity, but it was not S forTiimself or for' his? personal 'elevation.' , St., Paul -says ^-(-Hebrews, ^3h.^w., ,4«fe«verse)^ that '.'every high-priest taken from among inen is ordained.for men, in things that ap pertain 'to God' ; and the priest was first of all|the ' man of God,'as Sfc Paul described his: disciple Timothy. His first duty was tolvoi'ship Godj to praise God : he was the 'dispenser of the my.steri^s„pf God' ; he wate God's ^tii^^kdor* | *yhe priest was al«ip the witiness'1 bf Christ^—1' You ^iil be witnesses unto me—the ministers of Christ.'

Thfe priest was'*the 'm'aiKbfrthe people ; it w#s he, - wlro blessed them nion^of husband ?and' wife* ? in that sacrament which was -the founda tion of the ^ family, and society ; it was he who niaa&3rfiliefchildrfe|ii§f, men children . of God ; it was he who offered up the body; Ghnfst'for the living, and- ?!&fedeswjlt;it wa^ljewbo^avethechildre'n 4 strong jt_ v was he who aaidto tlie sinner : .'/ Be of ' good heart, thy sins are forgiven thee' ; it .was he who ahointed the sick with holy ' oil ; who attended thedyingundgave them the last blesttngiwho consigned tbede partoehio their last resting plact-, and prayed thattheirsbul might ' rest in'ipeace.' It was; the priest who strove to obtain for the children the blessings of a christian education;, who knew his people by their names ; who made no distinction between poor and rich; who was as. proud to. grasp the hand of the humble sbnof toil as that of the magnate ; who shared the joys and sorrows of his people ; who 'made himself all to all, to gain all to Christ. Having thUs in eloquent! terms, 4ndipated the high duties of the office of the priesthood, its responsibilities and its duties, Father Tierney graphically described the advan tages that accrued to the 'Catholics of thb district in having a resident priest, wjgb was ever reaiiy to 'spend and be spent ' in the services of his God and of his people, and thou proceaded to point out the obliga tions the parishioners on their part owed to their priest. He concluded by making an earnest appeal to his hearers to be true to the history of their ancestors, true to them selves and to their children ; and to con tribute generously towards paying off the the debt on the presbytery, thus relieving the priest of financial embarrassment, and rearing a, monument that would stand through the generations as a tribute to their faith; and their loyalty to their church. Father Sheridan gave a brief statement » f this' financial position. 'From this it ap peared '4hat^hesA0&j;?f,£.rei^ tery, of purchasing an addition to the 'church sice, and incidental charges in con-; .nectiou therewith totalled £430. The jate bazaar and other efforts had reduced the indebtedness to ^,270, which amount it was hoped would be reduced materially that day. $ Subscriptions and promises were then handed in, t!i£§n,mojunis ranging from £2 2s to the smallest coin. So hearty and so generous, was the response to the; appeal mbde, that ;in a'verys sbort^iaripj £|0 odd had been received — a result very gratify ing and eminently satisfactory. | 'i%T?re%tois^ofrwood, of artistic 'aesign, andv-'ybo*nvfenient!* in every respect.
