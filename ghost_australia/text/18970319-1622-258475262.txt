THREE FIGURES SHROUDS. IN Probably few persons would be sufficiently strong minded to pass a solitary night in a room said to be a haunteel without experiencing some disagreeable nerve shocks. Lady Burton tells a story of a friend of hers {Winwood Keade, the author), who put this fact to tlie test. Beade was a man of stron« nerve and undoubted courage, "so brave that he could heard to tell this story," is Lady Burton's comment. While travelling, either in Afiisa or India (Lady Burton is uncertain about the exact locality), Keade was told that a ceitain bungalow was uninhabitable, as it- was haunted by the ghosts of three surgeons who had died there oF cholera, and who, each midnight, entered 3i a of the rooms (which had glass doors opening out into the compound), arrayed in their winding sheets. Wishing to test the truth of this storv, the suthe>r took up his abode iu the haunted room one night, armed with a gun and plenty of lights and books. His native servant absolutely refused to enter the bungalow with Lioo, but consented to remain outside: on the roof, also armed with a gun. Bsade occupied himself with his books, anil fdl was quiet until the stroke of twelve, when "with a loud noise, the glass flew open, and three figure?, iu white shrouds, steppe:l into the room." On Lady Burton's inquiring it the spectator hr.d tested if the apparitions we re practical jokers or supernatural victors, Keade candidly rep'it.d : " To tell you the truth, 1 fainted deal off, and droppsd my gun ; and, as soon as I cams to myself, I called the boy down from the roof, and made off as fast as 1 could." — II Globe."
