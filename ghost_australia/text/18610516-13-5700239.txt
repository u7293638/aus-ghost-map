The Black Swan has had fresh breezes and fine wea- ther during the passage. —————————— LUMINOUS FUNGUS.—A large fungus was brought to our office yesterday evening by Mr. M'Alpine, M.M.B., which presented the remark- able feature of being very highly phosphorescent. The fungus was of the toadstool species, and about eight or ten inches in diameter. In colour, the upper part was black in the centre, and shaded off towards the sides to light brown ; underneath it was a very light and delicate yellow. In thick ness, it varied from one to two inches. When seen in the dark its appearance was most singular. It was so luminous with phosphoric light that it seemed almost transparent. It emitted so much light that the person holding it could he distinctly seen, and, from the delicate tracings of its fibres, it had the aspect of a brillant shell. It was found growing to the stump of an old tree, Mr. M'Alpine being attracted to it at night-time by its strange light. We are not aware of fungus of this de- scription having been remarked before. It is now at our office, and can be seen by the curious.— Mount Ararat Advertiser, May 14.
