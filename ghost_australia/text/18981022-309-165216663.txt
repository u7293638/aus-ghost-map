A German out day expressed himself as being some what offended because an American gen tleman had asserted that his Teutonic countrymen could not as a rule appreciate American jokes. /~- 'Try one on me]' said he defiantly, and the American accordinglv told him the story of the tree 'out west' which was so high that it took two men to see to the top. One of them saw as far as he could, «nd then the second began to look at the 4spot where the first stopped seeing. The recital did not raise the ghost of a Emile upon the Germans face, and the other said to him: 'Well, you see, the joke is lost on yon JTou can't appreciate American humor.'
