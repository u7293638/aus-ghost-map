CHILDREN'S COLUMN. {Contributions, original or otherwise, to this part of the paper will be thankfully received by the Editor The Way op the World. There sat a crow on a lofty tree, "Watching the world go by; He saw a throng that swept along With laughter loud and high. " In and out through the motley rout" Pale ghosts stole on unseen. Their hearts were longing for one sweet word Of the love that once had been ; But never a lip there spoke their names, Never a tear was shed. The crow looked down from his lofty tree— " 'Tis the way of the world," he said. A singer stood in the market place, Singing a tender lay. But no one heeded bis sorrowful face, No one had time to stay. He turned away ; he sang no more ; How could he sing in vain 1 And then the world came to his door, Bidding him sing again ; But be recked not whether they came or went, He in his garret dead. The crow looked down from his lofty tree — " 'Tis the wag of the world," he said. There sat a queen hy a cottage bed, Spake to the widow there. Did she not know the same hard blow The peasant had to bear ? And she kissed that humble peasant's brow, And then she bent her knee— " God of the widow help her now, As Thou has helped me." " Now, God be thanked," said the old, old crow, As he sped from his lofty bough; " The times are ill, but there's much good still In the way of the world I trow."
