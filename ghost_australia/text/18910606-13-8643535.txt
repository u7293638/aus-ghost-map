IRISH AUSTRALIANS. BY ONE OF THEM. In the criticisms passed upon the positions maintained in my first paper, the fact that averages only can be considered in a subject like this has been ignored. I was not, and am not inclined to be, so unjust to the great- ness and goodness of many members of the Roman Catholic Church in all ages us to say that none of them had a higher moral sanc- tion than that of physical pain. And I do not think, as Dr. Carr implies that I think, and as he himself appears to think, that a hedonistic hope of reward, or even the love of God, is the highest moral ideal which a man can have. Some Roman Catholics have a higher. I maintain, however, that Irish Australians as a whole are taught from the pulpit and in the school the duties of life and the commands of the church under the lowest of all sanctions, and so little and so ineffectively under any others that they are, for the purposes of our discus- sion, negligeable. Men like a Kempis might well inspire the Roman Catholic with the love of God, but the value of that "gift of the Holy Ghost, the fear of the Lord, is so much insisted on, and it is so glowingly apparelled, that any such influence is thwarted One who was a member of the church for years and an acolyte on her altars, one who has been confirmed in her doctrine and has taught in her schools, is not without warrant in saying that the fear of punishment for breaking some trifling ordinance is usually too great in the average Roman Catholic mind to leave much scope for even the crude epicureanism of her present leaders And we have no right to search for the moral sanction of the average Irish Australians elsewhere than in the average teachings of the average priest, the average appre hcnsion of the catechism, and the average explanations of the school teacher The fact remains that while the average non Catholic Australian finds his moral sanction in that faith in God, a necessary consequence of which is abstinence from what the moral imperative tells him is evil, the average Irish Australian abstains from evil, or what he is told is evil, because he fears hell I do not deny that the intention of the church in this and in the religious education question is for the best, but it is unfortunately, only too true that good inten tions are the motive powers of the most varied forms of wrong and foolishness We are seeking the probable results of a certain 'policy, not examining the intentions of its promoters My reference to the widening gulf between the religious beliefs was directed to the fact that on two unlike people two increasingly divergent influences were acting, with the almost certam result of producing structurally and functionaly distinct types To this one correspondent replies with a statement of the numerical increase of the Roman Catholics, which in this connection is an ignoratio clenchi, and Dr Carr with what I may call a curious architectural fallacy Is the fact of the stationary position of the Roman Catholic Church in regard to its doctrines, including that of moral sanction, is ad mutted I need say nothing more here, leaving any further inferences to the judgment of a people to whom evolution is not meaningless, and certainly not erroneous In a new country social organisation is simpler than in older lands But forces, like and unlike, begin soon then work; the simpler and more indefinite features become more complex and definite, the homogeneous be come heterogeneous Economical and social laws begin to segregate individuals from their indefinite relations to their fellows to definite relations of superiority, equality, or inferiority to their fellows If the people be composed of different races, emotionally, morally, and intellectually alike or equal, these laws will operate irrespective of race, but if unlike and unequal the segregation will be to the advantage of the fittest for tne requirements Segregation has been defined to be a process tending ever to separate unlike units and to bring together like units-serving continually to sharpen, or make definite, differentiations otherwise caused The application of these principles to the Irish Australians is clear I have no cause to think that the two divisions of the people were so unlike at first, or until the passing of the Education Act, that the economical laws which divide men into those who rule and those who serve, those who think and those who hew, were any thing but indifferent to the fact of race But it is patent that a segregation of the Irish Australians from their fellows has taken place since the Education Act and is con turning 'The very social ostracism that has been admitted, whether it is justifiable or not, is proof of it 'Their weak representa tion in Parliament is another proof 'Hie big donations of non Catholic business men have little force against my conten tion When segregation is taking place, factors which would have been negligible otherwise, on account of their modifiability, become important I shall attempt nu analysis of the present position of the Irish Australian I cannot treat the subject as fully as is desirable in a paper like this, it can only be indicative An examination of the analysis will, I think, justify the main con tentions in my previous paper I premise, of course, that in dealing with bodies of men unforeseen complications are always occur ring which may nullify any conclusions In subjects like these we can only indicate tendencies The principal factors in our problem are the Irish race, the Roman Catholic religion and the tendency to complete segregation 1 Emotionally the Irish are more easily influenced by passions than most of their fellows They are very clannish 'They are more impulsive than the British-that is to say, their actions are often rather auto matte than conscious, and they have a ten dency to seek the nearer rather than the more remote but greater pleasure Caesar pointed out that the Gauls or Celts were fickle, changeable, and the histories of France and Ireland bear him out In refer ence to this, it should be observed that with advancing evolution fickleness of conduct grows less and less They delight in praise 'The absence of applause checks then suc cess They have strong desires, are very courageous on occasion, but have almost un accountable fits of fear Their love of activity is not so strong as the British , their love of power is great 1Their sympathies are very warm and capable of indefinite expan sion Their strong emotional and social characteristics would be invaluable to any race with which they assimilated Morally, the Irish have shown themselves capable of acting according to the highest ideals although other Celtic nations have de scended very low in this respect 'The spirit of self sacrifice is common Regard for the wel fare of others is almost a national trait 'Their self control is hardly strong enough, but they are largely influenced in conduct by the good opinion of others A restricted social con trol is, accordingly, fraught with moral danger to them We must not be too hard on them for Plan of Campaign weaknesses, although the connection of those with political morality should not be forgotten Morally, the Irish are at least as good as others, on the whole They are capable of acting according to very high standards of morality, and thus lower standards are harm ful to them, for when men do things from lower motives than they might, they tend to become organically unable to do them otherwise Intellectually, the Irishman differs from his fellows in such a way that, if he is in communion with them, he tends to become then equal or superior, but if in segregation then inferior The principal characteristics of his intellect are a powerful imagination, a good memory, a keen appreciation of like ness, a feebler of difference, a tendency to quickly form positive opinions a frequent inexactness, an adherence to old ways of doing things, a weak, power of weighing evi dence, and a certain brilliance when sur rounding circumstances are favourable His fickleness affects his intellectual powers His natural curiosity and love of knowledge are capable of remarkable development us ure his aesthetic powers There is nothing in the Irish or Celtic character which is not assimilable to the British, as may be seen from the relations of the Norman settlers with the Irish, the Cornish with the Saxon, the Welsh and the Scottish Highlanders with their neighbours It should not be forgotten that the Irishman starts with an historical handicap against him His race has not had as good a political and intellectual training in the past as the other races have had 2 Emotionally, the Roman Catholic tends to become devout historical, self reproachful, inclined to dependence, and sensuous to a fault It lins been pointed out that with the higher development of emotion the love of ceremony, so pronounced in the Roman Catholic religion, tends to die out THIS sentiment of justice is vitiated by a system which sends him to hell equally for committing a murder and for omitting to go to church once on Sunday His conception of a divinity being lower than that of his fellows would seem to point to an emotional inferiority this phase of the analysis is inseparably connected with the moral phase Morally, his sanctions betoken him in ferior He has but reached a stage which most others passed long ago Not having the high aims which even his materialistic fellow citizens can have,his morality remains stationery It Â¡s as inferior to that of the rest of the community as the Greek morality was to the Christian Any capacity he may have had for attaining higher forms of morality tends to become lost by disuse His highest morality, even as given by his leaders here is vastly inferior to utilitarianism such as Mill's, to a universalistic hedonism such as Sedgwick's to that moral imperative which persons so widely different as Im manuel Kant and George Eliot recog nised and to such an idea of moral progress as the late Professor Green enunciated Such a system of morality will be of invaluable assistance in the future as an auxiliary to the policeman and the soldiery in restraining the evil passions of dependent masses but on the intelligence of the country it can have little or no influence The political morality of the consistent Roman Catholic must be low if his leaders mix in politics. The man who can vote for or against federa tion, for instance, merely because the man who proposes it is for or against the Educntion Act is in point here Men who must vote blindly, unquestioningly, when the interests of their church's leaders are affected are morally inferior in this respect to then fellow colonists, and indeed are a menace to their liberties Intellectually, the Roman Catholic tends to become inferior to his fellow colonists because there are many of the most important and interesting things in life which he must accept without question from hIns church no matter how absurd its attempted explanation of them may seem This dwarfs the reason and in a scientific and intellectually progressive age is a serious handicap As a result of the almost total lack of the sceptical and critical spirit his credulity Is great From his being warned against even listening to arguments opposed to his church's dogmas he acquires the habit, not unfamiliar in trades union episodes, of thinking there is only one side to an argument As a result of his slavish ad herence to authority, he now lacks origin ality, the effect of which on keeping him de pendent must become prodigious He has an imperfect conception of causation,in common with the infcnoi races of man, due almost cntirely to his religion 'The effects of this on his intellectual progress would need a treatise to set out adequately With mention of the fact that impulsiveness impedes volun tary co-operation, and thus forces the Irish Roman Catholic to involuntary co-opera tion, and consequent lower status I must con chide this imperfect but suggestive list 2 The effect of segretation on the emotional aide of the character ot the Irish Roman Catholic will be to intcneify the emotional defects of his race mid Ins religion and, on account of their more limited play, to present the de velopmtent of Ins superior traits pari passu with that of those of Ins fellow s I he result must be strong, badiy directed feelings and more definite differentiation of his whole character in the direction of emotional unfit ness New feelings of hatred and jealousy, new forms of religious bigotry, and renicar nations of racial antipathy will assuredly arise, and leant on other Australians produc mg new causes of distrust Suspicion will continue growmg until it becomes enniity Morally, segregation may produce stronger moral fibre among the Irwsh Roman Catholics in their relations to each other (every great act of self sacrifice whether for a good or bad cause tends to do that), but their relations to other men quite as important from a moral point of view, will be less sympa thetic than they are even now For in stance, Roman Catholics often speak of their carelessness as to whether things get on well or badly in the state schools Their absolute indifference as to whether the great and good men of other sects will be sent to hell is a glaring instance of a long existent lack of sympathy with their fellow men Increase of sympathy is, pel haps, one of the best signs of the moral progress of man, lnck of it, of the reverse The general tendency of segregation in this phase will be that their moral defects will be increased by per sistencc, their superiority will tend to fatli mid a narrow Irish Roman Catholic morality will be contrasted with a broad Australian morality, with the necessary consequence of a moral inferiority and unfitness Intellectually, segregation will more and more, as it does now in part, limit the scope and experience of the Irish Roman Catholic so that he will be unable to increase his intellectual powers at the same rate as his fellows and will tend to lag behind The more pronounced tho segregation, the less will be his com munion with his former equals In this phase, as in the other two, segregation will tend to make deficiencies definite and in creasing and to dwarf what is excellent The addition and subtraction of the like and unlike tendencies above indicated will, I think, sufficiently justify the position I take, that the Irish Roman Catholics when segregated by such influences as their educational system, and the priestly rule of which that system is the most prominent expression, will tend m Vustralia to gravitate to a lower social posi tion than their fellow colonists Facts prov nig the tendency to segregation are obtain able on all hands, as letters in the columns of The Argus indicate That separate Roman Catholic education and its re suits, together with the activity of the priests which has brought it about, are the causes or the most potent causes of this tendency is sufficiently appn rent 'The principles with wIhch I introduced the anabysis of our problem into its factoirs taken in connection with the evidence con tamed in that analysis and the results of ordinary observation in everyday life, give sufficient ground for the in dication of a probable future emo tional, moral and intellectual deterioration of the Irish Australians I need not indicate the economical laws that will work in this direction It must be remembered that in all well united communities other influencis than the religious are brought to bear on the members whether the moral control originates from the theological, political, and social checks on man's passions, or is prior to them or any of them, the fact remains that a section of a people which has a high moral and theological control-an effective political and social control-will tend to become superior to a clearly defined section which has lower controls of all kinds An analysis on this basis would show similar indications to the above analysis I would urge on all investigating this ques tion on both sides, to remove as far as pos sible what Herbert Spencer calls the patriotic bias one to which Irishmen are peculiarly liable The question is a scientific one and must be treated in a scientific spirit If my positions are tenable they call for in stunt remedy and the only remedy would seem to be assimilation I do not object to separate schools as such-nay variety is de sual le here as in other things- but when the si stun becomes such a menace to the pros pects of my fellows I deem it my duty to point that fact out (In regard however to the effi ciency of the teaching in the Roman Catholic schools it should be remembered that their most capable teachers tend to become cluni nated by the better salaries and prospects oflered by the state the church with a certain inconsistency allowing them to seek for these )
