MR GEORGE CRUIKSHANK. (From the Athenaeum, February 3'.) AViTit the death of Mr Cruikshank on the 1st of this month the long list of EngU h pictorial satirists has closed The spirit which actuated those ministers was so different from that of their successors of to day that it is not too much to say the race is no was finally extinguished English caricature was never so brilliant as in the days of Hogarth, but its traditions were sustained by Paul Snndbv and others of his generation who are now less known It owed a good deal to the genius of the first Marquis Townsend, and also to Rowlandson, Gillrft), Ivav Bunbury, and their folio v era There was not much vigour in t) le comparatively mild humour of "H B. and John Leech and his numerous followers turned their powers to gentler purposes, owing to satire a very different direction from that which it had primarily Cruikshank, who possessed greater wealth of inven- tion than any of his precursor was the true heir of Rowlandson and Gillray, but like Hog iron 1, herself aimed at less"! than moral ends, and from first to last desired the improvement of mankind A large purpose is distinct in nearly all his satires, to whether they are directed against political opponent! i, personal follies and vices, or social shortcomings To quo e examples in proof of this would be a work or super- derogation Al e have alw a} s held it I miss age or terms to style Cruikshank a caricaturist in the sense in which other satirists, from Leonardo i la A mci to Hogarth and later designers, are called caricaturists What most resembles caricature in th e satires of Cruikshank is, as it appears to us, sole is due to his most erratic choice of a pea and mc did, not to his manner of dealing with them. It would therefore, be wrong to speak of him as a can satirist He was a pure satirist of the richest I an, in exhaustible in invention, incomparably dramatic, oil n profoundly pathetic, and, in those tender passages which it was his delight to portray, he often starts 1 us in an unexampled fashion As an artist pet see his rank ought to be higher than that popularly, awarded to him, for, some

satire generally had a sorrowful, pitying aspect, and, like the nov chief s it often effected its purpose in social and legal improvements Cruikshank may be said to have been a follower of Gillrax s, with a noble inspiration, and a truer and finer mode of art Primarily, his father taught him to draw for, although he frequented the Academy schools in Fuseli s time, it was not in academical xv a} s that he was likely to work His first occupation was that which "Uulreadj followed about the same time, designing for children 's books and popular song! illustrations all of which were markedly

that date he was employed in works of humour and pathetic designs rather than in squibs and personal satire Of course, such an artist was employed on many stupid books which now only live by means of his genius of these the dullest specimens of literary crash were Fierce ran s "Life in Paris,' xc After these came a finer series of subjects, in which some of the best powers of the artist were displayed, such as Maxwell s 'History of the Irish Rebellion,' in which there were twenty water colour drawings choice works, showing earnest participation in the events portrayed, an intensity of sensibility so great as to make it seem as if the artist had In edaraongsc the scenes he depicted Although these drawings were made probably many years after the rebellion was extinguished, it seemed

murder- ing of a drummer boy by some men, who stick then pikes into his young lady without pity The illustrations to Peter scheduled are amongst the finest displays of Cruikshank s genius , with these began a series of highly imaginative designs of ghostly legends, marvels of fancy and terrors of the spirit This series included " Italian Tales, ' " Baron Munchausen Scott's " Demonology and Witchcraft," and a few others An irrepressible vein of fun ran through most of these productions and illuminated them wonderfully, mixing fancy and humour to perfection The best of them is known as "The Ghost Story of a man who has seated himself in some long haunted room, and receives, while his Arm crackles on the hearth-for man) a year disused-a visit from some of the chambers old
