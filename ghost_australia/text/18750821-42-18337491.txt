Rockhampton. August 9. WE are having a spell of delightful weather just now, the days being just Warm enough to be agreeable, and the nights quite cold enough to endure a good thickness of clothing on our beds; in fact, the temperature at night is only a shade above freezing point. The country generally is looking well, especially the coast country, where a milder and more regular temperature prevails, and more moisture. What the next few months may do, however, is very, hard to say, for we are now entering upon our dry season, and as the heat strengthens the stored moisture speedily evaporates. Cattle owner* are everywhere jubi lant over their prospects, and, for the most part, are fairly, prosperous. The Laurel Bank Meat Preserving Company is making a show. Over eighty hands are em» ployed upon it at present, and the company is. preserving at the rate of tbirtv-one head per day. During the month of July five hundred and eighty-four head of cattle were slaughtered, some of which weighed as much as twelve hundred pounds. Within a radius of a few miles from the esUbluhment there is some of the best fattening country in the district, aad in the neighborhood of Canal Creek acme of th* heaviest cattle are to be found. The last examination of the insolvent, Ah Yin, formerly a storekeeper at Rosewood, waa held before the Police Magistrate on Friday hut Mr. D'Arcy examined the insolvent on behalf of Means. Stewart and Lucas, creditor*, endeavoring to elicit something from Ah Yin to the effect that he had received monersfrom creditor*, and for cattle that he had sold since he filed hia schedule. On neither of these points, however, did he make out a clear case, and the examination was concluded. The charitably disposed are being appealed to for subscriptions to aid the widow and six chil dren of Mr. Wade, late •Ution-matter at Watt wood. The list was headed by the Mayor with a aum of three guineas, and much sympathy, of like character is being manifested by the public generally, so that a nice little sum ia likely to be forthcoming for the bereaved ones. The benevolent society of thi* town find* that additional work and extended claim* upon them aria* out of every fresh batch of immigrant* landed, and at the same time they find, to their great dissatisfaction, that funds do not increase proportionately with the demands thus made. The scarcity of money, caused lately by the floods and stagnant business, has had to do with mcreasing their burdens and lessening the annual subscriptions, and in addition to this their appeal to the Government for aid in the erection of a permanent asylum, a very necessary institution, hat, a* yet, met with no response. A great deal of good ha* been accomplished by means of this society, and it is deserving of encouragement and sym pathy as well as substantial assistance from the public, and also the Government In addition to the usual police business in dealing with inebriate* at the Court thi* morn* ing, two prisoners were charged with laroeny, one of whom—an aboriginal—pleaded guilty, and electing to be tried by a jury was com mitted to take his trial; the other, for stealing £14, was remanded until to- morrow. Henry Cargill, on remand from Gladstone, where he was arrested for forgery, waa remanded for eight days for the production of the necessary evidence. It appears that after his arrest at Gladstone and being put iu the lockup that be came very near making bis escape. With this in view b* stripped himself stark naked and, with the assistance of his blankets, made up a dummy with his clothing and then shouted out to th* police that there was a ghost in his cell, and feigning to be mad. After a while his keeper came to see what was up when be crept towards the door and kept per fectly quiet, and when the door opened, in the ;;loom, the turnkey mistook tbe dummy or bis man, and while making toward* it Cargill bolted, aa naked as he was born, and succeeded in getting away some half-a-mile or so when, from bis ignorance of the country, he was^ripped by a low fence. Fortunately he was again secured by the police, and irons were used to make sure of what was evidently a slippery customer.. Bail was refused the prisoner by the Bench this morning. At tbe monthly sittings of the Land Court held to-day over thirty applications were conai sidered, five of which were adjourned, and the remainder accepted provisionally. The amount in acne applied for was 11,853 acres of second class pastoral, 335 acre* first-class ditto, and only 20 acres agricultural. The enquiry for land is on the increaae in this district, and before many year* are past agriculture will be Talking rapid -| I wrote you two day* ago hy the Lady Young,: ' but immediately after, she left the mail steamer turned up at Townsville, so this will, in all pro* bability, forestal my former communication. Thi* i* no nnusual occurrence, for the Northern mail boat is ao uncertain, being sometimes days before, and at others a day after her time, ao that it ia haaardous to hold a letter back for her when the regular boat i* leaving, and conse quently your correspondent's communications are often" a day behind the fair," in spite of every effort to prevent it Punctuality on the part of the Northern mail boat* in passing Keppel Bay downward* would be a great im provement on the present uncertainty. The shoal water on the Upper Flat* is being fert continually just now, ana very injuriously. The Balclutha hat been stuck, since 2 p.m. on Monday last, on the other side of them, through insufficiency of water to cross them, and may be kept there a day or two yet; and all this would be prevented by a fortnight's dredging where the water is ahalloweat The captain of the Lady Douglas was remarking the other day that if the dredge would only work a few weeks where her services are most needed, be would be able to load hia vessel right up at the wharf, iandget away nicely ; as it is, however, even the little steam tender, Bronxewing, drawing no more than three or four feet at moat, is .unable to cross at low water, and not : before half-tide. It is rumoured that something will shortly be done to remedy this unsatisfac tory state of affairs, and the sooner the incon venience and loss we now have to complain of is put an end to the better. * Over £60 have already been collected on behalf of Mrs. Wade and family, whoae husband .was late atation-master at Westwood. Private benevolence has been checked by tbe knowledge that deceased was a Government servant, a* it ia thought to be a case wherein the Government should interfere. Doubts are, however, enter tained of receiving any help from that quarter, and further addition* are expected to the list, - which i* not yet closed. I An accident which proved fatal to both hone and rider befel a stockman on the Tflpal run last Thursday. The man, whose name was West field, was cantering at a smart pace over some rough ground to head some fat cattle, when the ihorae stumbled and fell on the top of the rider, jfracturing the latter'* skull and dislocating hi* ineck, *o that he died immediately afterwards ; ; the hone also sharing the same fate. An enquiry 'waa held on the body the next day, and the re remain* of the unfortunate man. who it appears was single, were interred upon the station. The aeoomnhoaof Henry Cargill in th* forgery business, Thomas Spanning, alias Herman! Brown, hat been arrested in Sydney, and will be forwarded to Rockhampton by frit steamer, probably the Boaanraag, - >.-,.,• August 14, < To all appearance, summer is coming in upon ' us with rapid stride*. Mid-day is quite hot enough for summer, clothing, but- the shades of evening are scarcely warm enough to suit the blood-thirsty mosquitoes ; it may be taken for granted, therefore, that the weather is all that could be desired. The road* are everywhere good, a* may be teen by the fact that over 460 bales of wool reached town thi* week, and several of our leading merchants have combined to load the Lady Douglas, with every confidence that she will be able to leave a full ship at some time early in October. Captain Wymark, of the Lady Douglas, was reniarking the other day that if two feet of silt ware removed by the dredge from the wont twenty feet of the Upper Flat*, he would be able to take hit ship over them ML A fortnight's dredging would About do this, and we are therefore hoping that th* captain will find the obstacle gone when he is ready to take advantage of it At th* time of the R.M.B. Bowen's arrival in ; Keppel Bay, it appears there was no pilot at the 'station to board her, and the little steam tender Bronaewing had to steam tea mile* further than ordinary to tranahip mails and passenger*. This unueual ooourreaee is to be attributed to several things, for in the first place all the pilots at the station were on duty with different Teasels, and in the second place the men at the pilot station ware not apprised of the arrival of the mail steamer along the coast northwards, in time to alter their arrangements. They were under the impression that they would have forty fire hours' olear notice of her arrival to the North before she would reach Keppel Bay, instead of which they bad less than twenty-four. The pilot station has been blamed by the Press for negligence in the matter, but it ia evident that the saddle hat been put upon the wrong hone. An interesting event occurred on board the Broncewing during her return trip. A lady pas senger who had gone down by her, having booked herpaflsageto Melbourne by the Bowen, was found 'to be about to give birth to a child directly after she got on board the mail steamer. This being the oaae she was compelled to return, and D* Brennan, a passenger by the Bowen, to meet the Somerset, a, accompanied her, and hia ser vice* were called into requisition while coming up the river, the young lady being safely deli vered of a daughter in the small cabin of the little steam tender. The people of the Central Districts are be ginning to alter their opinions with reference to the Macalister Ministry, as they see a willing ness to do us something like justice. The sum of £20,000 voted for river improve .ments, with the promise of the extension of the Northern Railway to the Comet River, together with the work decided upon for the formation of a dam, and thereby a good water supply for North Rockhampton. These things have all told in favor of the Ministry, and great expecta tions are excited by the fact that the proposed site of a bridge over the FitSToy is being sur veyed, for the purpose of furnishing plan* and an estimate of the cost of the structure. These are all great and important works, and upon them, in a great measure, the mcreasing pros perity of the district is dependent No wonder, therefore, if the feeling* of the public are swayed according at their wishes are attended to or
