THE CYCLORAMA AND PALACE OF WONDERS. this attractive exhibition ia now quite en titled to its new name, aa not only is it the Cyclorama, bat a plaoe of novelties. Not content with the grandeur of the marvellous production ot tne battle ot Waterloo tne management ia most liberal to its patrons. As an additional attraction the 'Napoleonic illusion' is worth seeing alone, bnt thia ia not all. Hints have been thrown out that something more startling was in band, and from what ia said theeecond novelty of 'Hydatapikilumina,' or the 'Laughing Fountains of Enchanted Waters,' ia to be one of the most startling novelties produced here. The production is said to be enchanting, and on almost aa large a scale as that ot a similar kind as the Inven tion' Exhibition in London. Each jet thrown from the fountains ia between 30 and 40 ft. high ; the jets assume innu nerable designs, and produce a combination of colours that is perfectly dazzling. The management deserves evary encouragement in its extended enter prise, and certainly no visitor can complain of want of entertainment at the Cycloraina. The 'Ghost of Napoleon' will also be pro duced, and the enterprising Company having the sole right of these, productions rhonld reap an ample reward. 'The Enchanted Fountain' will be produced at the Cyclorama for the Sret time next week.
