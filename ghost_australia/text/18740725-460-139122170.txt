BEVENANT. {FEOJI UACtOLLAS'e HAG AZOTE.) , Yon ask me why at onr first meeting ▲ sodden ttbnness seemed to veil My eyes, and why they shunned your greeting, And why my lips were strangely pale? , Who sees the shade of a lost lover May well be pale for hope or fear; • You seemed a ghost from days gone over When first I looked upon yon, dear. Because, before a word was spoken, And almost ere I saw you plain, I thought ybti her whose heart was broken, The day that mine was snapped in twain. Now, like a ghost let loose bom prison, And strange below the common skies, You see my dead youth re-arisen, To meet the magic of your eyes.
