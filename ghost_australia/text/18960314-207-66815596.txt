To the Editor." Sir,-I crave space for the insertion of the following facts in your paper. hoping that they will both be seen and acted upon by some of our Municipal officers; for this dangerous evil needs eradicating. Within the last month or so, three young children have been kicked ; yes; dangerously kicked by a vicious horse that is still allowed to roam abroad, through the streets of Brunswick,and do as he likes. The first child that was kicked to my knowledge perhaps others before, was someishere about a month ago, the second on the evening of the 29th ult the third last evening Wednesday' and the poor sufferer now lies in the Chil dren's Hospital in a dangerous condi tion. Now, Sir, are such things allo wed to exist. Have we a bye law ag ainst cattle and horses roaming ab out to maim and even kill. Even cattle. take possession of Sydney road at times. Where are the police? Where is the Inspector of Nuisances ?We have one. Is he incompetent? If so let us have another. Or has he more territory to cover than he is able which I think Is the matter on his part then why not get him an assistant, at all costs let us remedy this obnoxious evil. Sir, this is a very serious matter indeed to us who are parents, and should be looked at in a very serious light, for how would you like some little playmate of your child's to come running to your house, with the message, and pointing at the same time to where the poor unfortunate little one lay bleeding, that your little Dick or Ellen as the case may be, has been kicked by the horse that kicked the other children. The- owner of henas-tbas.Jhees_ ecauenle ar.t..mkes... no heed, for the brute Is still like-.. Hlamlet's Ghost roaming about, and gring where he pleases. I sincer ely hope that thisimatter will be venlil ated and eradicated by either the Ins pector or the police, for tte allowance of it is scandalous. I remain AN INDIGNANT PARENT.
