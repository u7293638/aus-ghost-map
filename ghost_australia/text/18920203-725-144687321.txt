WOMEN'S GOSSIP. (From a Laiy Correspondent in Sydney.) The topic on almost every lip of late has been the sad death of the young Duke of Clarence and the woful ending of the joyous hopes of his bride. Although everyone appears touohed by the tragedy, women natu rally take a deeper and tenderer in terest in everything connected with the young lady who occupies bo sin gular and melancholy a position. As betrothed wife of the heir to the em pire, her foot was literally on tbe steps to the throne, and from this, re morseless Death hashurled her, crush ing love and pride with one blow from bis iron hand. So much has been said and written about the projected wedding of the Princess Yictoria that we have been looking forward to it as a revelation ; the looms and handiwork of the three kingdoms were to be oalled into requisition to furnish tbe trousseau ; loyalty was being strained in order to produce something new, something splendid, as emblematic of its devotion. But neither bridal flow ers nor wedding peals will be needed ; faueral plumes and wailing musio are all that tbe nation oan give the dead bridegroom ; except indeed tbe true and earnest sympathy of every kindly heart and every gentle breast in her sad bereavement for her who has been left a widow ere she was a wife. The Women's Suffrage League in England has secured the services of a conservative, Sir A. Bathwick, M.P. for South Kensington, in support of their bill to be introduced Bhortly.in the House of Commons, and tbe hopes of the ' shrieking sisterhood,' as some one irreverently styleB the body, bave gone up accordingly. As the notion had its inception in. the ranks of the most nltra- liberal of the women themselves, it is certainly a victory to have won pver a conserva tive to the cause ; but tbe. Marquis of Salisbury will hardly give in his ad hesion — any way not at so early a stage of theprooeedingB. By the way, the league in Sydney is not doing the work that was expected from it, and'l have heard complaints that the leaders were not quite so active as they might be, and th£f those who promised sup port in a very magnificent way have sinoe considerably modified it. Alto genaer. muuu 01 .hub eninuBiasai seems to have died ont ; bat this is ever the way with anew fad, and no one should be surprised thereat. I have been, expecting to hear of a deputation to Mr. Dibbs on the subject, and am dis appointed tbat it has not taken place. It appears to be quite a recognised thing to ask that unhappy man to jgrant what is reasonable and what ia not reasonable — from supplying tbe people at Broken Hill with hot and cold water baths to flooding the halls of the senate with men who do not wash their hands; and why not fill np the meaeure of his suffering by asking him to grant the franchise to women 9 ?? Perhaps it is not generally known that in London, in fact, in all the great European . centres, the praotioe is largely -ooming. into nse amongst re tail drapers of employing women as buyers, at the wholesale houses, instead of men as formerly. Much 'satisfaction is said to be resulting from the new arrangement, as it is found that women buy with more discretion, taste, .and-, judgment for their, own sex than men. Bargaining is peouli arily . tbe forte, of -women, and no wonder should be felt at their success in a department for,, which they are naturally adapted. Not only in dntpery ^nd . millinery is a woman's jadgment ,aooarate( but in furniture.; anil: adornments ; and as a proof that this is recognised in Bome quarters, I may mention that , the irm . from, winch came the superb furpiture and decorations of the trristed the seleotion of every article in, ttog. fine building :to.;.a woman, .^ho was specially Bent oat for the purpose**. |2pW,8be carrip£ Ant her ..commission s vv-y ivjujiwjr iu j : as it is by far aid^ away thfl gant.fnd the oolonies, r t f&nwnjgiBt;' notioe a alrpng tendeney , to -'wear/. eleBVespfqaii« a different oolpur .and' material fri-,m the nst of the/ gown for . ^plc|/'an^'r/-he//;intl;e^^^^^ ,'%e shftdpiB'jfija^ Itpixi eapjti o%er ,/yhS- plainsTdrt . itiU^oias . its /nwn,; 'anivalthpugh'worh'/ahttle/lpnger than last^eaBpn j it ia stiU/pif .ihe '^oaM.jBampisnUy topanse jbo iticonk - .yehience.'

In no ^ instanoe waB , there : a .leuspioion , of fringe, , whioh seems' to be . as dead // as last year's leaves. The hair was well brushed back off the forehead - and coiled ' high on the head, con siderably higher^than it is worn here. at present, beoausethe direotidnhere is ,/ rather to stick the hair' out' atthe- back of . the head than otherwise.

Of course there are women who will always spoil any ! fashion ; for instanoe, one of six feet or so has no need to pile her locks . right up until she Iende herself the appearance of agiraffe ; instinct should ,. teach her better, but unfortunately it doesn't. The London mode of wear-. ; ing the hair is a.great improvement on ' ours, and in nothing more than in the complete ostracism of the'. -»ngly,. 'bang.' ? A man /while fishing, suddenly foil . into the water. A fellow ? fisherman of benevolent aspeot promptly helped him out, laid him on his back, and then began to scratob his head in a puzzled way. 'What's the^matter ?' asked the bystanders ; ' why don't you revive him?' 'There are sixteen rules to revive drowned persona,' said tbe benevolent man, 'and I know 'em all ; but I can't call, to mind which comes first.' At this point tho reB- - - cued man opened his eyes and said, faintly: 'Is there anything about giving brandy in the rules ?' 'Yes.',, , ' Then never mind the other fifteen,' , ' Some time ago a French waiter was / attending upon a roystering party of -'/' diners in a private room at a London ' restaurant, when an altercation arose, and the waiter, attempting to restore ; order, received a couple of slaps in / tbe faoe. He made no remark at the time, but when he brought in tbe bill there was on it this item : ' Deux sonfflets, £5.' ' As the aggressor , scanned this entry, the waiter set his lips and eaid in a significant tone : r 'If you find those slaps too dear, Bir, I will return them 1' ThiB is unquestionably an age of condensation, bat condensation in literature was surely never carried - farther than in ' Bryce's Thumb English Dictionary ' (JD. Biyce and , Son, Glasgow), whioh measures only about 2^ in., by-lf, and is scarcely Jin. thick.

The ainoant realised by ' Gilbert and Sullivan from their.operas, however, heads the. list of all the ? comes . derived from contemporary theatrical work. Mr. D'Oyley Carte . stated a short time ago tbat the in come last year amounted to £87,000, and that the total sum drawn since 1877 was over one million sterling, of which Mr. Gilbert received as his ; share in eleven years no less than . £90,000. . ' - Colonial dairy 'farmers are to be congratulated on the success of their efforts to supply London with batter (eays a London paper). The large ' shipments now arriving are beating ' Normandy butter in the open market, the secret, of tbe superiority being that the Antipodean produce is all pure grass b.ntter, whereas the bulk' of the continental and home production is that of fodder-fed cows. There is a singing tree in the West Indies, the innsio of which is supplied by the aetion of the wind on ita leaves. These latter have a peculiar form, whioh is effeotual in «ntrapping, the/ Winds.and making them vibrate eo, as to produce varying tones. When the : trade winds blow across forests of these trees, a . constant moaning pf ' fab,' ' me,' pr other fall or half / - tones is kept np, whioh in the. stilly ; hours of the ;hight has an extremely '? Weird effect.' There is also a masioal / tree, a species of acacia, in the Sbudan. ; Ethel—' What do ypu think of Joblot's engagement to Miss Sears/?' }, Jaok— ' He, might, do worse,', Ethel —'He will— he is going to m^1^ her.',, i - jEjinday-Bohopl telpher—' Johnny, ; Wlip was.'the prodigal :ei-n Johnny - ?' went//: ? i^fay a d«Sle ahdoamehapka trajnp^',, VOldFarmer^nd^ ^achihetoijapphoant,^ .plioant:(m^estly)--?,'2am!jhefather1 - sMdi01i^Zthe/5olfcer?i3ay;r$opin^ Horace, aetoniBhed.
