THE BENDIGO GHOST SCARE. ANOTHER APPEARANCE. BENDIGO, Sunday. The ghost scare continues. About 2 o'clock on Saturday morning a constable on duty in View-street was called by a tramway employe, who said that while on his way home past the upper reserve an apparition in white appeared, and stared at him over the hedge. He had a revolver in his pocket, but was too frightened to use it. The constable and a companion searched the reserve, but could find no one, though an examination on a seat near the fence at the place where the figure was alleged to have been seen fresh muddy foot- prints were found.
