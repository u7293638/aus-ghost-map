BACE 'EM. "Race 'em, sir, into form," was the pithy remark of one of the shrewdest little tnrfites in the colonies during a chat last week on recent racing and Cap probabilities. "Run em regular, and. keep running 'em ; they work them selves into form, and get accustomed to racing." These remarks were apropos of one or two wins of late, and the philosophy wrapped up in the idea struck me as worth reproducing. I have more than once called atten tion to the fact that it is good business to follow ' a winning animal, whether hebe hurdleracer, steeplechaser, or Cup candidate, and the theory that nothing gets a horse into such thorough sound condition as racing him with the colours up has of late been veiy clearly exemplified. Most turfites must have frequently noticed that onoe a horee commences to run well to the front in a race he generally improves on his position the more frequently (within reason) he is raced; and. that once a good 'un commences to win he keeps on winning, even though, his weight be slightly increased each time, until a certain limit is reached, or the nag " goes ofi." ' According to the theory of my training friend, a horte who is persistently raced in public soon runs himself into form if, he lie any good at all, and gets fitter in a much less spsce of time thau if prepared on the training ground. The probable explanation of this is to be found in the fact that ; a horse, who is given his lessons in the actual races, gets to know what is expected of him sooner than if prepared solely on the training ground. There is, I consider, a good deal iu this, and the turfite to whom I am referring practises what he preaches. The idea, however, is a somewhat ex pensive one, entry, fees, forfeits, & c., swallowing up nearly all the stakes when a win does come, but in the long ran there is nothing like racing them into form, and then, once fit, keeping them in that con dition, and racing them in anr event in which they have a ghost of a show.
