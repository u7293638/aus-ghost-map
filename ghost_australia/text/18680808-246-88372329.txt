WYNDHAM, (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) THERE is nothing stirring just now but the Shire Council elections. Mr. Davis will have a walk over for the North Riding; but the other two Rlidings will be contested. Mr. Cropley, the lateo representative of the East Riding, has resigned his candidature in favour of Mr. Thomas Sayers, whose return is considered sure; his opponent, Mr. Richard Heath, our Postmaster, not having the ghost of a chance of being at the top of the poll. I am told that the Wyndham correspondent of the Gaurdian, in his last report, says that "it is unlikely that Mr. Kelly will be opposed for the South Riding," and that "it would take a courageous man to face Kelly." It is a pity that the Guardian correspondent is so modest and retir- ing; for I believe if he would allow himself to be nominated in opposition to Mr. Kelly we would have a very keen and close contest; and one, too, in which the Returning Officer would be obliged to use his casting vote, because every one that would poll for Cr. Kelly would like to do the Guardian correspondent a good turn also. But, after all, "courageous" men are not so very scarce, for Mr. Elliot Armstrong has actually had the hardihood to oppose Mr. Kelly, and has very strong hopes of "facing" him successfully. Thurs- day next will end our suspense. There is a rumour current among the electors to the effect that if Mr. Kelly loses this election he will retire to his selection near the Brisbane Ranges and never again take an interest in public affairs at Wynd- ham, but it is to be hoped that this intention will not be carried into effect, as the loss it would entail on the Wyndham folks would be very severe indeed. The crops as a whole are looking healthy, but sadly in want of rain. Our farmers are now getting good prices for their hay in the Melbourne market.
