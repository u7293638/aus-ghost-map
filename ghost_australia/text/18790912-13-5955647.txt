ST. PAUL'S WRITINGS. The Bishop of Melbourne delivered the sixth of his series of lectures on the " Development of Doctrine in the Writings of St Paul, at St Paul's Church, on Wednesday afternoon There was a crowded congrega- tion The Bishop said -A modern writer has said, as truly as strikingly, that it was Israel a great discovery that happiness depended on righteousness The fact is not at first apparent A hasty glance at life would seem to teach the opposite For often we see the wicked prospering The strong and crafty transgressor climbs into the place of power, just as of old the strong heathen nations domineered over Israel Be patient, however observe closely, look at the spirit rather then the outward fortune, and you will discover, as far he did, and rejoice in the discovery, that all the forces in the universe are working in favour of goodness Evil must bring misery, must come to nought If all the people upon earth agreed to unite their whole power for the purpose they could not make a ho prosper, or a wicked deed triumph in the end There are forces mightier than any purpose of our forces stored up in the world and the soul of man forces impinging on us from without and above, that we cannot resist, and it is their office to bring vice to nought and virtue to happiness The thought of this is the strength of a good man s heart In the midst of lying and injustice and self seeking aud malignant oppositions of all kinds, be knows that he shall conquer because all the forces of the world are silently fighting for him, so Ion ' as he labours for righteousnesS It is with lins gave it word of the Old That ment, with ricjitcoujiieas, that St Paul begins his gospel lila great question is How shall man attain to righteousness that is, tion shall he attain to a disposition absolutely conformed to the will of God' you will see at once from the course of this argument that there can be no use in calling a man righteous if he is not be Account him what you please, if he be not really righteous, if his will be not actually cou formed to God's will, he cannot be happy How is it, then, asks St Paul, with the human family how far have they achieved this necessary condition of hap mess ' They have all fallen short of it liner, St Paul considers the case of the Gentiles to them God made discovery of his maid and will through nature and through conscience His wisdom and beneficence shone forth through His works His love and righteous ncES were engraven upon their hearts Each man had a moral oracle in his own bosom Ask to clear and reinforce the utterances of this, there were those mutual questionings by which men accused or excused one another Something at least, then, of God's will the Gentiles knew, but they knew it only to disregard it-only to fall from one stage of moral degradation to another, till at last they lay in that hell of moral corruption described in short in the 1st chapter of the 1 epistle to Romans, and at length in the social records of the Roman empire Nor were the Jews any better True, they had received in the law of Moses a clearer and more explicit declaration of the form and end of moral duty But, as their own Scriptures testified, and their daily lives bore witness, they had only turned their greater height into an occasion of greater con- demnation Wherever then, the apostle turns his eyes whether to those within or those without the covenant-the spectacles the same All have sinned and come short of the glory of God , horse still, all lie under the power of sin, as a habit and propensity of the soul 11 hat, then, it is natural to ask, is the cause of this universal defection and corruption > How is it that men have be universally fallen into sin' To put this question is to raise a thousand ghosts, for over this deep problem the soul of humanity has been dreaming and brooding ever since it came to self consciousness The keenest, brightest, deepest souls, £1930 who gathered into themselves and realised the highest human measures of mental and moral force, have spent themselves on the problem in vain A sinUe step beyond the common deliverances 01 experience not one of them can claim to have taken Philosophy cannot aid us here, but experience may, and it is precisely because St Paul has so deep and large an experience of sin, and the deliver ance from am that he approaches the question with special advantages As we shall presently see, he had struck against the might of sin as it is given to few to atone He knew then its power, and he had been delivered from that power How bad dearer ance come to him' As we saw through union with Christ, through a new birth into a new life He only Lot power to will as God willed by entering into vital union with a new humanity This fact pointed to the solution of his difficulty The will of the flesh came, 111 like manner, from his union with the old humanity He got his evil propensity by inheritance from the first Adam This solution of St Paul n used as we see upon experience, and upon an experience which any man may verify As a matter of fact, we are aware of the existence of our propensities in ourselves, which are inherent, which come to the birth with the first dawning of our consciousness, which are common to 113 and to all men He did inherit them, as a matter of fact, and St Pauls declaration that we inherited them from Adam 13 only another way of affirming that the nature of our remotest ancestor, being marred and stained by sin, reproduced itself, as like breeds like in us his descendants But now having arrived at this point that as a matter of fact, all men are sinners, and are so not only because of their own vicious choice, but also because of their inheritance of a tainted nature , we are met by the great problem of pi' re!,g.Oi.=-hoiv small the sinful be made nguteouB, how shall thesenaual become pare, the false truthful, the selfish loving, the earthly spiritual St Paul knows full well, for he has passed through FSS Great sinister But first, he asks the riUCBu?" win which we are concerned today Can the law deliver us-that law which Jewish zealots would fain land upon the soul of the world for ever I frst St Paul acknowledges that the law is holy and just and good in itself. (1) It is necessary to define am When people declare themselves to be independent of law, it is necessary to remind them that they can only make this claim if they be absolutely unless For so long as evil inclinations exist within, it is possible to mistake these for suggestions of the spirit of God, and so to justify them Some of the most painful experiences of my ministerial life have arisen from this mistake In our sinful condition there is need of some regula outside of us with which we may compare our life, and so distinguish what is of the flesh from what is of the spirit therein The Decalogue is a very rough regula of this kind Better, because more positive, is that spiritual equivalent for the Decalogue which we find in the gospel Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and thy neighbour as thyself Best of all, not only for its com- pleteness and the richness of its spiritual clements, but also for its power of appealing to ourcmotionB, hands of gmngmomentumto our moral purpose, is the Divine example of our Master St Paul does not, however, extend his question to this last form of moral rule, but confines himself to the law written 2 We may observe as another use of the law, that it not only defines what But in, but by its peremptory demand for obedience, awakens in us the sense of em, and thence the sense of need and craving for dearer once, and in this way not less than in its types and ceremonies is our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ But although the law can teach and command it cannot enable us to obey it is weak in itself, and weaker still through the opposition of our own heart It is inherently week For it can only work by means of penal reinforcements, which make their appeal to self interested motive Again, it operates for the most part onlybynegativostatutesthat forbid, and therefore stand over against a sinner rather as his antagonist than as his friend And lastly by its precise legal prescriptions, it brings with it no stimulus, no inspiration, to the emotional nature But principally, as St Paul so powerfully demonstrates in the 7th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, the law is weak through the opposition of the death of Paul divides our human nature into three parts body, soul, and spirit Of these the two former, the body animated by the animal soul are equivalent to what St. Paul calls the flesh. The spirit, the Trueman m man, is that inner spiritual potency of the being which feels after God, holds converse with God, receives communications from God, and is very nearly what people now call the religious consciousness This more spiritual part of man receives the title driven only when the apostle is speaking of believers Elsewhere, as in Romans vi , he calls it Sire, or mind. These two parts one man's nature, the mind and the flesh, have contrary impulses. The one loves the law and desires to follow its precepts, the other, as the seat of sensuous and selfish passions, hates the law as the wild beast hates the bridle Before his conversion ~- and drove like a good Jew to live accoiüV"KAth% Prescriptions of the law.

Be loved it and longed and resolved to keen as? was "a fish rebelled Like a restive steed is tore the bridle from his hand, and dashed away W T on its own wild courses Vain were as' ms efforts and resolves, and equally vain and the biddings and threatenings of the law. Nar, these commandments did but exasperate the lusts within, did but excite them to more determined rebellion, so that the Apostle found the law, which was ordained to life, to be unto death-and actually through the violent resistance of the flesh to become ' his strength of sin " What help, then, was then! in the laws As addressed to a creature so long and corrupt as St Paul was, it did but increase the number and strengthen the mi picture of transgressions By whatever else, then, it was quite clear that not by- the law could any flesh living be just, lied No law could help us What was the use of commanding when we had no power to obey ' What we needed was not orders and threats but a chance of nature I would ask you to observe here the great advance which St Paul has made towards the solution of the problem how can man be made righteous' lie nay precisely defined the obst tele, the domineering propensity of man a evil nature ' He has decisively excluded an imaginary remedy law of any kind, and of course among others the Moe ne. 1 two And here already we trace decided tokens of development It n true that our Say four is id char increased ele irly 119 subjective hindrance to righteousness in He great discourse to Nicodemus In the w 01 is that which is born of the flesh is flesh alone-only " that which is born of the spirit is spirit, he had marked at once the 11 natural helplessness of man, and her need of a new birth into a new life But St John a gospel was published at a late period of the chair ka history, and the absence of such a statement in the Synoptic evangelists indicated pretty clear that it had not passed into that current teaching of the church with which St. Paul was familiar At all events we do not find, even in St John's gospel that the indication of the inward hindrance 13 followed up by a declaration of the laws impotence to remove that hindrance This we in among the things which the Saviour had to reveal it His spirit, the things which the dn replies "(could not bear while He was yet with them. The startled and alarmed way in which some people are receiving these lectures of mine shows how difficult it is to advance in religious matters even one inch beyond the traditional stand point And how impossible, then, must it have been for the disciples, in the rudimentary stage of their faith, to bear the statement that the law was powerless to produce righteousness, that law which they had been brought up to evere and idolised with an awful reverence which it had taken centuries of rabbinical teaching to inspire And even after the effusion of Pentecost, it is only at this early period in the writings of St. Paul that we meet with such decisive teaching Vin Ooaterseo has truly observed that in St Peters speeches and epistles " the doctrine of sin is but little developed As to its origin he does not clearly expressed himself St James, in two short expressions, in Home what more explicit "In many things, he says we offered all, and him, as to the cause of this universal transgression he asks, "From whence come we are and fighting among you and answers, "from your lusts which war in your members These fragmentary expriM aions bare!) indicate that he recognized the great inward hindrance to righteousness, and there is not a word again about the powerlessness of the law to remove that hindrance It is 111 St Paul's writings alone that these doctrines are fully developed and sharply and decisively affirmed Whence then his clearness and certainty) on these matters ' Through what means did the spirit lead him into the truth in respect to them Part), no doubt through the strenuous 66 position of the legal party within the chair it but principally by means of his own deep and peculiar experience Through those terrible struggles, as of a Luther, as of an Augustine, which preceded his conversion and through that might) deliverance which he expects ed in his conversion that out and sudden rom forcement of moral power whereby he was enabled not only to delight in the law of God after the inner man, but also in the Spirit of Jesus to fulfil it And now observe that this experience of the apostle, upon which he based his teaching, is an experience which any of us can verify at any moment He doctrines are credible, not only because St Paul taught them, but because they are founded upon spiritual facts of which any man in the world may have ex 1 science If no miracle had ever been wrought, tine great fact of moral death and this great miracle of moral resurrection, would be as certain as sin and as business 1 or are we not all conscious of the moral death, and conscious, also, that it has existed 111 us since the birth of consciousness ' If only any of you would turn aside from the outward glitter and the duties of life to notice what takes place 111 ) our heart during a single hour you could not doubt it for a moment Would you not observe, in the first place, 1 certain shyness or feeling of recoil from God a desire to hide yourself from the searching glance of the Divine eye from the awful summons of the Divine voice' And what can this mean but conscious guilt and conscious alienation ' Would you not again find a look of disproportion which h strangely ominous disproportion between your desire and your performance, between your ideal and your attainment, between your aa operations after what is high and noble and the actual course of your thoughts and character of your interests ' Would you not again find a disagreement between your practical judgment of what is of most value and the degree of effort which you put forth for the attainment of such things judging for instance that the highest thing in righteous ness, and yet spending the chief part of your strength and effort in mad pursuit of the toys of earth-wealth, name, or evenvamer things than the, areas fashion, amusement, and the notice of the great ' Cut out of the mass of your daily) experience anywhere, one little slice like this, and have you not already in the trouble, disharmony, disproportion, which it reveals, evidence enough of the miserable perversity of the Heal' And how then shall you overcome it > love shall you get power to control the rebellious forces of your nature' Can the enfeebled will be endowed with strength to restrain them' Can the diviner affections, driven to be gained an evil by the impetus of fleshly passion be adequately) reinforced by the flood tide of a new" and a better love ? This rjVie,. tion is of all others f'S most important for if happiness be absolutely dependent on righteousness, and if we be not righteous, and if no law can make us righteous? obviously we must either be content with misery and death, or gain help from some other quarter The gospels great service to humanity is this that it shows us how we may be made righteous, and St Pauls signal service to the gospel 13 tina-that more clearly than any other of the Apostles, he has shown us how by union with Christ this great result is to be achieved Union with Christ can effect the result which law was powerless to accomplish, but the moment we ask, "how this union is to be accomplished this question has the same effect upon that general truth as a prison ban upon a beam of light It resolve it into various coloured elements To trace these elements must be the task of my remaining lectures But now, meantime, take notes this that St Paul a solution of the question, even in its most general form, is, as always, based upon psychological facts Union with Christ did deliver him from the Union with Christ did make him righteous and it has been producing the same effect upon millions of Christian souls through all the Christian ages It is producing the same effect to day ; upon my soul, upon your soul, upon the souls of thousands of emancipated rejoic- ing Christians The effect is patent, it can be witnessed, it can be experienced by whomsoever' will What then has produced these moral transformations, these moral resurrections, it not the passing of Christ into our hearts' There the facts lie before us, like the strata of the earth with their contents, demanding explanation. If St Paul's explanation be rejected, give me another ; another which shall satisfy not the intellect of the worldly critic, but the known and realised experience of the subjects of salvation
