The Doctor's Step-daughters. By C. Stafford, -5~--- CutrTEn II.- (Corz'v?an.) The rain was beating also on the win doe- of the consulting.-roon, snaking Clinton's dark face turn in that direction for a moment. The doctor, with his hands clasped behind, and swaying froml heel to toe, and front too to heel, as he talked, was standing before Clinton, ob. serving, didactically, as he looked np at his friend, "IM'y dear fellow, I own she is a nice child, but she is nothing elsa yet, in spite of her twenty-one years. Her refusal isn't worth two thoughts. Besides, man, shell hls a consanlptive tendency. I ant by tno means sure labont hler chest, istil you ilon't want ita ickly wife--yyou've had fyolr' share of ntlrsiig with your msother'. Look at the suatters with a clear besad, Clinton. She's a nice girl,hut she's mnot the safest investment possible its ia 'wife." Wtshatuever sort of head Clinton faced ilho affair with, he said nothing : lie was uot ta maul, ait iny time, given to lengthy explanations. He was a tall maul, with it deep, pleasant voice, who did not find 00o munlch space inl the silllil! roomsi for his large, easy way of moving. He half let drop and thou caught agsin a stick he carried, lmade it sign ill the direction of the upper part of the house, and asked, " Will she be at the Lavingtonas' to-night " The doctor expressed hinmself incoil petent to give a reliable answer. "All right," said Clilnto, putting his long legs in motion towards the dour. " You won't come oup, and--hl u-.s-face "'. out?" said the doctor. "No," said Clinton, shortly, as he 'tarried himself out. "'1'Ta.ta, Morris; glad you've crossed the Itubicon with ler, on your own account. 1Bad ten minutes, oil ?" Tile doctor gave sin indescribable sound in reply, Clinton passed out into the street, and the doctor turncd into his own premises Igain. The rain had stopped, and Clinton crossed the road under tile arch of at beiautiful rainbow. IIHe looked up at it, and' saw four girls at the window above also looking sip at it. His darkl eyes instantly singled out one face in the group. As if by some electric influence 'lle lowered her eyes at that moment, 'and met the glance, a flash of regretful meaning inl it, sninaging to imake itself understood by her. Clinton raised Iis "hat and passed on. ''imle turned rosy red, Frances put her lips close to Tina's car, whispering, " You do care for him.," .Tina shook iher head anrd turned away, " want it cup of tea-tea, not tnttssis, 'you know; it munstn't stand more than .two ninutes. I went into the drawing. room, bat found no one there." It was .the doctor who was speaking, coming ill Ssmiling and dclpper. Whatever was Ihis anger when he left Tins, there were no ssigns of it now, its lie perched himself oni a sealing-wax red milking.-tool in the neigllbourhood of a stand on which :was cake, ,c., and began to help hint. -self. -T. l'orwa he ee a nptlbbletblc flle i Iamongnt the girl'F,ilwanting to servco hinm atonce. u"Light the lamlp under the kettle. Where's the teapot dSusanl Ibrought up the blue one with the teat ready ill it," The doctor sat serene, in the middle of thile uiclhe. Tins was the only girl who did nothing, though the doctor nodded to hers in all exasperatingly friendly mannier. The commotion had raised Jack's -spirits to such an extent that straight w vay, if anybody else's voice was to be heiard, it wais necessar,? that Jack should .be submlitted to tho discipline of having it dark cloth thrown over Iis cage, and Tina oceupied herself witl this act of public benevolence. "Are you going with sme to the Lavinlgtons' to-night, or have I to carry your excusesP" asked tile doctor, looking across at hler alain. \- H low can I?" she asked, looking shyly roaid, "like thisP" 'I'ina's habit of violent crying, when 'the world was not going well, with its subsequent result of change in her ap. pleariance, was well known ln the house. hold.

"I should, perha'lps, begin crying -gain if I went.' There was a chores of inpatient S011's 1" from.thlie others. The doctor 'felt,'from something in the air, that lihe was not, as lie put it, " going to have sany trouble with the rest; "a nrl,perlhalps, ,in proporltion, experienced all the more ,,1anni oyance with the member of Iis a'"miy who was neither entertained bIy, ar i s t present entertaining to, nny Iody.," Then I will certainly take carse you ire -not my fello..gueat," hle said, ""shuply, -in a :tone which broughblt. ai Scemhlseconce of 'the scene dowllstaihls, Tinhu was tired and unnervetd.

It was like a bombshell dropped in the place.

Out of the tail of his eye lie saw the four girls he was not imnuediately addressing interchange a sort of "Cian I believe my cars?" glince, anod Frances and the Chinee at once proceed to fold themselves, an it were, round the irritatingly hysterical person to who hlie had spoken. If that gimerack stool undier him could at a thought have been turned into :t witch's broomsticek, the chimney would certainly have borrs in request as an outlet for an injusred step.father. Matters at this point, however, were made a little better by Frances's turningS her head rounid and olserving, in it loull whisper:" 'We none of is are liking its but if you will let us be, we shall ill come round. We will all tryf to do right." " She's not t ying to do right," said the doctor, not iable to dispose of his feeling of having been dealt with unjuistly at a moment's notice.

The doctor was tickled-so much so, that he involuntarily obeyed by throw. ing his head back with a hearty laugh t laugh in which his ears tol hlim five listincet giggles joined.

The girls had beltaken them. selves to the draswing.roouu, by this time, and when the doctor looked iin there to say, jauntily, tlhat lie was " going," it struck Frances that he wasa arrying oust her instructions to be sleasnlt -v ltlh -plnfln I thorou ghllness; inti was seated at a quaint, in. r laid writing - table, which, some. how, in its severe daintiness of line, seeied to resemble herself.
