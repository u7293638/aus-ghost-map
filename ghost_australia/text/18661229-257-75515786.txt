IVriians he will have the uld laws asain renewed ; if be does, I should advise him not to forget the nil Eriic law, fixing a price on every man's life according to his rank in society. By this meitia he could ,oet clear of a good few of bis ene mies without much trouble. The best thing Patrick can do is to give up his Fenian ideas and try some other theme, as the people of Tooivootnba bare a vast deal more tiense than lo be set at enmity by tbe chatter ing of a parrot with euch dull plumage on it.
