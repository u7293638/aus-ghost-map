A GENTEEL LOAFER. I'm a regular lazy, loafing chap. And I idle my time away; For months I've not earned the ghost of a rap, But for meals I have nothing to pay. How do I live? Why, quite well on the cheap, On what a poor widow can spare; A room in her house she allows me to keep; Her daughter waits on me-I haven't a care. So I puff my pipe, And my lips I wipe, When the food I've not worked for I've eat, And I laugh in my sleeve, While I make them believe Employment each day I am striving to get While sillies I find who'll give me their best Attendance, and bed and board, My wife and my child-what an excellent jest To support, why. I cannot afford. So I sponge on the widow, her daughter befriend, For my shelter, washing, and prog, And freely I spend ev'ry shilling they'll lend On theatres, tobacco, and grog. Then my lips I wipe, And I puff my pipe, When my dinner Pve eaten at their expense; For the older I grow, The more truly I know Work doesn't suit men of genteel pretence. NEANTHES.
