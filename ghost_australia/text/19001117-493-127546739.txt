Oom Paul's Prayer. (In homespun, with apologies t) Burns,) Br J. Macnab. Oh Lord, thou kens, I'm fair disgusted— God and the Mauser weel we trusted. But now that weapon's worn aud rusted, To thee I raise My voice : — Let chaos be adjusted, Thee then I'll praise. Confound, oh Lord Sir Radvers Buller, ? And keep him scout o' gear and siller, . May his great shadow ne'er grow fuller, Gie him a hnaet. ? Or leaden pill — a downright killer j Mak' him a ghost. And, Lord, remember tbat B.P., The sleepless wolf — so slim iB he And fu' o' tricks — Oh let him dreo Thy lee-lang ire : ? A lasting faggot let him be In Satan's fire. There's Kitchener, the cold and ciuel— Although in Britain deemed a jewel— ; 1 Gie him nae water for his gruel, : But gar him thirst; He then will bs the drier fuel For pit accurst. And Labby, Dr. Clark, and a', Whose motto was 'Gie Joe a fa',' ? May they be 'egged' iu every ha' Wherein they speak ; Lord, inak' that blethering crew sing sma* And eat the leek. The leek that Joseph on them forces— ' 1 An act that all the world endorsee — Bat Joe himsel'— let Pluto's horses Awa' him carry Eyeglass and a' to Styx's sources, Aye there to tarry. And General Roberts — little sinner— Whom I could gobble at a dinner, In thia wai-gama he's still tbe winner, Stay Thou his hand ; Ana mak' him double quick a pinner From out our land. But if what's bad becometh worse, Let oil my foes endure Thy curse, Tbe dnvil'* dam ha' them to nurse — The arrant villains — But of Thy grace, save me my purse And all its millions. Aud Lord, be kind to Taut and me, And gnide ub safely o'er the sea, Remote and hidden let us be Frao Britain's ken, , Tho glory shall be a' to Thee— Amen, Amen.
