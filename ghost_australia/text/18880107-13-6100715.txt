THE AUSTRALIAN IN ASIA AND EUROPE. ss Br J. H. BLOCKADED I A king of olden time offered rewards for new sensations Of such, to him, would have been travelling on a cable tramway or going up in a balloon, and of such to a traveller is a time in a besieged city High runs the excitement in Athens as day by day more is felt of its siege trouble-a trouble which increases daily as of a wound inflaming The people seek the streets for converse and comfort, and crowd in the open places, here called Platina, where tables and chairs are set about as the rest for the weary the unwary may seat themselves here to find only that they are quickly pounced upon by a cafe, attendant 'lbs chairs are private property, and a cafe keepers rights in Athens extend to all of the sidewalk and ball of the roadway-say, 20ft out from his front door step to judge by the way his tables and chairs are spread forth These altered doings thoroughly follow Greek fashion Ans'otle taught in the open, and in the peripatetic way of a Collins street stockbroker Socrates similarly cajoled and confounded those whom be met in argument, drawing an assemblage round him like Bourke street bookmakers Old Athens, however, collected street crowds not to job shares or to book bets The brain moved the ancient Athenians more than the pocket They came out to hear the doctrines of the philosophers expounded to know what the cynics, the Stoics and the Epicureans had to teach They sought knowledge in this way, having no newspapers to supply it otherwise. The crowds now about the streets talk politics and seek war news only The discussion are much helped by the out of door situation People can discourse loudly in the open air, and the better inflate their lungs the blood then circulates, and the tongue wags more freely The cognac which is "one,; about helps also to lubricate articulation This favourite tipple comes to one in a small glass accompanied by a tumbler of water sufficient to drown it in Now comes an experience of beetroot sugar, of which some lumps are brought with the liquor This stuff is as close grained as plaster of Paris, and may be mistaken for cement. To follow AthLman fashion, the sugar is to be put into the water and its dissolution there awaited-which takes thrice the time of cane made sugar 'J ne cognac is then to be swallowed solus, with gulps of the sugared water to follow After several of these refreshers the Athenian feels more patriotic, and equal to any argument with anybody The Platia Concord is that to which most resort is made. It is seen at its fullest on Saturday afternoons. The scene is then enlivened with the presence of provincials, come marketing in their special variety of dress. Conrade knows by this outward show whence the wearers came, as a Scotchman would tell the tartans of the Highland clans. This one is from Boetia, that from Albania, and the other from Corinth , a fourth is from Sparta, and his companions from Naupha or Lu adds This war time is that also of press " I extra ordinaries anything does for news in these feverish days. An issue of the daily journals comes out merely to announce that the Premier has declared that he will not resign while he can find a majority of even one only to support him an announcement received with loud cheers Further inquiries and Conrade s replies tell me something of the Greek constitution King Georges is a thoroughly sensible monarch-satisfied to take his Bular), to reign and not to govern The Parliament consis s of but one House, having no less than 240 members. Greece returns one member to this Assembly for every 10,000 of her people The Democrats, who are the Jingoes here, are in the majority The soldiery have been armed and equipped for months past, waiting on the border of the disputed territory in sight almost of the T Turkish troops Two or three millions of money may possibly be spent over this war movement, because that Delijanms has, in horse) language, taken the bit in his teeth, and has a majority to help him in his Quixotic project From Platia Concord and its politics I wander after dark to the Angora, or market place, taking a tramway ride by the way It is Saturday evening, and the market as lively as markets are elsewhere at such time The butchers are seen to be quite artistical in the decorations of their joints. Leaves and flowers do not, however, suffice them for such purpose Dutch metal and tin foil are called in aid, and look queerly, seen upon legs of mutton Here, again, in the clothiers shops are all the dressy order mentations which I have been aforetime admiring-the Cozzi adornment for the head, and the rosette toed shoes I may invest in these as occupying little space as luggage, and suitable for fancy dress ball adorn ments Overshadowing this Angora, and its business and bustle of the present, is a portentous relic of the past This is seen in a magnificently large gateway)- grand in its deeds) It looks as ancient as it is possible to conceive a building to be his four large Doric columns are of marble, blackened u> age, but at well supporting their entablature It was at this gate that Socrates argued and St Paul preached when the popular resorts were otherwise occupied or the night not sufficiently moonlighted Old 'Temple Bar, dominating ITeet street teas but mushroom like in comparison with this grand old gateway . And near to it is an octagonal shaped tower equally) as ancient in look It iii Known as the Temple of A cluster lower of the SW India Its exterior is illustrated by eight figures cut in relief upon the sides A. particular wind is being blown out by each figure those of east, went north, and south being supplemented by her' eastern, sea western, and the bite A weathercock, in a triton a shape, finished off the top of this tower for further and better illustrating the way of the wind The largest of sundials is to be seen upon this temple, and the traveller of to day may tell the hour b) it now as car farm) as once did Xenophon and Alex blades. It is such things as this old gateway and this ancient temple that M ve one pause amidst all else which is around and about The t pictures one rubs shoulders with are forgotten altogether when these ghosts of a Bygone greatness comes into view Ino thousand years roll away as a scroll, and the Athens of the past and of our school day knowledge lives once more around one The eyes are open, but Hce nothing, and the wits go wool gathering for awhile when these bits of antiquity so knock one out of the present, time Within this temple of tilt winds stood a a water clock by which the ancient Athenians told the hour when the outer sundial failed to do so This 'horological must have been much frequented of cloud) and rain) dayS, of which Greece has many I may judge of that much by experience of its clouded and cold weather during my time in its capital Conrade points out some ruins as being the remains of the monastery in which Lord Byron lived Of course, there maybe as Archbishop Whately dimonMrn'ecl, in his historic doubts about Bonaparte, is much doubt about things sixty years old us about those of three thousand This occurs to one when told this Byron had lived in a monster) Of all men whom we can associate in memory with such a residence Byron seems, us the least lil e.

His verse w never visible when holding the printed broadsheet, as he does in both hands, close to his face. I wait patiently until this red-hot patriot has digeste 1 the news, as I have to read with his eyes. It is well to do this occasionally that one may realise what the blind have to endure, and what is suffered by those to whom, as Dogberry will have it, reading and writing have not come naturally "What is the news ' ' I ask "News enough now, a blockade is threatened 1 " A what " "A blockade The men of war of all nations in the bay are to do for us what the German troops did when they surrounded Paris " " Then I shall starve here, be fed on horse flesh as the French were, or eat of dogs and rats as the Chinese do in Canton ' "That will come if we are blockaded-such is only threatened at present " This comes of Dell) annis' obstinacy in not disarming He has brought down the anger of the European powers upon himself Athens and all (Greece. ' Achilles' wrath to Greece, the direful spring of woes un numbered,' is as nothing to what Greece will get now What was Achilles and his wrath to those half dozen or more of ironclads any one of which could have towed all of 'I roy out to sea.

Al' business and the thoughts of it 50 to the wall for the rest of this momentous first day of the news. Not for 59 years has such a commotion as now exists been seen here The like of it has not occurred since that eventful October in 1827, when the battle of Navarino destroyed the Turkish power then dominant here The combined powers now holding Greece back as by a chain then did for her what she could not do for herself In that great day for Greece no less than 214 ships were either captured, sunk, or disabled in a few hours, and the Turkish fleet thus utterly annihilated Greece then saw a day of triumph for itself on its western shore, such as old Greece saw in long ages past on its eastern shore a day, indeed, which Byron should have lived to secures a solace to one who wrote " It's something the dearth of fame, Though linked among a fettered race, To feel at least a patriot s fame, Even as I sing, suffuse or) face, For what is left the port here for Greeks a blush-for Greece a tear ' 13) ron would not say that much now could he see the Palaces I'latia and Concord, and hear what is said in them there are no blushes and no tears with the patriots hereabout Not a tear among them I It is all swear with them now, and a hat they swear at ia the action of the combined powers, and their ships in the bay I have to hear England and Mr Gladstone's Government spoken of in very disrespectful language And as old Pep va would write, " So home and to bed, that I may hear no more of it." We are blockaded now the threat is carried out I ' is what I hear first thing next morning I hear much else of course, but that is not to the point, nor is most of it reportable he combined powers had made no idle threat, but had been as earnest in their work as when the Pickwickian baron asked for his boots The anxieties of yesterday were over now-the fever had ended and the we first was known 1 he ironclads outside represented the mutes guarding the door, and told plainly enough how things had gone " Blockaded ' is a word to be repeated many times before all of it is understood It is companionable with "Besieged" and 'Beheaded," and of the same family Later on I may more fully) realise it A family with "the brokers in the house" realises the full effect only when the furniture is sold off, and they are turned house less into the street. The whole extent of dreadful things is comprehended only by degrees. I think of the journal of the " Besieged Resident in Pan-,, so pithily written by Labouchere, and wonder if any thing so dreadful as he tells of is in store for the Athenians Athens is not, however, a walled city, na is Paris and Greece is straggling and long, and has many vwucrwnja about it, to which to get and away by which to go seems as an easy thing On m) suggesting that much to a new I) found friend he squelches my hopes by Biijing-" All the ports are blockaded in addition to that of Pir cus IS of vessels can land anything any where, and none will be allowed to leave ' "Pooh, pooh, stuff and nonsense look at the map ' Who cares about portal Greece is all seashore and outlying islands there are v all(i(es and villagers, and boats to be had for hire, then there are horses and carriages, and the land of Greece is part of Europe ' ' "fry to leave in those ways, and you II find yourself stopped both by land and water ' My new ft and friend IB a telegraph agent specially deputed here for the crisis He is an Englishman, and was Iratcrnmc as country men It is full day among the founts of in formation, and seems to live upon the suction of them, and upon the telegrams which he is always either sending or receiving The resident correspondent of 'The minimises introduced by him and proves to be, of all people, a learned American The information 1 get from -""-1- sc trees I may take, us I do without further unique), and give up all idea of getting, away as suggested I am thus reduced to the position which is notable Australian politician described as under the heel of an thority which is the position also of a pig under a late We don't value our liberty until we find it interfered with, and then chafe at the slightest restriction To make the best of it I have to recall the fact that I have not come to Greece to run away from it in a hurry the land I have come to see a open for all inspection The patriotic' race and the blockade made by the Powers will not interfere with my intended part in the matter I am getting too much absorbed by the Greece of to day) and the nonentities of it. The Greeks who should dwell in our thoughts are those known to the world at large for ages past As iron words It Tis but the living who are dumb " here. By that I may perceive that Byron was as troubled as other people about modern Greek Dumb enough he Athenians will seem to one who has to understand them solely by an interpreter's aid. " Come along then I let the world was, we shall ne'er be younger, let's go to the Aero polis, to the Ihssus and Cephissus, to Eyes betters, to the Temple of Theseus, to Mars' hill, or the house of lemon to the great company they bring to mind-a company living for ever in the Land of the Unforgotten Come to the things unchangeable, and leave politics Remember what was said half a century or more ago to the Greeks, and hear how aptly the words apply to present circumstances " Trust not for freedom to the Franks , They have a king who had a and sells. In native swords and native ranks The only hope of courage dwells For Turkish force and Latin fraud, Vi would break your shield, however broad " Byron was as much prophet as poet when he wrote what," BEAR my friend of the telegraph "He was Pericles and Alcibiades combined so far as intellect went, and was all the Greek poets rolled into one if Homer be left out of the list Such qualities drew him naturally to Greece, for which he strove to do what he was not to see completed, but what was done in a revolution, of which he was as the Rousseau He left his spirit here with his bones, and the first remains, though the latter have been removed "Over the grave of Childe Harold, Greek maidens shall weep, With those of the bravest and best, His name shall co down to the latest of time, Fame tell how he fought for earth. loveliest chime, And mercy shad blot out the rest. War times will excite everybody, even to hard headed telegraphic correspondents Conrade seems loth to leave the busy streets and their war talk, but duty calls him, and business means breadwinners I shall, I know, have much war and politics mixed up with the history of today, but it would likely be the same whatever Greek kept company with me Such things must be borne by those who will travel in strange places "I shall have a life of it, I know," said a friend of mine, who was going into matrimony in company which I warned him would not always be pleasant to him "but I'm in for it and can't help it I am in for it in the like way, but fortunately not for life though what may come of the blockade cannot be foretold We go in a direction towards which modern Athens has not yet spread, and are soon at the Arch of Hnilnan-mnrktng the entrance into that Uadrianopohs which the Romans built here, and of which nothing but this gate now remains Curious inscriptions appear upon either side of this archway indicating a difference of opinion about it On one side appears what Comrade translates to me thus) This is Athens, the ancient city of Theseus." On the other side of the arch appears, "This is the city of Hadrian-not that of T Theseus " I had seen nothing like this save the inscriptions on a tavern at the Land's End in Cornwall, where on I read on one side, "This is the last house in England, and on the other, "This is the first house in England The spirit of the inscription there is not exactly in that way, but it was men of Hadrian, emperor as he was, to adopt the style of "Short is your man, not Codlin the which he has evidently done Some little distance from this Hadrian's Gate we are upon open ground, upon which, of modern work, there is but a little cottage, used apparently as a rude, countrified cafe Of that which is of the past there is, however, something great to see in what remains here of the temple of the 61) mean Love In solitary grandeur the IG Corinthian columns, of over 60ft in height and 7ft in girth, are great indeed Moore's lines on some remains of the like kind immediately recur to one *' Whose lonely columns stand sublime Flinging their shallow s from on high, Like dials which the wizard Time Had raised to count the ages by " The sentiment of Moore's verse is exactly realised by the grandly tall columns here to be seen by what remains may be judged of what has gone. An enormous structure of 000ft, long by nearly 200ft. in width was what might have been seen here in ages past some hundreds of years before our era. Of such columns as I now look upward at there were then JO 'The blocks upon which those remaining yet rent measure eight and a half feet on each side. if he grandeur of these pillars is realised when sitting upon one of these pedestals and looking up at the column above it and those around-towering, when thus seen, seemingly), to the skies These columns are all of the marble of Mount Pentheus, and great must have been the labour to bring such material thence. AS lately as 1700 the Turks, then in possession here, took the seventeenth column away for building materials for a mosque So to do saved the trouble of fetching marble all the way from the Mount. "They will have the other IG columns away, Conrade, when this blockade is over and the Powers let them loose upon your" This is by way of comfort to the poor chafing patriot, "No, they won't! Would to God the Powers would let us alone You would see then of what stuff the modern Greeks are made ' ' It does one good to keep poking Comrade in the ribs in this way The patriotism of the man then exudes from him like perspira- tion If all of his people are like him the Turks would likely have some trouble They deserve to have it, too, for turning such magnificent ruins as what I now look upon into a quarry for building their mosques Jina temple was begun before those on yonder Acropolis, and took nearly its long to finish RS did the Cathedral of Cologne Jupiter Olympus was great in those days, and no trouble and expense was too great to be taken in his honour Our temple building may) be laughed at in 5,000) ears time much as we smile at the honours thus paid to the gods of the ancients It is a mad world, my masters," and man is he who looks upon it otherwise From Jupiter's temple the walk is a short one to the banks of the Ihssus I only know that I am on a river's bank by Conradc'o in formation There is nothing to show that much in the way of water The whisper ing stream" of missus, as Milton called it, has now sunk from its whisper to utter silence.

" No Australian buried here as yet, I sup- pose'" is what I ask of Conrade. "Not yet, that I know of," he says, "We hope to have that-," but I stop the rest of his speech, as I am fearful he may say "pleasure" less 1 English is good, but he sometimes misused words Only yesterday he said " idiot " instead of " aristocrat," He does not like correction, and when I set him right he said, "Well, It's much the same" by which I saw that his understanding was not quite clear upon all matters
