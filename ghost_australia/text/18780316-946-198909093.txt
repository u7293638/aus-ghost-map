_ ;?', HKENANIS GHOST. Thebest bit wc'hfwe renrV 'iov months in . a.Yankee paper, is the reviv.nl of the ghost1 oi'-ia departed- pugilist :— ' The fthost of a once'' famous- pugilist, Ji C. f-Tennan, was mittQrialis.c3.iri Rochester, Now York, ashor timeago. Bochestiir is famous as the place where the Fox sisters firsi; startled the world : With ghostly.sights and sounds. The echoes : of-.theraps .heard in a mysterious cellar in i the city of Rochester, nenrly thirty years' ago, have been echoing round I he world ever since that time, nnd nro still marching- on. Otcourse-phostly visitors in Rochester are more demonstrative than they are in. almost any other place. The raps are louder, more deraonstra'ive and-.as the headquarters of the gieat army of spirits is located there, the materialism must of course be well de veloped. When Meenan appeared therefore on the night in question, he was a muscular and frisky ghost. His form was stalwart asit was in life. He stood erect, with bis head thrown slightly backward and chest expanded. His arms appeared largo, and his musclo3 stood out like whipcords. There-wnsabright light in the ghostly eye, and as ho bounded on the platform his step wasasjfiruiiand ngileYasXtbiat df a panther.
