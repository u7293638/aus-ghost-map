Not Proud of her Coutltrymanu , SAt Joass, of Gold Hill, who dearly loves a joke, has a domestic in his house who is a countrywomanof SBullivan. Thoother morn. ing he and Evan Williams were eating break. fast, when, by a preoneenrted ogreement, they began:a dialogue something like this, Sam loading off " Curious, ain't it, that Sullivan took water from that Detbhmas ?'" "Yes indeed ;,was quite astonished., He soemed perfectly cowed." . " Well, I don't blames him. Hans is a big man and strong as n bull, and I guess he ean lick any two" men in the world, John in. eluded." " Phat's that, Mister IJones?" broke in the domestic,- wh? had been hovering about the table, "a lotolhinia lick 'John Sullivaul ro yo eray orb dreaming, Mister Jones?" It's a fact," said Williams. "Haus Meyer, forman of the No. 2 crosscut, Grown Point, deposited 00" dols. forfeit to meet Sullivan, and when hoe saw our man he weak. ened and lot the money slide." The domestic dropped a china plate oh the floor, and stood speechless. "He breaks' all his rock with his fist," broke in Sam, "and runs the steam drillby hand. We pay him 12 dole. a day just lot the steam he saves. Sullivan happened to come in when he was making birdseye porphyry with his fist, and I'm blamed if be didn't turn pale as a ghost." \- " Mr. Jones, if Mr. Evan Williams says this I'd belave him, but as you say so it wouldn't go. There must be some mishtakoe about his bein' a Dutchman." "He is a Dutchman," eaid Williams, gravely, " or else I don't know a Dutchman wnen I see him.". "Thin, gintlemen," replied the domestic, drawing herself up a couple of inches higher, " all I've got to say is that John L. Sullivan's no Irishman, and don't spake of him as one in my prisonce."-Carson (Nev.) Appeal.
