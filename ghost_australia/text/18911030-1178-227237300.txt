OAR AND SAIL. The Double Bay Regatta will bo held to morrow afternoon, and the committee liavo mado the most completo arrangements as far as steamers, &c.;, are concerned. Tho programme bus now been issued, and this Bnows a. capital number or entries for each event. Tho A.U.S.N. Co.'s steamship Wurrego is tho flagship. Tho next race of the Botany Sailing Club will he held on Saturday, November 14. A committee meeting of tho Johnston's Bay Sailing Club was held at Leach's Com mercial Hotel on Tuesday evening last. Tho commodore, Mr. F. Donovan, presided. After usual business had been dealt with most satisfactorily tho protests in last Saturday's race were duly considered, and after a deal of discussion it was unanimously decided to disqualify the both boats that completed tile courso, viz., Edith and Thomas Punch, and re-sail the race on Saturday, Noveinbor 14, as these boats did not com ply with tho rules of the club, which ap- pourcd to have been a misunderstanding on tho ownors' part. This being a small boats' raco no steamer will follow. A competitor on ono of the boats on Satur day last in tho first raco of the Sydney Flying Squadron Yacht Club thus explains the cause of the capsizing of tho Ghost after she had completed her first heat:â€” "The capsizing of the Ghost was preferred by hor captain to causing sorious dam- ago to the Wild Wave, or perhaps a fatal accident to one of her crew. Tho Wild Wave, which was not racing, caino round tho bow of a vessel at anchor, and was bearing down before the wind on tho starboard tack. Tho Ghost was in tlio right, and could have run tho Wave down. Had Mr. Thomas jibed his muin3ail it must have at least caused a scatter among the crew on tho Wave, even if tho boom had not smashed all beforo it in the swing. Mr. Thomas kept farther and farther off to pro- vont a collision, and tho Wave boat came on until getting under the gunwulo of the Ghost caused tho latter to capsize."
