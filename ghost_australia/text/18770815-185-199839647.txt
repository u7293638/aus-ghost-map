A* number o'f gentlemen interested in yachting inspected, the craft on Monday, and but one opinion was expressed by experts—that Mr Hines has,; succeeded' Tin turning out a boat that '|fpr;.model and power will bear favorable comparison to anything yet afloat of her class in Victorian waters.- The Victoria is 23 feet in length between perpendiculars, and 22 feet on the keel,.,'with 7 feet 4,inches beam, and. a depth of 2 feet 4 inches.
