To tits Editor of tub Northern Arqub. Sib, — In your contemporary'e issuoof -ltli inst., liisro port of the Hospital Oommittoo meeting for elootion o' a wardsman and inutron, statos that McMulkin was formorly look-up keeper, and is woll known, but not ono word about bis or his wife's skill in attonding the eiok, or thnt they had (indood any training, iu hos pital or out of it, fitting them for suoh a trust. Now tlio grounds upon which I and fivo otliors of the Committco voted for Cliff nnd his wife for tho situ ation were — that Cliff had two years and threo months ozporienoe as wardsman in tlio Sydney hospital, and holds Dr. Howson's certificate for sorvico, and that Mrs. Cliff was ton years in the eamo hospital as nurse, and holds cortificato from the late Mrs. Ghost, matron for many years of tho samo hospital. I now wish to know upon what grounds oven a respectable lock-up keeper and wife are votod into such a trust, to the exclusion of others bearing equally good moral character, their testimonials for skill thrown asido as so much wusto papor. Tho Hnlligan murder is cxtonding in its ramifications to soauro a situation for ono distniBsod from the police iu connection with that murder, the hospital hns boon deprivod of tho servicos of a wardsman aud matron of tho very best characters for competency and worth. Whon such a misfortune can befall a charitablo insti tution, verily there is something rotton in tho Btnta of Denmark. . WM. JAGER. Doe. 6th, 1809.
