LIFE IN LONDON AND THEREABOUT. j (C_tcyjiicLBD Dr HEN-HT LOOT.) LORD MAYOR'S DAY Sat ANDREW C_I~C-MB. GLADSTONE IN GHOST_-S-I>-HOW THEY BBOCOIIT THE. NEWS room WATERLOO. WESTMINSTER, Nov. 10. After yesterday's proceedings by day and night it seems as if the great festival of Lord Mayor's Day were in the last stages of dealing Nothing could have been flatter than the procession through the streets, unless it were the banquet at Guildhall A few years ago, when Sir William Harcourt threatened the corporation with extinc- tion, a great effort was made to entrench the Lord Mayor and aldermen in popular esteem behind the bravery of a 9th of November show Bigger sums than over were lavished on the spectacle, succeed- ing Lord Mayors vieing with each other in points of magnificence and originality The weather was often against the full sucess of the enterprise, and the people crowding the streets sim end in sympathy as lightly clad damsels, personifying Peace and Plenty, were slowly driven through the fog and sleet of a November day Still the crowd were there, and all the ordered business of the day gave place to the Lord Mayor's procession His gilded coach drove through the streets on a car of Juggernaut, trampling down everybody else's arrangements For several years this rivalry pro railed Last year's show was not without its special distinction Yesterday's performance dragged down to the lowest plane of the common- place, which was the greater pity, since by exception the streets were flooded with sunlight The item in the programme upon which the new Lord Mayor chiefly prided himself was three camels led by turbaned grooms, Arabs from the neighbouring desert of Whitechapel The camels were laden with large bags that looked like gigantic pillow-cases, and, according to the programme, contained rich merchandise of spices Unfortunately the connection between the white bags and the laundry was too obvious, and what should have been the most effective part of the procession was blighted as it passed along by the wicked story that this was the Lord Mayor's washing going home The banquet at night supplied no compensation to the new Lord Mayor for the disappointment attendant upon the procession Time was when the Premier of the day, accompanied by all his ran equal colleagues in the Cabinet, graced the Lord Mayor's board on the 4th of November, and usually made a point of complimenting the city by making it the < earliest confidant of some secret of high State policy Last night Mr Gladstone had himself excused, an example followed by Lord Rosebery, Sir William Harcourt and all the more popular members of the Government Not as far back as memory goes has a new reign at Guildhall been inaugurated amid such depressing circumstances Mr Gladstone has, naturally enough, keenly felt the death of Sir Andrew Clark To Mrs Gladstone the loss seems even more irreparable For many years he has been her counsellor and ally in her infinite care and watchfulness over the health of her husband. It was said at Sir William Harcourt's on Wednesday that a curious illustra- tion of the magnitude of the loss has already presented itself Mr Gladstone is bent upon attend- ing the funeral of his friend and doctor Pressure is being put upon him which will probably result in his abandoning his intention The only thing that moves him is the reminder that if Sir Andrew Clark wore alive he would promptly and peremptorily veto the project It would be curious, indeed, if Mr Gladstone's disregard for the axioms of Sir Andrew Clark should lead to any serious consequence following upon his attendance at the funeral of his old doctor Someone with time hanging heavy on his hands would do a public service if he were to j compile a record of valuable lives shortened by attendance at funerals Happily, Mr Gladstone I is gifted by nature with rare invulnerability against the principal danger attendant at the graveside If he had his choice he would like the Bluecoat boy, as soon go about the streets bareheaded as not He takes ei ory opportunity on his public appearances and progresses to sit or stand bareheaded In one of the Midlothian campaigns, I very well remember standing by him whilst he addressed a crowd at some railway station curiously watching the flakes of snow fall on his barn gate and slowly melt He told me afterwards he had not noticed it was snowing, and mix er got cold in any w cattle by going about without a hat But, that was a dozen years ago, which makes considerable difference after four score Dr Clark was one of the best known men in London, as was testified by the procession of callers when it was made known that he was ill. He was a regular diner-out, and one could not help noticing that he did not insist with respect to himself upon that strict abstention from champagne and various rich meats which he imposed upon his patients Like most of the fashionable doctors of the day Sir Andrew, rarely prescribed medicine, the basis of his curative practice being shot Among the many stories told of him is one that has the advantage of being true Visited by a well-known member of the House of Commons he, after the usual examination, gave him minute instructions about his diet, and as a last word added, " And one cigar after dinner mind, one cigar " The patient returned at the end of a weak looking on the whole a little worse " Did you follow my instructions " asked Sir Andrew " To the latter," said the patient " I hope you didn't forget what I told you about the cigar You rather look as if you had been exceeding the quantity " " On the contrary," said the patient, " one made in i so ill that I had no inclination for any more , I never smoked in my life before" The loss, doctor, accustomed to begin by cutting down the smoking allowance of his patients, quite forgot to ask whether this particular one smokes Falling in the House of Commons last night, Mr. Gladstone let fall one of those casual remarks .Ahiohundesigiiedlvrc and his audience of the pro- digious span of his public t areer Discussing affairs in Mashonaland and the prospects of procreation he Resolved that just (50 years ago he was engaged in a controversy with regard to the relations between the old Cape Colony I and the Kalin son the order. Not less remarkable than the fact of such longevity is tie i accuracy and precision of Mr Gladstone s I memory He told me some time ago that whilst his m story of yet cat events was losing something of its keenness, things that happened nearly 60 years ago are at f i even in his, man as if they had' occurred yesterday I think I have before mentioned that he can at this day recall the ps term of his rare s dress as he looks the wall and round the streets of Liverpool and holding her hand when he was a child of t between two and three a ears One result of this phenomenally long public career, with its wide field of personal' acquaintance is that scarcely a week passes out No no old friend and companion goes with it. It is with her Cried, stone as with Charles Kingsley, though in vastly) increased proportion - I watch them drift- the old familiar faces, Till guests, not men, fill old beloved places Mr Gladstone's daily life is full of ghosts, dating back to and beyond the time of Canning, his earliest and still loved in Later in statecraft There is one ghost be constantly meets, brought before him by vanished hand This is the cost of his former self at succeeding stages, from the time he was a youth at Otford, through all the stormy period in which he has been assisting to make history Nearly every year there is published some biography or autobiography of a prominent Englishman who has taken his part in the world of lett' rs science art, or police car So many-sided IS Mr Gladstone's character that no great Jinirlittuiutm and Lew a notable foreigners who have lived and died within a the last 50 years but have come in contact with him, and in the privacy of their diary or in the confidence of their private correspondence have had something to say about him The latest example is found in the letters published the other day of Russell Lowell Jiistbofoiethatcnmothe'-LifeofPusov " with whose college days Mr Gladstone in, as duty mainly connected This is interesting reading for the outsider What strange feelings these passages must evoke in the mind of the subject of the comment, turning over a page road coming upon some frank discussion of himself, written 30, 40, or 50 years ago ' Happily for most men, they have not the opportunity of reading it that their con- temporaries thought and wrote about them in conversation or correspondence with mutual at quaint - ances Mr Gladstone goes through this ordeal with unfailing regularity, and sometimes finds himself wounded in the house of a friend Divers versions are enshrined in the history of the circumstances under which old Nathan Meyer Rothschild, founder of the family, obtained the 1 parties exclusive information of the battle of Waterloo. One of the of favourite stories is that he accompanied Wellington's forces disguised as a butler, and as soon as the fortunes of the day were decided posted off to London, and read the best of the market-. One of his grandsons, a partner in the London house, tells me the true story, which, he adds, has never been published. Hut grandfather, who settled in London whilst his eldest brother Anselm remained at Frankfort, and his second brother Solomon opened a branch of the bank at Vienna, had established relations with the English Government, noting as their agent in buying gold much needed to carry on the campaign against Napoleon For the purposes of his house dress Nathan Meyer had a hut pay a swift sailing lugger, which kept him in correspondence with his brothers and other friends on the Continent One day in June, 1845, the captain of the lugger called upon Botheohild fresh from a trip across the Channel He had, in' quite a casual way, put in his pocket a Dutch, newspaper Looking it over Bothaohild found an account of the battle of Waterloo, brief, but so unfaltering and evidently authentic that he straightway went on 'Change and bought Consols by the bucketful Thor were on this particular day beaten down lower than over the last news from the seat of YE are not coming down later than an account of the affair at Quatre Bras, represented as a check to Wellington. When, later, the Government received official despatches describing Bonaparte's rout, the funds went up by leaps and bounds, and the fortunes of the house of Eotíiechúd was established on a princely scale
