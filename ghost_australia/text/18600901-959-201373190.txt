' PKX'EWS' POIillOAI, PBAPHEnY Dear Hki.l, — As on this very day Tho Champion Race id run, I beg to have a littlo say, In rhymo, about Iho fun. It 6eoms tho Sydney folks have not Thought much about the sport, For till Io9t week tho betting lot Were of tbo slowest sort. .? ? ? ; But now, at loasl, thoy'ro much too' fast, If what I read bo true; ? ' ' . Tho paco'hey're going cannot last, . . And 'plenty gilt 'they'll bluo. , Not sat isfled wilh backing ' screira '' That have 'no ghost of chance,'' ' ' They're laying odJs none should rofnso ' 'Gainst thoso who'll ' lead the dance.' ' And thon, agi'n who would havo thought To find -udi ill-judged ninnies, As thoso tho, Kandwick course havo bought For thirteen hundred guineas. Last year tha Melbourne gato was sold For somo four hundred lesj, And then tho buyer ' cf.ught ft cold '— ~ So ain't thoy in a mess ? ? , To our First Champion Ract, some say, ' : That thirty thousand oamo; ; But lucky will they bo to-day , j :: To count ono-half tho samo. '?'-''. '? Yot hoping all will bo content, . , ?.?;? . And glad tho Club will gain, ; ? : I'll now, dear Bell, with your consent, ; ' ?: ; Start my prophetic strain. c, ?' ? \ . ; ? '' As Mag and Camden havo been scratched^ ?'?''?' I'vo only got to cozen ., . ,.. , .; ' ? -. My brai ib about thoso roally matched, To wit, exact a dozen. . ' Of these ono half, 'twlxt you and mo, ' i Might juat as well stop homo, '' , ,, ' For they're as likely first to fee -v i As I tho l'opo of Rome. ? ? ,.- ?????.-. Thoy havo been good 'uns, aj we know, ! -..?'. But 'twas in days now past; , , ,? ; '' ' . And Gratis, Zoo, Strop, and Vcno 'I',, ' ''? Will nevermore bo fast. .'!'''?

And is an untried filly, ' - And so I deem hor chance no more Than 'nix 'to Piccadilly. . , . Some cranky chaps have risked their 'tin,' Like flats, upon Youmr Morgan , : ' A horse that's quite as like to win As a cat to play the organ. ' : ' ' ' ? Of twolvo, I've now got rid of nine, ;' ? And so bat thrco romain ; And ona of tbeso, take word of mine, Tho prize will surely gain.
