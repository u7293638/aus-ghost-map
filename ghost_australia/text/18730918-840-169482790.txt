The ' BoroAbater.' — Among the very use ful inventions of modern days, nono deserves to rank highor than, an ingenious littlo machino just invpnted by an American in Portsmouth, Now Hampshire. It is called 'the business man's horo abater,' and its action is simple and effectual. It consists of a button torpedo, with patent nitro- glycerino back-action attachment, ' that can bo worn on the coat liko an ordinary button, which indeed, it resembles'in appoar anco. When tho boro seizes tho 'alwitcr,' it instantly explodes, shivering his hand into a million pieces, and blowing him round the corner into tho next street. Tho inventor) it is stated, has already received ordors for all ho can manufacture for two years 'to tome, A machino on tho saine principlo, so constructed iis to pro sont tho ? nivponrnnco of a . doox'-handlo, would bo very useful to Ministers of Stato when 'about to recoivo deputations, and for domestic purposes, such as receiving applicants for char itablo donations, rate collectors, and other visi- '? tors .of this description. A 'housoholdor^s horo abater' fixed on tho front door would ho an immenso success. It is, howovor, ? douhtful whothor an ordinary button 'abater1' would take any offect on those who are interested in. the Tichborne case. , -.,'..? ,.'..-' :
