A LONE, DETHRONED E?MPRESS. A more pathetic and pitiful figure than that of the Empress Eugenie in the Paris of to-day can scarcely be imagined. Bowed with age, crippled with rheumatism, a.wraith of her former self, she haunts the scenes of her greatness-a ghost in what must be to her a city of ghosts. Her meeting the other day with her sister in misfortune, the ex Queen Isabella of Spain, was very touching, especially as Eugenie was a maid of honoun to Isabella in the days of her brilliant youth, when she was Countess de Montiojo. It is said that this accounts for what took place at the beginning of the interview. She rose first, and even performed some little service for the aged queen, as though she were still a maid of honour in the palace at M]adrid, in the bygone years when Louis Napoleon was a young adventurer in New York, and when the French flag was floating over Metz. But it is much more likely that Eugenio's action was a spontaneous .outburst of womanly sympathy with the keen grief which Isabella is experiencing for the troubles of the. country which she once ruled. And, of course, the ex-Empress.is herself a Spaniard of the Spaniards.
