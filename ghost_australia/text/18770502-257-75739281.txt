HUMOUR AND WIT, ^ ? A FASHIONABLE WOMAN'S PRAYER. BTEENQTHEN my husband, and may his faith and his money hold out to the last. Draw the lamb's wool of unsuspi cious twilight over his eyes, that my flirtations may look to him like vic tories, and that my bills may strengthen his pride in me. Bless, O Fortune, my crimps, rats, and frizzles, and let thy glory shine on my paint and powder. Euable the poor to shift for them selves, and savo mo from all missionary beggars. Soud the light of thy countenance on wy camol's-hair shawl, my lavender silk, my point lace, aud my necklace of diamonds, and keep the moth out of my uablo, I beseech thee, O For tune. When 1 walk out before the gaze of vulgar men, regulate my wriggle and give new graco to my gait. When 1 bow mysolf to worship, grant that 1 iaay do it with ravishing elegance, and proserve unto the last the lily-white of my flesh and the taper of my fingers. Destroy mine enemies with the gall of jealousy, and eat up with the teeth of envy all those who gaze upon my Btyle. Save me from wrinkles, and foster my plumpness. Fill both my eyes, O Fortune, with the plaintive poison of infatuation, that I may lay out my victims — the wen — aB dumb as images graven. Let the lily and the roBe strive to gether in my cheek, and may my neck Bwim like a goose on the bosom of crystal water. Enable me, 0 Fortune, to wear shoes a little smaller, and save me from all corns and bunions. Bless Fanny, my lapdog, and rain down hailstones of destruction upon those who shall hurt a hair of Hector, my kitten. Smile, 0 Fortune, most sweetly upon Dick, my canary, and watch over with the fondness of a ghost my two lily-white mice with red eyes.
