TO THE EDITOR OF THE MONITOR. SIR, While you have the honour to be opposed to the politics of a certain official character, whose private walk and morals you must secretly applaud, I hope you will join with me in con- demning the bad taste of a silly ill-chosen quiz, called "Song of the Maidens," in the Austra- lian Journal of the 23rd. Inst. The production, though facetious, loses its merit, by an unmanly attack on the feelings of a family of rank, they being ladies. Such coarse sallies are only calculated to injure the cause for which the Edi- tor affects to contend, and he must be hardly equal in valour to the ghost of a paper warrior, who could assail the feelings of young ladies, because their parent was of contrary politics to himself. When the present Administration will be re- ferred to by future politicians, as a beacon to prevent the ship-wreck of subsequent Rulers, it will be said, that the Journals of the day de- acended to prevate life, in order to gratify their pique. Convince your political opponents Mr. Monitor, that the feelings of private society will be held sacred by you, as you would wish those of your own innocent family, to remain unviola- ted by others. Alexander protected the wife and mother of Darius, his mortal enemy. I need not, Sir, re- quest you to give this a place in your manly Journal; and in defence of virtue and patriot- ism, you may always command the pen of CATO. Dec. 23rd. (We entirely approve of Cato's sentiments, and give insertion to them with pleasure. Ed.)
