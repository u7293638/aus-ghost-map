ShoRTHAND WJtlTJSO IN LAW COURTS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD Sir, Surely it was not necessary to employ a shorthand writer to find out that one man, endowed by 4th only human cows in, could not possibly supply daily a verbatim transcript of the evidence taken down during the five hours' sitting of a court sitting every day The mere taking down of the notes for five hours at a stretch is a severe mental strain the dictation of one hour's shorthand notes to a typist, if fnithTtilly done take from two and a half hours to three years, so that after the heavy strain of the day the unfortunate shortly sail writer who attempt to cope with a court single handed has to dictate, five inch to a most exhausting work for about 12 hours before he can got through the notes of a single day Surely there needs no ghost to come from the grave to tell 113 that a man would soon break! down who performed such a feat for many days at a stretch It is true that the shorthand writer might lighten his task somewhat by dictating his notes to other shorthand writers, who would type their own noon or d cents to typists 111 their turn, 11s is due b the Hansard still at Perth but this would cut in additional expense and unless the shorthand writers engage I were very expert the work of correction which would have to be done by the principal shorthand writer might be harder- and never wearying than if he dictated his notes to a typist direct The earnest way of course would be for the shorthand writer to employ a typist to set up his shorthand notes from his notebook without any dictation , but the shorthand writer and typist so export as to per- filan this remarkable features not easily found, and when found would probably for y soon part I know that, is done by the professional shorthand writer attached to the Goglish and V Octoman Go vernmeata,who write the system known as Curry's, and who head over their notes to be transcribed by other members of the staff How many mistakes which could not otherwise be made are entailed by this method of procedure I can not in 11 position to say, but I should judge their number to be great Happening to glance at an upturned page (239) of Anderson's ' History of Shorthand," published 17 years ago, which he 1 before me, I notice that .' in our Scotch Supi Jin our Sheriff Courts, since the Act permitting the recording of the evidence to be done by skilled shorthand writers, instead of, as formerly by the Judge's own hand the public business of the courts br43 been greatly expedited " It does seem absurd that in a great and go ahead community like this the proceedings of the law courts should be continually blocked, the Judges overworked, and Sorrento business delayed for want of an organised system of shorthand writing such as prevails elsewhere, while skilled shorthand writers, iJipiblo of immonMlv expediting the business of the courts, should be walking the streets, owing to the lack of appreciation in proper quarters 01 this most moral and nowadays lnrlispfMable aid I am, and, rightly li. -EGGS'.
