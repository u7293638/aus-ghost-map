MICKTIER. One to have been thick with, was Tier, For look at him outside or in, There is uot the ghost of a fear Of anyone saying—" Too tliiu !" His proportions of body anil mind, Went beyond the average man ; Ami if you could measure, you'd find TEIis matter and iniud hard to span. Although he was open as day, He could shut an impertinent up ; And while liking good liquor they say He hated the whine of a pup. He could yarn, make a speech, and had wit. In fact in himself was a. host, He <ne'er wanted for spirit a bit, And in toasting could butter a ghost. When the widow and orphan have cried. He laughed, dancedj-atid sang, it is said— Ah, the best in the world are belied— He but put on the jam for their bread. Ah d his sighs when he put on the side, Filled the hall from the stage to the ioor, If the house was too small, when he tried To add to the Bize of the poor. When the told hollow world passed them by, In their starving and shivering fear ; They could tell by the drop in his eye They might bet on a good honest Tier. Some have praised him for this or for that, For the dross that his silver shares win : For his beer, for his jokes, for his fat, But I praise him because he had tin. Port Adelaide. G. M.
