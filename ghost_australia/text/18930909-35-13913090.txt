It is in writing that everything comes to me I could never oTolve any ideas by sitting in my chair and think- ing " Zola has a curious theory with regard to name-, though it is one shared by at least one other great French writer. He says "I may add that I have a great faith in names, that I consider the choice of names a science I myself often spend days together over a Paris directory making out a list of names which strike me as valuable and likely to be useful, and a much longer time in finally selecting out of a list derived from that source the one or two that I may be in want of I am quite a fatalist in the matter of names, believing firmly that a mysterious correlation exists here on the man and the name he bears " These words might have come out of Bal- man's mouth, so truly do they v 0 co his views on the subject of names A new story by Mr Walter Raymond ("Tom Cobleigh ") has been accepted by the Illustrated J ondfti News, and will be published after the conclusion of the story now being contributed by Mr Gilbert Parker A new story from Mrs. W.
