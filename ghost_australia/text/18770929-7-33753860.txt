GENERAL MARKET. — Business in the market for imported goods has on the whole been inactive during the put week, yet in a few articles more has been Cornsacks got through. have been in demand, and some large parceb hare changed bands, including a line of 600 bales at pnce? ranging from 9s. lOfed. to 10s. 6d^ and we hear of s sale at a rather higher figure. Woolpacks remain dull at 3s. 3d. Kerosine and candle*' continue inactive. The former is quoted at Is. 7£d. to Is. Bd_ and the latter at B|d, Galvanised iron and fencing wire remain quiet. Sales of Johnson's and Wbitecrose brands of No. 8 wiredrawn, however, have been made at £15 10s. Bulk beers are rery dalL In bottled beers and stout them is no change to call for special remark. Aship dnent pig brand stout lias been placed at about quotations, and a parcel of O'Brien's dagger at Bs. fld." Bawdies are attracting more attention owing to rece&t;'advices with regard to theliome market, but there is not much doing. A large sale of Bacofs.in balk has taken place at fall rates. The principal feature of the week's operations has been the sale of new season's ..teas at auction. . We note the arrival of the Trelevan Family, from Foochow, with the first cargo of new season's teas, which was offered at auction on Friday, September 28th, by Messrs. Solomon & Salom, when the whole was dis posed of with the exception of two or three lifies. The prices realised were as under, vis, boxes congoo, 10 lbs.,from 18s.

Wkrki.t Gbadt Report.—There has been but little business transacted in the grain trade this week. For fair- sized parcels of wheat the price ranges from 6s. sd. to 6s. 6\L, and for farmers' lots 6s. 3d. Enquiry is not brisk, and but little is offering. We hear that the shippers of wheat by the Boreal is, for London, have been offered 6s. 3d. for their shipment, bat declined it. The favorable «ewa from home as to the condition'of the grain market will doubtless tend to keep prices firm here, and augurs well for next season's prices. Flour is alow of sale. Xbwn brands are worth £15 16s. to £16, and country sorts £14 10s. to £14 155., with but little enquiry. A cargo is reported to have been purchased -for South Africa. Bran and pollard are unaltered. New Zealand oats in fair retail demand at 3s. 6d. We note the shipment of several parcels to Melbourne, but stocks are still large. Camsacks are being hugely dealt in, and prices have advanced considerably; they are now selling at 10s. 64. The recent rains have been wonderfully "beneficial to the growing crops, 1 and reports from the country districts lead to the expectation that jfcbe next harvest will be the largest ever reaped in this colony. ] Thb Oooxtbt M&bkbcb.;—Thefollowingqno tatioas are from the local papers:— Aberdeen, September 27.—Wheat, ss. 4d. ; per bushel; flour, £15 Ss. per ton; £1 14s. per bag.

WOOL. From Messrs. Griffiths & Oo.*« Australian Wool Market Beptttt, dated Brdner, Septembar 20, we take the following:— Onr wool season of 1877-76 will be regularly opened in another fortnight, but some new woob have already been received and sold by public auction, lire quantifies, however, nave bean too small to admit of a reliable judgment being formed of what will be the general nature and condition of tbe coming dip, atthoogh it may safely be assnmwd that there wilt be a con siderable falling off in quantity and very pro bably «lao in quality. Average greasy wool realised from Std. to 9d., while one lot, some what lighter in the grease, fetched Oftd. perlb. These quotations cannot be taken aa a criterion of the prim wfaioh may rait, m tkew pordases were chiefly made by wool scourers, probably to keep their bands em ployed till their busy time comes. The ship ments for this month amount to 1,810 bales. During the month some showers have fallen orera wide spread 'of country, leading to the hope that more would follow, and that we should soon see the end of tbe drought. These anticipations have, however, moat unfortunately not been fulfilled, and letters reach as describ ing tbe fall as having been of little or no real use, and we must still lament a deplorable state of affairs in the interior. Lambing is in pro gress in many parts without much increase being Bccured, and should tbe summer have to bfe faced without an abundant rainfall, the great IIWBeBaJaTOg ftOCk ?Jr^y incurred will be dis astrously increased.
