THE FLEMINGtTOir HOUNDS. I TO THE EDITOR OF THE AUSTRALASIAN. Sir*-The meet last Saturday was at the kennels. Mr. Heam acted as master, Mr. Waldock not having recovered sufficiently to ride to hounds. He was mounted, however, on Canary, and showed up at various "points" of the run, determined to see that aU was done that was possible to ensure sport. The throw off was at Footscray, im mediately after crossing the railway, and the line lay nearly paralleLto it for six or seven miles, when the dingo was sighted, and for a similar distance was run in view nearly all the time. Ultimately the quarry took refuge in a cottage, after affording us an excellent run whim was greatly enjoyed by all out; the country being in goodorder, and the jumps numerous, and high enough, especially two doubles. I regret to say that Mr. Smith got a nasty fall at one of the biggest stone walls, and received a bad Â«ut over the eye, but for tunately nothing more serious than a good shaking, The following went straight fend well throughoutMr. Heam on Rocket, Mr. . Williams on Shillelagh, Mr. Filgate on Bacchus, Mr. Goldspink on Tallyho, Mr. Kerr on Echo, Mr. Smith on Morning. XOUIB, &c.;, SAM'S GHOST.
