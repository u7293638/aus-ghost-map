QUOTATIONS. TO THE EDITOR. Sir—i nnd, Mr. Editor, that an unconscionau individual, wiio, from his name (if names hare any just signification?, ought to know better, has been doing me a grievous injury. This "Elder," who should be called "younger," professes to parody what he calls Hamlet's moralizing before the ghost of his father. Prithee inform the man, with my complimentB, that he should quote me correctly or not at alL I was not, nor am I sucb an ass as to put words into the mouth of Hamlet which had heeu already used by my sanguinary friend Mac beth. Let Elder look at his Shakspeare before he ventures to quote me again. Pray tell the man that the following is the correct reading, and that the passage, which is from a speech of "Macbeth," a Scotch thane, who made some little noise in ni« day, is as follows:— "The times have heen. That when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, And push us from our stools." Let me say in thine car that I do not see howthe passage could apply to the august assembly of which this Elder appears to be so bright an orna ment. "When the brains are out." Query—When ate the brains int Keep thine eye open, Mr. Editor, and don't allow folks to misquote me again, or thou wilt hear from me sans ceremonie. Thine, W. SH-K-S-P-E (His Ghost).
