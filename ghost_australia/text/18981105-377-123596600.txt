DEATHS FROM FRIGHT. " I have interebted mdselW tomewhat in looking up unusual causes of death," said a well known physician, "and have met several well- authenticated instances where fright was the cause.. The English Surgeon General Francis tells of a drunmmer in india across whose legs a harmless lizard crawled when he was half asleep. He was sure that a cobra had bitten himn, and it was too much for his nerves, and lie died. "Frederick I. of Prussia was killed by fear. His wife was insane, and one day clie ebeaped from hlier keeper, and, dubblitig hlier clothes in blood rusled upon her husband wlhile lie was dozing in his chair. King Frederick imagined hlier to be the white lady whose ghost was believed to invariably ap pear whenever the deatht of a member of the Royal Family was to occur, and ihe wais thrown into a fever, and died in six woeks. "'l But perhaps the most reimarkable death from fear was that of the Dutch painter Pentman, who lived in the seventeenth cen tury. One day lie went into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketchl some deaths' headsand skeletons fora pIicture hie intended to paint. The weather was very sultry, and while sketching he fell asleep. He was aroused by bones dancing around himi and the skeletons suspended fromnt the ceiling clashing together. In a fit of terror hlie threw himself out of the window, and, though hIe snstained no serious injury and was informed that a slighlt eatthquake had caused the comnmotion among his ghostly surroundings, he died in a few days in a nervous tremor. "I could cite many other cases where the shoyk to the nervous system which we know asaright hlas produced death."
