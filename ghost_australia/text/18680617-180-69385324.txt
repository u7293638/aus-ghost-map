VICTOBIA— THE NEW MINISTRY. The Melbourne Age says— It is said that once in hu life at least every man suffers an illness which either fortifies his constitution, or kills him outright. The Victorian body politic has not lived long without becomiag seriously disordered. Our constitution is just at present so much endangered, that unless there is a speedy recovery, it must yield up the ghost. It is said that poor Mr. Sladen already repents having taken charge of elements so irre concilable, anil hie feeble sway is resented by subor dinates, each of whom imagines that he himself ought to have been selected as Premier. Every body knows that modesty is Mr. Gillies's foible, and it must be a slander to insinuate that he is one of the most insubordinate towards his chief. Mr. Langton's proverbial geniality is a sufficient guarantee that his voice is not for war. Messrs. Kerferd and Bayles are lost in amazement at finding themselves Ministers at all ?, Messrs. M'Donnel and O'tiredy, selected for the purpose of securing the Irish Catholic vote, are perpetually subdued when they venture to intrude their views upon their colleagues ; and Mr. Fellows looks upon tbe whole as a practical joke. Fiting Machine.— A captain of tbe Imperial navy, of the name Le Bris, is now constructing at Brest a machine in the form of a bird, with which he is confident he can skim through the air, and he will before long pnt it to the test. A telegraph message of eighty words was recently sent from San Francisco to Hearts Content in two minutes and fifly seconds, and the distance traversed was 6000 mQes.
