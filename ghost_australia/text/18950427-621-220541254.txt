Mr Justice Windeyer and the Spirits, a Nemesis has come to Mr Justice Win deyer in a remarkable way. It arrived, per Crick, M.L.A., in the Legislative Assembly, Sydney. Mr Crick was speaking — very much speaking — an the Dean poisoning case. He was, at least, frank in his comments on the learned judge. Thus a Mr Crick re ported : — This judge had said he was as certain thai Dean had poisoned his wife as if he had seen him. Couid this judge believe the evidence of his own eyes 1 A short time ago he was prepared to swear on the evidence of his eyes that the woman, Mrs Mellon, could raise spirits at her sweet will, but a lighted match showed the spirits to be bogus. - " This brings back to public recollection the part Mr - Justice Windeyer played in the famous seances. While Mr Crick was thus suggesting doubts as to the strength and reliability of the learned judge's vision, the subject of his remarks was listening to the Rev. H. R. Haweis, who lectured in Sydney on 14 Modern Ghosts and Spiritual- win." A few hours earlier in the lay, Acting- Judge Murray, while dealing at Bathurst with a fortune-telling case, made a few remarks about Spiritualism. "The most unmitigated frauds overpro duced to abstract money from a gullible public were," he said, 4< perpetrated, and not only, this, but the mental- faculties of many persons were so affected that the number of occupants, in CaiJari Park and other lunatic asylums . had greatly in creased." A word or two from: Mr Justice Windeyer himself .apropos of -all this would be most acceptable just now.
