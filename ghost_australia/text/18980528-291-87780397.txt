A PRAYER 1-VH PEACE. 'By Elizabeth Sitakt rnKJ.is-WAnn.1 God of all nations ! Hold them haf:k, Who beckon death upon our track ! Who welcome woe upon our land. God of all mercies ! Bid them stand ! Control the fevered heart and brain, That rends itself to rend again ; Arrest the word that starts to-day To loose the arm that leaps tu .slay ! Lo, Thou art greater than our fate, Daring we cry ; Not yet too late ! A wail is on the Easier chime Save us, 0 God ! There yet is time. Ey memories csrven and [rr.ivc-n With the pang* or thirty y.:ars ; By the mind and the moaning of brittle— Horror and an-u^h and tears. By the souls that went out in their morning1, With the rose of the Knst on their brow ; By the splendor in ryes that were darkened, Wistfully watching us now. By the cry on lips that were silenced In slaughter and torture ami death ; By the hom.-'lcs?, de-olate passing Of the slow auci buttered breath ; By the man who writhed in tho trenches, By tiio hoy w!io groaned on the field, By the hero who da.-.hed to his d.yhie With only the smoke for a shield : By the locket that lay on the silent, Cold heart ; by tho curl of soft hair He had hidden to kiss it and treasure Till they found it at last, with him, there ; By Hie mother who boro Iiiin ami gave him Ah, God ! By the desolate wife ; By the girl in whose heait he is holy From the dawn to the. dark of her hfo ; By the homes that are builded on ashes, By the ghosts at the hearth tiiat we have ; By the life that went down with the soldier Into the weed-grown grave ; By the waste, and tho woe, and the murder, By the crime of tho shot and the shell That tears at tho iiesh and the. spirit, By the soul of war, which is hell — Save, save us, good Lord !. . . Misguided! Blinded by blood raid by mist, Oh, save us the Easter lilies Held in the hands of Christ I ^ ? —Selected. ??'??!? ? ?!!! I II II i»m ?
