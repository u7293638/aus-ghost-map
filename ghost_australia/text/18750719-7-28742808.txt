The Advertiser MONDAY, JULY [?] 1875. We have more than, once called attention to what is undoubtedly a great improve- <*> ment in the Australasian Wesleyan Con- <*> ference. Until recency the] Conference has been composed of ministers alone, in •whom the supreme power of legislation for the Ohnrch was vested. At &.Oan> ferenoe held in Sy4£e7\ however, in 1873. the principle of uy_rapfesentation in the ttftmal and r tmib^ Ctoftforofrw *w affirmed 'Vwithin limit* to *hj# quenlly defined."

To say nothing of America, the etiest born, hss attained to a noble if somewhat wflful manhood ; to leave out of sight altogether those vast dependencies inhabited by an alien people which an simply held antf ruled hj wit and strength, there is enough in tike Oolonwie proper —in Oanada and Bonti^«rn Africa, in Australia and New Zealandi—to kindle «t^tTniM<min in the dullest.

There is no country in the world that beats us for fruit, from the pineapples of Queensland, to the oranges and peaches of South Australia. Nor is the climate to be despised, at least of the southern half of the continent. We have occasional spslb of heat, bat they are not more intolerable/ftan that of London in Aogost, orof KeirYorkw July. Daring the greater part of the year it is a joy to exist. Let-it-teqgrantod tiiat the pure i?ngushtypeof the Anglo-Saxon will be somewhat dunged. So it has in America. ' Bat change doss not necessarily imply diminution' of ' mental or of physical vigor. Two generatioafl have wrought no ill effects upon the parent stock. There may be somewhat less breadth in th« physique of our men, somewhat less color in the beauty of our women, but there ia no degeneracy in the strength of the one, nor in the loveliness of the other. In language we are not altering, except perhaps by the more frequent use in term and figure, of words which express our leading occupations. In pronunciation the change is but slight. Save for a modifieatien of the broad vowel sounds, oand ou, it would bd impossible to tell the speech of «n educated Australian from th*% of an educated Engliahman. There is £?r less din^rence between the English lan- \ guaj«7 aa,apoken in Adelaide and London, than there is between it as spoken in Manchester' and London. The constant nfttttoniie maintained between Australia told England, an .intercourse yearly grow ing, greater and more frequent, as well as tu* literature of the Empire, both past ami present^ which is common to bdth, will tend to prevent any great difference in speech and pronunciation. We are united to the old country by a thousand ties, and we trust with Sir George Bowen and Mr. DuOane that those ties will not easily be broken. Sir George Bowen did not forget to point out very dearly and strongly the influence which Australia has had Upon the institutions of the old country. He vary happily introduced what he had to uy by an aphorism froni a repent article in the Itmes to the effect that if the Englishmen of the present day desire to know what England will be 60 years hence, they had better study what Aus tralia is now. A remarkable change has undoubtedly taken place in the attitude of mind, both of people and statesmen, towsidsdemooratib institutions. Australia is not regarded now, as it was 20 or even ten years ago, as a mereb/experimenting in legislation. She is ngatded as hating reached results of a satisfactory character. If imitation is the avHwrest form of flattery, we may be a little proud of the adoption by the British Parliament of certain reform*, which can be traced to no other immediate source than our own Governmental policy. Tote by ballot, household suffrage, the transfer of land by registration, these, as Sir George Bowen aaid, "are as much an importation from ▲ostealia as wool and gold." He was right, too, in his remark—a remark worthy of attention from British legisla tor* in the present state of controversy about the tenure of land—that if Australia is to be regarded as a democracy of an advanced type, it is a territorial demo cracy bound over to the cause of order by Itsfnterest in the soil. iWtouohed .npoajheuauestion, not without its ««burning" aide for. Us—What are the prospects of federation among the colonies of the South? And his decision, given somewhat oracularly, is this—that an " Australian Customs League or Zoll verein must precede an Australian con federation." We think Sir George Bowen is mainly in the right; but there are too many difficult matters involved in the subject for it to be criticised at the dose, of an article. Thekb is another difficulty in the French Assembly. Oar readers will remember that the Constitution was carried mainly through the assistance of M. Gambetta and the Left, who held their own extreme views in abeyance, in order that the Republic • might be pnb | licly acknowledged by the Constitution. It is no secret -that Gambetta and his party were led to this principally from their fear of the^Bonapartists. To keep them out of power he was willing to give nifraupport to a. moderate and conserva tive Republic. It appears, however, that the Imperialists have been at their old intrigues, and Gambatta believes that Buffist'a Ministry have been playing into their hands* 90 he raised the question in the Assembly in a motion directed : the Government, which was lost. The Bight then moved a motion expressing confidence in the Government, which was earned.. The Left have broken with the Government, irrevocably, we should think, because Gambetta is not the man to be deceived twice. The?ona- Fartata are exultant, as might lie ex pected. 13ie electrons, howevwy^are to take place in Augum, and then we shall seier who are strongest—the Repnblieans or tiie Imperialists. /With a fair itart and M fair race, we should back the Re nnHiftaim \- It will be teen that heavy rains and disastrous floods have, prevailed in Wales, and in the West of England.

Ceylon from Chile was one of unusual quickness; bee return •rip promises to be Jn?i; the reverse. The groundibgin the Booth Ohanael, Hohton's Bay, detained her from Tuesday afternoon until Thursday morning, and her passage round has bean remarkably slow. Leaving Port Pid'ap j Heads at 9.40 a.m. on Thursday, July 16, she ' enooontered susta strong head winds and bbm that she did not reach the Glenelg auohorage nntil half-past 1 o'clock on *3ua day morning, Jaly 18, making a tun of 63$ hears, or about 20 hours more than was ex- , posted. On account of the detention in Mel bourne arrangements were made in Adelaide that no cargo should bs taken and that the steamer should be detained .no longer than would be neoassary to tranship the mails. But this work, which can be ordinarily dispatched in about an hour, occupied fully eight hours. This is entirely accountable to the weather, whioh throughout the bight was very squally, with a nasty chopping sea. It was found impossible for the meaner, whioh carried the mails and pas sengers, to range alongside the ooean packet, and one of the latter** lifeboats had to be pressed into-the service. The work was tedious andnotwithoai considerable danger to the pas sengers, bus* fortunately all passed off without any aooldant, and she Oeylon prooaeded on her way at about 9 o'clock on Sunday morning, two and a half days behind her, contract time for starting. The only passenger for Adelaide was Mr. Hugh George, of the Arfftu, and among the outward passengers from here am the Bey. G. M. and Mrs. Wilson. Tna following particulars of the grounding of the Oeylon were given in the Melbourne Argvs of the' 14th July :— "The outward-bound' mail steamer Oeylon, which left the bay at 2 p.m. yesterday, had not arrived at Quenseliff at a late hour last evening, and is wu Consequently feared that | she had got aground in the South Channel. About llp.ni, Mr. Rimsftf, the Postoaarter- Gsneral, received the following telegram from Q leencdiff: —* Several rookets have been sent up. from a position supposed to be near the hud of the South Channel. The mill steamer his not reached heie.* Mr. Bamsay at onoe telegraphed to Oaptaln Payne, Chief Harbor-Master at Wfllianutewa. giving instructions for the Pharos to gei up steam, and at once to proceed to the locality, to render any assistance necessary.. Oaptaln Payne, how ever, did not wait to get up steam on board the Pharos, bat at once dispatched a stefcmtng to the South Channel. At 2 o'clock this morn ing we received the following telegram from Queensoliff :—"The Oeylon is on shore at the eastern entranse of the South Channel. The vessel took the ground at 9 p.m. She had anchored on the way down the bay for two hours, owing to the thick weather. The second offiwr and the purser were sent to Qaeenedlff to telegraph for assistance. Pilot Kioh was in charge of the Oeylon.'" At the Theatre Royal, on Saturday evening, " The Woman in Bed" was produced for the first time this season. Owing doubtless l to the very inclement weather, there was only [ a small house; bat, notwithstanding this, the pleoa went off very suooossfully. The per formers seemed to enter with spirit Into their work, and we think this piece one of the most aaooesafnl that has been uroduoed by the Towen company. The Interest of the play oentres In the fortaies and misfortunes of Bodiga, the Jewess, in her search for her child, stolen from its nurse in infancy; aad this character, supposed to be one «f Miss Bow ring's best, was admirably sustained by thai lady. The scenes where she 4toovers her child In the person of Franoesoa Donati, and where she claims her from her supposed u>other, were excellently performed, and drew loud applause from the audience. Franoesoa, the daughter, was well played by Miss Doutrlis; iadeed, ia the last act, where torn by catfl iotiug emotions of love far her mother and for the Oountess Doaati, who had brought her up, she discovers how truly Budiga loves her, and how she Is prepared, if necessaiy, to sMrifioe her. self to add to her daughter's happiness, her acting was scarcely inferior to that of Miss Bowring herself; and that was almost perfec tion. The Oountess OonstaDX t Dontti w*s well played by Mrs. Tower*; Mr. Wolie was man successful than usual as Victor Season, while Mr. Martin made an admirable villain in the oharaoter of Hubert Malisset. Mr. Power as Matti Twitti made several good points, and was the scarce of maoh amusement, and Ninon, his wife, was wall playei by Miss Wallace. The other character* were all £drly sustained. '-The Woman in Bed* will be repeats 1 this evnn lag, and a rival to Mr. B. D. Daviei, in ths person of Monsiear Basoo, will mvka his &st; appearance in Adelaide. There was a large attendance of jure failes and their friends at Mr. Davies's eater tslnment at White's. Booms on Saturday afternoon. The performances amused anl interested the children «xsead>ag!y. Taare was also a god attendanoa at the even'nj entertainment, at which a new programme was"! introduced. The singing was. excellent, aad the (tymnastic perforaiaucas caos^d miogl«d feelings of wonder and admiration. Mr. Davtes was ia fine form, and his local allusions and jokes caused roars of. laughter.
