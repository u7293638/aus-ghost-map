\- A NIGHT OF TERROR. ABE all appearanoes deceitful? Do we liVe surrounded by shadowy chimeras f Have our'eyes been given us only to deceive our senses, and our senses .to keep us 'in a State of perpetual doubt ahd delusion J _ In the present ptOBaio and meobanioal age, it isnofc diffionlt to ridicule all that reflates to the supernatural; -but many of -the most seeptioal, after long laughing at this idea of - a visit from those who have -learned the great Esoret-and passed into the'shadow-land, have been forced by terrible experience to believe and tremble. It is more especially in that middle, state between Bleeping and waking, when tbe nerves are unstroDg. that tbe sensitive brain seeB objeots 'that have no tangible existence, and hears sounds that are ihb offspring of its own creation. Terror, remorse, love, and. grief, are-the-painters ,who . offer their impalpable pictures' to bur betted and unsettled imaginations ; and, for Shisxeeson, the belief ip fimtastio ^visions is -by'ho means' confined to the "weak arid ignorant... The man, whose brain is of. the iugbeiitttr&eivan;^ the hardest worked, is .oftentimes more ready to rpoeive this impreaBionsrbf imagin^iy; or ghostly \- apparitions, and io: investigate "gate these; phe somen's-witti respeot,'.than the uneducated and--unthinking eooffer' who jeers at the whole thing-as nothing bat/Vulgar supersti-J tion. . '. .' . >-'""'- ' -v,' Whether ^he foUomng story, which relates Ihe'expeHenoes of tonight of terror, will serve tb lhrbw^by light upon the. pbBsibility "of a tb'B •jaatta&bliiof;^''another ^wbrld,;depiwad It is many years ago pince I set ont on f tour tlirongh tha wostern highlands of tho«i picturesque counties Mayo and Galway. • Mj yacht lay off the little fishing village of Keem, in Clew Bay, from whioh spot I had made trips tu Clsre Island, Blaoksori Harbour, ani all the other places worthy oi interest upon the coast; ana I now deter mined to hire .n guide and pay a visit ti some of the inland tceuery. I liad little difficulty in engaging Larry Macgoharty'f snrvioeB during my Btay on shore ; he was an honest lad, with a laughing eye, and all tbe aptness for repartee and impromptu wit that generally belongs to hiB countrymen. But, as it is difficult to find an emerald without» flaw, so it is bard to And a man, even though be be an.emerald iBlander, without some slL'ht blemish; , and Larry's,, I soon discovered, was.aa inordinate love of potheen, i With my knapspek on my back, my stick in my hand, and Larry by my side, I set off to ascend the steep sides of the Croghan mountain. When we started tbe sun was Bbining in all its glory, throwing its gold npon the trees and heather. Far below lay ^he oalm unruffled ocean, without one rook or island on whioh the weary sea-bird could reBt its foot, between Achil Head and America. En the bay, Clare Island and the islets could he seen, some dark as jet, others flashing like a smile upon the faoe of the waters. Hi»b above towered the hill, its Bummit clad with a crown of forest land, and its slopes covered with a rioh growth of wildwood and flowers, intersected by numerous streamlets that rushed' down, through tbe velvet mosses, laughing to the sea, Inland we could see ridges and slopes of gre«n broken only by lakes, peeping from their deep hiding plaoes, whioh spread away aB far as the eye oould follow. • The hum of big, slumberous, heavyladen, broad-backed honey-bees, the joyous notes of numerous song-birds, and the silver tinkling of distant sheep- bells, filled the. air witb sounds of summer music, and made us linger on our way. A turn in the road brought in sight an ancient tower, which stood on the brink of an overhanging precipice like some rugged warbeaten sentry guarding the shores ofj his native laud. On approaching the building, it turned out. to be an o}d ruined mill, lonely, dismal, and deserted as the Moated Grange of the Laureate, desolate, spectral, and uncanny as Hood's Haunted House. I wished to pay a nearer visit, hoping to be able to enter the ruin, but Larry, who was trembling with terror, said—" Ah, sure ! yer honour, don't go near it; sure the pluoe is haunted." He then proceeded to relate the story of a murder which had taken place there^some years previously^ The orime was of a peculiarly atrooious character; the eon of the old miller had killed bim with a hatobet, for the sake of a email sum of money that, was believed to be in his possession, and, afterwards, when the deed was discovered, the murderer, pursued by the enraged neigh, hours, conoealed himself in the mill. Tracked by unrelenting justice, and despairing of escape, he flung himself from the cliff into the foaming waters beneath. From that time the peasanrty avoided th^unholy spot, and it waB soon reported to sib visited by tbe ghosts of those connected with the murder. Surely, I thought, if any orime can recall tbe dead, and make the place of its perpetration aooursed, this is one. Larry tremblingly described the terrible eigbts spoken of by the village gossips, as being witnessed in the blaokened walls of tbe dreary mill; tbe most horrible one heing tbe corpse of tbe murdered man, which, on the anniversary of the orime, was seen lying oh tbe floor of the upper room, glazed with oongealed gore. Deserted and accursed, the place fell into ruins; no one passed it with, out a shudder and a prayer for the repoBe of the old man's soul. Without believing in the wild and improbable tales told by the peasants, I felt so much horror of this diabolical deed, that we hurried on, glad to be relieved of the influence of the plaoe; and we soon lost, in the bright, sunny Boenes, all memory of the haunted mill For some hours we continued our excursion in the neighbourhood, pausing often to listen to the cooing of the wild wood-pigeons and the lays of the blackbird and miBtlethrush. As we wandered inland,. nothing was visible but one wide expanse of living verdure, save where the silvery waters of the streamlets and lakes were seen hidden in the luxuriant mass of foliage; the sunset clouds of Italy seemed transported by the hand o! some mighty magician to the sylvan- solitudes of the WeBt; and no soene of nature oould have offered a fairer image of Paradise. But gradually, as tbe evening approaohed, the wind, whioh had been softly sighing through the gently waving branobes, began to blow in freshly Irom the 'sea; and .the rippling wavelets, that were danoing npon the surface of the waters, seeqjed momentarily to increase in size. Everyone who knows the coast of Ireland is aware, how sudden are. the changes—from a gale to a calm, from a balm to a hurricane, . In halfan-hour the sosne was hardly recognisable; the heavy Atlantio rollers were breaking upon the shore with tremendogB violenoe; flakes of foam came sweeping over the surging waters, flying up the mountain side, and were carried far inland f-the sand W»s oaught up by the wind and sent sleeting aoross the country, thioker and more intolerable than any,hailstones, filling the eyes, ears, and mouth ; levelling ditohes, overtopping , walls, and threatening to. lay the whole coastline in one oommon desolation, and nun. , Larry^who had called at every shebeen on the road, and replenished a whisky bottle, whioh no persuasion could oompel himto relinquish, was by.this time more than half-, seas' Vveri and, .to make matters worse, we mistied jtoe ]|>Mtw'. tfaok and lost our way. "TiThaiis'to be done;iiow, Xarryr' said L " The divil a one.of me knows,yer honour,: without ye'd sit here under the rook) and wait till I find but where we are." , The>ook that he spoke of hung over the path, giving .just sufficient.shelter , for one person; and, - as night was .coming on, andjl I felt half-blinded by the shifting eand, I consented ; and Larry, after promising '.to. return quiokly, disappeared -in the darkness.. Left to myself, I soon.began to lament my lonely condition, and.to abuse Lsriy and fate for bringing .me into such v a mess;. in this oongenial ooaupation an hour. passed: slowly away, but' there was' no* sign ..of Larry's return; and I sorrowfally oonolnded .thai-he bad either wandered so far that -he was unable io find his way baok, or. that, some acoidentiiad happened to bim; fearing.the latter, !.resolved to venture out of my.-lair;. and try if T oould find him .Or disoover the IobI path. ..
