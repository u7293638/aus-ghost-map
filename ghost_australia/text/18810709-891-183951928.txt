Jehovah, the True God.' FbrIOHED In tiONDON ON Alim. SAW St ZHS Eet. Maek Gtrr Peabsi.' 'The God that anrwereth by Are let itiabiai God.' (1 Kmg«xriii. 21). THE Preacher remarked that it wuTEHjah himeeif who made the proposal, and the people atonce accepted it. On the summit of Oarmel, withered and scorched .with the long drought, hod gathered the hoata .of Israel, and. ;• in front of them the 450 priesta; of Baal; and - there, on the other aide, rose np the ganntform of the atem prophet, who, lifting np his.sinowy arm to hasten, exclaimed,' How long halt ye between two opinions f if the Lord: b« God, follow Him; bnt if'Baal, then follow, him.' And they answered him not a word. Again ho spake and said,' Give no two ballocka, and let them ehooBe one bollock ior themselvesy.and out it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and pntno fira under: and 1 wilt dreas the other bollock, and lay it on wood, and pntno fire under; and call ye on the name of yoor gods, and I, will call on the name of the Lord: and : the • G.od that answereth by fire . let Him be.-.Gpd.'r* And' from the hosts of the people there came a shont —It ia well Bpoken; let him pnt it to the teat. From that incident they might learn; some truths that were adapted to the times and to the occasion that had brought them together that evening. The first lesson to be leamt wa that the religion of God must bring the proof of its divine authority. Elijah .stood ; a. tba very picture d the living.religion of God, wherever it was found. It was always a trouble some intruder in the world, always a stern re former, always the yoioe reproving; mn. It said if a man was ever to enter the better world - it most be by the merit of another.- • It wanted the innermost services of the man and it .claimed every faculty and" power that he- poeeecsed. Snoh a strange religion most carry iu warrant . open-handed for the world to see.: The vary triumphs of Christianity gava to the world's challenge anew urgency and force. Christianity gave two blessings to all people—liberty, and light- Ae men got liberty they wented to aee more < clearly than ever; .by what authority : they '. were : to' terra One ! who demanded so eompleta a servics.,, ;. 8den»e was sometimes spoken! of'as, this onrse of tha times; bntbeoanse the slave yieldadanqnea. tioning submission should they count., liberty an evil t Because light set men thinking for themselves shonld they love darkness rather _ than light f How and then, if seamed as if' - they were afraid of thelighit.Meaa.Ood for both the liberty and the light.. It .was the wiaa^£;^:. men that came seeking diligsntly'for the d^.:/" young Child, and when they: found; Him they '• lsidat his feet the costliest gifts of, gold and myrrh and frankincense.- But aa Christianity advanced, as there was more liberty-and more light, bo most there be mora, and. more blear evidenoe.' Borne, quick to discem-the signsof the times, saw this growing .dacaand for authority, and met - it by voting her Pope , infallible. The - demand,;! applied as mnch to themselves as , to .Borne. If the Gospel could not repeat ita .glories his faith in & wonld be very little. : "What was the use of taikingabout Bethesda and the -healing power that there used to be there ? If he went there and found no poor blind ■ man's eyes opened, nolittlechildrajoicinginita new-found health, he wonld think the place might do foe . an ornamental fishpond, hat the whole thing was a delusion if its power-was .gone. Ha longed to see. in . their Church mora of this living religion that had in it the breath of Omnipotence; then wonders wonld be donas such as were experienced in the days of thiir fathers; .if not, she had no breath at,all, and she was dead, and, they might have services foe her lying in-wait with splendid,music, and. pomp Of priests; and adoring multitudes, hat it could not last long; she wqnld c.be dead, and a growing offence, . and God .'and man would say, 'Bory the dead out of.onr eight* Secondly, lot thom consider the-appointed proof. ' The God that answereth by fire, let him he God.' The altars were,built; hew Baal's altar with the bullock on, and there Elijah's altar with the bnlloofc hud; on; unHI the fire came there was no difference betweea Baal and Jehovah. Christianity, was a pooE thing nnlesa ehe bad got the ,fira from heaven. All probabilities of success lay on the side of Baal; on his side were the numbers .and patronaga of the people, the pomp and splendour of the robes, and everything that looked attrac tive. Bo it always was; if Christianity last her fire Hitu&lism; must come'in, or intelleetaal ism; or some other ism mast be borrowed by their' holy religion when sho had lost her fire. Look at the earnestness, the passionate entreaty, and self-eacrifice of Baal's followers as they cat - themsolves. and: shouted unweariedly from morn till evo; Christianity might be put to the blush by heathenism for earnestness, self, sacrifice, and devotion, when , she had lost the fire. He oonld not help thinking thosa three Hebrew children stood before them as a pioture of the Church in the firo'. Look at ths hosts como up to worship the golden image; towering high above them waa tho golden god himself, and the air was fall of the ring of the trumpet and saokbut, and psaltery,-and ahouta of the people; then they all prostrate them. ' solves except throe poor oxilM in a ahanga land.

Jehovah now had :the „_tena. of thoossnds, and the_ herald made pro v'vclamation that'therawasno godlike the God of j '., latael.. Without the fire our religion was a poor thing, but when she walked in thefire then was l i eeen .tho glory of her Master. The priests of Baal having failed Eli j ah's torn oame, and there, one man among the hosts of Israel and the.450 priests, he hnQt the altar with hie own hands. ;X'y Ai living religion could do. without numbers : one consecrated heart was mors that .day than !;;,'all the hosta of Ahab..
