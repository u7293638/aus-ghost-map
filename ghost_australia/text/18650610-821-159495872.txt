Allison, informant, I deposed as followsYesterday morning, at about j 10 o'clock, I was proceeding along Hindley-street, when Klein came running after me with a sauce- | pan iu his hand, and a knife (produced) stuck in i his waistcoat. He requested me to accompany i him to the Police-station. He told me he liajl poison in the saucepan, and the knife was to pre vent any one from taking the poison. He went quietly towards the Police-station, aud I followed nim. At the Station the knife was taken from him. aud he was questioned as to the contcuts of i saucepan. A piece of bread in it, he saiil. was j intended to'feed a ghost. W. Nitschke, copper- | smith, Hindley-street. said Klein had been living in his house for the last 14 days, and had mani fested many signs of mental aberration, which he (witness) described. Dr. Moore had prescribed for him. The patient fancied there was a ghost under his bed, and that another came to visit him through a hole in the roof. Prisoner, to witness— Do you know that 21 or 39 people with wings assemble on your roof in the night and flyaway? i Witness shcok his head, and prisoner continued Let your missus come. 6he will speak the truth.
