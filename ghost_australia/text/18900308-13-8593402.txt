A NATION'S PLAYGROUND. BY EDWARD J. HART. All who have read that fine Australian novel "Robbery Under Arras ' surely one of the saddest books ever penned will remember Dick Marston's description of his feelings on first breaking out of Berrima gaol, daring that wild night ride in company with Jim and Starlight " My heart was too full to talk, much less laugh, with the thought of being out of that cursed prison and on my own horse again, with the tree bush breeze filling my breast, and the free forest Id lived in all my life once more around me ' It is not necessary for every one to undergo a sentence of imprisonment in order to realise these sensations We are sufficiently cramped and prisoned in our cities, and the artificial life they engender, to enjoy the change to bush life and a sojourn in the forest, the very air of which seems to breathe the spirit of liberty Of old sat Freedom on the heights" the wooded heights, no doubt-and when weary of this repose she rides abroad on the blast that comes rushing through the leafy crowns with a noise like the sound of surf on a rock bound coast, and the hoary trees flinging themselves about in the wild ecstasy of the moment, bend their lofty heads together, and whisper secret memories of the past and of the free peoples who have camped beneath their shade The forest lore of all lands has, from time immemorial, embodied the idea of liberty 'The ballad story of Robin Hood and his merry men, leading their joyous existence under the greenwood tree less banditti than foes to the Norman usurpation emerges from the leafy coverts of time, as fresh and charming as when four hundred years ago the sight of then Lincoln green inspired the oppressing barons with a wholesome sense of terror The beautiful legend of Genevieve, of Brabant," still lingers in the vast forest of the Ardennes , telling how the wronged mother, with her infant, is carried into the most lonely regions of the woods and there left to perish, but the forest welcomes her, a fund suckles her infant, the trees feed her with their berries, and the deepest thickets open wide their recesses for her shelter, and in the end this beneficent care enables right to triumph Ever the home of free restless spirits, ever the succouring shelter of those who died from the tyranny of the cities, what wonder that the forests were regarded with an affectionate veneration t the men of old, and if we moderns have different needs and require ments, yet we cannot dispense with those boons of nature which many esteem so lightly. For even we of the present day need a breathing spot ' A bower quiet for us and a sleep k use of sweet dreams, and health and quiet breath in' -a shelter, if not from the oppression of human to runs from the tyranny of custom and conventional restraints Open spaces where we can stretch our limbs, and relapse into savagedom if you like-a savagedom, in some ways so many degrees better (for health at least)-than our civilisation. The artists and literati of this land are often accused and not without reason of the barrenness of their ideas Are the means whereby they might gain inspiration con served, and estimated at their proper worth" the educational value of good scenery, and a communion with nature, can hardly be over estimated-was rightly estimated by the poet Wordsworth A man who has once rested in the depths of the mountain woodlands beneath the rugged brow of night, and like Siegfried, listened to the voices of the forest, who has observed that solemn mystery which we call the dawn, and watched the morning vapours like departing ghosts creep from tree to tree, and the sea of sunlight flooding both copse and glade, here Hushing the sombre gum leaves a sanguine red, there touching the delicate fern fronds with a gleam of gold, can hardly fail to have borne in upon him a sense of the beauty and majesty of the universe of the universe and its Creator. 'I true appreciation of beauty is, in most cases, closely allied to deep devotional feeling The sense of awe and wonderment engendered by the first, is at least the best preparation for the second, and of the spirit of reverence, such a one will learn more in the mountain forest than you can ever teach him in your narrow axe hewn churches in the valleys and plains, Froudenee has left ample room and space for our spreading towns and industrial enterprises, and would seem to have marked out the sea coast, the mountains, and the forests as playgrounds for the people, wherein they may disport themselves, and by preserving these from alienation, by forming national parks, we may be endowing the community with a desirable measure of future safety) For, seeing that the worst phases of anarchism are largely the outcome of penning large populations up in cities, where they swarm, and see the, and generate n scum which works mischief, if we provide vast and easily accessible playgrounds for their delectation, and foster a love of healthful, legitimate pleasures, we let in a current of fresh air that may helptouissi pate the exhalations rising from the cauldron of ignorance, license and despair. This is, doubtless, a long look into futurity, and it will probably be said that we have mountain forests and pleasant rural places enough to afford recreation reserves for all the urban population Aye, enough for the present, but not enough for all time, for as our spreading cities increase their to- persons demands, and stretch impatient hands ever further out into the wilderness, as our " Inbour'd mines undrainable of ore " make ever more and more urgent claims upon our woodland resources, it will become a task of increasing difficulty to preserve un denied those forests which should be kept as health and pleasure resorts alone. A fortnight ago, in an article descriptive of Lorne, I threw out a suggestion that the country around this fairest of coastal resorts should be formed into a national park by the Government proclaiming it a state forest 'The suggestion had been made before with regard to other localities, and was only new as far as it referred to the Otway Forests. Several letters appeared in support of this project, one of which bore the signature of a gentleman who is entitled to be regarded as an authority on the subject, Mr Walter Madden having acted as vice president to the Royal Commission on Vegetable Products, which, in the year 1880, examined experts, and accumulated a vast amount of evidence on forestry and kindred subjects, in this and the adjoining colonies Simultaneously with the appearance of these letters came the announcement that Mr. Perrin, conservator of forests, had returned from Lorne impressed with the conviction that the district should be preserved intact as a summer resort, that while unsuitable for settlement, in its natural condition as a national park it is invaluable that the land in the forest should never have been alienated, and he intends doing his best to prevent its further sacrifice This is an eminently satisfactory prospect, but experience teaches us that between a prospect and are eventuated there is room for all sorts of modifying circumstances, and that not seldom consummation is postpones until it becomes impossible 'The reports and protests of the best of public servants have been known to be pigeonholed b) in dolent or indifferent Ministers, newspaper articles and correspondence are often for- gotten as soon as read, and meanwhile the very elements seem to fight on the side of the destroyer From the Eastern and the Western provinces comes the news of forest fires, the spirit if desolation stalking through the land, what man's capacity has spared, his carelessness but too often seems to destruction It is at once admitted that many of these fires are preventable, but, on the other hand, we have ample evidence that many conflagrations originate from a reckless want of thought and considera- tion for others, and we also know that with judicious care their worst effects may be minimised Taking a practical view of the forestry question, a glance through the reports of the Royal Commission reveals such startling facts that one is fairly amazed that this subject, of which the formation of national parks forms an integral portion, has not been first in men's minds from the time the evidence was first made public It must be remembered that the commission was composed of practical business men, given every opportunity of eliciting, testing, and weighing the evidence, and that the testimony is that of experts and scientists, too thoroughly imbued with the scientific method to be likely to degenerate into alarmists, men too practical to be greatly influenced by considerations of mere sentiment Well, they unite in telling us that the world's supply of timber is becoming rapidly exhausted that within a few years every country will have to look to the supplying of its own necessities, as far as possible, from its own resources. This is not a remote contingency, but a problem to be faced within a measurable space of years, tor, says Baron von Mueller, each country in the next century will have quite enough to do to provide its own means and material from the forests We might just manage to get through the dozen years that are still left of this century in the way in which we have been proceeding, but it is perfectly clear that each great part of the globe, each great colony, each great state, will have to cultivate that which will grow in its climate to remunerative advantage ' All the experts were practically unanimous in this and in other matters the beneficial effects of the forests in increasing and con- serving the rainfall, and in promoting nourishing dew , the keeping streams and rivers perennial, that but for their presence would be dry watercourses during a great part of the year, the necessity of immediate and extensive planting and replanting of in digenousandnon indigenous trees throughout the colony, and the devotion of the revenues of the forests to the maintenance of the forests the most suitable machinery for controlling the forest lands, and the best means of minimising the evil effects of bush fires and preserving them from the other destructive agencies to which they are exposed 1 his evidence was adduced, and the reports and recommendations were made four years ago and how far have we advanced since then Where are the cause that should have been planted in the forests around Wood's Point, adorning the Black Spur with a yet fresher, nobler beauty In their place we have late!) witnessed a desperate struggle to save the adjacent in- digenous woods from annihilation Where are the Spanish chestnuts, the English and American ash trees, the Scotch Irish and American pines, recommended for the northern plains, the talwood of California for the poorer soils ' Where are the Indian cedars, larches, red cedars, elms, pines, and poplars, and the countless varieties of trees suitable to the climate which it was advised should line the barren slopes of our Alpine regions and the wasted leagues of coast' The experts questioned on the subject and agreed in recommending that the forests should be divided into sections by running through them lines of utilitarian plants such as would form an impassable fire bars of the New Zealand flax mill) and the American agaves, for instances that the starting of a Gre need not necessarily mean complete destruction. Yet we have heard nothing of these tire checks in reports of recent con- flagrations. Four years ago witnesses stated that the black wattle, once so plentiful, was being fast exhausted, and the golden wattle -when in bloom one of the glories of our woodlands-was in places almost destroyed Is that reproach a false one now ' There is no intention of effecting on those who have had immediate control of the forests in the last few years Doubtless they have done their duty with their limited means and powers, and, after all, it matters little whether few or many trees were planted, barren areas made verdant, or verdant tracts disforested, in comparison with the extent to which public opinion has of hon not been educated and public attention excited by this important national question 'The outlook is not promising The Yea forest, only saved by the accidental discovery of the scandal involved in its disposal, the destructive process of selection still burrowing into the very heart of the Otway woodlands, speak but too eloquently of the apathy with which the people regard their most valuable heritage In the report above alluded to I have found only one slight reference to the necessity of forming; national parks, probably because the greater is held to include the lease and, if numerous state forests are formed throughout the colony, it follows as a matter of course that the community must possess many of these nboreBcent breathing; spots In connection with this matter it is necessary to take the question of the timber supply into consideration, for reasons other than its own enormous importance, for generally speaking nothing; here seems to command attention that has not a utilitarian basis , but in this instance even the prospect of direct pecuniary gain or loss is apparently powerless to awaken an active interest, and, as the destructive process goes on apace, in mediate action is required to save the picturesque! localities, and it is imperatively necessary to insist on the preservation of play grounds for the people, for the sake of health and that rational enjoyment which directly ministers to health A reserve of 40,000 acres or all the land within a radius of six miles of Lorne, would, we are told, include the sites of all the known waterfalls caves, and gullies. But how many may exist yet undiscovered outside the area sleeping beauties await- ing the arrival of some adventurous pioneer and because of the strong probability that this is (so this area might well be largely increased It is an accepted rule that one fourth or one fifth of every country should be forest The area of Victoria is fit 000 000 acres, and the total area of forest reserves and timber reserves is under 1000 000 acres, a proportion which (to quote the evidence of Mr Clement Hodgkinson) " is totally Innile quite, and if no alteration be made therein there will, in a generation or two be a bright tal deterioration in the climate of Vic toria " So the proposed Leave park of 40,000 acres is only one small step in the general scheme of reforesting the country in due proportion, which should now engage the public atten- tion, and this suggests the idea that the beautiful forest lands stretching from Healesville to Marysville should likewise be dedicated by the people to the people No one ever dreams of questioning the utility of the metropolitan parks and gardens, and they are rightly termed the lungs of the city What these spaces are to the urban population, so must the national reserves become to the population at large 'I he Lorne and Fern alian parks should never again re- echo to the woodman's ate or the crackling tires-the clearing process of the free selector, but should for ever remain a nation's pin ground and H province of II) gem a "worldwide, bleat domain '
