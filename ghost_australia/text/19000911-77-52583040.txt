"JACK THE RIPPER." "Jack the Ripper" is dead, says " Figaro." He died in a private lunatic asylum in England unknown to the ma- jority of the public, but his identity was fully established some time before his death. He was a medical student of good family and considerable means, and there is no reason to suppose that when his family first put him under forcible re- straint, they had any idea that he was the author of the Whitechapel horrors. Two prominent journalists, G. R. Sims and T. P. O'Connor, M.P., are among the few who knew the facts of the case. The whole matter has been kept very dark as it was felt that no good end would be served by reopening the case. The police authori- ties, however, were aware of the circum- stances and undoubtedly felt relieved when this human fiend gave up the ghost.
