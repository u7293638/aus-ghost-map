SATURDAY, JUNE 11, 1887. The correspondent who suggested a prize for a new national song, framed so as to appeal to all the English peoples evidently forgot that the empire is scattered over the whole globe. It wuld be difficult to find words and music that would express the senti- ments of Canadians and the settlers at the Cape, of Australians and planters in the tropics, unless we fall back on the hymn to the QUEEN, who is the centre of the national allegiance, and represents in visible state the unity of widely different provinces. Even a national song for Australia is not to be made to order like a suit of clothes or a pair of well-fitting boots. It might be written and set to music and received with popular favour, without ever touching such a vein of sentiment as is moved by the great patriotic composi- tions of the European countries. Many sones havo been submitted to the judgment of the public it is tho custom in soma places to hold competitions, in which tho audience decidos-but nono of these could bo called in any senso national A national song is one that evpiesses in music and in Y\ords tho deepest patriotism of the people ] very lino of the " Marseillaiso ' still rings \Yith the tumult and fervour of that c\citcd feeling \Yhich biought it hko an in spired gift from the pen of an nuthoi Yvho could not aftLiftiuls YYrite a stir ring Yerse 'Hie mention of tho Linne and the fatherland aio sulhcient to aYYako m oveiy German breast the en thusnsm of tint long stiuggle winch lia» YYeliled tho nation into one solid lock i1 thoLnghsh national Anthem is moie soler contained and less aggressive, it reflects all tho moro ftuly J_i«_tts]i chaiactn anil sentiment But Yvho could giYO YOK.0 to the feelings or aspirations of Australia, ivhen tho conn tiy itself is ns jet divided and dis united I An author 1111,5ht slug the triumph of tho eight horns movement, or tho lapid growth of cities, or Parliaments and their feats ol heroic talk, or tho Chinese poll ta\, or Mi Hmiit's glowing statistical pro phecioâ Lven if wedded, however, to tho finest music, nono of tlieso would inspiio a national song to servo as a link of passion between tho pooplo of tho north and those of tho south 'lint an Australian liteia tina YYill como is bejond doubt, but it ymII be sent, like all good things, "in the "fulness of the time" 'J.ho Austra hans are, foi tho most part, still sojourncrs 'iliey have not the history, thu associations, tho troubles, the common sentiments, and tho Raino hopes and feais by Yvluch tho national literature of ] uropean countries, created of ten by obscuio men, has been moulded llioiu is ono faculty which moncj and pn_es have never been ablo to call forth-tho faculty of pottiy A good substantial oller might britiK a fun col kction of \irses, but like collego poems and jubileo odes, they would probably bo doomed to a suro oblivion I ord Iinmsos, as has often buen itmn.rk.cd, is alwijs at his woist when lio wntos to carn tlio lnureatoa pittance ]f ono compares his lines on federation 01 tho jubilee, to say nothing of thoso which ha\ cheon written to colebi ato ltov al mar liases with tho billad of "lhoKovotigo " tho enormous dilleienco is obvious Iho former, in Inch aro uitoiided to appeal directly to tho feelings of ] n-lishtnen, fall its tamelj as the scribblinRs of nu ambitious governess, wlulo tlio lost, which is an account of n, deed of Lug lish \alour, has a ten tunos nioio inspiriting effect 'J ho ciiga_cinent o. tho I am catt to vulto stato ihjmos his been an ignominious failure fho ¡osition lias only boon hold twice bv pools of tho lust ordoi, and in both cases tho ollicial vork has rathol detracted from their reputation It would bo stiango if ii pn.c for a set task could create a pooin which is meant to express tho mind of tim nation in the most foieibloand ellie tivo way, or could nnoko tho "light that " newer was on sea 01 land ' 'i he poet, as Carlyii said, is a seer Literary competitors, whether in joun^ ladtos' journals or for moro substantial gains presonted by a Covet ninont, aio as a mlo not poets J ho growth of tho pootic fooling and of a national art ot a distinct and original tj po is slow and protracted In most of tho Amorican books written before tho Civil War thoro is a quaint, old world flavour, as if tho authors woro living prosperously, and fal ro moved from tho turmoil and doubts and speculations of actual hlo J hoy woro tranquil, meditativo, didactic, with a Puritan lu tendency to run into sor mons Lven now, -¿hough the Boston | printing presaos have enriched the Eng- lish languago with many beautiful and enduring compositions, the writers, with very foYV exceptions, aro more affected and didactic, and less impassioned and profound, than those of England. It is no detraction from the real merits of their work to say that it has less soli- dity and intensity than tho best work which is done by English poets. But to this daj' a good national song is still avvanting in America, where composi- tions of this class aro either affected oc petty and trivial. Reasoning' by analogy, therefore, it must be assumed that a poem thoroughly characteristib of Australia, and charged from the heart of Australia, is a thing of the futuro, The literature that wo already possess is in no aspect distinctively national. Adam: Lindsay Gordon described only a few side-scenes-some incidents of colonial lifo, and Kendall reminds his readers too often of tho style of tha English authors who were his models. Our writers havo either come from the old country, and are imbued wit its associations, or they are still compelled to imitate its examples. A genuinely nativo literature will gradually grow. The broad silent plains, tho Yvoirdness of tho forest, tha mountain scenery, all the climatic in- fluences, may tend to produce a species of poetry, on the whole, perhaps, calm and meditative, and yet with outbursts of the passion of the south. With poetical feeling Yvill come tho develop- ment of music, but neither art is likely to bo benefited' by prizes for set verses written after the model of well-known poets. English customs and institutions become, as n general rule, so readily acclimatised in Australia, that it may bo deemed worthy of notice tliat we hive as yet failed to provide a lasting homo hero for what is known in Eng- land as tho " spook " So unfamiliar, indeed, is this institution-if such it can bo called-that it may be oven de- sirable to explain to Australians what tho term implies "With regard to the etymological douvation of tho word thero is fortunately no difficulty at all " Spook " is clearly the result of an obvious, and it 13 to bo feared slightly irreverent, transposition of the initial letters of tho Urcek wold psuke, " soul," and by the simo arbitrary method the adjectno "psjchical" is vulgansed into "spookical," and a certain blameless association, which has been formed to investigate the pheno- mena of tho spiritual world, has been by an almost unpaidonablo liberty with tho original title transformed into the Society for " fcipookical " Research The connotation of tho teim "spook" pre- sents moto diiiiculty -ho snbject matter covered by the word is of so vague and uncertain a nature that the best authorities ha-,o shrunk from the task of defining its limits It has boon held that a " spook" can bo apprehended "by tho souses of sight, healing, and touch, while bolder theorists have not hesitated to lay down that it can on occasion be tasted and ovon smelt Putting asido all attempts at preciso definition, wo may be content to describo a "spook" as being some- thing dark, and subtlo, and uncanny, and generally of a nature to produce those sensations which aro best, though familinrl), known as " cicepy ' It moy, perhaps, bo a help towards a better understanding of the term if we pro- ceed to denoto various well known in- stances of tlio class 'Iho most ro spectablo members of tho family are, of course, ghosts, though in speaking of respectability caro must be taltcu to distinguish tho pin o gho.t of rare oc- currence from a cheap and adulterated aittcle, which, liko tho butter of com- merce, is not infrequently mot with.
