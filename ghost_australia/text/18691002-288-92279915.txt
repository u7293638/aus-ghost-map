REFORM OF THE ^CONSTITUTION i AOT. The absorbing interest attaching to the Government plan of increased taxation quite excluded the consideration .of other topics, or we should have again brought 'under'' the notice of' our readers' the; scheme introduced by the Government; for effecting certain changes in the con stitution of our two .Houses of Parlia-.. ment. As the public are aware, the Jsui for effecting *that object was rejected by ttie Upper House ; but tte question is one that ought not to be finally deter mined by the vote of that branch of the Legislature, and we nead offer no apology for introducing the subject once more to public attention. : The points in which the Government proposed to amend the Constitution Act were the following : — To make a slight addition to the number of members in each House. To increase the number of Ministers ..from five to six. To prevent Government, contractors sitting in Parlia ment. To make it optional whether the Attorney-General should or should not. have a seat in Parliament. To enact that . instead of one-third of the members of the ^legislative Council retiring every four years, one-fourth should go out when ever there was a general election for the House of Assembly. Such was 'the nature of the refprin proposed by tite ; Govern ment, but the i Legislative Couricilj' by a majority of 10 to 6, refused to allow the question to be discussed in Committee. The Register, quoting the: names of the majority, describes them as the ' solid ' voters, says' that Mr. Morgan's motion hinte suspicion of a ** caucus,' and fur ther remarks that the. idea bf some secret cohesion is countenanced by the fact that, with, the exception of ;Mr. Morgan, none of the gentlemen who voted against the Bill condescended to specify their objec tions to it. Of course our contemporary availed himself of the occasion to have another fling at Mr. Bagot; but the cause of ; this being so well known, no further reference to it is necessary. Now with regard to the rejected Bill, and the general question of the amend ment of the Constitution Act. It is to be regretted that the Bill was not allowed to go into Committee, and still more if this is the result of an unreasoning and 'secret cohesion;' as a caucus, any how, is only tolerable as a dernier ressort, and there is not a particle of cause for caucus legislation in the Council. It is almost universally admitted that the ex perience of the last 12 years shows that in several respects the Constitution Act needs amending, and when once in Com mittee the whole subject could have been freely debated — not only the Bill, but the question. Whatever was objection able in the Bill could have been struck out ; whatever 'was deficient could have been supplied ; and if, after all* the measure was not so improved as to please hon. -members, they could have refused to adopt the report of the Committee, and so the Bill would have fallen through. There was not the slightest necessity to carry it, up to the third reading, because of its having been read a second time, and hon. members knew that very well, inasmuch as they had just previously voted for 'the second reading of the Bill to amend Sutherland's Act, on the express and avowed condition ttiat if it was not -so amended in Com mittee aa to meet their wishes, they would; throw it out on the third reading. And a perfectly legitimate course too;; but we cannot see why the same principle should not7 have been' adopted with re ference to the Constitution Act ; and the more so, inasmuch as the necessity of its being altered in several respects was ad mitted on all hands, and because unless the Constitution Act is amended it, will be absolutely impossible to amend the Electoral Act, so far as relates to the number of districts for the House of As sembly. It is agreed without a dissentient voice-that Yorke's Peninsula must be sepa rated from Port Adelaide, and be erected into a new constituency ;*yet even this de sirable change cannot be effected without . an amendment of the Constitution Act, and the* Council have thrown out the Bill. It is true the Peninsula might be declared a separate district without amending the Constitution Act, if two other districts were to be rolled into one, so as to keep the total number still 18, but to this there would be great oppo sition, and it is therefore to. be regretted that the Council have refused to allow the Constitution Bill to be ' discussed in Committee, and have consequently d»» nied to the Assembly the. opportunity of rearranging iiheir own electoral districts: as desired. Certainly this is a very* ' solid' way of legislating. : It was admitted that it would be better not to insist] upon the presence of the Attorney-General in'Parliament as essen tial to the formation of the Ministry. It was admitted that it would be better hot to allow Government contractors to sit in Parliament. It was admitted that there were other points that required altera tion. These admissions |were . made by those who voted against the second read ing of the BiU, and- yet they refused to go into Committee, where; alone': those' clauses which they* approved could.; be affirmed, fand those which they disliked could be amended or rejected. We do not understand the Hon. Mr. Ayers's dislike to a full and dispassionate dis cussion of this' subject in Committee, because that hon. gentleman has more than once proclaimed the desu^Men«« & amending ,the Constitution Actl. btit w* , suppose 'the. new members ^whp J»T« 3^: :...^ been returned were of ppinic* '*&?f:,;.:- ihe Act which rjeturned them wat$ ,W. ^7; perfection. Of . course we except fi»n| v- this remark, the Hon.. Mr. Dunn, W$$,'~.r. openly declares his preference for nomi« .. n«ieism^-ran opinion that may dertainly claim oredit for disinterestedness. f .,, *Ehe great bugbf^was— 4he:prqpoul ,, that 25.per/cent- of Jibe inembera of the ; , Legislative -3outtcil ahpnld-gp to iiho ? country whenever there was a nsmral. -: ., election for the House of Assembly, fit -? is true the Chief Secretary said he wjpuld, not insist upon the retention :of; that ?- clause; and that it might be amended^. ; or struck out. Butno matter. Th»- ?:& ghost of public opinion haunte^Jhon*. , r members, and could; not be expressed. .?, But why need members of &a; Z«g»* .re lative Council '-be afraid of meetingtheir -,ri own constituents? If they hadto &cer; ... the. constituency of the Lower House, -. ,. the case would be different ; and we need . rj not remind our readers how oftea in th*; s Legislative Council hon. members claim r to represent especially the J^pprtied .; classes of tile colony. .On; tixe T£& -l«J j on which the Constitution .Bill .rwa» :~^ Ibhrown out, and not : two hours before, ? ^ hon. members cheered the sentiment at - Mr. Stow— -that as the Council .was elected _--?- by land purchasers and holders of pro* i perty, that House ought to have aainde* pendent and separate vote with respect to the Land. Fund. And yet, immediately afterwards, when it is proposed, tp send only -me-/otw*ft of the members to their constituents at every general election, the . dread of public opinion induced grave and solid senators to hurry the Bill out o£ existence ! If. at the proposed periodical retirement, hon. members had to appeal -, to the constituency .for the Lovxr Houfi, ? we could perceive the force of their ob- ~ jection, but as they would: only ia3re?to - appeal to their own' constituency, !we do not Bee whaVthere was to fear. W* hare often heard of electors declaring that they had no confidence in their representatives, and sometimes with good reason; but here we have half a score of 'solid' senators virtually declaring that they have no confidence in their own electors t '?' In these remarks we are not expressing ?-- unqualified approval of the Bill, or any thing like it ; although we think, as the Bishop of Adelaide says, that it 'erred by defect.' Other modifications are needed, . \ besides those introduced by the Chief. ' Secretary, and this is a strong reason''. why the House should have gone into* ,- Committee on the. question. With re-_s = ference to the additional Minister, the ' Hon. Mr. Solomon disapproved solely oa '] the ground that it would have entailed ft ' new salary. But that does not follow. - We heartily concur with that hon: mem ber in objecting to any further addition to the expenditure on account of the ; Civil list, and would strongly support a proposition for dividing the present salaries of the five Ministers amongst the six. r ^The remuneration would ' Bo quite : sufficient, and.the country would gam th« sendees pf an additional Minister without one shilling of extra cost. There is no ne cessity for such 'high- salaries ; what is '? now paid is quite as much as we can ? afford for the Ministry, and we are sure, ' With the keen competition there is for: office, that we should get quite as good ? a half dozen for the money that ire now p,ay for five. It is a great pity th© Bill did not go into Committee, as it might : have | been, almost entirely re-cast. We well remember when the present Consti- . tiition Act was introduced that the then Advocate-General (Mr. R. D. Hanson) said — ' Give me the title of the Act, and then insert whatever clauses you think proper.' And so it ought to be—rin a case of this nature-r-which is essentially different from ordinary- legislation. It is not proper -for a Government, raised to office on wholly different grounds, to dic tate a new Constitution to the country. . The things would be insufferable.. ISyen - one House ought not, in such a matter, to - dictate to the other in reference to. points ?? specially concerning the Constitution of e^ch House. Let the Assembly deter mine how many districts, and how many members they will have, how many shall .. form a quorum, and4-generally— all ques tions affecting its own separate existence a? a branch of the Legislature, and let the Council have similar freedom to settle corresponding questions relative to its own affairs. Of course, eventually, and before any Bill can become law, both. I Houses and His Excellency, on behalf of the Queen,, must concur in what is done ; and we do jiot say that either the Coiin cil or the Assembly should acquiesce in anytiring that is unreasonable, even in the constitution- of the other House, or that -would enable on« -House' -to- neu tralise the rights of the other. But so f aras the consiatutipn of one House does not mterferMwith; the rights and privi leges of thef other, and its faifshare.of weight and influence in the legislation of the country, each House should, to a considerable extent, be left by the other to shape itself according to its own ideas ?* Of public utility. Only in this spirit of mutual forbearance trad concession can any two Houses of legislation evir come to a common conclusion. In this respect, we agr^e with the Hon. Mr. Stow, thai there is no reason why one House-£hoTild be exactly double the number' of the other, or why one House Bhould dictate to the other how many shall sit within inaibers of ' iMs JancL; ana.
