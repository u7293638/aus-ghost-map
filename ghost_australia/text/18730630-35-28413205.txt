NÇTEB ON GHOSTS AND GOBLINS. ? /Otmilttixdfnm He Cornhill Mafaxm./ - Turó arc few subjects more-perplexing, eta a close nomination, than the ideas of men about the i super natural (as distinguished from tho . religious); Whether .-?wo analyse particular 'superstitions . and endeavour to understand what is -actually, believed respecting'them, or whether, taking a wider view, we consider the origin of the widespread- -belief-in-aupar natural, agencies, we lind .ourselves beast with diffi- culties; and these are only preumlnary to the groat difficulty, of all-that of determining how far it ts «asonable, ox; likely that ¡any of. :iho common ideas about the supernatural have any basis of fact what-1 may throw some light . happens; that the key to __._0_. more!.perplexing circumstances of the probier, we dismiss for the moment \ all 'those superstitions which'may fairly be regarded as derived frora early impressions, or as resulting from mero ignorance, and consider tth© case of well-educated. ? carefully trained, and not weakxninded persons, wno nevertheless at times; experience superstitious tremors, wo may per- haps'find. Borne circumstances pointing to the very origin of. the superstition now sq widely entertained. ";UneJwell~-marked, feature of these,' emotions is their 'occurrence in the., hours'' of darkness. I am not' speaking hera of-the feeling bf ! discomfort and /earll which many: ''experience : when ,in ;-theT dark. As respects the ordinary feeling of ¡dread In darkness, although theie can be no doubt that lt is'sometimes 1 engendered by the .talk of foolish nurses to yonrig ! children,' yet it is à mistake to suppose that this la the ! sole or evin the miWcause. : Some children.fear to'be j in- darkness who have never heard of ghost;or goblin;' I : A remarkable circumstance in tho superstitious im- pressions whic&i; affect those who havejio real belief iñ | anbsts and goblins is the. singular intensity of such : impressions when aroused fin whatever' way) immedl- I ately'ón wakibe;. Especially ' after dreaming, when 1 Jhe.dream'has been ot an impressive nature, the mind stems exposed to ideas of thc supernatural. Another circumstance which seems to have considerable efloot in preparing thè.mind-to' entertain superstitious ema- 1 tiona 1* intense-oz long-cbntitmed" brooding ort sor- rows, and especiallyon*.the losa'of onfy- Oear tous. Mingled with our (thoughts at .such .times, the. ido* ia il ways'more or less ?consciously- entertained) tnát'our lately-lost friend is near to "US, and knows our thoughts. Under the influence of emotions snell ns these, the mind is prepared to be- deceived.'. It ls it1-such times that yisions of the deported-have been seen. ; I flo not here speak of visions- called- up¡out of nothing-the healthy mind "eannct. bo so far betrayed-hut'of ?visions none the less imaginary. The mind basW creativo power to form such visions, except when there ia dUe«ed "and- abnortnol'action; but it pos- sesses a power to combine -real- objects so as to form pictures of the unreal,jind..this_powor ia singularly . activo in the,, time, of sorrowing for anear and dear friend. . -, . - .> :. ..7 .( ? I believe the'imaginatibn only acts' soi as, to deceivo the mind completely when the latter has been pain- , fully, affected, and is in an unhealthy; condition. "When this is the case, and a vision of soma, departed fi-iendris' conjured np out of realities -indistinctly seen, tho effect on tho mind will dopend greatly on the ideas entertained'by the victim' of ate illusion on the subject of ghosts end'visions generally. A believer, in ghosts will be too startled to inquire farther. If (s's happens in many instances of the kind) he can retreat from the dread presence, hé will commonly do so, and rem<iirt saw'in'the dusk of a large >oom a vision' of the poet which ."presently retolbed itself into furniture, 'Thea' cuiie 't^e .ease.' I have in my thought*.. A*: nearly aj J can remember the story ran thus :-A. gentleman who had lately lest his wife, looking out «fa window in the dusk* of'evening, saw her sitting in'-a garden .chair. He callid-one of:hia daughters- and asked'herw:lo'ik ont into the garden. ? " Why," ' she said, '"'mother ü shtinç there. -Another daughter was belted; and she experienced the samo illusion, - Thea,' 'the gentleman went into the garden, and found/that'. a garden:drè33 of; nía wife,'e'had bjccn placed over; tho soat in eruch a position, as .to produce the illusion, which- had de- ceived bimiicuf and his daughters. I know* of a more Acunóos: instance, -where .no explanation was ever found; simpïy-because-tho de- ceived persons were too frightened to seek for oaé- In . house in Ireland a-girllay dyihg."- Herrnother and father were with her : and her five swteES.w.ere 'pray- ing for her in a neighbouring". room/. ' .This rporh w-is well lit, but overhead there.Was a.skylight and the dark sky beyond. Ohé of the sisters looking - tip to- wards this skylight, saw there the. face of har dying sister looking sorrowfully down, upon 1 them. She seized another sister by the hand iona- pointed to the skylight; and one* after another'the sisters looked 'where she pointed. They spoke ho word j and ih a few momenta their father and 'mother called them to the .room where their sister1 had just died ; buV'when afterwards they talked together about what had hap- pened that night, it was found- that they had all,seek .tho vUion of tho mrovftdfac**:'. . r A remarkable circumstance in these and many other instances of supposed visions: is- tho utterly unreason-. able nature of the supposition actually made in the ? mind bf-tifo ghost-seer. - In the Btbriea where a ghost j appears for" .some' useful.purpose^ as to show where | treasure has. been concealed, or.'to reveal' the misdeeds : of some person' still living, thejmind.dbcVnotKject1 the'event as altogether " unreasonabK, though the' cir- I CTimstances may bê:(àhd: commonly- are) sutnoiëhtly j preposterous. Eu,* ono. ca;n, conceive no reason what- j ever why a departed, wife .and. another should make ¡ her appearance in a garden-chair.ou-.a dusky evening, j and still less why the^vision ot. a dying sister should j Jook down through a skylight. .'It is singular that ph ¡ this.account alone the mind doesrnot reject tho Ulu-j sion iii such, eases. : ':': . ? ' j Among"-the mott perplexing circumstances in the I \- common belief about- ghosts,' aré' tho accepted ideas j about ghostiy haTïUiments. Por Instance, why should: _ so many ghosts be clothed in white-? If the answer; ' is that grave-clothes are 'white/ we may inqpiire what; a ghost wants with giuve-clotbos?. Itmtghtas v/elli 'refuse to appear without 'a coffin.'.','And theil, many! . ghosts have appeared in their habit as.they lived.;. If' we inquire what is the real conception in trie ghost-j seer's mind os to < the nature of the vision, we find ¡ a difficulty in understanding what, idea- is' formed: by¡ , the real believer in ghosts respecting-the vestments itu -which spirits make their appearaiice. This ia'.au old¡ "difficulty. ' In fact, lt has probablyWcurre'd to'everyj ^pne who has thought over a ghost story.' So soon as; we cómo to the description of the ..ghost's. ycstiiieatsj there' is always a hitch' in tho story. . - > - < j Of course there is ho difficulty in the case çf thosoi ' who believe only in ghostly apparitions as .phantoms of ; the.brain.: .Here a distinction must be drawn, I in- not speaking of those who regard suoh apparitions'as! \- either due-to a diseased action ol tho brain or to tho, ' power of fancy In ' forming from Wal objecto', indis-' . tinctly seen, thc picture of a dépffrtcd friend ; but of ' those who look on visions of the dead as produced by ' supernaturslimprcssionBonthebralh.'
