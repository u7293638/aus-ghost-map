THEATRE ROYAL. , We beg to remind the Public, and more especially the admirers of the drama, that this evening will commence the temporary engagement of the celebrated Tragedian, Mr McKean Badiauan,who with our favourite Mr Warner, will alternate the characters in some of our finest Tragedies and Plays thus affording a treat which will be highly enjoyed.
