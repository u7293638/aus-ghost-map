Revelations of an Author's Ghost. „ ? I am ono of those shadowy and singular scribes, sir, known among literary men as author's ghosts. Tho necessity for our oxistonco arises from tho onormous pressure put upon our loading authors of to-day, and may bo briefly. explained nB follows :— A man of lottei's produces a novel which renders him populai*, nnd commissions for serial and short stories and articles pour in upon him from anxious editoi's all ovor tho kingdom— also, probably, from tho various literary syndicates. He at onco scents famo and fortune iu tho near future, and is anxious to accopt ovory proposal offered him. But this is palpably impossible, since ho ennnot cop'o with all the ? work single-handed, tt is at this juncture that tho utility of tho literary ghost is ? manifested. Ho is ono of a circle of clovor * writers, - who has had oxtensivo oxporionco, but fitful fortunes. As a rule, )io has scarcely sufficient to keop him going. Tho great author, on tho contrary, has too much. Thoy meet, and arrange for tho production of a cortain amount of material for a stipulated sum — generally a generous amount. But tho mattor produced becomes tho literary property of tho purchaser, nnd appeal's ovor his namo, and passes with tho unconscious public as his work. This sort of thing is now common enough in cortain circles of tho fiction-making fraternity. Hundreds of smart and charming Bhort stories,, which delight tho readers of tho. various journals and magazines of to-day havo novor been written or conceived by. tho groat man whoso fascinating namo appears abovo thom, but by ono of his paid hacks, or ghosts. This singular system may bo open to criticism, but tho cud probably justifies the moans, and if tho ghost and tho public are satisfied, Avhat moro uood bo said? A diligent ghost can earn about £180 per aunum.
