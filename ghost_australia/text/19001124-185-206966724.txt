SOUTH STREET COMPETITIONS. (3rd Prize.) ORIGINAL TALE. "THE LOVERS OF BARBARA GRAY.” "GOWAN GEM.” By Daisy Miller, Glenfine. "Sweet is true love," though given in vain, in vain!” Barbara's lovers were the worry of Mrs Gray’s life. There were three of them—the grocer round the corner, the new chemist in Main street,, and the young farmer who called every sale day. ■ v. - The grocer looked down on the.farmer,' ■ and the chemist turned-up hie-nose -at them both ! And Barbara laughed hear tily at the -ways of ail three, while her deft fingers diligently'.trimined bonnets in the latest style for the ladies of Diibiirra. flit’s those city fellows who have spoiled you, Barbara!” the grocer had remarked mournfully, on. Barbara's return from, a six months’ sojourn in town; “you weren’t half-as-provoking before you went away” —“nor half so pretty!” he mentally ad ded, noting the indefinable something that' had transformed a gawky girl into a hand some, self-possessed woman.- And the chemist, who had-black curly hair and soulful eyes, had sighed,.- and sentimentally whispered that love ihi the city had 'but a tinsel wand, and she must look nearer home for “the true gold” that endured! - .: But the-sturdy farmer had neither, hinted by word or look that he found tils sweetheart changed. She had only heard him mutter that’ “if any city fops- had been making eyes at his girl, and. chanced to come across his path, he’d knock the gimcrack lot of them into 'a cocked hat, or the middle of next week!” ' At. which characteristic threat Barbara had laughed-long and loudly. “You don’t get letters regular from any one, and you wear no' ring,” said Mrs Gray in a hopeless kind of voice, one after noon—-for she was bent on having Barbara “comfortably married;” “you never seem to hanker after going back to ■town,-, y et the way you go on, onC would-f. think lovers were- just 1 as -plentiful -as ’ black berry bushes! I was never like you when I was a girl, never !’—with a complacent sniff—“l never led your poor father a dance,.hut justipicked out the man. who could give me the best home, and was done with the matter. : - “I’m sure Mr Boss, the chemist, is a most eligible young man—half the girls in love with him-7-not to speak of the ele gant shop hej has, and all his own! There’s something so aristocratic .about the smell of a chemist’s shop”—aud the good lady pensively passed a highly scent ed handkerchief-across her face. Barbara smiled. “Don’t tou. think a-grocer’s <is a bit more in our -line, mother ?” she asked mis chievously. Mrs May’s father had begun life as a grocer’s assistant. " . “Those-who‘can look - high, and- won't,- look high;’’.answered l the-old lady, with] :some- asperity,“generally end' .their' days^— ■■: - . “Peed in g nigs!” 'broke in Barbara arch ly; “well, it may come to that yet—who •knows?” ' -, “There’s worse -’than Tom •Holloway,” said her mother ini a mollified tone; “he’s well in, and the farm’s paying.” 1 ■• “Money—or position! The same old thing always! . I’m sick of the words! Isn’t there such a thing as love,:mammy ?” ' “Of course, of course, my dear!—but it don’t always wear!” and away the old'lady, bustled. She didn’t like treading-on dan gerous ground... ... .. . ■ Barbara sewed:on; but hgr fingers were trembling, and a few-hot tears splashed on her ribbons and lace.- . She .was livelier than ever that evening, and amused-, herself by sticking up in. the back verandah.A'.broomstipk:dressed:in an old robe and h at, that she might have .the pleasure of seeing the'chemist wave to the figure from his .office window, and con vince her mother that .he; “wonld-; make love to anything, provided it. was in skirts!”:, ! ..The old lady-told the joke to Holloway, later on, and his hopes.rose. ;.But they were dashed to the ground.rnv.xt.iSunday,' when.

Yon are " quite.right! You must wait till you are sure of the' real- thing. But”—and his calmness suddenly deserted him, and he seized the girl's'hands in a'fierce grip— "while you are waiting for this ideal;lover;, give me-no/mpre of your ’smiles, which mean, nothing,’or, as'Heaven hears us, I'll make you /feel' it yet!” ■ ; ’ . ' And- off he strode, who- had always been the bluntest of the lovers of Barbara Gray, his head and shoulders thrown back- like a soldier’s the very embodiment of strength and determination—and closed the. front door after him with a bang that' carried consternation into - the heart ; of poor Mrs Gray, who thereby guessed, that her hopes were again dashed to the ground. But she was afraid to interview Barbara, so she stayed in the kitchen, bemoaning the perversity of young people who flew "in the very face of Providence” out of. sheer "cussedness.” Barbara watched Tom depart with a half-regretful look on her face, which was flushed enough now; then, as soon as he was out of sight, with the inconsistency of woman, she threw herself on the sofa and burst into tears. "I hate ithenrall!” she cried: passionate ly, " and especially him. How dared' lie speak to me like that! Make, .me feel, in- I deed. 'l’d. like to see the man that c'6iild!” and she glanced round the -room ehal lengingly, • . . The chemist -and the grocer had a bad time that week. Barbara wouldn’t look alt either of them.-$ She -was -"thoroughly sick of men,” if'she newer saw, one o(f the creature® from one year’s end to the other.” i.; "And Pd rather see a man than.a.tree, any day,” her long-suffering-' parent' had sighed; as She sat-bnd fiwirted> her thumbs despairingly. .-c o:..: . Anyway, Tom Holloway didn’t trouble the wilful little lady. She neither saw nor heard • of• him .for many a day- after his visit, thbidgih sHe went abouf more than ever. She would -halve put him. entirely but of her mind if she could; But, corned what to her surprise, she found that ,no easy matter. She missed' him in a hundred little ways ; .yet she had " never had as much of his company as of her- other lov ers. ... ' "Great ’ country bumpkin! Why" on earth do I keep thinking of him at all?” she asked, herself amgrily one brdghtafter nbfon, as she threw her work impatiently aside,: and donned her hat;and' "glove® to go for a brisk walk. "I will calL t© ;see Mollie Clayton on; my way. back, .and. hepir the latest neW, and have a gobd laugh.

Clayton’s , home was by a large garden, which had a dilapidated but picturesque-looking hack r entrance.; As Barbara returned from. her. hhlf-hour’s walk she went ini that way to save herself the trouble of going the lopg round, to. the front porch. She was just skirting round a iclump of laurel bushes when’ she'heard -Tom-Holloway’s voice.— Barbara’s face’ paled, and -she stood 5ti11,... .Them she heard Mollie saying earnestly—"But/Tom; if;you should be killed?” - ■ :: ! . His .familiar . laugh followed, .and. -the lines quoted, gruffly, yet with a ring of, deep feeling in-them:— ' ■ ." ■'" "And how can man die better than facing fearful-odds, -- For the ashes of his father®,-and - the:tern-, . : pies of : his . Gods ?” . , .“He’s ' volunteered for South Africa,”; Barbara muttered; , clutching, at a branch: 'near her; "well, I—— don’t care.” _ But her 'limbs' were' trembling, and her" face: was like marble.’ ; - - ‘ ; ■j She. had .given very, little thonght.-to the: war;'’Tt’had deemed J sO' far off from her' quiet life;:and the worst’.'of .it was over, • people, said.
