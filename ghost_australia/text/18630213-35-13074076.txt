THE HAPPIEST LAND IN EUROPE. i ON the right bank of the Rhine, surrounded by the spurs of the Penman Alps, in wondrous romantic scenery, lies a country which may well be called the happiest in Europe. It is a monarchy, yet has no budget, no public debt, no standing army no costly navy, no beggars, no bishops, no nobles, no bureaucracy, no prime ministers, and no income-tax collectors. The people of this felicitous realm live in peace and contentment, for there never was more than one lawyer among them, who drowned himself, years ago, in a fit of ennui; and most of them grow to a hale old age, out of sheer ignorance and for want of doctors. The name under which this extraordinary country is set down on the maps of the world is the Principality of Lichtenstein. In the dull books of geography which proposals sketch the earth and the fulness thereof, the land of Lichtenstein is described I are an independent State if South Germany, having an area of forty two and a half square miles a population of 7313 inhabitants and furnishing a contingent of fifty-five men and one drummer to the army of the Teutonic Confederation The most be ccntinvcbtigationBhave shown however, that these statistics are very nearly fabulous Lichtenstein is certainly quite an independent country among the States of the world, but its popula- ion is proved to consist of but 7150 souls, while, owing to treacherous movements of the old man Rhine, the area of the monarchy cannot be admitted to be more than thirty- nine and three quarters square miles, English measure As to the Germanic army of fifty five men, it never existed but on paper, and even the solitary drummer must be declared, after deep criUcol re scorches, to be as great a myth as the sea serpent The false rumour of the army with the drummer probably arosefitmthe fact of the sovereign possessing some three score livery servants, who were fond of parading the streets of the city of Vaduz, the metropolis of Lichtenstein), during the occasional sojourn of Prince John This temporary residence has recently become a notable matter in the history of Lichtenstein for it occa lined a revolution in the happy little Principality not many weeks ago, and brought into existence the newest constitution in Europe The people of Lichtenstein declare that they are fond of their sovereign, and it must be said that they have every reason to be so 1 They do not pay him a single farthing in the way of civil list, or any other kind of income but they expect him to spend a fair share of his private property within the realm over which he has the honour to rule On a lofty lock on the right bank of the Rhine, high above the city of Vaduz stands the old Castle of Luh eastern, somewhat in ruins in the upper part but still habitable in the lower and it has always been the earnest desire of the subject of the now reigning Prince, John II, that he should reside in this mansion as all his ancestors did His Highness, a young man of only twenty two gay and unmarried, refused to accede to this request, arguing that he had a right to spend his money where he liked Besides, he maintained that the old castle of his ancestors was haunted by the ghost of the cozy lawyer who had drowned himself in the neighbouring Rhine, and that it was, therefore, no longer a fit residence for a sovereign prince Nevertheless out of sincere affection for his beloved subjects, John II expressed his willingness to send his thieves îe and odd footmen for a month or two in the year to Vaduz, to enliven the hearts of the fifteen hut dred inhabitants of the metropolis, and to show them the latest fashions from Vienna It seemed a far offer on the part of an independent sovereign who has got no civil list, but the people of Lichtenstein, nevertheless, refused to listen to it. The agitation continued, growing to such an extent, that at last the Parliament of the country had to take the subject in hand The national representation of Liehunstein-consisting in virtue of a Constitution granted by the predecessor of John, on November 9, 1818, of on Upper and a Lower House, the former boasting three life peers, elected by the clergy , the latter eleven deputies, chosen by all citizens worth two thousand florins, and, as particularly ordered by the law, ' not quarrelsome assembled accordingly in the spring of the present year After some we in debates both Houses resolved to send a deputation to Prince John II , residing at Vienna, and to request his Highness once more humbly, jet seriously, to leave the distant capital, and take up his abode among his own subjects The deputation armed at Vienna in August last, and was received by the Prince with the greatest cor habit j A long series of conferences then took place in which his Highness condescended to explain to his subjects the whole state of the question from his own point of view He showed them, by numerous briefs and documents that he was the sole owner of more than a dozen mediatized principalities and hard ships of great extent comprising the vast domains of Iroppau and Jagerndoif, in Upper Silesia, and immense estates in Moravia, making together an area of 220 square miles, with a population of 360,000 souls, and an annual revenue of more than two millions of florins His Highness argued that, as the Principality of Liechtenstein was happy in not possessing a budget at all, and as his subjects did not think it worth while to pay him for the trouble of governing them, they could have no claim upon his place of sojourn and the Prince wound up his statement by appealing to the good sense of the deputies, and leaving it, to them whether it would be hard to persuade him to reside at the haunted old castle of his and store, instead of in lively "A lenna, so near his vast domains and his really profitable tenants The arguments were too strong not to convince the deputation, the members of which at length returned to Lichtenstein, to report to the Peers and Commons of the realm New discussions ensued, the upshot of which was an unanimous resolution of the two Houses to elaborate a new constitution, in conformity with the spirit of the age to which was added a request to Prince John li to build himself a new royal residence at Vaduz his own expense, of course and to reside therein during at least part of the year In the face of such unanimity, and seeing the reasonableness of both demands, with the imminent danger before him of losing his popularity, His Highness con formed to the expressed wish of his subjects and, while sending an incorrect to "A aduz, at the same time approved the proposed national charter of Lichten stem The new constitution came into force on the 15th of October, last, and is held to be, by German politicians the most perfect in the whole world. The preamble of the new charter recites that the people of Lichte intern are determined to uphold the liberty and independence of their country, and will obey no laws but those made by their own representa- lives, in Pay bement assembled This is a thrust at Austria who is believed to have influenced the actions of the legitimate sovereign for some considerable time To prevent all recurrence of foreign control, the prince for the future must either reside personally in the country, or, during his absence, appoint a Governor general, in whose hands the whole executive force is placed The legislative power is to be, as before, entirely in the hands of the national Parliament, but with this important alteration, that there will be only one House of Representatives, consisting of fifteen members, three to be chosen by the reigning prince, and the other twelve by the people, in public election The property qualification for voting are considerably reduced, but the old condi non concerning quarrelsomeness remains intact, and is to be more strictly enforced than ever Moreover, every man who goes to the poll has to give proof that he can read and write and has received otherwise a fair education, and no person is admitted whose reputation is not satisfactory in the opinion of twelve of his neighbours The Parliament was formed must assemble at least once a year, but it may sit oftener according to the necessities of the country i All high functions, that of the sovereign included, are be honorary as before, with the exception of the post of Governor general, to which is allowed the handsome stipend of six hundred florins, 01 £60 per annum Lastly, it is provided that there shall be no taxes imposed upon the people otherwise than by a vote of three-fourths of the national representatives in two successive parliaments, the second of them expressly elected for this purpose To conform to the requirements of the German Confederation, of which Lichtenstein is proud to be a member, cheifly five fighting men with the drummer which the Principality has to contribute to the Teutonic army of reserve, are henceforth honestly to be kept ready, not merely on paper, but in blue and scarlet reality They are all to be volunteers, however, to prevent even the shadow of taxation making inroad into the happy land of Lichtenstein The publication of the constitution of Lichtenstein a, little more than a week ago, has made an immense sensation in Germany, which, as is well known, is just now labouring under rather severe constitutional trials The subjects of King William I, in particular look with envious eye upon the cb trees granted by Prince John II, and many of them seem not indisposed to clamour for something familiar in their own country But what appears to give supreme satisfaction to the Germans of allnaUon duties, from ReusB schleiz Greiz to Schworzburg Sondershausen-Rudolstadt, is the one chamber system at present inaugurated in the principality of Lichtenstein In the whole of the thirty States of the Confederation, without exception, the Chambers of Lords seem to have proved failures in some instances to such a degree that even the sovereign and his ministers wished to get rid of them as an unmitigated nuisance The new principle of the Lichtenstein constitution, therefore, which gives to the monarch the right of election of nearly one fourth of the representative es, in lieu of on upper chamber of legislature, is calculated to gain the assent of not a few among the more liberal rulers of Ger- many Prince John II of the House of Este-the same house from which our own Royal family trace their descent, has already worthily begun the exercise of his new political privilege Before even the people of his principality have chosen their twelve representatives he had named the three deputies, the selection of which the constitution left to him The trio are declared, by universal consent, to be in every respect the most worthy men in the country. One of them is the former professor, now minister, Anthony Gmelchj a man well known through the whole of Germany for his eminently library attain- ments. " A new era is dawning upon Lichtenstein," exclaims an Augsburg journal, discussing the constitution and the e nominations The "era" is very men serve, no doubt, and its elements are not without a shade of ludicrousness ; but there is also not a little in it that is extremely serious and worthy of attention. It may seem to many that Lichenstnn remains more than ever the happiest land in Europe. Spectators
