THE COMET AND THE MORNING HEY. to THE EDITOR or the Argus SIR-I find, by a late notice in Titi. Aig that the honour, if any, of having discover the comet is claimed for New South Wale but as there is no doubt whatever, as can easily proved, that I saw the comet on Saturday, I must put in a claim for Victor Indeed, had I not felt almost certain that the Mondays Argus I should have read notice of the discovery from our Observant I should have written to youmjBelfon I Subject However, it is not of much cows quence, I presume, who first saw the bed tiful object now visible every clear event and morning in the south-western and soul eastern sky. My object in now addressing you again that, as an ardent lover of the in my opinion grandest of all sciences, astronomy, I wish draw the attention of all persons, partie larly the young, to the magnificent sight he presented to our view every clear morning from soon after Pam in the eastern new on one which, I believe, will not be witnessed again for a long time About r o'clock the first faint glow of light begins to illumine the skins " twilight steals with ghost like treat further and further upwards Looking to wards the east one instantly recognised the beautiful planet Venus the queen of the night-as she shares with extreme brill and On the 6th of this month she will I seen at her best, and is now a splendid object in the heavens Close to her app' rently, is the planet Saturn, to quote lVoctc chosen by the alchemists as the represent: tive of the heavy and lustreless metal lead the contrast between the two planets i most striking, and now they are, apparently so close together that a full moon would cover both Below the pair is another; planet, the stately Jupiter, inferior in brilliancy to the queen of night, but still a splendid object in the telescope far above the three, but still visible by merely means the eyes, is ruddy Mars, gradually getting higher; and brighter, or, I should say, rudder one rudder, every day as he approaches our earth Rj slightly turning the position to the right the attention of the spectator is instantly at rested by the apparition of ihemjBtenonsviat for from the interstellar depths-the comet On Saturday morning I obtained a capital view of it, and notched it for some time it musterers brighter, and its tail better defined, than when I first saw it 'thus at one and the same time, it is now possible to see the four planets, Jupiter, Venus, Mars, and Saturn, and a comet into the bargain, under a clear morning the spectacle is indeed grand in the extreme Yet I wonder how many there are who will turn out of their warm beds to witness the Bight It has often struck me that much good would arise if the name generation at oat schools and colleges could receive practical lessons in astronomy from such men M I Uery and White What a capital opportune my is now afforded for so doing Very few young men have any idea of the wonders of creation, and I think a few lessons in agronomy, explaining the air and motions of the planets, would go far towards shatter- ing the materialistic and atheistical ideas which appear to be gaining ground, not only among grown up people but the youngster. To one who rightly understand the wonders of the solar system, so well ew&plified; at the present time, the utter foolishness of all such ideas must be quickly made apparent And there is no doubting what we so plainly see what has been proved by astronomers, and what is brought so vividly before us in me telescope , Respecting the comet, as an amateur astronomer, if I may venture to consider misers such, I would, if not trespassing too much on your valuable space, conclude with the following extract from one of Proctor j " A comet is seen in the far distant depths of JP is a faint and scarcely discernible speck 2 45" nearer and nearer, with continually ."""¿KF velocity, growing continually larger and bring"' Faster and faster it rushes on until it (lay nearest approach to our Bim, and then, """a ¿ around film, It begins its long return v-W "T infinite space As it recedes, It post I"; S T fainter, until at length it passes beyond theories the most powerful telescope made by "»»ij"°\t Been no more It has been seen for the I"1; 'L time by the generation of men to foT.
