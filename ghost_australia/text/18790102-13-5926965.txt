THURSDAY JANUARY 22 1879. -. The attempts which have been made by the Ministerial press to bolster up the Government by representing that the country has not suffered so much, after all, by the reign of Mr BERRY and his colleagues, are really amusing, because they are all based upon statistics belonging to 1877 exclusively whereas the real mischief was not come invented until 1878 the latest issue of Mr H vi TER s Year Book deals with the former year, although in some few instances the figures are brought down to March, 1878 But these are such as relate to agriculture chiefly As te gards the commerce and consuming powers of the population during the year that has just ended, nothing can, of course, be learned from that publication But the table of imports and exports which we gave yesterday tells a very unpleasant story in this respect in all countries such figures are accepted as the safest tests and surest indications of general prosperity or otherwise Under normal conditions of society in ports and exports naturally expand 'the use increase of population should insure this expansion Every year there is an accession to the number and to the productive forces of that portion of the population which is engaged in indus lal pursuits Not only so, but there is also a large addition to that which is, in many branches of industry, even more important, namely, the mechanical power which is now so great a factor of wealth On the other hand, by the excess of births over deaths, there is a steady augmentation of the number of consumers Thus, then, there should be a greater surplus of production to be sent abroad, together with a corresponding increase in the demand for those articles of mi port which are received in exchange for the exports wherever, in the countries of the old world, an arrest of m dustrial development takes place, it is clearly traceable to certain causes which do not operate here In America, for example, there has been an enormous destruction of capital by a civil war of unexampled magnitude, attended by a frightful waste of human life, and by the diversion of no small part of the national industry from the arts of peace to the fabrication of implements of destruction, army and navy clothing, and supplies The large on culation of borrowed money which was necessitated by the war, created a fictitious prosperity, and prevented the sale ruinous consequences of so costly a con beet morn being felt for some few years But in 1873 the reaction commenced, and since then the history of Arno lican commerce has been a monotonous narrative of losses and disasters In the mother country, there has also been a contraction of business, partly on account of Eastern famines, partly on account of the impoverished circumstances of one of her best customers, Brother JONATHAN, and partly because every nation in Europe has suffered within the last few years by the end se of war, and has consequently less to soil and less to buy In this colony, however, we have been hitherto exempt from such calamitous restraints upon our progress and prosperity, and we have been enabled to fulfil, under the reign of Her Majesty Queen VICTORIA, the prediction which SHAKSPEARE made CR VNMER utter concerning our countrymen under ELIZABETH In her day a every man shall eat in safety Under his own v me what he plants and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours Nevertheless we are not advancing as we should do. On the contrary the re turns just referred to show that we have been retrograding during the year 1878, for a comparison of the transactions of that year with those of its predecessor gives us the following unsatisfactory results - Imports in 1877 £13 484 978 Imports in 1878 12 186 777 Decrease in 1878 2433 201 Exports in 1877 £13 917 719 Exports in 1878 12 751S70 Decrease in 1878 £1208170 Here we have a total falling off of ¿£1,701,371, or something like 6 per cent, upon the business of the year, in spite of the increase of population, and of the alleged growth of our manufacturing industries, and of the export trade connected with them under protection No doubt the trade of this country has suffered to some extent in sympathy with the general collapse But this will not account for the whole result shown by the returns above referred to Perhaps also we shall be told that this falling off of nearly a million and a quarter in the value of our shipments from Victoria, should be accepted as a sign that we are working up our own raw material, and consuming our own produce If so, trade would have been very active for all such products would reach the consumers through the ordinary channels of distribution But what is the fact ? Ask any banker, merchant, or shopkeeper in town or country, and he will tell you that this has been the worst year for business which has been witnessed since 1854 and 1855 People have been living from hand to mouth Money has been scarce The wholesale houses in Melbourne have had to sustain their country customers by renewing their acceptances from time to time, and the provincial traders have been hopefully calculating upon a good harvest to enable them to draw in the sums owing to them by their numerous debtors There HLA ei was a Christmas season in which so small an amount of money was spent by holiday makers, or in which a shilling '. possessed so much value in their eyes, as in December, 1878 Under the withering influence of the " Bony " blight, all our industries are suffit ing, simply because the incendiary language and i evolutionary policy of the party in power have destroyed public confidence in the stability of our institutions, have led to a considerable efflux of capital from the colony, have checked every description of enterprise, have restrained house and landowners from laying out money in the improvement of their properties, have dried up the wage fund of labour, and have induced the more timid members of society to retrench, so as to be the better able to meet the dire eventu- llities threatened by our political life cause Ker; Until these have been replaced by men who are identified with the industries of the colony, is there any immediate prospect of a permanent revival of prosperity The Land Act of 1869 expires with the present year, and in the next few months must necessarily be discussed with a view to its revision The in terests at stake are enormous We can only hope that vindictive Legislation will be a thing of the past, that dreamy, Mew ey legislation will also be ignored, and that the public trustees will consent to be guided by experience in an effort to turn the national property to the best account possible for the community as a whole It will be a duty on our part to point out from time to time the issues involved as regards the future and the results which have been obtained in the past, and we shall discharge that task in the spirit just indicated, with the sole desire that past failures may not be a price paid in vain. We pointed out recently some evidence of the growth of a reaction in New South Wales against the principle of free selection at a nominal price, a principle which has exercised a baleful influence throughout Australasia, and has disappointed none more than the Wilson G day school, who were its pro- motors In New Zealand, this year tion has reached a head, and has culminated in action e legislation by the Radical party there New Zealand has had this advantage, that her land system has not been uniform So many pens races, so many land laws Not a system but has had a trial , the results are palpable, and the fittest system may be expected to survive In Otago, where naturally Victorian ideas at one time prevailed, the leading principle of late years has been " special settlement ' indiscriminate selection has been stopped The Government has from time to time thrown open such areas as seemed be quoted for the purposes of settlement, and if there is competition for a lot it is sold by auction In Canterbury, selection has been allowed at £2 per acre in Marlborough the system has been sale by auc turn at a low upset price, in Southland and in Nelson, free selection before and they at a nominal price has been the rule A correspondent of the Sydney Mail, writing in the name of " Pere " gi mus," has recently reviewed the operation of these systems, and he points out now that the contest is between those of Otago and of Canterbury The others are admitted to be failures The first act of the radical party on coming to power was to stop alienation at a low price, and £2 per acre was made the minimum term, and repeated inroads have been made on the right of free selection in the provinces in which the principle still exists It is the working man's party which has done this, because the working man has seen the folly of the system recommended to him of old The writer in the Mail does not point out the cause of the failure of free selection at a nominal price in New Zealand, but it is evident from his record that it is the same as that which has operated in New South Wales and Victoria The population in New Zealand is utterly inadequate to the cult ation of the land Hands are not in proportion to acreage The bulk of the land must either lie idle or must be grazed upon by sheep, and if land is put upon the market in excess of agricultural requirements, to the pastoral occupier it must go as inevitably as water runs downhill And the effect of free selection at a nominal price is to glut the market Directly or indirectly, the whole territory is offered for sale, and in Australasia the consequences are always the same, namely, that the land natu really fit for sheep glaring is acquired in freehold for pastoral purposes and the state parts with its property wholesale for a song So with the provinces of New Zealand In Nelson, there was free selection at 5s per acre The idea was that every man with £25 in his pocket would pick out a 100 acre farm, but a gentleman well known under the cognomen of " Ready money EOUIN " SON," took up 100,000 acres for £25,000, and his example was rapidly followed Southland, when it separated from Otago, retained the principle of free selection, and the result was the creation of 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 acre blocks The selector was not ousted When he parted with his hold ing, he did so willingly, and in order to make a profit, and he could go some where else The state was the sufferer, for it obtained practically no settlement and very little money We are told, and can readily believe the statement, that the present generation of Southland members are the most determined opponents of free selection which the New Zealand House of Assembly contains In Marlborough, where tracts of land were parted with at auction, large estates are the order of the day, and Australian experience will certainly bear out the dictum of the New Zealand writer, " that indiscriminate sale by auc " tion is little better than selection be " fore survey as regards the promotion of settlement " On the other hand, in Otago, it is now proposed to pay for railways by the gradual sale of the public estate at its legitimate value It was decided last session to construct 110 miles of railway from Strathnaver; to the Clyde, and Mr MVCWDKLW, III his public works statement, adds "It is now proposed to extend the line "near Clyde to Like Wanaka, a distance of GO asks, for some 50 miles of which the country is as level as a bowling green, the whole of it being in the hands of the Crown and available for settlement And the writer from whom we quote adds - "So much for the difference between " a good land S} stem and a bad one as regards the economy of the public " resources Had any astern of free " selection been in force in Otago dance " the past 10 years, it is, of course " perfectly certain that all that country " between Clyde and Lake ^ make, a " 'level as a bowling green,' would long " ago have passed out of the hands of; " the public, and it is so highly pro- " bable as to be next thing to col tun that, in spite of all the conditions "'of purchase ever invented, it would have passed into the hand; " of some half dozen Dunedin met " chants, squatters, 01 speculators ' That is to say, the capitalist would have picked up the land at a low figure, would have held it for its full value and the agriculturist in search of cheap selections, would have had to go further and further a field, and the public estate would have been rapidly exhausted the Canterbury system was only a rough and ready way of obtaining what is called " a sufficient pace to in sure cultivation the 22 per acre always demanded did much to check speculative selection and the acquire ment of sheep farms in freehold, but the whole set of New Zealand policy is apparently in favour of the Otago plan of limiting the supply) to the agricultural demand All this evidence leads up to one point, namely, that in no country where there is a demand for land for pastoral purposes is it safe to throw open the entire teintoryfoi selection at a nominal price The system has only succeeded in countries where there was no demand except for agriculture, and consequently where it was not subject to any strain on the part of landholders and speculates In our situation, the only guarantee against a wholesale and wasteful alienation is either to limit the supply, and put the lots up to competition at a fair upset price, 01 to classify the land, and sell only at prices which, to the agriculturist, would be fair and reasonable, but which would not be readily paid unless the land was to be turned to agricultural account This is the natural precaution When it is taken the pastoral tenant lives in peace, for he is not disturbed except by the bona-fide agriculturists, and the state continues to hold its waste lands in trust for future generations Such are substantially the views enunciated in the recent minority report of the Lands Commission now sitting here The popular party has adopted, them in New Zealand, and if an impartial and attentive healing can be obtained, we shall be secure of their success in Victoria also That very useful person "who in " telling foreigner, who reads this Mommas A) sic, and at the same time remember what has been said by the members of the Government and some of their supporters about the people of this colony being "slaves,' and bound, metaphorically speaking, to the chariot wheels of a triumph at ' oligarchy), men of a combination of v picked monopolists, must be somewhat perplexed by the apparent contradiction between the unrestrained freedom with which people enjoy themselves on New Year S Day), and the desperately enslaved condition in which they are supposed to exist during the rest of the) ear He would not fail, also, to be struck by the very obvious fact that the oligarchy have not succeeded in monopolist is not the money , or that, if they have, they must have been very liberal yesterday in their largesse to their well-dressed, cheerful-looking and respectable " BHVOS Supposing the foreigner aforesaid to have visited the racecourse, 61 the Survey paddock, on the Friendly Societies' Grounds, he would have faded to discover the slightest trace of manacles 01 gives, and he would have observed that the young people danced and romped with a freedom of merriment indicating that their limbs had never known the galling eviction of a force of any kind Neither would he have discovered the slightest expression bordering upon servility m then countenances On the contrary, they were a sort of " I'm " every bit as good as you an, which is altogether foreign to LAWRENcE STERM, s tboExetei hall, or Mrs BEECHER STOWE S idea of slavery And the people enjoyed themselves not with the w lid transports of men and women released from their shackles for one day in the year, with the knowledge that on the morrow the lash of the ohgaichand the good of the monopolist would resume their torturing sway, but in a leisurely, easy going spirit, as if they had left no particular troubles behind them, and were not looking forward to anything unpleasant to day In fact, our intelligent foreigner would be apt to feel the same astonishment which the Russian soldiers did when they entered Bulgaria, and found out how prosperous and contented the peas mary w 010, so that some of thcinvedeisweie temptedtoechotho exclamation of LLEOH S cabman, who, seeing a tipsy swell, whom one of the bystanders supposed to be ill, enviously observed " I only wish I had half his complaint And there are millions of people in Europe who, if they could witness a general holiday in Melbourne, and were told that the festive of public w 000 the slaves of an odious oligarchy, would spoil taneously exclaim, 'MYo only wish we " had half their complaint No doubt the vv 01 king classes in this colony might be much better off than they are, but this will not be until we get a Government which will attend to the wants of the community, and strive to promote the interests of all, instead of manufacturing factitious guev dances, and sowing of melons dissensions between class and class The future of cricket in Victoria is a subject which appeals to give a good deal of concern to the numerous admirers of the game with a larger population than New South Wales, with everything that could be desired in the way of opportunities and places for practice, and with the cricket passion strong upon the youth of the colony, Victoria fails to hold her own, and is beaten year after year by the rival which she formerly hold so cheap The cause of our inferiority would appear to be, according to the letters of correspondents which we have published from time to time, that the cricketers of Victoria are animated by a clubbish rather than a nation of spirit Petty jealousies are allowed to prevail, preventing the unanimity of purpose and interest which is so essential to the improv fluent and development of the gillie There is the main MI at hand, but no proper agreement as to how to select and make the most of what we have got Without going into j particulars, it may be said that this is a pretty accurate description of the state of public opinion in the in matter The letter of an old cricketer, which we 1 published yesterday, is to HIL s vine effect, and offers suggestions for remedying the existing condition of things which are do stn ing of notice One of the most im- portant is that proposing the formation of district teams, which would occupy hero i position sorrowful analogous to that of the county the una in England As our correspondent points out, it would be much more conducive to good cricket for district to meet distinct than for club to meet club, and the plan would have the further advantage of bringing in the country players, who as a close left out in the cold With regard to the idea to which our correspondent seems to attach particular x due, that the M.C.C. should be " eliminated from the list of playing " clubs, its ground vested in an assault " tion, and its funds devoted towns main " tenance of a Victorian eleven,' the change is too radical a one to expect to bring, about But there are other and where practicable ways of strengthening the "arno, mail we think that no better steps Id be taken, to begin with, that the appointment by the leading clubs, as sut_,L,estcd by our correspondent, of a committee which would give the matter the tiniest attention it demands Some

the fire in the house where she was living while in a state of intoxication At a quarter to 2 o'clock yesterday a fire broke out in some premises at the rear of Messrs Fergusson and Mitchell's printing establishment, No 37 Little Bourke street east It appears to have originated in a waste paper shed, from a list. it extended to Messrs Buckley and Nunn's stables It was first discovered by Constable Barrett, and a young man named Cornelius Maher, both of whom acted with promptitude and with a considerable amount of pluck, there were any horses in the stables, and between them and the door the flames were blazing 3ft high Barrett and Maher dashed through the fire, and proceeded to rescue the horses One was seized by Maher but he could not get it to face the flames He, however, hooded it with his coat, and then got it out in safety Another was liberated by the constable By this time the Metropolitan m Lngude had arrived, and whilst they were extinguishing the fire, which they did in a few minutes the constable and Mr Ludwidge, Messrs Buckley and Nunn's foreman, removed the rem using horses the damage was confined to the burning of a portion of the stable, some hay and, straw in an adjoining left, two spring calling standing in the yard, and a quantity of basket making material help guns To Mr Aviegmiuin which was lying at the rear of his front shop he person

requested to state that Francis John Longmore, who passed the last civil service examination is not a pupil from the St Kilda Scotch College, as stated in the hat which is peared in our columns

The Council have recently offered terms of settlement so high to any other than professional agitators or demagogues of the most pronounced type would have been considered very accept- able and perfectly reasonable It is nothing to the point to argue that the Council have been forced to do this against their will The proposal is on record By certain resolutions passed and transmitted to the Lower Chamber, the Council have offered to reduce the qualification of both members and electors of the Upper House, and to submit to dissolve, tion upon any measure of policy being rejected by them,andadisputeensuing between the two Houses There are other matters of detail in the proposal which we have not space to enter upon at present, but they will be fresh in the minds of our readers, and will lead them to the conclusion that Sir Michael Hicks Beach was perfectly justified in the view expressed in the despatch that there is nothing in the surroundings of the whole case to warrant such, an exceptional proceed- ing as an appeal to the Imperial Parliament. Mr Berry and Mr Pearson are going home without any credentials from the people, for the question has not been submitted to the electors They are simply the spokesmen of a subservient majority in the Assembly, a majority to whom £300 per annum appears to be of more moment than the future welfare of the colony and a majority consisting of men who would quail to go before their car stituents on this very question of sending a embassy to England We believe the embassy will turn out nothing more than a glance, am that besides squandering Li 000 of the Victorian revenue it will serve to bring nothing else but ridicule upon that colony " "An amusing narrative the Riva in ijciaMsays, has reached us of the adventures of one of the tickets of admission at the recent embassy banquet A few day before the demonstration a commercial gentleman residing in Melbourne was in Echuca and knowing that his railway fare would pay 20s , the thought suggested itself to him "that it would be advantageous to proud himself with a ticket for the banquet rather than with the ordinary passport n did so, and thereby effected a saving of 158 Gd He had no intention of going to the banquet and upon his arrival in Melbourne was quite satisfied with the transaction so far as it had then gone, am thought nothing of utilising the ticket further But on his way from a ; station h fell in with an *nc,iun,ntance who had made me his mind to do honour to the ambassador's the Town-hall, and who it is not yet provided with the necessary card of admission and to him therefore he offered his ticket a the reduced price of 7s 6d an offer wine was readily accepted, so that the cost of his journey from Echuca was now reduced to 3s The ticket was duly presented in the evenings and the railway pass attached to it was shipped in the proper manner, and returns to its new owner, by whom it was placed in his pocket as valueless But the next morning he was accosted by a friend as he had occasion to travel to Sandhurst, and the result of a very short conversation was time the railway pass again changed hands at a cost of 7s 6d Thus, as the means of securing the attendance of one man to do honour to the two ambassadors the first individual was brought from 1 chuc i to Melbourne at a loss to the revenue of 20s the second was' conveyed from Melbourne to S intlhnrst at loss of 17s and the third had the gratifica- tion of eating, drinking and listening to liberal oratory all night for nothing The Belfast Gazette reports -"A large full rigged ship apparently homeward bound stood close in to the coast near Belfast or Saturday forenoon under a good press of canvas On the night of that day, at about half-past 10 o'clock, Mr Theo Sanders at tention was directed to a very bright glare in a southerly direction out at sea 'increase lasted for about 20 minutes, which leads us to suppose that it must have been more than the usual Have up or blue light on board a ship to indicate her position to another ship, or for attracting at station in case of an accident Per- That's it may have been the light of a patent life buoy, the fumes of which are calculated to burn about the length of time during which Mr Sanders observed the glare in question On inquiry we have ascertained from Captain Symons harbourmaster, that the ship above referred to passed Belfast on Saturday, standing to the westward, and tacked at 2 p.m., when about three miles off the lighthouse, The ship did not show her number or any other signal, but Captain Thomson, of the as Nelson, has since in formed Captain Symons that the vessel was a horse ship bound to India, round Cape Leuwin, and it is thought that she was the T Theophane "Itis endent, ' writes the Hobart Town Mercury, " that Mr Berry is rapidly making Victoria the laughing stock of the colonies. The embassy to England has been ridiculed and condemned It has been pointed out with what appears to be unmistakable clearness how futile, how impotent for good, such a delegation must be a et Mr Berry persists in his determination to enjoy a trip to England at the country s expense, and interview the Secretary of State for the Colonies It is disheartening to those who recognise the injurious effect which Berryism is having on the present and future welfare of the colony to witness the lengths to which the Government are going because Ministers know that everything they say and do is accepted without an objection by a facile and yielding majority the most of whom can be described as nothing but party hacks Cor- ruption and jobs are now becoming un- pleasantly frequent, and we vi who view these things from a better at md point than those residing in the colony, can only express our surprise that the people are so blind as not only to submit to such wholesale degradation, but actually to encourage it. But the embassy is undoubtedly the crowning piece to the disastrous and absurd tablet which Mr Berry and his colleagues have raised to themselves and were it not that he would lay himself open to the taunt of having been compelled to surrender to the opposition and ridicule brought to bear against the project there is some reason to believe that it would have been abandoned This has become all the more probable since the receipt of the last despatch from Sir Michael Hicks Bench How the embassy can now face that gentleman with any hope whatever of getting the r wishes granted, is more than we can imagine The wine production California, rem with the New York Graphic, steadily increases It is true that a great many viticulturists in California have failed, but so much capital has been invested in the business, and the growth of the demand for California wines has been so steady, that the owners of the California graperies and wine factories are not disposed to abandon the field with less It is estimated that California this year will produce about 10,000,000 gallons of wine It has been a moist year, and the foreign varieties of grape have done uncommonly well The Mission and the American grapes proper require a somewhat drier season than Call forms has had this year Of course, this product of 10,000,000 gallons seems small compared with France a product of 100,000,000 gallons. But France is some thousand y years old, while California is, as it were, of yesterday Considering the time occupied, the wine product of California is something really marvellous There is a very large business done in this city filling hock Rhine wine, and even champagne bottles, bearing European labels, with California wines A great deal of the wine sold as hock and Rhine wine is really grown in this country A large demand, which in one way is a detriment to our native .vvineraakers, comes from the manufacturers of artificial champagne They buy cheap native wines at about 40 cents a gallon, they mix these with cider, put in some flavoring ingredients, and then charge the mass with carbonic acid gas This compound is sold at ridiculously low prices, and many foolish persons think they are drinking champagne when testing time artificial mixture There is reason to believe that it is unwholesome certainly it is not to be commended as a wine that any decent human being should drink " We are beginning to learn something practical about our heavy turret ships, ' remarks the Daily News of November 7 "The first of these, the Devastation, has just returned to Portsmouth yard, after a long spell of service in the Mediterranean. The second, a sister ship, the Thunderer, has arrived at Malta, to take the place of the Devastation A third, the Dreadnought, has already completed the trials of machinery and armament, and is to be commissioned at the end of the month, while the fourth, and most formidable of all, the Inflexible, is to make a six hours run of her machinery in Stokes Bay next week Each carries two turrets, in which Area pair of guns, consequently the whole armament of the ship is but four cannon In the Devastation there are a pair of 35 ton Buns in one turret, and a pair of 25 ton guns on. the other, so that for a long time past She has carried heavier metal than any other battle- ship in the Mediterranean The Thunderer, which has now replaced her at Malta, carries a pair of 35 ton. guns in one turret, and a pair of | 38 ton guns in the other, bring 7000 shot a shell The Dreadnought, the third of the sea is armed with four 18 ton guns, which, he ever, fire 8001b projectiles, while the li the Inflexible, is to receive on board the fe 80 ton guns now being finished at Woolnit capable, it is said, of projecting three quart ton shot and shell is or is it only in regard to their guns and armour that the sin differ.

The first was in reference to the training of teachers When sometimes the Church of England was charged with being an obstructive in the way of educating the people, it should be remembered what she had done He did not deny that other religious bodies had also done their part but it should be remembered what the Church of England had done in the training of teachers According to the last report of the Council of Education there were 3 027 students in training colleges for teachers, and of that number 2111 were in train- ing colleGes belonging to the Church of England, so that, roughly) speaking, out of every three teachers, two had been trained and put forward in their profession by the Church of England Then, again, it appeared that in all the elementary day schools of the country that were recognised as fulfilling the requirements of the Education Act, there was in the year 1877 accommodation in the church schools for 2,171,000 children, in British and other denominational schools, 003,000, in Roman Catholic schools, 213,000, and in Board schools, 701 000 Out of a total number of 3,653,000 places provided, the Church of England provided in her schools accommo ditionfor 2,171,000, or for two out of every three children provided for in the elementary schools of England Those figures were a sufficient answer to any person who said that the Church of England was not doing her duty, or not trying to do her duty, in regard to education Then in regard to average attendance, in the same year there were 2 150,000 children in attendance, of whom 1,270,000 went to Church of England schools, 330 000 to denominational schools, 117 000 to Roman Catholic schools, and 427,000 to Board schools He thought, therefore, that churchmen could very fairly long back any reproach that was brought against them by any person when it was said that the Church of England, and the clergy particularly, were great obstructives to the education of the people. He regretted that the support given to the National Society was so contracted. the present was, perhaps, an unfortunate time for putting forth the claims of the society, but as church people they recognised the invaluable services the society had rendered to the Church of England at large and to that diocese in particular " The city organist will play the following selections on the grand organ this afternoon, at 4 o'clock, M7 -overture, "Preciosa' (Weber), grand offertoire adapted from " Kreutzer Sonata ' (Beethoven), Batiste , opera selection, "Lohengrin" (Wagner!, by special desire , grand march, " The Festival Day (Spinney), oratorio selection, " Messiah," in , air, "I know that my Redeemer liveth," chorus, "Hallelujah" (Handel), finale, National Anthem. The Theatre Royal was filled last night by a thoroughly holiday audience The representation of the pantomime was received with frequent laughter and applause, and Mr Hennings' scenery came in especially for strong marks of approbation. " Under the Gaslight " continues to be the attraction at the Princess's Theatre. There will shortly be produced at this house a piece by Mr R P Whitworth, called "The Three Ambassadors " It is intended to introduce character portraits of Mr. Berry, Professor Pearson, and Henderson Africanus. It will he remembered that Mr Whitworth was very successful some years ago with his " Catching a Conspirator, in which Mr Harwood gave a clever imitation of Barry Sullivan. The extravaganza of " Pluto," at the Opera house, has become very popular. The grand fairy fountain is one of the most attractive items, and the 30 tiny but clever performers in the baby harlequinade are always certain of a cordial reception. The Blondenettes had a capital house at St George's Hall last night. The burlesque of "The Moon-struck Youth, or Diana the Fickle," is received with great favour.
