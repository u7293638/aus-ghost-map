LUMINOUS. SPECTRES. The optical Illusion in which the image of a person is observed alongside of a real in- dividual upon the stage of a theatre is familiar to everyone. The trick, first brought out under the name of "Pepper's Ghost," and which so often exhibited in one form or another by prestidigitators, may be performed by anyone very simply and with a few cheap materials. Take a pane of win- dow glass and support it in a vertical posi- tion by means of two heavy books, and in front of and behind it place a playing cord supportld by a pin. Then place a candle near the glass. By causing the light to ap- proach or recede from the latter, one will soon succeed in placing a very distinct spectre of the card in front of the glass alongside the one behind it. - Tissandier, In "La Physique sans Appareils."
