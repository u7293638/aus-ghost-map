" Wane1 Who is that—the mother of this, boy ?" asked Laura, still on her knees beside the carñage. ; "Yes, madam." "Wane—"Wane I What have I heard in conneotionwith thai name ?" she murmured, then aloud, " These look-like English child ren." . - . ' " Mrs. Wane is Englie V said theboy,with a oantioaa manner and war? look. " 1 thought so. And the papa?" "He is dead." ",0b, .how dreadful 1 And that pfetty* woman is a widow. Does she never come on deck ?'' . . -I P13« yes, sometimes, bot mostly after twi light. She suffers bom sea- siakness." ,"1 should like to know, her." The boy was silent. Laura played with the while hand of the cherub, who seemed4o take a particular fancy to tbe small feather in her hat, and laughed and showed his pretty psarl^of teeth. # ' " How strange that the face reminds me of some other familiar face, and I can't place it,"" ehe said to herself. "Oh, there is little mother now I" «tied Dalton, bis faoe radiant ; and that moment' Eden made faiB, appearance, moving un steadily, until Dalton gave her bis hand for support. She eeemed surprised far a mo ment to see the dainty, handsome, high-bred woman paying humble homage to tbe child, bot could not do less than smile and seem gratified. " "Tour beautiful baby has stolen my heart," Iianra said, playfully. - Howprond yon most be of him r " I am'a little proud of him," repliedEden, casting a loving glance at the boy. "Ha doesn't look a bit like you." " Ob, no ; he favors bis father," she made reply, in a low, faltering voice. Laura turned a little aside. " She cannot bear yet to speak ol him^she thought to herself. "You are not a good sailor, I see" she, added, alond, determined to make tbe most of her Interview. "Not very ; I don't like the sea,"and Eden's pale faoe gleamed whitely coder the silver spray of « gossamer veil. ' " And is this your ' child also ?" asked j Laura, as little Dotty, who had been indulg ing in familiar gossip with an old gray-beard suddenly came into tbe group. She looks, like yoa." _ ..." "Yes, this is my little girl," murmured Edén, drawing the child jealously nearer. " My darling, I think we must send the maid ' foi your hat," she said. 1 " I never saw such lovely children," con tinued Laura," really honest in her admira tion; and such clearly different types of beauty I I mast ask my friend over here, may 1 ? Ant I taking too great a liberty ?" "Oh, no, indeed, no," said Eden, smiling and gratified. " lsoline4" called Laura. '• Isoline I Mira Huntley 1 The wind ia the other way, she doesn't hear me and IÁnra rose to her feet and crossed the deck. She did not see the expression that 4&me; into Eden's facejis she spoke the name; the sodden catching of the breath, the drawing back of the body, and flash deep and pained, tbe qaick rifing and falling of the cheat. -•" 'Isoline I' did ehe eay ; Misa Huntley !' Oh, only too well I remember that name I It was on the letters I foand, and he said it was the nom de plume of a lady who wrote for the près?. Oh, haw that name has stirred mel I sever thought I should feel like this again. I hope it is not hate.1' ' She was all burning was cariosity now. to see the face of the woman who had innocently or otherwise corresponded with DnnniBton, thongh she shrank at the same time from the sight. Bat Mara had spoken to her : Eden saw the lithe, slender figure rise, with that peculiar swaying motion indicative of su preme refinement, if not of gentle blood, and her heart grew sick, though the author of her jealously was, as she thought, far beyond the chance or change of her judg ment. Isn't he beauty itself." For one supreme moment Eden felt in clined to lift the babe and hide his face in her bosom ont of the woman's sight, but phe forced herself to see how unreasonable and even childish such conduct wonld be. She sat there stolidly, instead, of holding her veil down like a mast." " Isoline 1" ehe had heard her husband speak the name to himself—she had by chance seen the letter whose reception he tried to cover with a jest. Yes, she was very beau tiful—aho could not but acknowledge it— very queenly, thoroughly br • ■ elegant in manners, peerless in expression -that is, ex pression cf a certain kind. Isoline was also thoroughly charmed with the child, and the little Aristocrat held his dainty head hack and finally csnsented to give one of his hands for the lady to kiss. "Are you going to London?* asked Iso line of Eden. " "Oh, no!" was the oold reply, "Iam going to my old home in Streatford. I have never been in London in my life." " Isoline I" eried Liura, all of a sadden, her cheeks growing a shade paler, " I have jnst thought whom that child resembles. I have been trying and trying to think, until goaded to desperation I gave it up. But^ohJ I see it now; What a likeness 1" "Well, who is it?" # "Lord Dannistonl" The (fleet upon the two women before whom that name was pronounced, under such strange circa instance«, was widely in each. Isoline flushed a little and smiled, .while a supreme content seemed to irradiate the whole face. Eden grew oold, white, reti cent. She turned, away from them all, and drew her chair back with a manner that seemed to say, " The interview is over, . I ¡de sire to say no more to you, to have no mon "to do with you." Dalton and Dotty were having long walks together. With a motion of her hand she brought them to her side. í'1?*1'0" win yen caU the nurse?" *he MfeM^with quiet dignity. ««My boy û r"5.ell,^Tr WM 8(lCBt "* üfe ?" said ih.«». 11 J¡¿ tWnk i did," Isoline retorted, wa«WM«perttj. always did think it a most unbecoming filing to make advances »strangers.
