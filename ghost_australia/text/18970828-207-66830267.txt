LOVERS 'OF WARMTH. \--4- The invention of fire was a great step in the progress of the human race, and it is not strange that so many uncivilised peoples have superstitious notions con nected with it. When our Australian aborigines camp for tihe night a fire is lighted'in front of each hut-the huts be ing made of boughs, with the openings carefully turned away from the wind- so that the feet of those who are sleeping within maybe kept warm. If one of their relatives has lately died, an additional and solitary fire is lighted at a little distance from the huts, where the ghost of the deceased may sit down andlwarom himself without disturb ing the family hearth. In fact, warmth is so great a necessity Illaan.ateivfs a. r-al..oy sacra to think tile dead can only by degrees become accos tomed to the want of it, and the airing of a grave by kindling ' fire within it is a very imnportant ceremntony at a funeral.
