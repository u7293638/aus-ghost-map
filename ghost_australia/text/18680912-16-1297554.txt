THE FATE OF BEING DEAD WITH OUT KNOWING IT. From the Pall Mall Gazette, July 1. "At said Lord Chesterfield in the days of his age, " poor old T Frawley and I are both of us dead, if we only knew, it. It is astonishing that this fact of people being dead for years before they are buried is not more commonly perceived and acted on than it is and not people only, but books, newspapers, institutions, and whatever else is capable of having life and keeping the appearance of it after the reality has come to an end For look where we will on every side you see incurable and in capable tapping and stumping hither and thither with all the pretensions and any of life as if they were in the hey day of a career, while in truth they are only as spent cannon balls toothless vv watchdogs, ghosts, 01 whatever emblem one may choose for what was once something and is now nothing A book for example, can presents an amazing an of vitality and popularity for years after all the truth that was once in it has been absorbed into current opinion, transferred to new forms and expressions, 01 owing to change of circumstance, has ceased to be true at all. It is notorious that a journal may keep most of its reputation and ever so man of its readers long after any intellectual sap has ceased to flow in its columns, and after it has begun to give its readers instead of fruitage mere abundance of dry leaves and sticks And so of human beings It is immensely difficult for a man to know when he is dead, to know, that is to say, when he has lost the faculty of moving along with his time and living in its foremost ideas and aspirations, when he has no longer anything to hope for not much to care for, nothing to contribute to the common stock, nor much to receive from the efforts of other is, not an) will to receive it Of course it may be said that from this point of view a great many persons are as good as still born to begin with And this is quite true there is something partly pathetic and partly comic in the number of men and women whom one meets in the world who have never been quickened into life by the stimulus of circumstance, and yet who move through their existence with all the manner of active creatures 1 they eat and drink and, to a certain extent have the gift of articulate speech, and they go with catalogue for human creatures But what of all this simulation of life? They only move in a pint I is imagine nothing comes of them except a certain blocking up of the way for the living These persons however, are to be borne with, if without sympathy, also without active with Angel directed against blocks is a waste of a good thing The case of those who have lived and live no more, jet remain on the face of the earth notwithstanding is different Their obstructive power is of an active sort, and, with the reputation of their lives to back them then chances of doing mischief are most seriously ample Take a politician for example, who has been bred up in principles that have become sacred relations with him, and which appeal to him to contain all things that are needful to salvation The reasons which recommended them to him may have been good seasons and for their time they may have suited circum stances to perfection But circumstances change, and unless the man changes too, and shifts his ground to match, then all the good which he did and got the credit of doing becomes in the public mind a ground for cou turning to believe in him, and so past benefits grow into a root of present and future home) The Americans are often we proached with then shortness les towards them statesmen They have a quaint pro- veil about the exceeding smallness of ex presidents let would it not have saved would it not even now save,Lnglaml many troubles if some ex premiers and ex politicians of low elegies were to fall into as small estate as that of men who have held high political office in Annie ice The good that men do perhaps dies with them ; it were no bad thing if they should die when they has e done As bat good they can For this is just one of those prices where our English fashion of severence, good and gracious as it is in so many respects does us real harm and will continue to do so until some magician has confined on states men authors, and all others whom it may concern the admirable quality of knowing exactly when they are dead There is not one leading man out of fifty with this rare gift of knowing when the sap has ceased to flow when his agility in moving with circumstances is passed, when the time his come for the retirement into the cool and graceful region of tempers dence There are so many reasons why even a good man should be reluctant to acknowledge that he has a foot in the political or speculative grave His methods haveansweiedin past times, why should they not answer now ' He was in active life when his opponents were in the fourth form at school, for he was studying the highest problems in this or in that when they were puzzling over Us very elements surely he must be the wiser, Ac ' the other side of all this is not apparent to him that the very qualities which enabled him to understand and to grapple with one set of circumstances may most effectual!) unfit him for the comprehension and settlement of the next set presenting themselves To put it into a formula-a human character is much more likely to stiffen than human circumstances to reproduce itself Perhaps the world finds this out most constant) and most expensively in the case of mill tary people No experience is able to drive out of the heads of a Government the idea that the veteran must be the right person and the best person available to place in command Because old General Scott had proved himself equal to the conduct of a war in Mexico, the American Government argued that he was the best man they could find to fight a territory of thousands of square miles The poor man was, in point of military capacity as dead ten years ago as he is now English military history is a long chronicle of the effort of men with life and an alert vision to break the monopoly of command enjoyed by creatures long defunct How much force has been lost to the country, wasted in this heart-breaking and miserable struggle, no mortal man can tell We can only imagine it from the spectacle of the same port of waste still visible to anybody m he has eyes to see, and from the sound of it audible at this moment by any body who has ears to hear The penalties which a people pay for their adoration of experience are a great deal heavier in the long run and spread over the total than any minds the idea tion of nastiness and audacity would be likely to cost them Only the penalties are mainly negative They do not assume the shape usually taken by the penalties of audacity, of tremendous and striking disaster about which there can be no doubt, nor denial, nor mistake The mischief of the rule of the dead lies in the number of opportunities of which they rob us, of the achievements that might have saved us but for them, of the heroes who would have risen up to deliver as if they had not been kept under as though they were flames of destroying fire instead of rays of healing light It is something of an open question, whether the men who were once wise, do not inflict more ill upon us than those who were always fools That they have the best opportunity is certain It is the latter, indeed, to whom they almost indebted for this opportunity It may be said that the great aim and characteristic of a wise practical philosophy is to keep men out of the horrid mental fit of being dead, while thinking that they still life, by or belonging mental activity, or to use a piece phrase, the faculty of taking an interest in a great number of objects, as long as there is any sort of consciousness left This is perfectly true, but it is not quite the whole truth of the matter To take interest in things is only a virtue when your interest is untainted by the poison of egotism Most people would like to see good things done, but a considerable proportion among them would make this conditional on the things being done by themselves, or at least in their own special way The very activity of interest displayed by the unconscious defunct is just what makes them so truly pestilent 'The wise and virtuous man is he who is keenly anxious for this matter and for that, and jet insists neither on his own position being in the front, door on his own peculiar methods being implicitly adopted Not to sum up the universe in your own individuality is the beginning of wisdom Mon possessed of this wisdom are conscious that each of us only marches as one in a vast and numberless army What one can do is as nothing When he has fallen under the burden and the heat, the great host marches on and on as before To think much on this, much on the race and little on self, is the surest way of avoiding premature death Consciousness of the immeasurable sire of all life in comparison of any one, even if that be the most important, and how much more if it be of the least important, is probably the most in- dispensable of these elements which keep a character wholesome and lifelike With this element the chances of one's unconsciously passing away to limbo, and yet persisting in fluttering and gibbering among old scenes, are indefinitely lessened The Eloquence of Grief -The inhabitants of a thriving town of Pennsylvania having as assembled, as was their custom, to decide what number (if any) of spirit licenses the town should petition from the County Court, there was a very full attendance One of the magistrates presided, and upon the platform were seated, among others, the pastor of the village, one of his actions, and the ph) sioian After the meeting had been called to order, one of the most respectable citizens of the borough rose, and after a short speech, moved that the meeting petition for the usual number of licenses for the ensuing year He thought it was not best to get up an excitement by refusing to grant licenses They had better license good men, and let them soil The proposition seemed to meet with almost universal favour The president was about to put the question to the meeting, when an object rose in a distant part of the building, and all eyes were instantly turned in that direction It was an old woman, poorly clad, and whose careworn countenance was the painful index to no light sufferings And yet there was something in the flash of her bright eyes that told she had once been what she then was not She addressed the president, and said that she had come because she had heard that they were to decide the license question 'You' said she, "not know who I am You once knew me mistress of one of the best estates of the borough 1 once had a husband and five sons, and woman never had a kinder husband, mother never had five better or more affectionate sons But where are they now ' In yonder burying ground there are six graves, filled by that husband and whose five sons, and they are all drunkard's' graves ' Doctor, how came they to be drunkards p You would come and drink with them, and you told them that temperate drinking would do them good And you, too, sir" (addressing the parson), " would come and drink with my husband, and my sons thought they might drink with safety, and for low your example Deacon, you sold them rum which made them drunkards You have now got my farm and all my property, and you got it all by rum And now," she said, "I have done me errand I go back to the poor house, for that is my home You, reverend sir-you doctor and you, deacon, I shall never meet again until I meet you at the bar of God, where you, too, will meet my ruined husband and whose five sons, who, through your means and influence, fill the drunkard's grave " The old woman sat down Perfect silence prevailed, until broken by the president, who rose to put the question to the meeting-" Sholl no petition the court to issue licenses to this borough for the ensuing year? and the one unbroken ' Not" which made the very walls to echo with the sound, told the result of the old woman s appeal Pbofek Instuoctiov -The right instruction of girls is much neglected Even in some of the best schools, showy acquirements are preferred to real knowledge A lady who has written upon this subject makes some sensible observations upon the varieties of character and the different modes of treatment they require After remarking that in striving to destroy a fault we should be careful not to overlook the virtue that may accompany it, she says -" An impulsive, rash, self confident character is also active and energetic A selfish, over careful disposition, contains the germs of prudence An indolent character is usually gentle, and unwilling to accept provocation A jealous temper is an affectionate one As irritable temper is sensitive, quick m perception Vanity is the exaggeration of an amiable desire to please and to reason why so much good advice, or advice which is meant to be good, is received so back) by those to whom it is offered, very often is, that in touching the fault, the virtue is touched also, and then the natural instinct of self defence exhibits itself in the form of on excuse Now, if we wish to give advice which will be palatable as well as true, we must show sympathy with whatever is natural and innocent in the feeling which has been aroused, before we give a caution against exaggeration " There should be a reception and encouragement of the good that may exist, whilst the evil in condemned which accompanies it. We must go out of ourselves to be ourselves in any lofty sense No man can truly call that his own which he has not himself made his own, ! none are really happy who have not earned their happiness by self-sacrifice WOMAN in Japan -It is permitted to parents to sell then daughters, for a term of years, to the business of prostitution, and it is not disgraceful. This profession is legalised. A quarter of the city is set apart for them, where they have a good houses, and in companies, under the direction of a manager They dress well, live well, and receive visitors without shame or compunction they are also visited at their house, socially, by families in good standing, and it is not an uncommon thing for men to seek here for wives. The girls who enter this life study various accomplishments, such as music, dancing, &c; and are among the most attractive women of the city Their life is not a disgrace They exchange visits with their parents and friends in the city. With regard to their marriage— there are many men in the city who wish to marry an accomplished woman, and who cannot marry one from among the upper ranks or who cannot pay the requisite "dot." Here they seek and find such wives as they want. The law provides a careful tariff to be paid for the unexpired time of any girl who leaves the establishment, that paid, also becomes free. Many of the waiters in the tea gardens are not virtuous. They, too, hold their social standing. It is most strange and so natural to us; but the question may well be asked, How much better or worse is our custom ? There is no degraded class in Japan, no reeking streets or quarters, no wretchedness, no frightful, hidden iniquity. Whatever the evil, all is apparent. It remains true that the condition of woman in Japan is vastly superior to that of any Oriental nation. She is subject to no se- clusion, she shares the occupation and amuse ments of her husband, she is almost sure of marriage, she has useful occupations, she is not trampled in the mire. Infidelity in the married state is rare, and is severely dealt with The husband holds the avenging sword in his hand, and may inflict death Here may be mentioned a strange fact, not found anywhere else. Modesty as to the person is unknown. The Japanese, being excessively neat, and bathing mostly twice a day great bath houses are found in various quarters of the city. At many of these there is no separation of the sexes, and both men and women go through their ablu- lions entirely naked without the slightest idea that they violate decorum or delicacy. Evil be to him that evil thinks. They think no evil, and who can say what this practice leads to? The best authorities do not think it promotes licentiousness Shocking as this is to us, it is not shocking to the Japanese They are appalled at the horrors of the "social evil" in a New York, and in London, and in Paris and he hove that they are purer than we -Putnam's Magazine An Abbey Vergeh -Amazement is too mild a word for my frame of mind, when the vergers of Westminster Abbey single us out during divine service, and after marked personal attentions deposit us in the stalls next the dean It seems such a palpable mistake Pride and shame contend for mastery while we are being paraded down the aisle and a confused feeling that I must be somebody else without knowing it is strong within me as we run the gauntlet of choristers and congregation until our ex named place is reached But mingling with and overpowering this internal conflict, is a conviction that I have met the cloaked figure now acting as guide in some previous and less solemn stage of existence His gait, his hair, his gestures, and Ina face are all familiar, and when, wand in hand, he left his leading desk and approached our standing place I was cogs taking half unconsciously as to where I could have seen him before Cogitation became per plexity when I found myself selected from the crowd and not the least puzzling part of the business was that the faces of many of the black gowned officials seemed equally familiar Dore was I publicly recognised by one verger, and with a conviction that I was on speaking terms with the rest, and yet with a certain knowledge that I had not been within the Abbey walls for years But that my companion was equally favored, and yet maintained his calm, my presence of mind would have forsaken me " employ them at my house to wait, and you saw them at my last dinner party is his whispered explanation, when I ask whether he often attends the Abbey 'services, and if not, whether he was known to the vergers elsewhere ' This told me all Shampaguo lock, or sherry were the words I had previously heard from the highly respectable lips at the desk before me and the anxiety with which my little difficulties in finding the anthem and the palms of the day were watched had in it some of the polite difference which distinguished the administration of a pleasant and well ordered house.
