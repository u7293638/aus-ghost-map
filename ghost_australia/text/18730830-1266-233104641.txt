He never raised himself from his lounging posture when I went in ; his threats had ceased, as though he had no longer strength to utter them, and I was deceived. Then your words came upon me like a thunder clap, and I knew that somehow. he must have loosened one of the iron bars which, since his profession of weakness,. I had ceased to examine at every visit, and got down by means of the branches into tho ooppice. I suppose he feared to leave it later, becaase at my next visit I might discover the bar. I followed him, asj you know. We grappled by the Red Pool. He was no match for me, and I should soon have conquered, and brought him back, but. my foot slipped on the frosty grass, and. we fell both of us into the pool. ' The deadly coldness of the water, over which a thin sheet of ice had begun to creep, seemed to numb every bone in my body; the struggle then was for life or death, and that ope arm of his had clasped my leg. Alice, I would have saved him j I could conceive (OO horror greater than that he should die jbhrough my means.

So strange and unnatural did the whole miserable story seem, that from time to time it occurred to me vagut-ly to rouse myself, and throw off the wandering of a bad dream. Bu* the bed was always there, and the haggard face on the pillow, and the twitching hand, aud beyond these there lay the 0' e armed man at the bottom of the Red Pool, with the ice creeping on him. ‚Ä¢ When there was a sound at the door, I unlocked it quietly, and went back to my seat. I had nothing to s y to the woman who came in, neither did she speak to me. She stoodjat the foot-of the bed and looted at him as he slept. . I thought I heard a muttered ' Coward !' but I could not be sure; then she went away. About noon, he awoke. His eyes fixed upon me at once; with the terror in them still, and his parched lips said. witjh difficulty: ' Save me.' His right baud seized mine convulsively, and I shuddered. It was the hand which had stricken down the single arm of the dead man. If I could have forgotten the fact of this single arm, I might have felt less horror, but I could pot. I was bound, however,to conceal my thoughts. He ,lay. there helpless^ and must be helped. I spoke to him as calmly as I could,, but his face lost none of itsagpny. Presently, he turned it away from me, loosing my band. ' Did I tell you about it ?' : His voice was quiet,: and <Lsaid : *.Ym..' - : ' .

Day after day passed by, was gone, and drifezling rain )difMn6d the window, but I heard nothing ^jf'him. -Starting at every sound, ^vhidimade me'see -in- imagination the bb'arerg'of a ghaetly burden come out from under the willows; perpetually ory, and the terrible ' whidh hung over the miser- . f^1¬Æ man upstairs, I felt that my own ' ' rtre Ogth was-giving way, and there was I one to fa elp me.

They decided that he must have strayed from the proper public path, which lay past the Red Pool cottage, and so have fallen into the pool. There was no mark on the linen, and the clothes Were like the clothes of the one-armed vagrant. There was a verdict of * Found drownedand, they, the newspaper authorities, deferentially suggested to the owner of the properly the desirability of railings or some oiher protection round the Red Pool, as many accidents bad occurred there. I had read all that, Mark also reading it over my shoulder, but not understanding that it had any fearful interest for me. The now owner of Raventree lay on his bed dying, and we knew that lie was dying. A slow fever seemed to be wasting him away gradually, and as we stood in the room waiting for him to awake. Mark whispered to me that there was a doctor in the house. But we both knew that he could do no good. The sleeper awoke; his lips were moving, and they said indistinctly the sentence which he was perpetually repeating : ' I am a dead man.' ; He said it deprecatingly, as though it would ward off the weight of reproach, and contempt, and horror with which men would load him. When be saw Mark, the terrible working ofhisfea tures began afresh, and his lips formed the words : ' Save me.' Mark moved round towards the ted, but he waved him away feebly, and motioned him to me. He wanted me to raise his head on my arm. I had done it before many times ; I had no horror of him now. Of his crime and his temptation I could be no judge ; there seemed to be nothing for me to con- Eider but that he was there, helpless and most miserable, dependent on ine; and in my pity for his suffering and remorse, I forgot there was any reason why he deserved to suffer. He was more to me now than he ever had been, and I even shrank from the thought of telling Mark that wretched story, lest he should speak harshly of the dying man. I raised him up, supporting his. liead half witb. a pillow, half with my arm, to speak. . ‚Ä¢ ' There is no time now," he muttered, ' no time', Then he fixed those wandering ayes of his on mo, turning' away from Mark. ' He knows ndthing ?' 'Nothing yet.' ‚Ä¢'''' -'‚Ä¢ 'He says, this Mark Femham, soon to' be master of Raventree, that he wishes to marry, my step - daughter, Alice?' ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ' Yes.' The answer came from Mark, but the gla-sy eyes never moved from my face.' 'Tell ium that, though no disgrace or the shadow of it has touched her, yet 6he belongs to a dishonored and degraded man; a criminal, who is dying. Let him say if, in spite of that, he will marry her.' . 'He will.' 'If he will set it down on paper, and sign it, asking no further particulars beforehand, so that when he hears the Btory he will not be able to draw hack.' ' I am not afraid; I will do that,' said Mark. And as he had answered steadily, without hesitation, so he now wrote down what my stepfather dictated, silencing me with an imperative gesture. . ,‚Ä¢ ( Then there passed from behind, the curtain a tall lean woman, with knitting in her hands. ' ; . . ' I will sign my name as witness,' said this woman. ., -.-> . My stepfather's. ‚Ä¢ face grew ghastly, and I made a motion to repel the housekeeper. . ir, ' You will not turn me away V she said. . ; 'Yes. I kno.yv all.' : !. 0 'You think-.you do, no doubt.' .. And she wrote in a bold round hand, never taking her eyes off me while I looked at it, ' Martha Femham.' ' That is my name. Ask him, if you doubt me.' ‚Ä¢ ' It is true,' said my stepfather;' yet keep her away. That was the price she demanded of me.' , " - 'I am Geoffrey Fernham's lawful wife. There were many reasons why I ch^i, ir yiai'i'y. him. I did not do it for the position, which, in fact, I have never filled' ‚Ä¢No,' broke in Geoffry. 'Because, if danger had arisen to me, my servant' in the kitchen, obeying my orders igriorantly, would have had nothing^) do with it. The marriage in that case was never to be acknowledged.* A- ' I repeat,' said Martha, 'that I had manv reasons He is too weak a man to have canied out the 'thing consistently alone‚Äîwitness his uncalled-for avowal of it when the avowal is useless. Besides whicli be spoke of rewarding me in his will; but wills get lost or burned, and as his widow I can claim my third share of his personal property.' | ¬´ In addition to your profits already, said my stepfather. ' Yet you will give her what she asks, Mark V' ' I trouble no one, except for my right. I have friends in Australia, and shall go to them,' said Martha. My stepfather looked at Mark appealingly. ' She is ignorant, and .does not know that you may punish her. When I am dead the story she'knows can hurt no one but herself. Nevertheless, why make it public ! For the sake of the name, Mark Femham, you ' will suffer the grave to close over it.' A year and a half had passed since Geoffry Fernham's death; and stopping short suddenly in one of the streets of Paris my husband said, in answer to a speech of mine: 'Tired, are you? I have been listening for that. I am only waiting for you to say, " Let'us go home ! to Raventree." You will find it all changed; there is nothing to dread.' ‚Ä¢ And a short time after that we stood by the railings round the Red Pool,: looking back at the Black and White House in the Dell. But Mark was right. His ideas of improvement had been carried out, and all was changed. The rooms in that dark gallery were thrown open and furnished, the pavlbr where the portrait hung no kmget -was scarcely recognisable, and the-6ch6SS'of the ghost's walk had ceased for eVer.j ;
