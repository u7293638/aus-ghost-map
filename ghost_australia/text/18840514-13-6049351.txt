and followed the same path-a gap in the forest of Schutt, on the crest of the Linclenbcrg, produced partly by the ravages of the we woodcutter s and partly by a violent wind, which had blown down many of the trees According to an Italian authority on this question, forests, besides abstracting electricity from the sea of vapour that flows over the, check the i rapid congestion of that vapour, and

by the inrush of a stream of cold or cool as to take the place of a stratum which has been heated and rarefied by the rays of the sun In mountainous districts, where the forests have been floated, there is nothing to obstruct the down flow of cold air to the heated plains, and the velocity with which it hastens to fill the vacuum occasioned by the benefaction just spoken of is so great as to sweep away every object the tornado meets with in its course The disafioiesting of the United States is proceeding with suchalainung rapidity at the present moment, that L)r V L OSVVAID, in the last

highlands have been stripped of their timber, the streams will shrink to a mere thread in the day season, and will overflow all bounds in the wet one, carrying men and desolation in their task And one of the worst features of this state of of things is that it is washing away the cultivable surface of large areas of the globe rust of all, the humus of the mountains, no longer held together and protected from the rain by the roots and foliage of the trees, is swept down into the streams and rivers, silting up then beds Then such periodical inundations as those which now take place in Lord

damage of ¿9,700,000 sterling in the years 1882 and 1883 According to that gentleman's estimate, as many trees have been felled in the United States during the lapse of two centimes as were cut down
