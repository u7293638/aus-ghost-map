The Council have put tho number at one-fourth. It ?wssfondly hoped that the ghost of every diffloulty on thin part of tho bu^ines* had boon laid at podii') for ever. But new life wan put into it agti.-i ' lnat night, and from what transpired it may bo inferred that neither party to tho dis cussion exactly understood the chief reason for naming tho smaller numbor.

They are not prepared oponly to petition that a ballot be takru, but they are fully prepared to Toto by ballot if an election U held. If one-tenth of tho ritep-yers in a district can be found with moral courage enough to domund a poll, they may bo taken to represent a corresponding number of tho total residontn. If so, that is ft fairly large number of people, enough at any rate to warrant a test voto being taken. It ia to bo hoped that tho Council will allow this ono-tonth provision to ttuud.
