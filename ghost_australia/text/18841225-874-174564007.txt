LARRIKIN WOODMEN. (DEDICATED TO THE HAWTHORN BOROUGH COUNCIL.) No fears ! we spares no tree, Nor yet a blooming bough ; # We've marked 'em, don't you see, They comes down anyhow. Wot! beauty in a tree ? Come, look yer, drop yer chaff; You're getting on to Ave — Excuse us if we larf. Wot rot to talk like that About an old red gum ; Why, you must be a flat— Oh, crikey ! what a "hum !" Wot! sermons in a stone, And books in running brooks ? You ain't safe to be alone, Your chump's gone off its hooks. We knows what things is nice, And what ain't pooty too ; We don't wont no advice From such a chap as you." And we says plump and plain As trees is ugly, mate, And all your 'owls is vain To save 'em from their fate. LIFE'S SEEMY SIDE.—A ghost. ROTTEN Row.—The St. Kilda road. THE RABBIT ACT.—Chawing up the farmer's produce.
