"F MURDERED LOVE. "Our love is cold and dead," said he, "Dead forevei and ever," said she, "We will bury it deep in its grave," said he, "Aye, and the deeper the better," said she. Low Love lay on his lonely bier, And over him neither dropped a tear, The eyes that had once been bright were dim ; The mouth made for kisses was set and grim. What had been joy was changed to pain. "Would he were bu.ied !" they said again. Jealousy stabbed, and Slander stung, And a savage Pride his lance had flung. "Ah !" it was you who killed him," said he. "Nay, it waa you, and none else," said she. But the beautiful spirit of Love had fled, And they went together to bury their dead. Into the grave the woman threw > A packet of letters tied with blue. Arithi ring with a single diamond set, And never a tear her fair cheek wet. A picture he to meet them thrust, And a few dead violets dropped to dust. "So it is over. Thank God !" said she "Leave the dead past with its dead," said he. And each one turned to a different path, And parted forever in hate and wrath ; But over her shoulder a glance she cast, And marked a spectre that followed fast. And when behind him a look he turned, He saw a phantom whose black eyes burned ; And both of them knew, as they went their way, That never a priest Love's ghost can lay. And evermore that parted pair Of a haunting shadow were aware ; It followed her to the gayest ball ; It stood by his side in the dining-hall. At the flush of noon and the dead of night, A whisper paled each cheek with fright. "I am murdered and buried ; my life is o'er, But my ghost will haunt you for evermore !"
