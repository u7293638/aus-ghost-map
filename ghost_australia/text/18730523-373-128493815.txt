VALUABLE RESIPHASE, BY JOSH BILLINGS. How to pik out a wife. â€” Find a girl that iz 19 years old last May, about the right bight, with a blue eye, and dark-brown hair and white teeth. Let the girl be good to look at, not too proud of musick, a firm disbeliever in ghosts, and one of six children in the same family. Look well tew the karakter ov her father ; see that he is not the member of enny fclub, don't bet on elekshuns, and gits shaved at least 3 times a week. Find out all about her mother, see if she haz got a heap ov good sense, studdy well her likes and dislikes, eat sum ov her bum-made bread and apple dump lins, notisa wether she abuzes all ov her nabors, ask her servants how long they hav lived thare, and don't fail tew observe wether her dresses are last year's ones fixt over. If you are satisfied that the mother would make the right kind ov mother-in-law, yu can safely konklude that the dauter would make the right kind of a wife. After theze prelimi nary s are all settled, and you have done a reazonable amount ov sparking, ask the yung lady for her heart and hand, and if she refuses, yu knan konsider yourself euchered. If on the contrary, she should say yes, get married at once, without any fuss and eathers, and proceed to take the chances. I say take the chances, for thare ain't no recipee for a perfekt wife, enny more than thare iz for a perfekt husband. Thare iz just az menny good wifes az thare iz good husbands, and I never knew two people, married or single, who were determined tew make 'emselves agreeable to each other, but what they suckceeded. Name yure oldest boy sum good stout name, not after sum here, but should the first boy be a girl, I ask it az a favor to me that yu kaul her Rebekker. I do want sum ov them good, old-fashioned, tuff girl names revived and extended.
