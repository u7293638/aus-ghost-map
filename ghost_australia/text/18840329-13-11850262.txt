THE WINTER EXHIBITION AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY. (FROM A LONDON COMttSrOMPENT.) LONDON. FEB. 8. Looking back over the fifteen years' life of the institution of winter exhibitions I cannot recall more than two from which more pleasure than that afforded by the present were able and fined display was to be derived. From this we inter's exhibition many of the greatest names among the painters of the schools that are represented are missing, and some of the Italian schools are quite unre- presented. Nevertheless, the show is a splendid one, and there are certain pictures which it is a lifelong privilege to have seen. Again, this year) recurring spectacle makes us in order of the extraordinary wealth in art treasures that exists in England, it seems to be inexhaustible, each fresh demand is met with prompt and lavish generosity) the present collection includes several fine works by the old Italian masters, a' numerous selection from early Italian r^HriiiiiiMice, a splendid contingent of Dutch and Flemish pictures, and samples of great variety and deep interest by our best English painters The twenty-five Reynolds's varnish almost valuable supplement to the noble' exhibition at the Grosvenor Gallery, and Gainsborough and Romney are seen at their best There are no Itaeburns, and a few very poor portraits have been admitted Among these is one by Jervns of Dorothy Walpole, sister of Sir Robert Walpole, who married, in 1713, Charles, second Viscount Townsend, and who was supposed to have sustained such ill treatment at his hands that Raynham hall is still haunted by her vengeful ghost 'The picture is a vile one, an example of the wretched condition of the art of portrait painting in England at the beginning of the last century, but the face is interesting, and the legend (there is no more authentic ghost in England than that which flies about the great staircase in the liam). renders it an object of curiosity A room has again been devoted to the works of a recently deceased English artist This time we find a collection of the paintings of Mr Poole, R.A , whose fame was at its height 23 years ago Some magnificent Spanish pictures (the price- less and.) cks'Sri'the possession of Lady Ashburton and a superb decorative work by Rubens, representing the apotheosis of a Prince of Orange (and occupying a whole end of one large- room, where it is effectively con ' fronted' by the grand gravity and majestic -impliclty'dF Murillo, Moroni, und Velasquez), lend to this collection an indescribable charm I have already remarked, in attempting to describe to your readers the exhibition at the Grosvenor Gallery, upon the fortunate coincidence that several portraits which are much missed at the latter place are to be found in the former, but I find I am mistaken in including the famous portrait of Mrs Graham among that number I had confounded another portrait with Mrs Grahams, which I had seen some years ago 'The Marquis of Lansdowne lends one of his chief treasures, and a particularly famous work of Sir Joshua's, " Hope Nursing Love ' This picture was one of the four contributed by Sir Joshua to the first exhibition of the Royal Academy, in 1709 There are several repeti- tions of it, one of which we saw in 1877 It is a beautiful composition, graceful, luminous, and delicate The face and figure of Hope, as she holds in softly curved arms the infant Love to her bared bosom, are full of beauty and meaning But the picture has a sad story. It is the portrait of Miss Morris, daughter of Mr Valentine Morris, an Irish gentleman who was Governor of one of the West India Islands She was left in poverty by the death of her father, and tried the stage for a living , but she broke down on her first appearance as Juliet at Covent-garden in 1708, never made another, and died of rapid decline in a few months But for Sir Joshua canvas her name had been "writ in water ' Here, also, is the "Ino and Bacchus," always regarded as a chef d write, but to me uninteresting, in common with most mytho- logical subjects The portrait of Sir Samp- son Gideon, afterwards Lord Eardley, an ancestor of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, is a happy instance of Sir Joshua's art This work is worthy to hang beside the portrait of Lady Gideon, by Gainsborough , I could not award it higher praise Every one wants to see the portrait of Lady Sarah Bunbury, chiefly because it is not at the Grosvenor, and also because Mr Lewis "Wingfield novel has put " the Georges" a I'm dit du join She was a lovely creature, this gloriously beautiful" Lady Sarah Lennox dukes daughter, beloved of the Heir Apparent, within an ace of becoming a queen, bridesmaid to her royal ugly rival ("stuffy old Charlotte afterwards, but a thin pedantic right then), married, divorced, married again, and the mother of the heroic Napiers The brilliancy of the eyes, and the area sweetness of the expression, render this portrait strangely attractive In the first room are two pictures at which everyone stops, these are Gainsborough s portrait of George Canning as a young man, painted Shortly after he left Eton, and Reynolds s Charles James Fox also quite young The last, which belongs to Lord Lansdowne, and is one of the most beautiful of the artist a works, takes one by surprise 'His face is lustrously handsome, the rich dark eyes, with their curved lids and wonderful jewel like sparkle, are alive and sparkling but it is not in the least like this we are apt to think of George Canning It has been well said of this picture It rather suggests the editor of the Anti Jacobin than the statesmen " Charles James Fox is to be recognised at a glance, but I think the young face is more distinctly Jewish than the older portraits I must refer to one other work by Sir Joshua before I leave the Hcvnoldsis. it is a second portrait of Aihuiril Kennel (I have already mentioned that in the (Grosvenor. and it is not only as finely characteristic as the first, but it has a story attached to it, for it was painted for Leo, commonly called Honest Jack Lee" (whose own portraits)' Sir Joshua is also in this collection), who defended Keppel in the famous trial by court martial, which gave rise to Voltaire s celebrated saying apropos of the execution of Byng, that the English had hanged one of their admirals pour encourager des duties Honest Jack Leo returned the fee of Â£1,000 winch Keppel sent him, and wrote to the latter (I quote the catalogue) ill you make me a present of your picture, painted by Sir Ducie, who takes excellent like nests, that I may keep it, and my family after me' ' But happy!, as Tom Taylor says in his Life of Reynolds, " did better, he sat to Reynolds, who was one of his earliest and most intimate friends ' It does not seem to have occurred to either the admiral or the biographer of the artist that Honest Jack wanted to give Mr Dacre a lift in getting him a commission from a personage of the chair Among the portraits of interest there is ZolTiui) s Macklin, of whose first appearance as Shylock., in 1711, when he was over W years of age, Pope shading his is the Jew that Shakspeare drew This curious picture, which enables us to estimate the dit prepare between the "stage management of that time and this, includes a portrait of the Earl of Mansfield (whose house and library were destroyed by the Gordon rioters), 11111 is supposed to represent Mud Bay in his last up pearance as Sh) lock, when he was 100 ) e ire of age I cannot hope to give your readers in my) first letter more than a general idea of the collection, and I am disposed at present to linger among the English pictures We have here three noble examples of James AN and, the I-A , who lived until within the recollection of most of us, muffs held by some critics of credit to have run Paul Potter close The first of these 13 a group of D Alsatian dogs presumably) a family part), papa, mama, and puppies wonderfully) painted 1 open, expression, texture and colouring of hair, red anxious eyes, all perfect, but the foreground is unfinished, and the canvas is too small for the subject. The second is a cow lying down and chewing the cud in a stall, an image of beatitude not to be sure passed even by Cups cows It is indeed more characteristic than any Cave which I know, for his cows owe much to the sunshine and the rich pasture This boy are optimist owes nothing to them She draws all her content from her own two stomachs The third work is "The Fall of Phaeton," painted on panel, and signed with the artist's quaint monogram-a truly grand conception, and a fine but painful picture The point of view is midair at a vast depth beneath, bordered with awful precipices lies the blue sea, sheer out of the blue sky), pursued by the fiery sword of the sun god, falls the pre- sumptuous rival of Phoebus, with the " swift revoking" car, and the steeds once watered at those springs 111 chanced flowers that he but now hurled to destruction The composition and drawing of this plunging, Btrugghng, terrified team, the variety of the attitudes, but all being those of an appalling tumble, the media) of outlasting buds, sl)ing manes, expanded nostrils, and smoking jaws, from which we fancy we can hear the hurt cry of a replied horse issue, are won decently (me A close inspection of the group of horses show sue the artist's master) ox or animal expression In all the four steeds of the sun the look is that of terror and agony) at their height, but 111 each that look is as distinct as an) artist could make it 111 human physiognomy) In the neighbourhood of these pictures are some AVilsons, Moilands (the "piggish painter who painted pigs " as a rix an artist described him), two Wilkie's, a Creswick, a Hogarth, and a second offer) This is the famous picture of Garrick as Sir John Bruce, m Vanbtuglis comedy "The Provoked Wife." The short capering figure in fantastic female dress, with the powerful face and piercing black e es showing under the be ribboned hat, make up a curious representation of the famous "Day) " One turns naturally in thought to Dr Johnson, remembers how Cumberland, the actor, found him weeping by the side of "Davy's" grave under the shadow of Shakspeare's monument, and wishes that his portrait was here Turner's " 1 fishing boats Entering Calais Harbour ' adorns the first room A superb Callcott fills the visitor with delight, but also with regret, for here we are transported to the sunlit Thames, under a radiant summer sky, the river and the city are all clear, and clean, and beautiful, for there were no steamers when Callcott took the portrait of Thames There are two Hogarth's, realistic and strong, but ungraceful and murder eating I come now to the Gainsboroughs, and would-be glad indeed if I could hope to convey to your renders any idea of the beauty of the w bri s of that most exquisite and " seeing ' of painters whom I learned to appreciate many years ago, from my late friend Walter Thornbury's delightful Lift of Gainsborough There is a chapter in that book" Gainsborough in Green Lanes S that one ought to read if there were only the en grey ings of the painter saw 01 less to be interpreted by its aid Here we have only his famous "Terr) boat,' and a beautiful wood land scene, as illustrations of his power 111 landscape, but the collection is rich in his incomparable portraits I have already alluded to those of Canning, as a young man, and Lady Gideon , I now come to two of the gems of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild's gal lory the portrait of George Prince of Wales, and that of Mrs Douglas The former we have already seen, it was sent several years ago to the National Portrait Gallery, and is a noble work The young Prince, bright, handsome, and gallant, stands in a landscape, testing in an easy attitude against his charger, he is in a scarlet uniform, and holds his cocked hat in his left hand We have no such portraits of royal personages now a days The face is not handsome in the portrait of Mrs Douglas, it is hard, and the chin is narrow, but the grace of the figure in a standing point, the right arm leaning on a pedestal a letter held in the left hand, the softness and harmony of the colouring, the truly artful simplicity of the composition render this a great work Among the largest of the pictures in the central gallery are the portraits of the Rev. Sir Henry Page Ducie) and his wife, he former a work of extraordinary merit The original was best known as "Parson Bate," the friend of Garrick and Sheridan, and an early patron of Gainsborough who richly rewarded his patron use by such a portrait as this he took the name of Dudley, was created a baronet, established the Morning Post and the Mot mug Herald and married a sister of Mrs Hurtle) the actress It would be difficult to imagine anything except speech and motion more lifelike than this portrait The dapper, active figure stands, apparently, in a garden path, looking to the left of me and grey is in hand, while a Scotch terrier urges the advisability of getting on with the promised walk The keen pit cannot face tilt shapely limbs, the clerical sober) but perfect taste of the attire, the water of the ribbed silk coat, the breeches and stockings, and the shine of the buckled shoes are ospirfcctiis anything of Gainsborough a within my) knowledge Last on the line, close by tilt door way, eagerly) sought by all is the famous " Nancy Parsons, discreetly described in the catalogue as a noted beauty, whom the second Viscount May need filmed Nothing; can surpass the loveliness and the grace of this hair fair woman, who, with lightly powder red hair, half hidden by the folds of a gobb uner scan, modest but nth attire and exquisite hands, in whose easy pose there is a work of art, looks like an incarnation of virtue and intelligence almost exceeding her beauty This, too, is one of those speaking portraits which fascinate the beholder in the same gallery, and in the distinguished vicinity of tilt Vandyck and Munlloa, is Romance) a beautiful portrait of Mrs Jordan as Peggy, in Till Country Girl, a brilliant creature, with a fair skin, luxuriant reddish hair, bright eye-, large hands, march turn of the head-the whole is little indicative of her low origin shot her unhappy fate She is looking back at the beholder, her hands raised, the fingers pressed together, but the palms separated The attitude is most bewitching, and the sweet, bright, brown eyes seem to draw one towards the canvas I preftrthlB portrait as a work of art to any of Romney) 8 Lady) Hamilton pictures It has more grace and BUster retirement, while tilt painting is equally 'good The Canaltttos, Girdis, and -haystacks, that divide with the English port trusts the most of one side of the great gallery are good samples of those masters.
