Sleep and Death. In ancient years, where yew and cypress made Long avenues of labyrinthine shade, Death, while he sauntered through their cryptic deep, Came sudden upon the spectral shade of Sleep. "How like, tho* differüng,'' mused he, "is our to*1 Thou" art my sister, yet I know thee not; Thou hast thy sorceries, even as I have mine Tell me, sweet ghost, what spells do they en shrine?" Then -Sleep; with sorrowing voice: "My reign, would be All bounty of sacred blessing, save for thee! To-day earth's millions cower thy servile slaves, Wide-wandering one, whose footsteps are men's graves! ;; \--'Tiiy tiOMd, I E'fau-t, lü" infinite release; But, ah, how oft, before its. final peace, The appointed paths thy vassalages tread, Archways of lingering anguish overspread! "Ghastly thy cold halls of oblivion gleam; Ethereal float through mine fair forms of dream. How ruthless frown thy ministries! In mine , Are opiates and mandragoras divine!" j Then Death: "With nightmares, too, thy realm is rife; Signs of our kinship, these, being death-in-life! Thus merge our mysteries, even as sea with sky; Sovereigns alike we reign, yet know not why. "Still, with strange whispers, full of charm and cheer, The -spirit whose name is Hope hath sought mine \- ear. Boast not that thou alone from realms of rest Benignantly thy votaries wakenest. i "Perhaps for my nepenthes fate may bring Some antidote's revitalising sting. Perhaps the draughts lethean that I distil May kill far kindlier than they seem to kill. "Perhaps when all, sweet sister, hath been said, I am clad far more with mercy than with dread. Ah, take me on trust! Wait with me, through .time's lapse, The authentication of that bright Perhans!" -Edgar Fawcett. |
