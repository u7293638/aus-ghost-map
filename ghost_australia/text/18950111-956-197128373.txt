ffiottB of the Jftmtih. rflHE Archbishop of Canterbury had the following ' message' for his -L diocese on New Year's Day : — i Motto. Excita te ipsum. Admone te ipsum. Quicquid de aliis sit non negligas te ipsum. Unwatchf ulness over self is the secret of poor service. That justice may be perfected between man and man, That nobler fruit may grow of our services and sacraments, That our youth may be inspiringly taught in the Gospel, Let our New Year prayer be a worthy voice of ioyful self-sacrificing, in society, in church, among our own and others' little ones. Here is an ancient New Year's Day Prayer, and the English of it : — Qui magnus dies es angelorum parvus in die hominum sub sole conditor solis , Qui initium anni talibus primitiis consecrasti 'Benedic famulis tuis ut totius temporis spatium tibi placitis operibus facias immolari. Thou that art the angels' great daylight, Though Thou be little in the day of man, Thou that under the sun art the sun's creator, Thou that didst hallow the New Year with such first-fruits ; Bless Thy servants, And fill all their appointed time with the sacrifice of works well pleasing unto Thee. . Edw. Cantuab. rpHE new year opens with greater changes in the diocese than -*- the oldest Churchman can remernber to have taken place in any five years before. There has been going on during the last three months such a vacating of parish after parish as has kept the Board of Patronage busy, and the expectation of Churchmen continually on the stretch. Archdeacon Stretch may claim the credit of setting the ball in motion, for to his retirement is due the removal of Archdeacon Langley from Gippsland to Melbourne ; of ?Archdeacon ^Armstrong from Ha\vthorn to Gippsland, with the appointment of the Bev. W. Carey Ward to St. Columb's. Then followed Canon Chase's retirement, carrying as its consequence the removal of Dr. Torrance from Balaclava to St. John's, and of the Eev. C.E. Drought froin Woodend to Balaclava. Then the death of the lamented Dean Macartney brought : up Dr. 'Vance from Kew to the Deanery, to be followed by the removal of Mr. Hindley to Kew from East Melbourne, and of Canon Berry to East Mel bourne from Moonee Ponds. Nor has the circulation of preferment ceased, for Essendon and Woodend hav6 still to be filled up, and rumour has it that Prahran before long will be losing its incumbent. Nowhere is this general shifting of seatB more visible than on the Cathedral Chapter. Canon Goodman? in a fine sermon preached at Christ Church, Geelong, on Sunday last (January 6th), the fortieth anniversary ? of his induction, remarked on this subject: — '.The changes in our Cathedral Chapter; are very remarkable. Its clerical members, exclusive of the Bishop, are eleven in number, viz., the Dean| two Archdeacons, and eight Canons. During the year 1894 four of these, who were senior to myself, have ceased to belong to that body — two being removed by death, and two being incapacitated by age and infirmity. What a comment on the Lord's words — 'The night cometh when no man can work.' ' TT will not be for the honour of the Australian Church, or of the -*- Church of England throughout the world, that the Diocese of Grafton and Armidale should be left unaided to struggle with the difficulties that have come upon it through no fault of the : diocesan authorities, but through the fall in value of certain Sydney properties on which a large part of the Bishopric Endowment Fund had been lent. The income to the Bishop from what remains of the fund will be about ^375 per annum. As, however, the travelling expenses of the Bishop cannot be set down at less than ^200 a year, there remains to him to maintain his family, to say nothing of the dignity of his office, something less than a curate's stipend. Bishop Green assuredly had no thought for his own ease or endowment when he accepted the bishopric. Honoured and esteemed in his own diocese, with a career and income assured to him, he had no selfish motive to induce him to quit Ballarat for New England. But the call to.higher work was one to which his spirit at once responded. Nor has he allowed himself to be discouraged, so long as the situation , was a possible one, by the pecuniary, difficulties of his see, but has thrown himself from the first with all the energy and brightness of his' nature into the work of liis diocese. Still, the most generous- arid unselfish of bishops cannot: fulfil ids; office without enough means, not only to meet indispensable personal needs, but to enable him to take journeys, conduct correspondence, defray the cost of diocesan work . of all kinds, for which no funds are forthcon^ing from any other source. Let him cut down his expenses to the level of apostolic simplicity is the advice of a writer in the^Argus. Well, we incline to . believe that that, if we make the necessary allowance for differences of times and their demands, is just what he has been hitherto doing, if by simplicity is meant the reduction of. personal expenses to a. minimiim, and the throwing into the diocesan fund of almost everything not needed for food and raiment. But to live and move about, and be free to visit and confirm, requires a certain income, and will anyone pretend that the balance, of .£375, after deducting travelling expenses, represents a possible income for a bishop? We hold that Bishop Green has acted wisely in : con- vening his synod in order to lay the case before them. They are his proper advisers in such a strait. But whatever the result of their deliberations, let him never dream of resigning v his office. We know him to be a man of great faith. Let him have some faith, then, in his fellow-Churchmen that they are not going to desert him in his extremity. We have no fear but that for the present year the deficiency in the income of the see will be made up by Australian Churchmen when the situation. is made plain to them, and that for its future income a sufficient . sum may be raised at home if only the Bishop himself will go to England to advocate the cause of his own Church. [Since the above has been in print, word has reached us that J3100 has already been subscribed to make up the deficiency in the endowment.] . - ON New Year's Day, Jhe Annual Dinner of the Church of England Mission to Seamen was given to 400 men, at the Mission House, 456 FlinderS-street. This Mission,' which was founded by the late Dean Macartney, and was in great part maintained by him out of his private means, must be admitted to have strong claims on the Church for encouragement and support now th&t; its generous founder has been removed by , death. The Mission is : carried on in a large three-story building, meant for a warehouse or bonded store, very roomy, and in every way commodious for its present use. The persons proposed to be admitted are seamen on shore and wharf labourers out of employment, but, space and means permitting, ' the, benefits of the Mission are extended to any deserving labourers in distress.. These benefits take the form of one free meal of soup and bread every day in the. week for those who come to claim it, and a second meal on Thursdays and Sundays. The number daily partaking of these meals averages from 130 to 140. A reading-room is provided for the men attending the mission, and the building is used as a night shelter by about 120 persons all the year round, in winter especially, if the weather is cold and inclement, the number sometimes reaching 170. The active conduct of the Mission is in the hands of Mr. E. Woods, the Dean of Melbourne, as incumbent of the parish in which the Mission is situated, having , supervision of the work, with the assistance of a committee consisting of the Revs. W. G-. Hindley, of Kew, A. J. Drewett, of Kensington, and E. S. Sumner, of South Melbourne, with two or three laymen. The Dean, who occupied the chair at the annual dinner, took occasion to speak very highly of the work of Mr. E., Woods, and to. say that he regarded the Mission as a monument of the far seeing philanthropy of his predecessor, and as a. legacy, to the diocese and. to him. A public meeting, we -????; understand, has been called for Thursday, 17th inst., at the Cathedral Buildings, to consider the question of ways arid, means for this useful institution. AN Christmas Day there appeared in one of our leading papers V an article on the Christmas Subjects, in which it was stated that the manuscript of the Syrian Gospels lately discovered by Mrs. Lewis at Sinai supported the view that our Lord was truly Joseph's son, and therefore mere man, and not God. As we understand that this statement has been the cause of much perplexity and pain to some of our readers, we give below an abridgment of an article published in the Contemporary Review in November last, dealing with the recent discovery, which will enable them to estimate at their right value the divergences of the new text from the received version : — 1 ' We have a transcript of the Four Gospels in Syriac, dating from a very early period— say, fifth century— and representing a translation made far back in the. second c&ntury.; 'As far as Syriac Gospels are concerned, a text has been recovered superior in antiquity to anything yet known, and,, one that often agrees with all that is most ancient in Greek MSS. ' One great point is its omissions — it omits story of adulteress in John vii. 53V viii. 11, also the last twelve verses of St. Mark. As to its additions, it is characterised by almost entire absence of such passages as are generally, held to be interpolations ; one interesting variant is the form of Pilate's question to the Jews in Matt, xxvii. 16—' Which will ye that I release unto you ? Jesus. Barabbas, or Jesus which is called?' &c.; — a reading already known from a few MSS. This maybe a true reading. Jesus is a well-known name in Palestine, and adds antithetic force to question of Pilate, 'Which Jesus will you have?' — the anarchist \- or the saint? Another curious reading unknown by the reviewer is where Jesus' command to take away the stone from the grave of Lazarus isfollowed by a question on the part of Martha — ' Why' are they taking away the stone ?' But the most original feature of this* Syriac manuscript is the suggestion, on first page, of birth of Jesus in natural way by Joseph and Mary. . 'The following is an English translation of this MS. , (Matt. i. 15.-25) :— . ' ' 15. Eliud .begat Eleazar; Eleazar begat Matthan; Matthan begat Jacob; ...'.' 16\. Jacob begat Joseph; Joseph (to whom was espoused the Virgin Mary) begat Jesus, who is called Christ. 17.. All these generations, from Abraham to David, are fourteen generations ; and from David to the Babylonian exile, fourteen genera tions; and from the Babylonian exile to the Christ, fourteen genera tions. -? ? r' 18/ Now, the birth of the Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, when they had not come together, she was found with child from the Holy Ghost. 19\. But Joseph her husband, because he was jusfc, was unwilling to expose Mary, and he was minded that he would quietly divorce her. . 20. But while he was meditating on these things, there appeared unto him an Angel of the Lord in a vision, and said to him: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary thy wife, for that which [is — will be] born of her is from the Holy Spirit. 21\. Slie shall bear tliee a son, and [thou shalt— she shall] call his name Jesus ; for he shall save his people from their sins. 22\. Now, this which happened (was) that there might be fulfilled that which was spoken by the Lord in Isaiah the Prophet, who had said: 23\. Behold, the Virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, by interpretation, our God with us. 24\. But when Joseph rose from his sleep, he did as the angel com manded him, and took his wife, and she . 25\. Bare him a son, and he called his name Jesus. ' We pass over a technical dissertation of many pages long* the drift of which is to show what the place of this Syriac MS., with its strikingly; variant reading on Matt. i. 15-25, is in the genealogy of copies and versions, in the course of which the reviewer, arguing the question in a most dispassionate manner, presents evidence to lead to the conclusion that it belongs to a small minority of non-catholic or unorthodox branches of manuscripts, which have been altered in the interest of the Cerinthian or Adoptionist heresy, and is probably the original (or nearly all of it) of which the Curetonian text, the Harmony of Tatian, the Grasco-Latin, and old Latin texts, and those of the Ferrar group, are reformed texts, or secondary orthodox readings. ' ' The following diagram represents this relationship : — Primitive Text. ————————— — — — I1 w ? Unorthodox reading: ' p ? ? ; ? ?g ? ?5' _g Secondary Orthodox Sinai Syriac. § reading. - .a i ? 1 w- Harmony of ? Curetonian Syrian ;g Tatian. o ?g Grssco-Latin and The Ferrar Group. O old Latin texts. 'N.B. — The diagram is only meant to assist the imagination,; and doesn't carry a strict genealogical meaning, for we don't know whether the unorthodox and secondary orthodox readings originated in Syriac or elsewhere. 'In regard to the great question as to the relation of these newly-discovered Sinai-Syriac readings of Matt. i. 15-25, &c;, to the archetype of Matthew,1 and as to whether they are valid against the Greek MSS., the'reviewer concludes as follows :— 'The first objection to the priority of the new Syriac readings lies in the use of the expression ' the Virgin Mary' in Matt. i. 16. It is a late expression, relatively, to the New Testament. Even in the Apology of Aristides, which is one of our earliest witnesses to the Virgin birth, she is simply ' a Hebrew virgin,' so that if we were to receive the words 'Virgin Mary,' or 'Mary the Virgin,' as a popular and understood title into the earliest form of the Gospel, we should be guilty of an anachronism. 'The next objection, a far more serious pnej lies, as our readers have probably observed, in the inconsistency of the Sinai narrative as a whole. v While the received story is miraculous and consistent, the new account is miraculous and inconsistent. It represents our Lord as the direct offspring of Joseph and Mary, but introduces a miraculous descent of an angel to explain what was, on its own hypothesis, a natural phenomenon. It omits the passage in which we are told of Joseph [ovk iylyvwa-Kef airijv fas] ZreKev, presumably implying the reverse of this statement, and yet it ? announces the birth as supernatural. Nor can these inconsis tencies be removed except by withdrawing the whole section concerning the angelic vision, If the angel remains, the theory of the normal generation must go,, or the visit! of the angel' must be reduced to the annunciation of a non-miraculous event.' HT1HE Bishop of Salisbury, whose brief visit we have so much ; , -*? enjoyed, is a son of Dr. Christopher Wordsworth, late Bishop of Lincoln, nephew of Dr. Charles Wordsworth, late Bishop of St. Andrew's, and grand:nephew of the Poet Laureate, William Wordsworth. He is himself a theologian of high reputation, especially distinguished as a liturgiologist. The sermon preached by him in St. Paul's Cathedral, on the Glory of Womanhood, was a little disappointing to listen to, the Bishop's voice suffering in the effort to make himself heard at the far end of the building — but when read in the Argus, it' was found to be a most able and interesting discourse. The address on the Monday was well heard, and made a great impression on all present. . '.;,. . npHE books recommended by the Bishop of Salisbury, in his J- ? address to the clergy in St. Paul's Cathedral, on Monday, 31st tilt., are Puller's Primitive Saints and the See of Rome; Denny's Anglican Orders and Jurisdiction (S.P.C.K.), translated also into Latin by Lacey, under the title of Hieranrchia Anglicana; Illingworth's Personality, Human and Divine; Bampton Lectures; also Dean Church's Discipline of the Christian Character. The Bishop of Salisbury, in the course of his address, took occasion to deprecate the: hasty rushing into print, to oppose the Roman pretensions, by men not well versed in history or acquainted with controversial methods, by which they simply play into the hands of trained and astute controver sialists, who have made these questions their study, and who do not scruple to misrepresent history or misquote the Fathers. Every diocese should have its learned and able divines, and in their hands the controversy should be left. There were some who held controversy to be alien to the spirit of the Gospel, but for himself, looking at the example of St. Paul and St. Augustine, and considering what questions their controversies settled, he felt that there was an abiding place for controversy in religion. A FESTIVAL Hymn, of excellent Church tone and devotional -£*- character, written by the Lord Bishop of Ballarat, and set to music by the Rev. Dr. Torrance, has just been published, and is now available for general use. The hymn is dedicated ' To the Most Holy Trinity,' being specially suitable for that Church festival, and. suitable also, as the title sets forth,, for choral festivals, processions, and organ dedications— for which latter occasion, indeed, the hymn was originally composed. The music is simple, tuneful, and of well-marked rhythm, and quite within the compass of ordinary parish choirs. There are so few hymns of the kind available — and all so much hackneyed — for special occasions, such as those indicated, that a new hymn will be a welcome addition to choir collections, and we have little doubt that the Bishop's Hymn will speedily obtain a wide circulation. It is neatly printed on a double sheet, resembling the well-known 'Story of the Cross,' by Mason, Firth and M'Cutcheon, of Melbourne, and the-price (viz., Is. per dozen, 5s. per hundred, single copy 2d.) should bring it within the means of all. Copies may be obtained from the Diocesan Registries of Melbourne and Ballarat, or direct from Dr. Torrance, of St. John's Parsonage, Garlton. THE subjoined is the course of lectures announced to be delivered in the Nixon Chapel, St. David's Cathedral, Hobart, during the present month :— Tuesday, January 29th, 10.30 a.m.— 'The Miraculous in the Scripture Revelation,' by the Rev. Canon Potter, M.A.; 12 noon— 'The Priest in his Study,' by the Ven. Archdeacon French, M.A., of Adelaide. Wednesday, January 30th, 10.30 a.m. — ' The Limits of Inspira tion,' Canon Potter; 12 noon— 'The Priest in his Parish,' Archdeacon Frenoh. Thursday, January 31st, 10.30 a.m. — - 'On Prophecy,' by Canon Potter ; 12 noon- — 'The Inner Life of the Priest,' by Archdeacon French. IN connection with the Aborigines Mission of Victoria, we are requested to state that in consequence of Mr. C. J. Fox, the late treasurer, having removed to Sydney, Mr. W. E. Morris, of the Diocesan Registry, has consented to act as treasurer, Mr. A. F. French continuing to act as secretary. The mission greatly needs support during the present year, in order that the work now being carried on may not be restricted. THE Bishop of the Diocese proposes to hold confirmations, where there are candidatesj in the districts of Kilmore, , Broadford, Tallarook, Yea, Alexandra, Mansfield, Doon, Jamie son, Gaffney's Creek, and Wood's Point, between April 20th and May 4th, 1895. Communications on the subject should be addressed to Archdeacon Herring,. Kilmore. THE clerical meetings held for so many years at the deanery \ on the third Tuesday in each month are not' to be abandoned. The Dean proposes to hold the first meeting this year on Tuesday, February 19th, the hour, place, and subjects to be notified in the next issue of this paper.
