Samuel Marsden took charge of the district, and in 1791) opened a church built out of the male as of two old huts In 1797 the foundation of old St John's was laid by Governor Hunter-our first substantial building In 1869 the building was opened by the chaplain Mr Marsden, who took as his text the words "But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee, how much less this house which I have built " The event was considered one of great importance and much interest was taken in it '' It was the sowing of seed which would be soon after many days an influential deed to be held in everlasting remembrance Mr Marsden done ered (says the (Ja sHe) an excellent sermon in the course of which he made some animated allusions to the structure of Solomon's temple and afterwards gradually traced the progress of religion in succeeding ages adverting to the many solid advantages that must be necessarily derived to this colony from a proper observance of the duties of Christianity and religious worship. The concourse of persons that attended from all parts of the colony and the becoming silence that prevailed added much to the solemnity of the service " But few of the stones remain of the old building None of the worshippers present at the opening who saw this house in her first glory are with us on earth The ancient, holy and sequestered pile, the spiritual home of past generations lies low in the dust But though the beauty and grandeur of the latter house is greater than that of the former, who does not thank. God, as he thinks of the past work of this mother Church-mother of so many of the Churches of this great southern land In the sad and dark days of this fair Australia, in the days of barbarous and cruel punishments, when the heart of man was turned into the heart of a beast, in the days of gross licentiousness and immorality, and when the sacred rites of marriage were often ignored, no uncertain sounds went forth from St John's Her chaplain was a champion and a witness for the truth of God He was as Wilberforce declared, one who deserved the title of a moral hero, boldly rebuking vice and patiently suffering for the truth s sake the John the Baptist re- taking the goods He nobly upheld the claims of religion and battled for the honour of God The Church, a? represented by Mr Marsden was-first the guardian of the truth in its widest sense, secondly, the friend of the weak and oppressed thirdly, a propagandist of the faith once delivered to the saints, putting forth zealous efforts on behalf of foreign missions, and had a distinct influence on social and public life. It was Marsden who first taught the Moonee to lay down their clubs and spears and to sing the Lord's song in a strange land Praise to the rather, Son, and Holy Ghost Gems from New Zealand will doubt less shine resplendent in the Redeemer's crown The goodness and the glory of the Lord have been soon in New Zealand, and great spiritual triumphs and victories have been won by the Church It was from old St John's that Marsden went forth, full of courage and dev onion with the new Ev angel Seven v visits he paid to the island and might well exclaim, "What hath God wrought"' That was the first link of a great golden chain, which now links together so many of the islands of the sea The incumbent 1 as placed a photograph of the old church in the v vestry, and likenesses of the former m gunboats, in memory of the day Fpps s Cocoa -Gratpfci An Comfouti in - ' By- a thorough knowledge! of the natural laws which govern the operations of digestion and nutrition and by a careful application of the fine properties of well selected cocoa Mr 3-ppsnas provided our breakfast tablet with a delicately flavoured helen go which rains have as many heavy doctors'' bills It is by the judicious use of such articles of diet that a constitution may be gradually built up until strong enough to resist every tendency to disease Hundreds of subtle maladies are floating round us ready to attack wherever there was a weak point We may escape many a fatal shaft by keeping" ourselves well fortified with pure blood and a properly nourished frame "-Civil Service Gazette Made simply with boiling water or milk Sold only in Jib packets by grocers labelled thus-James Epps and Co, Homoeopathic Chemists, Loados.-[AuvrJ .
