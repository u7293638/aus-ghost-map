THE TASMANIAN ANNIVERSARY REGATTA. The 26:li anilivt r tn r y Regalta of yesterday, fell upon one of the finest d a/s that could by any po.^aib iiity Imvo been chosen for bucIi an event. Indeed the hetvens seemed to welcome the duy with ns nui'.ii delight and sali-- focuon, ns the thomnuib of citizens tint did honor to it. A mild sun shone out at intervals, tempered !>y a hcnuiifully cool breeze, the result of which was that the wnter wns just rough enough for ihef>ullers to try their powers, and tb i wind sufficiently^ strong to test the sailing qualifies of ihe vnrioU9 bouts for the sailing race. And we ehou'd not bo ftir out if we said that Iio b irt T om n, not only to a man but to a child, wns on the Regatta ground. The flig9iaffi and ships in harbor were gaily decorated with their bunting fluttering in lhe breeze, a n ! everything oj ened &r; indie l it closed—a oio»t successful Regatta day. In consequence of the decision of the Regntta Committee to have a Flotilla for the purpose of conveying the Governor lo the Regntla ground at 9 o’clock, crowds of citizens with their families were to be seen wending tlx-ir way in the direction of the boat wharf long before the hour named, and thousands also congregated on the Regatta ground, awaiting the flotilla heaving iu sight. Tub F l o t il l a .. Precisely a t half-past 9 His Excellency the Governor arrived at the boat harbor, in his carriage, and at onoe proceeded on board the t( Adm iral,” manned by eight lianas, His Excellency was attended by C apt Steward, Aide Camp, l h e Ron the Colonial Treasurer, the Hon J , M. W ilson, John Forster Esq, Inspector of Police, &c.; A detachment of the City Police, under the command of Sub Inspector Hadley was in attendance. The band of the City Guards, played the national anthem and, His Excellency was warmly cheered. The flotilla having been formed a gun was fired, and it started in the following order. The M arine Board. His Excellency the Governors Barge. The Mayor aod Allcrm en, the Members of the Regatta Committee, aud the Hon Secretary M r J.W .Q ill. The Band of the City Guards. Upwards of thirty pulling boats, when olear of the harbour, joined in the flotilla T he tpeotw le wjp yery striking, and olled forth the expressions o f admiration rom all quarters.

As it hove iu sight f the Grand Stand th e sight was most imosing, and can never be forgo ten by those ho witnessed it, and the Governor’) landing as welcomed by a salute from the Judges tand. AFFBABANCE O F THE GROUND. To stay one stationed bn the F lag Ship or pon tile decks of jlhe Monarch or Kangaroo,the ill above the judges stand presented an Apearance which can never be forgotten. I t ppeared to conaiat o f one living moving mass of human beingB, and it cannot be wondered at when we state that there could cot have been leBS. than seven thousand persons on the ground. Tiie Booths also presented a very pretty appearance.with their flags displayed a t full length from Poles extending far above their tops. While a more than ordinary number of refreshment Booths, private booths, and staude, were upon tke ground, in fact on no previous year do we recollect eucit an assemblage of citizens or collection of every conceivable booth and Btand as on (his, and the countenances of the visitors evinced their delight a t the am usement they were about to witness. There were seven publican’s booths, irrespective of the Committee Booth, which was as usuabunder the directorship of Mr George Brown. I t would be impossible for us to attem pt to describe any of the other varied booths. The grand stand as usual, presented its lively ap ­ pearance of ladies and gentlemen, and close to it the committee had stationed an excellent hand for the amusement of the citizens. There was a visible improvement on previous years in the general arrangements of the Rr°“ <>d ‘*"d we *>"» Te7 llltle doubt Ike Boothholders will state there was an undoubted improvement in their receipts. Nor can this be wondered a t considering the large number of Country residents in Town from ° " e ?£ whl1ch 18 ‘he holding of *>'e Criminal Sittings this morning.— His Excellency the Governor arrived on the around a t about ten o’clock or very ^ o r t l , after and was received by a salute of seven guns and accompanied by the committee to the grand s and where with Mis Gore Brown took l,18teat‘ N o tin g m any way appeared to m ar the success of the Regatta «"d ° ne »PPeared delighted a t the excellent days sport provided for them through Executive the exertions and euergies of the „ Committee.

He tioccrciy thanked them. Captain Bateman proposed the health of Mrs Gore Brown, and the Ladies of Tasmania ana suicl they aII ought to bless the day th at His Excellency came among them. Baud—'‘Here’s a health, &c.; His Excellency responded for Mrs Gore Brown. And Mr J . W.

Mr C’ Colvin, the Chairman of the Ex ccutivc Committee, responded. The luncheon being concluded, the work of the day, which, hy the hye, was only sus pended, so far as starting a fresh race wm concerned, for there were already two races in pregnss, viz The third and the sixth, was proceeded with, and all went on ns merry as n marriage bell to the end (except only nn unfortunate, but not serious accident referred to in ano'.hcr column, after the coming in of the barges race, and a dispute in reference to awarding the prize in the fourth race to Lynch). B ut ‘'its an ill wind that blows unholy good,” and the result h that the booth hol lers will profit by it,as the race is to he pulled over again to-day wilh other races made up by the publicans. TH E RACES. We now proceed to give an account of the various races, aud 6hall adopt our usual prAClice of giving a descriptive account of ench of the races as they appear on the pro* gramme, and following the names of the boats and their order of coming in, merely remarking th at a t no previous regatta have we taken more pains to do justice to each p a r ticular race than the ptesent one, for (he best of all reasons, that roue more truly deserved it. The large number of new boats which have been built, and were entered, surprised, as as it did almost every one, and therefore some difficulty was experienced in giving a correct account of their positions.

The little fellows who composed the 12 crews were all dressed so tastefully, that it called forth ihe general admiration of the public; and a t the souod of the gun io g et ready, they all took their positions aud steered*-in all sorts of directions. The Violet was the favorite from th e moment of starling, and shortly after there was a foul between the Bushrauger, and the Ju st W hat I Told You. The result was that the Violet took the lead, kept it throughout, wus never beaded, and came in an easy winner by several boat’s lengths, followed by Telegraph; Railway, 3rJj and Young Deer 4fh, Upou the coxswains ot the winning beats presenting themselves at the Grand Stand lor their rewurdsjhcy were greeted with applause, and the prizes were given to them by Mrs Eugar aud Mrs Meredith, amidst loud cheers. m a y o r 's c u p .

This was looked upon as the m ost exciting race of the day; and when it was known that seven first-class boats were eutcred by firstclass pullers to contest for the magnificent cup the excitement and speculation os to the result did not abate. Tlie favorite has undoubtedly been Mr D . Barclay, while both W . Perry - and Abbott had their backers,and were looked upon as certain to out-pace the favorite a t the finish. The result will disclose, however, that neither the winner of last year nor the favorite of this bad any chance with Mr F . W .Abbott. A t the sound of the gun the boats, which had a 11 been brought into their positions, went away. The first to shew in front was the Violet, closely waited upon by the Vision (M r J . W. Perry). A n unfortunate incident happened to the former boat, which was observed to foul with one of (he competing boats,and the result was (he Vision took the lead followed by the Ariel aud indeed at one time the latter boat looked as if it meant (o win ; but lime and tide which wait for no man appeared to be too much for the puller and the result was he had to succumb, to Mr F . W . Abbott, who had evidently been biding his lime, and who guided his fioe little skiff iu such a manner as to completely astonish ih? outsiders in the race. J . W . Perry,however,felt that the race must be his and, therefore, the trial lay between him aud A bbott. I h e judgm ent of the latter, together with his fine strokes, completely outdid Perry, for after rounding the buoyboat villi wind and tide in bin fnvor, Abbott completely lifted his 6kiff out of the w ater, and although pulling easily,at every stride he went away from the Virion. A t tbi? point of the race, the remaining boats wi-rc entirely out of ir, in fact “ they gave up the ghost,” and preferred a stroll on shore, leaving (he contest to the tv o leading boats, the result wns that Abbott won amidst deafening cheers, a winner hy more than fifty lo ts' lengths. Before starting, protests were entered Against H . Sargeant, and Patterson, : on the grounds that they were not such amateurs as were contemplated in this race. The magnificent silver cup was presented to the winner (who was carried with his boat to the grnnd stand), by Mrs Robert Walker, who congratulated him on v inning 60 handsome n cup.

A t the sound of the gun, she got away in first rate style, followed by the Lady Pnltmrsion nnd Criooline, and in this order they maintained their positions for some short distance, when the Marie Louise1 through an error in judgment, was taken off the wind, while the Lady Palmerston, which was splendidly mannged. was just in position to cAtch the full effect of the breeze, the re suit of which was that she improved her place, and finally came in at least half-a-milc before the Marie Louise ; the Crinoline wus said to have had on accident to her rigging.

The aid so timely rendered was extended until a boat from one of the ships in harbour took him on board. The Vision and Violet continued the race having no consideration for the unfortunate Bayes, aud ‘the Judges refused to award the Prizes to them.

The strength of the breeze gave the Phantom an undoubted advantage on account of her well known qua'itiea on a wind. After many altcrationsin tlie positions of either boat—the Flirt being at one moment apparently winning, and the \Vanderer at another—the final result will disclose that the sailing qualities of the Phantom were much too superior, aud she came in at least half an hour before the second boat. y o u t h ’s RACE.

The first boat which got away was the Childers, and tier crew lifted her as she ap« proached the buoy boat, followed closely by the Uunneyroede, aod the other two almost abreast of her; but an unfortunote accident happened to the latter boat, which fouled the suam er Kangaroo, aud from this her chance was gone. The race now lay between the Sir John Frauklin and the Childers, and we regret to say it wus not a severely contested one, fur the winning to it came in at lent £0 boat’s lengths a-hcad of her more unfortunate rival (tlie Childers).
