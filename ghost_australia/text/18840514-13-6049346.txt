THE REV. CHARLES STltONO'SDOC TRIBES TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-Some years as the Rev. Charles Strong compiled, for the use of the choir and congregation of the Scots Church, a small book entitled I lit. Woi t/ of Anthems Sung at the Scots LI field Last year a re issue of the book was circulated among the congregation, with an appendix of hymns In the original picture it was stated that much care had been taken in the selection of the words and that where words seemed unsuitable they had been altered 1 his selection has, since its first issue, been constantly used in the service of the church From this book of words I have extracted the following p issues which bear more or less directly on certain points of doctrine which have come into prominence during the Scots Church controlers) I give the extracts without note or comment, leaving them to speak for themselves An impartial public will draw its own conclusions as to the doctrines held by the monster who compiled, and the congregation that uses this melee I am, etc..
