ANOTHER FATAL ACCIDENT ?RINOLINE.—On Saturday afternoon inquiry look place at the King's Tavern, Kensington-road, on the bo Miss Elizabeth Jane Meredith, aged eigh[?] years. Mrs. Catharine Wardell, of No.[?] Amelia-terrace, Old Brompton, depo[?] that the deceased was her niece, and resid[?] with her parents in Earl's court, Kensin[?] ton-road. On Wednesday evening la[?] witness accompanied the deceased to friend's in Trevor-place, Knightsbridge, which there was a juvenile party upon[?] birthday anniversary. Between eight and[?] nine o'clock in the evening there was a dance in the drawing-room amongst the young party. The deceased and her partner had finished a country dance, and were standing with their backs to the fire, when an alarm was given that the lower part of Miss Meredith's dress was on fire. A [?] great confusion ensued, and, after [?] ertions, the clothes of the deceased [?] extinguished, but not before they were nearly all consumed. The sufferer was placed in blankets, and a surgeon promptly attended, but she died on Thursday morning. Ver- dict.—" Accidental death, owing to the bad practice of wearing crinoline." THE MAN WHO WON'T PAY THE PRINTER.—May he be shod with lightning, and compelled to wander over gunpowder. —May he have sore eyes, and a chestnut- burr for an eye-stone. May every day of his life be more despotic than the Day of Algiers. May he never be permitted to kiss a pretty woman. May he be bored to death by boarding-school misses practising their first lessons in music, without the privilege of seeing his tormentors. May his boots leak, his gun hang fire, and his fishing-lines break. May his coffee be sweetened with flies, and his teacup seasoned with spiders. May his cattle die of mur- rain, and the pigs destroy his garden. May a troop of printers' devils, lean, lank, and hungry, dog his heels each day, and a re- giment of cats caterwaul under his window each night. May the famine-stricken ghost of an editor's baby haunt his slumbers, and hiss " Murderer!" in his dreaming ear. May his cows give sour milk, and his churn rancid butter. In short, may his business go to ruin, and he go to—Congress. THE IRISH INFANT GIANT.—The " Free- man " of yesterday says:— One of the most extraordinary phenomena of nature in human form that has appeared for a long time, is now exhibited in the rotunda, in the person of a male infant, 14 months old. This child is the son of Hugh and Mary Reid, two respectable people in an humble walk in life, residing within three miles of the town of Monaghan. In a physiological point of view this infant giant must be regarded as little short of a won- der, and when it is considered that at his pre- sent age he weighs five stone, there is [?] fetched conceit in asserting that if he continue to increase in proportion at the same rate, up to his twenty-fifth year, he will be the largest man the world ever saw. In company with number of scientific and medical gentlemen we were favored with a private view of the juvenile Titan. In common with many we expected to see a huge, bloated child, that owed its extreme size to disease, but we were agreeably surprised to see a beautiful boy, [?] times the ordinary size of children of his age seated in a large perambulator before the [?] playing with a number of toys, and attended by his mother, an exceedingly good special of an exceedingly good specimen if an Irish- woman from the country. We were invited to lift the baby, and after ascertaining there was no mistake as to his weight, U ; yoling gentleman ijqsfcud on being^hfnrfrfrjy put back ^li ihe coiy position froidZi^ich. ho f: hacfbeei; removed.
