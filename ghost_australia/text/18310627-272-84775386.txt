To the Editor of the Tasmanian. Sir, Being about to retire from all public dis cussion, I beg to submit the following remarks for your future guidance and reproof. Not many months past, you very strongly re probated the very system you are at this present pursuing. I refer to your blazoning the name of the proprietor of this journal in your paper. Oh I how must your tender feelings have smarted under the lashing you have drawn down on you "un lucky" head. How many writhings, and how much acute agony it must have cost you, before; you broke through this old established rule {as you formerly called it) of on no occasion using personally the names of newspaper conductors? What burst of insanity propelled pou7 i/#l, who» ^toi^w so yie \ I th e pieasuretJ-of -perse-Miu*ion ,-or prosecution ? AVlwit c'einon .suggested tpyonlo call iiridyour aid the4* libel law*'?

J^wJtiJtjoo i deeply that the Jine.jifjargiinient pursued by this | Journal, :'-ilh reference to Hie glorious 'Meeting, I was- verwlielming atid TiniuT^verrableT TheTniid and amiable Editor «f the Courier 4tasiilways wished to spare you,~1earing that if he encoun tered you openly, that he would overwhelm your journal with ruin; and this journal has, up to 1 th^^arrival of the resolutions of the meeting, I partly pursued the same coui&e;: but the two last j 'Yasmamaa* have clearly shewn, that your dog matical -. pi etensions are on the wane, and that the exposition which this paper has given of your principles, (your public principles and writings, I refer to solely) has thrown you from the false pinnacle on which you appeared to the public view. A few, words more, and fleave you to the enjoyment of that solitude to which the public voice will very soon consign you. Your bantling, the famous list ofjjrievances^loaded and blurred as it i^ with errors i and mr^slatements7 even by your own confession is about give up the ghost. But would this, confession have been elicited ex cept the Launctslon Advertiser bad shewn their fallacy? No! never. Its doctrine was dissected by this journal, its beauties held up to admiration, and its blemishes no less exposed to public view, and that by the master spirit under whose power- ful arguments the Tasmaman so pusillanimously succumbs, an d invokes the ' Law of Libel1' to help him in his bitter extremity. I will close this subject by propounding to you the following que- ries. What would have .become of the Editor of iha-T- airrwtiiiin ? What would have been ihe fate of tbe violent oDPdBitibn papers of this colony? What would have be'allen the violent opposition faction of Hobart Town, either as a body, or in dividually, provided the Governor of this Colo- ny had hunted as diligently and as passionately foi libels, promulgated^ against himself and Gov ernment, as you and your faction have done in my case ? To the unprejudiced portion of the commu nity I leave these remarks, convinced that they will be able duly to appreciate bet ween the benig* nity and mercy rominualJy «-x tended totheoppo* sition Press of this Colony by Colonel Arthur, and the bitter malignancy of the puffVdupbut worse-^m-!i«eless-wquld- be«f bought* patriots of Hobart Town. Farewell. Farewell. Methiuks I bear your fu- neral knell. Your's J.F. Mr. Editor.— In your last number I read a pa ragraph, anticipating the probability of His Ex cellency, the LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR's resi ding among us for some months together in the course of each year ; and God sent that such an ticipatioris may be realized. It is My opinion there is nothing in the Governor's power, so likely to render general good ^o the county of Cornwall and ultimately to^the Colony, as his residing among m for some months together. The advan* tages of good roads and Macadamised streets are very considerable ; but they are only of secon dary consideration, in comparison to- the good tendency the presence . of the Chief Authority in X hteiUjiwn would Jia?e -J«i the Iwiiole system of so ciety I am , sure that *ven the Opposition who know him will unite with me in admiration of the private character of Colonel. Aarutm.: Such an example would not be without its effect. In his public capacity he -would— be ao eye-witness to the offender and the offended. He would nave an opportunity of witneNsing the conduct ol the iBhabitants, who^ 1 fear, have been calumniated, and In fact, what with the impetus which would be given to trade, together with many political aWalrta^s^tjconsider ihe ben^uts^Bo^to^be^coa^ Termed on launceston are incalculable. Last,! tiough not least, by leaving Hobart Town, His ! ExCETLKXCY^ould repulse that uuwieldy naon-' ster, which in former ages has been the overthrow of Jnflljojii, Schism, which 1 am sorrjr to i see- is,' so openly and ineultingly making n^adin^ftiB \- infant country ^^ pet^a4^.ahaiLjnunj!ijiiij4ill^ave ? the- vanity to intrude itself here in Latin^sUm, under the false character of the ?* Schoolmaster,' should it do sojrhope it will be foiled and put to ? sha me^ thltFnnmnn^Th1iTg8l3- be cumplaitied of ts ? -x not to be doubted. It is impossible for aoy Govern* ? mftit-'ta prevent '' complaint and .cause ^of- com- plaint; but what is inevitable and what is wil ful are^ two things; and if instead of people -^nTiaiixiff_cLimiiu3MSjonejPtings, (which all eiid in. 7a bottle of *moke, and the contempt whlclRffey merit) any one honest statesman would sit down and take^a^Mirn of snuff, by way of clearing his intellect, find then write on a clean she,?t ofpa* per sinTpIeTfiicts, direcitng the~$ame by the first ship direct to tke Colonial Office, all real grie van* — ees would be immediaiely removed. ? -: ? J am, Sir, . Your's truly, AN OLD UNIFORM COAT. Launceston, June 23id, 1331. The WESLEYANS.— We have much pleasure in giving publicity to the following answer, received from the Solicitor-General, to our queries, res pecting the money belonging to the Wesleyan subscribers, arising out of the sale of the chapel : To the Editor of the Launceston Advertiser. "June 21st, 1831. 'Sir, ' In consequence of a remark in your paper, I write in very great haste, to inform you. that the £150 enquired after by some of the late Wesleyan Chapel subscribers, is still in my hands, as stipulated for by the Committee,' and ready to be remitted by roe, at and when they (the Committee) shall direct, [see letter, copy of which Is subjoined] ? *' Having some 8 or 9 weeks ago, seen an adver tisement respecting the then proposed appropri ation of this sum, (which was, it seems, then sup posed to be in the hands of the Government) I instantly addressed a letter to Messrs. Barnes 6c , Kenwokthy, for the purpose of correcting that mistake, and 1 informed those gentlemen that ( should be happy to hand the money over, when* ever directed to (jo so, at the discretion of them* selves, and the other members of the Com ! mittee. 44 1 am of course anxious that no misapprehen sion sh on Id exist on this subject; and 1 beg of you therefore to let the subscribers understand where their money is, and how it may be ob tained. 'l am, Sir, * Your obedient Servant ALFRED STEPHEN." (COPY) "Feb. 19, 1830. "Gentlemen. "In reference to my last letter on the subject of the Wesleyan Chapel, 1 have the honor now to inform you that I transmit by this Post to Mr. Gleadow the necessary Deeds of Conveyance, which i earnestly request may: be executed without delay, as Mr. Carvosso will leave the Colony in the course of ten days or a fortnight. "I shall be glad for the sake of the Wesleyan Society, to receive a favorable answer as to the smaller* sum, which I am disposed to think that the subscribers should consent to accept. "I pledge myself, however, to retain in my hands the full sum of £150, subject to the deci sion of the Committee, and to be remitted as, and when, they may direct me; and the deeds shall not be delivered up by me, or considered as executed, until I have the money for you. This will I hope induce you, without hesitation, to sign the receipt as no time is to be lost. **I have» -&c;, ~ ~~ '— ? ^ (Signed) 'ALFRED STEPHENS ' W. Barnes, and W.
